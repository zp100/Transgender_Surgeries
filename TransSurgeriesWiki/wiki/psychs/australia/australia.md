Some of these psychs and therapists listed on this page are members of [AusPath](https://auspath.org/providers/) and listed on their site - however that doesn't mean they are well regarded in the trans community. If a provider is not a member of AusPath it doesn't mean much - the well known Sydney endocrinologist Dr Jonathan Hayes was never a member of AusPath (or AnzPath that preceded it). Where possible find a psych who is well regarded in the trans community. There are people in Australia who you should avoid.

https://auspath.org.au/providers - lists providers in Australia, but it doesn't say if they are good or not.

# Warning

You should be very careful when choosing a therapist or psychiatrist, read reviews and look for red flags. There's a number of people who should be avoided, and they are not all listed here.

2024-04-02 - reddit [PETITION: Stop Promoting Transphobic Rhetoric at Psychiatrist Conference](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderau/comments/1btqtwm/petition_stop_promoting_transphobic_rhetoric_at/) by orangebasket5 - *"The RANZCP is an organisation which sets the standard for quality psychiatric care in Australia and New Zealand. They run conferences, training, etc. Their annual congress (the big conference) includes a workshop on "Transgender mental health". The focus of this workshop is detransition and dissatisfaction after gender affirming care. Three of the speakers have written papers which stand for all the generic medical transphobia things - gender affirming care doesn't help people, most people regret transitioning, kids shouldn't be allowed to transition, etc etc. The speakers also (unsurprisingly) have ties to transphobic and anti-queer groups."*

In October 2021 the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) came out with a postion statement supporting [coversion therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy). It's apalling that such a thing can still happen in Australia and a very bad sign of things to come.

There's a good analyis of this in the Facebook Group International Transgender Health

* [The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) comes out supporting compulsory conversion therapy (CT) for trans children, adolescents and adults in Position Statement 103](https://www.facebook.com/groups/transgenderhealth/posts/4794589253918796/) by Lisa Toinen Mullin on 14 October 2021

The Position Statment itself.

* [Position statement 103: Recognising and addressing the mental health needs of people experiencing Gender Dysphoria / Gender Incongruence ](https://www.ranzcp.org/news-policy/policy-and-advocacy/position-statements/gender-dysphoria)

A response in 2022 this postion statement, [Re: The RANZCP position statement on gender dysphoria](https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221112007) by Sav Zwickl, Belinda Chaplin, Fiona Bisshop, Teddy Cook, Clara Tuck Meng Soo, Belinda Birtles, Jaimie Veale, Rona Carroll, Rachel Johnson, Joey Macdonald, Jesse Porter, Cassie Withey-Rila, Zoe Kristensen, Ashleigh Lin. [PDF HERE](https://auspath.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zwickl-et-al.2022-Re-the-RANZCP-position-statement-on-gender-dysphoria.pdf). I reconise some of these these people as leading Australian researchers, doctors, etc specialising in transgender care. Sav Zwickl is a notable researcher, Dr Fiona Bisshop is a GP in Brisbane and president of AusPATH, Teddy Cook is on the board of AusPATH, responsible for transhub, and organising medical the Sydney medical community's to care for 4000 trans people after Dr Jon Hayes retired in 2019, Clara Tuck Meng Soo is a well respected trans GP in the ACT awarded the [Order Of Australia in 2016](https://hercanberra.com.au/uncategorized/transgender-gp-dr-clara-tuck-meng-soo-hands-back-her-australian-honour/). Its well worth reading the entire resoponse, but I've extracted some bits here

> Historically, psychiatry has played a central role in the pathologisation of those seeking medical gender affirmation. Gatekeeping, the process by which gender affirming care has been withheld or controlled by the medical field, has been widely practiced in psychiatry, neglecting a patient-led, informed consent approach. As we outline below, the recent RANZCP position statement frames the trans experience as inherently pathological. This is in direct conflict with World Health Organization, American Psychiatric Association, World Professional Association for Transgender Health, AusPATH and PATHA, all of whom make it clear that being trans is not a pathology. Through selectively citing research and treatment guidelines, the position statement equates peer-reviewed evidence with ‘professional opinion’ and the notion of supporting trans people as a ‘debate’.

> Given that being trans is not a pathology, psychiatry’s place in trans healthcare today should be limited to working with mental health concerns, which are faced by trans people inequitably due to stigma, lack of support, discrimination and prejudice...

> In conclusion, the RANZCP position runs directly counter to the well-established evidence base that gender affirmation improves health outcomes and strengthens quality of life. Unreasonable barriers to access and outdated and harmful arbitrary protocols, can only lead to poorer health and wellbeing outcomes for trans people across the lifespan, including young people. Unfortunately, some trans people lose their life through suicide due to the lack of access or denial of appropriate healthcare and
gender affirming treatment.

I would never wish what I went through on another person but it does feel good that I'm not alone... when I saw him I was 15, and he has a policy of never affirming trans kids' gender identity. he misgendered me, he let my mum sit in every session spouting her transphobia and basically agreeing with everything she said about like social contagion, just a phase etc. told me I thought I was trans because I didn't like gender roles. then he told me not to talk about dysphoria essentially so we could find the 'real problem'. I started self harming and dissociating and he showed no signs that he cared and he didn't give me any skills/techniques to help with that. as soon as I started presenting femme he told me I didn't need therapy anymore. really messed me up and made me feel like I needed to be cis to be loveable, especially to be loveable to my parents."*

> Genspect is an international alliance of parent and professional groups whose aim is to advocate for parents of gender-questioning children and young people. Parents are concerned that their kids are not receiving appropriate treatment and support; many do not feel free to speak out about their concerns.

Conversion therapy is a horrific practice with serious long term consequences, including suicide

* https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy - *"So-called “conversion therapy,” sometimes known as “reparative therapy,” is a range of dangerous and discredited practices that falsely claim to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. Such practices have been rejected by every mainstream medical and mental health organization for decades, but due to continuing discrimination and societal bias against LGBTQ people, some practitioners continue to conduct conversion therapy. Minors are especially vulnerable, and conversion therapy can lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness, and suicide."*

    * https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/anti-lgbtq - *"The conferences were sponsored by the Idaho-based Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine (SEGM) and Genspect – key hubs of anti-LGBTQ+ pseudoscience identified in the SPLC’s CAPTAIN report. SEGM’s New York meeting, held Oct. 10-11, 2023, featured appearances by some researchers employed as “expert witnesses” by the anti-LGBTQ hate group Alliance Defending Freedom. Some of these “expert witnesses” have been key to crafting anti-trans legal narratives. Genspect’s Denver meeting, held Nov. 4-5, 2023, featured many of the same participants, but included members of more anti-LGBTQ+ groups including Do No Harm and Child & Parental Rights Campaign as well as notable voices of the far right including James Lindsay. Both conferences represent an attempt by the groups to position themselves as legitimate alternatives to the World Professional Organization for Transgender Health (WPATH) – which represents the global consensus around the benefits of gender-affirming health care – despite their anti-LGBTQ+ extremism."*

She was insistent I should social transition for at least a year before getting HRT. She wrote back to Dr. Rhys saying that my desire to medically transition was an autistic hyperfixation and it should not be indulged.

When I first brought up wanting to explore my gender, they recommended me the book 'The End of Gender' by Debra Soh, a TERF. In the past, they had professed themself to dislike "wokeness". Most recently when I saw them, I brought up the safety and low risk of transition, and they seriously disagreed, bringing up regret rates.

I guess? She found this psychologist and he was the most damaging psychologist I ever had the unpleasant experience of meeting. I was barely 18 and he basically convinced me to discuss my sexual fantasies with him even though I was uncomfortable with this. He told me, “you should be seeing yourself in the female position” in sex fantasies. He’d have this creepy smirk on his face when he would listen to me… he complimented me on how feminine I looked (after I expressed suicidal tendencies and begged to me voluntarily admitted to a psych ward as I was worried I’d take my own life, he looked at me as if “oh man, that’s too much paperwork” and told me, “hang in there”) and he was confused when I got upset. Mum thought YT was “good for me” because of the fact I’d be inconsolably crying under my computer desk after the sessions, she thought it meant “he was getting to the root of the issue” instead of just “agreeing with me and giving me what I want.” Parents just don’t get it. I dropped him after that."*

She instead decided to treat my “symptoms” of gender dysphoria as if it were depression and prescribed me anti-depressants... I decided to take the anti-depressants anyway to see if they’d work and it was horrible, if anything, it made my suicidal ideation even worse."*

Luckily since I've found a better psychiatrist and am fully comfortable with who I am and am living a much happier life.
