Before that, I spoke with my doctor.@doctorhoficial and we talked about the good and the bad that could happen in my reconstruction and well, badly I got necrosis. It's not because of my doctor's bad procedure.@doctorhoficial If not, it is because it was already badly destroyed by the previous surgery in Thailand, so I am dealing with the consequences, my doctor@doctorhoficial he is helping me a lot in this sad process but I am not breaking down, he and I are strong since we both talked about it as a team so he gives me hope that everything will be solved, it is time to wait in the process and enter the oxygen chamber so that my nose revives and does not rot and they do not have to do another operation to remove skin from my forehead and reconstruct it again we do not want that we want my skin to revive so I will take all the instructions that my doctor tells me I love you very much and may God bless you Wish me luck and pray for me that it can happen to all of us I have faith in my doctor and I know that this will pass sparks be careful with@kamolhospital Don't have surgery there, they don't know how to operate and they leave you with all the procedures wrong, if you don't investigate with other trans and you will see"*
