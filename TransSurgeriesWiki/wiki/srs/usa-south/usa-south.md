* [urethro-vaginal fistula after SRS<sup>R</sup>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/1hjquar/urethrovaginal_fistula_after_srs/) by milliev1 in 2025 - *"i got a urethrovaginal fistula pretty early but it took almost 2 months to be acknowledged by the surgeon simply because we didn’t know if it was swelling causing the wild urine spray or not but that was what i was told it was. i insisted it was not that and in a follow up appointment my suspicions were confirmed after he saw me pee and it came from the canal. I was catheterized under anesthesia nov 4th and couldn’t really do much but sit around at home. dec 9th i went in for a follow up and got it taken out but the fistula did not heal. i had the catheter put back in same day not under anesthesia (ouch) and on valentine’s day i’ll go back and have it taken out so we’ll see if it healed by then. if it didn’t i have to have it patched with a urologist or something. not looking forward to that. don’t get urethro-vaginal fistula. catheter is no fun. you have to lug around a bag & not walk too much or you’ll bleed inside or get a UTI which slows healing of the fistula. there’s no better time to tackle a book collection or become a gamer because you can’t really move or even go to work if it’s not a sit down job. you gotta buy your own bags either leg or night bags but never use the same one twice. it’s a lot to handle right after SRS."*
    * [surgery complications making me depressed<sup>R</sup>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/1gdxe3h/surgery_complications_making_me_depressed/) by milliev1 in 2024 - *"I chose Whitehead because of his proximity to me and good enough track record. I had to move to a different state to get a cigna insurance plan and lower the overall cost. I thought i’d pay once and be done but boy was I wrong. First three weeks were hell. I was discharged next day to a hotel for a week then the bandages came off and i was sent home (about 3h from the office). I started to do these salt baths because of how gnarly the surgical site was and did those for two weeks and things cleared up. Dilation was absolutely HELL because i wasn’t getting past 2 inches with a finger or the soul source 1/2in orange. I went in for an impromptu follow up and he was able to open me up more just manually and i could dilate another inch and a half... I noticed i’d been peeing from my vaginal canal and I tried to text the surgeon about it but he didn’t believe me. Fast forward to 2 months i go in for my follow up and pee for the surgeon and he confirms that it’s a urethrovaginal fistula and i need to not dilate with the dilators anymore so now i’m super tight. my middle finger is all i use and it’s just so painful. I also have granulation that needs to be treated with silver nitrate but it was found the same time as my fistula so the fistula gets treated first. I imagine recovery from whatever procedure there is to fix the fistula entails no dilation. Surgeon also says my skin graft could have failed and came out and that’s why i’m so tight. Great. Aesthetically I’m not impressed. It looks okay but the clitoris is huge and not tucked away behind a hood and looks exactly like the tip of a penis (i know that’s what it is) and having the canal below the vulva is a oddity i didn’t expect. I have lopsided labia which is wonderful. I wouldn’t mind the aesthetics if it just felt good or functioned correctly but nope."*

On June 8,  2005,  the Board ordered that Dr.  Raphael's Texas  medical  license be immediately suspended. The action was based on Dr. Raphael's failure  to comply with all  of the terms and conditions of an Order  Dr. Raphael  entered into ith the Board on December  12,  2003.

Two weeks ago I (33nb/amab [he/they]) had a Penile Inversion Vaginoplasty without Orchiectomy (testes retained). My surgeon was Dr. Dany Hanna out of Texas. The procedure was pretty standard overall. More scrotal tissue had to be left attached to house my testes externally in the outer labia and he anchored them in place. I have a clit and possibly inner labia. I'm still very swollen so time will tell with aesthetics. Visually the results are consistent with Dr Hanna's work. I have almost 3" of depth, that's as much as I could get with all things factored in. I'm looking forward to finishing healing. Dr Hanna and team were awesome and he was VERY realistic with me every step of the way. He definitely delivered despite my having a rare request. He does recommend I get my testes examined every couple of year to ensure things are still good down there. I am not on hormones and do not require them."*

I feel like I've been robbed of some of my best skin.) As the title says, I've had a terrible experience with my labiaplasty surgeon and I'm really not sure what to do next. I will probably need revisions but I don't trust him to do it because he wasn't able to do the things I needed in the first place and wrecked my labia majora trying to improve my labia minora. I wish I'd followed my intuition not to do that part. Never trust the confidence of a surgeon. He tried to improve the opening to my vagina but it's still pretty terrible, and he wouldn't even touch the problems of my urethra. I'm honestly feeling butchered and don't want anything more to do with him. He also did some fat grafting but I have a feeling I will need more."* - see also her YouTube channel [Jessë Valentine Portz](https://www.youtube.com/@JesseValentine/videos)

When I get an "erection", I'd say it's about half the length of an erection pre-op. I imagine that as the severed corpora cavernosa tissues atrophy, the amount of extension will go down. However, since there's no blood in the corpora cavernosa, it's very squishy. It's quite a different feeling than erections pre-op. You can kinda see what I mean by getting hard and squishing your glans into your corpora cavernosa (or maybe by pinching below your glans and squishing it into your fingers). One thing to note - I was a grower pre-op (rather than a shower), so that might have an impact on "erections" post-op due to the difference in tissues. I didn't have extreme dysphoria over erections (I did have some), but I definitely have euphoria now that they're gone! In my experience, dysphoria/euphoria are very personal things, so I couldn't say for sure how you would react."*

Went to get a second opinion by the grace of God from a trans healthcare doctor, who IMMEDIATELY noticed something was wrong IMMEDIATELY found abcesses and turns out per CT scan I have infection inside my labia going towards mon pubis and clitoris which is why the swelling was immense.
