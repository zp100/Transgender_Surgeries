* **Doctor Fitness to Practise Details, The doctor has received the following warnings**, 19 Feb 2016 - 18 Feb 2021, *On five occasions in 2013 and 2014, Mr Christopher Inglefield failed to complete adequate surgical consent forms for a patient on whom he carried out a series of cosmetic breast procedures. He failed to record adequate details of the procedures on the consent forms and made written revisions on two of the consent forms that were not countersigned by the patient. This conduct does not meet with the standards required of a doctor. It risks bringing the profession into disrepute and it must not be repeated. The required standards are set out in Good Medical Practice and associated guidance. In this case, paragraph 17 of Good Medical Practice (2013) is particularly relevant: 17. You must be satisfied that you have consent or other valid authority before you carry out any examination or investigation, provide treatment or involve patients or volunteers in teaching or research. Whilst this failing in itself is not so serious as to require any restriction on his registration, it is necessary in response to issue this formal warning. This warning will be published on the List of Registered Medical Practitioners (LRMP) for a period of five years and will be disclosed to any person enquiring about his fitness to practise history. After five years, the warning will cease to be published on LRMP; however, it will be kept on record and disclosed to employers on request.*

At the start of 2021, I decided to go private and try to fix the whole thing. After much back and forth with surgeons in Thailand and the UK, I chose Mr Inglefield and the LTC. I immediately felt seen and understood and he confirmed all the problems I felt I had and vowed to fix it. I paid just shy of 20k and the experience has been nothing short of abysmal. I’ve been lied to, gaslighted, and treated with nothing but utter contempt from this clinic. To cut a really long story short, nothing has changed - I’m still in the exact same position. Mr Inglefield never even attempted to remove the excess erectile tissue, and had the nerve to tell me it was never discussed. I left a detailed review on TrustPilot but the LTC has now flagged this for harmful or illegal content! LAUGHABLE."*

The 6-inch mark on my dilator now sits flush with my labia minora. This was achieved simply by putting extra pressure on the dilator, as advised on the previous thread and by my surgical nurse when consulted. I occasionaly use coconut oil as a lubricant, which has had the added effect of softening the skin around my pelvic floor considerably."*
