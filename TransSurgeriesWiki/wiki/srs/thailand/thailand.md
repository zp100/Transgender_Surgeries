# Introduction

According to Dr Preecha in a [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25356769) published in 2015 - *"To date, there are more than 100 reputable surgeons in Thailand who are able to perform a vaginoplasty in MTF transsexuals."*

The government's stance is supported by the Gay Political Group of Thailand, which has "campaigned for greater regulation of the industry and an end to the castration of juveniles". Its head, Natee Teerarojjanapongs, told the Bangkok Post: "It's a totally wrong perception that castration will make boys more feminine. These youngsters should wait until they are mature enough to thoroughly consider the pros and cons of such an operation.""*

The 2018 book "Mobile Subjects: Transnational Imaginaries of Gender Reassignment" by Aren Z. Aizura talks about surgery in Thailand. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JWD3L6M/).

> Since they began participating in the medical travel market, grs surgeons in Thailand have also adapted their protocols to address both national and international anxieties about regulation. In 2009 the Medical Council of Thailand wrote a policy to regulate grs. Under the new law trans people must consult a psychiatrist, live in their preferred gender for a year, and receive hormone therapy before having grs. The Thai law addressed an ongoing national concern about a “rash” of teenagers obtaining cheap orchiectomy (castration): the previous year
a well-known gay Thai activist, Natee Teerarojjanapongs, had called on the government to prevent clinics from operating on “boys,” and the Thai health minister banned nonmedical orchiectomy for a time.

## THAI-PATH

The [*Thailand Professional Association for Transgender Health*](https://www.thai-path.com/) seems to be the Thai version of [WPATH](https://www.wpath.org/). Dr Preecha of PAI is the chairman and Dr Navipa Dusitanond (also known as Dr Prae of the Suporn Clinic) is Assistant Secretary. I don't recognise the rest. There's some links at the bottom of that page in Thai that includes some well known surgeons.

## Institute of HIV Research and Innovation

https://ihri.org - *"IHRI is a non-profit organization who has achieved recognition for its work, including clinical and operational research, policy mobilization and development projects for community health services, at national and international levels."*

IHRI runs the Tangerine Clinic for transgender health, and in 2020 published "The Thai Handbook of Transgender Healthcare Services, 1st Edition", followed by an English version in 2021.

* https://ihri.org/transgender-health
* https://ihri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Thai-Handbook-of-Transgender-Heatlhcare-Services.pdf

No doubt this origanisation is doing a great deal of good in Thailand, but it also illustrates some strange contradictions as seen from a Western viewpoint. Page 19-26 of the handbook deals with "Diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria", and appears very backwards and gatekeeping by Western standards.

> Another tool in the psychiatric evaluation is the psychological test and *trial period living as the opposite sex.* This trial period includes asking individuals to dress, socialize, and carry out activities as the desired sex over at least 12 consecutive months. Detailed records that can be reviewed must be taken, with specific attention to duration, continuity, and personal results from
the trial period.

> Case Study: A 22-year-old male university student, was referred to a psychiatrist for evaluation prior to initiating feminizing hormone therapy. He told the psychiatrist that he has started cross-dressing about six months ago because he felt sexually satisfied and more comfortable when wearing female clothing. He still perceived himself as a man but wanted to take feminizing hormones to make his appearance look more like a woman. He is an only child, and his parents have anger management issues. He was treated for depression and ADHD as a child. He wears female shoes while wearing male clothing. He does not make eye contact and had pressured speech. After taking a thorough history, he reported difficulty getting along with friends. The psychiatrist diagnosed him with transvestism and autistic spectrum disorders with family problems. He then received psychiatric treatment including counseling and family therapy.

Page 30 on Gender Affirming Hormone Treatment (GAHT), redefines *informed consent* as understood in the Western countries. We do not normally need a disagnosis of gender dysphoria by a psych for "informed consent"; It is self-affirmed and consent is judged by the prescribing doctor as with all other medical interventions. It starts off with

> Before GAHT, a psychosocial assessment must be conducted by a specialist. Individuals must always be asked for informed consent. The following criteria should be met (Recommendation level 1):

> 1. The diagnosis of gender dysphoria must be confirmed.

> 2. Individuals must be competent to make their own decisions and able to give consent for
treatment. ...

## HRT in Thailand

A bit off topic, but I find it interesting.

You can buy HRT without prescription in Thailand. No doctor, just go to a pharmacy and pay. Hence some Thail trans people start very young, because they can.

Two new surgeons, Dr Bank and Dr Prae, were to take over. Dr Prae apparently did a few surgeries, but Dr Bank has taken over now that Dr SUporn has finally retired. A [lottery<sup>R</sup>](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/75juhi/reserving_a_date_with_suporn_is_no_longer_first/) was also announced to get surgery dates, but it looks like its not longer in effect.

Preecha (of PAI) trained Suporn (and many other surgeons in Thailand), but it was a very long time ago and Suporn's come up with his new technique since then. Chettawut is reputed to use at least some of Suporn's techniques.

Your depth is likely to be less than 5 inches. From our experience with clients with prior BBL, creating vagina canal is difficult, skin-graft does not attach well to the vaginal wall and there is a high chance of skin necrosis after the surgery. You may also experience very difficult dilation. If you wish to proceed, please acknowledge this risk and potential consequences in advance.”"*

I had a BBL before Srs with Bank and he said I lost a lot of blood, and that sometimes it can cause other complications with the graft. Thankfully I didn’t get any, but it’s definitely not a sure fire thing... t’s in the Astra discord for Bank patients and based on my own convos with Bank, but looking at the announcement in the discord I think it was sent via email to a patient? So not sure it’s like a fully official thing yet... he said I was mostly fine because I had a fairly mild one. And specifically it was about going up through the Mons pubis for lipo that was the issue, so it definitely depends. Also Bank has such a unique technique so may just be him. Hopefully it’s not an issue for others!"*

The 2018 book "Mobile Subjects: Transnational Imaginaries of Gender Reassignment" by Aren Z. Aizura talks about surgery in Thailand. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JWD3L6M/).

> A small number of surgeons gained a reputation outside Thailand and began to attract a large non-Thai customer base. Dr. Suporn reported that in 1996 he was performing around twenty to thirty grs procedures per year, mainly on Thai patients. By 2006 he was operating on around 220 patients per year and was only performing grs, breast augmentation, and facial feminization procedures. These 220 patients were almost exclusively non-Thai, traveling from Europe, North America, and other locales outside Asia.

## Teerapong Poonyakariyagorn

Does Peritoneal Pull-Though Vaginoplasty.

Location

* Bangkok

I'd not heard of this surgeon before and can't find out much. Not sure how much of this info is relevant, and its possible some of it is a different person.

* http://pai.co.th/dr-teerapong-poonyakariyagorn-md/ (different spelling)
* https://www.isaps.org/listing/dr-theerapong-poonyakariyagorn/
* http://www.interplastclinic.com/services/male-to-female/sex-change-male-female-mtf/
* https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bangkok-Cosmetic-Surgery-ClinicDrTheerapong-Poonyakariyagorn/383951751664124 (Bangkok Cosmetic Surgery Clinic)
* https://www.azurite.com.au/
* http://thesexchange.com/
* https://www.surgeryrevolution.com/male-to-female-sex-reassignment-surgery

This pdf lists the payment to the bank account of "Theerapong Poonyakariyagorn". The Beneficiary address for the bank is "59/469 Rama II road, Bangkhuntien, Bangkok, Thailand, 10150", the same address as BCS Clinic. Its alo the only place I can find the any surgeons name on that site, which seems quite odd. The pdf shows some results.

In general, pain management was bad. I don’t remember much of first 2 days. What I do remember is terrible pain and when I asked for medicines, the nurses usually refused to give me any. At that time my friends stayed with me most of the time and communication with nurses was hard, because they didn’t really speak English... And around 2 hours after every dose I kept waking up screaming. Truly horrifying experience... Despite the unimaginable pain I experienced, I do actually recommend doctor Thee for this surgery. I talked to multiple doctors before and he is the only one that actually listened to my needs and made me feel understood. He provided great depth and aesthetics."*

## Thep Vejvisith

Location

* Bangkok, [google street view](https://goo.gl/maps/3aosDytteHF2) probably.

*Note that Thep is not on the [list of qualified plastics surgeons](http://www.surgery.or.th/en/surgeon.php) in Thailand.*

Thep is famous for being very cheap - US$2200 for SRS.

Surgeons sites

* https://www.facebook.com/PratunamPolyclinicSRS
* https://doctorthep.pl.tl/PROCEDURES-AND-PRICES.htm

Note that while Dr Thep is very cheap, he's almost unknown outside Thailand and doesn't share the reputation of the well known Thai surgeons.

Dr Suporn's 2019 paper on SRS contains the following acknowlegement. The other doctor is Dr Bank of the Suporn Clinic.

> The author sincerely thanks colleagues ***Dr Poonpissamai Suwajo*** and Dr Chayamote Chayangsu for their invaluable help with supportive medical information, and to Sophie Taylor, executive coordinator.

In the pdf [Report on Transgender-Competent Care Workshop](https://www.aidsdatahub.org/sites/default/files/publication/TRCARC-Transgender-Competent-Care-Workshop-Report-2019.pdf), Jan 2019, in Bangkok

> Dr. Poonpisamai Suwajo, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon from the Department of Surgery, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand, presented the latest technique for vaginoplasty in transgender women called *peritoneal vaginoplasty*. For this technique, the tissue from the peritoneum that encircles the inside of the abdomen is used to create the neo-vagina. This vaginoplasty technique requires a relatively easy surgical procedure with smaller intraoperative blood loss and less operative time when comparing to other penile inversion techniques. The technique can help achieve a result that is very close to the biological female genitals, both cosmetically and functionally.  The commonly used techniques for transgender men who wish to undergo genital surgery are metoidioplasty and phalloplasty. Metoidioplasty is less invasive because it takes advantage of testosterone’s enlarging effect on the clitoris. It is an alternative for those who do not wish to have a complete phalloplasty or for those who initially choose metoidioplasty and later want to undergo a phalloplasty.
