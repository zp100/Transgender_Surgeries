I’m an Australian Plastic Surgeon specialised in gender affirming surgery... I completed my specialist training in 2022 and have undertaken a further 2 years of subspecialty training since then in Craniomaxillofacial surgery, rhinoplasty and gender affirming surgery in Australia, South America and Europe. I’m currently in Spain working with IM gender clinic. I will be returning to Adelaide in January to start private practice exclusively for gender affirming surgery. I am trained in FFS/FMS, top, bottom and body contouring surgery...  I will be performing vaginoplasty (all techniques) and metoidioplasty but will hold off on free flap phalloplasty with urethral reconstruction until I establish a multi-D team in Adelaide as it requires input from different surgical specialties and cooperation from the hospitals to allow the case complexity. I also do Adams apple reduction (thyroid chondroplasty) but do not do vocal cord surgery as it’s out of my scope of training and practice."*
