> Plastic surgeon. City: Rio de Janeiro and Lisbon/Portugal. Trained under Dr. João Décio Ferreira in Lisbon. He's renowned in trans surgeries in Brazil and frequently does reconstruction for botched/unsatisfactory procedures. His vaginoplasty technique uses a jejunum mucosa graft as vaginal lining, which reportedly doesn't smell like colon nor constantly lubricates like peritoneum (his patients confirm this in his facebook group). Another advantage mentioned is a shorter/easier dilation schedule. Does phallo/meto as well. Vaginoplasty + hospital fees costs around BRL 42k. https://www.marciolittleton.com/

> Urologist. City: Porto Alegre. Trained under Dr. Walter Koff, one of the pioneers of SRS in Brazil. He's one of the surgeons that do vaginoplasty through the public health system, and has large mileage, claiming to have conducted over 200 surgeries in the past ten years. However his poor technique (no labia minora or clitoral hood) and awful bedside manners are often criticized, and there are a few horror stories confirmed. Unknown if he uses the same technique and manners for paying customers. Not recommended. http://prouro.com.br/home/
