As far as I know, Dr Veselý's results are considered amongst the best here in Czech Republic so I don't even want to imagine what are the worst... I went for all this unforeseen ordeal just because it was covered by my healthcare insurance and I didn't expect such an outcome. If I knew, I would never go for that."*

I got worried that I might end up the same way and sadly, my results aren't much different as you can see on the photos below... From the beginning till now, I manage to get in 7-8 cm in with a dilator. He said that I can expect maximum 9 cm depth, given the initial penis size of 14 cm erected... I am very bothered by the aesthetics - a huge penis-like clit, unhooded, a lot of hanging skin which is supposed to be the outer labiae, the vaginal opening looks like a separate entity, not being part of the vulva, and it's overall very asymetric - the entire clitoral structure is rotated to the right and the rest of the tissue follows it."*

These two papers have many authors, but since it is the "combined method" is seems likely that Schaff is the surgeon. I don't know for sure.

* [Komplikationen nach MtF-GaOp?](https://www.reddit.com/r/germantrans/comments/109k8pj/komplikationen_nach_mtfgaop/) by youraveragelinguist in 2023 - google translated *" I had my first GaOp at Schaff in Potsdam in 09/21. This went horribly wrong. Summary: rectovaginal fistula, complete side torn open, open bowel, neovagina was removed again. The torn intestinal wall was sewn up, with the result that anal sex is no longer possible because of the scar. After a year of rehab, then 11/22 next op at schaff, this time "successfully" with a full skin transplant. About 12cm long. Now the clue: the third operation is now 8 weeks ago and I'm really struggling with my neovagina: first unspeakable pain when bougien (but you all know that and it's normal), then inflammation, infections and finally a torn vaginal entrance. Despite all that, I bougied 4 times a day in tears and fainting because I never wanted to have my vagina taken from me again. Only to find out after 8 weeks that my neovagina has contracted extremely. It's only about as long as my middle finger, let it be 8 cm... I'll have a scar across my stomach and thighs for life and I'm not even sure if it will be worth it or if I'll need a fourth op. I can't imagine that 8cm can be satisfying. Since the failed first op, I can no longer have anal sex."*

I’m still pretty happy with the results because dilation is fairly easy and I have about 17+ cm of depth. I think Dr Schaff is a relatively good surgeon, but he needs to be paired with a good Gynecologist. My situation was not good with the fistula. However, the support of Dr Hertwig in Berlin. Made it bearable. I had an appointment everyweek to check how the healing process went. Now I’m eager to do the second operation to get the fistula fixed and the other tweaks that comes with the second op."*

I'll try to describe it: It's just a larger lump that is supposed to be the clitoris, which is exposed, unprotected, underneath that is the urethral opening and underneath that is the entrance to the vagina and around the outside are the labia. It just looks so weird. Especially when you sit with your legs apart, you look straight into the vagina and everything else. To me it doesn't look like a vagina at the moment, I have to be honest and I can't imagine that after healing or the second operation everything will look better and more like something...

Noémi Bordás has created a nice and friendly environment in the last 1-2 years, with a friendly and well-educated staff. she's working together with/under guidance of the Serbian team in Belgrade (see dr. Miroslav Djordjevic). (because of this setup, it's possible to get any surgery done by dr. Miroslav Djordjevic at Kiskunhalas too, afaik.) dr. Noémi Bordás offers trans healthcare in a wide range, including HRT, top surgery, gonadectomy, phalloplasty-metoidioplasty-vaginoplasty etc.

They did a Peritoneal Flap Pullthrough to replace the vaginal cavity that is now usable and without any hair. They also removed most of the scarring tissue and rebuilt part of the labia majora and constructed a small clitoral hood.  Now I still have irritation while masturbating or playing because the skin is very tense around the vulva and on the labia. Also I don't like the aesthetics that doesn't look like natural enough to my point of view.

The bad results of grs are horrifying not only because of the complications (the typical ones: anorgasmia, loss of sensation, loss of clitoris, a vaginal opening too small, lack of labia minora) but also because of the dismissive post-op treatment for such patients. He has great marketing and ive read people that are genuinely happy with their Mañero grs results, but the cases that go wrong are totally ignored by him and his team..."*

The hospital he works out of however was a horrible experience due to him only working out of/renting the hospital, the nurses seemed to be annoyed with me even thought I was in horrible pain, taking 30 minutes to come after I hit the buzzer, plus none of them knowing english definitely doesn't help (although Im not expecting them to learn an entire language for me lol). Another girl i am speaking with had horrible complications to the point where he almost killed her and she is considering a lawsuit. He also hasnt spoke to me in months. Other than that my Vulva looks okay other than my labia minora being fused and the clitoris being jn a weird place which can be fixed with a revision. Just waiting on sensation now, although my recent mental state is not helping with the recovery of it. In my opinion you should do more research for other surgeons before you decide but the price point and informed consent were big pros for me."*
