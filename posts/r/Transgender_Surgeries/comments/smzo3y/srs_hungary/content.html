Does anyone have any resources for SRS in Hungary, most of what I&#39;ve come across brings up error 404 and I can&#39;t find out anything about the surgeons there on the wiki

As far as I can tell, he doesn&#39;t have an official website. I found some info about him on the page of the clinic he works at, but it&#39;s only in Hungarian ðŸ˜”

Iâ€™d still like the link so I can add it to the wiki. Also, google chrome should translate it.

He doesn&#39;t have any trans related info on it, but it has his phone number.

When I went to him in 2020 this was the case, I&#39;m not sure about currently.
</p>
<p>
Dates:
</p>
<p>
I asked for a consultation in January, got an appointment for early February, then got the date for the surgery itself for late June. I stayed at the clinic and the hotel next to it for a week total.
</p>
<p>
Price:
</p>
<p>
At the time, the surgery was 1,550,000 huf (which is about 4kâ‚¬ in current value), with about 200k overhead for travel, the stay in the clinic and the hotel attached to it afterwards, meals, dilating kit, etc.
</p>
<p>
Procedure:
</p>
<p>
As far as I know, he only uses the penile inversion method. I wanted to get a zero depth vulvoplasty but he refused to do that, so I got a complete vaginoplasty. Healing took about 6-8 weeks, during which I had checkups every week. They left a catheter in me for 5 weeks because my urethra wasn&#39;t healing well, but that can vary by person.
</p>
<p>
The place:
</p>
<p>
The clinic is in a town called PÃ©cs. It&#39;s a nice place on its own, and not very far from Budapest whether by car or train. The clinic itself is very nicely equipped, with helpful nurses reachable for 24 hours a day. They give 3 meals a day during your clinic stay and painkillers on demand. The hotel next to it is a 4 star wellness spa/hotel with a nice, relatively inexpensive restaurant in it. They give a discount if you stay after being treated at the clinic.
</p>
<p>
Aftercare:
</p>
<p>
They don&#39;t give you a dilating kit, but when I asked about it, they gave me a link from where I could order it. They also give pointers to what creams and medication to use while healing, but only when you ask.
</p>
<p>
The downsides:
</p>
<p>
The surgeon is kinda sexist, making jokes about boob size and &#34;fingering&#34; during checkups, but he treats trans women like he would cis ones, so at least he&#39;s inclusive. He&#39;s also kinda hard to reach, I have no email contact for him and very often nobody picks up his phone, and his assistants only call you back a few days later. Additionally, when they give you an appointment, they regularly run a few hours late (e.g. they tell you to arrive by 3 pm but you only get to see the doctor by 4-5 pm).
