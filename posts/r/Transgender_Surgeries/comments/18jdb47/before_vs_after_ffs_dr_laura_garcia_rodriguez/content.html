6 months out. Posting this so people have some sort of reference of her work. Tbh I&#39;m not exactly thrilled with my results. I didn&#39;t really need ffs aside from my brown bone and I think my brow lift has created a somewhat masculine looking forehead shape. Unfortunately I&#39;m not really sure there is much to be done with a revision. My friends family and my surgeon all seem to think its a good result I just feel like its pretty lack luster. I think the surgeon has a really good team working with her and I&#39;m not mad I did it. Tbh I just wish I had the opportunity to go to a more aggressive surgeon like Mardirossian or Db.  It could be in my head as I&#39;m feeling better about it compared to a few months ago.

Hi! I just had a consultation with her, may I ask what else you got done or did you just have the brow bone done? Thanks!

umh I honestly cant say she takes instate medicaid, and most insurance policies that cover ffs. Mine was covered through amazon. So I think what was charged was like 40K but I know that some surgeons charge more through insurance and my deductible was only around 2k. If you are paying out of pocket I don&#39;t know why you wouldn&#39;t go to someone like Cardenas. Almost everyone I know who has gone through her is doing so via Medicaid. She also really only does major reconstructive rhinos and ffs.

Hello, do you still feel that you made a mistake with your choice of care? Your before and after photos are very different from one-another; you are much more girly now. Did you ever end up doing revisions?

Hi I had a pretty swollen recovery. I do not view the surgery as a mistake. I don&#39;t think I would necessarily do revisions other than rhino and maybe seeing if I could get a little bit flatter on my brow. But rhinos are essentially just aesthetic choice so I don&#39;t view that as a major revision my nose is fine and not particularly bad.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I might do is soft tissue fat grafting etc, or cheek augmentation. I posted this in a bit of a depressive spell, I get significantly gendered correctly more post ffs even when I dress boyish. Overall im happy with my results :) Post op depression is real and I didnt realize that I had more swelling even after like 9 months.

Bonjour, je suis désolé, mon français est horrible. J&#39;ai arrêté d&#39;étudier le français il y a 4 ans. Mais mon visage avant l’opération ressemblait presque comme un cis. Mais vous pouvez voir la différence dans mon profil. bonne chance avec votre ffs.

No, she says she will make you look like a sister you never had or a “twin”. 1000% not the case. I still look masculine as hell I had mine done in December 2023. It am severely disappointed with my surgery and the aftercare at the hospital!! I don’t recommend unless it’s your only option. I am going with Mardirossian out of pocket to fix the mess she made. I am misgendered 100% of the time still, make up, clothes it does not matter still misgendered everyday!!

Tbh I dont know I get misgendered a lot still and its pretty hurtful to me. Maybe its because I still present masculine etc but idk.

You look very femme!! Your brow bone is exceptional, 100% better than she did with me. My orbits are all male looking and I doubt she even did anything to them I was sore for maybe a week and bruising was only there for three weeks. It was like going to a drive through surgery.
