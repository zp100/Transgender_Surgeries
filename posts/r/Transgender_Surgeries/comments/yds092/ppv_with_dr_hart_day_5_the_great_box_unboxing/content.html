~TW for rather graphic explanation of drain removal and aesthetic results~
</p>
<p>
Today was one of the biggest day I think I’ll have in the whole process, drains came out, and external packing came off, and got the grand reveal🥰
</p>
<p>
Let’s start with the drain removal - omg that was one of the weirdest feeling I have ever and likely will ever experience. I had 2 smaller drains in my mons pubis and one big one up in my abdomen. The first 2 came out with little issue, if maybe some stinging and odd sensations, they looked like they were maybe 6 or so inches inside and about the thickness of spaghetti strands. The third one tho… I don’t know how else to explain it other than the chestburster in alien😳👀
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t painful but it was ~weird~ it was over a footlong and and about as thick as an extension cable (maybe a little thicker) and I could feel it wiggle around as it pulled out. If you ever wanted to experience being a beyblade this will be one of the closest approximations😆
</p>
<p>
Once it was out the rest of the outer dressing came off and damn did I get emotional. Aesthetically I’m amazed how great it looks for 5 days post op. Relatively little swelling, minimal bruising, sutures look to be holding well, I was expecting a bloated, bruised, franken-cunt and that wasn’t even close.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy to share more details in DM, but as Hart trained under Phil Thomas you can see a lot similarities with him and other similar UK surgeons (Bellringer and Tina Rashid in particular) so if you like that vibe you’ll like his work.
</p>
<p>
I’ll also preface that I’m a young (24), healthy, rather skinny (5ft 10 and 79kg/175 lb) with a pretty small penis and circumcised - so a good candidate for surgery apart from the lack of donor material so ymmv
</p>
<p>
I know there’s been some concerns raised by previous patients (particularly on Facebook) with his aesthetic results. While each opinion is valid, personally I quite like the style and as far as I can see the aesthetics look wonderful. A lot of these more negative reviews seem to be from almost a year or more ago and considering how high volume he is he’s very likely gotten a lot more practice and improvement from then and shows a lot of consistency.
</p>
<p>
In recent promotional material he is described as one of the highest volume bottom surgeons in the world and looks like he’s doing multiple a week - if I had to guess 2-3 a week based on the amount of girls I’ve seen here however this is total speculation.
</p>
<p>
My surgery took 6.25 hours and he went above and beyond for the best result particularly considering my minimal material and managed to avoid having to graft the peritoneal tissue and kept it attached to the blood supply so he by no means is rushing them out and I imagine is balancing bottom surgery, after care, and other surgeries for best results and a well rounded practice.
</p>
<p>
As always please feel free to ask questions below or in my DMs and I’ll answer everything I can💖💖

Omg, the drug-filled ramblings post op... I had wife, nurses, even the anesthesiologist ROLLING while I was on meds... and those drains coming out??? 🤢🤢🤢 like you said, not painful, but just blecht!!!
</p>
<p>
Anyways, congrats on surgery, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re pleased!!!! When they let you out, peeing often... even if it&#39;s just a few drops.... will go a long way to keeping pain levels down. Pretty sure I peed every 45-90 minutes... AFTER I suffered through high pain levels.

thank you sm for the great write up! its so nice to see more experiences with Dr. Hart, my consult. with him is in april i think? And i’m hoping to see more recent results to satisfy a decision over the uncertainty that is thai surgeons 😅

No problem! A good friend of mine went through Suporn clinic just a month ago so I think I have a pretty good comparison of the two
</p>
<p>
Dr Hart is a really great option, particularly if you don’t want to leave Australia. Just hold on tight to your consult date, as I know he is booked out for years now

Oh just that i had my heart set on Suporn clinic but wasnt lucky enough to beat the “50+ emails” that were before me. So i have to try my luck again later in 3 months and still might not get lucky :/

Don’t understand why they can’t take the tubes out if you go back under again just to have them removed. Instead of having to be awake and feel it being pulled out from you. 👨🏻‍⚕️🤔🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️😖😣
