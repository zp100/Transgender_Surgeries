EDIT: I have been informed that the website and Instagram posting has been removed, the Dr allegedly had no idea of this going on though is entirely responsible for any and all publications on his page and for those whom he hires to post on his page. The appropriate authorities have been notified of this copyright infringement and false representation and will respond accordingly. I will not be taking any further questions or comments on this matter. Thank you to all who reached out and shared resources, etc.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday a redditor asked about a technique this surgeon was pursuing so I went to check out his website. When I got there I was HORRIFIED to find MY top surgery photos on his website. I have NEVER heard of this guy much less had surgery with him.
</p>
<p>
This is a direct attack on our community and an extreme danger to anyone who is pursuing surgery with him as he is claiming other surgeon’s work as his own.
</p>
<p>
I have already contacted my surgeon and they are investigating the matter. I am also filing a complaint with the Maryland medical board and seeking legal action against him. I’ve already filed a HIPPA complaint against him.
</p>
<p>
I strongly encourage anyone who has had ANY gender affirming surgery to look through his patient photos to see if he has stolen your photos as well. And spread this like wildfire! Our fellow trans and GNC community members are in extreme danger.

I thought this Dr had a good reputation in the trans world. Probably someone involved with the website

He has a very good reputation and seems to really care. I was thinking this as well and the office manager&#39;s probably to blame too. The people who handle websites usually are not the surgeons. But I am not sure what happened here so...

&#34;Dear Patients, Prospective Patients, and Community,
</p>
<p>
I was recently made aware that a before/after image on my website, Drdelcorral.com, represented an individual&#39;s results who is not my patient. I was surprised to learn that there was an error and the image has been removed. I am actively working with my website company to understand how this happened, to correct, and to confirm that the only images being represented on the website are my patients who have given consent to share their photos.
</p>
<p>
It is my honor to work with my patients, and want to assure you that I take this matter very seriously. You are entrusting your care to me, and I will always strive to earn and maintain that trust.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Edit: seems to be an office issue.

It’s not going to make any difference. He’s a popular surgeon with plenty of positive reviews, and as long as his response is reasonable it will quickly blow over.

What slander? It appears someone’s photos were posted without permission.

pointing out that photos were posted without permission is not slander. claiming that a surgeon is a &#34;predator&#34; is slander.

A statement is only slanderous if it&#39;s knowingly false.

you can easily google the definition of slander and see that this is not true. simply having a reckless disregard for the truth or making a statement without reasonably attempting to ascertain the truth of it beforehand (as op did) could absolutely be considered slander by a court if it damages someone&#39;s reputation.

The surgeon already admitted that the OP&#39;s images were presented as his work on his website. This happened. The reason appears to be a error, but they are attempting to find out more information --as they should. In the meantime, OP has raised concerns and speculated on problems they feel might be raised or impacted by this error.
</p>
<p>
The OP is pissed off, but I haven’t read anything that couldn&#39;t be construed as a valid reaction or interpretation  of what they believed happened.

Is there proof? As it stands, I think, this could also be slander.

You could send a cease and desist letter to have the images taken down. Just awful!
