Edit: also good luck! I hope it goes well! üíö
</p>
<p>
No prob! Other peoples posts gave me peace of mind so I wanted to also contribute!
</p>
<p>
Other than the post-op pack than you have received no I wasn‚Äôt told what to look for.
</p>
<p>
I think it might have been missed during my time in the hospital because i didn‚Äôt ‚Äúopen my legs‚Äù enough for it to show during the regular check ins.
</p>
<p>
After my second dilation (first on my own) I injured the dehiscence area and caused some bleeding which quickly ceased. I reported it to the nurses + Tina but I said I wasn‚Äôt worried nor did I adequately explain where it was! Had I been more aware that dehiscence  can occur below the vagina in this way I would have immediately asked for support.
</p>
<p>
It was scary at first when I realised that it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúright‚Äù I‚Äôll be honest. I would reccomend ordering some manuka honey tubes, manuka honey gauze patches and regular gauze before you go into the hospital. That way if it occurs when you get home you can immediately begin treatment. I had to wait two days for my honey to arrive in the post!

Looks amazing so far! More info on NHS results is really appreciated. I was scheduled for Tina but they stopped performing at St George‚Äôs so now I‚Äôm going to Brighton in March.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks for sharing &amp; wishing you a speedy recovery!

I&#39;m also aiming for my surgery with Rashid and am considering a private orchi to bridge the wait - I don&#39;t know why it didn&#39;t occur to me to get the orchi with Tina too so everything &#34;down there&#34; is handled by the same surgeon! Could you let me know some more details on the orchi? Costs experience etc? Happy for you to DM if easier!
</p>
<p>
Also, having your first surgical assessment at the same time as your 2nd GIC appointment - didn&#39;t know this was a thing! Hopefully I can do this with Nottingham GIC too!!

Hiya! - So for price context the op date was in January 2022 I paid ¬£2790 for the orchiectomy itself which covered the surgery, hospital stay (day case, no overnight), and anaesthetic fee. I also paid ¬£200 ish for Tina‚Äôs surgical consultation fee. I also ended up spending ¬£900 on two private surgical referrals for gender confirmation surgery which are required for an orchiectomy unfortunately. So just shy of ¬£4000 in all.
</p>
<p>
The private surgical referrals were honestly the greatest hassle. The lead times I were offered from different private clinics on these ranged from 3 to 12 months. I would recommend get sorted on those asap. Tina and her team were very understanding and agreed to do my pre-op consult whilst I still only had one referral and was arranging the second.
</p>
<p>
As for the surgery itself, it was very quick! So fast in fact I wasn‚Äôt aware it had happened. I was under GA for about an hour, and went home the same day. (You get sent home with a ‚Äòjock strap‚Äô FYI which is a bit dysphoria triggering). Then I had two full weeks off work.
</p>
<p>
The recovery was very straightforward and I was able to sit without my donut cushion after a few days. Bruising and swelling took the full two weeks to clear. 90% of the pain was a strong dull ache near the inguinal canals where the spermatic chord and nerve bundles are severed off. A small blessing is that you don‚Äôt have to deal with this pain on top of vaginoplasty down the line.
</p>
<p>
The method for the surgery is the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù raphe incision, and it healed up relatively fast and left borderline no scarring, seriously! In the future once I‚Äôm further into recovery from SRS I will post a pre-op photo showing the incision because I see a lot of people thinking that getting a simple orchi prevents SRS down the line which is not true.
</p>
<p>
Anyways overall, I would really reccomend, especially if you‚Äôre also in NHS limbo. For me tucking was super painful before my orchi and I was really struggling with the mental health aspects of constantly having dysphoria triggered by the testes being in the way when doing sports and going out. After the orchi tucking became much  simpler, but still required. But my range of clothing where tucking wasn‚Äôt required increased, and wearing comfy clothes at home was more comfortable which helped a lot.
</p>
<p>
Another small benefit of doing the orchi at your chosen vaginoplasty clinic, is the familiarity! When I came back to Parkside @ Putney for my SRS consult one of the nurses thought I was there for my vaginoplasty check up because she remembered me but couldn‚Äôt quite put her finger on it! üòÖhonestly the whole team there are so great and down to earth
</p>
<p>
I hope that helps re: orchiectomy! Sorry for the wall of text!
</p>
<p>
With me having my second appointment at the GIC double as a surgical referral. I had begun HRT privately with LTC in 2017 and had FFS there also in 2019, so in the eyes of the CHX GIC I was a case that could be progressed with ‚Äòconfidence‚Äô because I had already made irreversible transition commitments as it were. I‚Äôm grateful my doctor I saw took this initiative, but I don‚Äôt know how commonplace it is. I would suggest that you can only ask! When you get the letter for your second appointment you should suggest this to the GIC!
</p>
<p>
If there‚Äôs more private or detailed questions you‚Äôd like to ask just send me a message :)

This is incredibly helpful thank you!! How did you go about your two referrals? I had my diagnosis with Dr Pasterski at Harley Street so may go the same route but more options are welcome!
</p>
<p>
Our journeys sound somewhat similar! I&#39;m currently private with GHC (formally LTC) and have had breast augmentation privately too. Hopefully I can &#34;double up&#34; my second appointment too! I will certainly give them a call when I get my 2nd appointment letter through!

I ended up compiling a list of all places that provide the service and just ringing up and sending emails and getting responses and weighing up my choices. There might be some resources on Reddit which list these places. Honestly this was the most logistically difficult bit of the whole orchi because some of these psychs and their teams are quite unprofessional and demand a pretty penny for their ‚Äúservices‚Äù!
</p>
<p>
If you had a BA definitely make that point then about doing your surgery assessment sooner!

Hi, it&#39;s all looking good. Can you give me a contact email please for the care team Rashid uses, I had mine done last February but at St George&#39;s and recently learned they don&#39;t do it there anymore, but I think after 16 months I may have had a prolapse and I can&#39;t get in touch with anybody
</p>
<p>
Can you help as I need to get in touch with the aftercare team urgently
</p>
<p>
Thanks
