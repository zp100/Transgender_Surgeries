The S is important.  FFS results are not overnight.  My virtualFFS also showed hair transplants which take about a year to grow in.  And the curved hair line is a big gender marker that doesn&#39;t appear for again... months.
</p>
<p>
To answer you question.  Mine was pretty close.  In the final VirtualFFS photo more was &#34;done&#34; than I had done with FacialTeam so I don&#39;t look as good there.  They also ended up reducing my chin less than I was expecting so that wasn&#39;t as &#34;good&#34;.  So some parts of my face I look better, other parts I look worse.  But overall yeah really made me understand how the small subtle changes really can move how I am seen on the gender spectrum.

Did they over promise or what happened with the chin? I&#39;m still worried that they won&#39;t take enough off my bones even though the consultation was okay. I&#39;ve booked and now just constantly worrying.

The virtualFFS reduced the height by about 1cm.  During the pre-surgery consultation we wrote down .5cm from the CT scan.  Thus the results are less than what virtualFFS showed.  I discuss this in more detail in my full writeup
