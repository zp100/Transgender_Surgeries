3 days post op - you should be getting discharged today, yeah? Congrats and good luck on a speedy recovery. I&#39;m a McGinn girl also - a little over a year post op. If you have questions, let me know but honestly her staff is so attentive and responsive - you are in good hands!

congrats to you too friend! :-)
</p>
<p>
this is my first day out of the hospital. i have mostly been bothered by bladder pressure and general vaginal soreness - does getting the packing and catheter out help at all?

Yes. Getting those out... you can literally feel the pressure subside as the packing is coming out. It&#39;s  a nice relief. But then 2 minutes later comes your first dilation. It&#39;s different for everyone I presume but honestly it wasn&#39;t bad at all.

Are you staying at Gaia by any chance? That&#39;s where I stayed

Congratulations Hon‚ù£Ô∏è You are in very capable hands. How is the dysphoria now that you‚Äôve had the surgery? Inquiring minds want to know. Please do write up and share the details of your experience. The whole community benefits and the way for others to follow is better prepared and less scary when one knows what‚Äôs ahead‚ù£Ô∏èü§ós

actually right now my dysphoria is not the best. i‚Äôm a disheveled mess and haven‚Äôt been able to shave or do my makeup like normal. plus i have to stand up while peeing with my catheter (read: floppy penis thing). but i think it just had to get worse before it gets better - when i‚Äôm more capable/normal routine im sure i‚Äôll be euphoric :-)

i think surgeries resumed the last week of may and the first to be rescheduled are the first that were cancelled (april?). she has been doubling up on surgeries since to try and take care of everyone. i was concerned that mine would be cancelled in order to make room for covid reschedules but they left me on at my original date

that‚Äôs amazing news! i‚Äôm honored to pass the baton onto you
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
how is the pain
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
when you first wake up from general anesthesia, that‚Äôs all you have for pain, so it was like a 9/10 for the first half hour. but as soon as i was coherent enough to ask, they gave me a ton of fentanyl and it was better. after that, i have been a steady 3/10 pain thanks to patient controlled morphine. nurses were always checking pain level. the only times that i was above a 3 were when i got up to walk the first time in the hospital, and had my drains pulled out
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How much hair removal
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
none. i was terrified, poor, and of course affected by a pandemic. dr. mcginn doesn‚Äôt require it thankfully. but at this point it is hard to say whether or not hair will be an issue
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Why McGinn
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
first and foremost, she has proven to do great work aesthetically and functionally. she also has had an impressively clean record of major complications, stats which she tracks and discussed with me. wait time was the last main factor, which i was very pleased with - 4 months from first call to surgery

narcotics can make you very sleepy so if they start it before you‚Äôre awake you may never wake up. it‚Äôs just to make sure you‚Äôre ok. fwiw i hardly remember it since i was just waking up
</p>
<p>
we didn‚Äôt talk about it. or anything really quite frankly, i only spent a total of maybe 5 (waking) minutes with her the entire time i was in the hospital :-/
</p>
<p>
yes. no visitors, and mandatory covid testing at the hospital (not home) a few days before

yes unfortunately. surgeries on tuesday need to be tested the saturday morning prior. i had to make additional accommodations for us not only for those extra days pre-op but also for my surgery buddy while i was the hospital
</p>
<p>
if i wasn‚Äôt napping, i talked with my gf and friends on the phone. and nurses were in and out constantly, so i didn‚Äôt feel lonely at all actually!

If you don&#39;t mind, I would like to ask about this trans military list. I&#39;m a navy vet and have been looking at Dr.Mcginn. I saw something from a while back about her doing the surgery free for vets for a brief time but I didn&#39;t think that was still a thing. Would you mind telling me a little more about this list and how you got on it?

somehow i never bothered to ask about aesthetics. i know she posts results and many redditors do as well. but mcginn prides herself on tailored results to each patient, so i still had no idea what my vulva would look like because the extent of our conversation was ‚Äú6 inches seems reasonable‚Äù

I wonder how the pain after SRS compares with the pain during electrolysis cause I didn&#39;t do any anesthetic for hair removal. Yes, it&#39;s painful to cold sweat and tears.

thank u! yes very anxious. everyone kept asking ‚Äúomg aren‚Äôt you excited?!‚Äù but no, i just wanted to know that everything would be ok. i eventually calmed down went into it with neutral expectations and i think that was the best idea. no anxiety to hold me back, but also no grand vision of perfection to crush me

between the packing and the catheter there has been this constant drone of pressure in my vag and bladder. this was true even in the hospital where i didn‚Äôt have the valve. it‚Äôs not painful so you can try to ignore it but it is not pleasant. when you close it after peeing that uncomfortable pressure just comes back. although manageable i hate it and have been clawing for it to come out tomorrow morning (5 days post op)

Congrats!
</p>
<p>
How are beds at Capital Health? Or the pain is so awful, that the bed comfort is not an issue?
</p>
<p>
Where does one show up at the hospital for COVID testing? Main entrance?
</p>
<p>
What kind of pain? Sharp/blunt/shooting/etc.? Is it spread or very concentrated?
</p>
<p>
(I have very practical questions as I will be going through the same thing in days)

i personally didn‚Äôt find bed comfort to be a huge issue. maybe my butt got sore once or twice, but they get you walking around and keep blankets under you so it‚Äôs fine
</p>
<p>
yes go in the main entrance and just ask for pre-op admission testing (there were also signs)
</p>
<p>
when i walked for the first time, it was very sharp pain in my incisions. but other than that it has been a dull general pain in my vagina, well managed from the morphine, and some pressure in my bladder which was there for persistently until i got my catheter out
</p>
<p>
good luck! i‚Äôm here if i can help at all :-)

hmm i would say no but it didn‚Äôt end up being a problem. they check vitals and change your bed pad every two hours so i was routinely woken up. but the morphine made me very sleepy, so it would put me back out easily and also helped me nap during the day

I found that Benadryl helped. My pain level was not more than 3. The recovery was much much easier than I expected.
