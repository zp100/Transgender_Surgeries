Looks great! I am two days post op with Dr Celtik so not far behind you. Iâ€™m looking forward to the packing and catheter being removed. Iâ€™m being discharged today and plan to post some pics after my first post op on Tuesday. Good luck, girl!

CONGRATULATIONS! I hope your recovery goes super well! Good luck to you as well!
</p>

Finally getting the catheter out yesterday was soooo nice. By the end of the week, i was so over it and trying to conceal it every time i left my hotel room.

Iâ€™m scheduled in two weeks, and super stoked! These posts and stories emerging about Dr. Celtik are encouraging.

Best of luck to you!! Dr. Celtik was the best, very down to earth and genuinely cares. Also really enjoyed his PCC Valentina, she was really helpful and gave great advice.

I think he&#39;s going to have a very good career. I&#39;m very happy with him and i think a lot of other people will be too!

Min Jun left the Crane Center earlier this year and doesn&#39;t take my insurance at his new practice.
</p>
<p>
So i could have waited several years trying to get new insurance and getting put back on Min Juns 3+ year long wait list (which was actually closed last time i checked)
</p>
<p>
OR! I could go with Dr. Celtik and get the surgery on my original schedule. Which i had not planned on doing until he convinced me to trust him during the consult.
</p>
<p>
I guess another possibly was ditch both of them and waste a couple of years going back through the whole process to find another surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Min Jun is a consistently good surgeon, but having to wait MORE years for him... it would not have ended well for me.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Celtik is a fresh face to the scene, which is terrifying, but he is well trained, has a lot of experience participating in the surgeries, and seems to care a lot about his patients and their outcomes
