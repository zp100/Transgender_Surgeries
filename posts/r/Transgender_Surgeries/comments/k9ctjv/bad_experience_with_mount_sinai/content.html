Tried to set up a consultation with them for around a year and a half and eventually just gave up.  Twice I sent them the paperwork they requested, had my doctor send them the stuff they needed from him, was told they’d contact me with a consultation date, and never heard from them again.
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery with Dr. Bluebond-Langner six months ago and I couldn’t be happier with the care and results I received from her and her team.  They’re excellent at communicating too, they’re always quick to respond if I have a question or concern, and scheduling a consultation is easy.  I was able to schedule one the very same day I made the initial call.  Light years better than Mt. Sinai.
</p>
<p>
If you’re looking for a truly great surgeon, particularly in NY, go to NYU Langone and Dr. Bluebond-Langner.

I’m a man not a woman but I’ve had issues with mount sinai as well. Their communication is horrific it took me 3+ months to schedule a hysterectomy consultation. They said they would call back in 2 weeks, then wouldn’t so I’d call again, then I was exchanging emails with someone who suddenly stopped replying after promising they’d call me, then I called again and was told they didn’t even have any notes saying to call me at all in their system...just...such a mess
</p>
<p>
they never scheduled me in for a post op appointment despite saying they would. I had surgery two months ago and never was seen for post op and haven’t been able to get in contact with them since I left the hospital.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to send in a complaint once I gather documentation to show them proof. Thank you! They really need to get their act together

Yes please report it and make sure you let them know it’s The Transgender Surgery office of Mount Sinai! Their communication is HORRIBLE!

I don’t know about Bella much. I’ve met her and she’s a very nice doctor and I’ve seen her FFS and she’s good. I have no issues with her whatsoever but her partner Ting! That’s a whole different story!

From what I have read, she and possibly pang are the only people there worth a damn for us. I have read more than one Ting horror story. And I have ONLY seen beautiful positive experiences with Bella, Pang too, but that is less sure since I have seen little about him but what I have seen was positive. Takeaway: the hospital stuff can suck, but there are two exceptional surgeons there who are consistently producing beautiful results. I would venture to think that any reported complications from that hospital were on Ting.

Their communication sucks (it has been worse since covid)  but when I was at my consult everything was fine. And post consult things have been okay.

That is a fair concern. I am from out of state and have  to  stay a month after. And I am already looking for a local obgyn in my area with trans experience in the event something goes awry.

They actually called me to have me fly back for my 6month review and i turned them down immediately. Like I&#39;m not going to waste my time and money to go to a hospital that price gouged me to the extremely and didn&#39;t even have that good of results in the end. During my consult, Dr. Ting even sneered st me for a second because I nearly gaged at the pictures of obviously freshly done surgies. Like, how does that not turn someone&#39;s stomach just a bit and he wouldn&#39;t even show me pics of post op after healing.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, dont go there.

Do you think it&#39;s an issue with Ting or the hospital in general? Do you think things would have been different with Avanessian?

I went to him too. I looked at my insurance... Before insurance, him doing the surgery costed $144,533.00. If/when insurance goes through, I&#39;ll be paying my deductible and max out of pocket. So it&#39;s supposed to be ~$5,000. If it&#39;s billed out-of-network, I&#39;ll be paying $37,780.38. Keep in mind this doesn&#39;t include other services like getting knocked out, inpatient costs, use of the space (NY Eye and Ear) or a month of outpatient visits with Sangyoon (I never saw Ting after the surgery). So yeah, he is really expensive because it&#39;s considered private practice.

I honestly think its the hospital and surgeons. Blown up reputation and a flood of surgery requests that they cant keep up with. It all just leads to bad treatment and results.

My insurance wouldn&#39;t cover it because it was out of state 🤷‍♀️they had told me for 2 years that it wouldn&#39;t be anymore than 60k and then a week after surgery they tried to tack on 125k for each part of the surgery. I was thankfully able to get that revoked because it wasn&#39;t in any of the paperwork I read when I signed the agreement. They didnt fight it because I had a copy of the forms I signed and proved it wasnt there before.

Well I haven&#39;t even had my consult yet but I started communication then that same week had a consult scheduled along with those other two appointments for June 9th 2021. From my phone call they did say that you have to stay for the first month with a friend or family member. I have heard bella herself is very responsive after surgery. But I have heard some say communication with staff aside from the surgeons wasn&#39;t fun. And again haven&#39;t even gone yet! But everything went fairly smooth for me so far! I did just call the office and had my letters ready instead of email.

I just got on here for this my 1st post because I had seen some good PR about those 2 doctors and the integrated approach to Trans care and surgeries. I saw some nice ffs results by Dr Avanessian and hoped to get a consult. They set me up for a return call 2 weeks later for intake info.
</p>
<p>
They called back a day or 2 late and said &#34;Dr Avanessian is on sabatical&#34;

I guess from what everyone has said that maybe they were too busy with Covid to deal with any new people (and perhaps moreover from anyone from out of state). But why be so Rude and likely lying ? Why not be straightforward ?
</p>
<p>
Anyway ffs surgery itself may need to wait a bit anyway because of Covid, though I&#39;ve become a bit more fixated on getting it since because of the extra time to consider it again after more than 20 years since GRS w Meltzer when he was in Portland. I have a consult with Bowers in a few months to check my clitoral placement and other things that may either still be improved upon, or not.

They told you that recently? Isn&#39;t a sabbatical a year? I have a consult in June this freaks me out.

Yep, that was said to me about 2-3 weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
I am so sorry if I figuratively tossed a bomb into a bunch of nervous people.
</p>
<p>
Now that I have some time to think of it in the context of what several of you have said there must be a confused state of affairs there.
</p>
<p>
I have to think that the person who called me back regarding my intake may have been the lowest level, last hire and newbie there. She may not even know what a sabbatical means other than not making any more appointments for new potential patients due to the shifting sands of Covid-19.
</p>
<p>
I am myself a bit nervous here trying a bit like a newbie again to figure out surgeons, technique and availability.
</p>
<p>
I put away my disphoria after 1997-99 when I had my 100% minimum surgeries to my nethers and receding chin. After then I was just too busy with day-to-day until now 20 years later when Covid hit and all my disphoric desires to be more &#34;me&#34; in the rest my face came back.
</p>
<p>
I think I might call back for clarification, unless someone here has better information, which is what I was posting trying to ask any who might know more.
