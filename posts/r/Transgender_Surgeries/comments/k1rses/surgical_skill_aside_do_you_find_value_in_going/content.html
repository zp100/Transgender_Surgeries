Surgical skill aside, do you find value in going to a surgeon who is a trans woman?

Hey y’all!  So... I’m currently a PA working in surgery and have decided to go back to med school with the aim of doing gender affirming surgery. I am currently working in a pelvic surgery specialty (colorectal) and frequently find myself daydreaming how to refine current techniques for vaginoplasty... My dream is to spend my career perusing mastery and advancing this super important field of surgery. I hope that my future patients come to me because of my outcomes... but that said, do you personally find value in having ga surgeon who is trans?

I&#39;m sitting in hospital recovering from surgery with Dr Marci Bowers, I definitely have that little more faith in her since she&#39;s trans too. Whether I should or not idk, but I do!

I would love to have all my doctor&#39;s being trans because the know what you are going through and how to help you. It would be the best to have a surgeon that is trans because they can tell you what to expect with after care and recovery.

Dr. Ley is also transgender and it was very valuable in that when comparing notes on care, she was the first doc to suggest injectable meds and mention my wife’s initial doc was not cool. That was life saving for my wife.
</p>
<p>
I felt more comfortable with her as a transgender man, who got a meta with her because I knew she wasn’t a doc looking to cash in on full pay trans surgeries. I knew she was good for the community.

I’m a nurse who is trans who had GCS. The surgical team would be nice, but much more having nurses who are trans is helpful.
</p>
<p>
My surgeons were highly aware of me, and never made a misstep.
</p>
<p>
A CNA called me “he” and “him” to several folks including a PA until I had her stop, look at me, and I told her to use my pronouns of she and her from then on. She was embarrassed and avoided me after that.
</p>
<p>
We (nurses) are with you much more than any one MD. And fuck if more nurses understood our experience, we’d all be better off for it.

If all things were equal, I would choose a trans woman as every medical professional I ever interacted with. My therapist is trans, and my GP is a lesbian. It&#39;s made my life easier in many ways.

All my surgeons have been cis, but they were all caring and very focused on getting the best possible outcome for me. I don&#39;t think a trans surgeon could do anything more. I&#39;ve been very happy with all the results.
</p>
<p>
My electrolysis person is trans. She was several years ahead of me and with all the hours we spent together she was an excellent mentor through my transition.

I would certainly prefer someone who
<em>
gets it
</em>
. They&#39;ve got a stake in doing it right because they understand better than the vast majority of cis people how much that means to a patient getting that sort of procedure.
</p>
<p>
My second preference would be a woman who&#39;s had plastic surgery done [on herself, to clarify], and for all the same reasons.

Honestly I looked for a doctor who worked with the lgbt community and was passionate about helping their patients. My doctor was a cis gender man and I am pretty happy with my results. He also worked and pushed hard for my insurance to pay for my surgery which was a success. He was very patient with me too

Yes, but as others have already said, outcomes &gt; provider being trans. It&#39;s nice to know they have more insight into what you&#39;re going through. Similarly, I also prefer to go to a more attractive surgeon because aesthetics are important to me and I feel like if the surgeon knows how to make them self look good, that &#34;aesthetic eye&#34; will likely be useful in their surgery. I know some people will disagree with that, but that is how I think about it.

Indeed that&#39;s a value. Knowing for sure that the doctor actually wants to help trans people and isn&#39;t just in the job because they have to means a lot for my trust in that they take their responsibility seriously.

I think having someone, anyone, transgender to consult with for transgender surgeries sounds great. It would make the whole process less intimidating. Though, I care a lot more about the results or quality of the surgeon to the point where I&#39;ll prioritize other skillful surgeons even if there isn&#39;t any representation in their staff.
</p>
<p>
Though, I don&#39;t think this opinion is adverse to your dreams. I think as an inspiring surgeon and transwoman yourself you know that the quality of life and comfort after the surgery is more important than the quality of life and comfort during the surgical process. Doesn&#39;t mean the later isn&#39;t important.

Well I guess the social interaction aspect would slightly improve, but if you look at my post about Dr Schaff you&#39;ll get a sense of &#34;I don&#39;t need to be pals with them, they just need to do the job right.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Ultimately if a surgeon isn&#39;t the worst arsehole in the world I&#39;d just judge by the results they deliver. A surgeon doesn&#39;t need to make my hoohaa feel appreciated, they need to make it functional and anatomically correct. End of. 😝 A little incorrectness I can handle by use of my wit. But I can&#39;t fix my hooha by being witty.

Skill, experience and aesthetic sense are always primary. Would always prefer someone of the same gender. Certainly a supportive staff especially nurses who care for you are very important. Many of my trans women patients say they see me because I am and it makes them feel comfortable and they want referrals to trans or cis women. 🏳️‍⚧️😷

There&#39;s a huge mix of variables in deciding a surgeon: proximity, cost, ease of taking insurance, wait list, reputation, surgical skill, outcomes, admitting hospital (and their reputation), and the surgeon&#39;s personal history (plus many more factors I can&#39;t even think of at the moment). Some information is difficult to obtain (outcomes, including SSI, revisions, etc; surgical skill is subjective if you are unqualified to rate it).
</p>
<p>
All else being equal, I&#39;m happy to have a transwoman perform my surgery. But I rank proximity to my house, price/insurance, reputation, and admitting hospital as my top picks. Dr. Bowers will probably be my go-to.
</p>
<p>
If you put in the time and training to become a surgeon, you&#39;ll have no problems filling your calendar.

I know a trans woman who is a surgeon. After her coming out she seemed eager to specialize in FFS. Unfortunately she misgendered me on occasion and got a pretty difficult life full of problems. Maybe her skills will be good, but as a person her transness isn&#39;t a plus to me.

Being a trans surgeon or not is nice and all but it doesnt garantuee skill/craftmenship. It doesnt matter to me if my surgeon is a russian or neo nazi, aslong as their surgery results are at its finest in the world and competes with the best/top 🙏🏻 And if that amazing super surgeon would be trans that would be a pleasant bonus 🥰🌹

It wouldn&#39;t majorly impact my decision. Things like outcomes, complication rates, etc... Would and have been the main variables I care about. That being said it would probably be considered favorably all else being equal.

Congrats on you decision. I do think it would make a huge difference in our community simply because of the impact it has on our life.
</p>
<p>
I assume being part of the community,studying in that field and going as far as going stating that you want to advance the surgeries shows that you understand there is much improvement to me made. On all fronts. Results? Quality of the surgeries but also the care and respect surgeons put into it.
</p>
<p>
Which you the best of luck. And hope you achieve your goals.
</p>
<p>
If each of us that can make a difference to others do our best we will make the world better for us.
</p>
<p>
So let build it.

In no way. Skill and how you get along with them in your consults should be the desiding factors. Frankly for me personally if anything it would tend to be a negative in most situations but not all.
