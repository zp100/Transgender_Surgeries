I had a &#34;coronal&#34;  incision done on the very back of my head because I had simultaneous hair transplants done as well, and the back of my head was a better donor site. The incision was between the backs of my ears. It healed up absolutely perfectly. It&#39;s not visible at all in some places, and only a little line where it is visible. It&#39;s extremely easy to hide -- I don&#39;t think about it at all when doing my hair.

Mine pretty much starts right above one ear, passes over the very top of the head and ends where the other ear begins. So it is way up, far from the anterior hairline. I know you asked about scarring and I am only 1,5 month post op so I can&#39;t tell, it still has not healed (still have scabs and occasional pain).
</p>
<p>
I lost all hair along the incision with a width of about 0,5 cm (1/5th of an inch). My hair is dark which probably makes it more visible, as there is a weird contrast between the surrounding dark hair and a artificially straight line of hairloss, but it is not that difficult to hide. Because of a depressive crisis I cut my hair short a few days ago though, so now I kind of ruffle it along the incision so the hair covers it and it is not very visible. Another patient had the same experience with hairloss along the scar and had the hair grow back after about 4 months.

It is pretty bad actually, perhaps coronal incision was not the right choice for me. However, I suspect that I heal slower and worse than others. At 4 months I still have not healed with some scabbed wounds remaining and occasional pain. Worse, there is no hair regrowth whatsoever so far and I think I&#39;ve had some shock loss even of hair not adjacent to the incision but that may be from stress too. If you&#39;re considering it I think this is a YMMV situation with something that works wonders for some and not very well for others.

Oh no! I&#39;m sorry to hear that. I hope it eventually heals properly for you, 4 months may still be early for some people I guess. I think I read that some people can take a year or so for hair regrowth so fingers crossed! Did you contact the surgeon for advice?
</p>
<p>
What about the actual permanent scarring right now?

My coronal incision is not visible. I have lighter hair. Five years after the surgery I’m still slightly numb there. I’m glad I don’t have an incision at my hairline, because that would be visible if I pulled my hair back.

I have fine hair and my incision isn&#39;t super noticeable now after 7 months since surgery. It&#39;s more noticeable on one side since the stiches came undone and no one did anything about it for a day and a half. So I have a pretty big spot as a result of that.
</p>
<p>
I would say during the day i wouldn&#39;t notice it, but if my hair was wet or if it was really windy it would definitely be seen

Both. I&#39;ve had a little bit of hair growth back across most of the incision spot but not too much

Mine is just about visible through the bald patch on my crown. I wear my hair in a ponytail to hide it, but not going to lie I don&#39;t feel good about it.

Mine isn&#39;t visible, but I have thick blonde curly hair. It took some months to regrow around the incision though and I had to style my hair in an unflattering way to hide it until it grew back in.

I can’t speak from personal experience, but unless scarring is different  between forehead and coronal I’d think it’s best to get it where it’s less visible. Perhaps if wouldn’t matter, but if I did get bad scarring I think across the forehead would have to be a lot worse.
