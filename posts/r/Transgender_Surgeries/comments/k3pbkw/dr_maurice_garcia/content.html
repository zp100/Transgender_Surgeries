Here is something new I just learned the hard way about him, OK, not exactly him but about Dr. Ellenhorn. Dr. Ellenhorn is a GI doctor who does the colon part of the surgery, if you are having a colon vaginoplasty. He requires half of the estimated out of pocket cost for the surgery. In my case it was estimated that my out of pocket expense for me surgery would had been 3,000 dollars. They wanted 1,500 dollars upfront. I donkt have the money so I had to cancel his side of the surgery and just do Dr. Garcia&#39;s part, which is the external (labioplasty) part. I&#39;ve had 16 surgeries in my lifetime, excpet for four I&#39;ve never been asked to put money upfront. And the four I had to pay upfront was because I was paying 100% put of pocket (No insurance involved).
</p>
<p>
Just wanted to put this out there in case your insurance is paying for it. Unless you are covered 100%, they will expect an upfront payment. Again, this is only if you are having a colon vaginoplasty. AND, Dr. Garcia is not asking my for money upfront, only the specialist that does the colon part of the surgery. Just wanted to make that very clear.

I had a consultation with Dr. Garcia in July 2019. I had to wait about 5 months just to see him. I was told that he has a long long waiting list for surgeries.  So keep that in mind. My surgery is scheduled for about a week from now. So I can not comment on results, pus I am intersex and not trans, so my case and anatomy is different the MTF transsexuals. But my experience so far with him has been positive. I&#39;ve had some issues with the girls in his office, so make sure you stay on top of them if you have any questions or concerns. One thing I like about him is that he has called me personally to answer some of my questions, which I liked.
</p>
<p>
There is a website called Laura&#39;s Place, which is a trans website. Some said that they had heard good things about him. And one transwoman there posted some comments before and after her surgery with him, she said that she was happy with the results And highly recommended him. But, there was one complaint. Some Transwoman stated that she was having post operative problems and he would not answer her call requests, and when he did he gave her the cold shoulder. But everyone else said he was really good.
</p>

I think that if you look hard enough you will always find good and negative commends about any doctor. I have heard great things about Marcy Bowers (something like that) in Colorado. Supposedly she is trans herself. When I send her an e-mail she was uninformative and it felt to me like she didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass. Perhaps she doesn&#39;t like intersex people or she is, like most doctors, very ignorant about intersex conditions and have no idea of how to go about treating us.
</p>

Doctor Garcia so far has been very nice to me. Has taken the type to explain things and sounds like a sweetheart. But being nice doesn&#39;t mean good results. To me he sound knowledgeable, carrying, and like he is very confident but arrogant in his skills.

DONT DO IT, hes a total butcher. he makes the most horrific looking vaginas, i was a victim of his and every trans girl i know has had horrible botched surgeries. Having srs with him was the worst decision ive ever made. I have a botched vagina, i can not have sex, i pretty much cant date anymore and ill probly die alone. IF ANYONE is thinking of going to dr maurice garcia DO NOT DO IT. theres little info about him because the girls are too embarrassed to come forward. He a total butcher...he has never made a SINGLE normal looking functioning vagina...hes also a narcissist and THE SECOND you speak up about the problems YOU WILL HAVE he cuts you off as a patient and you will have no one to go to. I had to go to the ER for all of my post surgery appointments. Horrible monster of a person, completely incompetent borderline evil surgeon. The most pain i have felt in my life, was suicidal becuase the pain was ao unimaginable I literally didnt think I could continue,  I know people will still go to him because he takes insurance but you are making a HUGE mistake. The science IS NOT where they tell you it is. you WILL NOT have a &#34;vagina&#34; I will live the rest of my life regretting this and now because i cant have sex and my privates are mangled Ill most likely never have a partner again. DONT DO IT. The pics he shows you IS NOT HIS work. He is an evil man and has butchered hundreds if not thousand of gils at this point. When he was in SF before he ran off to LA he was still pumping out as many surgeries as he could KNOWING he was leaving and there was NO ONE TO TAKE OVER FOR HIM, leaving all of those girls with no after care. He is a horrible soulless garbage human that one day will get his karma.

I am so sorry for your experience that’s truly awful. I didn’t see this until now. Are you willing to talk privately?

He used to work out of UCSF.  I had the necessary pre-op appointments with him, but he retired to move on to his current venture in SoCal before I could get a date.  He seemed fine though.
