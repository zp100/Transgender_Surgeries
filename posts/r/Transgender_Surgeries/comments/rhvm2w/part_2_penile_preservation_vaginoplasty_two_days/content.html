</p>
<p>
First day post-op:
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m doing pretty well, not much pain (I was expecting a lot more). I also walked around the hospital floor earlier today, which apparently is more than most people do at first. I&#39;ve got some neat calf massager things to prevent clots while I&#39;m still in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
The walking was really nice after all this lying down, but I was definitely feeling more pain afterwards. It&#39;s subsided though. I think getting in or out of bed puts strain on the stitches, and that&#39;s where the pain is coming from.
</p>
<p>
If I manage to get up and walk around three times today, I can restart my estrogen at the full dose.
</p>
<p>
Second day post-op:
</p>
<p>
I was discharged from the hospital yesterday, and made it home to the Airbnb in a cab. The donut pillow helped a lot. I got into bed immediately and watched some TV with my partner before deciding to take a nap around 4pm. I did not wake up until around 2am.
</p>
<p>
I was able to get up out of bed to change my ice packs on my own, a total of three times. I&#39;m lying in bed right now waiting for my partner to get us both breakfast.
</p>

Thanks for your interest! I&#39;ll definitely be posting more updates over the coming weeks. Next big step will be to take the wound vac and packing off so I can start dilating, but I&#39;ll still need the catheter in for another week because of where Dr Wittenberg needed to put things (closer to my bladder apparently, I didn&#39;t quite follow).
</p>
<p>
So far the healing is going quite well, and there&#39;s not much pain.

Thanks, I really appreciate hearing from someone who has already had the procedure. I&#39;m nonbinary AMAB, who wants to present as male. This is really perfect for me. I was going to go with a vaginoplasty but the penis preservation is a better option. Glad to hear your feeling better. Have a nice holiday with your partner,  Hugs!!

You can find some more info on the wiki associated with this subreddit, and also on
<a href="/r/salmacian" rel="nofollow">r/salmacian</a>
.  I&#39;m open to questions as someone who&#39;s post op as well.

Just fyi, in a url you can generally remove the ? and everything past it. Its usually tracking codes. This is sufficient

Sounds like your recovery is going well so far. I&#39;m always amazed reading about how quickly folks progress with the peritoneal technique as opposed to the original skin graft method my experience was with.

I imagine the swelling just hasn&#39;t started yet, but the healing does seem to be going well so far at least!
</p>
<p>
This is also a specific peritoneal technique that leaves the peritoneal tissue attached to its original blood supply, rather than harvesting and grafting (like Dr Avanessian does). I think this also contributes to faster healing and lower complication rate.

Yep, I&#39;m familiar with the technique. I did a bunch of research on it back when I was originally going to go for a plain vaginoplasty, and then when I went for the PPV instead the peritoneal methods were not yet offered by any surgeon for PPV so I didn&#39;t have it done myself.
</p>
<p>
As far as I am aware the 4th or 5th (not sure which number they were) PPV recipient had a form of that peritoneal technique done, and it&#39;s been getting refined since. Your recovery is likely to be quite quick, barring any complications.

Ah, glad you&#39;re already familiar. Dr Avanessian offered a different method that involved a peritoneal graft (that does get removed from the blood supply for a while) so I figured I&#39;d be specific.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad to hear it sounds like recovery will be quick!
