How much was the cost overall in usd? And what&#39;s the after-care like? Do you have an interpreter too? And how long are you staying for recovery before returning home ✌️

<p>
the costs for the surgery were 16000$ plus the flight there and an airbnb for a month
</p>
<p>
the after care so far has been really easy, i thought i would be in pain and suffering a lot, but tbh it has been nothing compared to srs and ba. the first day i was in hospital basicly just lying there, sleeping most of the time. i couldnt stay awake for long. i felt like i got whatever medics i wanted before and after surgery and could openly talk about it.  In hospital i had a bedside interpreter, that was there all the time. since i got back to my airbnb, Amanda, the awesome patient coordinator, came by once a day, checking in and was always reachable, in case i needed anything.  I am staying in buenos aires for a month. arrived one week before surgery to get to know the city and feel more comfortable here. am staying 3 weeks after surgery. I think if you are on a tight time schedule, you could arrive a few days before surgery and leave two weaks after. I just prefer a slower approach, to able to process everything, that is happening

Goodluck on your recovery! I had mine with him back in August and I am very happy. Amanda, Dr. Rossi and translator are all super kind.

Yes, I dont have numbness at all(just a bit of chin muscles are just a slight harder to move but no loss of movement) . Everything slowly recovers although it feels super numb. Only numbness left is on my scalp but I believe its because of the skin being strechted. I was told its normal and it will too recover as the other numb parts. P.s. I did the same procedures done except blapheroplasty but with hairline correction, upper lip lift and tracheal shave

the experience has been excelent so far. buenos aires is great and i felt super safe here, just wish my spanish would be better.  recovery for me doesnt seem super challenging, i expected it do be far worse, but that could also be because, although i had full ffs, i was already passing before and only needed smaller changes

Considering him, what made you choose him out of all other FFS suregons? My main concern with him is the fact he doesnt do CT scans, also some complain about his rhino work....

i chose him, because a friend of mine went with him and is really happy about the results and how everything went. The communication with amanda also played a big part in my decision. Originally i wanted to go with facial team, as everything around them is sooooo fancy and i love their marketing. Would definitely recommend a consultation with them, no matter if you choose them, or not. After i was in marbella for the consultation, i realized that i would never have the money to afford going with them (47000€ at the time, now probably a lot more). to my own surprise i inherited just enough money for going with t-change mid last year. so i would say, price also played a big role in why i chose them.
</p>
<p>
I was worried about them not doing CT scans too, as i found the 3d printed cutting guides ft uses for the jaw very futuristic and nice. i guess the ct scans make presurgical planing a lot easier and the outcome more predictable.  I feel like using x-rays also works, but is less precise in presurgical planing.
</p>
<p>
I was also concerned about the nose, but not because i heard about complaints, but more because i feel like noses are something were taste really really differs. In the end i just went with a super subtile change, just to correct the angle on the bridge, so that it fits the forehead. Still have the cast on, so i actually dont know how it really looks underneath. From what i can see now (which probably isnt a lot 4 days post op, with the cast on) it looks hella cute

Oh god, this mirrors so much of my experience!! I JUST had a second video consultation with FT, and while i LOVED everything about it, it simply seems out of my reach, financial wise. I could scrap it, but it takes almost all of my transition budget. Which really sucks, but that is how life is. So i am considering Rossi or Cardenas.
</p>
<p>
Was Cardenas every in play for you?

i was trying to safe up more for facial team, but their prices just kept on rising. I&#39;m in my mid thirties now and was afraid, that if i would be able to get together the money at some distant point in my life, i would&#39;ve been older, probably need more procedures, have a slower recovery and wirse wound healing. but maybe thats just me being dramatic and really wanting to look even cuter.
</p>
<p>
i thought about cardenas too and liked the thought of being in a recovery house with a bunch of other gurls. thats something i really liked about grs. i didnt go with him, because i didnt know anyone personally that went with him and because forehead was my main focus and rossi seems to ve more &#34;aggressive&#34; with that.  I heard Cardenas is really good at soft tissue work.
</p>
<p>
Somethig else i didnt pay enough attention to is, that its actually almost never only one surgeon performing the surgery, but a whole team.

Swelling is gone, but I have some sagging around my jawline now due to excess skin after so much bone was removed. Considering a facelift now to fix that. Might also just be aging, my 20s are now behind me lol. But it&#39;s a common side effect of FFS, so be aware that you might have to fix it down the line.
</p>
<p>
My nerve damage receded by 95%, dunno whether the last 5 will leave as well. It&#39;s so minimal though that I really don&#39;t mind. Some extremely minimal numbness around one temple, and feeling sensations in two spots at once when I scratch my scalp or chin.
</p>
<p>
My only negative experience was that Rossi said he used dissolvable oral sutures, but I had to get them removed at home because he apparently mixed them up or something and they didn&#39;t budge. My dentist explicitly said that they weren&#39;t dissolvable ones.
