Did forehead, rhyno and simultaneous hair transplant.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s the neutral pre/post op photos taken at the clinic. They&#39;re taken 1 week after surgery so even if my face doesn&#39;t look bruised it&#39;s still swollen, specially the nose and I still had an air pocket on the right side of my face:

I&#39;m Spanish so I didn&#39;t have to deal with any international travel.

It takes a while for final results, at the clinic they said it can take something like up to a year I think for the swelling to completely go down. Also I can&#39;t tame my eyebrows for like 6 weeks and I really want to üòÅ.
</p>
<p>
The hair transplants fall out about a month after the surgery and take about a year to fully grow back in.
</p>
<p>
Of course wearing your hair right makes a huge difference by itself, even pre ffs me was male failing semi frequently without my hair pulled back like that.

Gracias!  üòä
</p>
<p>
The first time I contacted facial team was on late June. I had to fill an internet form and send them some neutral pictures of my face at different angles with the hair pulled back kind of like the ones on this post and tell them what I wanted changed about my face.
</p>
<p>
After this they sent me the date for an internet consultation with one of the surgeons, which was about a month later.
</p>
<p>
After that they asked me about my preferred month for surgery and I said December, so it probably would have been possible to get it earlier if I&#39;d wanted to, but it was about 5 months total for me.

Hola querida, the pics are not available anymore, any chance to upload them again? I had a consultation with them last week in Marbella and I‚Äôm basically going to do the same you did so I‚Äôm very eager to see all their works! :) Where have you had your coronal incision? I know it‚Äôs too early to give feedback on the scar but which are your first impressions? And about the transplant, at the moment you can‚Äôt see any result right? I‚Äôm doubtful about this because they proposed me to do it at the two small upper corners of my hairline (where I never had hair) and it would be a slightly noticeable improvement but at a huge cost... Muchas gracias!

How do you know it&#39;s an air pocket, and not swelling?

Well, if I pressed on it on the edges you could kind of feel the skin coming together with the skull. Also the doctors told me but it&#39;s pretty obvious it&#39;s not swelling if you have it.
</p>
<p>
It didn&#39;t really hurt or anything it was just kind of gross. It slowly deflated by itself and by now it&#39;s almost completely gone.
