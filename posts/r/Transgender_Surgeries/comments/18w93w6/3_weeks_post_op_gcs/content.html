I had PI GCS three weeks ago. I was told they were able to get me 16cm of depth. When they went to show me how to dilate with the PT we could only get to 9-10cm. They told me I must be swollen and to stay on top of dilating. After two weeks of dilating I can still only get to 10cm of depth. They say everything looks good and to keep up with everything Iâ€™m doing. Obviously they wouldnâ€™t tell me Iâ€™ve lost that depth and itâ€™s not coming back.
</p>
<p>
How long into dilating should I be when I start to worry that the depth is gone forever? Do you think the depth canâ€™t be hit because of swelling still? Iâ€™m holding the dilator in and applying lots of pressure. Iâ€™m dilating for longer periods of time than they tell me to. Still 10cm. Is it gone? Was it gone before I even got to dilate? Has this happened to anyone else?

If you&#39;re not happy about your depth in a year after the initial surgery, you could consider a revision such as PPT or colon.

Itâ€™s not clear you ever had that depth. Iâ€™d contact your surgeon immediately. Who was it and have they said anything about it?
</p>
<p>
Thereâ€™s some info in the wiki on dilation.

You MUST use a web browser to view those. DO NOT use a reddit app or you wonâ€™t see all of it.

When the PT found I was only at 9-10cm she contacted the surgeon and the surgeon took a look down there and did an exam and said she thinks itâ€™s still really swollen and to keep dilating. That was two weeks ago. Either swelling hasnâ€™t gone down or gaining depth is impossible.
