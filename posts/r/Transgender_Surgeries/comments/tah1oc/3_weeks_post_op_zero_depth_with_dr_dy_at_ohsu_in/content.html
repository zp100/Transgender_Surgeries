I&#39;ve got a little bit of wound separation going on that I&#39;m doing dressing changes to address. I wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted to post pictures or not, but I know results from Dr Dy are very hard to come by and thought this might be a useful contribution to the community, so I settled on posting them from a throwaway.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to field questions about Dr Dy specifically, zero depth in general, and OHSU in general.

Thank you SO much for sharing! You are right about information on her being hard to come by. Did she do the whole procedure or was Dr Peters involved?

As far as I know she did the whole procedure. I have only met Dr Peters in the context of my top surgery.

I had vulvoplasty with Dr. Dugi which looks nothing like this. üòîüò£I can only imagine how much better Dr. Dy‚Äôs robotic vaginoplasty surgery will be. üòç
</p>
<p>
Dr. Dugi‚Äôs vulvoplasty October 2019, Covid Pandemic arrived March 2020. Had know idea this would happen in those short few months from having surgery to that Covid pandemic. üò£
</p>
<p>
Had an scheduled appointment with Dr. Dy, but it was last minute cancelled and couldn‚Äôt even fly up to meet with her. Live here on O‚Äôahu in Hawai‚Äôi .

I hope you are happy with your results! I&#39;ve never met Dr Dugi. I&#39;m lucky enough to live in Portland so I was able to just be patient and wait for and appointment with Dr Dy. I may get depth added via her robotic PPT in a second surgery. Undecided yet.

I‚Äôm happy, but it‚Äôs not what I fully wanted. I wanted a vaginal canal as well. I comprised with my past work place cause they wanted me back to work as soon as I could come back and the time needed to heal for the surgery. I am grateful for having my vulvoplasty, but there is a lot of limitations and barriers because I can‚Äôt have sex the way normal cisgender can. Not able to insert a dildo or be penetrated by a rubber penis or double dildos. An just having sex in the behind isn‚Äôt so pleasurable. An even if I tell my new partner I had my srs surgery, it‚Äôs not like they going to understand and then knowing what to do next reaction wise if they get aggressive towards you if they disagree or don‚Äôt like the fact I had surgery in where they can‚Äôt penetrate my new vulva not vagina. Because of the unknowing of the pandemic sneaked/creeped in three months after I got back to work from surgery. Had I known this, I would have just did the full SRS surgery. Except use other skin than my old penile skin cause even if the skin was being flipped inwards, it‚Äôs still too dark - the skin area being used for the vaginoplasty for my liking. So I‚Äôm thankful they discarded it.
