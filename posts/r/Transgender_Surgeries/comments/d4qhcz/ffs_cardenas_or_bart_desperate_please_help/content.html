Hey y’all, so I had my chin and jaw contouring w Bart last year and I’m super happy w the outcome, he was super aggressive and took out the bone I wanted. Due to economic stuff I wasn’t able to have the upper face done (hello bangs) but now I have the resources to have it done. Right now I’m super disphoric about my forehead, even tho I live as a stealth woman and being almost unclockable, I live in depression most of the time. The big question is: Bart or Cardenas? I had price quote from both: Bart: type 3 forehead rhino upper lip lift 18k Cardenas: same procedures 12k  Now, 6k for me are a huge difference but I don’t want to be cheap w my face.  I know how Bart works having done an amazing type 3 on my best friend and I love how aggressive he is. I have a really masculine forehead so I don’t know if Cardenas could handle it.  Is there someone who had surgery w Cardenas or Bart? I really don’t know who to choose, the both seem great but would be nice so save some money.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the grammar lol

Van De Ven is better at bone work (forehead reconstruction) but Cardenas is better at the soft tissue stuff (rhinoplasty, lip lift, hairline lowering). Van De Ven in particular seems to be really bad at hairline lowering for some reason and his noses can be hit or miss. He also favors really high brow lifts which can look unnatural on a lot of his patients.

Yeah I’ve heard about the soft tissue problem and the brows lift. Cardenas don’t seem that much aggressive w bone work. I guess I’ll stick up w Bart

I would say van de Ven, but I’m biased because I went with Cardenas and am mad he was not more aggressive.

It&#39;s difficult to choose even if you saw one of them, because you still can&#39;t compare :P
</p>
<p>
I went to Dr. Bart for Type 3, and I can&#39;t really comment on Dr. Cardenas, because I didn&#39;t hire him.
</p>
<p>
The only things I can comment on is how my own face turned out:
</p>
<p>
- I am satisfied with the results, and generally pass. I feel like my face passes better than my voice and body, and those two aren&#39;t bad either.
</p>
<p>
- people mention hairline lowering: mine was lowered enough that I no longer use makeup to hide it, and can do a ponytail and still pass.
</p>
<p>
- people mention the doctor&#39;s personality: in my meetings, Dr. Bart was a quiet, polite guy. Some people interpret that as being cold? I think people are used to doctors with a car salesman personality (big smiles and reassurances), while Dr. Bart reads more like a dad. What mattered more to me was that he listened to my concerns, didn&#39;t upsell me, and would honestly tell me if he thought some procedure was a bad idea. I don&#39;t want my surgeon to hugbox me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Edit:
</strong>
what made me
<em>
decide
</em>
on this surgeon? Back when I was interviewing other surgeons, a year prior to my ffs, he had examples of before- and after- photos that
<em>
most closely resembled people with my face type
</em>
. It looked like he could take someone of my age and reliably make them look female. So it reassured me that he would know what to do with my particular face. So look for surgery examples that match your face.

I choose Bart for the jaw and chin because he did well on my face type. Also the forehead a couple of girls on the before after pic had my same exact forehead and he did an AMAZING job on them. The main problem is money and if Cardenas can do the same result w lower cost would be great. But I guess I can’t be cheap w the only face I got and Bart told me he has to finish my face cause he started. Sound pretty right for me.  As for u, how was the scarring? The healing? How much time u had to wait till look normal again?
</p>
<p>
Edit: about personality I don’t get why people label Bart as rude. He is not. W me he was very kind and professional and even did a revision for free and did lipofilling for free. He didn’t sell me anything and willing to listen to everything was my concern.

My appearance recovered quicker than I expected. Looking back at my photos, I had some significant puffiness for 1-2 months, but realistically, people couldn&#39;t tell I had surgery after like 4 weeks.
</p>
<p>
The scars were pink for a while, but they were well hidden. Post-op care matters. Dr. Bart asked me to wash my hair every day and gently massage the scabs so they don&#39;t crust over too long. Turns out he was right: there were a few spots where I let the scabs a little too long, and when they eventually came out, they removed some hairs. Those spots are a bit more exposed than the rest of the hairline. Overall though, I had decent hair regrowth around the hairline scar.
</p>
<p>
1.5y later, people can&#39;t see where my surgery happened unless I point it out closely.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and he put in devices called &#39;endotines&#39; under my scalp, those were freaky. Google them - they&#39;re little plastic tabs that keep your skin in place. They felt like little bumps under the hairline, but you couldn&#39;t see them. They dissolved after 1+ year.

Noorman van der Dussen is also in Antwerpen and does good work for a cheaper price (at least with the quotes I got and what I paid). I&#39;m not quite sure what aggressive or not means as the doctors should be bringing the forehead to the correct proportional distance based on angle and face shape. I would be kinda concerned with a doctor that will just randomly take of an amount of bone. Especially with type 3 the surgeon should be making very precise measurements on the amount of bone removed and how it is reshaped.
</p>
<p>
From my experience Dr. Dussen is also much more realistic and immensely nicer/warmer than Dr. Bart is.

I’m met him too and loved how he understood my face. But lacking feedback online makes me question his work a lot.  I met all 3... Noorman, Bart, facial team, And Noorman was my most favorite.
</p>
<p>
How would you rate your experience with him? I’m doing forehead, chin, nose, jaw, hairline correction.

I was also looking between these two surgeons and was wondering this myself. Aesthetically they are both great. I know it’s not any help for your question but I do hope someone replies to you.

I really like Bart’s before and afters that are available online. The only thing that makes me hesitant is I keep hearing about his poor hairline work. Also, I wish I could see more of his rhinoplasty work.

<p>
It depends on how how much advancement you actually need. If your hairline is already fine then it shouldn&#39;t be a concern.
</p>
<p>
The issue with Bart is not scarring (his scars are usually nigh-invisible after a few months), its the lack of advancement. He averages around half a centimeter of advancement when the average for this procedure is typically 2-3 cms with normal scalp laxity, which means all his patients either have poor scalp laxity (unlikely) or he&#39;s just overly conservative with it.
</p>
<p>
So if you have a really high hairline you&#39;ll probably need another scalp advancement with a different surgeon.

Thank you for this information, it definitely brings some clarity. Do you have any knowledge on his rhinoplasty work?

Once again it depends a lot on your starting point. For people with noses who just need a small tweak to the shape &amp; contour he does fine, but for patients who need a significant size reduction his results often aren&#39;t dramatic enough.

I had forehead work with FT and will be having chin, rhino and other soft tissue work with Cardenas later this month. I chose him because of the cost and also because I heard that his wife does amazing noses.
