Thanks for the update!  Gupta is one I&#39;m considering, and made aware of thanks to your previous post.

He&#39;s really caring! Even with the tear I&#39;d go back again.

That&#39;s amazing how well you maintained everything without the need for additional surgery. There are a lot of people that would benefit from understanding whatever process you undertook to get past the original wound dehiscence. The only thing I would worry about is granulation at this point.

<p>
It looks terrific.

Lots and lots and lots of dressing changes lots of cleaning it. Surgeon recommended manuka honey to dress it with in-between. Saline water at night.

Also I&#39;d like to note we took a dialating session away so just twice a day to help with irritation since dialating has gone well. I still have an uphill battle but I&#39;m taking it day by day!

Ya, it was a tough one for me too. I know exactly what you&#39;re going through. My surgeon was of little help and it got to the point at about 5 months and it was a living hell. Dilation was complete torture. I had to drop down to a small dilator and just try to keep the depth, while I lost a lot of girth while it healed. It was my physical therapist that got me through it, but at a very high cost in terms of recovery. Healing by second intention is nothing to take lightly. It just drags on and on and sucks all the life out of you if it goes bad. Lol. Not to scare you or anything. Yours looks good so far.
