Iâ€™m in Miami girl and recently Iâ€™ve gone throughout the research for breast augmentation since I as of this month have an active insurance policy with Starbucks and it brought me to a guy called dr rÃ­an maercks for BA, anyone work with him before or heard of him? Also any recommendations on BA in Miami

Starbucks insurance is great, thatâ€™s how I got mine. Go over the muscle because what they donâ€™t tell you is your muscles will never exactly work or look the same ever again. Implants have to be replaced every 10 or so years and eventually youâ€™ll possibly want them out.

Oofa, thank you so much for the info! Do you know if there is a good list of all the FL surgeons outside of the one on this sub? I think the wiki is missing quite a few

The only hesitation I have is that my insurance will pay for everything in network, but he is out of network for all insurance ðŸ˜­ so it will cost us a lot of $.

Do you have any suggestions for BA or body sculpting? Dr.M&#39;s office said he only does facial.

I had a rhinoplasty, Breast lift with implant &amp; fat transfer with Little to no complications. I work for Starbucks so they paid for the surgery. I would recommend him, heâ€™s super friendly &amp; his staff is great. There were somethingâ€™s I had thoughts about but overall Iâ€™m happy.
