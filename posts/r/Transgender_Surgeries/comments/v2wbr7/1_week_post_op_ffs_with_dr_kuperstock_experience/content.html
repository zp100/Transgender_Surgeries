I just had my 1 week Post Op appointment with Dr. Kuperstock, and even still being a swollen mess, I&#39;m just over the moon with the changes so far.
</p>
<p>
Some backstory:
</p>
<p>
I began transition decades ago as a teen, and back then part of me wanted FFS, but between my finances (I was about to begin college) and I wasn&#39;t too impressed with results from the surgeons I knew of, I put it off and made excuses for myself. Fast-forward to last year when I heard my employer was changing Health Insurance Providers. I looked into it and found out the new provider covered FFS, so I started doing research. Thanks to this sub, I went through in-Network surgeons and the name/images that kept sticking out to me was Dr Kuperstock. I contacted his office and had a virtual consultation shortly after Thanksgiving. Afterwards, I went through his office for the estimate and what what be expected to get it approved by insurance. I need 2 letters: One from my HRT provider, thankfully is my PCP and one of the best physicians I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure to see (For a long time I self medicated after a series of terrible experiences with PCP&#39;s and local Endo&#39;s.). She had my letter done mid-December, but I had a lot of difficulty finding a Psychiatrist to write my 2nd one since I haven&#39;t seen one in years. My PCP was kind enough to pull some strings and get me in virtually with a local colleague of hers that wasn&#39;t necessarily taking new patients. After a series of sessions over about a month we agreed on the letter, but due to mishaps, I didn&#39;t get a physical copy til the beggining of March. As soon as I had everything, I sent it off to Dr Kuperstock&#39;s office and they began the submission. I received a letter from insurance with an initial approval the last week of March, but Dr. Kuperstock&#39;s office let me know that they missed a few things and we would still need to wait for a letter of agreement, which I was told would likely take months. However, a little after the middle of April, I got an e-mail from Dr. Kuperstock that they&#39;d obtained the letter of agreement, and after a call with his surgery coordinator, I now had a Surgery date of May 25th!
</p>
<p>
Not expected surgery so soon, I scrambled to get everything in place. I had my pre-op, surgery date and post-op appointments, so I started making flight/hotel arrangements. It was highly impressed upon me by both people I began to seek advice from and Dr Kuperstock&#39;s office that YOU NEED someone to be with you that first week. Thankfully my mom made the trip to take care of me.
</p>
<p>
Even with my nerves through the roof, the Pre-Op appointment really put me at ease that I chose wisely. Dr Kuperstock went with me top to bottom through each of the procedures and we discussed for each in detail the possible incisions along with risk/benefits of each. After making decisions, he went back through each along with the chosen incision, to make sure he had it right, and then I was off to pick up medications next door at Walgreens. (The office tried to get me my meds before I left California, but for some reason they never got the requests, so I had to get them the day of the Pre-Op.)
</p>
<p>
My mom got to Virgina the night before surgery and I went through the procedure and every indication I had so far with her. The morning of surgery, we went to the hospital and within a few minutes we&#39;re taken back for Pre-Op. I changed, then the Pre-Op nurse made sure I was comfy as the hospital administrator went over paperwork. Then the Pre-Op nurse got my IV ready (I always fear this because my veins are a mess, but she got it easily) and the anesthesiologist and her assistance came in to introduce themselves and go over the procedure. I started getting some fluids and that&#39;s when Dr. Kuperstock came in. He was so jubial, that even with the nerves, my spirit went through the roof. He then went through all the procedures again with my and my mom, once more detailing what types of incision we&#39;d chosen for each and the reason for doing so. Then he goes through them all one more time in more of a checklist manner, as I&#39;m signing the approval paperwork. After he left, my mom immediately told me she thought he was one of the nicest doctors she&#39;d ever meet, and I was like &#34;told ya!&#34;. Shortly after that my mom took most of my stuff, said her goodbyes and off I went. The OR was AMAZING! The few minutes I could see it, I was in awe. I don&#39;t even remember feeling particularly sleepy, but I was out pretty darn quick. When I woke up, first thing I noticed is I couldn&#39;t talk. Most of the incisions were in my mouth and I was pretty swollen, so I had to get peoples attention with hand signs. I remember the pain being like the worst migraine I&#39;ve ever had. They did have to give me some painkillers before I was sent off to my room. I stayed the night. My mom got there shortly thereafter, but I wasn&#39;t interested in anything. Between the pain and the 45 degree elevation, I just wanted to close my eyes and pray for sleep. My mom ordered some food for me before she left, but I had zero appetite. I even kept getting told to use the restroom when I needed to but I just couldn&#39;t picture getting up. In the middle of the night, I was finally given (a rather kind) ultimatum that I had to use the restroom myself or they might need to use a catheter, so with some help, I used the restroom. I didn&#39;t get much sleep for the first half of the night. I kept having very short sleep periods filled with hallucinations and would be woken in fear. When I told the nurse, she thought it might be oxycodone related, so she switched me to acetominophen. After that, I got about 4 hours sleep in 2 sections of 2 hours. I forced myself to eat some ice cream around 6am. Close to 6:45am, Dr Kuperstock showed up. First he took the wraps off. Checked the sutures and the incisions inside my mouth. Then he recorded a video with me so I and my mom would have reference for wound cleaning and rebandaging of the ace wraps. Shortly thereafter my mom got there and she was such an amazing advocate for me. She made sure my breakfast was ordered and then talked to the nurse about how long I could stay because she wanted me to be able to get some more rest. All the staff, nurses and otherwise, were all amazing and top notch. My mom was impressed the hospital was as empty as it was. I was staying in the Women&#39;s Surgical Center section. We finally left around 4pm. My nurse wheeled me down and said he goodbyes and back to the hotel it was.
</p>
<p>
Once again, that first week, I could barely do anything myself. My mom was great enough to go out every morning to the local supermarket and get water/food. She even made it a point to bring me a Wendy&#39;s Frosty everyday because it felt SOOOOO GOOOOD!!! The first 2-3 days, as the swelling got worse, most of my pain was on my head. Like a horrible migraine. My mom cleaned the incisions on a daily basis, and helped me wash my hair (no way could I have done it by myself since I had a nose cast I couldn&#39;t get wet). She really pushed me to get a ton of rest and walk a little bit around the hotel as she helped me once a day. Around day 4, the worst pain started to come from inside my mouth. The rest of my face felt more like an inconvenience. It felt like I had a helmet squishing my head. But the incision inside my mout felt like a river of fire. Thankfully I tried to not take oxycodone when I could handle without it, but days 4-6 I ended up needing it the most just to be able to eat without pain.
</p>
<p>
Today finally I had my first week post-op. First one of his medical assistants I&#39;d interacted with a lot via email/phone in the runup, came in and took off the nose stents, cast, as well as the staples on my head. Then I finally got to see my nose and my my face with no wraps and I was just blown away. Even though my cheeks, chin and jaw are still swollen like a tomato, I immediately gravitated to my new nose, which is better than I could ever imagine. Dr. Kuperstock came in, checked the incisions, and chatted with us a bit about the next week. He also recorded another video with me to show me how to tape my nose and 2nd week incision care.
</p>
<p>
My mom just left and I&#39;m still here at the hotel for another week. 2 week post-op is June 9th and then it&#39;s back to California on June 10th. I&#39;m so much better now that head and nose wraps are only needed during at night for sleep. I&#39;m finally starting to see myself even though swelling is still extreme and I know it will be so for 3-6 months.
</p>
<p>
The Procedures I had:- Forehead contouring w/ brow life and scalp advancement. Incision in front of hairline.- Feminizing Cheek Implants (Medium)- Lip Lift (via incision on the side crevices of the bottom of my nose)
</p>
<p>
-Feminizing Rhinoplasty (Endonasal incision instead of one on bottom middle of the nose)
</p>
<p>
- Feminizing Mandible Countouring with Chin work.
</p>

Omg what a change!! Thank you for the detailed write up. I just emailed him for a consult. I desperately want ffs but I&#39;m pretty sure my insurance doesn&#39;t cover it (a perk of being a fed employee, all of my available choices consider ffs cosmetic and not medically necessary🤦🏽‍♀️) so I&#39;m in for a long fight. I&#39;ve read that he&#39;s helpful in assisting with this and I&#39;ve been looking up other resources too, so hopefully in the end it works out.
</p>
<p>
Have a safe trip home and hope your healing goes well!

Omg, I can see the difference. That swelling will take a while down but when it does🥰. And your head shape Pre op was already quite of feminine.

I’m sorry, I don’t really see much of a difference except for just post-op swelling!
