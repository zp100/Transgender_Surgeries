This is a reposting from back in December of 2022. I&#39;m primarily doing this as I wanted to separate my other account from surgery related things. Thanks!

It&#39;s been a whole month! Well, technically 34 days so I&#39;m a little late on posting this.
</p>
<p>
Currently recovery is going great, after the 2nd week things really began to feel better in terms of physical recovery and what I&#39;m able to do again. At this point I can do pretty much anything outside of strenuous movement/exercise. Sleep is finally undisturbed as I can sleep in whatever position and feel comfortable. I&#39;m very eager to see what everything&#39;s going to like around the 3 month mark! I seem to be healing fairly well, my outside sutures are taking the slowest it feels like because they just look angry still, but I&#39;m doing what I can to promote healing. The discharge around my clitoris is also ~bleh~ but I know in time that&#39;ll clear up too. Discharge from my vaginal canal was pretty rough from Week 3-4, but I started using significantly less lube for dilation and it helped clear that up a lot. Things feel good!
</p>
<p>
I have my 6-week post-op visit next week and I&#39;m looking forward to that. It&#39;ll be nice to get an update on things. I probably won&#39;t be making another post until my 3 month, but will be taking progress pics along the way! If you have any questions, feel free to ask or DM me! &lt;33
