Is it possible to achieve more depth with dilation, after the first surgery, where the amount of skin was insufficient?

No, it&#39;s just surgery.

Some people tried to dilate for depth,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fyrxcn/dilation_tips_to_maximise_depth/fn58xeb/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/go274u/succesful_attempt_at_gaining_depth/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
was a discussion.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise concerning a revision it may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
may be more, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic" rel="nofollow">Djordjevic</a>
may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/y0krwx/revision_expert/irsk9t5/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
was also a discussion.

You can regain lost depth back sometimes if you’re lucky but you’re pretty much stuck with what you get.
</p>
<p>
It’s extreme YMMV like I defo wasn’t consistent with it cause pain and feeling sick and I didn’t lose anything and was able to use sex toys or have PIV sex after 3 months without feeling tight.
</p>
<p>
I also have really good pelvic floor muscle control so maybe that helps.
