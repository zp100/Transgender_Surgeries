There is so little information out there about this procedure, so I wanted to take the time to write up my experience with the hope that it can help others understand it better and decide whether it’s right for them.
</p>
<p>
Overall it’s been a challenging surgery to recover from but I’m thrilled to be shorter. It’s so cool seeing people I know and not feeling like I’m towering over them in the way I used to. My partner is a great example. They are 5’4” and the perspective change with someone I know so well is really dramatic.The actual height difference is not huge. I hoped to get a 2.5” reduction which is the most the doctor does, because greater amounts of height reduction result in very week legs and more a more challenging recovery. I ended up with a reduction of 1 3/4&#34;... less than I hoped but still enough to make a significant difference.
</p>
<p>
The surgery was done by Dr Kevin Debiparshad, and expert in cosmetic limb length surgery. He does far more limb lengthening procedures (a few hundred per year, vs a few per year for shortening) but the mechanism is largely the same.The procedure involved making an incision in the side of the upper leg and removing a piece of the femur. A second incision is made at the top of the femur, near the hip. From there, a metal rod is inserted down the length of the bone to stabilize it. Four more tiny incision on the side of the leg are made to insert screws which secure the bone to the rod.
</p>
<p>
The surgery went very smoothly and there were no complications.  Shortly after being transferred to a hospital room, a physical therapist stopped by to get me up on my feet. Yes, the same day! In my case, the drugs made me dizzy and so I wasn’t able to do more than getting into a standing position and taking a couple small side steps and getting back in bed.That was the beginning of twice daily physical therapy which lasted for the entire hospital stay. The physical therapists, and really everyone at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, were amazing. They see a lot of Dr D’s patients and are prepared to help people start walking again, though shortening patients are much less common than lengthening patients, and shortening is a more challenging initial recovery.
</p>
<p>
The challenging part of this surgery is that because your bones are now shorter and your muscles are not, your muscles now have to contract a LOT in order to move your joints. That makes it extremely difficult to get up to standing position from sitting or to walk at all. At first you are largely lifting yourself up to a standing position using the walker and the strength of your arms. Originally I was told to expect a 2 day hospital stay, but for me it took 4 days before I could reliably get myself up to a standing position from a normal height chair.
</p>
<p>
I was also worried about transferring between a wheelchair and car seat, so the physical therapists helped me understand and simulate that before I was ready to go. It tuned out that was not as hard as I thought it would be, because it’s sometimes more of a “scoot” from wheelchair to car vs standing and then sitting like when getting up to walk.
</p>
<p>
Once I finally felt confident with that, I was discharged and Dr Debiparshad allowed my partner to drive me immediately back to my home in California to continue recovering. He normally likes patients to stay in the area and do daily physical therapy at his office (which is included in the cost of surgery) for two weeks, but in my case I just have a much better configuration at home and a better support system, so driving home right away made more sense.
</p>
<p>
Since being home I’ve been progressing quickly. So far I’ve been able to walk, with a walker, about 1000ft in a day. When using the walker I’m no longer leaning so heavily on it and instead using it more for balance. I’ve also been out to some appointments and found that Lyft has been great for that. As long as you can get into the car from the whellchair, Lyft drivers will fold the whellchair and put it in the back of their car. The drivers I&#39;ve had so far have been very helpful and accomodating.
</p>
<p>
People should know that while this surgery isn’t as scary or crazy as some people make it out to be, it’s also no joke. I’ve gone though a lot surgery in the past including FFS twice, BBL, tummy tuck, and GRS. I would describe this as having a level of pain that is tolerable but on par for any of those. It impacts initial mobility more than any of them, however, and it requires more active post-op recovery work than even GRS.
</p>
<p>
All that said, however, after just a week I didn’t have a lot of pain and my ability to take care of myself and get around was already pretty decent. Assuming recovery continues at this rate, it’s well worth it to me and I’m glad I went through it. I’m really looking forward to being able to navigate steps and start driving, as the disability is manageable but definitely still frustrating
</p>
<p>
I would also definitely recommend Dr Debiparshad and his staff. The only issue I’ve had is that replies to emails are often slow, sometimes taking a week or requiring follow-ups to ask questions two or three times. Ultimately I always got the answers I needed and I don’t think that’s particularly atypical of a surgeon’s office. Apart from that, everyone has been super nice and helpful though. Because Dr Debiparshad does so many of these surgeries (mostly lengthening, but the process is similar) and has excellent credentials and experience I really felt I was in great hands.He took the time to answer every question I had, and did a second consultation when more questions came to mind that his staff couldn&#39;t answer.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone tall experiences height dysphoria, and for those of us who do it still may not be worth the considerable cost and recovery involved. For me, though, this was a constant annoyance that made me feel out of place relative to the vast majority of women. I’m very glad I did it. I was 5’11 3/4” before surgery, and so far measured myself at 5’10” after. I’m unsure if there is any additional “settling” of any type that will affect my final height but it’s something I’m planning to ask at my two week post-op appointment tomorrow morning!
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you have any questions and I&#39;ll try to answer them below.
</p>
<p>
Edit: 5 week update!
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow marks 5 weeks since surgery and so I thought I&#39;d add an update to this post so I can remember how things went. Overall: I can now do a lot more than I could, but not nearly as much as I want.
</p>
<p>
Standing up and sitting down remain the hardest and most painful things to do. I can&#39;t do them without using my hands to help me, but I can do them much more easily than earlier in recovery. Today I stood with only one hand on the wheelchair for the first time! Standing hurts in my quads, in much the same way that deadlifting a very heavy weight would hurt my muscles normally. I had tried to stop painkillers completely, but I&#39;m going back to using tylenol frequently and percocet when I&#39;m going to be doing something strenuous. Reducing pain is important because it lets you do more which helps build strength faster.
</p>
<p>
Walking is getting a lot better, but I am still completely unstable without the walker. I&#39;m not yet at a point where I can take even a step without holding onto something for stability. I think that&#39;s mostly because I lack the strength needed to quickly adjust as my balance shifts. That said, over the course of last weekend I managed to walk a total of a half mile! That felt like a real milestone and so much progress from barely making it 10 feet shortly after surgery.
</p>
<p>
I started driving a bit. Because my lower legs were unaffected, I feel totally comfortable with it. I can get the walker in and out of the car by myself, but not the wheelchair, so I&#39;m still taking lyft if I need to go somewhere with the wheelchair.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m continuing to do physical therapy 3 times a week, exercises daily, getting up and walking some in the house frequently, and going out for longer walks when I can.
</p>
<p>
I see my progress constantly but it still feels like it&#39;s been a long time and I know I still have a long ways to go. I&#39;m really looking forward to the day when I can stand without pain and walk without support!
</p>
<p>
Edit: 8 week update!
</p>
<p>
Over the last two weeks things improved considerably. The pain dropped a lot so that now I don’t have much pain except after doing a lot of exercise. I can sleep on my side again, which has been really nice. A week ago I even started walking a bit without a cane or walker! It’s still very slow wobbly walking, but it’s walking. I managed to take a trip by air and have been driving again recently too.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Final update!
</p>
<p>
I ended physical therapy in late August, about 4 months after surgery. At that point I was able to walk up steep hills, walk on uneven terrain, and do most anything I wanted around the house and yard. However, I still had a bit of a waddle to my gait and things still felt challenging.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s now Dec 18, almost 8months after my surgery. I am back to full strength and mobility at this point. I went scuba diving two weeks ago here in California. My gait has returned to normal and while I still get stiff and sore a bit more easily, I&#39;m pretty much 100%.
</p>
<p>
I measured my height today at 5&#39;9 3/4&#34;. Other times I&#39;ve measured over the last few months were at 5&#39;9 1/2&#34;. So I lost between 1 3/4&#34; and 2 1/4&#34; inches. I think this variance is just due to taking the measurement myself and some inaccurancy in that. I&#39;m definitely going to round down and say I&#39;m 5&#39;9&#34;. 😄
</p>
<p>
Now the big question: was it all worth it? For me, it was! I am still tall, but I notice that and feel like I stand out for my height a lot less than before. That has addressed much of the height dysphoria I had before.
</p>
<p>
That said, this was a very challenging recovery. Although a second surgery to reduce my height a bit further is possible, I don&#39;t currently feel like that would be worth it for me. I&#39;m happy with the results but also happy to leave it at that.

Does the muscle change over time to accommodate the new bone shape or would you always have less mobility than you used to?

Yes, the muscles adjust but it takes some months. You may permanently lose a bit of strength but the way he explained it to me is that if you are a pro or very serious athlete it would likely be an issue, but probably not an issue for an average person.

I’m just under 6’1 and for me, it would be great but also not worth it. I’d still be unfortunately tall so I’ll just deal with it lol

That is totally valid! It&#39;s an intense surgery and definitely not for everyone. We all have different needs and desires.

Yeah, when you are tall like that, or even like I was at 6&#39;, an inch or two does make a significant difference in perspective and in how it feels standing next to other people.

No I don’t think it looks unusual. It’s not enough of a height change for that ratio to really be noticeable. I think people notice height way more than exact proportions of different limbs.

i lost about 5cm from hrt (went from 179 cm to 174.5cm) and it never occurred to me that my arms might look funny... maybe they do, but heck if i notice anything.
</p>
<p>
did you wind up with any hrt related height changes earlier?

Usually hrt height related changes are from cartridge shrinking and becoming tighter, so it&#39;s everywhere including elbows shoulders hands feet legs, and primarily the spine

Height charge is also from anterior pelvic tilt, which also happens because of more flexible tendons.

ah, that would make sense that everything changed.
</p>
<p>
i think a lot of the difference was from pelvic tilt, cos my rear stuck out a ton further, and my gait was different.  (i had had some pelvic tilt in puberty and people made jokes about me having a female skeleton already... but i&#39;m sure that it changed to be more pronounced.  And that was before the E fat gain, so i was still very thin, zero fat back then... only 67 kilos on what was originally 179 cm changed to 174.5cm.)

does this have any joint pain impacts? I&#39;ve had a few surgeries and injuries in my life and already have knee pain, lower back pain, and foot pain from some accidents. I&#39;m pre-everything, but your comment gave me some pause. For example, I was prescribed a statin I had to stop taking because it was exacerbating my existing joint pain terribly.

Are you asking about HRT or this surgery. Limb shortening surgery absolutely involves quite a lot of joint pain (but I’ve found tolerable with Percocet/Morphine/Valium)

No I don&#39;t think I did. Though I also started HRT 25 years ago when I was 19. Maybe it prevented me from growing as tall as I would have.

Just thought to add: this surgeon would not, and no one should ever, do arms and legs at the same time. I’m learning just how crucial my arm strength is in my recovery. This would be 100x harder if my arms were weakened at the same time. Twenty times a day I’m lifting myself to standing by pushing on arm rests using my triceps.

Yeah I think there&#39;s a point at which this would look weird on me. Like, I&#39;d love to be in the neighborhood of like 5&#39;3&#34; but I think i&#39;d look weird if I went that far (and it&#39;s not even possible to do 9&#34; anyway)

It’s your body, but I still don’t think this kind of procedure is smart. BBL can also be risky, feel like there’s a reason only very few surgeons do it in the US.

There used to be very few surgeons who did ffs, or grs, or really any surgery you can name. I have seen people say things like this but I don’t think it’s very warranted. Compared to many other surgeries there’s a lot less impact on soft tissue, nerves, blood vessels, etc. it’s really mostly just the bone that’s affected, and some incisions to access the bone. Also the techniques are not very different from how surgeons fix broken legs, so it’s really extremely well understood in the orthopedic world. It’s just that it’s done for a cosmetic/gender affirming reason rather than to repair an injury. I bet we will see this done a lot more as time goes on.

When I started transition, there were no surgeons doing FFS. And then when I went full time, there was exactly one. In the world.

Yeah exactly. I’m probably a little younger, but my first FFS was with Douglas Ousterhout in the early 2000s and I don’t think there were many, if any, others at the time.

My consult with him was early-mid-90s, and he was still at Stanford then.  I have some issues with him, but we&#39;ll just leave those for some other thread. ;) But yeah, he was inventing FFS at the time.

I didn&#39;t go that far, I still lived as me. And yeah, the surgeries are far more advanced now! But I sure would have liked to have had it back in 1994 when I qualified.  An allegedly fake therapist and HBIGDA gatekeeping cheated me out of that
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;ve had my first round of FFS now, next round towards the end of the year, then SRS next year. Better than never I guess!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been on HRT for 32 years, but like 25 of it has been on blackmarketed horse-pee.  The bio-identical, bio-available stuff has been amazing.

Thanks for sharing your experiences! Can I ask what do you mean by black market horse-pee vs bio-identical, bio-available stuff?

Back in the day, it wasn&#39;t legal to &#34;DIY&#34;. I was on oral Premarin and medroxyprogesterone, smuggled from Pakistan or Taiwan depending on where customs was looking hardest.
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;m on IM estradiol and oral micronized progesterone.  ... and regular blood testing means I can push it higher than was safe without.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, customs seized about 20% of my orders. Another 20% just ended up being stolen at the &#34;pharmacy&#34;. And then you never really knew for _sure_ what you were getting when you did get it.

I wouldn’t attribute that solely to the “normalization” of the procedure. Medical technology progresses
<em>
rapidly
</em>
! For medical (not cosmetic) elective surgeries, most doctors recommend putting them off as long as possible because the later you get it, the better the technology will be. I was told in high school that I’ll certainly need back surgery someday, but even with the general wear and tear of aging, it’s best to wait as long as possible to get the surgery. You never know how much can change in medicine over 20, 10, or even 5 years. GRS is a great example of this. The first people to get it
<em>
died
</em>
because it was so medically new and untested. Personally, I wouldn’t want to get a surgery when it’s still relatively uncharted territory.
</p>
<p>
All that said, I wouldn’t discourage someone who understands the risks from pursuing it, and I’m glad you’re happy with it! I just think it’s important to consider all aspects of something so drastic and undeveloped.

Yeah, I think a key thing is that a lot of the techniques and tools involved are very well tested from the general orthopedics world. Still, there are differences and having someone with experience doing this is important I think.

Just giving another perspective for other people thinking about these procedures. You make it sound like there&#39;s not possible complications, especially for shortening your legs that causes your problems as you get older. I urge anyone thinking of these surgeries to really do your research on complications and the surgeon you&#39;re using. Also really think about how these will really improve your life or if its something that you could learn to live without and learn to love your body as it is.
</p>
<p>
I mean I get FFS/VFS/GRS as it can make a major difference in living life fully as a woman. I think at lot of these other surgeries are cosmetic that are more a body dysmorphia issue rather then gender dysphoria issue. Women come in all different shapes and sizes/heights. Trust me these days 6ft is pretty common to see. I think you should really talk to a therapist and thinking a lot before surgeries that could affect the rest of your life. As she said the muscles have to shrink down, your muscles will never work to same after the surgery and can cause major issues down the line. BBL can have major infection risks and very likely could need to be removed because of complications.

Absolutely there are risks and potential very serious complications, just like with the other surgeries you mentioned (GRS, FFS, VFS). I did not sugarcoat that or the recovery in my post. What someone decides is important and worth the risk for them is intensely personal. Because it’s different than what you want doesn’t make it any less valid. Frankly I think the artificial divide between gender confirming and cosmetic is just another form of gatekeeping. It shames people into feeling that what they want isn’t valid. We all deserve to do with our bodies as we see fit so long as we are fully informed when consenting to it. (and that goes for cis people too.)

I started walking THE SAME DAY as surgery, just very minimally at first. There is a metal rod that goes down the middle of your bone which supports your weight. It takes several months for the bone to fully heal, but you can put your full weight on it right away.

My surgeon actually told my PT that it’s PARTIAL weight bearing for the first 4 weeks. That means you can walk with a walker by partially supporting your weight using your arms. I’m not sure why that’s different than what I originally understood. Perhaps I misinterpreted what was said originally.

All surgeries have risk. Everyone has different goals. One person&#39;s dysmorphia and/or dysphoria isn&#39;t necessarily yours. But it certainly does nothing to invalidate their experience.  I&#39;ve passed fine for close to 30 years. Like cis-passing, never misgendered.   If I could get a surgery to reduce my height from 5&#39;9 to around 5&#39;3, I&#39;d do it today without any regard for my being ancient.

You could get close to that! He can also do lower leg reduction, but as a second, separate, surgery. So optimistically it would be something like 2.5&#34; upper leg, 1.5&#34; lower leg, so final height perhaps as low as 5&#39;5&#34;

was wondering with the muscles... how does that work long term? does there wind up eventually being changes in the muscle length or ligaments that make things work out?  How does the body compensate?

The muscles and tendons will eventually shorten. I learned this the hard way after exclusively wearing high heels for a couple years. My calf muscles and Achilles tendon now naturally adjust for about a 3&#34; raise, and flat shoes feel abnormal.

oh, i had not thought about that... pre Covid I was in heels almost all the time, but then once Covid hit it was rare to use them... so did not wind up having that experience.

<p>
good news for OP...  sorry if causes trouble to you...

Yep, those things eventually tighten and compensate, but it means you are very weak at first and it takes time to regain that strength.

I payed $50k plus a bit more for a hotel room (which I ended up not using much) , a wheelchair/walker and medication. The two extra days in the hospital were $1500 each.

Foot reduction is not one I have much dysphoria about or know much about. Do you have any links to info? I’m curious.
</p>
<p>
I am indeed very fortunate to be able to afford it. We all deserve to get the care we need and it’s a tragedy it’s so inaccessible to many.

Also, this for me was not about passing. I pass and I don’t think this would make me pass if I didn’t. For me this was about an internal feeling from being taller than 99.5% of women, when I really just want to be a smol girl.

There are foot surgeons that shorten toe length, thus resulting in a smaller shoe size. Haven’t heard of any other foot reduction.

Did your insurance not cover most of that $50k? I’d think even if the surgeon was out of network, you’d have been capped at your OOP max

I&#39;m genuinely jealous you can afford this surgery but I&#39;m also really happy for you! Height reduction is one of the things I&#39;d love to get (on top of all the other surgeries I&#39;ll never afford aha) and reading about it was very insightful, thanks for taking the time to share your experience!

Here’s a video from my doctor about the procedure. I should have thought to include it in my original post:

I can definitely recommend Dr Debiparshad. He does way more lengthening cases than shortening. The lengthening is fascinating. They put in a nail in the middle of your bone that is extendable. Then they make you taller by a mm per day until you reach your desired height, using a machine that rotates an internal screw with magnets. The initial recovery is easier than shortening, but then the extension of the nail over time is uncomfortable as I understand it.

Same. I’m a 5’2” trans man and I thought it was just something I was going to have to deal with for the rest of my life. Not sure it’s bad enough for me that I’d get this surgery, but this post definitely gives me something to think about so thanks for the info OP!

I had my post-op appointment this morning. I learned that there may be a revision to gain an additional 35mm which is less intense/invasive than the original procedure. It&#39;s dependent on healing going really well and getting back to very close to my original strength, however.

Yes it is! There are basically three holes at the bottom of the rod, with screws in two of them. So they would leave the rod in, take out a bit more bone, then put the screws into the other two holes.

I&#39;ve had my femur broken in a car wreck so I already have a rod in it. Would the procedure still be possible?

I would guess it would be. I think they’d probably remove the old nail, shorten the leg, then re-insert it or insert a new one. But of course that’s really a question for a surgeon.

Im interested in this surgery! Do you think you would be able to provide or DM me before and after pics with your face blurred out? It would help me imagine how I would look if I undergo this

Thanks so much for telling us about your experience. I&#39;m interested in undergoing this procedure.. Please keep us updated! Weeks later, I&#39;d like to know if the pain ever disappears, and whether your legs can fully function.

Hello ! Thank you very much for sharing ! I have been looking everywhere to get a better prospective on height shortening &amp; can’t find much out there from the people that have had this procedure . I am very much considering this but with caution ! I am in my early twenties healthy etc I don’t think I would be turned down from getting this procedure but I would like to know due to the muscles having to shrink down , what do your thighs look like now ? Do they look the same as before ? &amp; what about the incisions ? Are the scars pretty big or small and not noticeable?

i’ve been feeling particularly down about my height lately and this post gave me a small boost of hope. if you are still up to answering questions, i have a few!:
</p>
<p>
-how much did the surgery and process cost you?
</p>
<p>
-you said in a comment reply you considered having them “take it off the top” - what does that mean? is there such thing as a head size reduction surgery, and if so i imagine it would be risky/dangerous?
</p>
<p>
-now that it’s been over 3 months since this post, how well are you in terms of recovery? can you walk independently? are you still disabled?

So someone who&#39;s 5 10 could be like 5&#39;9 - 5&#39;8 (myself)  I&#39;m very interested  Hello all, names Aly here. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some have come across some of my content. I started off at a whoppin 6 ft tall Might&#39;ve even been measured at 6 foot 1 before hrt.
</p>
<p>
Having been on hrt for years, I am measured at 5 10 even. I hope to keep shrinking. Take at least 6 inches from me lord, but I know that won&#39;t happen. If I shrink another couple and got that surgery. I&#39;d be bairly satisfied but happy because yk, shorter person.
</p>
<p>
I remember growing up there was a certain point where I was like oh no, I might not stop growing and became very unhappy with my height. I was a happy 3 to 4 foot tall person, puberty hit, I kid not grew an additional 3 feet and quickly. It was noticable. There was a point I remember begging God to stop making me grow. Now here I am begging to be returned, same with my Adams apple. I&#39;d push it in and hated it as it started to grow in.
</p>
<p>
I Wana be 4 foot but 5 foot would be eh acceptable. I like the idea of someone picking me up and being manhandled xD I also like the idea of climbing shelves. But that&#39;s unrealistic. It would still be worth it to me. The real question from all this nonsense I just typed up is &#34;do they take Medicaid&#34;.

Did insurance cover this or did you have to pay out of pocket?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m short already, which was very distressing to be before transition but not so much now.
</p>
<p>
But through reaso. I ask is there seem to be s lot of &#34;periphery&#34; type surgeries people get to cope with various forms of dysphoria, but it seems like insurance only pays for GCS and maybe FFS if you&#39;re lucky.

I paid out of pocket. My current insurance doesn’t cover much beyond GRS I don’t think, so I didn’t even try.
