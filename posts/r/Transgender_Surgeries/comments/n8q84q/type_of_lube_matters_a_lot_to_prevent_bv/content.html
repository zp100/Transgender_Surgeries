Check the ph of the lube used in your vagina. I used to use Slippery Stuff with a ph of 7 and switched to GoodCleanLove Almost Naked that has a lower ph and noticed an important in smell and my boyfriend also commented on better smell and taste. Article from the WHO saying &#34;Ideally therefore a vaginal lubricant should have a pH of about 4.5&#34; due to bacteria and additional reasons they discussed in their pdf.
<a href="https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/rtis/rhr12_33/en/">https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/rtis/rhr12_33/en/
</a>
</p>
<p>
Other studies linked on GoodCleanLove page about theirs in particular.
<a href="https://goodcleanlove.com/pages/science">https://goodcleanlove.com/pages/science
</a>
</p>
<p>
Another promising one is Ah!Yes WB I tested some, but availability is not great, so nothing long term.

</p>
<p>
I know Slippery Stuff is popular for dilating, heck, I used to swear by it. Now I don&#39;t. Anal sure it&#39;s probably fine but not vaginal. If you email Wallace-OFarrell, the company that makes Slippery Stuff, asking about the ph and you&#39;ll get a response about how they don&#39;t care. Atleast I did, even when I brought up the recommendations from the World Health Organization. Smh, a company that doesn&#39;t listen to science is not good when they brag about being safe. I expect them to have an explanation for why they ignore very clear recommendations from the WHO at minimum.
</p>
<p>
Another lube I see is coconut oil. This has a high ph and worse is anti bacteria which is bad in that it will disrupt the &#34;good&#34; bacteria from establishing. So, I&#39;d put this on the avoid list based on current recommendations and data. It is great feeling imo, but frequent use and few weeks or month later, well, might not be so great any more.
</p>
<p>
Granted there are not many studies looking specifically at neovaginas, the ones I have found suggest they are capable of having the same microbiome as a cis vagina therefore the same ph guidelines apply to prevent &#34;bad&#34; bacteria from having the advantage over &#34;good&#34; bacteria.
</p>
<p>
My personal experience also agrees with this. I did more research and testing but I&#39;m just hitting the highlights here as this post is already long, thanks if you read this far..

This is interesting. I had been on surgilube for several months and then switched to slippery stuff and almost immediately noticed strong BV-related odor. My surgeon’s (Dr. McGinn’s) PA recommended GoodClean Love Almost  Naked. I made that switch about a month ago and my odor is getting less and less.
</p>
<p>
I love the way Slippery Stuff works but it’s not worth the BV and the odor.

I&#39;m surprised there aren&#39;t more reviews like this on Amazon. Again glad to hear more similar experiences.

Why did you switch out of surgilube? I&#39;m using it right now (only 3 weeks post-op) and I&#39;m wondering if I should just keep using surgilube indefinitely.

I used Surgilube because it’s bacteriostatic and I had a lot of surgical wounds, as we all do.  I didn’t want to do anything to endanger the healing process.
</p>
<p>
Once all the wounds were sufficiently healed (even the tiny bits) I tried slippery stuff because it’s just a better lube. It worked better and I didn’t need as much. But I think it’s not necessarily that great an idea for neovaginas because we don’t have the cleansing systems that cis vaginas have. So now I’m using Almost Naked.

Huh, this is interesting to me too. I&#39;m pre-op so this is all kind of academic to me (for now), but I was aware that vaginal pH makes a significant difference in vaginal flora. It didn&#39;t occur to me that anyone made a lube that was that acidic; I just sort of assumed if it became an issue, I&#39;d look into pH-adjusting supplements.
</p>
<p>
One concern that sticks out at me about Good Clean Love though: Two 4-oz bottles of it costs $22, which is quadruple the price of Slippery Stuff. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s fine if you&#39;re a year post-op and only dilating every other day, but that cost can become significant if you&#39;re only a couple months post-op and still going through an ounce or more of lube a day.
</p>
<p>
Now the mad scientist in me is wondering, could a person
<em>
add
</em>
a bit of lactic acid to some Slippery Stuff to lower its pH? Adjusting the pH would be pretty straightforward, I would think; you&#39;d want to buffer it with some calcium lactate too, but it seems doable from a chemistry aspect. The hard part would be
<em>
mixing
</em>
that gel to distribute the acid evenly. Stick blender maybe? Or would that break down the gel?
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;ve gotten myself all curious. I have a tube of Slippery Stuff and some citric acid (which is fairly close), I feel like I might do some small-scale experiments just to see what happens....

Update: No bueno.
</p>
<p>
It seems the sodium carbomer--the main thickening agent--in Slippery Stuff does not react well to the presence of ions of any kind. I put a pinch of citric acid powder onto a dollop of Slippery Stuff, and watched it melt in front of me. The resulting liquid was still very slippery due to the polyethylene glycol, but it was also the consistency of whole milk.
</p>
<p>
Just for fun I tried the same test again using a pinch of table salt. Same effect, it melted like an ice cube under a blowtorch. Neat little experiment, but probably explains why Good Clean Love uses xanthan gum as its thickener.
</p>
<p>
I suppose this effect also explains why Slippery Stuff is such a generally
<em>
good
</em>
lube (pH notwithstanding). The body and its fluids are all laden with salts, so when Slippery Stuff mixes with them, it liquifies and spreads to form a thin, lubricating film. Clever!

Thanks for the update. I was about to comment as chemistry is a passion. The cost to me is not concerning when my operation was over $200k. However being medical maybe insurance and hsa can help. Also I think contacting goodcleanlove.com telling them the need for affordable lube for dilation might be worth it to hear what they say.
</p>
<p>
There is also matter of access in some countries so a diy might be handy regardless. I&#39;ve done a lot of diy lubes in the past, but I know much more now and can probably do something better.
</p>
<p>
Thing is how to test osmolality to make it worth making. I haven&#39;t looked into it yet but that would be important test since there are plenty with low pH but osmolality way too high. Unless osmolality can be lowered might as well just look at the list of lubes in the article and pick one.

Hello, Good Clean Love here. For full transparency, we use this account to view mentions we get on Reddit. We will pass your input regarding dilation along to the appropriate team members.
</p>
<p>
You can also view independently funded NIH research on the osmolality of personal lubricants, including Good Clean Love,

</a>
.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, we&#39;d like to mention that we do provide free sample subscription boxes of our lubricants, moisturizers, and vaginal care products

I had a similar experience switching from Slippery Stuff to Sliquid. Sliquid is &#34;pH balanced&#34;, but I don&#39;t know what pH it actually is.

Ph balanced often means 7 in a general sense. If it doesn’t say ph matched or anything to indicate vagina ph, I&#39;d email the manufacturer. Or get a test kit. Even cheap ph paper would be a good enough.

Awesome glad to hear another similar experience with positive improvement. Especially after the response Wallace-OFarrell sent me. &#34;We’ve sold millions of doses over 35 years and no one has ever complained about the ph.  Sorry if it doesn’t work for you.&#34;

You might try looking for vaginal moisturizers. The couple I have seen have a suitable low ph and could be good enough for maintenance dilation.
</p>
<p>
I know someone who douches with vinegar water mixture after each dilation. Though that could have separate issues douching that often.

Thanks I&#39;ll consider that. I might also just import lube that&#39;s not available here.
</p>
<p>
As far as I know douching equipment aren&#39;t sold in Norway, would need to import that too I think.

A large syringe and a flexible tube like a catheter is all you need. You hospital or doctor might give you one just for asking. It&#39;s pretty standard medical equipment. You don&#39;t need to go with the whole douche bag. That more liquid and more clean up than you need.

Also talk to your grocery store manager, pharmacy and adult store owner. One of those might be willing to start carrying Good Clean Love lube line. They are reputable and are carried around here at Target, Wal-Mart and even local grocery stores.
