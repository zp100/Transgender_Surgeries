Wow your surgeon did an awesome job that looks fantastic, I hope you are happy with it. Healing looks good and honestly without knowing wouldn&#39;t know the difference.

Yes, her office takes many insurance companies. But call and check to make sure she&#39;s in-network with your company. You may have to be persistent - she&#39;s a fantastic surgeon and her assistants Karen and Jim are also great, her insurance coordinator - not so much.
</p>
<p>
Be aware that there&#39;s a long waiting list. If it works for you, once you get a surgical date, tell them you&#39;ll like to be wait-listed if there&#39;s an earlier cancellation. I&#39;m in NJ so travel / hotel were non-issues, but if you&#39;re traveling from elsewhere, changing your scheduled travel / hotel plans may not be practical.

Did you set your your consultation or initial registration via the phone or does she have an email/website to submit to? I‚Äôve called several times but never hear word back.

I called in December 2021 and the first phase was a televisit in January 2022 with their social worker. From then on it was &#34;we&#39;ll get back to you in 2-4 weeks&#34; and nothing would happen. So I&#39;d have to call back. Next was a visit with their psychiatrist. Wait for a callback, nothing. Called back and got an appointment for a physical exam. That exam was the most perfunctory physical I&#39;ve ever received. Got the expected &#34;we&#39;ll get back to  you in 2-4 weeks&#34;. After not hearing anything back, I called back and was rather cross with them.
</p>
<p>
They told me I was calling the wrong department (!) and gave me a different number. Called that new number and was told the surgeon had an opening for an initial consultation in late spring 2023. I said &#34;Nonono - you&#39;ve had me on this treadmill for 6 months already&#34; and got a callback for my initial consultation scheduled for August 2022. That was the first time I met / talked to my surgeon. She introduced me to her staff, and did an exam and talked about what I was looking for. She said her surgical coordinator would get back to me with a proposed surgical date.
</p>
<p>
The surgical coordinator did call me back in a day or two with a May 2023 date, but said that if there was a cancellation, my date could be moved sooner.
</p>
<p>
The weekend after Thanksgiving 2022 I came down with a horrible case of COVID, despite being current on my shots (in fact, I had just received the latest booster a few weeks prior). I felt miserable but was feeling better by the middle of the following week
</p>
<p>
I got a call from &#34;unknown caller&#34; on my cell phone. I always let those go to voicemail but for some reason I decided to answer. It was the surgical coordinator asking if I&#39;d be interested in an early February 2023 surgery date and of course I said yes.
</p>
<p>
I think my initial contacts were with the generic &#34;Center for transgender medicine&#34; office and then they gave me the number for the actual surgeon&#39;s office halfway through the process.
</p>
<p>
If you DM me I&#39;ll send you the number for her surgical coordinator. That is definitely not the right place to start, but at least Karen answers her phone and can give you the number of someone who will answer at the place where you are supposed to start. Just be aware that that first place is bad at returning calls and you have to call and bug them about followups. Once you pass those steps and get to the point you&#39;re dealing with Karen in the surgeon&#39;s office, callbacks happen quickly.
</p>
<p>
As soon as you decide you&#39;re going to go with Dr. Avanessian, start to get your letters (2 psychiatrist letters, letters from your HRT prescriber and your primary care provider) started so that they&#39;re ready for the office to submit to your insurance. They will probably expire before your surgery date, so you&#39;ll need to get ones with current dates, but that&#39;s a lot easier than getting the letters the first time

i‚Äôve lost a lil bit of depth bc of some dilation problems with internal granulation / muscle tension. after surgery they said i had 6.5 inches (i think i was actually a little under 6 based on the dilator dots) currently i‚Äôve got a little over 5 inches of depth

It depends on your individual anatomy. She utilizes various methods to achieve the optimal results for each patient. I believe the only method she doesn&#39;t use is the sigmoid technique.
</p>
<p>
I had minimal depth vaginoplasty with her over a year ago and she discussed penile inversion and PPT after she measured me during my consultation. She eventually used PI for my surgery.
</p>
<p>
If your concern is maximum possible depth, definitely ask about that during your consultation. You&#39;ll probably have to go through the whole process of planning for surgery with her office. I initially contacted them in December 2021, had my first actual consultation with her in September 2022 and surgery in February 2023.

That is Dr. Supon levels of good. Like, I was literally scrolling and was surprised, thought it was a cis vagina. He‚Äôll, it looks better that most cis women vagina.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Avanessian is hella good. I can practically feel the happiness and euphoria brimming here. Major congratulations!
</p>
<p>
Btw that‚Äôs insanely good healing for just 6 weeks. May I ask, what did you do? Like any special lotion or instructions they gave or was it just mostly Dr. Avanessian‚Äôs technique?

<p>
While this is a really nice compliment to say to OP, it takes a massive dump on cis women.
</p>
<p>
Women should be elevating each other regardless of whether we are they are cis or trans. Not pushing one down to &#34;elevate&#34; the other.

You know what, good point. I‚Äôll keep that in mind in the future. Thanks for that, I genuinely appreciate your feedback.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôll correct myself and say, her vagina looks completely cis. Her surgeon did an amazing job.
</p>
<p>
Not as explosive of a compliment, but I think it hits the mark .
