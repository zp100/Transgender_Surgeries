Yeah, kinda look the same right now (almost 19 days postop), it&#39;s just fibrin production on wounds which is pretty normal.

I think it will get better.Marks of stitches will be cleared in few weeks.  But from a single pic, i cant comment.SRS m2f is very complex surgery and every surgeon has his own artistic hand.

They&#39;re both extremely challenging procedures. This one does tends to have better outcomes. Like the science and techniques have come along further than the penile construction surgeries. But they both require a knowledgeable and skilled surgeon/team

reconstructive genital surgery is obviously a complex surgical task, the complexity of the procedures has little to nothing to do with what (I assume) the op is asking about what is visually considered normal at this stage post-operatively. vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, and other genital gcs are &#39;hard&#39; for the patients and the surgeons. idk what you&#39;re considering to be a &#39;better outcome&#39; and I don&#39;t have a statistic at hand, but afaik the results are all generally positively received from the trans-masc and trans-femme patients alike. further, the most popular technique of penile inversion vaginoplasty has remained largely, although not entirely, the same for much of it&#39;s history. compared to phalloplasty, which has changed as improvements have been made to microsurgery and implants, and different surgeons might utilize techniques for donor tissue sites for patients with different desired outcomes

What does your gut feeling tell you? Everyone’s version of “okay” is different just as how everyone’s body/healing process different. Due to the fact that you’re early on in the healing process I would say wait it out a bit and see how it goes.

I would disagree that a patients gut feeling about what is okay isn&#39;t informative about what is or isnt objectively an infection, dehiscence, or any other immediate post-operative concern

it will get better but you got to work really hard. Make sure you are dilating and doing those sitz baths I am 11 days or so also post op I will post mine if you like. We got ours done at the same time.  When my gaze came out I felt like it was a dead aborted animal.

different surgeons will recommend different after care, but afaik generally patients aren&#39;t advised to submerge fresh, open wounds like the site of a vaginoplasty under water for some time
</p>
<p>
idk if the op question was related to dilation at all, that is important but idk why you&#39;re mentioning that

What is the bowers guide? My surgeon at GRs made us do it as soon as our mould was out. It takes up a ton of time. But the biggest thing is instead of 4 30 min dilations I was hoping to do 3 40 min dilations. 4 is just so much. Soon as I started submerging in stiz bath pain went down and swelling so thought must have been a key point in healing that and douching.  But they can check with their dr. I do not know if I trust the drs who are telling the oP they will be okay. A lot of bad drs out there. It also is just one picture though so could just be that.

No personal knowledge of this myself, but I&#39;ve heard it can take months for swelling to go down completely, and it looks like that&#39;s at least partly what&#39;s going on. 11 days isn&#39;t a lot of time to heal, especially not after a major surgery. I feel like, at least for now, to trust your doctor and give it a month or 2 for stitches to heal and swelling to go down some. But if it has you totally freaking out, definitely contact your doc and see if they can explain what&#39;s going on and changes you&#39;re likely to see as the healing continues, so you have an idea of what to expect

If it look a mess in say 3-4 weeks… don’t let these mf’ers gas light you. And that they will do. Don’t let them get away with that. But don’t stress bout it now.

I would trust Bower&#39;s opinion. If she says you&#39;re doing well, you&#39;re doing well. Just ask her frankly about any complications you think you&#39;re experiencing and ask for the truth. But Dr. Bowers is probably in the top 5 surgeons in the world.

</p>

Many surgeons are not artistically good in reality and I agree early post op you can tell right away pretty much whether revisions are going to be needed even a week out post op - obviously the technique done is critical ( the best is Sigmoid , Jejunum , PPT is very thin tissue )  - I’m biased but PI should be outlawed as a 70 plus year old technique for example from the early 1950’s  , it’s done because it’s the simplest for a surgeon to learn but usually 90% of the time creates a lack of depth with Penile skin not designed to be a vaginal canal in reality and you end up with No Labia minora nothing distinctive showing what a person expects post op - despite the issue with my original Scrotal PI Kamol 2019 and  it looked not super bad 1 week out 2019  but It could have been better if I did Sigmoid 1 st time having the spare skin tissue to make the nineties  - had to go to Theerapong fall 2022 for Sigmoid and it works fine but he’s not good at Revisions Aesthetically - 1 st time he can do a good job but know doubt many surgeons do not have the artistic ability bottom line ?
</p>
<p>
I’m still struggling to fix my little Goddess aesthetically 4 1/2 years later . Damn !  , finding a surgeon at almost 66 is now becoming a problem I have to say - the pic above will need some considerable attention once healed it appears but doable - unfortunately they won’t touch it for a year at least !

it&#39;s difficult to get advice from random people on the internet based on a photo with very blurry details, you mentioned &#39;all the doctors keep telling [you] it looks amazing&#39; which is probably a good indicator, as people online won&#39;t be able to do much and I wouldn&#39;t put must trust in their opinion. with that said, I would recommend that you discuss any specific concerns with the original surgeon if possible, or seek another opinion from a medical practitioner with experience in wound care (I&#39;m assuming your concern is based on swelling and the state of still open wounds) as you can believe the trust their opinion and they could possibly provide any appropriate health care (remember that most practitioners won&#39;t want to make and major adjustments to a fresh surgical site unless necessary)

Looks about right. Best advice I got from my surgeon was to not worry about how things look after surgery, it will continue to look better with time….. and it did.

I&#39;m gonna be giga real rn. The fact that trans people have been hurt, lied to, abused, and mistreated in most medical settings that we reflexively distrust the surgeons trying to help us is deeply sad.

Reddit is a better resource than almost any medical professional for which surgeon to go to. There are trans people who don&#39;t know any better getting referred to fucking Rumer on the daily.
</p>
<p>
Even the good medical professionals tend to have a local bias. They&#39;ll send you to whoever is closest, whichever colleague they rub shoulders with, rather than telling you the pros/cons of different surgeries and surgeons.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been this way since the beginning of time with trans healthcare though. Trans people tell each other through word of mouth how to lie to doctors and how to get the best treatment.
</p>
<p>
It used to be worse when people had to pretend to be binary or straight and wear skirts to every meeting.

Looks like normal post surgical swelling and healing. do what you can for swelling I&#39;m cis but I had to have groin surgery recently which will often cause a lot of swelling so I and slept with pillows under my butt and legs for awhile (or whenever youbare laying down) to help with swelling. As an ER nurse I have only ever seen infected vaginoplasties in the ER and yours does not look infected to me.
</p>
<p>
Try you best to relax rely on your docs surgeons and support people and good look with you recover I hope it goes well.

I had surgery with Dr. Bowers in August and would say mine looked similar to yours for the first few weeks. Extreme swelling and pain, lots of blood and other general grossness and I was constantly concerned something was terribly wrong but Dr. Gunther helped ease my anxiety every time I felt like something was going wrong. Always advocate for yourself and be proactive in your recovery but If your medical team and Dr. Bowers office is not concerned then that’s a good thing! There is a reason we have been on the waiting list for so long and it’s because they really are the best and know what they are doing. As terrible as you may feel, Ive learned over the last 4 months that you have to let your body do what it needs to do to heal and the only control you have over it is following the advice and guidance of your doctors and not letting doom scrolling and googling symptoms create more anxiety.

The photo is not very good quality to be able to see what the tissue actually looks like, but if your surgeon isn&#39;t too concerned, I&#39;d give it a few more days and maybe post another update.   Definitely keep taking photos for yourself so you can monitor what it looks like.  Not sure what they have you doing as far as cleaning the site, but touch the area ONLY after washing your hands or use gloves, and prioritize keeping the area pretty dry.  Air is good for healing so try not to wear underwear whenever possible and let air get to it- this helps keep moisture down too.  Sorry if these are things you already know but still very important to prevent infection- remember bacteria love warm, moist areas which the groin is notorious for being. I know things seem scary right now, but try to relax and accept things as they come and keep your surgeon updated.  Stress will only further slow the healing process.  Best of luck to you dear.

Go with what your doctors are telling you. It&#39;s just 11 days after, so it&#39;s completely normal for it to look raw. Always listen to a doctor!!! Or get a second opinion if you&#39;re that worried. Get some doctors you trust more that a subreddit
