Even when there are no inner labia? That seems like quite a big tradeoff.

Eh to me it&#39;s a minor trade off. Like I&#39;m not a huge fan of large inner but a little something wouldn&#39;t be bad. However this also could have been an issue with the amount of material. Id severely atrophied before so maybe that&#39;s why. I&#39;ll actually have to ask at my 1 year follow up.

Ok so my 1 year vagiversarry is in 2 days so I&#39;m 2 days short but really that&#39;s close enough.
</p>
<p>
But I am officially 1 year out with Dr Pang from Mt Sinai NYC. This was done as a PI with a tunica graft.
</p>
<p>
At this point you can see the results. I cant complain, I have sensitivity for the clitoris and can orgasm. Dilation I&#39;ll say I have lost some depth and girth but that&#39;s largely due to me slacking at month 6 do to a really painful case of BV from changing lube that made it excruciatingly painful to dilate. But overall I can still get all the dots on green but orange is no longer doable. I&#39;m trying to get back there buts it&#39;s proving a challenge. I do still experience some discomfort while dilating as well most likely due to residual granulation tissue.
</p>
<p>
Asthetically there&#39;s a few tweaks I&#39;ll personally say I&#39;d make if I had the money, but they&#39;re minor to me. Labia majora has a little unevenness that I wouldn&#39;t mind straightened out. Labia minora I don&#39;t have much to even note so going back and revising that and changing the asthetic of the clitoris. I feel it still looks too much like it did pre-op if you catch my drift. Like these aren&#39;t major though and minor gripes they one day I&#39;ll get looked at.
</p>
<p>
But Dr Pang and the whole team at Mt Sinai were fantastic, and I would still recommend them. Just be prepared to fight through the issue of they&#39;re a pain to get a hold of even pre covid. Any questions feel free to ask

I think what you have looks absolutely adorable.  I wouldn&#39;t bother trying to have anything adjusted unless you have functional problems.  If I ever get things done your kitty is pretty much what I would hope for after healing up!

Did you get the Penile Inversion or skin graft?   You lost depth because you need to stretch the skin in the canal?

They did penile inversion with a graft using the tunica vaginalis. So no additional grafts necessary.
</p>
<p>
And yes I lost depth from slacking on dilation at my 6 or 7 month mark. But yes it just involves trying to stretch things back out however it could also be permanently lost.

Tbh I know some people say theirs feel different. But I&#39;ve also heard estrogen does that in it&#39;s own. Tbh mine still feels like it did pre hrt. So it may just be a me thing because I was never super sexual or needing to orgasm so for me it was a slight disassocion

Feels like a typical male orgasm with associated pumping and single peak and it&#39;s over?  Not a more full-bodied orgasm?

Wow, Leeper, is that unexpected?  I’ve read about some who never orgasmed after surgery, just not that it didn’t change to a more full-bodied one.
</p>
<p>
Does this upset you, or not a big deal?
</p>
<p>
I guess I always figured things changed due to HRT and surgery.
</p>
<p>
I thank you for being so open and honest!

Yeah I&#39;ve always read people saying that estrogen changed their orgasm to that. Not in my case. Same with surgery. Nothing changed. So I dunno if it&#39;s just a me thing or maybe people over embellish?
</p>
<p>
But, I mean I went 5 years without one before now and really only started trying again as prep for surgery. But sexual interaction for me is kind of a non interest. So honestly it doesn&#39;t really bother me. Which also could be why the orgasm didn&#39;t change. I&#39;ve never been in touch with my body really and always had to force myself to orgasm if that makes sense? Like it was a chore to accomplish not something to enjoy. So that could also be it. I will say as time has gone on I&#39;ve notice my clitoris continues to become more and more sensitive so that could also change.

I have tried all sorts of things to get to the fabled &#34;whole-body-orgasm&#34;, and, while I think I might have felt some weak tingles or feelings (every-once-in-a-while, one of my nipples will itch and feel funny, and if I lightly rub it, I start feeling tingles and a &#34;heat&#34; in my perineum area and down my legs...but it only lasts a few seconds, then...all goes numb).
</p>
<p>
Bought a Magic Wand, other wands and vibrators, and a slew of anal plugs, probes, vibrators, but don&#39;t really get any pleasure from any part of my body except the penile glans, and, despite my best efforts, and sometimes getting a feeling like I have to pee (which is supposed to be the build-up to a prostate orgasm)...I end up having a male-type orgasm.  Albeit nothing comes out, and the humping, thrusting, and pulsing (to push out the ejaculate) feelings have greatly minimized.  My orgasms seem greatly diminished, too.
</p>
<p>
I do get a bit of pre-cum, not a lot, and I can do external prostate massage on my perineum close to my anus, and feel some pleasant feelings...no real joy.
</p>
<p>
I think the key is to get your prostate involved, and that should start me on my way to rewiring for a whole-body orgasm...but try as I might, it just won&#39;t wake up.
</p>
<p>
I guess I can understand if you have a low interest in sex or pleasuring yourself, that it can lead to orgasms not changing--but I think this is the first time I&#39;ve read of this still happening after bottom surgery, and I have to be honest, makes me a little scared.
</p>
<p>
I thought I would already be well on my way, after 40 months of MTF HRT, to new feelings, new ways to orgasm, sensitive nipples, etc.  But...nothing (hopefully, just yet).
</p>
<p>
But, I am thinking I&#39;ll want to delay having surgery until I can get to that point.  I&#39;m not terribly dysphoric about my penis at this time, so...won&#39;t be too much of a big deal to delay a few years.
</p>
<p>
Again, thanks for your honesty and viewpoint!!
