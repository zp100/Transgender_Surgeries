<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EmmaLake/comments/muhz48/gcs_surgery_by_dr_sidhbh_gallagher_prerevision/">This happened to me.</a>
Wound dehiscence started around PO+8. You&#39;ll have to see how your surgeon deals with this as they take a wide variety of intervention from not doing anything, to tossing you right back on the OR table.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re surgeon says it will heal through Second Intention. Then make sure you know Exactly what that means. It&#39;s not something you can just brush off. It will have a big impact on your recovery time.

Yeah. I&#39;m still have a large amount of drainage from it. Not sure if one caused the other: large amount of drainage caused the tissue to be stretched too thin or just the open would is causing the drainage.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t have known anything was happening except I was looking down and saw a large amount of fluid come down. Wife said she tried to warn me I was in the wrong spot but couldn&#39;t get the words out.  Likely nearly anything would&#39;ve caused this to rupture

It&#39;s hard to tell what caused it to rupture from the picture. I have a sensitivity to VICRYL sutures that causes mine. They start blowing up my wound at about 8-9 days out. Needless to say, everyone gets that heads up before any surgery happens these days.
</p>
<p>
So, did you get it checked out?
</p>
<p>
I just cringe looking at that image. It brings up terrible memories for me. My surgeon didn&#39;t do anything to intervene. She had the nerve to tell me that intervening would be a rookie mistake.

My wife was looking at it yesterday and says it looks like it&#39;s healed itself. Maybe the earlier pics still showed the other tissues swollen she&#39;s over swelling went down things came together better. Idk

I was trying to flush out my vagina in the shower and the tip of the device must have touched the wall of the labia. It was likely full of fluid and tore. I sent pics up to the clinic and the nurse said he&#39;s reviewer them and doesn&#39;t seen too concerned

That’s scary, did you’re surgeon tell you to use the shower head? I wouldn’t have dared stick anything inside me so early, even dilating scared me incase I cause something to tear

Shower head? I used the shower to gentle irrigate the area, then the cleaner is like a douche to get inside the canal. Though the applicator really doesn&#39;t have enough depth. I&#39;ve been able to use it several times since the accident and the area is healing good, I guess

Yes, I&#39;m pretty aware of such things having been through something similar. I&#39;m just wondering what the plan is since the nurse doesn&#39;t seem too concerned and you understand that the tissue doesn&#39;t just reattach? I know it&#39;s only one picture, but it seems worth addressing.

Wow best of luck with the recovery. I guess your surgery was pretty recent since the catheter is still in.

Surgery was on the 16th. They removed the original cath this Monday, but was so swollen I couldn&#39;t pee hardly at all. Due to have this one removed this coming Monday
