Why would I not have sensation in my clitoris? It doesn’t feel good at all. It’s also completely buried beneath skin with no part of it being visible. My labia are mostly numb. My depth and width and non-functional. I want to be able to orgasm so badly but nothing feels good. I have lost all sexual function. Is anything fixable? How horrible is a depth and width revision surgery if I’m starting from almost nothing? I want a reason to be optimistic. So far I deeply regret getting the surgery. My team at Denver Health hasn’t been the best to me either.

Revision are more common than you might think, Also sensation can take some time to return and everyone heals different - my biggest barrier has has been mentally accepting what I have now.
</p>
<p>
After I had my hernia repair surgery it took me almost 5 years to get full sensation back to the skin.
</p>
<p>
It can take a year for everything to level out.
</p>
<p>
I would ask your doctor about your clitoris, I am about 3 weeks out from my surgery but I knew with the first dilation in the hospital that I would need a revision which Is fine
</p>
<p>
These are things I can hopefully have addressed with a revision but I am trying to be optimistic and patient because as far as I know I will have to wait at least a year to be able to get a revision not to mention I may have to pay out of pocket which could take me several more to save up for.
</p>
<p>
Hang in there, you are not alone. You might want to reach out to Gynecologist about the sensation if you can&#39;t see the surgeon, alternatively I would recommend a Sexologist as they are specially trained to address the mental and even physical blocks that we are prone to after going through something big like surgery or a traumatic event.
</p>
<p>
You can also look into partner surogacy therapy or otherwise know as sexual surrogacy therapy which is basically a trained and certified professional who will work with you and a sexologist to potentially help address issues related to sexuality and your body.

I see my surgeon on Monday. They keep gaslighting me about it all. That the 8cm they gave me after putting in 15 cm is great! I just hate myself for doing this to myself. It doesn’t look good. It doesn’t feel good. My clitoris is completely buried and non visible. I’m so numb. I hate hating myself for this. I hate regretting it. 110 days since surgery and nothing is improving. My doctor made me believe granulation tissue was my clitoris for 3 months. They kept leaving it and finally removed it and it keeps growing back and it doesn’t feel good. I am set up with a revision which will cost me another 10 grand and come with more risks again. It’s costing me money. I want my life back. I can’t orgasm or feeel pleasure in any capacity. I’ve made a terrible mistake.

I cannot imagine what you must be going through, you are stronger than me for sure. Don&#39;t give up on yourself! These things happen sometimes and however unfortunate they may seem at first, when all the dust has settled I am sure you will look back and smile.
</p>
<p>
I hope all the best for you!
</p>
<p>
Remember there is not such thing as a perfect look, and no matter how bad things get there is always someone out there who has had it worse than you, what really matters is that you get yourself through this and don&#39;t focus on the bad.
</p>
<p>
I myself have been beaten by a gang of grown men when i was just 19 almost costing me my life and when I was clinging for my life ibrealized one thing, its not over until its over; I recognized there is no such thing as true darkness but instead the absence of light which is only temporary- there is so much more to life than just our sexuality regardless of what popular media will have you believe.
</p>
<p>
You will find a way, you have come this far..give it time and don&#39;t give up! I&#39;m rooting for you!!

You could get intestinal revision for depth and width.
