Poly clinic in Seattle? Was the procedure outpatient or aw Swedish? I‚Äôm scheduled to see Dr Nora at Virginia Mason for a consult. How did you feel about the whole experience. Not sure if my insurance would cover Poly Clinic.

This was outpatient, the first procedure was at Swedish. I also consulted with nuara, but went with Dr Liu both because of his use of 3d imaging planning and because at the time I called to make the appointment, he was literally brand new to his practice and I had the first round of surgery in less than a month from my call (His office is now booked out I believe around the same time as Nuara, FYI) I have Kaiser, if it helps clarify any concerns about coverage outright.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm very happy with dr Liu, I think he‚Äôs got an incredible eye for the details and really knows what it takes to feminize a face. That being said, he‚Äôs newer to his own practice. I say that not to belittle his skill, I think he‚Äôs incredibly skilled, just that he just hasn‚Äôt been performing surgery in his own practice for a decade like some Docs - which can come with its own downsides anyways. He‚Äôs also been incredibly responsive, has video called me several times since surgery to check in on healing, and generally seems to really care about the procedure and solving the needs of the trans community. I think he and hopefully up and coming docs like him are the future of FFS as a procedure.
</p>
<p>
Nuara I though was a perfectly fine option for me, and was fully ready to go through surgery with him had I not called and found out about dr Liu‚Äôs availability and had Nuaras schedule not been about a year out. I think I still would have chosen Dr Liu over nuara, if only because I care a lot about medicine and was okay with seeing what a younger surgeon fresh out of modern fellowship were capable of. There was just something enticing about working with someone at the start of their practice and learning about their technique and education that got to me.

Wow! I‚Äôm also w Kaiser and they told me Nuara (is that the right spelling? Huh.) was the only option in the seattle area. Did you have to go though any hoops to see Dr Liu? Kaiser definitely tries to funnel patients to their preferred (i.e. cheapest) providers. And I know Kaiser and Swedish have done battle in the past.

Dr Nuara was the only one they‚Äôd had as a dedicated ffs surgeon at the beginning of the year, as far as I know dr Liu was only added to Kaisers plans in September, maybe a bit before. So depending on when you called, that might have been true.

Do you specifically know how far out booked that is? Like 6 months? A year? I‚Äôm calling tomorrow, hoping it‚Äôs not super far out but willing to wait.

Not certain about timeline, but it depends on what you need and want done. I would guess 9 months to a year. A large procedure is going to be further booked out than a short one. I actually just today scheduled another lipotransfer breast augmentation with dr liu, and it was scheduled for two months from now (could have been sooner but I need to wait to heal more). That procedure is only an hour, so it was pretty easy to schedule. Generally he likes to do only one major procedure a day as far as I know, and both halves of my ffs took around 6 hours each.
</p>
<p>
In the grand scheme of things, a year is pretty standard, especially when you start comparing to other doctors like DB and keojampa. I believe they‚Äôre somewhere around 1.5-2 years right now?

I just got my consult scheduled for April and they said the likely wait time is 2-4 months depending on surgical complexity. :)

Congratulations on your FFS!  The results are fantastic.  You are quite passable.

I have also had FFS done with Dr. Liu and the results are fantastic.  I will be adding my own post here and join the chorus of praise for Dr. Liu üòä
