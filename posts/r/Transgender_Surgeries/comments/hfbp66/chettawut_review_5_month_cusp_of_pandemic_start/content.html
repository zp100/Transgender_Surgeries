<p>
Utility: 6.5&#34; depth (dilate one-two times a day) from ~4&#34; pre-op.
</p>
<p>
Appearance: Passable and I&#39;m very happy overall. My labia is slightly asymetrical, but I was circumsized and small.
</p>
<p>
Sensation: I have sensation, but have not found out how to orgasm.
</p>
<p>
Nerves: There is no nerve damage and I could sit comfortably without the donut pillow at ~2 months.
</p>
<p>
Surgery: Took 4 hours, but Chettawut will take as long as needs to for your surgery and he sleeps up until the surgery so he can give it his all, which I found flattering. He only does one per day, versus other surgeons doing multiple. I am 5&#39;6 and 110 lbs, so I think the vaginal canal placement was quicker because of having a spacious inside.
</p>
<p>
Dilation: There are 5 dilators ranging from 0-4. At this point, I use 1-3. My bf can fit find without me having ever graduated to 4 because my body is too tight, but I could use it if I had to. I use Sutil Luxe lube from SheVibe.com.
</p>
<p>
For the first 3 months, I dilated with a strict schedule for 50 min x 3 sessions. I now only dilate once or twice a day for an hour or so. I have gotten tighter but haven&#39;t lost depth at all.
</p>
<p>
Hormones: I now take less Estrodial and no more Spiro. I&#39;ve had severe fatigue since returning home and am trying to acquire a new Endo to figure it out currently, but it&#39;s not the surgeon&#39;s fault in any way.
</p>
<p>
Chettawut: The surgeon is so sweet and he has very functional English. Prepare your questions ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
Nurses: The nurses are very positive energy and are patient if you have trouble with dilating like I initially did.
</p>
<p>
Travel: Hardest part of the surgery! However, on my return trip from Bangkok to Seoul to Boston I did not bleed at all and lost no depth.
</p>
<p>
Discharge: None at this point, but it is based on my lube for me personally.
</p>
<p>
Self-Lubrication: Unsure, I always use lube for everything.
</p>
<p>
Urethra: Pee is in a straight line. Stopped spraying after the first month. Placed at the start of the canal.
</p>
<p>
Vaginal Canal: Penetration does not hurt and feels good, but there are not sensational nerves inside. I believe there is one hair inside, but it is not noticeable to feel.
</p>
<p>
Smell: Very subtle and pleasant, but I need to soak in a bath daily to feel full confident in that regard.
</p>

If you don‚Äôt mind me asking how much was the surgery itself. I know everyone‚Äôs price is different but I‚Äôm curious. And are you happier mentally now that it‚Äôs done?
