Answers to questions:
</p>
<p>
Sensation: She feels wonderful, clit and vagina are really nicely sensate. I&#39;m orgasm capable, especially with prostate/g-spot stimulation. Labia still has numb patches that are getting the burning nerve regeneration feeling. But it&#39;s not been a hindrance.
</p>
<p>
Depth: I can fit 5.5 inches,  though some seems to stick out if you pull my labia aside, however my nonop GF nor I have any complaints about this.
</p>
<p>
Complications: I have a fistula that has not yet been repaired. Dr. Freet did not see it during my exams, and a urologist caught it on cystoscopy (tmi: scope passed directly into my vagina instead of going towards bladder.) He isn&#39;t comfortable repairing it, but has a urologist he works with who is skilled in the repair.
</p>
<p>
Rating: She&#39;s a 9.5/10 not perfect, but better than before and I love her.

As for the doctor? I&#39;d say 8-9 out of 10. He didn&#39;t believe me about the fistula and argued it wasn&#39;t possible... take that as you will.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, he&#39;s super kind and did an amazing job with me. He also sedates patients to extract the vaginal packing and catheter.
</p>
<p>
He will insist you start with the largest dilator, but will ultimately tell you do what works for you.
</p>
<p>
The soulsource silicone dilators are kind of a blessing and a curse. If you&#39;re having a tight day it&#39;s like trying to force a wriggling cat into a carrier... when you&#39;re healing they&#39;re softer and tapered AND YOU CAN PUT THEM IN THE FREEZER! That was such a nice discovery, as it really soothes that angry sore feeling.

I like her. She&#39;s larger than some, because I asked for &#34;a happy medium&#34;.
