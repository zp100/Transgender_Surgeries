You should give yourself credit, you‚Äôve gone through such trauma, and here you are, stronger and open enough to talk about it. The future is out there for you, just go with it.

Your experience sounds a bit like the problems Jazz Jennings had with Bowers, in particular having started blockers early.

I thought of that too, but Jazz probably got better care because she‚Äôs a TV personality. Bowers has some pretty problematic views and OP‚Äôs experience sadly doesn‚Äôt surprise me.

She might have got better, but it was really bad. Bowers shouldn‚Äôt be doing surgery she‚Äôs not competent at.

In the meantime we can tell our stories in places like this and help others. Quite a few people have cancelled surgery after reading reviews on their surgeon.

You&#39;re not dramatic. You&#39;re pained and traumatized by a, let&#39;s admit it, big and traumatic experience. Even positive events can be traumatic in the moment and in the time following them - just look at post-partum depression.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re sharing your story. Everyone deals with stuff differently, and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here and dealing with it. Best of luck to you with your continued healing üôè

I think even a surgery that goes perfectly is traumatic to our mind and body and needs to be healed, but what you went through was even more intense! I‚Äôm so glad you made it through and are finding your joy. Your story doesn‚Äôt come off as being dramatic at all. Thank you for being strong and sharing it with us so that we can learn and grow from it. üíúü•∞

I was fortunate enough not to have any complications but I hadn&#39;t realised how traumatised I was by previous sexual experiences that made dilation impossible and here I am two years later with essentially no depth a lot of regrets. I wish there was more space to talk about these things on the internet. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re doing better üíú

I had similar complications and nightmares. I recently had a psychological evaluation for FFS and was diagnosed with a disorder related to the trauma/stress of vaginoplasty, but it wasn&#39;t PTSD (not sure why). It is the hardest thing I have ever been through. You&#39;re not being dramatic - you&#39;ve been through a lot. You&#39;ll get through this.
</p>
<p>
Anyone who is reading this and planning to go have SRS: clear the entire area with electrolysis beforehand if internal hair would bother you. Many surgeons will tell you it is unnecessary. That is because they aren&#39;t bothered by leftover hair.

Thank you for being so vulnerable and speaking of your story so honestly. I&#39;m so sorry that you had to go through all of that at 18 years old, that is terrifying. You are incredibly strong for getting through to this point, and I&#39;m so glad that you&#39;re still here and experiencing joy again! üíñ

Hi! thank you so much :) I hope that my story doesn&#39;t scare but rather helps give insight into how going into this surgery completely unprepared (I was definitely not ready) can make things very difficult. I wish you the best

gender really is so confusing. I&#39;ve learned to just tune out the world and tune into myself and express that however it looks without judging myself. I&#39;m honestly here for you. You can comment any questions you have or message me. Also I&#39;m happy to check in if/when you have your surgery &lt;3
</p>
<p>
things would&#39;ve gone wayyy better had it not been right when covid started and had I not had complications that doctors in TX couldn&#39;t help with. I couldn&#39;t travel bc covid and it was honestly just awful. Also I was not mentally prepared at all and I have no support system whatsoever

I am so sorry sweetheart. You are incredibly brave for going through that, I am dreading just thinking of the whole process and I&#39;m much older and &#34;battle hardened&#34; by life so you&#39;d think I&#39;m prepared. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be, just gotta jump in. Glad to hear you are doing better. If you haven&#39;t a therapist would do a lot of good helping process the trauma.

thank you for your sweet words! I&#39;m lucky to have a new but amazing therapist. I wish I had been more prepared for my surgery but please understand the point of me sharing this wasn&#39;t to scare anyone but rather serve as a insight to what can happen when you&#39;re not mentally prepared, especially for complications that happened in the pandemic. I was one of bowers&#39; last surgeries before covid
</p>
<p>
I know your surgery will go well. And I think had I really listened to my gut, I would&#39;ve known when I was ready-ish at least lol. My biggest regret is having no support system but covid just really was the icing on the cake. best of luck to you!

Im so sorry you (we) had to go through that. I&#39;ve had a seemingly slightly similar experience, i&#39;m a little more than a year post-op and have pretty lost hope for a better life so i&#39;m happy you have gotten better. It gives me a little hope atleast.

Glad you are still here and now thriving. Surgery is a complex thing. Due to pelvic radiation I couldn&#39;t get a vaginoplasty. I had to settle for a vulvoplasty. I would go through what you have ten times to have the one thing I desired and needed. I&#39;m married to a wonderful man and was looking forward to all the possibilities.  It made me suicidal again to be told that. Every year I ask him if it&#39;s possible to have it. Each year the doctor says no. This year it didn&#39;t make me suicidal. You aren&#39;t being dramatic. We expect doctors to be on their A game especially in surgery. We should expect  their results to be acceptable. While complications can happen they should take every effort to give the best outcome.  You have come out stronger and a better person. Once again so glad you are here to share your story.

I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;ve been treated like being dramatic... you clearly aren&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
I had to get through many many ignorant dumbfucks and silly people in my aftercare,  I were completely mistreated and misunderstood even by my few friends.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m back from all that BS but I remember the three W&#39;s: who said what &amp; when.
</p>
<p>
One thing is major surgery.  Another thing is that,  plus complications.  And another thing is not being helped/ believed by the people who supposedly work to take care of you.
</p>
<p>
Wish you the best life can offer...
</p>
<p>
Be kind to yourself üôèüí™

Did they think you were going to self harm with a medical dilator?  It sounds like psych wards are still about as kind to trans people as they were in the 70s.   I don&#39;t think the best of the best providers end up working in those places.  I hope to never see the inside of one, so sorry you did.

Yes that was exactly what they were thinking after I explained it wasn‚Äôt that I just had to have a sex toy, which is what they thought at first. It was a very surreal experience
