They told me when I woke up that things went extraordinarily well for my surgery. Seeing my face that first day was a weird experience, I just had to go, okay, that&#39;s my bloated recovery face, no comment.
</p>
<p>
Ranganathan was really wonderful, as was her entire team. Everyone was really nice and also really energetic, which was great because in the month leading up to surgery, my outlook was kind of dismal. I remember when I was egg cracking, it was photos of FFS that helped me say, &#34;oh my god, this is amazing! I want this!&#34; And, I knew before I was even voicing loudly and confidently about HRT that by-gone-it, this girl was gonna have FFS and GCS at all costs. And the desire for FFS continued. I let HRT do it&#39;s thing for a year, and then began making calls and I thought, in another 3-6 months it&#39;ll be mine! And, then it turned into an arduous 18 months of fighting everything. Consults months away, then we don&#39;t take your insurance, oh new change, or we will take your insurance just give us 3 months, oh sorry, we were wrong still don&#39;t take it. Oh, we will, but you have to do the legwork of dealing with your provider. On and on and then the consults came and when I went back to the budget, with my current insurance it would cost me $15k and I didn&#39;t have $15k to spend. So, I made the tough choice to leave a job that I truly did enjoy simply because I knew if I moved from education to medical field for IT, the insurance would likely be stellar. And, stellar it was, I just had this procedure for, let me check... $0. I fought and fought and I made some huge life changes to make this all possible and while I still miss my old job (heck, the 8 weeks paid vaca was such a nice perk!) I don&#39;t mind this job and working to help doctors on a regular basis with IT issues is certainly a bit rewarding.
</p>
<p>
That said, I had spent nearly 2 years gunning for this, feeling at times like it would never happen, because of my insurance or because frankly, some doctors don&#39;t even get back to you about a damn consult! And, when they finally set that date, I didn&#39;t have to fight anymore. But, something else happened, I started second guessing myself. Did I need this? Would I be happy? In fact, the last month leading up to the procedure I had 100% convinced myself that this would not be an impactful surgery and while I&#39;d still go through with it, just expect your life to be status quo. This procedure is not going to deliver results to you. It probably only does for trans women who had a chance to begin with. I told myself, I&#39;m 38, unless I&#39;d been genetically lucky or had a feminine face beforehand, there was only so much that could be done for me, so don&#39;t get your hopes up, this is a pointless procedure. So, why still go through with it? I asked that a lot. But, eventually I was like, eh, it&#39;ll be a little something and ultimately we put all this energy into it, so might as well see it through.
</p>
<p>
Day One out of surgery I spent the night in the hospital, very much in and out. I told my sister I&#39;d text her after the procedure, but even though I was up at 6p, I didn&#39;t message her until 8p, because I tried typing two words and was like, I give up. And, that starts a trend of the one thing I wasn&#39;t prepared for, how easily overwhelmed I&#39;d get. I remember lots of &#34;what have I done?&#34; Every time I&#39;d want to just start crying because some simple task was in front of me, I was like, uh oh, this is bad, this is very bad.
</p>
<p>
The one part of the procedure they had made a mistake on was the catheter, which they described as &#34;traumatic&#34;. Let&#39;s just say I don&#39;t want to know any further, nor do I want any details ever. All I knew is that after I came to, they got a IV fluids in me and had me drink water and lord, did I drink water. They wanted me to try to walk to the bathroom later to try and pee and all of that. In retrospect the following story is funny, but at the time, nope. They sat me down on that toilet and left me to it and well, first off the auto-flush was faulty so it just repeatedly flushed, flush, flushed and spraying water up at me. I&#39;m trying to pee, but because of catheter incident I can&#39;t and what little did attempt burned like the surface of the sun, and then my nose started leaking like a firehose and so here I am, toilet spraying me, burning, bleeding from my face and I just started crying and screamed, &#34;Please, get me the hell out of here!&#34; We got back and they said they had no choice but to reinsert catheter and I&#39;ll be honest, reading countless stories from those of you who have had GCS or from my dad who needed a catheter during prostate surgery, or just countless folks, everyone says it&#39;s awful. So, one of my biggest fears for future GCS was the catheter. And, when they told me I&#39;d need one now, I felt panicked. However, I&#39;m so glad to have gone through both the insertion and removal because I&#39;m no longer scared of it. That was a cake walk as far as I&#39;m concerned. Sure, it sucks, but it&#39;s also brief and everything gets real &#34;oh, fuck, oh fuck!&#34; for like 5 seconds and then just a complete return to baseline. I can deal with that.
</p>
<p>
As for my results, first day I didn&#39;t even bother to look. Second day I looked but was such a marshmallow I just said, ok, moving on. But as swelling went down, I started to worry I&#39;d made a huge mistake. Sure, they say that swelling peaks day 2-3, but day 2 at 6a my right eye was swollen shut and by 10a it had completely reopened for me. The mistake I felt I&#39;d made was seeing these feminine features on what to me seemed like a huge head and I worried that this was what I had to look forward to, that your head is just so large you&#39;ll always have this oversize head with hastily etched femme features on it. But, by day 4-5 I realized that I have no concept of my face due to some dysmorphia, so I&#39;m seeing my head unusually large due to swelling and thinking, no that&#39;s my usual face with minor swelling. But, in reality, my head is much smaller than I give it credit for. I thought I was condemned to pillow face, that&#39;s what I thought. But, with each passing day I&#39;m realizing that&#39;s not the case at all.
</p>
<p>
Now, back to how I had started feeling like this wouldn&#39;t matter. Well, news flash, I&#39;m 5 days post-op and already this is now becoming hugely impactful. Things haven&#39;t even settled yet and what I see emerging is just so incredible. And I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t take last month to have gone so far as to talk myself out of it entirely, because it&#39;s wonderful.
</p>
<p>
I have had scalp advancement for hairline lowering, front sinus setback, supraorbital bar burring and contouring, brow lift, open rhinoplasty, and fat grafting to cheeks and lips. This is stage one for me, in 3-4 months I go back for the jaw work.
</p>
<p>
The fat grafts currently feel weird because they&#39;re not yet part of the surrounding tissue and feel kinda lumpy. The forehead is not reattached to the skull, so the skin feels kinda just there. Overall though, I currently have no feeling from top of my head to eyebrows. This will return in time. The nose by far has been the worst part of this. I hate it and I will say that while at the time I would have wanted a single procedure for face, in the end I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t. I said before my tolerance for being overwhelmed is incredibly low and if I had to deal with nose and jaw right now, I&#39;d be in a very depressed state. I am not at all the type of person who can fall asleep breathing through their mouth and while the first night in the hospital was fine, I had clear airways all night, slept like 10 hrs. The second night I slept in 2 hour intervals all day because I couldn&#39;t sleep at night with the nose being so clogged up. It&#39;s like being sick and your airways are blocked, I don&#39;t sleep when I get sick like that. It has been brutal and while the worst of it was day 2-3, since then for me it likes to play a game of &#34;I&#39;ll be clear all day, but right at bedtime I&#39;m going to clog up.&#34; A lifesaver was buying 2 bottles of nasal spray and using that to help flush nose, since you can&#39;t blow your nose (my surgeon said about 2 weeks) so it helps, but still sometimes you spend 15 mins going to town and still come back with very poor breathing through nose. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it! Fortunately it is better, but currently I sleep about 6 hrs at night and then between 9-noon get more rest. I usually wake up to pee in the morning and my face is all puffy, nose stuffed, I&#39;m cotton-mouth as fuck! I need to just get up, let my face clear up, hydrate, then sleep more. And, I&#39;ll say, I take heavy duty sleeping pills nightly because of horrendous lifelong insomnia, so the fact I wake up at 6a is a testament to how shit it can be.
</p>
<p>
Pain has been manageable throughout. The worst experience by far was the drive home. And, that made me so scared for the drive after release from the hospital with GCS. Everyone describes that badly. So, the fact that we left after FFS and the drive was awful made me even more scared for GCS. Every bump, no matter how small, caused gravity to move my swollen face, every turn, the sunlight bothered me, then we ended up in stop and go traffic and that was awful, especially when some car would decide to change lanes and cause my friend to brake, I wished to hop out of the car and go ape shit on the person cutting in. Eventually I needed the car stereo turned off and for her to just not talk to me because it was an all out sensory overload assault. I felt so incredibly nauseous.
</p>
<p>
I was given oxycodone and told to take that, then 4hrs later a tylenol, then 4hrs later oxy, then... you get the picture. They told me on day 4 I could start taking aspirin and it would help with the swelling. Indeed, the aspirin has been amazing! And, little dark secret from my past, 7 years ago I got clean of a heroin addiction. To say everyone in my life has expressed concern over being prescribed oxy is an understatement. Oxy is where my opiate addiction started until it was just cheaper to buy heroin. On the 4th day taking the oxy, when I switched to aspirin, I initially thought I&#39;d do aspirin and oxy, aspirin and oxy, but by the end of the day I removed the oxy altogether and on day 5, I flushed the remainder of it, strictly relying on the aspirin and tylenol for pain management. To say that I am shocked that I chose aspirin over oxy... well... no, I&#39;m just shocked. And, it really made me proud of how far I&#39;ve come in my life that I would choose in that fashion.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to add pictures, but as I&#39;m not even a week yet and still feeling blah, I&#39;ll update this post with pictures come the weekend and thereafter.

: I&#39;m back to post again, I wish I had come back sooner. But, I had to kind of wrestle with my new face and how it changed. I was over the moon, then it would change and I&#39;d be blah, then back again.
</p>
<p>
Recovery after that first week steadily got better. I took a week off work and did one week WFH, but in retrospect, I would have preferred 2 weeks off. I&#39;d suddenly get really tired or easily fatigued, so even with WFH, it&#39;s not like the company-at-large knows you had a major surgery, so no one&#39;s gonna take it easy on you and even if you&#39;re like, &#34;hey, just had a major surgery and not feelin&#39; so hot.&#34; It&#39;s like, &#34;Oh, gosh, sorry to hear that... anyway, are you gonna fix my problem?&#34; My notion of just hanging back and occasionally grabbing the low hanging fruit was unrealistic. I should have taken at least a full 2 weeks and then a week WFH, because then that 3rd week back in office wasn&#39;t particularly great either. You feel much better, but by 2p you might start to drag. I mean, for some perspective, my desk is one of those standing desks, so you can sit or raise it to stand. Prior I&#39;d stand up at my desk a couple days a week for like 6hrs. At week 5 I felt great, better than great. So, I decided to stand at my desk and I only managed it for 90 mins before I felt kinda light headed. By 7 weeks, I was 100% I bounced back great. Now, my friend had hers the same week with a different surgeon and at 9 weeks she&#39;s still feeling the effects.
</p>
<p>
Another reason I wish I had taken off 3 weeks is because she did not want me washing my hair until the stitches were removed. And at 3 weeks, my hair and scalp were disgusting. So, I had to go to work like that. I ended up buying one of those floppy beanies that holds all your hair. As for that, I remember getting my stitches out with so much excitement, I practically raced home to wash my hair. Only for me to end up bawling my eyes out for like an hour because in those 3 weeks, my hair had become so matted, knotted, damaged, that I was stood in the shower like dumping an entire bottle of conditioner on it and it still felt like a dread lock. I freaked, thinking I&#39;d have to cut it all, 3 yrs of growth, jealousy inducing curls, all gone! The next day I regrouped, got into my bath tub and ended up using 3 bottles of the slickest conditioner I own and just slowly massaged it all out, often laying back in the tub with my head partially underwater so I could use my hair being suspended by the water to help untangle knots. I still had to cut out some particularly awful areas, but it was largely salvaged after 3 hours. I learned after the fact that had my hair been braided, I might have avoided all of that.
</p>
<p>
Ok, face, face, face. End of week 2 I got nose brace off and for like a few hours I saw my future nose before the absence of the brace caused my nose to swell way up. Also, without said brace suddenly my nose, up to between my eyebrows, was really achy and painful. I had stopped taking advil/tylenol by this point, but had to start again because for like a week or two it was rough. Even wiping away water from your eyes in the shower could induce a headache.

I didn&#39;t get an immediate picture, so nose already swollen. But, it was probably here I started struggling with my results. For a while I couldn&#39;t pinpoint it, but a trans friend said to me, &#34;you liked your swollen face more because it rounded it off&#34; And, I was like, yeah, that&#39;s... that&#39;s exactly it! Trust me vacillating on liking/hating my results was constant from this stage on. So, too, was post-op depression, which lasted probably 2 weeks.
</p>
<p>
My hair prior to a good wash concealed the shock loss. Which, isn&#39;t bad, but I look forward to regrowth.

I have fewer overall from when my post-op depression started and then my constant back and forth on hating my results.
</p>
<p>
These were taken now at about 2.1 months post-op Also at the bottom is a picture I took right before surgery, so clearly the results are staggering even if I have nitpicks. Most of all I went from a fivehead to a forehead, lol.  Nose is obviously still swollen, as it will be frankly for the better part of a year, I&#39;m sure.

My feelings as of today are that I&#39;m overall pleased. I still plan to return for chin work next year after my GCS is good and recovered fully. It&#39;s odd, but I often like my profile more than head-on, I don&#39;t know what it is, but I have this feeling of being masculine still head-on. Am I far and away improved? 100% Does what&#39;s been done make me feel better with myself and out in the world, yes, overall. I just kind of think when I go for chin, I&#39;m going to book a bunch of consults and shop around because I&#39;d like to have the opportunity to ask if there&#39;s more other surgeons could do to just make me feel that tiny bit better about my face. Also, at 2 months, the worst thing hands down is my scalp itching where it&#39;s numb. At this stage, behind the scar to the middle of my head is still numb, though there are signs of improvement, but the phantom itches are ugh. At home, a small vibrator along my temples and scar help greatly to diminish phantom itching, but at work, I&#39;ve found tapping my fingers along my temples for some reason soothes the itch as well. The scar is healing remarkably well.
</p>
<p>
During my 1 month appointment with Ranganathan I discussed chin a bit. I told her, however, that it&#39;s my goal to lose about 30lbs prior to my GCS and she said it would be best to do chin after weight loss, otherwise you may get skin sagging on your neck as a result.

Thanks! I just wanted to make this post as this is not a well-known surgeon, but for a lot of people like me searching for surgeons in New England, I figured it would help. I had for a time formed a loose group of people going to this surgeon and sharing info, because we all wanted it, but there was so little for us to go on.

I was Dr Ranganathan&#39;s second gender affirming surgery ever. She literally changed my life, and genuinely saved me. It&#39;s really amazing to read about your experience.

By the way, I have a promo code with a MedSpa that I partner with for filler if you ever want feminizing dermal filler. After my 12.5 hour ffs with Dr. Ranganathan, I had a little bit of sagging in my neck because of some weight loss prior to my tracheal shave, and I just get filler there and it tightens it right up. The fat grafting didn&#39;t stay, so I do filler in my lips, cheeks, and chin. I would love to hear more about your results.

Hi! Has anyone else gone to this surgeon? OP, is there any chance you can connect me with some others who have seen her? The only other review I&#39;ve seen is very negative and I&#39;m very nervous. I&#39;ve been through the consult process and booked the surgery for this spring, but I want to make sure I&#39;m making the right decision before the date rolls around.

Not that I know of. She&#39;s rather new to this, so it&#39;s possible she has some earlier patients unhappy. And, I have read the negative review and I don&#39;t want to invalidate her experience, but a lot in it seemed entirely opposite mine. Like, everyone in the hospital during my stay gendered me correctly, was helpful, and polite. I haven&#39;t seen results posted, so I don&#39;t know. I think everyone experiences things differently and have a different expectation for service, care, and so on. I&#39;m pretty go with the flow.
</p>
<p>
That all said, I know this is a really scary process. Heck, I had the procedure, loved my results, then read that negative review and started second guessing my own results. It&#39;s definitely scary going in and not seeing others who have gone through it. When I did it, she had no other results to show me, now I&#39;m part of her fledgling look-book, so clearly she&#39;s growing in this area. And that should be taken into consideration.
</p>
<p>
In the end, everything is highly variable too. I just had GCS and my results day one look like I&#39;m 8 months healed. I had zero pain, dilation is easy, no wounds developed at the surgical site, and my results are ideal. Now, I didn&#39;t know this at the time, but my skin is highly elastic, so my surgeon said she had so much material to work with and because it&#39;s so elastic, I developed no wounds. I&#39;ve seen other folks going through this process, &#34;I&#39;m in pain&#34; &#34;dilation hurts&#34; &#34;I have wounds&#34;. Read comments in any reddit post and it&#39;s a mix of &#34;it was a breeze&#34; to &#34;it was the worst pain of my life&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, make an informed decision. After my consult with her, I spent the next few months constantly worrying if I made the right decision. Even for my GCS, I had my consult, then every single post-op post on reddit made me go, &#34;oh shit, should I go to that surgeon?&#34; Then, I&#39;d look up that surgeon and there&#39;d be 10 photos where half were great results and the other half were not so great.
</p>
<p>
In the end, it&#39;s kind of a gamble. I heard a youtuber I watch recently say, &#34;If I have to gamble with my genitals, I want to gamble with a good surgeon.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I know maybe my &#34;it&#39;s a gamble&#34; or &#34;it&#39;s up to what the surgeon has to work with&#34; is scary, but I hope it helps to also remember that this entire process is a big one and the anxiety and worry leading up to it is okay too. I had to at some point say, &#34;I made a good choice on surgeon, I did my research, and when I wake up, I could either love it or hate it. And that&#39;s okay.&#34;
