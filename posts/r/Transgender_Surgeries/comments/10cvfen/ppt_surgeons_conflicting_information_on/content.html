Hi there,
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m considering PPT/PPV for bottom surgery. Personally, the only benefit of this technique which draws me over the Penile Inversion technique is the possibility for self-lubrication. However, the 2 prominent surgeons doing this surgery, Dr. Min Jun and Dr. Wittenberg provides contrasting information regarding self-lubrication, which makes me quite confused. Basically, Dr. Min Jun does not believe the peritoneal lining could give you lubrication when it is exteriorized. Dr. Wittenberg claimed the lining could produce natural lubrication for some patients. If someone could further explain this or share their experience regarding lubrication if they got PPT, that would be greatly appreciated!
</p>
<p>
Here are what the surgeons said:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dr. Min Jun:
</strong>

</a>
</p>
<p>
&#34;The peritoneum flap is an internal organ, and when we exteriorize it, it kind of takes on some of the characteristics of other external tissues and it kind of of loses that slippery epithelium characteristic. &#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;It&#39;s secretory, but not so much so that it&#39;s able to give you lubrication. &#34;
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dr. Heidi Wittenberg:
</strong>

</a>
</p>
<p>
&#34;Most of our patients do have a little bit of watery yellowy discharge that requires 1-2 panty liner a day.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Thank you
</p>

The meaning of “lubrication” can also differ. It seems like these surgeons are referring to this lubrication as “moisture secreted by the lining.” which is intended to be comparable (though distinctly different from) moisture secreted by the vaginal lining (the natal vagina is a mucosal membrane whereas to e peritoneal tissue is a serous membrane). From a sex standpoint, lubrication tends to refer to the thicker discharge produced by the glands near the entrance to the vagina like from the Skene’s glands. The PPT lubrication is a light/thinner fluid that occurs continuously — it doesn’t increase during foreplay, tends to be produced internally vs in the front for the natal vagina, and is of lower volume and a different consistency. It’s important to consider what you’re looking for — PPT will likely give you a vagina moist to the touch but not necessarily lubrication to the level of sex without added lube in most cases

Min Jun does peritoneal cap on a scrotal graft and Wittenberg does full peritoneal. Immediately post op it will produce way more discharge than it will a year plus later, but the amount of tissue used also factors in here.

Part of this journey is not gettin hangups on the moisture aspect..,,
</p>
<p>
One……Yes youll still use lube. For sex and dialation. Totally normal cuz lotta cis women use it.
</p>
<p>
Two……its the other benefits of ppt or pfv that youre not connecting with. You maintain a slightly higher ph than pi alone. And much better microbiome vaginally cuz of it. This equates to better natural smell overall.
</p>
<p>
Three……you can get away with less douching. You still douche. But like you dont get the smegma like materials that can come with pi.
</p>
<p>
Four……pi canals can dry out. I know lots of older women who had thai surgeries. They report dryness and that messes with yur smell and microbiome.
</p>
<p>
Five.,,vulva aesthetics. Ppt and pfv are great for those who dont have much tissue for pi. You get a more 3d look……not looking like a slit with no labia minora. Personally that looks clockable

Honestly I just carry a tiny thing of lube in my purse, I have enough self lubrication to feel decent about myself but honestly no one has ever brought any focus to my use of lube beforehand.  I would love to read information from women who have had other surgery types. I&#39;m pretty sure mine was a penile inversion? It was done by marci Bowers years back and it&#39;s slipped my mind tbh

I can understand the inclination towards insecurity. But it&#39;s truly nothing to spend too much time overthinking.  Honestly if any man were to give you any flack over taking self care then they don&#39;t deserve the time with you to begin with.

My ppt (full peritoneal) coming up on 3mo post, produces a watery fluid that is insufficient for sex.  Still need lube.

Sister and sex-shop worker here; to couple&#39;s, I sell lube more than anything else, even cis women that don&#39;t have issues with vaginal dryness purchase lube for PIV intercourse because sexual secretions of any kind become sticky over time especially with excessive friction or air contact. Use of lubricants prevents &#34;vaginosis&#34; symptoms that are typically just stretching and friction pains and not a clinical issue. This occurs with anal as well. PH or internal acidity also affects these issues. From personal experience and testimony, intercourse of any kind lasting longer than 15 minutes lubricant becomes an ideal tool for a better experience both during and afterwards! So even if you have a sigmoid procedure, chances are you would still benefit from lube in your life!

The peritoneal will offer moisture. Not necessarily “lubricant” although it is slippery, it won’t be enough for intercourse. It does keep everything from being dry like the inversion when it’s recommended to use a moisture substitute to keep things moist. Lube will have to be used. The full peritoneal can offer too much moisture causing many patients to have to wear a pad most of the time. The hybrid which is a combination of inversion offers a little moisture yet not too much.

I had my surgery with Dr Jun In August and like another poster said only the back wall or cap of the canal is made out of the peritoneal tissue, I have not had PIV sex but it does secret a lot of discharge to the point it’s annoying sometimes I have to change pads 2-3 day and another one at night.
</p>
<p>
It’s only been 4 months and I’ve heard discharge decreases so I can’t wait for that but i also wonder if it’ll become dry down there at some point.
</p>
<p>
Also I don’t think the discharge or secretion feels “lubricating” I think I will still end up using lube.

All surgeons have complications. For example, Wittenberg talked about how her PPT patients had a higher rate of vaginal stenosis than her PI patients because the former wrongly believed that they could get away with less frequent dilation. Rate if complications does differ a lot by surgeon, and surgeon experience matters much more than technique arguably. But, there is more inherent risk with PPT than PI given that the former enters the abdominal cavity and lacks long term data whereas the latter does not

Is your want of lubrication for PIV sex? the majority of cis women require lube for sex. While you may get more lubrication from PPT as opposed to PI (although I know of women who secreted a lot of pre cum before surgery who have PI and still secrete a good amount) for both you will most likely need lube unless the guy suffers from premature ejaculation.

I imagine a lot of cis women can have sex without lube in the way that I can as a postop trans woman: it works, but it would probably be a lot better with lube. Just a lot of men, especially men my age, don’t really care or know enough to use it?
</p>
<p>
I heard the majority benefiting from lube comment echoed from an older cis guy I hooked up with, and I don’t think he was just protecting my feelings given some other comments he made.
