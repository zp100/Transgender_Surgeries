does anyone have experience with dr james bellringer??
</p>
<p>
i‚Äôm hoping to get srs in the next year and ideally i‚Äôd go to thailand with dr bank because i really like his aesthetics. however, the thought of flying to a country ive never been to on my own is terrifying, and the thought of flying back in a lot of pain after the operation is even more terrifying. due to this ive been exploring my options and i feel as though a uk based surgeon is going to be my only choice. i contacted bellringer and he said that i could have the surgery around 3 months from now and the price is ¬£15,000, which is basically the same price as thailand would cost me. the thing is, ive read a lot of things about bellringer and some sound good but some sound extremely scary and i‚Äôm not sure what to think, even more so because i can hardly find any photos. i just wondered if anyone else has experience with him in the past and if so would you recommend him? or is it worth me going to thailand? i just feel very in the dark despite doing hours and hours of research.

I would not go in for a doctor that I thought sounded &#34;extremely scary&#34; in any way period.  Certainly not one for whom I cannot find many good pictures.  This is too important for you to &#34;maybe&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully someone is able to chime in with info for you.  It should take a lot of very convincing info to pull you back from &#34;scary&#34;. Good luck sis.

I had my surgery with him almost 3 months ago. I had a quite pleasant experience overall, and post op he and Laura the nurse has been great at answering questions.  The stay at the hospital was fine, I never was in too much pain and the staff was very nice and caring. I went there alone and I would honestly go there again, also the food is great üòç  With the surgery result im somewhat happy, it could be nicer looking I guess, but the recovery has been quick and i have not had any major problems just a bit of dehiscense that is healed now.  Aesthetics-wise it is quite a minimal look i would say, small inner lips and a clitoris that is small and hidden. The scars are quite prominent still, but they shoild fade nicely. I can send pictures if you want.

I went to Bellringer a few months ago. Hospital stay was ok, not great but not bad either, and the food is very good. I was very happy to be able to be seen easily either by him or by the specialist nurse as needed and for minor treatments. Functionality wise, I&#39;m very happy. Aesthetics are pretty good for me, within the normal range of variability. He has a style, as every surgeon has, so make sure his style fits with your expectations. Same goes with any surgeon you will decide to go for. The recovery has been basically trouble free, which was an important point for me when choosing a surgeon. I&#39;d suggest to have a consultation directly with him, ask as many questions as you can and ask to see pics at different stages of recovery.  There are other surgeons that are very good in UK, so check them out as well.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion he is one of the best in EU, and I&#39;d go back to him at any time, but that&#39;s me. As always, surgery experiences and outcomes varies, so, I&#39;d suggest you do your research before picking a surgeon. If you don&#39;t trust somebody 100%, it&#39;s going to be a problem. You do need to trust both the surgeon AND the recovery/aftercare as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask

Yes. I had my GRS at Parkside in November 2020. My experiences below, but overall very happy with the entire process and result.

I had a vaginoplasty with Bellringer. Suffered dehiscence, granulation and nerve damage but it looks ok, I&#39;m still in pain 8 weeks later.
</p>
<p>
Pain wise I was in agony and feel traumatised by the days following surgery due to lack of pain relief and people not listening to me and belittling me.
</p>
<p>
Several weeks later I have been diagnosed with PTSD and Depression. I definitely wouldn&#39;t do it again. All for the lack of adequate pain relief.

Having a surgeon I could just get in the car and drive to see was a blessing for me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had several follow up consults during my recovery. X

Talk with both. Discuss what your priorities are, and see what they feel would be right for you. Ask as many questions as you can and that&#39;ll help. X

im so sorry that‚Äôs happened to you :( i haven‚Äôt really heard much at all about dr kamol but the only reason i want to go to thailand is because i love the work of dr suporn/bank more than any ive seen, not because it‚Äôs cheap. however i would feel a lot safer and less anxious going to the us because it feels more familiar to me than thailand, but i cant see myself being able to afford that for years and years :(

You know its an irrational fear? There&#39;s lot of others who do it alone at your age, although of course many who do have support. The need for support drops off as you get older though. You could always wait a few years, get some travel in perhaps. Surgery is for life, and give it time and you won&#39;t even remember a few years here or there from when you were 20 - trust me on that one.
