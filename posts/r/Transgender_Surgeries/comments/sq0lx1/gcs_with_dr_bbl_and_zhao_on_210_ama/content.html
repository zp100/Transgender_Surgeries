As the title says, just had GCS with them and their team. Ask me anything!
</p>
<p>
Some Notable points below: The staff is absolutely amazing!
</p>
<p>
Private room after getting out of the recovery area is super nice.
</p>
<p>
The one thing I was not prepared for was the gas pain.  I have a high pain tolerance, but I&#39;ve been in tears more than once from it.
</p>
<p>
Post op in personal room.

Update!!!
</p>
<p>
Day 2: Gas pain 90% gone.  Up and walking around.  Made a lap around the entire floor in assisted (yes a nurse was with me but didn&#39;t need help).  The forced thigh gap is real while trying to walk.  It also feels like a super super tight tuck currently for all the other aspects.  I can infact feel my clitoris.  So I&#39;m already thrilled about having sensation there.  Even though it is NOT pleasurable as of yet.  Lots of burning.
</p>
<p>
Sitting is a challenge due to the packing.  It adds a lot of preasure which is less than pleasant.  Bouts of nausea are a thing that are rough, but the meds help.  Although they leave me a bit light headed after.  The vegi-burger is not recommended for a meal.  Pretty sure it was just drowned in Italian seasoning.  I learned so you didn&#39;t have too! Lol
</p>
<p>
Day 3: Breakfast has never tasted so good.  Finally have some form of appetite back.  No real pain anywhere as of yet, yay!  Discomfort from the packing still makes sitting less than enjoyable, but can deal with it without medication.  After breakfast a leisurely stroll around the floor twice unassisted.  It&#39;s really nice to get up and walk around.  Crazy how yesterday walking was semi awkward, but today felt natural.  The staff wants a lap at least 4x today and I&#39;m all for it!
</p>
<p>
Day 4:  Dressing removed and first look at new equipment.  I&#39;m all the emotions about it.  OMG!!!  She is very angry looking currently, but I&#39;m so freaking happy!!! Today is just more walking and sitting.  Shower is a thing that will be happening finally.  Tired of looking like a Cheeto over 1/2 of my body.
</p>
<p>
Kevin stopped by and we went over the bag of wonders contents and dilation steps to be implemented tomorrow and going forward.
</p>
<p>
Catheter will be removed tonight around 10pm.  Tomorrow is packing removal and dilation before they discharge.  Then the real road to recovery begins.
</p>
<p>
Day 5: Discharge day!!!
</p>
<p>
Catheter removed last night.  Had to pee multiple times to make sure the bladder was emptied.  They did a sonogram scan after to check.  Yay!
</p>
<p>
Dr. Zhao arrived around 7 and removed the packing.  That was an interesting sensation.  Lol Dr. BBL arrived shortly after and looked over everything and said it looked amazing recovery wise.  Hope this trend continues. ðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
Kevin arrived, he&#39;s a sweetheart, and we went over all the parts of the vagina and canal along with all steps of the dilation process again.  Then dilation.  7 inches in depth!!! Ya girl is super stoked!  It was Blue dilator and this is the recommended size to start with.  If comfortable can go up to the green, but if not able to get the same depth then back down to blue.  Kevin&#39;s exact advice &#34; you can always gain width back, but you don&#39;t want to lose depth&#34;
</p>
<p>
Douched and went through that process with him as well.  Once a break happens I get to dilate again and then discharge! All this fun stuff multiple times a day for months to come.
</p>
<p>
10000% worth it all and love my new vagina.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions just message me, but that&#39;s it for this post.

I hope you have a great recovery! Did the surgery team or medical team in general have any shortcomings, or is there anything you were put off by? Just asking for other ladies considering them!

None at all so far.  Anything I&#39;ve needed they&#39;ve helped with.
</p>
<p>
I will simply say that the gas pain from the robotic assisted technique is brutal.  They tell you, and warn that it&#39;s bad.  I was not expecting the pain from it however.  Other than the gas pain that they will give meds for only help so much.  Hot packs and helping you roll side to side to help with the pain is super nice.  No other pain other than the gas though.  And they do keep you with a rotation of Tylenol, another pill, and oxycodone if needed.
</p>
<p>
Day 1 post op (today): they help with standing, very short walks, and to a chair to sit most of the day instead of laying down.
</p>
<p>
Starting tomorrow it&#39;s a lot more walking.

So glad you had a good experience. I just had a surgery using gas and it SUCKS. I thought I&#39;d managed to avoid it til the day after.

What was your hair removal regimen like? How long did it take before it was clear enough for surgery? Did you have any stragglers left?
</p>
<p>
ETA: what was your consultation like? Did you consult with any other surgeons?

Hair removal: I had 11 laser sessions when I started transitioning.  Then 7 electrolysis sessions.  I was able 90% clear.  She does do follicle scraping as well, but you have to have some clearance.
</p>
<p>
Consult was in October 2020.  I picked the date, but she had openings last year at first. Then put insurance changed and wish I had this at the end of last year now. Lol
</p>
<p>
I only had a 3 month wait for my consult.  Dr. BBL and Dr. Zhao are fantastic. All the prep classes going into this were super useful as well.
</p>
<p>
She was the only surgeon I consulted with.  I really wanted ppt, and I loved her aesthetics.

Thanks! Iâ€™m consulting with her and Dr. Avanessian later this year; Iâ€™m really looking forward to it! Iâ€™m glad youâ€™ve had such a great experience, and I wish you the best in recovery!

Haha, if you&#39;re on the 11th floor then probably.
</p>
<p>
Hope recovery is going well for you too and your gas pain wasn&#39;t as excruciating!!!
</p>
<p>
There is one other lady who I know of that had surgery on the 10th too.  So 3 of us now.

2 laps around the floor after breakfast.  Nice to be able to get up and walk.
<br>
Seriously though, avoid the vegiburger for any meal. ðŸ˜…
