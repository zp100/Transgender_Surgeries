I have an SRS consultation coming up with Christodoulos Kaoutzanis. I haven’t been able to find any information on reddit or on the wiki about this surgeon, he was just recommended to my by my endocrinologist (also at UC health) and I have a few acquaintance who have hair SRS there or at Denver health.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone here had SRS with this surgeon or anyone with UC health?

It looks like he&#39;s a new surgeon UCHealth-Anschutz. I didn&#39;t know they were doing vaginoplasties now (I had my orchi there.) I haven&#39;t heard of him. I had GRS at Denver Health with Dr. Hyer and she did an absolutely wonderful job.

If you don’t mind me asking, how was getting an initial consult with Dr. Heyer? Is there a long wait after just calling up her office? I intend to do multiple consults before 2021.

I spoke at one of the pre-surgical info sessions last year and did a Q&amp;A with patients still on the waitlist. The program director told me her waitlist was approaching three years now. You won&#39;t get a consult too far in advance with Denver Health, so you&#39;d have to get on the list and wait quite a while before anything happens, unfortunately.

My partner and I just had a consultation today with Dr. Kaoutzanis meant for Orchiectomy, but turned into a consult for GRS which we didn&#39;t know he performed. He and his assistant, Dr. Ty Higuchi, both came into the room and talked to us. As a first impression we were both impressed by their level of care and patience; we really felt like they cared and took their time to fully answer all of our questions, and to make sure that we were making the right decisions for ourselves, which was really nice.
</p>
<p>
Their procedure is, from what I understand, a hybrid approach between PI and PPT called the Davydov procedure. Dr. Higuchi uses robotics to do the interior, while Dr. Kaoutzanis works on the exterior at the same time. We did ask for pictures but they couldn&#39;t produce photos of a &#34;finished&#34; result, as they&#39;ve only begun doing this procedure since the start of this year. What they did show us was one picture immediately after surgery (which in comparison to other post-op photos I&#39;ve seen, looked pretty damn clean, but also nothing you wouldn&#39;t expect) and one picture taken 3 weeks after surgery, which was really inconclusive. As far as depth goes, they mentioned their recent surgeries were able to insert a full orange dilator. I&#39;m not sure what brand though, if there&#39;s even a choice?
</p>
<p>
They mentioned that they trained at NYU to perform this procedure, but I failed to ask if they worked with or under Bluebond-Langner specifically. OP, would you be able to ask if they did when you go in? I think that might cement him as our choice. We weren&#39;t even considering having our surgeries done here in Denver but we&#39;re heavily considering it now!
</p>
<p>
Lmk if yall have any other Q&#39;s and I can try to answer to the best of my ability.

At the moment they said virtually none, just covid restrictions and such as long as you have all your laser/electrolysis done. The area they specified was approx. a one inch circle surrounding the base of the shaft including the grundle.

I was also referred to him by my primary at UC Health for FTM top surgery but they said they could MAYBE show photos in a consult ($95 copay for me) and i can’t find any patient reviews or testimonials online.
</p>
<p>
it would be super convenient for my insurance and location but i can’t see working with someone for such a lifelong commitment who can’t provide this kind of thing :(
</p>
<p>
there are already enough reasons to feel scared abt the process and i feel like they should be doing everything possible to ease fears around it.
