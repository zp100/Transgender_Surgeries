<h1>
Introduction
</h1>
<p>
I had SRS with Dr. Bank at the Suporn Clinic in February 2024 and I feel like I need to speak up about my experience with the clinic, their practices and share some information which I wish I had known before having surgery with them.
</p>
<h1>
The Good
</h1>
<p>
The clinic&#39;s services while you are in Thailand are excellent. They pick you up from the airport on arrival, drive you to and from the clinic and hospital for all appointments, send a nurse to check on you in your room every day until you leave and will also drive you back to the airport when you leave. This is an amazing service and I have nothing but good things to say about this aspect.
</p>
<h1>
The Bad
</h1>
<p>
<strong>
Rushing and withholding information
</strong>
</p>
<p>
From the moment you arrive, there is a feeling of being on a production line. You are ferried between appointments which you are rushed in and out of, one patient after another. Before the surgery, you spend less than 10 minutes with Dr. Bank. He rushes you through an extremely graphic Powerpoint, asks if you have any questions and that is the first and last time you will see him until you are on the operating table. I asked him several questions such as how likely complications were and he said that all of them are unlikely and that most patients experience zero complications. That is absolutely not true. As I will discuss later, virtually all patients (myself included) experienced complications ranging from cosmetic issues to wound separation to serious bleeding.
</p>
<p>
Between one and two weeks after surgery, you are taken to the clinic for a &#39;post-op care class,&#39; and it is only at this point that they reveal the information they withheld previously, including that they actually expect every patient to experience complications. Among this information is the full scale of the dilation schedule, which will dominate your life for 3-6 months after surgery. At this point the clinic also mentions granulation, which they state is an expected issue for all patients and may take up to a year to heal post-operatively. Having spoken to patients at varying stages of recovery, they all experienced some degree of granulation and for many, it did not resolve on its own and required medical treatment. At no point prior to the surgery was the word granulation even mentioned, I was aware that it existed because I had read accounts of other people having SRS but assumed it was a relatively rare issue, certainly not that it was virtually guaranteed or that it would last for so long.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Complications and gaslighting
</strong>
</p>
<p>
About two weeks after my surgery I was told that I had several complications, including separation of one labia, necrosis of the clitoris and necrosis of the &#39;Chonburi organs.&#39; I ended up losing part of one &#39;Chonburi organ,&#39; about half of my clitoris and the separation was unable to be properly fixed before I left. When I was upset about this, Dr. Bank was extremely dismissive, telling me it would be fixed in a year as part of my free revision, and acted as though not only was this normal, but that SRS with the Suporn Clinic is usually a two-stage procedure. This is not mentioned at any point prior to the surgery, the &#39;free revision&#39; is described by the clinic&#39;s website as part of a &#34;Warranty&#34; due to their confidence in their work; that should you not be completely satisfied, they will do any cosmetic improvements free of charge. The clinic&#39;s own post-op information booklet claims that only around 15% of patients return for their free revision. It is never described as a &#39;second stage,&#39; nor as a procedure that you should expect to need.
</p>
<p>
These complications have led to significant cosmetic issues for me which I have had for the now 11 months since my initial surgery. When I was unhappy about having to wait a year for a proper revision and hopefully a good cosmetic result, Dr. Bank told me that I knew this was a two-stage procedure and that this was usually the case. That is not true, and I consider it to be gaslighting.
</p>
<p>
Of the 11 other patients I have spoken to about their complications, 8 experienced separation requiring a revision, 5 experienced necrosis, and all experienced hypergranulation. All are planning to return for a revision. Quite different from Dr. Bank&#39;s pre-surgery assurances that complications are rare and that only 15% of patients come back for a revision.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Medical misinformation
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The clinic fails to distinguish between normal aspects of healing and actual complications, for example granulation vs hypergranulation. Granulation is a normal stage of wound healing, and as the clinic reminds you frequently, &#34;if granulation does not happen, the wound will not heal.&#34; This is different to hypergranulation, which is a complication and an example of abnormal wound healing that leads to significantly increased recovery times, frequent bleeding, and heavy discharge. The clinic uses &#39;granulation&#39; as a blanket term to also refer to hypergranulation, and dismisses any concerns about hypergranulation as only being granulation and therefore &#39;normal.&#39; It is not. Every patient at the clinic that I spoke to experienced hypergranulation (including me), and they are told that it is a normal part of wound healing. It is not. The only two explanations for this are that the clinic genuinely does not understand the difference between granulation and hypergranulation, which is deeply worrying, or they do, in which case they are deliberately deceiving their patients. I&#39;m not sure which is worse.
</p>
<p>
This is particularly problematic as the clinic forbids you from seeing a doctor to assess or treat any issues that may arise, threatening to void your &#39;warranty&#39; and cancel your free revision should you do so. The clinic insists that if you have any concerns, you should contact them instead, and only see a doctor in an absolute emergency.
</p>
<p>
The result of this is that patients are left to suffer from very treatable issues, such as hypergranulation, out of fear of losing their &#39;warranty.&#39; Due to this policy, I suffered from hypergranulation which caused daily bleeding and heavy discharge for over 9 months before finally breaking and seeing my family physician, who easily treated it. Had I followed the clinic&#39;s advice and not seen a doctor, I have no doubt I would still be dealing with that hypergranulation today.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the clinic states that genital hair removal is not necessary for their SRS technique. This is extremely misleading. While it is true that you will not have hair growth in the vaginal canal itself, it is possible (and not uncommon) to have hair growing inside the vulva, around the vaginal entrance. I experienced this, as did several of the women I met in Thailand, and I have not been able to find an electrolysis technician who is able to remove the hair due to how hard it is to access the follicles. As a result, I am stuck with this hair for the foreseeable future.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Email Support
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The clinic says that they provide email support to all patients and as I mentioned, that should you have any concerns or issues, to contact them instead of seeing a doctor. In reality, their email support service is virtually useless. They respond with canned template emails, often requesting information you already provided, or in such broken English that their responses are meaningless. As the clinic is obviously not able to do a physical checkup or inspection, they are left to guess about what might be causing issues. For example, I contacted them several times about bleeding I was having and each time received a completely different explanation for what was causing it.
</p>
<p>
Their emails always boil down to &#34;do not worry, do not see a doctor, keep dilating.&#34; From talking to multiple other patients, I know that their experiences have been similar and all have given up on contacting the clinic and instead now see local doctors to address concerns.
</p>
<p>
The unofficial Discord server for Suporn patients is a far better resource than the clinic itself, and I often found myself turning to the other patients there for support and advice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery and Isolation
</strong>
</p>
<p>
One aspect of SRS with the Suporn Clinic which I rarely see discussed is just how debilitating and isolating the recovery is. I was aware that recovery from the Suporn technique was harder than other SRS techniques, however I was unaware of just how difficult it is, nor did the clinic provide any information or warnings about the recovery process pre-operatively. After my surgery in February, it was not until late June, over four months later, that I was able to walk properly or sit on a chair comfortably. For almost six months I had chronic fatigue, and was unable to work or even go for short walks. Even now, almost a year later, I would not say that I am fully physically recovered.
</p>
<p>
The dilation regimen is also extremely time consuming, and will dominate your life for at least 3-6 months after the surgery. As the dilation &#39;timer&#39; does not start until you reach full depth, which took me almost 40 minutes, this means that a single dilation session often took me 90 minutes for the first 6 months. This is not uncommon, and many patients took even longer. For the first three months you are expected to dilate at least 3 times a day, meaning that I spent about 4.5 hours per day dilating. This is a miserable process, it is the first thing you do in the morning, and the last thing you do at night. It is painful, there is often bleeding, and it effectively prevents you from doing anything. I am aware of several patients who were unable to handle this regimen and ended up giving up on their dilation, losing their vaginal depth as a result, and at several points I was close to making a similar decision.
</p>
<p>
The combination of fatigue, pain, and dilation means that this time period is extremely isolating. It is very difficult to find the time (let alone the will) to go out or see friends, knowing that in a few hours you will need to be home and dilating again.
</p>
<p>
I regularly talk to half a dozen patients I met while in Thailand, and all have had extremely difficult recoveries.
</p>
<h1>
The Result
</h1>
<p>
I&#39;m not unhappy with my result, but I&#39;m also not particularly impressed. My depth is middle of the road for the Suporn Clinic at 6&#34;/15.2cm. The sensation is okay, and I am able to orgasm from clitoral stimulation despite losing half of it to necrosis. The appearance is the aspect I am least happy with, there is a lot of asymmetry and lumpiness that I would like to get fixed, but I am looking at alternate surgeons to the Suporn Clinic because I don&#39;t really feel comfortable with them any more based on my experience the first time around. Based on the results of other Suporn patients I have seen on the unofficial Suporn Clinic Discord, I would say that my aesthetic results are average for the Suporn Clinic.
</p>
<p>
I chose the Suporn Clinic over other surgeons because I had heard that they were the best in the world and that although their recovery is more difficult than other surgeons, it is worth it because their results are superior. In hindsight, reflecting on my result and my recovery, I no longer believe this to be the case. There are other surgeons who can create equally good results and use techniques which have far shorter recoveries.
</p>
<h1>
Conclusion
</h1>
<p>
I don&#39;t think the Suporn Clinic is a bad option for SRS, and I do not think Dr. Bank is a bad surgeon. But I do think that many of their practices are problematic, and much of what they do both before and after surgery seems to boil down to pacifying and reassuring their patients at all costs, even if that means lying to them or withholding information, for example about the frequency of complications and about the difficulty of the recovery.
</p>
<p>
I also think that the mythos around the Suporn Clinic creates an unrealistic expectation that all (or even most) patients will get an amazing result, in reality this is far from true. While the Suporn Clinic are good, having now seen many of their results on the unofficial discord, I would not say that most patients get a convincing or cis-passing result (at least from the initial surgery, the revisions usually look a lot better), and prospective patients should be aware of that.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, had I known the information in this post prior to surgery, I would have gone somewhere else.

We are trans, cis people do make money on us. We should always be careful of that, they are not doing that for goodness. A &#34;great surgeon&#34; for one/many may not be for you. No surgeries comes with 0% chances of complications. And from my only point of vue surgeons always tends to diminish possible complications.
<br>
What you said about this surgeons is probably true for most of the surgeons plus there are cultural differences/language barrier if you are going abroad.
</p>
<p>
I personally prefer knowing what&#39;s good and wrong from a surgeons/clinic before going there. The wrong is more difficult to find about and it is scary.

<p>
I think that basically summarizes it nicely yeah.
</p>
<p>
With this surgeon the wrong is easy to find on Discord. For every hundred or so patients there are one or two dissatisfied enough to continue posting there.
</p>
<p>
I agree the clinic doesn&#39;t really do a great job at informed consent. But via the discord I knew basically every detail of the experience before going under the knife. It was just kinda on me to be paying attention to the server and a lot of people simply don&#39;t do that.

So you raise a lot of good points. In general, I think
<em>
most
</em>
of what you said is reasonable, as a former patient of the clinic.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to go through all of it point by point to say where I think your concerns are valid, because it would be time consuming and boring for you as a reader.
</p>
<p>
I would highlight a few things that I think are great points though:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Communication with the clinic after leaving is awful
</li>
<li>
Thai culture is different when it comes to explaining the risks. This means the clinic consistently does not fully explain things because they do not want patients to worry. It&#39;s basically on you to know what the risks are... they are well documented among the patients.
</li>
<li>
Thai culture is also different about saving face. Dr. Bank gets along great with most patients. However, if you confront him or the staff in a way that might be typical for an American they will get offended.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, I do think you&#39;re off base in some areas. And I would like to push back on a few things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Unfortunately the state of informed consent and follow up care is just as bad if not worse across most of America and the EU when it comes to SRS. This is especially true if you factor in the patient network on Discord (which you absolutely should be reading in order to be properly informed).
</li>
<li>
Forget about revisions for wound dishiscence—in most places the surgeon won&#39;t even look at it let alone do weekly revisions. &#34;Requiring revision&#34; is therefore misleading... it requires revision because his standards are much much higher than most. Yes almost every patient &#34;requires a revision&#34; which is usually just some stitches or outpatient procedures during weekly checkups you get for free for two months if you want them... name one other surgeon doing that sort of cadence for follow up and revisions with their patients?
</li>
<li>
I&#39;m sorry but the Discord results are NOT representative of the average patient. The vast majority of us who are happy with our results log off. You can see that just by the numbers. What you see on the discord is generally what people are unhappy with or else it&#39;s very early recovery
</li>
<li>
The average recovery is not in my opinion quite as difficult as you make it out to be. Mine was not. I know several whose were not. We tend to keep quiet because obviously the difficult cases need the support more than us and frankly a lot of us feel kinda sheepish about it. Announcing that you had no problems in front of someone who was botched comes off as poor taste in a space like Discord where people go for support.
</li>
<li>
In general I think your post lacks much of a reference point with other surgeons. Like ok these are fair complaints but... compared to what alternative? For example, I do have to wonder if you&#39;re thinking the surgery with other surgeons is a walk in the park? It&#39;s not.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To be frank with you, you raise a lot of good points in that I can see the kernel of truth in most of what you&#39;ve said. The communication with the clinic is especially a challenge both in terms of wording and culture as well as the email staff once you return home.
</p>
<p>
However this reads to me like the complaints of someone who has been spending a lot of time on the Discord reading the words of those who are actively complaining and has perhaps lost touch with the average patients perspective.

I was typing most of what you said out here, i second this, my result is brilliant, my recovery was smooth, my dilation was more than ok, i do have a small separation wound but tbh i feel it was my own lack of care that caused it, that being said when i spoke to Dr Bank, he already offered to fix it for me during revision ofc, i am heading back to thailand soon for a holiday and asked if i could nip to the clinic and have him take another look/have a check up 6 months post op, they have booked me in for this no issues.
</p>
<p>
Not to take away from OP’s post either i understand people have different experiences ofc, i am sorry your experience wasn’t as good as you hoped but the suporn clinic for me and many others was amazing.

After reading up on their method, I read that Dr. Banks makes additional incisions and uses a graph method that incurs a more difficult recovery. This method seems to occasionally create areas of raised scar tissue that some people reported replicate the feeling of rugae in the upper portion of the neovaginal canal. This method, contrasted with using the whole tissue flap with less incisions in a combined method for the canal, is one reason the necrosis rate for different areas of the external vagina being so high for them (exact numbers in the comment below) but also probably why the scar tissue doesn&#39;t form in those methods, possibly constricting the healing tissues blood supply.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for writing your experience down for us as it sheds light on what I had a hunch was going on. The practice seems to be really downplaying bad experiences to entice others to go there, unfortunately.

Where did you read this... ? Both the 15% number and the ruggae claim.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never heard that before about him attempting to recreate ruggae. I don&#39;t think I have ruggae but I wouldn&#39;t know what they feel like in natal vaginas to compare with.
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting for any readers that clit necrosis is a
<em>
broad
</em>
term that is usually less scary than it sounds. Most clit necrosis is a sloughing off of the most superficial skin and doesn&#39;t lead to loss of sensation or aesthetic issues.
</p>
<p>
He leaves the clit large so it&#39;s kinda a bit preferable aesthetically to have a bit of necrosis. Speaking as someone who had no necrosis and is considering a reduction in revision.

So those claims came from other people who I talked to who had surgery with him or found posts referring to their experience. I did a lot of digging and wanted to find out where they got the information from. I&#39;ll adjust my comment above to clarify what I found and correct any issues with accuracy.
</p>
<p>
First, the necrosis claim is higher percentage for the outer labia majora and lower for the inner labia majora as reported by the Suporn Clinics own website and published paper on their results. They do not specify clitoral necrosis numbers and probably report it in with inner labia majora necrosis. I&#39;ll adjust my comment to reflect this. Please check the results section for those exact numbers.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://supornclinic.com/paper/">Suporn Clinic Study Results</a>
</p>
<p>
Second, as for the claim of rugae reported by other girls who got the procedure done by him I found out what they are referring to. So Dr. Banks uses a graph instead of a flap which creates a small ring of scar tissue around the inner entrance of the vagina and that ring contracts a bit while healing. If you have that scar tissue heal up a certain way it feels like rugae (fold(s) or wrinkle in a mucous membrane) in the upper vaginal canal. I believe that&#39;s what the one woman told me in regards to additional incisions made that form rugae when healed.
</p>
<p>
According to another woman that I can still link to as their comments and accounts were not deleted, the pseudo rugae feel quite nice during PIV for the partner. If you don&#39;t have it at all there it simply means that you healed up with little scar tissue. That would be my best clarification of that misunderstanding. So it seems he sometimes creates it as not all surgeons do a graph rather than a flap for the canal and it&#39;s more of an occasional by product rather than an intended feature.

Thanks for the info I appreciate the work it took to dig it up!
</p>
<p>
That paper is from 2002 with a different surgeon. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good source of the current rate of necrosis in 2025 with Dr. Bank.
</p>
<p>
For context as someone who has been through Chon:
</p>
<p>
Necrosis as it&#39;s used in the clinic is a very broad term. Often it is so minor as to be a non-issue aesthetically or functionally. In my experience for example Dr. Bank told me I had &#34;necrosis&#34; because on my first visit I had about a 1 cm by 1mm grey line on either of my labia minora on my first checkup. By week two it had sloughed off and there was no sign of it. Now I wouldn&#39;t be able to find where it was even if I had a magnifying glass and hours to go poking around.
</p>
<p>
Even clitoral necrosis is usually not actually an issue. It&#39;s only when it&#39;s full clitoral necrosis or close to it that it becomes an issue. Even then many patients are still able to O, apparently.
</p>
<p>
As for the Ruggae: that explanation tracks with what I have. I can feel where the canal was attached in one or two places. It never occurred to me that Ruggae would feel like that though and it does not go on for more than an inch or so in depth. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the intent of the surgeon so much as a byproduct of the method itself.

Went to Chett, who uses a similar technique, and also have rugae. Past sex partners have commented on how cis-like it feels inside.

what?!? necrosis is not preferable. that is sensitive tissue, you are losing sensation.

Reading through your edits.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This method, contrasted with using the whole tissue flap with less incisions in a combined method for the canal, is one reason the necrosis rate for different areas of the external vagina being so high for them
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m sorryyyy but that&#39;s not how it works. The incisions you&#39;re talking about should not affect the blood supply of exterior structures.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
(exact numbers in the comment below)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I just want to re-state I think these &#34;exact numbers&#34; you cited are out of date and presented without sufficient context to be interpreted properly. They are from 2002 with a different surgeon &amp; using a very broad definition of necrosis (most necrosis is minor enough that it has no aesthetic or functional consequence).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
but also probably why the scar tissue doesn&#39;t form in those methods, possibly constricting the healing tissues blood supply.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Scar contraction definitely does occur with other methods. And there&#39;s no evidence as far as I can tell that this extra bit of issue has an impact on the blood supply of unrelated structures.
</p>
<p>
To be clear: the
<em>
exterior
</em>
structures are
<em>
not
</em>
detached from their blood supply. They are moved in a flap operation that retains the existing blood supply. It is
<em>
just
</em>
the canal that is fully grafted, and I think perhaps a bit of the interior labia minora which uses urethral tissue to make it pink.
</p>
<p>
The scar you are discussing is the attachment site between the flap and graft. It&#39;s not close to the clit or labia tissues nor is it close to where those tissues draw blood supply from (unless they draw blood from literally where the canal goes in which case every surgeon has this problem).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not saying a full canal graft isn&#39;t more challenging. I do think it leads to harder dilations on average for the first year. But it&#39;s not got anything to do with necrosis as far as I can tell.

I looked the word up to find out what you mean. I think the jejunum shares similar but not the same rugae you speak of but canals made of skin have none.

Thank you for writting this. We so seldom hear from people who are not happy with the Suporn experience!
</p>
<p>
My date is later this year, so all of this has me very concerned, of course I have spoken with other patients, and have heard all kinds of tales, but after doing years of research I still feel like it&#39;s the right choice for me.
</p>
<p>
I would only wish not to be required to go back for revision, but from what you all say, it almost seems inevitable, sigh.

Revision isn&#39;t inevitable. What OP is referring to as revisions are mostly the ones everyone gets during weekly checkups.
</p>
<p>
For myself I genuinely do not need a revision. I&#39;m going back for one because I want some things tweaked but it&#39;s just icing on the cake and very subjective preference stuff nothing to do with passability or obvious flaws.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the discord tends to have a bias toward negative experiences, reddit tends to have a bias toward positive ones. It&#39;s worth reading the discord but also taking it with a grain of salt and remembering the only people active many months or years after their surgeries are usually the least happy not the average.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, good luck! It is a roll of the dice but personally I think the odds are good. I&#39;m very happy I went to Dr. Bank.

Thank you, you mean the discord that they give you access to? I paid the deposit got the date, but still need to pay in full when I get closer to the date of surgery, I imagine that is when they give you the access to it?

As a future patient (April this year) thanks for writing this out. This is not exceptionally worrying me because that was already things I read to expect (for any surgeon). However negative reviews are so rare for Bank that I was suspicious of some online groups to hide things under the carpet.

As someone who went to dr bank in September 2023 I am extremely happy with my result.
</p>
<p>
With that being said, there are very slight cosmetic improvements that I am going back for, the dilation is brutal as well as recovery which I really didn’t expect.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, the nurses were amazing, saw dr bank like twice a week I think following recovery for him to check, I get that it does feel a little rushed but they have so many people that I suppose it’s kinda how it is unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
It’s been a brutal recovery, but I’m glad I chose dr bank

i feel the same way, i had my surgery recently and i couldnt be happier with the result. i did feel them rushing things, but not in a way where i ever felt treated badly. during the pre-op meeting with dr. bank i was told that i might have asymmetry due to my surgical history, which was super scary, so i requested another meeting with him before the surgery where he calmed me down and assured me he would do everything he could to make it look as natural as possible.
</p>
<p>
in the end it turned out very well and with no asymmetry at all. all this to say that i dont feel at all like they are trying to hide anything. they are open about both the risks and  the complications (which you can read about on their website)

Im sorry to hear this happened to you. It’s extremely frustrating that surgeons around the world have cashed in on our community’s dysphoria and urgency to treat us like cattle. This seems to be specially true in Thailand where the “come back so I can take a look” narrative is recurring like we all just can afford flying back and forth for a gyno appointment.  I’ve had my GRS with Chett and he completely botched me and I had a life saving revision with Theerapong but the bottom line is that they both rushed me and they both treated me similarly to what you experienced.  Hugs. I hope you can get a good revision

The clinic insists that if you have any concerns, you should contact them instead, and only see a doctor in an absolute emergency.

<p>
I forget where I first read this this as it goes back way before Dr  Bank, but I believe it’s because there were local doctors who were screwing up and making things worse.
</p>
<p>
Their technique is different to practiced elsewhere and I’d been very cautious about seeing a different surgeon for revision. They also have a lot of experience with it.

It’s also quite difficult choosing a surgeon for revision as there’s not nearly so many reviews. Having said that, Dr Therrapong seems quite popular these days.

I think it&#39;s very unethical to tell patients not to see a local doctor unless it&#39;s an emergency and to threaten to void their surgical warranty if they do.

To be clear: they
<em>
do not
</em>
say to not see a local doctor.
</p>
<p>
They say to not allow a local doctor to do a speculum exam during the first year. This is because they are concerned it will damage the canal.
</p>
<p>
They say not to allow a local doctor to burn off hypergranulation. This is because the clinic uses electrocautery
<em>
which is a superior method for removing hypergranulation
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
Most doctors cannot afford that so will just go in with silver nitrate. While this is fine for the outside structures usually it&#39;s easy to mess up or imprecisely apply it if the tissue is deep in the canal.
</p>
<p>
Granted, I think it&#39;s often a good idea to just go fix the granulation tissue at a local doctor. But there are at least reasons for their logic you maybe either missed or aren&#39;t acknowledging.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, they also say you should ask them first. Many times they will tell you to go to a local doctor once you email. Like for example if you are experiencing symptoms of BV they will tell you to get it treated locally. And anyway, they don&#39;t say you shouldn&#39;t go to your doctor for something like that to begin with.

The clinic has also had issues with local doctors being liberal with silver nitrate and causing damage to the canal.

Just to be clear, they do actually say not to see your own doctor. Quoting from their post-operative care book:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Please do NOT be tempted to go to see your own doctor if you feel something is wrong – unless it is quite obvious your problem needs urgent attention [...] Tell us first, and we will advise based on our very considerable experience. If we think it is necessary to see a doctor locally, we will tell you&#34;

I&#39;m sorry where is the issue here. If it&#39;s not urgent then it seems reasonable that they ask you to email them first.
</p>
<p>
There are so many times during my stay when nurses would say stuff like &#34;just get it from your local doctor when you are home&#34;. They do refer you to local doctors for stuff.
</p>
<p>
You and I both know that the post-op care book does not have the best English &amp; in order to understand what they are trying to communicate you need to be asking questions throughout your time in Chon especially at post op class.
</p>
<p>
To me, I interpreted that line as the clinic basically &#34;if you&#39;re not sure and it&#39;s not urgent please check with us first.&#34; And in post op class Aey explained more about why they say that (the speculum and granulation tissue issues).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If we think it is necessary to see a doctor locally, we will tell you
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Which they do in fact tell you to do.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry but a lot of your grievances here boil down to not understanding the culture or following the exact wording of what was said here with non-native speakers or there rather than the overall information they give you.
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;m not saying that isn&#39;t a fair grievance. It absolutely is. It sounds like you ran head first into finding out what saving face was and also struggled to overcome the language barrier. Which is not something most people like during a major surgery.
</p>
<p>
But it&#39;s not the same thing as the clinic forbidding you from ever going to a local doctor.

I did mine with T. Apparently from what I hear from the local girls, T was the preferred/top surgeon 10 years ago and he held that reverence for 10-15 years. And also it seems that many go to him after a screw up. T has a phase where he would do 10-15 patients a month for 2-3 months then he would rest for a while then repeat. He’s getting old. Seen him getting a tiny bit forgetful already. For my time with T when I was in Thailand, I had seen him at 3x before the actual surgery and 6x post surgery.

I’ll add your comment to the wiki.
</p>
<p>
Is he training anyone?
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to know how to interpret locals going to Thai surgeons as they are generally very poor and it’s not clear what choice they have.
</p>
<p>
The good thing is that he does have a lot of positive reviews from international patients with lots for revisions. There was a time not so long ago when he had very few.

the nurse that was my coordinator for my BA did her SRS with T. Her friends have told me back in 2010+ Theerapong was the preferred surgeon and they also did their SRS with him.
<br>
it&#39;s only T that insisted that i did my surgery in ICU due to my heart condition.
</p>
<p>
i had necrosis also.. but theerapong&#39;s team / interplast got me into hyperbaric chamber almost everyday after i got discharged from the ICU. and they arranged this for me at no extra cost. i did the O2 thingy
<a href="mailto:6x@30mins" rel="nofollow">6x@30mins</a>
. They even booked a nearest hotel next to the O2 chamber at their own expense so that i have the SHORTEST travelling time to and for. despite them already having arranged a condo for me to stay for the whole duration.

I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re American because of the fact you could have had other options (I apologize if I&#39;m wrong). But would your opinion still be the same if you were Canadian and our only option is GRS montreal?
</p>

Also do you think other facilities in Thailand are better?

Having known many people who&#39;ve gone through GRS Montreal and having gone through the Suporn Clinic myself... I personally think it&#39;s not really any contest. Suporn is better if you can afford it.
</p>
<p>
Whatever complaints OP has about Suporn aftercare, vagina factories, and informed consent... it&#39;s a joke compared to GRS Montreal. They do several surgeries per day (as opposed to 4 per week), send people home on planes after two weeks, and then the patients are basically in their own to recover even in cases of much much larger separation that Dr. Bank would have sewn up immediately.
</p>
<p>
That said, there is some truth to what they&#39;re saying. It&#39;s just a biased point of view they&#39;ve presented that isn&#39;t quite considering how bad the overall state of SRS actually is worldwide.

I don&#39;t know anything about GRS Montreal, I didn&#39;t consider or research them. As far as Thailand goes I think the Suporn Clinic is the best, at least as far as I&#39;m aware.

Unfortunately this is the “saving face” culture in Asia. Maybe the doctor knows he screwed up but pretended this is normal and “revision is normally required”. And when you post your experience online people will attack you saying their experiences are different and theirs are the normal ones. Asian culture is toxic and requires people to “read behind the lines” and it will be very bad in medical conditions. I feel so sad you have to went through this :(

Saving face is absolutely part of what is going on here. Especially the part where they say Dr. Bank was not being nice with them—it&#39;s almost certainly because OP wasn&#39;t fluent in that cultural norm.
</p>
<p>
However, it&#39;s just factually wrong that most of the stuff OP is describing is abnormal. The reason revision is &#34;normally required&#34; at the clinic is because the model of care is very different from other clinics.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry but like a little bit of labial detachment is not abnormal especially when attempting to create a posterior commissure. Most surgeons don&#39;t even attempt that because of the risk of detachment.
</p>
<p>
The suporn method is to instead make an attempt at perfection and do a bunch of minor revisions during the early weeks. The fact people get multiple small revisions as they heal is a feature and a perk not a bug.

Saving face is usually strictly meant for use for china chinese. The term “saving face” more often means taking physical offensive action rather than defensive action / passive reaction from embarrassment. Just saying…

Interesting, there&#39;s a lot of stuff they failed to explicitly tell you that (hair removal risk, revision requirement for good aesthetics) that I feel is seen as common knowledge around these spaces, disappointing you have to rely on that instead of communication from the clinic itself.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion I haven&#39;t seen any surgeon with equally good results to the top banks results, but I&#39;m definitely concerned about the recovery. Do you mind if I ask how old you are? I&#39;ve heard for suporn/banks in particular it gets much harder with age.

Revision is not &#34;required&#34; for good aesthetics—at least not for all patients. OP is using the word revision interchangeably for two different things.
</p>
<p>
There are the &#34;revisions&#34; everyone gets at weekly checkups for 1-2 months during primary.
</p>
<p>
Then there is the &#34;revision&#34; that anyone gets for free 1-2 years later if they book it in time. Contrary to what OP says, I don&#39;t think most people go back &amp; I do think a significant portion go for stuff most surgeons would never entertain.
</p>
<p>
In my case I&#39;m going back for some changes that nobody in their right mind would consider flaws. I just want a smaller urethra and a bit more defined of a clit hood now that swelling has gone down and it&#39;s safe to do so.

Sorry you have had an unpleasant experience.
<br>
This was a wonderful report you wrote.
<br>
People need to be aware of the bad with any places or surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m extremely happy with my results and luck that I didn&#39;t have any &#34;major&#34; complications.   I&#39;m currently going on 9th month post opp and everything &#34;works&#34; it took 220 days for it to come back to me but it&#39;s back and that&#39;s all that matters.
</p>
<p>
I was fully healed by my 6 month checkup, and I currently only dilate every few days if that.  I do have sex but I don&#39;t have a steady partner, and it makes no difference if I dilate or not.  I consider myself very lucky.
</p>
<p>
About the hair growth,  it&#39;s not uncommon for cis women to have hair growth clear into their labia minora and stop.  I had what I consider excessive hair removal and don&#39;t grow as much hair where I&#39;d like it to now. I also have hair growth on my outer lips, but it&#39;s not thick and actually is kinda ticklish and eroctic feeling for me, and I&#39;m glad I have it.
</p>
<p>
I had mine done at the Cleveland clinic with Dr. Fascelli and could not be happier.
<br>
I live in Southern Missouri and had my family Dr of 12 years now in the loop with Dr. Fascelli from day 1 of my initial consultation.  They actually want there us to have a backup plan in case an emergency arises.  There was never any discussion about voiding any warranty, so to say. Lol
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I hope everything works out for you.

Thank you for sharing your experience. I&#39;m currently booked for bottom surgery with the suporn clinic, and the recent glut of dissatisfied patients has me wondering if it&#39;s such a good idea. I remember reading a post last year from a girl that got surgery there a few years back, and she ended up permanently disabled and in chronic pain... it&#39;s scary that it can go so so wrong :(

Ya idk girlie I understand your concerns and I have 0 firsthand experience with this clinic cuz I went to a spot in the US. But a lot (not all) of the stuff you’re talking about is stuff that you shoulda been researching and learning before the procedure. There is a massive burden of proof of the surgeon to educate clients don’t get me wrong. But also like, stuff like granulation, fatigue, dilation schedule, intensity of recovery, risk of wound separation and maybe needing a stage 2 is pretty common knowledge across the board with most every SRS surgeon. Being in this sub for like a few months myself before surgery taught me most of what you felt out of the loop on. I can’t imagine going into SRS totally blind like you did that maybe wasn’t a great idea! Stuff like the necrosis tho is super fucked up I agree tho. For reference I went to bluebond they also didn’t super educate you. There are a few info seshes and opportunities to talk to girls 1+ years out through the process but it’s optional. I only met Bluebond for like less than 5 minutes every time I saw her. Her team handled most of the recovery stuff which seems to be very common with SRS surgeons

&#34;necrosis&#34; = the top layer of skin sloughs off without any aesthetic or functional impairment, usually. It&#39;s normal to have a tiny amount and only really a problem if it&#39;s a lot
</p>
<p>
It can also mean a person&#39;s whole clit falls off. It&#39;s a very broad category. Usually it&#39;s the former rather than the latter

The more I read about the Suporn clinic, the worse it seems to get.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad to have gone to Lubos (germany) instead where my worst complication was a mild UTI.

Lubos has a similar complication profile to Dr. Bank as far as I know. Most of the complications OP describes as &#34;requiring revision&#34; are not worse than a UTI
</p>
<p>
They only get revisions because Dr. Bank gives them 1-2 months of weekly checkups &amp; has a setup in his clinic for doing simple outpatient procedures

From what I&#39;ve seen and read, I disagree.
</p>
<p>
Though to be fair, Lubos is intended as a 2-step process where you&#39;re 90-95% ready after the first step and the second step is cosmetical (and often the urethra opening is re-done because the swelling while it heals sometimes leads to a non perfect stream)
</p>
<p>
Lubos however typicly has you in the hospital for about 3 weeks and reccomends regular checkups in the weeks/months after release at your local doctor.
</p>
<p>
UTIs are diagnosed typicly even before symptoms manifest and treated with antibiotics, but these are common with all surgeons and a result of the catheter staying in for prolonged periods of time.

Ok, well it&#39;s not really a matter of opinion for you to disagree with. There are some facts involved that I do not think you have good knowledge of based on your comments.
</p>
<p>
You are describing a situation roughly equivalent to what Dr. Bank offers at the Suporn Clinic. This perhaps explains how Lubos has been getting results that are comparable quality to what Dr. Bank offers. Though I would add Dr. Bank will allow you to stay for up to two months.
</p>
<p>
Note that you are also describing a situation that the vast vast vast majority of western doctors do not do. It&#39;s clear he&#39;s drawn inspiration from the Thai method in how he constructs his vulvas and also has the capacity to offer a degree of follow up care most cannot or will not.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
OP refers to this as &#34;revisions&#34; and many of the minor things that are addressed during those appointments with Dr. Bank OP refers to as &#34;detachment&#34; and &#34;necrosis&#34; and &#34;complications requiring revision&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Which, while technically true, is mostly a language barrier thing. The Thai medical staff tend to say things a bit more bluntly. OP is continuing to use the words the staff uses but not understanding the semantics of how the clinic uses them is for more minor issues than most surgeons would
</p>
<p>
You, as an outsider who lacks the context and real life experience of communicating with the staff, are most likely reading these words and thinking to yourself &#34;wow Lubos never had those issues&#34; not realizing they simply are not referred to in that way
</p>
<p>
Again, the vast majority of complications OP describes are less severe than a UTI. Speaking as someone who has had both. The reason you &#34;disagree&#34; is because words like &#34;necrosis&#34; out of Dr. Banks mouth can mean anything from a small 1 mm wound that will heal itself and wouldn&#39;t have been noticed except by him to literally the whole clit being lost
</p>
<p>
The former is extremely common therefore &#34;everyone needs revisions for detachment and necrosis etc&#34; however that does not mean they are as bad as a UTI. These are by and large minor complications similar to a UTI or less than one

All the decent surgeons here in germany do that, to name a few examples aside from team Markowsky:
</p>
<p>
Schaff, Morath/Schöll, Taskov and Hess
</p>
<p>
The quality of all these is roughly the same, even though their techniques differ somewhat in certain details.
</p>
<p>
To me it would be a major red flag to get kicked out of the hospital after less than 2 weeks
</p>

These are not realy a common type of revision needed there, at least from what I have seen, they still happen, but are the exception.
</p>
<p>
They are still communicated with the patients where it does happen.
</p>
<p>
Though if anything happens, it is noticed and treated very quickly due to daily visits from the surgeons and very thourogh inspections as well as cleaning every other day from other staff.

<p>
You&#39;re not &#34;kicked out of the hospital after less than two weeks.&#34; You&#39;re moved into a hotel beside the hospital with 24/7 nursing.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s disingenuous.
</p>
<p>
Also I do have to say that bedrest carries its own health risk and personally I think it&#39;s bad practice to keep patients in the hospital for 3 weeks.
</p>
<p>
That must increase the risk of DVT as well as muscle wasting considerably not to mention the dulling aspect that must have on the social support aspect of recovery in those early weeks.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think that is medical best practice. I have never heard of a place keeping patients in the hospital that long in any country.
</p>
<p>
Most move to a transition ward like arrangement or sent home. The transition ward type arrangement is by far the best and that&#39;s what the clinic does.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well that&#39;s great. It&#39;s contrary to what I heard from other patients in Germany. But in any case IT&#39;S NOT like that in any other country that I have ever heard of.
</p>
<p>
So I do think you need to acknowledge here that even assuming everything you say is true you are speaking from a level of privilege literally nobody in the western world outside Germany has.
</p>
<p>
And even then I met patients who went to Thailand because they did not think the results in Germany were good enough
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sorry but that is either false or not a good thing. Dr. Bank puts in a stitch here or there for tiny details and structures most surgeons don&#39;t even attempt to create.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re not getting those &#34;revisions&#34; then your surgeon is not very good by comparison.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So first of all your surgeons don&#39;t even attempt to create the posterior commissure. So they give you a less cis passing result in exchange for skipping most of these &#34;revisions&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Like I&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s just a fact the reason you didn&#39;t need to get a couple mm of detachment fixed is because your surgeon skipped that structure entirely.
</p>
<p>
But second I think you&#39;re being willfully ignorant of what I have written. You don&#39;t seem to understand what I have said at all. What they consider a revision is not a revision in the way you are thinking of.
</p>
<p>
If you saw what they are doing at the clinic you would understand. They are checkups where Dr. Bank gives people individual treatment that sometimes involves a stitch or two under local anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
Whether you like the fact they&#39;re called revisions or not is not really relevant to the fact they give a particular result consistently in the end &amp; a stitch or two is not a big deal.
</p>
<p>
Lamenting over &#34;oh no they have lots of (((revisions)))&#34; is nothing more than a game of semantics on your part. It&#39;s not based in anything material.
</p>
<p>
Serious complications are rare at the clinic. When they do happen they are dealt with immediately.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
They are still communicated with the patients where it does happen.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
How often is it communicated with the patient followed by &#34;we&#39;ll wait and see if it heals itself&#34; because a lot of the time that&#39;s what Dr. Bank will call a &#34;complication&#34; or &#34;detachment&#34; or &#34;necrosis&#34;
</p>
<p>
I would be willing to be it&#39;s only communicated to the patient if the doctor is deciding to intervene. And I would be willing to bet that they intervene less frequently than Dr. Bank.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bank tends to err on the side of intervening on things other surgeons would not. And he creates structures your surgeons do not even attempt. Which is kinda the part you keep ignoring pointedly here.
</p>
<p>
Alright I&#39;m going to be real here. I&#39;m exhausted and I&#39;m not convinced you&#39;re here in good faith based on your replies so I won&#39;t be responding further. Have a nice day.

That&#39;s incredibly interesting, saddening, and insightful.
</p>
<p>
The first things my surgery team discussed with me were complication rates and provided a booklet with different complications and how to spot them.
</p>
<p>
The fact that the clinic wants to stop you from going to a doctor is a massive red flag that should really concern most folks. They don&#39;t see you often and yet don&#39;t want you to get medical help.
</p>
<p>
I feel the fact that the results we get here goes to show the creme of the crop as it were. Which seems to leave quite a bad bias that folks don&#39;t have complications with Suporn.

This is misinformation. The clinic does NOT say you cannot go see another doctor. Details here:

Just to be clear, they do actually say not to see your own doctor. Quoting from their post-operative care book:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Please do NOT be tempted to go to see your own doctor if you feel something is wrong – unless it is quite obvious your problem needs urgent attention [...] Tell us first, and we will advise based on our very considerable experience. If we think it is necessary to see a doctor locally, we will tell you&#34;

You omitted the key part of that quote that says that it&#39;s specifically talking about ways that a patient&#39;s own doctor or gynecologist might be unfamiliar with how to handle a recent vaginoplasty, particularly with the Suporn technique and not something like penile inversion. This is relevant because inserting a speculum for example at this stage could cause damage. I&#39;m not wanting to try to discount you or blindly defend anyone else, just thinking it&#39;s important to include the whole context on this point for people who don&#39;t have access to the postop book.

To be clear, this is NOT a fair representation of the clinics advice. I think it speaks to how much you struggled with the language and culture barrier more than anything.

I agree, especially about preventing patients from seeing a doctor, it wasn&#39;t something that was raised until after the surgery. I also agree about the results here being the upper end results, most of the ones on the patient discord are nowhere near as good.

Results on the Discord tend to be from a small percentage of dissatisfied users. For every one or two of those there&#39;s about 100 who log off or do not post much. Personally I think the Reddit results are maybe a bit better than average but not by that much. There are definitely some mid results here.

I’m sorry you had all this trouble and complications they dismissed.
</p>
<p>
I was originally booked to go to the Suporn clinic after so much research. Something was niggling in the back of my mind to keep researching even though I got my date. In the end I went with another surgeon and clinic because I knew I couldn’t do 3-4 times dilation  and even though I liked the aesthetics there was something about it I wasnt 100 percent on.
</p>
<p>
It’s awful that they kept dismissing your complications and saying do not go to a doctor or it will void your free revision.
