Recently someone I know came across his instagram and most of his posts there are very unprofessional, offensive, and downright creepy. I want people to be aware of his behavior if they&#39;re considering going to him for surgery. This

has a link to screenshots of his posts, in case the instagram is taken down.

I have one close friend and another acquaintance who went to Salgado and both were horror stories. I would avoid him at all cost.
</p>
<p>
One of the issues my close friend had was zero sensation and he formed a ring in the opening part of where the colon part began that made it painful for her to dilate. His response to her was not to worry about that as that is for the man&#39;s pleasure. That response and his attitude in general basically made her feel like he was ignoring her discomfort. He gave her a creepy feeling to where it seemed like it was more important for a man to feel good than for her to experience pleasure during sex.

Hard to believe someone would say that, but on the other hand he posted this
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This patient underwent a rhinoplasty, chin implant, depressor nasalis transection and a chin implant. It didn’t take her long to find a boyfriend after this.

That’s it. Kinda impressive how many ways he can be offensive in a handful of hashtags really. Homophobic toerag by the looks of it (rectum raiders). And ‘real dicks matter’? So much side eye for that one..

Did these people know he was posting their pictures on social media? You would think they had to consent to this. I don&#39;t think a general surgical consent includes posting images on a personal Instagram account. The fact that he had been posting the comments and hashtags for so long is worrisome. How did he get away with this until now?

Lol. There’s no way they knowingly consented to this. Best case scenario is he had something about intraop photos for educational use buried in his consent forms and figured he could argue his IG was for educational purposes.
