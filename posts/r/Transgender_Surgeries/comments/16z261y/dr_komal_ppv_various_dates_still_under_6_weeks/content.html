Are you being paid by Kamol? I notice your profile is very new and seems to mostly be to promote this one surgeon who has butchered a lot of women.

Im not sure at first i thought it was kind of butchered but my suporn results and this Kamol is similar.  Ive had doctors and a pelvic floor specialist who also specializes in transgender women tell me it looks fantastic.  I would say posting after surgery pics might not be best.  I didnt look at mine like that after surgery as i knew it would be a hot mess.

I wish.
</p>
<p>
No i just hate reddit and try to avoid it. I&#39;m posting *because* there isn&#39;t enough good kamol results online and i wanted to contribute as i know so many girls irl get good results from him (and the unfortunate few shout very loud and make conspiracy theories about him)
</p>
<p>
Think of it this way, I know more happy people who have had ppv with him than all the happy people on reddit who went to him, you&#39;ll also notice a lot of &#34;going to see komal in a month&#34; then their account disappears, it&#39;s cause they don&#39;t need that shit anymore and they go off reddit (like everyone should)

Reddit is an awful place full of horrible people

That&#39;s a pretty nasty thing to say to someone regardless of your beef with a surgeon. I&#39;m over two years post op and love my vagina just fine. Like fuck Kamol or whatever. He&#39;s just some guy. You don&#39;t need to be wishing some girls results turn out poorly because you&#39;ve got a problem with her surgeon. That&#39;s fucked up.

My friend did it in june and she is very happy. They were 28 girls in the dilatation level of the building . I met my friend in à lgbt group in Paris in Mid of june . I was interested because I have a lifting in December in Kamol hospital. I understand some people have very bad expérience but let prople talk about good experience too.

So it just makes it look like a little penis, or does it cause pain from straining against the skin?  If you&#39;re not comfortable answering, I understand.  I&#39;m just trying to learn what to watch out for

No personal experience, but from what I&#39;ve read elsewhere, unremoved erectile tissue becomes hard when you are aroused, which is definitely not natal-vagina behaviour, and almost certainly not what your partner is expecting. It does not become a mini-penis because there is no longer any penis-shaped thing to inflate. In the case of penile-inversion vaginoplasty, unremoved erectile tissue can cause the inside of the neovagina to become hard, making PIV sex unpleasant and difficult, or even impossible.

**Kamol**
</p>
<p>
if it doesn&#39;t end up looking nice, i&#39;m that bothered tbh. It&#39;s not why i chose this surgeon. Sensitivity, pain level and lubrication are great. I&#39;ve been quite physically active already in terms of running and motorcycling again. If i do too much i need to sit down but yeah.

(literally orgasmed one week post op by gently moving clit)
</p>
<p>
I have no doubt it&#39;ll look different in a month or two
</p>
<p>
I should have taken a pic of the inside because the detail is incredible imo.
</p>
<p>
I did not do hair removal which is my fault.
</p>
<p>
My bottom dysphoria was so fucking bad, i am relieved by getting rid of it.
</p>
<p>
Reddit is a horrible place and the amount of people who have attempted to instill anxiety in me
<strong>
after
</strong>
i had already had surgery is sociopathic.
</p>
<p>
any negativity about komal could just be due to the volume of patients, komal is just doing the aesthetic bit but still doing 2-5 people a day, or maybe i was lucky. who knows, i met many happy people who had
<strong>
come back
</strong>
for more work. Even if there are 30 unhappy people on Reddit that could be five busy days for him, and he&#39;s done this for years.
</p>
<p>
My bf is very large so i&#39;ll be reporting back later, but currently ahead two dilator sizes of where i should be :)

Kamol you mean?  6 weeks it’s still very early by the way. Give it at least 3-6 months to start seeing final results 💜

I don&#39;t get a commission, it doesn&#39;t affect me. I&#39;m very happy with everything and up to the second largest dilator size after six weeks, which really mattered to me because my bf is huge. Take care ❤️

Looks great. I see some surgeries, and they don&#39;t join together at the top above the clit, which always seems wrong to me. Yours looks more natural to me for sure 😁

I’m so sorry people are saying such horrible things about your body because they themselves have had bad experiences with Kamol. I think your results look fantastic and definitely one of the best I’ve seen done by him.
</p>
<p>
It’s not bad to show good results by surgeons that have botched others, that’s honestly how Kamol gets the good pictures that he uses to advertise. I am glad people are warning others about their experiences with Kamol, but please don’t attack someone else’s body. She’s not Kamol.

almost all surgeons require a revision after a year, a friend who went to suporn described it as traumatising as you put all of that stuff behind you. Supposedly with komal the swelling will continue to go down for a long time so the idea is no revision is required.
</p>
<p>
and as a sidenote, what a sad fucking existence you have. I&#39;m six weeks post op, you seriously think it will look like this for long?

It won’t.  Swelling happens in ALL major surgeries.  When I had my knee operated on it was the size of a basketball.  When I had some of my lower intestines removed it looked like I was pregnant for months.
</p>
<p>
Hang in there, the swelling will eventually go down &amp; it will improve aesthetics wise.
</p>
<p>
Don’t listen to people like this

it hasn&#39;t finished changing so i don&#39;t think anyone can say what does and doesn&#39;t need doing. It feels like it looked a lot different a week ago, but thanks?

i think the communication is terrible, aesthetics aren&#39;t his main priority but (looks pretty now)
</p>
<p>
i get wet
</p>
<p>
i can take a bit over 7 inches (want more, get colon)
</p>
<p>
i barely dilate (always have dilated very little)
</p>
<p>
it&#39;s a hard decision, i&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be happy with whoever you go to
