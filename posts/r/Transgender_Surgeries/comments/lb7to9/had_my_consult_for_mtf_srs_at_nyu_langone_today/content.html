So my appointment was this morning, I arrived in NYC on Sunday and they require COVID tests before all in person visits, so I got that done on Monday in prep for my appointment!
</p>
<p>
I arrived at NYU Langone at about 9 a.m. this morning (my appointment was at 9:30) and they were running a little bit behind this morning (I’m guessing because the whole city was basically shut down yesterday due to the snowstorm) so I didn’t get called back until about 10:15.
</p>
<p>
So I first met with a nurse who took my blood pressure and went over some basic info, medical history, etc. normal intake stuff. She left and after a few minutes, Dr. Shakir came in.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Shakir is a urologist who from what I gather works under Dr. Zhao. He came in and went over some more intake stuff, asked me about my current health, sexual function, and offered to answer any questions I had in order to insure that Dr. Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Zhao weren’t in there all day with me haha. Dr. Shakir was able to answer basically all of my questions, and he gave me a gown to change into for the physical examination, and excused himself.
</p>
<p>
Not too long after that, Dr. Bb-L and Dr. Zhao entered and spoke to me about everythinggggg surrounding surgery, looked at my surgery site, and said that I’m basically ready for surgery and to just continue with electrolysis for the smaller, light hairs (I sent all of my letters and forms through the MyChart and brought the ones I couldn’t fill out virtually to the appointment). So yay! They then showed me TONS of pictures (all of which where incredible, btw. It’s hard to find results sometimes that aren’t like 0-3 months post op, so it was nice to see so many different results in different stages of recovery) and we talked about aesthetics, and they said I would receive a call in the next week or two with a date for surgery!! They are booking out about a year, but with cancellations I may be able to get a closer date!
</p>
<p>
All in all, the consultation was VERY in depth, I had no questions after, and they made me feel so welcome and safe. I’m already thrilled with the care they’ve shown me, and I haven’t even had surgery yet.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has any questions, I would be more than happy to answer if I can! AMA!

This is really great to hear. Thanks for posting this. I have my consult with the same team in April. May I ask you about how many hours of electro it is for you? I haven&#39;t started yet.

So honestly, I did just a couple hours of electrolysis, and then I hated it so I decided to do laser first, and then clear out whatever laser couldn’t with electrolysis, and that’s honestly been really awesome. I know there’s some small risks of laser not being 100% ~permanent~ but honestly, I think that’s pretty rare cause I haven’t heard too much about that. But I suggest considering laser and THEN electrolysis bc omg electro hurts like no other, it’s foul

I scheduled in I think like may of 2020, and because of the pandemic, they had a lot of openings that shifted a lot of things forward, so I only had to wait like 9 months.

I believe they said about 10-15% of patients face some form of complication, almost all being minor and completely treatable, but I could be wrong on the number. It’s definitely not high though.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They currently use the PI hybrid with the peritoneal graft for the inner most half of the vagina
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Same as cis female average depth, about 5-6in.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I may be wrong but I’m pretty sure they’ve always done this technique, they began in 2017. Probably just perfecting it over the years.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They have done over 300 vaginoplasty surgeries, beginning in 2017. They said they do about 2-4 a week.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They showed me photos, and I’ve got to say they are consistently impressive. In the wiki here, there are some great results, but not a ton of pictures from patients. But she had hundreds, and they were all beautiful. She even showed me some of her revision work from patients who had surgery with a different provider and came to her for a revision, and they’re also really amazing. She’s an artist.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
So they recommend to get as much of the hair from the base of the penis, down to the anus removed as possible. However they do scrape the follicles just to get any stragglers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
You know I have to be honest and say that I’m not entirely sure, I’ve researched them and I know they are board certified and very qualified, but I don’t know exactly where they received their education and training.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I’m very lucky and privileged to have amazing insurance, and they are covering 100% of the surgery, travel, lodging, etc. so honestly I don’t know.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They are currently booking out into early 2022, but with cancellations, hopefully I can get a sooner date!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
So I gained a lot of weight during quarantine, and my BMI is about a 29, and they didn’t say that I had to lose any weight or anything, so if you’re at or below a BMI of 29, I’m sure you’ll be fine.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
So anatomically speaking, they rearrange the genitalia to be the same as a cis vagina. So everything is where it should be.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I personally do not have foreskin, but they use the penile skin for the vulva, so it will just give them more material to create the labia minora/majora, clitoral hood, etc. if you are uncircumcised.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The glans of the penis is reformed into this clitoris
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Penile skin. The clitoral hood is as well.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That depends on how much penile skin you have to work with. They do their best to make them go all the way down and meet at the bottom, I believe.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
So like cis vaginas, no two neovaginas are the same. Some patients have more open and defined labia minora, some have labia majora that cover everything, it really just depends on your body, the amount of tissue you have to begin with, and honestly there is a little bit of personal preference that factors in. But they were all very neat and tidy. Some were a bit flatter and some were more “puffy” and again that’s just how your vagina heals and how your body is. The clitoral hoods I saw were all nice. Honestly I’m not super well versed on how vaginas look, cis or trans, so they all just looked like different kinds of vaginas to me. All beautiful in their own way. I’d say go in with the expectation of a neat, symmetrical, tidy appearance, and you’ll be happy.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Personally, Dr. Bb-L’s aesthetics are my favorite of all SRS surgeons in the US. She’s also an absolute sweetheart, so so nice and chill. And Dr. Zhao is really kind and affirming, and I absolutely trust them. I’m excited to have surgery with them, and just based on responsiveness and hospitality, I’d highly recommend them so far.
