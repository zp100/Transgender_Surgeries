Oh my god, I&#39;m so sorry, that must be terrible. Has the surgeon agreed to revisions?

You got this done in BC? Iâ€™m so sorry they didnâ€™t satisfy you hopefully you find someone better out here. Probably more trustable surgeons in other parts of Canada tbh.

I might be wrong, but it sounds like Dr. Kamol in Bangkok did it. She might be saying that&#39;s who she&#39;s going to to fix it, but I don&#39;t think so.

I am so sorry this has happened to you, but thank you so much for sharing as it is a good warning to others about the risks and what can go wrong.
</p>
<p>
I had already pretty much decided that I&#39;m going to look for a surgeon in my own country (UK in my case), regardless of how much more expensive it is than going somewhere like Thailand where the prices look very attractive. Until something goes wrong...
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ve now totally made my mind up - I&#39;m staying local, and doing a LOT of research before I let anyone near my with a knife...
</p>
<p>
Stuff can still go wrong, but at least I&#39;ll just be able to get in my car and go banging on their door!

To be fair I think it beats being a long haul flight away from a surgeon if there&#39;s any problem..!

Personally I think you should find the best surgeon you can, no matter where they are. Reduce the chance of having problems as much as possible because if you have significant complications youâ€™ve got big problems. Lawyers are not going to help either.

I do agree with you - up to a point! (..and an upvote! ðŸ˜œ)
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;m confident that there are some very good surgeons here in the UK, and I just don&#39;t feel happy about having to go half way around the world for any necessary follow-ups...
</p>
<p>
I can be at a London clinic in 90 minutes, and for me that peace of mind is worth a lot. Most likely nothing would go wrong, I&#39;ll be a happy customer and it&#39;ll all just be much more convenient and easier than going abroad. My friends can visit and even drop me off and take me home.
</p>
<p>
Besides - I really hate flying long haul..!

In a lot of ways, SRS is like a crap shoot.  Even the best surgeons have occasional botches.  With so many practitioners entering the marketplace due to insurance coverage/less stigma, we really need to do a ton of research and vetting.

So sorry about this. Just to confirm, was it Dr. Kamol who did the first surgery or he is doing the revision?

These pictures are totally different from the ones you send to the hospital.
</li>
<li>
You demand we cut out your pelvis so we can move the entrance to your vagina which incidentally is in the right place and due to this it&#39;s difficult to talk to you.
</li>
<li>
You threaten me and the hospital in a weekly basis.
</li>
<li>
You tell me you are on the spectrum and are hard to communicate with and &#34;I am like a stick of dynamite with my body&#34; and are so abusive it&#39;s very hard to coordinate with you. Especially when you demand we cut into your pelvic bone.
</li>
<li>
These are nothing like the pictures you sent to us, posted last time when everyone said it looked good.
</li>
<li>
I understand you are angry but we can&#39;t communicate to discuss, you put misleading / fake pictures online, you threaten me and the hospital, you want us to cut your pelvis etc etc. I mean these pics are blatantly photos hopped after you posted last time and everyone said it looked good.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you can please communicate nicely without the slander, deformation, threats and misinformation we would gladly help you. If surgery needs a revision we do it for free like we always have and always will.
