It‚Äôs been 9 days since surgery. Life is considerably better since getting the packing and the catheter removed. I‚Äôm still in a bit of discomfort but I‚Äôm starting to get real sleep at night. Dilation isn‚Äôt painful but more uncomfortable trying to stretch the skin. When I went in to learn how to dialate we could only get half the depth. The surgeon saw me and thinks the back of the canal is swollen shut and so right now I‚Äôm working to dilate to regain depth. I‚Äôve gained 1 dots length back in two days. It‚Äôs scary to think the depth could already be gone but it‚Äôs trending in the right direction. I think the surgical site looks horrendous but I can tell that the surgeon did a good job and it has the ingredients to heal and look nice.
</p>
<p>
What I‚Äôm having the hardest time with is the depression. I‚Äôm happy about the surgery, I‚Äôm pleased with the results. I don‚Äôt leave the house. I‚Äôm laying around all day. I can‚Äôt come up with distractions because I just feel sad having been so sedentary for so long now. The depression is hardest part so far. I deal with depression regularly and yes I do have a psychologist I talk to regularly. I don‚Äôt even know how to reach out to friends and say how sad I am. It‚Äôs a long journey and I don‚Äôt regret anything. This is a long and hard process.

I am glad your surgery went well, it is common to have post-surgery depression and its one thing I am worried about for my bottom surgery in 2 weeks.  I am brining a small device to play retro video games to help distract me from laying around. If you have people that can come visit you that will help. You got this and before you know it you will be doing much better. Good luck! ü§ó

Thanks. I‚Äôve lost the ability to think of things I want to do. I feel disconnected from my life. I don‚Äôt know even know what I would do if I wasn‚Äôt recovering. I feel lost while simultaneously happy it‚Äôs over. It‚Äôs weird. I‚Äôm glad your date is coming up. You can do this.

I feel you. Post op is a very difficult time.
</p>
<p>
I almost 4months and and I had to do the whole thing solo, even lied to the hospital that I had someone to pick me up just so they wouldn&#39;t cancel my surgery.
</p>
<p>
Dealt with a bit of wound dehiscence and a fourchette separation and a slow healing process onto of having lost my job while in recovery and watching the credit card debt pile up as I couldn&#39;t even pay rent and hey, got a court hearing coming up to look into that cause I couldn&#39;t replace the job fast enough...
</p>
<p>
But inspite all of that the healing has been getting better and I&#39;m starting as a youth mentor for an after school program once the year changes over so I am getting through ü•∞ it&#39;s just been a hell of a ride.
</p>
<p>
At 9 days it&#39;s OK if you aren&#39;t moving much, give your body time to do the Critial parts of the healing without over working it.
</p>
<p>
In a few weeks you can start to push things a bit, however if you get overzealous to soon that&#39;s where you can get things like dehiscence and difficult healing.
</p>
<p>
If you have help use it, but if you don&#39;t, it&#39;s OK you can still do this even if you have to be stronger than you should ü•≤ü§ó

Yeah it makes sense, the inactivity feels counter intuitive. With life we&#39;ve been taught that if we aren&#39;t constantly moving around doing stuff we are being lazy or worst and that we need to be constantly doing something meaningful to justify ourselves. But frankly the body doesn&#39;t care much for any of that and even as you lay around you&#39;re doing more for yourself than you&#39;d realize.
</p>
<p>
It takes a lot to heal from something so traumatic so its logically feel that way as your body is in itself in a depressed state just trying to recover.
</p>
<p>
Definitely acknowledge the feeling but know that you&#39;re doing great ü§ó

The depression absolutely sucks. I found it useful to have a plan, even if that plan was just.. dilate three times a day and eat a meal. It just helped me to look at that stuff as miniature milestones and as a progress tracker. I was still depressed though.

Kinda hard to say exactly. The first month was horrid. The second month was pretty bad. The third month was tough. Half way through month four and things are... they&#39;re okay
