He is such a great guy and very knowledgeable. Loved the way he described his technique and was open to any and all questions. The only thing that I was upset about is his surgery dates are already booked out two years. I felt like I was punched in the gut when he told me that. I just cried after the consultation because I want him to perform the surgery so bad but I don‚Äôt know if I can wait two more years. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Anybody know of ppt surgeons with a shorter wait time?

Make sure you‚Äôre on the waiting list. I got bumped up like 5 or 6 months because people cancel all the time. Dr Jun is worth it, but most good surgeons are booked out that far :/ it sucks.

If you have letters and have completed hair removal it is very very likely you will get a date significantly sooner than your ‚Äúofficial‚Äù date. So don‚Äôt be discouraged- get both of those things done asap and you should be in good shape. (I am in the same boat here- my official date is December 2023 üò≠üò≠)

I&#39;m in a similar situation - I&#39;m scheduled for a consult with Dr. Jun over a year away and a consultation with Dr. Bluebond-Langner almost 2 years away. I COMPLETELY resonate with the feeling you describe of being punched in the gut. IDK about you but I&#39;m already in my 30s, and now it seems like it&#39;s realistic to expect that I&#39;ll have to wait until my late 30s to have this done if I want it done with one of them.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve done quite a lot of research into PPT and to be honest, I haven&#39;t found any other surgeons who perform PPT and have anywhere near the consistency of aesthetic that Jun and BbL have. I&#39;ll repeat the most helpful advice I&#39;ve found on this subject; this is your vagina for the rest of your life. Get it done right. The reason Jun and BbL have such extremely long waitlists is that they really are that good.
</p>
<p>
But it&#39;s really, really shitty knowing how much longer I&#39;m going to be stuck with this damn thing.

What‚Äôs their error/complication rate? My main concern with working with them is that they‚Äôre on the coasts and I‚Äôm very much not. Follow up appointments would require flying and it‚Äôll be enough of a nightmare to pay for the surgery itself.

I don&#39;t know, every surgeon I&#39;ve consulted with to date has given that info during the consultation, not before. Anecdotally, they don&#39;t get mentioned for complications on this sub, for what that&#39;s worth. Jun is probably new enough to practicing (about one year) that real statistics for him don&#39;t really exist yet, BbL has been performing GCS for at least 5 years and reconstructive surgery for 10.

I wish I could have Min Jun to do my surgery, but since I don&#39;t live in the US I&#39;ll never be able to afford him sadly :/. Ask him to add you to a waiting list, there&#39;s always people cancelling so you may have your surgery sooner or at least you save a spot for Min Jun while you look for other surgeons
