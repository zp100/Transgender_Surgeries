I recently had a bilateral simple orchiectomy with Dr. Beck at Advocate and wanted to share my experience for people who might be considering an orchi or shopping for surgeons.
</p>
<p>
First I called her office for a consultation appointment, after hearing that she had operated on transgender patients before. It was fairly easy to set up, I just said my name, my primary care doctor, and I wanted a surgery consult. They scheduled one for about a month after I called.
</p>
<p>
At the consult: Provided a urine sample and my insurance information. Met with a nurse to check vitals etc, and then sat with Dr. Beck for about 15 minutes. She was very thorough in explaining the procedure and I did not feel rushed at all getting through the questions I had for her. My overall impression was that she was experienced with trans patients and kind. She noted here that she only performs “simple” orchiectomy, not inguinal, as simple is just as effective for our purposes and has a better recovery time.
</p>
<p>
After talking with Dr. Beck I scheduled a date for surgery about 3 months later, which felt like a perfect amount of time.
</p>
<p>
In between:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
required a pre-op appointment with my PCP no more than 30 days prior to the procedure.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
required two letters from “behavioral health specialists” stating that I was good to go for the surgery. (I got both of my letters from the Center on Halsted’s letter writing service, which was super easy to apply for and get in a timely manner)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I got a call confirming my insurance and an estimated bill from the hospital close to the date. (With insurance, it came out to $1,500 out of pocket to be paid via payment plan).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
bought recovery stuff: ice packs (frozen peas and ziplocks), maxi pads, tight shorts, comfort foods)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Day of surgery:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Arrived at Advocate about an hour and a half prior to the actual procedure for paperwork and prep and such
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Everyone was super super nice there, I had my actual name along with my deadname on my bracelet and wasn’t misgendered once throughout the entire day which made me feel more comfortable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
After being called up for prep I probably laid in the hospital bed for about a half hour as various nurses, anesthesiologists, and Dr. Beck came by to ask how I was doing, have me sign paperwork, and answer any questions. I brought a friend to help me up and she was allowed to come up with me for this part.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Once I had the IV and was all ready, they wheeled me into surgery, I remember the hallway leading up and not much else due to the anesthesia. Not a lot of pain waking up in recovery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Again, I can’t stress enough how kind and considerate the nurses were here, while I was in recovery. It felt like I was only in there for like 10 minutes, but clock wise I guess it was more like 45 minutes. When I was ready, they wheeled me back to a room to get dressed, and I left with my friend who was with me from the front doors.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Recovery:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I was prescribed Tramadol for pain, only received a small prescription for this (6 pills), which ended up working fine. Day 1 there was very little pain, and I took one of the Tramadol and Tylenol to sleep. Iced the surgery site throughout the day (important!). Diet as normal, they actually say to start with a lighter meal but I had McDonald’s on the way back because I was starving and a little goofy from the anesthesia still. Basically laid on the couch all day watching tv/ sleeping. Took my HRT as normal.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Day two was more painful than the first day, and I ended up taking two of the tramadol throughout the day in addition to the Tylenol. I also switched from the surgery gauze to maxi pads here, as they were more comfortable and there wasn’t much bleeding going on.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So my setup down there was maxi pad, tight underwear, bike shorts. W ice on and off every 20 minutes. This seemed to minimize the pain and swelling bc everything was stable and compressed.
</p>
<p>
Same deal, laid on the couch all day.
</p>
<p>
At this point, I was also having stomach cramps b/c I was constipated from the anesthesia/Tramadol. My friend ran out and grabbed an actual laxative from the store rather than the stool softener I was using before, and that took care of it. On that note, I would recommend having someone with you for at least the first 3 days if you can, mostly to make food/clean/run out if you need anything.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Day three was similarly painful to two, but I did switch to just Tylenol which explains it. I did get up and try to move around a bit this day bc I was getting restless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Day 4 I was pleasantly surprised that I wasn’t in as much pain, still mostly laying down but I walked around my apartment a bit and took a shower (which felt amazing). I’m on day 5 now and it’s even less painful.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Overall, very happy with my experience and impressed w Dr. Beck and her team. I tried to include as much as I could here, but would love to answer questions.

An add on here: the surgery ended up being $3,000 out of pocket, I have Anthem BCBS insurance. I called the hospital as soon as I went back to work, and they were very obliging with setting up a payment plan, it seemed like they would accept any number I put out for a monthly payment!
