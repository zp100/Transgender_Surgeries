Hello Ladies
</p>
<p>
I am trying to decide which UK surgeon to pick for bottom surgery in the hopefully, fingers crossed, not too distant future.
</p>
<p>
I am pretty sure that I would like to choose Tina Rashid, but I&#39;m only able to find a couple of pictures of her results.
</p>
<p>
I understand that many people may not want to as I understand it&#39;s such a personal thing, but I was wondering if there is anyone out there that has had surgery by her that would feel comfortable messaging me about their experience with her and even better, sharing a couple of pictures of their results.
</p>
<p>
Obviously this is a bit of a long shot of a request and I totally understand and respect the fact that most may not want to.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks
</p>
<p>
Abbie

I had mine with Tim Larner so canâ€™t comment much really about Tina Rashid.
</p>
<p>
I found Tim Larner to be brilliant, his results are brilliant. thereâ€™s hardly any scaring (but that comes down with what your like), his bedside manner is lovely and must inportently he puts people at ease and is upfront and honest to them. You can tell stright away that he loves the work he does.
</p>
<p>
Thereâ€™s a couple of groups on Facebook (the Nuffield bellas), they are full of info about the surgerions

My experience with him was brilliant, I was incredibly nervous about it all due to a bad experience in hospital after a serious car crash and having suffered a serious assult at work leaving me with a traumatic Brian injury. I explained this all and he helped put me at ease and explained everything that was going to happen and why and asked what they could do to make things easier. Certainly what above what was expected from him.
</p>
<p>
On the day of the surgery he come for a chat, explained everything and then went to get ready. I was in and out in around four hours, he even phoned my wife! He then saw me the following day and checked in even thro it was his day off, again he explained everything he did in surgery and was really pleased with his results.
</p>
<p>
I went for a vulvoplasty due to not being able to cope with the dilation. I had some swelling but was so holy with the outcome, it was tidy, looked good, and the satures were really well done.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m around four weeks post op now, have some sentions and had no issues, it looks as it should and looks brilliant.
</p>
<p>
Thereâ€™s a couple of posts in here showing photos of his work, thereâ€™s just not a lot out there.
</p>
<p>
Main points is, heâ€™s so polite and respectful, certainly takes proud in what he does and it looks good.

I think transphobic is maybe a bit strong.
</p>
<p>
Uncaring, lacking in compassion and empathy required to deal with patients post op, yes. Too busy to take his time and do tidy stitches to reduce the chance of scarring. Too busy to spent more than two minutes in my room ripping off the pressure dressing and leaving me feel abused and crying in agony.
</p>
<p>
He needs to realise that some of us suffer with extreme pain and trauma post op and need aggressive pain control not just ibuprofen and effin paracetamol. He has ruined the last 9 months of my life and maybe my mental health for the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
When questioned about my very poor scarring post op his reply was &#34;Well that&#39;s what you got&#34;.
