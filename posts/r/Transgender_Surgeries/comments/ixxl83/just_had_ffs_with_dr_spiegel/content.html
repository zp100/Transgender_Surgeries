It is way less painful than I excpected. Coronal incision and forehead are like a low grade headache. Trachea and mandibles are really uncomfortable but only hurt when swallowing

Pain isn’t bad but sleeping is difficult because hard to breathe with a blocked nose. Especially if you had lip lift too (hard to tell in photo) because lips will be numb and difficult to close. Use lots of chapstick and keep some water and chapstick near your bed. Expect to wake up with super dry mouth abs lips regularly. But at least it’s not that painful, just annoying.

Just a heads up. For some reason Dr. Spiegel is extremely anti q-tip cleaning, even if it’s done super gently and carefully. After a few days of not being able to breathe I said fuck it and just google/YouTubed other surgeons that showed how to do it. This video was what I used. Just be extremely careful and go slowly if you decide to do this.

Hey there fellow Bostonian! Hope you’re feeling ok and comfortable! I’m about to reach out to Spiegel and start moving forward with the paperwork. I had a consult with him in late February but put things in pause during lockdown.
</p>
<p>
Out of curiosity, why did you pick him over other surgeons?

He regularly had his students perform ffs on people and doesn&#39;t tell them. Spiegel is trash please google what I&#39;m saying and you will find lots of women who were botched by his students without their consent because he&#39;s a sociopath who views trans women as lab rats and guinea pigs

Hello fellow Bostonians. 👋 I had ffs with Dr. spiegel in June. I choose him because he has a mostly good reputation and was local. I didn’t want to travel to a far away land during Covid.

Good so far. Still swollen+numb at chin, nose, forehead, scalp.
</p>
<p>
My nostrils are slightly different sizes.
</p>
<p>
My forehead has a line going down the middle. This really bothers me a lot. Dr. Said 95% chance it goes away after healing but I doubt it.
</p>
<p>
Everything else is good. I’m 31 and my skin around my lower face looks slightly lose or something which kind of makes me look old sometimes. I do expect this will get better over time.

Congrats! I just had mine with him a few weeks ago. You might want to request anti nausea medicine from him at the follow up, the anesthesia made it impossible for me to keep anything down the first few days and I kept throwing up blood from the nose job. I had to specifically request it but it helped me finally eat and keep pain meds down. You will get through it though the worst will be over soon!

Ohh, I feel for you honey!  I had my FFS done by Dr. Spiegel in 2018 and it changed my life.  I am soooo grateful to him.  Hang in there and wait for at least five months for the initial swelling to go down and reveal your new facial features and really a year for it to totally go away.  But, you are on the journey now, so happy for you!

Thanks for all the love and support everyone. ❤
</p>
<p>
Day 2: overnight there was tons of swelling and I&#39;m very pumpkin-headed now.  More pain, but the meds are mostly keeping the edge off. Since I had mandible&amp;chin reshaping as well as cheek implants I was still getting some blood leaking in my mouth, but that slowed and petered out around 2 AM.
</p>
<p>
The hardest thing so far is not being able to sleep more than about 30-40 minutes at a go. My mouth gets so dry and there&#39;s still steady drainage from my nose, so I kept jerking awake coughing and need to be sipping water constantly.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m off to the office for a follow-up. I&#39;ll keep updating as time goes by
