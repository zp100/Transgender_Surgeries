I know Deschamps-Braly is highly regarded in this sub, but I had a pretty terrible consultation with him. I&#39;m mixed race, and the first thing he said to me was shockingly racist and asked if I happened to know some random person because our last names were from the same ethnicity...like what? Then he asked me if I knew someone who owned this hotel chain because we both have south asian heritage. Like it was so unprofessional and absolutely random and already set the tone that he was weird or only used to working with white people. Then he did his software imaging and made some revisions to my face and honestly I was shocked. He made me look way worse in the after photo. It was as though he&#39;s never worked with anyone brown or black or other than East Asian and I voiced my concern that I would look worse than anything. He got inordinately mad at that and said &#34;the best patients let me do what I think is best and don&#39;t try to micromanage the process.&#34; And then when I asked that my nose not be altered he kinda just mocked me and said why wouldn&#39;t I want it fixed or touched.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards with the cost consultation with his secretary she quoted me about $70,000 upfront and I basically said that the money wasn&#39;t an issue, and she seemed shocked that I was comfortable paying it out of pocket. Like, as though I shouldn&#39;t have that kind of money. It was just a bad experience in general.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m finding ffs frustrating because of a lot of providers&#39; incompetence when it comes to non white people. I have the money for it but it&#39;s hard finding anyone. I&#39;m thinking of going to Lee or Mardirossian instead. But Deschamps was rude, weird, and generally a bad experience overall. I know he definitely does some great work, but if you&#39;re not white, I wouldn&#39;t go to him

Yeah, I&#39;m dark skinned black and I have a feeling he leans towards a white, upper class demographic (the Kardashian types), so I&#39;m not sure about consulting with him. They seemed really nice on the phone but of course - I have a voice and name people stereotype as &#34;white&#34; so..
</p>
<p>
Mardirossian is incredible, never have I ever had a surgeon tell me without me even having to ask first &#34;we&#39;ll keep the features of your nose&#34; until Mardi. I&#39;m just peeved at how dirty they did me with scheduling a date (said they had openings in Sept, I said cool let me pay the deposit, and they refused to get back to me with an answer until dates moved back to mid 2025)
</p>
<p>
Also wow $70,000 up front wasn&#39;t an issue? Where do you work 😮

How recently was your consult and the date you received? Are you doing full FFS? I have a consult with him in September and looking to do just the top half and do only a &#34;half day&#34; of surgery in hopes of a quicker date. Are dates for full FFS backed out until mid 2025 already? That&#39;s when I was hoping to have it done so I can do it before the start of the school year next fall.

I booked my surgery towards the end of May and Dr. Mardirossian was booked up for the rest of 2024. I got the last slot in December, so while it’s not impossible that a cancellation could get you in earlier it’s pretty likely that you’re looking at early 2025 at best. The office told me after my first consultation (last September) that they’re usually booked out 6 months for surgery but they also said they’ve had more and more clients each year.

DB was my first choice, but I wound up having a consult with Dr. Mardirossian and I just really felt comfortable with him. My FFS is upcoming in December with him and I cancelled my consult with DB.

I have a consult with him in September. After 3+ years of looking at this sub he seems to be the best (imo) and his staff are absolutely great to talk to, I can&#39;t wait to meet him and talk to him in September, everyone speaks so highly of him not just as a surgeon but a person. Just looking for forehead contouring and a rhino so hopefully that doesn&#39;t break the bank with him.
</p>
<p>
I did talk to some of DB staff and didn&#39;t have a good vibe plus his results are not as good as Mardi or some others that are popular here. Plus I heard he is just astronomically expensive even for FFS in this day and age.

I’m white but I had a similar bad experience. DB is entitled and arrogant. He does good work but that isn’t enough when his office is so unpleasant to work with, too. I actively felt talked down to and embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
I ended up going with Tommy Liu for FFS (I’m recovering right now!) and I know he does some Asian-focused facial techniques. I’d check him out! Whoever you choose, you deserve someone who respects you and treats you like a human &lt;3

I&#39;d recommend Dr Liu too. He was my FFS surgeon and is fantastically pleasant.
</p>
<p>
Although I never talked about the racial/cultural aspects of FFS, I can confirm that the topic has been feature on his insta and was in a way that (at least to me) seemed very respectful.
</p>
<p>
p.s. congrats and hope your recovery is going well! &lt;3

I have a consultation with him in a couple weeks, I’ve heard almost nothing but good things about him before, and now to see this and all the complaints in the comments is quite disturbing.

Yeah, tbh I was very surprised last year when I consulted with him. I’d almost only heard good things. But a lot of negative experiences have started to come out in the past few months. Don’t let people who are reporting negatively on DB sway you too much. Go and figure out if you like him yourself. There’s no substitute for your own senses. :)

Yea iirc the initial consultation fee was like $500-1k? Then i got ghosted when I didn&#39;t respond I could pay right away for the consultation but soon. I remember when I called Jumaly and they wanted me to pay a certain amount PER MONTH to keep my (virutal)consultation date. Would&#39;ve been like $2k minimum. Mardi&#39;s was only a 300 one time payment for virtual. Joan was a joy to talk to from his team. Didn&#39;t ask about in person though.

just sharing my experiences as a desi girl who went to him
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
the arrogant behaviour doesn’t surprise me. the micro aggressions are wild, nothing like that happened to me, but that really sucks.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
i don’t necessarily agree with not recommending him for poc, bc he’s still probably one of the surgeons with the most experience with poc and has lots of detailed articles for different ethnicities on his site. but this is a case of “who’s gonna do it better?” bc most surgeons will do a cookie cutter white girl. I def appreciate the word of caution though, everyone should approach these surgeons with caution and that’s 100x true for woc
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
idk how to comment on my own surgery bc I still have dysphoria and brainworms and I kinda regret how my nose turned out. but everyone else unanimously says I turned out great and not whitewashed so 🤷🏽‍♀️

I don&#39;t know if he has the &#34;most&#34; experience with poc transfemmes. He showed me some of his work, and 95% of them were white. I feel like Lee at least has some experience with dark skinned asian people

It ranged from &#34;okay&#34; to pretty good. But honestly most of the patients who looked good just lost weight in the before and after photos. I also knew one white girl who went to him and honestly....she looked pretty mid/average. Like I&#39;m not trying to just &#34;pass&#34; I want to look good too lol

Dr Mardi will never push you into stuff you don&#39;t want and gallina wont imply you dont have the cash. Set up your consultation. Im so sorry that happened. Dr Mardi is very smart and speaks quite a few languages. He gets good results too.

I agree Mardi is tier 1.  I wondered a long time if I should’ve not went to him. I love his results and his noses. The only thing bothering me lately with him is that he doesn’t lower the hairline much but focuses on rounding it. I like how Lee shortened my forehead perfectly.

Right he focuses on rounding rather than lowering. I don’t like long foreheads 🤷‍♀️ Nonetheless I think he is the best in the world. I must be honest.

Dr Laura Garcia at Henry ford in Detroit is an expert in multi ethnic techniques. She presents on it all over the world.  She’s also phenomenal and did my surgery. If you’re in a general proximity I recommend her strongly.

I can&#39;t recommend Mardirossian like a lot of people on here. It was very important to me things looked natural and authentic when I went to him a few years ago.  He over resected my jaw angle leaving a concavity in the side of the face, left large bony steps with the genioplasty when I had expressed for him to be conservative and  liking the definition I had in my lower face. He has a very distinct style rhinoplasty that at times looks worked on in some patients.
</p>
<p>
He was very nice and said all the right things preoperatively to make me feel confident and like my identity would be respected, but that didn&#39;t line up with the end result. Look through his IG carefully as he almost never provides a full sense of the his outcomes (front, side profile, 3/4 view, hair back), and don&#39;t get caught up in the glammed up selfie photos he shares. He has a lot of great results, but you can also see a lot inconsistency and some overdone unnatural outcomes.

I went with him.  I would try to get multiple consults in the same time period.  So you can have comparisons.  I wouldn&#39;t let one thread decide for you.  It is good to have more information though.

They all charge a great amount TBH.  The good thing is him and others will put it towards your surgery fee if you choose them.  I meant with others within the same month if not week.  They all will be pushing dates at you and wanting deposits to hold.  FOMO can take over with how long the wait can be for surgery, and you end up taking the first surgeon because the others consults were months later.

This is good to know, thank you for reporting this, I’m sorry you went through that. I wanted to get a consult with DB but hearing this and some of the comments, especially given they need many months just for a consult, will write them off in my book.
</p>
<p>
I would caution against Lee, I also had a bad virtual consult with him too, he was pretty arrogant and just suggested I do everything (TS, Type III, cheek implants, brow lift, hairline advancement, rhinoplasty) without much in the way of any sort of personalised idea of what I’ll look like. I just went along with it (mostly bc I was pretty green and he was my first) but I wasn’t that enamoured by him.
</p>
<p>
I also had a consult with Mardirossian. Totally recommend. He’s awesome, super friendly and he has a quiet confidence that I really jibed with. He explains what he does and did a 3D CT scan of my skull. He thinks that I have a lot of bossing and he thinks I would really benefit from a full Type III as well so hearing it twice makes me think it may be what I need?
</p>
<p>
Toby Mayer also gave me good vibes. He does work with insurance which I am hoping will cover some of it, but the main thing is he seems to think I don’t need a Type III at all or cheek implants so he seemed much willing to personalise my FFS so he may be a good option for you too!

As someone who has found and spoken to some Of his patients who were happy, do you have references to these unhappy people? He’s one I’m considering next to facial team, and our conversations have been very thorough on procedure methods and match closely with what other surgeons like facialteam recommended me in consultation

IMO Mayer has one star patient who you can probably find with a little detective work on the trans timelines subreddit and quite a few others who don’t look that good. I got a weird vibe from his care team and I’m glad I didn’t go with Mayer.

I&#39;m really glad I went with DB. He&#39;s the most skilled FFS surgeon on the planet, and I found him to be an extremely kind person. The renders he provides are deliberately made to set expectations lower than what is likely to result, and he makes that as clear as he can during the consult.

You should look into Dr. Rahul Seth at Golden State Plastic Surgery, he doesn&#39;t have any trouble with ethnic faces (I don&#39;t know if this is to do with his being non-white himself or if it&#39;s just because he&#39;s good at what he does) and he was very polite, considerate, helpful and attentive when I saw him. He has opinions of course but he defers to the patient&#39;s wishes where applicable. Also you can look up examples of his work online.

I would NOT recommend deschamps and I am white. arrogant is putting things nicely. having surgery with him was the worst decision of my life. don’t get me started on how unprofessional his staff is! I cannot go into more detail as I do not want to get sued (yes he is like that) but I will close with do your research and buyer beware…

Do we have examples of this? The closest I know of was that Trans man having infected? Implants.  One or the other sued.

I&#39;ve seen good and bad results from DB. I wouldn&#39;t personally recommend him currently.
</p>
<p>
He moved up to 5 surgeries a week last year, and it&#39;s pretty clear he doesn&#39;t have enough time to really plan out the surgeries for his patients. He doesn&#39;t even do followups.
</p>
<p>
So yeah - he has the skill, but he doesn&#39;t really seem to give a shit anymore.

Yes he does a one year followup. In fact I just had mine.  Who told you otherwise?

Most surgeons do followups at 1 and 3 months to make sure things are healing alright, and to check how the patient is doing physically and mentally.
</p>
<p>
DB doesn&#39;t care or doesn&#39;t have the time.
</p>
<p>
I say this being a DB patient myself. At my 2 week followup he denied meeting with me because he &#34;had a phone call&#34;.

Follow ups at one and three months to say, &#34;you&#39;re swollen still&#34; doesn&#39;t make any cost effective sense for anyone.

I remember one time I asked somewhere about DB and ethnic faces. One of his white patients part of that group told me to look elsewhere because of his largely Caucasian clientele

Btw, thank you for sharing. I’m also south Asian and have been wondering about DB tbh. Has he shown you a gallery of patients post op? If so, what did you observe?

Seems like everyone is really singing the praises of Dr. Mardirossian here? First I have heard of them, where are they located?

An FTM committed suicide after getting surgery from him due to how he was treated by him and because he abandoned him when he had complications. He was also transphobic to him.

MASSIVE trigger warning. I was emotionally fucked up for a few days after having had read through everything.

He had posted documents and pictures on his facebook before he died (the link is in his posts). People treated him like total shit about it too. Really fucks me up whenever I look at his account.

Yeah, I&#39;m wondering this as well.  Like I remember one of their posts, and they were in a bad situation.  I don&#39;t remember seeing anything more though.

I had a consultation with Dr. mardirossian he wad going to fix my face from another surgeon that messed my face up and recommended other procedures that I needed but never had, after what I went through physically and mentally from the other surgeon that damaged my face I was nervous to talk to other surgeon&#39;s from the way I was treated and my horrible results, dr mardirossian treated me with dignity and was very respectful to me and he earned my trust. for my surgery, but after all of that with Dr mardirossian Galina would not even consider sending the information to my insurance company to get my FFS approved and I told her that they were going to approve my surgery and there going to get there money I even sent a letter from my insurance company and they my insurance also contactethe privd her saying that they would approve my FFS and pay them what they wanted but Galina still would not exept my insurance. I was devastated. so I am still living with my messed up face. but they were very nice but that was it. it is so sad that it is all about the money with most of the private FFS surgeon&#39;s.
