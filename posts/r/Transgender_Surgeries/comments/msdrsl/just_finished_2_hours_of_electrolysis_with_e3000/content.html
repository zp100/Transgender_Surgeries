Pictures are 30 minutes after, when I finished 30 minutes ago I was really swollen but she told me a lot of it was from the lidocaine injections.  Definitely some bruising but again from the injections.  For the most part the electrolysis was painless, just a few points where the lidocaine hadn‚Äôt got to.   The injections were of course painful, but done in batches and the pain was just a minute at a time for each location.
<br>
Over all I‚Äôm super pleased with this and booked another session in 7 weeks.    I have been having the electrolysis for a long time on and off, have done 2 previous sessions at 8 hours and was super swollen.  I‚Äôm happy with the swelling, just hope the bruising goes quickly.

Glad you had a good experience with them üëç would not recommend anyone get any work done for bottom surgery with them though, they were incredibly unprofessional and had people opening the door on me while I was butt ass naked. At one point they did the completely wrong area because they didn&#39;t look at the chart that I gave them and assumed what I needed done.

Sorry to hear. We can only comment on what happens to each of us individually.   Like every subject there are good and bad reports regardless

It&#39;s alright, what happened happened. They seem like they&#39;d be great facial electrolysis tbh, just trying to give a bit of a warning for bottom surgery electrolysis with them whenever I see their name pop up.

Got my first appt with them in early June.
</p>
<p>
Have had LHR, and about 50 hours of electrolysis, but I just can&#39;t handle the pain anymore, especially on my lip!
</p>
<p>
Looking forward to the results, not looking forward to the process

It‚Äôs a long process that‚Äôs for sure and the pain is really bad for me.  I often wonder why I continue, I have stopped for long periods but always come back to it.  I believe I‚Äôll finish this year though except for odd touch ups.

Nothing about this entire process is easy, sadly.

Disagree.  We are all different, I really struggle with an hour, if you add the lip then its even worse   Well worth it to me to get everything cleared out and will definitely do it again.
</p>
<p>
If you can tolerate more than an hour then that is great for you but we‚Äôre not all able to
</p>
<p>
I know the different types, done it in the UK, Europe and the states with multiple different technicians.   Sounds like you‚Äôre one of the lucky ones.

I‚Äôm still bruised from the work on Friday and it‚Äôs noticeable.  Although I only had 2 hours of work done I believe the injections were for the whole face.  We‚Äôre all different, I bruise easily and you might be fine.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck but definitely do the dental injections for lips and chin.  That way it‚Äôs easier and you won‚Äôt definitely won‚Äôt bruise in that area
