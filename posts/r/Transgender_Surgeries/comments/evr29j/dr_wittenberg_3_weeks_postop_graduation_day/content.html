Just a reminder: this is penile inversion, and I&#39;m 33 years old.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, everything is still going well. I still have swelling in my vaginal canal that makes the initial dilator insertion a bit annoying, but it&#39;s perfectly normal. Plus given enough lube and patience, I&#39;m able to reach full depth.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s some new-found sensitivity along some of the stitches, but this is apparently also perfectly normal.
</p>
<p>
Finally, she mentioned that the sutures holding the labia minora are designed to dissolve/absorb over 2-3 months. So that&#39;s something fun to look forward to come sex time.

My comfortable limit (because pressure builds up down there as I stand/walk) is about 3 to 4 blocks.
</p>
<p>
She did give me the green light to walk more...so long as it&#39;s within my comfort range (and not something intense like hiking).

How about driving? Ideally i cant exactly afford that full three weeks and I live 4 1/2 hours out of the city. Id rather come home after the second appt if possible and return for the third. Is this doable? Also id rather avoid being in San Fran during pride if possible (so crowded!). I would personally not like to rely on other people for transportation outside of my wife but she gets panic attacks on city freeways.
</p>
<p>
Also where did you end up staying?

I still struggle sitting. I&#39;m dreading the 2 hour flight home (and I&#39;ll be as slouched as possible). I can only imagine how much worse this would be having to sit upright enough to drive and doing so for 4.5 hours (twice).
</p>
<p>
I stayed in a hotel since my insurance reimburses $10k in travel and lodging.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re in California, I&#39;d suggest taking medical leave for the full 12 weeks allowed and applying for disability insurance. I can&#39;t imagine going back to work at this point. I&#39;m still just laying in bed most the day.

I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, you&#39;re gonna have such a pretty vagina once you&#39;re all healed. It already looks amazing. So jealous of you!

I&#39;d like to think so. My labia minora are kinda bouncy despite still being a bit swollen (which is fun and kinda sexy to watch).
</p>
<p>
Like I mentioned in my comment, the stitches seem a bit irritated lately, but that&#39;s probably about the worst of it.

Here is the wild thing, I&#39;m also a Wittenberg patient and I have the exact same asymmetry.  The right minora is straight out of a Georgia O&#39;Keefe painting and the left one is stick straight.  I wonder why that is.
