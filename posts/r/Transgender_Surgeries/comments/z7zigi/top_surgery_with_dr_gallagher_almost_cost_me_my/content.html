This was posted to the subreddit a few days ago as a link to a Tumblr post about a Twitter thread (
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/z0d2f3/avoid_this_doctor_please_stay_safe/content.html">link</a>
), but it&#39;s since been formatted as an article in its own right - available here:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Content warning: Graphic photographs and descriptions of severe, life-threatening surgical complications post-top surgery with Dr. Sidhbh Gallagher (Miami)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rylan545.medium.com/top-surgery-with-dr-gallagher-almost-cost-me-my-life-d68cda71c543">https://rylan545.medium.com/top-surgery-with-dr-gallagher-almost-cost-me-my-life-d68cda71c543</a>
</p>
<p>
I thought it would be reasonable to repost this with the full title and a link to the article version of the posts, given the potential instability of Twitter as a host.
</p>
<p>
Obviously no surgeon in the field will have a perfect record by the very nature of the job, but I hope this (it must be stressed, horrific) account will help some people to make an informed decision about their choice of surgeon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Edit
</strong>
:
<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gendersurgeon/video/7171462051485732138">Link to an apology video by the surgeon</a>
.

(Clarification: I’m not the person who wrote the article, since some people are assuming that!)

There is a trans woman&#39;s blog somewhere out there about a horrific botched bottom surgery by Dr. Gallagher.
</p>
<p>
I worked closely with Dr. Gallagher professionally back 2017-19 when she was in Indiana. I found her to be a poor communicator and difficult to work with. She seemed to have little care for the needs of her patients when there were issues that could be resolved by referring them to me, instead telling them that she couldnt work with them and leaving many patients without any treatment options as she was the only surgeon in Indiana at the time.
</p>
<p>
She trained under Harry Reid and Kathy Rumer, two of the most notoriously bad SRS surgeons.

I didn&#39;t know that. I noticed Gallager said Kathy Rumer does &#34;really beautiful work&#34;.

What a pedigree 😓 what a story😳 raises the hair on my back, as i had srs recently at an undocumented clinic in Barcelona, so it was quite a roll of the dice. O got lucky, but reading stories like this before surgery would&#39;ve been bad for my decision making... Or good

the biggest issue i have is the total lack of care toward her patient, she just brushed off everything as if its nothing, and if her patient listened to her, then OP would be dead (possibly)

Sad to hear about this. She has such a decent presence on Youtube, you&#39;d think things wouldn&#39;t go this bad.  Is she the doc that Jazz Jennings &#39;interned&#39; with, on her reality show?

IIRC, it was

at Mount Sinai as the primary surgeon with Bowers assisting/oserving the peritoneal pullthrough. Bowers was definitely involved from pre to post op, though

Definitely didn&#39;t deserve it but they:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
are over BMI restrictions and went to her specifically because she doesn&#39;t enforce them
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
has pre-existing medical problems
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
had a non-standard procedure
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
I don&#39;t understand how people are Surprise Pikachu when surgeons can&#39;t work miracles. If you have to go to a different plastic surgeon because others won&#39;t touch you, you should ask yourself why and if you can get within those restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Those restrictions aren&#39;t there to oppress or demean you, they exist to maximize safety and success.
</p>
<p>
And if you are going to go into surgery with a pre-existing medical condition like being overweight or having any pre-existing condition that may worsen recovery, don&#39;t get cutesy and try to get an experimental option unless it&#39;s  absolutely necessary to do so.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Gallagher is fucked up for not having these restrictions in place and playing fast and loose with patients by allowing experimental options to risky cases. From my perspective, it seems like it may be about the money vs having happy patients.

it is still ultimately up to the surgeon to say yes or no to the patient.
</p>
<p>
Maybe he insisted….that shouldn’t matter.  A caring and responsible surgeon would still say no.
</p>
<p>
I’m really not into even a little victim blaming here.  If the surgery shouldn’t have happened, it’s up to the surgeon to say no. Always. They’re the one with the education and experience.

Yes indeed, ofcourse I don&#39;t like it that it&#39;s going to take me a long time to get srs, but I wouldn&#39;t want it any other way, I want to stay alive and healthy and have an as good as possible result if I can help it, losing weight is necessary for that, so losing weight is what I have to do for it, although I must say BMI isn&#39;t exact and doesn&#39;t say everything, internal/external fat, musclemass, but that&#39;s just a little nitpick, for me there is no doubt I&#39;m too fat and I need to lose weight.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I think people get too sensitive and start to see everything as fat shaming or fat phobia, when especially in this case it definitely is not, I didn&#39;t get upset when my gender specialists each seperately told me I need to lose weight, as it&#39;s the truth, they&#39;re not saying it to be mean, it&#39;s just the facts that I am overweight because of fat and that this is besides not healthy in general a necessary contraindication for surgeries such as this.

I think a lot of people these days are very connected to their identity as a fat person the same way you would be connected to, say, your identity as a trans person, so when they see people saying that being overweight is unhealthy they take it as a personal attack against them. There is no moral alignment to body size, you’re not a bad person because you’re fat, but science has been pretty consistent with telling us that excess weight is bad for the body. People don’t want to hear it though, so we’re left with thousands of people who now have a growing distrust in doctors that are trying to help them. I used to be very overweight, and I can say from experience that slimming down has improved my quality of life in a lot of ways! It’s frustrating watching something like body weight get turned into a social issue people will cut you off for, when really its just a simple science issue.

I’ve seen two top surgeons and one wanted me to lose 20kg to get to a safer BMI and one isn’t fussed. I want to lose weight regardless to have a safer surgery, after this story tbh! I started at 108kg, now at 97kg but not sure if this weight is as bad for safety as the person in the story/OP? I have no idea their original weight!

She actually responded yesterday I think on tiktok apologising. I don’t think anyone will believe what she says though 🤷‍♀️ and I certainly wouldn’t accept the apology, it’s up to the individual.

Just saw the apology video and winced. That’s barely an apology at all - none of the direct concerns of the person who suffered these consequences are addressed at all.
</p>
<p>
It’s all “we’re sorry our procedures caused you to feel upset”, and no “we’re sorry you
<em>
literally almost died through my negligence
</em>
”. Standard celebrity doctor schtick.
</p>
<p>
I hope the poor guy got a proper response privately.

Yh and patient confidentiality is a bad excuse due to the fact now everyone knows. We don’t need to know anything about the patient. It was about her and her responses to the issue. (Or lack of)

This is terrible… That no weight cap would have been a red flag 🚩 for me and the no insurance would definitely be a red flag 🚩 for me… While I understand that gender confirming surgery is important, my quality of life before and after surgery is just as important… Word transitioning is work, there is no way around it…

While I feel terrible that you had to experience this, brah tha red flag was there… No bmi/weight cap is a huge red flag… Weight caps are there for a reason, to protect the patient… Anything could go wrong during surgery if your weight isn’t conducive to the procedure getting done…

Given that the complications in question started happening
<em>
four days
</em>
after the procedure, I expect the nicotine will have had exactly nothing to do with the outcome.
</p>
<p>
Doing it five weeks post-op won’t have affected things at all. There’s no need to victim blame like this.

I saw the original tiktok and was horrified, but I have to say her video response was exactly how she should have handled this, so props to her on that. Rumer probably would have just sued..
