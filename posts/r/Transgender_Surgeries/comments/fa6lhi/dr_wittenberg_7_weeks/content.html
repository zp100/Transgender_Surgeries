I&#39;m 33, and this is penile inversion.
</p>
<p>
Not a lot of visible changes over these past three weeks, but there is a bit to report still.
</p>
<p>
I have these transparent hooks pushing their way out along the external suture lines. They&#39;re more annoying than painful, so I&#39;m just putting up with them. I assume they will eventually push their way out like splinters.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had my first orgasms! I&#39;ve had this firm area &#34;behind&#34; my clit/clit hood, under my mons pubis. When I touch it, I can feel the sensation in my clit. I don&#39;t remember what lead me to try stimulating it for pleasure, but I&#39;m glad I did. I&#39;ve had about three orgasms this way, the first of which, I got so wet that I leaked through my undies and pants to soak the sheets.
</p>
<p>
Dilation has been a complete pain in the ass. Per Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s office, this is because the surrounding muscles are constricting down on the canal. It really sucks. It takes like 5 to 10 minutes just to get the damn thing in plus the actual dilation time.
</p>
<p>
Walking is much better. I&#39;m able to walk a mile (probably could do more but I get bored) at a time, and grocery trips (including the car ride) are no longer an issue. Sitting on hard, upright surfaces gets painful quite quickly though.

I really am impressed! The way DRs are so progressive. When I was younger I was curious to see what GRS had looked like. The progress is incredible. Iâ€™m pretty fascinated by surgery. The advancements just amaze me. I wouldnâ€™t be able to tell any different.

It&#39;s like magic! It think Staci had it right when they called Dr. Wittenberg a fairy godmother.
</p>
<p>
And thank you! I&#39;m actually starting to see that myself. Plus it still has another 6 weeks of healing before it&#39;s &#34;ready&#34;. (&#34;Ready&#34; being 80% healed and safe for penetration.)

Hi! Im seeing Dr Wittenberg this summer (and I still havenâ€™t decided on full or partial depth ðŸ˜£). I will have a solid six weeks off before I got back to work with the option of taking more if necessary (im a high school librarian so I would rather NOT miss the first day of school). How are things like energy levels, ability to drive, etc? For reference I am 35 and slightly out of shape.

I drove for about 20 minutes with my donut pillow at 5 weeks. It sucked pretty badly, but it wasn&#39;t impossible. I&#39;ve yet to try it since, but I&#39;ve been riding as a passenger (without my pillow) just fine lately. It might be time to give driving another shot, honestly.
</p>
<p>
Energy-wise, I&#39;m good while sitting. It&#39;s when I&#39;m up moving around for my walks or during shopping trips that I get exhausted. Fortunately I don&#39;t have to go back to work because if I did, I&#39;d be dreading it, even though I have a desk job.

From first contact to consolation to surgery how long was the wait?

I don&#39;t remember the first part, but it wasn&#39;t very long I don&#39;t think. Maybe a month to get the consultation? And I think that was largely my choice to get decent flight prices.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Dr. Wittenberg had a 7 month wait list. I ended up scheduling for 8 months out because of classes and the holidays.
</p>
<p>
So maybe 9 months from start to surgery?

Can I borrow that? Or, better yet, can I get my own?

It&#39;s incredible to see the difference looking back at your 1-2 week posts to now. I&#39;m at 2 weeks at the moment with Dr. Wittenberg (PPT instead of PI) and I&#39;m kind of in misery. Glad to see that it will hopefully be worth it

Damn right it&#39;ll be worth it, hun!
</p>
<p>
Just remember that every week, every day, it&#39;ll heal a little bit more which means things will get better.
</p>
<p>
I am curious though... Did you get a bolster packing as well? I vaguely recall that PPT doesn&#39;t require dilation to maintain its width, so I can&#39;t imagine it needs packing.

PPT does require dilation though you remember right that it is way easier, at week 2 I&#39;m doing 10 mins, 3x/day. I have absolutely no idea how people do 60 minutes, 10 mins is already agony to me. I also got a bolster packing, probably identical to the PI process
