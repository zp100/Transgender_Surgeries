So I recently upgraded to the soul source dilators instead of the standard straight ones, but I’m confused about one thing:
</p>
<p>
Do you put the curve up or down? I tried putting it going up but that was excruciating, but the dilator looks like it was built to curve up.
</p>
<p>
It’s slightly bigger than my old one (I’m using size 1, 1 1/8”, my old one was 26mm) so that may be it, but I’d appreciate some confirmation

It goes curve side up, but you put it in so that the end is straight in and the shaft is kind of at an angle pointing up, and then as you push it in slowly lower the shaft so that it&#39;s straight in, with the curve sticking up inside you

The curve goes up, with the dots on the top.
