Edit: Ugh, ridiculous typo in title. Or maybe Dr. Chett just gets the honor of having two titles for the purpose of this post.
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m currently researching surgeons for GCS and Chettawut was at the top of my list. For some reason I decided to look up his clinic which is located at:
</p>
<p>
Chettawut Plastic Surgery Center 1529, 4 On Nut 31 Alley, Khwaeng Suan Luang, Khet Suan Luang, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10250, Thailand +66 83 133 5836
<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/W6Tk2">https://maps.app.goo.gl/W6Tk2
</a>
</p>
<p>
I have to say the building looks quite run down and seems to be located in a very dumpy part of town. Chett has some really good reviews and some scary ones too. Looking at his clinic doesn&#39;t exactly inspire confidence.
</p>
<p>
Is this place actually safe? Is he equipped to handle medical emergencies?

Most of the complaints about him seem to be in regard to FFS. I would only ever consider him for GCS.

I have been there in person. It may not look
<em>
that
</em>
great from the outside, but on the inside it&#39;s super clean, comfortable and modern. To be honest I have felt quite similar- confused of why his clinic is just squished into a super small building besides mechanics - but ones I have stepped inside I have felt very welcome and completely convinced about his business.

It went great! No.complications and the amount of swelling/bruising is actually pretty minimal. I am quite surprised and very happy with the results. Mostly im sore with occassional twinges of sharp pain as nerves reconnect but its not too bad. Dilating has been annoying and only mildly painful around the bigger stitches. Over time I expect that to get better as I heal.

I wasn&#39;t either, to be honest. Most seem to be related to his FFS procedures and not GCS.  Still, they&#39;re very concerning.

I highly doubt the same surgeon could do both SRS and FFS to the same skill level, it seems far better to specialize and just do one thing really really well

It should bring you to the google maps page for his clinic and there are about 30 reviews, located by the stars at the top, by the clinic name. But yes they are mostly for ffs and not srs.

It&#39;s probably how he keeps his costs down, by working out of a small space in a private clinic.  Then again, the GCS surgeons at Preecha Aesthetic Institute (PAI) work out of a spacious, fancy looking multi story building, and do all their surgeries in a modern hospital.  And their costs are comparable to or lower than Dr Chettawut.  So I don&#39;t know.

I wanted the Thai method which is only performed in, well, Thailand and I couldn&#39;t be bothered to deal with the nonsense that is scheduling a surgery with Suporn/Banks, and I also can&#39;t afford almost the double of what Chettawut asks for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, while I am not a big fan of how vaginas look like in general (would still rather have a vagina than a penis), I do have a preference for the visual of (fully healed) Chettawut-made vaginas.
</p>
<p>
Not looking forward to dilating though, and staying 25 to 30 days in Thailand doesn&#39;t sound fun even though I understand why it is required.

I am not as young as you were when you had your surgery (I am 28, my surgery is in June) so maybe Chettawut will not care as much about the appearance of the vagina (you mentioned your age and potential future sex life being a concern for him). The material down there isn&#39;t particularly impressive either. However, who knows, maybe I will be pleasantly surprised with the results.
</p>
<p>
Of course I am hoping for the best, but even if doesn&#39;t look amazing, not having a penis anymore, not having to tuck, not having to take those awful anti-androgens that don&#39;t work very well on me anyways, being able to go to the beach without worrying (last time I went, I was 10 or so... way before dysphoria kicked in) - That will be great.

Take a look at this. I had my surgery with Dr. Chettawut 2 years ago. I think the result speaks for itself...
