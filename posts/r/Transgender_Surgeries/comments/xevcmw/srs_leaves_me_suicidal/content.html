It’s obviously still swollen. I can see the stitches in the picture. You need 9months to a full year for swelling to resolve. Don’t take your life over something that isn’t done healing yet. You have to wait longer.

You can not fix anything if you’re not here to fix it.  If it’s as bad as that, you need to contact a mental health professional AND a lawyer.

As far as I know no one has ever successfully sued a trans surgeons anywhere in the world.
</p>

Hopefully someone can suggest a better surgeon to revise this.

This is spectacular advice. The best advice possible.
</p>
<p>
Also for &#34;clean up&#34; jobs I use Santucci for penile inversion repairs and Bluebond Lagner for peritoneal pull throughs.
</p>
<p>
The crane center does a good job for repairs. I&#39;ve sent them some crazy shit and they&#39;ve done amazing work.

This!!

<p>
I’ve seen so many girls (two I’ve known personally) go to get revisions with Bluebond-Langner from Rumer’s disastrous work and turn it into a masterpiece! No joke! I’ve seen much worse and revisions are still possible! Please please PLEASE for the love of all this good and holy, DON’T GIVE UP!! Your life is too precious and you can still do this! As a survivor, it does get better if you continue to fight!

Interesting, I’ve heard similar things about the Crane Center, that they have been a frequent destination for femmes looking for revisions.

I think you are far too swollen to be able to know anything as of yet.

Revisions are surgeries. Surgeries require healing. You’ve got this girl.

How can the swelling be gone when you have all those stitches remaining? I don&#39;t want to gaslight you based on the images but it seems pretty clear you still have swelling. As for revisions, I had 3 revision with 3 different surgeons before the damage was repaired. Sometimes you have to wait and get another opinion. Youay need to take another step with a different surgical team. It not that uncommon.

I am all for reassurance but I worry the &#34;there&#39;s nothing wrong, it&#39;s swollen&#34; is actually just throwing salt onto the wound by invalidating your concerns. Sorry so many are doing that.

Absolutely, I don&#39;t want to invalidate your thoughts either; as far as I&#39;m and most of the others on here are aware, either you or OP could be just as correct. My goal with my comment was to try to restore some balance after seeing such a large percentage of the replies telling OP, essentially, that they are wrong.
</p>
<p>
Wrong though OP may be, I wanted to still offer support in stating that OP should not feel as if their judgement is in question, and hope to inspire other responses that offer thoughts and possible actions to take if OP is indeed correct. &#34;If you are right, here is what I would do...&#34; type responses so as to equip OP.
</p>
<p>
I think we can provide support no matter the true circumstance, and I genuinely hope that OPs outcome is better for having reached out to the community, read our responses, and followed a path not previously available to them for lack of knowing it existed.

Your swelling is way not gone my love. The stitches are proof positive of this fact. When your swelling is gone - the stitches will work themselves fully out.
</p>
<p>
You are swollen.
</p>
<p>
At least, this is my impression. How long ago was your surgery - and your revision

Any surgeon in the US would have told you that any revision involving the vulva and labia comes with signicant swelling. Far more than you would expect. It&#39;s the nature of the surgery.

I want to say more because you deserve support, please reach out anytime. I can talk with you and help find you resources. There’s always hope and happiness in the world. We are more than our body parts, we are more than our thoughts, and we are more than our emotions. What truly defines us is the actions that we choose to take in life, because our actions are the only thing we have control over. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, I’ve called 911 many times thinking I was dying. What has helped me the most is finding my purpose and focusing on what’s most important to me. I am almost a year post op and this year is the hardest year of my life. Recovery really put into tears and screaming thinking I’m botched and also thinking of committing suicide. When I asked myself “What’s most important to me?” I realized that this surgery define me; My family, friends and my career, School, Cats, Relationship, goals and aspirations, Volunteering and doing the things I love that feeds my soul are what’s most important to me. Remember that you have no control over your thoughts, or emotions, you can only control your actions. I hope you feel better my friend!

Hey, I know the feeling. Please don&#39;t do anything rash right now. I know you feel like there is no point and it&#39;s not going to get better.
</p>
<p>
It does, get better.
</p>
<p>
Yeah it&#39;s not looking great at the moment, I understand that. Hopefully like others have said it will look better after the stitches are out etc. I&#39;m sure that there is something that can be done if it&#39;s still not great in a few months.
</p>
<p>
I had issues as well. I tried to end myself after being in pain for 9 months but I failed. I&#39;m glad I failed, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m still alive. My pussy looks crap and I can&#39;t climax but I&#39;m more than just my genitals. So are you.
</p>
<p>
You have been through a hell of a lot to get to this point. Please don&#39;t fall at the last hurdle x

Let me just say this, it’s better to have too much material than not enough!!! You are actually in the best position to get your desired results. I know girls who would kill to have been blessed with your predicament, because it’s easily fixed. If you had no material to work with then I would would feel really sad, but instead I’m hopeful. P.s. bigger kittys are kinda hot to many people. I have a fat one and I love it. But I understand that after srs we are very hard on ourselves during the recovery process. Don’t give up, because you are a strong person, you are stronger than you realize. And the fact that you were so open and honest about your experience and showed us a picture speaks a thousand words. You will get through this, because the world is better with you in it, and we all need you. You are helping so many people by sharing your experience. I went to Dr. Jun in San Francisco California. I posted my pictures and he has done some amazing revisions. But honestly, if I were you, I would be hopeful knowing that you are in the best possible position to alter the appearance in the right hands. (If you even want to) ❤️❤️❤️

Consult with another doctor before doing anything . Ask another doctors . Plastic surgery is very developed these days so do not worry you can fix it easily (if there is any problem).

Just know that as long as your alive, you can work to make things better. Just remember how far you’ve come and take that confidence to push towards the result you want. Also remember that cis women have huge variation in their vulvas.

Find a DIFFERENT SURGEON and get another revision! There is still hope!!! It&#39;s terrible that you had to go through two bouts of inadequate SRS but you can still have what you want.  Please don&#39;t take your life

Please don’t harm yourself! You have a beautiful outcome! Even cis women are all different as far as appearance goes. No two the same. Once the swelling from surgery is gone, I’m sure it’ll look even better. Nothings ever worth taking your own life, nothing! Please stay strong!

Stop…stop gaslighting OPs feelings!!! Such bs. I hate how many of you think gaslighting is so helpful to people in distress! Horrible!

<p>
OP your feeling of concern and frustration is valid!!!
<strong>
<em>
DO NOT TAKE YOUR LIFE!!!!!

* you can find a lawyer and attrmpt to sue.,,,
</p>
<p>
Who is your doctor? Youll need another year before any revisions…until then dialate dialate dialate dialate. No vaginal stenosis ao the bext doc can help effectively.
</p>
<p>
You need assistance finding a doctor, theres groups and community. Whats your method of finding them?what and reflect on who or why you go to them.

Yeah, this really doesn&#39;t help.
</p>
<p>
People were saying the same about mine and it just made me feel worse that &#39;nobody&#39; was listening to me.

It still looks swollen though. I still see stitches, how long ago was your surgery? Please don’t give up I promise there is someone who could help.  Do you live in the USA? If so I would suggest seeing Dr. Dany Hanna for revision who is currently doing a lot of revisions for previous doctors in the field. If in Germany then maybe reach out to Dr. Yohan Hess

It’s got to be so hard right now for you, I can’t imagine. Surgery is already hard enough on the body, plus fluctuating hormones, then to mix it with results you find so undesirable. I’m sorry.
</p>
<p>
But please don’t take your life yet. In the end, too much tissue is better than not enough. Tissue can always be removed, but not added. Could you try seeking out a different surgeon?
