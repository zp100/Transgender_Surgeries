Hi ya&#39;ll. Just got back from my road trip consultations with Dr. BBL and Dr. Avanessian.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m struggling to decide between the two doctors. I thought I could list out a few of my observations and if anyone had an input I&#39;d really appreciate it because I&#39;m still unsure.
</p>
<p>
My consult with Dr. BBL was first and I am sort of unhappy with the consultation. This was a secondary consultation after my initial virtual consult. I felt sort of rushed in the consult. Dr. Zhao and Dr. BBL came in and spoke to me for about 4 minutes, asked if I had questions and left. I forgot to ask to see pictures (this is important) and was all the way back to my car and driving back out of NYC to my airbnb when I realized the only reason I had come to this appointment was to see pictures since they won&#39;t show them over a virtual consult. I drove back, waited an hour, and Dr. BBL flicked through photos for about 60 seconds with me before leaving again. It just felt... rushed. No description on how things were going to work no explanation of things in each photo to pay attention to, etc. I&#39;m frustrated because from what I remember, the results all looked good, but I can&#39;t remember specifics about anything because I only saw each picture fore about 2.5 seconds before she flicked to a new one.
</p>
<p>
With Dr. Avanessian, it was the exact opposite. She was in my room going over photos, showing different patients at different stages of healing, and going over the things I should notice (for example one shouldn&#39;t expect a pink &#34;hole&#34; if they do not have pink skin). She pointed out so many things that I would&#39;t have thought to ask about during my consult with Dr. BBL that it made me sad I hadn&#39;t scheduled my BBL appointment after so I could have had reference of a good consult to know what sort of questions to ask when it came to pics.
</p>
<p>
Here is my toss up. From what I remember, Dr. BBL had good results, regardless of whether I can remember everything or not. That being said Dr Avanessian had pretty good results also and I worry the small disparity I&#39;m remembering in results is because I just had more time to notice things when looking through results from Dr. Avanessian that I didn&#39;t have time to see with Dr. BBls results.
</p>
<p>
All that aside, I feel like I like the idea of Dr. Avanessians method because theoretically if something catastrophically bad happened, I could always go back and have a peritoneal pull through method to fix it. If I start off with that method it&#39;s game over if something awful happens. Dr. Avanessian is also scheduling sooner. I have an appointment in October (assuming my insurance comes through) whereas with Dr. BBL I can&#39;t even schedule my appointment until my insurance verifies they will cover (it&#39;s a whole big thing, I&#39;ve got an attorney helping me since my employer is refusing to cover). I don&#39;t blame her, but it&#39;s annoying that she has a massive wait list and it&#39;s only getting longer while I sit and wait for my employer to come to a resolution.
</p>
<p>
What is everyone else experiencing when comparing these two? I feel like I hear a lot about how good Dr. BBL is, but is Dr. Avanessian good also? Not as good? Bad even? I know she isn&#39;t as experienced but has done a few hundred of these surgeries in the time she&#39;s been doing them.
</p>
<p>
I think if I were to choose a doctor just on my perception on who is more experienced and who may have the better result it would be Dr. BBL, but there is something to be said for being hurried through a consult. I don&#39;t feel confident in choosing her anymore.
</p>
<p>
Edit to add: This isn&#39;t meant to bash either doctor in any way but just to voice my concerns after consults. I really want help with making a decision. If you made this decision, or are making this decision, what factors are you considering?

I haven&#39;t had surgery yet, but I consulted with both and ultimately decided to schedule with Avanessian. I think I found her to be a little more forward-thinking in some ways, a big example being that BBL told me I&#39;d have to stop hormones for a month before surgery, which is a really outdated requirement some surgeons have, and something that would probably make me suicidal for that month. Avanessian doesn&#39;t have any requirement like that.
</p>
<p>
I also really like Avanessian&#39;s method using the tunica graft, which basically means the inner half of your vaginal canal is self-lubricating and somewhat erogenous (from my understanding), and I think makes recovery somewhat easier / requires less dilation (not positive about that one)
</p>
<p>
I agree Mt. Sinai is very hard to get a hold of, but if you are persistent they provide VERY comprehensive care: I am getting free laser hair removal for surgery, I see a psychiatrist there, my PCP, I&#39;m getting a tracheal shave later this month with them, all for free through my Medicaid.
</p>
<p>
That said, I&#39;ve heard/seen great things about BBL, so I really think you can&#39;t go wrong, but if you&#39;re in a rush I think Avanessian is a solid option

Had Avanessian in December. No pictures but if you look at my post history I did a write up.
</p>
<p>
I really liked her, I was originally going for Ting, but when I heard he’s kinda.... eh.... they suggested her as she had a closer date. I’m glad I did.
</p>
<p>
Almost at 3 months now. Swelling is still there and it makes it hard to get in the mood to try and get off (sex drive is definitely there, but the swelling and tender parts make it like “ugh no fuck this”), but when I’ve tried to do clitoral stimulation. It good. =w=
</p>
<p>
Her bedside manner is impeccable and she responds to emails; I have colitis and I was kinda concerned (as was she) that I’d end up having a colostomy bag for the rest of my life and low and behold, nothing. Worst complications is some wound separation on the creases of my thighs, very light discharge, things are swollen but the aesthetics look great.
</p>
<p>
The only downside I have with her isn’t her, but more Mt. Sinai’s surgery office. They’re nice and cordial and everyone’s great but you gotta hound them to get things going. It’s less the people and more just running this in a large network of hospitals. But once you’re in, they take care of you super good.

I can’t speak to Mt Sinai but I had GCS with RBL a year ago and have been very happy with the results. I’d agree that the consult felt a bit short (and mine was pre Covid) but I wouldn’t necessarily let that sway you. Pre and post op and all the follow ups since, she and Dr Zhao have been super helpful and responsive. I’d recommend their program to anyone.

Thanks for your input. Yeah I definitely feel BBL does amazing work with Dr. Zhao, just not sure if it&#39;s that much better than Avanessian or if she is just hyped a bit? I&#39;d much rather get surgery this year if I can and the wait is way lower at Mt Sinai.

That’s definitely a factor and Mt. Sinai was on my initial list at the time. I found them very unresponsive and hard to work with (that may have changed now), and RBL had great reviews. I had zero issues with her, a great result, amazing depth and function. At the end of the day they are both fantastic choices! Good luck and lmk if you have other questions

that&#39;s great to hear about the depth and function! I just am so conflicted. I know BBL is sort of the gold standard but I just sort of don&#39;t know if Avanessian is that far behind. In addition to that, I just spoke with Cheryl and they&#39;re scheduling into 2023 and since I&#39;m having an issue with my insurance I can&#39;t schedule until that is sorted. I&#39;ll probably be working at a different place with different insurance by the time my surgery data actually comes if they&#39;re 2 years in the future.

A friend of mine went to Avenessian and she seemed very happy. That is a very long time to wait, and from what I hear of Dr. Ting’s methods and the CTMS you would have a fine result

I hope so. I know they use different methods but they achieve similar things. Just hoping someone can come in who may have considered these two and then selected Avanessian to comment their experience.

Wow December 2022. I don&#39;t even know when they&#39;ll let me schedule. I&#39;ll probably be scheduling in 2024 by then lol. I wish you both luck!

I gave up on Mt. Sinai after I could never get a hold of them. The last thing I want is to have complications after surgery and them get stuck in a game of phone tag that unfolds over 6 weeks.

Communication is not Mt. Sinai’s strong suit, and that could be a huge problem if you have issues post-op.  I never had any such issue with Dr. Bluebond-Langner’s office.  Almost 10 months post-op from them and super happy with my results!
