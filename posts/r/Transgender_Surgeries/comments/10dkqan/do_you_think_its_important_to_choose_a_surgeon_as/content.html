What I mean is that while researching and trying to choose who to consult with and possibly go with, I&#39;m worried about when I ultimately need to take the plane ride home.  I live in the Midwest, much closer to the east coast of US, but many of the surgeons higher on my list are on the west coast.  It just seems like a terrible idea to fly back minimum 4 hours or up to 8 if a layover while feeling completely wrecked.

No. It’s important to choose the best surgeon you can.

I am on the fence about this. I don’t think you should fly across the world, no. If you have complications you don’t want to be trying to fly 15 hours back to a foreign country. On the other hand, I don’t think you should try and stay in your own state just because they are there when it’s a brand new surgeon you’ve never heard of. If your insurance or finances permit, go to the very best surgeon you can even if it means traveling to the West Coast. The first surgeon to operate has the best chance of getting the best results and you want to get the best results.

yeah, that&#39;s a really good point.  Supposedly, my insurance will cover it, and if needed I have more than enough money sitting around to stay out there for weeks at air-b-n-bs if I have to...I could even just &#34;work from home&#34; for some of that period.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the advice and the rubber duck debugging :).

I went to a brand new surgeon who was just down the street from me, and I regretted it. I needed multiple surgeries elsewhere to fix things and have just had what I hope was my final one. I really liked him, and I hear the facility has gotten way better since then plus nothing went catastrophically wrong: things were just all done 50%. Ironically, the doctor who fixed things for me was only a 5 hour drive away in what was then one state over and I wish I had gone to him to begin with. If I had it to do all over again I would’ve waited however long it took to find the perfect doctor and probably would have waited until I was covered by my husband‘s insurance plan and gotten it covered by my number one pick even if I had to travel far away.

I did. I WAS WRONG. It was the biggest mistake of my life and cost me 4 years of surgery and recovery.

You went to the wrong one to be closer, is that what you meant?

Yes, there were a number of factors, but being 30 minutes away was helpful. The rest wasn&#39;t.

I couldn&#39;t even begin to add all the cost of work and surgery and therapy. It&#39;s cost me at least  $100k-$150k. This is above and beyond what insurance picked up.

You know own how hard it was and I&#39;m a married grown ass woman. For a younger person without a lot of resources or live experience, it would have been even worse.

No. You have only one chance to do this. I found the best surgeon available and that I could afford when I had SRS. Don&#39;t look for location. Look for quality.

So yea and no   Does it makes it easier  sure.  But in my mind I get one shot at this. And  I want the best.   So I’m temp moving to the new state   Getting their insurance   And getting the surgeon I want     More complicated/ expensive   Yes absolutely  but I think it will be worth it     Good luck

I also live in the Midwest and I’m planning to go to CA for SRS. None of the surgeons in the Midwest could consistently get results that met my standards so it was a pretty easy decision. I’m just planning to stay in CA for a month after surgery to give myself some extra recovery time before traveling home.

I chose a doctor closer to me but I think it’s best to just do your research and make the best decision for yourself my doctor was amazing but I also did research.

I picked a surgeon that was close, but also has a bit of renown.
</p>
<p>
I woudnt have went theew if i coud not find any info about him tho.
</p>
<p>
I cant say how good if a choice it was, because im only at week 8 and have a revision for visuals (witch was planned from the start).
</p>
<p>
But jeh, it go for good surgeon &gt; Distance. But a good combo of both &gt; only 1
