About 5 years ago, I had bottom surgery at GRS Montreal (Brassard). They don&#39;t/or didn&#39;t require electrolysis. I&#39;ve had hair growth inside the canal since, as well as intermittent discharge (infections?) that have been a bother. I&#39;ve wanted to get this taken care of for a long time.
</p>
<p>
Is this a common complication? Is it possible to fix without a resection (which I can&#39;t afford)? I&#39;m in the states and my insurance will cover bottom surgery but not this. And idk if anyone can like...fix this. It&#39;s gross and I want this fixed.

This is why I always say to have electrolysis no matter what the surgeon says. Every doctor who promises “scraping” and SWEARS you’ll have no hair inside ends up with patients in here later with just this issue. And that’s just the ones we find out about! It doesn’t happen to everybody, but it happens enough that why risk it at all? You are not to blame; you were mislead. I think the best doctors advise electrolysis every time on every patient any time a skin graft will be used in the body. “Scraping” can be used only as a back-up.

Just to be clears GRS doesn’t guarantee that they’ll get all the hair and it is clearly stated that hair growth is a possibility.

So sorry to hear you&#39;re going thru this. Definitely get yourself one of those endoscopic cameras that attach to your cellphone, so you can see what&#39;s going on inside. Amazon has a selection of them.
</p>
<p>
What color is your discharge?
</p>
<p>
You may need a revision of some sort, although im not sure what kind. Perhaps the doctors at GRS Montreal can do an assessment for you. If you&#39;re located in the states.. many of the top surgeons here are proficient in revisions. You may want to look for a surgeon that uses robotic PPT, that way they can see in side you easily.

I&#39;m in the states, and my current insurance wouldn&#39;t cover going abroad...they also won&#39;t cover any of the *big* surgeons, so I have to go with where they send me. I just don&#39;t get why you can&#39;t do electrolysis.
</li>
<li>
It only happens sometimes, but is green when it happens.
</li>
<li>
There is definitely hair growing inside the canal if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking lol, I can pluck it out / feel it as I pluck it out.

The reason you can’t get electrolysis post op is because the electrolysis probe needs to be inserted into the hair follicle at a specific angle, which can’t be done with the size of the probe and the walls of the vagina blocking it. It’s theoretically possible to engineer a probe with more degrees of freedom near the tip to accommodate more angles but hasn’t been done and would require special expertise if it ever did.
</p>
<p>
Realistically, you’d need to get a revision surgery

Yeah, a full resection of the canal is just not gonna happen...can&#39;t afford it, and if the pain is anything like bottom surgery was, it is gonna kill me. I seriously begged to be euthanized when I woke up the first time, lol!!! It&#39;s AGONY.

The electrologist can bend the needle itself even to 90°. I used to do that often to improve efficiency.
</p>
<p>
The real liminting factors are lack of light, visibility and maneuvering space.

I&#39;m interested in where the chronic infection site is. Does the discharge have an odor? Perhaps this is bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis.
</p>
<p>
The roboticist may be able to follicle scrape the hair sites since electro is out of the question.

Sometimes there&#39;s an odor, sometimes there isn&#39;t; sometimes there is discharge and sometimes there isn&#39;t. I always test negitive for BV, apparently it&#39;s &#34;just&#34; lukeheriah...but, it&#39;s also green, which means infection. So I don&#39;t get it.

Their booklet suggests having the internal hairs cauterized by a gynaecologist.

Can you tell please, when, who do this? In what country?

<p>
I have lots of hair inside and living in Argentina doesn&#39;t helps. I&#39;m bleeding every dilation at 14 months, bad odors all the time and douching doesn&#39;t helps, as douching never reaches the end of the canal.

Im in the US, so I don&#39;t know the situation there, but here you can sometimes get a gynecologist to do it. Should be doable after 6 months.

Thanks. Could you please share how is the actual procedure? What instruments the gyn used? What chemicals?

I&#39;m try to ask for it here. At least I&#39;ll try. But I need to know the exact procedure to replicate here.

Silver nitrate is the substance used. Its a cauterizing substance that is just dabbed on any hyper granular tissue or hair follicles. It is usually applied with a stick. The last time I had it done the only instrument needed was a speculum. Little discomfort, took five minutes at most.
</p>
<p>
Its a fairly common procedure in gynecological work here so they might know what you mean if you ask to put silver nitrate on the problem areas.

Thank you so much! I live in Argentina and medical people aren&#39;t updated on many things here. And they are so prejudiced when they have a case of a neovagina.... It&#39;s shameful but it&#39;s like that... In the Northern part of the continent, things are much better, your more advanced. Here, even physical therapists won&#39;t touch you to release pelvic floor muscles, as they have to &#34;put fingers inside your vaj&#34;, it&#39;s a so prejudiced population..

&#34;Should hair regrow in the vaginal cavity, your doctor can, one year after surgery, remove them with a long pair of tweezers during your speculum examination. If regrowth is extensive, a gynecologist can burn the hairs with a surgical cautery. This procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia.&#34;

This happened to me after Brassard as well. I was referred by my gyno to a doctor who specializes in medical lasering and my provincial healthcare covered it. It was a day surgery and I was put under general anesthesia for the procedure. She was not someone who specializes specifically in trans stuff, as I guess there are other applications for medical lasering. I haven&#39;t been to a gynecologist since, but I think it was successful, as I used to be able to feel those damn hairs when I dilated and I don&#39;t anymore.
</p>
<p>
My provincial healthcare does not cover cosmetic laser or electrolysis, but did cover this, so it is possible that your insurance will make the same distinction.

Hey, I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re going through that. She is just a doctor who works for the public health care system in Alberta, Canada. It&#39;s not a private practice.

yeah im having this same issue at 8 months. the turn around time from when i got my surgery date to when i actually went to GRS Montreal was like within a month. i didn&#39;t have time to get electrolysis, but i thought it would be fine since they said so. now im having a white discharge and sometimes pinky red when i pee and when i vaginal douche. it smells and i can tell that there&#39;s definitely hair growth inside. its also made dilating uncomfortable to the point where I&#39;ve stopped for the moment. not happy with this complication and kinda feel ashamed that I&#39;ve let it get this bad. 😔

It’s somewhat common, but extremely difficult to get rid of deep hair. You should continue to try as reoccurring UTS’s can be dangerous in the long term.

<p>
Surgeon&#39;s don’t require hair removal, because let’s face it, they got paid and it’s not their problem.

You might be able to find an electrologist who could try treating the hair(s), but it will be challenging and slow, and it might not be effective. My electrologist mentioned doing it before, but she has been working for 30 years, with trans clients since the beginning. I also don&#39;t know how deep she was working.
</p>
<p>
Still, electro will be the cheapest and least invasive option even if it has only a slim chance of being effective in this case.

Are you pulling the hair out? If so what happens if you just leave it?

I&#39;m not OP, but after 14 months post-op I have extreme bad odor there, and 2 clusters of hair: one 2 cm in the entrance who can be seen at simple sight, then another cluster deep inside the canal. In total 10-15 hairs, longing 5-6 cm each one.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t pluck them being so deep, and still bleeding while dilating, and a perpetual smell that never goes and isn&#39;t pleasant. Once I get to 1x day dilation, or 2x a week, the bad odor becames unsurmountable.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t imagine having sex with a partner and he get the hair in his penis, giving a extreme bad sensation.

Maybe it is a stupid question, but would it be possible to do laser, since eletrolysis is not an option?

You can open the vagina canal with a speculum and use a laser equipment which has a pen like pointer.
</p>
<p>
Now, I don’t think it would be easy to find any common clinic willing to go through the trouble.  But I suppose is entirely possible and the cost, risks, and everything would be incomparably smaller than changing the canal.
</p>
<p>
For reference: Video of pelvic examination with a speculum:

Laser with pointer pen-like equipment:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://centre-biotechnique-avance.com/11.05.02/DM-7050-USA-1YWR_UPC_639713495911.htm">https://centre-biotechnique-avance.com/11.05.02/DM-7050-USA-1YWR_UPC_639713495911.htm</a>
</p>
<p>
I believe a gynecologist willing to do something like that can rent the kind of equipment.
</p>
<p>
Again, I know it is a way out of the box suggestion and maybe there are other impediments I can’t see cuz I am neither gynecologist nor dermatologist, nor a doctor whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
Edit:
</p>
<p>
Turns out it is not such a stupid idea.
</p>
<p>
Vaginal rejuvenation laser:

.
</p>
<p>
A clinic that do a procedure like that, usually don’t do only one thing. And possibly do have the equipment for hair removal. It might be just a matter of finding a place willing to do the job.

That&#39;s almost impossible here in Argentina. Even people who are in &#39;&#39;gender things&#39;&#39;.
