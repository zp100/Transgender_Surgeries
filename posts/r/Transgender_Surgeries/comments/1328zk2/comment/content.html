Hello!
<br>
I had a surgery with her on my forehead (type 3 reconstruction) and I have complaints. I have a visible bump on my forehead now and she put the frontal sinus (?) bone too deep, so between my brows there is a small pit now as well.
<br>
I came to other surgeons for a consultation and they all said that the bone placed too deep Anna on the other hand refuses to admit it and says I&#39;m just making it up lol.
<br>
I noticed the bump when the swollen part of the forehead began to go down and immediately wrote to her, the answer I got was: &#34;it&#39;s the threads, they will dissolve&#34; (although after the surgery it has been a couple of months). The bump is still there and I am looking for a surgeon for revision (and as they told me, revision of such work is harder than to do the type 3 surgery itself). Also other surgeons recommend non-permanent methods of fixing it such as fillers lol and that makes me worried that I will have uneven forehead for the rest of my life.
<br>
In the end, given my personal experience with her and the unsatisfactory result, I can&#39;t recommend ffs with her

I also don’t think she does a good job with orbital contouring at all. All her orients who have deep set eyes due to orbitals , still do after surgery.

Haha no way!! I hope you can get it sorted! I’ve no ever understood her hype around forehead work, it doesn’t compare to other cheap options like Cardenas even if people complain, there’s no botch jobs and he deffo knows how to sort it out.
</p>
<p>
I’m desperate and will be going to her for chin and jaw tho in the future , it’s hard to find anyone decent in still not set on her.

I’ve known her and been following her (her academy work) for a long time already, since 2016. I intended to have surgery with her (right now, in this month) and had been planning for it for about half a year. My initial contact with her was in fall of last year. I had a video consultation with her a while later, which was great. Her computer-aided 3D visualization technique based on multi-slice CT imaging is awesome. However, after that consultation, things began moving south. Through the years, I’ve done my share of research on FFS, so I had a bullet list of questions. By the beginning of February, 10 weeks before the intended surgery date, none of my questions had been answered. Even more scary, she couldn’t tell me what hospital she would perform the surgery at, if there would be a recovery home or at least trans-friendly 24x7 nursing, if transportation would be arranged for, heck, she couldn’t even tell me me what country she’d be operating in: if it would be Armenia or Georgia. Besides, she started getting quite rude and showed zero sensitivity for my concerns as a TG patient with severe dysphoria. That was the point where I opted out. These are the facts. The following is mere speculation, however, I have a feeling that she would deny that any of this is true or has even ever happened. It’s somehow sad because I truly think that she’s an extremely skilled and talented surgeon who doesn’t only have superb technical skills, but also the eyes and the esthetic sense of an artist. I find it quite sad that she totally sucks at the organizational and customer service part.

I thought we speak about surgery results, not about customer service.  I don&#39;t like bullshiting instead of doing my job either.
</p>
<p>
Probably it&#39;s kind if misconception that the doctor has to be seller everywhere outside USA and FacialTeam

Well, the thing is, I would have loved being able to speak about surgery results, but I never made it that far. I just mentioned a couple of points ― I never got any answers to my questions regarding the medical side of the procedure neither. “Customer service” is a stretchable term. Personally, I don’t consider knowing if there’s a recovery home or trans-friendly private nursing “customer service”, but rather a central aspect of quality post-op care and hence, of active risk management. It has absolutely
<em>
nothing
</em>
to do with being a “seller”. That’s a wild misconception. It’s about giving a patient who’s going to have a
<em>
major
</em>
surgery ― for many perhaps*
<em>
the
</em>
most life-changing procedure ever ― the feeling and the reassurance that they’re not only in good hands while they’re on the OP table, but also just as much from the moment they come out of the surgery room, and will be taken care of the whole time until they feel able to be on their own again. The feeling of being alone and lost can be devastating, even more so for an emotionally already heavily taxed TG patient, and particularly after a major surgery which leaves the patient basically helpless for some time. I wouldn’t even want to imagine what it would be like to wake up from surgery, weak, swollen, maybe unable to see properly, and then finding myself in an uncontrolled and hence possibly transphobic environment. A guaranteed, top-notch aftercare in a well-controlled, gender-affirming environment is just as important as the results of the actual surgery, and I think that the overwhelmingly positive feedback of patients who attended clinics with integrated or closely attached, gender-affirming recovery facilities prove my point. That said, I don’t see what this has to do with the location of the surgeon or clinic ― be it the U.S. or anywhere else. And it’s kind of funny that you mentioned FacialTeam because I’ve been there, had a consultation with them, but they completely failed to deliver on their “gold standard” promises. In fact, the only thing “golden” I was able to see there in Marbella was the gold plating in the lobby of their clinic. But that’s a different story.

We would get a lot more benefit from post-op FFS images that we more clinical in nature. It&#39;s not a reflection on you result or looks, it&#39;s just more inline with the nature of the sub. People want to asses the surgeons work, which looks fairly good, in the grid photo, but beyond that, there&#39;s no way to make any critique, based on angular selfie images.
</p>
<p>
My first question to someone considering Russia is, will FFS surgery remain legal under the proposed legal clampdown? As bad as things have become here in 1/3 the US, it sounds like it&#39;s significantly worse there. After everything that has happened in the last 2 years here, I have a new appreciation for the struggles our community faces all over the world.

Well, you were! Your results are dramatic. There is no trace of that guy in your post-op photos. You look like a completely different person ijs.

Great result! I’m looking to consult Anna for a Brow shave, rhino and jaw shave. Do you have any complaints or concerns with your forehead / browbone work? Thank you 😊

Hi again! Just wondering. How did you pay for your surgery? Did you enter Armenia with Cash on hand? Or were you able to somehow withdraw when you arrived to the country? Could you share a bit about that? Thank you so much!

I got surgery when we both lived in Russia, Moscow so there was not a problem for me with money.  I suppose there&#39;s no issue with card payment, but you could always call to your bank to approve payment, or you could discuss with them about the further expenses before leaving country
