I‚Äôm CIS, so I understand if this post isn‚Äôt allowed, but I had FFS with Dr. Mardirossian 3 days ago. Forehead contouring, brow lift, and rhino/septoplasty. I just wanted to share my results to help others decide on their surgeon!

I actually think this is super helpful, not only for the surgeon&#39;s results but also in showing the wide range of shapes and sizes that cis women come in. The results look great, hope you have a quick recovery!!

I just showed my wife, who has had FFS, and she was super impressed. It was also really cool for her to see that cis women also might want surgeries normally considered transgender surgeries.

That‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôm glad I could help even just a small amount. As a cis woman who didn‚Äôt know a lot about the FFS process, these subs and other pages have been such a blessing for me to help research all of the different surgeons and procedures out there.

Yes, this is right after surgery before all of the swelling kicks in. Surgery day, there wasn‚Äôt much swelling or bruising but that quickly changed haha. Day 2 and 3 were a little rough. My eyes were black and I had chipmunk cheeks to the point where my right eye was almost swollen shut. Day 4 now and my swelling has decreased to the point where my eye is open but I‚Äôm still pretty puffy. I‚Äôd say mild to uncomfortable pain around all the incisions but it was the nose aspect of it that has been the worse so far in recovery. All of my cuts have been really well hidden. Since I had a lower hairline, I opted for the coronal incision that goes ear to ear, so it wasn‚Äôt so noticeable along the hairline. The nose one is only noticeable right at the opening along the septum. I haven‚Äôt seen it without the stitches or nose cast on yet, but I think it will fade nicely since it‚Äôs so small.

Cis and trans only exist because we assign gender at birth anyway.  If we stopped doing that, we&#39;d just be women getting the same procedures

This is helpful. I&#39;m scheduled for surgery with Mardirossian in July. My forehead looks like a more pronounced version of your before but with a less scooped or less curved nose.
</p>
<p>
Your results look amazing and it&#39;s encouraging I picked the right surgeon. Because although Mardirossian planned other procedures, the forehead is the most bothersome to my dysphoria and what I lost want changed. Did you have a type 3 forehead?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for posting and good luck on recovery.

Glad I could help! Yes, I had a type 3 forehead. I went with type 3 and the coronal incision instead of the hairline. My forehead was my most bothersome attribute as well. I only really touched my nose because I was already going under and decided to fix a pretty significant deviated septum at the same time (can‚Äôt see it from these pictures). The aesthetic changes with the nose and the more pronounced swoop were actually discussed pretty much at my preop appt because he thought it would give an overall improved look and I agreed. Let me know if you have any specific questions about the process or JMC!

He did an amazing job on your forehead. I&#39;m encouraged by you picture.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m getting a type three forehead as well. I probably will have the other kind of incision though.
</p>
<p>
He also said there was a problem with the functionality of my nose. I forget what it&#39;s called. My nose is extremely thin and my nose holes restrict my breathing. So he said he would fix that.
</p>
<p>
I do have a question. Did you fly out to Jupiter for the surgery? If where did you stay and how was it? I&#39;m looking for an affordable place to stay that would be convenient.
</p>
<p>
And how was the healing process and pain?

I ended up driving 8 hours to Jupiter. Im with my dad who teaches virtually, so we needed either a place with 2 rooms or an Airbnb so I didn‚Äôt have to hear him teach all day. We ended up choosing the Hilton Homewood Suites, which has been really convenient for us because it has a full kitchen, living room and a bedroom. You can probably choose a cheaper option if you don‚Äôt need the space. The hotel is also less than a mile from his office and about 3 miles from JMC.  For our two bedroom suite, it was about $180/night.

thanks sharing :)
</p>
<p>
any surgery results are very useful data points in figuring which surgeons are good to go with.
</p>
<p>
and your starting point is similar to many of us, as what your surgical goals probably were so it is highly useful.
</p>
<p>
i should also say that your results are really nice :)
</p>
<p>
hope you have a great recovery :)
