<p>
this time a little different in my format cause i haven&#39;t tracked much of my progress, cause when released from hospital in week 2 i still had a bladder infection, then got a stronger flu in week 3 to 6/7 and then got covid at week 9 till 13 so keep this in mind pls and also that&#39;s a reason for fewer pics especially in the covid timeframe.
</p>
<p>
but lets get started
</p>
<p>
week 5: i still only dilated with the smaller ones and only every other day till the stitches are healed, but feeling inside is getting better. Also my gynecologist has seen the result in this week and said its really good already but is also seeing that a lot of stuff needs to heal further
</p>
<p>
Week 6: nothing special
</p>
<p>
Week 7: started to dilate everyday now, still only the Number 1, 2 and 3 from Vagiwell. Only 1 time a day though
</p>
<p>
Also i started using a scar gel from Bepanthen to help with hardening scar tissue around my vagina
</p>
<p>
Later in week 7 i started to dilate 2 times a day cause the stitches were healed
</p>
<p>
week 8: in the beginning new depth is 10 - 10.5 cm now (on Day 60 in this week i most likely got infected with covid)
</p>
<p>
Week 9: started to use Number 4 too and removed Number 1 (on Day 62 in this week i got covid symptoms)
</p>
<p>
since i was close to unable to move my body and due to all the burning i stopped dilation, using the scar gel, and was only douching a little bit down there
</p>
<p>
Week 10: covid, have done nothing here
</p>
<p>
Week 11: i had dried up blood in my vagina cause the care was to less (notice to you all and myself, ALWAYS douche regularly down there even if you don&#39;t have the energy (except your surgeon told you otherwise), dilation was hurting
</p>
<p>
Later that week i have seen progress again in terms of dilation and it got better
</p>
<p>
Week 12: removed Number 2 and introduced Number 5 again. Dilation schedule for me now.
</p>
<p>
3 - 10 minutes
</p>
<p>
4 - 15 minutes
</p>
<p>
5 - 15 minutes. 2 times a day
</p>
<p>
Week 13: started and is the end for this thread for now
</p>
<p>
next will be in 3 Months when i do the follow up for month 6
</p>
<p>
As everytime, if you have any further questions just go ahead and ask :3
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Edit: i also know the pricing for this surgery, it was 10,614.91€ so with the first step it is all in all 31,421.63€
</p>
<p>
might be interesting for some

I wished I would have been able to see him after my revision but he was going on vacation after my surgery 😅
</p>
<p>
But i agree with you when I had him after my first surgery, but all of the team are really nice and gave me a great feeling :3
</p>
<p>
Edit: also my initial surgeon was klemenz, he has done the major part, Merz has done the revision :3

Thanks for sharing. I hope you treat your scars well and once they get a bit less visible I think you will have a nice result for your vagina.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes for your further transition 😸

Maybe gonna start scar treatment again in like a month or so and hope they get better, but in the end who knows and with time and the years coming they should also get less visible :3

Dunno why they do the clitoris that way but i like it and it&#39;s really nice also for stimulation (it&#39;s actually not only just a clitoris head but also with some arms, maybe they try to mimic a natal clitoris which is also more then just the head this way)

I know they use the app doctolib
</p>
<p>
Otherwise
<a href="mailto:sprechstunde@lubos-kliniken.de" rel="nofollow">sprechstunde@lubos-kliniken.de
</a>
might be helpful but don&#39;t know if that&#39;s for international ones too
</p>
<p>
What also might help is this site
<a href="https://www.doctolib.de/klinik/muenchen/chirurgische-klinik-muenchen-bogenhausen-muenchen/booking/specialities" rel="nofollow">https://www.doctolib.de/klinik/muenchen/chirurgische-klinik-muenchen-bogenhausen-muenchen/booking/specialities
</a>
-&gt; &#34;Geschlechtsangleichung&#34; -&gt; your insurance (since international most likely use &#34;privat versichert&#34; (that&#39;s private)) -&gt; international patient
</p>
<p>
But from what I see they don&#39;t have appointments for this year anymore, but from what I&#39;ve heard they might open the ones for next year in October

Looks beautiful sis :) Is 10,5cm depth the norm. Is it difficult to get 15cm for example? Os it different between markovsky and other surgeons/teams? :)

Depends on your anatomy, how much material you have and how much place you have in that region
</p>
<p>
10.5 is definitely not my end goal and I was at 13 cm after my first surgery and I&#39;m getting back to it but it&#39;s hard if you weren&#39;t really allowed to dilate for the first month and then only with the short ones so the fistula isn&#39;t getting ripped open again
</p>
<p>
Also from what I experienced depth is also variable, if I&#39;m errect i can fit in larger stuff then what I would be able to while dilating and I doubt that this has changed with revision (still didn&#39;t have sex with my bf cause he wants to wait till I&#39;m comfortable with 5LS again)

That looks really good! Looks like the same technique Dr Brassard did with mine. It should be all downhill from this point on!

I guess by downhill they mean the analogy of biking uphill or downhill, where downhill is effortless and enjoying the breeze

It ensures me even more that they do great work and hopefully I can manage to make  surgery date on Friday or few days later.

Looks incredible! I was considering this surgical team aswell. Were you circumcised? How much depth is common with them?

It was written on the documents when you had your preliminary examination there it was written on the file, except if it&#39;s the revision then it will be told you shortly prior to surgery cause the surgeon is also going to talk to you then
