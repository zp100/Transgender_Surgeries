The quack I went to to have my surgery seems to be known for nerve damage. How long did it take you to regain sensation in the lower lip and chin areas? Other than feeling botched, the thought of being permanently numb terrifies me.

Thanks. It has been 2 months and I&#39;m still numb. Some of this doctor&#39;s patients reported that even after 6 months they are still partially numb. Some even years after are the same which scares me. I only found out later. I wish I went to Facial Team instead as they seem to be risk aversed.

Where are you based? I would suggest getting checked by another OMFS preferably with some plastic surgery experience too. Some OMFS also perform nerve surgery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m gonna see one after lockdown is lifted about my concerns and hopefully I can also get some scans done to see what was done to my poor jaw and chin and look for any signs of nerve damage if possible.

I looked at your posts from last year. It seems that they were conservative in their approach to your jaw and chin surgery which is a good thing. Your issue maybe to do with the nerve and soft tissues. An OMFS should have an idea of what could be causing it as they make those incisions for jaw surgery etc. If you&#39;re in London your best option would be to see the surgeons in well known clinics in Harley Street.

What are you doing to encourage nerve regeneration?  Have you been recommended any particular vitamins, physio etc?  If you are a month postop, there are things you can do to stimulate it&#39;s progress, although nothing can be guaranteed.
</p>
<p>
In general numbness will continue to subside for over the months until regaining &#34;normality&#34; after some months, but this varies greatly depending on the procedure, age, health. It&#39;s a process that takes time and from one day to the next you probaly won&#39;t feel much progress.
</p>
<p>
As with any surgery, it probaly won&#39;t be the same as before, but the difference is unnoticeable in most patients.  Tingling and itching are all very good signs that things are healing.

No recommendation from the surgeon that performed my surgery in Belgium. Heck he did not even want to see me for my 1 week post op and asked me to get my sutures from his botched lipo to get them removed myself and remove the bandages on my face myself. I explained during the consultation that I will be in Belgium for 1 week and that my flight is next week Monday afternoon. I thought it was clear and he said okay let&#39;s DO THAT! Guess what the day after the surgery he forgotten about it and was suggesting I can and should fly back early. I repeated that I will be in Belgium for ONE WEEK! He said ok! Monday came and guess what my appointment was not in his diary. Receptionist had to check with the practice manager.    I may also have a suture left which has been eaten by my body under my chin. He possibly forgot that too or intended for it to remain under my chin. I have no idea what offence I had done to this surgeon that he left me with open incisions, bump under my chin, hemosiderin stain on my entire upper neck, thinner lip that had rolled in and has now developed bumps when I smile. My neck feels tight too and my face shape is of an odd shape now and disproportionately smaller. And another thing in week 2 I had intense cold and hot sensation to my entire chin that was so painful as if my chin was being squeezed from the inside I had to take pain killers.....

Ok, try to remain serene and positive--it&#39;s better for your healing-- it sounds like it is still early days yet. Recommendation: approaching your coordinator with just one main issue, the numbness and if what they suggest you do for this, in a calm manner. This might at least get some of the advice you need at the moment. Just some ideas, hope to help.

Well there&#39;s not much I can do with the numbness. If it was just that that I have to be patient about then yes I can wait. Unfortunately, the so called surgeon or more apt the dentist performed botched lipo on my upper neck and shaved so much of my jaw and advanced my chin so much my face looks messed up. Even local dentist that took the OPG looked shocked when he saw my X Ray.....

Most of it came back by 4 months. Still had numbness in my lower lip and chin area that lasted close to a year.

That&#39;s good to hear. I hope mine will come back in 4 months. 1 year is long wait. I would possibly assume the surgeon fucked up big time if that was me.

I had about 20-30% sensation on one side of my lower lip immediately after waking up. The other side took 5 weeks to wake up to about 5-10% sensation. I think mine came back really quickly.
</p>
<p>
During the pre-op appointment I mentioned how scared I was of losing sensation, and I was told 12-24 months for sensation to return wasn&#39;t totally abnormal.
</p>
<p>
I also read on here that someone who lost feeling permanently said it may have been salvageable had they gotten a CAT/MRI scan early enough for medical intervention on the pinched/damaged mental nerve.

I don&#39;t like feeling numb for too long. It makes me anxious like something went wrong or nerves got severed. But you went to an experienced surgeon so permanent numbness is possible but very unlikely. Did you get feelings back? Like 100%?
