<em>
(see post history for previous entries about this surgery)
</em>
</p>
<p>
This (belated) post covers month 2/week 8 post-op. There&#39;s big news about swelling &amp; stitches!
</p>
<h1>
Swelling
</h1>
<p>
I don&#39;t know exactly what happened but outer swelling went
<em>
way
</em>
down in the course of two-ish days. The entrance also contracted (completing the scar contraction phase) but has been getting better.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s still lopsided though! I think it&#39;s actually granulation tissue all on one side of the canal though, after looking/feeling at it a bit.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happier about the aesthetics now too. I didn&#39;t realize how swollen the area had been until now.
</p>
<h1>
Dilation
</h1>
<p>
The outer contraction peaked maybe a day or two after my week 7 post. A couple mornings it took probably 5 minutes to get the full girth of the dilator past the entrance, but after that it was easy since luckily the canal had already went through the contraction phase in earlier weeks.
</p>
<p>
I might have &#34;lost&#34; a bit of length due to all the swelling going away too. By a &#34;bit&#34; I mean like 1/3 a dot on the dilator.
</p>
<h1>
Stitches
</h1>
<p>
The swelling going down meant that there was even
<em>
more
</em>
suture unravelling/hanging out, so I finally decided to get some of them out. I spent 2 hours with a hand mirror, tweezers, and clippers, trying to figure out where/how to snip them. They&#39;re basically invisible, with teeny little knots/loops, so I ended up having to feel my way...with pokey metal things. Not fun.
</p>
<p>
I still have some left in, in the inner labia, but those don&#39;t bother me too much for now (and I can&#39;t figure out where the knots/loops are that are keeping them in).
</p>
<h1>
Healing
</h1>
<p>
Feeling has come back to the bottom rim of the entrance completely but the rest of the inner labial-things are still numb to touch. I can feel the nerves healing though.
</p>
<p>
Granulation tissue seems to be slowly going away! And the last of the protein stuff has been gone for awhile now.
</p>
<p>
I think I can start adding light exercise - once I get over this cold I&#39;ll start doing a relaxed yoga session daily.
</p>
<p>
Mentally: everything&#39;s fine like it has been. No post-op blues. I have my mental energy back for dealing with ASD-related stuff, I guess.
</p>
<h1>
Conclusion
</h1>
<p>
The last month has been pretty good. Dilation has turned out to be a nice routine and helps structure my life right now. I&#39;ve scheduled my 3-month check-up a bit early so that&#39;ll happen in a few weeks.
</p>

Nope! Maybe after labiaplasty. Im not yet claiming it&#39;s anything close to pretty/finished/cis/whatever so there&#39;s really no point right now IMO.

Gotcha.  I am on the road with surgeries scheduled, but this is something that really raises curiosity.

It raises mine too, lol. There&#39;s no picture out there from someone who had the same surgery and later a labiaplasty.

I&#39;m suuuuuper curious about how the labia will turn out tbh.
</p>
<p>
Been waiting for this option for a few years now, so like, thank you for being one of the first to give it a go and share with all of us. My decision to go thru with it sort of depends on whether the labia/visual result is good.

Penile preserving? As in, you still have your penis?

Yup
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a really rare surgery that&#39;s hard to find a surgeon for.

There are 3 surgeons in the US who will definitely do it. What might be hard is finding a local surgeon willing to do it, especially in other countries.
</p>
<p>
The more people who talk about the option with their surgeon, the more surgeons will learn how to perform it, and the more surgeons might be found who are willing and able to to perform it.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t hurt to ask a surgeon about it if you&#39;re interested in it. You might be surprised.

It’s a valid option for NB folks. If it’s not right for you, then don’t get it for you.
