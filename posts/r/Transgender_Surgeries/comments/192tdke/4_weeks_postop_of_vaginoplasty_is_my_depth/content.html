I had Vaginoplasty 4 weeks ago today. The surgeon told me they were able to give me 15cm of depth. But since day one of dilating I‚Äôve only got 9cm of depth. It‚Äôs been 4 weeks. I‚Äôve dilated 60+ times and for longer than they ask. That‚Äôs about 20 hours of dilating. Still about 9-9.5 cm of depth. Is my depth pointless? Is this a complete failure?
</p>
<p>
I keep asking if this is normal to instantly lose depth and I get no answer from doctors. I‚Äôve been told to keep dilating to work on depth, but that depth is gone right? When I ask the physical therapist she just says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, this must be really frustrating. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve sent a msg to the surgeon asking again and haven‚Äôt heard back.
</p>
<p>
Is this fucked?

Pelvic floor physical therapy asap! It&#39;s probably not lost yet. I reached like 6 extra centimeters after the 2 month mark. Change PT if your current one isn&#39;t helping. Also try muscle relaxers.

The depth is not necessarily gone yet, but you can lose depth rapidly after surgery if you dont adequately dilate to maintain the depth. Your surgeon says you had 15cm, so that&#39;s still mostly possible probably but you need to get it back quickly. My surgeon told me that there is some possibility to expanding depth a bit in the weeks after surgery with aggressive dilating, but that window is short.
</p>
<p>
That will require you working on your pelvic floor strength and pushing yourself when dilating. The primary cause of loss of depth is weak pelvic floor muscles that get too tight to be penetrated. The opening created in those muscles will heal in a way that does not allow penetration if dilating isnt done adequately to keep it open.
</p>
<p>
Start with pelvic floor exercises (look up physical therapy exercises) and trying to get greater depth each time you dilate. But be careful not to injure yourself by dilating too hard.

That&#39;s not great. That&#39;s not going to accommodate most phallus. You might wanna push back on that response and ask what went wrong to lose 6 cm because it seems the surgeon doesnt think that&#39;s a negative outcome.

Did the doctor dilate you the first time? I did my in the dr office and she pushed it the rest of the way when I thought I had bottomed out

The physical therapist did, then the nurse practitioner did, then the surgeon did. They all couldn‚Äôt get deeper than 9cm.

Are you fit and have you done pelvic floor therapy? Chances are the issues is your lack of control of the pelvic floor if that is the case. You can‚Äôt just shove it up there as there is muscles that need to be relaxed.

I&#39;m having the same issue, did you figure anything out? I lost one dot on the dilator already, not I&#39;m starting to lose another. I dilate 30+ mins every time and do my best to get as much depth as I can but it&#39;s like I&#39;m going backwards, I can barely get the blue dilator in where it was easy before

I ended up having a revision for depth. But because of all the scar tissue it made dilating hard. Scar tissue was tough to deal with because my doctor wouldn‚Äôt listen to me about what I was feeling. So now I‚Äôve had two surgeries and have 3‚Äù of depth. I am waiting for a 3rd surgery now. I have non-stop discharge too.

That‚Äôs what I get. A lot of people apologizing to me. Now trumps in office, I feel suicidal, don‚Äôt seee a point and yet I still dilate. It‚Äôs a lonely place because everyone is uncomfortable about talking about failed trans surgeries and the doctors all like to gaslight. I feel fairly helpless and pointless. Pain and losing sexual function sucks. But, what can I do?

I would ask the surgeon for a revision for what he told you on the pre-op appointments would be the outcome of the surgery.

Also, to note. The surgeon is a female. It‚Äôs interesting how most assume the surgeon must be male.

How do you revise the depth? Going through the surgery was hell. I can‚Äôt imagine doing it all again.
