Some of it is from being unable to do anything I enjoy.  I don&#39;t really like tv, video games, or reading.  I like being social, being active, and being productive.  FML, right?
</p>
<p>
Some of it is from tapering off my meds, I&#39;m nearing the end and this is pretty common for people.  Although I thought I had such a gradual reduction I could beat it.
</p>
<p>
And there&#39;s also loneliness.  My friend who was here for a couple weeks has left.  I can&#39;t have other people over bc nobody else knows why I had surgery, and bc I can&#39;t clean anything up enough to invite someone anyway.
</p>
<p>
No matter the reasons for it, I can&#39;t rationalize my way through it.  There&#39;s no pep talk to make it better.  The happiest thought I have is someone ending it all for me while I sleep.  And I know that&#39;s not ok but I can&#39;t do this anymore and it&#39;s not like I&#39;ll be better any time soon.  I haven&#39;t been happy in three days and I have months left of this.
</p>
<p>
At least if I die it&#39;s in the right body.
</p>
<p>
Update:
</p>
<p>
Ok, this is not fun.  I had breathing issues due to fires.  Sneezed and started bleeding.  Can&#39;t be depressed when you need to save your vagina, lol.
</p>
<p>
Friend brought me Benadryl and watched Hamilton.  I cried the whole day.  She was actually really annoyed with it, but we ended up ok.
</p>
<p>
Since then I have been up and down.  The problems are both chemical and environmental.  I&#39;m really not able to do anything about it.
</p>
<p>
I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to have support after surgery.  I have been through so much in life but it&#39;s only after surgery that I get that dark.  It can break very strong people.  Please have someone around to help with emotional complications.

Dr. W
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/i9ct83/dr_wittenberg_vaginoplasty_consult_warning_long/">said</a>
that this is very normal!  Your body is healing, and fatigue/depression is very common, no matter what else is going on.  It could be because of everything you describe, or it could be mostly unrelated.  Be kind to yourself.  Are you back home now?

Thanks

I knew it was normal.  I had it a bit after ffs.  I told myself it was happening.  Didn&#39;t matter at all.  I&#39;ll be updating my post but thank you for being concerned.

Sis, It is imperative that you seek some help for these feelings.  Here&#39;s the link to the hotlines:
<a href="http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html">http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html</a>
.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re right, no pep talk will dull the pains you feel right now, but it is clear that you need support in the place where you are currently the weakest.  Do not let this new beginning as the real you become an abrupt ending.

Luckily, it didn&#39;t get to that point.  I don&#39;t think I wanted to hurt myself or anything.  But was so miserable I wish someone would have.  Just so much agony and nothing to make it stop.
</p>
<p>
Very difficult, I definitely needed someone to help me

sorry you&#39;re feeling that way...
</p>
<p>
back when i was getting debilitating daily migraines... something that lasted some 18 years of my life... there was ofc lots of times i wanted to end it...  lots of frustration about how unable i was to do anything for most or all of the day...
</p>
<p>
and i&#39;m also social... like to be around friends and stuff... but light and sound made things worse and the pains were intense.  so social stuff was very out...
</p>
<p>
i just thought... that gosh... at *some* point in the future... maybe ten years down the road?  eventually medicine would figure out how to heal me and i&#39;d be able to at least part time do things again...
</p>
<p>
hang in there... you can do it :)

<p>
Is this antidepressants? If so it might not be the best time to do that. If you feel you’re in danger perhaps you should look at upping them and trying again later.

No, Percocet and gabapentin.
</p>
<p>
I never took either before, and they were very helpful the first few weeks.  I actually wish I could take them indefinitely, which is a pretty good sign to get off that completely!!!
</p>
<p>
Percocet is done today, gaba another week but the dose is lower than pre op.

I went through a LOT of very severe depression at about 3 weeks as well!  There was almost no way though except to reach out as best I could (and sometimes I couldn’t even do that!) talk to my therapist, and ride it out.  It was hard.  Be prepared for it, know it may happen, and be determined to ride it out.  It WILL get better!

Yeah.  There&#39;s no cure.  Talking can help but then it gets exhausting but not time for bed yet.
</p>
<p>
I just want to be held.  Sorry if that&#39;s needy but a soothing hand is about all that works.  And I&#39;ll still cry like I&#39;m dying.

Stay strong sis. I too experienced SRS alone and was depressed after that because I encountered immediate complications. Its very difficult when one has to undergo something major alone. I&#39;ve realized that it is imperative that someone be with you during the whole surgical process and experience from beginning to end. It takes such a toll to our bodies physically and mentally.  I even have moments of regrets and told myself why did I put myself through this. But what&#39;s done is done and now we have to move forward and celebrate life. Wishing you speedy recovery and all the best sis. You got this! :)
