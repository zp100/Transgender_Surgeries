I did my shoulder reduction/ clavicle reduction with Dr Ann Sluzky and Dr Bagrat Baveyan in Yerevan, Armenia in November 2023. Two weeks ago, I got the nails and plates removed by the team. Dr Sluzky is an experienced FFS and all round transgender surgeon based in Yerevan and is now working with cooperation with Dr Baveyan, an experienced orthopaedic surgeon head of his team, to perform this operation. I am very happy with my results! They not only managed to reduce the bulkiness of my shoulders, most importantly they didn’t change the shape of the shoulders by giving me an overly hunched or retracted shoulder shape. My shoulders are the same just less wide. For this reason, there they reduce 2-2.5cm per side. Compared to other trans related surgeries, the pain for me was less than I thought. The first few days after reduction were slightly painful but not overly. Then it got less and less after the first week, with the occasional discomfort or feeling that the bone was repairing itself for 2/3 months after the surgery. The one thing I’d say that is challenging with the surgery is that you need a constant companion to feed you, do your daily chores and hygiene. This person must be prepared to see you at your worst. Personally I took my mother! You can feed yourself in one direction after a few days and use your phone, but you might be too exhausted to hold stuff up well. The removal was a little uncomfortable for I’d say the first week and now I feel nothing. In general, my bone healed very quickly and well. After 4 months of the initial surgery, I was back doing sports like yoga, Pilates, and some weights at the gym. The price is super reasonable also with this team compared to other surgeons and honestly I feel they genuinely care about transgender people! They are truly wonderful, and having had surgery elsewhere where I just felt like a number, these guys really help and care for you in a GENUINE way and you can always be in touch with them with any issues you have. I came to Yerevan 3 months post-op for my checkup but honestly if your doctor in your country allows it, you can just send them a scan also. Yerevan is a reasonable and safe place, and great place to recover. The Armenian people are super friendly and kind. It’s still quite conservative and a little awkward to get to from the West but not overly. I never had any issues! Just remember that there may be slight cultural differences and communication styles from what some of us are used to in the West. The nurses are so caring and lovely at the hospital. Unfortunately I won’t be posting photos here for privacy reasons, but my results were subtle yet noticeable. People asked if I’d lost weight on my shoulders/ upper body. And I have had zero functionality issues- I believe this is because Dr Baveyan uses the highest, highest quality nails/ hardware that is double-plated unlike elsewhere. And does alot of extra stuff to ensure your wellbeing and that you heal well, remember he is a trauma specialised for orthopaedic issues to has dealt with much more severe breaks than clavicles, often when multiple breaks and multiple times and not a clean fracture such as in clavicle reduction.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to contact me via DM or Dr Ann Sluzky or her assistant for information via their email/ socials etc.
</p>
<p>
Thank you Dr Sluzky and Baveyan! You helped me a lot in my transition!

How long did you need assistance? Tbh I would prefer to hire somebody for that I think, or stay linger in the hospital - would that have been possible?

Saying longer in the hospital I don’t think will be an option. It is a centre of orthopaedic operations. You could look into hiring, but the price will go up and when you go back to your country you still need assistance post-op- for two months. So I’d say, you need a trusted companion from the get go- or two- one for the operation itself and one for when you’re home.

You can use your hands slowly from the get go in a basic way- phone, feeding yourself. But to return to full range of motions a full 6 weeks to 12 weeks. Everyone is individual. Google clavicle fractures and see what it says. Many people break theirs and this surgery is essentially this but with a ‘clean break’. After 7 weeks I was able to do all my personal hygiene. The main issue is personal hygiene you need someone to help you with going to the toilet basically!! And cook for you for a while. But after a few days you can feed yourself etc and use your phone. You need to be prepared for this surgery, it wasn’t super painful for me just an inconvenience and I think most people wouldn’t be able to do it without someone close to them helping them for a few weeks- 2 months.

I&#39;m doubtful as to whether I could trust Dr. Ann Sluzky with a procedure after reading this previous post:

I really want to believe that if she&#39;s not capable enough with FFS, then perhaps the clavicle shortening would be a different matter. The surgeons in the US and their quotes are far too pricey for me to consider.

Firstly you’ve got no post history… my suspicion is that you are the person who has posted stuff before about her. Secondly, this surgery isn’t performed by Dr Ann. If you read the post, you’ll notice that the surgery is performed by an orthopaedic surgeon and goes through Ann’s team. It’s an affiliation. The orthopaedic doctor is highly experienced in all areas of broken bones.

$6,300 ! Which is super reasonable compared to anyone else I’ve found and the fact they use the best materials possible and have great aftercare advice is insane!

Yeah in the US, it’s more expensive. But that’s like every other trans-related surgery, FFS, bottom surgery, breast augmentation, bbl, tends to be cheaper outside of the US.

How much did you manage to remove? My surgeon said he removed 2 cm per side but in the pictures each chunk was about 1.6 cm
</p>
<p>
PS: just to give my input, my recovery seems to have been easier than yours, I could hold my phone the night after the surgery and used the toilet myself the day after, I only needed my bf help for drying my hair and making a pony tail. I did mine in South Korea with 15 k usd

Thank for the link, but I&#39;ve already read all of that. The person who had a bad experience with Dr Sluzky seems a little suspicious to me. I&#39;m satisfied with everything else I&#39;ve heard from her other patients and her work looks great to me.

Also if you want a laugh check her contributions to the medical literature... there&#39;s just one paper trying to sell her 3d modelling software and she didn&#39;t even bother to use a spell checker.
</p>
<p>
Oh and far less funny is that I recently was informed she&#39;s left *at least* 2 people unable to speak due to the poorly regarded FEMLAR op she also performs. Jack of all trades master of none as they say.

I provided objective evidence of everything I claimed that I reasonably could (all CT scans, my surgical report, screenshots, photography of my bare skull) and by far the most comprehensive account of any surgery with her. The only thing I didn&#39;t provide was photography of my face, which is highly subject to bias anyway - for example I could easily post a photo immediately after my forehead revision where the swelling makes me look like a 15 year old, not pushing 40. I put it all out there for people to draw their own conclusions, even the positive things about Sluzky like how she visited the hospital after I vomited from the opiate and was concerned about the effect on the rhinoplasty. I didn&#39;t have to attempt to be balanced, or honest (Sluzky wasn&#39;t when she led me to believe she would be the one performing my rhinoplasty, talking about where she would make her cuts etc). I&#39;ve since spoken privately to trans and cis women who had similar experiences to myself and if you look there are plenty of public comments from those who have interacted with Sluzky echoing her rude, shitty attitude as well as another patient who experienced a similar forehead complication and attitude:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender%5C_Surgeries/comments/1328zk2/comment/ji4qsip/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/1328zk2/comment/ji4qsip/
</a>
. Search for her full name in Russian (Анна Вадимовна Слуцкаяand) you&#39;ll also see someone reporting severe nerve damage from FFS on Russian review websites. The comments on my posts are what should be viewed with suspicion, especially considering some are from new accounts made after mods removed inappropriate comments from individuals with similar syntax and sentiments and this surgeon used social media to attack that original post. Personally that is a red flag enough that a surgeon would be so unprofessional as to encourage a dogpile to try to save her reputation ($$$) and I would avoid such a surgeon.

Anyway, whatever issues you have with her- this surgery isn’t carried about by her per ce, but by an orthopaedic team. So different topic.
