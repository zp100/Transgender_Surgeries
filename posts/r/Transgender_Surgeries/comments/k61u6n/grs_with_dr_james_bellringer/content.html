Hi all. Hope you&#39;re all well and keeping safe.  I&#39;m due to have my GRS with Dr Bellringer based at Parkside Hospital in London in early 2021. Can anyone on here talk to me about their results/ experiences post surgery.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks in advice.  Lydia x

I had a vaginoplasty with Mr Bellringer last Monday (10 days ago). Overall a very positive experience, the nursing staff were awesome. I&#39;ve been keeping diaries of my experience...

I had a bump yesterday with some very sensitive tissue at the vaginal entrance. This is from a small section of graft that may or may not yet make it. But otherwise, I&#39;m doing really well. I manage to get out and walk once or twice a day for about 1km, slowly. This gets my circulation going which is good for the healing.
</p>
<p>
My wife is looking after me, which helps, and it&#39;s really all about the dilation right now...
</p>
<p>
Get everything ready
</p>
<p>
Dilate
</p>
<p>
Douche
</p>
<p>
Shower/rise
</p>
<p>
Repeat...
</p>
<p>
In between I eat and run the rest of my life!
