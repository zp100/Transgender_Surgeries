<p>
I had Cosmetic SRS (vulvoplasty without depth) done last week by Dr. Ivan Aguilar in Tijuana, Mexico. I live in USA, specifically San Diego, thus I am extremely close to the location where I had my surgery and where I am currently recovering: San Diego and Tijuana can be thought of as one city divided in two by the international border cutting across it, and I am literally one hour away from home by car, if you don&#39;t count the border crossing wait times.
</p>
<p>
Because there is so little information about this surgeon online, I figured that I have a sort of moral duty to our community to share my experience, paying it forward for any other trans women in the future who may be interested in this option. I hope that our dear moderator can add this post to the wiki under Dr. Ivan Aguilar - right now there is an extreme scarcity of information about this surgeon in our wiki.
</p>
<p>
I need to begin with background information, background that is critical to understanding my reasons for choosing this surgeon. Ever since I reached the point in my transition where I decided that I wanted some kind of bottom surgery, I knew that I wanted some version of zero or minimal depth vulvoplasty, not the full depth. Why? I am older (42 now), I am extremely anti-andro (the very thought of being with a man is utterly repugnant and revolting to me, just like it would be to the most extreme gold star cis lesbian), my wife and I share a most satisfying and wonderful intimate relationship with very little need for genital activity, thus in my circumstances it simply makes no sense to subject my body to significant additional trauma, to take the risk of really scary bad outcomes (think rectal-vaginal fistula) and to subject myself to life-long dilation just to make it possible for my wife to stick a dildo in me once in a while. The cost-benefit analysis makes the full depth option absolutely not worth it for me, hence zero or minimal depth it is.
</p>
<p>
Another issue for me is that I wanted my labia, both majora and minora, to be as big as possible, the direct opposite of the most common &#34;porn star&#34; look. Regardless of which specific technique any given surgeon uses, the basic laws of matter remain the same: if you have X amount of starting source material (penile and scrotal skin), if you expend some of this source material on the vaginal lining, you will have that much less material remaining for the external genital structures. I did not want to waste any of my source material on the useless-to-me vagina, I wanted all of it to go to my new labia, making them as big as possible - thus another reason for zero or minimal depth.
</p>
<p>
With the question of no depth settled, why this particular surgeon? Prior to Covid, I had all of my plans set to go to Chettawut in Thailand. I had a strong aversion to American PIV technique, I felt that the technique practiced by Suporn and Chet in Thailand was the only good one, and I had internalized the view expressed by some other trans women I was following who felt that SRS done by anyone other Suporn or Chet amounts to mutilation. Suporn refuses to do zero or reduced depth on ideological grounds, hence I thought that Chet was literally my one and only option.
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery scheduled with Chet for May of 2020, then just a month before Covid hit, rescheduled to May of 2021 for financial reasons. And then bam - the world went to hell in a handbasket. I was devastated, I felt like the whole world had conspired against me, I felt like Covid was created specifically to keep me from getting my surgery.
</p>
<p>
The thought of going to an American surgeon still felt unacceptable to me, thus I went looking frantically for a Mexican surgeon, reasoning that the land border between USA and Mexico is the only international border I will ever be able to cross from now on, until the day I die. And I found Dr. Ivan Aguilar.
</p>
<p>
At first I waited patiently to see if travel to Thailand would reopen. In January of 2021 I got my renewed international travel document from USCIS (a passport replacement for stateless persons like me, a long story for another day), and in February I reached out to Ms. Som (Chettawut&#39;s office manager) to see what the situation was like with travel to Thailand. It was as bleak as I expected: medical tourists entering the country for cosmetic surgery are subjected to prison-like quarantine in the name of Covid, with this added quarantine prior to actual surgery my stay in Thailand and thus time away from home, from family and from my job would be even longer than it was in pre-Covid days (it was a month then), they would shove a swab up my nose, scarring and traumatizing me for life, and if the test comes out positive despite me being 100% healthy, they would probably subject me to forced involuntary hospital treatment for Covid - they require travelers to buy Covid insurance, so they know they would get paid for whatever horrible Nazi-like treatments they would do to me in that prison.
</p>
<p>
So I reached out to Dr. Ivan Aguilar, and thankfully he answered my prayers - his positive response probably saved my life at that point - saved my life from suicide that is, not from Covid! He told me that he performs surgeries at both Guadalajara and Tijuana locations, with Tijuana being more expensive: for the surgery I wanted (Cosmetic SRS, not sure how it would be for full depth options) he quoted me a price of $9k in Guadalajara or $11k in Tijuana. I chose Tijuana: I would much rather spend a little extra money to get to the surgery location by car, just an hour away from home, than having to take a plane to go much deeper into Mexico.
</p>
<p>
I asked the doctor for a consultation, and he offered two options: either a video call or an in-person consult at their Tijuana location. I chose the physical consult: for such permanent and life-altering surgery, there is nothing better than a physical consultation with the surgeon, with him physically examining my starting parts and then giving me a realistic assessment of what can be done with what I had. So my wife and I drove across the border to Tijuana and saw the good doctor back in February. He examined my parts (I asked upfront that I wanted my wife in the room as he was examining me, and he was totally OK with it, yay), he told me what he could do, and I liked his approach.
</p>
<p>
One major factor that helped me ease myself to the idea of entrusting my body into the hands of Dr. Ivan instead of Chet is the fact that I was going for the no-depth option. When someone is going for full vaginal depth, there are many significantly different techniques for making the vagina: old-style PI, &#34;Thai method&#34; non-PI, colon graft, PPT and other methods, and there is a lot of room for each surgeon to do things very differently. But with no-depth vulvoplasty, there seems to be only one way to do it: scrotal skin becomes labia majora, penile skin becomes labia minora, and glans penis or a portion thereof becomes the neoclitoris - how else? When I asked Dr. Ivan point-blank how his technique for Cosmetic SRS compares to or differs from Chet&#39;s, he didn&#39;t like that question, but when I asked him to describe his surgery in non-comparative terms, the way he explained it sounded exactly like Chet&#39;s approach to me.
</p>
<p>
What really helped me ease my mind and trust Dr. Ivan was how readily he agreed to my request for bigger labia and a bigger clit. The vast majority of SRS result pictures I see are &#34;porn star&#34; or Barbie vaginas, the look of a woman who had reduction labiaplasty, with both inner and outer labia trimmed down. I don&#39;t know the reason for the apparent dominance of such SRS outcomes: is it because such Barbie vaginas are the only thing that major surgeons know how to make, or is it because most trans women themselves actually desire such? But I and my wife desire the exact opposite for my parts, and we asked Dr. Ivan to make everything as big as possible: labia majora as big as possible, labia minora as big as possible, clitoris as big as possible. The good doctor readily agreed: &#34;big labia, big clit, no hole, that&#39;s what you want, right?&#34; - and we eagerly confirmed.
</p>
<p>
Fast-forwarding to the present, my surgery was scheduled for August 26, and now it is done. Right now I am only 9 days post-op, and with all of the swelling it is far too early to judge how the aesthetics came out - but I feel that my surgery went well. I don&#39;t see how Chet in Thailand would have done it any better, thus I have no regrets.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and here is another wonderful tidbit about this doctor and his team: I was able to get my surgery done without that horrible swab up my nose! I expressed it to them from the very beginning that this swab was absolutely unacceptable to me, and they agreed to do a blood test instead. When they did that blood test the morning of my surgery, there was a scare: it came out positive! I don&#39;t know what they look for in those blood tests, but I wonder if it is actually a test for Covid antibodies - if it is an antibody test, then it is no wonder that it came out positive, as I had Covid back in December-January. The doctor and his team said that since the quick test came out positive, they had to do a PCR test, and at first they said my only option was the horrible nose swab. I was deliberating with myself as to what would be worse, allowing that swab up my nose or giving up on my surgery, but then my Goddess interceded: at the last moment they agreed to do a throat swab instead. They had me open my mouth and put the swab just barely behind my tongue, and it was tolerable, a million times more tolerable than shoving a hockey stick up my nose.
</p>
<p>
After they swabbed my throat, we had to wait several hours for the test result. My wife and I went back to our hotel room, and we were sitting there on pins and needles, as my fate was in the hand of those testers. Imagine my relief when Monica (Dr. Ivan&#39;s patient coordinator in Tijuana) called me and told me it was negative! My wife and I rushed back to the hospital before they could change their mind, and a few hours later my surgery was done.
</p>
<p>
Logistics: Dr. Ivan is based out of Guadalajara, and he comes to Tijuana once a month to operate on American patients. But while the doctor comes and goes, there is a permanent office here in TJ where all logistics are coordinated. Monica and Pablo are the two coordinators; Monica has been the one handling my case. Their office actually handles many other surgeries (various cisgender plastic surgeries, breast implants, liposuction, bariatrics, dental procedures, minor stuff like Botox and fillers - the whole gamut), and gender-related surgeries with Dr. Ivan are something they only do rarely, a very small part of their business. But they handle everything very well; Dr. Ivan speaks good English, and so does Monica.
</p>
<p>
All of my preoperative lab tests (plus EKG and chest X-ray) were done at the medical office where Monica and Pablo work, and were included in the surgery package price. For the actual surgery, they recommended that I and my wife arrive in Tijuana the night before the surgery and stay in a hotel on the Mexican side of the border, so on the morning of the surgery they pick us up from the hotel. We chose to check into the hotel two nights before my surgery rather than one night before, to give ourselves more time to decompress and prepare. The hotel we chose is Hyatt Place Tijuana, and it was a very good choice, a very American hotel: inside our hotel room we did not feel like we were in Mexico.
</p>
<p>
We arrived at the mini-hospital (Clinica San Juan) on Thursday the 26th, my surgery was done very shortly afterward, within a couple of hours after my initial admission, and I stayed at that mini-hospital for two nights afterward. Exactly per the logistical plan which they spelled out for me at the time of booking, on Saturday the 28th I was transferred from Clinica San Juan mini-hospital to a recovery place called Baja Premium Care; this place is set up mostly like an extended stay hotel, but they have nurses who check on patients, give medications and provide basic care. Initially out of surgery, I had a Foley catheter in me and a ton of packing around my crotch; these things were still in me as they transferred me from the mini-hospital to the Baja Premium place, and they only came out yesterday (Friday), 8 days after the surgery.
</p>
<p>
The packing around my crotch was held in place with compression bandages, and those tapes were extremely unkind on my body: they literally melted my skin where they were attached to me, extremely painful. Prior to removal of the packing, these tapes were my primary source of pain, along with the discomfort of the packing itself plus having to drag the catheter bag everywhere I went. Now that the packing is out and the awful tapes are off, I have pain in all of the numerous spots where my skin got ripped or melted off (I was told to expect a week of healing), plus stinging and burning pain that comes and goes in the area around the actual stitches.
</p>
<p>
I am now at the limit of how much I can write in one sitting, considering the pain I am in. I will write more later (I really do wish to document my entire experience as a way of paying it forward to the community), but until then, feel free to ask me anything, and I will see if I can answer.

Great to hear such a good review for srs from dr. Aguilar. I&#39;ve talked to people that have gotten orchi done by him and had great things to say. Especially about how easy it was to not jump through all of the gatekeepers hoops.

In my case, because I originally planned to go to Chet in Thailand, I had all of my WPATH letters ready (he is one of the stricter surgeons about specific letter requirements and verification), and all of these letters were addressed to Chet. When I first reached out to Dr. Ivan, I included scanned copies of all of my letters as email attachments - but he did not say even one word about these letters in his response. They never asked me for the letters at the time of booking the surgery date or at the time of my pre-op labs; for the actual surgery I brought the original hand-signed paper letters (as Chet requires) into Mexico with me &#34;just in case&#34;, and on the morning of the surgery when Monica picked me and my wife up at the hotel, I handed her the envelope with this letters, on my own without her asking. She said something like &#34;thank you, we need them for our records&#34;, but it didn&#39;t seem like she or anyone else actually looked at them.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what would have happened if I didn&#39;t have these letters - but since I already had them as a result of previously preparing for surgery with Chet in Thailand, it was one less issue for me to worry about.

One other very important detail I forgot to mention: I never had to do any genital electrolysis for my Cosmetic SRS! Back when I was planning to go to Chet in Thailand, one of the big attractions was the fact that Chet did not require any genital electrolysis, not even for full depth - instead he left it up to each patient&#39;s individual discretion if she would rather do electrolysis beforehand or risk having hair in the vagina. Dr. Ivan is the same way - no requirement of genital electrolysis, instead it is entirely up to the patient.
</p>
<p>
Why was I so against doing genital electrolysis before surgery? Answer: pain! I am getting electrolysis done on my face (been doing it for years, still got some left to go), so I know exactly how painful it is. On the more sensitive areas of my face, the only way I can get effective treatment is by doing lidocaine injections, and I can only reason that it would be just as sensitive or worse in the genital area. But doing lidocaine injections in the genital area would be quite dangerous from what I&#39;ve read, and I expect that the injections themselves would also be extremely painful down there. Thus no matter what, genital electrolysis would be pure torture.
</p>
<p>
Of course I realize the trade-off I have made: because I skipped on genital electrolysis, I will very likely have a hairy vulva, including hair growth in areas past the outer labia where cis women never grow hair. But I have no interest in being a porn star or an exhibitionist, my private parts are not for public display, they are just for me and my wife only. And we are totally OK with more-than-cis hair, especially given the pain and cost of the alternative. The important part is that Dr. Ivan allowed me to make this choice for myself, rather impose it upon me.
</p>
<p>
From what I gathered, this approach of letting the patient decide is NOT common with American surgeons, in contrast with Mexico and Thailand. When Covid hit and my original plan of going to Thailand went up in smoke, and before I found Dr. Ivan in Mexico, I was looking at some American surgeons. Many of them don&#39;t even say on their websites what they offer vs. what they don&#39;t, and I didn&#39;t want to waste my time on those who won&#39;t do zero or minimal depth, but I did look at Dr. Heidi Wittenberg - her website explicitly listed zero or shallow depth (don&#39;t remember which) as an option. But guess what - it also explicitly listed genital electrolysis as a specific requirement even for this no-depth option!
</p>
<p>
My electrologist who works on my face has seen many many trans girls go through SRS, and me not having to do any genital electrolysis was a real surprise for her. She was asking me how much electrolysis I was going to need downstairs, and she was very surprised when I said that none was required - and this is coming from a seasoned pro who has seen it all.

Congrats on your surgery! I had metoidioplasty with him 2 weeks ago and i&#39;m really happy with my result, i&#39;m glad you feel the same, he is really nice and I hope everything goes well for you! I hope you keep sharing your experience, i&#39;m posting my results online too since i&#39;m not that fluid in english but maybe i&#39;ll consider sharing my whole story in english now that I read yours (I&#39;ve been sharing mine in facebook but in spanish in trans groups)

Dear sister, I would definitely like to connect with you too! However, I don&#39;t do FB (I don&#39;t have an FB account, never had one, and I refuse to create one), so I won&#39;t be able to &#34;find&#34; you on FB. Would you be willing to connect with me via old-fashioned email? My email address is
<a href="mailto:falcon@freecalypso.org" rel="nofollow">falcon@freecalypso.org
</a>
. And please feel free to peruse my website
<a href="http://www.freecalypso.org" rel="nofollow">www.freecalypso.org
</a>
too, to see what my life is about beyond the unfortunate F64.0 medical condition I have to deal with.

You have told your background story pretty thoroughly!
</p>
<p>
I found your aversion to the antigen test kit interesting - a little tickle up the nose seems like no big deal compared to major surgery under general anesthetic. But that&#39;s just my opinion.
</p>
<p>
I understand your reasons for wanting cosmetic srs rather than full-depth. Yes, a vagina would seem of little use if committed to and married to a woman.
</p>
<p>
I am used to the back door entry and was afraid of dilation and the difficulties and pain that come with it. Sex wasn&#39;t really on my mind but I would say there are always other things to do  with a partner, like fellatio or whatever the opposite is called (ah, cunnalingus)
</p>
<p>
Good luck with your recovery.

I&#39;ve been a little out of touch with them myself, but I do wish to reestablish contact with those nice people - they are wonderful indeed, and I do desire to have friends on the south side of the border, particularly in Tijuana, for reason of GSM/2G technology. Here in USA the evil corporate overlords of T-Mobile are threatening to shut down their 2G service in April of 2024 - and as it stands today, it&#39;s already limited only to &#34;grandfathered&#34; customers like me and not accessible to new subscribers. OTOH, when I had my SRS in 2021-August, I asked Andy (the driver and the third TJ care team member beyond Monica and Pablo) to get me a prepaid Mexican Telcel SIM card, he readily brought me one, and it worked right away in my vintage 2G-only phone! By that point in time (2021) T-Mobile SIMs already had 2G compatibility artificially removed - they did it back in 2019 actually. Thus I would like to make occasional visits to Tijuana to play with the GSM/2G network of their cell carrier Telcel - but I would need some &#34;cultural guide&#34; in Mexico, I don&#39;t feel comfortable just going on my own.
