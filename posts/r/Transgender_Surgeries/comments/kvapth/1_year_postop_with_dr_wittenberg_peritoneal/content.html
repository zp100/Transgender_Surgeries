Some answers to questions that I could imagine asking:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Surgery went well, it was hellish for about 4-5 months before life kind of went back to normal. I found what it feels like to be addicted to opiods as well as a 10 on my pain scale, nearly passing out from pain at one point (and scarring poor Dr. Wittenberg with my scream.)
<br>
</li>
<li>
Dr. Wittenberg is intensely wonderful. She&#39;s the best surgeon I&#39;ve worked with and all of my experiences with her has been top notch.
</li>
<li>
The results look very natural. I&#39;m not going to provide pictures, but I&#39;m happy with my results. It feels very normal to me at this point and having been married with plenty of experience with natal vaginas, it&#39;s consistent with my experiences there.
</li>
<li>
Dilating is fine. It&#39;s annoying and painful, but it&#39;s nothing huge. I managed to rig a harness system up so that I could do it hands free and that works out for me.
</li>
<li>
I lost depth rather quickly and no matter how hard or often I dilate I never got it back. I&#39;m a little short, but apparently many cis women are about the same length so I don&#39;t really mind. For reference I make it to the second dot on the dilator.
</li>
<li>
The big orange dilator never stops hurting but I only really need to use blue for dilation to be useful.
</li>
<li>
I went a month without dilating at month 10 due to some severe mental issues. I did not lose depth or elasticity.
</li>
<li>
I don&#39;t really dilate anymore, just have sexual activity. I&#39;ve had no issues from that.
</li>
<li>
Orgasms are different in that it&#39;s like warm waves all up and down my body with very little sensation focused on the parts themselves. It took me 11 months to have an orgasm - started trying at month four and seemingly getting close every single time. I personally like feeling more now than I did before, especially having something inside while stimulating the clitoris. Great feeling.
</li>
<li>
Masturbation is a lot more work now. Stars kind of have to align for everything to work. It&#39;s a much better experience because of lack of dysphoria.
</li>
<li>
Pull-through is great, the tissue seems to be stretchy and I get the impression dilation isn&#39;t really needed as much. I didn&#39;t lose depth when I missed out, everything kind of just settled in to where it is and it doesn&#39;t seem to matter much if I skip a week or so. After the tissue settled to its max depth, frequency really doesn&#39;t seem to matter as much.
</li>
<li>
Lubrication seems really natural. I get super wet during sexual things and have a bit of passive lubrication that never really gets in the way.
</li>
<li>
I stopped worrying about looking &#34;natural&#34; or many of the things I worried about before. It&#39;s just my vagina now.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
This overall was a cure to my dysphoria and I have never regretted it, even when it was hard. When I got close to fainting from the pain I still had a huge smile on my face because the nightmare was finally over. While the active relief still isn&#39;t there, what remains is the lack of pain from my previous configuration. There&#39;s some downsides - these parts are a lot higher maintenance than what I had before, and sexual things are a lot more complicated/harder - but ultimately as a cure for dysphoria this worked out for me.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, AMA.

Congrats! Sorry that the first few months were so rough, but I&#39;m glad everything worked out well for you in the end!
</p>
<p>
I guess my question would be about that hands free harness! I had a similar idea for myself because I&#39;m running out of things to watch while I dilate at this point, and it would probably make the time go by faster if I could play my Switch instead. I&#39;m curious what &#34;design&#34; you wound up going with.

I ended up using a harness from a strap on since it had cloth behind it:
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ER28EY/">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ER28EY/
</a>
(NSFW LINK)
</p>
<p>
I basically flipped it around and took off the additional straps. I can pull it in until it&#39;s comfortable and then spread my legs further to apply more pressure :)

Very clever, thanks for the link!

I actually had a similar idea initially, but I&#39;m a total klutz so I had nightmares about accidentally sitting up or moving too fast and... well, you get the idea 😬

Yeah. Though like the vagina is super strong and can take a lot of punishment. It can hurt but you&#39;re not going to hurt anything after a few months.

I&#39;m really glad you&#39;ve had such a positive experience, not losing depth and experiencing natural lubrication sounds great

Can I ask how much it cost?

I mean I did lose depth, but I think as I&#39;ve read with other PPT people, there&#39;s a bit of shrinkage and then it just settles in.
</p>
<p>
The medical procedure cost around $4500 (my out of pocket maximum) and then living in San Francisco for that long of a period cost around $6000. I couch surfed for a year to save up.

Ohhhh okay thank you
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m guessing that for someone without insurance it would be significantly more then? (I don&#39;t live in the US)
</p>
<p>
That sounds like a lot to deal with but I&#39;m so glad it has ended up being worth it for you

If I didn&#39;t have insurance it would have been over $200k - just entirely unobtainable.

I’ve heard that surgeons and hospitals in the states charge way more than needed for insurance companies since, you know, they can. I’ve heard prices are much more reasonable for cash-in-hand or direct transfer patients.

At least that’s what I keep telling myself

Hi, I have a couple of questions: What made you choose Dr. Wittenberg over other doctors? Do you recommend Dr. Wittenberg? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Would you like to have revision surgery? And if so what would you like to improve with the procedure? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in San Francisco? How was Dr. Wittenberg aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

What made you choose Dr. Wittenberg over other doctors?
<br>
Dr. Wittenberg has a history of vaginal reconstruction and the davydov procedure which is unique among surgeons as most are trained in plastic surgery. That, and looking at her results, is great.
</p>
<p>
Do you recommend Dr. Wittenberg?
<br>
100%
</p>
<p>
And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity?
<br>
Great, honestly. I asked for going for outer labia that kind of just encompass everything and that&#39;s exactly what I got. My girlfriend also had surgery with Wittenberg and her vagina looks natal as well.
</p>
<p>
Would you like to have revision surgery?
<br>
Naw, I&#39;m happy with my results.
</p>
<p>
How is your vaginal depth?
<br>
Fine? It&#39;s average for the depth of natal vagina.
</p>
<p>
How was the stay in San Francisco?
<br>
San Francisco is a pretty horrible city honestly. I stayed twice as my girlfriend also had surgery and it&#39;s just kind of a garbage place to be in.
</p>
<p>
How was Dr. Wittenberg aftercare?
<br>
Perfect. I&#39;ve never felt cared about by a surgeon as much as Wittenberg does.

Hi! Did you finish hair removal for the surgery? I&#39;m scheduled with her for a few months from now and kinda of gave up and am wondering if you&#39;ve had any issues with hair being places it shouldn&#39;t be

No, my hair is actually extremely resistant to hair removal on account of having a bunch of red in it. No idea why, but there was a lot of extremely painful hours with various technicians with no results.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have any hair where I wouldn&#39;t expect it. If you don&#39;t get hair removal I&#39;d definitely recommend going with PPT as you run the risk of getting hair on the inside.

Hey, I had my surgery with Chett a few years ago (I actually uploaded my timeline pics a couple of days ago) and I got only around 3-3.5” depth. I’m thinking of getting a revision, and Wittenberg is my number 1 choice so far, assuming it isn’t financially prohibitive.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask what depth you got, in an actual measurement if you’re aware? Metric or Imperial is fine, I can convert. Vag depth seems to usually be listed in inches, that’s all.
</p>
<p>
Can I also ask, what’s it feel like inside? I’m not too fussed with outside (already got those bits and a little bit of inside, mines is just skin graft for the most part though so not much sensation at all inside). Does it feel nice, or weird? Do you feel like you’re feeling the tactile sensation, or just feeling your insides being pushed out the way but not the actual tactility? I don’t know if I’m making sense.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for posting your recap by the way, it’s super helpful since Wittenberg doesn’t seem to have too many results up on here.

I have around 11-13cm / 4.3-5.1in depth. If I&#39;m turned on it gets to be a bit more but I haven&#39;t measured that. With pull-through, depth seems to be pretty static. Like you get depth until your innards don&#39;t let you have depth anymore. I&#39;ve never felt like the tissue is not stretchy enough, I&#39;ve always felt like the hard stop near the end is more of a &#34;can&#39;t keep going or lots of pain will occur&#34; kind of thing.
</p>
<p>
Inside feels nice. Not while dilating but everything else, it feels great. I can&#39;t say I feel a sensation directly on the skin but the pressure is great, the gspots are great. I&#39;m not sure what you mean by tactile but I can feel the part of my vagina something&#39;s touching if it&#39;s not being encompassed by the whole thing. For the record, just feeling gspots and pressure is consistent with natal vagina as well - the vaginal wall doesn&#39;t really have much sensation at all.
</p>
<p>
To the touch the vagina feels what natal vagina feel like. Having had experience with both I honestly can&#39;t tell the difference on the inside.

Thank you, that’s very helpful to hear, and very detailed. I appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
If I may ask, do you do penetrative sex and if so, how do you get on with that depth? Like I said, I’ve got 3-3.5” and I find that my long fingers can touch the bottom and it’s uncomfortable, so I imagine penetration would be worse. Mines was non-PI (Chett) so it doesn’t really stretch or have any elasticity per say.

I&#39;ve tried once but the person I tried with had performative issues so I wasn&#39;t entirely sure. When it did work it worked fine. The pressure was nice.

She keeps everyone on the same schedule. She doesn&#39;t have a ton of PPT patients so I&#39;ve been letting her know my experiences regarding the less need for it, tissue-wise.

Thanks for your post! I did PPT with another surgeon and have had pretty similar experiences.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I lost depth rather quickly and no matter how hard or often I dilate I never got it back. I&#39;m a little short, but apparently many cis women are about the same length so I don&#39;t really mind. For reference I make it to the second dot on the dilator.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I had this same thing happen. I dilated to 5 at first, but within the first week or so I was stuck down to 3. I can get to around 4 now if I really try, but that&#39;s pushing it. I wonder if this is just a thing that happens with PPT?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It took me 11 months to have an orgasm - started trying at month four and seemingly getting close every single time.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m at month 6.5 and have been trying so hard. I can get so close, but then just lose it right at the end! I&#39;m hoping I can get to where you&#39;re at!

I think the tissue shrinks down a bit and then just sits where it&#39;s going to be, and dilation doesn&#39;t really do anything for the tissue, just muscle training.
</p>
<p>
Like a natal vagina, you can&#39;t really get much in without working it a little bit but once it&#39;s worked or I&#39;m turned on or whatever the tissue and muscles give way and stretch.
</p>
<p>
The depth thing used to get to me but I think I&#39;m kinda just over it at this point. My vagina is my vagina and it&#39;s fine. I can still fit things in there and get to my happy place.
</p>
<p>
Also keep trying! It can take a while. Dr. Wittenberg hasn&#39;t had anyone who can&#39;t orgasm by a year point from the last time I talked to her and I was apparently a late bloomer in that regard.

Could I ask about the lubrication? I&#39;m currently 20ish days away from GRS and looking to get the same surgery but in the UK. The thing that gets cited as a downside is the constant level of lubrication, how has that been for you?

It&#39;s been fine. There&#39;s not really much at all in the day-to-day and during sexual activity there&#39;s a ton.

Sorry to comment on such an old post lol. I have my consultation with Wittenberg tomorrow so I’ve been going through all the resources on here. Watching her videos on her website, she says that peritoneal lubrication stays constant and seems pretty confident that sexual arousal doesn’t influence wetness. Have you talked to her about your experience with lubrication, and if so what did she say? Thank you!

She told me directly that lubrication before and after doesn&#39;t change, and that pullthrough provides consistent lubrication. I was getting pretty wet before surgery and after surgery I also get pretty wet.
</p>
<p>
In my experience pullthrough doesn&#39;t provide enough lubrication for insertion and I still have to be turned on.

Hi!
</p>
<p>
Congrats on your successful surgery. I have a question. Is the &#34;natural lubrication&#34; enough for penetrative sex, or having toys down there without using lubricant? I really wonder about it since I&#39;m considering having it done at Thailand, but it&#39;s too expensive (around 582000 baht). Does it have any odor? How was the recovery?

My natural lubrication is enough for having toys and penetrative sex, yeah. I do think this is partially due to having pull-through and I&#39;m not sure if they offer that in Thailand but yeah.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t have any significant odor - I mean it smells like a vagina does, but it&#39;s not bad or anything.
</p>
<p>
Recovery was intense and difficult. It gets better around the two month mark and I felt like life was back to normal around 4 months.

Were there any complications? Would 3 months be enough to try penetrative sex with someone?

Not really any complications.

Hi there, Ik this post is pretty old, but I&#39;m currently looking into GRS and PPT. So it&#39;s been 3 years, have you experienced any complications since? And is the lubrication non-stop and annoying ever?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing your experiences :)

Some complications yes! -the top of my vagina kind of just doesn&#39;t exist- the labia reaches down and connects where my urethra is to what would be the middle of my vagina. penetrative sex has been made very difficult by this.  -i lost most of my depth despite dilating more than what was asked for. this happened to two other folks I know who had ppt as well.
</p>
<p>
i am having a consultation soon with another surgeon to try and fix these two things
</p>
<p>
lubrication is very much on demand. i never feel too lubricated - I never really feel dry inside but it&#39;s all contained and there&#39;s never like leaking and it&#39;s pretty minimal
</p>
<p>
i would do it all again, even with the complications but my sexual function really isn&#39;t there right now
