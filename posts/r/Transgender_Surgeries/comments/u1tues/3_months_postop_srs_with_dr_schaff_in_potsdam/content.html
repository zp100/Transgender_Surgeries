<p>
Here are my results from my first stage SRS with Dr Schaff in Potsdam, Germany.
</p>
<p>
My surgery was in early January so I am now 3 months post-OP. I would say most of my healing was done by the 2nd month and I am now back to &#34;normal&#34; in terms of energy levels and activities. I went for my first post-OP run this morning, which was the last thing on that list for me.
</p>
<p>
I dilate once per day at this point and I have worked my way up to the largest dilator in the last few weeks (Diameter 41mm). In terms of hygiene: I don&#39;t douche at all and haven&#39;t for quite some time. Every morning after dilation I rinse my vulva with water to remove any lube and then apply an oil to keep the skin soft and healthy. I&#39;ve found that I can&#39;t go with cheap lubes, they make me feel very dirty after a few days, so I use Sliquid which is pH-Balanced and has a body friendly osmolality.
</p>
<p>
In the last month I&#39;ve had regular vaginal sex with my (cis male) partner and I don&#39;t need lube for that, my depth is approximately 15cm. Since 5 weeks post-OP I&#39;ve been able to masturbate and have orgasms, tho I haven&#39;t been able to have one during sex yet, but that&#39;s mostly a mental barrier I need to get over.
</p>
<p>
Dr Schaff usually performs a revision surgery a few months after the first procedure to address any aesthetic and functional concerns. For now I want the dog-ears at the top if my labia majora removed, the bottom of my introitus opened up further and excess erectile tissue taken care of. That tissue doesn&#39;t often bother me functionally, but it is pretty visible and I don&#39;t really like the look of it.
</p>
<p>
All in all I am very happy with my outcome and it feels great to have returned to my normal life, just with a slightly different body.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask any questions in the comments or to send me a DM!

Your vulva looks incredibly beautiful and indistinguishable from a cis one too!
</p>
<p>
Did I read right that you don&#39;t need lube for penetrative sex? And if yes where does the lubrication come from because I lubricate a lot from my urethra when I&#39;m aroused so I hope that I won&#39;t need lube too.
</p>

(Probably going with Morath in a while)

Thank you so much! :)
</p>
<p>
The inside of my vagina is always moist, so when him and I have sex a little bit of spit is enough to insert the penis comfortably and after that I also lubricate quite a lot from my urethra which keeps things slippery.
</p>
<p>
Awesome that you&#39;re going with Morath! From what I&#39;ve heard her work is very similar :)

Well, obviously, if I say my depth is 15cm that means that&#39;s all that goes in. So 7 inches don&#39;t fit inside completely but that&#39;s what he has and it works well for us.
</p>
<p>
22cm depth is highly unlikely. That doesn&#39;t mean you couldn&#39;t &#39;make it work&#39; with someone that size, tho.

thats why i wanna go for Sigmoid SRS. it allows u to accomodate any Size u desire.
</p>
<p>
btw i guess sex is no more painful after managing to dilate with the big dilator. right?

Thank you!
</p>
<p>
A girl who was also there to get her surgery in January had a similar issue. In her case Dr Schaff decided to take a skin transplant from another place on the body to add depth. So that might be an option, but of course that comes with it&#39;s own risks of scarring etc

Are you aware of the peritoneal pull through method? Personally it’s my preferred and the one I’ll be getting when I finally get GCS.

I don’t, the last I heard (a few years ago mind you, I haven’t stayed on top of all the latest info) was that it was mostly done by Dr. Ting and Dr. Bluebond-Langner in New York City in the US. The wiki should hopefully have some more info though.

Yes agreed. Hopefully not to take my comment out of context though. There is a fear that most trans people have with SRS of it not looking real because a lot of doctors don’t have the skill that others do. And that’s valid.

Dr Schaff uses what he calls the &#34;combined method&#34;, which I believe is similar to some of the Thai techniques. The labia are penile skin, while the canal is mostly scrotal and also he uses the urethra to add a mucosal lining to the vagina. He also keeps the inside of the foreskin attached when he creates the clitoris, which creates more of a hood there.

Wow, this looks stunning to me, wouldn&#39;t change a thing. Also great, great depth, and it seems like you had a good recovery with no scarring, lucky you.

Hi,
</p>
<p>
thank you for sharing your experience here. Wow! The work looks really amazing. I&#39;m with Dr. Schaff in August this year and really looking forward to this date.

Did you have to speak German to be his patient? I know many Germans speak English too but a lot don’t so that’s why I’m asking.

I&#39;m a native german, so I can&#39;t give a first-hand account of this. But I know of multiple women who had surgery with him who didn&#39;t speak fluent german. As far as I know Dr Schaff himself speaks English, but you might have trouble with the hospital staff

That is an amazing result. How did the insurance cover this? Fully? I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s in a private clinic now, making it more difficult to get it financed? I live in The Netherlands and I am looking into getting SRS done by him, so I am looking to get all the info I can get :) All the love

Hey Pia! I got it fully covered by my public insurance, basically I got lucky. Usually it would never be covered, or only partially
