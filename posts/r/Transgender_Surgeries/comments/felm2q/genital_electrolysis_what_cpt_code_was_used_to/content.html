(Edit) For those who have successfully navigated this service with your insurance company, what CPT Code was used to identify the service/procedure and how was it described, please?
</p>
<p>
My insurance policy (BCBS) specifically covers genital electrolysis. However, the standard CPT 17380 for hair removal electrolysis is nationally listed (at least for BCBS) as a non-covered cosmetic service/procedure.

17380 . I had to get prior authorization, still got denied every time I submitted the claim, then had to have somebody that represents my company reach out to them every time it was denied to get it approved.
</p>
<p>
Per their policy: &#34;The use of hair removal procedures to treat tissue donor sites for a planned phalloplasty or vaginoplasty procedure is considered¬†medically necessary¬†when the medical necessity criteria for phalloplasty or vaginoplasty procedures above has been met.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I had to point that out to them to get the prior authorization process started.

Edit: Thank you‚ù£Ô∏è This is great. I read through the policy and found descriptive language I wish was in mine. Sounds like yours is very good coverage.

Update: 03/11/20
</p>
<p>
Turns out the CPT 17380 is in fact a valid code for electrolysis, specific for genital surgery. I was called by my insurance this afternoon and informed the original agent contacted about the prior authorization for the service, did not look far enough into the coverage as it pertains to GRS. Apparently this person only looked as far as not covered for cosmetics and went no further.
</p>
<p>
Lesson learned . . . If turned down/denied using the CPT 17380, make sure they look beyond cosmetic and check the coverage as a prerequisite for GRS.
</p>
<p>
Edit 3(14/20): What turned out to be helpful when making the calls was to point the call center person to the exact pages and paragraphs in the policy brochure where the information for genital electrolysis is listed (my 2020 policy is 173 pages). It saved them time not having to search and allowed them to quickly cross-reference to support me. It had the added advantage of letting them know they were working with someone who had done my homework.

Thanks, this will be helpful, as Im trying to get Anthem BC to cover my laser(and likely electo) hair removal on parts of my genitals covered, as its a requirement for my vaginoplasty. Last yr I had my Co Benefits mgr go to bat for me to get parts of my Orchi covered.

Anthem BC is who I have coverage with. I missed a call Friday (yesterday) from them. I had a voicemail telling me I was assigned a nurse case manager and to contact her. By the time I got the msg, the call center was closed. More to follow . . .
