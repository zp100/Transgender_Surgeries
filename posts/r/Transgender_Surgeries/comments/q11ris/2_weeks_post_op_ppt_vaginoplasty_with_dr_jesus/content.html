Here&#39;s a before and after of my vaginoplasty with dr. Jesus Lago in Madrid.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t have much skin for a PI, but fortunately he managed to get me about 14cm of depth using a scrotal skin graft and a peritoneal graft. I&#39;m really very pleased with that.  My partner was allowed to stay with me in the hospital where we stayed for three days. He took the packing out on the second day and took out the catheter a week later in a followup appointment. We&#39;ve been staying in an airbnb in the city and are planning to stay here until three weeks after the surgery date.
</p>
<p>
I had a bit of tearing at the bottom of the vagina which resulted in a lot of burning pain during dilation last week. We&#39;ve been using numbing cream to make it more bearable. The worst of it lasted around two days and has now been steadily improving in the second week.
</p>
<p>
We have Lago&#39;s private phone number and he&#39;s quickly helped us with all questions we&#39;ve had about post-operative care so far. The experience with the rest of his team has also been lovely.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me anything!
</p>
<p>
Edit: I forgot to mention that as part of the surgery, the urethral lining has been used to create a mucous membrane along the vaginal canal.

First of all, congratulations on the surgery!
</p>
<p>
I’m curious. For how long did he say that you’d have to use the dilator for?
</p>
<p>
Is there a specific reason that you chose the vaginoplasty method?

Thank you! I remember him telling me it depends on each case, but it could be up to a year. I&#39;m not sure what it will be in my case yet, but we&#39;ll go over in my next appointment this week.

He did say that, yes, but he was confident the scrotal skin graft should compensate for it. It seems he was right.

Great results 💙congrats sis💓. So does the surgery was open or laparoscopic? And would be very grateful if you share the total cost of it if not covered by insurance?
</p>

Regards 💙 Happy healing 💓 💓

Thank you very much! ❤ The surgery took 8 hours, the first 4 of which they went in laparoscopically through the stomach for the peritoneal pull through method. The last 4 hours he went in through the front to put everything together.
</p>
<p>
As for money, he told me he only works privately and my insurance didn&#39;t cover anything. The costs with the scrotal skin graft and ppt were 13950 euros. He also offered me the option with the skin graft but without ppt for 10950 euros, but I opted out of that.

I had 5 sessions of diode laser leading up to the surgery, which is why my pubic hair regrowth is so patchy. I asked him during the consult if it was necessary and he told me it wasn&#39;t. I figured I&#39;d continue with the laser sessions I was already getting anyway since I want to have less hair in the area, but it was not a requirement for the surgery.

I did. It was sensitive and a bit painful on certain parts, but it was pretty manageable and usually over quickly. I&#39;d say I found laser on my upper lip on my face more painful than this.

thanks for the reply. I was actually gonna go later this week (full body laser package) But the woman told me they do full body, yes but concering the penis: They only laser pubic hair above the penis, not the balls nor shaft. For the reason that bleeding occurs often she assures me. I don&#39;t know what to do, I want to laser it all but Im kinda afraid I am gonna have issues, like bleeding arise afterwards :/

I find that quite surprising to hear. I have never heard of bleeding caused by diode laser. In my case, the same laser that was used on the rest of my body was also used on the scrotal and penile skin and it was not a problem at all. Could you possibly get a second opinion from another laser tech? The skin is a bit more sensitive, but that is all.

How was your experience since you first contacted them and finally had the surgery? Had to travel a lot to Madrid?

Setting up the consult was fairly simple. I contacted them through whatsapp through the number listed on his website and someone on his team set up a date two weeks later for a video call with him. The consult went pretty much perfectly for me and I was sent a quote for the surgery soon after. After opting to go with him, the wait wasn&#39;t too long. He said his waiting list is about 1.5 months, but I scheduled the surgery for about 4 months later. The person on his team in charge of giving me all the information regarding what I needed to get ready was a bit sloppy and it took some pushing to get him to send me what I needed. He worried me a little, so to ease my mind I occasionally contacted Jesus himself. He always eased my mind immediately. Everything else went pretty smoothly. I live in Spain (though, I don&#39;t speak Spanish), so getting to Madrid was a very short flight for me.

I&#39;m sorry.. if anything, I want to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by my result. I wanted to show that even if what you start out with seems too small, there are still methods that can get you where you want to go.  I&#39;m really rooting for you and hope you can get what you need!

No, I didn&#39;t. It was performed during the surgery.

I can&#39;t say for sure if that&#39;s what he did. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me, considering I haven&#39;t noticed any hair growing inside even though hair has been growing on the outside. Admittedly, reading this did now make me a bit nervous about that!
</p>
<p>
The hair that was growing on the scrotal skin used for the graft did only have a very sparse hair growth thanks to the diode laser sessions I did prior, so that could also be working in my favor.

I thought so too! This was the entire cost for everything, including revisions, and checkups for the next two years. He told me he only works privately, so unfortunately none of it was covered by insurance.

Can I ask how big the scars are from the laparoscopy part of the surgery? I&#39;m considering going to the same surgeon for a revision through PPT.

Also congrats! The result looks really good.

Yes, of course! In my case, three incisions were made (but one of the nurses insinuated that it was more sometimes). One above my belly button and one on each side of my belly. After a month or so, the one above my belly button had mostly healed and is no longer visible now. The one on my left side is healing a bit quicker than the one on the right, but the way its looking they won&#39;t be visible for much longer. I&#39;d be happy to send you some pictures if you message me!
</p>

Also, thank you very much! ❤

Hi! No problem with hair whatsoever. It grows on the labia as it should, but nothing in the canal or in the interlabial mucosa. I&#39;ve been shaving it with no issues as well as I prefer it smooth. 🙂 It seems he did an excellent job with that.

Looking great! Were the hospital staff kind? How readily did they give you pain relief when you needed it?
</p>

Curious how things are going now it&#39;s been a little longer. Hope you&#39;re well!

The hospital staff was a bit of a mixed bag, but generally I can&#39;t complain. I also had my partner with me in the room, so I had someone to rely on to get me things when I needed them. I had morphine when I was there and they gave me additional pain meds and sleeping meds whenever I&#39;d ask for them.
</p>
<p>
The progress has been really good! I started dilating with the biggest dilator I want to fit, which I&#39;m feeling fairly optimistic about. I&#39;m also quite happy with how it looks, but I will need to get a touch up surgery. This is all included in the original price I paid, so that&#39;s really no big deal for me.
</p>
<p>
As for sex, I can get wet enough so that I don&#39;t need extra lubrication for being fingered. I haven&#39;t done much more yet. I was also able to come a little while before three months after the surgery. The sensitivity is quite high, so it&#39;s been a bit of an experiment. Hopefully as the nerves set a bit more it&#39;ll get a little easier. 😊

I am strongly considering going with him myself. Thank you for such a through response ^_^ Would you be comfortable posting healed photos? I&#39;ve seen a small number of photos online but none of them really show the clitoris or inner labia very well.

Yeah, I will post more pictures eventually. I need to get a touch-up surgery done (which is all included in the original price, btw!) on the clitoris since one of the stitches didn&#39;t hold during the healing process. It looks a bit odd now, in my opinion, and I&#39;d prefer not to post pictures until then.

Hi, after your surgery was it difficult to find your clitoris? It’ll be 2 months since my surgery on Sunday and I don’t have any sensation and I still can’t see my clitoris. Moreover, the anatomy isn’t correct, my “clitoris” (wherever it is) sits way too high.

Hi, I’m considering Dr. Lago and I had a question. When looking at his results on his website and twitter there are a lot of vaginas where there’s this inflamed redness inside. When I asked the clinic they told me it is mucosa that is left inside the vagina but can be removed. Is this something that you experienced or experience?
