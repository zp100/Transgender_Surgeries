it&#39;s getting prettier...
</p>
<p>
I think Dr Theerapong&#39;s art is also as good as Dr Bank.
</p>
<p>
I am very frustrated with long queue of Dr Bank and need to turn my head to Dr Theerapong.

<p>
cheers.

Pretty good results! I am sure you‚Äôre living the dream of feeling complete now. Everything fine when peeing as well? It is one of main concerns, it would be very important to me not having issues and being able to do it sitting like any other woman.

Peeing is all fine and I would like to say it&#39;s even better than before in some terms If you wanna compare how it&#39;s different then before peeing before is like you could feel the urine sensation in your long pp urethra when it&#39;s coming, with vagina it&#39;s different your urethra isn&#39;t long enough and is much near to your bladder so you only feel it being released like water fall.

They both are same in term of srs the main difference come with the healing process laparoscopic heals faster then open, and don&#39;t forget the scar with laparoscopic who only get 3 micro scars and will easily fade with time but in open you&#39;ve to deal with 3 to 5 inches of lined scar on tummy which often fade less and slow.

Lucky - I never even got a pre surgery consultation just an exam with 4 others hanging around - my aesthetics are just a joke from him quite Frankly - I dealt with this Thai speaking idiot Ex Patriot from the US married to a Thai Born man so I‚Äôll never know what the bitch said to him securing her money paid for a sh#t service I got - I need a complete redo of all aesthetics and because of the crap going on and being honest Theerapong has Blacklisted Ghosted me because he‚Äôs insulted - my canal is good the rest was Sh#t work done - Fk it I‚Äôll say my piece about all this crap that went on with me last fall 2022 !

Oh gWD, I think you&#39;re referring to &#34;Becy&#34; I never met her when I arrived for my surgery she went back to the US for an emergency so I consulted with her Philippino consultant &#34;cherry&#34; she was great and super understanding person and helped me a lot with considering stuff and gave me her advice as wellü§ç. Some how I find Dr theerapong like an mad scientist with slow social skills but incredibly intelligent üß† with his work.

Beautiful work. Question I‚Äôm thinking about this in the future and since I‚Äôve lost so much size due to transitioning and am a grower not a shower I might need to do colon. I am just afraid of unpleasant odors. Any issues with that?

It&#39;s just a bad myth that has been spread I don&#39;t know why! After 3 months my wetness has become crystal clear like saliva and it doesn&#39;t smell bad at all. Even my pads smells nice after 24h if wear one.

Absolutely stunning results!! I‚Äôm so happy for you sister ü•π I‚Äôm seriously considering Dr. Theerapong for SRS Colon and BA. But I don‚Äôt know where to start and how to book with him as I live halfway across the world in Canada and don‚Äôt speak Thai. May I ask you a few questions to help me navigate the process if you don‚Äôt mind ? Please you don‚Äôt have to answer any questions if you‚Äôre not comfortable ü•π but it would mean a lot to me and help me out so much.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Did you go through Amani Thailand to book with Dr. Theerapong and for the post-op nursing care during your recovery in Thailand ?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How long was the SRS waitlist for Dr. Theerapong from the first point of contact to eventual date of surgery ? (I don‚Äôt know how long his current waitlist is so just want to have a heads-up to properly plan ahead)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How much did your BA cost ? Did Dr. Theerapong perform your BA together with your SRS at the same time ?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Are you happy with your BA result so far ? Would you recommend getting both SRS and BA from Theerapong at the same time ?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Did he require you to complete genital hair removal before the Colon SRS ? I live in a small town with no access to Laser Hair Removal or Electrolysis. I don‚Äôt know if he would agree to perform SRS on me without prior hair removal. I think with Colon SRS, your vaginal canal is mostly made of Colon, so there will be lesser need for extensive hair removal.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful results and experience with all of us. Really appreciate it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Glad you&#39;ve asked üíô what&#39;s the point of the posting here if you don&#39;t wanna help/guide others ‚≠ê.
</p>
<p>
Q1 : Dr theerapong doesn&#39;t have his own hospital or consultancy agency like other surgeons do (kamol/bank/etc) so that&#39;s why we&#39;ve to went through some third party agency, There are currently two agencies (1) Interplast (2) SIAM TRANSFORMATIVE &#34;new name AMANI&#34; Initially I contacted the SIAM (Amani) and got the date within month but couldn&#39;t able to secure it because my country doesn&#39;t allowed me to send money abroad üí©! Somehow I figured out how can I send them deposit to secure my date but at this point I have contacted INTERPLAST because Siam said we don&#39;t have date till year! But somehow Interplast said some patient has canceled her surgery so if you want it? So I booked it in February 2023 and the surgery was 07 March. But then again the difference between Siam (Amani) and Interplast is the aftercare interplast doesn&#39;t have aftercare service siam does so then again I flipped to the siam because of the 3 weeks of aftercare + accommodation.

Q2 : Yes Dr theerapong performed my BA and srs at the same time it costs me around 118000 Thai bhat

Q3 : Yes you&#39;re required to remove your hairs down there because of the vulva, the canal does not include your skin so there&#39;s less chance for hairs inside your canal but your vulva and it&#39;s entrance could get hairs which could become hard for you to shave or remove them because of the location! In my case I didn&#39;t had any much hairs down there already but still I got some around my vulva so I&#39;m planning to remove them further in future. So that means it&#39;s more likely good for you if you remove them before surgery if you could or specially if you&#39;re hairy down üëá there.

In my opinion the aftercare is much needed in this type of medical procedures specifically in a foreign land.
