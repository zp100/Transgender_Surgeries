I also had no pain. Just discomfort initially due to stitches, drains and catheter, which went away quickly.

Whoa! It just blows my mind how some of you have such high pain  threshold! I swear you grip me slightly harder than normal, and I already bruise hahah! Which of course makes me super scared for SRS, but I just will have to get through it.

I&#39;m also very interested in PPT, was the depth you got good? And how was the staff and treatment at PriyaMED?

Oh that sounds great, you know resarching where to have SRS and PriyaMED is often dismissed, but just the fact they do PPT is why they on my radar. So thanks for sharing your experience, wishing you a speedy recovery, please keep us updated.

yeah I had GRS (PI) at the same time as BA and the BA part was most of the pain. I didn&#39;t even need morphine, just paracetamol and and a NSAID the first few days.

Yeah I expected a lot of pain but my breast were the most painful procedure Iâ€™ve had and it was a pain threshold of like 2-3/10 just annoying that I couldnâ€™t sleep properly for a month or so but besides that my surgeries have been a walk in the park ðŸ˜…
