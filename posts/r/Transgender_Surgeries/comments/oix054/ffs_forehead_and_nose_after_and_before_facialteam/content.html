I personally like it a lot. I generally described what I wanted and they showed me a sketch of it and a simulstuon of it. I was happy with either. The sketch is more similar to the result than the simulation was.
</p>
<p>
Plus I had a horribly deviated septum and they fixed that lol

That’s def good to hear!
</p>
<p>
Ive currently got my simulations for facialteam and a second consultation booked, i like the forehead work and proposed hair transplants. But really unsure on the nose they simulated for me. I think i simply prefer the idea of a straighter nose but most pics I’ve seen have a bit of a curve, but still trying to figure out what I acta want for myself!
</p>
<p>
Thank you sooo much for putting your pics up btw! Your recovery and results look amazing!!!

I was dumb and said do what you think would suit my face, now I look like someone drew a Disney Princess nose on my face. I suggest going straight, even if they say a very gentle curve (they did with me) doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s what they&#39;ll do.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect I would have done my nose separately somewhere else.

Thank you thank you. I&#39;m surprised I feel as good as I do, and as non bruised and limited selling as I am. And I&#39;m really happy how it turned out
</p>
<p>
But ask them for a straighter nose, they&#39;re great at listening to what you want and making a plan with that in mind.
</p>
<p>
Also if it helps many women who go there report having a nose that was somewhat straighter than they desired, so I bet you&#39;ll have good luck.
</p>
<p>
I know the curve on mine is pretty darn noticable, more than I expected by far tbh. The simulation was very straight. But I&#39;m happy and I did ask them to do somewhat of a curve if possible.

No kidding right? I was amazed lol. The only bruising is a red line on my eyelid. And the swelling is down enough I can see my jawline.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very numb tho and my bottom lip is still 95% immobile (independently ofc, it moves with my jaw)

Yep, and tracheal shave, and ear pinning. But the swelling on my jawline is still such that you cant be clear enough in the result to be worth sharing. Tracheal cartilage is totally flat now. And ears don&#39;t stick out nearly as much
</p>
<p>
Altho I think right now the jaw is just about visible enough there&#39;s just one spot on each side that the swelling obscures a bit

I do hear jaw /chin is the worst recovery wise!

This is how a forehead should be done with nice smooth curvature and a really nice radix. Not too FLAT which ruins foreheads.
</p>
<p>
They are really the best at foreheads

Wow though 13 hours?! What did you have done apart from forehead and nose? I was considering FT, and also having a hairline advance using transplants. Mayer uses a different technique. He claims a 1” advance but it seems too far fetched IMO. 1cm more like.

I have a dumb question. With your new nose being smaller, can you breath as well through your nose? What about when you&#39;re exercising?

How much did you pay for the forhead? Mine looks a bit similar (I’m cis female) to your before, which I suppose is a bit more than usual for a cis woman but less for a cis man?

Fully understand (after all, I want to do something against mine and that is just purely aesthethic surgery for me), it was mostly from the perspective of if it required the same sort of procedure compared to people who have a very pronounced one (and subsequently hoping it would be cheaper).
</p>
<p>
Ugh it’s still quite expensive, but it’s to be expected... is there a prominent scar?
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much for the answer!

Well that makes sense!
</p>
<p>
Oh great! I googled the scar and saw someone having a big one on the top of the forhead and I’m super worried about scars (I already have a lot of them on my body) but that’s really great.
</p>
<p>
Did you do any other surgeries there relating to the face?
</p>
<p>
Btw your results are superb, it looks beautiful!

They sound really professional, especially also regarding how good your result looks I have really gotten a good impression from them.
</p>
<p>
Do you maybe know the approx price for jawline as well?
</p>
<p>
I hope it’s ok to ask questions - since some of these surgeries are rarely performed in the population as a whole outside say South Korea I feel like general plastic surgery forums don’t have the same amount of knowledge. And well, what I want done corresponds to common FFS surgeries.

Would only jaw be cheaper do you think? Thanks so much, it gives me an approx idea which is really good to work towards.

Oh yeah those in Korea seem very extreme, it often doesn’t look natural.

FacialTeam does coronal incision right? Did you experience hair loss? Or a slightly bigger forehead?

Oh okay, I assume if I show my concerns to them theyd be able to do something similar?
</p>
<p>
And I dont know if you know, but lets say I get coronal and it does cause hair loss, would it be possible to get hair transplants around the scar, or somewhere to cover it?
</p>
<p>
Another one, did you have a negative outcome or a trade-off in any procedure done? (you dont have to answer of course)
</p>
<p>
And laaast question I have for now, do you plan to do a follow up post? Not necessarily selfies or photos, but results and that stuff.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for asking so many questions, but Im seriously considering them aaa. They seem to be an amazing team with lots o experience, but surgery is surgery and risks are risks... x(

Im scared of outcomes like hair loss, bad results, numbness, vision complications, nerves stuff, anesthesia risks, blood loss, etc. Im just rly scared, I never had surgery and its frightening.
</p>
<p>
Knowing that you have had no stuff like that calms me down, and your photos show it. Id go for FacialTeam not only for their natural results, but also because everybody mentions they havent had tons of complications.
</p>
<p>
Like, I know one of the main complaints people have about FacialTeam (apart from cost) is that theyre conservative in their results/methods. OH BOY Id rather have conservative surgery rather than a harsh and extreme one.
</p>
<p>
Your results honestly give me tons of hope that itll be alright, but still its up to the surgery itself aaa
