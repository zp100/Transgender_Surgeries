Hii, hopefully it&#39;s okay if i ask this! If you can get all the dots in on the dilators, why do you need to see a pelvic floor therapist?

oh no worries, i get it sounds weird but basically i&#39;ve been experiencing a lot of tightness which i was told is normal, but my vagina has gotten a LOT more tight than it used to be (only 2 months out so i am still very early in healing) which requires me to use more force to push my dilator in and more force when taking it out. plus my dilation sessions have been a lot more painful (sort of stretching wise but more recently the inside has just been so tight and uncomfortable) a therapist would help be with getting more control over my pelvic floor and make stuff easier hopefully.

for my most recent dilation i actually got it in pretty quick.. after getting tired of waiting for 10 min of holding it there and slowly pushing in, i kind of hunched over and looked down and kinda pushed it in and weirdly enough it didn&#39;t hurt as much and went it like super fast. maybe it&#39;s cuz i activated my core and that took stress off of my pelvic floor, or maybe the fact that looking at the dots going in kind of distracted me? but imma try it again tomorrow and see if it&#39;s the same. but aside from that once it&#39;s in it still takes a few minute for my body to relax cuz it feels like i&#39;m practically absorbing the dilator.

Can i ask which dilator you&#39;re on? Some kits have green as the biggest, and some have orange as the biggest! When you dilate are you take deep breaths from your core and relaxing everything? I usually just play music and go on my phone while dilating and let my body do its thing! Right now im past the 5th dot on blue and im almost past the 4th on green!

i use the soul source set, so it goes from purple, blue, green, then orange. i was on blue for about 2 weeks but had to size back down due to the pain from dilating. i&#39;ve done the deep breathes focusing on my core, relaxing, stretches. it doesn&#39;t really help lol. i did get this lidocaine gel that i put on the entrance of my canal and let it sit for 15 min before i dilate and that&#39;s kind of helped with pain but most of it is internal. i have youtube going on my tv and also tend to scroll on my phone, but i don&#39;t got the time to be sitting in bed all day dilating so i tend to go thru the pain for about 5 minutes and then chill for the rest of my time. then do it 2 more times through the day üòª

They have lidocain gel???? You&#39;re telling me I&#39;ve been rawdogging my way through this, lol!!üíÄ‚ò†Ô∏è im really glad you&#39;re going to see a pelvic floor specialist soon! I honestly wish they would give us a free session or two included with the surgery! Its okay though! Its a count down to doing it less and less!‚ò∫Ô∏è

YES!!! the one i have is from Good Clean Love, the relief gel. idk if there&#39;s lube for anything internal but that is a dif type of pain (more uncomfortable than painful) so that gel helps SO much with the outside. i have to get a referral for the specialist tho cuz i can&#39;t afford out of pocket. so it&#39;s just a lot of waiting which has been annoying but im just glad that atleast the aesthetics are nice, it makes all this pain worth it

i know this isn&#39;t a direct question related to surgery, but as a fellow 18 year old transfem individual i&#39;m curious how you must have felt going in to do this surgery at such a comparatively young age to the rest of the community. Did this affect your schooling or friends at all? i&#39;m not gonna ask what grade you are going into but i would be stressed out if this was happening during my school terms.

I transitioned at 13 and have a similar timeline as op, got surgery a month after turning 18. Friends wise, not so much but I&#39;d say my schooling was pretty disturbed because of having too much dysphoria and right now im 3 months post op and still need to write some exams and then go off to uni in feb. definitely a tad overly stressful right now.
</p>
<p>
Especially with dilation and having to plan around friends and studying and other sudden life stuff (but I assume everyone struggles with this quite a bit)

Also SRS at 18, with Suporn, and took a whole year off. I got really bored after the first few months and looking back I wish I‚Äôd made better use of that time to enjoy being ‚Äúsort of done‚Äù, but at least it gave me plenty of time to dilate lol. I didn‚Äôt have a lot of friends though, and the countdown for the year beforehand was honestly pretty rough.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôll admit I wish I could have met some fellow teenage girlies at the time going through the same, it was rather lonely way back when I did it (over a decade now). But I‚Äôm so grateful to my younger self who was barely more than a child, who endured something so scary and painful in the face of loads of casual transphobia, to give the life I have now. It was so worth it.

honestly i&#39;ve been wanting the surgery since forever so i was already prepared for it. i was obviously a little nervous cuz it&#39;s a surgery but tbh i was actually pretty prepared for it. also after my surgery i didn&#39;t really feel (mentally) any different. i mean even now it&#39;s just me. i don&#39;t think of myself as a trans woman per say but im just me. i actually dropped out of school after sophomore year LOL so i had no scheduling issues. after dropping out i&#39;ve kept a close knit friend group, and 2 of my friends actually came to cali with me and my mom when i got my surgery so i didn&#39;t feel like i was going through it alone. honestly a lot of girls get it during the summer which gives you 2 months but like with dilating 3 times a day idk how some girls do it. like before going to school then after school then at night. girl i barely do anything and its annoying having to do it rn so i couldn&#39;t imagine.
</p>
<p>
Edit: forgot to add that even if i didn&#39;t drop out i would&#39;ve already been graduated by the time i got my surgery. considering i have an early birthday and this would&#39;ve happened the summer of my senior year

that actually depends on the type of surgery u got. for ppt and specifically for me i was told not to douche as to establish a natural flora. constantly douching would mess up my ph balance and cause issues such as bv. id encourage everyone to ask their doctors about douching and any smells as it is different in many cases.

This is kinda of crazy because I also got ppt method in June at 18 and I was also blocked. The 12th slide shook me a bit because IT LOOKS SO SIMILAR TO MINE. Who was your surgeon?

i know and that&#39;s why i wanted to come in here and share my experience, considering the fact that a lot of people in here are (no shade) mid 20s , went thru puberty. i think us girls who had blockers their whole life need something to show that it is possible!

If it was more common to get them we‚Äôd probably see more but sadly it‚Äôs not as common as it should be.

I have no doubt it‚Äôs possible just I wish blockers were used more. As someone who grew up without them.

first off tsym for 2 months honestly she looks so good. um orgasm wise i mean idk if i&#39;ve ever experienced it? i mean i masturbated but i&#39;ve never been able to cum since i&#39;ve never went thru puberty, but i did have some precum? but i have yet to masturbate after surgery yet, it&#39;s kind of uncomfortable to do much to my clit, the right side of it is still numb but the left side has some feeling coming back. i mean i have tried to rub it to make sure everything&#39;s working, but it just feels weird rn. i am keeping in mind that i am only 8 weeks out so i&#39;m really not that obsessed over it. but if i do in the future i&#39;ll definitely make sure to post about it :3

LMAOOOOO ur mad for what.. cuz i went to the doctor with the most experience in the field with trans adults who never went through puberty and has done over 2 thousand surgeries. i shared my experience and only joined this reddit after having my date set . lol srry i&#39;m not someone who&#39;s chronically online and i just got a surgery with the dr who&#39;s been recommended to me by all of my other doctors. ur right i am 18 and clearly having a better life than you so maybe get off ur 40 year old high horse hating on someone who did absolutely nothing to u. GET REAL FLOP! üòú

what you should&#39;ve said is &#34;i apologize for coming at you in this manner under this thread of you trying to educate the masses on having this type of surgery when you didn&#39;t go through puberty. thank you for sharing your experience.&#34; yea obviously i sound 18 because i am 18. not my problem that you came under here tryna be slick and act shocked when someone clocks you. you saying i &#34;got what i deserve&#34; is kinda nasty. obviously you meant it in a rude way but truly im healing very well especially for 2 months. can you say the same or are you just going under every trans girls post and leaving the same &#34;ü§Æ&#34; emoji. i truly invite you to seek therapy because some of these girls may not have responded to you but i have the time and i am the one. i know this is only giving you a rise but i want you to know that as i type this with a smile and a happy life, i know you&#39;re reading this with a dictionary on your side trying to understand what i am saying to you. so i don&#39;t need your luck, but good luck to YOU.‚ù§Ô∏è
