hi some time ago i was being sad here talking about regretting srs and sex being shit and stuff. i had been on lexapro and wellbutrin for many years but on a low dose, it was even on my doctor&#39;s radar i could get off it at some point as i had been doing well. ever since srs even without things going wrong i felt out of it,  disconnected from my enotions and body and side effects like sexual dysfunction were reallt fucking me up. so since some weeks ago ive been off those meds and wow i instantly feel so much better and sex is so good. i instantly went from regretting surgery to suddenly just feeling peace and hope about life in a way i never have before.... pre op i had these effects to a minor extent and these side effects have also plagued by family members on the same meds but due to dysphoria it had beeb considered worth it in exchange for the good effects. but post op i think recovery was such a shock to my system and metabolism and as part of that the side effects got so much worse and made me feel shitty. i went from a deep rut to being on cloud nine and im so glad. definitely talk to ur doctor before doing anything like messing with meds, especially since i was on such a low dose to begin with, but this is something that i didnt think would make such a difference but it totally changed my outlook :)!
