1 year followup on FFS with Bart van de Ven - extremely cosmetically good result, but probably cut like 80% of the nerves in my forehead

This is a followup to my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/epjy65/a_quick_review_of_my_ffs_with_bart_van_de_ven/">FFS review
</a>
regarding my surgery with Bart van de Ven, one year post-op. I have now fully recovered, with everything having settled, with the minor exception of my rhinoplasty - a few parts still feel a little swollen and stiff.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s honestly not much to say beyond the topic title. Cosmetically, my result is very strong, and I felt he closely followed my directions. My forehead and nose were made radically softer - more so than I&#39;ve seen from most other western surgeons - while still not appearing unnatural. The scarring has also healed/been disguised to the point it is basically impossible to notice.
</p>
<p>
However, it cannot be ignored that he does not seem to have paid much regard to my nerves. The sensitivity of my brow and even roughly a third of my scalp area is shot. I can still feel it if things touch it, but it&#39;s like it&#39;s coming through a layer of thick fabric. I can still control my eyebrows, but the lack of feedback makes me feel much less confident about what expression I am making, and small, precise movements are difficult. In addition, plucking the upper part of them has become uncomfortable to the point that I&#39;ve been trying to find a shape that avoids it - like a little electric shock, almost.
</p>
<p>
There is also a loss of sensitivity around my chin incision for my trachea shave, though this is less important. It remains uncertain if these two will heal in the longer term.
</p>
<p>
My commentary on him from a year ago is basically the same, with a bit more emphasis on the negative. I believe Dr. Bart is a fundamentally capable surgeon with a good aesthetic eye who can do very good work for people seeking stronger changes, especially if you get him on a good day when he isn&#39;t overbooked. He is also very affordable for a western country, with all the legal and medical safety that confers. However, he takes on an extremely high workload that likely results in carelessness and rushed outcomes, even though I imagine most of his patients do not encounter serious complications. I would recommend considering him if you believe you need radical changes and are on a budget, but to otherwise choose someone safer.

I have read a lot of reports from him that indicate nerve damage. He must really struggle finding the nerves to avoid cutting and dealing with them.
</p>
<p>
I just had FFS 7 days ago and my scalp is 100% numb. My forehead and brow area have no numbness though, going all the way up to the hairline scar itself. Right past that scar though, my ENTIRE upper scalp is numb. It&#39;s pretty trippy.
</p>
<p>
I have a feeling this area will never come back. It&#39;s just that profoundly numb. My doc warned me of it and it seems it&#39;s a very common complication. I don&#39;t really care much about the scalp numbness.
</p>
<p>
But to also have the brow numbness is kind of rough. I definitely would hesitate to go to this doctor just for the sheer volume of nerve damage complaints. There was another post in this sub from a trans woman who had both mental nerves severed. It was such a shameful thing.

I&#39;m that victim of Bart Van de Ven. All my mental nerves severed and my nerve canal and ID nerves destroyed. He cut them all off and threw them in the bin. This surgeon is incompetent as he can&#39;t identify nerves in real surgery plus he doesn&#39;t give a damn about arteries and nerves. He just chops.

You have to sever the forehead nerves unless the brow bone is shaved endoscopically. Most of the time they grow back to some degree, but it&#39;s not guaranteed. It&#39;s not like the mental nerve, which can and should be avoided because it won&#39;t grow back if the bone canal it&#39;s located in is removed.

Why for some people do they get complete forehead/brow numbness whereas others just get scalp numbness?
</p>
<p>
I have zero forhead numbness.

Depends on the doctor if they can identify nerves. In Bart&#39;s case I don&#39;t think he can during surgery and he simply doesn&#39;t care. He must have graduated last in med school. Another issue with him is even if this was raised to him he doesn&#39;t make improvements and denies all wrong doing. Why would you go to a surgeon like that.

I think it&#39;s the difference between the incision, which pretty much everyone has whether it&#39;s pretrichial or coronal, and burring the supraorbital foramen. You do the latter, it&#39;s not coming back. It&#39;s unclear what OP is describing. From the &#34;electric shock&#34; sensation it does sound like the nerves around her eyebrows are regrowing, but personally I like you never lost sensation there.

To be clear, I still have some sensation everywhere at this point, even on my scalp. It&#39;s just more and muted the closer to the incision.

Yeah same. I have scalp numbness at 9 days and honestly from HOW numb it is I kinda feel like it&#39;s not going to come back lol. But who knows, I could be wrong. But I had no forehead numbness.
</p>
<p>
The supraorbital foramen looks like a dangerous place to work around!
