So one thing you can do is get surgically dilated. Basically a surgeon will put you to sleep and then use a cocktail of drugs and applicants to totally relax the muscles and then they stick the dilator in there for about an hour at depth. They also break up scar tissue in there that could be blocking the dilator.
</p>
<p>
Its minimally invasive and an outpatient procedure, and it has worked to regain lost depth in patients before whose pelvic floor muscles got too tight.

Wow, I didn’t know this was an option and have been basing my procedure choice off of the fear of lost depth. Thank you for sharing this, makes me less ambivalent on potentially choosing aesthetically focused options.

If its lack if depth from the skin that was used this is not going to help. They can only stretch it so far before it splits and enters the tissue behind.
</p>
<p>
Op has at least 3 inches and that&#39;s past the pelvic floor muscles.
</p>
<p>
Width is different and may be increased by enlargement / dilation under sedation  but it&#39;s all just hearsay and no real measurable  studies have been carried out.

All of trans care is heresay, nobody does studies on anything. Doctors still mass prescribe Spiro, surgeons still require patients to stop E, etc. It&#39;s all random guessing because the medical industry doesn&#39;t care to actually do research.

It depends on the surgeon. My surgeon requires all forms of E to be stopped two weeks prior to surgery. Some forms even further out. But apparently he has actually seen DVT on the table. So after I learned that I was a little more accepting. I still don&#39;t like it. My boobs shrunk a lot but I understand the concern better now. Hopefully when I start E back up (hopefully next week) my boobs will quickly return to their prior size, hopefully even bigger.

It&#39;s actually because synthetic estrogens in the 80s and 90s did give you a colossal clotting factor, the problem is nobody cares to actually change the habit once bioidentical became the norm and trans women suddenly had the clotting factor of cis women undergoing surgery.

Pills that go through the liver can interact poorly with other administered medications, but you should always be dissolving those sublingually or buccally anyway.

Just for peace of mind. I stopped dilating about 7 mths after my op. I had a few complications and couldn&#39;t get help anywhere in Australia or from my surgeon. So I just gave up.
</p>
<p>
She is fine, I can use fingers and small dildos. If things don&#39;t work out it will still be ok. We have options down the track like others have mentioned.
</p>
<p>
I know this can be devastating mentally, what exactly is the issue, is it depth only or is their pain associated with dilation?

Ok, so remember to breath.
</p>
<p>
The issues you are facing while hard to deal with are not life threatening nor will you loose the use of your beautiful vagina.
</p>
<p>
To me it sounds like a lot of other things are going on in your world and this issue is just pushing you over the edge.
</p>
<p>
So many of us have been through this, if you need to talk, my DMs are always open. You will be ok😁❤️
</p>
<p>
So, just breath. Stressing will accomplish nothing except make your body tired and broken.

Are you using enough lube? Also you have probs tried this but try dif positions, something that’s working for me a lot has been lying on my side with my legs either out straight or by my chest, also sometime when I have my legs straight out I kinda tense my legs together which quite often helps get it further in. I really hope it gets better :)

I did pelvic floor therapy because I lost a lot of depth post surgery. It started about 2 weeks post with some minimal loss but over time continued to close.   Over the four years since surgery I have lost a total of  about 4 inches. Pretty upsetting not to mention dilation is uncomfortable. Pelvic floor therapy is typically where surgeons will re-route you after surgery so they continue to see new patients for surgery. Sadly it is very difficult to regain lost depth.

The first dot on a soul source dilator is about 3.6 inches and past the pelvic floor muscles from my own experience. Diagrams on my profile of the dilators etc.
</p>
<p>
Again this is my own experience... physiotherapy helped a bit for pain but your depth is what it is. Its very unlikely you can gain significant depth through dilation.
</p>
<p>
Your scars are amazing ! Much better than mine.

Who was your surgeon ?

There are options for revision surgery including peritoneal or colon tissue so it&#39;s not the end of the world. Both will give you more depth but may mean reduced sensation in the canal.
</p>
<p>
I would ask your surgeon about it.... 4? inches is not enough imho.

I don’t have it in me to go through another surgery. I just don’t. Are you sure ? Like where did you get the information that dilating can’t make significant depth changes?

Where did i get my information.... my surgeon for one, then reading several hudred posts on here because he was full of shit and should and should be struck off the list.
</p>
<p>
I feel your pain, honestly.
</p>
<p>
Your post op length is near the maximum you can ever get. Most people lose a little bit or manage to maintain what they have. Very few can increase it through vigilant dilating, seems like half inch at most.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want any more surgery EVER after the trauma from the first two so i know what you mean. In your case though maybe a revision work and give you the needed depth ? Just make sure your surgeon has good reviews/ experience etc.

Meaningful penetration with a penis. I know cis women have about that much depth but their vagina is a LOT more stretchy.

i promise you depth is the last thing a man is worrying about... and ik sex is a big thing but your gonna feel the dick inside you whether you have large depth or not. youll have a dainty vagina and thats okay 😭 ive been learning this myself... i hope i didnt say it in a mean way but any inche is better than no inches at all! 🫶🏾

give it time... its gonna be lots of tears and whatever female rage is for you. just remember pussy is pain and being a female is ultimately sad.... BUT the world is literally designed for you so do as you please with that information. you&#39;ve truthfully gone from being a trans person to making the decision that you are a woman with your whole entire BEING! 🫶🏾 literally give urself more credit... having a vagina is not easy... and know that your are allowed to complain!!! its your vagina and when it gets on your nerves its okay to be upset and angry! no book could prepare u for being a female not even females could prepare... ultimately you took the choice away from yourself and if you regret having a pussy thats fine cuz i bet lots of girls wish they couldve been boys... its okay to regret but just know at the end of everyday when u look in the mirror you are fully who u are... no longer two people in one body but now just one WHOLE! you got this girl.

Is this your opinion or a fact????? Guys penises come in all sizes and also penetration isn’t important for EVERY guy… maybe you need to reevaluate the kind of guys you mess with… you sound negative and arrogant 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼

Agree. No no one who under goes a traumatic and emotionally and physically draining surgery like vaginoplasty would be happy to come out of it when it is all said and done and have 3 inch vaginal depth and painful intercourse.

I&#39;ve seen some other comments to the affect of my suggestion, but I&#39;m going to say it too in order to reinforce it. 😋
</p>
<p>
Consult your surgeon, and tell them you&#39;re concerned that you&#39;re losing depth due to scar tissue and such. They can do an examination and assess how bad it is. If you no longer have a surgeon, like they changed practice or whatever, you can consult a new one local to you.
</p>
<p>
I had to have a widening procedure because of elasticity issues, and the surgeon made sure there wasn&#39;t any scar tissue closure causing issues for me. Also when I started dilating once a month it takes me an hour before I can achieve full depth again. Really annoying stuff.

I’ve consulted hommmsny times and he’s doing what he knows which honestly isn’t much. He’s straight up lied to my face about several things and some of this is his fault because he doesn’t train his staff, is never in the fucking office and takes forever to deal with urgent issues until they’re too late. After reading a lot Im pretty sure that a lot of this could have been prevented there was a ton of dishonesty and error on the part of him and their team.

When I was going through the shrinkage and chronic pain I went into the office repeatedly and was just ignored, I was told oh that’s normal you’ll be alright. And my vagina rapidly shrank to two fucking inches. It wasn’t taken seriously. My life was completely dismissed and I was just sent home with no more than I came in with. He bullshitted me so much of dilation and recovery I was more informed before my first consultation

Things they don&#39;t tell you outside of reddit... While there may be other complications, what you are experiencing, what I experience, and it sounds like what a lot of other commenters here have experienced, is scar tissue. Just scar tissue. It&#39;s painful and takes up space. Your depth may still be there and good on you for putting yourself through hell, because you care and you are trying. The only thing I found that worked for me was massage, starting from my physical therapist, then a mix of myself and my partner, softer smaller dilators and finally some larger dilators.
</p>
<p>
Here is what I recommend:
</p>
<p>
1) - Good Clean Love lubricant This has aloe in it and has less viscosity, because those thicker lube takes up space and gets in the way
</p>
<p>
2) - Massage Externally this would look like two fingers, one on either side of the scar tissue, and firmly move the scar in all directions. You want it to move, it might not at first but work it for 30 seconds to a few minutes and it will start to break that tissue up under the skin
</p>
<p>
3) -  Massage Internally same thing but you might only be able to use one finger. You might only be able to reach part way and this is where a partner really helps, just someone you trust. It will be painful, there will be blood but you want blood! It means your breaking the tissue up and you&#39;re healing.
</p>
<p>
4) - Intimate Rose dilators This is costly but the benefit is small sizes in length and width and I recommend once you find the size you can fit all the way, sit on it. Or pull you pants up to hold it in and walk back and forth just a little. This massages the parts you and your partner cannot reach
</p>
<p>
After I did all that for a few weeks to a few month I started returning to larger. I also made my own custom dilators out of platinum silicon, but that was timely and costly. There are custom providers online for glass dilators, but I think you want something softer while you are experiencing pain.

Understood, that&#39;s a huge barrier and the cost to do it yourself is high. Try intimate Rose size 5 and good clean love. I think that will make a difference. Plus lots of massage, all that you can bare. But I am not a professional, just went through it myself.

There are 3d print services all over. I used some 3d print hub and found a guy to work with. I printed a lot of iterations too. The guy was really close to my house and helped a lot. I&#39;m not saying it will be that easy for everyone, but it&#39;s a thought.

Who was your surgeon? Dilating regularly should allow for the depth the surgeon qualified you should have. Many transgender women do not have enough tissue to perform an “unassisted” procedure. Dr’s can use PPT or some of your colon/intestinal tissue to increase depth.  The Dr should know when this is required.

They’re called haegar dilators, you can actually look them up on Amazon, look up metal dilators for urethral sounding.

Maybe try different positions dilating?  Muscle relaxers?  Yoga?
</p>
<p>
I’ve not yet had vaginoplasty but I will soon and I’m already planning the things I might try in order to get and maintain the depth I want.

I seriously regret getting this surgery. Had I known this was a risk I would have just not gotten it. I was learning to be ok with what I had. This just ruined my life

Check out Shape Shifter channel on You Tube. She might be able to help you more by learning about her story. I also had loss of depth and have not been able to regain it and do not want to go through anymore surgeries that could further complicate my sitaution.

I don&#39;t think she&#39;s a good example for anyone. She got botched by a surgeon known for that kind of thing, then went and got botched yet again by another surgeon also known for that. She&#39;s got issues.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s posted here in the past.

Yes I would agree with much of what you said. But aside from that there are many other girls who have dealt with difficulties around loss of depth that went to top trending surgeons who are respected. I went to a leading surgeon that people are waiting three years to see for surgery right now and lost a really significant amount of depth.

Oh honey, I’m sorry.  It’s so painful to push against the rear like that.  My surgeon stressed that you never gain depth after surgery.  Only width.  I strongly recommend you go To another surgeon and get some peace of mind from them.  Don’t go back to that person again :/. Hang in there.
