I&#39;ve seen mentions of people gaining depth but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s actually a thing.
</p>
<p>
By most accounts I got decent depth (6inches) however I was hoping to get a bit more, granted I am bigger so I may have some extra &#34;cushion for the push&#39;n&#34;, however my partner is uh a good bit bigger than that and i like the idea of not having to resort to anal to make up for the depthðŸ˜….
</p>
<p>
So I was wondering if one could gain a bit through Dilating, whether it&#39;s because of reduced swelling or with extra pressure idk.
</p>
<p>
While I&#39;m not particularly upset with my depth I just know I can&#39;t go to anyone outside of Ramineni to get work done and the idea of a colon revision for depth is probably completely off the table.
</p>
<p>
I understand this is a privilege and again as a big person I am particularly lucky and I am happy ðŸ˜Š  I just want to make sure my partner is also happy.

</p>

I want to like enjoy sex with my partner very much you know. Is it just a matter of more pressure (like u know like tugging on an earlobe?
</p>
<p>
I am constantly trying to apply more pressure in my sessions (like actually)

Dynamic dilation?  What&#39;s that? Would you mind chatting?

When you dilate, do it in a stirring motion as you go in and out. Kind of like expanding a hole in the dirt or on the beach.

Hmmm ok so it&#39;s like stretching all of it not just the end.
</p>
<p>
I have been doing a light twisting motion at the end to help the blue dilator get in all the way easier ðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
By what you described, is that strictly a when I&#39;m further along healing kind of thing or is it like safe at 4weeks?
</p>
<p>
And I&#39;d imagine I should do a full session to depth first?
</p>
<p>
This is so fascinating

Oh, still push against the bottom of your vaginal cavity. It will stretch. I had intercourse with a guy with more than 10&#34; a few times! And I came HARD!

I mean like the dynamic dilation part would be after you dilated to depth right?
</p>
<p>
So like do like 20mins to maintain then go dynamic? And how soon is that safe.
</p>
<p>
Holy hell 10 inches o.o like all the way in?
</p>
<p>
I had PIV and and got a bit over 6...that&#39;s uh a lot to gain o.o how long have you been at it?
