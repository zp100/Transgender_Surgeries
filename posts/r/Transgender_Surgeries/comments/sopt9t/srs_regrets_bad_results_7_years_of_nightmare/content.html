Hi reddit. I am post op trans woman. 7 years ago I had penile inversion and my life turned into nightmare. Back then not many people talked about complications or downside of getting bottom surgery. I had multiple revisions and till today I only have 1 inch tunnel and I am unable to have sex. I just wish back in the days there was more information out there. I created YouTube channel trying to share my experience and got contacted by whole bunch of women who had a lot of complications. Complications are very real and more common than we are lead to believe. I am not a terf.  In fact terfs often attack me on daily basis online  and tell me that I &#34;mutilated&#34; myself and deserve what happened to me. I never thought I was trailblazer of any kind when I got my gender confirmation surgery in 2015. I thought surgeons have been doing it for years and I will get acceptable results with minimal risks. In the past five years a lot of people have been sharing their complications stories on youtube. Please do as much research as you can and do not rush into things.
</p>
<p>
I just want to spread the message that surgeries need improvement. And we need new bioengineered tissue to help trans community. I know disphoria is a b...tch but if you can hold off with surgeries maybe better techniques will be discovered soon.
</p>
<p>
Here is link to one of my videos talking about my experiences

First two surgeries by Sherman Leis that results in vaginal stenosis. Two last ones by Christopher Salgado that resulted in colorectal fistula.

I&#39;ve literally had a pretty similar experience with other trans people trying to shame me into shutting up because I may, &#34;Turn someone else off of surgery&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Even people from this very sub!!
</p>
<p>
Way to go for speaking out! I went to a board certified surgeon, (Dr. Salgado), who are without exception expected to be the best of the best in America. Screwed up big time, multiple complications I was absolutely not informed about, and then he and his team tried to gaslight me into not getting a second opinion.
</p>
<p>
Of course I did anyways, had two other consults with two different board certified surgeons in two other states, not to mention many, many, many Dr visits in-between, and was told there was basically nothing wrong with my results, that this was &#34;normal&#34; and that I was shit out of luck.
</p>
<p>
At this point, idgas, people in our community are extremely vulnerable and these surgeons take advantage of the fact that we have a lot of mental illness going on and a lot of times don&#39;t have the support or willpower to do anything about a screw up surgery after the fact.
</p>
<p>
Something needs to change, regulations and the board overview of practicing surgeons because the state of srs surgery in America is behind closed doors, until lately no one has wanted to speak up in the fear of it being used against our community but this is literally our lives on the line. Minor complications of the urethra are causing death, not to mention the amount of revisions we&#39;re being sold.

No. Ppt was not an option. I know a girl who had ppt with bluebond and it failed. She is currently looking into colonvaginoplasty.

I’m terribly sorry this has been your experience. I’m scheduling to go to one of the top surgeons out of country. I’m also preparing to accept the worst outcome with the most amount of complications that this surgeon has ever had. I do believe if you are not preparing yourself for the worst outcome, and would still be glad you tried even if that happens, bottom surg is probably not the right option for you. I’m sorry there was not better information available and that this happened.

Also, it’s not clear in my comments. But I don’t in any way want to downplay what happened to you and the severity of that impact on your life. It could happen to me. It’s not your fault, and I truly feel for you and am very grateful that you have shared your experience. It’s incredibly important that your voice is heard and people with your experience are taken seriously.

There are a few in the US but banks and suporn have been renowned for years. That being said, they still sometimes have patients with terrible outcomes. This is the same with any surgery that is a similar complexity across all fields. The best of the very best, occasionally have really bad outcomes. It’s ALWAYS a possibility with a surgery like that. People die from competent practiced anesthesiologists. People who have great skills, outcomes, done it hundreds of times, still can kill people.

Very sorry to hear your story. I do think complications, especially those related with internal part, depth and dilation, are real. Without reading enough posts on Reddit, I would have chosen a full-depth vaginoplasty. Now I changed my plan to a minimal depth vulvoplasty. I am not interested in sex, so I&#39;m comfortable with minimal depth. Do you think that would avoid most possible complications based on your experience?

Thanks a lot. I really agree with you on the point that people should research more on the various aspects of the surgery and I really appreciate people sharing their experience recently as that will be very helpful for other people making decisions.

You&#39;re misunderstanding the occurrence and cause of problems like this. There&#39;s a very large difference between surgeons.

Even without serious complications, I would say the loss of depth/girth (stenosis and strictures) is one of the most common problems for full depth vaginoplasty according to statistical research. This means the current methods need to be improved or revolutionized and I agree with OP&#39;s point on this. The current methods are not the most ideal.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984836/" rel="nofollow">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984836/</a>
&#34;From all the complications of interest, fistula had the lowest rate with only 1% (&lt;0.1%–2%), whereas stenosis and strictures had the highest rate with 11% (8%–14%). For stenosis and strictures, intestinal-based vaginoplasty had the highest complication rate with 14% (5%–26%) compared with the penile skin inversion technique with 10% (8%–14%).&#34;

The top surgeons don’t have rates of complications like that, that link is not top surgeons, and neither did the op go to any.

This is one of them.

Do you have statistics for those top surgeons for long term depth/girth numbers? I would say fistula highly depends on surgeons technique but long term depth/girth depends on a lot factors, including dilation, scar formation tendency, anatomy, etc., which means the current methods are not ideal. Even among top surgeons, the most common problem would also be depth/girth issues. I&#39;m not saying the absolute complications rate, but how common this is compared to other problems. We cannot ignore how common this subject appears on this sub. People should find new ways for the surgery and the whole dilation thing is really not ideal.

I am so sorry about what you have been through. But I wonder for the person who is not seeking penetrative sex and depth (me), what&#39;s wrong with vaginal stenosis? Of course, I prefer a fully functional 7-inch vagina, but come on, that&#39;s not going to happen. It&#39;s a small possibility to have the same depth vagina especially if you have Penile inversion. so my expectations are low, I am not into depth or penetrative sex. I just want to be able to orgasm, have good esthetics, no hair inside. So I am asking after vaginal stenosis, is there any chance to leave it like that? Or you must definitely get a revision surgery? If that happens to me, I will consider that I got minimal depth vaginoplasty. can&#39;t I leave it like that? do I HAVE to get the revision? Is that compulsory?
