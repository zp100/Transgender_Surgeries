Absolutely get hair removal done ASAP. You can call your surgeon&#39;s office and see if they can tell you what areas of hair should be removed, though this is ultimately optional.

I&#39;d recommend joining the twin cities trans discord server if you aren&#39;t already in it. I&#39;m seeing Pariser for an orchi in a few months and people there have been generally really helpful. I can get you an invite if you PM me

When I spoke with Pariser last fall (2021), he said it’s not that there’s a zillion people on his waitlist. It’s that they just can’t find enough staffing for vaginoplasty procedures, and access to equipment. Not sure how much has to do with the pandemic — I suspect that’s the case.
</p>
<p>
Conversely, he said an orchiectomy can be had quite a bit sooner since much less staffing is required and it’s an in-and-out procedure. I finally submitted my formal interest in the orchi today. I asked roughly how long the wait list is for that. Intake coordinator said about 2-3 mos. once the pre authorization is officialized.
</p>
<p>
So, at the very very least, a vaginoplasty is longer than 2-3 mos.
</p>
<p>
I’m biding my time for the vaginoplasty. The orchi is merely to save my sanity from spiro and finasteride. I’m surprised at just how well regarded Pariser is, considering he was very much the #2 there to the veteran Dr. Kim for a long while. I guess Pariser has sort of been the revision wizard by those who know. And now that he’s in the drivers seat after Dr. Kim’s departure, he can perform the fullest extent of the procedure the way he believes things should be, so as to avoid the need for many revisions.

I had very similar discussion with Dr Stiller in Spokane. Procedures that could be done in his office surgery room were 2-4 months.  Anything requiring hospitalization was mid 2023.  I went the orchi path for now and have orchi and trachea shave scheduled for March.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with getting your orchi approved and scheduled.

The surgeon that did mine only had a 3 mo th wait list for me, but I was scheduled out 7 months so I could get my electrolysis done in time.
