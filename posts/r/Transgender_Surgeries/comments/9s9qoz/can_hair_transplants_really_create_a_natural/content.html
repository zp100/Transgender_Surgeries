Your hairline really doesn&#39;t look as bad as you may think it does. There are plenty of cis women who have an M-shaped hairline, and it&#39;s not as uncommon as we&#39;re often led to believe.

is a good example, and her forehead is higher too, but I don&#39;t think anyone would consider her unfeminine at all.
</p>
<p>
I mean, you do what you feel you need to do, I&#39;m certainly not saying you shouldn&#39;t. But I just wanted to reiterate the point that your hairline as it is now isn&#39;t as unfeminine as I feel like you think it is. I have a fivehead and a slight M shape, and used to worry about it. But I haven&#39;t been misgendered in public in over a year, and literally no one has ever said word one about it, so I no longer worry about it. Obviously dysphoria comes in many forms and if it&#39;s something that affects you that severely, then I totally understand. But if it&#39;s just something you&#39;re a bit concerned about, I don&#39;t think you really need to be.

Out of curiosity are you actually balding or does your hair just sit like that? I have a very similar hairline myself and wear a similar part so I’m curious as well.

Has it changed since then? Cause I’m definitely not balding but obviously i had a different hairline before puberty. I’m 33 and I’ve had that hairline since like 17 or 18 too. I’m not saying don’t get the transplants or anything but you might not be balding at least.

The reason why some hair tranplants seem to lack density is because of the limited number of follicles that a surgeon can extract and transplant during a given time. When you try to spread 2,000 or 3,000 follicles over a much larger space than the original donor area, there are limits to the kind of density that you can achieve. However, given how small of an area needs to be filled in on your hairline (if at all), I don&#39;t think that density is something that you have to worry about.

Well first, dont fo for wigs, they will never give you the result you currently have and would be a step back.
</p>
<p>
As for hair transplants I got some just to round out my shape and they are growing in great. Other than the fact that its 8 inches shorter than the rest of my hair youd never tell.

You have the makings of what is called a widows peak.  Where the center hair goes toward a point and the sides recede.  I just googled it and found pictures of styles you can use. There is also a link to questions on Reddit or you might just do a quick search on here for widows peak. Hope this helps!

Ask any surgeons you consult with if they do hairline adjustments.
</p>
<p>
I’ve just had this done as part of my FFS.
</p>
<p>
I wasn’t balding on top but hairline was moving heavily into receding male M pattern.
</p>
<p>
Essentially when the surgeon does the brow shaving they also pull the scalp forward at the temples and hairline.
</p>
<p>
I’ve gained about a centimetre. It’s not perfect but much, much better and a cleaner line than before. You get a small scar that runs just inside the hairline.
</p>
<p>
I’m only 6 weeks post-op and the scar is still a bit red but once it fades it should just blend in with the scalp.
