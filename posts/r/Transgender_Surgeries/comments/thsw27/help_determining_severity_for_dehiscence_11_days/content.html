This will look fine in a few months. Keep it extremely clean. Mine looked horrendous in the early days. It now looks great.  Stay positive. This is not what it will look like.

Do not give up hope.  Complications like this happen. Gently clean the vulva at least twice daily with soap and water and gently rinse area.  Pat dry.   Apply bacitracin ointment and cover with 4×4 gauze pads. The gauze may stick to area.  When you change it will lightly debride the area and help healing.  If it really sticks moisten it first to aid removal.  You can also cover the first gauze pad with vaseline and work it into gauze, the cover with more 4x4 gauze. Sometimes a few days of antibiotics also helps.  Talk to Katie or Dr. Ramineni see what they think.  What happened on the trip home that led to this.  So sorry, the pic just says major ouch and pain. Really keep the area clean .  It will begin to granulate, (look beefy red) as the wound and skin heals.  You are in my prayers.  Bridget

On arrival in Boston the wheelchair that was supposed to be there for me was not so I chose to walk to the ride share area unknowing that it was about .5 miles away. That walk so soon after surgery combined with me having to drive for one hour back home did the damage.

Remember , it will heal up just fine.  Take care of yourself.  I have a few weeks left with a penis and hate it so very very much.  You will heal and have a functional vagina very soon.   Is he going to repair something in the posterior commisure area?  The labia majora will heal by secondary intention.  Can&#39;t see the loose area you talk about well.  This is a bump in the road.  We transwomen have lots of them .  You will overcome this. Bridget

I am 11 days post op with Dr. Ramineni in DC, the trip home to New England from DC was rough and after unexpected travel issues when I finally arrived home my left labia and fourchette has split and separated.
</p>
<p>
They have started healing I just wanted to know if others had experienced similar types of wound separation and tips for healing.

Made it to DC, Dr. Ramineni took a look and decided closure of would be best since it had opened more and had opened from outside in. It was quick and easy and now I&#39;m resting at the hotel. Amazing staff there and the Dr. Himself is phenomenal.

I also had dehiscene with this surgeon. I&#39;ve had multiple surgeries at this point and this is the first time that has ever happened. I&#39;m seeing a lot of other people saying the same thing from the surgeon. It&#39;s like he&#39;s not using the correct sutures.
