First of all, sry for being 1 Day late. The train ride wasnt that good yesterday
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 8
</li>
</ul>
<p>
it all looks good healing wise and i got douched on the chair again.Im Allowed to start HRT againIf it all goes well with the catheter removing i could be released on Day 10 (turns out it wasnt all going well)Wound healing problem is also okish and healing and is bleeding on touch (which is good according to my doctors here)And one of the best things happend, my new roommate is a girl i know from Twitter for over 2 years already :3
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 9
</li>
</ul>
<p>
sleep was okish, i was kinda nervous (second hand euphoria is so real and awesome)Catheter is going to be removed and my voice was lower and i kinda screamed when the removed it, it wasnt as painful as the first one but still painful enough for me.it all looks good healing wise, despite that the problem is getting bigger (kinda good visible in the pictures)I also cant recommend drinking 1 litre of water in under an hour if you just lost your catheter, i was peeing 10 times in the hour after that, 5/10 wont recommend.But my bladder was empty (10 ml remaining) in the  sonographyAccording to the head surgeon it looks all good to get released Day 10 and then get home Day 11 (due to prices for train ride)Also i am not allowed to dilate for atleast 2 weeks after i got released, maybe just maybe i can try the 2nd Vagiwell size cause i also used the 5 LS one-
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 10
</li>
</ul>
<p>
sleep was okish again (still wanna give my roommate support)Maybe my fistula is still kinda there, so maybe i am getting a catheter again, but theyll look inside my kitty first for it.since it was an other doctor who made the daily douching (cause of the healing problems i have to get this done daily) i still had 0 clue about the catheter, but it still looks good :3the doctor from the morning visit was there again, she cant see a whole in my kitty. At this point they also couldn&#39;t really do anything against it (surgery wise). So she asked if i want a catheter again, or even an abdominal catheter. I decided against both cause they only might help if even a fistula is still there and since she also told me its nothing dangerous in this particular case, it can just be kinda annoying. If it gets worse i should come back but surgery wise they could only do something at 6 months post op.Also cause of the healing problem its adviced to stay over the weekend till Monday (Day 13)Also cause i somehow got an infection in my bladder i now am getting anitbiotics
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 11
</li>
</ul>
<p>
since pills arent working against this bacteria i got an intravenous access (hope
<a href="https://dict.cc">dict.cc</a>
is right on this one) again.shortly before i had to get to the gynecological chair again i got the first dosage IV and yeah, it wasnt as good to my body cause i hat circulatory problems after that. The doctor told me about my infection, that i have 2 types of bacteria there that shouldnt be there, one from rectum, one dangerous. Everything else looks okish, Antibiotics every 12 hours round about.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 12
</li>
</ul>
<p>
the doctors visit was with a doctor who looks insecure and tbh i didnt trusted her with the answers i got to my questions about the antibiotics.Also she was the doctor who has done the daily douching there, and it was the worst experience ever on there (this surgery). She hasnt find my vagina, entered it really strange so that everything hurted and i dont know if she also tried to douche my urethra, i 100% felt like she tried to.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 13
</li>
</ul>
<p>
ok no hot water, so no shower in the morning.Also it was really hectic today, everything done before i was even able to have my breakfast.Dr Klemenz (fist surgeon) looked at my kitty and the ex fistula and it looks really good and they used mucous from that are to fix it.Day 14 is my new release date
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 14
</li>
</ul>
<p>
ok today i will 100% get released, i already got all the letters that i need and yeah, im going back in 6 Months for the last examination.this was the last day in hospital, the train ride was like shit and we were 2 hours later at home then planned, but i am really happy to see my bf, mother in law and our cat again.But it was also the hardest good bye from a roommate i ever had, she is really cool. Thanks for the good time Maya (hope you&#39;ll read it)
</p>
<p>
Also i still have to use lavanid 4-5 times a day and the antibiotic is now as a pill till Friday (Day 17) then eveything should be better.Sex and Dilation both are only allowed once everything has healed (for me that means once i dont have visible stitches there anymore i start dilation again)Again it was the right decision to do this and i am really happy with the result even now already and the hopsital stay was really good this time. I still can only reccommend this clinic and both surgeons my first one and my second one were amazing.
</p>
<p>
As everytime if you have any questions just go ahead and ask them :3

I have now decided to go Team Markovsky for SRS. Just informed my health insurance and they will send me the letter of cost coverage! My decision to do that was also influenced by your detailed review, so thank you very much for your open minded posts here!
