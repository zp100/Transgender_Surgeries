i wouldn‚Äôt bc of some doctors saying it doesn‚Äôt dissolve and just migrates and that seems like a lot of filler to put in your body

It&#39;s a bad idea to do silicone injections.
</p>
<p>
I had this done many years ago in mexico, back when I thought I wouldn&#39;t live more than 30 years old. I was the street girl at the time.
</p>
<p>
It didn&#39;t really bother me until I was in my early 60s, but now it&#39;s as hard as a rock, and it could probably make me ill.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever value life as an old person, until I got older.

Well, that amount of hyaluronic acid is insane and it would cost way much more than the price you gave. I would not advice to do these shots

It is suspicious. It usually costs hundreds of dollars for a 1ml injection, though some of that would be labor. But if it turned out to be permanent, surely people would notice?

You can get a bbl in Turkey for that price. But make sure you go to a well known and certified plastic surgeon. My friend just got hers done but IMO her butt is too big now. Hope you find what you need üíú

I would be dubious of the quality of the filler at the prices you quoted.    Consider how incredibly expensive it is for the face in small quantities.  Also even in relatively small deposits it can migrate.  Just look at the botched sub for examples.  Imagine what could happen in large quantities.   Plus consider the prices you&#39;re quoting.  Do you really want to get on a treadmill like that if on the worst case it only lasts a year?
</p>
<p>
BBL alone yields pretty good results.  BBL+implants yields dramatic results.  You aren&#39;t likely to be disappointed.

That wasn&#39;t my experience.   I had it twice.  You are encouraged to not put weight on the grafts for about a month or as long as you&#39;re able.  Butt implants (which if I wasn&#39;t clear, is what I was referring to) will keep you from putting weight on your butt for a good month.

Ok so I‚Äôm in exactly the same situation as you girl, I have been reading through all the responses but most people are not actually reading your post properly.
</p>
<p>
So she‚Äôs not getting silicone filler it‚Äôs HA filler, I was quoted ¬£3000 for 600ml and I‚Äôm tempted to do 300ml each side.
</p>
<p>
So I have experience in this as last year got 100ml each side the results for me actually was perfect. But it didn‚Äôt last that long as I got the one that last 6months to a year as was testing the waters it cost me ¬£3500.
</p>
<p>
I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure if I wanted to transition at the time so for me it was perfect, I lasted just over a year but the main result did basically go after 6 months.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm thinking now to use another AH filler that last 2-3 years. I understand there is a risk of infection especially if you do over 150ml a go. So I might break it down into 2 sessions 150 each side.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you want to chat to me about this more as I‚Äôm in the exact same situation as very skinny and not on HRT yet!
</p>
<p>
I have before and after photos as well also if you want to go ahead maybe we can get a deal for 2 people and I actually would appreciate someone to go with me in same situation. As you need a day to recover I was thinking of booking a hotel to crash for one night then get a train home the next day. Last time I drove home from London to Southampton and it was not fun at all. My but hurt so much and your not even meant to sit really for 24 hours after the treatment.

Also I would love a BBL have an amazing man willing to help me through that and support me but it‚Äôs not really possible until next year. So this is something I‚Äôm seriously considering doing maybe before Christmas or start of January.

I got HA injections like these. There‚Äôs a few things I want to say. The results for cis and trans women are going to be different. The amount a cis woman would need might be the double of what you might need to make it look good. I got mine and it wasn‚Äôt enough to completely fill my hips and butt but enough to calm my dysphoria. I also want to say is that it‚Äôs very painful. The results only lasted for 6 months for me or less. I started to see my butt go down and I felt like shit because I paid a lot of money for it. I also had this discomfort on my left butt cheek every time I would lay on my back or sit for long periods of time. Tbh, try to invest on a bbl. Closer to price and it‚Äôll last much longer. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm think of doing.

In your post you even said you know of someone who got sick and was suppose to be hospitalized for it? The filler can easily be absorbed into the blood stream when it‚Äôs used in the body area that doesn‚Äôt have existing HA or collagen to ‚Äúmesh‚Äù into. Your best bet is to gain healthy weight and get fat transfer for body sculpting.

BBL‚Äôs are very invasive and risky as well though there are people that die so i feel like both are dangerous &amp; a bbl won‚Äôt last in anybody so im just trying to make the best decision but it seems impossible for a skinny person. gaining weight has never worked for me and when it did it doesnt last so ik just scared to get a bbl and lose everything and get left with nothing.
</p>
<p>
i know a trans girl who‚Äôs build is the same as mine and she got 2 rounds of bbl and now she‚Äôs back to the start because her body just went back to its natural skinny state so im terrified to go through all this for nothing

I got a skinny bbl, I can dm you my results, including my before where you can see I was built like a fridge lol. I‚Äôm actually getting a round 2 in a few months. A lot of people don‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs really important how you gain the weight for your bbl. Junk food and high sodium / sugar foods make fat that doesn‚Äôt last in a transfer! Bbls are invasive, yes, but they also have new medical standards for BBLS that make it so they know how to 100% make sure no fat gets injected into the blood stream.. fat embolisms used to pose the biggest threat, but now BBLs are really only not safe for people who have high BMIs and other underlying health conditions.

My first round was almost 5 years ago.. when I gain weight it goes to my ass, when I loose weight it comes from my ass.. but I‚Äôve still always maintained having curves but it does fluctuate with my weight, but never to the point where it looks like I never even got a BBL. I‚Äôll dm you.

Don&#39;t waste your time. Honestly, I&#39;ve been researching this since day 1 of my transition and and liquid filler that isn&#39;t insanely toxic is just going to dissolve and potentially cause pain and infection. Wanna know why silicone injections sometimes work? Because silicone is innate in the body and will never dissolve. Girls can walk around after getting pumped and may have good results for who knows how long, but once the silicone migrates you&#39;re essentially fucked. I&#39;ve seen photos of doctors &#34;harvesting&#34; stray liquid fillers from women&#39;s bodies; it&#39;s disturbing. I&#39;m very slim and wanted a bigger butt/hips, so my plan of attack has been to get butt implants (I went with 400cc&#39;s) and then do a fat transfer just to my hips and legs when I can afford it. It&#39;s not cheap, but my surgeon is a practical one, and he told me it&#39;s doable but even then I won&#39;t achieve a drastic look. If you manage expectations and take the time to do it right there are options. Unfortunately for me, I know I&#39;ll always be flat, but my butt has more volume and hopefully after a modest fat transfer to my hips I&#39;ll be satisfied. Also, keep in mind buttock implants are brutal to recover from, but once they&#39;re in they&#39;re in. They&#39;re solid and pretty hard, so not the most natural, but they go in the muscle and can last a lifetime. I&#39;d never have enough fat to achieve 400cc&#39;s of volume in my buttocks so I&#39;m happy with my implants.

yeah i‚Äôve considered the shots bc ultimately i‚Äôd want a silhouette figure regardless of how thin or thick i become, but ofcourse its dangerous
</p>
<p>
i have considered implants but i can‚Äôt get with it. the unnaturalness of the look, the hardness. i want a soft ass and hips with a feminine shape and i think it‚Äôs going to have to be a BBL unfortunately. i just hate the downtime of it and the amount of effort. going to another country, being hospitalized, drainage, painfull massages, not laying on ur sides, not sitting down, risk of the fat not staying, i wish it was easier. thats why i really wanted the fillers because there is no down time.

Definitely do not do shots. I understand people&#39;s hang ups with implants (they definitely feel hard), but it&#39;s the only safe and predictable way to add substantial volume to the buttocks. A BBL is great with the right surgeon. Look at other results and ask your surgeon what their fat survival rate is upon transfer. Usually up to 50% of the transfered fat can die, but some surgeons see up to 80% survival rates. But of course BBL&#39;s grow and shrink with your body. If you get a BBL and lose weight your results will shrink in proportion to the rest of your body. There&#39;s no easy answer to what you&#39;re pursuing, but I can say with confidence liquid fillers are not it
