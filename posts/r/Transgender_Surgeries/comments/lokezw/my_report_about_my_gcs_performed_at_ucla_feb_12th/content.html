Being as I have achieved this goal, I thought I should post about what I experienced to maybe help those who are going in that direction.
</p>
<p>
My surgery was performed by Dr. Gladys Ng (pronounced Ing). The most important thing to note is that the results appear to be quite amazing. I have viewed many, many of the images contained in the &#34;Great wall of Vagina&#34; and my results even noting the swelling I have could be that of any CIS woman&#39;s appearance.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Ng is not well known in this area and I didn&#39;t find a link to her in the Transgender wiki here on Reddit. Due to my age, I chose her as the waiting time was short.
</p>
<p>
I had my initial consultation on July 30, 2020, my second on September 10, 2020 and my surgery was initially scheduled for December 18. That was postponed due to the pandemic and was rescheduled for February.
</p>
<p>
In the mean time, I had four sessions of hair removal at Hair Free Beverly Hills. These sessions consist of an appointment with a doctor who&#39;s name has escaped me, he injects the entire are with lidocaine and then I would travel one mile for a four hour session of electrolysis. Alana ( the owner of the clinic) has equipment that has thirty two probes that work simultaneously. This is essentially pain free but never the less is still quite uncomfortable. Each session left me essentially hair free when I left but there is always considerable regrowth. Dr. Ng was happy with the small amount of hair I had at surgery day.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Ng is very traditional with regards to stopping hormones and such. Therefore she wanted me to stop HRT six weeks prior. Being as I am on bio-identical IM estradiol valerate and bio-identical progesterone which I take rectally, I believed I was ok and only stopped two weeks prior. I do not recommend that any person take this as advice. I did it on my own and I was willing to take the chance.
</p>
<p>
I was required to get a covid test the day before surgery. I was happily negative!
</p>
<p>
On surgery day morning, I arrived at the hospital at 5:00 AM and was admitted straight away. I was taken to the pre-op prep room was given antiseptic cloths to wash down with and iodine nasal swabs to sterilize(?) my nose. once done and in my gown, I was administered an epidural which remained in me for five days constantly providing medication, I had basically zero pain in the surgery area of my body for the duration of my stay. I was moved into the OR at about 7:30, the anesthesiologist said I&#39;m going to give you something to relax you. The next I know it was 4:30 and I am in the recovery room.
</p>
<p>
I was moved to my room about 5:30 and the remainder of that day is a blur.
</p>
<p>
There were many instances where I was concerned about my care in the hospital. Pain management is first rate there, patient comfort is significantly lacking. I was placed on a liquid diet for four days. I was also required to fast the day before going into the hospital. That was a total of five days without significant food. That alone was a big part of my discomfort in the hospital, on top of that my &#34;meals&#34; were always more than an hour late, sometimes two. &#34;Dinner&#34; would arrive sometime around six and most days &#34;breakfast&#34; was after ten. That&#39;s like sixteen hours of no food. There was no one who seemed to care, as much as I complained.
</p>
<p>
Wednesday morning, my drains, catheter and epidural were removed and I had my first dilation! It was sheer joy to experience the new sensations and where they were occurring within my body!
</p>
<p>
I was discharged on Thursday late morning, that was day seven of my stay.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s now day nine since my surgery. I have a lot of swelling and at times I am significantly uncomfortable I think, mostly due to the swelling. Dilation is not painful but not fun either. Also, of note is that I have just over six inches of depth in my neo-vagina, I am very pleased about that!!
</p>
<p>
I am very happy with where I&#39;m at now in this process. Getting here could have been a lot easier.
</p>
<p>
Please ask questions if you have an interest. Comments are welcome as well.
</p>
<p>

Thank you so very much for posting this!  I had my initial consult with Dr. Ng a few weeks ago and have been trying to find more information from actual patients of hers. I hope that at some point you’ll be willing to share a picture of your results. Thanks again, Calista.

In a few weeks I may send you a pm....not sure if I&#39;m comfy with that. You should know that your actual results have much to do with what your body has to offer in terms of anatomy as what the Dr does. I asked her for a certain shape to my labias and she said basically I do what I can with what you have. I guess I&#39;m lucky. She is very skilled but not much personality. I&#39;m ok with that as she is not out for herself.

Hey girl. I had my consult with her and yeah, like you said not much in the way of personality. But if I wanted to be entertained I’d have hired Lady Gaga to do my vag.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I have a surgery date with her now, so I wanted to know how you were healing and if you’re happy with the results so far. Thanks!

Hi, I&#39;m happy for you! So, amazingly, I&#39;m already 8 weeks out! I had my 2nd post op last week, she is pleased with where I&#39;m at. The swelling is still going down and that process is uneven so the appearance is not always perfect. I&#39;m very happy with the looks.  I&#39;ve been fortunate. Dr Ng said my body was ideal for this surgery.  Dilating is easy. Dr Ng said  i wouldn&#39;t be able to do the largest dilator as the opening in my pelvis was too small. With permission, I tried it and now it&#39;s working ok. I hope your results are as good as mine. Write to me any time Nikki

I appreciate that.  I&#39;m mostly just trying to get an idea of her aesthetic results - even knowing that everyone is different.

Bring a stash of healthy foods for your recommended type of diet (info from your surgeon) to keep with your personal effects, waiting for you after you come out of surgery.
</p>
<p>
Divergent surgeries have different dietary limits, like penile inversion often not having the same diet limits as peritoneal pull-through, but you can&#39;t &#34;bear down&#34; nor &#34;push/strain&#34; to have a bowel movement with either for a long while after surgery, and longer if you had a graft from your intestine to your peritoneal surgical site.
</p>
<p>
Ask your surgeon to give you advanced notice of recovery diet parameters so you can purchase things in adequate time beforehand.

My doctor put me on a liquid diet. That&#39;s what I did. I happen to agree with her even though it was tough to do. This surgery touches the colon, the uretha and other important things down there.
</p>
<p>
The reason, I think, for the liquid diet is to not add the stress of moving solids through the digestive tract while it recovers from the shock of the surgical injuries, When I was allowed to eat, it was still traumatic for my digestive system and for me as it was painful to eventually move my bowels.
</p>
<p>
I have to disagree with your line of thought here.

Hi, Really sorry I take so long to reply. I haven&#39;t been here a lot since my surgery. The electrolysis is not covered by Medicare.  I am now four months post op, Medicare still has not paid for my surgery yet. Leo, Dr Ng&#39;s assistant , has told me that Medicare will always deny the initial claim then the doctor appeals that, submits the letters and then they pay. I sincerely hope so as I received a notice of the decision and it said I may be billed $146,000. Anyway, the electrolysis cost a total of a bit more than $4000. Once Medicare pays, I submit a claim for the electrolysis as it is required for the surgery.  I have been told that Medical does cover it. I don&#39;t know about private insurance.

Hi, Sorry for the late reply I just haven&#39;t been looking in here very often. Yes she does require electrolysis. I got mine done through a studio called Beverly Hills Electrolysis where the technician has a device that has 32 probes. When I would make my appointment they would make me an appointment at a doctor&#39;s office about a half mile away and he would inject the entire area with lidocaine. Each session was 4 hours and I had to do this four times but there was never any pain. It cost about $1000 for each visit.

Was your electrolysis covered by insurance? If so, what insurance do you have? If not, what did the sessions cost? I’m having the surgery with her also, I hear she can still get patients in rather soon and I don’t want the hair to be the reason I am slowed down.

Hi,
</p>
<p>
The clinic that did my hair removal is &#34;Hair Free Beverly Hills&#34; The clinician&#39;s name is Alana.
</p>
<p>
Hair removal is not covered by Medicare but I think Medicaid does cover it. Once Medicare pays for my surgery I will submit for payment for the hair removal since it is required for the surgery.

I had a consult with Dr. Ng today. Thanks to everyone here who posted about their experiences. I wouldn&#39;t have found Dr. Ng otherwise, and I have a lot of confidence in her. I&#39;m just waiting for her scheduling folks to call so I can get scheduled now (^_^)

Hi, While I&#39;m not really uncomfortable with sharing photos, I think it may  not be right to show as I am in my 70&#39;s and age does make a difference.  I am very, very happy with my results. All my parts work very well, I orgasm easily from both my clitoris and vagina. As it happens, I saw her Thursday, January 21st so she could look for a reason why I have had some bleeding from near my clitoris or urethra when having sex. She saw no reason for that, she said I have healed beautifully. We noted 2 areas where there is some fat deposits (I am very thin) and she asked if I wanted a revision which I agreed to. I would do it again with her.
