<p>
I went with Dr Ramineni primarily because he 1) could get me in quickly (initial phone call to surgery was only like 2.5 months), 2) he didn&#39;t require hair removal, and 3) an acquaintance had hers done by him and was very pleased. The hair wouldn&#39;t have been a huge deal, but my first choice in surgeon was Dr Selph, who also didn&#39;t require removal. When he moved locations and couldn&#39;t get operating privileges, I couldn&#39;t mentally afford to take that much of a backwards step when finding a new doctor.
</p>
<p>
Initial surgery: the pre op staff at GW hospital were very kind. The anesthesiologist who put in the epidural was amazing. I met Dr Ramineni for the first time there, and while he was very warm, not having any in person pre op appointments, in hindsight, should have given me pause. Propofol is a helluva drug and I wake up to intense pain, unfortunately a harbinger of things to come.  When I&#39;m transferred up to the recovery floor, my experiences with the staff changes sharply. The nurses were aloof at best and incredibly neglectful. Those few days were quite simply awful. Also ... that little warning of &#34;there may be some swelling&#34; ... JFC, that was an understatement. When the pressure bandage came off, it was like a beach ball had been inflated in my crotch. It was almost comical. Almost. The physical therapy tech that got me walking again was awesome, and the food was legit good, but when I finally left, my sanity had definitely frayed a little from the nursing staff.
</p>
<p>
Initial recovery: Ever seen &#34;A Knights Tale&#34;? Remember Alan Tudyk&#39;s character yelling &#34;PAIN, LOTS OF PAIN!&#34; Yeah. That. Between the extreme swelling and what I&#39;m pretty confident was an under dosing of narcotics, it was all pain. When the catheter came out, learning how to pee again was .. interesting. When it came time for the 15 hour drive home, I was already out of pain meds. Had to find some thc and flexoril to make me ptfo. Thc gummies were the only thing that kept pain manageable when I got home. Dilation was what it was and everything was gross and oozey. Things sucked, but they were a little better each day.
</p>
<p>
Initial complications: A little past the one month mark, things really felt like they were turning a corner. Then I woke up feeling a little under the weather one day. What started as &#34;a little blah&#34; rapidly decompensated. I had an unrelated medical appointment that day, and the provider told me that I looked like shit (nicely) and that I should go to the ER. I do as advised and think that I might just stay overnight and get some fluids. I was VERY wrong. I wound up receiving some fairly nuclear antibiotics and underwent emergency exploratory surgery. It turns out that my clitoris had gone necrotic and it and some surrounding tissue had to be removed. I did NOT take that well, but I was also pretty close to septic shock, so at least I was alive. I wound up being hospitalized for 18 days. To add injury to injury, the antibiotics severely damaged my kidneys. I was forced onto dialysis for two months while they recovered. My five week recovery had turned into 4 months.
</p>
<p>
Infection part 2: Just as I&#39;m about to head back to work, I feel a little off again. I am understandably paranoid about infection and head to the ER again. I wind up in the hospital for another week. I am adamant with the doctors about using less aggressive antibiotics and to monitor my kidneys closely. Physical crisis averted, but the entire stay was very triggering from all the trauma of round one.
</p>
<p>
Life goes on: I get back to work, and the world keeps turning. I am trying to reconcile not having a clitoris and start looking for solutions. I haven&#39;t seemed to lose much depth at this point but it has been impossible to move up from the purple dilator and even that is getting tough. I am also developing some issues urinating. I communicate with Dr Ramineni and he talks about some easy fixes and doesn&#39;t indicate that there is any hurry with anything. I am a little gun-shy regarding surgery so I just try to live a little bit. A dear friend had been working with the Crane Center and indicated that there might be a real fix for my clit. I start reaching out to them.
</p>
<p>
New years: Urination is getting steadily more difficult. I&#39;m getting a little worried, but there are good days too, so maybe it&#39;s just swelling or uti or something. One weekend in Feb I get home and my pads are soaked in blood. Not light spotting. Soaked. Fuck. Things have gone from being difficult to urinate to impossible. Not good. Reeeeeely bad.
</p>
<p>
Hospital, round 3: I head to the ER, again, and tell them that I can&#39;t pee. I know that this is going to be a race between getting relief of some kind and excruciating pain. They show all the speed and care of snail on thorazine and are convinced that I just need a Foley. I tell them that my anatomy is weird and that it&#39;s not going to work. Spoiler, I&#39;m right. They try the catheter and get imaging as my pain is ramping up. I don&#39;t know if I have experienced real 10/10 pain before, but if I have, that was it. They tell me that they will need to put in a supra pubic catheter while they figure out how to fix me. They really don&#39;t know what to do with me and only discharge me after a week because I had been consulting with other surgeons who actually understood post op trans anatomy.
</p>
<p>
The Crane Center: while I had initially been consulting with them about clitoral reconstruction, I had also mentioned the urinary issues. The initial guess was scar tissue. They seemed to think that everything could be knocked out in one surgery. There was a plan to harvest a nerve cluster in my wrist and kinda do basically a mini phalloplasty to repair my clitoris. The surgeon has me drive out to Austin to have a detailed exam. Things are worse than believed. There are vaginal issues too. Looks like it&#39;s going to be 2 surgeries now. One to fix urethra/vagina and one for the clit. Their urology guy gets brought on to the case. He needs an exam under anesthesia to assess things. Understandable but ... ugh.
</p>
<p>
So my follow up consult was a couple days ago. It&#39;s now going to be a total of 4 surgeries.  The exam under anesthesia (completed), a simple-ish procedure to reroute my urethra, a near complete re-do of the interior aspects of my vaginoplasty, and then finally the clitoroplasty. It turns out the distal end of my urethra was completely destroyed and what&#39;s left is going to have to be rerouted to where I pee out of my vagina.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been dealing with a s/p tube for a couple months now and it will be another 37 days before that issue gets fixed. Hopefully the vaginal revision can happen within a few months after that. Going to have to travel to San Francisco for that one though. Getting the s/p tube out will be a huge quality life improvement, but I&#39;m also looking forward to being able to accommodate something bigger than a finger.
</p>
<p>
Not sure the point of this ramble. Guess I just needed to scream into the abyss. The good news is that my bottom dysphoria is gone. The bad news is that my mental health is a dumpster fire and I have come very close to becoming a statistic. I&#39;m fighting like hell not to, but I&#39;m so exhausted. Having a date for the urinary fix helps a lot. Crying a bit while I write this, so hopefully the spelling and syntax isn&#39;t too bad.
</p>
<p>
I got this. Maybe. Hopefully.

Omg it sounds like you have been through hell. I thought mine was bad with Bellringer but at least I can pee properly :o
</p>
<p>
I can sympathise with your pain issues.  Two years out from SRS and I am still on a cocktail of pain and antidepressants medication. Pregabalin for what my GP thought was neuropathic pain but it&#39;s looking more like the spermatic cord was not cut correctly (another surgeon confirmed that&#39;s the case). Mirtazapine for severe clinical depression and sleep. The most recent visit got me upgraded to MST / slow release morphine and Naproxen. I&#39;m still in pain but I&#39;m able to manage it.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately if you don&#39;t deal with acute pain and it becomes chronic you can have long term changes to your central nervous system. My GP explained it as if my CNS has become so accustomed to pain it amplifiers everything. Even if the pain should be minor and a normal person can just ignore it im in agony. I confirmed this after my hair transplant last month. The. FUT scar is still very painful, when normal people are gong about their day im stuck a pain spiral on top of my groin pain.
</p>
<p>
I really hope you can get your pain under control and get back to some semblance of normality. Good luck on your surgeries to get it fixed.
</p>
<p>
Huge hugs x
</p>
<p>
Edit to add. I would really like to know how your clit replacement works as well, mine is useless.

The pain from surgery resolved, fortunately. I have mild chronic pain from other things, though, so you definitely have my sympathy. The clitoroplasty is probably a year out, at least, at this point.

Thanks. I&#39;m not sure strong is accurate, though. I generally describe my psyche as  shattered safety glass. Broken and useless but held together by that thin film of unhealthy coping mechanisms. In my early transition, I looked at my decision to attend one of the toughest military schools in the country as a mistake and denial mechanism. I&#39;m probably alive now because of it though.

I used the word strong because I can only imagine the toll this would have on someone&#39;s mind and despite all that you did not give in and eventually found what seems to be the beginning of a solution and you even got a date for the urinary situation to be fixed. That to me reads as immense strength and perseverance and although you may have unhealthy coping mechanisms (which really is understandable) you&#39;re at least aware of it and I am sure once this situation starts to be resolved you will work at becoming better and healthier in every regard. Wish you the best on your journey!

How much pain did you have the first few days post op? Wonder if it is an early sign of something being wrong.
</p>
<p>
had this surgery with Dr. Ramineni in the 14th and pain had been a pretty constant 2-3 so I don’t even need to use the oxy pain med unless I plan on walking a bit more than usual in the house for small tasks.

It wasn&#39;t bad in the hospital due to the epidural. Other than the weird pain spike when I woke up it never really got past a 4.
</p>
<p>
The first week or so was a pretty constant 4-5 with the narcotics barely helping. The swelling was also terrible to a degree that is impossible to really convey.

I&#39;m so sorry to hear all of that🫂
</p>
<p>
I went to Ramineni in August, I had some minor complications and am hoping to have my revision with either Corral or schecter to address depth stuff and some external stuff.
</p>
<p>
Ramineni is a good man and from a lot of other accounts he does try to put his best foot forward for us, so it&#39;s sad to hear when things don&#39;t go as planned.
</p>
<p>
Glad to hear you are on a corrective course and please stay strong 🫂
</p>
<p>
On a side note, the nursing at GWH are totally clueless so I second that one 💯

I truly believe that Ramineni is kind. His acknowledgment that getting surgery resolved quickly is a positive to mental health is solid too. I just question if he is actually good or if the no physical exam is wise. My current surgeons mentioned of hearing about other serious complications recently and I know of a blatant mistake he made with a friend of mine.

Personally I&#39;m not sure what a physical consultation would add. Like I 100% understand in the case of revisions or if a surgeon did PPT or sigmoid then yeah. Like in my case I had a picket knife instead of a sword, so I wasn&#39;t a great candidate for inversion, but seeing as he only does the one method, that fact wouldn&#39;t have changed anything.
</p>
<p>
Like seeing as I&#39;m looking for a revision the doctors I&#39;m seeing, yeah they need to be in person.

Really sorry to hear about your troubles after the surgery. I had a zero depth (another surgeon) and could barely walk for a month.  I had a wound opening and some tissue dieback around my clit area and I found that using what was called a “hospital grade wound care gel” seem s to help get things starting to heal over. We also tried medical grade honey. I don’t think the area was infected, but it took a while to close up. The clitorus did remain somewhat there after the initial dead part was removed and is has as least some feeling. I think that using the wound care gel right away as soon as I got home would have been much better than using drugstore antibiotic ointments. What type of antibiotic smookum were you using at the time the area was infected?

Didn&#39;t know there was an infection until I went to the hospital. The necrosis was internal. I had sent pictures to my surgeon because of the swelling and just got &#34;yup normal&#34;.

I hate that you’ve had to go through all this and it’s hard to imagine managing all the other aspects of life while you’re facing all these challenges too. Thank you for sharing your story with us - I’ve had my teleconference with him and I’m scheduled for January with Dr. Ramineni based on a recc from my primary care doctor who works with many trans women and has seen positive results of his firsthand. At any rate, just reading up on other girls’ accounts now to make sure I’m going into this with all the info I can find. 💗 wishing you the best on your revisions.

My GP told me she would support anyone in our local area for my surgery except him.

I am truly sorry for what you have been through I can&#39;t even begin to imagine how it must have been. I will be honest seeing things like this scares me to no end. I currently have surgery scheduled with him here in a few months and picked him because of the no bmi limit but at this point I just am scared. He did seem really nice on the phone and was quick to answer questions I have till July to cancel I think before I have to pay the cancellation fee.

Had this surgery a week ago with him, currently all going well, packing annd catheter was removed yesterday and was able to go to the bathroom albeit with some difficulty at start but now it’s all good. and I am 39 bmi and I know he has worked on even higher bmi patients.
</p>
<p>
the truth is, recovery depends on the person, been doing quite well though I always was able to heal quickly in general and didn’t have any chronic medical issues.
</p>
<p>
Honestly the biggest complaints I’ve found about ramineni was that he might be quick on checks or might miss signs of issues, though keep in mind it can be hard to diagnose serious issues based on simply photos and descriptions, especially when photos show typical post op symptoms.
</p>
<p>
A great thing about him is that he will answer emails within a few hours usually so I am able to shoot questions at him any time I require or worried about something.
</p>
<p>
btw the ‘poor results’ from higher bmi is just a common thing mentioned by surgeons that say anything about 30 makes it hard to get clear target aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
But honestly, if that is something important to you, your priority is not perfect aesthetics, Ramineni does 6 of those surgeries a week, has hundreds under his belt and has experience with people who have a lot more than in that area, something 95% of surgeons don’t have so I still consider him the best choice.
</p>
<p>
Low chance or Complications always exists with any doctor, his are very low considering the amount of surgeries he is doing.

If you have surgery with a very high bmi you’re more likely to have complications and a poor result.
</p>
<p>
Also safety issues, but I’m not sure many of use care about that.

Honestly I do have a higher bmi I have worked on losing weight for years and its a constant battle and at this point I am just wanting to be happy and move on with my life. As for the poor results and complications from higher bmi I would like to find the info on that.

The complications are due to fat having poor blood flow. Its a standard thing in surgery.
</p>
<p>
Not sure its useful, but there&#39;s a wiki page on this.

I had srs with him 2 years ago.  I am very happy with the result.  An advantage to meeting him prior is to have him explain things and answer questions. You establish more of a doctor patient relationship. I did a telehealth consult first and then in person the day prior to surgery.  I had a small dehiscense post op.  It healed well.  I did have urosepsis from the catheter and was rehospitalized a week after surgery for 2 days.  It is a risk and no one&#39;s fault.   At gwu the nurses and appropriate courtesy and care was there.  I had a horrible nurse in the pacu when I woke up initially,  he just gave tylenol and tramadol for pain.  I felt like I was being burned alive until he took a break and another nurse covered.   She immediately gave me dilaudid and the pain subsided.  My pain control with the epidural,  celebex, and oxycodone from then on worked very well.  By the time I went home tylenol   aleve, rest, and ice packs took care of the pain.  I returned to work early after 4.5 weeks. Charlie

He is definitely kind and caring. I can&#39;t fault that at all. I&#39;m just now questioning if he is good. By the end of the year, I&#39;m going to have to have a complete redo of the interior aspects of the vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, pacu was where my pain was off the charts. On the recovery floor, pain management was the only thing the nurses did right. They were terrible otherwise. I was almost in a state of constant anxiety attack by the time I was discharged.
