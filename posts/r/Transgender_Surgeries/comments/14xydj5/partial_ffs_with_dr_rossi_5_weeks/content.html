was your starting point much different?
<br>
because as other posted have said, it looks more like the before&#39;s of FFS rather than the afters. I am sorry OP, I think the surgeon massively underdelivered here

No it wasn&#39;t that much different. I felt rather underwhelmed even days after the surgery. Like confused about what they actually did and why so little

I think you have every right to feel that, if you are up for another surgery somewhere in the future it&#39;s worth getting a CT and consulting with another surgeon on potential options

I&#39;m really curious to see the starting point. I had type 3(plus other stuff) with rossi and the results were drastically different. Usually people do use makeup, have tidy eyebrows, etc for post op pics but i agree still doesn&#39;t look like much was done.
</p>
<p>
Usually I&#39;d point out how even average surgery before and afters get little attention compared to the good results that imo make ppl think ffs is magic, but this just doesn&#39;t seem right

Very slightly smaller. The images I sent aren&#39;t taken from same angles either. And not same cameras
</p>
<p>
Yes it really surprised me because they removed a very tiny part of the trachea. And decided to make the incision in a very visible location for some reason

To be honest, if you told me these were before pics I would not have questioned it. To me you still look masculine but the hair, shirt and facial hair contributes. Not knowing what you looked like before I can’t say whether he did as well as he could have or not.

IDK what your nose looked like before but it looks good now.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m surprised that the trach incision is directly on the neck though. That&#39;s an outdated incision point and good for people to know that Dr. Rossi does that.

He told me the incision would be under the chin before surgery. I was surprised about that to.
</p>
<p>
Maybe it had something to do with safety of the throat?

Thanks for the comment on the nose although it looks rather similar to before lol

That sounds too complicated for me :P Plus I have no proof to back it up

Honestly, I didn&#39;t even see Rossi in the operating room when I entered it. I saw about 4-5 surgeons who greeted me but not Rossi

I had a partial FFS with Dr Rossi 5 weeks ago. I am just posting this so people curious may know what sort of results to expect. I had Forehead Reconstruction Type 3 + Nose + Trachea.
</p>
<p>
I am not gonna say anything else to remain impartial so you can decide for yourself

Images taken with my webcam in sunlight from outside. Because my face look more like when I look myself in the mirror with my webcam, rather than taking images with my phone. The light may make it look a bit better

I am confused and I feel sorry for you but it doesn&#39;t look like a type 3 forehead reconstruction.  I don&#39;t even see any difference on your nose too :/ You should save up your money and go to a recognized ffs expert and also try to get your money back from this scammer.

Yep I feel the same way. I&#39;ll have to do that. Although not possible to get money back per agreements.
</p>
<p>
Ironically they hand you an agreement 5min before surgery stating all the bad things that could happen after surgery, like death etc. I personally think that is unprofessional and should be done long before payment. The assistant was even annoyed that I thoroughly read it through, and said most people take 3 minutes to read it through, but apparently I took 15 minutes according to them then she suggested I probably have ADD lol..

People should stay away from Rossi, had a full ffs with him 5 months ago and he did a horrendous job that I now have to live with.
</p>
<p>
Comparing his work from a couple of years ago to his more recent work and I&#39;m convinced that he just offloads the surgery onto his team. Either he&#39;s gotten lazy or he&#39;s become incompetent.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m gonna try to make a post at my 6 month mark with my experience and results but I just feel so defeated and unmotivated ever since my surgey.
</p>
<p>
Please avoid Rossi, go to a different surgeon like Cardenas or Facial Team, idk.

It&#39;s unfortunate that you needed to delete the post, it would have been good if it was added to the wiki so that people are informed when making their decision, but I do fully understand.

I don&#39;t wanna upload my own either but I&#39;ll have to eventually, people need to know.
