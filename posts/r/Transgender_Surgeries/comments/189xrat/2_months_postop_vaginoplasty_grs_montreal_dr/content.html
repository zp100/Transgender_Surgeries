Well, not much from me other than to say wow! Looks amazing.
</p>
<p>
Is that the urethra just below the clit? Peeing ok and all the usual stuff? Penile inversion?

Thanks! Yes, this is penile inversion. Peeing is fine, still spraying in a random direction half the time but that should improve as the swelling keeps going down ü§û

Goodness I literally spray now because I was in a logging accident in 2015 that crushed me and I lost use of it and spay like a skunk. Lol.  I had my consultation last month and my Dr plans on ppv  robotic and told me that the crushed part of every I have would be removed and everything become normal.  I hope so. At least I have had the setting or even squatting to pee outside practice for a lot of years now. I never know where I&#39;m going to pee at until it hits and I have to compensate.  Lol you definitely don&#39;t want to be standing close. ü§£
</p>
<p>
Congratulations girlfriend I&#39;m so happy everything is working out for you and you managed to get your big O. That had to be a relief just to no it was still gonna happen.  I have trouble as it is now and I will consider myself extremely lucky if I can pull it off but I will be ok if I can&#39;t.  I&#39;ve gotten use to it and being single for so many years already.  I&#39;m starting to get excited.
<br>
Looks fabulous.

On average, the third dot sits right at my entrance when I dilate. According to my ruler that&#39;s 4.5 inches, pretty average I think

I wonder what you were wearing on your way back from grs?  They gave suggestions in the booklet for skirts and dresses, but it&#39;s gonna be the middle of winter when I go, and i won&#39;t survive in a skirt in those conditions obv, and beside leggings etc I don&#39;t think I have anything warm enough that qualifies as loose.  That&#39;s my dilemma at the moment.
</p>
<p>
Did you do epidural?  Do they give you something to knock you out or they keep you awake while they&#39;re at it?

I got some loose fitting men&#39;s sweatpants to wear just for travelling. I considered getting some woolen stockings to wear under a dress but sweats were easier to find.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I was fully sedated. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s standard procedure unless there&#39;s a medical reason not to. I&#39;ve written about my surgery and GRS on my profile if that&#39;s helpful. Best of luck when the time comes!

That was a good question to ask, I am travelling from Winnipeg to Montreal and back in January and is always cold here at that time of year.  Helps me figure out what to wear.

Wow, I am about to send my papers at GRS. When do you think I can expect to have the surgery? GRS is next. Just had BBL 5 days ago üòÆ‚Äçüí® So glad to see your results and that you are happy ‚ò∫Ô∏èü´∂

I sent my application in April, had some back-and-forth over documents in May, and was given my date in late June. They offered me August but I chose to delay until October. I was very surprised by how soon it all happened once I had all my referals and everything.
</p>
<p>
Good luck on recovery, your BBL looks great üëç

Wow that seems quick based on what I&#39;m hearing. I&#39;m about to send in my papers too but the timing makes me a bit anxious.  What province are you in? I&#39;m guessing one that already has pre-approval.

Yes, I still had to get my 2 referal letters and provincial funding before talking with GRS. That was another few months of mostly waiting, but altogether the process took 10 months for me. Obviously YMMV but the pacing certainly made me a little anxious at times.
</p>
<p>
My advice would be to make your way through the process until they call you to set a surgery date, and then you can decide how long you need to prepare and choose a date that really works for you. After surgery, recovery and dilation will become your entire life for months, so you really want to clear your schedule and be ready for it :)

So you did no electrolysis nor lhr. Do you have inner hair.  If it goes as fast for me as for you, I won‚Äôt have time to do proper electrolysis.  Do you have any unwanted in ternal hair?

This is a quote from the info booklets I received from GRS:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Laser hair removal or electrolysis of the genitals is not mandatory prior to surgery.  However, if you decide to opt for these treatments, they must be stopped at least three months before surgery because the remaining hair must be visible in order to be cauterized during surgery.&#34;
</p>
<p>
They cauterise the skin during surgery so hairs inside the cavity shouldn&#39;t be an issue, but it&#39;s still a possible complication they warn you about. I haven&#39;t noticed any yet but I still haven&#39;t fully explored my cavity yet.

I have questions about the planning process. Do they just tell you what they&#39;ll do or do they work out a plan on how things will go? Like for me I want to see if I can keep the entire head as a clit instead of only a small piece.

I don&#39;t remember being asked at GRS, but I didn&#39;t have any special requests so I just got what I got. I was in plenty contact pre-op (emails and a video conference) or your refering doctor might know what they can do, so I&#39;d say there&#39;s time to discuss specifics and see if they can accomodate you.
