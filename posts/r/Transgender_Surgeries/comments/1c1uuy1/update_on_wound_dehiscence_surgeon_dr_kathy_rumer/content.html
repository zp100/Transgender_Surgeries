Retired nurse here:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Please go to an ER. Please. I&#39;m concerned about blood supply here. I&#39;m concerned about a whole bunch of things, but especially about blood supply, infection, and how much microsurgery is going to recover. You need an emergency consult like right now.  Like don&#39;t even turn off the computer. Just go please.

My pcp said there are no signs of infection. I&#39;ve been putting neosporin on all of it since my first day out of the hospital.  I don&#39;t know how to get an emergency consult and I&#39;m worried that if i do go to a hospital it could void any responsibility Rumer has in my care.

She did this to you and I’m sure there is plenty of documentation of that. Go to the ER, you absolutely have to go to the ER. Worry about that butcher later.

I second this.  That is not something you should treat at home.  And even if you didn&#39;t have an infection when you talked to someone you probably do now, unless they gave you broad spectrum antibiotics.  Even then, go to the hospital!

I missed the part where you didn&#39;t know how to get an emergency consult. Then reddit ate my post.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Go to the ER admissions desk. Tell them you&#39;re trans, and you&#39;re recovering from bottom surgery and think you have an emergency. Show them the picture on your phone. Tell them you can&#39;t sit comfortably, ask for a gurney.  They will send you a triage nurse (if triage isn&#39;t there/overheard already). The triage nurse is going to ask you some questions. Insist that you&#39;re in pain and that this is an emergency, even if they push back. (don&#39;t get me started on how much triage sucks as a job from both sides). Your triage nurse will get you into an exam room as soon as they&#39;re able, with the help of an orderly to move you around if necessary, and will line up getting you that initial consult.
</p>
<p>
Level absolutely and completely with the attending physician. COMPLETELY. Don&#39;t hold anything back. This isn&#39;t their wheel house as it were, give them enough to get you bumped up the food chain, but don&#39;t lie to them either.

This is an all-night process, sorry. It sucks. But you MUST do it.  There&#39;s stuff coming in like gun shot wounds, attempted suicides, ODs, etc that have to triage higher than you. That doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not every bit as important! You are! And then some! ... it&#39;s just how likely you are to crash in the hallway versus the tweaker that just rolled in from the bank of an ambulance.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
If you have good insurance, you COULD call an ambulance for this, and go in that way. Tell them you can&#39;t sit down to drive in. That&#39;s totally up to you. Just as long as you go. In many institutions taking the bus ride into the ER may get you higher up the triage list. YMMV.

Neosporin is very much
<strong>
<em>
not
</em>
</strong>
the right choice for deep wounds and long-term care.. I wouldn&#39;t even use it on my totally ok FFS incision.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
Please get ye to the ER!

</strong>
</p>
<p>
No, you&#39;re not going to &#34;void&#34; any duty-of-care that the criminal has, promise! That&#39;s not at all how duty-of-care works in medicine.
</p>
<p>
At the ER, they are going to assess and treat the immediate emergency condition, get you stable, bring in a specialist/surgeon to look at that wound and see if they can stabilize it long enough for your &#34;surgeon&#34; to get involved, and they&#39;re going to document that butchery, which is also really important for your later claims.
</p>
<p>
We as trans people let ourselves get pushed around. Sometimes it kills us. Please go to the hospital.
</p>
<p>
*I* would go to the hospital. I&#39;m well trained and well equipped for emergencies... and you wouldn&#39;t find me anywhere but the hospital. If I were near the hospital my surgeon was tied to, I&#39;d go to that one. Otherwise, for something like that, the nearest top-level trauma center would be my choice.  Almost 25 years, much of that as a flight nurse and ENP. Emergencies are my thing. And you would find me expediting my butt to the trauma center. ... no joke, no overstatement. This is a higher level of care than I could every possibly hope to deliver outside a trauma center...
</p>
<p>
Please go.  [This is me first giving you permission: &#34;You need to go&#34;, and now begging: &#34;Please go.&#34;]

Yup, there&#39;s a duty of care. Just like my language is being chosen not to establish any misguided notions. When that &#34;surgeon&#34; got her on the table, everyone in the room grew a duty of care automagically.
</p>
<p>
This duty is moral, ethical, AND legal in this country. How this &#34;surgeon&#34; is still existing is an embarrassment.

I think the only possible advice any of us could give is to go to the Emergency Room. I&#39;ve never seen wound dehiscence like this before. It is likely too severe to leave alone to await consult with a different SRS surgeon, and Rumer clearly won&#39;t do anything. It needs attention.

Please go to the hospital, I don&#39;t want to panic you but this looks like something that should be seen to urgently -as in right away. I will say that besides the dehiscence it looks pretty good and you are an absolute trooper for keeping up with your dilations but i feel like that might only cause further seperation and moisture which may cause or contribute to infection; from my experience it is important to keep the stitches as dry as possible. I would even be very reserved with applying antibiotic ointment (polysporin) on stitches and use a minimal film if any but at this point you need immediate guidance on how to safely deal with this by a medical professional which I am not.
</p>
<p>
I am praying for you

I just completed my last dilation session of the day (started using green cause they told me to) and I saw something strange as I pulled out the dilator. So I gently inserted my finger into the vaginal opening. I pushed very gently towards one of the wounds, to my surprise there was no wall there.  When I called Kathy she told me promogram would seal it up .

Someone else commented &#34;Please go to Mass General Hospital or Boston Medical Center, both there trans healthcare teams and surgeons are fantastic and would be able to help.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Please go to the hospital right away, I would even say you should call an ambulance to take you there so you can lie down for the drive.

Girl She is supposed to seal this up.  OMG I hate this has happened to you and it&#39;s just what I didn&#39;t need to see just 11 days before my surgery.  But when I seen the Dr&#39;s name I already knew this wasn&#39;t going to be a good post but I clicked it anyway to see.
</p>
<p>
This is 100% Dr. Rumor and her neglect.
<br>
There&#39;s plenty of research on her and her horrible after care.
</p>
<p>
To be cold honest here you won&#39;t be better off voiding her.
</p>
<p>
She is going to tell you everything is fine for this do that. She&#39;ll say everything but what she needs to like omg that&#39;s not good come in asap.
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;ve based what I&#39;ve said solely on the research I have done on her. And that girl who works for her that calls everyone including me,  she&#39;s just as guilty.
<br>
I can&#39;t remember her name Melissa maybe  anyway she&#39;s the one that draws us in. I did have a consultation scheduled at one time for a brief moment and then I started finding out the truth about Dr. Kathy Rumor.  There&#39;s more bad than good.  And I understand times can become desperate,  they were for me also.  I finally was accepted at the cleaveland clinic and it&#39;s still hasn&#39;t been a walk in the park but at least these people do honest care for others (me) and as a multi state resident they have worked hard with and for me to scheduled things for me with me having to fly in/out for visits a lot of the time.
</p>
<p>
Anyway nothing I&#39;ve said can really help you now and I&#39;m so sorry.  I wish you could just find someone else who can get you fixed up to where you feel safe.  I hope bye the time you read my comment you&#39;ve already went to an ER. Please Go if you haven&#39;t.  This is only going to get worse.
</p>
<p>
I no your scared and things are not looking good at the moment but do the right thing and seek more help and try to maintain your depth.
</p>
<p>
Big hugs and prayers 🙏  Emily 🤗

I hope your surgery goes well. Thank you for your support. We are going to the Boston Childrens Hospital. The surgeon said she will see us right away and then help us make a game plan from there.

Edit: Dawn Terri and Gina were the ones I was in contact with at rumer&#39;s clinic

I saw my primary care physician. He said it&#39;s not infected. I&#39;ve been putting neosporin on it and packing it with promogram. I cant go to the ER cause no one will drive me and I&#39;m full of pain killers. Im in a really dark place right now and I have no clue what to do

Hey deep breaths.  This is a scary time, I know,  but there are ways to handle this.  I’m a gender affirming surgery caregiver and have seen a lot of wound dehiscence before.  And I just wanna share some thoughts with you.
</p>
<p>
First off- I’d stop the neosporin asap. Neosporin specifically has ingredients that speed up the dissolving of sutures.  Bacitracin or polysporin is fine though.   But honestly- this wound needs to dry out.
</p>
<p>
Secondly- do you have anyone in your life you can call for a chat? You need some support right now to get thru this next phase of healing. Even if it’s just a kind voice to help you feel more at ease. Seeing our bodies like this is so stressful!
</p>
<p>
Third- if you don’t have anyone, can you take a Lyft/Uber to the hospital?  If you can’t get there tonight- it would be good to get another medical professional to take a look at this tomorrow and tell you some options.  At the very least you really need to be seeing a wound care specialist to help you with a protocol to get this healed.
</p>
<p>
I agree with your pcp that this doesn’t look infected.  Also it’s often hard to stitch back together wound dehiscence so the best plan of action might be just dedicated wound care as it heals from the inside out.
</p>
<p>
But above all- listen to your intuition and get some help to address this asap so you can start to heal.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to pm me if you have any questions or just to vent.

This is beyond dehiscence .  I&#39;m not qualified to sit here and make some armchair diagnosis. But the color, condition of the skin, nature of the opening, ... I have serious concerns for you.  I wouldn&#39;t call a hospital and suggest dehiscence, that&#39;s making a self diagnosis that may downplay far more serious stuff lurking.

it is TOTALLY FINE to take a ride in the ambulance with the cute medic. Please go do that. now is good. You don&#39;t need to drive yourself, this is why we have EMTs, Paramedics, and ambulances!

I am a physician: please go to the ED. That wound needs care. Do not take this lightly. Yes, it is important that you continue to dilate. But you also need to take care of the wound. That is not a simple dehiscence.

Thank you! That is PRECISELY what I&#39;ve been jumping up and down about.  This is a

ambulance ride to the ED, and tell triage you can&#39;t sit down for pain. The coloration of that skin, and how it&#39;s sloughing? [shiver] Don&#39;t like.  I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s even good supply in a lot of that tissue.  That&#39;s like the definition of &#34;emergency&#34; if I&#39;m in triage.

Go to the emergency room RIGHT NOW. Do not listen to anything she tells you. Dr. Rumer should not have a medical license at this point, she has ruined multiple transfeminine people’s sex lives. I wish you the best but PLEASE do not go back to her because she will not help you. The ER will be able to close your wounds way better than she would. I am so sorry this happened to you, this is horrible.

I sincerely doubt she is performing 200-250 SRS surgeries a year. I looked at her as she was local to me but her resume didn’t add up. There were just too many disparate things on there she a consistent skill set. Started with fine arts and math? Became an engineer. Worked in shuttle fight missions as an engineer? Those all sound like a list of specialties - not consistent with dropping everything and then becoming a medical doctor with surgery experience and a specialty in SRS. She wasn’t even listed as a flight surgeon like some others have been.
</p>
<p>
Anyway - get IMMEDIATE medical treatment for this. Medical issues don’t wait. If you go to the ER they will help at least stabilize your situation. What has the input from Rumer been in this so far? It didn’t get like this in one day. Start writing down the contact points you made and Rumer’s response, you’re going to need this information! I’ve seen other girls say she has shit them down when there have been issues and you need to be able to recoup your outlay for this.
</p>
<p>
Keeping you in my thoughts for a rapid stabilization!

Thank you all for the advice. My boyfriend is coming to bring me to the emergency room. My mother has been helping me on this journey but she still believes in Rumer.

Is this your Dr. because I would file a law suite. Apparently She has a history of fucking up her patients going back all the way to 2016.
</p>
<p>
I am wishing you the best and I hope you get justice. No one and I mean NO ONE should be butchered. I hope you know that their are people that love you and you will get through this. Just take it one day at a time and stay strong, you have a great community that will support you.  ✊💕

(Also please keep us updated on your story, it would mean a lot to know you are okay!)

Please listen to everyone here and get to an ER ASAP.

<p>
This surgeon is blacklisted in most places in Philly.
</p>
<p>
I run a group called the Butcher Busters and we would love to have a word with you after you recover. We would also like to know what hospital she performed your surgery at since she keeps jumping hospitals.

Where in the northeast are you? Mt. Sinai in NYC, Mass Gen or Boston Med in Boston, Dartmouth in NH all have affirmative care programs… if you’re wondering where to go next but definitely an ER ASAP! 🙏💕

Dr. Ting and Dr. Tran (they work together) specialize in helping people who have gone through Rumer, like it&#39;s Ting&#39;s mission to fix Rumer&#39;s mistakes. A friend of mine had SRS through Rumer about 10 years ago and was left in a pretty poor shape, but Dr. Ting and Dr. Tran fixed her up this last week with great success! She&#39;s only said fantastic things about that duo so I think you&#39;ll be in good hands!

I’m so sorry this is happening. She is so irresponsible and has such a bad reputation here I really hope her license gets removed. In fact I found petitions being circulated on electric poles around her practise… don’t know why she is still practising, she has harmed enough people

Sorry you’re experiencing such awful separation. It looks like the suture all separated and you need to get in to a ER. They can give you antibiotics and help you wash the area. You might want to call your insurance and get into an inpatient rehab.  The whole area is an open area susceptible to infection.  In mean time start on Arnica Montana pellets.
</p>
<p>
Does it hurt? How about fluid leakage? Odor?  Don’t be to scared to get help. You might need to stop dilating and get a revision once your all healed up.

There is a dull ache in the area. I dont believe any fluid is leaking out nor is there an apparent odor. All my (non Rumer) doctors say to keep dilating. I have no clue who to trust.

Don’t listen to me. If you’re comfortable dilating go ahead and continue.
</p>
<p>
I say to stop so you can heal and let the area be less touched. Keep your area clean and I still suggest going into a rehab facility. Get on some antibiotics from your PCP.

Get to your local emergency room. That needs proper wound care. Tonight! (Often it’s faster to go at night and get started with some attention, then wait till morning when everyone who tried to “sleep it off” wake up)

Go to the emergency room. I did for an infection on week three. I went right away and caught it before it became a serious problem. Again go to the emergency room tonight. Not tomorrow. Not hope it clears up.

Very concerned about the color. This looks like necrotic tissue and you need to take care of it NOW!.

ER now!  Don’t let Rumer near you. Document everything and then sue her to bankruptcy so she never touches another patient again!

I’m FtM and had phallo with MANY SEVERE complications that weren’t my surgeons fault and were handled correctly (check my profile if you wanna see, kinda similar to OP).. you shouldn’t be treating this at home. Please go to the ER like other comments are saying. Your surgery will look better the sooner you get this taken care of 🙏

If you end up not going for whatever reason.. (I am NOT a medical professional, however, I have a lot of experience with extreme wounds and separation.. so take this as you will and consult a doc) I would highly recommend  a dressing called calcium or silver Alginate. I used small pieces of this and put them just inside my separations and it pulls out the moisture and allows them to heal much faster. I’ve had a TON of progress with these and you can get them at Walgreens
</p>
<p>
I def believe these aren’t the kind of wounds you want to be putting anything on to make them more moist..

Call an uber. Go to the ER. Don’t let your parents stop you. You needed the ER days ago. This is consider taking an ambulance levels of you need to be seen like now.

I hope you made it safely to the ER. I hope that they are taking the utmost care of you. I hope that you see this after you wake up.
</p>
<p>
You really do deserve better and I wish this had never happened to you. Hopefully you are on the mend and in good care.

This hasn&#39;t been like this in decades in first-world countries. The fact that she hasn&#39;t even lost her medical license, let alone been imprisoned... on death row... should be an embarrassment to all medical professionals.  *I&#39;m* embarrassed!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I understand she likes to sue people who are critical. She should feel free to sue me, because I don&#39;t have standing otherwise, and I&#39;d _love_ to have the standing to bury her forever.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Anyway - please don&#39;t let that chase you off of actual respectable SRS surgeons. Revisions are common - but they tend to be relatively minor, and the support is actually there.

I am so sorry that this is happening to you. I’m not entirely sure how ER’s would help you because they don’t have surgeons trained on gender reassignment surgeries but I do think in the absence of your surgeon the ER would be the best option.

Nurse here just want to reassure you a bit. Yes this needs to be addressed quickly.  Evrrything doesn&#39;t look right but most of the areas I see here are how would describe it.. the tissue looks healthy  it isn&#39;t inflamed or infected looking. I hope you get the help you need and have an easier recovery.

I don&#39;t like the color or texture of some of that. I&#39;m concerned about supply. So I&#39;m not sure I entirely agree with you. I don&#39;t see any weeping infection, agreed. But I&#39;m more concerned about stuff turning icky colors and falling off, if you get my meaning...

I get what you mean. I come from an ems er background and probably tend to understand react. I would paxk it with Sterile gauze and monitor. Surgeon definitely needs to deal with this next day or so. But im not concerned about it becoming septic. It&#39;s horrible because it isn&#39;t right this should have never happened.

I am so sorry that you are going through this. I am a trans physician and it looks like your wound has a very deep opening/ulcer that needs to be corrected. It looks the wound is opening up significantly. I would absolutely go to hospital and get it revised asap.

I couldn&#39;t pass this by without also reiterating what the other med professionals have said;
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not a physician; I&#39;m a former EMT, a current pharmacy professional. Neosporin or any topical Over The Counter ointment is not made for this kind of wound. Neosporin is intended for surface level scrapes, minor wounds that do not go &#34;full depth&#34;.
</p>
<p>
In my time as an EMT, I would&#39;ve tried to find a way to meet the criteria for forcing an ER trip in the ambo. You are in a fragile state, medicated on pain meds that can alter thought processes and ability to make -informed- decisions, and are being actively coerced not to go by &#34;caregivers&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Worst case scenario, you spend a few hours in a place that is better geared to treat your situation. There is no downside to getting a second set of TRAINED MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL Physician/NP/PA/hell, at this point, the hospital&#39;s environmental services (cleaning crew) eyes on this.
</p>
<p>
I hope you&#39;ve already sought proper medical care. If you haven&#39;t and you would like help:
</p>
<p>
1: You could justifiably call 911 for this issue. You have orifices in your body that aren&#39;t supposed to be there. (Those separations are so deep that you said there is no vaginal wall in some spots?)
</p>
<p>
2: Call the non-emergent number if you truly do not want to call the emergency line. That can be found by googling, &#34;non-emergent dispatch &lt;town name&gt;&#34;
</p>
<p>
3: If you are too anxious to do either of those, you could call or text a friend (even if they are not in the same area) to call for you.
</p>
<p>
4: Several big cities have a system in place where you can text 911. Literally texting a message like, &#34;Recovering from major surgery. stitches failed. Not actively bleeding, but it is very deep. I need an ambulance&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I hope you reached out for help last night, but we&#39;d really feel more comfortable if you remember to update us. We worry about our trans-siblings. ❤️

My parents were correct in not going to the ER because we live in maine so our hospitals are packed and lack specialists. Going to a hospital in Boston right now. They have a surgeons who specializes in trans care. She has agreed to see us immediately.

I&#39;m so sad this happened to you! The website you used appears to be one where the surgeons themselves write their own description. It ends up basically being an advertisement even though it appears to be legit/unbiased info. A lot of reputable surgeons are on there with no description and there is a button that says &#34;claim this listing&#34; where (I bet for a fee) doctors can submit whatever type of flattering description they want. This Rumer doctor is evil!
</p>
<p>
Edit to add: yep! It&#39;s basically an ad service masquerading as unbiased information. Scroll to the very bottom and click &#34;surgeons claim your listing&#34; and it explicitly lays out the service as advertising for a fee. How dreadful....

Rumor is incredibly litigious, so be careful. If you need a revision I also live in this area. Don’t go back to her. Let’s just say that there is a surgeon that has a last name that starts with R who is also known as the butcher. I recommend Dr. Opoku at the Philadelphia center for transgender surgery in Bala Cynwood

Listen, If you don&#39;t have a ride to the ER. call 911 and let them know it&#39;s not an emergency but you need an ambulance to pick you up to bring you out to the hospital. You need to have it looked at because it WILL get infected. Neosporin is not good for big wounds like that.
