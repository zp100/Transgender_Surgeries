Hi, the title is pretty straight forward, does anyone have any experiences with Dr. Monstrey?
<br>
What are his results like?
<br>
Are you happy with how things are looking?
<br>
What about depth?
</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance!

I have seen results from him and they looked mediocre. Not bad but not great either. He does a very basic penile inversion.  He focuses especially on the vagina itself, there won&#39;t be much of an actual vulva.  There will be a bit of labia but not really defined labia. He focuses mostly on the vagina itself and on creating depth.  His patients were all able to orgasm from the ones I have spoken to. He is soon retiring. Dr Houtmeyers in Sint-Niklaas is more in demand nowadays. That&#39;s the surgeon who operated on Bo Van Spilbeeck.

Thank you! What I&#39;ve heard in my first consultation with him... even depth isn&#39;t great... on average 13cm... And to be honest, that&#39;s below Belgian average.

Not directly, but my surgeon trained with him. I would expect the my results would mirror Dr. Monstrey’s. I have good depth and pretty good looks, but as another poster commented, not really defined labia. I think the reasoning here is the intent of getting the big stuff healed as easily as possible, then tweaking the final look in a revision later.

I wasn&#39;t told about any revisions later on. I thought it was just that.
</p>
<p>
Also, if I may ask, can you specify &#34;good depth&#34;?

I have 5 1/2” of depth. I’m pretty happy with that.
</p>
<p>
As for revisions, I think that is on a case by case basis. Mine looks pretty good and if it wasn’t for some scar tissue that I will have to have removed, I probably wouldn’t do any revision work, but since I will probably be going under the knife again, I will have him tweak the appearance. Fortunately this is out patient surgery and I will only be off for a couple days.
