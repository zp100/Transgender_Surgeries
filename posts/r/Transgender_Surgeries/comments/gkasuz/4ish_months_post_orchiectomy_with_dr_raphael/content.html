As the title says, I had a bilateral orchiectomy with Dr. Raphael at the end of January 2020. It&#39;s been about 4 months and I just wanted to post an update about my experiences.
</p>
<p>
At the time I lived 15 minutes from him so transportation was very easy and I recovered at home.
</p>
<p>
Scheduling:
</p>
<p>
I decided at the end of last year that since I couldn&#39;t afford GCS I could at least get an orchiectomy. I had a consultation with American Institute For Plastic Surgery (Dr. Raphael&#39;s business) at the middle of December, and the surgery was almost exactly a month later. The cost was $2700 cash pay, or a little bit more if I used my insurance because they bill differently. I paid cash, in two payments (using my FSA, lol)
</p>
<p>
I was prescribed hydrocodone, an anti anxiety/sleep aid, and an antibiotic that I filled a couple of days before.
</p>
<p>
I took Thursday through Monday off from work.
</p>
<p>
Day of/night before:
</p>
<p>
My surgery was on a Thursday. I received a phone call about 6pm the night before to give me my surgery time, which was 3pm. I was told to arrive two hours early.
</p>
<p>
Thursday morning I received another call at around 10am asking if I could move my surgery up to 1pm. So my fiancée and I jumped in the car and went over.
</p>
<p>
I filled out some basic paperwork and got taken back to a room where I undressed and put on some compression socks and his assistant put the IV tube in, with some fluids (saline solution?). Then I waited for Dr. Raphael for about 30 minutes. He came in and said hi, checked on me, then went and got ready. His bedside manner is incredible and I never felt anxious around him. His assistant came in about 5 minutes after he left and wheeled me back to the operating room.
</p>
<p>
In the operating room there were 4 or 5 people (iirc), and the assistant immediately put me under through my IV.
</p>
<p>
Next thing I remember I was coughing furiously and having a hard time breathing. Evidently I had been breathing weird during the procedure so my throat had become super dry. They gave me a breathing treatment and water (I think. This is foggy because I was just coming up from anesthetic) and once satisfied rolled me out to the recovery area. The entire procedure took about an hour.
</p>
<p>
I waited in the recovery area for about an hour. My fiancée did the outpatient paperwork and was told how to take care of me. I did the breathing treatment a few more times during this wait. I was vaguely aware of pain in my crotch but still to doped up on pain meds to really feel it.
</p>
<p>
Fiancée drove home and I immediately went to bed. When I woke up about 4 hours later I HURT. It was a throbbing pain and I couldn&#39;t really move. I took hydrocodone and once it kicked in was able to walk to the bathroom and pee (standing up. Going to a sitting position was very difficult.)
</p>
<p>
That cycle basically repeated the rest of the night until my follow-up appointment the next day.
</p>
<p>
Friday morning we went back to the office and met with Dr. Raphael who removed the padding and gave me some fresh cotton. I was instructed to keep pressure on the location for a while using those weird shaper panties you can find at Target and to keep wearing the compression socks.
</p>
<p>
I ate some soup and crackers that day and continued pain meds, as well as put ice on the area. This continued all weekend.
</p>
<p>
By Sunday I was able to be out of bed pretty freely and even played Warframe on my PC for a few hours. Sitting for extended periods of time was still difficult, but I was doing much better. I started taking less hydrocodone because opioids scare the crap out of me. Monday afternoon I checked in with work and decided to take Tuesday off as well. Tuesday was the last day I took any pain meds.
</p>
<p>
Wednesday morning I did actually go to the office. That was probably a mistake. I was sitting on a cushion but was still pretty uncomfortable. I think I could have gone back Friday and not had any pain.
</p>
<p>
About 2 weeks later I had a follow up with Dr. Raphael. He made sure everything was healing well and told me that the scars should fade by about 6-8 months. I had a concern about these little bumps I was feeling inside the area (almost like they didn&#39;t get removed). Dr. Raphael assured me that these are normal and it&#39;s something like blood pooling, and goes away on its own.
</p>
<p>
May 2020/summary:
</p>
<p>
The scarring is barely noticeable. The total recovery time was about a week until I was at 100% again, and only about 2 days until I could get back to normal life.

<span class="md-spoiler-text">
I have gotten off since the surgery. I actually masturbated and orgasmed the weekend I was healing. A very small amount of clear fluid comes out, and it&#39;s more like a trickle then a shooting. My antidepressants made my sex drive pretty low, but combined with the orchiectomy have basically killed it. It&#39;s difficult to even do maintenance to avoid atrophy right now.

Thank you so much for sharing.
</p>
<p>
I plan on getting one soon.

Did he make your incisions in your groin or your scrotum?

Ok, I&#39;m wanting mine thru the scrotum - if it&#39;s anything like when I had my vasectomy (under local anaesthesia), the pain should be minimal...

if you&#39;re comfortable saying - how far does the atrophy go? Is there a big size difference? Mostly wondering if this is something i should worry about if I am considering SRS

I&#39;m not OP, but I&#39;ll share my experience. Atrophy, after enough time, can eventually bring a penis size down significantly, leaving little tissue left to perform a gcs with. Smaller penis means a shorter vaginal depth should you choose to get a vaginoplasty. Atrophy also makes erections extremely painful, it&#39;s misshapen mine for me (during an erection), and its like.... it feels like trying to bend the thick, inner part of your ear just as far and easily as the thin, more flexible parts, just hurts, especiallyif I bend it it certaindirections. My Dr. just started me on 1 mL a week of a 0.5% compounded testosterone cream for just my penis, to combat and hopefully reverse the atrophy, so we&#39;ll see how that goes.

Ive been on hormones for 17 months, got my testikels removed in 2019 in november. I stil haven&#39;t really lost any noticable d*cksize. But you know the phrase &#34;use it or lose it&#34; In my opinion it only shrinks when you dont play atleast once a week with it but your milage may vary. When i take progesteron i also get morning erections.
</p>
<p>
I think trans that are on HRT and hate their d*ck and erecting will lose the ability to become erect and shrink because thats what they want, and the body subconciously acts to the mind.  As far as i read thats the best explanation i can give you
</p>
<p>
My empty sack is also stil flubby, especially when im in a hot shower for to long 🙈😝

I wasn&#39;t very big pre-hrt (started in early 2017), but I completely lost my sex drive upon starting and lost about 3.5 inches due to lack of maintenance.
</p>
<p>
I gained basically all of it back, and now have lost maybe an inch since my orchiectomy. I&#39;m still doing maintenance now because I hope to have GCS someday and need something there to work with.
