So I just had FFS and just got unwrapped. I know I need to shave. I got the forehead reduction, brow lift, rhinoplasty, and thyroid shave. I don‚Äôt feel or think I look too different. I know the facial hair doesn‚Äôt help but this was taken after my first shower since unwrapping. Any suggestions?

Swelling of the face is super tricky with these surgeries. The whole purpose of the surgery is to take bone away, but then swelling comes in and puts it all right back. It‚Äôs a good sign that you look the same now while everything is swollen, because that means when there is a lot of changes that you will see when it goes down. It took me around 6 months to be able to see all the changes and be happy with them.

It‚Äôs going to take a solid year for all that swelling to completely subsided, and for you to see the actual changes that were made. Slow down, give yourself some time. It looks good from what I can see from the full frontal profile.

I think your facial structure looks distinctly female, making the facial hair look very out of place and not really even making you look like a guy. More like wth why does this girl have so much facial hair.

you look like a person that got out of surgery less than a month ago. so did I when I was done, but I look at pictures of me a month or six weeks out from surgery now, and I literally don&#39;t look like the same person.
</p>
<p>
when the doctor first unwrapped me 2 weeks after surgery I had a fucking panic attack because I was like oh shit what did I just do, whereas he was like oh my God I did such a good job. in hindsight I&#39;m like 120% happy with the results, but at the time I thought I had just ruined my life. you really have to give it time. it takes time for swelling to go down and proportions to really take their shape. come back and show us progress in 3-6 months!
</p>
<p>
trust the process! you&#39;re gonna look great.

Yes. My suggestion is to be patient. It takes a long time to see your final results. 3mo min, 6mo-1yr. Then you know. Everything now is swelling and bruising etc‚Ä¶ keep calm and wait until at least the 3mo mark.

Suggestion #1: be patient. I know that sucks, cuz I feel the same way. I‚Äôm about 6 weeks post FFS and I sometimes feel that way. But I know that once things heal and settle, the changes will be more obvious. Also the changes are going to be subtle, since they‚Äôre made in millimeters not inches. For what it‚Äôs worth, I can tell that your face has been feminized even without seeing you before pictures, and I can‚Äôt wait to see how much more beauty it gets with time &amp; then especially after you put on makeup after things are healed and poppin‚Äô!

You look amazing, especially for the time out and it will just continue heal absolutely beautifully.  It took me 6-8 months to finally start seeing and appreciating the changes.  A full year for it to ‚Äúfinalize.‚Äù

Swelling is going the culprit here. I would have suggested we advanced the hairline an inch or so, but I&#39;m not the surgeon. Maybe when swelling was down they felt it looked fine.

Honestly it seems like you are recovering from a lot just now, so it‚Äôs important to kinda keep calm and carry on because there are gonna be a lot of new experiences and emotions for u, but it will turn out to be just fine.

About 2 weeks now. Yes, I thought my nose was gonna look rotten, bloody, and gross but thankfully it‚Äôs just really sensitive and healing with time. I had the rest of my stitches taken out yesterday and cleaned myself up since this picture was taken 2 weeks ago.

I agree tbh‚Ä¶I went from super swollen right after surgery to it gradually going away. Then at 3 months felt so defeated because in my opinion my face didn‚Äôt seem all that different, but at 5-6 months all of a sudden it just seemed a lot more feminine and different, which sounds weird but yea üòÖ. You look amazing though, a shave and you‚Äôll be serving fish sis.
