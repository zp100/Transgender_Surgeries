Congratulations and good results, wish you speedy recovery! What procedures did you do ? Why you felt mouth is smaller ? We can see for the same angle pre shows lower teeth row but post pic shows upper row teeth. Is this something done with surgery procedure

I had hairline advancement, type 3 brow and orbital contouring, rhinoplasty, cheek implants, lip lift and augmentation, sliding genioplasty and mandibular contouring.
</p>
<p>
The lower lip lift was achieved by strategically placing the genioplasty incisions higher in the mouth. This, in combination with the upper lip lift, seems to give me less &#34;cheek space&#34; and thus it&#39;s a little hard to chew without my lips opening up.

How do the cheek implants feel? Do you notice them? They look really natural. I&#39;m getting them too and was initially worried about how they look but from all of the results I see from Mardirossian they look great.

Does he normally do an eyebrow lift with type 3 forehead work? I know some surgeons do it almost automatically, others you have to specifically ask
</p>
<p>
Amazing results btw

I think he typically does the browlift with type 3 forehead work. My quote has the browlift listed alongside forehead contouring and scalp advancement, all in one cost.

I mean they are still present somewhat, but I think the lip lift did a lot of softening up!

Wow, the swelling on the 4th-5th day looks intense! You look great though. I have my surgery on August 1st with Mardirossian. I have a few questions.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What was discussed during your pre-op consultation, did you show any example / reference pictures of what you wanted?
</li>
<li>
What were your feelings on the morning leading up to the surgery?
</li>
<li>
What can you remember from waking up after the surgery? How was the pain / discomfort? (I&#39;m really worried about feeling claustrophobic with all the swelling and not being able to breathe through my nose)
</li>
<li>
Did you experience any nausea after the surgery?
</li>
<li>
How difficult was it to manage the post-op care whilst recovering (icing your face, applying ointment etc.)? Did you have to ice during the night?
</li>
<li>
Is there anything you wish you brought with you for the recovery?
</li>
</ol>

Good questions! 1. My initial video consult was in October 2022 and my pre-op consult was in March 2024, so he spent time reviewing again what his plans were for surgery and making sure we agreed on any decisions being made (for example, he decided to include my existing hairline instead of assuming the grafts I had would all fall out). He also did some touching/poking to get a feel for how much cartilage and fat were in certain parts of my face. Then he did the CT scan and showed me what he is looking for in that scan. 2. I was excited and a bit nervous. My mom and partner went with me to the hospital and I was pretty calm up until they stuck the IV in me, at which point I began crying and freaking out a little. It&#39;s a pretty huge deal, and I knew I wanted it I think the &#34;things are gonna be different from now on&#34; just hit me like a brick. 3. When I woke up I had to pee so freaking bad! I was also sleepy. The blood pressure cuff that was on my arm was so tight I couldn&#39;t feel my arm, which initially freaked me the fuck out. As far as claustrophobia... Not really, at least not in my case. Just know you&#39;re gonna be drooling all over yourself for a while. I could actually breathe through my nose the whole time, fwiw. 4. I did not experience any nausea. I have been told that is kinda unusual. 5. My mom stayed with me for the first week and kept track of medications and stuff to make sure I wasn&#39;t too doped up. As far as icing, they gave me some small round ice packs at the hospital and I rotated those out of the freezer every ~45 minutes or so, and just tucked them into my bandages. You can also buy them on Amazon, super handy. I tried to also do the frozen peas or whatever but that wasn&#39;t really as effective. I also got a &#34;cold eye mask&#34; and that helped with eyelid swelling. At night, if I woke up I would walk over to the freezer and replace the ice packs. I didn&#39;t sleep too well the first few nights, because sleeping on an incline was weird for me. Ointment is no big deal. 6. As far as things I wish I knew for recovery... My partner drove me home the day after surgery and I recovered in my apartment, so I had all my stuff. Eating is MESSY. Make sure you have a ton of towels/rags to cover your clothes. You can try to use syringes for food, and for drinks I was recommended &#34;nosey cups&#34; that are awesome. Be gentle with yourself, go for walks when you feel comfortable, and relax. After the first week, I felt like I was basically ready to go back to normal life.

That was extremely helpful, thank you! I&#39;m also worried about the IV. I don&#39;t mind the needle but the thought of something staying inside my body for a longer period of time makes me feel sick. How long was it from getting the IV to being under general anaesthesia? I&#39;m hoping I don&#39;t have to worry about it for too long!

Maybe 10-15 minutes. It might have been longer, I was joking with my partner about how hot I was gonna be after surgery and not paying a ton of attention lol

gosh they did mine at least 30 mine before surgery! But thats because they did all my surgery prep before going to the OR.  Also they messed up my IV (soo bad my hand was bruised for over a week!) and had to do it twice.  I actually passed out right after the second IV attempt.  I guess this is common though and they were prepared for it.
</p>
<p>
All in all I dont think the anxiety truly hit me until they wheeled me into the OR and started strapping me down.  At least it was short lived.  Last thing I remember was the anesthesiologist ominously saying im about to &#34;give you something to relax&#34;
</p>
<p>
I did NOT react to anesthesiology well and for me the hardest part of the recovery was the nausea from it and my throat being sooo swollen from the breathing tube!

His staff seemed really nice, I only met him and Galina in person but everyone I talked to on the phone seemed friendly and helpful.
</p>
<p>
The pain was not bad at all, I had an orchiectomy in February and that was more painful in my opinion. The discomfort of not being able to close my mouth for a week... Now that sucked.

There is often &#34;shock loss&#34; of hair when doing a hairline incision, and hair will be lost regardless of whether it is natural or grafted. This doesn&#39;t always happen, but it&#39;s typical for this kind of surgery. The difference is, natural hair usually comes right back and grafted hair often doesn&#39;t. That said, surgeons sometimes &#34;ignore&#34; the areas where hair has been grafted and use your &#34;real&#34; hairline to ensure that you don&#39;t end up with an incision that isn&#39;t covered by your hair. In this case, we discussed it and he decided to take the risk, since my natural hairline is way the hell back there and my graft areas were pretty dense.

Yes,  seems like a lot of people have no trouble. United Healthcare was just very clear with me they make no exceptions for FFS.

Hey! Just wanted to check here- do you mean they categorically denied making exceptions for FFS? I have United as well and I am thinking if I can somehow get them to cover FFS for me (although they don&#39;t cover it)

I mean I submitted doctor letters and did everything I read online to try and convince them to cover it and got nowhere in 9 months. Not saying it&#39;s impossible and this was my first time trying anything like this, so maybe I wasn&#39;t doing it right. My surgeon also said he has never heard of United covering FFS.

Damn that&#39;s a long time to wait for a surgery date, I really want to go with Madarossian. You have great results./ I wonder if only deciding on hairline, brow/forehead contouring, and rhinoplasty will get me in sooner.

Yeah that&#39;s what&#39;s considered a half day, so he could fit you into a day with someone else. Id ask.

Would you be able to share the price of your type 3 brow and orbital contouring? 💕 I think I’ll be holding off on the hairline advancement because 20k+ is infeasible for me rn 🥹

Well in order to get to your brow and orbitals they have to do the forehead incision, so that&#39;s really the best opportunity to fly the hairline advancement.
</p>
<p>
With my surgeon, the costs for upper face and lower face were about even.

You’re absolutely right. And one thing I didn’t consider is that I’d have to pay for hospital fees + anesthesia even if I were to break it into 2 separate surgeries, and so it would make more sense to just do it all in one go 🥲
</p>
<p>
Would you be able to share how much your upper face surgeries cost? And did that include your cheekbones as well?
