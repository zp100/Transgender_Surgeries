Personally, I would suggest you split it unless you have someone with you at all times to help you. Breasts recover quicker but itâ€™s more uncomfortable than srs in my opinion.  And Iâ€™m still in the process of recovery. I did have someone with me at all times so that helps.
</p>
<p>
I normally donâ€™t discuss surgeries too much or how things look because I feel it gives other expectations that donâ€™t always apply to everyone.  Things are good. I think McGinn is wonderful.  Bedside manner is the usual complaint, which I didnâ€™t actually notice but who cares as long as they do a good job.
</p>
<p>
Thereâ€™s a post on here about someone who disliked McGinn because they had complications and necrosis. However they didnâ€™t stop hormones as itâ€™s required, so I would suggest you do exactly as you are told. So to break down costs.
</p>
<p>
Total SRS: 23,500 broken into various payments. (I paid cash so no insurance )
</p>
<p>
BA:7500 First srs payment about : 6,845 Second : 6,845 Anesthesia: 1,100 Hospital : 5,100 3 weeks in PA: 8,000. ( yes excessive but family paid) you wanna be comfortable and I wanted to stay long enough to recover a bit more before my flight.

this is very helpful. I was going to take 8 weeks off from work. Would that be enought time to recover from the double surgery? I&#39;m a healthy young adult if that matters.
</p>
<p>
I could care less about mediocre bedside manner, surgeons are generally miserable people so I don&#39;t even expect it lol (I&#39;m in the medical profession). I care much more about results and their skills/expertise. I think she has those based off of my own research.

8 weeks is plenty of time. Keep in mind we all heal differently and at our own pace but should suffice.

Not really.  Then again I didnâ€™t given it much thought. I think I was more concerned about doing things properly. Taking care of it all and such ðŸ˜…
