<p>
I&#39;ve looked through the wiki here and other subreddits, google and other places and have seen alot of doctor recommendations but not too many experiences or reviews showing black trans patients. I live in the US on the east coast, but am willing to go wherever for the right surgeon if I feasibly can.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m getting a bit more serious with thinking about and planning FFS +BA, and honestly not sure who or where  I would go. I&#39;ve honestly been afraid that I wont be able to find a doctor I like in the US while also being more expensive, so was debating on going to South America, the Facial team in Spain/Brazil or South korea. I believe they might be more experienced, have better reviews and also maybe not as expensive.
</p>
<p>
I also think that maybe going outside the US, it would work better for what I want done. Since I also want a BA, trachea shave and most likely will want to get dental work done for an overbite and lip incompetence that maybe I could do them all in one place.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I would worry about wherever I would go is places giving me a too unappealing look because they are used to non-poc patients. Could anyone give advice regarding this or share experiences? Best thing I can think to do is try to get a lot of consultations,  VFFS, reviews and spend a long time looking it over.

Facial team have mostly caucasian patients and rhinoplasty requires different techniques for other ethnicities. For this part at least your probably be better of with someone with a lot more experience in those techniques. I think they would tell you that if you asked.

I would say make sure you
<em>
really
</em>
do your research before traveling overseas.
</p>
<p>
In my letter writing group, one of the ladies went to Korea, I believe.. they treat BA like you&#39;re going to a nail salon. She asked for a specific size, but they sized her up. She had other work done overseas, but decided to do her SRS here in case she had complications or needed revisions.
</p>
<p>
Also, a few days ago another lady here posted ‚ú®
<em>
amazing
</em>
‚ú® photos of her SRS results from Thailand. Simply stunning work. I asked a few questions, then mentioned I would contact the doctor myself.. but after checking my profile and noticing I was a POC, she DM&#39;ed me saying how she had to reach out and let me know that she&#39;s heard several stories of women of color having botched surgeries from said doctor.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think I need to say more ü•≤
</p>
<p>
Just make sure you
<em>
thoroughly
</em>
research the doctor and clinic&#39;s background, making sure they have a positive history with POC.

Thats what I was initially worried about too. I had a bad feeling overseas and even though some get really good ones done in korea, that it can be a hit or miss, and on top of that getting one done there as a poc is difficult too

I think most US surgeons are used to working with a diverse clientele and it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.  With any surgeon, I think we have to be pro-active and know what we want.  Also, there are now poc surgeons like Dr. Satterwhite.   That said, I‚Äôm mixed, look exotic or white I guess, but always explain my ancestry and have had only positive experiences with a number of health care providers, some trans specialists, and some not.

it&#39;s very different for black trans women unfortunately. im not denying your experience, im an egyptian trans girl, i dont think im white passing but what do i know. idea is, no matter what race i am, black women are more opressed. doctors even think black women dont feel pain as much as non black women do. People are fucked.

Thats a good point, I definetly have a long way to go and alot to research before I decide.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for mentioning Satterwhite I plan to just have a list and really look at it thoroughly. Im not mixed and just look black , so I guess ill really have to factor that in.

Mount Sinai in NYC might be worth look at! I recently had a consult with Dr. Pang and most of his FFS pics were of poc. He even made it a point to say that unless people ask for it, he typically doesn&#39;t like to remove ethnic features in a persons face. I&#39;m white, but we used pics of my mom when she was younger to kinda guide what we should do with my surgery.

Thanks for mentioning Dr Pang, I guess I havent heard of Mt. Sinai before but it sounds like its been mentioned a decent bit. A doctor that doesnt remove ethnic features sounds good to me also.

Not being poc I can&#39;t give personal recommendations of course but some thoughts I would have would be to make sure that when you go for an ffs consult you specifically ask them the total and annual volume for black folks. In addition to see examples of black folks. Many surgeons have consult books of before and afters. I know my surgeon Deschamps-braly does. Ask them specifically how they would handle your face as well.

Thanks for this advice, Ill make sure to check with examples. I always wondered if black people were just less frequent mentioned or referenced in them. My plan is to check them out and compare what they would do to my face as well

I agree! I‚Äôm a black transgender woman and planning on FFS 2021.....I‚Äôm choosing Harrison Lee but I‚Äôm not touching my nose. Most people of African descent have a broad nose and although I want a nose job I know I have to search for a surgeon who specializes in ethnic rhinoplasty

I&#39;m a person of mixed racial ancestry and I felt super comfortable with Dr. Satterwhite for my FFS revision. He&#39;s my first choice right now.
</p>
<p>
FYI, he happens to be a gay black man, so he kinda gets it in a way that most docs don&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
You can also forget about Facial Team being a less expensive option. Their quote was higher than some US doctors that I consulted with and only about 5k less than Dr. Deschamps-Braly. For that price  difference I&#39;d definitely choose him over them.

Ill have to check out Dr. Satterwhite,  I had heard of Deschamps-Braly as I&#39;ve seen him frequently mentioned. I dont know why I thought Facial Team was less expensive, I thought somewhere in span or south america were cheaper than the US

South America is for sure less expensive. Spain is the EU, so not so much. BE VERY CAREFUL traveling abroad as a person of color. I&#39;ve heard some horror stories about Thai surgeons being really cruel to dark skinned people, same story in South America.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rossi is probably the most inexpensive decent option and seems to have consistently satisfied patients. There&#39;s also Torres in Argentina (who I can&#39;t seem to verify much info on), and Cardenas in Mexico (who I wouldn&#39;t go anywhere near) and Dr. Marquez in Mexico (who I don&#39;t know much about). Dr. DiMaggio in Argentina used to do some of the best foreheads but he&#39;s fallen off in terms of quality in recent years and he&#39;s kind of an egomaniac. Honestly, I&#39;d only go to any of these docs if I had exhausted all possibilities of getting surgery in the US, Canada, or EU though. It&#39;s the wild west down there... you don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re going to get.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Satterwhite&#39;s team tries really hard to help you get FFS and GCS through insurance. I&#39;d highly recommend doing at least a consultation with him.

That&#39;s what I kind of was thinking about South America and Asia, but if they would be less advised because of how they would operate on poc I&#39;m definitely fine with steering clear.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the advice, I haven&#39;t traveled outside the US before and honestly I&#39;ve worried about the same thing just thinking to myself what are even places I could go vacation/travel wise, idk.
</p>
<p>
Ill definitely contact and reach out to him. Thanks for mentioning him.

This girl went to him. Still pretty swollen in the after photo. But the forehead and nose work look top-notch!

I&#39;ve heard at least 2 mentions of DiMaggio dropping racial slurs to his nurses when he thought patients were out of earshot, and at least one account of Chettawut doing the same after a patient requested an SRS revision. I read it a while ago, but I&#39;ll try to find the threads.

Why wouldn&#39;t you go anywhere near Cardenas? I&#39;ve been looking at him cause the prices are affordable, does he have a bad track record?

Most of the results I&#39;ve seen of his aren&#39;t good at all. There are some ok ones, but I&#39;ve never seen anything impressive by him and that includes the ones on his own website. There was also a post on this subreddit a few months back of him giving a girl a chin implant that wasn&#39;t needed at all.

I went to Dr. Emiliano Torres in Argentina. Facial feminization center. I got fantastic results for 20% of what it would have cost me here in the US. Everything was top notch. Better after care than what I received here.

Oh wow that does sound good. Do you have before and after pictures, and would you recommend them for black women as well? I&#39;m definitely interested in learning more.

I have been searching for information myself and trying to find results. The only specialist I found for AA/POC FFS is Dr. Deschamps-Braly. I have an appointment for FFS with him in February 2025.
