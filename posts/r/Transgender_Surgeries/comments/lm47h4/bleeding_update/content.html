This is straight up wound dehiscence. No it&#39;s not good and I can give you many reasons because I&#39;ve fucking lived through all of them. You need to find out if your surgeon is going to intervene or suggest you let it heal by second intention. If he says Second intention, you just doubled your recovery time. I would never joke about this.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve had to deal with because of wound dehiscence.

Heh...do you think you&#39;re telling me something I&#39;m not keenly aware of? Shit I don&#39;t post here to show off my glamour-pus. I post here on the chance I may help someone else avoid my situation. Suing your surgeon is far more complicated and difficult than you might think in some States. I live in one of those places.

Hi, where are you from or where is your surgeon from? I suppose any 3rd world country? Where any &#34;surgeon&#34; can perform any surgery and difficult to sue them... I hope it is not in Europe, I got scared

Yes, I am from a third world country and a State run by people who still believe Donald Trump won the last election. Indianapolis IN
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t believe you will find a more difficult State to sue a surgeon. It was one of the first states to pass healthcare reform and the largest employer in the State is IU-Health. Your &#34;proposed&#34; case has to get approval from a panel of doctors who are specialist in that field or procedure. Only then can the case be filed as a malpractice case.  In a State with one practicing GRS surgeon, where do you find three experts for this panel. Not only that, what are the chances 2 of the 3 would side against surgeon named in the case.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a tip: You may be unhappy and have real damages no matter where you live in the US. The moment you say that you are going to sue your surgeon, you trigger all kinds of barriers meant to keep you from doing that. Chances are, the first thing they will do is ghost you. So if you are going to sue, STFU about it and -- Don&#39;t Make Threats. Just do it.

Well sucks to be me then because in their after care paperwork they sent they did mention dehiscence could be a thing and specifically stated &#34;this will heal on its own&#34;. So unless they respond with something else I guess I&#39;m just going to be waiting

I think it all depends on how big the wound is and where it is. You should research healing by second intention. It might just spell out your future. I was a fangirl the first time and just went along with the explanation. I still feel stupid about letting it go.

Now if I may ask what did your surgeon do and what did you experience? If you don&#39;t feel comfortable sharing though that&#39;s ok.

I just did. Gallagher did nothing. In fact, she said intervening is a rookie mistake. I was like patient #6. It turned into a disaster. This is why I have the problems I do now.

Well, I&#39;ve got horrid luck and a propensity to develop hypertrophic scars.  So multiple severe traumas increase my risk of that and now seeing what you&#39;ve gone through just makes me now even more paranoid that now I&#39;m screwed.

No you aren&#39;t screwed, but it will take some effort on your part. It&#39;s not like anyone is giving you a reliable diagnosis for anything based on a partial image. But.... now you don&#39;t have to be in the dark about what healing through second intention means. There are ways to improve the healing. I found this out on my third surgery. We did something called wet/dry bandaging. It really did help, but it didn&#39;t cut down on the time very much. It still took quite a while.

I’m not sure if I’m a noob here but with the location of the dehiscence I’d think it’d be easy enough to skip the original surgeon and go to an emergency room and have it re stitched. I cant imagine that restitch would have a worse outcome. With that being in the location it is I don’t think a different doctor restitching it would create an issues with the original surgery.wound dehiscence leave a nasty scar I have them on my forehead and have nerve issues from it.

But I&#39;d had a follow up yesterday and they&#39;d commented on how I had some minor dehiscence.  So that&#39;s why I&#39;m kind of thinking that&#39;s what this is. I&#39;m still waiting to hear back of course. I just need some help or reassurance that like this has happened to others I guess. Becsuse waiting to hear back still is agonizing

I&#39;m not going to lie, this doesn&#39;t look normal to me even in the early healing process. But I also never dealt with bleeding or dehiscence either, which are fairly normal complications. It&#39;ll definitely heal and look/feel better in time though.

Fair enough. Yesterday when I saw them they said everything besides the minor dehiscence looked great.  Then this morning I accidentally got out of bed too fast and that&#39;s when I noticed the issue which is why I&#39;m really thinking maybe that&#39;s what it is. I got up, over stressed the area and welp here we are. So like it makes sense to me that it&#39;s probably that.  But I&#39;m just scared to be frank, and my surgeon is in the OR all day so he&#39;s taking a while to get back to me which isn&#39;t helping my anxiety. Though if it is dehiscence I know there&#39;s not much they can do besides say &#34;well it&#39;ll heal on its own here&#39;s more antibiotics to prevent infection&#34; which is kind of all I&#39;m hoping for.

Second intention isn&#39;t that bad.  Better than risking infection, but longer recovery.
</p>
<p>
Once you hit 3-4 months, you&#39;ll probably be able to use a silicon scar cream and it won&#39;t be too bad.

I don&#39;t understand what this means. Every day during healing by second intention is an infection risk, especially in a perineal wound. What does this &#34;better than risking infection&#34; bit mean?

Bc an open wound is less likely to cause a systemic infection than a closed one.  It has to do with the metabolism of oxygen by the bacteria, the immune response of an exposed area, and the risk of sepsis.

See if you can get hyperbaric therapy. My surgeon sends all their patients for it. I think it really made a difference for me.

How could a surgeon with several years of experience and medical training achieve a result that, for lack of a better term, looks like a piece of flesh from a zombie? I wish you the best of luck with your current situation and hope you find a competent surgeon to fix this.

I actually am today. Because without seeing my surgeon in person they can&#39;t really run tests and with me being a few states away that&#39;s not possible. So we were just assuming lube and discharge. But I developed a fever today so I&#39;m going to Urgent Care to find out and they&#39;re doing some exams just to be on the safe side. But Dr I saw even complimented the actual work now that I&#39;ve healed up better. Just have to identify the possible infection which who knows where I mean have picked that up if I have one
