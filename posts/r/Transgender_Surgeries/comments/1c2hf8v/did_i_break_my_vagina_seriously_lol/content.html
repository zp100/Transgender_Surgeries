It doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;ve ruined anything (you haven&#39;t mentioned any pain or bleeding) -- you should be conscious that you do still have some erectile tissue remaining, and arousal will cause this erectile tissue to engorge and this can cause damage whilst your suture lines are still healing.
</p>
<p>
I had my first orgasm at 6 weeks. Some people don&#39;t regain the relevant sensation for quite a long time. Headspace is also important, and also you need to figure out which of the signals to kind of mentally latch onto as well... It&#39;ll take time. Enjoy your learning, but maybe not too often at this stage lmao

Thank you this really resonates. My biggest hurdle seems to be headspace and not knowing what feelings to lean into or not yet. I&#39;ll get very close and then psych myself out by telling myself I can&#39;t or thinking of something disconcerting; or try to make it happen (which backfires).
</p>
<p>
Physically you are absolutely right and I&#39;m gonna let it rest a while and maybe confess to my clinician on Monday lol. Thank you for the reassuring words though.

It took me like a year to finally work out what I like and still have difficulty at times fully getting there due to a wandering mind. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It&#39;s also hard to find time with four little ones running around demanding so much of my attention üòÖ

It will take a while before your nerves recover/remap. I doubt you broke anything.

every surgeon is different, but i had full depth 4.5 weeks ago and Ramineni&#39;s instructions to me said I was cleared for everything but penetrative sex at 4 weeks (and i did some light exploring a few days early because i was feeling up for it).
</p>
<p>
I have had some very good &#39;spasms&#39; that kinda quickly turn numb, and also ran into a bit of soreness on my clit and stitch lines. I am sure you are fine.
</p>
<p>
It may take weeks or months or more to orgasm, and that&#39;s okay. It&#39;ll happen when you&#39;re ready!

I&#39;m at 13 weeks. +1 for spasms. I did have one time I had like a huge amount of discharge before I finally gave up. Like soaked level of discharge. Otherwise, it feels mostly like edging.

I took me a full year to have my first orgasm. Now i can orgasm so quickly that that sounds so far away haha. Just give it time, it is not a race and you are not in a rush.
</p>
<p>
Try again in a couple weeks, try not to obsess it.

There is a bit of variation I&#39;ve heard from surgical recommendations. My own surgeon clears you for external stim at 6 weeks and preventative sex at 12 weeks but I&#39;ve heard others recommend more or less. If you&#39;re at 5 weeks, you are likely fine but regardless my recommendation is to wait at least a week before you try again. This is one area of my body I&#39;d rather be safe than sorry.
</p>
<p>
Also as others have said, for many women it can sometimes take months or over a year to regain orgasms and find what works.

Probably not. Trans neovagina is usually as strong as cis vagina.
