This beautiful gem appeared week. Let&#39;s dissect it according to the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/18bouvf/dr_rumers_astroturfedfake_reviews_are_becoming/">guide and exposé
</a>
on how to spot Rumer&#39;s fake reviews. There is also an active call to report Dr. Rumer to the FTC.

<p>
The following tropes are present in this review (copy and pasted from the guide)
</p>
<p>
* &#34;
<em>
My patient coordinator
</em>
&#34; usually followed by &#34;
<em>
answered all of my questions
</em>
&#34; or a story that is so outlandish that it gives the patient coordinator an insane amount of praise. &#34;IE:
<em>
My patient coordinator is so awesome that they saved the Earth from the asteroid and invited me to the Rumer family dinner!
</em>
&#34; In addition the patient coordinator is almost always name dropped. The &#34;hero&#39;s of humanity&#34; include, Gina, Terry, Jen and Dawn.
<strong>
While the word &#34;patient coordinator&#34; isn&#39;t used and the questions weren&#39;t answered this time around. The patient coordinators are however name dropped (ALL CAPS!) and given some next level masturbatory treatment with some of the worst grammar I have ever seen.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
* First time google reviewer. Sometimes though they will have 2 other reviews in random locations all over PA or Jersey.
<strong>
Yup....
</strong>
</p>
<p>
* &#34;Would recommend&#34; Usually comes at the end.
<strong>
1000% percent no hesitant (six exclamation marks)
</strong>
</p>
<h1>
I would like to propose to the mods of this subreddit and every other surgery reddit that all &#34;glowing reviews&#34; of Rumer should be immediately flagged and deleted. Even if its a legit patient. Between her blatant dishonesty and astroturfing and her attempt to silence her own patients using right wing lawyers and an anti LGBTQ judge. (See below) Rumer has lost the right to conduct business on our grounds.
</h1>
<p>
Want me to shut up about Dr. Rumer? I want to shut up but unfortunately that&#39;s not an option when Rumer is still roping in unfortunate souls through her astroturfing of Google and for those who are unaware of the &#34;invaluable service&#34; Dr. Kathy Rumer has provided the trans community. Here is a list.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dr. Kathy Rumer’s atrocities, dishonesty, and disregard for the safety and well being of her patients include but are not limited to:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rumer attempts to silence two of her low income trans patients through a SLAPP suit. Rumer used a right-wing affiliated transphobic legal team and brought the case before an anti-LGBTQ Trump appointed judge:

</a>
</p>
<p>
Rumer on record threatening journalists and doctors with her right-wing lawyer:

</a>
</p>
<p>
Rumer’s staff ignore the patient&#39;s chart, prescribe medication which could be fatal to the patient:

</a>
</p>
<p>
Rumer botches FTM patient, Rumer’s staff frequently misgendered the patient:
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/xjb0ogd.png">https://i.imgur.com/xjb0ogd.png
</a>
</p>
<p>
Rumer denies patient surgical follow up care because of negative review (transcript at bottom of page):

</a>
</p>
<p>
Rumer ghosts patient after major complication, later instructs patient to cut off dangling labia with scissors:

</a>
</p>
<p>
Rumer casually admits to going through patients&#39; medical records in order to witch hunt her detractors and labels her own patients as “transphobic trolls:”

When I was on PA medicade looking for bottom surgery they told me Rumer and mt saini were the only surgeon sites that they paid for.
</p>
<p>
Mt saini is legit but I couldn&#39;t stop laughing at the Rumer one.
</p>
<p>
The transcare service person had no idea why I had such a reaction.

I don&#39;t know about PA Medicaid, but Bluebond is at NYU Langone. Avanessian, Ting, and Horesh are at Mt Sinai.

The problem with people in Philly is they are geographically near enough Rumer they are going to try to make you go to her. Sinai is only an option on PA medicaid for those more than 50 miles away from Rumers hospital.

We have a solid ground firewall in Philly against Rumer though. Mazzoni has silently blacklisted her, they no longer list her in their surgeons directory or let her attend the annual trans health conference. On top of that Everyone from the William Way Center to every trans support group was very supportive to our cause and let us distribute our flyers. Coordinators of said groups actively warn people against going to Rumer. We spread the flyers around every major university from Drexel, UPenn, to Temple. We have also been getting therapists in the area to blacklist her. They won&#39;t write a letter if the patient is planning on going to Rumer and will actively warn said patients. We have also expanded into Delaware. Christiana was very supportive and will actively discourage patients from going to Rumer.
</p>
<p>
I also want to mention that a good number of Mazzoni employees past and present signed our
<a href="https://www.change.org/p/kathy-rumer-must-resign?recruiter=1273154371&amp;recruited_by_id=e0ccb890-15aa-11ed-8e8a-1139b8c2be18&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">petition
</a>
against Rumer. Anyone can sign this petition and it has gone a long way in getting organizations and therapists to drop their support for Rumer.
</p>
<p>
With this said. Rumer has been having to prey on people in rural areas and out of state. We took Philly away from Dr. Rumer.

I&#39;m glad to hear Mazzoni is on board and making sure more people don&#39;t get hurt.
</p>
<p>
Do you know if there&#39;s other platforms that would be willing to join? I know she&#39;s plastered on the front page of the main top surgery resource website.

I&#39;m down to stage a campaign to get her pulled from that. The trick is flooding their inbox enmasse with community support. We will have to organize this.

Yeah apparently they do and there&#39;s one in Philly since then.
</p>
<p>
I was to big for mt.saini so they were off the table for me. PA medicaid in general is pretty awesome. They just couldn&#39;t help me with bottom surgery so I went ACA and went to Ramineni in DC as he he had no issue with my size.

I remember telling my insurance why Rumer was an unacceptable option after I got my first denial letter, and the person I spoke to over the phone was stunned since they had no idea any of that was going on.

This is what needs to happen. Any insurance company working with her needs to be made aware. And what OP wrote was a beautiful example of what they need to see.

I agree that even genuine positive reviews should be removed from the sub. It’s fantastic if someone did actually have a good experience with her but it’s irresponsible to recommend this doctor to anyone.

She botches most of her patients just because some people get good results does not mean she should be promoted in any way

Yep. And the fact that she held a stranglehold of fear over the trans community where patients and other surgeons were too terrified to speak out against her fearing litigation. When she followed through with one of her threats and collaborated with right wingers to terrorize two of her own patients she stopped being a trans ally and more of a tyrant.
</p>
<p>
She worked with the same fucking people who are actively trying to roll back our rights to preserve her image and her cashflow. There is absolutely no coming back from that morally. What she did was indefensible.
</p>
<p>
This medical grifter doesn&#39;t belong in our spaces and since WPATH and our medical system won&#39;t hold her accountable, we need to make sure she is banished from our communities. We can only beat her through a war of attrition and deprive her of as many patients as possible.

Too bad, I&#39;m going to propose it anyway. Her practice cannot be allowed to thrive much less exist.
