<p>
Either way gonna skip dilating tonight due to the amount of blood I just saw.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To paraphrase every SRS surgeon I‚Äôve seen (including my own): ‚ÄúUnder no circumstances skip dilating!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm at the 4.5 week mark and I‚Äôve also noticed a slight increase in bleeding. I‚Äôve had some wound separation but no silver nitrate.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if it‚Äôs just part of the healing / stitches dissolving process?

This is what I&#39;m wondering. I skipped dilating the other night cause I fell asleep - woke up worried the next morning and dilating was as easy as ever.   I probly should dilate, and may still, but will give the blood time to stop. Seems to happen when I go and just sit on the toilet - but this last visit it was the most blood id seen since before surgery even!

I‚Äôm four and a bit weeks post op too and had blood in my urine a couple of times last week and also bleeding during dilation. My surgeon suggested this is likely due to having granulation inside the vagina. I‚Äôm going in for treatment tomorrow (silver nitrate I assume) but he did say to keep dilating as usual

Thank you. I think im noticing its when I sit on the toilet the most - maybe having to wipe up after the act could be causing it?  I will keep dilating as it doesn&#39;t bleed when I do that it seems.

I spoke with my surgeon and he said keep doing what I&#39;m doing and scheduled me for a checkup on Wednesday. He isn&#39;t too concerned but since I seemed to be he wants to make sure all is well.

Update:  saw my surgeon today, 2 weeks early S I wasn&#39;t sposed to go back for 3 weeks. My wound separation is definetly the cause. He silver nitrated the area pretty intensely (my goodness was I sore coming home (1 long trip each way)) and instead of 3 week in between checkups I&#39;m on weekly for the next 3 weeks until this is resolved.
</p>
<p>
I still have not gone to the next size dilator, was sposed to next week at my PT visit but she&#39;s overbooked and I dont ha e my appt yet for that. Totally not sure when I&#39;ll be going to the #2 dilator at this time.

I am sorry you had to deal with bleeding and wound separation. I experienced the same thing until over second month. I was so anxious that I had  to see my therapist to deal with anxiety and depression. It is going to be okay. It was hard for me to hear that when my surgeon and therapist assured me because looking at my swollen vulva almost every hour made me feel worse. Fast forward 3.5 months, wound separation is totally healed. There‚Äôs still pain but bearable. Doctors say to keep dilating even when there‚Äôs bleeding. I believe them but in my case I listened to my body because I know it more than anyone else. My body knew that it wouldn‚Äôt heal fast if I dilated three times a day. I reduced it to twice a day then once a day and all the wound separation got better. When I felt that it was time to do dilation twice, I did. I am much better now and I thank God I listened to my body.
</p>
<p>
Sending you love and prayers for healing.

Aww thank you!  I must admit I dont have any pain from it. I had two but the other side is pretty well healed already. This one seemed to open up after the other healed. Anyhow, even dilating isn&#39;t painful - theres more pleasure to it than anything.  I feel this one will heal quick too - its already 50% better than it was on Saturday. Bleeding is down by about that much as well.   At this point the only thing that bugs me is the aesthetics of what the wound separation will leave behind, since it is more on the outside leading I to the canal.
</p>

I didnt dilate my 2nd time today because of the amount of silver nitrate on the area (Nd the gauze loaded with thay and a brownish grossness....)  figure instead of washing the nitrate away I&#39;d leave it to sit and be as effective as possible for as long as possible. Dilating on my current dilator is easy - slides right in and out so I think im not at worry of much loss by missing one session here or there.  I actually think im more than ready for the next size at this point...

Good to hear.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I didn‚Äôt wash til the next day when I was silver nitrated and granulation healed fast after that but I needed to wait 3 months before my surgeon did the silver nitrate. I thought that I didn‚Äôt have to suffer that long. They could have done it earlier when I told them about the granulation, well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Interesting - I can see a few weeks after surgery but not 3 months. I think I had silver nitrate on my first checkup - maybe 2.5 or 3 weeks after surgery.
