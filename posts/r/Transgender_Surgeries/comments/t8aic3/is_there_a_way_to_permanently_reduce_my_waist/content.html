I am so dysphoric about my waist. I know many cis woman have wide waists as well, but I just can‚Äôt stop the urge to push in my ribcage with my hands. I‚Äôm just absolute pain every day when I see myself in the mirror. I don‚Äôt even have to see myself, I can feel myself and my masculinity. The pain of that is just so overwhelming and heart-wenching.
</p>
<p>
Can corset training do it? Or any other procedures to give me a smaller waist? I want my waist to be around 24-28 inches. I think my current waist size is over 30.

Corsets are pretty amazing but the results are semi-permanant. With that said though i tight laced for like a month a while ago and my waist still seems smaller to me.
</p>
<p>
Part of it is HRT though. Muscle and fat takes longer than people think to find its new home and the waist is one region where it can be somewhat dramatic. So give it time if it is early days or try corseting because its cool af or do both idk.

Corset training will help. Rib removal doesn&#39;t always remove the ribs sometimes they just cut and reposition them so they&#39;re permanently in the position they would be in if you were wearing a corset.
</p>
<p>
But aside from corsetry and rib surgery, liposuction in worth considering. It&#39;s less expensive.

So in rib surgery, can the surgeon remove only the bottom ribs, or can they reshape the middle as well?

It&#39;s just the bottom three.
</p>
<p>
Also you have wear a corset for 2 months while they heal in their new position.

Corset training is semi permanent, you need to keep it up for a while, and it‚Äôll be a month or 2 before you see results. Keep in mind that corset training is sorta difficult imho. It‚Äôs def not the comfiest thing in the world to wear and you need to wear it for hours upon hours everyday.

Lipo 360 with BBL will take several inches off your waist and add it to your booty/hips. It‚Äôs a very feminizing procedure for the body contour. Many excellent docs perform them in Miami for a cost ranging from  $5,000-13,000 appx. It is also covered on many insurance plans for trans women.

Brutal is the word. I had one in Miami and they didn‚Äôt give me any pain meds when I woke up. The nurses at the surgery center just literally watched me sob for 30min and then wheeled me to an Uber where my boyfriend was waiting.
</p>
<p>
In the hotel room I slept face-down on puppy pads and had 2 iv infusions from a private duty nurse. For 3 days my body shed fluid from the lipo incisions.
</p>
<p>
9 days after the surgery we flew home and I was super paranoid about sitting the whole time. Lots of shooting pains in the lipo areas (torso) for a month afterward. Many expensive lymphatic drainage massages.
</p>
<p>
Can‚Äôt argue with the results though. Lost 4 inches from the waist and gained 5 inches on the hips/butt. Measurements went from 42-36-41 to 42-32-46‚Ä¶. 42-30-46 in the tight faja.

A lot of cis women really like him, but he is not trans saavy nor would I consider him an ally. He seemed like he was annoyed by my presence and acted like he was doing me a favor. He told me he had only operated on a handful of trans women, and that I was ‚Äúone of the best‚Äù he‚Äôd seen and ‚Äúvery convincing‚Äù. üòë
</p>
<p>
Also, he said I needed to have stopped my estrogen before the surgery and added a bunch of scary stuff about blood clots. He seemed really insistent and upset about this and for a moment I thought he was going to cancel, but we went ahead and did it after he looked at my labs and everything looked healthy and normal.
</p>
<p>
The result was aesthetically OK. I came into the waiting room very early and they pushed me back until the end of the day. He was not thorough with the lipo. There was some change but less than I wanted. He didn‚Äôt do much with my hips. Most of the fat went to my glutes, and a significant amount was absorbed over the years since then.
</p>
<p>
But it did make a significant difference. I‚Äôm glad I got it done, but I wish I had gone to a Colombian surgeon. Unfortunately my Spanish skills were lacking at the time.
</p>
<p>
Next month I have a second round scheduled that includes rib resection and an inverse tummy tuck.

Can you explain why you don&#39;t want rib removal? They only remove the floating ribs.
