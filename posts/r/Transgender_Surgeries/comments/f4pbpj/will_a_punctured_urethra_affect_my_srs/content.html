I&#39;ll be asking the surgeon in a month, btw.

During ffs they &#39;missed&#39; with the catheter and close to the prostate they poked through the urethra.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s supposed to heal, and the blood has almost stopped, but will scar tissue there mean SRS complications?

Urethral trauma will usually lead to some form of stricture due to scarring, and thus complicate things a bit, but that&#39;s really different for every case, and it&#39;s nothing that can&#39;t be fixed. You&#39;ll have a catheter in after the surgery anyway.

Really hope they didn&#39;t poke anything else, like my prostate or bladder wall. ðŸ˜’
</p>
<p>
They said I had a stricture going in.  They hadn&#39;t had this happen in 10 years.

With the bladder being a muscle, it&#39;s much more resilient than the urethra. The prostate is spongy tissue and also really hard to puncture. You&#39;ll pull through. Just make sure to tell your healthcare providers about any problems/pain when urinating.

I doubt that it will affect your srs very much. It sounds like the damaged part of your urethra is in between your bladder and where your urethra will be after surgery. If there is an adhesion this would probably be the time to take care of it anyway.  Just remember to tell your surgeon before surgery so they are aware that youâ€™ve had trauma to that area of your body. You should be fine.

Yeah, I have a meeting with my surgeon in a month, we&#39;ll discuss it.
</p>
<p>
Wish my urologist here would say the exact location, but I was under when he rolled through

I had a Prince Albert piercing down there and they said it was no big deal and was able just to cut and suture it closed. I know it&#39;s not the same but that&#39;s my insight.
