So, looking at srs and given I&#39;m in Aus, Thailand is a good option. However my wife is quite nervous about having major surgery overseas (fair really). I&#39;m trying to get a handle on medical care in Thailand, which I understand to be very good and closely equivalent to Australia. However, I&#39;m looking for clear details to reassure my wife that the risk are not too high

What details are you looking for? From personal experience, I had GCS, FFS and breast augmentation in the one visit (over two days). I used Dr Chetttawut and his clinic care was fantastic and the theatre appeared first class imho. Four days after surgery, I moved to a local hotel with daily nurse visits for another 18 days and that was also well managed. I believe he will soon move his surgery to a local hospital (WIH International), so I can only assume that offers even better patient care. I feel all the results are excellent. Feel free to send a PM.

It can be risky having surgery in Thailand, just like it is in Australia if you pick the wrong surgeon. Luckily there&#39;s tons of information on some Thai surgeons. There&#39;s plenty in the wiki here.

Surgeries in Thailand are as good as Australia except some surgeons are better with far more experience. I personally wouldnt go to either of the two Australian surgeons however lots of my girlfriends have mainly because of COVID.  Im currently waiting for travel restrictions to lift and I&#39;ll be off, can leave now but wouldnt get back in, so thats an issue.

Hi there,
</p>
<p>
I use the Kamol hospital in Thailand and after a lot of research i have found them to be the best, after getting touch with them i soon realised my suspicions were right they really are the best, they will help you through the whole process even down to the visas, COE&#39;s  and just checking up on you to make sure your ok with everything. They really are truly amazing and defiantly worth a look, if you get in touch you want to speak with Darcie silver she&#39;s the most amazing person and very knowledgeable. Trust me make contact you wont be disappointed

Are you representing Kamol? Commercial activity/advertising on this sub is not allowed. See rule 6.
</p>
<p>
And are you the same person representing Kamol who was here a few weeks ago?
</p>
<p>
<em>
Edit: This user is promoting Kamol and has made other accounts to do so. They are now posting the same material that the Kamol representative did a few weeks ago. These accounts are Kamol-Hospital, ChrissyJ1978, transwoman42, are all banned from this sub. I have just copied the comments I am replying to into my replies to preserve them.

no sorry, im just sharing my experiences i believe that if there is a good word to say about something or someone then why not say it. Ive had a really good experience with them and im happy to tell people so they may have the same experience. having SRS is a one shot deal there are too many &#34;back street surgeons&#34; out there, i would want my fellow transgender sisters/brothers to have a fighting chance of being happy.

You appear to be here for the sole purpose of promoting Dr Kamol, and this is not the first time it’s happened with him. If your keep doing it your going to get banned from this sub.

There are 21k members on this sub and no one else is posting like you are. I don’t know who you are or why you are here. I can only go on what I see, and what I see is very unusual and suspicious.

Reddit is a big place with lots of trans resources. Try taking part in it.

like i say i can only and will only give my opinion on what i know to be fact, i would never just say things for the sake of it. i have only had experience with Kamol hospital and i will sing their praises with the sole intention of helping others. Us transgender people stick together and i love to help people. I have many groups on FB and i help people there, and its normally appreciated. Knowledge is power and all

Have you been looking for a surgeon yet? I am Thai, I have experience in SRS surgery with Dr.Kanit Wittayavanichai in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
In SRS surgery I have a lot of questions that come up after the surgery. Doctors and nurses give me great advice.
</p>
<p>
But in the case of your abroad, I am not sure about the procedure before the surgery. You can ask for the procedure first.
