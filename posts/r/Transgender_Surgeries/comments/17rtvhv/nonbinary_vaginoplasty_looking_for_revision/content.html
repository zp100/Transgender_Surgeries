It&#39;s still healing.  It takes about a year for all the scarring to improve.  It will look better a few months from now.

That is true. I figure I have no idea when I would be able to get a revision (could be 3 months, could be 6 who knows) so figure it wouldn&#39;t hurt to include in my list as if it is the latter then 9months should be enough to give me an idea as the swelling should be gone by then ya know.
</p>
<p>
But i am a bit self conscious about them since they have my labia on low poly potatoe mode :/

For reference,  my surgery is coming up in January. When I asked the nurse about recommended scar treatments, her answer was that we would consider a revision at six months if it was an issue.
</p>
<p>
All of that&#39;s to say, I wouldn&#39;t worry about how everything looks until you&#39;re at least six months out.

I definitely get that, but the idea is I&#39;m already looking at revision to address a few things so seeing as it would take some time scheduling and such, by the time I am there it will be beyond that.
</p>
<p>
The scar is kinda on the lower end of needs. The area around my clit, possibly my fourschette and canal are of higher priority.

Hi, there&#39;s a transphobic account on Twitter posting about trans people and making fun of their surgeries and deadnamong them intentionally.  I&#39;m trying to spread the word to the people who they posted about and others so it dosent happen to them. The Twitter account is @ Phytophilia1 (I put a space between the @ and user incase she has the same username on her so it dosent tag her)

I am feeling a good bit better about it at the moment though ðŸ¥°
</p>
<p>
The swelling is going down further. It&#39;s not totally flat yet and still a bit asym but better.
</p>
<p>
Got a doctor to administer regular silver nitrate so I&#39;m getting help with that and I&#39;m having more days where I&#39;m not bleeding, granted I&#39;m being ultra careful, so that should mean more days of forward progress ðŸ¥°
</p>
<p>
Still may need the fourchette revised and obviously still want that canal swapped but uh I have a consultation for the canal with a different doctor in June with a maybe end of year 2024 destination and the fourchette and such will depend on finances as I am struggling with a housing crises atm but hopefully it&#39;s atleast not a problem come the 6month mark cause that would mean it&#39;s a major problem.

Many questions.. 1 how long ago? 2 is the wounds still healing ? I know there closed but it takes time for things to flatten, all swelling to go away etc. 3 asking if your loosing weight? I am not telling you to, and im not some one to talk.. Some of us look better with some meat on us, it&#39;s really your preference.  Like my bf loves that im not a 120lb weakling and compliments me .. I did go from 320 to 250 but idk if I&#39;m going any less.. If you are loosing I would wait to check how healing goes before a revision 4 laser treatment for scar tissue.. definitely year after, Or 2. I had  abdominal surgery 8&#34; scar on my belly. As I&#39;m going for laser to prep for srs, I pay by the 1/2 hour where I go. I&#39;m doing the whole bikini area. Then to finish the time. She goes over my scar.. it&#39;s becoming so light, and not so stiff.. it&#39;s something to look into..

Aug 22nd  was my surgery date.  I had some dehiscence along the lower end of my labia. And a minor separation of my fourchette. So those are lagging a bit behind everything else.
</p>
<p>
I am not looking to lose weight. Ima bear, and I like it that way.

ðŸ’— I love that.. I hope you heal up well, and remember about laser when that time comes.. I had no idea they could help with scars. I thought I&#39;d have this huge nasty scar forever or have to get a tattoo over it..

Yeah I may be ok but these scars are pretty grovy so I&#39;m not sure. I think it&#39;s more likely than not they need work.
</p>
<p>
But it&#39;s one of the lower priorities. My clit and canal are the higher priorities followed by my fourchette.
