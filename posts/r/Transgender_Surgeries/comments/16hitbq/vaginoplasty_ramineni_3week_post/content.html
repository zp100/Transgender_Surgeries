You might want to look into getting some perineal cold packs.  They are most typically used by cis women following childbirth or other trauma to vulva, and are filled with a gel that I find less irritating than normal ice packs.  They also have a washable sleeve that they fit into, so you don&#39;t need to worry about wrapping a wash cloth or towel around the ice for protection.  Bonus - they can be warmed up if you need a little heat therapy, and they are flexible so they can be used on other parts of the body fairly easily.  Got mine from Amazon.
</p>
<p>
BTW - from what I can see, it looks like you are healing well.  Congratulations on being on the other side!  ðŸ’œðŸ’œ

I did get a few and then i left them in my hotel in DC by mistake. I have some other really decent ones I been using since I got home.

Thank you ðŸ¥° I was scared as the stitching undid themselves but I had a solid wound care routine so nothing got infected. Just trying to find out when I should start with the silicone gel.
