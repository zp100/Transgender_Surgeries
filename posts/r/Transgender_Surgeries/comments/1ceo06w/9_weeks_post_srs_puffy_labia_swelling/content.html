Beware of &#39;mine was much less swollen at 4 weeks&#39; responses. We all heal and recover at different rates. And final results depend on many factors unique to each person, such as fat and water content, skin elasticity, blood flow, etc. Swelling can take up to four months to abate, and it takes up to a year for complete tissue healing and settling.
</p>
<p>
FWIW, I&#39;m almost 4 months, and I still have quite &#39;full&#39; labia. I was grumbling about this until a cis female friend pointed out that I am carrying more body fat than I normally do due to inactivity post-surgery, and showed me how hers also &#39;swell&#39; at the bottom when she picks up weight.

That’s a very good point, thank you.  I’ve always had quite a fatty mons pubis regardless of weight, and always held weight in very… curvy? ways. So it may be that this is just how my genetics are and I would’ve had a fatter labia majora if cis.

Yes - I keep coming back to my mantra of &#39;the most natural result is the best result&#39;.  Ifyou haven&#39;t already, I recommend taking a look at The Great Wall of Vulva - it&#39;s a great way of showing the natural huge variation of anatomy.

I&#39;m 9 months out and still have discharge. Its going to keep happening until everything is fully healed, including granulation tissue (I still have some deep inside). But it will slow down as you heal. At 9 weeks I was still wearing maxipads a lot of the time.
</p>
<p>
The swelling looks like a lot. That looks like where my swelling was at at 4 weeks.

Good to know the discharge will likely go away more as the granulation tissue gets treated!   I don’t really mind large labia, plenty of cis vaginas have bigger outer labia, it’s just frustrating when trying to get a look inside and it rubs quite a bit when walking

It uses the inside part of the scrotal sack for extra material and other benefits that escape me right now

I’m not sure I’m comfortable sharing which country I got it done in and with which surgeon as I’ve specifically highlighted a minor issue, and not given a full account of how overall happy I am with the result. I don’t want any surgeon in any country to be viewed unfavourably just because of one negatively framed question.

Yeah idk why people&#39;s first response to a simple question about a minor issue is to try figuring out which surgeon you went to. You&#39;re looking good imo, just a bit swollen. And that&#39;s not really something that&#39;s avoidable with any surgeon. Like, knowing the surgeon you went to isn&#39;t going to make the info in any answer any more helpful. There&#39;s no point in sharing unless you want to because the people asking are trying to use your post as indicative of a surgeon&#39;s work and not much else.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen this exchange happen
<em>
a lot
</em>
on here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Looks off, what surgeon did you go to?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[OP says what surgeon they went to]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I see, that&#39;s unfortunate. [Surgeon] was one of the options I was considering. Hope you&#39;re able to get help with this!
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Like, it doesn&#39;t help anyone, and tells me that people who are concerned with which surgeon everyone uses don&#39;t really care to help with people&#39;s issues, they just want to know which surgeons they don&#39;t want to go to based on a few pics on a subreddit where people are more likely to post about issues they have.

I completely agree. One result from one surgery isn’t going to be the same as the next one. Every patient is different and every result and healing is going to be different. My community needs to understand that. If one very good surgeon has ONE bad result it’s game over and that surgeon is going to be shamed of the rest of their life and the entire community is hurt because of it because now they have one less surgeon that cares for them. you look AMAZING!
