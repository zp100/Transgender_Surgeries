Cannot get ahold of Dr. Rizvi or either of his two assistants. I&#39;ve left messages and emails almost a month ago, and have followed up. My insurance approval is only granted for a few months. I&#39;m about to just move on and try another doctor. I kind of want hear from anyone who has had work with Dr. Rizvi, but I might already be over the unprofessionalism....

Don&#39;t trust yourself to surgery with a doctor who can&#39;t even respond to emails.

I think youre right. I do not mind waiting on a procedure, but the lack of communication for so long is odd. Thanks

Don’t go with him! I’ve used him for 2 surgeries, bbl &amp; ffs. Biggest mistake of my life &amp; now having to get his mistakes fixed elsewhere. I’ll eventually make my own post here, even considering making it my first YouTube video

So far I love my results…. Had my surgery April 17th so I’m still fresh out a few weeks. I’m still very recognizable but the female version of my old self. Which is what wanted because I feel less is more. Will probably make a post of my before and after when I’m a few months healed. I personally have had no issue with wait times or the awesome staff. My advice is just stay optimistic, patient, and understand these people are VERY busy assisting others who desperately want the same services.
