first two photos are before the revision. Last three are post op. Second photo pre op and fourth photo post op show me when aroused.
</p>
<p>
My original vaginoplasty was back in 2018. Classic penile inversion. I had major wound dehiscence and infection that I tried to tell my surgery team about, but they brushed it off. It left me with a very asymmetrical result. I had a revision for the aesthetics and it wasn’t really all that either. I still had lack luster depth, like 2.5-3 inches.
</p>
<p>
I’m bisexual and while I prefer women, I have a lot of romantic and sexual encounters are with cis men. So I wanted something operational. In addition I had leftover tissue that would engorge and resembled a very angry vagina. At times, it felt like an erected penile stump.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t want the skin graft because it left a huge scar. Also, peritoneal tissue use has become popular and it has some advantages.
</p>
<p>
I was talking to the major doctors who do PPT surgery, but their wait list was very long. So I found Dr.Jun and heard he even trained under the doctors I planned to had gone to. I was honestly scared because he had no results posted other than a study he did with BBL and Zhao.
</p>
<p>
He was very sweet, great bedside manners. He’s also easy on the eyes which is a bonus. Very easy to talk to.
</p>
<p>
During my revision I had a peritoneal flap made to extend my vagina. Relaxing incisions to reduce the tightness in my vagina. Labiaplasty and urtheroplasty, which has greatly reduced swelling thank GOD (or I guess Jun in this instance lmaoo). Clitoral hood revision. I can fit the last dot in blue. I still have some tension that might need to be addressed in another surgery but for now averaged sized dick and reasonable strap. Which sucks when you’re a size queen lol.
</p>
<p>
I have quite a bit of discharge but this is something I heard is common. And went from 2.75 inches to about 5 inches.
</p>
<p>
I’m very happy with what I have esp considering what I started with. I want a little more work done on the aesthetics but for now I’ll just relax.

A few questions.
</p>
<p>
Who was the original surgeon?
</p>
<p>
Is the erectile tissue problem fixed?
</p>
<p>
What did it cost?
</p>

I’ll PM you

<p>
Yes. The fourth photo is me aroused and slightly engorged. I still get some blood Pool, but now it’s puffy and not so much hard. Nor is it as big, look as weird or feel as uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
My mom had some major blood work studies and I’m on family insurance, so it’s all been payed for my insurance. I got a bill from the hospital for a stay, and it’s like $2K but I’m gonna either fight it with insurance or apply for financial assistance (I currently do non profit work so I’m not rich lol)

Your results look great! I also have a lot of uncomfortable erectile tissue and some issues with my labia and clitoral hood, it&#39;s good to see revisions like this go well. May I ask if you know how they did the clitoral hood revision? I&#39;m not sure if I have enough tissue since I basically have no hood and a large clit to cover. I was just wondering if they just pull the surrounding tissue closer or what if you happen to know. And may I ask how much downtime it took/is taking compared to the initial surgery? I may stick with my minimal depth partially because of that. Thank you for sharing and I hope things continue to go well!

Down time is a lot less down town. But I made sure to get in real good shape. I was in the hospital one night. I had packing in a little less than a week. I was a little weak the first 4.5 weeks, but coming up on 6 I’m really feeling my energy. I was weak 2.5 months from original SRS but I had major complications. I had tissue that made up some of what clitoral hood and he pinched it together

Thank you! That&#39;s good to hear, it would be super hard to be as incapacitated again as the first time, and for so long. Good luck with the rest of your recovery!

That is a great improvement! My favorite is 5, it gives some good context. It&#39;s hard to get a good idea with some photos people post so I appreciate the variety offered. I didn&#39;t realize arousal would change aesthetics. Something to consider now i guess.
