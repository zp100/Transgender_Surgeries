My carry-on with my dilators was flagged for inspection by the TSA. A TSA agent wearing gloves took them out and started looking at them. I noticed her turning it around and examining it. At that point I chimed in with, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre medical vaginal dilators‚Äù at which point she carefully and awkwardly put them back in the case, put the case in my bag and sent me on my way. Unless you‚Äôre going through customs I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.

I had a newbie TSA agent at the body scanner, and (against policy) she points to my pre-op groin area on the display and asks me loudly, &#34;What&#39;s this?!?&#34;
</p>
<p>
instinctively (wanting to tell the truth), I respond just as loud in answer,
<strong>
&#34;It&#39;s my Penis, I still have one!&#34;
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Newbie agent simply
<em>
froze in place.
</em>
I thought it was hilarious.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never seen a supervisor run so fast to bail her trainee out, and the usual trace detection patdown was by procedure.

My surgeon gave me a letter stating that they were medical devices, mainly for the Bangkok airport since sex toys are illegal in Thailand. It might be good to have something similar, just in case, but all 3 airports I went through just kind of looked at them for a bit and moved on.

Beware passing through (and possibly avoid) Islamic countries and transit hubs like Dubai, too.  Check where you change planes

Our sex shops all have a large sign that states all items are sold as novelty items and are not intended to be used on or in a person&#39;s body. Lingerie is sold as adult novelty costumes.

Idk, the culture is really different, definitely not dystopian overall though. I wouldn‚Äôt let it impact surgeon choices though, surgeon skill is unrelated to their country‚Äôs laws.
</p>
<p>
Everyone I met while I was there was super super kind though.

I put them in my carry on in a giant ziplock bag with a label ‚Äú these go in vagina!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
TSA stops my bag , pulls out the ziplock and reads the label.  You could see her lip the words ‚ÄúNOPE‚Äù and places the ziplock back into my bag.

I flew from the US to Mexico and back with dilators. They were only questioned once and I simply stated they were post surgical medical devices. The agent didn‚Äôt say a word, closed the bag and that was the end of that.

This happened to me recently.  If they go in my carry on my bag WILL be pulled aside for inspection.  TSA agent pulled them out of my bag and asked what they were and I said,  &#34;Those are my vaginal dilators.&#34; She blinked a few times,  but then back in my bag and let me go

I am very active in the BDSM community and have traveled with far more - interesting - items in my carry on.  No way I am going to risk having those things lost or stolen in checked bags.  Nothing that could be interpreted as a weapon or serious risk to flight safety of course, but far from the typical contents.
</p>
<p>
The few times they have questioned the contents of my bag, I simply give them a very concise picture of what it is for.  Usually, they just get a bit pale, put things back in the bag and wish me well on my travels.  I did have one agent get &#39;that look&#39; in their eyes, and had we been in a different situation I have no doubt that we would have gone much further down the rabbit hole.
</p>
<p>
Once I have my surgery next year, the dilators will be no different.  If the agent does their job quietly and professionally, no worries.  If they choose to make a scene, then I am all too happy to play my part.  I won&#39;t be combative with them, but I won&#39;t be embarrassed into silence either.
</p>
<p>
Now, when traveling to locations of known hostility or overly restrictive laws, I will temper things appropriately.  A little research up front can go a long way toward avoiding problems in the moment.
</p>
<p>
Safe travels to all - now and in the future.  üíúüíú

My personal experience, they won&#39;t say a word as its embarrassing to them and you. I only went through once with them in a carryon because I didn&#39;t check a bag. They saw them in the X-ray, pulled me aside, opened my bag, saw them for what they are, looked at me and nodded and said you have a lovely day ma&#39;am.
</p>
<p>
Also, pack them in your check in bag - I travel a LOT and have never had any issue with them losing my Bob&#39;s or my dialators. I always worry they&#39;ll see my rechargeable vibrators and go rummaging through my suitcase but that has never appeared to happen.

The dialators are unlikely to be a danger to others and are unlikely weapons, so TSA should have no problems for domestic US travel.

Well... I suppose if you were to try and dilate while on the flight, and then had to sneeze or cough hard, they *could* be considered projectiles. ü§£
</p>
<p>
But since none of us (( hope) would do such a thing, then yeah - not weapons.
</p>
<p>
&lt;sorry... I couldn&#39;t resist&gt;

You‚Äôre Trans and just had an amazingly life affirming surgery. Simply tell them what they are if they ask. There is zero shame in that and you‚Äôll never see those people again.  Congrats on such a momentous part of your journey ‚ù§Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

My experience with TSA and my dilators was bad.  I was in tears before the whole ordeal ended.
</p>
<p>
You can ask to have a woman search your bag that might help.
</p>
<p>
I also had my surgeon‚Äôs letter with everything the TSA agents didn‚Äôt even bother to read it.
</p>
<p>
Expect to be humiliated and embarrassed.   TSA workers are not law enforcement but in welfare jobs.

They attempt to embarrass me or put me in tears and I will embarrass them and put them in tears as well. These people can‚Äôt even find fake bombs placed in luggage by their supervisors for Washington D.C. What makes them think they can bully transgender people around? Just for the hell of it? They don‚Äôt bully everyone else in the same manner.

Let it out of your sight and it can get lost or broken in various ways.

I take the one I‚Äôm going to use and put it in the bag with my toiletries. I guess I don‚Äôt travel a ton, I‚Äôve flown 8 times since my surgery, but no issues yet.

I always bring my dilators in my hand luggage, being afraid to lose them. This has always been fine on international flights. I travelled from Amsterdam to Dallas in November without any problems there, too.
