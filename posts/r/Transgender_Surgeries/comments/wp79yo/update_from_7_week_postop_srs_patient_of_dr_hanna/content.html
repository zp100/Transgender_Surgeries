<p>
I am 6&#39;0&#34; tall, weighed in at 152 pounds last night, and have a BMI around 20. For my height I am very lean and Dr. Hanna set me a goal of being 160 pounds for surgery so I&#39;d have enough tissue to work with. I weighed in at 155 pounds the day of surgery and came out of the procedure not having as much tissue as would be ideal for the results.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I mean this in the nicest way possible, but just based on this information, it sounds like he is blaming you for the results that can be expected from his surgical technique. You weren&#39;t underweight going into surgery, and in fact I had the same BMI and limited donor material, and still have labia minora and a clitoral hood. I understand not wanting to blame the surgeon, and maybe it was just how your body healed, but it really sounds like he&#39;s looking for excuses.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s
<strong>
not
</strong>
to say that the surgery is a death sentence, or even that it&#39;s a horrible result in the context of a surgery that can never be perfect. Right now you should wait until you&#39;re healed, then evaluate then whether you need or want a revision. When that time comes, look through the wiki in the sidebar to choose a safe and experienced surgeon based on other patient reviews.
</p>
<p>
I also appreciate you taking the time to share the positives with the negatives. I think a lot of people think in black and white with this surgery when it&#39;s much more complicated.
</p>
<p>
Good luck :)

I&#39;ve never heard a surgeon mention tissue around the pelvic floor before so I can&#39;t really speak to that, but I can say that almost no surgeons mention BMI outside of the extremes (underweight or overweight) as having a large impact on the tissue available. Besides increasing the size of the fat pads and making the labia majora puffier, I can&#39;t see why a surgeon couldn&#39;t achieve decent results on a healthy patient. Re: vaginal tightness: this is pretty normal as far as I can tell. Scar tissue is contracting, the body isn&#39;t used to the vaginal canal, things will be tight. This isn&#39;t a reason to be concerned unless it persists for a long time and/or you lose depth and width despite diligent dilation.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m only saying this because you seem to be considering a revision with him:
<em>
if a surgeon can&#39;t get good results on a young, fairly healthy patient at a healthy weight, who can they get good results on?
</em>
I would really urge you to explore all your options and get opinions from other, well-reviewed surgeons before making a decision on who to see for revision. I&#39;m not considering revision in the U.S., but some names I see thrown around positively are Jun, McGinn, and Bluebond-Lagner. I would encourage you to seek out surgeons like that and ask their opinions on revision and whether your weight is to blame.

check out my post history for pics.
</p>
<p>
BMI ~14.2 (130 lb/5&#39; 10&#34;) at the time of surgery
</p>
<p>
Surgeon: Rumer
</p>
<p>
looks like your are doing a good job keeping everything clean and healing-wise post-op. however the focus of your weight seems a bit misplaced...the technique used by the surgeon plays more of a role in the outcome as aesthetic than the outcome. the notion that he would suggest your weight being a concern seems more like a red flag (to me) and a way to obfuscate blame on to patients. this is exactly the type of tactic Dr Rumer has used to gaslight her patients in to silence about their results.
</p>
<p>
It does not look like you have had any necrotic tissue damage so the results you are left with are due to his technique. It looks like his work on you seems surprisingly similar to the work Dr. Rumer does. I understand that his bedside manner have been phenomenal however those should be reflected on separately from the work. I invite you to take a moment and review the results of other surgeons that have been posted her, or take a few hours and scroll through the wiki.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best of luck and a speedy recovery.

Hi might be annoying be in a situation like this , you‚Äôre fragile you just had a major surgery which is a huge step in life , but it‚Äôs easy to acknowledge all the information specially here in the supportive group we here most have experience srs or are seeking it ! There‚Äôs no harm directly to the girls that has being fighting to make their dream true but yes the Doctors and their work !  All the design of you vagina is made of your penises  material and this has nothing to do with your weight !  I feel your moment and worries but for sure right now you can‚Äôt do nothing but wait and deff get a retouch with other surgeon with better skills ! I would not get a retouch with your accurate DR !  You will be fine there‚Äôs plenty options and seems she kept a very important thing which is your clitoris etc !  Stay well xx üòò

<p>
***Does weight affect the size of your Vulva?

<p>
Dr. Sherry Ross explains ‚ÄúWeight loss and weight gain can definitely change the appearance of your vagina, for better or worse,‚Äù Ross says. ‚ÄúLosing significant weight will reduce the size and shape of your mons and your outer labia, making your vagina look better and healthier.‚Äù***

U have the clitoris so that‚Äôs good news! U might need a revision later maybe not. You‚Äôll have to wait and see. But don‚Äôt worry a lot of people get revisions to get it just right. Having a working clit is most important. So u can orgasm.

For what it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôve had surgery with Dr Hannah and I have a great result.
</p>
<p>
Sounds like OP is happy with overall care and there are trolls being trolls. Girl, focus on healing and what your surgeon is telling you. Sounds like weight was a concern at the consult!!! This surgeon had the foresight ahead of time that your weight may be an issue‚Ä¶ so much experience to be able to tell you that ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to DM me anytime‚Ä¶ Reddit trolls are why we can‚Äôt have nice things. Some of these users started their acct 4 days ago, maybe just to trash. Hanna is actually the one of the best things to happen to this field in a long time!

I always hate to see people, who are clearly not surgeons, coming for his technique and your aesthetic. I had my preop with him and have seen quite a few of his results and they all have healed beautifully! In my preop he pulled out his phone and showed me a result that he snapped at a one week check up that was flawless! He didn‚Äôt LEARN his entire technique from Rumer. Yes he did his fellowship with her (he is also one of the FEW surgeons to actually complete a fellowship in this field!) and if any of these other people trying to have an ill informed opinion had actually been to him they would know he disagrees with her on a great deal of things! He also did another hands on training with renowned surgeon Dr. Miroslav Djordjevic, who practices in New York and Serbia and does PHENOMENAL WORK!!!!
</p>
<p>
He also talked to me about my BMI and said that he is glad that I am on the higher end, I‚Äôm a little curvy and I‚Äôm closer to 28 - 30 BMI, and has said that he has found that in the more than 200 vaginoplasty procedures he‚Äôs performed he has found that women on the higher end of healthy BMI typically have a better aesthetic result. THAT‚ÄôS NOT JUST HIM! That‚Äôs WPATH, that‚Äôs your PCP‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
Question for OP, in your IMGUR.. and with your post‚Ä¶ which is your most recent? Is this your most up to date photo? Because I can see that the structure he created for you in some of your imgur collage looks really good! Give yourself time‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
*OH YEAH AND HE‚ÄôS ALSO A UROLOGIST‚Ä¶. So I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd come for his knowledge of the structure of the vulva and vagina‚Ä¶

Well, it looks like he gave you a great structure and your sensation and dilation seem great! So keep up with what he‚Äôs telling you to do and I‚Äôm sure with time you‚Äôll heal beautifully ‚ù§Ô∏è my vaginoplasty is September 6th! Looking forward to your updates ‚ù§Ô∏è

I&#39;m just going to go over a few points for other people deciding on surgeons, this isn&#39;t meant to antagonize OP.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You don&#39;t need to be a surgeon to learn about techniques and aesthetic results. We have access to the internet, so there&#39;s no longer a need to simply trust that a surgeon knows how to deliver good results; you can check for yourself. You might not know the intricacies of
<em>
how
</em>
the results are achieved, nor do you need to. It&#39;s only important to know
<em>
that
</em>
the results are achieved.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
*OH YEAH AND HE‚ÄôS ALSO A UROLOGIST‚Ä¶. So I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd come for his knowledge of the structure of the vulva and vagina‚Ä¶
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, you also don&#39;t need to be a urologist to learn about the structure of the vulva and vagina. This information is all pretty easily accessible. You may not have the same level of understanding as someone who&#39;s trained in it, but for the purposes of choosing a surgeon, it&#39;s good enough. You only need enough knowledge to look at results and identify which structures were reconstructed well, and which ones weren&#39;t.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For those who aren‚Äôt bothering to look into this EXTREMELY QUALIFIED SURGEON
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m not disputing that qualifications like this can be important, but they should absolutely not be the only thing influencing a decision. Again, with the internet and especially this subreddit and wiki, you no longer have to trust a surgeon&#39;s qualifications to speak to whether or not they give good results; you can (and should) check the results yourself.
</p>
<p>
In the same vein, you also really shouldn&#39;t put all your stock in the results on a surgeon&#39;s website or what they show in consultations. These can obviously be cherry-picked, and while they can represent a surgeon&#39;s best work, they won&#39;t necessarily represent their average work. It&#39;s important to seek out results independently posted by patients to get a better sense.

You are absolutely NOT WRONG. However, none of what you represented makes you, or any of us a surgeon. You‚Äôve seen 1 maybe 2 examples of his work on Reddit out of hundreds of performed procedures.
</p>
<p>
Purporting to have even an iota of experience, enough to comment on surgical results, over an actual surgeon over Internet proficiency is just irresponsible IMO. I haven‚Äôt just seen a few of his results I‚Äôve seen MULTIPLE. At different stages because I haven‚Äôt just had a consultation. I‚Äôve spoken with his office. He‚Äôs called me when I have concerns and addressed these reddit threads with me when I‚Äôve brought them up‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
I am speaking from experience with this surgeon and where I think expressing concern about a sister is fine‚Ä¶ passing your opinion based on Google or Reddit is simply not responsible or an act of care.
</p>
<p>
The fact of the matter is that we aren‚Äôt surgeons, you haven‚Äôt performed hundreds of surgeries and each of us take this journey KNOWING complications are a possibility. It is careless to baselessly create doubt in anyone‚Äôs mind when we aren‚Äôt authorities.

I am 6ft and a quarter and I look healthy at 95kg. 160 pounds is like 72kg. That seems very lite to me. I wonder why your surgeon wanted you that thin.
