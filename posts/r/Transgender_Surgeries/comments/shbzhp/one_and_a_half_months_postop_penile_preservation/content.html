Yes. It&#39;s not common yet but it exists.
</p>
<p>
Google penile-preserving vaginoplasty or PPV.  Also check out
<a href="/r/salmacian">r/salmacian
</a>
, which is for discussion of specifically this procedure.

Just a note - that sub is for everyone who has/wants mixed or ambiguous genitalia, not just PPV. But it for sure has a lot of great info on the procedure!

*I can get four dots in. [Typo in image description]
</p>
<p>
Since my last post, I&#39;ve moved up to the blue dilator, 1Â¼&#34; diameter. I can get four dots. I can get five dots with the purple, which means I don&#39;t need the two smaller dilators anymore (small purple and small orange). It&#39;s a lot of work to get the blue in, but getting easier. It&#39;s best to refresh the lube every 10 minutes, otherwise it kind of dissipates and it&#39;s really hard to take the dilator out at the end.
</p>
<p>
I also had my first gynecology appointment. He said all the same things my surgeon said about the &#34;pee coming out of my vagina&#34; situation: it could heal on its own in a couple months or so, and nothing I&#39;m doing can affect it one way or another. Still scary, but I&#39;m optimistic. It seems like it&#39;s healing sometimes, and then opens up again. Hopefully going in the right direction over all though.
</p>
<p>
My gynecologist also wants me to start trying to establish a microbiome. I told him I&#39;m using 1tbsp hydrogen peroxide to 1cup water to douche, and he said add 1tbsp vinegar to that and take probiotics for vaginal health, so I&#39;ve made those changes. I&#39;m not sure how to tell if a microbiome is established though so just crossing my fingers.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still not allowed any sexual activity, but I&#39;ll post an update on that when I&#39;m allowed. Since several of you have asked, I&#39;ve gotten some erections (to my frustration), so that all works.

would it have been possible for you to get the labia when you originally got the surgery? or is the only option to go back for it?

Dr Wittenberg has attempted to do labia with the initial surgery on several patients (you can see some photos on her website), but all have required revision due to loss of definition in the first year. She has said this is probably due to swelling and erectile tissue, although I don&#39;t fully understand the mechanics of it personally.
</p>
<p>
I also had a consultation with Dr Avanessian a few months prior to surgery with Dr Wittenberg, and we went over some of Dr Wittenberg&#39;s work. Dr Avanessian saw some of the early post-op photos which included labiaplasty, and commented unprompted that they would definitely lose definition.
</p>
<p>
With these two respected professional opinions in agreement, I decided to postpone labiaplasty until after a full recovery from the primary vaginoplasty.

After seeing your stunner I&#39;m starting to lean towards penile preserving vaginoplasty to be able to have less stressful receptive sex at least for the meantime while I restore my foreskin

I&#39;m a bit confused. Wat donor material was used? I see you still have both your penis and scrotum so your entire sex organ was preserved, but what was the neovagina created from then? Purely abdominal lining?

<p>
All of the donor material was peritoneal tissue harvested from my abdomen. It was pulled down into the potential space to form a vaginal canal while maintaining its original blood supply, meaning that it is not technically a graft, and avoids a lot of the potential complications associated with grafts.
</p>
<p>
Peritoneal tissue is less stretchy than skin and (much like a natal vagina) doesn&#39;t have tactile sensation exactly, but I&#39;ve been progressively stretching it with the dilators and it definitely feels plenty (pressure, temperature, ...soreness). It&#39;s also very wet, which is awesome ðŸ’¦
</p>
<p>
The procedure is called &#34;peritoneal pull-through&#34; or &#34;peritoneal pull down&#34; or &#34;peritoneal flap&#34;.

Did you have an orchiectomy? Or were your penis and scrotum 100% unaffected? How did they create a vaginal cavity without affecting your scrotum?

I chose to have an orchi so I could stop taking spiro (and because my testes gave me dysphoria), but that was fully optional if you don&#39;t want a labiaplasty. I&#39;m not sure if there are options to keep them if you do want labia, but it&#39;s worth setting up a consultation with Dr Wittenberg to find out if that&#39;s something you might want.

Without testicles you are dependent on hormones. Aren&#39;t you worried that without testosterone you might lose erectile function?

I&#39;m not worried since I was on Spiro for two years without that problem.

Hi Krystal G,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry to hear you had a bad experience when consulting this surgeon. I have to be honest, though, that I resent the implication that your needs are more reasonable or deserving than mine, and that you&#39;ve called my body &#34;totally male&#34;:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I guess the point I&#39;m saying if she&#39;s willing to do a penile preservation still looking totally male but have the advantage of a female vagina she was willing to create for you ? blows my mind ! that she basically told me to bug-gar off wanting to have just female equipment revised from a bad surgery in Bangkok - she did what you obviously requested and being myself older at 64 and I&#39;m healthy , it doesn&#39;t make sense she would right me off but she&#39;ll give you what you requested
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I won&#39;t pretend to know Dr Wittenberg&#39;s reasons, but many US surgeons won&#39;t revise work done outside the country. On top of that, though, your communication in this comment comes across as extremely entitled, and I probably also would not want to work with someone who brought this kind of energy to an interaction.
</p>
<p>
I hope that you find what you&#39;re looking for.
</p>
