If you’re plus-sized or have a very large chest with plenty of axillary breast tissue, I would avoid him at all costs. He absolutely butchered me and didn’t follow through with the surgery plan for literally no medically significant reason. I was told my incisions would extend underneath my armpits and basically to my back, but I woke up with incisions that stopped way before my armpits, leaving behind massive amounts of breast tissue, except now pinned up in an extremely unnatural and painful manner. I had to pay another surgeon $8,000 out-of-pocket to perform an entire second double mastectomy to fix the completely AVOIDABLE mess he left me with. Dr. Stranix also gaslit me during the entire recovery process, telling me that I was healing great and that it was just swelling, even at eight months post-op, all the while, I looked like a deformed monster who was on the brink of suicide due to my results and begging for an answer as to why it had happened. I never received an answer though. I barely got anything said to me at all besides the above mentioned healing and swelling excuses. It was obvious that he knew he fucked up and was playing it smart as to not say anything damming in terms of a lawsuit. I was, however, told by him that you “can’t be flipped or rolled on the operating table due to risk of infection”, which I later learned from the second surgeon is completely UNTRUE. In fact, the second surgeon actually did his job and flipped and prepped me twice (three counting the initial prep lying flat), as it was what was needed to get an aesthetic and proper result. Not to mention, it was Dr. Stranix’s surgery plan in the first damn place, and there was no medical reason that it was not carried out, so it was obviously just to save their own asses. All of it was just a panicked attempt by Dr. Stranix and his team to avoid a malpractice lawsuit by covering up the fact that they were simply too lazy or couldn’t care less to prep me multiple times in order to properly perform the surgery and provide me with an aesthetic result. The second surgeon performed the surgery how it was SUPPOSED to be performed. He salvaged it the best he could, but my skin has irreparable damage and is very unsightly and thin due to the damage caused by the leftover breast tissue being pinned up under my arms and the weight of it, as well as the very poorly placed drains Dr. Stranix also left me with. Despite that, I look WORLDS better now than what I did after Dr. Stranix half-assed me. I didn’t even get nipple grafts. It was the simplest the surgery could have possibly gotten for him, and yet, he left me with a total mess.

I can second on Dr. Stanix&#39;s horrible reputation. I&#39;ve known multiple local transmascs who have gotten top surgery with him and been left with horrible results. The bastard ruins lives out of laziness.

I genuinely believe it comes down to blatant fataphobia and not caring what kind of result he gives to a plus-sized individual. As long as he gets the surgery “done” under the definition of a double mastectomy, he couldn’t care less how it looks.
