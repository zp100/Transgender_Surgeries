Very nice. I just want to have my vaginoplasty now. I had vulvoplasty at OSHU with Dr. Dugi, but this was just a few months before the Covid pandemic started in America in March 2020. I had my surgery done in October 2019. I didn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but I did notice my clit now is sensitive after 3 years. It wasn‚Äôt sensitive or I felt anything when my clit was touched, now it‚Äôs sensitive. It takes time for the clitoris to get it‚Äôs sensitivity back I suppose. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è don‚Äôt rush it. You‚Äôll get your sensitivity back ‚Ä¶ not right away, but eventually.

I have the opposite problem. My clit is
<em>
too
</em>
sensitive and gets easily agitated with even gentle touches, or the gentlest vibrator. My vagina is a bit numb inside but that I know will take time.
</p>
<p>
Good luck on your next surgery. Dr. Dy is really great and can get that vaginoplasty done for you.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for. I was supposed to go back for a visit pre-op vaginoplasty, but there was no flight scheduled to go so the appointments got canceled last minute. Just hoping to have it schedule with a flight included the next time around. An have the operation done with her skillful services.

You‚Äôll get there. It‚Äôll suck, too, but you‚Äôre familiar with that from your vulvoplasty

Sheesh that sounds awful. I got my first migraine before surgery. I had strange aura and it went away after I took some pain meds and went to bed. The next day I had post migraine symptoms and they faded throughout the day.

So I think what happened is because we where told to be off hormones before and not use hormones after surgery that why we had an aura migraine. It‚Äôs the sudden drop of HRT.

I never stopped hormones though! I‚Äôm on injections and you don‚Äôt have to stop those. Women do get more migraines than men though so maybe it is still related to hormones.

They‚Äôre not doing that any more if you‚Äôre on injections or patches. Only if you‚Äôre on pills.

Orgasm for me happened at 2.5 months. Use a smaller dilator to tap the inside while you flick your bean. Happened quite fast for me and able to do multiple times

Thanks so much for sharing and for including a photo‚Äîthat‚Äôs so hard to find from these surgeons! Looks great and surprisingly well-healed after only 5 weeks! Do you mind if I ask how the aesthetics are when spread?

Honestly doesn‚Äôt look all that different when spread yet, though it has been almost 3 months now. I will be posting a long term update with more pics around the 6 month mark. I can definitely feel swelling still
