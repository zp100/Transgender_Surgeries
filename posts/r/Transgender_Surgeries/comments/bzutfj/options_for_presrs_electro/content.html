Pain tolerances are individual and unique, but don&#39;t give up on topicals. The 5% Lidocaine is shit. There is 10% out there that works better but doesn&#39;t last as long. I&#39;ve been very happy with a BLT (Benzocaine, Lidocaine, Tetracaine) combo from

that works for me. You have to call them up to order it and a 40 gram tube should be about $30 (give or take based on volume and shipping). But it works well.

What percentages of each thing in the combo, or if we just ask for &#34;BLT&#34; is it an established standard (if the latter, why isn&#39;t it just explicitly listed as an item on the site)?

They only have one formulation. Not long ago they had to drop the tetracaine percentage. It&#39;s now 25/5/

If you can get a higher concentration of lignocaine it works better. If you can get it with dmso that&#39;s also better.

I think there is a place in Texas called something like Dallas 3000.  They do under anesthesia but the light twilight version.

Electrology 3000, and they run something like $10,000 for one of their marathon sessions.

In Belgium, there is a clinic that does intensive electrolysis with a pain pump for 100€ per hour. One day (8h) should be enough to clear the srs area. I&#39;ve been there once and it was great. The pain pump reduced the pain considerably.
</p>
<p>
I also had my face cleared, and they did it in 3 days. And I had a lot of facial hair, so I consider that very quick. Need to do a few more clearings later of course because of the hair growth cycle.

Per session. Having an anesthesiologist on site makes things way more expensive.

Are you sure of that price? There won&#39;t be many women who can afford that.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure, but I don&#39;t think you need an anesthesiologist to administer the likes of a morphine IV. A doctor is still expensive though.
</p>
<p>
I think they do anesthetic injections as well.

<p>
You&#39;re right, there aren&#39;t very many people that can afford that. It&#39;s ridiculously expensive and out of reach of most of us.
</p>
<p>
It covers several people working on you at once, anesthesia, the anesthesiologist, etc.
</p>
<p>
I looked at pricing again, and I was a bit over, but not by much. As of the early 2000&#39;s, a day session was running about $5000. IYou&#39;re also going to have to factor in travel costs, accomodations, etc. This is also not a one-time deal, since hair growth phases have to be taken into account. You still have to have a few of these marathon sessions to get rid of everything.

There&#39;s some info here

Im not sure about this, but if your surgeon is relying on you do do it and is not going to remove the hair I&#39;d guess it&#39;s super risky. If it&#39;s just a precaution the risk would be much lower.
</p>
<p>
The hair growth cycle is around 10 months so you can&#39;t get all over it in less than that.

Been a client of theirs for a few years now. They offer lidocaine injections for the surgery area. It’s pricy but it works to numb the pain.

You can&#39;t see the hair if it&#39;s shortish or wet. The only dark spot of pubic hair I have is above the region, it could technically work there... but yeah everything else needs epilating.
