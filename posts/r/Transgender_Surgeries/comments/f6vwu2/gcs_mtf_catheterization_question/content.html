Hi, all,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m finishing up with my hospital stay, after having had surgery with Schechter at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Things are progressing well, but I wanted to hear some viewpoints on catheterization.
</p>
<p>
A year ago, at my consult, I was told that catheterization would last for 5-7 days post-op. In the last year, it seems that research and techniques have changed slightly, and I&#39;m being recommended to retain my catheter for 12-14 days, just as a precaution and to allow for maximum healing. I was told this has largely become the new standard procedure, save for very rare cases. I have been told that they only recommend removal if I have no swelling around the urethra...which is difficult, seeing as walking around with this damned thing in is going to cause swelling, regardless.
</p>
<p>
For anyone who went through MTF GCS (full depth), what was your timeframe with catheterization? I was told this morning that, ultimately, it is my choice whether I want to retain the catheter until my follow-up next week, or have it removed at discharge, and would love to hear some of your experiences.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for any perspectives you can offer!
</p>
<p>
ETA: I would like to extend a personal thank you to everyone who responded...you all really helped me out as I mulled this over. I opted to go ahead and remove the catheter on day seven, instead of waiting, and had no adverse complications. I had my follow-up four days ago, and Dr. Schechter was pleased with how everything was healing, with no complaints...even though he had cautioned against it at the time.
</p>
<p>
My plea to everyone is to make sure you are actively involved in your own care. Ensure that you always have a seat at the table in these discussions; it&#39;s your body, and you have the ultimate final say!
</p>

It&#39;s up to the surgeon and all surgeons and patients are different. There&#39;s a balancing act between keeping the lumen open due to swelling and wound healing vs chance for CAUTI. From what I&#39;ve seen, usual time is removal around 7th day post op. This may be extended to about 14 days post op for a small number of patients  who can&#39;t urinate (15-20%).

Dr Brassard has the catheter removed 6 days after. If the bladder fully empties during that day after each pee, then they consider you good to go otherwise it is reinserted and you keep it for another week.

My surgeon poured a measured amount of saline into my bladder before she took the catheter out (IIRC it was 200ml.) She took the catheter out, put a measuring cup thing in the toilet, and I peed into it. As long as I peed out at least as much as she put in, she was happy with that. I actually peed out about twice that amount because I&#39;d been drinking water all morning.

There are several methods, it&#39;s called Trial Of Void (TOV). Basically, completely void via catheter, instill a known volume of fluid or advise patient to take up that amount of fluid, remove catheter, collect the urine and measure volume. It&#39;s also possible to use ultrasound to see if there is any remaining fluid in the bladder.

All reasonable comments and it does show  that YMMV. One thing I will mention is that the longer the catheter is in the more likely the adverse consequences such as UTI&#39;s and strictures due to the bodies reaction to the latex. Lets ignore discomfort and catching the bloody thing on furniture. If I was having a catheter in for 10 to 14 days I would be insisting on them using a silastic catheter NOT latex. Far less complications however more expensive so hospitals dont like using them.

That&#39;s interesting - Dr. Wittenberg injects 250ml of liquid via the catheter tube then has you pee the 250ml back out, you don&#39;t have to rely on drinking water (though it makes it easier!)

I had surgery 30th may last year. I have had 3 catheters since my GCS.
</p>
<p>
My first catheter was removed 5 days after surgery. I couldn&#39;t pass more than a few drops of urine in the night after it was removed so had to have another one inserted.
</p>
<p>
My second catheter was in for 10 days. I had a slow urine stream afterwards.
</p>
<p>
after 10 weeks post op the issue didn&#39;t go away so it was decided that I would need a revision surgery.
</p>
<p>
3 weeks ago I had the revision surgery. I had the catheter in for 5 days afterwards and haven&#39;t yet had any issues since removal.

I had mine in for 8 days from day of surgery, 14 is gonna suck. That being said, being re-catheterized at 2am in the ER by someone who has never seen a neovagina because you can&#39;t pee is gonna be a horrific experience so I at least sympathize with the caution

I actually had my GCS with Dr. Schechter at Rush about 5 months ago. They had a slight issue inserting the catheter for my procedure due to a uretheral stricture, so they required me to be discharged with the catheter in to ensure I was healed properly.  Ultimately, I had the catheter in for 10 days and that was considered longer than typical due to my complication. I&#39;m a bit surprised to see the recommendation at 12-14 days.
</p>
<p>
I wanted it out ASAP. It was the only thing that was causing me remarkable pain while maneuvering. I could handle the slight discomfort of the catheter itself, but if it was repositioned or moved too quickly at certain angles it would cause an intense sharp pain.

I just went with Schechter last April, I had mine removed at day 6, they wanted to keep me in it longer, but i was having major issues with it. They almost had to put it back in due to the swelling. I would reccomend keeping it as long as you canunless it is causing you serious issues, peeing after this surgery is awful for the first while.
</p>
<p>
Mine was not draining and muliple times a day i had to have a nurse come and spend 30 minutes moving everythign around and trying to get it to drain.

I had my surgery with Crane I had the packing (with catheter) in for 6 or 7 days I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with letting it stay in there for a few more days it&#39;s less work if like the rest of the packing is there I guess

I had my surgery with Chet and it was 11 days, I was fine with that as the swelling isn&#39;t from walking around with it, it&#39;s from the surgery and it&#39;s good to let that settle. I didn&#39;t find the catheter annoying as I was in bed for 99+% of the time anyway so it was fine.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d rather it was in a bit longer than less if it means not needing it put back if I couldn&#39;t pee, it&#39;s not normally that uncomfortable to have one put in but I&#39;m sure it would be 5 days post op.

I had my catheter removed at the first post op, so 1 week after leaving the hospital.  That said...leaving it in wouldn&#39;t have bothered me as I didn&#39;t find the catheter to be unnoticeable.

They said 5 days for me, but if they took it out on day 5 and I wasn’t able to pee (due to swelling) then I would have to have it put back in.
</p>
<p>
When the time came to take it out I could pee a little but I couldn’t empty my bladder completely, so they had to put it back in. Not so fun. Then I had it in until my first post op appointment, about 2 weeks after surgery day.

Mine was removed when I went home from the hospital, 7 days after. (Some people do retain it during that visit if they’re having issues expelling piss.) but as everyone else has said, it varies by surgeon.

My surgery was on 12-13-19 at OHSU, with Dr. Dugi III. My catheter was removed at discharge, and everything was okay, although I did spray instead of stream for a bit.

Cath in with surgery in Monday, out at my follow up the next Monday. If I hadn&#39;t been able to pee within 6 hours, I&#39;d have been re-cathed. I peed right after the follow up.

It depends on the surgeon and your recovery.  Mine was out after 5 days because I kept dealing with clogs because of blood clots and it kept getting replaced.  But once out I was peeing fine.  Others I know had it in for about 2 weeks because of things with their surgery.  Most have their catheter out on time.  So discuss with your surgeon....and once it is out....enjoy that first pee.

My wife is currently in SRS Clinic in montreal, and they stick to the standard medical schedule. Which is to remove it on the fifth day after surgery unless there is severe swelling

I&#39;m 10 months post-op, and my catheter came out 7 days after surgery. They put a measured amount of saline into my bladder, took out the catheter, and then put a measuring device in the toilet. As long as I peed out what they put in, the catheter could stay out. I had no problem peeing, but if it had been so swollen that I couldn&#39;t pee, they would&#39;ve had to cath me again for another week. Luckily my surgeon said it was fairly rare, and was a non issue for me anyway.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t heard of 12-14 days becoming the new standard. It&#39;s pretty much universally always been about a week for most patients, aside from a small number of folks who have excessive swelling and need to keep it in a little longer.
