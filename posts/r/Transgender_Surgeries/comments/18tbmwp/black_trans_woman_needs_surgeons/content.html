I am a black british trans woman living in the UK searching for a surgeon. I genuinely get overwhelmed thinking about who will conduct my surgery. Sometimes I wish the Nhs wait times were shorter so the onus could be taking off of me. But we‚Äôre not like america. I‚Äôm looking at a decade on a waiting list. &amp; I feel UK doesn‚Äôt give the results I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm scared to pick the wrong one. I‚Äôve literally had every surgeon on my wish list from Kamol (before I found out he was a butcher) to banks, Supron, Chettawut, RBL, Theerapong, Min Jun, Del Correl.  When I say everyone I literally mean EVERYONE. It changes all the time which is worrisome as I don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôll end up going to. Even the technique changes all the time between the obvious 3. I was hard set on colon for a while but I‚Äôve gone back to ppt. It‚Äôs genuinely stressful and as you can see I flip flop a lot. I‚Äôm even more petrified for FFS. I wanted to do DR lee but I dont like his aesthetics anymore. Scared of the facial team and right now Im looking at the DR cardenas but my problem always stays the same. Im scared of choosing the wrong dr and ruining my face or vag. Im terrified. I wish one of you oovely ladies could choose for me but then when is life ever easy. I just wish i was born a a cis girl. help :(

I&#39;m black too, I&#39;m local to the US though so that&#39;s where my knowledge lies but in terms of FFS consults (because yeah, I&#39;m nervous about going to someone without much experience on black faces) I want to say Dr. Mardirossian was the best. He even brought up that he&#39;d retain the ethnic appearance of my nose with the rhinoplasty - no other FFS surgeon consult mentioned that detail to me.
</p>
<p>
I hear good things about Satterwhite and it&#39;s who Align Surgical directed me to on the phone when I asked for someone experienced with black faces but I won&#39;t consult with him until March.
</p>
<p>
Steer clear of the popular Thai FFS surgeons - one of the  well known ones (I forget specifically which) gave me a damn laundry list that had things on it that not even Mardirossian or Cardenas talked about (and I&#39;m certainly gonna trust Mardi&#39;s word). I feel like the standards they go off of definitely don&#39;t take black faces into consideration.

Satterwhite botched my client‚Äôs nose and a good friend had to let her vagina close after 3 revisions. I wouldn‚Äôt go to him.

Look into Dr Jeffery Jumaily for your FFS if you don‚Äôt have a budget. He is way more expensive than Cardenas per se but the consistency in his results is actually insane, like it‚Äôs drastic but looks natural and he does ethnic rhino ! I was researching for 3months  and decided on him eventually.

Dr.M quoted me 100k for ffs. I heard girls in the US were able to use insurance to help pay for it like Starbucks and Apple. I‚Äôm in Texas which doesn‚Äôt support the Trans community when it comes to insurance. Fingers crossed and don‚Äôt give up. Try Facebook to find black transwomen or Ballroom. Back in the day we had a surgery group just for us on FB.
