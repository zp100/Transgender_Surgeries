Hey everyone. I&#39;ve been having some huge problems with dilation. Now with previous issues, I have very limited depth as is (3 inches MAX) so I&#39;m extra worried about making sure dilation goes right.
</p>
<p>
When I did things with the doctor, I was able to get my dilator almost all the way in. However, I haven&#39;t been able to replicate that in any way since I&#39;ve gotten home. I can barely manage to get an inch in at all.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been watching tons of tutorial videos and trying to read the doctor&#39;s instructions she wrote for me, but nothing seems to work. I&#39;ve tried to put the dilator in at some insane angles, nothing seems to go. I hit a solid wall and there&#39;s just no way past it.
</p>
<p>
I understand I&#39;m supposed to kind of go down, then move more towards going up. But I just can&#39;t anywhere now and I&#39;m really worried about it. Is there some sort of trick I&#39;m missing?
</p>

As others have said, first step is really to relax. I know you are probably very stressed out about not being able to do, whether or not you want to be but you have to accept that it&#39;s stressful.
</p>
<p>
After that try whatever you can to relax, whether it be medication, meditation, or distraction, find a way to just say &#34;Okay, my mind is at ease, and I will be able to do it.&#34;
</p>
<p>
In addition, I highly recommend trying to pee / have a bowel movement before you try to dialate. It creates extra strain on the pelvic area and we are trying to get you to where there is none!
</p>
<p>
Then put on something non-aggressive and relaxing, I&#39;ve found Disney cartoons are pretty good as they are so harmless.
</p>
<p>
When you go to dialate, lube that thing up. I&#39;ve been making sure there is a visible raised glob of lube on the front of the dialator, because there is never too much lube.
</p>
<p>
Focus on both the angle you are trying to insert and the way you are sitting. I find basically sitting on my tailbone with my crotch in the air is the best position for me, but experiment to find out yours.
</p>
<p>
When you go to insert, don&#39;t give up on a spot the moment you feel resistance. There is a bit of tissue you gotta push on still to get into the vaginal canal. It&#39;s nothing major, so like don&#39;t try to ram it somewhere doesn&#39;t want to go, but poke around at a few angles with the same starting setup and you&#39;ll find it. ðŸ˜Š

Have you tried dilating with your hips (butt) flat on the bed, with your back up? My physical therapist suggested it, and it slipped right in to the second dot. I hope this helps, and TTFN

How far should my back be up? I&#39;ve had it at a slight angle because that&#39;s how it was at the doctors when we got it to work. Been using a wedge pillow.

Good morning! My back is nearly vertical, with a couple of pillows behind me. Your wedge pillow will also work. I hope this helps, and please discuss this with your PT first. Enjoy the sun if you can, and TTFN

Nearly vertical? Like, flat on the bed almost or like, almost sitting straight up? I&#39;m willing to try just about anything at this point since I just can&#39;t seem to get it right now. I&#39;ll give it a go next session.

My legs are straight out, and my back is against the headboard like this. Apologies if the photo is wrong, as this is my first post.

Before surgery years back, I had a scotectamy when I got my orchi. At the time it would never have been remotely possible for me to afford surgery proper.
</p>
<p>
A class action lawsuit in wisconsin made it so state insurance has to cover surgery now. Which made it suddenly a possiblity for me, but left me with very little skin at all to work with.

First use lots of lube and take a lot of time to try and ease it in. It may be your muscles are unconsciously clenching and you need to keep applying steady pressure as you breathe and try to relax. Focus on a tv show or something, then hopefully youâ€™ll notice it slowly going in further. Also kind of moving the dilator in a circular motion (not twisting) to sort of loosen the muscle around. Thatâ€™s my trick for going to bigger sizes.
</p>
<p>
If all else fails reach out to your surgeon and show them on cam or facetime, but donâ€™t wait too long

I&#39;ve been trying to give this kind of thing a shot, but I spent close to an hour on my last session with nothing giving way. It&#39;s kinda why I finally came in to ask, I feel like there&#39;s gotta be something wrong. No matter how much pressure I put on or relax it&#39;s like there&#39;s a wall in my way to go any further.

Have you tried exploring with a finger? Mine she instructed to go a little downwards first, so kind of like under the obstruction? I hit a similar wall further in and i sometimes have to use the smallest dilator possible to ease past first. Also maybe try a muscle relaxer

Do you know if you&#39;re getting under the pubic bone?
</p>
<p>
At the doctor&#39;s office, do yo remember them showing you how to angle it the first inch and a half and then tilt to go more?

I&#39;ve been attempting to, and yes I remember you need to try and angle it for that first section and go forward. No matter how intense (or lack of intense) I seem to put the angle at, I&#39;m hitting a solid wall the moment I try to push forward. It feels like I&#39;m only stretching that initial push in, I can get maybe an inch in then despite any other efforts it&#39;s a brick wall in my way.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s confusing, as I had managed to get it right insanely easily at the doctor&#39;s office. It&#39;s just now that I&#39;m home trying to replicate it that I can&#39;t pull it off.

That much more shallow, hitting a solid wall, it really sounds like the pubic bone to me.

Yeah I&#39;m trying to use a mirror, is there some way it could help me more? It feels like no matter how down I go (for lack of a better term) the wall is always there once I try to push in.

I asked bc what if you were missing the hole.  Sorry, nothing about you, just starting from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
I hope you&#39;ve contacted your doctor as well.  Wish I were there to help!
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s really about having the right angle.  For me the dilator is about 45Â° from the vulva.  I push straight about 2&#34;, then I increase the angle so the rest goes in :/

Do you have access to a gynecologist? In my city, there is a gyno who has some experience with trans women, and she examined me 1.5 months post-op. She used a speculum to look inside and confirm that everything healed ok.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a gyno could take a look and confirm if there is some sort of blockage?

I had an exam like that with the doctor before I started dilating. She said everything was healing well, and we managed to get the dilator in easy. Just for some reason at home I can&#39;t seem to replicate it.

Hey are you still struggling with this?
</p>
<p>
I hope you figured it out and things are going well. If not, you must call your surgeon and ask for advice, they might have some good information for you.
</p>
<p>
Might sound obvious, but especially with your depth, have you tried just starting with a finger?
</p>
<p>
I know it can be intimidating and scary, but if you go gentle and stay relaxed and calm you should be able to feel around and figure out what&#39;s going on inside.
</p>
<p>
Maybe you have a bit of scar tissue contraction and the dilator is hitting that early? Or some granulation tissue in one area that you need to change the angle a little to get past?
</p>
<p>
Just some random guesses based on very common (and generally mild) complications. But if you can get your finger in a lot deeper than the dilator goes, you might figure out how to adjust angles and so on to get it to full depth.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s very important that you get that depth now while you&#39;re early in healing, so do whatever you can to make it happen. Be brave and curious.
