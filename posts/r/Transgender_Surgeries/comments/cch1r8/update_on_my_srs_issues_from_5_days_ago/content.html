I had a similar experience with &#34;lack of non SRS people being reluctant to do anything&#34;.
</p>
<p>
My local hospital is around 700m from where I live. The hospital I had SRS at is about 150km away. I wasn&#39;t allowed to drive because of being on morphene.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I was urinating blood for 5 days, went up to the ER, got some antibiotics from them, but they refused to pull the catheter, despite it being time, and it leaking.
</p>
<p>
A lot of the reason to do surgery in Europe is based on not wanting to travel as far, and a &#34;false sense of security&#34; that the healthcare is somehow better here than it would be in Thailand for example, but it isn&#39;t really the case.
</p>
<p>
This was Sweden btw.
</p>
<p>
Wishing you a good recovery and as little discomfort as possible!

I‚Äôm in a similar situation in a large city in Germany. I‚Äôm also live a couple of hundred meters away from a large hospital with a good urology department, but they don‚Äôt do this op. My op was done about 120km away. I don‚Äôt have a car myself so I‚Äôve been relying on friends and family to drive me, but it‚Äôs a big ask every time. But quite honestly I‚Äôd prefer to be a two hour drive away than a 14 hour flight.
</p>
<p>
I am now at home again with a catheter through my tummy into the bladder to overcome the urethra blockage. I have another appointment in 3 weeks booked with my surgeon. I‚Äôm hoping they will operate quickly.

I really really hope things go well for you!!!
</p>

I have had very minor complications compared to you, but it has still been awful, can&#39;t imagine what you are going through.

I‚Äôm hoping that the main issue is solvable. They just need to expand the exit of the urethra. The rest of it hasn‚Äôt been touched as part of he operation so I don‚Äôt see why it would be damaged. Once that‚Äôs solved I can pee again properly. And once that‚Äôs fixed I‚Äôll be able to empty my bladder properly. And then the other bits of damage can hopefully be fixed in the corrective op that was already planned. And if things aren‚Äôt perfect down there, I have to remember that every woman is different and many have issues with joe their vulvas look and some are lopsided or larger or smaller. So mine will be too. I‚Äôm not going to stress about that as long as everything functionally works well. Good luck with your complications as well.

Well this was a bit unnerving to read! First - I trust you‚Äôll do well and in time recover just fine. I‚Äôm having my SRS in two weeks and my greatest fear is having my urethra blocked.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve had six major abdominal surgeries over the past six years and every time I was unable to urinate post surgery and had to have a catheter inserted. On one occasion the nurse refused saying I was old and my prostate was probably enlarged and to just get over it. By the time they finally did it they drained 1,200 ml‚Äôs of urine - from a bladder designed for 300-350 ml‚Äôs.
</p>
<p>
I talked this over with my SRS surgeon and he said he would plan to leave the catheter in longer than he normally does.
</p>
<p>
So good luck young lady and here‚Äôs to many years of peeing normally!!!! And frequently!

I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to scare you. I‚Äôve shared in case anyone else ends up noticing a steady decline in the ability to pass water as they are healing, and can use my experience as a reference.
</p>
<p>
I have quite a few friends that have been to the same surgeon before me and they had zero complications and everything looks great. I just seem to have had a bit of bad luck that has cascaded into other complications.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with your surgery.

Thanks for the sharing of your experience.  A couple of years ago I had an artificial sphincter installed around my urethra to correct incontinence caused by prostate removal in 2005.  My spironolactone caused extra urine production because its original use is as a diuretic was and is to drain excess liquids from the body.  Thus after I started HRT I leaked more, used more incontinence pads and had more &#34;accidents&#34; when out for long periods of time.  However, my urologist was very specific and insistent that I should not have an urethral catheter used because it could erode (puncture) the urethra near the sphincter collar around the urethra.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Thus, your post here is very timely and helpful to me because the only recommended cather is an external one as you described.  I have BA scheduled for next month and FFS scheduled for early next year and that special instruction to my new surgeons takes on special importance.  Any further experience with the catheter would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

In German it is called a ‚ÄúBauchdeckenkatheter‚Äù or SPDK. In English:

</a>

<p>
A needle is inserted between the pubic region and belly button through to the bladder. It doesn‚Äôt pierce the abdominal cavity. The injection delivers a local anesthetic. This for me was quite a painful and unpleasant experience. Then once numb, a hole is made and a narrow tube is passed through into the bladder. It is at cages inside with a stitch or two to secure it, and similarly outside as well. The catheter needs to be changed every six weeks at least. It is common for bacteria to enter the bladder via this method, so it is important to regularly check for signs of infection. The dressing needs to be changed every two days. It is uncomfortable and awkward. It continuously gets int this way and sleeping is restricted to lying on my back or to one side. Unless I disconnect the bag, which I try not to do because it increases the risk of bacteria entering the tube.
