Exactly what I said before, necrosis must be removed asap or it may risk spreading to live tissue ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
I hope you‚Äôll be ok after tomorrow. Good luck.

Why did they make you wait so long for a surgery to fix the necrosis? It seems like an emergency if it‚Äôs necrosis? Can‚Äôt this cause sepsis if left untreated?

Well they told me it will fell off alone. That is a normal complication and that will heal alone.

How far are you from your original surgery location? I don&#39;t see anything that looks like infection and it looks like that black tissue if coming off as planned. Make sure you are taking your temp and checking for any sign of fever. Send these pics to your surgeon too.

I&#39;m not a Dr at all but it could be ok.  I know it&#39;s difficult almost impossible to not stress but if you can&#39;t get a 2nd opinion from another Dr try to not stress as much because just that alone will affect healing and you need all your body healing powers now . Do you have people with you that you can distract to not think about every moment. . I&#39;m not trying to be insensitive.  I&#39;m really concerned about what&#39;s happening with you, I&#39;m really concerned about your immune system and stuff you want to make sure that that&#39;s really strong that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m not saying that I could do any better I&#39;m just saying that I know what stress does and if there&#39;s any possible way to lower it a little bit it&#39;s going to help you out. üòäü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è

This would be the point when you call for a nurse to come in and you ask for another exam/consult from your doctor or whatever doctor they have available.  These things can be layered honey. It just might be a thicker patch than you expected.  I think it might benefit to get an in depth explanation from nurse or doctors about what to expect, what timeline this process is for the necrosis, any and all questions.  Take good notes on this explanation so that you have specific guidance and advice on your body and your experience to look at when you are worried about possibilities.  And after a few days, when they check over the area again, get an update for your notes. That way you won‚Äôt be able to have anxiety that the notes might not be as accurate because it‚Äôs been a few days.
</p>
<p>
When I have anxiety like this and I feel compelled to seek out assistance and such, I try to get specific facts and note them down or save them somehow. If this is doable for you to ask a nurse or a doctor I highly suggest you do it. You‚Äôve already been through so much and even if you‚Äôre on bed rest I don‚Äôt think your nerves and emotions have had a moment to rest and relax.
</p>
<p>
This kind of technique works for me and it might be just me, but I just feel for you so much sweetie cause I have this same kind of anxiety process all the time and it‚Äôs exhausting.  If this kind of approach can help you too then I knew I had to suggest it just in case.  You deserve reassurance and to have tools for helping you cope and reassure yourself when you need üíõ‚ú®

Hey that sounds spectacular!  I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs a plan already lined up and in the works. I hope that works out great.  I don‚Äôt know anything about surgery but the first thing that comes to mind is hopefully they can remove bits of necrosis which I hope will help alleviate strain or any effects it might have been having on the non necrotized (I think that‚Äôs the right word?) tissue.
</p>
<p>
And then you‚Äôll have some more time to heal and relax and hopefully get some good rest before you see your surgeon.  And I trust that they‚Äôll be able to help with anything that might have gotten some damaged and/or needs revision

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned during my healing, is that with time stuff looks miles better. I had been freaking out and spiraling because my outer labia was swollen and practically black from bruising (I have a connective tissue and skin disorder so bruising and scarring for me is extra odd) and my inner labia looked wonky and unbalanced and like it had just been glued on haphazardly.  I‚Äôm hoping the revision tomorrow will be to remove the necrosis and anything else worrying, because once you get there then it‚Äôs a waiting game of swelling and skin irritation going down.  From what I‚Äôve heard and learned some people have very little swelling after three months. Most it takes 6-8, some even a year.  It‚Äôs going to take some time before everything is healed and that‚Äôs okay!  It‚Äôs part of the process that we‚Äôre all going through. Hopefully once necrosis is cleared up, either from falling off or via surgery/revision, you won‚Äôt have anything extra to worry about besides ‚Äúeverything looks weird and swollen.‚Äù  At least with that there‚Äôs a better likelihood of solidarity.

Is this a revision with a plastic surgeon that does breast augmentation or are they a urologist?

It&#39;s the one who does breast augmentation... But I mean it&#39;s a surgeon. I think at least he should know if it&#39;s infected or no. On 19th September it&#39;s when I&#39;m going to see the surgeon who did my surgery.

I totally agree. For those offices who have EPIC electronic medical record you can use the MYCHART function to ask questions directly and send pictures for comment. That way you can avoid being flustered and can take your time posing the questions. Your questions and their answers, as far as I know, are made part of your record.

For context she is already back in the hospital and being observed by hospital staff because she has some necrosis already.  I‚Äôm wanting to check if you‚Äôve been following along with her other posts in this sub or if this is your first time seeing her posts?  I am not mad at you or anything, just wanting to make sure you know she is being looked after already, and to get clarification because op is already dealing with a lot of anxiety and we don‚Äôt need a ‚Äúyou might not survive‚Äù on top of that making her worry more.  (OP if I got any details wrong feel free to correct, hope that was okay to step in there and check for clarification)

Well, I&#39;m at home now... But I still in touch with my surgeon and nurses. When I see something strange I send him pictures of everything and he replies fast. So I&#39;m not really concerned. And well the you might not survive... I don&#39;t think so, I mean I&#39;m not really feeling pain at all. Just uncomfortable and when it&#39;s pain it&#39;s something I can handle. And if there was something infected I think it would hurt.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow morning I have a revision with a surgeon here in my city and on 19th September I go to the surgeon who did the surgery for revision. So tomorrow probably I will get told if something it&#39;s bad or it&#39;s part of the healing.

Oh I must have missed a day of these posts, she wasn&#39;t getting any care at all last time I saw one--glad she&#39;s getting care there. No I&#39;m definitely not saying you&#39;re going to die from this if you are properly treated which it seems like you are!!
