I got FFS last year and was able to bounce back to life after like two weeks, my body is naturally a quick healer, im also 21 so maybe that has something to do with it?

I have 2 questions for you, all of your life up until this point you had this weight in between your legs, now that your free of it what&#39;s it like to move around without it? and what&#39;s it like to walk? Weird questions but I&#39;ve always wanted to know.

I got my srs 9 days ago and Iâ€™m gonna try to give you an answer this isnâ€™t some arrogant bullshit. I am still pretty puffed up and mobility isnâ€™t the best because of stitches and what not but not having the dick bouncing and flopping around has been an instant improvement. My body just feels so tight and smooth, my hips look wider and more feminine just from all the extra tissue being cut down. Itâ€™s out of the way and I can finally see my body for what she is. I feel so much more beautiful, even with my deflated boobies (canâ€™t wait to start my HRT again when I get home!) testicles hurt and theyâ€™re always in the way and honestly kinda ugly. I actually forgot I had them until comparing just now and all I can say is thank god they are gone. It is such a euphoric feeling when I feel my thighs touch each other in the place they would previously have touched my dick. When I move I just feel so graceful and lithe and smooth and little. Itâ€™s hard to describe but Iâ€™m just so happy with my little kitty.

I&#39;m glad you are sharing this. It gives all of us hope and the motivation to move forward in life. Everything you describes is what I thought it would be like but to read about it from someone who is feeling what all of us want to feel is amazing and to read the words that have been in my mind for a long time is totally awesome.
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much for this. :)

Thank you for the insight.  I too have wanted to know what it&#39;s like to be free of the male hardware flopping around between one&#39;s legs and experience having a smooth kitty for the first time.

I&#39;m not trying to be weird or anything but trust me I&#39;ve tried to find that answer. If I had found it I wouldn&#39;t have asked someone here and I don&#39;t know anyone who has been through this surgery and it is something that I have always wanted to know because I am male and I see women walk and I&#39;ve always wanted to know what it is like to not walk with my genitals getting in the way.
</p>
<p>
I plan on doing the same thing you did someday and it has been on my mind recently and this is one of those questions I haven&#39;t found the answer to that&#39;s all.

I don&#39;t find walking much different. Maybe in loose boxers genitals would&#39;ve gotten in the way, but I always wore tight boxer briefs so things were held against the body well. But I do like no longer having an urge to readjust regularly.

The constantly readjusting would be something I wouldn&#39;t miss, the itching. I&#39;m very clean down there but still they itch! and I&#39;m like you before srs, tight undies to huge the bulge - don&#39;t care about making man juice, not going to have kids anyways but it would be nice to be able to wear the undies I&#39;ve seen on thousands of other girls and one last semi-question. What was it like to be able to wear panties (or a swimsuit) for the first time without your male baggage getting in the way. It must have been a moment that you will always remember, you must have thought &#34;Finally!&#34; A sense of calm must have come over you.
</p>
<p>
There was a video on YouTube that I watched years ago. She had undergone srs and she said one thing that I remembered. She felt a sense of calmness about herself, having finally gotten rid of her male parts. She was now able to get on with her life and live it to her satisfaction. I want to feel exactly like that and hopefully get a good night&#39;s rest for the first time in decades.

I became pretty adept at taping, so I had no problem wearing swimsuits and such. But not having to experience the feeling of defeat as I untaped at the end of the day would be enough on it&#39;s own to make the whole process worth it.

Can you please keep updating us with your progress? I&#39;m seriously considering Brassard and finding out what the outcome looks like over time is really hard.

Yes! I did brassard because of convenience (I live in Ontario, and he is the quickest approval time to get covered by health insurance). I also didnt do much research because I had a girlfriend who went to him and loved it so I just trusted that. I will be sure to post timelines

Iâ€™m ftm so canâ€™t speak on the surgeons, but Parkside is incredible. I was there May 14th, the night and day nurses are lovely and kind and the food (when I was able to stomach food and my throat wasnâ€™t too painful) was amazing too.  Congrats!
