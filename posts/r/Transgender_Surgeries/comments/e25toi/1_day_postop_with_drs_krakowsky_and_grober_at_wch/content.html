I am currently 1 day post vaginoplasty with Drs Krakowsky and Grober at Women&#39;s College Hospital. I intend to do a more structured write up of my experience in the future when I&#39;m a bit farther along in recovery, but for now, please feel free to AMA.
</p>
<p>
Note: I don&#39;t plan on posting photos, it feels a bit too personal.

No questions but congratulations. I know of several acquaintances that are lined up with him as well.

<p>
Hope you recover well

Thank you. I&#39;ve had a few minor speed bumps in recovery, but I&#39;m told the surgery itself went smoothly. The outer dressing comes off tomorrow, and I get to see if for myself then. :)

Require? No. Recommend? Yes. I didn&#39;t really have the full hair removal conversation with them as I had already started genital electrolysis. They recommend using the same pattern as Dr. Bowers.
</p>
<p>
I believe it would depend on your provincial health insurance. For the moment I suspect most of them still default to Brassard in Montreal, but I&#39;m not familiar with any of them besides OHIP.

Referral information is on the TRS program webpage:
<a href="https://www.womenscollegehospital.ca/care-programs/surgery/transition-related-surgeries/" rel="nofollow">https://www.womenscollegehospital.ca/care-programs/surgery/transition-related-surgeries/
</a>
</p>
<p>
TL;DR version: submit for OHIP approval as normal listing Dr. Krakowsky at WCH as the surgeon. Have your provider also submit a referral to WCH directly. If you get in contact with the program&#39;s Nurse Practitioner, you can request permission to get the referral in before MoH funding approval comes back.

I wasn&#39;t a fan of his trend to minimal labia minora, and I had heard repeatedly that his clinic&#39;s communication sucked.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m generally positive about Dr Bowers&#39; results, and going with a surgical team trained by her seemed like a good decision. I also had the opportunity to see one of Dr Krakowsky&#39;s early post-op results which looked similar to Dr Bowers&#39;.
</p>
<p>
So far, I think I made a good choice. My vulva is bloody and swollen, but it is definitely mine.

Where did you get a chance to see Dr. Krakowsky&#39;s work? As a resident of Toronto, it would be so much easier to just go to him, but like, the lack of any kind of picture whatsoever is really leaving him with a big black hole in his experience.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve already almost got a slot in with Brassard, but I&#39;d be willing to wait another year if this guy can produce good results.

When you consider that he has had a total of 6 patients to date, the lack of publicly posted results isn&#39;t surprising. I was very tempted to post mine for just that reason, but I&#39;m just not comfortable putting my genitals out there on the Internet.
</p>
<p>
I took a bit of a leap of faith based on Dr Bowers&#39; reputation and her results when I reached out to them in February. I was able to see a day 2 result from one of his earlier patients at my last pre-op consult in September, which gave me the confidence to commit to him as my surgeon. If not, I would have backed out and switched my MOH approval over to a different surgeon.
</p>
<p>
If you go down the path far enough to get to a pre-op consult, he will have at least 2 sets of results to show you.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, I&#39;ve heard that his waiting list has ballooned since their first surgeries as they aren&#39;t funded or set up to do more than 1 surgery a month at the moment.

Yeah the real issue is pedigree vs experience.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, Brassard has done countless surgeries, and pretty much no matter what, he&#39;s a &#34;safe&#34; bet for a decent outcome. I&#39;m a pretty firm believer that most complications are patient-side, and not due to medical screw-ups.
</p>
<p>
On the other, this guy has a big pedigree in Bowers. I don&#39;t think she&#39;d let him use her name and reputation as a foothold if she herself wouldn&#39;t approve of the work. He&#39;s also extremely close but is a big fat unknown in the grand scheme of things.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a gamble.. I don&#39;t know what to do.

I agree, it was a gamble for me too. The &#34;safe&#34; option would probably be to get approval for Bowers and get on her wait list, but I wasn&#39;t willing to wait quite that long.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I went with my gut feeling, thought it through carefully, and took the leap of faith that Bowers wouldn&#39;t have attached her name to them if they weren&#39;t up to the challenge.

So, I guess the only thing left to ask now is: how&#39;d it turn out? Did your gamble pay off? What aesthetics were you going for? Did you do full-depth?

Thank you so much for the reply! I (fortunately) don&#39;t care about appearance so that shouldn&#39;t be an issue for me. I&#39;ve emailed and phoned both Women&#39;s College Hospital as well as GRS Montreal, and totally agree that Women&#39;s College Hospital did a much better job communicating.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s amazing! I&#39;m so happy you&#39;re feeling you made the right decision. I&#39;m sure recovery is difficult, but knowing you made the right decision will hopefully make it less intense. Wishing you a speedy recovery :)

I&#39;m bouncing back pretty well so far, but recovery has definitely been pretty intense at times, and being in a supporting environment has been a huge boon. Hopefully I&#39;m back up to speed before ski season ends this year.

Do you have a link to the Dr. Bowers hair removal diagram. (just in case I need it)
</p>
<p>
I live in Alberta so it probably defaults to Brassard.

Worth looking into, if you have to go out of province to begin with, you may have flexibility. Vancouver also started up their bottom surgery program recently.

I plan to. One piece of advice: don&#39;t try for any personal fitness bests the week before surgery. I&#39;m dealing with a wicked cramp in my calf from running 10 km on Friday. (I was encouraged to remain active before surgery, I pushed myself too hard.)

Being immobilized in lithotomy position for around 5 hours aggravated it. Pretty much everyone agrees that I did a dumb thing, but that it was understandable given that I won&#39;t be going running again any time soon.

It&#39;s very rare to hear this discussed so I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re supposed to know of it. I think I&#39;ve only heard of it once before.
</p>
<p>
I take it you&#39;d not normally be in significant pain from running at this point? It&#39;s 4 days after running now?

I raised the question with the pelvic floor physiotherapist associated with the program. She recommended keeping up my normal activity level in the run up to surgery, stopping the weekend before to let my muscles recover fully and for the lactic acid to completely dissipate.
</p>
<p>
Going into the OR, my legs felt fine. Coming out of the OR, one of my calves started to get sore very fast and one of the muscles started to swell up. There was concern of a possible DVT, but an ultrasound ruled that out and showed that the muscle had swollen to twice the size of the same muscle in my other calf.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t understand the mechanism behind why it cramped up like it did, but none of the nursing staff or my doctors seemed particularly surprised by it given the history.

That sounds a lot more painful than just wicked cramp.

About an 8 on the pain scale as it ramped up super fast.
</p>
<p>
Edit: before the nurse caught up to the pain and got it under control.

With lithotomy position there is a risk of pressure on the calf causing a compartment syndrome. Muscle damage from the 5 hours of pressure can cause the leg to swell. I saw it once in residency during a colon cancer resection. It’s incredibly rare but can happen. Just a possibility though.

Seems to have just been a wicked Charley horse. We found some good positions to take the pressure off of it last night, and getting up and moving around today has helped reduce the swelling significantly. The muscle is still knotted, but not as firm and swollen.

They are aware of the technique, but did not use the tunica graft in my case.
</p>
<p>
Dr Bowers&#39; input was that the outcome would be superior without the graft. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve got any other improvements for lubrication.

The baseline is still 3 nights in AACU with discharge on day 3 post-op. Follow up at 1 week to remove packing and catheter, and start dilation. Follow up at 2 weeks to review progress. Return home afterwards if from out of town.
</p>
<p>
Not certain about exact details of longer term follow ups, I think it&#39;s nominally either 6 or 8 weeks and then every 3 months for the first year nominally.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;ve got the same app to chat with them as needed.

Wishing you the best and congratulations. Please know for future reference, should you decide to post photos, that TERFS frequently browse this subreddit to save photos of post op trans women and men and post them on sites where people can look at and make fun of neovaginas and neopenises. I know, what kind of people are pathetic enough to do something like that, but it happens. Be safe.

I know, sadly. It&#39;s one of the reasons I don&#39;t feel entirely comfortable, even if there&#39;s no personally identifying information in the photos.

What surgical method did they use, PI/PI with scrotal graft/Peritoneum graft etc.?
<br>
If you&#39;ve seen pictures of the result, are you satisfied with how it came out aesthetically?

PI with scrotal graft, same as Dr Bowers&#39; baseline technique.
</p>
<p>
Hard to know for sure at this point, I saw the photo of my vulva before they applied the dressing, it looked we&#39;ll put together, with the usual clitoral prominence from immediate post-op appearance. I got to take a better look at it this morning when the dressing was removed, my clitoris was nicely hooded, and while the vulva is swollen and bloody, I think I&#39;ll be happy with the aesthetics as it heals.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll have good sensation, I&#39;ve already started to feel parts of it, and I definitely felt the dressing coming off of my hood.
