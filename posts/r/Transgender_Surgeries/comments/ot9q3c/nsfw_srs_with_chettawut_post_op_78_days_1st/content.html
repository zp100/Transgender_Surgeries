Thank you for sharing, dear heart. I remember being where you currently are. I am now four years post op. There is such a wonderful journey of light, love and self discovery ahead of you.
</p>
<p>
These pictures are just the start of that journey.

Thank you! Just had my second dilation- still a bit tight but feels much better afterward and not as arduous.
</p>
<p>
Tips everyone: if a bit tight during dilation, make sure you have regular bowel movements.  Those laxatives they provide- use them!

You look absolutely lovely! This is actually the first Chett result I‚Äôve seen from another black woman and it‚Äôs incredibly helpful. Thank you for sharing.

Thank you everyone- so far, the pain has been manageable (I go on and off the painkillers / take a reduced dosage) and I managed to get 6 inches of depth.  The catheter is beyond annoying (gets taken out on Friday) and then I feel incredibly swollen!
</p>
<p>
Chett and his team of nurses have been incredibly nice and kind and I would recommend them all over again.  Sometimes the nurses can be strict in terms of wanting you to lay in a specific position but obviously they want you to have a good result.  The way they hold your hand and make sure you‚Äôre okay when dilating underscores that.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm just nervous due to some anxiety regarding dilation and my 6 inches of depth being inadequate or simply not good enough, and then feeling really tight / achy afterward.

Looks pretty clean for such a short time after surgery. I hope you are having a fairly painless recovery ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
</p>
<p>
I will be going to Thailand in September (surgery itself in October)... Just hoping that they&#39;re not going to change their restrictions and requirements (regarding covid) too much...

I‚Äôm so swollen right now, I hope mine settles into something decent like yours!
</p>
<p>
Dilation is taking some getting used to though it got much better physically and psychologically with the removal of the catheter.  Now ask me after day 4-6, where you do 75, 90, and 120 minutes of dilation each session!! I‚Äôm mentally prepping for those. üòß

Dont worry! Yours will be great when the swells settle down! Patience because can take long time but its normal‚Ä¶.and yes be ready for the dilation, 3 times a day can take a lot of time, but you‚Äôll survive‚Ä¶each month will get more easy! Good luck!
