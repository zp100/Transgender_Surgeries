Anyone who is planning to get SRS, pelvic floor therapy is the most important factor in raising success rate of surgery and easier recovery. Dilation is not simply to keep the canal from closing but to reduce scar tissue. Please start pelvic floor therapy asap.

As someone who just completed my pre-surgical pelvic floor therapy, I can see how this greatly benefits both muscle development and healing process. I absolutely support this approach.

Yup. During the healing process the canal will tighten and if you don’t size up in time, you stretch the skin which is still healing and thus can stretch scars making them thick and super noticeable.

I went to min Jin and he wants patients on orange before week 6. Many get it sooner like week 1-4. A few like literally less than a dozen have been sized smaller due to physical limitations.

I’m just starting to look into pre-surgical pelvic floor therapy. If I may ask, is that something that was covered by insurance? Also, how did you go about finding a PT that was knowledgeable about what would be good therapy for pre-vaginoplasty patients?

It was required by my surgeon. Just call and ask if they are knowledgeable in transgender pelvic floor or put them in contact with surgical staff. Typically a decent health insurer will cover most of PT. Mine is a $350 deductible and then a 15% co-pay after deductible met. After 3 sessions, I’m still under the deductible amount, but I will have pelvic floor sessions after surgery (sept) that will bring me past the deductible amount and into the 15% co-pay range.

Sounds like they aren’t familiar with trans folkscis vaginalism or they don’t want to work with trans folks. Just as with doctors surgeons there are good ones and bad ones.

Thanks for bringing this up! What do you recommend for getting started with that? Also, just out of curiosity, are there any studies or anything that show the efficacy of PFT?

No but it’s common sense. Min Jun might make it mandatory but he’s on the fence since some people don’t access to it. You cant just do therapy but have to practice it daily just like exercising. Cis women who have vaginal over tightness go through it too as treatment.

You can start it on your own but it’s best to have a therapist because if you do it wrong it can take longer to un learn he bad habits.

Pelvic floor therapy is a waste of time and money. I had 4 different women staring at me. Even when I was struggling to get it in, they kept saying I&#39;m doing good and that I don&#39;t have to worry about all the dots in. It just left me disappointed and distressed. They&#39;re just there to see if you don&#39;t hit any bones

Sounds like they just wanted patients. Min Jin has specific one he gave instructions and they do all that and stick their finger up your butt before hand or in your vagina after surgery to feel how you are doing right. If they didn’t that then yeah you went to half assed ones. Just like with doctors there are bad ones.

It’s different than kegels. You need to learn to relax the muscle.

Can’t kegels help with that though? Because you learn to tighten, it also helps to recognize when they’re relaxed?

It’s not a scam as literally my surgeon said it’s the number one complication for surgery for him as he has a very low complication rate outside of dilationgranulation. It’s best to first do it with a therapist so they can check if you are doing it right as learning the wrong was takes much longer to unlearn/relearn than doing it right first just like with weight lifting and form. For pre op, they stick their gloved finger up your butt while you so the exercises. Some folks have specific issues that only specific exercises help.

I totally agree with that, but unfortunately for me I only started pelvic floor therapy 6 months after surgery. And this is not the best decision. But that&#39;s what happened. Now I also suffer from uti and this is already the 4th or 6th time this has happened and also from urinary incontinence. I know it can happen from a weak pelvic floor. So I really recommend it

I had zero depth and had a lot of pain related to very tight scar tissue.
</p>
<p>
I followed all the guidance from my surgeon and after 6 months I was still in constant pain. My surgeon recommended scar massage and pelvic floor physiotherapy both of which provided some temporary help but didn&#39;t address the root of the issue.
</p>
<p>
After trying these two suggestions and following all of my surgeon&#39;s directions for another 6 months she finally agreed to see me for a revision consult. At this consult my surgeon determined that the only option was to do a revision to remove the scar tissue that has constricted and was causing me pain.
</p>
<p>
It took another year for that revision surgery to be scheduled.
</p>
<p>
Recovery from this revision was slow and painful but less intense than my original surgery. After about 3 months of recovery I finally turned a corner and it was like night and day. One day I walked up the stairs and realized that it didn&#39;t cause me pain in the same way I had been experiencing for the last nearly 2 years.
</p>
<p>
Since then I have been able to get off my pain meds and have been doing pelvic floor physiotherapy to recover the strength and endurance that I lost during my long painful recovery. At this point I am having the best sex of my life and things are so much better.
</p>
<p>
It took a lot of work and self advocacy. I had to keep bothering my surgeon to insist that what I was experiencing was not an acceptable result and that it was medically necessary for them to continue to provide me with healthcare.
</p>
<p>
There is a path to healing and you can get there. Don&#39;t give up hope.

Hi,
</p>
<p>
Chet girl here aswell! First 3 months were hell for me so much granulation, to the point of missing my dilation because of bleeding. been seeing my Dr twice a week. It did get better after 3 months! My only suggestion is to have a family dr that really specializes Trans health care! Im really lucky with my Dr because she stops all my granulation, and dilation is not painful anymore! She gave me all the support I needed post op care! Also having that family or friends gives you solid support helps me cope! You will get there ❤️

Dilation just becomes a muscle memory to me like cleaning ears, I still use the Thailand brand lube, have you tried other brand of lubes? To make ur dilation easier?
</p>
<p>
I was bleeding constantly once I got home from Thailand, I can’t walk properly for 2 months, I was depressed cuz I’m not getting sunlight, since walking was painful. I have to drink painkillers 4 times a day! After 3 months of constant Dr visit it all went away! Try your LGBT centre see if they could help you find a trans specialist Family Dr.

I&#39;m pretty much the same, had SRS 7 months ago and due to significant complications it looks like a failed science project and functionally it&#39;s completely useless (and i&#39;m still always in pain). The worst thing is i think it&#39;s too fucked up to be fixed to an acceptable level. I&#39;ve talked about this with my surgeon recently and even he agreed that revision will be hard and to manage my expectations. I&#39;ve seen so many good results, i&#39;ve done everything right and this was my chance to at least be happy with one part of my body. I just can&#39;t think about my future anymore, never been more suicidal and hopeless

I just learned to look up what the pain scale means. A 4 on the scale tells the doctors that it interferes with sleep. I told them I was 2~3 on pain, not realizing that would be below concern for them. It wasn&#39;t until I talked about how the pain impacted me that they did something about it (Botox to the snatch)

I was operated by Dr. Brassard in Montreal. Thankfully i live in Montreal so i&#39;ve been able to see him for follow ups in person. It did take a while for him to be honest with me, don&#39;t know why. I guess he wanted to wait until it had healed past a certain point before coming to a conclusion? Or maybe to not make me worry (even thought it did the opposite)? Either way, i can&#39;t change what happened, my doctor got me started on antidepressants so that i can make it to an eventual revision in a year but if it fails like i feel it will, i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll have any other option. I don&#39;t want (can&#39;t) to live my life like this. Except for the very rare post like yours, reading this sub is like digital self-harm now, crazy how last year it made me so excited
</p>
<p>
Anyway, i hope it will somehow get better for us, we don&#39;t deserve this

Hi. I’m 4 months post op. Not so long time, but from surgery day, till now, I experience non stop pain, feeling like super tucked, bleeding 1-2 times weekly, hypertrophic scars, keloid scars, excessive skin of vulva (surgeon already said, need revision 12 months after surgery), vulva feels sticky and I can’t walking normal, super sensitive between folds and any light touch cause very strong pain. I can orgasmic, but it’s possible only if I stimulate vulva from top long time, and I need to be strong, I feeling pain, and after long pain I can get orgasm. On the end of 1st week after surgery, was a lot dehiscence, and surgeons PA said, that not so horrible. But I was shocked. I’m regret it? I still want to believe, everything will improve. But to be honest, I already thinking sometimes, SRS was mistake.

Sorry you are having a hard time with your recovery but please understand you are not alone. Some of us have a lot of pain and multiple complications.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 2.5 years post srs and still in pain with a non functional vagina.
</p>
<p>
At 6 months I felt pretty down similar to how you feel and it is not a nice place to be in. What has helped me is a load of therapy for my mental health and finding other things in my life to replace sex. I can be intimate with my partner without touching or involving my groin and by making her happy I can feel some of it as well. It&#39;s not great but it&#39;s better than nothing and tbh as long as she is happy then that&#39;s all that matters to me now, I really don&#39;t want to lose her.
</p>
<p>
At one point I was in tears with anger and frustration every time I tried to climax both with my partner and without her. Now I just do the minimal amount of cleaning it and other than that don&#39;t touch it at all. If she goes anywhere near it I just freeze up no matter how gentle she is. Its a mixture of chronic pain PTSD and anxiety for me that&#39;s not got any better.
</p>
<p>
Tried sex counselling but she didn&#39;t know enough about SRS and the issues that I was having and tbh I wasn&#39;t going to pay for her time so I could teach her about it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m living my life now despite having a non functional groin that looks horrible. I&#39;m sending all the good vibes to try and help with your healing. Good luck!
</p>
<p>
If you want to chat or vent feel free to DM me but im in Europ so the times may be difficult,  saying that it&#39;s 4am here and I can&#39;t sleep so 🙃

No problem.
</p>
<p>
Serous pain killers are working including MST and pregabalin. It&#39;s still there though and I&#39;m constantly worried about the GP just stopping them and being in agony again. It&#39;s an easy fix for a surgeon but they took forever to even admit I have an issue. Now they have admitted it and said they would apply for funding but 4 months later and they still haven&#39;t done it. It&#39;s a disgrace.
</p>
<p>
Mirtazapine for the PTSD and anxiety. It&#39;s not ideal and I wake up with a dry mouth and headache petty much every day no matter how much water I drink. Its better than the alternative of wishing I was dead on a daily basis though.

Unfortunately some peoples bodies do not heal the way others do . Everyone’s surgical outcome is different and I am so sorry that your procedure did not go well. I hope you can find peace at some point and hopefully get a revision that will correct this ! ❤️

I’m so sorry this has worked out this way for you OP.
</p>
<p>
I just celebrated my one year post SRS with Chet and I’ve had the opposite experience to you.  No dehiscence, no complications, no UTIs.  I worked my way up to dilator number 5.
</p>
<p>
Yes the dilation routine is enormously time consuming but intimately worth it as I discovered ways to strengthen my pelvic floor while doing it as well.
</p>
<p>
I do have sex regularly now and recently found my partner can tell when I’m purposefully tightening my pelvic floor for their enjoyment.  It’s otherworldly and very enjoyable.
</p>
<p>
I deeply hope you can find yourself to this place.  FYI - I didn’t try to have sex until 8 months post op as I didn’t feel my body was ready until then.  The wait was worth it.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes to you OP. 🌸❣️

Hi, I&#39;m sorry for what you&#39;re going through.May I ask you what sort of complications you had to have revision? And also, when you say you can only blame him partly, do you think you could have done anything better/different? I have srs scheduled with him in a few weeks

Thank you for replying. Sorry all this happened to you. It&#39;s also sad because what we pay isn&#39;t little, and being put in these situations in such a vulnerable position makes it even worse.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sort of preparing myself to deal with these issues, do you have any idea how much you paid extra for revision? Also, did you stay in their hospital/hotel?

I had similar side effects as yours and dilation is the same, but took me 20 months until I had some libido. I suggest to be patient. It&#39;s still the beginning and things get better

I’m in the same situation as you and I don’t recommend SRS to anyone.

The complication rate is around 15%. That&#39;s something to keep in mind for All y&#39;all wearing rose-tinted shades.

I&#39;m over two years post-op, and I&#39;m still having nerve issues. Plus: my clit still hurts when I rub it, I&#39;m still dilating several times a week, my libido is nil (might be life stress), I&#39;ve stopped producing lubrication. I don&#39;t regret it, weirdly enough, but it sure is inconvenient

Different reasons for me, turns out I didn&#39;t want a vagina and now I&#39;m in the process of scheduling consults for phallo now. What I can relate to is intimacy suddenly becoming daunting and very difficult. I was able to eventually find ways to do things in a way that I like with a partner, but on my own it&#39;s pretty bleak. I&#39;m not at all motivated to use my body as is. The similarities stop there though. I&#39;m sure this has been on your mind, but could you do a revision still? I guess maybe a total redo would be wording it better. If you got PI, there&#39;s colon as an option
