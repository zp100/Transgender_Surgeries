Revisions most often have a cost, no matter the results from the first operation. You will have to check with your insurance about coverage. I&#39;m getting a revision to just get more depth in my vagina through my health insurance.

If you search this sub by “revisions” you can see that they’re performed in most SRS patients, usually not for free, and patients tend to report that there is not a lot of info about revisions on the surgeons’ official websites.
</p>
<p>
Suporn’s clinic used to offer a free/included revision from what I understand but that’s no longer the case. (No longer included/free).
</p>
<p>
I don’t think you’d get this at any Australian clinic, for a start. You only have a couple of surgeons to go with unless you travel overseas. EDIT-
<a href="http://www.supornclinic.com/HTML/Support/commitment.html" rel="nofollow">here’s the info on revisions</a>
from the Suporn clinic. Seems they do still do it for some patients but with a long list of exclusions.

It&#39;s hard to tell and I may be wrong, but I don&#39;t think revisions are all that common except with Suporn patients (they appear to go in greater numbers for smaller reasons).
</p>
<p>
Apart from the issue of payment, it seems some surgeons don&#39;t want to do them unless its quite bad. I guess it depends on your reason for wanting a revision - personally I&#39;d go just for aesthetic reasons not functional.
</p>
<p>
Unless you&#39;re looking at Suporn I think its better to try and find a surgeon where you&#39;re less likely to need a revision. If you do end up actually needing a revision you probably won&#39;t be so concerned about the cost, but finding someone who can help at all. For some of the serious cases I&#39;ve read about its a big problem.

It may depend on the surgeon. With some surgeons functional revisions are included within a specific time, around a year. For example if there is excessive hooding limiting sensation, or there are restrictions with urine flow. It may be a good idea to look up what they specify.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise many surgeons do revisions, it may be an idea to make a few photos and ask what their opinion would be. Asking how much experience they have with revisions, and how it might affect sensation may be a good idea.
