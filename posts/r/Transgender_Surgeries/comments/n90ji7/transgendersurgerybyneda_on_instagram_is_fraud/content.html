Dr. Toby Mayer follows them on insta so I thought they’d be a legit FFS clinic in Turkey, but no. I don’t think Turkey is really a good place for FFS. idk about the credibility of the doctors that work there but they’re names are: Dr. Ervin Er, Prof K. Yelken, prof M. Turegun, Assoc. Prof Harun Ozkan). On their website it says they are board certified doctors but when I checked their credentials there were no board certifications. Their head hunter Neda called me when I wouldn’t answer his texts for like 1 min which was sketchy (and desperate!) and their website had a lot of typos. Besides the fact that they’re pics are fake, and some of the patients&#39; pics he sent me look botched (I can&#39;t show you for privacy reasons), they’re very unprofessional and don’t even know what board certifications are. Anyways beware guys. Also thinking we should start a discussion section for all the sketchy doctors we meet to keep people safe.

FYI:
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45731191">The BBC carrier for some time (reported) some fatal horror stories about medical tourism in Turkey.</a>
Be aware that BBL carries heightened risk due to the procedure itself (fat transfer), some doctors don&#39;t do it because of it (inviting death, not a good look on your doctors CV).

if they put the after as &#39;before&#39; and the before as &#39;after&#39; and said that the person had naturally aged from 21 to 60, I&#39;d still question if it was the same person :)
</p>
<p>
got to be the most egregious fake before-after i&#39;ve ever seen :)
</p>
<p>
edit: my 15 year old is surprised that the doctors are trying to pass this off as real results.

oh gosh... i thought that the younger girl, that it was hair and shadow... yeah, i guess that is supposed to be some tattoo, which theyve also somehow feminized :P lol
</p>
<p>
i mean, the only thing in common between the pictures is the shape of the eyebrows :) :)
</p>
<p>
i&#39;d not want that change anyway... as a fellow late 40s latina (picture one), do i really want surgery to be an early 20s white woman? ;)

I don&#39;t trust surgeons who are very active on social media platforms like Instagram. Good surgeons are too busy doing surgeries.

Social media is one of the best ways surgeons can advertise themselves and most actually have a team dedicated to running their social media.

I like to think good surgeons don&#39;t need extensive advertising. They tend to get it from word of mouth via happy patients.

they used a FaceApp filter. that’s why the “after” looks characteristically brightened and the tattoo is warped—it got caught in the morph process.

Turkey is definitely a risk but I should add that I accompanied a friend to turkey for FFS (as I speak Turkish), we went to memorial hospital to a plastic surgeon who wasn’t even advertised as doing ffs (cause it’s kinda bad for the surgeons in turkey) but he was a very professional and experienced plastic surgeon (had been on national TV many times). He did also not speak English well so I had to do all the translations. Anyways, the results turned AMAZING! She couldn’t be happier with the service in return for money. I’m just telling this to mention there are good and bad surgeons everywhere (incl. turkey) what makes turkey risky is the lack of English proficiency among surgeons and there are so many unqualified surgeons that makes it hard to find the right one for ffs

Would you be able to pm me the surgeon’s name? Turkey was my first choice because of the affordability but it’s been hard to find a qualified surgeon.
