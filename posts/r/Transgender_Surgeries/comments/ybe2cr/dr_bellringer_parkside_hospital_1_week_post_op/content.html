Hiya. Just to reassure you that mine swelled right up a few days post op, and my left labia was very swollen for several weeks. I iced it regularly and it has gone down check with nurse re icing see if it&#39;s recommended for you. Until the swelling has gone down you&#39;ll not get a decent look at the rest of your new bits! I was also bruised to hell (see my old pix), it will go down. Looks like the swelling (haematoma) has popped some stitches causing some dehiscence? Keep it clean and most importantly, dry. You&#39;ll be surprised how much difference another week can make.
</p>
<p>
I was icing while in hosp when mine swelled right up, but I have to say that it was me driving this and asking for more ice all the time. PS were not proactive on that front.

&#34;it looks and feels like I have testicles&#34;
</p>
<p>
I felt the same at your point. In my completely personal opinion from my result he doesnt remove enough of the testicular skin and at 11 months post op I still have what I also describe as a excess skin that looks like testicles.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully you will heal better than I did, you are 10 years younger than me so there is hope.
</p>
<p>
Please get some silicone scar sheets or Kelo-Cote. I didn&#39;t start using it until about 1 month post op and honestly I think that was too late to make much difference.
</p>
<p>
Massage E45 Gently into the scar tissue as soon as you can, I would ask the duty sister when this is, they would never give me a straight answer. I would say at about 2 to 3 weeks but I&#39;m just a stranger on the internet, ask Bellringer or the nurses to confirm.
</p>
<p>
If you are dilating, use more lube than you think you need to. Lube the fourchette and the dilator to try and minimise pulling stitches down there.
</p>
<p>
What you do now is extremely important for your long term recovery and to minimise you scarring.
</p>
<p>
Can DM if you want to chat.
</p>
<p>
Congratulations and big hug x

I&#39;ve asked Dr Rashid when I an use arnica cream she said 3 weeks at least. I imagine it&#39;s the same for any other cream... Will look into silicone scar sheets and kelo-cote. Thank you ❤️

Thanks girls, that&#39;s really reassuring and helpful ☺️. On that note, I&#39;m getting contradictionary opinions on the following: 1. Someone said. In my case ibuprofen od Z No and I should only take paracetamol. I thought it&#39;s a strange advise as ibuprofen is anti inflamatory
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Moving around. I&#39;m pushing myself for 1-2h walks as that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told. But it gets more swollen then
</li>
<li>
Clothing for around house but also for walks. Some ppl say loose clothes and pants other say bit of compression is good so like tights etc.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
What you reckon?  Best regards,

It was loose clothes only for me. Imho tights and leggings create just the right environment for bacteria to flourish. Best bet is to get as much air to it as you can - sleep in the buff. After my final dilation of the day I tent to plonk myself on the sofa on a pad spread eagle and watch the Tele - but I do live alone!!
</p>
<p>
Walks wise, rule is to listen to your body. At 2 weeks I was doing max 30 min walks and building gradually, now at almost 6 weeks 10KM in a couple hours or so not a problem. I think my daily runs are still some way off though. Probably better to do a couple of half hour walks rather than one 1 hour walk early on.
</p>
<p>
Pills wise I carried on with the para and ibu for a couple weeks after getting home.

1) I would definitely take ibuprofen, unless your surgeon told you not to.  Your primary problem is swelling and ibuprofen will help most with that.  You can alternate with Paracetamol for maximum pain relief.
</p>
<p>
2) You really walking WAY TOO MUCH this early!  Moving around lightly is good, specifically to prevent blood clots.  But you don&#39;t want to be walking around significantly until its safe to do so.  And after vaginoplasty its not exactly &#34;safe&#34; to move around for a few days.  And the next few you really only want light walks.  From there you slowly build up to longer and longer walks.
</p>
<p>
For my Orchi (a MUCH less intense surgery) my surgery discharge instructions were
</p>
<p>
- No STRENUOUS activity for 4 weeks: bike riding, weight lifting, running, aerobics, sexual intercourse
<br>
- No lifting greater than 10 pounds for 2 weeks.
<br>
- Walk daily and gradually increase your amount of activity.
</p>
<p>
If you are walking 1-2 hours this early... I would basically say its not surprising you have a hematoma and excess swelling.  You&#39;re forcing too much blood and pressure to the area currently during a critical healing period.  I would reduce your walking each day.  Honestly personally I wouldn&#39;t do extra walking post GCS during the first week/two.  And then follow with a slow ramp of walks and light daily activity.
</p>
<p>
3) I recommend very loose clothing while resting.  And comfortable bikeshorts / leggings for when moving around.  You don&#39;t want something really tight on you all the time.  But its nice to have some support when you need to move.

Thank you for such a throughout reply. Following it I&#39;ve called my ward in the hospital and duty sister said:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
No ibuprofen in my case as it can contribute to bleeding more inside (so I think it&#39;s not advised for patients with hematoma?)
</li>
<li>
<p>
She said walking 2h is probably a lot but if I could do it then it&#39;s fine. Maybe because before the surgery I used to do jogging 4-5 times a week.. The scab around stiches gets bigger though though so probs gonna go easier on myself
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Nurse said same thing
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Cheers ☺️

Okay great those answers make perfect sense.  Ibuprofen can increase bloodflow, which could contribute more to a hematoma.  So that is great advice, which that would have occurred to me!
</p>
<p>
But absolutely sounds like they are giving you good advice!  But I would back off on the time walked while your hematoma swelling goes down.  Its good that the color is looking better already!  That&#39;s a good sign!

That is a good question.  And it makes sense you were moving around quiet a bit and looked like you were having leakage.  In which case less movement makes sense till scab formation isn&#39;t occurring (aka leaking blood)

That sounds very reasonable and that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do.. On the train now and of course it&#39;s delayed 😂.. And I need to pee.. Not taking chances to pee on the train though, last thing I need is an infection on top of it..

I would minimise movement,  especially if you are noticing increased swelling afterwards, looks like the stitches popped and you have wound separation. You want that to keep that clean and let it heal to prevent infection.

If you had a full depth Vaginoplasty it will be a good while for the swelling to go down. When do you go back to have your stitches out?

All of Parkside stitches are self dissolving as per discharge document. At 6 weeks, I still have some remaining internally, behind labia, and at fourchette. My internal stitches have come out with the douche, last time I saw evidence of this was just over a week ago.

My surgeon Rachel Bluebond-Langner had to remove my stitches after my swelling went down. I don&#39;t remember exactly how much time passed, probably about three months.

The absolutely most important thing right now is rest.  Some people do get swelling just like this.  Some people do get hematomas.  And the testicle feeling is not abnormal.  Technically speaking somewhere your stumps end (from where your testes were removed) and the stumps themselves will be swollen and feel like testicles themselves for quiet a while.  If the swelling doesn&#39;t go down over the next week (particularly on the side with the hematoma, then they may have to assess your situation.

Huge hugs!
