Hi I&#39;m Arcade, they/them.
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/JiUBbaH.jpg">This is me after waking up from surgery.
</a>
(So that the thumbnail isn&#39;t gross week 1)
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;ve been taking weekly photos ever since the packing came out a week after surgery, (sorry, no week zero, you don&#39;t wanna see that mess of gauze and tubes) and tracking my recovery since, and I figured I&#39;d share. Some details after.

<strong>
The following details are all negative, but I want to preface it by saying that I&#39;m not at all dissatisfied with my results thus far or where I&#39;m at. I&#39;m feeling great (in spite of the apocalypse) and I&#39;m optimistic about the process on a whole, but I want to highlight all the stuff that hasn&#39;t gone quite right because there&#39;s a lot more to say about that than about everything healing and working as it should.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
So. It&#39;s been a trip. I&#39;ve been pretty much able to walk whenever I wanted since being discharged from the hospital, and pain has been incredibly manageable even without opioids really, though there there are frequent mild pangs that I&#39;ll complain endlessly about.
</p>
<p>
At week 3 some stitches popped on the bottom left of my vaginal opening, which was not great but it seems to be recovering well enough regardless, and no one at Boston Medical seemed too worried about it.
</p>
<p>
My clitoral hood is pretty messed up, so that&#39;ll probably need revisions at some point, but it sounded like that&#39;s fairly normal.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t really have defined labia minora, which is probably partially just a result of my labia majora still being a bit swollen, but I&#39;ll probably end up asking about that as well when it comes time for revisions. Admittedly though, that&#39;s not something I care drastically about.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still on the smallest size of dilator, as trying to size up just isn&#39;t working. I&#39;m working with my surgeons office on solutions moving forward, but honestly this is my biggest point of frustration. But this is something that eventually I&#39;ll be past and when that comes I&#39;ll be grateful lol.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has any questions, ask away. I&#39;m gonna go to bed now, but I&#39;ll answer them when I wake up.

At a conference recently the team (maybe Dr. Slama in particular, I don&#39;t remember) implied they preferred to do vulvoplasty because of the easier process and recovery, etc. Did you have any difficulty getting vaginoplasty instead? Were you always sure that&#39;s what you wanted or did it take a while to decide?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing!

That&#39;s interesting because I went in kinda up in the air but slightly leaning towards zero-depth, and got pushed (slightly) toward vaginoplasty. It took a while for me to decide which I wanted but ultimately I&#39;d rather have the depth in case I ever want to use it, even if I suspect penetration will never really be my thing. Dilation definitely adds a lot to the recovery though, and as I mentioned in the OP it hasn&#39;t been cooperating with me specifically exactly.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious, what gender/sex did you tell them your sexual partners were? When I pried why they even needed to ask me that, their response was that it informed them a little on what kinda of surgery might be right. I didn&#39;t have the energy or gall at the time to argue with a PA why that&#39;s nonsense and that there are plenty of lesbians out there getting the strap.

Interesting--I wonder what I missed about that panel to come to the conclusion I did (there were several questions from older women, which I imagine might have influenced the answer for health reasons). Or maybe it&#39;s just stale data. Regardless, you&#39;d know far better than I would! I&#39;m not a surgical patient and haven&#39;t met with them one on one.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard of the partner question but I don&#39;t remember if it was there or somewhere on this sub. It doesn&#39;t feel well-reasoned. My impression (from my endo and the team at large) is that they&#39;d appreciate that kind of feedback if you feel up to it.

He&#39;s so nice and personable. One of my favorite moments was when I was still in the hospital and he showed up to check in on me my mom said something along the lines of &#34;Your PA was showing off everything down there and it looks beautiful.&#34; I didn&#39;t have a good angle, but I could tell the whole thing was a swollen monstrosity lol.
</p>
<p>
Dr Salama turned to me on the spot and said, &#34;Don&#39;t listen to her. It looks like a complete mess and it will continue to for weeks.&#34; (With the obvious &#34;And that&#39;s normal&#34; implied)

Different surgeon but I also have stitches popped on the left side of my vaginal opening! It sucks. I&#39;ve had to remain where I am with my dilator and cant size up till its healed. :/
</p>
<p>
With that said, not unhappy with my result itself. I somewhat consider it lucky this is the only thing I have to deal with. I had to leave early due to the covid stuff and ended up with 48h of travel 14 days postop... not exactly a recipe for bo issues.

Aha I just narrowly avoided it causing any real problems for me, and my parents live nearby so I&#39;ve been recovering/quarantining there since. And yeah, I&#39;m thankful not too much has gone wrong so I&#39;ll take the speedbumps I&#39;m getting!
</p>
<p>
Glad recovery is treating you well too!

Ahh nob problem at all. I&#39;m probably post another one at 3 months and then again at 6. I want to create a clear picture of the gradual process of recovery. &lt;3

Btw this was really interesting to see, I was really curious how it would actually develop from OP day on with short term snapshots. I of course won&#39;t have the same surgeon (aiming for supposedly the best in Germany), but this gives me a rough idea of what to expect!

tell me more about these frequent mild pangs. what causes them? how bad are they? how frequently do you get them?
</p>
<p>
what caused the stitches to pop?
</p>
<p>
how limited are you in movement?
</p>
<p>
why are you struggling so much with dilating?

The mild pangs of pain are just normal recovery. There&#39;s a lot of cranky flesh healing down there, especially in my labia majora, so when it&#39;s stretched in particular ways, when I lay on my side, and sometimes just randomly I&#39;ll feel something not much worse than a firm pinch that goes away about as quickly. It&#39;s annoying, but not too bad.
</p>
<p>
The stitches popped while dilating (so when putting a little pressure on them) but it&#39;s the sort of thing that normally happens. They&#39;re designed to degrade over time so that they&#39;ll fall out and sometimes that&#39;ll happen a little too early if a little bit too much pressure gets placed on them, but it&#39;s not a huge deal and something that&#39;ll get fixed in revisions if it even needs to be fixed at all.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not at all limited in movement now, and I&#39;ve pretty much had full range of movement since I got the packing out at one week post op. I could dance however I liked at two weeks, though after a while on my feet and moving around it&#39;d start to hurt as my sign that I should probably sit down. Honestly I&#39;ve probably been moving more than I should ðŸ˜… but now I&#39;m cleared to do whatever I&#39;d like.
</p>
<p>
I just can&#39;t fit the second size up of dilator in. (Or a second finger if I try it that way) I try and it puts up so much resistance past a certain point that I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll physically go in. It&#39;s frustrating, and definitely not going to plan, but I have no issues with the smallest size they gave me so I&#39;m going to continue on with that until I start physical therapy and ask about it there.

Your results look nice I do have a question though, I notice your.pro nouns of they/ them and was wondering are you non binary? The reason I ask is I am non binary , genderfluid and have a desire for aquiring a vagina , if this is the case how is it worked out with wpath? I apologize if I have been too personal but had to ask  PhylisðŸ’ž

It&#39;s still not very common, but there are people who manage to get SRS without the usual expectations of WPATH.

I don&#39;t mind at all. I&#39;ve been in and out of the closet in terms of being nonbinary, and when I started the process of finding a surgeon I was in the closet. By the time I had my third provider letter I was back out, but I had fantastic healthcare providers that were very diplomatic in how they wrote the letters and explicitly framed them to make the process as low risk as possible. I didn&#39;t encounter any difficulties, but I get the sense that you don&#39;t have to be quite as careful as we were in my case to get that result.

It might be a good idea to play up any dysphoria involved but beyond that, at least in the US, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much to be worried about. Good luck Phylis!

Would you please be able to provide results photos with me? Iâ€™m begging as Iâ€™ve had an impossible time finding any. I need to know if this surgeon is able to meet my aesthetic needs.
