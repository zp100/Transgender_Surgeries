Overall very satistifed with the results.
</p>
<p>
I had covid during the first week of surgery and I was worried results would be fucked due to constantly coughing up phlegm but I&#39;m happy to say that&#39;s not the case. I had a mandatory 5 day vocal rest period.
</p>
<p>
My voice went up around 40hz and what that meant in practice is that it was way easier for me to do a feminine voice. Previously I avoided trying at all with voice because it was too scary because it might cut out in the middle of a conversation. Since surgery I have been gendered female after opening my mouth in the store and even over the phone! :)
</p>
<p>
Voice was very hoarse during recovery, but got better with time to the point where I only get hoarse in the evening if I spoke all day.
</p>
<p>
I had surgery february 7th.
</p>
<p>
voice pre-op (me ranting about league of legends in dutch, I have nothing better, sorry):

Surgeon was very professional but not performatively kind. The &#34;to the point&#34; kind. I also had nasal cautery done because I suffered chronic nosebleeds and they gave me a septum perforation which is very frustating. (Out of the scope of this post but might aswell let u know)

Impressive results.  In the 2 month post op were you making some extra effort to sound female that you weren&#39;t making in the first recording or is that just a natural effortless range now?

Great results! When I had mine done, right after surgery my voice was so high I sounded like a robot. I never had a period where I sounded rough like that. Your voice two months on sounds very good.
