This was a full-depth PI surgery.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Hyer herself said that the surgery went &#34;as perfect as it possibly could,&#34; which was a MASSIVE relief to hear, and I was also only under for a little over 3 hours! Which was shorter than anticipated. She said I have 15cm of depth, and was able to insert the entire packing fully into me. She&#39;s truly a wonderful person and I felt very comfortable in her hands.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m primarily posting about my surgery as I feel she deserves more recognition. When searching around for a surgeon, I had heard very good things about her, but a lot of info was lacking and the amount of post-op pictures online was practically none. So I figured I&#39;d opt in to be one of those people for anyone considering going to her.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me any questions.

This is a reposting from back in November of 2022. I&#39;m primarily doing this as I wanted to separate my other account from surgery related things. Thanks!
