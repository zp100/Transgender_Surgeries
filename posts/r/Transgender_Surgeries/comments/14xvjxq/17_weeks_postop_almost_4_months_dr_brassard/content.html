Wait youâ€™re still dilating with a fistula and Iâ€™m guessing you have confirmation you have one because the doctor told you ?

Yes I&#39;m still dilating. And I didn&#39;t need it confirmed by the doctor, every time I douche there is fecal matter coming from somewhere.
</p>
<p>
But I did go to the doctor and they couldn&#39;t find it. But did see the fecal matter so now I&#39;m on a wait list to get a CT scan or MRI scan to find it. If I do have one it&#39;s not big.
</p>
<p>
Dilating was not to be stoped as request of surgeon. I also like refuse to get a olostomy bag. Due to mental health reasons.

Thank you for responding. I think(I know )  I have a fistula also got a check up yesterday.  I definitely will be getting a second opinion myself. I have not had the type of issues you have had.  Also by you not doing a colostomy (itâ€™s a temporary thing , I heard ?) bag does that mean you could possibly become septic ?

I am unfortunately, I go for a barium X-ray which is the 2nd appointment. As I went for a CT scan. And it wasn&#39;t found.  At this point we&#39;re playing cat and mouse with the problem to find the location.. which makes me understand it&#39;s small.

Thatâ€™s very annoying:/ i I hate you have to go through this &amp; i feel your pain to a certain degree.
</p>
<p>
Are you still dealing with the clinic? If so are they being as helpful as possible? Are you still dilating with orange? Are you still able to be sexually active or is that on pause? What is the day to day like with being as far along post op as you are, do you still experience bottom dysphoria?

I&#39;m still dealing with the clinic yes we&#39;re bridged between local doctor and them for communication they are doing what they can but it&#39;s mostly just instructions to local Doctor right now.
</p>
<p>
I can still be sexually active but I have not been really other then external play out of fear making it worse.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have bottom dysphoria now honestly in ways I miss my penis but not in a I wish I had it sense or regret more just sexually used to playing with one and now it&#39;s gone it&#39;s like hmm would be nice. But that&#39;s what partners are there for!
</p>
<p>
Day to day is good. I&#39;d say currently I&#39;m in a really good place. Other then the fistula everything is going well and pain is very rare but does exist random bursts or scar pain is more a thing now.
