I decided to get a bilateral orchiectomy and scrotectomy performed to treat my gender dysphoria and reduce the unwanted effects testosterone had on my body. I had been self medicating Oestrogen, Progestorone and Spironolactone for 2+ years already.
</p>
<p>
After paying £100 for an initial consultation, my surgery was booked and in my circumstance due to substantial prior evidence I did not require any signed letters etc.
</p>
<p>
Luckily I had my partner to support me during the surgery and recovery. We drove up to Wales and stayed at a hotel the night before. Surgery day went well and I spent the following night in hospital after being discharged. Driving back home 3hr’s was uncomfortable (bled a bit) so I would suggest staying in the area for 1-2 more days.
</p>
<p>
My following recovery is documented in a diary along with daily pictures, and further comparison pictures all

.

It has now been 4 months since my surgery in Feb ’23 and I have healed completely, with no complications. I am feeling better than ever, and have no regrets. Heres a quick FAQ:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Total costs: £4381
</li>
<li>
Costs don’t include travel/accommodation and sperm banking which I did
</li>
<li>
I can still get an erection exactly the same as before
</li>
<li>
I can still orgasm, and it feels the same if not more ‘full body’
</li>
<li>
My ejaculate is now a very small amount of clear fluid pretty much like pre-cum (see
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_eha6JPqsHNZC7Vj-5woNxrLFArk0A6S?usp=share_link">here
</a>
)
</li>
<li>
My libido has remained the same throughout
</li>
<li>
I have noticed HRT drugs now taking a more pronounced effect
</li>
<li>
Hair growth reduced particularly on face (very welcome change)
</li>
<li>
Tucking is now far easier and more comfortable, no sweaty balls!
</li>
<li>
As a result of better tucking I can now exclusively wear women’s underwear which is far comfier
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If anybody is considering this procedure I would highly recommend Dr Christian Seipp. He was friendly and supportive the whole way through despite me not being a more traditional FtM patient. Additionally I am now trying to get a shared care agreement setup with my GP with his support. Any further questions please comment/dm me!

Hey thanks so much for this. I was wondering about tucking. Is it flat when you tuck? Do you think you could wear a bikini? I wear bikinis now but there is a bit of a bulge, mostly from my balls which I tuck up into my inguinale canals, and also where I tape my scrotum around my penis. I kind of think that if I had an orchi i would be able to tuck almost totally flat, but I&#39;d love your thoughts!
