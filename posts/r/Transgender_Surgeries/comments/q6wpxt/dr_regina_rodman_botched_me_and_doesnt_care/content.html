She’s a butcher no question about it. I remember  on a previous post you said you were speaking to Mardi about a revision? How is that going and have you done any tried any scar treatment. Sending you love and healing.

Are you doing micro needling? I’ve seen good results from it. Also I think revisions usually caught more unfortunately, have you considered working at one of the companies that cover surgeons like mardi?
</p>
<p>
Also what did Rodman say about the scar and lip lift? How could someone even try to defend that work

for the scars, have you tried dry tattooing? i have seen some really good reviews on it.
</p>
<p>
Im so sorry this happened to you, you should definitely sue, im pretty sure you might even get a lawyer to do it pro bono

This is what Lawyers and lawsuits are for. The choice is yours. I would think any decent lawyer would work pro bono for a future pay off in this instance

No lawyer will take up a plastic surgery malpractice case. That&#39;s just how it is.

It&#39;s incredibly difficult to prove malpractice claims and there isn&#39;t a lot of money in it for lawyers unless it&#39;s a wrongful death.

I would recommend hair transplant for the hairline but the lip would be more complex. A z-plasty w tattoo maybe. I am afraid that scar will be permanent but you might be able to improve the shape

Hi Emma, where are you from? I haven&#39;t been very in social media bc I have  building my practice and I really don&#39;t like exposing my patients but I can answer people&#39;s questions. So guide me here, do I just start a new trend saying who I am and invite for questions?

Yes, with a few caveats. You might set a time so people who want to ask you questions can. Then you might limit the time to an hour or two. Otherwise you may be stuck here forever. I&#39;ll DM you some additional info.

A hair transplant could work on the sides but her scar is so low that if she were to implant hairs to her forehead, it would have a masculinizing effect and also ruin her proportions

My Dear, The post by someone earlier saying that  Attorneys don&#39;t take  transgender cases is some what wrong. I mean  it&#39;s been that way  for us over the past 10 years + . But I am trying to bring this kind of legal thinking  from the lawyers is down right unfair not to help us. I have the only known case right now in the Superior Court Of California County of LA. Malpractice against a Plastic surgeon and its  for the Butcher job he did on me  in 2019. this surgeon is one of the big named transgender Plastic Surgeons in Beverly Hills California. He has all the fancy website looks and  has pages of  the work he  does but there are alot of pages of the work he F_ _ Ks up more than  he lets out. He make deals with the screw ups and offers them  free surgeries to smooth things over. In my case there is nothing left between my legs to smooth over and its taken me 20 months and 3 other surgeons that  wouldn&#39;t take the reconstructions of my bottom surgery. I have gone through hell then help came from a place I never  figured they were doing these surgeries UCLA Transgender Heath Center. So I am going  in finely Nov. 17th 2021.  But please hang in there with me there are a lot of people that are keeping my posts active  because I am winning this case , it&#39;s taken a 18 months to get here but I have been through all the papers the dispositions and the case is now open for  litigation which we expect he will not  let us  get him in a Court because it will be on line I am sure. He&#39;s making  offers to me so  we are going  for the max. but money isn&#39;t the winner here its a case to show other Surgeons that they can now be sued  for there disrespecting  of our lives , screwing us and walking away is going to come to a stop thats my winning  for all of the LGBT+ any other treated unfair groups of gender forms. I am a living mess from this surgeon. By the way  his name is Dr Alexander S. SinClair.  I can say this because my Lawyers say so. !!!Let him say no.?   So look up my older posts and I believe there is a link  to a picture of my surgery. No tears, mine are all we need. Your life is worth it.Hang in there. TG Jillian

thats so unfair, i wonder if a dermatologist or plastic surgeon could help, but either way that&#39;s so evil of the &#34;doctor&#34;. if you aren&#39;t able to change these results i hope you find peace. i dont want to invalidate how you feel bc i can&#39;t imagine what this is like, but personally there is nothing unsightly about you, youre truly a beautiful woman and as someone who like women i would totally say hi :)

I’m sorry for what your going through, but to my liking you look really good, and also you have such a great side profile, wish I had it like that, looks pretty fem, but I think the only really visible thing it’s the lip darling, the second chin hopefully I don’t think it’s visible from the front and any other side that’s isn’t looking from down.
</p>
<p>
If you don’t mind me, to know a little more about ur case, what procedures did you get with her? And where all done at once.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best sis.

I have to agree, if she fixes the lip and lets the hairline scar fade, she&#39;ll look great. I know OP mentioned her nose but actually I think it looks really good

Problem is that the hairline scar will always be visible and even fixing her lip is hard with this little skin left between the nose and lips.
</p>
<p>
I had a similar problem at my hairline. I got it covered with transplants but my forehead is a little low now which makes my face more masculine even without a brow bridge. My lip lift scar healed quite poorly as well but I can&#39;t get it fixed because my philtrum would be too small afterwards

You may never be able to flawlessly repair it, but you can certainly improve it to the point where it doesn&#39;t look unnatural, just a bit unique. I know that OP is hurting a lot, but I think that she&#39;s on her way to looking really nice despite these issues

I agree that your results are very poor and should be actionable. I’m sorry you have had to experience these issues.  Please be careful with what you write online if you plan to seek legal redress.
</p>
<p>
Looking at your pics, I think your nose and brows don’t stand out to me as botch jobs.  They seem like reasonable outcomes.  The lips and scarring on the forehead incision is where the actionable problem seems to be.
</p>
<p>
On the plus side,  think your lips can be fixed with filler.   As an old tranny (59) aging changes everything.  My lips got to be uneven just via gravity.  Dr. Z got them even about five years ago with fat, but I will need a redo because of more aging.  Anyway, that part is an easy fix.
</p>
<p>
The scarring is not such an easy fix.  Those of us with medium or darker skin tend to have scarring that is unpredictable.  You might be able to get it lasered or there is a peel designed for darker skins that might fix it.Why the surgeon cut you that low, is beyond me.
