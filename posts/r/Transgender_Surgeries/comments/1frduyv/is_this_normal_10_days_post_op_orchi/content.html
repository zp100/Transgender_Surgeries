looks normal. yellow stuff appears to be the remnants of wound glue. the pace of healing will probably pick up over the next week or so. it may take a bit for the raised part of the incision scar to settle down into the surrounding tissue

Also should mention it’s been a bit itchy on and off - assuming that’s normal too

Itchy is SUPER normal for wounds like this. Just don’t scratch/pull at it. Basically, leave it alone except for the treatments your doctor instructs you to do. Looks like it is healing nicely!

I&#39;m gonna echo the other reply here and say that yes, the itching is indeed normal. It&#39;s part of the process, apparently it&#39;s due to an inflammatory response, and the increase in blood supply being pushed there makes it worse.
</p>
<p>
Taking Zyrtec can help for the inflammatory response, while icing can help with the swelling.

Looks totally normal. Mine was the same way with the raised tissue around the cut. Now 18 months later there is just a faint line of skin that is lighter in color than the rest of my sack. Not raised at all. My surgical glue was purple and they must have dropped the whole jar on mine because it was covering the whole sack and took almost a month to fully come off.
</p>
<p>
The itch is just wond healing and normal don&#39;t pick or scratch at it.

The yellow stuff is normal. I, who am not a medical professional, would guess that stuff is your sutures. Just from the way they&#39;re spread apart and sticking out. The yellow could be puss or something like that.
</p>
<p>
Sutures would be the reason you&#39;re feeling tugging, too. It&#39;ll get better with time.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, it looks great, and I don&#39;t think I need to be a medical professional to say that with confidence. It&#39;s not red and puffy from any infection, nor is it necrotic. Unless you&#39;re in heinous pain, I don&#39;t see a reason to be alarmed.
</p>
<p>
Just keep doing what you&#39;re doing! Congratulations on the orchi! I got mine about two years before bottom surgery, and it was one of the best things I could have done! I hope you have the same experience.

Def keep going with the salt water but dab with a full cotton wool ball. Salt water should always be the first option for keeping a wound clean. This looks very clean to me.

if the scar tissue bothers you, once its healed and you’re cleared by your doctor you can buy some scar gel to work the scar tissue away.

It looks fine. You should see some bruising next. Don&#39;t worry it goes away fast.

I would definitely ask your doctor. I never really noticed anything whenever I had my orchi but I also didn&#39;t really check it as often as I should have.

FAR better than mine. I was swollen the size of a grapefruit for 3 weeks. 7 months later it finally looks as expected.

Dr said a hematoma. I literally thought it would explode. Most intense pain ever and couldn&#39;t walk hardly for days. Peed in shower for over a month because the tip was buried or barely visible. I will spare you the details how I had to #2 since I couldn&#39;t even sit and pee. My left vas supposedly was twice as thick as usual so had to be cut 2x and said that was the cause. But the right is where it was all at. Pretty sure they fucked something up and why I won&#39;t go back there for any surgery despite supposedly being best in my area.

As a surgical nurse for 35 yrs. The day 10 photos look good. The scar tissue should shrink a bit but will always be there. Any crust and scabs at the suture site will fall off. Keep it clean. If it gets caught at night try sleeping in your underwear. You seem well along in the healing process but be aware if there is any new swelling or pus.
