I&#39;m keeping a diary of my time at GRS Montreal and sharing it here for you lovely folks to read. I&#39;ll answer any comments or questions I get. Otherwise, just enjoy the show.

So my roommate found my reddit posts &gt;.&lt; Thank goodness I hadn&#39;t ranted about how loud she eats sunflower seeds yet xD She asked for a shout out so here it is: A, let me know when you read this and if it&#39;s under an hour since posting, I&#39;ll have my wife bring your favourite snack tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Happy Thanksgiving! My family doesn&#39;t really do anything to celebrate so I&#39;m not missing much stuck in here. Instead I&#39;ll tell you what I am thankful for, the stent and catheter were both removed this morning!
</p>
<p>
The last sutures stung pretty bad coming out, but you forget that pretty quickly once you start moving around. Changing positions (eg. Getting into/out of bed or using the toilet) are hardly painful at all now. There is still pain, especially if I twist the wrong way or just move too much; that&#39;s just down to the surgery site now, so it&#39;ll slowly lessen and the swelling will slowly decrease until it&#39;s nothing at all.
</p>
<p>
For the catheter, I guess I got lucky. The other two women I spoke to had theirs in an extra day. The nurses test that the swelling has decreased enough, then it comes out with a sensation I cannot put to words. After that, they have you pee into a container and also measure how much urine is unable to drain from the bladder afterwards. I measured well first time so I&#39;m officially free of that blasted thing.
</p>
<p>
Peeing without a penis is certainly an experience. I&#39;m still swollen so it just pours out along my underside, but that should fix itself in time. I read somewhere here that a lot of the peeing sensation comes from the penis head and you don&#39;t realise that until it&#39;s gone, and that is spot-on. I feel liquid moving internally, then I hear the sound before I realise it&#39;s coming out already.
</p>
<p>
I also started dialating today. There&#39;s a nurse to literally guide your hand the first time which I&#39;m very grateful for. I&#39;ve now done all 3 for today (I wrote the first half of this post while dialating xD) and everything&#39;s going smoothly, so I don&#39;t have much else to add.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to try sleeping on my side for the first time in nearly a week. Talk to y&#39;all tomorrow!
</p>

Glad to hear things are coming along nicely for you. I hope they fed you something special for Thanksgiving?

Thank you! There was turkey at lunch and roast pork at dinner, but both were way below the usual standard tbh

Happy Thanksgiving! That&#39;s interesting about the peeing thing. I never really thought about that sensation being different since it&#39;s rerouted after surgery. I&#39;m glad dilation went well too, it sounds like you&#39;re healing up really well. Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
