Its swelling. Itâ€™ll be pretty swelled up for months potentially.

Congrats! I had my bottom surgery with Ferrando back at the beginning of September last year and, yeah, it&#39;s gonna look like that for the first few weeks lol
</p>
<p>
I can definitely say that she and her surgical team and her fellows (for post-op appointments) were and are all incredibly thoughtful and wonderful. As well, being almost 9 months on, the healing went really well and I&#39;ve been incredibly happy with the results.
