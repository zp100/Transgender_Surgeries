Hi everyone, my grs in on Wednesday and I’m in hotel near the hospital. I’m start crying and I can’t stop, I’m feeling far from home and from my partner, I’m feeling so vulnerable. I know it’s not exactly the good spirit to face this surgery but I’m feeling so sad. Do you think is safe to stay near the clinic 2 weeks after the surgery? I’m 5 hours drive from home (I don’t drive by myself, I’m passenger).
</p>

I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re having so much anxiety, and it&#39;s perfectly normal, don&#39;t be ashamed. Its a major surgery, you have every right to be nervous. I hope you can find something to help distract you. A warm shower always feels good to me, and great thing about hotels is I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever run out of hot water :)
</p>
<p>
As for after the surgery, I think it probably would be best to stay the 2 weeks if you can afford it. The help with wound care and having the team nearby in case of complications will be invaluable. If you and your partner live somewhere with good medical facilities with doctors who are familiar with GRS, then it&#39;d probably be ok. Otherwise I think it would be better if your partner come visit you a few times in those 2 weeks to help with homesickness, if they can visit. Good luck, and I hope everything goes well

My surgery is Wednesday too! I get to my hotel tomorrow morning. I&#39;ve been in fight or flight for hours. I know this is what I want..I&#39;ve wanted it for so long and done so much to work towards it, but I can&#39;t calm down my anxiety and just feel like crying.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s totally normal to feel this way. We will survive and get through it. You got this girl!

Hang in there sweetie. It’s understandable why you feel this way, but in a month you’ll be home. It’s not recommended to sit in a car for long after vaginoplasty. My surgeon told me that after the month I’ll be down there for, on the ride home, I’ll need to get out and walk often. You’ve gotten this far, you can do this! 🌸🌸

My surgery is tomorrow, Wednesday too. In my case, that excitement is more than the anxiety. So sorry you are feeling lonely and nervous. I trust everything is going to be OK. I am not sure what to advise you, but hang to the positive and try to do things that keep you distracted. I wish you a good luck.

I was an escalating wreck for 2 months before mine. I just got home the other day after being away just like you. I did it and so can you 💜

I originally went through what you are describing in March 2017. I was all alone. I was in NYC. My then fiance stayed home in Maryland. I concentrated on my surgery and everything surrounding it.

I was puking my brains out and couldn’t eat for 2 days beforehand. Its a lot! But those good good drugs they’ll give you will be a big help after.

Hang in there 🙏 girl you will get through this.  Sometimes crying is the best thing so cry if you need too.  Praying 🙏 for you and a speedy recovery 🙏.  You got this. You&#39;re not alone.

It&#39;s Wednesday, as I reply. I hope everything went smoothly, and you are safely out of surgery now. Sending you strength to get healed up quickly.

Had my surgery yesterday and now I’m so tired. Everything is ok, I only lost some blood. Thank you so much for your message, I’ll do a new post when I’ll be less tired.
