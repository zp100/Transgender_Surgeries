Yeah, it&#39;s really messy at this point.  Is your swelling increasing or decreasing?  Are the black parts growing or pretty constant?
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s your pain level at, and how is dilating for you?

Swelling stays consistent if I don&#39;t keep icing. I just trimed some of the gauze that was falling off because it was pretty detached and very moist so as far as the black parts those are newly revealed. Pain goes from around a 2 or 3 and then can jump up to around 8 and dilating had gone alright but I still feel really tender and sore. I have to take it really slow and use a lot of lube but I figured that&#39;s normal.

Everything seems fine.  The black parts could just be some dried blood, could be some tissue dying.  It&#39;s worth letting your surgeon know about, but there&#39;s not much that can be done.  It just needs to heal and you go from there.
</p>
<p>
Jumps in pain is probably nerves, they&#39;re weird like that.

It looks like a healthy wound from my knowledge, the black bits don&#39;t appear to be showing any infection around them so they&#39;re likely some combination of dried blood and dead scar tissue on the outside.  It definitely looks &#34;bad&#34; but that&#39;s what serious surgical wounds look like while healing.
</p>
<p>
As others said check in with your doctor with any specific questions you&#39;re super worried about and they should be able to get back to you if they see anything they&#39;re concerned about.

Looks like your vagina is healing. Placement and everything looks good to me. If youâ€™re worried send some progress pics to your surgeon but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s normal

Add the title says I&#39;m concerned how I&#39;m looking. I know that I&#39;m barely out of surgery but I&#39;m still concerned and could use a second opinion on if it&#39;s looking okay for the current time.

Seems like a shit show, which is to say totally fine for right now. Ask your surgeon though, i think ive sent 3 different pics of my junk to my surgeon so far asking questions. They should be happy to provide reassurances!

Sup GRS on the same day friend? Mine is ok, you have way less swelling than me though! I did zero depth and absolutely could not imagine dilating right now, seems like a fucking nightmare??
</p>
<p>
Unlucky with the cath, mine was gone no problem on day 3
</p>
<p>
Which surgeon? I was with Dr Geolani Dy.

You literally just had surgery. Why are you worried? Youre still healing!

I guess cause I&#39;ve never had surgery before, definitely not a vaginoplasty so I&#39;m not quite sure what to expect..I know things will be a need during healing I just can&#39;t help but worry

I had mine on the 14th. Iâ€™m really active and need to calm down. My problem is that I donâ€™t give it enough time to dry. Iâ€™m looking pretty close to you and they told me not to worry and this it was lol sort itself out. Iâ€™m worried but everyone is telling me not to. I am just going to stick to the schedule.

Yeah, I just got a reply back from my doctor saying the same thing. Basically to make sure to dry out enough bit otherwise things are looking okay which is a relief
