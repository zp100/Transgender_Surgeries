Hi all,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 10 months and I have been using KY Jelly for most of that time. It seems fine, though dilating is uncomfortable and I do have a bleeding problem. It has been suggested to me from multiple sources that KY might be the issue, I could be having a reaction to it with it&#39;s less-than-ideal pH or osmalality. I have been researching lubes but every top ten list says something different and I don&#39;t know who to trust. I&#39;d love to buy 10 different brands and try them all, but I really can&#39;t afford that, so I thought I&#39;d try word of mouth.
</p>
<p>
I tried Slippery Stuff because it was recommended to me as a healthy choice, but I found it was way too runny and left a huge mess to clean up each time I dilated with it. Couldn&#39;t stand that, and switched back to KY, which I find to be more solid. Hilariously, one of the top 10 lists I looked at said &#34;KY Jelly is a great, safe healthy lube but is unfortunately much more runny than Slippery Stuff.&#34; Yeah... sure...
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I talk too much. What lubes have you used that didn&#39;t seem to cause any health issues?
</p>
<p>
(Thanks!!)

I started with surgilube, tried KY, then went back to surgilube. Not really too much to draw off of, but there&#39;s my preference between the two.

This is the stuff that was recommended to me in a Vulva 101 class I took.

<p>
It was also recommended to rotate through other lives occasionally because you can develop sensitivity to the preservatives in them.
</p>
<p>
I do not work for the store I linked to, but they are extremely knowledgeable about all of the products they sell and others they don’t. They have actually have testing done on products so that they can explain the details to the rest of us.

Well, the one I took was at the Smitten Kitten store in Minneapolis. I should talk to them about doing an online version.

Hi, Not that I&#39;m sniffing Surgilube, but I don&#39;t like the smell of it lol. But I shouldn&#39;t complain as my insurance covers the lube.

Hmm, this is interesting that you found Slippery Stuff to be too runny... You wouldn&#39;t happen to be in Australia, would you? Apparently there are actually two lubes called Slippery Stuff: One is a gel made by a company called Wallace O&#39;Farrell and widely available online, the other one is much thinner, made by Wet Stuff and available in Australia. Perhaps that&#39;s where the discrepancy in reviews is coming in?
</p>
<p>
I only bring it up because I&#39;ve
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ckbclt/dilating_lube_recommendations/evnwymh/" rel="nofollow">heard good things
</a>
about a combination of Slippery Stuff Gel plus a little bit of Sliquid Sassy, which is a fantastic lube but kind of expensive. Maybe that combination holds up better?
</p>
<p>
This is making me want to order a bottle of Slippery Stuff Gel to investigate for myself, but I&#39;m still almost a year pre-op so it&#39;s hard to justify buying that much lube at this point...

United States, but thank you! I think I&#39;m going to give Slippery Stuff another shot.

Yeah, curiosity got the better of me so I ordered a small tube of Slippery Stuff Gel on Amazon. I&#39;m interested to see how this turns out myself!

I was the one who made the comment you linked to. ;)

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/9b23Ei7.jpg" rel="nofollow">Slipper Stuff Gel shouldn&#39;t be runny

. OP may have purchased regular Slippery Stuff, which is

much
</em>
thinner. It&#39;s the gel that works best for dilating.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m now over a year post-op, and still swear by Slippery Stuff Gel, both for dilating and sex. I haven&#39;t bothered with Sliquid Sassy in a long time -- I just use the Slippery Stuff Gel by itself.

These days I use Good Clean Love&#39;s BioNude Ultra Sensitive lube most of the time. It lasts a long time, works very well (a little will go a long way), and is pH balanced.
</p>
<p>
I also occassionally use KY True Feel silicone lube. It&#39;s medical grade dimethicone, that&#39;s the only ingredient in it. It&#39;s a bit pricey but if you want a silicone lube that shouldn&#39;t melt your dilators, this will do the job as it is polyurethane safe. Several other silicone lubes use a mix of ingredients that may chemically interact with dilators (Soul Source ones are made of polyurethane) and toys.

I use Slippery Stuff. I’ve had no problems with it. Slippery Stuff is like the consistency of spit. I know that sounds gross, but it works.
</p>
<p>
KY irritates me—a lot, because of the Sorbitol, it causes this constant burning inside with prolonged use. It’s HORRIBLE. I tried BioNude but it instantly feels like it burns my insides as soon as I make contact with it. Astroglide didn’t work at all for me either. I seem to be super sensitive and I’m not entirely sure why. Regardless, I’m going to stick to Slippery Stuff for the duration, it’s pretty much the only thing that works for me.
