Definitely odd to be instructed to wait six weeks for starting dilation. I might ask them directly for explanations of the things you’re telling us about. Was there some sort of medical contraindication or complication that made dilation impossible for a while?

I don&#39;t know many people on this country, but I recall that something like this is standard protocol.  I think they might have said about waiting for all the wounds to heal?  They said they&#39;d tell me when it was okay, but usually at six weeks.

It sounds like there’s a possibility that they are favoring aesthetics over depth. From my understanding, the preference is to favor depth over aesthetics. Aesthetics can be revised easier later down the line, but depth requires more invasive surgery if you want to get a revision. The depth and vaginal diameter sounds like the surgery for someone who had a “botched” operation (though your aesthetics look way better) link here:

I told them I cared nothing for aesthetics and only cared about depth, but due to language issues they may have misunderstood me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just learning to accept there&#39;s no hope, and thinking who to donate the unopened soul source dilators to.
</p>
<p>
(I opened the Vagiwell and used the two small ones, so can&#39;t donate those).

I&#39;m sad, but I have no choice but to accept that dating and romance are off the table.
</p>
<p>
I am actively blaming myself for doing what the doctor told me to do (well, I used the finger size dilator at 3.5 weeks.  But what if they had been right and I had damaged the canal?  Both choices could have equally led to disaster.

You shouldn’t think like that, you can still find love even if you don’t have a canal , I have depth but I am unhappy with my results because of other complications and I know exactly how are you feeling, we just have to remember that our private areas don’t get involved in our normal day to day life, so that’s something positive to look at .

I&#39;m sorry that you also had things go wrong and I hope things can be made right.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been hurt by parents and my only two romantic partners.  It would be hard to trust anyway, but having zero depth? No man wants that.  Maybe it&#39;s mercy that I now won&#39;t even risk being hurt?

You can still fix this, there is still hope for a sex life that is good. How is your clitoris and clitoral orgasms? Are you able to have them?

I&#39;m not a lesbian, so clitoris is irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
Anyway it just hurts all the time.  I am not sure where it is only that it&#39;s in constant pain.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m at four weeks now, so maybe that&#39;s normal?
</p>
<p>
But yeah, no guy wants a partner with no vagina, but has a clitoris... That provides the guy with nothing.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately,my depression over my results both means that I stopped eating and that I lost interest in men

they work for both, width = depth, its the same tissue being stretched, if you read the post in the link you will see what i mean
</p>
<p>
also the pump in the link is not the same as a foley baloon, the pump in the link expands in all directions, while the foley baloon only expands sideways, use the one in the link, not a foley baloon

I tried first time at 3.5 weeks.  I might have tried earlier, but in the recovery city I had only the soul source dilators.  I was afraid to go against the doctor and use them as they&#39;re big. So if anything was bad in my healing, they&#39;d blame me.
</p>
<p>
(After the first time I dilated also the next two days including today with identical results.)
</p>
<p>
(They can&#39;t blame me about the one I used at home cos it&#39;s thinner than my finger)
</p>
<p>
Culture in this country is people can&#39;t ask doctor anything... You just accept whatever happens.  In any case, of it&#39;s sealed shit at 4cm, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything that can be done, is there?

You should be dilating within the first 10 days post op . 6 weeks is not viable for any depth . I would speak to your program and request a revision if you can ,

This is very odd. PI even if hybrid needs a stent and then rigorous dilation routine started pretty imminently. I was under the impression that once they took out the stent you’d start dilating? I’ve just had SRS and my technique is different but I will only start dilating once my catheter is removed at end of week 2. It won’t be good to compare to other techniques because they will be different but what did the dr say before? Did he give you much information about post op care would entail?

Cos of language difference they don&#39;t say much.  They were emphatic about the no dilation thing.  I only did what I did cos the smallest Vagifem dilator was smaller diameter than my finger, and I was allowed to use finger to apply oil.
</p>
<p>
What I don&#39;t know is if they even made a canal to begin with.  But if they did, it&#39;s firmly closed.. but firm enough that I don&#39;t think it was ever more than 5cm.
</p>
<p>
But if there was a canal, was firmly gone at 3.5 weeks.
</p>
<p>
Idk if there&#39;s anything they can do about it.  They have weekly appointments with me, so I&#39;ll be there Friday but I don&#39;t really even want to go.  Can&#39;t handle bad news

Who was your surgeon? So when you enquired you couldn’t find much information because of the language difference? It is possible that there could have been miscommunication about what you want and what they can give. They should have translated it to your language so that you would fully understand the risks and what is involved because vaginoplasties to differ in risk and procedure as you probably know. If you aren’t able to use the canal and you want to it’s probably possible for a revision to use a part of either peritoneal, jejunum or colon for the canal. Wouldn’t advise going to the same place if there is that language barrier.

It&#39;s national health care. It&#39;s not like in other countries.  The doctors don&#39;t have webpages and aren&#39;t listed where you can see who works at which clinic.  You go to consult and meet one doctor but a different one might do the surgery.  I didn&#39;t meet mine until right before surgery.  After surgery was different doctor and didn&#39;t see mine until 2.5 weeks after when she cut me to drain the hemotomas (which didn&#39;t drain anyway).
</p>
<p>
Doctors here are like 1960s USA... Hard to explain what I mean.
</p>
<p>
The doctors and some nurses speak English, but that can just as well lead to miscommunication.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll try ask more at Friday appointment...

I’m not a doctor but waiting six weeks before you started dilating could be the reason that you barely have any depth.

I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had to go through this. This is totally unacceptable. Even if you originally had a normal amount of depth, not dilating for weeks would have caused you to lose it. Let alone 6 weeks.
</p>
<p>
I did my first dilation session within minutes after they originally removed the packing and dilated a total of five times that day per the instructions. Your canal would have closed up rapidly with no dilation at all. You should have been dilating four times per day with the soul source dilators this entire time. I&#39;m so sorry.
</p>
<p>
You may be able to recover some depth and width if you start as soon as possible but the problem is that now even the smallest soul source might be difficult to initially insert since you have not dilated this entire time. Soul source does have a couple petite sizes that you can try ordering directly from them which are thinner.

I&#39;m using the thinnest Vagiwell, which is no wider than a finger.
</p>
<p>
Unless I&#39;m doing something wrong with the aiming, there&#39;s just no place to go.
</p>
<p>
I was in hospital for six days after the packing was out.  And told no dilation.  I expected to leave the hospital the same day as packing removal so didn&#39;t bring them with.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, today I tried the number 2 Vagiwell and wasn&#39;t a good  idea.  Starting at 3.5 weeks does seem like there&#39;s already nothing left.

National health care.
</p>
<p>
No one outside the country can book here so it&#39;s irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the surgery may have been fine.  It was the aftercare by a different doctor that could have been the problem.  And idk that person name.

Since you cannot pick what surgeon does your surgery, there&#39;s no point.  Also the surgery might have been fine.  Anyway it was a different doctor who told me about their dilation rules, and I don&#39;t know that doctors name

I didnt dilate until about week 3, but, I had the jejunum technique so that’s a different situation. In your case I think you definitely should have started dilating

It&#39;s very possible that you lost that much depth because they didn&#39;t allow you to dilate. 6 weeks is a lot. The only explanation of why could they told you not to dilate that I can think of is that you had some kind of complications during the surgery. There could be a some damage to tissues, so dilation could cause a fistula, so they told you not to dilate. They have to explain you exactly what happened tho

They told me 6 weeks, but I was allowed to use my finger to clean inside.  So even I hit home at 3.5 weeks, I used that 12mm diameter, 11 cm long finger sized dilator to try to put in the wound gel properly inside the vagina.  That is when I discovered that there was no canal.
</p>
<p>
(I hadn&#39;t been able to insert the silver sheets into the canal without it bunching up, so I should have already suspected something was wrong)

Doctors are accountable for their actions as their entire career is assumed to be geared and motivated by caring for people and not lying, misleading and generally harming them - which is why they have insurance plans to cover their actions should a mistake happen.
</p>
<p>
If they made a mistake then they will be responsible to remedy that to a level deemed equal to the damage done.
</p>
<p>
I recommend asking them to do a dilation for you and find out whether or not you are doing something wrong or perhaps there was a complication to explain your current hypothesis...
</p>
<p>
If you still don&#39;t believe them, I recommend getting an ultrasound and access to your patient portal at the medical center that provides the ultrasound and simply use that to sue them.

There isn&#39;t a tunnel...
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s national health care.  No one picks their doctor; you&#39;re assigned one and you can&#39;t request a particular doctor.  And almost no one here posts results, so really no info available.  The only picture I found was from a doctor who since moved to another country.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll ask on Friday, but doctors here aren&#39;t so chatty.  Their response may or may not be useful.
</p>
<p>
I do have some white in the canal and have to use wound gel x to clear away necrosis.  But they told me not to dilate prior to there being visible necrosis.

I understand your frustration. And I apologise for my ignorance about the Healthcare  system where you live - I must have just assumed that one can choose to go to the surgeon they want if it is feasible... I really hope you can get the answer you want when you see that particular surgeon again.  if not and you can&#39;t trust the original surgeon again i hope you can get the financial resources to go to another surgeon, I know that many surgeons that do revisions will do free consultations.

You can always get revision from others especially Thailand. Quite cheap and the best care for transwomen. Don&#39;t give up, and stay calm. Some women are born with closed vaginas, odd fact I kniw but that&#39;s why these procedures exist. So just stay calm and do the best you can with them and remeber you always have options and obviously a community that will help.

I have no way to raise money for something like that.  I only got the surgery because it was free in my country.

Heey. I had to wait weeks before starting dilation and my depth wasn&#39;t whole lot better than Yours.
</p>
<p>
It takes 3 to 6 weeks for everything to heal enough. It&#39;s not gonna be a problem if You start dialating at six weeks. Dilating sooner could cause complications.
</p>
<p>
The depth will improve. Start with the smallest one. This is difficult, as You may feel desperate, because You don&#39;t see improvement well and feel unsure if You&#39;re getting better.
</p>
<p>
But You&#39;re in a way stretching everything. It may take week to see any result. It will take time, but dilation will get You depth and width with time.

Only helpful response.
</p>
<p>
Problem is that with so little depth, I have zero confidence I even know what direction to try.  Could be the 4mm isn&#39;t even right direction.  I was trying to open wider to get the wound care x a bit deeper inside, which created some uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Every day the last four I do try as part of the cleaning process.. just hard when I feel that hard stop in every direction even though the dilator is thinner than my girly fingers.

It is difficult, and since I can not know Your case I can&#39;t be sure how things actually are in your case.
</p>
<p>
I reccomend going to Your healthcare team where You were operated or getting a seccond oppinion.
</p>
<p>
In my case there was at start very little depth and I do remember that I wasn&#39;t sure am I trying to the right direction.  It was difficult and there was a lot of uncertanty I felt, but few hours a day, day after day, little by little, things progressed.
</p>
<p>
I could share photo or video that demonstrates how my depth was at the start for comparison, but I can&#39;t post media in a comment on reddit.
</p>
<p>
Do You mean actually 4mm or 4cm? I think I had at start like 4cm.

Yes, 4cm.  I tried all directions and nothing.  I don&#39;t want to damage anything or stretch in wrong direction...
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t anymore trust the team, but I have appointment in next couple days, so I&#39;ll try to ask.
</p>
<p>
I want to hope, but I&#39;ve always considered hope as a most dangerous enemy.

Ha! Dammed hope! I share Your feelings towards hope!
</p>
<p>
Hey, I could show You video as prove, mine had 4cm depth at start too.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t worry, dilation won&#39;t damage as long as You&#39;ve healed to the point You can start to dilate.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure, but I think in the end it wont matter, there is only certain cavity Your vagina will take place in. You don&#39;t have to have exact right direction. It will strech in the end evenly to fill the cavity there is.
</p>
<p>
Have You been instructed how to dilate?
</p>
<p>
Aproximately right direction toward middle, it gets easier to direct after You&#39;ve made progress. I wasn&#39;t sure of the direction myself at first.
</p>
<p>
I think at the start, there was suppose to be circling/twirling motion that has the tip point at different directions a bit.  This helps dilate the bottom of the vagina. Bottom of the vagina will then dilate/strech more, more evenly and toward the direction where it is meant to grow into.
</p>
<p>
I know the start is so insecure and unconfident, but it will get easier. Just gotta keep at it day by day. I had the same issue.

I don&#39;t need video or pictures; I believe you.  I just feel based on my own self exploration that it&#39;s healed shut.
</p>
<p>
I did look for info online about dilation... The how to with pencil drawings that I bookmarked two years ago is a dead link, unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
I was told I must not dilate and given no instructions.  But my discharge paper said I could use my finger to clean inside, which is how I justified to myself using the finger size dilator.
</p>
<p>
(I read one person on Finland say they were given a device and instructions on day 6 after surgery... Idk if they changed protocols or why it was different for me.
</p>
<p>
I also had some tearing on the bottom of the vaginal opening the third day I tried to dilate. That scared me off a bit.
</p>
<p>
Everyone else in comments said it was now too late and mocked me for following doctor advice, so is part why I don&#39;t dare hope...

Those who would mock are idiots. Look if You can get that 4 cm in, that is a start and it wil dilate/strech from there, You just gotta keep at it!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m from Finland and I had my surgery on the public sector here. I was in hospital for 10 days. I had a catheter in my urethra for 2  weeks from surgery. I don&#39;t think I was even out of bed really on the 6th day.
</p>
<p>
I really don&#39;t think I started dilating before 4th week. Might have been later.
</p>
<p>
Finger size is a start. It seems like it has closed and there is no depth, but it will expand.
</p>
<p>
Where did You have Your surgery? You spoke of Finland?

It was in Finland, yes.
</p>
<p>
Kinda scared also cos of the cuts? that make so I can&#39;t use the pillupuhelin or shower head to rinse out the vagina.
</p>
<p>
Also today that same sensitive area made so I couldn&#39;t even insert the dilator.  Feel sad. What&#39;s worst is I can&#39;t even see what cut or wound is the problem so I could cover it or treat it.

OMG! You had the surgery in HUS Puistosairaala aswell! Sinikka ja Jenni? I had my surgery there 19.09.2023.
</p>
<p>
Same surgeons? Same technique? Same recovery? Same aftercare and dilation practise?
</p>
<p>
My quess is Your surgery and recovery is pretty much more or less the same as mine. I turned out fine, You&#39;re going to be fine. You go through same path I did a year ago!
</p>
<p>
Yeah they could be bit more attentive with the part where they are there for You post surgery. Kinda cold and distant, but such is Finnish healthcare.

I understand that one or both of them work in Sweden now.  For privacy reasons (and since no one can contract to have surgery here) I never give names.
<em>
If
</em>
things turn out okay eventually and I have the doctor&#39;s permission then I&#39;d write who it was.
</p>
<p>
They apparently decided there wasn&#39;t enough penile tissue, so used the inverted tunica vaginicis for the inside of the vagina.  My understanding is that isn&#39;t their normal technique, but in Maisa that&#39;s what was written.
</p>
<p>
And yes, same hospital.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve read others say they dilated before leaving hospital and we&#39;re given a dilator from Puistosairaala. So the dilation ban seems to be unusual but not unique.
</p>
<p>
I have train foru followup tomorrow.  I&#39;ve had once or twice s week appointments since surgery.  Given my increased pain pm the right labia (getting up is hard again) and pain that prevents cleaning, I probably am stuck with weekly meetings for a while  And I expect the one on Friday to hurt a lot...

It takes 3 weeks in general for wounds to heal.  You&#39;re not supposed to sit for 6 weeks as the stress to the area can cause serious complications to the area.
</p>
<p>
I have seen horror photo in this subreddit from a fellow trans person who sat too soon after surgery. Needed a revision surgery due to the complication that appeared to have come from having sat.
</p>
<p>
If sitting can cause complication due to pressure to the area, how about pressing a dilator to strech the area wider and deeper?
</p>
<p>
3 weeks atleast for wounds to heal. Preferable to be checked by someone to see how the healing process has gone.

This is dangerous, untrue advice that could lead to people losing their depth due to not dilating as they should. All of it. Take a harder look at this sub and talk to some more people, you&#39;re very misinformed. Dilation doesn&#39;t cause complications. Not following the dilation schedule does.

I had no schedule other than when doctors thought it was right time to start dilating. It was several weeks after surgery. Can&#39;t remember, but I think 4 - 6 weeks after surgery.

The paper they gave me was three weeks for sitting, but even with that special cushion they gifted me I won&#39;t sit any longer than I have to (I eat quickly so I can avoid sitting).  And I was leary about taking a train home at 3.5 weeks, but they toldr it was safe.
</p>
<p>
Paper also said sex at six weeks, but even if I had a canal, there&#39;s just no way on earth.  I have too much pain to believe that I&#39;d be willing two weeks from now.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m having more trouble with cleaning cos of a wound that makes it too painful to rinse inside with the pillupuhelin.  (I had been using that to flush out the canal... I hate that I can&#39;t anymore do that without really bad pain 😭

Pillupuhelin? You mean bidee?
</p>
<p>
I used first small, then bigger cotton ball sticks. I used the skin oil ceraderm for liquid. I&#39;d swap until all blood, yellow liquid, brown dead blood would be gone.  I&#39;d use gentle genitalia soap and at times those cotton ball sticks in the shower too.
</p>
<p>
Because of slow healing, I had to use silver tampon to help wounds heal.

I was given the silver for about eight days.  Then silicone.  But I can&#39;t get anything inside anymore.
</p>
<p>
And the spray nozzle from the sink. But I have some cut or wound so last two days cannot use.
</p>
<p>
I also need something to put under me so I can pour the pure water for cleaning since the spray hurts.  Pharmacy really doesn&#39;t have much anything that I need though (Pori)

Actually, it&#39;s the first option a doctor will recommend for
<em>
vaginal agenesis
</em>
; when a female is born without a vagina. And you have much more than a dimple!
</p>
<p>
I might consider starting with a four or five inch silicone dildo... And literally wear it as much as you can all day everyday. Bet you&#39;ll find that your tissues will stretch and grow inwards... And you can achieve the depth and the width that you want.
</p>
<p>
Or, of course, you can have revision surgery. But I suspect - ok, I hope - you will find excellent results the other way. It will take about 5 to 6 months of consistent working at it.

I&#39;ve prodded in every direction of my wound.  The dilator on the picture is 12mm diameter and 11cm max length.  It is smaller than a woman&#39;s pinky finger.
</p>
<p>
I get 4-5 cm Max depth sometimes. Usually 2-3cm
</p>
<p>
When I try to push more it&#39;s clear that I&#39;m pushing against hard tissue... Like there never was a canal to begin with.  There&#39;s literally nowhere for the tiny dilator to go.  Today I was too depressed to try.  I just opened the labia and put the wound care cream in without trying to push it deeper as there is no deeper.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t see the packing when they took it out ... No idea if there was much any packing to begin with.
</p>
<p>
They don&#39;t do revisions for depth, and have no money, so I&#39;m done.

I don&#39;t care about external aesthetics... I had told them that... Only care depth.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m demi and haven&#39;t had a partner in five years, so no real reason to anticipate sex in the next year (I take things slow when I do meet someone), but knowing there&#39;s no canal?  Obviously I have to be hostile to all guys to make sure no one likes me... Cos there&#39;s nothing I can do for them.  So I can&#39;t be myself.
</p>
<p>
I also don&#39;t feel like a real woman.
</p>
<p>
I could tuck to invisible, and wearing swimsuits just pushing back no one could notice anything, so the operation doesn&#39;t change much, really?  I did feel a lot of peace the first three weeks, but that evaporated once I found out there was no canal.

Very-self destructive mindset ”Obviously I have to be hostile to all guys to make sure no one likes me... Cos there’s nothing I can do for them.  So I can’t be myself.” but hey you do you 🤷🏼‍♀️

If I were you, I might look in Wikipedia about that procedure. I know from personal experience that it does work - but, of course, if you believe it won&#39;t, or can&#39;t - you&#39;re right.

I have no money to pursue anything.  Even if the national health care would fund a PPT revision (they don&#39;t), how could I trust them?  The surgery wasn&#39;t done right, the aftercare was bad, they gave almost no instructions to me, and much of what they did say was wrong.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m demi/demi so rarely think of sex or romance, when I&#39;m awake I can stop it.  But I&#39;ve woke up with intense pain from dreams.. two nights ago it was just kissing, but that was enough to trigger the unremoved erectile tissue to wake me in intense pain.  Took 30 minutes for it to stop hurting.
</p>
<p>
So even if they offered a revision (they won&#39;t), I&#39;d be a fool to trust them again.
