I&#39;ve spent the last few weeks reading every story from GRS that I could find, so I thought I&#39;d add mine to the pile. Honestly, I&#39;m just hoping keeping a diary will help keep me sane through all this, though maybe sharing here can help out some people too. I&#39;m also not going to promise I&#39;ll keep this up but we&#39;ll see.
</p>
<p>
So, it&#39;s Sunday evening and in roughly 36 hours I&#39;ll be on the operating table. It&#39;s really something when you say it like that. SRS was just a hypothetical point in the future and then suddenly you&#39;re on a flight to Montreal. I hear tomorrow is the day when all the feelings hit, we&#39;ll see if that holds true I guess.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, today went almost perfectly. Flying sucks, and I&#39;m honestly scared for how my return&#39;s going to be. The handle on my suitcase broke, that&#39;s annoying. We got driven to the Holiday Inn by an older Italian gentleman weaving through traffic like crazy. Saw a suspicious number of tall women and dyed hair at the hotel but was too awkward to say hi. Ordered takeout with the food voucher they gave us, but the restaurant forgot cutlery so I ate chicken and rice with my bare hands. (TMI) My wife wanted to have sex one last time but she&#39;s now passed out because we were up since 4am. I guess I&#39;ll probably follow soon.
</p>
<p>
Well, that&#39;s all I got. If anyone&#39;s still reading, I&#39;ll be back tomorrow (probably on my own profile so I&#39;m not spamming). Otherwise I&#39;ll just keep yelling into the void, trying not to implode.

I for one will be interested.  I am done all the paperwork and provided all the info they needed.  Just waiting to hear from scheduling for a date.

Im in the same boat, have they been slow replying to you during the paperwork process? Apparently they haven’t received the stuff from my doc and pharmacy yet but at the same time I feel like they’re somewhat overwhelmed and slow in receiving all the paperwork.

Personally, I found them to handle paperwork about as well as any other medical office: not perfect but trying their best. I know that&#39;s not ideal for something as serious as SRS. Just advocate for yourself and be willing to chase things down if necessary

Yeah that’s fair, I’ll keep that in mind if they seem to still be falling short on getting stuff from my doc or pharmacy. Compared to my other experiences with medical offices they’ve been a bit slower, but likely have a lot more traffic at the same time, so I definitely don’t blame them. Thanks!

I went and collected everything myself and then submitted so I never really noticed an issue with them being slow to respond.  Could be one of those provincial differences.  I am in Manitoba and was very happy with the processing time in Montreal and getting to this point.
