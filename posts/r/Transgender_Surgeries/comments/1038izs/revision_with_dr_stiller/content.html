I am considering Dr. Stiller for similar minor, but important revision. Did insurance cover these revisions? If not, can you ballpark costs? I an especially interested in the urethra being made smaller. Mine is very large and I think it is why Iâ€™ve struggled with UTIâ€™s post op. Any info is appreciated greatly!

Insurance did cover it, yes. All of the revisions we covered. His office seems to be great at making that happen. It can be hard to get a surgery date though. I feel lucky I got the fat grating done. Iâ€™m grateful I got the surgery at all but I would definitely have gone to him to begin with.

You must have private / employment insurance ? This state insurance is a hot mess for me. â€¦  Canâ€™t wait for my revision in March. Seem like we have the same issue with the arousal issue. Hope this is your last revision ðŸ¤—

No, I have Medicare. Theyâ€™ve been great at covering SRS stuff but forget it when it comes to FFS even though some doctors do take them. Itâ€™s an uphill battle for that. Iâ€™m trying to get on my boyfriendâ€™s Cigna so I can get that stuff covered. Frankly I feel very lucky I was able to get the labia fat grafting covered via Medicare but Dr. Stillerâ€™s office has been amazing at handling that.

So rude of me, I didnâ€™t even mention your results. I am glad to hear you found the right surgeon and team to correct your problem areas and get relief. This surgery is life changing, but sometimes it needs a little tweaking.

Just an update. Had a ton of bruising from the lipo and the fat grafting. Even so, things are looking a ton better and itâ€™s obvious he got most of the leftover erectile tissue. It looks like he did a labiaplasty and really improved the look a lot. Even with the swelling my urine stream is better. For the first time since my first surgery it feels like my original material is really and truly gone; heâ€™s much more aggressive at removing the corpora cavernosa than my first surgeon. I have to wear a compression garment part of the day but itâ€™s not too bad. Really pleased. I canâ€™t say enough nice things about the hospital or anesthesia team or nursing staff.
