If you are happy with the results, was the staff nice, were you treated good, maybe your opinion about his work and your experience please. But please share only things you&#39;re comfortable with ðŸ˜‹â˜º. Many thanks!

1) Yep, Iâ€™m happy with the results
</p>
<p>
2) The staff were nice, but Dr. Mayer I had mixed experiences withâ€” my first consult was a little bit rough but everything after he was very lovely.
</p>
<p>
3) The staff had a new hire which gave me some advice which contradicted my outpatient instructions and lead to some annoyances, so Iâ€™d advise having someone with you who is able to think clearly post-op (because youâ€™ll be high af)
</p>
<p>
4) I think he did a great job, Iâ€™m about 2 years post op now and havenâ€™t had any problems since. Iâ€™m considering going for a second phase to fix my hairline a bit more.
</p>
<p>
I have had better post op care from a surgeonâ€™s office since, but I wouldnâ€™t say Dr. Mayerâ€™s office was bad.
</p>
<p>
Edit: here are roughly the costs back then:

Great! What do you mean &#34;high af&#34; - like doped with medicine? For how long? :)  Many thanks for your help!

Yeah, if youâ€™re like me youâ€™ll be on pain meds for at least a few daysâ€” apparently some people get by with just Tylenol but I was in a lot of pain. I believe I reduced my dosage of the opiate painkiller by day 3 and was off by the end of the week.
</p>
<p>
If you do need them, itâ€™s vitally important to have a schedule and stick to it (including during the night).
</p>
<p>
I had BA last year which was much less painful because of thisâ€” you donâ€™t take the pain meds in response to pain, because by then itâ€™s too late. You have to ensure the pain is managed throughout and stick to the dosing schedule until it is no longer needed

And why do I need someone with me? While on pain killers you cannot think? I am asking because I was never on opiate as pain relief treatment and I don&#39;t know what it feels like.

Oh, yeah youâ€™ll be drowsy + unable to drive. The first day was pretty much a blur to me. You can hire a nurse to stay with you which Iâ€™d recommend.
