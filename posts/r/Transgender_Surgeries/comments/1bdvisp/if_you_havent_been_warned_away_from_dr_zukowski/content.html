Hi. Some moths ago I posted my bad experience with Dr. Zukowski in Chicago. I was threatened with being sued, and around the 19th of this year I was officially served with papers.
</p>
<p>
Since I made minor mistakes in my post (the Amount was over $300 and it was 3 weeks, not a month), I decided to remove them due to the errors.
</p>
<p>
THE LAWSUIT AGAINST ME IS STILL GOING ON. Unless I sign something which more or less means I&#39;m not allowed to talk to anyone ever again about him or his office, the lawsuit is not being dropped. I have been forced to represent myself, and I&#39;m very close to killing myself because I can&#39;t take the stress. THIS IS HOW HE TREATS HIS (FORMER) PATIENTS. I can&#39;t afford a lawyer because all the money my family could get was wasted on surgery with him. All the lawyers I&#39;ve talked to are demanding money we dont have. This includes all of the agencies that are supposed to help LGBT people.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve file a motion to dismiss, which was stricken from the Record (Deleted, so I dont think anyone will ever be able to read it again)
</p>
<p>
For those looking up the case, the number is  20242000231
</p>
<p>
You can look it up here:

<a href="https://casesearch.cookcountyclerkofcourt.org/CivilCaseSearchAPI.aspx">https://casesearch.cookcountyclerkofcourt.org/CivilCaseSearchAPI.aspx
</a>
</p>
<p>
(Its under Civil cases)
</p>
<p>
Legal Aid will not help me because they don&#39;t handle this type of case.
</p>
<p>
PLEASE, DO NOT GIVE ANY MORE MONEY TO THIS MONSTER. Its possbile he;s going to use it to pay his lawyer who filed the suit on me FOR TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HE DID.
</p>
<p>
Since I feel I&#39;m nearing the end of my life, I have nothing to lose by posting the wayback machines links (And the OG link)

I have tried, but Since I&#39;m not from IL, I&#39;m not eligable. Legal aid will not work on civil cases where I am from (Connecticut) (Yes, I tried to argue juristiction, but that was part of the motion that was struck by the judge.

Just delete your claims. Get rid of the claim. Other people will have them archived. Once it&#39;s out there, you can never really take it back, so just you do what&#39;s best for you.

I am so sorry to hear that you are having to go through all of this.  Sadly, many doctors (surgeons especially) are under the delusion that they are infallible and that it is impossible for them to make mistakes.
</p>
<p>
Now, I am not a lawyer - but, since he has chosen to file this suit (and ask for a jury trial vs. a bench trial - which *could* be advantageous for you), any and all documents related to the procedure, including the medical/surgical records and information on any implants used, will need to be provided by him as part of discovery.  He can&#39;t charge you for this, since those documents are the basis of his claims that your posts are damaging.  You will need to file discovery requests seeking all information you believe is relevant with the court - pre and post op reports, intraoperative reports, all implant manufacturer information, pre and post operative xrays or mri scans, nursing notes, office visits... all of it.  Given the time set for trial, this will need to be done soon.
</p>
<p>
Keep looking for legal representation as well - because you can bet his attorney will be well versed in ways to trip you up during testimony, and that is difficult to prepare for without experience.  This is going to be crucial, because free online legal advice is not going to be enough.
</p>
<p>
I base my suggestions on my experience going through a really messy divorce, and my observation of the process.  Not 100% applicable here, but there is overlap.  Again, I am no attorney, so please take this for what it is - suggestion on directions to go next.
</p>
<p>
I truly hope this all works out in the end.  üíúüíú

That would depend on the skill of both the paralegal and OP.  Like I said, the doctor&#39;s attorney is going to be very skilled in tripping up witnesses to mis-state something or  to admit facts not in evidence (if it wasn&#39;t part of discovery, and wasn&#39;t brought up by a different witness or the judge, you don&#39;t need to divulge information being sought by the prosecuting attorney - and a good lawyer would know when to object and terminate a specific line of questioning).  They want to be sure they are ready for this, and are prepared to counter.

A very good lawyer, once told me that having a a bad lawyer is worse than pro se defense. Op does not sound like they will be able to get a  good lawyer. Therefore they are better off representing themselves.
</p>
<p>
Anytime the plaintiff  lawyer gets tricky they can ask the judge to help explain

Thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but If I could find a way to get public exposure it might help more. I&#39;ve tried every journalistic outlet i can, reasonably (Including VICE), but I have not gotten replies.

Sadly, I&#39;m pretty sure they are another one of those &#34;advocates&#34; that only take cases if they think they can make a name for themselves. All while soliciting donations. I&#39;ve tried them before, on an ACTUAL discrimination case, but they op-ed out.

From personal experience, TLDEF is utterly useless in situations like this. I&#39;m not convinced they&#39;re actually useful at all. I&#39;m not impressed.

Thanks for being brave enough to share!
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re broke, and all he can do is sue for money damages, you don&#39;t really have much to lose...
</p>
<p>
Depends on what state you&#39;re in what people can collect. Where I live they can&#39;t touch anything in a retirement account, can&#39;t touch your house, your car, furniture, jewelry...
</p>
<p>
For your wages to be garnished you have to take home, after taxes, about $800 every week and a creditor can only garnish 15% of whatever you take home in excess of the $800/week. And it takes like 6 months to setup, often once a creditor gets it setup the debtor just switches jobs and they have to begin the process all over again.
</p>
<p>
Downside is a judgment where I&#39;m from is good for 20 years, and intentional torts like defamation cannot be discharged in a bankruptcy. So if you start doing well 15 years from now, he can look you up and try to come collect...
</p>
<p>
If you refuse to settle, show up at all the hearings, ask for a jury trial, ask the court to order him to turn over your medical records as part of discovery, ask for any late requests/out of order requests by you to be excused because you&#39;re not represented, refuse to waive any procedural rights with the court and just make him prove his case, he&#39;d have to pay his lawyers thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars just to maybe get a judgment against you he can&#39;t collect on.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s probably just hoping you&#39;ll give in and settle and shut up.
</p>
<p>
Without an attorney the best thing you could do is just make sure you show up to all the hearings so you don&#39;t default. If you don&#39;t understand something, tell the judge and ask them to explain it to you. I bet you&#39;d have a good shot at the judge throwing this out when it reaches the fact-finding point where the judge actually reads your post and considers whether or not is it defamatory, because your post is mostly-accurate, truthful, and not even inflammatory or put out like you were trying to ruin him, it was a post on a message board not a full page ad in the NY Times...

Ask for a jury trial. You have to ask for one, but once you do, you have a right to it. If you don&#39;t ask, the right is waived at some point in the proceedings. A jury trial just makes things way more complicated and expensive for him.
</p>
<p>
You could also turn it around on him and tell him if HE gives YOU $5k you&#39;ll take the post down and not speak about it again. Otherwise, you want a trial. That way he gets the post removed, you get some money for your headache from this suit, and he ends up paying you less than he would&#39;ve paid his lawyers. Plus, if his lawyers lose their case, which they may, since the truth is on your side, the post remains up and he&#39;s out all his money. If he pays you and you agree to take it down, goal achieved.
</p>
<p>
Unless, out of principal you want to refuse to take it down even for money, I totally respect that. Might consider making the settlement offer anyway, just to make him mad.

He did my BA many years ago. Back then he was one of a small handful of plastic surgeons with trans patients. He was always creepy AF. Sexist pig is an understatement. I never really liked him. But like I said, there just weren&#39;t many options back then. I honestly thought he was retired at this point.

Ask for a paralegal to help you
</p>
<p>
There is an advantage to &#34;pro se&#34; (i.e. representing yourself.)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_se_legal_representation_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_se_legal_representation_in_the_United_States
</a>
Courts give pro se cases greater leeway. If you are represented by a lawyer, the expectation is that the lawyer is perfect. So if the lawyer is not a good lawyer then you are screwed. If their filing is not perfect you are screwed. Whereas pro se representation, the judge is more likely to interpret your filing in the best possible light ESPECIALLY since you are the defendant.

Please get personal injury and defamation advice immediately. There should be a personal injury lawyer who will see you for free (not sure about defamation).

I&#39;m sorry your surgery didn&#39;t go well, but a lot of surgeries don&#39;t go well - always get legal advice.

Once a court gets involved then whoever has more money will win. The situation with the lawsuit isn‚Äôt a reflection of you. The law is very technical, and often the law does not reflect morality or reason. Laws were made by people and are riddled with errors and foolishness and the biases of past historical eras. Them getting wins in court means nothing other than that their lawyer knows all the tricks and techniques of how court laws function. The first principle of American court law is that it is an ‚Äúadversarial system‚Äù or a dyael of sorts, some grand competition, it is a very violent institution. Bowing out of a boxing match is nothing to be ashamed of, if you just explain that you are a peacemaker not a fighter, you aren‚Äôt violent and didn‚Äôt know the brutality of this system.

I

recommend you ask the judge to grant you a Motion to Pseudonymize so your personal information doesn&#39;t end up on any shitty transphobic troll sites. In essence, you have been doxxed by your doctor because civil lawsuits are public information.

No. Someone must fight. If everyone gives in, monsters like him win. I will see this to the end. Even if I lose, he will have a case on record as suing his patients.
