The surgery itself went fine, and everything healed up properly. Resonance is significantly improved. However pitch is only a tad higher despite my vocal cords being about 40% their original length
</p>
<p>
Had a laser revision earlier this month to further tighten the vocal cords and hopefully get my pitch more into a feminine range. Hopefully one treatment is enough, but it can be repeated several times
</p>
<p>
My voice is still weak from said laser revision and hasn&#39;t healed yet so I&#39;ll make another post once it is

Thank you for posting this and keeping us updated. I hope your pitch is raised with the new treatment. I am getting this surgery with Dr Thomas this spring. I was wondering how long did you have to stay in the area after surgery? How long before you felt comfortable to return to work? Also, I know your pitch was only raised by a few semitones but was it worth it still?

So far I&#39;ve only gone up 1 note when the usual is 5. I live in the area, and stayed at home the entire time, but he usually wants people to be there a full week. My work requires a fair bit of talking so I had to wait quite a while before I could return. But I felt physically fine enough to return within a few days

They can do CO2, but it&#39;s more of a hassle, and I&#39;d like to avoid more general anesthesia if I can. Learned I don&#39;t tolerate it well

I&#39;m surprised I didn&#39;t realize it went only went up 1 note. Was it still worth getting the surgery? Also did you have to wait a few weeks or like a month before returning? I too am required to talk a lot for work and am just trying to plan accordingly.

If there was no option of revision I would say it wasn&#39;t worth it. But would say it has been worth it so far with revisions being a thing. Quick before and after. 1 weeks before surgery, and 3 months after

Wow that does sound like 1 note up. It has only been 3 months though. Hopefully with more healing time and vocal lessons the pitch will continue to get better. Plus with the revision it should sound really nice.

I&#39;ve never been able to do voice training. Even saw an actual speech therapist for a while. It&#39;s just not something I can do and is why I got the surgery

What were the cots involved in this? If you don&#39;t mind me asking. I am weighing my options between this and professional lessons.

$15,550 not including travel and lodging if you don&#39;t live in the area. I would always recommend voice training, and professional lessons before surgery. This was sort of a last resort for me after spending multiple years trying to do any amount of training

Hi! Thank you so much for posting! May ask, how is the swelling? Does it feel as though it restricts breathing or swallowing significantly?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got some sensory issues that were the hardest part of FFS, and that scares me as much as anything

There was a lump in my throat feeling at first with a bit of pain swallowing. But it was entirely gone within 3 or 4 days
