It is hard to believe what u say, 3 weeks on after the op it is all fresh bleeding hole, not a such fantastic thing u paint. Vanessa actually was named one of the worst agents but Italian community. After reading this text I say you are a paid scammer using fake account. You are intentionally misleading people which is very low. I know of 5 people who had PPV there adding myself to this list and from experience I say it is total BS you have written in there.

Not everyone having had a good experience at kamols,  is a payed scammer.  You disqualify yourself for invalidating their account.

I&#39;m sorry to hear you had a terrible experience there. As I&#39;ve adressed in my review, some people have been disappointed in their results. When I booked for my surgery, I knew there was a 50% chance I would get botched. But there was no one else, and I couldn&#39;t tolerate waiting any longer.
</p>
<p>
As for Vanessa, I am also sorry that you have had a bad experience with her. I am not denying that I have seen horrible things about agents. Darcie comes to mind. But in my case, she has been nothing but lovely. Maybe it was because I pass really well, and I&#39;m pretty, and she hoped to have me film a paid for promotional video.
</p>
<p>
What I dislike a lot, however, is the way you paint my character. You know nothing of me, of my struggles, of my morals. Nothing I have said has been a lie. I almost died twice while I was there. Is it not outrageous enough for you ?
</p>
<p>
I am sorry that you have been botched, truly, I am. But saying I am a liar, based of off nothing, that&#39;s disguting.

U r not credible, if you would have 2L of urine inside u would b dead. Show results,  prove your statements. Your profile is new, you don&#39;t state your location, you don&#39;t provide any evidence for your statements and you state incorrect things. Your English is not native but you talk about English like it would be you home language.
<br>
Show pictures,  show me your fingers inside, show me no2 inside and how deep it is, and so on. Show your results after 3 weeks, and so on. Everyone can write that one was on the moon but not everyone can supply evidence of the rocket flight. If Kamol is so desperate for customers they probably can just improve quality of their work and services in general instead of paying trolls for fake PR.

I am not credible ? What is that supposed to mean ? In my answer to your comment, I stated that I had a 50% chance of being botched, and that I got lucky to have the results that I had. I read your review. I&#39;m sorry what happened to you happened to you.
</p>
<p>
As for English, no, I&#39;m not a native, I&#39;m German, what about it.
</p>
<p>
As for pictures, fine, you want them so bad, have at it !

There, posted the pictures. Happy now ? The last picture, I have the number 4 inside, and that&#39;s after 1 month and three days. Better than number two. Here you go.

Good luck for the future, the pictures do prove it is a fake review,  the scars are well healed,  it not 3 or 4 weeks but solid 3 months after op. No 4 gets in about 5 months after if it does at all (based not only on my experience but another 4 people).
</p>
<p>
First picture with stiches is about a month after the operation,  other pictures are many many weeks past the op. Remember that I had this operation, few of my friends did after me, you really need to work harder if you want to convince people and make it looking credible.
</p>
<p>
I would not say a word if this review would be real but my blood boils when I read fake things like that. I can understand greedy business but when it puts carelessly people lifes in danger then I can&#39;t just close my eyes and pretend I can&#39;t see it.
</p>
<p>
I wish you all the best.

For the love of fucking God, is there any pleasing you ? You ask for details, I detail. You ask for pictures, I provide them. And you still are bothered.
</p>
<p>
Once again : I DO NOT WORK FOR KAMOL. I know that they have gotten shit reviews by quite a few girls, and I believe that these reviews are real. What kind of sponkeswoman would say that ? I also believe I got lucky.
</p>
<p>
But all of this is real. The catheter is taken out after 8 days. On the first picture, it&#39;s still in. You&#39;ve been to the hospital. You know how it works.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve always healed very fast. I&#39;m young, my cells work well.
</p>
<p>
What I believe is this : you had a shit result. You blog post proves it. So either you are jealous, bitter, or you want to protect people from the evil corporation that is Kamol Hospital. Once again, I have no attachment to them. From what I understood, they botched people on the regular. But not me. I got what I wanted, and beyond it.
</p>
<p>
But I also took pictures everyday, twice a day, for my entire stay there. Would you be happy if I posted them all ? Genuinly asking, as I hate being called a liar.

I feel very sad for you :/. What went wrong ?
</p>
<p>
I showed my results to multiple men who were more than pleased with what they saw.
</p>
<p>
Sorry that Vanessa was not the best with you ? What happened ?
