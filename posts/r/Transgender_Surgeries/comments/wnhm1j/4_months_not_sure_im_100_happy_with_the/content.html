You look proportional, with a very long opening however, If that’s what you’re referring to, tho you look good, it’s attractive down there.

Thank you,  been very self conscious and hard on myself since surgery. Yeah I&#39;ve felt it&#39;s alot longer then any girl I&#39;ve seen but the canal entrance very close to the butthole which helps it look more natural.

I hope this brings peace: The same way our FFS cannot guarantee to look like a model but rather like the best cis-like version of ourselves, it seems that SRS also lands our initial genitalia into the best possible outcome with what was there to start with. And provided good surgeons, which seems to be the best available right now, each neo-vagina/vulva is going to be what it is.
</p>
<p>
I also was very self-conscious, in a gender-dysphoric way, about a lot of things. It turns out a lot of what we experience as gender dysphoria is nothing but the standard body dysmorphia (unrelated to gender) that ANY woman tends to experience. It&#39;s largely based on warped idea of what &#34;normal for a woman&#34; means, and even what &#34;normal for a
<strong>
cis
</strong>
woman&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I have been privileged to see a decent number of vulvas in person and had my eyes very, very close to them (I enjoy going down on women obviously), from very different women, ethnicity, sizes and shapes, etc. I also have taken interest in feminist efforts to make (mainly cis) women feel more comfortable in their bodies. The latter is accessible to everyone, like exhibitions of replications of real vulvas from participants, etc. There&#39;s been a lot of work done on that recently now that the West is in a phase where women are starting to talk and show openly matters related to their sexuality and bodies (which is great!).
</p>
<p>
Vulvas are wildly varied and it goes to the extent that many cis vulvas would be perceived as a totally and blatantly &#34;botched&#34; jobs from our distorted idea of &#34;normal&#34; or pretty. See for yourself. Turns out, it&#39;s just how they are born, it&#39;s not deformity, just the normal spectrum. More women have vulvas that DON&#39;T look like the socially, porn-influenced, popular idea of a nice/normal vulva. There&#39;s peace to be found in accepting that vulvas of everyday women, in real life, most often look NOTHING like cunnilingus pornstar vulvas.
</p>
<p>
Back to general body gender dysphoria and dysmorphia, It helped me a LOT to find online pictures of cis women that naturally have more pronounced traits than I have on the stuff I was dysphoric about.
</p>
<p>
I used to be dysphoric about my arm hair for example (which in hindsight was 100% ridiculous! but I didn&#39;t know then). Then I realised that most cis women are actually hairier than me (by paying attention to their body hair, which I usually don&#39;t do), including on their arms. Now I know that the hair on my arm is perhaps below cis average density and thickness. It&#39;s interesting how the mere fact most humans cover most of their bodies, or put in a lot of work to try and match an artificial beauty standard, leaves us with a perception of &#34;normality&#34; or &#34;nice-looking&#34; that is usually both ill-informed (statistically very incorrect due to lack of seeing what&#39;s out there) and also based on a distorted idea of what&#39;s normal, which is more due to beauty standards. There&#39;s also &#34;genital characteristics bias&#34; in porn: not just big &#34;model&#34; c**ks but also designer vulvas with statistically exceptional depth &amp; stretchability.
<strong>
That&#39;s not your everyday vulvas
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
A lot of cis women with everyday vulvas would envy the aesthetics of yours. Just like a lot of cis women (and trans women) would really envy how pretty and feminine your face looks on your profile photo. We can only get the best from what randomly start with (an unfair lottery of genetics, let&#39;s just accept that fact) and learn to be happy with it, and be certain that many others have it worse, and that our surgeries could have gone very bad, but didn&#39;t. A bit of stoicism always saves the day. Have a lovely day and thank you so much for sharing. It empowers the community.
</p>
<p>
PS: Even when we think we care little about what others think, the kind words of since aesthetic appreciation from those who really like our dysphoric parts, has the power of inviting us to a new, more self-loving perspective. When you find people that tell you you have a grrrrreat &lt;uhum&gt;, and that they find YOUR KIND of it particularly sexy or amazing, you&#39;ll see the magic it does and the worlds it changes :)

Thank you for your kind and thoughtful post.  I truly appreciate the time and energy you put into that comment. I&#39;m in a better place mentally now about the whole process and have stopped being so hard on myself.

They state an average depth of 17cm and this is a direct quote from there site &#34;.A vaginal depth of 6 inches (15cm) is virtually guaranteed in every case.&#34;

Yeah, that&#39;s pretty small. I&#39;ve seen 4′ 11″ tall girls with 8 or 9 inch deep vaginas but I don&#39;t how that&#39;s possible.

Yeah i&#39;m 5&#39; 10&#34; so not really sure what happened. Was hoping for more so I had some wiggle room to lose a little depth, but now I&#39;m forced to grind away as I don&#39;t want less then 14cm.
