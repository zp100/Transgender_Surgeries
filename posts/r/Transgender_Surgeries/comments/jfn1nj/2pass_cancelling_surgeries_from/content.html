Essentially over time there have been a tonne of people who’s livelihoods and self worth have been destroyed by his blatant disregard for their humanity in favour of doing whatever the hell he wants and gaslighting them into accepting it. I haven’t even been on this sub for that long (about 1 year) and I’ve seen my fair share of distraught posts about how people have nerve damage, numbness years after, disfigurement etc and how their concerns were brushed aside and belittled.

Even if I
<strong>
could
</strong>
have surgery with them, I would avoid it like the plague.

Love the, we have a lottery for patients who don’t negatively review us, let’s us buy your opinion and maybe we’ll still let you get your surgery section

at least 90% of the negative posts on this subreddit are from his patients.  too bad he doesn&#39;t cancel the whole world...
</p>
<p>
seriously, i&#39;m subscribed to tons of subs and only skim this one, and I still have his name etched in blood in my memory.  can only wish he goes out of business and soon...

It is because of American patients he botched. I think it may be the patient he put in a coma. I&#39;d also add that they also accused all negative reviews written about them as paid reviews by their competitor in Europe which they like to say is FT. While he pays his own patients to give him reviews and asks his fraudulent team to write him fake reviews on Realself and Google. Look at Google he was 3.2 stars and in a day he went up to 4.2 stars beware! He can only be STOP if enough people are made aware of his year on year botching. He also damaged me beyond repair and to this day suffer greatly from the few hours of his butchery in his slaughter house. Butcher Bart Van de Ven is a predator making a living out of ruining trans faces with his experimental surgery!
