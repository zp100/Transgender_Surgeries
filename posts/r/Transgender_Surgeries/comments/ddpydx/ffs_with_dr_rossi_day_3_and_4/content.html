Last night was the worst of the swelling. The jaw and chin were fairly painful, and the restless legs triggered by the surgery hit again so I got very little sleep overnight. I did get more sleep this morning though.
</p>
<p>
Definitely feel like I’ve gotten over the hump as far as swelling goes though. Amanda mentioned I look less puffy than yesterday and I feel a lot better than I did this morning. Still a long way to go but assuming there aren’t surprises, I should be able to go sightseeing on Monday or a Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
The one gross thing I didn’t know about was massaging the jaw and chin. It not only is for getting out any food bits that might get into the wounds, but also to drain the fluids that collect their, especially my chin which is where they did most of the work.
</p>
<p>
The essentially cut my chin then advanced it and put a plate over it. My dimple is definitely still there but much reduced. Won’t know how it looks for quite awhile though since the swelling there probably will be the last to go.
</p>
<p>
Finally got a look at my breasts last night and it’s...weird. I mean I love them, but it’s such a huge change. They’re definitely proportional to my frame which was the intent.

The pain is manageable with pain killers. Haven’t really had much problem there. More annoying things like inability to see well.

Your face looks so healed already! I agree with Amanda the change is already apparent.
