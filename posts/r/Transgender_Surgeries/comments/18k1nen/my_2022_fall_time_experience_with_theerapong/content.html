I didn&#39;t go through Interplast directly, it was through the old Siam Transformative and became the problem for me Wow!!, everything was caused by this greedy first name starting with &#34;B&#34; just a snarky lying SOB !! When I 1 st met this person I sensed this from the git go really !!
</p>
<p>
It was shear garbage to get me in the Mali Hospital to secure her little profits and I literally never had not once a talk/consult with Dr. Theerapong and never met this other surgeon either, such bullsh#t going on - this &#34;B&#34; said my physical was my consult and could have asked at this time, just crap ! It was all about securing her profit.
</p>
<p>
I have almost exactly the same mess originally from Kamol 2019, looks like nothing aesthetically was even done - it&#39;s been over a year and I can tell you Theerapong doesn&#39;t give a fk! Is my experience for a past patient obviously?? He knows !! And he&#39;s far from being a Stupid surgeon and what is most disturbing is it appears everyone else that gets surgery from him he takes the time to really talk to you and show diagrams etc. how he&#39;ll approach a revision etc. I got nothing !!
</p>
<p>
Supposedly he&#39;s a gentle nice person - not what I got just Bullsh#t , the hospital staff were fine all I can say but?- my experience was crap and being deliberately Ghosted by him this entire last year ? &#34;Theerapong&#34; personally now tells a lot about him to me ? so if this is the way he&#39;ll deal with me post op 2022 I&#39;II &#34;SLAG HIM&#34; Sorry, he&#39;s not worth a &#34;SH#T&#34; Then, Wow! really ?
</p>
<p>
If this is his attitude toward a patient who wanted to &#34;TRUST&#34; ? - then he&#39;s only just a cut just above Kamol nothing better sorry to say! - and I have a mess still because of this A-hole &#34;B&#34; sticking her nose in my business and is basically just was a bloody Taxi Driver out for profits for the old Siam Transformative which is now defunct as a business.
</p>
<p>
This  idiot who caused all my problems because of greed - I get the impression she told &#34;Theerapong &#34; I didn&#39;t want a Consult and just do the surgery in Thai to secure her money by getting me quickly into the Mali Hospital, something is not right with this B#tch ! being an &#34;EX&#34; US Texas Patriot who grew up in Bangkok because her father was in the Military early 1960&#39;s .
</p>
<p>
Anyways she learned full reading/writing in Thai Language in a Thai school growing up in Bangkok and became the interpreter for Siam Transformative - who&#39;d be stupid enough to have an 11 hour, blood transfusion Sigmoid Colon Vaginoplasty surgery without a consult.     &#34;I guess me&#34;      something had to have been &#34;SAID&#34; by this b#tch &#34;B&#34; in Thai to &#34;FORGO&#34; a one on one consult with Dr. Theerapong I never got!!
</p>
<p>
A lot of money Spent for a serious Revision  including flight 29k Canadian dollars Wow! Without a proper verbal Consult and the guy speaks English anyways and does World conferences in English and nothing was really done Aesthetically and I&#39;m still smoke&#39;n mad over a year now because of this sh#t going on at the time with this &#34;B&#34; charlatan money grabber !! and to boot now I&#39;m Black Listed !!

I had basically No complications really - Theerapong does a good canal as per se but forget about  aesthetic revisions and  obviously he won‚Äôt open a person like a 1 st time SRS , all I got was external soluble stitches that just didn‚Äôt work in the end aesthetically ‚Äî I had almost ‚Äú0‚Äù pain start to finish , no bleeding , Sigmoid/Jejunum is far superior to having a thin walled possibly tear it post op PPT but that‚Äôs my bias I admit -
</p>
<p>
at least Sigmoid is a ready made bowel segment and the surgeon is not having to do multiple sutures creating an ‚ÄúEgg roll‚Äù canal - just so much work when it‚Äôs simple to take a bowel segment ‚Äî I have about 7 1/2 inches using the largest Orange Soul Source dilator now - I would have gone to Theerapong or Kunaporn in hind sight if I had known about Kamol before I went to him , my bad , a mistake ? At least I wasn‚Äôt outright butchered by Kamol 1 st time But ? I can give him this much but others are struggling with interns learning the ropes and doing terrible surgeries at the Kamol Hospital now ?

How could you get GRS without discussing the process with your surgeon?  Oh my gosh!

It was a revision getting Sigmoid - How ? That&#39;s the issue without a true Consult I never got ? I&#39;M PISSED !!  and just a physical the day before nothing else ? It still blows me away of over a year ago - I guess my age and having it  originally done by Kamol I guess Wow !
</p>
<p>
I was dealing with the ground person named  &#34;B&#34; who in order to run the original  Name ( Siam Transformative ) and this person speaks fluent Thai reads and writes also going to school in Bangkok from TEXAS ? - the Bank account was in her Husbands name because she married  him 40 plus year&#39;s ago , he&#39;s Thai born - she would over inflate the costs from standard service cost pull the extra money üí∞ out and pay Theerapong in full -- This is why she did not want me to have a Consult because it interferes scamming extra money beyond what they needed as a Service Company .
</p>
<p>
It is surprising how she had to have talked in Thai to Convince Theerapong I didn&#39;t want a Consult Wow ! Very far from the truth - a scammer !
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a Thai Law suite started in Bangkok -- she&#39;s changed the name to &#34; SIAM TRANSFORMATION &#34; &#34;B&#34; is basically just a taxi driver in reality !  This new company does not have a Thai BANGKOK business permit and neither her or the Nurse have a proper  NURSING  licence to work as per se in Bangkok either !
</p>
<p>
Because I bitched things have been said and I&#39;ve been &#34;Blacklisted&#34; as a patient now caused bye this scam artist - I don&#39;t think Theerapong new anything about scamming patients by this particular person as long as he got paid !
</p>
<p>
I felt unfinished when leaving Bangkok and still need a serious Labiaplasty never done - my vaginoplasty does work well from Theerapong but nothing else was ever talked about - stay away from &#34; Siam Transformation &#34; a stolen name now from &#34; Transfomative &#34; originally !
</p>
<p>
Deal with &#34; Amani &#34; she&#39;s legit just ended up with a bad partner who&#39;s still scamming patients using &#34; Siam Transformation &#34; now - stay away from &#34; B &#34;

That&#39;s so awful. I had a long consultation with my surgeon in Phuket both for BAb and for GRS.  Had the jejunal graft method and very happy.  Considering what he had to work with.  This life affecting surgery is so so important to us.  I can understand your anger
