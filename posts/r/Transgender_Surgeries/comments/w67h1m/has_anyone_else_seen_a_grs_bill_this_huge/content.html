I had PI vaginoplasty with Dr. John Pang at Mount Sinai in NYC on June 13th this year.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t received a final bill that I have to pay yet, but I did randomly decide to log into my insurance&#39;s website to see if there were any updates. And... yes. Apparently Mount Sinai has indeed sent my insurance a bill. I can&#39;t see a breakdown of the bill, but I do see the bottom line dollar amount in &#34;pending&#34;. You want to know how much it says?
</p>
<p>
For the hospital stay, they charged $120k. For the surgery, $285k. In total, over $400k.
</p>
<p>
Never, not once in all of my research, have I ever heard someone having to pay an amount this monumentally huge, even those whose insurance didn&#39;t cover it. I even spoke to a few people who had the exact same surgeon as me, and none of them saw an amount this large.
</p>
<p>
I know it&#39;s still pending, and it&#39;s possible that the insurance will negotiate it to a lower amount, but this lingering giant number is worrying me. My insurance told me a while back that they&#39;ll cover 80% of the surgery, but that would still leave me with $80k to pay, which is still more than expected.
</p>
<p>
Am I alone here? Has anyone else seen an amount this huge? What came of it? Any info at all would be helpful.

Often times the non negotiated bill will be ridiculous.  Then your insurance will negotiate it down to normal rates. And then figure out what you owe.  And then later they will double check and negotiate down anything which was still wrong or pending and may refund you any difference.   I have had refunds two or three times now from my medical organization.

Seconded the non-negotiated bill will be ridiculous. Mine was 290k$~ before, and 17k$~ after negotiated, then after insurance and all kicked in I was left with 5k$~ but after calling their financial department I was left with a even more reduced bill of 800$ that I just haven’t paid and will just try to stall through collections until it’s no longer legally collectible.

So you&#39;re really going to fuck over your credit history for 800 bucks. I&#39;m guessing if you know that. You probably have defaulted on debts before, and don&#39;t give a rats ass about credit. Good luck buying any thing in the future that requires a loan, or renting a nice apartment. Even getting certain jobs.

Well if my credit was as good as i have it and didn&#39;t have a child i would definitely not pay the $800.  Specially because if you choose that obtion you probably don&#39;t have much money. Totally support this

I&#39;m actually a professional in this area, and I&#39;ll attempt to explain the &#34;normal scenario&#34;. There&#39;s a lot of exceptions that are possible, but as long as you&#39;re covered by a reasonably large insurance company, this should apply.
</p>
<p>
The hospital will be billing marked-up charges for everything they can legally charge (and the charges will be high, for historical, but not entirely obsolete reasons that make sense). The total charges on the procedure aren&#39;t really going to matter though. The hospital and insurer will have prenegotiated the acceptable rate of payment for literally every possible procedure/treatment/emergency that could arise in their care. The hospital will be expected to immediately adjust the value of the procedure down to this rate. The insurer will also do this independently, then review the claim. The insurer will have the opportunity to judge the medical record for any problems, then either pay or deny the claim. If they pay, they will pass-on the copay/deductible to the patient in order for the hospital to collect the remainder. In your case, it sounds like 20% of the procedure cost, which is pretty standard. This will probably be reduced to your yearly out of pocket maximum, with insurance paying the difference.
</p>
<p>
This should cover about 90-95% of scenarios, so I hope that covers you as well, but in happy to explain more!

Well, the first kinds of terms we saw in provider-insurance contracts were pretty much just % discount rates on total billed charges. Obviously though, under those terms, a provider is incentivized to raise charges and/or perform excess services. To combat the inflationary nature of charges, the added yearly escalator clauses that said, for example, you can only raise your prices by 8% each year. To combat the excess, bureaucracies were set up to review the medical record.
</p>
<p>
Well, after several decades of this, eventually prices getting out of control (rising faster than inflation, becuase providers are nearly forced to raise prices by the max amount each year). At the same time, medicine is getting more complicated and resource intensive. In walks LBJ, pushing Medicare/Medicaid, which completely rewrite the book. These programs demand to pay based on a model of the average costs incurred for all patients treated for the same ailment. A whole system is put together to track reported costs from all the providers in the country, and develop a Case Rate for everything. This system becomes so effective that even the private sector insurers jump on board and slowly roll-up all the old style contracts into this type of contract.
</p>
<p>
However, to this day, the old style contracts still exist, even if they are the tiny minority of contracts, so providers need to hit that max price increase. There&#39;s also now &#34;Stop-loss&#34; clauses in the case rate contracts that allow for defaulting to the old model if the patient is a statistical anamoly in required resources--someone who stays sicker waaaaayyyyy longer than others with the same problem. So I don&#39;t think this issue is going away soon either. There are other smaller factors, but this is kind of the main deal.

That&#39;s ridiculously high, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too uncommon for American surgeons used to billing insurance.
</p>
<p>
For reference, I went to the Suporn clinic and was given a clean, exact quote of around $23,000 CAD for everything including hospital, anesthesia, surgery, all medications, a revision I needed while in Thailand, an optional revision between 1-2 years postop, and some other things. AFAIK, no one had to pay for any complications, such as needing multiple revisions while in Thailand. I think this quote is pretty in line with American and Canadian surgeons used to patients paying out of pocket, but some/many American surgeons seem to be inflating their prices ever since insurance coverage became more widespread.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re dealing with this uncertainty. Personally, it seems ridiculous that so many surgeons don&#39;t give upfront quotes. I hope everything turns out okay &lt;3

If you went to a surgeon and he quoted 400k or even 100k what would be the next thing you did?  Me, I&#39;d be out looking for another in my ability to pay range.  I&#39;m on medicare and recently spent 3 nights in a hospital having been admitted thru the emergency room.  The bill came to $20K and medicare paid $2,700 and another insurance paid an additional $700.  Thirty four hundred is a far cry from $20k.  I understand the cost(s) involved in setting up and running a facility whether a private practice or public facility.  I am always embarrassed and frustrated to see the pittance the doctor who is trying to help me gets from the insurance.  I&#39;m always in fear of Discounted Payment equals Discounted Care, Hippocratic Oath aside.

If you haven’t already make sure to check if the hospital has financial assistance programs! You might be able to get the owed amount even lower if they do

AFAIK most surgeons who use robotic techniques do charge upwards of 70-90k USD for a procedure even if you&#39;re paying out of pocket. The robotic techniques cost more due to equipment and additional medical training.  For a standard PI non-robotic surgery it&#39;s around 30-40k USD if you pay out of pocket.

That&#39;s mostly up to anecdotes. Aesthetically, outcomes vary. I&#39;ve seen surgeons that don&#39;t do robotic PPT create more realistic results than ones that do, and some that don&#39;t. The wiki is a great place to judge aesthetic outcomes.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m pretty sure robots are only used to harvest peritoneal tissue in PPT surgeries, so the canal will be all or partially peritoneal. Again, whether this makes a big difference in the end result is up to anecdotes, which you can read through in the wiki.

<p>
This is correct. The robot part of the surgery has nothing to do with how you look down there.

Aesthetics depends much more heavily on the surgeon than whether they use robots. As
<a href="/u/SRSwithBanksy" rel="nofollow">u/SRSwithBanksy</a>
mentioned PPT almost exclusively uses robots. But really you could use a robot for a standard PI. They just give the surgeons access to different techniques and based on the results I&#39;ve seen can lead to a lower likelyhood of obvious scarring around the vagina. You do get 3-4 additional scars along your waistline  and belly button where the robotic arms enter, but for most people those heal pretty invisibly.

Yeah, that&#39;s fair. It&#39;s just that OP said they had PI, and I had non-inversion so it might be somewhat comparable.

I&#39;m going to Guadalajara for Cosmetic SRS with Ivan Aguilar, total is $10,500. Includes hospital, anesthesia, surgeon and daily nurse visits for 2 weeks post-op (and transportation). I will need to pay $100 for lab tests the day before surgery. No insurance involved.

I keep hearing unsolicited positive reviews of Dr. Aguilar. I&#39;m actually a little surprised that I was able to schedule so quickly and the cost is so low. My therapist was asking me about research I did on surgeons and how many I consulted with. Yep, I&#39;m that girl... Dr. Aguilar was the first surgeon I contact and I scheduled right away. I figured I could drop off the schedule if I started to hear negative things, but it&#39;s been exactly the opposite!

Actually yes! I went to Dr. BBL at NYU Langone and the pre-negotiated costs were around $330,000 if I recall correctly. I think insurance ultimately ended up paying around $120,000 which still seemed wild. Couldn&#39;t be happier with everything but I was shocked.

In 2019 total hospital bill was around $230k. With insurance I paid around $2500. Unfortunately my surgeon does not accept insurance so that was a separate bill but I knew that going in and was prepared for it.

Your surgeon didn&#39;t take your insurance but you still used them and only paid 2500? How did you make that work? I don&#39;t understand

If I understand correctly, the 2500 only covers hospital charges such as hospital stays but does not include surgeon fees, so there&#39;s a separate charge for it

That&#39;s correct. You can still put it through your insurance as out of network depending on your out of network maximum deductible but your insurance will still only cover what they deem a coverable amount for the procedure

[hip hop bassline] This is America.
</p>
<p>
The prices charged A) aren&#39;t the actual cost of things B) aren&#39;t what gets paid most of the time. Dr.s / Hospitals often charge multiple times the actual &#39;price&#39; of things in addition to markup. A bottle of tylenol / paracetamol might cost 10 USD in the store but you might get charged 20 USD for 2 pills in a hospital.  Insurance always negotiates prices down so care providers over charge knowing they won&#39;t get what they ask. If a person wanted to pay out of pocket, that is without insurance, they&#39;d get a much different bill because they know an individual isn&#39;t going to argue about prices.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not an efficient system.

Holy shit though. A packet of paracetamol in a store is like.. 50p-£1 here. Less than a single US dollar basically. Even that sounds preposterously overpriced at its baseline cost.

It&#39;s been my experience that what is shows billed, isn&#39;t exactly truthful. It&#39;s a game played with the consumer. The insurance company would have never agreed to the price, way before the procedure was done. It&#39;s in my opinion a fictional number for the consumers purpose. Showing a high number and then your insurance company later tells you a substantial lower amount, letting you know they covered the majority. I highly doubt the entire cost billed was actually 60k. It&#39;s to keep the consumer in the dark and helps the insurance company justify the annual increase in premiums.

Even if you end up with a huge amount as your 20% “copay” your plan has a Max Out of Pocket” limit which is the max you’ll pay in a given year before your insurance pays 100% of it. It’s usually from 4,500 to 9,000$

If they are in network and you have insurance, your plan probably has an out of pocket maximum much lower than $80k. If you log onto your insurance account on their website that info and how much you have left to pay this year should be available. That max is usually around $8k-$10k from what I can remember so unless you have a weird plan with no maximum that&#39;s probably the max you&#39;d be looking at.

I had surgery with Dr. Ting through Mt. Sinai on April 25, and my insurance-billed amount was similar. I haven’t gotten a final bill yet either, so I assume that the hospital has no intention of actually sticking with that amount.

Mine was during Covid, so the bill with Ting was around 200k between his, the anesthesiologist, and the hospital. The scary charge was the room, 16,500$ per day. Had to have a private room, for mitigation reasons. They wanted me to pay all of that. I had to fight for them to pay that, told I had no choice the hospital had no choice…. By this was all sorted I was out of pocket about 5k, my max for the year. Found a local breast cancer surgeon who does reconstruction as well. Had my augmentation done for free….so in the end working within your plan you can get ally of benefit if you work with them some.

20 months ago I paid Christine McGinn 17,500, and she’s absolutely top flight. Insurance covered the hospital and I paid the anesthesiologist about $2,000. Your bill seems preposterous.

<p>
I recommend to everyone that they discuss the costs with the providers up front. I realize that’s not going to help you.

The bill sent to insurance is very different numbers than what’s adjusted to the individual. Our GRS insurance bill was $77k.   The private pay version was $29k.

Does your insurance have an out of pocket maximum? I am having surgery with Bella at Mt. Sinai soon and my insurance works like I pay the first 1500 of medical expenses 100% (deductible) then they cover 80% I pay 20% until I hit my out of pocket maximum of $4000 paid, then beyond that insurance pays for anything they cover. With all the other medical expenses I&#39;ve had this year for normal things, I&#39;m expecting to pay $1k out of pocket for surgery before I hit my out of pocket max.
