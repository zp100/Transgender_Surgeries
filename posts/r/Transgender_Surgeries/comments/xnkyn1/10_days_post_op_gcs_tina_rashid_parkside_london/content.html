Yeah I’m also curious about that. My assumption is blood is trying to circulate around the wound and is pooling in the hips and later in the abdomen but that’s just a physics based guess

Yeah, I&#39;ve had that happen when I sprained by ankle - blood collected in the bottom of my feet and toes. Quite scary looking. Also painful.

I posted this later, but not as a reply so it&#39;s gotten lost: Look back in profile, bruising was much much worse! Seems to have developed outwards from surgery site. Parkside were injecting SubC blood thinners daily -  Enoxaparin (anti DVT) but this makes bruises develop more too. Others were not as badly bruised as me. Bruises heal anyway and won&#39;t effect outcome.

Also poss that I fell off ma perch while asleep!!! Before they put in the aesthetic, I was asked to lie on my side (side with the bruising), this making it easier for them to do the subsequent spinal block. Maybe this was a factor? The bruise on my stomach is from the Enoxaparin injections, I started getting them in the thigh, where they bruised rather less. Stingy wee shites, they go in fine then start stinging later. I called them &#39;scorpions&#39; !! I suspect you could avoid, but they would have you sign a disclaimer stating that you had declined Anti-DVT meds and would thus pay extra for any DVT related medical actions that were required. I got one night off the Enoxaparin as I was bleeding night prior to pressure bandage removal so blood was given a chance to thicken up. Enoxaparin makes your blood pretty watery.

10 Days Post Op Update. Healing continues to go well. Still nothing I would consider to be pain, just a little discomfort. Seem to be able to sit fine, walk fine (2KM today). Hard surfaces require doughnut cushion, sofa is fine without. Still bruised and swollen. Left labia has visible suture line on it, hopefully less visible with bio oil use, it&#39;s also twice the size of right, Hoping this is just swelling. Some minor wound breakdown (dehiscence) at end of V-line behind vagina. Quite bloody when I gently part inner labia. I can feel good sensations around here but not investigated further! Dilation is becoming easier, few mins with purple to last dot and 20 mins with blue just short of last dot. Very little discharge/ gunk. Using ultra thin pads right now, sleeping on pad in new birthday suit. Happy with my healing so far at 10 days. Next update at 20 days unless it goes pear shaped in the interim.

Not from what I&#39;ve been told. Listen to your body and don&#39;t do too much too soon seems to be key. Mobilising is important for healing anyway - reducing swelling and anti-DVT.

I heard moving about too much too early can cause prolapse or something. Anyway I thought you were supposed to not do so much this early.

Thank you for sharing, your results are looking really good! I think Tina Rashid is my preferred surgeon. If I ever get through the waiting list or manage save enough to go private that is!

Private does have one advantage for the money these days as it would still be at parkside in a private room with loo rather than St George&#39;s recovering on a ward. The food at parkside was excellent as well. I put on 2kg!!

I believe this is a recent change for TR - doing NHS patients at St George&#39;s. I also believe that the cost for private has leapt from £15K to £23K which is quite shocking.

Oh, I hadn&#39;t realised there had been a cost increase. By more than 50% too :( :( I might actually get to my first appointment before I can save anywhere that much. I&#39;m really glad for you that you have reached this point &lt;3

It’s called profiteering from huge waiting lists and the more private operating time done equals even less for NHS  This is the actual truth but sadly too many refuse to understand this

Deffo some truth in that, but TR mainly moved to St George&#39;s for NHS patients due to lack of available theatre time at Parkside. Place was busy and they do all sorts of private ops via folks works private health insurance. GCS is just a small part of it.
</p>
<p>
When it was 15K there was a 5K/10K split TR/PS. Would be interested to know what the new split is, and indeed whether the GCS monopoly that got created when Nuffield Health bought ParkSide prompted the move to NHS St George&#39;s hospital for NHS patients.

Out of interest did you have health factors that caused them to give you SubC? I’m scared of having a load of bruises! I’m gonna be there for my vaginoplasty in a few weeks :)

Unless you are already bleeding excessively they show up daily with  the enoxaparin blood thinning injections. Get it in your thigh, alternate daily, it left big welts on my stomach when they did it there. They are pretty strict on the anti-DVT stuff, you&#39;ll be attached to some inflatable cuffs around your calf&#39;s first 2 nights post op to keep the blood moving around. After you get wheeled back in, you just get to could down the tubes until there is just the cath left.
</p>
<p>
Note that others in there were not as bruised as me!
</p>
<p>
I got a UTI, I felt like I would have had bladder control a couple days before catheter+pack removal and am now aware that making a wee bit of a fuss about the catheter would likely have seen it removed 1 or 2 days earlier which might have saved me the UTI. Getting rid of the catheter is a huge bonus - bloody thing! If you have Q&#39;s ahead of or after surgery, DM is open - same goes for others!
</p>
<p>
NB SubC is the method of delivery into the sub cutaneous fat layers rather than IM (like decapeptyl) or IV  (like your morphene) for instance.
</p>
<p>
I made myself extremely well informed ahead of admission re what was going to happen on each day. I am a bit of a control freak!!

Just managed a 2km walk to local co-op and back. Right now that feels like progress even if I do now feel like I&#39;ve just climbed a mountain! I purchased 4x wee pretty cup-cakes which we shall enjoy later!

Looking good I m supposed to be down on a list for her but waiting list out of control and the more people go private then there is even less capacity for NHS  Only 2 surgeons operating on NHS patients and one I would not let anywhere near my Jody

There are 4 Surgeons doing GCS for NHS and private in UK right now. Tim Larner and Mr Cocker down at Nuffield Brighton and Tina Rachid and James Bellringer at Nuffield Parkside. TR also does NHS patients at NHS St George&#39;s Hospital. I have seen decent results from TL at Brighton. I think I can guess who you don&#39;t want near you!! I never met him. I hear he was on a golfing holiday!

My info is the other 2 Which o didn’t count as their op time for NHS has been Reduced to almost negligible partly as a side effect of Mr Thomas death ( he still had an oversight role ) this has reduced numbers by over 50% and they have not got an effective remedy in place  They can’t even supply wait times information at all because of the mess  Add to that the reorganisation of provider services. Also I suspect and have had it confirmed that ageism is at play as people who were referred after seem to be ahead I ve seen several examples of this confirmed  The more private work they do the less NHS work is done  Their contracts allow them to do this

As for private Vs NHS. I would have been 60 if I had waited for the NHS (not been seen yet). I can&#39;t take the cash with me, and life is too short. I&#39;m lucky to be old enough that I can make adjustments to finances/assets to free up the required funds, but it will be bread+water and no holls for several years now. More surgeons need training those that are already urologists likely have many of the skills required already only this will fix the NHS waiting lists.

Give it a few years and I think the NHS is going to be in a far worse state than it is now.

Some months off any good feelings! Still pretty swollen right now and uncomfortable. Nothing I would describe as pain though.

(Forgive me if I&#39;m wrong. I haven&#39;t seen too many post op pictures but)  I think that looks REALLY good for only 10 days

Thanks! Wee bit of minor wound dehiscence developed since I took the pix, but nothing that time, cleanliness and fresh air won&#39;t fix. I have taken to wearing just a loose skirt below with a protector sheet tucked into the rear waist, as pants+pad create the moist environment that will delay healing. Just being careful right now to avoid healing process going backwards!
