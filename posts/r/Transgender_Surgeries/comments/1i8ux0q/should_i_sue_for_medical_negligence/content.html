I had colon SRS last April with Dr. Lago. He punctured my colon. I went back to see him 10 days post op complaining of stomach pain. I was admitted to the hospital for 2 days before he sent me home with a “pelvic infection” diagnosis. I continued to complain of pain when I get home. Dr. Lago told me I could come back to see him but he in no way seemed rushed to see me (which didn’t cause me to worry). He also prescribed me a stronger pain killer. 2 days later I was rushed to another hospital by ambulance (since ambulances will not bring you to private hospitals in Spain, despite Dr. Lago telling me I could call one). I had an emergency laparotomy performed and was charged. Dr. Lago told me he wouldn’t have opened me up and thought the procedure was unnecessary. He said he would have gone in laparoscopically, yet the surgeons at the other hospital said I would have likely died had he gone in that way since my abdomen was far too distended. I then had a second laparotomy performed upon my return home. I was also diagnosed with clinical depression due to the stress from the prior events.
</p>
<p>
After reading this brief summary of my SRS experience, I would like to know if you think I should sue and if I have a chance at winning. I’ve been in contact with a lawyer but they can’t confirm anything until I send them money so they can hire someone to examine the medical files. I would be suing for medical negligence. I’m aware a perforated colon is a risk of the surgery but it’s the fact that the doctor misdiagnosed me which caused everything else to happen. I’d also like to note that since the events, the doctor has not reached out to me once.

I&#39;m very sorry for your experience. Unfortunately, I&#39;m neither a doctor nor a lawyer. But if your lawyer thinks that you have a case, and you have good reasons to trust that lawyer, I would go with that.

Thank you. The thing is the lawyers won’t tell me if I have a case until I pay them 240€ so they can get an expert to examine the files. Obviously that amount of money isn’t a lot in the grand scheme of things especially if they take the case, it’s more if they don’t…

Are you a member of a union? My union here in Germany would pay for a lawyer and legal fees in cases like yours. The membership includes legal protection insurance for work law and social law .

I&#39;d suggest asking ChatGPT. It will be more knowledgeable about the laws in Spain. It can&#39;t tell you definitively, but can at least tell you if the $240 for a real opinion is worth it.

You shouldn&#39;t use ChatGPT for things like that. It lies.

Based on the Downvotes, a lot of people agree with you. However, I personally trust ChatGPT more than random people on Reddit. As I said, ChatGPT isn&#39;t a definitive answer. Just me.

You&#39;re supposed to use a search engine to find proper sources for the information. ChatGPT can at most give you some idea of what to look for.

Depends on what your prompt is. It can&#39;t give legal advice, but could certainly give the pros and cons of a $240 consult.

Sure, but it could be totally made up.

I&#39;m not here to educate you on ChatGPT. There are ways to use it that provide a way of gauging where it&#39;s getting answers from and the validity of those answers, especially since ChatGPT can now do web searches.
</p>
<p>
How many Reddit responses do you think aren&#39;t made up?
