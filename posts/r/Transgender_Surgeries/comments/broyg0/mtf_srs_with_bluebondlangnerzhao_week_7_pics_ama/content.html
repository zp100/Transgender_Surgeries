It&#39;s been a few weeks since my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/bko42f/mtf_srs_with_bluebondlangnerzhao_week_4_pics_ama/">last post
</a>
. There&#39;s not a lot of change day to day, so I&#39;ll be making these posts less frequently and just pick a few photos here and there instead of doing the daily picture thing.
</p>
<p>
So without further ado, here is the
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/zynHtcn">album
</a>
. Some notes to supplement the album captions:
</p>
<p>
There were some requests for how things look with my legs closed, and I&#39;ve included a few from the last few weeks. There are several, so just click the album to see them. Too lazy; didn&#39;t link.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve moved to the largest (orange) dilator. I&#39;m no longer dilating past the last dot, I think I was only able to do that at first because of the extreme swelling (
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/aZVtr4L.jpg">remember?
</a>
So glad those days are over...). I can get the last dot inside with some pressure/stretching, but it comfortably rests about
<a href="https://imgur.com/U9jR6w1">here
</a>
now.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/VcaBXKY">My belly button
</a>
is healing over, but still waiting for the scars to fade.
</p>
<p>
I had some areas where labia majora met the canal entrance that were taking a long time to heal over, but it&#39;s finally healed. I&#39;ve started using my scar cream on the outer suture lines now that the tissue has closed. I still have some areas healing inside the canal entrance, but it&#39;s sloughing tissue (the yellow stuff) and not raw bleedy tissue.
</p>
<p>
There is still a lot of asymmetric swelling that&#39;s making things look sorta lopsided.
<a href="https://imgur.com/NT1OAGi">This
</a>
is about the best pic I could get to show it.
</p>
<p>
She finally got a haircut the other day, carefully with scissors since it&#39;s hard to get a razor down there and I don&#39;t want to deal with any post-shave itchies. Here&#39;s how things are looking these days:
<a href="https://imgur.com/7qeUraA">legs open
</a>
,
<a href="https://imgur.com/r3OQVz9">legs closed
</a>
,
<a href="https://imgur.com/wysgkn8">spread
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
I think it&#39;s kinda cute how the labia minora &#34;hide&#34; in the right labia major when my legs are closed because of the swelling. I tell my wife that she&#39;s shy :)
</p>
<p>
As far as sensitivity goes, I can orgasm, but it&#39;s just because my labia minora have some very sensitive spots. I don&#39;t have any sensation in my clitoris yet, though I do get sharp, stingy pains in it randomly as the nerves heal. It&#39;s annoying now, but it&#39;s a good sign for the future. The vaginal canal seems to be starting to get some sensation back -- I (gently) put a toy in there the other day, and it felt much nicer than the dilator! Dilators suck. I can&#39;t wait until things are healed enough to really have some fun!
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it for this update. As always, questions are welcome!

How easily are you moving around now? My surgery is in January 2020 and after about 6-7 weeks my wife will be traveling for a few days and I may need to be able to do some household things for myself then.

Mobility isn&#39;t really an issue at this point. I can do most household chores, drive myself places, and am generally pretty comfortable. The only issues at this point are the amount of time required to dilate 3x/day and endurance -- I can do most things, just not for very long.
</p>
<p>
You should be fine by yourself for a day or two as long as you plan ahead and have food, etc available.

Speaking of driving, how long after surgery before you were able to?

I waited about a month to drive, but did ride a train home about three weeks post-op. I think I probably could have driven (at least short distances) by then.
</p>
<p>
The recovery really does go faster than you&#39;d think. A lot of things are possible soon after surgery, but having the energy to do stuff for a long time is more difficult.

I talk about this more in the first post of the series, but tldr: Dr. Zhao uses a robot to do the internal work (stitching the vaginal canal in place, etc), and the robot enters through the belly button, since the scarring there won&#39;t be super noticeable once it fades. Entering through the belly button is a common technique for doing internal abdominal work.

Look back at the previous posts. They used a hybrid method of the penile inversion method with the new one that uses the (Iâ€™m probably spelling this wrong) peritonium? Which involved some robotic surgery through the bellybutton.

They use a robot to help with the surgery and it goes through your belly button
