I‚Äôve decided to pursue zero depth vaginoplasty as I‚Äôd prefer not to dilate.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm meeting with Dr Jonathan Keith, and I‚Äôve read on multiple threads that he performs the procedure.
</p>
<p>
If anyone else has had this particular surgery, I‚Äôd love to hear about your healing process/thoughts. Most Youtubers only cover regular vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Thank you!

I just had it 2 weeks ago.  I can‚Äôt really comment on ‚Äúwhich is easier‚Äù because a) I am only two weeks post-op, and b) I don‚Äôt know personally what it would have been like to have had full-depth.  I am VERY glad not to have to dilate much‚Äîonly with my finger(s) for a couple of minutes a day.  No biggie.  I also get the very real sense that how much depth you get with ‚Äúzero depth‚Äù really depends on your personal anatomy and even more on the surgeon.  My surgeon was Dr. Wittenberg, and I ended up with about 2.5 inches of depth, which for me, is perfect and plenty to eventually play with.  Definitely not ‚Äúzero.‚Äù  But I think some surgeons are closer to ‚Äúzero-ish.‚Äù

They kept it very well controlled with medications, so not bad at all.

I&#39;m 7 months out from zero depth surgery in the UK. Very happy with results, aesthetically and sensation wise. Everything nearly healed now, just some minor residual swelling and soreness to go - but they did say it takes 12-18 months to heal completely.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so you&#39;re not dilating when you&#39;re recovering which is a major plus but recovery is still hard in those first two / three weeks and you&#39;ll want some help on hand as you can&#39;t carry anything heavy and will be shuffling around and having trouble sitting comfortably. I also had a catheter in for two weeks post surgery which wasn&#39;t the most pleasant thing - but whether you have that depends on your surgeon really and urethral swelling post surgery.
</p>
<p>
But now at 7 months it&#39;s a totally no maintenance thing and has completely cured any dysphoria down there.
</p>
<p>
The major thing to say to anyone considering this is make sure you are really sure it&#39;s for you before deciding. If there&#39;s any chance you might want penetrative sex afterwards either wait or go for full surgery.
</p>
<p>
But, yeah, I&#39;m one happy girl üòÅ

When you get out of surgery, do you have all the intense wrapping + blood draining tubes and packs in place too? I only have regular vaginoplasty videos to reference haha.
</p>
<p>
But I‚Äôm really happy for you!!

You&#39;ve got all the drains, catheter plus lots of dressings but no packing as there&#39;s nothing really to pack. You&#39;ve still got the awkward two days in a hospital bed on your back with hardly any moving, which is surprisingly painful - the pressure on your back - but once you can sit up and they let you out of bed the worst is over. They&#39;ll show you how to clean everything for the first 6 weeks or so whilst wounds are healing. That&#39;s the trickiest bit with swelling at the start but lying on your back with a mirror, wipes and hibbiscrub you soon get used to it.
</p>
<p>
Once your wounds are healed and your surgeon signs you off as okay at about 4-6 weeks that&#39;s it pretty much, no more maintenance, just waiting for things to heal and swelling to go down. It will feel like a really tight, uncomfortable tuck for about the first three months but after that it&#39;s fine.
</p>
<p>
Clitoris was fully working and up to speed with my partner at about 8 weeks but YMMV with that and your surgeon.
</p>
<p>
This is all from a UK point of view. I don&#39;t know if the process is much different elsewhere.

Oh yeah, I was a bit of a bleeder for the first 3-4 weeks so making sure you&#39;ve got a supply of sanitary towels in place before surgery is good.

Did either of you get intense nerve pain? I‚Äôve seen YouTubers wake up crying in the middle of the night.

I&#39;ve had the nerve reconnecting pains. They are pretty intense but they don&#39;t last longer than 10-15 seconds. I had a batch yesterday but they were the first in about 10 days and they&#39;re pretty infrequent now at 7 months. I&#39;ve got a pretty high pain threshold so ymmv!

I haven&#39;t had it but I&#39;m also considering. I understand recovery is quite a bit easier, obviously no dilating, and there&#39;s no hair removal needed as surgery prep.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s so very hard to predict which road has the least regret.
