I’m having a consultation with Dr. Rumer (Pennsylvania) soon. I had been looking deeper into reviews recently to make sure she was the right choice. Now I’m starting to reconsider! Anyone know any recent info on her? Also what red flags should I be looking for in my surgeon? Thanks.

Cancel it immediately. You can tell her Hannah Simpson convinced you if you like.
</p>
<p>
hannahsimpson.com/surgery is my own site, it speaks for itself.
</p>
<p>
And also check out
<a href="https://rumersanonymous.blogspot.com">https://rumersanonymous.blogspot.com
</a>
because it’s full of others peoples’ experiences as bad or worse. She is dealing with multiple lawsuits currently and I’m not even a party in any of them.
</p>
<p>
Besides her poor technique, what was most deplorable was that she gaslit me saying things looked good when they clearly didn’t, and she blamed me for complications that could not possibly have been my fault. I have emails to back this up. She tried to sell me on a free tummy tuck procedure when she realized she wasn’t going to easily be able to fix my vagina.
</p>
<p>
Marci Bowers ended up working on me later and made things even worse, in no small part due to how badly it was screwed up first which she only realized upon opening me up again, but my site clearly distinguishes what it looked like prior to that and then after.
</p>
<p>
Cancel. Reschedule with someone else. Nothing is worth the experience of constant torture I have had the last six years and the coming to terms with the reality it will likely NEVER actually function or look properly for the rest of my life. Please please please do not go through with it. I don’t know you, but I cannot wish this on anyone.

I heard your story and it made me feel terrible. If we lived in a good world she would be prisoned as some form of poetic justice for the surgery she did on you. I’m sending you best wishes.

I have not been to Dr. Rumer myself, but a close friend had her BA and SRS done by her. Neither procedure went well. Over two years out she has not regained sensation in her breasts. Also, she had some necrosis of the neovaginal lining, extensive scarring and granulated tissue, and urinary stream issues, resulting from her bottom surgery. She just had a revision done by a different surgeon closer to home and her urine stream is better and she&#39;s able to dialate better as well.

I&#39;ve seen a few posts here saying &#34;Rumer is the only person my insurance will cover&#34; and tbqh I suspect that&#39;s the main reason why she&#39;s still in business. Every SRS surgeon has bad outcomes and/or naysayers, but Rumer seems to have more than the rest of the them combined. I would stay away.

Yep. I was someone who posted that recently. In PA, and she’s my only option. Going out of network, but of course, that’s indefinitely delayed now.

I would look here, if you haven&#39;t already:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_kathy_lynn_rumer">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_kathy_lynn_rumer
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
If you just search this subreddit for Kathy Rumer, you will get a lot of relevant information. My personal opinion is that she has had far too many really bad outcomes to justify risking it. It&#39;s like Russian roulette with her.

She is the one surgeon I would never, ever got to.
</p>
<p>
There have been a few curious posts in the past from new accounts who had glowing reviews of her. I suspect those were just astroturfing.
</p>
<p>
Any account from a reputable source would tell you to RUN!

I had my facial feminization and breast augmentation done with Dr. O&#39;Brien-Coon (in two stages). I&#39;m actually recovering from the second stage, so I haven&#39;t posted a full write-up and pics yet. However, I definitely would say he&#39;s a solid choice. DM me if you have questions.

The most polite thing you can say about Dr. Rumer is that based upon her track record, there is a higher probability that choosing her
<em>
can
</em>
lead to an unfavorable outcome.
</p>
<p>
To put it bluntly, the odds are higher that she&#39;ll fuck things up and wash her hands of you. Based upon reports.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not risk-averse myself but this is my
<strong>
body
</strong>

FTM here so take this how it applies. I had a 15 min consult with Dr.Rumer at the Philly Health Conference about two years ago. Let it be said that I have done a ton of research and I am well versed in the concepts on multiple techniques for phalloplasty and metaoplasty(I misspelled that...I know...). The method I want to go to use is the Ab-flap. Dr.Rumer stated that urethral lengthening is not possible with Ab-flap. Fundamentally, this is not true because Dr.Meltzer has been doing this for years. The fact of the matter is Dr.Rumer is not able to do this so she is saying that it cannot be done. Also, in her 2018 presentation she used pictures of Dr.Cranes/Dr.Chen results for their phalloplasty. When call out she tries to ignore it. She is an out and out liar and preys on the ignorance of others.
</p>
<p>
I was talking to a group of ftms and one of them told me about a guy that went with Dr.Rumer. When she found out his  insurance would not pay for a few extra days in recovery she sent him home after lower surgery. The man was driving by himself to get home. He started bleeding and passed out on the side of the road. He damn near died. I would never truth Dr.Rumer with my body or anyone else&#39;s for that matter.
</p>
<p>
When looking for a surgeon consider a few things....what methods do they offer? Why? You need to know what method you want to go with and why this is the case. How is this Doctor doing it differently than another? What are the results? How many years will it take? What portion of the surgeon will be harder than others? How does the Doctor stage their surgeries? Why? Are there any things you want to avoid? How will this impact my results and my body farther down the line?
</p>
<p>
I will use myself as an example. When I was searching for a top surgeon I considered what I wanted. I wanted a male chest. Period. End of story. So, I started to look at shirtless men of all sorts to acquire a base line understand of what it actually means to have a &#34;male chest&#34;. Obviously, it seems like a vague question but the general understand is that even if you have gynecomastia your nipples will tend to be placed farther out (as well as a few other thing that I will not mention).Thus giving the chest a boxier look.
</p>
<p>
The next step was looking at the results of as many ftm&#39;s I could. I talk to as many people as I could about any subject and of course I was appreciative to them. In my case I found Dr.Sassani of Plantation Florida via an acquaintance that was honest with me. I consulted with Dr.Sassani and looked at his results. At the time he had not done too surgery for a transman yet however his work on cis people spoke for itself. Due to the fact that I had a clear base line idea of what a male chest looks like and what good top surgery looked like I could extrapolate what the possibility could be with Dr.S. There is still the risk but he said that if we had any issues or if I needed reconstruction that all I would have to pay are the taxes for surgery but not the full costs. Keep in mind that Dr.Garromone (the current holy hope of top surgery) would have demanded that I pay full price for 2nd surgery(1 top surgery with the removal of 1000 cc of fat is about $7KUSD +/- in 2015. A second round of surgery would put you at $14K USD not including the cost of travel and not being in work).
</p>
<p>
In 2015 Dr.Sassani charged $6K USD and if I did have to go back it would have costed me less than $1K USD. If we consider only pricing then we will miss the important part of the lesson. I trusted Dr.S with my body because of his honesty and straight forward approach. He did not try to con me or change my mind. He asked me what I wanted once he understood that I was educated enough on the subject of my top surgery to have a conversation. So, he respected my intelligence. Also, he took on of my suggestion. Because of my size I was going to have to have a double incision with nipple resizing and reattachement. Scars were the least of my worries because I care very little what people think and my body does not scar as  intensely other might. So, I requested that Dr.S push my scars farther back(make the scars longer) because I wanted to avoid &#34;dog earring&#34;(which means that  excess fat left behind after top surgery is pressed down by the arms and causes pain due to the pinch/pressure from the arms. One way that people stop this is by wearing a binder but seeing as I was trying to avoid binding all together it would not make sense to ignore this key spot).
</p>
<p>
If you are still with me then good for you. 😅 I know this was long but I am trying to express the method that has kept me in good stead and has led me to find the correct top/lower surgeon for myself. I hope this helps you and others. Please let me know if you have any questions. The key is to understand what you want and seek out the persons that can give you this without deception. All Doctors are not created equal. Some are just out here for money and will try to make you think you are crazy for wanting quality.  Best of luck.😊

Stay away like the plague.  My friend went to them and had nothing but an absolute nightmare of an experience.  Should not be practicing medicine.  Terrible bedside manner, terrible quality of work, terrible followup, etc.  Really may be the worst surgeon doing GAS surgeries.

NOOOOOOOOOOO. Please! 3 years of complications. I should have had revision (with another team of doctors) but it&#39;s been delayed due to COVID-19. I agree with Hannah. My life has been hell.

Dr. Christine McGinn is also in PA, and probably has as much experience, number of vaginoplasty surgeries completed, etc, as Dr. Marci Bowers and Dr. Pierre Brassard. Quality of results seems consistently very decent, and her vast experience means she&#39;s got to know by now how to recognize potential problem areas that can lead to increased probability of complications before she ever begins carving on a patient and whether there exist workarounds or alternate steps to avoid some types of complications she&#39;s gained experience dealing with... and hopefully also the judgement to flat outright tell if a particular patient has some unusual conditions or circumstances that are likely to end up giving poor results/outcome/recovery and bluntly tell them the bad news up front if their surgery is gonna give crap results because of limiting factors that are just inherent in that patient and are discoverable at initial consultation, pre-surgery physical examination or discovered via pelvic ultrasound imaging scan which this day and age, ought to be a mandatory part of every MtF vaginoplasty initial consultation physical exam to help ensure the patient doesn&#39;t have some unusual conditions that&#39;s going to cause big problems later, like an undetected tumor, deformities or damage to the rectum, presence of retained Muellerian duct structures, or (yes it has happened) a complete or partial uterus and possibly also fallopian tubes in an infantile unmatured state.... or possibly even matured to some degree. A man in the UK underwent a hysterectomy after it was discovered he was having menstrual periods with no adequate exit path since he also had a functional penis and testes, and upon examination for possible bladder cancer causing him to have abdominal pain and blood in urine, was discovered having a uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries internally. The news stories were written by idiot reporters saying he probably had &#34;persistant Muellerian duct syndrome&#34; which is uneducated b.s. from hasty Googling of medical science terms to fill out a news story snd try to sound smart to the dumb masses... PMDS is something entirely different, but it&#39;s smart to screen for that possibility via imaging prior to GRS. The person in England who gender-identified as a &#34;regular bloke&#34; but persued a hysterectomy is actually an XX/XY chimera... the result of merged fraternal twin brother and sister zygotes shortly after conception, and via the roll of the embryonic stem cell dice, ended up with duplication of development of fetal genital tubercle tissue, the internal portion of one sufficiently composed of XX dna cells and hormonally insulated from the XY portion sufficiency enough to not end up masculinizing from the DHT to continue its default development path of becoming the gonadal and internet functional parts of a female reproductive system while the XY portion developed into a complete male reproductive system, both gonadal and exterior genital sets of parts. Medically speaking a &#34;True Hetmaphrodite&#34; (which only means both ovarian and testicular tissue in the same body, and does not mean both kinds of completely developed genitalia, which  never occurs anyway.... but damn.... he was just one set of genitalia structures short of being an actual Futanari! I don&#39;t think all of medical science has ever recorded a case of true natural occurrence of fully developed genitalia of both male and female types in the same person.... the gonadal subset of the dual reproductive systems, yes that&#39;s in the books, the UK person is not the first by a long shot, and XX/XY chimerism is the cause of that. My doctor discovered I&#39;m an XX/XY chimera too, I have not had any ultrasound, MRI, etc, imaging done to see if I have any extra parts inside, and I&#39;ve not had a history of symptoms to suggest that such is likely either. All I basically (theoretically) got from my chimerism, is central heterochromia and a rapid eye color change in the first 30 days of HRT, a female shaped pelvis and hip curves, soft youthful feminine facial skin (but grows facial hair like a damn werewolf so it&#39;s pure hell to shave the barbed wire facial hair off the soft skin Aarrggh!) and central nervous system that&#39;s about 70% XX cells and 30% XY cells, an infertile male external reproductive system, a Y-branched urethra that was surgically &#39;corrected&#39; shortly after birth,  and if it is discovered that I&#39;ve got extra parts inside like the person in the UK.... then by god, I want them all hooked up if possible when I get my GRS. Supposedly exactly that has been discovered, and accomplished, in one transwoman undergoing GRS by a surgeon somewhere in the USA back around 2016-2017 but all mention of it has been scrubbed off the web for the patient&#39;s privacy.
