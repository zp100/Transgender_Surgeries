My first surgeon does robotic PPT revisions and this other surgeon does skin graft from cadavers for width and depth revisions. Do people have opinions strongly one way or the other on which route I should go? PPT would be 8 months off, the skin graft could be taken care of in two months. Would one produce more feeling and sensation in the canal? Would one be a harder recovery? I believe I’d still have to dilate with both so there is no advantage in terms of that. What are everyone’s thoughts?

For me a graft from a cadaver sounds dubious.
</p>
<p>
Idk, I never heard of that option before.

I know for sure i would choose PPT rather than skin off a dead body.
</p>
<p>
If it was a donor vagina though i would seriously consider it but i would want a few other people to have it done before i would try it. Knowing my luck it would go wrong and screw it up for others who want it done after i died or something.

Yeah, I should probably wait. It sucks that at day 123 post op I’m non-orgasmic and have little depth and width. I have no pleasurable sense so I’ve wanted to rush to surgery to try to fix anything that can be fixed. I may as well wait. I might never be able to orgasm again anyway. Thank you for your input.

Sounds similar to my experience tbh.
</p>
<p>
A few weeks post op i started trying to climax, failed for a year then i stopped trying at 12 months when i had a revision for function. Only tried a few times since, nothing works.
</p>
<p>
Its been about 6 months since i last tried. That was while we were on our honeymoon for a week. We eventually just decided to not worry about sex and just enjoy being close to eachother.
</p>
<p>
Im guessing mine is useless for penetration now as well, not dilated or douched for a few weeks. Nuts to it.

I regret having the surgery if this is how my life is forever. No depth. No width. My clitoris is under fused skin. My clitoris feels awful, it doesn’t even feel good. It hurts and I can’t orgasm. Labia numb. I wish I could take back the surgery.

Sorry you are going through this. I feel the same.
</p>
<p>
Even if you cannot climax again there are other things in life that can bring pleasure. I know it sounds crap but i have mostly got to the point of not caring now, i miss being able to climax but I&#39;m not going to make it better by kms.
</p>
<p>
I mean this looks awful when i type it but Jedi Survivor is my sex replacement. I kill bucket heads to pass the time, some will timed parys and counters is probably the biggest high i can get lol
</p>
<p>
Oh and a tiramasu, and trifle, and cuddles and kisses mmm yeah there is quite a lot to like still :)
</p>
<p>
I guess the antidepressants help as well ;)

Does your surgeon have any thoughts on why you can’t orgasm?

No but I&#39;m sure it was because i only spent 75 minutes in the OR, he obviously had more important places to be. He damaged other nerves, didn&#39;t cut the spermatic cord correctly on one side and my clitoris is not sensitive at all. I could have done a better job at the stitches as well.
