Be very careful using the bidet - that can be an easy path to infection early on if it gets to any of the unhealed incisions.
</p>
<p>
Overall, looks like you will heal up very nicely though.  Congratulations! üíúüíú

Yeah I know üòñ I have a reach stick coming tomorrow so I don&#39;t have to. In the meantime I&#39;ve just been rinsing it down with a shower head and then following with a wound cleansing  spray and followed with polysporin.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not perfect but I really just have to hope that&#39;s enough until the healing gets further along and the swelling subsides enough to reach easier ya know.
</p>
<p>
Also being careful with my movements and doing everything through my diaphragm as to minimize tension on my stitches so hopefully those staying more true also help.

If I had a partner I&#39;d ask them to white my booty hole ü§£ü§£ü§£

Thank you ü•∞ Trying to take real good care of her in these early days. So we can get to those further other ones easier.
</p>
<p>
Though I&#39;m doing a solo recovery so I am a bit limited in what I can do.

If you don&#39;t mind me asking, how were you able to get GRS so soon after starting HRT? I couldn&#39;t even get an orchi until after 12 months. Just wondering.

WPATH8 the new standard of care went into effect last September. And being that Dr.Ramineni is a member of needless to say he was an early adopter of the new standard.
</p>
<p>
Which for the record, there is no hormone requirement anymore as it was deemed that forcing people to be on them caused consider harm in the instances where cross sex hormones did not align with one&#39;s gender identity.
</p>
<p>
The new standard has made it possible for people with non binary identities to seek medical treatment without having to harm themselves with a hormone that would be incongruent with their gender.
</p>
<p>
I am on estrogen by choice but waiting a year for something I have always felt needed to be changed would have been silly ya know?
</p>
<p>
Also GRS is a dated term, Gender Affirming surgery (GAS) or gender confirmation surgery (GCS) are the new standard in transgender language

Then GCS The idea is that genitals don&#39;t = gender but rather a component that makes up one&#39;s gender experience.
</p>
<p>
And we were already assigned one at birth which we are incongruent to so saying that a doctor is going to assign us a new one because they changed the genitals is incredibly dated stuff. But changing ones genitals can affirm ones gender identity.
</p>
<p>
The language shift allows for greater care to a wider spectrum of people outside of the standard trans experience.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m genderfluid and while alleviating my genital disphoria it will also allow me to further connect to my gender experience in a way a binary trans person couldn&#39;t understand, ya know?

Hahaha why thank you. It&#39;s been going alright. Still not finished yet, hoping I can be finished after this next surgery early next year.
</p>
<p>
However I am looking to go to a different surgeon to finish things.
</p>
<p>
The road hasn&#39;t been tragic, but it&#39;s been a pretty long one.

Hope you reach the end of the road soon in place that you are happy with.

Do you still recommend Dr. Ramineni overall?

Well think what it means to reach behind you...but instead do that in front.
</p>
<p>
Normally I&#39;d stand a Lil reach to the front, get to the hole and like do button whipes (not whipping forward or backwards) but since my whole underside is stitched up and swollen I have less clearance than when I had my sac in the way.
