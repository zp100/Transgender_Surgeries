Besides the obvious, lol
</p>
<p>
Did it change your mood?  The way you perceived the rest of your body? Was it more maintenance than you anticipated?  Did it make you feel more vulnerable?
</p>
<p>
And any other details you noticed differently :)

Hmm, I found that that had already left for me after ffs, and downstairs is just so annoying and clashes tremendously.
</p>
<p>
But when it&#39;s not in use, I never even think about it.
</p>
<p>
Thank you!

Y&#39;know I do feel more vulnerable, but at the same time I also just feel so much more free. It&#39;s about the amount of maintenance I expected. I actually enjoy sexual experiences now, and can finish with another person (I could only ever finish via masturbation before surgery). Wearing clothes that actually fit makes me a lot happier as well. I&#39;m less ashamed of going to public restrooms as well.

thank you so much for sharing!!  except for a couple of times years ago, I haven&#39;t been able to finish with a partner (and even in those exceptions it took a lot of mental gymnastics, and I think I was more relieved that it was over and I&#39;d validated/satisfied that desire for my partner than anything else) without masturbating.  I know everyone&#39;s different, but so glad to hear things have gotten better for you (and not just the sex)!!! ‚ù§

Omg i feel this so much, im stil Pre-OP but i never finish with a bedpartner unless i mastrubate and it takes a fuckload of mental gymnastics and time to get myself there. I&#39;m happy i read that i&#39;m not the only one who has this. It&#39;s so frustrating and i cant wait to get SRS done but thats stil fking 4-5 hears away üò£ It feels so long away and everytime im reminder of this or search more info on vaginaplasty i start to cry abit. I also dont get why most surgeons are stil working with Penile inversion even tho there is newer and more improved techniques out :(

I noticed lots of things!
</p>
<p>
Immediately after the surgery, I noticed that my brain was quieter - a buzzing sense that I had
<em>
always
</em>
had in the back of it was now gone, and hasn‚Äôt returned since. I‚Äôve realized that my brain had been always irritated because it was getting the wrong signals (from the wrong parts), and now that the right signals were coming in, the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù was gone.
</p>
<p>
More generally, I‚Äôve felt more relaxed, more comfortable in my body, and more confident in myself. I‚Äôve felt more
<em>
me
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
About 3-4 months after surgery, I had a period of about 7-8 days where I had gender euphoria throughout the entire period - that was amazing, and a total trip! I‚Äôd had moments of euphoria before, but to have it sustained for days at a time was completely new to me, and felt so good!
</p>
<p>
I wouldn‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs changed how I perceive the rest of my body, but it has changed my base level of dysphoria, so that I‚Äôm better able to deal with dysphoria I feel about other parts of my body. I don‚Äôt have to spend energy on bottom dysphoria anymore (I haven‚Äôt had any bottom dysphoria since surgery), so I can spend that energy elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
The maintenance has required adjustment, but it hasn‚Äôt bothered me. I appreciate the built-in breaks that dilation forces me to take - I use that to read, to catch up on shows, to write, to converse with friends; to do things that I might otherwise neglect or not prioritize enough. Now that I‚Äôm 18 months post, I don‚Äôt have to do as much maintenance, and I kind of miss the enforced downtime.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt necessarily feel more vulnerable in general, but when i see/hear stories of sexual assault/rape, I have a much more visceral sense of the violation of those horrible acts than I‚Äôd had before. I know what being penetrated in that way would feel like, and the sense of violation is much more tangible. But I‚Äôm a rather large woman (tall and large frame, not necessarily overweight), so I have less of a target on my back from those who target vulnerable women.
</p>
<p>
Other things I‚Äôve noticed: -The way I walk and carry my body has changed. I can‚Äôt say whether that‚Äôs psychological or physiological, but I kinda believe it‚Äôs the latter - the change in anatomy has changed my proprioception, and I don‚Äôt have to maintain the same awareness of the parts that used to be there before. I‚Äôve noticed that my pelvic tilt has increased post-op. - Instead of going to bed every night wishing for the right body, I now go to bed every night thankful for having the right body. My last thought going to sleep and first thought waking up is very often ‚ÄúüòÄI have a vagina!üòÄ‚Äù - while I‚Äôm not 100% confident in bathrooms, my confidence has increased significantly. If challenged, I wouldn‚Äôt use my anatomy to justify my presence in that bathroom because I fully support my sisters who haven‚Äôt yet or won‚Äôt ever have surgery - my right to use the women‚Äôs restroom doesn‚Äôt come from my anatomy, but from my gender, which has nothing to do with my anatomy. But regardless, knowing that my body is in better alignment with my gender gives me more confidence. I‚Äôm a bit conflicted on
<em>
why
</em>
it gives me confidence in the restrooms, but considering how horrible I used to feel, I‚Äôm not going to dwell too much on that.
</p>
<p>
In summary, for me, things have only gotten better since I had my surgery. It is the best gift I‚Äôve ever given myself.

Very helpful, seems like a major source of stress is gone.  I&#39;ll admit, I take at least 2-4 extra bathroom trips just bc I&#39;m paranoid my tuck is loose.
</p>
<p>
That mirrors a lot of what I felt after ffs.  Thanks

Not TMI

<p>
I never let my bf&#39;s even see it.  I was a little more ok on my own, but always annoyed.
</p>
<p>
As far as pleasure goes, it&#39;s a hassle.  I can imagine how great it is for that to be gone, but not how great the feeling of actual pleasure is.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also hella worried if I&#39;ll be any good, lol

I cry more easily, which is unexpected.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still in recovery mode, so I&#39;m unable to live a &#34;normal&#34; life, but I&#39;m already so happy I don&#39;t have to tuck :)
</p>
<p>
Peeing is a significant downgrade in the overall experience, but that was expected from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
I feel much more &#34;included&#34; among cis women for some reason. Real or not, that&#39;s how I feel.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t like the numbness, though a bunch of that is going away thankfully. It creates a feeling of separation from my own body that I don&#39;t care for.
</p>
<p>
Staying clean is so annoying while things are still healing. I got a UTI early on, and that was not fun at all. It was worse than any of the actual surgical pain (which, that part was honestly not bad).
</p>
<p>
I cried when I saw myself in the mirror for the first time. It looked like me. :)

Peeing is a downgrade, bc of sitting? Bc I haven&#39;t stood in a decade, how else does it change?  The spray vs stream?

Wow, so happy you got to feel that way!  They might have to hold me down when I see myself bc I&#39;ll probably want to dance on the fucking table :)

Its more like the wiping. Everyone is a little different but the quality of TP that you have to buy generally goes up after SRS. I get triple ply super soft now, otherwise it feels like tissue paper or sandpaper.

The urethra is way shorter so its not like the options are just &#34;steam or spray.&#34; Sometimes it gets all over everything, I hate having to wipe all that lol.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, I miss not having the option to pee without removing all my clothes lol. Nothing wrong with missing convenience, far as I&#39;m concerned :)
</p>
<p>
And thank you! I promise you&#39;ll have to wait to actually dance, but yes that is the feeling :)

Oh I know. It&#39;s annoying, but not so annoying that I want to carry something around that I have to clean afterwards :P

Can&#39;t really use those outside the house. Can&#39;t imagine you would want to carry a one funnel in your purse after its been used once.

You could use a sealed plastic bag for keeping it in a purse, or if the bathroom aint busy then wash it in the sink w/ soap and water.

Mostly to clarify for others who may be lurking and curious: it&#39;s not the splash from the bowl--it&#39;s the liquid being sometimes unable to overcome adhesion to the skin after leaving the urethra, so it runs along the skin until it finally falls into the bowl.

I didnt make that comment but ive had the same experience so maybe my answer will help. I dont think it has anything to do with cis women behaving any different towards me. If they do, its because i let myself feel included to begin with and they respond accordingly.  The difference has nevertheless been significant. I dont know if its simply symbolic but navigating the world feels different with vs. without external genitals. It almost feels like it has nothing to do with womanhood vs. manhood, but literally just where your genitals are relative to the world. And then, the specifics of this difference are experienced by cis women and not pre op trans women

It&#39;s not really a concrete perception, but rather an emotional one I think. I feel less like a foreigner, I guess? Might be entirely self-fabricated

I feel better and more in peace, the dysphoria from my pee-pee made me distance myself from my body and afterwards it was just easier to cope with how my body looked in general. It‚Äòs also very affirming to have a vagina, like the sexy stuff and everything. Would recommend 10 out of 10. The only hard thing about it was the long stay in the hospital and correction surgeries.

How long were you in for, and did you have a complication or were they aesthetic revisions?

My case is rather unusual: was in the hospital for 21 days because I lost a ton of blood (honestly I thought I would die), had my first emergency revision, couldn‚Äòt pee afterwards and ran around with a catheter for a while. Had a major revision for aesthetic and the peeing thing, then 2 years later two surgeries for peeing again and 2016 one for hygienic reason. Last and hopefully final surgery was last year and now I‚Äòm pretty happy functionality wise. Aesthetically it‚Äòs okay.

I‚Äôm only five weeks but the amount I‚Äôve cried has been so much (I‚Äôve always been emotional but still).
</p>
<p>
I cried when I left the hospital and arrived at my aunts house for about two days because of the change in scenery and loss of security and then a cried for about two days when I left my aunts house and went home for the same reason.
</p>
<p>
The vulnerability I felt was beyond what I felt before.

I can&#39;t give a complete opinion since I&#39;m only a week and a half post-op. However, I can say I&#39;ve realized I&#39;m already being much more assertive. Shame is gone and feel much more like myself. I feel complete most of all.

When I saw an old picture of me naked pre-op, I immediately sensed how alien and weird it looked on me, and how looking at myself in the mirror now, I see me. Before the surgery, I was concerned about post-op depression, but I ended up incredibly thankful and feeling blessed. It feels 100% right.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m about 6 months out, and yeah, still sore, but then again, I&#39;m still recovering and not cleared for things like sexual activity though I feel more sexually confident than I ever had before. Putting on a bikini/skirt/shorts/pants is so wonderful now, and feels more natural.

Oh my goodness this hits so close to home for me! Having clothes fit properly is such a dysphoric causing thing for me! I can&#39;t wait for that feeling. Dr. Tings office is number one on my possibilities. How was your experience overall with Dr. Avanassian? She&#39;s been recommended to me by a couple others already.

Personally, she was the perfect surgeon for my needs. She&#39;s responsive and personable, and her work is great. I trust her completely under her care. I am planning to have a FFS consultation with her later on.

Sorry you&#39;re not cleared yet, I thought 3 months was the standard wait time for sex, did something happen?  If it&#39;s not something you want to share, nevermind, and hope everything works out :)

No, my surgeon Dr. Avanassian at Mt. Siani is just conservative in her approach to post-op recovery. In any case, at 3 months it&#39;s the bare minimum of recovery. It&#39;s still not pleasent down there since it is sore and issues like blood, granulation, weak bladder, swelling, and discharge are common. I&#39;m honestly shocked when I hear some people say they have sex/try to orgasm asap. Like, it gets legit nasty down there.

Definitely lifted away a bunch of dysphoria. It is also nice to have clothes fitting properly without having to tuck or tape. Just feels normal honestly.

These comments have been informative for myself , who has been on the fence for five years. I am post op orchi (3yrs prior) but my love for outdoor activities has kept me from completing my journey.  But deciding on a surgeon Isa big choice too. The final self affirmation I&#39;m looking for but so much to sort out. Thanks
