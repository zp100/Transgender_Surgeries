Hi everyone! Reddit is dumb and doesn&#39;t make it easy to put a text post combined with images so I&#39;ll just leave this as a comment.
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;ve been having some tightness issues ever since surgery. I can use the purple dilator (soul source, hard plastic ones) but not much beyond that. I&#39;m planning to do a revision to address that and as part of that, my surgeon wanted to do an MRI so he could see what was going on in the deep parts (since he can&#39;t see back there any other way right now).
</p>
<p>
The radiologist staff were all super interested in what it would look like, as was I. And I figured you all might be too! So I got a copy of the data.
</p>
<p>
What I&#39;ve included in the post so far are some of the slides I thought were interesting. But also I&#39;ve got all the raw data. If I can figure out some place to host it, I&#39;d be happy to share it freely. If anyone has any ideas there please let me know!
</p>

The radiologist said it looks pretty similar to a home grown one. He said about the only thing he noticed was (besides the lack of anything north of the canal, and a prostate) that my canal collapses into a slightly different shape (like axially, kinda hard to explain TBH)
</p>
<p>
They were also super duper curious. So after I assured them they could ask me whatever questions they wanted, me and like 5 people from the staff all crammed into the radiologists picture room, and I explained sorta how the surgery works, the areas I’m having problems with etc. They were all super nice!

Can you elaborate on what a normal vagina&#39;s shape is supposed to be?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m about 1 year post op and I&#39;m having some mild difficulty dilating-- I guess have depth and width just fine, it just takes me a long time to get there.
</p>
<p>
Anyways when I dilate, after about 30 minutes of dilating, I can palpably feel the dilator start impacting the tailbone.  I can strike the dilator against my tailbone and there&#39;s this resounding bony thump to it, lol.  I always thought that was a little odd, I could be wrong but I think cis-women have vaginas that don&#39;t curve as far towards the back, right?  I would&#39;ve figured that for cis women the vagina goes more straight-upwards into the abdomen, instead of curving backwards towards the tailbone.
</p>
<p>
I noticed in the MRI scan it looks like your vagina goes up towards the tailbone as well.  Is this what the radiologists mean when they say your canal collapses into a different shape axially?

No the shape thing he was talking about is how the canal “squeezes” closed when unoccupied. He said a home grown vagina closes into a shape that looks like )-( when viewed from the top, but mine looks more like ( rotated 90 degrees. It’s kinda hard to explain without pictures
</p>
<p>
As for angle of the vagina, yes I’m pretty sure that’s different as well but he didn’t seem to notice that in the scan.

Oh ty, that&#39;s very interesting.
</p>
<p>
I googled around for MRI images of cis women of the same area, I only found this (most I found on google seemed to be examples with tumors which isn&#39;t super helpful)
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Normal-female-pelvis-Axial-A-and-sagittal-B-MRI-T2-weighted-images-showing-anterior_fig2_281461139">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Normal-female-pelvis-Axial-A-and-sagittal-B-MRI-T2-weighted-images-showing-anterior_fig2_281461139</a>
</p>
<p>
From this image and from the casts, it looks like a somewhat backwards angle isn&#39;t entirely unprecedented, but the cis canal seems to be able to keep itself open a lot better (at least compared to OP), and seems to have an internal hollow-&#34;bulb&#34; like shape

In your link, it says the vagina is “distended with gel” so I think that means basically they ‘injected’ it with a gel substance to be able to get a picture of the whole thing better. Usually it would be more similar to OP’s pics than these ones.

Since there’s nothing holding a vagina open, they will all be squished flat by the surrounding organs and thus look like OPs image. Just the direction by which they are squashed flat will vary (though this also depends on how full the bladder and rectum are)
</p>
<p>
Basically the vaginal canal can be pushed flat between bladder and rectum, or it‘s pushed flat from the sides.
</p>
<p>
But again, it depends on how full bladder and rectum are, because those guide the vagina to be flat between them when full, as the vagina is rather squishable.

so basically, how the cabal gets squished flat is different between cis and post op trans women, is that the takeaway here?  curious as to how if yes.

I can answer this, hope it’s ok for me to comment. I’m a cis woman (for some reason this post was recommended to me, I’m not really sure why tbh lol but I too am fascinated by the pics, I don’t think I’ve ever seen an MRI or a “home grown” vagina either!)
</p>
<p>
The vagina (and anus) is usually tilted somewhat towards your back, with some variation based on each persons anatomy. I personally have what was described by a dr as a ‘tilted uterus’ so mine actually has the normal backwards tilt, along with being angled slightly to the left! (Which explains why it was always so hard for me to put tampons in before I discovered this lol!).
</p>
<p>
Although I don’t think that you should be hitting your tail bone! I hope that’s not painful for you! That does not sound fun. This could be due to yours having an exaggerated angle, or maybe your tail bone curves more than most, but I would definitely ask your surgeon about this. Unfortunately this is where my knowledge ends because im not too familiar with trans surgeries, (besides a bit that was described to me by one of my trans friends) but I hope you are able to find out more about this.

I told my surgeon, she had no comments about it.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not painful or anything, don&#39;t worry.  When i feel the dilator is going up against something bony, that&#39;s my cue that I&#39;m not getting any more depth lol

That’s terrific. I mean, I’m sorry you’re having issues. But I love that the medical staff asked you for permission and showed a genuine interest in trans medicine. You may have been someone’s inspiration to be an ally.

Mfw looking up cis women with similar MRIs and it looks so similar.  Like only missing things is the other tidbits internally.  It’s crazy it that close.

Yea if you compare this with a post total hysterectomy, Ie. Hysterectomy + Trachelectomy where the cervix is also removed, it‘s virtually identical, if you don‘t notice the prostate, which would be easy to muss because it‘s quite a bit smaller than in men as well as less ‚dense‘ so lower contrast to surrounding areas.

I did 2 mrni becouse complications One at 14 data and the other at like 2 months . Look like exactily like me . Shaped tight Canal but my prostate Is Little compared to your like 1/3 .  I have issue dilating too . It&#39;s too tight and despite the 15 cm of depht i cannot dilate fully . It&#39;s a Crazy pain and also went for a revision so they stretched the vag Canal . Sound like this helped but i cannot go up to 30 mm . I also didn&#39;t find a good Lube ,tried tons but they didn&#39;t glide or they Will dry inside and the dilator get stucked .

I’m sorry to hear that. I’ve got similar issues and totally understand the frustration. I have found a lube I like though, Sliquid Sassy. I’m hoping the revision I do will help, I’m going to try working with a pelvic PT too

MRIs are interesting. I&#39;ve never actually seen a neovagina MRI before, so this is definitely interesting. Is it like a lateral X-ray or something? Like a cross section?

For the pictures I posted yes, this is like a side cross-section.
</p>
<p>
I actually have data for 3 different planes (left to right, top to bottom, forward to backwards). But this angle seemed the most interesting in still images. The other views do look interesting when you can scroll through them. I&#39;m going to try and find some way of hosting that raw data so others can look at it.

I went to Dr. Selph when he was still at UAB in Birmingham Alabama (he&#39;s since moved to Nashville). I had surgery in June 2020, so it&#39;s been 3 years and a few months.

<p>
I&#39;ve got some more details too on my earlier posts:

This is really cool. I can’t believe I’ve never considered this before, but does the proximity to your prostate result in stimulation of the prostate from penetration?

Remarkable views. An image with your max size dilator fully inserted would have been useful I think.
