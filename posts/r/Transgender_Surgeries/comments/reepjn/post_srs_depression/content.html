I had SRS Vaginoplasty 4 weeks ago and feel really low.
</p>
<p>
It was my first time in hospital and I found the whole process traumatising. I cried myself to sleep every night in hospital until they gave me sleeping tablets. The pain was unbearable and nothing stronger than over the counter paracetamol and ibuprofen. My partner was with me every day and did her best to help calm me down but I had several panic attacks throughout the week I was there (I had only had one prior to this).
</p>
<p>
I thought when I got home and back on E I would start feeling better, it has helped and I&#39;m much more comfortable now the GP has given me Tramadol and Amitriptyline but I&#39;m still on the verge of crying several times a day. I have no energy and what I do have is spent trying to put on a brave face for the rest of the family.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m having some serious thoughts that this wasn&#39;t a good idea. I don&#39;t miss the old parts at all I&#39;m just meh about the new mess that&#39;s there instead. Going to the toilet is enough to start tearing up and I constantly feel pathetic and useless. I can hardly do anything for myself without being in pain.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s now 2am and I&#39;m laying next to my partner who is fast asleep and I&#39;m trying not to cry so I don&#39;t wake her up. Relishing the thought of going to the toilet in an hour and pulling all the sticky bits of the wound apart when I get out of bed.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m fed up of hearing about all the girls that have no pain and are running 5k,  having multiple orgasm&#39;s, and getting back to their normal routine a month after leaving hospital. It&#39;s not helping.
</p>
<p>
Someone please tell me if gets better ?

The post-op depression can be pretty rough. 💜🤗
</p>
<p>
I talked with my sister when I was going through mine and she likened it to postpartum depression that some new moms go through. It makes sense given that our surgery and recovery is akin (not equivalent) to that experience. Also it took me a 6 weeks to get the strength to walk/stand for more than 30 minutes at a time.
</p>
<p>
As for the pain full spectrum CBD helped more than the opioids I was prescribed.
</p>
<p>
...I know it&#39;s rough now but it does get better.

Thankyou that&#39;s a really good idea. I should speak to my sister. She has just qualified as a mental health nurse / retrained after our brother committed suicide. She is my little sister though and really proud of me going through all this crap. I don&#39;t want to let her down by appearing week, or meh I don&#39;t know.
</p>
<p>
Thankyou though x

There is no shame in knowing you&#39;re own limits with mental health. Sometimes you just need a shoulder to cry on that&#39;s perfectly fine.

If someone with a broken arm asked you for help, would you think they&#39;re weak? Of course not. You shouldn&#39;t be ashamed of something you need.

Everything will be alright, sending good vibes &lt;3

If your sister has dedicated her specialization to serve in exactly the capacity you seem to most need in this moment, I would think she&#39;d be, more than anything, furious at you for not asking her help.

How was your surgeon with walking/standing? Mine already had me standing briefly the day after surgery, which was super scary but I think that was ultimately a really good thing.

I unfortunately had Rumer. So it was 3 day mandatory best bed rest...and a lot of gaslighting with my initial recovery. I pretty much had to figure out everything on my own.

Hi, did you wrote your experience? I did mine, and yours seems relatable to me. I was undoubtedly Gaslighted, ghosted &amp; mistreated by my surgeon dr Belinky un Argentina. It&#39;s on the wiki now. Check my profile to look my post!

Dr Rumer has a nasty habit of harassment and suing her patients that give any form of public criticism. So no, i have not posted about my experience.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry for what you went through. Surgeon need to be held accountable for their work

Hey sweets, I’m 4 years post and baby I remember that all too well…..your body just went through a very traumatic operation and your brain is still processing healing, pain and your mind is catching up with the fact that you accomplished a major goal. For me 4 years later I’m still not 100% over it lol
</p>
<p>
It gets better my dear.

Yo what?  Is no one going to address this?
</p>
<p>
This is
<em>
extremely
</em>
fucked up.  The first 4 days I was given a morphine drip which I used
<em>
very
</em>
liberally, and once released from hospital I was given a prescription for oxycodone.  I know opioid painkillers have their risks, but you just had your genitals turned inside out, if there any use case for opioid, this is fucking it.
</p>
<p>
I cannot believe that your surgeon and the hospital would be so neglectful as to refuse adequate analgesics.  If you&#39;re in pain (I know I still was at 4 weeks), get in contact and ask for pain relief.  This is disgusting.

The first 6 ish hours paralysed from the waist down so I couldn&#39;t feel anything. When that wore off I had the first panic attack so they injected me with something and put me on a morphene PCA for 12 hours. It ran out in the morning just before the pressure bandage was unceremoniously ripped off while I was still half asleep. Had a crying fit and was just left there for 30 minutes in agony until I found the nurse call fob. The nurse was really nice though, managed to calm me down and put my oxygen thing back on and put paracetamol in my drip that worked well enough that I passed out, probably exhausted :/
</p>
<p>
I just suffered through crying almost constantly. The nurses telling me that I was not allowed any other pain killers. The second or third night I was basically screaming at one of them at 3am until they gave me very strong sleeping pills to shut me up.
</p>
<p>
As soon as I got home I was on the phone to the GP who gave me Tramadol and Amitriptyline, I felt better within half hour and the best I had felt since the nerve block wore off.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s the pain that I was in and nobody listening to me that was traumatising. I&#39;m still having issues sleeping and nightmares that I&#39;m still there. It&#39;s horrible waking up and having to turn the light on to check im at home. FFS im 40 years old  😥

You thought that surgery on literally the most sensitive area of your body would only call for ibu-fucking-profen?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious about the demographics here, because POC&#39;s pain is frequently taken less seriously than white people or especially men.  I&#39;m white passing, are you by any chance a person of color?

Nope! Not at all. I mean I was in tears the first few days in bed but I thought I was just being sensitive since other people&#39;s only get ibuprofen and Paracetamol too.

That&#39;s exactly what I thought ! I really wish I knew what I know now. They kept fobbing me off until in literally started screaming at them at 3am then all they did was give me sleeping tablets. TBF they knocked me out in less than 10 minutes.

I feel like since the opioid epidemic the medical field has become obsessed with withholding pain medicine. It’s insane to me that you can have a 6 hour surgery to your genitals and they’re like, “we will give you ibuprofen and Tylenol, and if you make a big fuss, I guess we might also give you tablet of oxy.”
</p>
<p>
Plus the whole toxicity of making people take pride in the amount of pain they can withstand.

calm down. Its very common. Pain is really not the big deal with vaginoplasty. Paracetamol is just fine for the majority of people.

true, but the reason I responded to this person and not op Is that they are making it out to be some super uncommon situation that you only get paracetamol, when in reality its not the case.

Not gonna make claims about the frequency of analgesic prescription in MtF GRS surgeries.  All I&#39;ll say is I&#39;m shocked that major surgery on one of the most sensitive parts of the body does not warrant aggressive pain medication.

Since it has only been 1 month you aren&#39;t full healed.  You can&#39;t judge a wedding cake by the half cooked batter.  It will get better , just give this all time.

Just going to address this.
</p>
<p>
At 6 months post op It still looks like shit.
</p>
<p>
Huge stitches like that were never going to heal without a massive scar, it&#39;s fucking disgusting and just as bad if not worse than looking in the mirror pre op, at least then I wasn&#39;t in physical pain.
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s the point of going through all this shit to end up with disfiguring scars and massive labia that look like testicles. Other surgeons apparently give a fuck and can minimise scarring by using better closing techniques... Not mine though, 75 minutes is apparently plenty to do half a job, leave me in intense pain and disfigured. I wish I had died on the table.

A friend of mine had horribly painful wound dehiscence.  Another had a painful complication with a fistula connecting the vagina canal to the rectum.  One required surgery and the other did not but they both got resolved and they’re both doing better now.

Hi I&#39;m also a month post op and finding it very hard. I&#39;d never had surgery or even been into hospital before. I wish I&#39;d known before hand just how hard recovery would be. The post op euphoria has passed and I&#39;m in constant pain, very emotional and crying a lot. I hate having to dilate and am seriously considering stopping.  But I&#39;m trying to find one task to do each day to motivate myself to get out of bed. Putting a wash on or cooking a meal. It does help take my mind of things for a while. I try to think positively about next week and the week after that and the week after that as I know my body will heal and the pain will diminish and eventually I&#39;ll be able to sit down properly again or lay on my side in bed. I know this will just be a memory and I&#39;ll be happier than ever because my dreams will have come true and I would have survived.

Sadly I can&#39;t speak on post op stuff (yet) but I do recognize pain and frustration when I see it, I just wanted you to know, although zi do not know you. I think your very brave to go through this, the things that trans folks have to go through in the first place is hard all the way around, but I have confidence that in time you will heal and will be glad you did what did 😊 Best of luck to you and keep up the great job. Remember to love yourself, it will get better.

Right there with you. Hospital stay was really traumatic. 4 weeks post-op now and still pretty miserable. Everything is still really swollen and looks like shit. Just tired of feeling gross.
</p>
<p>
The only thing that has helped me is focusing on the small improvements even if they’re not much like how I noticed the other day was the first time I was able to walk down the stairs without much pain. Anyways, I can’t wait to put this nightmare behind me.

im only 5 weeks post op as well and ive had a lot of similar feelings, i feel so useless and i want to get back into my life. i just try to remember that i went thru quite a lot and itll take time to heal. i have definitely second guessed myself in going thru with this but honestly i feel like thats a normal reaction. i mean really who “wants” to have this surgery? ideally id be born with something i was comfortable with. but i wasnt, so i just try to be grateful for the opportunity to have something ill be happier with long term. even tho i also feel kinda “meh” down there right now i know long term ill like having this a lot more than what i used to have. even if its not perfect. the days where i have felt reallyy down, i spend whatever energy i have leftover to do some self care. try shaving your legs if you havnt done that in a while. try on some yoga pants or your favorite undies or  whatever to feel more like yourself, it helps me a lot to see an end goal of sorts.
</p>
<p>
im sorry about your pain, i was given oxy while in hospital, they wouldnt give u something stronger when asked? they also had me on high dose of advil, tylenol, gabapentin. thankfully now ive been managing just fine with small dose of tylenol, advil, and a little bit of weed. i feel more pain when im depressed. but its gotten better every day. last night i had a quick sharp pain while dilating and then when i went to the bathroom later there was some fresh blood and freaked me out and i started overthinking maybe this was not a great idea am i okay? is there something wrong ? i know im ok and its normal. but my mind is so ready to be back to regular life just remember it will take time. i take a photo every day, and look back to see how much i have already healed. it will get better im sure and the pain wont last forever. you got this! we’ll both be okay 👍

Thankyou for this ! You gave me some motivation (as did all the other encouraging posts here :)
</p>
<p>
I used my electric razor to shave my legs down to my knees, as far as I could reach without pain. Yoga pants are a step too far but I tried on a matching bra and thong that I couldn&#39;t wear before (no good for tucking). Surprisingly the bra fitted a bit better so its not just my nipples that have expanded :). The thong was a bit ouchy on the wound area especially the pubes that feel like needles sticking into me but.... It actually looked quite good 😃 I put on a dressing gown and waited for my partner to get home and we had a nice giggle before taking them off and settling down for dinner.
</p>
<p>
Thankyou for the suggestion, I&#39;m going to try and keep this buzz going for as long as possible xx

youre so welcome! everyone heals differently and im sure your pain will start to get better soon 😃 have your partner shave your calves maybe? Lol thats awesome. ive had a small corner of my underwear drawer for years devoted to some undies i wanted to wear after surgery. after i shower ill try on a pair and it makes everything worth it to me. just try to see the positives that will come ! its what keeps me motivated too ! 🙂

I&#39;m just about 5 months post-op zero-depth and even without dilation, I&#39;m only just starting to feel emotionally better and I still physically feel uncomfortable and weak and uncertain.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d had my orchi a few years ago and was going back to the office after like a week and was feeling completely back to normal within a month and I think that definitely gave me the wrong expectations for how hard SRS would hit me.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re definitely not alone. I was a wreck of anxiety and pain the first two weeks too. After that I was still crying and exhausted and fatigued for like the first three months. I&#39;m still desperately uncomfortable worrying over numbness and I can&#39;t sit normally or go for a run BUT it&#39;s getting better every day and most of my life has gone about back to normal.
</p>
<p>
Going on short walks really helped me around month three, though I don&#39;t know what the weather is like where you are. Big winter coats are at least good for semi-stealthily making yourself a donut cushion to sit on at restaurants but other than that, it&#39;s just taking care of yourself and trying to keep it together a few more months 😣 You can do it!

Thankyou for the reply. It&#39;s really interesting that you feel just as bad with zero depth, really goes to show that everyone is different and we should be treated on a case by case basis. I honestly thought this would be a lot less painful than it is after reading a lot of other accounts and from what the surgeon said.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the big coat donut idea lol that&#39;s awesome. I live in Wales / UK so it&#39;s normally 5 to 10 C this time of year. Unfortunately it&#39;s also COVID crazy at the moment so I&#39;m just hibernating until further notice.

I feel you sister!
</p>
<p>
I am also 5 weeks post op. It&#39;s a two stage surgery so I am not finished yet, waiting for my second appointment in January. Also got diagnosed with a uretrovaginal fistula, which should fortunatly be fixed quite easily. Still this will increase my hospitalisation time by a week or so.
</p>
<p>
I also want to have my life back, I am a very active person, running and cycling almost every day before surgery. Now that I will be cleared to do that again from next week on I struggle even more, knowing it won&#39;t be possible. If I only imagine sitting on my bike... Or how my pads inside my running tights would look after a 10 km run...
</p>
<p>
FFS recovery was also tough mentally, but I could not wait to be allowed going for a run. Everything worked like before. Now it is very differnt. I even have my next marathon electrolysis session in between, then a hospital stay because of a check-up for the fistula. And then second surgery a few weeks after, again the supra pubic catheter, so a second&#34; hole&#34; in my pubic area.
</p>
<p>
Definetly the hardest part of my transition. Wishing you the best with your recovery, we are now as close to our goal as possible!

Hi, sorry for what you&#39;re facing ;( What are the symptoms for the fistula? I had to down dilation from 4 to 1, now 2 starting again, due to a deep sharp pain inside near the urethra...it stopped my LIFE, i was really give 4x day as the surgeon asked (i did 3x and he said OK) and...oh God i spent lots money for nothing... Medications, studies, nothing helped with local doctors. Surgeon is an asshole and gaslighted me all the time. I&#39;m sure they did something wrong with bladder and rectum. The gaslighting is to make me cut the talks, to then argue &#34;you never contacted me again, I&#39;m not responsible for that&#34;.
</p>
<p>
3 months after I&#39;m not peeing normal, a ball-like formation in the upper rectal cavity, and other things...
</p>
<p>
Could I send you PM, so to not to populate this post with this? My best wishes for all your coming events 🙏

I&#39;m almost 4 weeks after mine and keep finding this post. I hope things got better for you. I keep looking at stuff like this because some days I wake up and I feel great and others I wake up and feel like my entire existence is a joke and a mistake. I feel like I should be healed and back to work already and I feel guilty for not being productive.

I can&#39;t really relate to the pain issues. I had BA and vaginoplasty in one go and was fine on just paracetamol. What hurt most was my lower back, my complete inability to move meant i was very uncomfortable for the first two-three days.
</p>
<p>
I am almost 2 weeks post-op and mostly recovered, I went out earlier and had beers with friends but the first week I felt like you&#39;re describing. Going to the toilet was messy and awful (its still a chore but better now). Feelings of uselessness and &#34;inhumanness&#34; (disruption of gym/work/hobby routine), boredom, depression, feeling &#34;meh&#34; about the result (as it&#39;s still mostly a bloody sticky mess) are all feelings I felt. Dilating especially fucking sucks. But it does get a bit better I think. You could try touching the places that have healed a bit and explore around there. And also make sure to get a lot of (light) movement! Helps a lot with healing.

I’m 3 weeks post-op and took ibuprofen and acetaminophen the first week. Then I stopped the ibuprofen and have been using acetaminophen since then. They gave me oxycodone but I didn’t feel like I needed it so never took any. There are times the pain isn’t great but I’ve gotten past them ok-ish. I thought I would be back at work after 4 weeks. How dumb I was! 😀
