Been trying to get bottom surgery for a few years now hitting roadblocks and resets occasionally, getting close to an actual surgery date but now I&#39;m worried.
</p>
<p>
My doctor, ali Salim, talked with me and felt sigmoid would be best for me cause dilation and no lubrication was cause me a lot of dsyphoria, but I&#39;m stressed cause I&#39;ve heard and read so many bad things about it even if he seems confident.
</p>
<p>
Rumors I&#39;ve heard are that it smells, that there is no sensation on the inside since the colon section used doesn&#39;t have nerves, and that the lubrication is more closer to mucus from the nostril that globs and leaks out.   He never mentioned the problems I mentioned and tried to assure me that this is the preferred technique in Europe as more younger children are transitioning. My preferred surgery was the peritoneal pull through but he has given me enough pushback (I&#39;m not a very confident arguer) that I don&#39;t feel comfortable trying to convince him for out patient care with Dr whittenburg.  I&#39;m unsure if it&#39;s because kaiser doesn&#39;t enjoy having patient get out care because its more costly on their part.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m already scared of making a lifelong decision, the misinformation is making it worse on top of my dsyphoria of having to wait.  Really honestly would love any kind of advice on this sort of situation
</p>
<p>
Tldr: dr ali Salim encourages sigmoid surgery without telling me all of the potential drawbacks. Uncertain if it&#39;s because they are rumors or because he doesn&#39;t want me to seek out patient care, looking for confirmation and advice

My friend had this particular method done and she majorly regrets it because of the smell and the excessive discharge. The “lubrication” is constant and isn’t similar to cis women because it happens 24/7 instead of only happening when you’re aroused.

Cis women have discharge 24/7, and increased lubrication when aroused.

I&#39;m pretty sure discharge is just combination of vaginal fluid and dead skin and bacteria.  Same vaginal fluid as produced during sex

cis women discharge averages half a teaspoon, anything more than that is considered abnormal and needs to be seen by a doctor, colon produces discharge but in excess in comparison

About the smell, my doctor said after regular douching it should go away.  Is that not the case with your friend? If so I am incredibly worried for myself

Discharge can be a major problem.
</p>
<p>
Smell is ymmv
</p>
<p>
No method has touch sensation inside the vaginal cavity.  It&#39;s all pressure and the sensation is equal.
</p>
<p>
Did he say you never have to dilate, or just dilate less?  I believe you still need to, especially initially.
</p>
<p>
I went PI.  I&#39;d rather control how much lubrication I have and when.

Idt you&#39;re correct about touch sensation. It seems really individual depending on lots of things. I have plenty of sensation in my canal.

Discharge does worry me and he did mention having to dialate in the beginning but that is only for the vaginal opening which is still inverted skin but the canal wouldn&#39;t shrink. Thank you so much for the input

Hey! Short on time so please forgive me. That being said, never have surgery with someone with whom you feel pressured or is not entirely forthcoming with requested information. That would be a major red flag to me if i felt treated that way (if you feel that way now what happens if you have complications you need help with). Further, while not a rule out, my research has generally shown that the Sigmoid procedure is much more invasive and tough in terms of recovery. Take this with a grain of salt given my limited time here to dig further, but I believe this particular method has dwindled a bit in use for initial surgeries due to some increased risks (not to say its wrong to move ahead, but I believe the PPT is less invasive).

If you’re nervous or concerned then say no. You don’t have to do anything you don’t feel comfortable with. I don’t know how your insurance works so I can’t what or who they will cover but you can always see about a second opinion. This is one of the biggest decisions of your life. I’m planning on seeing at least 3 doctors before I decide who I will choose.
</p>
<p>
Also do your own research on the different techniques for GRS. You can never know too much about it and all the techniques. I’ve been reading everything I can.

I have read so much and my problem is my lack of ability to discern information well.  Some documents contradict each other and personal sources nearly always do as well.  I stress about saying no because I have backed out of surgery previously and I&#39;m 23 at this point with medi-cal no longer covering me once I&#39;m 25; with a minimum of a year wait list this is my last opportunity I think due to low income and no supportive family.  Worst case I will take the sigmoid because even with flaws I would prefer it to the other currently available option of penile inversion.  PPT was just the dream scenario even if it is a gamble.  Thank you for the input just reading all the different thoughts of others helps me feel more confident since I don&#39;t have to argue against myself internally.

I decided on ppt to avoid sigmoid. You won’t have sensation with most these surgery in vaginal cavity other then pressure from what my doctor said. Though ppt still has possibility of discharge it’s a clear watery substance and sigmoid is pretty much thick gooey pretty much like the lubricant your body produces when you have anal. Stinky brown mucus .

It&#39;s your body, not his, so ultimately don&#39;t listen to the doctor if you feel doubtful. Your surgeon is not trans and doesn&#39;t know everything you know and other transwomen know, so your opinion is by far the most important. And your preferences regarding discharge, odor, etc are the important thing, not his opinions about it. Who cares if he thinks discharge won&#39;t be an issue? It&#39;s not going to be his vagina on his body.
</p>
<p>
He should be able to give you some kind of data about your concerns, and if he can&#39;t then his opinions are just that--opinions, of someone who has never had this surgery and lived with a trans vagina.
</p>
<p>
And he should do the technique you want, not the one he thinks is most common among &#34;young people in Europe.&#34; Wtf? Who even knows what that means? Again, it&#39;s your body, not his, so if he can&#39;t give you hard data about why his technique is preferable, then who cares what he thinks?
</p>
<p>
For some reason, surgeons tend to be really domineering about telling us what&#39;s best for our bodies. It really gets on my nerves, especially since the vast majority them are not trans and have no clue what our experience is like. In my opinion they should be much more humble and less about telling is what&#39;s best for us.
