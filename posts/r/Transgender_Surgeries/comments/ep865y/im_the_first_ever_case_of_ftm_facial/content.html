*Edit* I&#39;m going to kill myself. I can&#39;t live with the pain, deformity, and trauma. :( I wish I had died that day. My life has become a nightmare because of this surgeon. I just want it to end... Wish me luck.

Sup&#39; y&#39;all? I&#39;ve posted this before but many didn&#39;t believe me so I took the post down. I&#39;ve put up a lot of evidence on my facebook review of him, so y&#39;all can go there for it.&lt;&lt;
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=148895379788360&amp;id=100040036966593&amp;notif_id=1577082050201374&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic">facebook
</a>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, this time around my shell is hardened and I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m believed or not, that choice is up to you. I just want to put this information out there in the hopes that maybe it&#39;ll stop someone else from getting harmed, or killed. My story is below if you&#39;re interested. I&#39;m not answering questions, sorry mates, since everyone was really mean last time, unless I super feel like it, or you&#39;re nice to me. Maybe I&#39;ll change my mind. --Peace out everyone.

<p>
This account is based on my true experience with Dr. Deschamps-Braly and the opinions expressed here are my own.
</p>
<p>
“You pay for my time, not my results.” -Dr. Deschamps-Braly
</p>
<p>
I nearly died under his care. I am an ftm and I underwent gender  confirmation surgery with Dr. Deschamps-Braly to masculinize a feminine  face. On Dr. Deschamps-Braly’s site, he references me as his claim to  fame, I am supposed to be the first ever successful case of full-facial  masculinization surgery on an FtM patient. However, this is a lie, it  was not successful.
</p>
<p>
After my surgery with Dr. D., I suffered a deformed face after nearly a year and a half of infection, I&#39;m in chronic, severe pain for the rest of my life due to nerve damage, I fear I may have brain damage, and I nearly died before falling into a coma. At 24 years old, my life has been destroyed. I fear I will never recover.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I now have a medical diagnosis of facial deformity, nasal deformity and obstructed airway, I am left in extreme chronic pain due to severe nerve damage. My jaw and alveolar nerve have been damaged beyond repair, which has left me with severe, constant pain in the lower half of my face, including my lower lip, chin, jaw, and lower gums, which causes difficulty eating, smiling, laughing, talking, shaving, etc. He has now abandoned me  despite my numerous attempts to mediate a solution and get basic continuance of care. I need to be on nerve medication 24/7 for severe nerve damage.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
In late 2017 during my consultation, we discussed the material he planned to use in order to augment my face/jawline. He said that I would need to trust him entirely and so I did. Typical jaw augmentation should have a 1-2% complication risk. He assured me that this would yield the best results. I had no idea of the nightmare that was to follow under his care.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
After the surgery I suffered from adrenal gland failure and was asphyxiating, luckily a family member was staying with me in the hospital at the time and she alerted the staff, saving my life. My adrenal glands were tested on 12/15/17 and function perfectly. I remained in a coma for 4 days after the onset of adrenal gland failure. The abnormal EEG recording &#34;gives evidence for a very severe, diffuse, continuous disturbance of cerebral activity. No clear focal or epileptiform features are seen.&#34; I fear that this suggests brain damage occurred.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Several surgeries were attempted to close the wound, but the wound in the mouth never healed and the implant later became so infected that it turned into an abscess that leaked out of the bottom of my chin and it needed to be removed. This left a large indent in my jaw and under my chin. He then put in hydroxyapatite directly after, even though in a letter from his assistant, Zhanna, she explains that, &#34;Putting any extra material, including HA, will create more soft tissue tension and incision will fail to heal again.&#34;This also had to be removed because it got (surprise!) infected by the infection that was already there! In the end, after what must&#39;ve been at least 5 surgeries, I lost confidence in his ability to clear the infection.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
He planned to use external wires to hold my jaw in place and then try to clean the infection again.I decided to seek care elsewhere. I felt that external wires would have left my face even more scarred and disfigured and I felt that any new material introduced to the area, including these wires, would have also become infected.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
After nearly a year and half with the infection and on antibiotics daily, some of which required a PICCline, I developed chronic tachycardia. It was suggested by my cardiologist that the permanent tachycardia can be the result of a long and severe infection.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I called his assistant, Robin, explaining that I&#39;m still in severe pain and suffered deformity and would like to see Dr. D, she responded by saying that Dr. D refused to see me and then hung up on me while I continued to cry from the pain. I was diagnosed with acquired facial deformity on 7/15/18 at UCSF.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Dr. D also suggested a forehead implant which was confirmed by two other doctors to have needed removal. There is a large, bald scar all across my hairline, even though Dr. D distinctly told me there would be no visible scar. I&#39;m afraid that the muscle was injured and so now one of my eyes droops badly. I&#39;m being seen at UCSF for the injury to the eye.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I will be needing additional surgery to remove the calcium lump that has formed in my forehead due to the implant.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The rhinoplasty that Dr. D did warped my once-refined nose into a horrible, bulbous, crooked lump which looks nothing like a nose. I was diagnosed with acquired nasal deformity on 7/15/18 by UCSF and I also am diagnosed to have nasal collapse and airway obstruction. All of this caused by Dr D.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Dr. D refuses to help me get the referrals I need to nerve repair specialists so that my treatment may be covered. My surgeries with him and the resulting damages have cost upwards $100,000, which I offered to forgive if he donated $40,000, the initial sum I gave him for my 3rd surgery (a revision for two previous surgeries with him costing about $30,000 each), to a children&#39;s charity, but he refused. He remains the most noisome and grossly incompetent person I have ever met. I wish so much that I had never met him, I am so sad about the loss of my future due to him.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also the poor sucker that was Deschamps&#39; claim to his &#34;adams apple surgery.&#34; Don&#39;t do it, I personally feel based on my experiences with him that this is something that he thought up in order to prey on my specifically trans insecurities. Love yourself, give yourself a chance, know that you are worth it, and run away from this doctor. In my experience, he tried to sell me as much as possible, I feel he did this just for the money and the fame. In my opinion, he has no care for me. Again, based on my experience, he also is a terrible surgeon who has lied constantly to me.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Having surgery with Dr. Deschamps-Braly was the worst decision of my entire life, don&#39;t let it be yours. In my opinion, it may be the last thing you ever do.
</p>
<p>
I was a violinist and now I fear I can never play again, due to the pain of the jaw on the chinrest.  Goodbye, life!
</p>
<p>
********************
</p>
<p>
Update: Beware! Dr. D has shown to be litigious.He has also now threatened me and my mother (who has no part in this) with lawsuit. I fear that he is doing this to threaten my anonymity, thus exposing me as transgender and I fear potentially endangering my life. He is threatening to sue me over my various reviews of him and for requesting a copy of my medical records which he refused to send me until I filed a medical complaint . I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t also threaten to sue my distant in-laws, my dead father, and my dog as well. (All are equally as guilty and should not be spared!) Definitely stay away from this guy.

A single post has limited value. It’s best to find as much as possible so you can have some confidence in your knowledge. There’s some more here

If you’re using an app to view reddit it’s probably hidden away somewhere so most people never see it. In the web it’s in the side bar and Somewhere the top of the page.
</p>
<p>
Also the sticky post in this sub.

I use web personally, with the old style interface.

I didn&#39;t think I would ever actually have to get involved in a court case with him, but now he is threatening to sue me and my mom??? Like seriously? What kind of super prick threatens to sue someone&#39;s mom? So it looks like not only is he threatening my family, he is also threatening the safety of my anonymity which can be life or death for transgendered persons such as myself. I can&#39;t believe the extent of his asshole behavior.
