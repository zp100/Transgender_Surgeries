Since some people have been asking, and I don&#39;t need to show much I&#39;ve decided to upload a photo of the hairline scar that&#39;s been so problematic for me after my FFS with Dr Satterwhite.
</p>
<p>
The link is here:

Any suggestions about how to make this fade are welcome. It&#39;s super conspicuous and I&#39;m self conscious all the time. I&#39;ve worn a headband almost every minute for 4 months now because concealer can&#39;t cover it well due to the texture.

Yeah this is one of the problems with traditional FFS.  Some people can develop a significant scar there.  Good news is over time the pink will reside and become less noticeable.  Bad news is for some people this can take a year or more.  And regardless some people will maintain a significant texture change.  I&#39;ve heard some surgeons have been looking into ways to clean up the scars.  Some cosmetic places will recommend micro needling to help break up the scar tissue or laser.  But I&#39;m not sure you want to laser since... that can result in hair loss  at the area.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately your best bet is time and a hairstyle change.   But I would see if your surgeon has any recommendations.

Sigh. I know. It&#39;s just frustrating because my hairline scar was totally invisible after the first surgery, and it only took about 90 days to get there. The scar from the revision has been a nightmare. I&#39;ve talked to the surgeon and the PA SEVERAL times already. All they say is &#34;wait and see&#34; or use &#34;silicone gel.&#34; It is getting better, just at like a glacial pace. They also referred me to a laser cosmetic center a few cities away.
</p>
<p>
I had a laser treatment today. The tech assured me that any hairloss from the laser won&#39;t be permanent, and I really have no choice but to trust her because I can&#39;t live with it this way forever. Hopefully the color will fade and then I can move on to microneeding to make the indentation less noticeable. I&#39;m also contemplating just having it microbladed or tattooed, which I&#39;ll probably do with the scars on the sides of my head.
</p>
<p>
I look fucking stupid with bangs, so I hope it doesn&#39;t come to that. lol

I have trouble with bangs too.  My forehead sweat wrecks them SO FAST.  They look fine then terrible entirely too soon.
</p>
<p>
If they use a skin treatment laser that intentionally does not target hair then you &#34;should be fine&#34;.  I hadn&#39;t heard of scar tattooing.  Would the idea be to have fine &#34;hair&#34; tattooed over the scar to help minimize the appearance of the scar?  Makes perfect sense.
</p>
<p>
Having it crop up after a revision is maddening.  I&#39;m REALY sorry about that.  I wonder if there is extra risk of scaring from a revision.
</p>
<p>
Any which way huge hugs, I hope you&#39;re able to get it to minimize over time!

Thanks! I just have super curly hair and bangs make me look like a sheepdog. I fucking hate it.
</p>
<p>
Yeah. There are places the do hair-like tattoos just to get better scalp coverage. There&#39;s a microblading version that some places do to fill in hairlines for folks who are balding, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s permanent. I have to wait a year to do that anyway.

is mine, so I feel your pain ðŸ˜­. Iâ€™m actually trying out the scar camouflaging tattooing that people do. Itâ€™s fairly common for facelift scars. So I guess Iâ€™ll know soon how it goes. Hoping like crazy it totally hides it but trying to be realistic. My appt is fri so Iâ€™ll let u kno!

Please do! I really think that might be a good option if the laser treatments don&#39;t work. I also want to get the gnarly ass scars on the sides of my head tattooed.

Iâ€™m dealing with the same thick scar on my hairline Iâ€™m almost a year into my surgery and I also went to Dr. Satterwhite I see other girls with the same surgery and there scar is super thin ðŸ˜© so I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s his technique or what. Iâ€™m sorry you dealing with this tho mines look a lot better but Iâ€™m super self conscious about it

It&#39;s really shit... I&#39;m like 6 months post-op now. I had one laser treatment that helped with some redness, but it&#39;s like someone carved a trough into my hairline on one side. It&#39;s super conspicuous and I hate it. I&#39;m going to pay for some more laser treatments when I can afford them and maybe try microneedling to help with the texture, but I really think my only option is to cover it with a tattoo of some kind, like the microbladed ones they do for people&#39;s eyebrows.  Sigh... what a disaster. The scar on my neck is also still raised and gross and doesn&#39;t cover well even with concealer.

This is pretty typical and you still have healing to do.  Try clip on bangs while itâ€™s healing.

What does he say about it?  He did my genital surgery and the outcome after a revision was fantastic. 5 years out on the 21st of this month.

Hair transplants don&#39;t hold well in scar tissue. It&#39;s also outrageously expensive.
