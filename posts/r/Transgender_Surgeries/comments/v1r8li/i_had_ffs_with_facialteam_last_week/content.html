Going by their previous post, forehead and rhino. This is a DIY thread where readers are given the bare minimum and have to work things out for themselves I think lol.

How has your recovery been? Mine&#39;s somewhat prolonged due to the number of procedures and a hematoma they caught.

It&#39;s actually been really good so far. I have a lot of inflammation and pain around the sutures on the top of my head though. The worst thing for me is the lack of sleep. I just can&#39;t seem to sleep more than a few hours a night since. I&#39;m looking forward until I can start exercising again because I feel like I have too much restlessness pent up.

Yeah, sleep was hard to come by early on. My nose being blocked for the first two months made it really hard to get comfortable!
</p>
<p>
If you have any numbness on top of your head, I just want to reassure you that I have full sensation seven months later.

Good to know! I have one numb spot above my left eyebrow, and a good amount of sensation everywhere else. Tho this means I can move my right eyebrow but not my left lmao. It&#39;s just laying slack flat

Ah, yes, same thing. Except it was my left that couldn&#39;t move. Don&#39;t give up, it mobilised spontaneously after about 6 months. Hard to believe but it came back online rather suddenly. ;)

Cool! How’s the swelling my been? I’m about 2 months post op and the swelling in my nose and chin make it hard to know how I feel about the results. I’m just being patient and waiting to see how things settle.

I completely get what you mean. My nose looks like a hotdog lmao
</p>
<p>
My swelling has been uncomfortable, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been too bad. I think most of the initial swelling around my brow has gone, but the left side of my face is still really puffy.
</p>
<p>
Have you noticed changes happening over the two months, or has the reduction in swelling been too subtle to tell?
