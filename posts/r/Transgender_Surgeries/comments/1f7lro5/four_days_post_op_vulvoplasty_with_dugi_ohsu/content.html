Firstly congratulations on the surgery ðŸ¥°
</p>
<p>
Did you get zero or minimal depth?
</p>
<p>
Did you have to get any hair removal before the surgery?
</p>

Thank you, and zero depth, but I have about 3/4 of an inch of depth.
</p>
<p>
No, I didnâ€™t have hair removal

Amazing thanks for replying ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<p>
Did the surgeon point anything different between full and zero depth? In terms of recovery or care

Well done you, Vulvoplasty is my choice of surgical reassignment  with the NHS UK, hopefully only 18 months away. Heal well.

Looks good!  I want one.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m actually having zero-depth vulvoplasty in December with Dr. Dy at OHSU.  Any advice?
</p>
<p>
My main concerns are for my support person; how long will I need her (sheâ€™s taking off work and driving up here from Medford), does she need to sleep at my place or can she sleep at her partners house close by, what exactly will I need her for, anyway?

We brought water flavor things, drinks with protein, electrolytes, ear plugs and face wipes.
</p>
<p>
It was nice to have comfort essentials, especially the wipes because youâ€™ll not be showering for a few days and itâ€™s a little warm most of the time. The hospital food is bland. Youâ€™ll probably want fun things to snack on especially once you start feeling better.
</p>
<p>
Today is the first day I feel pretty independent and itâ€™s like day five. Youâ€™ll need your care person for a week. Iâ€™ve needed help mostly with showering (holding drain bag and washing feet/legs) and maybe going to the bathroom. Sitting down from standing is a bit stressful initially. Itâ€™s probably best if your support person can be close by, but not in the room so they have the chance to rest. My partner slept in the room with me at the hospital on a recliner and they woke us up a lot
</p>
<p>
DM if you need support or more questions

Thanks for sharing, OP! I&#39;m struggling with the decision between full and zero depth. What were the main considerations for you that tipped the scales to zero depth?

My partner is afab and penetration is kinda mid for me. The thought of dilation was also kind of intimidating and after recovering so far I think it was a wise choice. I have a lot of respect to vaginoplasty patients. The thought of having to also dilate right now would be exhausting
