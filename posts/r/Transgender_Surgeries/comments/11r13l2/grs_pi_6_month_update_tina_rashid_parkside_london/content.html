GRS (PI), Tina Rashid, Parkside, London. Exactly 6 months ago this very hour I was on the operating table getting my new bits fitted! Hardly seems like 5 minutes let alone 6 months, it&#39;s flown past. I remain very happy with my results and a few things have settled down since I last posted an update.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve workout how to pee, without it sometimes going over the seat or between the seat and bowl into my pants (lol), simple solution, thighs together then it goes straight down, maybe this assists others!?!
</p>
<p>
Almost a month ago now I had my first O. Was getting a bit worried about this as thought it was never going to happen, since working out what I needed to do: mood, thoughts, time, sensitive spots(!) I have been able to get it over the hill several more times. I still have very little feeling inside so mostly this is clitoral. I wrote more about this in an earlier post but if you are struggling, don&#39;t be disheartened - it took me over 5 months.
</p>
<p>
The numbness in my labia as disappeared and I have more feeling around inner lips than previously, still quite puffy labia wise.
</p>
<p>
I have good sensation on my mons. My surgeon like most I believe burries spare nerve endings from the shaft under the mons. This is more sensual than sexual, but it&#39;s a nice feeling.
</p>
<p>
Dilation continues to go fine, I am currently solo with the larger orange Soul source once a day. Takes about 5 mins to get to depth then 20 mins in. If I start smaller then getting to depth is quicker, but overall time longer (double cleanup!). I will try going to once every other day now, see how that goes. I still retain douche, so if I am on a hurry to get out the door before it&#39;s all come out then I will still wear a thin pad.
</p>
<p>
Depth wise, I&#39;ve got just over 5.5&#34;. Thus far only dilators and my growing toy collection have been in there!!
</p>
<p>
No sexual encounters thus far - chance would be a fine thing! My sexuality has swung in favour of guys rather since hormones and alot more since GRS. Pre transition I had zero interest in guys.
</p>
<p>
Strange because it was only 6 months, but I have completely forgotten what it &#39;felt like&#39; to have a willy...
</p>
<p>
I put on ~7kg during recovery 90% of which I have now lost again. Fitness is good again. Can hike 30km with 2000M of up, cycle 50KM/1000M (building saddle endurance there!). I did a ski tour Saturday over 25KM/2000M of up. Looking forward to getting back in my kayak and rock climbing when it warms up. Outdoor activities are what makes life worth it for me so overjoyed to be back outdoors with like-minded folks enjoying myself fairly quickly.
</p>
<p>
When nature calls outdoors, I am using a shee-wee (actually called a P-STYLE from Amazon), works very well no leaks and no bareing my fat arse to a cold easterly on the mountain top!!
</p>
<p>
I will likely update this again on the first anniversary of my newbits in September.
</p>
<p>
Any Q&#39;s ask away.

6 months and you&#39;re make to big hikes and long bike rides - that sounds fantastic! That&#39;s really positive to hear, a lot of posts talk about how brutal the initial recovery is, but hearing that you&#39;ve gotten back to life in such a short amount of time again afterwards is hugely motivating!
</p>
<p>
And she look amazing btw - Tina Rashid&#39;s reviews already seemed super hopeful, but the results just look perfect!

oh, yeah, i tried this yesterday. yes, it directs the stream better, but squeezing my thighs together made it harder to pee overall.
</p>
<p>
ETA: i was trying to figure out what your butt/bottom had to do with this, and then realized i needed to translate fanny from British to American...

Hiya, So pleased to hear you&#39;re recovering well. I love kayaking  - whitewater and sea.  My question, please. Did Tina R require you to have electrolysis before GRS? If so, could you share please, assuming it&#39;s not to invasive a question.

I was &#39;blessed&#39; not only with a willy, but a hairy willy by him upstairs so yes, I did need electro. TR was only bothered about the hairs on the shaft. I did about 20 painful hours down there and did a finger width at base of shaft too just to be certain. Hope you have a paddlesport filled summer!

Wonderful results and really appreciate all the information on your recovery. I wish more girls would provide their long range results. Again, your kitty is beautiful, thank you for sharing your experience.

No questions really but congrats. I&#39;m a couple of weeks behind you. I&#39;d love a urethra like yours (if thats not a weird thing to say) but then my pee goes basically down so maybe it&#39;s swings and roundabouts 🤷‍♀️
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve just sized up to the soul source green but not as deep as you are going. I find the bigger dilators don&#39;t go as deep but maybe that will change over time 😊

Thanks. I find that I can get the dilator in a certain depth with the usual knees bent, legs apart posture then it goes in some more if I relax legs onto bed keep pushing sometimes with a very slight twist and more still if I then lift weight off middle eg via lower legs and shoulders before settling back into bed. I think this is just moving folds of skin in my canal out of the way by stretching them.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been amazed at the depth my surgeon created as I was a bit of a pee-wee beforehand!!

Oh ok. I&#39;m still dilating twice a day (obeying the schedule) so maybe I&#39;ll try moving around a bit tonight. It&#39;s so hard to know whether it&#39;s the limit of the skin or whether it&#39;&#39;s hitting your insides.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve a split thickness scrotal graft too which should buy me back a little extra depth as Mr C focused primarily on aesthetics at my request. I think a little more of the &#39;p&#39; skin became labia minora in my case. Dunno really... I was totally average in the donor material department.

I paid £15K but unfortunately prices have now risen to £23K... The consult is £250 IIRC.

Depends how many decades you want to wait?! 4.5 years on the waiting list for me, and if I am ever seen it would have been  another 4 years after that for surgery.

I am 100% private still. NHS here in Scotland is basically useless for trans healthcare. 4 years waiting so far for 1st appointment, and at they rate that they are currently seeing patients I will likely wait a further 6 years.

Love this post, I had mine with her, but at St George&#39;s NHS hospital in Tooting as that is where they send you now also. I had it on 02nd February 2023. 02nd August it&#39;s my 6 month birthday also and I had my first orgasm after 4 months, it does take a bit of work though and I have to really go at it lol, but OMG it&#39;s seriously worth it.
</p>
<p>
Still dilating twice a day, 5 mins with the blue and then 10 mins with the next one up, greenish one that I had to buy myself, from the details they gave me, upon leaving the hospital.
</p>
<p>
I find she does very &#34;pretty&#34; &#34;poppies&#34; but I wish I could see the inner labia alot more, plus the &#34;clitty&#34; is hidden also and it&#39;s higher up inside, the outer labia still seems very swollen in my opinion..
</p>
<p>
Maybe this will change as time goes on.. 🤷
