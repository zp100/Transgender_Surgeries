Hi, I&#39;m interested in getting SRS and my two main options are Brassard and Genoway. I&#39;m not very comfortable choosing Brassard for a few reasons, but I haven&#39;t heard anything about Dr. Genoway&#39;s technique, results, policies, etc. I&#39;ve been looking, and the only reviews I&#39;ve seen are about her doing top surgery. Can anyone tell me more about her and her work?
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

I was Dr. Genoway’s second full vaginoplasty. One thing you should know is that it’s actual a two surgeon procedure, Dr. Kauvanagh (don’t quote me on spelling) works on the vaginal cavity and urethra and Dr. Genoway mostly does the outer aesthetics. They’re both fantastic and I always felt like I was the most important patient with their care. Anyhow they seem to usually do PI if you have the anatomy for it but do have the robot to do PPT if needed. Not clear if when it comes down to it that you’ll get the choice but I would definitely trust what they think is best. I told her I cared the most about aesthetic appearance and she definitely listened! They also use the wound vacuum for your hospital stay and I feel like it made such a huge difference with my swelling. I’ve even had a lot of sensation come back after barely 3 weeks post op. I love my results, the nurses and all of my family can’t get over how cis looking it is even when swollen and bloody. If you have any other questions you can pm me, if I don’t respond right away it’s because sometimes I forgot Reddit exists for a few days lol
