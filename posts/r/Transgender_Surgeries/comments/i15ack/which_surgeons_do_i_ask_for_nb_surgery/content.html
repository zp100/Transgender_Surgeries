I&#39;m from spain and have a lot of dysphoria and need Penile Preserving Vaginoplasty, but as far as i can find, it&#39;s only possible in the US, as far as i know, having mental health problems means you can&#39;t get a visa for the US, and SRS there seems extremely expensive, but i don&#39;t know where else to go for this, i need a reputable surgeon that will be able to not damage my penis during GCS but also leave a good depth and good looking vagina (i assume using the peritoneal graft method)
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
edit: i don&#39;t mind if they don&#39;t use the peritoneal graft method, i just need them to not be in the US, if i had a list of emails for clinics in europe that would help, but the info in the wiki is confusing and i&#39;m having trouble finding the actual websites of the surgeons to email them and ask if they could do it
</p>
<p>
Update: can&#39;t confirm yet but it&#39;s possible that Suporn&#39;s clinic is willing to do it

I unfortunately don&#39;t know of any surgeons outside the US that have been confirmed to offer Phallus Preserving Vaginoplasty. There have been a few posts here and there by folks saying there are some surgeons elsewhere offering it, but as far as I am aware there haven&#39;t been any follow-up posts from folks who have undergone it with those surgeons yet.
</p>
<p>
The number of surgeons offering the Peritoneal Pull-Through technique in combination with a Phallus Preserving Vaginoplasty currently can be counted using exactly one finger.

I hope so. This was my goal when I made my first post 2 years ago.

Ohh okay :/ I‚Äôm sorry.  Maybe you could reach out to regular SRS surgeons (that do some method other than penile-inversion) that would be accessible to you and see if they‚Äôd be open to trying penile-preservation vaginoplasty.  This is of course much riskier but if you don‚Äôt have a way to access US surgeons and you really need this surgery it might be your best bet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wishing you all the best ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è

Ohh I see.  Maybe making another post asking for good European SRS surgeons that use a method other than penile-inversion, and for their contact info, without mentioning penile preservation (as that seems to have thrown people off) would be helpful.

Have you reached out to Dr. Miro&#39;s office in Belgrade? I&#39;m not sure if this a procedure he offers, but he is well known worldwide for performing some more difficult cases of genital reconstruction surgery.
</p>

it might be worth reaching out to ask.
