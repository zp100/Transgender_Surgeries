it sounds significantly more worth it to just move to a country with tall women in Europe instead of breaking both of your femurs and tibia for a negligible amount of height loss that probably no one will notice (even you admit it&#39;s just about the number), In addition to making your legs proportionally shorter to your torso, making your shoulders proportionally broader and with the potential complications of walking being painful literally for the rest of your life and any athletic potential being lost.
</p>
<p>
Just my two cents as a 187cm lady.

<p>
op I get being dysphoric about your height (been there, I love it now and even if this was a free, riskless, painless surgery I still wouldn&#39;t get it) but I think when most people talk about &#34;height&#34; they don&#39;t mean height but &#34;size&#34;. They want to be petite and look cuter or whatever. This surgery would not make that happen, it would simply make you shorter when standing up. Which is not the same thing.

fair. I don&#39;t want to come off as if im minimizing your pain, but I think the calculation to make here is very lopsided against.

for me, this is what it really comes down to and OP and Doctor quoted in the OP doesn’t mention this. that’s a red flag IMO.

Interesting! There&#39;s also a place in Ukraine that will do it, however Turkey seems like a safer destination.

Personally I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. Yes it would be nice to be smaller but too much risk
