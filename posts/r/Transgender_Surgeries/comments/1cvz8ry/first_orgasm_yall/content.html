I know I already posted an update a few days ago, but I just had an amazing development. At 7.5 weeks, 52 days post op, to be specific, I finally had my first post SRS orgasm!
</p>
<p>
I got in ‚Äúthe mood‚Äù, which is honestly way more of a hassle because I was wanting to wait until the 8 week mark before trying again after my week 5 incident (I tried a vibrator and went numb for a week or two), but I couldn‚Äôt help myself. I started not using a vibrator, but after about an hour of frustration, I bit the bullet and grabbed mine (side note, don‚Äôt skimp on a vibrator, mine is very buzzy and high frequency and I‚Äôm probably gonna just cave and get a hitachi. My mom has basically said to get the hitachi lol), and after maybe 5 minutes with it, I‚Äôm having to change my panty liner lmao.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm numb again, but here‚Äôs hoping that either it‚Äôll recover faster, or this orgasm will give me the willpower to wait a few more weeks before trying again.
</p>
<p>
Either way, it‚Äôs a huge deal for me to finally know that not only does Dr Sutin‚Äôs work look the part, but also functions well too!

The most powerful, with the deepest, rumbly vibrations wand-type vibrator I‚Äôve experienced is the Doxy Diecast, solid steel body and vibrating assembly.  Lovense Domi 2 is a smaller one, but powerful and easier to pinpoint the head since smaller.

I ended up going with the Domi, because it gets a bit stronger than the rechargeable magic wand, but I can dial down the intensity if needed

I&#39;ve tried lots and lots of vibrators since my surgery and the one that I found that works best for me is the Plus One Dual Vibrating Massager. I got mine at Walmart for like $30. I was afraid that mine would eventually wear out, so I just went last week and bout a second one. It&#39;s like the vibrations on this are perfect for my anatomy.

For this early post op, yes, as nerves are still recovering.
</p>
<p>
And even cis women can go numb with a vibrator temporarily. My sensation is already where it was before I used it anyway.
