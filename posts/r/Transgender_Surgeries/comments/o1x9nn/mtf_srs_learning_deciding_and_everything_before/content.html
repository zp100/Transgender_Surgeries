From figuring out if I actually wanted SRS (Sex Reassignment Surgery), to researching, hair removal and so much there are many steps involved before having this surgery.
</p>
<p>
This is one entry in a series of posts drawn out of notes and journal entries. Links to all of the posts can be found in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/2d4d_data/comments/axeax8/my_mtf_transition_story_series">my transition journey
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
As with all my posts, this is comprised of notes from my journey, from someone that knew something was off since childhood and transitioned well past puberty. Your journey will be different, YMMV applies to this community more than most, and there is no right or wrong way.
</p>
<h1>
Meta
</h1>
<p>
There is an overall lack of medical research from surgical type, recovery as well as long term outcomes on this topic and there are many opinions. I have tried to remove my own opinions, but I would not be surprised to learn that something I wrote was incorrect or outdated. I recommend taking time to learn and making your own choices beyond what I have written.
</p>
<h1>
Deciding that you want SRS
</h1>
<p>
It took several years for me to decide that having SRS was right for me. I documented this in the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/imd0eq/deciding_srs_was_right_for_me/">Deciding SRS was right for me
</a>
post. Being informed, taking your time, and making sure that this is what you want is never a wrong thing.
</p>
<h1>
Speed
</h1>
<p>
Everything about SRS is slow.
</p>
<p>
Once I finally decided to have SRS there are all sorts of steps that slow you down. Different surgeons have different hair removal requirements, but you need consultations (which have their own wait time) to decide where you are going. Consultations can require a therapist&#39;s letter(s). If you do need hair removal, getting the prior authorization from insurance, if covered, can take a long time and the hair removal process itself is 1-2 years. The surgery itself isn&#39;t cheap so you need to save up if insurance doesn&#39;t cover it. If you need to lose weight, that can take a long time too. After all that you still need to book the actual surgery which can have a multi-year wait list. And when you do have surgery, the recovery is long.
</p>
<p>
When you are at the start and finally say, &#34;Yes this is what I want!&#34; it can be depressing knowing that it can be years away.
</p>
<h2>
Catch 22
</h2>
<p>
You can&#39;t get all the information to decide where to have SRS without consultations. Consultations can take months and they assume you are having the consultation because you have already chosen them. I love

_Witty_Words
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/aage8m/going_crazy_trying_to_figure_out_which_surgeon_i/">rant
</a>
on this.
</p>
<h2>
Cancellations
</h2>
<p>
Doing as much as possible before your consultations will help speed up the whole process. If you are all set it is common to get a surgical date that was a cancellation and is only weeks or months away rather than years.
</p>
<h1>
Separating SRS from your transition
</h1>
<p>
Separating SRS from your social transition and seeing SRS as a medical event has many positive benefits.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
While I could be disappointed at the inevitable delays, I would not be crushed.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I will be pickier about what surgeon I go to.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I will be more likely to choose to do what is right for me rather than what I can get done fast.
<br>
</li>
<li>
If a good opportunity comes up elsewhere in my life I will be able to take advantage of it and put off SRS for a little while.
<br>
</li>
<li>
It gives me permission to say I want to wait a few years to see how techniques or surgeons improve or because I am not 100% sure.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I am giving myself permission to say no I don&#39;t want this without tying it to my transition and conversely when I say yes, I know it is what I want.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I won&#39;t be putting my life on hold until this happens.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is common to not work on the rest of your life while transitioning, treating SRS as the final event, and then getting depressed when you realize that your life is not magically better after. Delaying working on the rest of your life while waiting for surgery can be unhealthy.
</p>
<h1>
Which type of surgery?
</h1>
<p>
The first thing to decide is what major type of surgery you are looking for. For a comprehensive list, details as well as who does what checkout the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_types_of_surgery">Transgender_Surgeries wiki section on types of surgery
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Until you make a choice, all options are still available. They will be there next month and next year. The same surgeons will be around, happy and ready to take your money. It is okay to take your time answering these questions. Your answers can change for many reasons including how you see yourself, changes in sexuality, and your confidence.
</p>
<h2>
Orchiectomy
</h2>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t going to cover all the options, but given the amount of misinformation I have seen about orchiectomy I want to talk about it.
</p>
<p>
What is it? Removal of the testicles.
</p>
<p>
Orchiectomy can be done in several different ways. See the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchiectomy">Wikipedia page on Orchiectomy
</a>
for a full overview of the types as well as full details on each procedure.
</p>
<p>
Orchiectomy is an uncomplicated and short procedure. It is done all over the place because cis men with cancer also have it done. You leave the hospital the same day you had this done. I had a consultation with a surgeon at my local hospital 15 minutes away. An example of how simple this is; he would prefer I go under for the procedure, but we talked about using local anesthetic if I wanted. Even though this is simple, like any surgery a bad infection can result in a very long stay at the hospital.
</p>
<p>
This procedure removes both testicles which is where the majority of &#34;the bulge&#34; comes from. If being able to wear clothes with less worry is what you need, this might be a good option. If looking in the mirror and having an improved profile other than the penis, this might be a good option.
</p>
<p>
If you are having this done before starting HRT because your testicles are big and that is uncomfortable, it is important to know that they atrophy over the first year and become a fraction of their previous size. They are still there, but if &#34;being there&#34; was a huge sense of dysphoria this can be diminished somewhat over time.
</p>
<p>
Cis men need their testicles to be on the outside of their body. If they are undescended they have an increased risk of testicular cancer. That being said, the testicles of trans women on HRT are not like cis men&#39;s, nor are the testicles of those with CAIS, and on
<a href="/r/intersex">r/intersex
</a>
the current view seems to be against the removal of the undescended testicles. I asked one surgeon and they said they would not move them into the abdomen.
</p>
<p>
If you are having this done so you don&#39;t have to take an AA, monotherapy exists and you want to explore that option because it isn&#39;t surgery.
</p>
<p>
You can still get hard after an Orchiectomy. Testicles and the Testosterone they produce are not the only prerequisite for getting hard. If that was the case Viagra, Cialis, etc would contain Testosterone which they don&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
Removing the testicles will change your hormone levels which can change your libido. You might need/want to supplement with topical Testosterone to raise your Testosterone levels to cis female levels after.
</p>
<p>
If you are not considering a vaginoplasty
<strong>
ever
</strong>
there are options such as
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/b9v8rg/pioneering_a_new_transgender_surgery_option/exfb3p5">orchiectomy with a labiaplasty
</a>
or a scrotectomy to remove all the skin. If you are not sure, you could get an orchiectomy and several years later a scrotectomy or labiaplasty with the remaining skin once you are absolutely sure.
</p>
<p>
It is common to get an Orchiectomy and then later get a Vaginoplasty. A select few surgeons won&#39;t operate on you if you have had an Orchiectomy. Beware that this also makes hair removal more difficult and can reduce elasticity. If the surgeon you are going to does not use the scrotum material to extend the internal vagina this matters less.
</p>
<p>
An Orchiectomy removes the Tunica vaginalis peritoneal tissue which some surgeons use these days to line the back of the vagina rather than scrotal skin. This technique is becoming more common because this tissue will never grow hair.
</p>
<p>
Overall don&#39;t get an Orchiectomy for the wrong reason.
</p>
<h1>
Learning
</h1>
<p>
Consultations with surgeons go much better if you understand what is involved and how SRS is performed.
</p>
<p>
For a fun, well produced overview video of everything involved in SRS (I do disagree with the comment about dilation though) checkout

<a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/transgender-health/gender-affirming-surgery-feminizing-options">Gender affirming surgery feminizing options page

</p>
<p>
The book &#34;Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life&#34; has a detailed chapter all about genital development. Also given how much sex is a component of SRS and how our sexuality often changes from transitioning, the rest of the book is also worth reading.

</a>
.
</p>
<p>
There are videos of actual surgeries you can watch. I won&#39;t lie, the first few times watching them was pretty horrifying. Little by little as I learned the different techniques and had a deeper understanding of what they were doing and could even critique the techniques used.
</p>
<p>
There are many presentations by surgeons online, one to start with from a surgeon in Thailand on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN-NVge8XmY">Neovagina care
</a>
which goes over different techniques and

</p>
<p>
There are of course many medical articles you can read.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582028">Dr. Suporn
</a>
is very interesting all by itself and
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6626315/">Transgender vaginoplasty: techniques and outcomes
</a>
is a good review of current techniques.
</p>
<p>
There isn&#39;t one way that this operation is performed. There are several major different ways most surgeons perform this surgery. Even if two surgeons say they perform a penile inversion there are a dozen main variations and each has their own unique way that they accomplish the result. Any good surgeon will themselves have several different methods depending on the individual and what they have to work with. Lastly, surgeons are improving their techniques. A photo or result from a year ago might be something the surgeon doesn&#39;t do anymore.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of information you can learn on this topic. Perhaps I didn&#39;t need to translate Russian medical papers on the davydov technique or try to observe a surgery (with covid that never was able to happen). Somewhere between reading this and where I went is what you want to do.
</p>
<p>
Pay attention to the possible complications both short and long term, some can even result in you having more surgeries. Necrosis, incontinence, and fistula are all possible directly after surgery for example. Learning how complications are dealt with set my mind at ease if I were to ever have one.

<h2>
Revisions
</h2>
<p>
Most are happy with their initial result and don&#39;t go back for a revision, but
<strong>
more than 30% of people get revisions
</strong>
. Beyond the 30%, there are those who say they would do something, but are okay with what they have and don&#39;t care to go through the hassle. Some surgeons include it with the initial cost because it is so common and expected.
</p>
<p>
The most common areas of revision are removal of excess erectile tissue from within the labia majora, better defining the clitoral hood and labia minora, removing tissue around the urethral opening, and construction of a posterior commissure.
</p>
<p>
The erectile tissue is often an aesthetic choice. Some like having labia majora with a bit of &#34;bulk&#34; in them, that also swell in response to sexual stimulation like cis women. (As opposed to &#34;flat&#34;, &#34;deflated&#34;, or &#34;young&#34; looking labia.) Other girls would prefer they get that reduced.
</p>
<p>
The labia minora and clitoral hood are delicate immediately post-op, and they can heal in hard-to-predict ways. They&#39;ll sometimes heal with strange creases or folds that can be corrected. The tissue around the urethra almost always protrudes after the first surgery. This is because removing too much of the urethra during the initial surgery makes it much more likely to swell closed during recovery, forcing the patient to be re-catheterized. They can remove the excess in the revision.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s very difficult to construct a posterior commissure during a single stage surgery. It is a very fragile structure that very often results in dehiscence when dilating so it is often saved for the revision.
</p>
<p>
Revisions typically are simpler, outpatient, and have a faster recovery.
</p>
<h2>
What&#39;s up with the photos I see?
</h2>
<p>
The vast majority of photos you see are before 3 months post-op, often 1 week. This does not reflect the final result and certainly doesn&#39;t reflect the result of someone who has a second stage / revision which can always improve on the initial results which are limited because of swelling.
</p>
<p>
Some surgeons do produce consistently fantastic results. Even if a revision could improve the external appearance, it is usually good enough and the dysphoria is gone. A minor cosmetic revision on something I can&#39;t see without a mirror and my partner will only look at in the dark (and even in the light couldn&#39;t tell)? Not that important.
</p>
<p>
The perfect photos you want to see are from someone who went to a good surgeon 3+ years ago. Add in some luck of no complications. They probably had a Labiaplasty 2+ years ago, had laser on the scars, and after that finally healed then posted a photo. This person probably also disappeared from the community years ago.
</p>
<h1>
Not a porn star result
</h1>
<p>
If you are jumping into SRS with very little knowledge or with certain expectations it is easy to be disappointed the week after surgery when it is swollen with stitches everywhere. The two letters from the therapists are not there to be gatekeeping, but are there for you to talk through what is involved and what you will get. You might hyper analyze the result, but in contrast, many women have never once looked at themselves in a mirror.
</p>
<p>
Once I let go of that idea that it can&#39;t have a porn result then it was almost fun considering all of the various off menu options or different techniques even if I would dismiss most of them. Rather than evaluating the different techniques against how close they are to a natural vagina, you can evaluate them based upon what they offer you. Given the variation between surgeons and the pre-op starting place, even without tweaks, every SRS result will be unique.
</p>
<p>
Having learned too much it was important for me to remind myself that my goal was to relieve my dysphoria, not anything else. There is nothing wrong with having a vagina that is different. Will any of those differences stop me from being happy with who I am and how I look? Will I care if my anogenital distance ends up being 3mm longer than average? Will I care if someone looks at my result up close with the lights on and they can see some faint scar lines? Not one bit.
</p>
<p>
Will I care that when I go to take a shower and I catch a glimpse out of the corner of my eye of a woman walking across the bathroom and know that it is me? Yes. Is it possible to have enjoyable, orgasmic sex? Yes. Even with the limitations of what we can get right now having SRS will make me comfortable with my body and overall much happier.
</p>
<h1>
Medical differences
</h1>
<p>
The techniques used today can give you a vulva and vagina, but medically it won&#39;t result in you having a vagina exactly like those that cis women are born with, both the good and bad.
</p>
<p>
From a medical perspective, nerves have to be cut. The clit won&#39;t extend around the vagina. There is no guarantee to have your internal vagina tissue self lubricates when aroused (PPT is self lubricating 24/7 and not talking about the cowper&#39;s gland, but the vagina). Dilation is required no matter the technique, especially at the start and ongoing for life. A few might have the external scars disappear quickly, but not all. And that is all with the best outcome. It is common to want there to be a better solution. And of course, the obvious is that in nearly all cases there will be no uterus attached at the end.
</p>
<p>
It can be a helpful reminder that vulva&#39;s have a very large variation and the Davydov procedure was created for cis women and many cis women dilate or use lubrication. None of them are any less of a woman.
</p>
<h2>
Lubrication
</h2>
<p>
Checkout
<a href="https://drzphd.com/transgender/nonbinary/trans-women-the-myth-behind-self-lubricating-vagina">The Myth Behind the Self Lubricating Vagina
</a>
</p>
<p>
Tl;dr Will I be able to have sex without needing lube?
</p>
<p>
There is no surgery that will guarantee that you won&#39;t need to add lubrication. Depending on your body and the type of surgery you might be moist, but no surgery can give the vagina a sexual response and you will almost always want to add lube. The Cowper&#39;s gland separately might give you lots of lubricant.
</p>
<h2>
Dilation
</h2>
<p>
All current techniques that give you a vagina that isn&#39;t zero depth require dilation. I put together a comprehensive
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/tfj6wx/guide_to_dilating/">Guide to dilating
</a>
with a lot more detail on this topic.
</p>
<p>
From a scheduling perspective only book the surgery date if you are certain you can dilate multiple times a day for 6 months after surgery.
</p>
<h2>
Hair removal process
</h2>
<p>
Every single surgeon is okay with you getting at least some hair removal. Removing all hair before surgery will take a year+ if you do it continuously no matter how small the area is to clear because of hair cycles.
</p>
<p>
I put together a comprehensive guide on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/nre1km/hair_removal_information_for_mtf_srs/">Hair removal information for SRS
</a>
.
</p>
<h2>
Sensation
</h2>
<p>
When the gland is turned into the clitoris the nerve bundle that runs up the penis is removed from the penis. This means that all nerves in the skin of the penis are cut. These nerves will hopefully reconnect with the nerves where they are attached (the thigh nerves), but a bunch of your vulva is going to be numb for a long time (months to several years), potentially forever.
</p>
<p>
The clitoris is created out of a section of the gland of the penis. It is not the frenulum, but the opposite side where the nerve bundle connects to the gland. Fun fact: the frenulum is so sensitive because the nerves branch out from the nerve bundle on the other side and meet up on the other side which makes it twice as sensitive as other areas. These fun sensitive nerves are all cut.
</p>
<p>
The long and the short of it is you will have skin that is numb potentially forever and achieving clitoral orgasms can be harder, but still possible with the chance of it never happening again.
</p>
<h1>
Regret
</h1>
<p>
Are you having SRS because it is expected of you? Because it is the &#34;final step&#34;? Do you feel that therapist letters are only gatekeeping to get through? Do you think you will be able to stop dilating after a few weeks? Do you think your scars will disappear and no one will be able to tell? Are you only doing it to make dating easier and not because you want it? Are you rushing into this?
</p>
<p>
Take time to read through some
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/e5de09/srs_regrets/">SRS regrets stories
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
A lot of common regrets include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They felt they had to do this as the &#34;next step&#34; even if they were not sure
<br>
</li>
<li>
They were pressured into having SRS
<br>
</li>
<li>
Others told them that this would help them &#34;pass&#34;
<br>
</li>
<li>
They expect a 100% cis vulva/vagina
<br>
</li>
<li>
They were not aware of key details of the surgery. Such as how long recovery is, how much they would have to dilate, how much can be numb, how much harder orgasms would be to achieve, or how orgasms often change as the refectory period changes.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Having SRS with an inexperienced surgeon or one who frequently has complications.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Getting the wrong surgery, such as getting zero depth when they realize after the fact they actually want depth.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Dealing with one or more major complications.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Have SRS for the right reasons and understand what it will give you and what it won&#39;t give you. Becoming well informed, choosing that
<em>
you
</em>
want to do this, and taking your time can reduce a lot of possible regrets you can have.
</p>
<h2>
Miserable
</h2>
<p>
Post-op life can be miserable for a while. There is still swelling, pain, and never ending dilation. Everything is still healing and minor complications are still being dealt with. Depression around the two month point appears to be common. A few
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/nl8zd0/my_6_weeks_update_srsppv_in_thailand_dr_kamol/">example
</a>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ntrfsi/dilation_and_postop_depression/">posts
</a>
talking about what it is like to be at this point.
</p>
<p>
This point is miserable enough that expressing regrets about having the surgery at this point is common. Going into the surgery you need to know that recovery can be long and hard.
</p>
<h1>
Recovery Timeline
</h1>
<p>
Barring complications, the following seems to be a decent gauge of recovery time.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Back to doing stuff beyond only recovering and dilation: 3-6 weeks
<br>
</li>
<li>
6 weeks is when you are usually cleared for full physical activity
<br>
</li>
<li>
Orgasm: anywhere from 2 weeks to 1+ year. The further into recovery you are the easier and more enjoyable they are.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Return to work: 6-8 weeks is common, but this has been as soon as 3 weeks and as long as 12 weeks.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Sex: 6-12 weeks, a lot more enjoyable later in recovery
<br>
</li>
<li>
Majority of the swelling disappears: 4 months
<br>
</li>
<li>
Energy returns, back to &#34;normal life&#34;, between 4-6 months
<br>
</li>
<li>
9-12 months, all better, pain is gone, no discharge, orgasms and sex are better, dilation is down to a manageable level (once a day).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is an important reminder that after this surgery you are signing up for a multi-month long initial recovery. And dilating 3x a day for 6 months is a big time commitment.
</p>
<h1>
Therapist letters
</h1>
<p>
Every surgeon requires therapist letters. I asked my existing therapist for a recommendation for my 2nd. Our meetings covered everything that needs to be in the letter as well as a few things I wanted to talk through. Before booking appointments make sure to check if your insurance requires specific qualifications.
</p>
<p>
Your insurance might have a list of things the letter must include.
<a href="https://www.drchristinemcginn.com/services/socrequirements.php">Dr. Christine McGinn&#39;s Letter Requirements
</a>
is a good resource of what to include and talk through at the minimum.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t look at the letters as gatekeeping. This is the place for you to figure out for sure that you want to have surgery. Talk about every possible related aspect that is relevant to you. Doesn&#39;t matter if it isn&#39;t required by the letter, if it is relevant to you, talk it out. This can include topics such as sexuality and dating. Do not be that person that rushed through it and later regrets not taking the time to talk.
</p>
<h1>
Getting your body ready for SRS
</h1>
<p>
From the surgeon&#39;s perspective, they do not have long-term relationships with you. They often see you for the first or second time on surgery day and do the best with what you give them. It is up to you to prepare your body. You can do some, all, or none of these. None of these are quick and some can take years to do.
</p>
<h2>
Stop Smoking
</h2>
<p>
Smoking can cause issues during and after surgery. It slows healing, which can cause surgical incisions to be more likely to become infected. This is serious enough that some surgeons will test you for nicotine. And that pesky lung cancer thing is a good reason to stop too.
</p>
<h2>
Weight / BMI
</h2>
<p>
BMI isn&#39;t a gatekeeping thing. You will have a better outcome and recovery if you are in a healthy weight range.
</p>
<p>
High BMI is associated with a higher chance of death during surgery. The wounds on obese people don&#39;t stay closed as well and take longer to heal. Infections are more common and more serious. Anesthesia is more difficult to do, surgeries take longer and so the patient is more at risk due to being under for longer.
</p>
<p>
While you can lose weight only to the upper end of the BMI requirement, being in shape, in general, will also help with your recovery.
</p>
<p>
Every surgeon I investigated had some sort of BMI range requirement for a good reason. This also means gaining weight if you are underweight.
</p>
<h2>
Hair removal
</h2>
<p>
It is up to you how much you do. You will live with the consequences, not the surgeon. Do not put yourself in the stressful position of hoping to finish hair removal before an immovable SRS date.
</p>
<h2>
Penis skin
</h2>
<p>
For the first two years of HRT, I had had an alarm on my phone that I used to remind myself to get hard twice a week, but then I discovered I could masturbate with a vibrator which was way better. Unfortunately, the vibrator didn&#39;t need me to get hard. I don&#39;t actually know if this was the reason or the continuous low Testosterone in my system, but by 2.5 years erections had become painful and I had lost some length and some girth. I even got a small tear after one erection from the skin being so tight and thin. Beyond the pain, this skin is used in SRS so restoring it was important.
</p>
<p>
I got a prescription for low dose Testosterone that I applied once a week to that skin. Testosterone causes your skin to thicken. Within two months the pain had gone away. Testosterone causes hair growth so there is a balance (and luck) here. Shortly before surgery, I found two vellus hairs on my upper shaft (which were removed, but still).
</p>
<p>
I learned that
<a href="https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/chemistry/Shea-Butter-Extract-for-Bioactive-Skin-Care-310136331.html">applying Shea butter can cause the skin to become thicker, with more collagen
</a>
. I also came across a small
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30052192/">study
</a>
which found that applying Witch Hazel topically may help with improving elastic fibers that had UV damage. I switched to Shea Butter and Witch-hazel daily to try to help get thicker, more elastic skin, but without the risk of hair growth. I don&#39;t know if it is as good as Testosterone, but if I could do it over I would try this first.
</p>
<p>
To further help stretch out the skin I got a prescription for Cialis. The drug has a long half life unlike Viagra and stays in your system for days. With Cialis, I could stay hard longer, as long as I didn&#39;t have an orgasm. Stretching out the skin by getting and staying hard was the goal.
</p>
<p>
Between all of the above, my erections no longer were painful anymore and girth/length were restored.
</p>
<h2>
Foreskin Restoration
</h2>
<p>
If you were circumcised,
<a href="/r/foreskin">r/foreskin
</a>
has a lot of information about how to stretch out your skin to restore it if you want to do that. The foreskin is often used in creating different skin from the clitoral hood to the labia minora. Surgeons see patients that have been circumcised and know how to deal with the situation so this isn&#39;t required, but it is worth being aware of this.
</p>
<h2>
Scrotal skin
</h2>
<p>
Within 6 months of starting HRT, my testicles were a fraction of the size they were before. In the years since without the constant weight and size my scrotal skin has shrunk. I have heard a few surgeons talking about stretching the skin before surgery. When this skin is used to construct the end of the vagina having more isn&#39;t a bad thing. Enter (NSFW)
<a href="/r/BallStretching">r/BallStretching
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
For me, there isn&#39;t anything I could do that would make me more dysphoric than this, but here I was learning about this topic.
</p>
<p>
This community has been around for a long time and has a ton of information. Unlike our community where so many have SRS and disappear, this group sticks around and keeps talking about it (and taking photos).
<a href="https://www.secretleather.com/jarod-johansens-ball-stretching-guide/introductory/the-principle-of-skin-expansion">The Principle of Skin Expansion
</a>
is a fantastic resource. Ignoring ball stretching, reading through everything made me way more confident and less scared in dilation than our scattered anecdotes. I now have a much better idea of how to recover depth if needed.
</p>
<p>
Ball stretching is sort of like reverse dilation before SRS. Given I was working from home and other than suffering from the resulting massive dysphoria I saw only the potential upsides of giving my surgeon some more skin to work with. After the initial period, I could do it 24/7, unlike dilation. As for hiding the fact I am wearing something, big skirts worked fine. Even after taking a week off after every electrolysis session for healing, within a few months, I had more skin.
</p>
<p>
To deal with the dysphoria in the moment I saw this as an absurd, laughable, &#34;how did I get here?&#34; thing I was doing.
</p>
<p>
Even if you have no interest in getting a weight, it is worth reading how to do
<a href="https://www.secretleather.com/jarod-johansens-ball-stretching-guide/methodology/method1">manual stretching in the shower
</a>
. This combined with trying to help improve the skin quality can help prepare the skin for surgery.
</p>
<h2>
Prostate orgasm
</h2>
<p>
Some surgeons won&#39;t operate on you unless you have had an orgasm of any kind. For me, figuring out how to have a prostate orgasm relieved the worry that I will never be able to have an orgasm again at all. If something happens and I have necrosis of the clitoris I know I can still orgasm that way.
</p>
<h1>
Picking a surgeon
</h1>
<p>
You can find a comprehensive list of
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_surgeons">surgeons on the wiki
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
There are some inexperienced surgeons that have poor results or have a high rate of complaints. This is less the luck of the draw and more about skill and knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, after doing all your research you can&#39;t say something like I want Dr. Suporn clitoris, 2nd clitoris, Dr. McGinn&#39;s overall vulva, and Dr. Ting&#39;s hybrid vagina.
</p>
<p>
This is where it is important to rank what is important to you. Sexual sensation, natural vulvar aesthetics, and vaginal depth are the three big ones, but other things such as the amount you are willing to travel, and cost come into play too. Most surgeons are about the same when things go right. It is when there are complications you find out how good a surgeon is.
</p>
<p>
What I looked for in a surgeon changed as I learned more. In the end, someone who has experience producing consistent results, who can help with complications, and who I can go back to for a revision became the most important for me.
</p>
<h1>
Consultation
</h1>
<p>
I decided to go with Dr. McGinn and put that in the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/kbfybb/srs_consultation_with_dr_mcginn/">consultation with Dr. McGinn
</a>
post.
</p>
<h2>
Questions
</h2>
<p>
Here are a few questions you can think about asking at your consultation(s)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What is their current technique?
<br>
</li>
<li>
How has their technique changed over the years? What&#39;s new/changed?
<br>
</li>
<li>
Can I see photos?
<br>
</li>
<li>
How many have you done? (look for over 100)
<br>
</li>
<li>
How consistent are the results?
<br>
</li>
<li>
Complication rates - like inability to orgasm, fistulas, etc.

<br>
</li>
<li>
BMI lower and upper limit
<br>
</li>
<li>
Which dilator do you create the vagina around? Why that one? (no they don&#39;t all use the orange one)
<br>
</li>
<li>
Cost
<br>
</li>
<li>
Dates
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hair removal
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What do you recommend for hair removal?
<br>
</li>
<li>
Would doing more be beneficial?
<br>
</li>
<li>
How much hair inside of a vagina do you see?
<br>
</li>
<li>
Do you scrape and or cauterize any remaining hair during surgery?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
External aesthetics
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Where do you place the urethral mucosa in your technique?
<br>
</li>
<li>
How will the foreskin be used?
<br>
</li>
<li>
How is the hood of the clitoris formed?
<br>
</li>
<li>
What is done with the glands of the penis?
<br>
</li>
<li>
How are the labia minor/major created?
<br>
</li>
<li>
Where do the inner labia end?
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Worry
</h1>
<p>
I am the only person I am aware of that had an unlucky and horrifyingly painful experience with my FFS (great results though!). This caused a lot of apprehension around the idea of another surgery, one that can have a very painful recovery with lots of complications. I talked about complications first in all my consultations. I did a lot of research into SRS which also involved lots of reading around the difficult first six months of dilation, complications, and revisions.
</p>
<p>
At some point, I took a step back to remind myself why I am doing this. I am not doing this for the swollen disaster that is one week after surgery, but about how I will be five and ten years from now. Being able to look down or in the mirror and feeling comfortable with myself rather than ashamed. Knowing that after everything is healed it won&#39;t be some &#34;foreign thing&#34;, but will be warm, part of me, and sensate. The idea, the real idea, of relearning about my body including how to orgasm. Embracing the good and the bad and loving who I will be after this. When I am overwhelmed or start to worry about complications I now think about this which helps a lot.
</p>
<h1>
The long marathon
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
I gave myself a year minimum to decide if I wanted to pursue SRS
<br>
</li>
<li>
I scheduled consultations ... for months/years away.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I started the paperwork to get prior authorization for genital electrolysis ... only took 9 months
<br>
</li>
<li>
I started electrolysis ... which took 20 months.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I got a recommendation for a second therapist ... who I saw 7 months later (because covid, but still)
<br>
</li>
<li>
I finally booked a surgical date ... 6 months later
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Many of these were done in parallel and they were all done in the background. By the time I was booking the surgical date it was actually anticlimactic. I had been working on this in the background for so long that booking the date was only another step. Even with a date, it was still more than a half year away with fifty things that needed to get done first. It wasn&#39;t until later when I booked the hotel room that it hit me that this is actually going to happen.
</p>
<h1>
Pre-op
</h1>
<p>
There is a fair amount to do after you decide on a surgeon and book a surgical date.
</p>
<h2>
Money
</h2>
<p>
Surgery always has some costs. Maybe you have to pay the full amount out of pocket. Maybe you need to switch insurance plans to cover it. Maybe you have to pay your insurance max deductible. Maybe you only need to save up for the extra miscellaneous costs associated with having it done.
</p>
<h2>
Paperwork requirements / Insurance
</h2>
<p>
Therapist letters, maybe an Endocrinologist letter, HIPAA forms, and various smaller things that your insurance and or doctor will require is a bunch of paperwork that is best to do sooner rather than later.
</p>
<h2>
Buddy forms
</h2>
<p>
Almost every surgeon I spoke with required you to have a buddy with you after surgery. Confirming that someone can actually go and any logistics involved can be a big task. There are people
<a href="https://www.t4tcaregiving.org/caregivers.html">that

</a>
help.
</p>
<h2>
Travel
</h2>
<p>
Booking the hotel, flights, car rental, etc. If you are leaving the country, there can be more paperwork.
</p>
<h2>
Hair removal
</h2>
<p>
Continue doing electrolysis as needed up until surgery.
</p>
<h2>
Medical Release
</h2>
<p>
Lab work, chest x-ray, physical, and anything else your surgeon requires.
</p>
<h2>
Work
</h2>
<p>
If you can take a leave of absence from your job that can have more paperwork to do. Figuring out who will cover for you, telling your boss you will be out, etc.
</p>
<h2>
To get/buy/bring
</h2>
<p>
What to get breaks down into several groups. Your surgeon should give you a list and you can find more comprehensive lists from other people on the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_preparing_for_surgery">wiki
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
A basic list:
</p>
<p>
Before surgery
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Before surgery liquid diet: Protein drinks, jello, clear chicken soup, etc
<br>
</li>
<li>
Magnesium Citrate &amp; fleet enema for the day before
<br>
</li>
<li>
Hibiclens Liquid Soap for the night before surgery
</li>
</ul>
<p>
After surgery / recovery
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Loose clothes such as skirts, dresses or sweatpants
<br>
</li>
<li>
Inexpensive underwear that you will eventually toss
<br>
</li>
<li>
Donut pillow
<br>
</li>
<li>
Grabber for when you don&#39;t want to bend down.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Surgical gloves
<br>
</li>
<li>
Peri bottle
<br>
</li>
<li>
Panty liners
<br>
</li>
<li>
Lozenges, lip balm, water bottle
<br>
</li>
<li>
Protein drinks &amp; bars and other nutritious snacks
<br>
</li>
<li>
Entertainment
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For dilating
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Handheld mirror
<br>
</li>
<li>
Bacteriostatic water soluble lube jelly such as Surgilube or KY (~0.25 - 0.33 oz per dilation session) Try to get something with a
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/n8q84q/type_of_lube_matters_a_lot_to_prevent_bv/">lower ph
</a>
<br>
</li>
<li>
Dipper pads, Puppy pads, or similar
<br>
</li>
<li>
Baby wipes or washcloths
<br>
</li>
<li>
4&#34; Gauze pads to keep the stitches below the vagina dry after each dilation
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Luck
</h1>
<p>
You can spend years researching, doing consultations, choosing the best, preparing, and being very careful after surgery. You can understand what you are getting and what the complications are and be mentally prepared. And something doesn&#39;t go right. Every surgeon has results that are good and bad. Maybe you end up with complications and a less than ideal result. Maybe you have to have a revision.
</p>
<p>
Even with perfect results, post-op depression is still a very common thing. Dilation will be hard and annoying. Your therapist can help you through recovery. Remember to be kind to yourself.

The thought of ending up with a numb vulva is totally mortifying, and not getting srs is a recipe for destroying my sanity in the long run. There&#39;s got to be a silver lining... right?

Nope, there doesn&#39;t have to be anything. It happened to me. I have to live with the pain and disappointment in that. It&#39;s not a small ask for anyone. I&#39;m not suggesting anyone forgoes their dreams of GRS, I&#39;m just telling you that what you describe happens.

Choose your surgeon wisely. Follow the 50 procedure rule.

Thank you for sharing. I don&#39;t think people often put enough weight on how significant losing sensation is as a complication, and how traumatic that could be. I really hope you&#39;re able to heal mentally from that, and again I really appreciate you using your story to raise awareness and give good advice to prevent other people from making mistakes &lt;3

BTW- Your right, of course. No one thinks they are going to end in the wastebasket of GRS. Fortunately, it doesn&#39;t happen too frequently. I&#39;m lucky to be older, bit since this happened, I&#39;ve meet younger 20-somethings faced with the same level of loss and worse.
</p>
<p>
The fact is, faced with the same situation, I would make the same choices. There&#39;s no do-overs. I can reason through everything and tell myself it&#39;s not going to define who I am or keep me from living my best life, but it&#39;s really difficult when you can&#39;t get any closure.

It&#39;s really scary and sad to see this boom in SRS surgeons, and all the young people who have insurance coverage for SRS for the first time, but with an iffy surgeon. It&#39;s scary to see surgeons (such as yours) present themselves as experts online, and especially on platforms where young people circulate. If I&#39;m not wrong you saw her 4 years ago, probably before that, but it makes it hard for other people to see what she&#39;s done.
</p>
<p>
I have a small platform on Youtube, and I mentioned once about referencing the wiki for SRS results. I don&#39;t think anyone knew about it, even the ones who were getting SRS. Our doctors let us down, they don&#39;t know about what our options are. All of my own research on SRS has been from resources by trans people for trans people. I&#39;m so incredibly grateful for HiddenStill making the wiki, it&#39;s been my single best resource for research, but it&#39;s scary that my doctors weren&#39;t able to provide any insight or details themselves. It&#39;s scary that more trans people aren&#39;t aware of such a great resource existing.
</p>
<p>
Even for me, I&#39;m going to a surgeon next year who has a great reputation and I
<em>
think
</em>
will do right by me. There are no guarantees. I could suffer the same complications as you or worse. Sometimes things just happen.
</p>
<p>
Again, I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;ve had to go through what you&#39;ve gone through, and I hope you know it&#39;s not your fault. Our doctors should be better supporting us, and our surgeons should be committed to providing good results. Our surgeons should not claim to be experts if they are not. I hope technology is able to advance to repair your nerves. And again, thank you for sharing your story. We need to know what could happen before choosing to get surgery.

I would never betray their confidence, but I hear from her current patients and her older patients. I&#39;m completely blown away that after 4 years they talk about the very same types of ongoing complications. She definitely targets the younger tik tok crowd with her social media. She&#39;s also the target of a lot of transphobic attacks.
</p>
<p>
I would be a lot more likely, to give her a break if she just had the guts to contact me and explain why she did the things she said to me. If she wants to try and justify denying me access to the health care I needed for over two years, I&#39;m all ears. The thing is she won&#39;t. She fabricated the reasons she used to dismiss me from the entire plastic surgery department at IU-Health. When I challenged her non-documented accusations considering I has seen nor spoken to her or her staff for 7 months. The CMO of IU-Health, Dr Gregory Kiray, responded to me, &#34;She said it happened&#34;.  This, from a surgeon I never had a single argument with over 10 months and two surgeries.
</p>
<p>
All I can say until she explains to me how she could do this to me, her own patient, is trans--people should avoid Dr Sidhbh Gallagher their gender-affirming surgery needs.

I don&#39;t really understand YouTube. Its like a different world where no one acknowledges any other source of information exists. I think you&#39;d help a lot of trans people if you could spread the word more.

yeah definitely, I was actually super surprised that people hadn&#39;t seen it. I&#39;m pretty sure I found it by googling things like &#34;srs results&#34; or &#34;brassard srs results&#34;. I&#39;m glad that I could help people find it though, and I plan on continuing to share it.
</p>
<p>
Although I think there are different personalities when it comes to researching srs, it surprises me that there are people who manage not to research obsessively. It&#39;s very sad that there are insurance companies and doctors that will prey on the people who don&#39;t research very much in order to make a quick buck. Again, thank you for creating the wiki, you&#39;ve undoubtedly helped so many people, and I personally feel that you helped stop me from making a mistake in choosing a surgeon. I imagine there are many others like me, especially young people, who happened to stumble across the wiki and were able to inform themselves on surgeons and what to look for instead of choosing the option that was &#34;pushed&#34; on them by their doctors with little to no reasoning.

I suspect the vast majority of people don&#39;t do much research, or can&#39;t find much if they try. And if you do find anything its hard to analyze it effectively, including what&#39;s here.

Would you mind linking your YouTube channel?

That&#39;s very true, but at least you can get an idea of results, patient opinions, aftercare, etc. It&#39;s too bad there aren&#39;t more objective ways to compare, but that doesn&#39;t really exist for a surgery with such a large aesthetic component or such an obscure surgery.
</p>
<p>
I can pm you a link, I don&#39;t really want to link this account to the channel. I&#39;m also not very active on it, I&#39;ve been pretty busy with school and work. I&#39;m hoping to document my experience traveling to Thailand for surgery with Dr. Bank next year, and if I do I&#39;ll probably make an account to post links on here. There aren&#39;t many (or any) videos of young people going to the Suporn clinic on youtube (probably because it&#39;s rarely covered by insurance), so hopefully my experience will be useful.

One thing we could do is simply find good trans content creators and post the link to the wiki in the comments. We could also ask them directly to mention it in the context of a video. I&#39;d be happy to do that.

<strong>
Not CIS
</strong>
<br>
<strong>
SRS isn&#39;t some magical surgery. The techniques today can give you a vulva and vagina, but it won&#39;t result in you having the average cis female vagina both the good and bad.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
In my experience this is 100% right and important to remember. My SRS genitals do not work the same way a cis woman&#39;s do. I have to dilate before having sex. I have to use lube for sex. I cannot accommodate a larger-than-average penis, and I have &#34;good depth&#34;. Clitoral stimulation is minimally effective. Orgasms are very hard to come by.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not at all the same thing, superficial similarities aside. It&#39;s not like the movies.

I think this makes a lot of assumptions. The thing with trans genitalia is that the variance is high. It&#39;s really hard to make assumptions about them. For instance:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have ~7.5/8 inches of depth. Most of the patients from my surgeon have depths around this point. That&#39;s sufficient for piv sex with like 95%+ of men. And its roughly the same depth that the average woman has when aroused.
</li>
<li>
I don&#39;t and will not have enough self-lubrication for piv sex though I do have some that is arousal based. However, there are plenty of cis women who dont either (especially if theyve had a full hysto). Also, even if I had been born a cis woman I would still have to use lube for piv sex - I have a presentation of lupus that would pretty much guarantee that fact. Lastly on this point, I know 2 people who are post op that do self lubricate to the point they can have piv sex assuming the guys they are with go slow and they are aroused.
</li>
<li>
Orgasms being hard to come by arent unusual for cis women either whether clitoral or vaginal. There&#39;s a lot of variance whether you are cis or trans. I&#39;m only ~3 months post op, but I have a lot of clitoral sensation (probably too much tbh). This isn&#39;t the default.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now yes, srs is not a perfect surgery no matter who performs it. There are risks. Serious and minor complications do occur. It is a brutal recovery with so many points where suboptimal care can influence results. And it is a good attitude to be grounded on the risks, but I think also not being jaded is important. You need hope if you are going to make it through the recovery process.
</p>
<p>
People are ridiculously harsh on what constitutes &#34;cis&#34; behavior/function for a vagina though. What they really are comparing it to is &#34;cis healthy behavior&#34;. And I kinda take offense to that. I have a medical condition that resulted in me having a nearly identical surgery as a cis woman with mrkh would have - why is my vagina fake but her&#39;s real? They should be judged on the same standards.

Exactly right about the variability.  I feel like something you need to accept when going into SRS is that you’re can’t completely control the final result.  Some elements of it are down to your surgeon, but a lot is also about your own anatomy and there’s not much that can be done about it.

Width isn&#39;t so much a problem, it stretches in that direction better, but they can&#39;t go as deep as they are used to. It has a very firm back wall.

There is!  I had a plain old penile inversion, and I lubricate like you wouldn&#39;t believe when I&#39;m aroused.  I have no idea what my surgeon did to make this magic happen, but it&#39;s definitely possible...
</p>

Though to be fair, he also told me that it&#39;s not really a thing, and I would only get a small amount of lubrication.  And yet I did...

God I didn&#39;t even know the difference between the clit.
</p>
<p>
Everyday I find out a new difference between cis and trans vulvas and it makes me panick and wanna die/self harm
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want a penis :( but I don&#39;t want a vulva like that either. I just want a cis vulva.
</p>
<p>
A lot of results I&#39;ve seen online have also scared me :(
</p>
<p>
I donno what to do. Wait hopelessly like a fool for a new method that&#39;s never coming out and wasting my whole life.
</p>
<p>
What the fuck did I do to deserve this. I wish I could go back into denial sometimes
</p>
<p>
And I&#39;ll never enjoy sex.... Never have the body I want

Great writeup!

(Isn’t SRS a dated term now though? I think the accepted term is Gender Confirmation Surgery or Genital Reconstructive Surgery. I may be wrong though.)

I like the term SRS, gender confirmation surgery is very general (FFS and BA are also GCSs), but genital reconstruction surgery could work. Personally though I use SRS in general contexts and vaginoplasty when discussing the specific surgery I&#39;m getting. It&#39;s all up to each person tho!

idk, I feel like &#34;SRS&#34; is invalidating because it&#39;s like saying you&#39;re being reassigned to a different sex rather than you&#39;ve always been the gender you are regardless of AGAB and presentation.

That&#39;s actually why I like it, because it&#39;s my sex organs that are changing not my gender. &#34;Gender reassignment surgery&#34; seems wrong because my gender isn&#39;t changing.

<p>
Use whatever term you like best though!

i prefer SRS because GRS reinforces the narrative that after medical transition and multiple surgeries trans people are still somehow exactly like their birth sex. there&#39;s no way a fully transitioned woman is similar to a cis man in really that many capacities. if anything, trans women would be pretty similar to cis females who have XY syndrome in terms of the components of their biological sex (especially the girls who started before or during puberty).

I guess it’s because people are still thinking that the R stands for “reassignment” instead of “reconstructive.” Let me make it more clear. I prefer the phrase “genital reconstructive surgery” to “sex reassignment surgery.”

I prefer SRS regardless though. if it stands for genital reconstruction I&#39;m fine with GRS. I still vehemently disagree with the idea that we don&#39;t change sex and that as a surgery it merely affirms a gender identity, the entire point is that we do, and in no way is a fully transitioned woman still sexually male.

I think you misunderstood my original point. My point was that trans people always were the sex/gender of their identity. The doctor who delivered them and diagnosed them as “it’s a boy” or “it’s a girl” misdiagnosed them solely based on the presence or lack of a penis. Trans women always were women. Trans men always were men. Surgery just aligns the body to the mind. Correcting a “birth defect” if you will.

Another perspective: HRT actually does more to change your sex than bottom surgery; so I don&#39;t love SRS as a term as it implies bottom surgery is required to change your sex, when functionally trans women&#39;s entire bodies are much more female functioning than male after some time on hrt.

There is a question I would add, to definitely ask your chosen surgeon, which is: &#34;Are you the one going to be doing the surgery and can you guarantee that no student will be working on me in your place?&#34;.

Just my opinion.  But if you’re over analyzing it this much (although fair and understandable) … I would just say don’t do it.
</p>
<p>
I thought I was an over analyzer. But this is next level… it’s a good indication you will probably never be pleased or happy with the result.
</p>
<p>
And the comment about “The techniques today ca give you a vulva and vagina, but it won’t result in (…) cis female vagina both the good and bad.” VERY MUCH INNACURATE. Don’t make statements that are simply not true. Out of all the vaginas you can find online. Most are not good. That small percentage isn’t representative of results as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Also the comment about hyper analyzing results and can tell which are SRS… if you’re talking about the pics online. Possibly, but the reality is most passable vaginas don’t get posted on here. No one wants their pretty puss blasted online.  This comment reminds me of ppl who always have shit to say about FFS results.  The girl could be cis and someone will still say , “you should fix this and that”.
</p>
<p>
Although educational, this post is very misleading and comes off negative in more than 1 way.
</p>
<p>
So again, Based on all this. I would reconsider srs.  Doesn’t seem like you’d be pleased either way. If you aren’t already.
</p>
<p>
Vaginas come in all shapes and colors. Plenty cis women have to dilate to accommodate or due to turners syndrome. Ppl  like myself need srs to correct anatomical issues. Like having Chromosomes that are (X or X0) (xxy). So when I read ppl saying you will never be CIS. It’s truly insulting.

I had surgery in July and am very happy with the result.
</p>
<p>
If I were to have sex with a guy, he would see just another “vagina” and we could have very enjoyable sex.  From his perspective, it is like any other.  From a medical perspective, there are differences.  And to pretend otherwise is foolish especially in a post like this that is trying to educate and set expectations for those who are learning and preparing for SRS.  I tried to use terms correctly throughout.  Vagina does not mean vulva etc.
</p>
<p>
A simple basic thing is that the majority of techniques today will not cause your vagina to get wet when you are aroused.  Your vulva, when aroused, can get wet, very wet  (have to change my underwear wet), but not the vaginal walls.  The walls in the majority of surgical outcomes don’t respond.  Being wet in your vulva can of course flow into your vagina.  As mentioned in the post and by others there are a bunch more.  Differences like these seem to catch others off guard and they come here posted devastated.  The worst misinformation has to be someone who came here two weeks after surgery asking if they really have to dilate.
</p>
<p>
Going into a major surgery like this with incorrect expectations can lead to bad depression at a time (after any surgery) when depression is easy to fall into.

I read through this and specifically got to the two parts about ball stretching and inner labial anatomy being a different developmental route from what becomes the extended urethra in a typical penis…
</p>
<p>
Could progressively heavier gauged urethral sounding with flexible silicone sounds (if sterilized and cleaned and changed and all that) be a route towards having more urethral tissue available for vaginoplasty down the line?
</p>
<p>
I ask because while ball stretching sounds like the most dysphoric thing I can imagine, I actually
<em>
like
</em>
sounding and can enjoy it and I know from experience that the urethral tissue is very sensate. And depending on the surgeon in question, I know that some do use urethral tissue for various things. Idk it just seems like something to think about?

I know men who’ve stretched their balls. It’s a thing that ppl can do. It creates more skin, which could be useful for SRS under certain circumstances (depending on what you’re using the scrotal tissue for). OP didn’t say it was standard or even suggested. Just that it can be done and laid out why one might want to do it.
</p>
<p>
For me? It depends on the surgery I get, the doctor I see, whether extra scrotal tissue is necessary or even useful for the surgery, and a million other things. I might thing about it. The idea of doing it makes me throw up (a lot) in my mouth, but like. If I’m willing to put myself through the hell of dilation and surgery and shit, I’m willing to make sure that I give the surgeon the best material I can so they can give me the best results they can.

Just WOW! This is the most complete and thoughtful post I’ve come across for this subject. I truly appreciate all that you wrote. I’m at the early statue of the thought process, trying to determine if I really want to take the risk and go through the ordeal of the surgery/recovery and the never ending dilation. This posts and all the supporting links will  help tremendously to sort out my thoughts.

Cancelled the appointment with Suporn and changed to another surgeon in Thailand due to the long recovery period, potential difficulties in dilation and scarring issues as a result of my genetic response and more sutures inside the vagina. There&#39;s a lot to consider and I have say you have to take into consideration your racial genetics.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have dysphoria specifically related to my genitalia. I chose to receive SRS mainly just for changing my ID and live easier. I live in a country where gender on IDs can only be changed after SRS. I live fulltime as a girl. Life would be difficult without my ID changed in this relatively conservative country. My surgery is scheduled in this November. I don&#39;t have high expectations for the surgery. I&#39;m more concerned with serious complications but don&#39;t really care depth or even appearance. I&#39;m 33 years old and don&#39;t desire any kind of sex activities. Other than legal status, some daily maintenance of the new genitalia or how to pee, I don&#39;t expect to change anything in my life.
