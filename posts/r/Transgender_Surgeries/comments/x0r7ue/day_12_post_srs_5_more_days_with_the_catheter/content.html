Just 4 days more for me to get mine out. Cause sometimes I feel like the pee it&#39;s gonna get out of my urethra and that feels like shit. And going to pop it&#39;s like and adventure. Like 1 hour on the toilet without pushing hard.

Good luck girl, you are doing great.  I spent the first two weeks with a catheter taken out and then reinserted.  Definitely an experience but I just kept telling myself that I was good, I was fine and I could do this.

... op literally had surgery 12 days ago. Any money says she&#39;s seen a doc within the last week.
</p>
<p>
That looks like a scab or simply a blood clot.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t look like anything other than someone who has had surgery recently. Just stop.

I cry for not being able to operate and I think I never will.  think positive and in what you have had the opportunity to realize a great dream.  be patient, recovery is slow, you probably have a bit of post op depression, it happens to a lot of people.  A hug

Don&#39;t cry and never say never. Idk you but if no one know what the future holds. So maybe someday you can get the surgery. And the depression, it&#39;s real. I&#39;m crying out loud everyday. Trying to harm myself, but I have to be patient. Hugs and kisses ‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôm sorry you cry when you‚Äôre alone.
</p>
<p>
I daresay we‚Äôve all cried our fair share of tears. Reach out in those moments. We might be half a world away, but you‚Äôre not alone as you feel, little sis. ü§ó

I was out quick though I had to wait a total of 7 days before I could go home I was walking fast by day 3 and I could pee when the catheter was loose which only happened once‚Ä¶ I could have bowl movements no problem the catheter came out day 7.  I could pee no problem already paid for the hotel for that day so I stayed the night and checked out when leaving for another appointment.
</p>
<p>
Oh and I was having orgasms by day 3 from the clitoris and vestibule ‚ô•Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
Day four was my hotel stay and I‚Äôll admit at night it didn‚Äôt take much pressure grind my labia together to get off since it‚Äôs what I wanted to be sure I could do hands free.
</p>
<p>
But it did help to have a pillow to keep comfortable with all the dressing at other times. I would ateast get wet from the vestibule but that was enough to keep on climaxing for a night granted I got little sleep but it was amazing Day one on dilation I‚Äôm already getting all the dots on the first dialator
