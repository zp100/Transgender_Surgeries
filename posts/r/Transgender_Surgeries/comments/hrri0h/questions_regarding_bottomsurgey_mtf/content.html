There are some women who report being able to cease all dilation years after surgery, but there’s been some evidence that those women are fairly rare. It’s best to plan that you’ll need to dilate for the rest of your life, or at least until you decide that you no longer want to engage in penetrative activities.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I’m 18 months post, and I had Dr Ting’s modified PIV technique (where my vaginal canal is augmented with peritoneal-like tissue harvested from my scrotum). I don’t have a sense that my canal is
<em>
fragile
</em>
, but I wouldn’t want to try rough/vigorous sex without ensuring I have adequate lubrication. As long as I’m lubed enough, I don’t have much concern.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Gender-affirming vaginoplasties typically harvest tissue from four main areas: the penis/scrotum, a skin graft (typically thigh or abdomen), peritoneum, and sigmoid colon. Depending on the surgeon, a single or multiple sources can be used. When it comes to lubrication, the penis/scrotum and skin grafts do not provide any self-lubrication. There is some evidence that peritoneum provides some lubrication, and more evidence that sigmoid colon provides lubrication. But peritoneum and colon tend to provide constant lubrication, not arousal-induced. For arousal-induced lubrication, the surgeon may preserve the Cowper’s glands, which can produce a small amount of fluid (think pre-cum). Many surgeons also incorporate a portion of urethral tissue left over from shortening the urethra into the construction of vaginal canal — the urethra is a mucous membrane and will provide a small amount of lubrication as well. The downsides to peritoneum and colon approaches is that the lubrication is constant, so for some women, they have to use pads to absorb excess fluid which comes out of their vaginas throughout the day. There are also reports that with the sigmoid colon, there can be a scent of feces, though for many women, this scent diminishes/disappears over time.
</p>

I’ve tried it, and it wasn’t earth-shattering for me. Pleasant, but not enough to reach climax on its own.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Douching is a possibility. Personally, I’ve never douched, and I’ve had no issues with anything accumulating in my vagina canal. That said, I also have a moderate amount of self-lubrication from Dr Tings technique, so I’ve noticed that excess lube will make its way out over time. For me it isn’t enough to wear a pad - my underwear is able to absorb whatever discharge I have, and I change my underwear regularly (no less than daily).

For some folks, a few years down the line, but don&#39;t count on it being an absolute. Some people find they can stop, others cannot. But dilating once or twice a week for 15 minutes really isn&#39;t that big of a deal, so I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much. Of course you can stop if you&#39;d like, but you risk losing depth.
</p>
</li>

I&#39;m 15 months post-op (penile inversion with Bowers&#39; most recent techniques), and I have a very active sex live. We have pretty vigorous sex, and I&#39;ve never been injured, nor do I feel like it&#39;s fragile. Everyone is different though, so that&#39;s something you&#39;ll have to figure out for yourself. I have heard that peritoneal techniques may be a bit more fragile due to the tissue used, but I don&#39;t know anything beyond that, and it would probably be better to discuss that with a surgeon if that&#39;s a technique you might pursue.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There are different techniques, but
<a href="/u/cirqueamy">u/cirqueamy</a>
already covered them pretty well. Self-lubrication is one area where there are limits, even with modern techniques. However, having to use lube during sex isn&#39;t a big deal,
<em>
tons
</em>
of cis women need to do it, and it&#39;s never interfered with my sex life at all. Again, one of those things you really don&#39;t need to worry about (after all, trans folks aren&#39;t the one keeping lube manufacturers in business!)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That&#39;s
<em>
highly
</em>
variable, whether you&#39;re cis or trans. Some cis women have such sensitive clitorises that something like that would be borderline painful. For others it feels great, and for some folks it doesn&#39;t really do anything. To me it feels pleasant, but not remotely enough to get off. I have a lot of clitoral sensation and have no problem having orgasms touching myself or using toys, but shower heads just don&#39;t really do anything for me.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Different surgeons have different recommendations. However, my surgeon (who was taught by Bowers and uses her aftercare instructions) stated that I could stop douching after all my incisions were pretty well healed, around the 4-month mark or so. I stopped at that point and have had zero issues whatsoever, and I&#39;m 15 months post-op with an active sex life. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for most folks, TBH (and neither does Marci Bowers, among other surgeons.)

Dilation is for life, but after initial healing and a few months of 3-4 daily dilations, you will eventually only need to dilate once a week unless sexually active. (Must still dilate for life because you can lose depth.)

There is a bottom surgery that can produce natural moisture but is unlikely to be as much as a CIS woman. (PPT vaginoplasty)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Uses part of the intestine. This surgery has high risk of complications.

PPT (peritoneal pull-through) doesn’t use part of the intestine and doesn’t have high risk of complications (though it is a newer technique).  You may be confusing it with the Sigmoid Colon technique.

Perhaps, but when searching for the peritoneal technique I get this description on multiple pages.

Douching in the early stages of healing/dilating will be required after each dilation to remove residual lube that is used during dilation to prevent infection.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Douching will later on only be required once a week along with the one session of required dilation.

Plenty of surgeons recommend not douching at all after the first few months. Bowers is one, as was mine -- I was told to stop after 4-5 months, once all of the incisions were well healed, and I haven&#39;t since. I&#39;m 15 months post-op and have zero issues, and I have a very active sex life.

I never douched in the early days of healing, in fact my surgeon recommended against it.  I douche occasionally if I feel the need, but the problem with douching (like in cis women) is that it washes all the healthy bacteria away and can lead to the growth of unhealthy or odorous bacteria.  It&#39;s a YMMV situation, it won&#39;t be the end of the world if you don&#39;t douche because many individuals post-operatively don&#39;t have the need to.
