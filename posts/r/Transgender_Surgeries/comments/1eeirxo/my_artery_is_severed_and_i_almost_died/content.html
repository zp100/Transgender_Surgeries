I was supposed to get a jaw feminization and in one of those procedures was mandable shaving, according to my doctor, my Artery got in the way of his mechanical saw and it got ruptured, i lost a lot of blood to the point i was close to death. It felt like drowing in the most deepest coldest ocean, it felt comforting, I did not want to come back to life but I don&#39;t know who donated blood but I&#39;m alive because of them.
</p>
<p>
But when I woke up I was in so much pain I was begging for death. Plus I was also begging for that blood to get into me as I stared at that blood transfusion bag, breathing and moving me eyes to look at things was a pain, it was like weakness during fever but multiplied 1000x times. I was so weak I did not want to breathe, I just wanted to give up.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got the most painful 4 weeks of my life, the swelling was as big as a tennis ball on my left neck. I couldn&#39;t open my mouth fully, couldn&#39;t eat, couldn&#39;t drink, couldn&#39;t sleep, couldn&#39;t swallow, couldn&#39;t turn my head.
</p>
<p>
The dissolvable stitches inside my cheeks keeps leaking out the rotten blood and all of that pungent pus and it stenches to the point i gag. Im unable to push out all of the pus and it looks like hematoma situation there. Ice packs or hot water packs or painkillers won&#39;t ever heal me, I&#39;m so frustrated to the point i wished i died in that surgery.
</p>
<p>
Im back home bedridden, and I&#39;m thinking of going to an ER by calling an emergency number for health because I&#39;m currently at my limit, but I&#39;ve overdosed myself in pain killers to the point my stomach burns in a very uncomfortable way.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to post this to know what I could have done to avoid such a mess (besides getting a surgery from that doctor) in medical wise, like a certain medicine or certain food that could&#39;ve speed up my healing process and reduced my swelling
</p>
<p>
UPDATE:  I just visited the ER yesterday and they told me that the lump of swelling I have is Asepsis, it evolved from hematoma. And my gosh it grows. It stretches my neck and I couldn&#39;t speak. I was salivating due to the pain and swallowing that was hell. OMG y&#39;all... I wouldn&#39;t wish this on my worst enemy. The waiting time I had to endure, and the tests I have to go through, enduring the pain made me cry I couldn&#39;t breathe or talk like a normal person, I was so weak from the pain, the dissolvable stitches were almost healed and it prevented me from having the pus out and it was trapped in there collecting more pus and expanding more, squeezing my nerves and arteries and pushing and pressing my teeth and jaw and throat choking me.
</p>
<p>
So the doctors there had only one fear we all shared, if the pus infects my bone, they will have to remove my jaw. I&#39;ve been feeling the pains from my teeth and jaw and I thought it was too late to the point I had an emotional breakdown. And I really wanted to have all of that drained. But the doctors told me it&#39;s a bad idea if I rush. They can&#39;t tell if they&#39;ll be able to stop the bleeding untill they know for certain what&#39;s going on in there, they had to get an ultrasonic sound and MRI and CT and Xray scans, and my gosh the amount of time I had to wait for my turn to get them scanned was hell, everyone was suffering cuz of course it is a hospital I&#39;m in, and I waited 14 hours to get all my tests done and the next day was my surgery.
</p>
<p>
And after the tests, I cried in happiness cuz it&#39;s not infected my bone or my Arteries or any of my nerves, they just need to drain my pus and keep the wound open so it keeps draining and they gotta clean and dress it everyday regularly, untill I heal.
</p>
<p>
So what caused this hell in the first place was me not being ready for the surgery. I am 5&#39;3 and I&#39;m 25 and my weight is 47 kgs. I&#39;m severely underweight, and I rushed the surgery despite the doctor warning me that there are risks, my dysphoria clouded my thinking, and I didn&#39;t listen to him or my friends. It was an arterial gauge that caused the infection and when they were trying to stop the bleeding.
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;m just waiting for my healing and my discharge.

court cases and judgement takes years (7+)
<br>
theres also corruption, lack of information, and from personal experience what people can improve on is the accountability. Literally nobody takes accountability in india so you will end up just running to court from one person to another because theres no real accountable person who can help (most of the time but you can always get ahead if you have money)
<br>
Plus theres a lot of bad doctors in general and its almost generalized as a thing that can happen and has no fault of the doctor or whatever.

Are you on antibiotics? If there&#39;s pus leaking out of your wounds  and you can&#39;t clean them out you might need to be in the hospital, especially given the other trauma. Sepsis is no joke.

I agree with this. If you are not in a hospital please get to one. Preferably a different place than you went to for the surgery if this happened there.
</p>
<p>
Im sorry you went through this, I hope you get better! ❤️

Sometimes when people are near death, they gain some transient sensory memory, even on anesthesia, in addition, memories formed during the transient journey towards full consciousness can be interpreted as occurring earlier due to the disruption to the body&#39;s sense of time.  Those phonomena seem to fit the story as narrated by OP.

are you taking antibiotics and currently under medical care ? if not you should go to the ER asap. it isnt normal for you to be leaking pus and blood at this point and you could get sepsis if not properly taken care of...
</p>
<p>
i had my ffs 4 months ago and had extreme swelling and minor complications, and regarding swelling unfortunately theres not much to do. switch to stronger painkillers, avoid any anti inflammatory, drink a lot of water and diuretics (coffee is good) to help get rid of excess fluids. ice it. take walks if you are physically able to, but dont strain yourself. otherwise, standing up as much as you can is an alternative.
</p>
<p>
however, please please please get your cheeks checked by a doctor asap !!!!
</p>
<p>
Ps : your surgeon really fucked up big time and you really didnt deserve any of this. Try to remember underneath the swelling and the pain is your future pretty face 🩷 and you will soon enough get to see what you new face will look like healed !!! so dont give up ! do your best, show yourself love and take care of yourself !!

OMG.. Just by reading it I am getting goosebumps, I really don&#39;t know how you manage to go through this ordeal.. Anyhow I strongly suggest you to get yourself checked in ER and go for 2nd, 3rd advice immediately. Please don&#39;t think about it, please get yourself checked ASAP.

I’ve read so many bad stories about surgeons in India I would never get operated there. If money’s an issue South America has much better options for reasonable prices.

If you mean arnica, then suggesting homeopatic, at best placebo, at worst toxic substance is ill placed advice.
</p>
<p>
OP if you suspect overdose, please call ER immediately.

Dr Hanna had me take Arnica Montana for 3 days before and 3 days after my bottom surgery as part of his protocol to reduce swelling.
</p>
<p>
Of the 3 surgeries I had last year, recovery from that one was by far the easiest.

Look I probably agree with you on the broader point, but you&#39;re misusing the term homeopathy and your credibility suffers as a result.

No they aren&#39;t. Arnica is very liver toxic when taken internally, so the only arnica tablets you can buy are, in fact, homeopathic (and, thus, nothing more than placebo). Why are you talking about credibility lol

Dr Hanna uses it as part of his protocol to reduce swelling. Nothing to do with scars.
