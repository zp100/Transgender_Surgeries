<p>
I am now three weeks post-op after getting PPT vaginoplasty with Dr. Wittenberg, and am preparing to go back home this. So, I figured I&#39;d share some reflections that I&#39;ve had over the past few weeks. . My goal is to include some information that I haven&#39;t read on this sub yet (though I may have just missed it). I believe that emotionally preparing for this surgery is very important, and so I will point out certain things that I think it is helpful to be prepared for. A couple of things before I begin:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have a fairly high pain tolerance. If you don&#39;t, some of this advice might not apply to you.
</li>
<li>
I&#39;m still pretty early into recovery, and my thoughts might change over time.
</li>
<li>
Your mileage may vary in general.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>
Bolster/First Week after Hospital Discharge
</em>
</p>
<p>
Part of Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s technique is that she leaves a bolster sown over your vagina after surgery until your first post-op visit. As other people have pointed out, this may be part of why Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s technique is one step and is able to get such consistent results.
</p>
<p>
With that said, the bolster sucks. It is sown into your skin, and it essentially ties your legs together. This seriously limits your mobility while wearing it, makes using the restroom more difficult and painful, and it stinks (there is some sort of liquid in the gauze that I couldn&#39;t stand the smell of). It also means that you have to go over a week before you can see the results of the surgery for the first time. This part sucked more than I realized it would - by the end of the week, I started getting anxious that something was going wrong under the bolster, and that I wouldn&#39;t even be able to tell until the first post-op appointment. If you&#39;re preparing for surgery with Dr. Wittenberg, I&#39;d recommend thinking about how this will effect you for the first week.
</p>
<p>
This, along with drugs and other mental effects of surgery, will mean that you will have to rely on your caregivers for so many things, from getting you water to keeping track of medicine to potentially  helping you use the bathroom. Make sure that you bring along someone who you are comfortable with and who you trust, if you can. It will also mean that this is the week with the heaviest bedrest. Especially if you&#39;re staying at someone else&#39;s home, think of ways to keep yourself entertained, to make sure that you can eat in bed, etc.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Dilation
</em>
</p>
<p>
After the first week of surgery and when the bolster is removed, you get to see your results for the first time and you start dilating. I started with an initial depth of ~16 cm (yay!!), and I have not lost any depth yet. From how my experiences match up with what I have read about dilation for those who got the PI technique, there are a few ways that dilating after PPT is different (though this could do more with how my body has healed. Again, YMMV!).
</p>
<p>
First, there was very little pain or blood from dilation from the very beginning. The only pain I have ever experienced from dilation so far was from the outside of my vagina for the first few days. I have not felt any pain from the inside of my vagina. Others have suggested that the actual PPT portion of the surgery heals a bit faster than the rest of the of the vulva, and that matches up with my experiences, though I&#39;m not sure how accurate that is generally.
</p>
<p>
Second, when dilating, it usually takes a bit of time to get to full depth. When I first insert the dilator, I feel the sensation that I&#39;ve reached the end of my vagina at least 4-5 cm before the depth that I got during my initial dilation and where I can generally achieve overall. Once I get that feeling, I have to apply firm (but not painful or pushing) pressure for a minute or two to open the last few centimeters back up.  I won&#39;t stop paying attention to do something else or start my timer until I get to at least the first notch on the bottom of the soul source dilator. I know that a lot of people tend to lose depth with PPT. I don&#39;t know if the way that I&#39;ve been going about dilating has been helping not to lose depth or it just hasn&#39;t been long enough to lose depth yet, but I figured I&#39;d share it with you all either way.
</p>

<em>
Second and Third Week General Reflections
</em>
</p>
<p>
For the most part, I&#39;ve found the second and third weeks easier than the first week. I don&#39;t really don&#39;t have a lot to say here that hasn&#39;t been said, I think.  There is a ton of swelling to deal with in the first week, though. If you&#39;re not used to swelling pains, it sucks a little bit. It&#39;s one of those things that you can just constantly feel, and it makes walking and finding a comfortable position to lay in difficult. The swelling steadily decreased over the week though (ice helps, folks), and it doesn&#39;t having the feeling that it&#39;s swollen much anymore (though it definitely still is).
</p>
<p>
Part of the struggle of these two weeks is just how unknown everything is. There are stitches everywhere, there are weird pains that are hard to identify because all the nerves are freaked out, and  nothing is quite in the right place yet. It can sometimes be hard to convince yourself that what you&#39;re looking at isn&#39;t indicative the final result (for me, one the consistent worries that I&#39;ve had is that my clitoris won&#39;t set properly under the clitoral hood). Also, I keep having weird pains while peeing because I&#39;m not used to using the muscles in the same way anymore.
</p>
<p>
That said, for me, mobility has drastically increased these two weeks. I can get out of bed more often, shower, go downstairs every once in a while, etc. I recently started being able to sit again without discomfort. Also, mental clarity completely returned to normal at the beginning of the second week. All of that helps immensely with feeling more normal again ime.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Closing/Other Thoughts
</em>
</p>
<p>
There are two real thoughts that I have to close off with:
</p>
<p>
First, I think it&#39;s hard to state exactly how it feels to wake up and realize that this surgery is permanent and that it will take a long time to heal. I don&#39;t regret the permanency of the surgery by any means, but there is something a little overwhelming that you can&#39;t go back on the pain, the recovery, or the surgery itself to some degree. I think it&#39;s important before surgery to think about how long things will be healing for. The area will constantly hurt for some time, whether that is a slight annoyance or severe pain. It can take three full months for the majority of the swelling to go down, and there will still be some swelling left even then. It can also take three months or more for the stitches to dissolve or push their way out. Even after all of that, some people don&#39;t feel much in their clitoris for several months after surgery. Be prepared for the long game here. Be ready to wait a long time to see a &#34;final&#34; result.
</p>
<p>
With that said, I&#39;m already so happy that I decided to go through with this surgery. Especially now that swelling has started to go back down, it just feels so great to look in the mirror or shower and not see something dangling between my legs. I almost cried the first time that I saw what it&#39;s like to be flat between my legs and when I tried on pants again for the first time. For me, it really has been worth every second and every dime. If you have bottom dysphoria, it is so hard to describe what it&#39;s like for most of that to dissipate (YMMV. I still do experience some bottom dysphoria, and I don&#39;t know when/if that will go away). After going through all of this, it is so easy to see why this is a life saving and medically necessary surgery. I hope that the rhetoric otherwise won&#39;t dissuade you from getting it on your own.
</p>

Thank you for sharing; especially about the mental stuff. Surgery seems really scary but it feels helpful to hear people who have been through it talk about it.

I&#39;m happy for you! But I think the way you describe made me feel more confident that I went ahead with PI. My recovery was very easy and almost pain free. I used morphine only the first night, Tylenol next day, and no painkillers afterwards. The dilation schedule is a bit exhausting, but I take it as a crash course to catch up with my vagina after so much of waiting.
</p>
<p>
Speedy recovery!

Thank you! I don&#39;t mean to make you question your choice to go with PI (it&#39;s a great and totally defensible choice!). However, there is no difference in technique between PI and PPT for anything but the vaginal canal. (For Dr. Wittenberg, the dilation schedule doesn&#39;t differ between PI and PPT either!)
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to give off the wrong impression that I was ever in a ton of pain. Like I said, I have quite a high pain tolerance and have felt very little pain over this whole process. I mostly just wanted to point out where there has been annoying/constant pain, especially since that is more likely to be painful for other people than it was for me (and some of the emotional/mental challenges of the surgery).

Thank you! If I could pinpoint the pain source after the surgery, it was mostly the cord stumps. And the area where the catheter was didn&#39;t feel pleasant. I&#39;d imagine these sources would be universal in both approaches.

Thank you for bringing these up! I completely forgot to mention the catheter (which is very uncomfortable on its own). For those who are reading that haven&#39;t had surgery and/or who have never had a catheter, there are a few things that make it uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
First, you have to keep the bag underneath your bladder at all times (which is harder than it sounds). If you accidentally raise it above your bladder, it pushes air into your bladder, which feels very strange and sometimes made me nauseous. Second, you have to drink a lot of water after surgery, and you therefore have to empty the catheter bag fairly often. Sometimes my caregiver would empty this bag for me into a container the hospital gave me, which is a little awkward. Other times, I would empty it on my own into the toilet. For me, it was really difficult to do this without raising the bag above my bladder. I&#39;d recommend bringing some alcohol swabs to clean the tip on the bag that you use to empty it.
</p>
<p>
â€‹
</p>
<p>
By &#34;cord stumps,&#34; do you mean stitch knots? If so, those can be pretty uncomfortable too. There&#39;s not much that I&#39;ve found to reduce pain here, unfortunately. You kind of just have to wait for it to push its way out or dissolve.

Re the urine bag. That&#39;s strange that you had to do it. I never touched it. The urine drained into those bags that were on the floor. Hospital stuff took care of them. They never raised bags above my level.
</p>
<p>
Re cord stumps. It&#39;s whatever is left from the spermatic cords after I lost 2 evil twins. Those stumps gave me problems about 1-2 months after. But that&#39;s a different story.

So far, the dysphoria has probably all come from the way things look before everything is fully healed. For example, the bolster and the swelling creating more of a bulge than I&#39;d like. Also, all of the stitches and the weird placement of things due to swelling give me a bit of dysphoria, too. Because its still looks a lot like a surgery site, it&#39;s easy for my dysphoria to pick out what&#39;s different about it from a cis vagina.
</p>
<p>
That said, the dysphoria is sooo different, and it is very diminished. Unlike before surgery, most of the time, I don&#39;t feel any dysphoria around my genitals at all. It just happens from time to time now.

Thank you for posting this! If you don&#39;t mind me asking, were you able to go up and down stairs normally during and after week 1? I&#39;m getting PPT with Wittenberg next year and am trying to figure out lodging but the friends I&#39;d stay with have all of their bedrooms upstairs.

Of course! I&#39;m glad so many people are finding it useful
</p>
<p>
I did not try to go up and down the stairs during my first week except to get into the house and to the bedroom. Because of how the bolster keeps your legs together, I was worried about tripping. After the first week, I could definitely go up and down the stairs more often, but it&#39;s still been limited. Every time that I go up or down the stairs, things get more swollen. So, for the second week, I usually only went downstairs when I could spend some time down there. I would not go downstairs for every meal. For the third week, though, the swelling has gotten a lot better, and I&#39;ll go downstairs for meals or when I need to get more ice.
</p>
<p>
In all, it&#39;s obviously super hard to avoid stairs in SF. If you have caregivers that can help you avoid stairs when you need to, I think it&#39;s pretty manageable to stay in an upstairs bedroom.

That makes sense. Thank you for such an in-depth reply! This was like the one thing that I couldn&#39;t find info on no matter where I looked.
</p>
<p>
Could I ask if you went outside much during the first 3 weeks? Or did you just stay upstairs and only go down for necessary stuff?

I unfortunately chose a pretty poor surgery date as far as getting outside goes. Between the fires and COVID, there were more reasons to stay inside than the stairs and recovery (waking up to midnight light at 8 AM and a deep orange sky was.... fun). So, I&#39;ve mostly stayed inside during recovery, and I have mostly only gone downstairs for necessary stuff.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re not dealing with smoke (and hopefully COVID will get better, too), I think that you could go outside every day or multiple times a day, even with the stairs. Dr. Wittenberg limits walking to two blocks at a time, three times a day. I think adding stairs to that limits how many blocks you can walk. Also, if you&#39;re going down the stairs to go outside, that may also limit how many time you will want to go downstairs for necessary things. It&#39;s all a balancing game that depends a lot on your swelling.

Thank you so much commenting! I&#39;m so glad that you found this post helpful :) Huge congrats on your surgery date, and I wish you well in your recovery. Waiting for surgery is hard, especially with the uncertainty that COVID brings. Try to remember that the surgery date will come. It&#39;s not the endless tunnel of waiting that it seems to be!

i had ppt with dr wittenberg and im 2 weeks post op rn! i actually snipped the bolster off with fingernail clippers like 5 days after surgery because it was bothering me too much. my caretaker actually had to leave after the first week so i&#39;ve been alone for a bit now lol. also i&#39;ve been walking a lot and my right labia came separated from the left labia so i guess it&#39;ll heal kinda funny now. that&#39;s life i guess, a rocky road! it was so tight yesterday, now today it feels so loose. i thought my pussy was gonna be hot but i guess it&#39;s not hot anymore. there&#39;s nothing i can do i guess. i feel kinda dumb but i guess that&#39;s just me being a dumbass as always.  if you wanna dm i&#39;m open to it.
</p>
<p>
edit: also i tried to dilate my urethra like a fucking dumbass. apparently i&#39;m just dumb.

Thank you so much for writing for this!  I  schedules with Dr Wittenberg next month. Do you possibly have an update?  How has your experience been in the last three years?
