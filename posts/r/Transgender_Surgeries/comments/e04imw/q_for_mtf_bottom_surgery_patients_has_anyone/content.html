i actually clicked on an ad for a think called the toto washlet (i have no affiliation with them) and am thinking &#34;golly! that might actually be pretty awesome for during recovery.  I might make it a Christmas gift idea for me should anyone ask :)

My surgeon&#39;s off the cuff answer was &#34;maybe after about 6 weeks, can discuss during follow-up&#34; I suspect that immediately post-op the area will be pretty sensitive, and wouldn&#39;t want to spray fresh incisions with poop water by accident either.

I don’t know about the bidet but I was taught to use the ubiquitous “bum gun” and hen I had mine in Thailand.  It was a big help

This maybe too TMI but I often go shit to shower post op since my bathroom is too small for a bidet. I find that it helps to prevent getting unsightly rashes by making sure I’m totally clean. Of course I wouldn’t do this pre-6 weeks as per your surgeon.

Hello tussie is an alternative but you could also just get a good detachment shower head. Just remember to clean your bathtub too.

They&#39;d probably be great after your incisions have healed, but I&#39;d be concerned about potentially forcing bacteria into still-healing incisions prior to that. My surgeon gave me a sitz bath that fit over my toilet and that was fantastic for soaking the area to sooth it, but I don&#39;t know if a bidet would be a good idea earlier on.

Your surgeon will provide instructions when it comes to that stuff. You don&#39;t need to overthink it though: gently washing the outside when you shower, and maybe occasionally douching with water for a little while. This is really all that&#39;s usually necessary, although some surgeons may suggest using something like Betadine for a while too (although mine didn&#39;t, and Marci Bowers wrote their recovery instructions.)
</p>
<p>
You want to avoid doing much to the surgical site for a while, because you want to avoid disturbing the incisions and sutures as much as possible. Honestly, with as sore as it as for the first few weeks, you&#39;re probably not even going to feel like touching it much anyways.

I got a nice electric bidet shortly before my surgery as a gift to myself. It was an absolute life changer and is my favorite thing I own. But I actually had to stop using it for a little after getting GRS, was just too sensitive. Back on it now. Figured out how to use the turbo button to give myself an enema. I feel so clean now. So happy.
