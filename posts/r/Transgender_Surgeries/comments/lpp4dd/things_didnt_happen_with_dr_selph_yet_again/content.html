I&#39;ve been strung along by Dr. Selph, Dr. Keith, and Dr. Gallagher. I was originally supposed to get surgery in August. Most recently, it was supposed to be today.
</p>
<p>
YET AGAIN, I found out at the LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE that surgery with Dr. Selph isn&#39;t happening.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve lost an awesome job, my mental health has been ruined, and so much more, all because this never actually fucking happens. Something always gets in the way.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not even sure what this time. Last I heard from Selph a week ago, the 22nd was definitely a go and nothing would stop it, and I had to call the hospital a bunch yesterday and today to try to confirm, only to find out it was not at all on the schedule.
</p>
<p>
These surgeons want me to die.

That absolutely sucks. I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;ve lost several jobs due to needing time off for surgeries, but I can&#39;t imagine the pain you&#39;re experiencing without the procedures being able to happen.

This characterization of Dr. Selph sounds bogus.  He is my surgeon and has provided excellent care for me.  He has done the same for the 9 or 10 people whom I know and who have had surgery with him.  The details in this post do not fit the way the processes work with Dr. Selph and with UAB Medical Center.  Dr. Selph has provided excellent communication. He responds promptly to all my messages.  I&#39;ve only had one appointment cancelled with Dr. Selph and that was last week during the winter storms.  And I was the one who cancelled because the driving would be too treacherous.  I&#39;m offended that such a good surgeon is being maligned.

No patient should have to call 5xs a day for 2weeks to get a call back from your surgeons office and yes we left VMs daily. If that‚Äôs normal go for it! That‚Äôs the treatment I got so did a few other girls.

Dr. Selph always seems nice and helpful... when I actually hear from him. And then nothing for over a week.
</p>
<p>
Glad you had a better experience than me, but this just feels like gaslighting.

I have been working with Dr. Selph for over a year.  If you had a surgery date scheduled, he would have personally met with you for a pre-surgery consultation 10-14 prior to your surgery date to address any questions or concerns you may have.  In addition the UAB Medical Center
<strong>
requires
</strong>
you make an appointment to go to
<strong>
their facility
</strong>
and get a Covid-19 test within 72 prior to the scheduled surgery.  If you didn&#39;t have both of these appointments scheduled, then you would have been unable to have surgery performed at UAB Medical Center.  When there was an issue with my scheduled surgery that may have required the date to be postponed or rescheduled, Dr. Selph called me on my mobile phone on a Saturday afternoon to discuss it with me and work out a solution. Our solution was to continue with the scheduled surgery date. Of the 9 or 10 people whom I regularly communicate with, and who have either had surgery or have a surgery date scheduled with Dr. Selph, I have heard no problems such as the ones you described.

I was told I could do the pre-surgery consultation much closer to the surgery date because of how much the delays with Dr. Keith were taking a toll on me mentally, either the morning of or the day before. This is NOT normal and was a special exception.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve not heard anything about the COVID test from anyone, and they also didn&#39;t tell me about needing a urine culture test until way later in the process than they should.
</p>
<p>
This was all meant to fit me in an expedited fashion in recognition of how Dr. Keith&#39;s repeated delays created a mental health crisis for me.
</p>
<p>
I genuinely believe Selph cares, but other people involved aren&#39;t communicating as necessary. He does NOT communicate these problems to me directly. Despite trying to contact him repeatedly, I only hear from him about once every week-and-a-half.

I&#39;m not calling anyone a liar.  I am relating my experience and the experiences of other patients of Dr. Selph. (We may be in the same Discord group. You should be able to easily figure out who I am.)  I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &#34;the same problem&#34;.  I will acknowledge that the woman who does the initial surgery scheduling for Dr. Selph (and a couple of other doctors) can be hard to get hold of.  That is certainly frustrating and has been reported by a number of people, including me. However, once the surgery date is scheduled, she is no longer involved in the process. I&#39;m not sure about them making &#34;picks&#34;.  You&#39;re making an assumption to justify your experience.  I suspect that is just a problem with the surgery scheduler and getting that surgery date scheduled.  And I doubt they necessary like me.  I&#39;m quite outspoken with Dr. Selph.  I&#39;ve been accused of being &#34;picky&#34;, when it comes to my medical treatment.

You absolutely insinuated that I lied, saying that you were &#34;offended&#34; that I was &#34;maligning&#34; him.
</p>
<p>
I&#34;ve been in contact with Dr. Selph directly but do not hear things from him for over a week at a time.
</p>
<p>
If you can get in contact with him so easily, tell him to stop jerking around Thorne.

I messaged Dr. Selph in the patient portal back in November I have yet to get a response from him my insurance company was going to attempt to pay for my surgery if he would give me a Medical referral and I have yet to hear from him so I figured that‚Äôs my sign to stay away from him.  I stand by what I said they have a pick for who they want to help!

I‚Äôm not sure why some of y‚Äôall are getting offend by these peoples experiences? If that‚Äôs what they experienced than that‚Äôs what they experienced we all don‚Äôt go through the same thing. People can act one way to someone that‚Äôs positive and someone may have a negative interaction with someone. I can‚Äôt believe that some of y‚Äôall would go to bat for a doctor instead of asking or trying to help this person. Like is this a trans community‚Äôs Reddit or a bashing people for your favorite doctor? Like some of you need to check yourselves and what your saying. I on the other hand appreciate you telling your experience. I will keep this in mind and definitely have my eyes open because I want to speak with him myself but I will have others in mind now too.

I‚Äôm not sure if I do want to see him honestly but I will speak I just won‚Äôt be expecting much. I‚Äôm sorry nothing has changed for you and this doctor. I really am. I wish there were more that I can do but the only thing it appears to do is look at other surgeons. Maybe make a YouTube video about your experience at his office. I‚Äôm sure a lot of trans woman in the Alabama would love to know because I didn‚Äôt even know that we had a doctor who could preform this surgery in this state. It could help warn people but also if they are willing to take that chance reach out to him.

That&#39;s what I would do. I was originally planning on going to a different surgeon than I did. Early in the process, I could tell that the office didn&#39;t have there act together and I couldn&#39;t get a date scheduled. In the end, I switched to a marvelous surgeon and had surgery in November. Not going to the first surgeon was a blessing. I&#39;m so happy with how it turned out.
</p>
<p>
My advice is to find a new surgeon. This surgeon doesn&#39;t deserve you as a patient. They clearly don&#39;t understand the mental impact these starts and stops have on their patients or they don&#39;t care.

You could keep working with your current surgeon while you start the process with another. There are some great surgeons with reasonable wait lists.

Just a quick suggestion. I don&#39;t know why you keep waving this flag of death, but it doesn&#39;t bode well for your emotional stability in any context. I can only imagine you dropping this line on a GRS surgeon in a consult. The first thing they will probably do is cross your name of their To Do list. They are assessing your mental health and capacity to consent to surgery when you meet with them. This desperation doesn&#39;t help your case, no matter how serious you are. Surgeons have plenty of issues they have to deal with and I&#39;m not here to defend them. It&#39;s unlikely they will want to take unnecessary risk based on questionable mental health issues.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not diagnosing you or saying your any less nutty than the rest of us or that you have &#34;issues&#34;. However, you&#39;re words about suicide are triggering to the medical professionals and gatekeepers evaluating your ability to handle the treatment options they provide. Surgery falls within that bucket of options.

I&#39;ve discussed my mental health with Dr. Selph, and both of my mental health letter writers have covered this in their letters.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: why the fuck am I being downvoted about this?
</p>
<p>
This is a 6 year struggle for me with 2 suicide attempts, and I&#39;ve covered all of this extensively and I have mental health professionals backing me up. This seriously isn&#39;t the problem for Selph or Keith.
</p>
<p>
It is for Gallagher, but oh well. There are surgeons who absolutely are understanding, and I&#39;d rather have one who understands than keep them in the dark.

I don&#39;t know your history and I don&#39;t doubt that you&#39;ve struggled with this for 6 years. And I sure the hell wouldn&#39;t defend Gallagher. Frankly, if she she told you straight up it was an issue. At least she was honest about it so you know where you stand with her. If I remember correctly she was going to be your savior and do surgery after Keith backed out.
</p>
<p>
How exactly did your mental health issues enter into the situation with Gallagher that drove her decision to bail out? You don&#39;t even have to answer that it&#39;s no ones business. Obviously it happened. She made her decision based on what you provided whether it was written or spoken. I think the other two are doing the same thing. they just aren&#39;t being upfront with you to avoid some kind of conflict. I say this based on my own experience with surgeons gaslighting the shit out of me. Gallagher being the Master of the Torch, AFAIK.

If that‚Äôs the case do you think Dr. Selph Knows this? Or are there other bad faith actors here?

Dr. Selph knows. I keep speaking to him directly about a week or two before a supposed date and then nothing until that date passes.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s happened for months, and it never changes, despite Selph himself reassuring that things won&#39;t get delayed again.

You need to get all of the instructions in writing. The pre-op directions, the times to show up, the location, the procedures etc. If you say the insurance already approved it then all you&#39;ve have to do is look at the approved surgery date and location. They don&#39;t issue an approval that span weeks. It&#39;s for a specific procedure, on a specific day, and in a specific location. They do this because all of those things impact the cost of the procedure. It should be easy enough to contact your insurance carrier and ask for this approval information.

I&#39;ve contacted my insurance company on numerous occasions before.
</p>
<p>
Approval doesn&#39;t mean shit when the hospital doesn&#39;t follow through. It literally *was* approved for this afternoon.
</p>
<p>
What &#34;span of weeks&#34; are you talking about? I&#39;ve always gotten specific dates and told to arrive early in the morning for surgery in the afternoon.

Now you are being obtuse.
</p>
<p>
After you have a consult, your surgeon sends the paperwork to your insurance for pre-approval. That pre-approval will have a target surgery date on it. You&#39;re insurance company then says Yea or Nay to the approval and sends you and your surgeons office a letter stating the surgery is approved for a specific date and the location where the surgery will be performed. You&#39;re surgeon is likely to supply the time on that day for you to show up. They will probably use the insurance approval information to provide you a letter providing detailed pre-op instructions blah blah blah.
</p>
<p>
Are you with me here?
</p>
<p>
If the surgery doesn&#39;t go down as approved the insurance company can deny the claim. it&#39;s that simple. They make this clear in the approval details. So all this --just show up here, then two weeks later, then two weeks later, requires a new approval. Do you have an approval letter from the insurance company or Dr. Selph? This would be something a lawyer might ask for when you explain your case.

Yes, insurance has to and does re-authorize every time. I&#39;ve communicated with them extensively.
</p>
<p>
Are you with me here?
</p>
<p>
One time it got delayed in January was because there were delays in getting it approved with my new 2021 insurance, which was a different carrier than when they got it approved in 2020, which required working out a lot from scratch again.
</p>
<p>
Every new date has required a new insurance authorization, though, yes.

I&#39;m guessing the 22nd came and went with no explanation why no one showed up to operate? If my surgeon stood me up like that I&#39;d camp out in front of their office and wait for an explanation. Forget the phone. Go over to his office and ask them what the hell is going on?

I get the impression he rolls over a lot when the people above him at UAB put any pressure on him. I hear great things about his surgical ability, but the communication sucks, and he&#39;s not an advocate for his patients.
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m caught in an infinite loop in dates two weeks or so being picked that there isn&#39;t proper follow-up for.

I‚Äôm sorry, this cancelation can‚Äôt be helpful for you in any way.
</p>
<p>
So, can you walk us through what happened since you heard from Dr. Selph last week. Had you already done the pre-surgery or pre-anesthesia appointment and a COVID test? Did they give you any pre-op instructions or forms to sign? Did they tell you someone would contact you the day before surgery with a time to be there?
</p>
<p>
Walk us through this so we might be able to see where it went wrong.

I was just told to show up this morning with surgery this afternoon. I thought everything else was squared away, other than that I needed to do preoperative fasting. They don&#39;t do bowel prep, especially given they use robots.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t left home in almost a year, and they seemed surprisingly lax about the COVID side of things given that, maybe in part because it was AL?
</p>
<p>
One of the reasons I&#39;ve kept rescheduling with Selph in AL is every time other places fuck things up, the COVID problem makes things worse of a delay.

Apparently they do require a COVID test 72 hours before surgery. His assistant (T****a) should have provided you with the surgery date and time to arrive. Did you talk to his assistant about this to see what happened? It just feels awfully casual that Dr. Selph would say ‚Äújust show up in the morning‚Äùas in get there whenever you want for surgery. None of this fits the way he normally operates. I‚Äôm just wondering if someone or whomever you‚Äôre speaking with is not the people you think they are.

Been there done that! I would not recommend Dr Selph at this point to anyone! It‚Äôs not him but it‚Äôs the staff at UAB. I‚Äôve been discriminated against twice. The last time it was so badly I filed a report with a patient advocate and nothing was done to the employee. If you want to be disrespected go to UAB!

I would suggest reaching out to Vanderbilt plastic surgery in Nashville, TN. Dr. Salam Al Kassis is amazing and you can get booked super soon! No waitlist and great results. Look at my post for reference! You shouldn‚Äôt have to wait this long and I‚Äôm sorry you have had to.

I understand! PI is great if you change your mind. He does great work and depth won‚Äôt be an issue! Also the Cowper‚Äôs gland is preserved so it‚Äôs possible for self lubrication if that‚Äôs a concern!

Might even fall under an illegal firing law on the employer&#39;s side which is also some pretty large potential damages. My previous statement was meaning suing the surgeon though.

Ask if you have a case for lost wages against the surgeon due to all the last minute cancellations. I believe the cause of action is called &#34;Promissory Estoppel&#34;.

I&#39;m not a lawyer, I just watch one on YouTube. (A real one not Legal Eagle)

It seems to be UAB more than Dr. Selph himself, and that might make the battle more uphill (but the potential payouts bigger?)

Possibly, though don&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s just actual damages and court costs (filing and lawyer fees) that you can actually get there. Most I would hope for there is actual with interest plus court costs myself. I&#39;d still want to push it all the way without allowing for a lower settlement though, if only to make a point.

So how does this help you reach your goal of getting surgery anytime soon? Litigation will take two years. What happened to:

You&#39;re shooting yourself in the foot.

My legal efforts are, at this time, entirely focused on my former employer, and I have merely entertained discussions of expanding it to more than that in this thread.

Travelers definitely committed wrongful termination:

He&#39;s also complete garbage at both life and his job. I recommend Rekieta Law instead.
