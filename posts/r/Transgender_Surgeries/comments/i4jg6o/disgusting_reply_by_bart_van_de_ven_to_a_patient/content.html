There is no reason to shave that far.

<a href="https://www.earthslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mental-foramen.jpg">Here is an image indicating where the mental foramen exists on the mandible.</a>
There is no reason he should have shaved that high up.

This doctor&#39;s reply is monstrous.

Ohhhhh yikes. Yeah, if that were unintentionally exposed I’d expect your jaw to snap itself at some point. This is nicely conclusive. I hate how they act like because they’re the professional they can spew some bullshit explanation and desperate people who don’t have many options or don’t look into it much themselves will believe them.

The mental nerve canal runs about 3mm below the foramen so actually if you shave directly up to it you&#39;re guaranteed to sever the nerve. At two years it&#39;s not growing back.

There is so many creepy doctors that do malpractice to trans patient we should start a whole page to save other trans people, sometimes I get a super wave of dysphoria and saving up money I almost rushed into it  a few times In honestly scared. even the hospital I go to recommends local doctors that work with them that have cases or malpractice! Mine you this is one or the few hospitals that offer assistance to trans patients in my area

We should have a
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/ffs/europe#wiki_bart_van_de_ven">wiki</a>
or something so that people could look up doctors, but I fear lots of people wouldn’t find it.

She has multiple lawsuits against her for malpractice. I’ve seen pictures of her SRS work and it looks like a child was given the knife. Most girls who see her are unable to get good results even with revisions. She also gave someone a cheek augmentation and the filler went behind her eye socket.

Not to mention there are reports of substandard follow up care.  I saw someone name her “the Butcher of Ardmore” and from the results I’ve seen it’s apt.

And his response was for her to quit violin? I’m quite nervous about overly aggressive FFS and healing, but this level of callous is hard to read.

Hey guys, just saw this, I am the patient who wrote the review.
</p>
<p>
I really am quite happy with my visual results from surgery.
</p>
<p>
However as you can read in my review I was offered a free correction surgery by him in case the damage is permanent when I visited 6 months post op. To see him answer to my review like that now feels a bit like a punch in my face. My opinion of him dropped tremendously after I saw that comment from him...
</p>
<p>
And I will surely not go back.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Just suck it up and give me 5 stars already&#34;
</p>
<p>
What great advice.

Thank you! I do not agree what he said is right. I felt for you and also his explanation sounded like he knew where the nerves are but why he cut so high and near the nerve knowing that is absurd. It sounded as if he was taking a risk with your health to achieve a certain result in exchange for your nerve damage.

I have no idea what made him think that his response is just and fair. Anyone with a brain can tell he is laughing at the patient&#39;s face who is suffering the consequences of his mistakes. Unbelievable. I think the fact that he has botched and killed many and get away with it made him think he is untouchable. Yet some still go to him and defend him in our community which feeds his ego and insanity.

Killed about three I heard. One Canadian, one German and one from the middle east I heard. He nearly killed Diana Goetsch and put her in a coma and I think although, not confirmed Kellie Maloney. Plus the botched cases and complications he has. There is one Polish girl Karolina Palka who almost lost her teeth and she ended up with swollen lymph node and saggy chin after. Another one on FFS Facebook group sounds like she has problems with her gums and teeth after surgery with him because he peeled off the gums around her teeth to access the chin instead of making an incision below the gumline.

I have no idea how he&#39;s still operating as a surgeon after that track record? I thought that something like that and you&#39;d lose your license... Yep too many horror stories from there to consider it.

I think unless the victims all come forward and complain to the medical board then they cannot do anything. Most transpeople won&#39;t come forward or even try to sue and if they do it is hard if they&#39;re a foreign national. Even if he gets sued the court cannot take his license. Best move is for transwomen to warn each other of him and advice against him. He has his fans too who will fight for him aggressively as if he was a saint.

I am on the mailing list for 2Pass and get the occasional patient testimony from people. Some do have good results, but others look fake, and the fact there are even serious health risks posed from using him should be more widely known!

Yes he does have some LUCKY patients who did not get botched. But the number of his horror stories are far more than what you would consider an isolated case if that makes sense. Also, they do like to do aggressive marketing by posting fake reviews and testimonials and doing double standard blogs like how to avoid choosing the wrong surgeon but angles it to a point that it favours him like for example, having loads of before and after on his website and Youtube videos. These are all his marketing tricks.

It&#39;s actually really hard to remove a bad doc. When I was a nurse, I got on with a doc in a one doc shop, who was new to the area. It was a nightmare. I lasted six months and turned states evidence against him for various really fucked up things.
</p>
<p>
It took a rape case, a fraud case, and a cross boarder theft for them to remove his privileges in my state. He just moved to a different one and started again.

Hi Folks,
</p>
<p>
I’m Diana Goetsch, the person who wound up in a coma for eight days after being operated on by van de Ven on February 11, 2016. You can read a factual account of my ordeal, with photos, in the Facebook FFS group. That ordeal includes this surgeon’s numerous aesthetic mistakes, nerve damage, damage to my sinus cavity, and attempts to financially bully and manipulate me. To call this a botched surgery would be an understatement, and I&#39;m lucky to have escaped with my life. (I also reported the coma experience, though not the medical specifics—many of which I had yet to realize—in
<em>
The American Scholar
</em>
:
<a href="https://theamericanscholar.org/coma/#.XzYs7SnN7yE" rel="nofollow">https://theamericanscholar.org/coma/#.XzYs7SnN7yE</a>
</p>
<p>
What I’d like to say here is that tone and words matter. The way a surgeon characterizes his work, and characterizes you as a patient, after a botched or sub-standard procedure, can bully, gaslight, and further traumatize. (I too have “5 star” nerve damage.)
</p>
<p>
Van de Ven actually tried to blame me for the coma, claiming I had an “unknown blood disorder” that caused my neck to swell with blood, and not his incision. This was later proven false (and laughed at) by hematologists in the U.S. Van de Ven also wanted credit for “saving my life,” he who continued operating for hours (instead of saving my life) after observing my neck swelling with blood.
</p>
<p>
Also, let’s beware of “flying monkeys”—the surrogates that surgeons send out to swarm and attack any patient who dares to report a negative experience. When a trans woman posts photos, and gives a factual account of her experience with a surgeon—positive or negative—she is informing and protecting our community, and we owe her a debt of gratitude. Flying monkeys who attack, criticize, or mitigate the experiences of trans women are traitors to our community.
</p>
<p>
Hear me: There is never a reason to attack or criticize a report of a medical experience, positive or negative. No surgeon’s livelihood is more important than our LIVES.
</p>

Shit reply but nerve damage is a risk of ffs, even if it&#39;s not aggressive.  Seriously people, it&#39;s major fucking surgery and you might be just unlucky.
</p>
<p>
That said, idk why anyone still considers him.  Don&#39;t see a surgeon who books two a day, and who decides whether to do type 3 or not when you&#39;re under.

It&#39;s because some people only see his marketing and work on influencers and youtubers. Reddit, facebook groups and realself are not used or frequented by everyone. And posts like mine or others&#39; get losr or drowned.

The surgeon’s overall rating is 3 star. That’s definitely not a surgeon I’d trust. I want 4 star minimum and good reasoning for why any dropped stars are in error or down to things that don’t matter to me so much (like bedside manner).

Because he got the most recent ones deleted on Realself. He had loads more that were new and he went down to 3 star but I guess he asked realself to take them down by paying.

Yes it is a shit response like the nerve damage is a joke or something. I wonder how he would feel if it was him or someone he cares about receiving this response.

Most of the stuff posted on here is from the same person. This seems to be from her new account because people got pissed off at her posting about him constantly. Facial Team are very good I&#39;m sure but at literally twice the price they are out of reach of a great many people.

Yeah the price is quite a bit different, I could probably get everything I need at Bart for 15k or less but I&#39;m worried I can&#39;t at FT.  Ive been saving for a house for a few years before figuring out I was intersex/trans so I do have some saved but still not enough

I haven&#39;t heard anyone get quoted less than in the region of 30k from FT. I&#39;d have liked to shop around but for me it was got to 2pass or not get it done. I&#39;m 3 weeks out of surgery and whilst I think there are some issues I&#39;m generally happy with the results.

For what it is worth I think that Dutch to English yields a particularly brash and unemotional translation that can give the wrong impression to native English speakers. Spending time in Holland and Flemish Belgium can be a bit confusing switching between Dutch and English and developing their speaking habits.

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the matter here. Telling a patient who has complications from his poor work that &#34;you can easily solve the problem by not resting on your jaw with your hand&#34; is a jerky advice. We&#39;re not lost in translation here or some foreign humour. He is clearly being a jerk and cared more about the 5 stars. It&#39;s like telling you to stop choking when you&#39;re. It&#39;s obvious how this man sees his patients. Just bags of money and samples for experiments.

I will stand by my belief as someone that spent plenty of time in Holland with Dutch speakers. The very matter of fact statement is extremely common and not an intentionally offensive statement.
</p>
<p>
If people want to attack his work, whatever (although many of the merical comments here are just made up opinions of laymen) I do think Americans that travel abroad for surgery need to understand there are cultural and linguistic differences that we do not always understand. Flemmish people are aloof and very cool and collected. If the lack of empathy and customer focus common in America is unsettling then I would not go abroad for surgery.

Thank you. I believe the danger here is some people avoid to see what is obvious. You can present them witg facts but they spin it to suit themselves. I guess they just don&#39;t want to admit they have been taken for a fool by this clown. Any surgeon can act all nice and sweet before surgery but it is after and when issues arise where you can see their true colour like the above example.

Sure you&#39;re allowed to believe that and you can have surgery with anyone including him. Warnings about him and any other surgeons are for people to either listen to, contemplate or ignore. But for most of us we rather not make an excuse for his own apathetic and callous behavior. It&#39;s obvious for us maybe not for you but that&#39;s fine.

I just think you should focus on the actual issue and not your percieved tone of his.
</p>
<p>
I chose my surgeon based off their deets and work, the fact he was nice and his staff gave me Voss water and pampered me was just extra.

The actual issue is clear. I think that advice is best given to yourself. And we all have seen his work. You&#39;re sold by the water he gave you? Wow okay. So you&#39;re having surgery with him no wonder you defend him. But again if you refuse to open your eyes that&#39;s your choice not us just don&#39;t complain later we did not warn you.

I had my FFS years ago with a different surgeon and I never said I was going to him.
</p>
<p>
This is pointless though, it seems just being outraged was the point here and not his actual work.

What do you mean not his actual work? The response is to his patient whom he performed surgery on whom is also offended by his response. If I was your surgeon and I tell you  or your love one who I performed somekind of leg surgery on and you complain you cannot walk and I tell you don&#39;t walk then. Would you say oh no that&#39;s only her humour?
</p>
<p>
Anyone will be offended especially you. The point of  this post is to show what Bart is really like. This is important and helpful especially when the trans community are often taken advantaged of by creepy surgeons. The worst FFS offender to date is him. Sorry but you&#39;ve lost this one whatever your agenda is. The whole Flemish humour and lost in translation comment is also such a lame excuse.

Trans surgeons face a very thin line of approval. Many in the general public dislike what they do and if they are not perfect, which no surgeon is, the trans community will villify them.
</p>
<p>
Bart has preformed hundreds of surgeries and done great work on most of them. He offers a much more affordable rate than many other well known surgeons (Probably costs 1/4 of what I paid). Saying he is &#34;the worst FFS offender to date&#34; is rather ridiculous. If people want to judge his work and make an informed decision that is obviously valid. Getting offended and vilifying someone because you don&#39;t like the way they talk is a joke.
</p>
<p>
This is pointless now. Write a review about the guy if he pissed you off, people will still go to him and he will still do largely good work.

I&#39;m sorry but people who hate FFS and GRS surgeons are bigots who hate the LGBT. They do not hate the surgeons for being surgeon but rather the people they choose to treat.
</p>
<p>
At the same time because most transwomen are denied access to healthcare such as surgery some surgeons who are mediocre enter the transgender surgery scene to take advantage of us. In comparison to other FFS surgeons&#39; safety, consistency happy patients, complication rate, ethics, aesthetics, professionalism, training and quification and results, Bart is one of the low. He has more deaths, botched cases, complications, lawsuits and poor reputation overall. You seem to look at him in a very narrow view like his results as you mentioned which is also nothing that any US or EU surgeon can&#39;t achieve.
</p>
<p>
Also none of us like the way he talked to a patient as displayed by the evidence. What is there to like in his comment? I don&#39;t even find it funny. You don&#39;t see the point because you&#39;re missing the point. He is not even your surgeon or would be surgeon so I don&#39;t see why you refuse to acknowledge his blatantly obvious  rotten real self. And yes people will still go to him both the innocent and people like you who refuse to see what is obvious. I feel more concerned for the innocent ones misled by his marketing and exploited fans.

Not surprised. My FFS surgeon explained that one of  the main purposes of the CT scans was to map out  where nerve in the jaw is to avoid damaging it.

No he never asks for ct scan for the jaw and or chin only an X ray. He doesn&#39;t like CT scans as he said on Facebook and even if he asked you it&#39;s very likely only for show or if you insisted. I doubt he will even look at it. Good luck with your surgery though YIKES!

Nope. Again this may just be for your case cause you need an implant. But for other procedures like the above he does not ask for a scan. No need to be rude to me as I have not been rude to you. Again, good luck on your surgery. I have no intention to change your mind or influence you. It&#39;s your face. The botched reviews of his work are out there often missed by Germans but good luck. And this subreddit is for both good and bad. The above shows his callousness and if you want a surgeon like that to cut you open good luck.

I never said there are no happy patients by Bart. Ofcourse there are. However, it is also true that he has botched and even killed people that is more than just an isolated case. I have not seen as much botched work, coma or deaths as his from other FFS surgeons. Like I said if you are confident in his skills and trust him you can have surgery with him.
</p>
<p>
And not just because he had some good results means it can be used to justify his disastrous botched jobs and rotten attitude.
