It cost me $6k. The holes you see won’t always be holes. They will heal, but the scarring will look like white dots. Hair will not grow back from where they extracted the hair, but that’s ok because the hair I have will cover the scar making them basically invisible.

Hair still grows back near the holes so they blend in. I’ve had 2 FUE hair transplants, after a few months you can’t really tell anymore. Only person that might notice anything is whoever cuts your hair. I’d recommend letting them know you had a transplant so they can cut the hair in a  way to blend it better.

It doesn’t hurt at all during the procedure because they numb you up very well. After it was all done the pain was very minimal.

Thanks for sharing!!  Questions!  So, basically you&#39;ll have that &#34;band&#34; of no hair in the middle of your scalp?  (I assume it&#39;ll cover up just fine...)  Curious why they couldn&#39;t just start with the hair at the base of the neck...?  How long did the process take?  What&#39;s the expected healing time?

The strongest hair is from the section they took from. Hairs at the base of the scalp are finer. The process took about 7-8 hours. The healing time is a bit of a long winded answer. For now, I have to wait about 7 days and then I need to wash the implanted area to gently remove the scabs so that transplants can heal well. If you don’t remove the scabs it will essentially suffocate the transplants.

Congatulations on your hair transplant. I was wondering, where did you get it done and was payed out of pocket? No other charges involved?

Does this mean no hair will grow back into that area at all, or are there follicles left in that area that will grow back as it heals?

The holes look larger than they will be once they are healed. The hair follicles won’t grow back where they extracted the hair, no. But for me, that’s ok. The back of our heads generally has a lot of donor hair and the little scars can easily be covered by just growing out one’s hair.

I have a question - sorry I&#39;m late to the party!
</p>
<p>
I had a consult with a Dr that does something like this, and he said they shave the donor spot, then cut the skin out and use that to pull the donors from?  This sounds like to me there will be a totally bald strip eventually - however I recall him saying they pull the cuts together and suture them to prevent that.  I wish I had notes from this consult but I worry now about the bald strip as one of my favorite ways to wear my hair is up in a claw...which would expose the strip.  Is this not the case with what you had done?  Just curious. And thank you for sharing!

Hair grows in the area. They shave a wide area before they start extraction. It just doesn’t grow back in the spots that were actually extracted. It shouldn’t be noticeable once it’s all healed in the other hair in that area grows back.

Most girls I know with it say after a year or so is when you really see the results and the hair comes in coarse but that’s better than nothing I can’t wait to see your results

Actually that procedure is alot better than the one where they directly remove a portion of your scalp tissue and sow the skin back together. That one leaves a very large noticable and sometimes raised scar. This one she had should have like hardly any major scarring.
</p>
<p>
Hope you get the results you are looking for 🥰☺️

That procedure is FUT. i had one done a long time ago. Very painful, but you get more donor hair. I would do FUE if you can, it takes more time and costs more. Go to a good surgeon. Mine was good but not all of them are. My scar is only noticeable when my hair is buzzed with a 4 setting or lower.

Well, it depends on how much hair you need to have transplanted and the texture of your hair. For example, they told me they had an African American woman who originally opted for FUE, but they had to switch to FUT part way through because her hair was too curly for the robot to effectively grab her follicles.

Yes, the reason they do that is because they have to look at each individual hair follicle and see if it will survive being transplanted. If it won’t then they just toss it out because there’s no point in implanting it. I had this procedure done with a terrible clinic in the past and they used grafts that weren’t viable which led to poor results. I’m confident it will work this time.
