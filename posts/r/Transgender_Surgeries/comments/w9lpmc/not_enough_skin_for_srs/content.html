As a result of hrt, my penis had shrinked. Could this have an effect on my future operation? May I have too little material for srs surgery? Or so, what can I do?  Did someone in a similar situation decided to undergo penile inversion surgery?

if you are doing penile inversion method, it can affect depth. But many surgeons supplement penile canal tissue with scrotal graft tissue (sometimes peritoneal tissue too) anyway - it can be quite possible for them to make it work, and really depends on the surgeon and their technique. You’d have to ask at the consultation. There are other surgical methods though - colon &amp; peritoneal pull-through both use different tissue for the canal and that avoids this entirely.
</p>
<p>
Lack of tissue can also affect aesthetic outcomes depending on what the surgeon uses to construct the vulva. again, this varies a lot. There is no straight answer here - you’ll need to research surgeons and ask questions at your consultation(s).

My future surgeon ( I&#39;am from Poland, we don&#39;t have any other choice) perform only penile inversion and sigmoid colon methods. I know that sigmoid colon carries a lot od risk, so I&#39;d rather avoid that.

Do you have money to have surgery elsewhere?

I can hardly afford surgery in Poland, so foreign surgeons are beyond my reach

It doesn&#39;t really matter, Thailand can&#39;t do magic if she&#39;s exceptionally small down there.

Suporn got good depth with a micropenis, and presumably Bank is the same. And there’s other techniques applicable too.

I can vouch for Dr. Bank in this area. I didn&#39;t necessarily have a micropenis, but I started hormone blockers at 14 and had a small penis and scrotum. Still ended up with around 7.5 inches of depth and well defined labia minora made from penile skin. From what I can tell, my labia minora are on the smaller side for the Suporn clinic, but much more present than almost any other surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I assume if I was fine, most people transitioning as adults have almost nothing to worry about, seeing as for me it was a combination of atrophy, years of tucking, and never growing in the first place.

How lovely that you can transition at 14! Really so happy for you :)!

Understandable! Yeah, youll need to ask your surgeon. Often times, like I said, penile inversion also uses graft tissue at the end of the canal to supplement penile tissue and this can reduce the depth issue. But it’s possible your surgeon will tell you that your options are either a low-ish depth penile inversion or a deeper sigmoid colon vaginoplasty.

If you value aesthetics over depth, zero depth vaginoplasty is your best option.

I care about having sexual intercourse, so zero depth isn&#39;t for me.
