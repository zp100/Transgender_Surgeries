Holy crap! That&#39;s impressive not just in the result but also the recovery time. Presumably you can have sex now with it? Or does Chettawut&#39;s method require you to wait longer?

Chettawut requires you to wait 3 months, so technically I guess I can have sex. I haven‚Äôt yet though, I can still feel a little bit of granulation in the opening so I‚Äôve been waiting till that‚Äôs gone to try penetrative sex.

I‚Äôm really happy with everything, recovery has been pretty easy since I have a wonderful support network and Chet‚Äôs nurses in Thailand were amazing. I haven‚Äôt really had any issues with dilating either. Though I do have some granulation that is causing me to delay trying sex which is a bit frustrating.
</p>
<p>
Also I gotta say, your result is amazing! I might be a little jealous of your labia minora.

I found the nurses to be very helpful too, albeit a little brisk at times. Did you get a chance to meet Mrs. Chettawut? I enjoyed her the most, especially being able to discuss our shared love of Marks and Spencer&#39;s- she&#39;d visited it once in the UK.
</p>
<p>
Have you had any treatment for the granulation?
</p>
<p>
What depth did you get?
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much for your kind remarks, I am certainly very happy. Though the results that Chettawut is producing seem to be getting consistently better, I do feel like I lucked out in some regards.

I‚Äôm not sure if I met Mrs Chettawut, does she do the hotel visits? One of the two nurses who visited me was super sweet, would always chat with me, and gave me a hug before I left. Dr chettawut was also super sweet and gave me a hug before surgery and before I left.
</p>
<p>
I haven‚Äôt had any treatment for granulation, the clinic told me to let it be the last time I contacted them, I‚Äôll probably reach out again though since it‚Äôs been about a month.
</p>
<p>
I got about 7 of depth which I‚Äôm super happy with, especially since I had what Chet called ‚Äúa very short and small penis‚Äù and was also circumcised. All things considered my result is a lot better than I was expecting.

Yes, she does. She certainly did when I was there, anyway. Where were you staying? I was at the Princess.
</p>
<p>
I would keep an eye on it, especially if it is located near the entrance to the vagina canal.
</p>
<p>
In depths of depth that is very impressive, irrespective of your circumstances. I managed to get 6&#34;, which I was also very happy with given that I&#39;d been on GnRa analogues during puberty and so didn&#39;t have too much donor material. 7 &#34; is very impressive. What is your dilation routine like?

I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs the really sweet nurse then. I stayed at their newest hotel, the Novotel, it was kinda meh, but cheaper than the princess for connecting rooms.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs right inside the entrance, but it‚Äôs been steadily shrinking and there‚Äôs just a tiny bit left now.
</p>
<p>
I just dropped down to twice a day for a little over an hour a couple weeks ago so I could go back to work. It definitely made dilation a little more uncomfortable at first , but I‚Äôve been able to maintain depth easily. What did you end up doing for a dilation schedule?
</p>
<p>
The Thai surgeons really seem to be able to get impressive amounts of depth for people with very little donor material. I‚Äôve also heard that being tall helps as there is more space inside of you.

I have some hairs around the opening, as far as I can tell they are only on the little bit of perineum skin that gets pulled in. Hair is expected there unless you have hair removal done before. Chet says you can have hair removal done 6 months post op which is what I‚Äôm planning on doing.

Those are some damn impressive results. You must be really happy with the appearance.
</p>
<p>
Do you mind if I ask, I&#39;ve been planning to get SRS in a year or so, considering Dr Chet. It says on his site that, like Dr Supporn, he personally removes hair roots in skin tissue used for the vaginal lining. Did you get any electrolysis on the area prior to this, as a sort of precautionary measure?

Hola, tengo un par de preguntas: ¬øc√≥mo fue tu recuperaci√≥n hasta ahora? ¬øQu√© te hizo elegir al Dr. Chettawut sobre otros cirujanos? ¬øRecomiendas al Dr. Chettawut? ¬øY c√≥mo mantienes tus resultados en t√©rminos de cosm√©tica, sensibilidad y profundidad? ¬øC√≥mo fue la estancia en Tailandia? ¬øC√≥mo fue el cuidado posterior del Dr. Chettawut? ¬øHas probado los dilatadores del alma? Y si los usaste, ¬øhay alguna ventaja? Y por cierto muchas felicitaciones por la cirug√≠a.
