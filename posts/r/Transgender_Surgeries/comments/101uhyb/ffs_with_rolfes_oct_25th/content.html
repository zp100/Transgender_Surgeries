I had FFS on Oct 25th with Dr. Rolfes and am overjoyed with the results. BCBS of Colorado covered everything but my out of pocket max. Sorry my before photos have terrible lighting they were taken the night before surgery in our Airbnb.
</p>
<p>
Operations I had: type 3 forehead reconstruction with hairline advance, eyebrow lift, rhinoplasty/septoplasty, sliding genioplasty with jaw contouring, submental liposuction, fat transfer to lips and cheeks, and a tracheal shave. My trachea was pretty prominent so I didn&#39;t expect miracles, but I think it looks pretty good. Surgery lasted 8 hours with two hours in the recovery room and then I was sent home for the night.
</p>
<p>
During the pre op appointment I showed Dr Rolfes results and changes from prior patients that have posted on this sub and we discussed my goals and what I wanted/expected out of each surgery.
</p>
<p>
My post surgery recovery wasn&#39;t too bad after I got past the first 36ish hours. I was really nauseated from the anesthesia and the blood/drainage in my stomach from the rhinoplasty. I didn&#39;t sleep much and threw up a few times during the night the first of which was just a bunch of blood. Which thankfully I had mentally prepared for and pretty much knew was coming.
</p>
<p>
During my checkup the next day the bandages came off and the jaw bra got put on. I fed myself Soylent and drank water with a syringe for the first few days until I could handle drinking regularly and chewing slightly more substantial foods. Recovery was just a bunch of sitting around and cleaning wounds carefully until we went back home about 10 days later.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not going to post any post surgery recovery photos they make me pretty uncomfortable. The after photos are around 7 weeks post. So some residual swelling is left I&#39;ll probably update when I hit 3 months with new photos.

What a great result! It’s very dramatic and easily one of the best results I’ve seen from him, and yet you still look very natural and not too “done.” This definitely proves he is capable of more aggressive changes however. I’m very happy for you.

Hey thanks! Yes I was pretty adamant about him being aggressive where he could while still keeping harmony between my features. I had a great experience with him and his office. Really good care and very kind staff.

I had done virtual FFS before my consultation so I had a good idea of the changes I wanted. If you don&#39;t have that I would look for patients of his with similar features as yours prior to surgery. I think it helps him understand your goals and expectations. You&#39;re in good hands he&#39;s a very competent and compassionate person. Really easy to talk to.

I have a virtual consult with him in February. Is that what you are referring to or is there something else?
</p>
<p>
Everything else sounds great!

Virtual FFS is a service that&#39;s run by a trans woman Alexandra Hammer in the UK. She works with facial team pretty frequently. Her website
<a href="http://www.virtualffs.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.virtualffs.co.uk/</a>
has quite a lot of information regarding FFS and the services she offers.

I have BCBS of Colorado through Walmart, how did you go about getting it covered? I&#39;m not too experienced with the ins/outs of navigating insurance.

I got letters from my psych and hrt prescriber. After that just went through the consultation process Dr. Rolfes team submitted for approval with insurance. You can always call and ask your insurance if facial surgery is covered. Even if it&#39;s not outright stated in your policy it may still cover it because mine did. BCBS is a huge company though so insurance through employers varies widely.

Looks amazing girl! I&#39;m in Colorado and starting to research insurance for next year, how was the process for scheduling out of state and getting it covered with BCBS?

Not bad! I had letters from my psych and hrt provider ready to go at my consultation. Rolfes team submitted everything to my insurance and about 2 months later got news that it would be covered. I have an Anthem BCBS PPO plan through my employer.
