I am now 2 months post-op vaginoplasty with Dr. B√©langer at GRS Montreal. My healing has continued to be good and I have not had any major complications. I recently went for a post op check up at my doctor and the only issue found was some more hypergranulation that needed to be treated with silver nitrate. My scars are healing well, they are getting flatter and less prominent. I apply a brush-on silicon liquid to my scars once or twice a day to help them heal better. I have been slowly been regaining sensation in my labia and can now orgasm from indirect clitoral stimulation. Rubbing against a pillow for a long enough time is enough to get me to orgasm. My depth has now been constant for a while and I can take all 5 dots of the orange dilator inside me. I estimate I have around 6 inches of depth. I am now able to ride a bike as long as I don&#39;t lean too far forward and am not on bumpy terrain (It&#39;s ouch if I am). I am overall very happy with my results. AMA

Wow that looks great! She‚Äôs my choice too for next year when I can apply for funding. I prefer her results to Brassard but that‚Äôs just from the few photos I‚Äôve seen. How long did you wait to get it, basically what was the wait list time roughly?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for sharing!
</p>
<p>
Edit: adding: did you do any hair removal down there beforehand? I hear they do a good job at follicle scraping and if I don‚Äôt need to go through the extra agony I will skip that step.

It took around 8 months from sending my funding authorization letter from my province to my surgery date. I would think the wait list would be shorter now that COVID isn&#39;t as much of a problem. I did not do any hair removal beforehand and so far have not found any hair in my vagina. This could change as hair can take awhile to grow back so I don&#39;t know for sure yet if I have any hair growing there (Hopefully not).

That is perfect, under a year from finishing HrT is doable with my impatient self üòú
</p>
<p>
Hopefully the wait list will shrink on the next ten months then. In Ontario and I heard they are decent speed at approval times too.

My labia minora can be seen the spread eagle photo, they are small but are there (The picture doesn&#39;t show them very well). My clit is well hooded (which is good since I&#39;m so sensitive) and isn&#39;t easy to see unless you spread the labia minora. It&#39;s hard for me to get a good picture of it since my camera is not great at close up shots.

Sensation in my clit is great, I think it&#39;s actually more sensitive than I was pre-op.

When I&#39;m in the right mood it takes only about 20 minutes. Reaching orgasm has has as much psychological factors as it does physical factors for me. Maybe it&#39;s the same for you?

It was free (Only had to pay for transportation to and from Montreal) for me since my province&#39;s health insurance includes coverage for vaginoplasty. I have heard it costs around $30,000 CAD if you are paying out of pocket.

Hey! Mine was 1 day after you with brassard, our results are very similar üòä i havent reach orgasm tho, my clit is still not very sensible, im jalous lol. Also, how does your labia minora feels when your touch it? Does the skin feels hard? On my left side its more red and stiff then the right which i feel is anormal?

Glad to hear your results are similar!
</p>
<p>
I got lucky with my sensation of my clit, for some people it can take a while for sensation to come back to their clit. I&#39;m sure it will come back for you as you heal more.
</p>
<p>
The skin on my labia minora does not feel hard but it is still quite red which I have been told by my doctor is quite normal and should turn more pink as I heal more. Having more stiff and red tissue on one side sounds normal to me as healing isn&#39;t always even in how it happens, your right side is probably healing faster than your left side. You should consult your doctor to make sure it is normal since I&#39;m not a medical professional.

I just put the pillow between my legs and rub my vulva against it. I wear a pair of underwear while doing it since I&#39;m so sensitive and it probably also helps keeps thing from getting too irritated since I haven&#39;t had any issue with irritation yet.

I was allowed to take a shower about 5 days after surgery (The first shower after surgery was so nice). I was able to drive two weeks after surgery.
