I hope your recovery goes well! I know how lonely it can feel without anybody there. My partner drove 5 hours to visit because I was having a stressful time recovering in the hospital.

I watched your video and I&#39;ll add it to the wiki.
</p>
<p>
For the painkillers hospitals have access to a range of drugs and you should be able to ask them to keep trying to find something that works. You might have more problems once you get out as there&#39;s not nearly as much range, but hopefully the pain is less by then.
</p>
<p>
Regarding your diet, did you tell them your needs? A hospital should be able to provide appropriate food.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a discord for Suporn patients. You&#39;re eligible to join, if you can find someone to invite you.

Hi, thanks, problems is that language barrier is always strands in the way. I informed Suporn clinic in advance about my condition and that I need special diet, but looks like they haven&#39;t informed local staff about that. And communicating with staff directly is crazy hard, because they have a1 English at best.  Same goes for painkillers, but I can speak about that with doctors once a day and they have decent level of English but it seems to be a significant lag in communication between doctors and nurses.
