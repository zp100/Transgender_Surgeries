Having surgery with keojampa has been total nightmare it has been so difficult to fix this mess from my forehead, chin to my jaw to my sagging skin to having to find another surgeon to fix this mess and going to Dr. Jumaily when no one knew who the heck he was and asking him to try fix i(I appreciate all his help)
</p>
<p>
This whole surgical journey on my face has been a energy draining nightmare. I have spent over 100K cash and it has been just fixing things and I look horrible and its not even over
</p>
<p>
The absolute worst though was posting on here and being talked down to over and over. An absolutely humiliating depressing sad experience being treated like trash by so many who in the most part had no idea how to fix my chin but it &#34;looked good&#34; or telling me my ugly visible trach shave that he did not hide &#34;looked good&#34; but on his other patients he hides them.
</p>
<p>
Absolutely unforgivable how so many of you treat people who post something went wrong just to protect your fav surgeon.

I saw your post, but at least for me, it flies to look bad at all, just the Chin was a little off,
</p>
<p>
But when that surgery was done, how much time did it pass to take the picture, cause I know inflammation may take way too long for some people, were you sure the inflammation was gone?
</p>
<p>
What procedures did you get done aside from the chin and tracheal shave? If you did more were you happy with them?
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m doing theses question cause Iâ€™m not native English speaker, and Iâ€™m am having a hard time understanding the post, greetings!
