Hey everyone
</p>
<p>
Further to my previous posts about sharp pain when dilating, I went back to my surgeon who asked my GP to prescribe Instillagel (lubricated gel containing Lidocaine for vaginal/anal/urethra use). I have been given 10 x 11ml tubes with syringes to squirt it straight up there.
</p>
<p>
I was looking forward to trying this but I&#39;m very concerned this product isn&#39;t suitable for me.
</p>
<p>
My number one concern is that the instructions say
<strong>
DO NOT
</strong>
using on broken/damaged/bleeding skin areas, lest Lidocaine is absorbed in toxic volumes and can cause fits and other nasty issues. I&#39;m on day 14 so I&#39;m no longer bleeding regularly but I still bleed a little after dilation and naturally assume I have damaged tissue in there. This prescription was done entirely by correspondence, I haven&#39;t been inspected by GP or surgeon.
</p>
<p>
From Googling other people talk about it causing a burning pain, numbing so much you injure yourself by over-dilating and lidocaine even delaying healing. All bad stuff.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t been given any instructions really. the GP doesn&#39;t know and I can&#39;t keep crying to the surgeon (who isn&#39;t local!) by email.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Can anyone give advice if they have used or been recommended to use similar pain relief?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have to taken my own healthcare into my hands at this point. Is it just me that thinks this is a bad idea despite it being medically recommended?
</p>
<p>
If I do use I&#39;m thinking of diluting or using alongside existing lube?
</p>
<p>
(Just a bit more context, I&#39;m otherwise healing very well. Some minor wound dehesion but I would say better than average. It&#39;s just this nasty pain which builds up during dilation which is a big problem.)

Lidocaine interferes healing, but not dilating causes problems too. I think there’s some thing in the wiki on it.

My daughter used lidocaine with her lube for the first two months 4x a day and had no problem. She needed it and it helped!

And you’ve had GCS I’m assuming? Lidocaine retricts blood vessels. Meaning loss of blood flow. Meaning tissue necrosis. Check your facts.
</p>
<p>
Lidocaine should only be used sparingly, in the most worst case scenario. Attend Pelvic Floor Rehab. This is everything.
