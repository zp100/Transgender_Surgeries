Hello, I am a trans woman on HRT who has been interested in getting an orchiectomy for a while. I have done research on the process and I have greatly felt like i want this. I am tired of dealing with so many hormone medications and worrying about my body reverting to itâ€™s old masculine form. But I still have many questions, mainly about sex. I use my penis for sex and Im just wondering how it would change sexually

I haven&#39;t had any surgeries other than a vasectomy. However, I have read from other people that the biggest concern for sex would be the ability to maintain an erection. Some people have the same erectile function post orchiectomy and others need to use viagra to be able to stay erect long enough to have intercourse. So worst case scenario you would need to have viagra around and plan accordingly. But best case scenario your sexual function could be even better- some people say that sex was better after getting rid of their balls.

I&#39;ve desired orchiectomy for a few years now and have been willing to put up with the minimal side effects of not having testicles any more, the total absence of testosterone makes it all worthwhile to me IMHO.

Everyone is different. One thing I can say getting an orchi has done for me is take the stress off my mind of reverting , sex... I need to mentally be into it to engage tbh. My drive isnâ€™t as much as it used to be but thatâ€™s fine with me.

Have you started HRT? That&#39;s a prerequisite and it&#39;ll give you an indication of what to expect. My orchi itself really didn&#39;t change anything, but HRT knocked my libido and erections down to basically nothing. ED meds help some folks.
