<p>
Day 0
</p>
<p>
I was in the hospital 30 minutes prior to the timing when i should have been there and 45 minutes later i was in my room already.
</p>
<p>
16:xx should have been the time where I get ready for surgery
</p>
<p>
16:12 and I was in the wake up room to get ready and around 16:35 I got the monitors on and the cannula in my arm
</p>
<p>
Then a little bit of waiting again and then I got the breathing mask and the first pain medications
</p>
<p>
I should tell them when I get dizzy from this one and yeah, I didn‚Äôt üòÖ so then I directly got the sleeping medication and then breathing in 2 times and then I was gone
</p>
<p>
Round about 19:00 and I was in the wake up room again and really dizzy.
</p>
<p>
Round about half an hour later apparently they called the station so I can get back into my room and I was able to drink a little bit and got some water ice cream against my throat pain. Shortly after that I got a stingy pain and got some Ibuprofen IV against it
</p>
<p>
20:00 and they called the station again cause I was still in the wake up room. Turns out they forgot to notify the ppl that transport the beds and that‚Äôs the reason I was still there üòÖ
</p>
<p>
20:50 and I was in my room again and I was allowed to eat and a lot to drink ü•∞
</p>
<p>
A little bit extra for this day (TW cissexism)
</p>
<p>
The nurse in the wake up room controlled what they had done to me when the ppl that brought me back to my room arrived and was astonished when they read ‚Äúchondrolanyngoplasty (tracheal shave)‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt have thought this cause im already looking like a real women
</p>
<p>
Till like 23:00 I was completely pain free, my voice was completely there without any notable problems and then I went to sleep
</p>
<p>
Day 1
</p>
<p>
The night was okish‚Ä¶ from my feeling every hour a nurse came in the control our oxygen levels and my roommate snored loudly :/
</p>
<p>
Now that I am awake I have pain while talking and swallowing (round about a 3-4)
</p>
<p>
The examination looked good and again I got something through my nose until they were able to look at my vocal cords again to see if something bad occurred there. Everything in there and out looked good
</p>
<p>
In the Evening my pain got a little bit worse and I go some pain killers (novalgin) for the night, also my voice got rasher and I had the feeling of a strong cold in my throat. Also don‚Äôt even think about coughing, it hurts
</p>
<p>
Day 2
</p>
<p>
The night was goodish, but still a nurse came every 4 hours to check our oxygen level
</p>
<p>
And typical when I was under the shower the Surgeon came in to check if everything is alright‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
But they told my through the bathroom door I know need to get to this other clinic (like 100-200m away) so they can check again and if everything is alright I can then get released.
</p>
<p>
This time I didn‚Äôt got anything through my nose cause the recordings from day 1 were really good and they just looked from the outside and there was also everything ok.
</p>
<p>
So then I got released and my fianc√© took me back home again (on the train ride I might gushed a little bit too much about to lovely ppl I met in Berlin and therefore my voice got even worse üòÖ)
</p>
<p>
Till now (Day 16) not much happened tbh, I switched the band aid like every 2 days (removing in the morning, getting it back on in the evening) and removed the stripes and the skin glue like 2 days ago (which you can see in the pictures)
</p>
<p>
Voice got better over time and since removing everything its close to 100% back on track (need a little bit to work on my higher pitch again but I haven‚Äôt used that in a few weeks).
</p>
<p>
I still have a numb point between the cut and my chin but according to my GP that‚Äôs totally within range and everything looks fine (visited her today)
</p>
<p>
As everytime, if you have any further questions pls let me know in the comments

I realise this may be a dumb question but a tracheal shave is not the same thing as VFS right? Like the tracheal shave won‚Äôt affect the sound of your voice long-term? If I do medically transition I like the idea of getting rid of the neck bulge but I‚Äôm gonna need my full vocal range for my career, so it‚Äôs important to me that my voice is unaffected.

The voice might get affected
</p>
<p>
According to my surgeon, if it is permanent it is classified as a major complication (that&#39;s still can happen)
</p>
<p>
What most likely will happen that your voice will sound harsher a few weeks, just like when you recover from a stronger cold (what i also noticed)
</p>
<p>
But yeah, it&#39;s not VFS and only aesthetical

Overall stuff about it, but that&#39;s more about VFS, but the same ppl perform tracheal shave
</p>
<p>
You can&#39;t choose your surgeon

Voice was on track in the first month again
</p>
<p>
Idgaf about my voice anymore though it&#39;s hard to actually say but with a little bit of retraining i should also reach the high again
</p>
<p>
In January I&#39;m in Berlin again and can post the results if anything happened, but also then it&#39;s probably that i don&#39;t talk in such a high voice anymore because I&#39;m feeling more comfortable with a slightly lower voice

I haven&#39;t heard of any other satisfying result except from the Charit√© when I was looking, so it was kind of a no trainer for me
</p>
<p>
Oh and also i was ever able to use different voices so this might play a role in how i perceive my voice

Helios Klinikum in Buch, Dr Marc Bloching, has many accolades in plastic surgery and does the tracheal shave with the Wolfort technique, i went there in september and my scar isnt even noticeable, definetly a great place for this surgery in Berlin :)
