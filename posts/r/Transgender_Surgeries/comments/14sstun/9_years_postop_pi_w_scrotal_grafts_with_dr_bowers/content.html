<strong>
Hello all!
</strong>
(Usual warnings about surgery stuff apply, maybe a bit graphic in parts)
</p>
<p>
As I&#39;m approaching the 9 year anniversary of my vaginoplasty from 2014 (at age of 21),  I thought I would share some of my experiences and thoughts this far out, since I don&#39;t really see many people posting after the first 2 years of my surgery.  I was no different, and you can look at my comment history to see myself posting about my post-op journey in the first two years.  I hope my experience will be found useful to someone.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d say once I got past the initial recovery period by 6 months post op, I was fairly satisfied with my results for many years.  I had 6.5 inches of depth at the operation and would probably be considered a success story.  There were some issues, such as pain during dilation/intercourse, reduced sensation causing weaker/more difficult orgasms, excessive erectile tissue causing the opening to become tighter and intercourse more uncomfortable the more aroused I was, and maybe 2 or so hairs that regrew in the neovag.  All those problems aside, I perceived the surgery as a good thing because of reduced genital dysphoria, no worries about tucking, and an acceptable sex life.  Sex was still difficult sometimes, but I could make it work.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, things got worse at around the 5 year mark.  I did not get a &#34;full clearing&#34; of genital electrolysis beforehand, only lasting 3 sessions due to pain and the hope that the scraping during surgery would leave me with a good result.  And I think for awhile it did, but over time I got more hair regrowth, with the biggest jump being a brief period of maybe 4 weeks when I used a topical testosterone gel to help with my very reduced sex drive that was causing problems with my then long-term BF.  Months later, I had noticeably more uncomfortable time with sex and my partner could feel the hairs on the inside when fingering me, and at some point I was able to pull a wad of hair out that had maybe 10+ hairs in it.
</p>
<p>
I was pretty mortified, and got it checked out by a doctor who did mention I had like &#34;around 7&#34; hairs growing inside.  I tried my best to cope with it for the next year or so, plucking the hairs the best to my ability, but by 7 years post-op, I was just kind of sick of the upkeep of cleaning it, dilating, and trying to deal with the hair.  I was going through a rough spot with chronic health conditions, declining mental health, and no partners/sexual desire so I just decided to stop the uncomfortable dilating sessions and deal with the consequences later.
</p>
<p>
It was nice ignoring it for awhile, but by 8 years post-op I was starting to have some pelvic pain near the surgery site even though I wasn&#39;t using the neovag canal anymore. I ended up getting new, smaller dilators to see if that would help the pain, and I found out I have about 3 or so inches left in depth. I thought I could just stop dilating, but it really is a
<strong>
&#34;lifelong&#34; commitment
</strong>
(even if you don&#39;t care about depth loss!).  So now I still have to dilate and clean it out to help reduce the pain and discomfort in the area, even though I don&#39;t really view it as a viable sexual organ anymore (especially the neovag canal).  I&#39;ve tried to explore anal again but even that is less pleasant than I remembered pre-op as I can feel the sex toys pressing against the contracted neovag canal which is uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Where I&#39;m at now:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I know I could benefit to some extent from a revision surgery, but I&#39;m not in a place where I could afford it, nor do I even know if I want it.  I have medical and surgical fatigue at this point.  I also recognize I made some big mistakes, including:
<br>
* Not getting FULL electrolysis to greatly reduce the chance of hair regrowth with the PI w/ scrotal grafts method.
<br>
* Going on the testosterone gel.
<br>
* Stopping dilation for over a year.
<br>
* Rushing into surgery too soon, with too high of expectations
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s hard to admit it, but I do regret the surgery somewhat.  I genuinely felt like I needed the surgery to &#34;be complete&#34; or &#34;fully transition&#34; or to have a comfortable sex life, but those reasonings didn&#39;t really hold up over time.  I underestimated the significance of lifelong dilation. I genuinely did have genital dysphoria, but maybe I should have waited a bit for different methods and to be sure I couldn&#39;t deal with the penis anymore.
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t meant to be a slam against Dr. Bowers specifically, but more of a problem I have noticed with the penile inversion method.  I know quite a few other girls personally who had penile inversions around the time span I did, and many of them have had similar difficulties with dilation and tightness.  It seems like the PPT method is much more well known now, and it sounds like it has less of the problems associated with the PI method.  I&#39;m glad there&#39;s better methods coming out, and hope things will go better for the next generation of MtF&#39;s who feel the need to pursue bottom surgery.  Revisions can be an option for some, but your first surgery is very important so do as much research as possible if you want to go this route.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for reading, this is a very difficult thing for me to talk about but I felt it was important I share my experience. I&#39;m open to answering questions via this thread or DMs.
</p>
<p>
Update Dec 2024: I got a second opinion with another surgeon and ended up doing pelvic physical therapy which has definitely improved my issues with pain. Still an issue sometimes but has improved my quality of life.

You mention chronic health conditions. Just in case its related, but I&#39;m told that internal hair can cause recurring infections and that over time this can cause antibiotic resistance (assuming you use them), which is bad.

Thankfully I don&#39;t need antibiotics for any recurring infections.  It&#39;s a possibility I might need them someday if things were to get worse.

What you said about testosterone was interesting, as a number of  women get increased levels after surgery, and I’ve always wondered if this could cause internal hair problems. You’d not be able to stop this with pre op hair removal.
</p>
<p>
It might be work continuing with anti androgens for a while as standard to prevent this possibility.

Thank you so much for your post! Im hoping you can find peace soon! As someone who is considering PI in Thailand, hair growing inside the neo vagina is very big fear of mine. Of course losing the ability to orgasm is a huge one too. Ahhh I don’t wanna do electrolysis but I think I’m gonna do it

Yeah I would really recommend electrolysis if you&#39;re going to go the PI route. The Thai surgeons have different techniques than western ones, but you don&#39;t really want to gamble with hair regrowth. Best of luck to you and I hope you find peace no matter your decisions.

Thank you so much for sharing your experience. For those of us about to have vaginoplasty, it is important to understand the long term implications of the surgery. I wish you all the best along your journey. Much love to you.

Thank you. &lt;3

There is definitely not enough information on what it&#39;s like to live with vaginoplasty years down the line. It&#39;s not always super easy after the first 1-2 years which is the dominant narrative.

Thank you so much for posting. I&#39;ve been searching for testimonials within your timeframe for my partner who is coming up to the 1 year mark post op. This information is invaluable.

thank you so much for sharing. i’ve been on the fence about PI for a while, as it’s much more accessible and quicker where i live. but your post combined with my lack of donor tissue is really motivating me to wait for a better surgery further down the line. hair regrowth and depth loss are huge concerns for me, and i think you’ve saved me from a lot of pain in the future by being honest about the long term affects

I&#39;m glad it has helped. You only get your primary surgery once, it&#39;s not worth rushing it. Best of luck whatever you choose to do.
