He did an excellent job on your nose and forehead, I have a question: What procedures did you have?

I think the surgery itself for the rhino, forehead and chin was around 14/15k GBP. With the recovery house (3k), flights and a few other things this has probably cost 20k.

I think about 16 nights, with a few nights before surgery. Cost about £2.5k.
</p>
<p>
Am with Innova, they are exceptional, feeling so v well looked after.

I was at Rest and Recover and It Is cheaper (i payed 2k and stayed 20days) and Vicente Is very kind and i eated well and had many many fresh fruit shakes. Innova i&#39;ve never been there but i understand it&#39;s more on the luxury side.

It has been extremely luxurious and the care has been absolutely fantastic. I&#39;m genuinely in awe of how organised, professional and kind they have been here. I&#39;ve felt so incredibly safe and comfortable.

A beautiful result. Congratulations! I’m not familiar with the surgeon. Where is he located? What country or state?  Thank you so much for your post is greatly appreciated.

The surgeon can be found
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/drjesusbaez_rhinoplasty/" rel="nofollow">https://www.instagram.com/drjesusbaez_rhinoplasty/
</a>
</p>
<p>
He operates out of Guadalajara in Mexico, I was initially apprehensive about travelling to Mexico but the care I&#39;ve received has been flawless.

Your nose and forehead look amazing! I have FFS scheduled with him in January and hope I look as good as you. What are your thoughts on Dr. Silva? Do you feel like he listened to what you wanted and did a good job? I&#39;m yet to have a consultation with him and am a bit apprehensive to continue with my sliding genioplasty with him since there&#39;s not much info about him out there

I had a consult with him, and he was lovely in person.
</p>
<p>
He was very clear in the online consult about what he would suggest and explicitly asked me what I wouldn&#39;t want it to look like.
</p>
<p>
I saw a few results which all looked good, but admittedly was a bit of a shot in the dark.  My main comfort in choosing him was that Baez did, and I really trusted Baez. I know Baez had some some chin work in the past, he is quite the perfectionist and I think he knew this guy could do better.

Thanks for answering my questions! Hearing that definitely puts me at ease a little more with him. I saw in another reply you&#39;re staying at Innova, which is where I&#39;m going as well. Do the nurses there speak English? If not, have you had any difficulty with communication?

Hi! I hope you’ve had a wonderful recovery. If you don’t mind me asking, how do you feel about your jaw work so far? I’ve heard very mixed things about Dr. Silva.
