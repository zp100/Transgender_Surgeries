My first time having sex I dilated before and there was no blood afterwards. Today I didn’t dilate before and the was a little bit of blood. Is this normal?

sure. depending on how rough the sex was, how much lube was used, how far post op you are, etc... there is still going to be some bleeding for a while

I’m thinking it can only get better with time and the tissue will eventually stretch or adapt to the size.

I feel the same as you. People who are happy post op rarely post about their experiences.

So I’m…somewhere around 7 months.
</p>
<p>
I was cleared for sex at 8 weeks, and started having sex at 10 weeks.
</p>
<p>
I’ve never bled after sex. At my 3 month checkup (which was really like 5 months) I was told that my canal was totally healed. I asked to see, and was shown by my surgeon. Pretty cool.
</p>
<p>
Right now, my dilation protocols are 2-3 times a week, due to my Wonder Woman healing. I have penetrative sex with my cis female partner - who has this really nice medical grade silicone soft and squishy but firm, penis.
</p>
<p>
The point is - I’ve played with when to dilate before sex. If I dilate, and then like we go out, have dinner, have some drinks, come home and
<em>
then
</em>
have sex - it can be a little tighter at first - but we love foreplay so if she fingers me first it usually really helps.
</p>
<p>
Other times, I’ll dilate, and we will jump in the shower together and then go for a romp. Those times are usually easier.
</p>
<p>
successful post op sex in the first year is really about pace, time, and finding how it best “works” while you’re technically still healing.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think you ripped anything in your canal, but you could have some sore spots either at the entrance to your canal - or if you’ve been treated with silver nitrate anytime in the last month or so - you could have just rubbed off a scabby clot in your canal during sex
