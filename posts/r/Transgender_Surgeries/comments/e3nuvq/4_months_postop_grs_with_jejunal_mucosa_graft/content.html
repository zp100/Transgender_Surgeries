Hi community! Today I&#39;m completing 4 months of GRS (MtF). I&#39;m brazilian, 41, and had surgery with dr. M. Littleton who is a local plastic surgeon and imo the best in the country for trans surgery. So far I&#39;m very pleased with the results. I&#39;ll leave some general info but feel free to AMA.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Advantages of the jejune mucosa graft (according to the surgeon): faster healing, better elasticity, easier dilation schedule, less risk of losing depth/girth, better lubrication, depth independent of original genitalia size, no need of hair removal nor risk of hair inside the canal.
</li>
<li>
Surgery: took close to 8 hours. Was my 1st surgery/hospital stay ever, and waking up &#34;instantly&#34; from general anesthesia is a trip lol. The jejunal graft is taken through laparoscopy (iirc) unless there&#39;s belly fat in the way, which was my case; so I have a C-section scar (which is healing super fine and according to the Dr. should fade about 1 year in). There was a 2nd surgeon to deal with the jejune harvesting. I spent 4 nights in the hospital; had a hard time because the bed was shit and not moving was hell. I didn&#39;t sleep except for one night, but once I got to the BnB and a comfortable, big bed, everything got 1000% better.
</li>
<li>
Recovery: intestinal function was restored in a couple of days, I was back on a normal diet after a week. I had zero pain and never had to take painkillers of any kind. Cath was removed on day 7 and wasn&#39;t a bother, quite the opposite -- super handy with the movement restrictions; removal was fine, just a burning sensation for a few seconds. Started dilating on day 10. Was cleared to sit after 6 weeks, when I also got back to work (been doing &#39;home office&#39; since week 2); and cleared for normal life at 12 weeks. The hardest part of recovery was restrictions on walking, sitting, clothing, movements etc -- by far the psychological effects of &#39;not being ready&#39;.
</li>
<li>
Dilations: once a day, 40 minutes; did a brief period of 2x/day because I was having a hard time getting the biggest dilator fully in. We&#39;re estimating every other day at the six-month mark, and after a year, once or twice a week -- but that&#39;s not a fixed schedule and we&#39;ll see how things are going once we get there. Not painful, but uncomfortable sometimes (particularly with size &#39;upgrades&#39;). As per instructions I use coconut oil to dilate instead of lube. I&#39;m using the biggest dilator on the kit which is ~15x4cm (had a bit of a hard time getting it through the pelvic floor muscles, but once I got it the first time it&#39;s been fine. I still take a bit of time to get to full depth).
</li>
<li>
Aesthetics: I&#39;m satisfied, especially with how things look under the labia. I&#39;m also really happy that there&#39;s never a visible &#34;hole&#34;, it remains closed even when spreading legs and after dilating. Clitoris and hood are so cute! I also like how his technique doesn&#39;t leave the usual &#34;V&#34; scars, but one &#39;vertical&#39; scar continuing from the &#39;top&#39; of my vulva.
</li>
<li>
Sensation: clit is sensitive, but nothing too wild (yet?). I haven&#39;t achieved an orgasm yet; haven&#39;t been trying much cause too much work, anxiety and other reasons. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a psychological thing I&#39;ll unlock in time. I&#39;m single and haven&#39;t gone back dating yet so I didn&#39;t had sexual relations of any kind so far.
</li>
<li>
Lubrication: haven&#39;t had much experience with that, but when I masturbate things to get pleasurably wet. I&#39;m not really expecting to have enough to do PIV without lube.
</li>
<li>
Smell: no weird odors. Things do get &#39;fishy&#39; after a day out sweating with a pad on, but it&#39;s pretty normal I suppose. I&#39;m quite sure it&#39;s a thing with the pads since I sleep without panties and wake up pretty &#39;fresh&#39;/no smell at all. I have a bit of discharge throughout the day so I use a panty liner.
</li>
<li>
Cleaning: douching not required or recommended, just outside washing in the shower.
</li>
<li>
Revision: should happen in a couple months, to address my only complication. I had necrosis in a small section of a labia minora, and lost about 1/4 of the length. It looked pretty awful when things were super swollen, but now it&#39;s not really that noticeable if you&#39;re not looking attentively. Still, I&#39;m getting it fixed. Dr. said there&#39;s enough material to work with and he&#39;ll make both sides more symmetric. Also there&#39;s some excess labia skin over my clit which makes it a bit hard to access, so he&#39;ll be fixing this too. I&#39;ll be getting a BA in the same surgery (500cc round, axillary, under the muscle).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
General thoughts: getting rid of genital dysphoria, the ease of dressing up, looking in the mirror and seeing the right reflection, even peeing... make it all worthwhile. Can&#39;t wait to have a normal romantic/sexual life after being impaired by dysphoria for so long. It&#39;s a bit of a dream, if I stop to think about it; at the same time it just feels totally natural, like it was always there. 10/10 would get GRS again, and I feel privileged that I had access to the procedure, and that I&#39;m having a great recovery.

Feliz demais por vc!
<br>
Thanks for posting this, there&#39;s almost no info online about the work he does, so I can&#39;t thank you enough.
<br>
I wish we would have more info about him and also other doctors from Latin America. First because we who live here often don&#39;t consider them options, secondly because they might be a much more affordable option to people who earn in dollars/ euros.
<br>
Brazilian doctors are good and people who leave Brazil often complain about the health system abroad. The country is a mess politically speaking, but if you can afford, don&#39;t be so quick to rule it out.

Not only they are more affordable, they&#39;re nearer and wouldn&#39;t require a trip across the globe (which can be done and surely top Thai surgeons do a great job, but still, hardly convenient). My second choice was actually Fidalgo in La Plata/AR.

So glad to hear a positive testimony of his technique with actual details! I&#39;m seriously considering going to him, as I&#39;ve talked before with you over on the brazilian subreddit (oi miga! rs)
</p>
<p>
How did the staff treat you? And wow that&#39;s a very lenient dilation schedule compared to the traditional penile inversion technique. How much depth did you get?

Haha oiê &lt;3!
</p>
<p>
About depth: I didn&#39;t ask. I know I have ~15cm at least because that&#39;s the length of the dilator. Before surgery he told me he does as much depth as the &#39;internal space&#39; allows.
</p>
<p>
Dilations: yup!! When chatting about dilation through these months he&#39;s always super chill about it, it took me some time to get the last dilator fully in but I never felt pressured, hurried or risking losing depth. (Well I did felt a bit anxious about it but you know how it is, I was like omg what if it never goes through the pelvic muscles?!?) I really think this is one of the best advantages of the technique.
</p>
<p>
Staff: surgeon staff or hospital? Dr.&#39;s staff is polite and correct, but sloooow. Now I know it&#39;s because they&#39;re super busy and not as numerous as we&#39;d expect, but still it&#39;s annoying for anxious people (i.e. all trans people lol). Hospital staff was pretty great and caring, except for one or two nurses that seemed kinda lost. But no harm done.
</p>
<p>
And yeah I wish brazilian girls would write more about their experiences instead of hiding in facebook groups! &gt;.&lt; Finding info here is awful.

Sadly my facebook is under my deadname, so often times I just get rejected from those groups because they think I&#39;m like a chaser or something lol
</p>
<p>
Staff: both, mostly. No problems with deadnaming or misgendering?

Ugh and you&#39;d think a group for trans ppl would understand these situations. (Then again stopping chasers must be a chore too)

<p>
No for both cases. Documentation was changed 2+ years ago so I wouldn&#39;t really expect it, deadname is really dead lol. A couple of nurses were curious and wanted to chat a bit about the procedure and stuff, mostly because the surgeon changed hospitals recently and I was the 1st being operated there. But they were nice and supportive and I didn&#39;t mind sharing my thoughts on the subject.

That&#39;s good to hear! Also, so jealous! I&#39;m due to change my documents too, and now that I got a job, hopefully I&#39;ll be able to afford it :D
</p>
<p>
As for the facebook stuff. I get it. My profile has literally no indication I&#39;m trans, or even that supportive - it&#39;s basically been abandoned for like three years plus. Only reason I didn&#39;t make a new account is my new email is already linked to facebook, and that&#39;s a headache I don&#39;t want to have right now (so basically I&#39;m lazy HAHAHA)

Happy for you friend, if you could answer some questions about how much you paid and what reports he asked you for? I&#39;m also Brazilian and I want to have the surgery with him, I would also like to see photos if you can post them or send them privately because photos of his results are difficult to find, if you can update us on sex, do you think the lubrication you have is enough to penetrative sex?

Can anyone please speak as to the cost of this option, and distinctions between it and peritoneal pull through?

My cost was around 45k BRL. I can&#39;t speak about peritoneal since afaik it isn&#39;t an option unless one&#39;s in the US and have access to insurance, but I&#39;m very happy with my results. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.
