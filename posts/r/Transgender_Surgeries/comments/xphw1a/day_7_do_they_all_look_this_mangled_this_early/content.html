I got discharged from the hospital yesterday and did my first dilation at the surgeon&#39;s office, which meant that I got to see my new vagina in bright light for the first time.
</p>
<p>
It was shocking to look at. I actually said &#34;Jesus!&#34; when I lowered the hand mirror to see it. It looked like he designed my vagina with a shotgun. The dilation tech actually had to point out where the canal was so I could enter it. It was like pushing my finger into raw ground beef.
</p>
<p>
I know that most neovaginas don&#39;t look great out of the gate, with the swelling, the blood clots, etc. But I had trouble seeing this thing as a vagina, it was that bad. I cried to myself the entire four hour drive home because I felt gross.
</p>
<p>
Do you think it will ever look remotely normal? Is this something any of you have ever gone through?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been telling myself to be patient and see how it looks once the swelling is down. I&#39;m also thinking, &#34;If it was botched, wouldn&#39;t one of the 8 or 9 students or techs who saw it have said something?&#34;

Mine looked like a Frankenpussy for 2-3 months after my first GCS.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll be amazed at how she&#39;ll look in a year. Tell your vag every day that you love her and you trust in her that she will be alright :)

Not all of them look great, especially straight away.
</p>
<p>
&gt; &#34;If it was botched, wouldn&#39;t one of the 8 or 9 students or techs who saw it have said something?&#34;

Probably not, unfortulately they all cover eachothers arse. Mine looked horiffic with stitches that looked like they were done by a 5 year old and nobody, not the other surgeon or any nurses said anything to me about them. There were girls in the next rooms with a different surgeon looking amazinz but i was just a rush job that he didnt give a crap about.

When I first looked at mine, she was swollen and bruised. First thing that came to mind was Bill Murray in ‚ÄúGhostbusters II‚Äù describing the Statue of Liberty: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a harbor chick!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
She looked like she‚Äôd been in a bar brawl, but I was confident we‚Äôd won. üòä
</p>
<p>
That was almost 11 months ago. Now, she looks like she‚Äôs always been there and it makes me so happy.

This happened to me as well. After taking my first shower post op I felt so disturbed with the healing parts and how raw everything felt. I‚Äôm now 5 1/2 weeks post op and the healing has gone wayyyyy better. Specially since the stitches dissolved on the outside, that‚Äôs been the best motivator!
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt feel the same anymore just be strong and push through it! In a couple weeks you‚Äôll see and feel the difference. I wish you a great recovery ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

Yeah there was a whole period of time it looked like a discolored stitched up baseball oozing weird colors with chunks of dried blood falling off. It gets better.

Once the swelling goes down and things heal you will be happy with the results.  Major surgery takes time to heal.  I‚Äôm sure if any of the 8 or 9 students in there thought something was wrong they would be obligated to say something.

Yes, it‚Äôll look horrible at first. Give it time and it will get better. At least a few weeks before the swelling begins to subside
