Wow he charges for everything. Tbh some of these procedures are very interrelated and could be argued that to charge individually is a bit much. For example forehead craniofacial requires full peel back of the forehead skin which makes a brow lift just a nothing extra, you peel that back and while doing forehead bone an orbital shape isn‚Äôt much more effort, then to sew it all back together you may as well advance the scalp as you‚Äôve cut everything you need, just have to release the scalp a bit and pull and suture it all back together. The jaw stuff I don‚Äôt know enough about but seems like one could tie a lot together? Nose fair call. Hope this doesn‚Äôt come across negatively, I just don‚Äôt want people bled dry of $

It‚Äôs for insurance purposes. You have to spread the codes out and hit the max allowed. Some surgeons without agreement letters will get pennies on the dollar. The quotes without insurance do not charge for each thing nor do they have the cpt code.

Nah, what you say makes sense - I went into it knowing it would be stupid expensive, regardless of the breakdown for individual procedures.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m lucky enough to have the ability to pay, and considering the crucialness of getting a good FFS result, the difference between paying say, 30k or 60k doesn&#39;t seem that great to me, though I fully understand I am coming from a position of extreme privilege here.

Is this a pretty typical cost guide or is this higher than other surgeons?

I think this is fairly typical for the &#34;top tier&#34; (or at least, most in demand) surgeons, although possibly not as expensive as others - see another recent post here yesterday with prices for Jumaily. Similar procedures and over 90k I think
</p>
<p>
There are definitely plenty of surgeons with more affordable prices, particular non-US ones with good reputations such as Cardenas.

I don&#39;t know what things currently look like, but this was my timeline:
</p>
<p>
8/31/2021: Submitted request for consultation, received April date
</p>
<p>
4/5/2022: Had consultation
</p>
<p>
7/1/2022: Finally decided to book surgery for the next available date next June
</p>
<p>
6/15/2023: Will be having surgery!
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
so apart from the 3 months spent thinking about it, about 18 months total from initial contact to surgery?

No I know, it&#39;s just the yearslong obsession with finding every thread to comment in - there have been lots of botched surgeries from various surgeons and I&#39;ve never seen that behavior from anyone else. Anyway I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s that serious, just curious ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Thank you for caring about my experience.  From my experience, this surgery was a waste of money(cash) with him. The results were devastating and the money it took to fix it all was life-changing.  You are completely right many do have botched surgeries from various surgeons but many times people are ashamed to put their faces to their follow up stories because they see exactly how dismissive people are. It is a humiliating experience for so many and I do hope you never have to go through that experience.

Dr.DB will just threaten you and your family with an army of lawyers forcing people to remove their negative experiences. Be aware of him and others who don&#39;t have many negative reviews.

Fair enough, I don&#39;t mean to downplay your experience or come off as a Keo shill.
</p>
<p>
I think my main issue is that it might give people the wrong impression - I have seen very few Keojampa bad outcomes, but going by social media, if someone isn&#39;t paying attention to usernames, they just see every Keojampa post with someone complaining about being botched, and think it&#39;s a more common occurrence than it really is
</p>
<p>
But then again, that hurts nobody but Keojampa, who I&#39;m sure is doing just fine, so I&#39;m probably just projecting my anxieties about things not going well for me onto you
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry :/

Fwiw I‚Äôve heard about Keo sending cease and desists to patients, which might be why you don‚Äôt see many botched cases.
</p>
<p>
Honestly I‚Äôm surprised this person posted the menu. Usually surgeons don&#39;t want their prices to be public
