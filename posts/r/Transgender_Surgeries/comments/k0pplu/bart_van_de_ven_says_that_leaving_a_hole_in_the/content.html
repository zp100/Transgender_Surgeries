Bart van de Ven says that leaving a hole in the bone of a patient&#39;s forehead after forehead recontouring &#34;happens regularly with all FFS surgeons&#34;. Has anyone else experienced this? See photos of my forehead after FFS with Bart van de Ven for reference.

<p>
I had FFS with Bart van de Ven, in 2017 including Type I forehead recontouring.  After the swelling had subsided, I noticed there was a dent in my forhead that made it look like my face had caved in. I emailed Bart the pictures above and he replied it was probably a torn muscle and that it would knit on its own. When I visited Bart for my four-months post-operative appointment, he felt the hole with his fingertips, yelped &#34;I don&#39;t understand&#34; in a panicked voice, then confirmed to me that the dent was indeed a hole in the bone of my forhead and suggested lipofilling to close it up. In our next appointment, he said that lipofilling would not be enough and to close the hole properly he would have to open my forehead again and close the hole with bone cement.
</p>
<p>
I agreed to a revision surgery that was performed in May 2018. It initially seemed to correct the problem, but the hole later re-opened and I can now again feel it with my fingertips and see it clearly when I lift my eybrows.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I should not lift my eyebrows?
</p>
<p>
Another of Bart&#39;s patients has recently reported that she was left with a hole in the bone of her forehad,
<a href="https://www.realself.com/review/facial-feminization-surgery-revision-ffs-dr-bart-van-de-ven">in a review
</a>
on
<a href="https://RealSelf.com">RealSelf.com
</a>
. Yesterday, Bart replied to her review with a comment to say that this is something that &#34;happens regularly with all FFS surgeons&#34;. He explained this by saying that during a Type I forehead recontouring the bone can be filed so thin that a hole forms after a few weeks or months and added that if the bone has too little blood circulation it can &#34;disappear&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I find it hard to believe that this is something that happens &#34;regularly with all FFS surgeons&#34;, as Bart says. For one thing, he seemed absolutely stunned with surprise when he examined me and realised that I had a hole in my bone.
</p>
<p>
In any case, if this happens &#34;regularly&#34; after a Type I then he should have informed me that it was likely to happen when he suggested I have a Type I. He never said anything about it then and when I asked him about possible complications he assured me that complications were rare and that most of the time they were minor, requiring only local anesthesia. The revision surgery I had to close the hole in my forhead was anything but minor: it was an entire new forhead recontouring operation under general anestehsia, every bit as invasive and expensive as the first one.
</p>
<p>
Bart also never explained to me, personally, what had happened to leave me with a hole in the bone of my forehead after his surgery, other than to say, with a smile, that it was just a &#34;nick&#34;. A &#34;nick&#34; requiring him to open my forehead again and close it with bone cement! Although I requested an explanation for this and other disfiguring results of his surgery through official channels, he has consistently ignored my requests and never given me a propper explanation.  It is only through his comment on
<a href="https://RealSelf.com">RealSelf.com
</a>
that I hear, for the first time, an explanation- and it seems to be designed not so much to explain what happened to the other patient, as to absolve the surgeon of any responsibilty, past or future.
</p>
<p>
These are unprofessional behaviours that deserve to mar the reputation of any surgeon who performs life-changing surgery. My life, indeed, has changed because of my surgery with Bart van de Ven- changed for the worse. I spent all my savings and underwent very invasive surgery to become better than I was and ended up worse,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ezum3y/ffs_with_bart_van_de_ven_3_years_on/">less feminine, looking older, scarred and disfigured
</a>
. And Bart&#39;s reaction was to ignore me, or come up with excuses to avoid taking responsibility for the mistakes he made during my surgery. I understand that mistakes can be made and the complications will happen during surgery, especially such a complex surgery as FFS. But, a true professional takes responsibility for and strives to correct their mistakes. At the very least I should have been given a clear explanation of what happened to my face, in a timely manner and not through a comment to a third party on an internet message board.
</p>
<p>
In light of the above, I can only reiterate my advise to
<a href="https://www.realself.com/review/facial-feminization-surgery-stay">stay away from Bart van de Ven
</a>
. There are better surgeons and there are surgeons who will take care of you if something goes wrong, like a real doctor should. Find one of them. Find a real doctor.

Omg thank you so much for posting. Dr.Bensimon ( Montreal) did my FFS in 3 hours which as greatly worried me because since multiple issues keeps arising. One of them is exactly that. Someone in the comments mentioned sinus bone dent from eyebrow to hairline. This is exactly what I have and I keep poking at it wondering what it was.  It was type 1 The guy totally botch me.
</p>
<p>
Anyone knows if it’s fixable?
</p>
<p>
This place is freaking awesome.

When I touched the dent in my forehead with my fingertips it was very obvious that there was a hole there, I could feel its edges and I could tell it was about pea-size.
</p>
<p>
Can you feel something like that in your forehead? If not, then maybe you&#39;re luckier than me and you only have a torn muscle. Before Bart had a chance to examine me in person, having only seen the pictuers I sent him, that&#39;s what he said the dent in my forhead was: a torn muscle.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re luckier than me and the dent in your forehead is a torn muscle, then it will most likely heal on its own, without you having to undergo any more invasive and expensive surgeries for &#34;revision&#34;. I hope and I wish you that this is the case and that your forehead heals on its own and that everything turns out well for you.

Um, no. It doesn&#39;t happen all the time.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Leaving a hole&#34; means that they shaved down the bone so much that there is no more bone covering the sinuses. This is why brow shaving really needs to be done by someone experienced. Those most experienced in the field (e.g., Dr Ousterhout who is now retired) have techniques to prevent it.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think that lipofilling was ever going to be successful here, but I am not a surgeon. My understanding is that the anterior aspect of the frontal sinus needs to be reconstructed with bone.
</p>
<p>
I would strongly recommend a second opinion.

It doesn&#39;t matter what he says. He is just full of shit. So his surgery is also full of shit that&#39;s why his poor patients end up with holes, nerve damage, cut arteries and god knows what else. His incompetence would not work on cisgender patients so he targeted trans women as we have less rights and are less likely to talk. He may actually hate trans women as to carry out such surgeries carelessly.

It might be worth calling around to other Plastic Surgeons and asking about it. Personally, it sounds like a load of crock. Namely, I feel like, fused or un-fused a hole in the sinus could lead to sub-dermal infections in the case of say...a sinus infection.
</p>
<p>
Also, skin is more elastic that bone, obviously. What happens if pressure in that sinus goes up? Do you just have to deal with having a bubble form on your forehead?

The funny thing is that when I saw him for a post-operative appointment a week after the operation (I stayed at the clinic in that time) I asked him whether I should be able to continue frree-diving, which I enjoy every summer. I was worried about the bone shaving, you see, and wanted to know whether it had perhaps weakened the wall of my sinuses to the point where it would risk breaking from the pressure when diving.
</p>
<p>
He said very firmly that no, there was no such danger because he had not breached the sinus wall. At the time my face was still the size and shape of a basketball so the hole was not visible, it was covered by the swelling.
</p>
<p>
To me, this suggests that he doesn&#39;t really know what he&#39;s doing and does not understand the surgeries he performs. When things go wrong he&#39;s surprised and doesn&#39;t know how to explain them to his patients or what to do to correct them- and retreats into CYA mode instead.
</p>
<p>
Obviously I had no idea before I went to him that he&#39;d be that way.

Hey everyone, so I did some research on this and everyone who has had issues with surgeries will notice one thing is that surgeons are a tight communities that stand together.
</p>
<p>
One of the best example is blepharoplasty. I personally cannot properly close my eyes now and when an optometrist tries to refer me to an ophthalmologist to look at them they straight out refuse to see me because it would mean they would need to say something bad against a surgeon.
</p>
<p>
That being said, here is what I found on the forehead crack and hole subject.
</p>
<p>
From the 2pass website. They explain that type 1 is practiced by too many surgeon which often result in a higher risk of thin frontal bone.
</p>
<p>
They state that only 10% of patient qualify for it but that surgeons still go ahead and practice it anyways.
</p>
<p>
But wait the best is.
</p>
<p>
In the same page.
</p>
<p>
There is a disclaimer that. If you end up with issues tho. It’s not because of the surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Pretty funny that to get your business. Doing this type 1 surgery to someone with an enlarge sinus would be consider at risk and a recipe for disaster and therefore and obviously the surgeon’s fault if an issues arise for recommending the procedure.
</p>
<p>
But disclaimer time. If an issue arise. It’s not anyone’s fault. Am I the only one who is confused here?
</p>

Thank you,
<a href="/u/HealthyCompote9573">u/HealthyCompote9573
</a>
. That&#39;s interesting. I looked up the &#34;Brow bone reduction&#34; page from the 2Pass website on the WaybackMachine:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111212823/https://2pass.clinic/en/ffs/procedures/brow-bone-reduction">https://web.archive.org/web/20201111212823/https://2pass.clinic/en/ffs/procedures/brow-bone-reduction
</a>
</p>
<p>
The latest capture is from 11 November 2020, so a couple of weeks ago. The section you highlight, on the possible complications of a type I and how it&#39;s not the surgeon&#39;s fault, is missing.
</p>
<p>
The following is the text missing from the November 11 capture. This text was added only very recently, perhaps in the last few days:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Possible complications
</p>
<p>
In a type 1 forehead recontouring,  bone is milled off and the frontal sinus remains closed. However, it  often happens that the bone is so thin at the end of the procedure that  after weeks/months, a hole still forms in the frontal sinus front wall.  If the bone has too little blood circulation it can disappear.
</p>
<p>
Usually,  the patient will not notice this because it is a small hole. Because  the skin around the hole is fused with the bone, no air can come out of  the frontal sinus subcutaneously.
</p>
<p>
However, if the hole is larger, a  small dent in the bone may become visible. This dent can be filled with  some fat from the tummy or legs (lipofilling). Another solution can be a  new forehead recontouring in which the front wall of the frontal sinus  is removed and the sinus is filled with bone cement. In this way, the  forehead can be given the desired shape.
</p>
<p>
This is something that  happens regularly with all FFS surgeons. It, therefore, says nothing  about the quality of the operation or the surgeon. Some patients heal  differently than others.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So I guess this text was added to the website because it kept happening too often that enough patients raised a stink about it.
</p>
<p>
Like I say, I was never given any indication that something like this may happen, let alone that it is common result of a Type I forehead recontouring.
</p>
<p>
I also note that the Type I was recommended to me by Bart van de Ven. I didn&#39;t ask for a Type I. I am not sure why he recommended a Type I. The website says that it has to do with how thick the bone is and how large the sinus- can a surgeon know this before performing an operation?
</p>
<p>
Edit: I hope you can find a doctor to take care of your blepharoplasty issues.

Thanks. Well this has enlightened me so much on the challenges we all face.
</p>
<p>
The funniest thing about all of this. Is that we 3 ago I had a call with Bensimon his lawyer and CMC’s lawyer during which he admitted that “some” of my concerns about the crap that happened around my surgery was legitimate. This is all confidential and cannot be used in court and was aimed at me not suing xxx and going public. As you can see. I chose the let’s go ballistic and make a difference approach. One thing I hadnt complained to him as of yet was my forehead which I did during this called and explained.
</p>
<p>
He knows I call and look at every surgeon every everywhere. Website,material, everything I can find. So not saying it’s related but not surprised to see that the website that bashes surgeons doing type 1. Suddenly have disclaimer saying it’s in no way a proof of the surgeons ability,etc, etc.

Yes, I did. I paid for the hospital costs and anesthesia. This is despite the offer I was made in writing had a &#34;satisfaction guarantee&#34; saying that no hospital costs would need to be paid by the patient in case of revision, as follows:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
SATISFACTION GUARANTEE
</p>
<p>
We offer a guarantee that if a patient is not satisfied with the result of any procedure, we will correct this if surgically possible, without charging any surgical fees or hospital costs. Only anesthesia cost and cost of special materials and traveling costs are for the expense of the patient. It is our experience that big changes may need some small retouch afterwards (mostly local anesthesia).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Confusingly, the consent form I signed on the night before the surgery had a different &#34;guarantee&#34; that said the patient would pay the hospital costs.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I did pay both hospital costs and anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
Note also how the &#34;guarantee&#34; above says that only a small retouch may be needed and mostly with local anesthesia. I was given exactly the same assurances that complications were mostly minor and revision was rarely needed at the capable hands of Bart van de Ven and that if revision was needed, it would only be minor revision with local anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
I was also told in person that I would only have to pay for anesthesia and materials in case of revision.

I didn’t go to this surgeon, I went to Dr. Spiegel in Boston. I also have a dent on my forehead after ffs, but it runs vertically from my eyebrows to hairline. Dr. Spiegel told me 95% it would go away after healing. He also doesn’t believe in CT scans. It’s been 5 months so far and it doesn’t seem to be going away. I really don’t want to have another forehead surgery, and the first ffs surgery was crazy expensive ($66k). Praying everyday that it goes away but I doubt it will. It makes my face look a lot more masculine too which is just salt in the wound

I have the same the exact same thing. It goes from my hairline to my eyebrow. Like I wonder if my skull is cracked. ll try to get a scan and see what the cause is. You described it really well.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for sharing. This has in isle way given me some sense of not feeling alone.

A few people actually DM&#39;d me saying this happened to them too, which also helped me to not feel alone on this issue. One said it went away, some said it did not.

It&#39;s possible there&#39;s different causes that result in the same, or similar, outwards appearance. For example, you girls both describe a long depression that runs vertically from forhead to hairline. This definitely sounds different than what happened to me, which was a circular depression, like I was struck with a hammer. Hopefully what happened to you is not permanent and does not need revision, as in my case.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I wish you all the best and a quick recovery. Like I say in my other comment, 5 months is still early. Hold on! And I hope you end up happy with your results.

I did. Turns out in my case it’s defects form surgery. I have to get a whole new forehead reconstructive surgery with like some goretex type of material to rebuilt the forehead. Ty Jeffrey Jumaily. I am just saving money to pay another 70k to fix my face.
</p>
<p>
Message me in private if you want and I’ll let you know when I get and if it will fix it. Tho I don’t expect it to be in the short term. Really hope that’s not what you have. Cuz I really am not happy to get reopen like that.

Did Dr. Spiegel explain what caused the dent on your forehead? If he says it will go away then perhaps it is something transient, and not permanent like in my case.
</p>
<p>
In my case, I could feel the hole with my fingertip and it was unmistakably a hole in the bone, I could feel the edges and tell that it was about pea-size and everything.
</p>
<p>
If you can&#39;t feel the same thing then maybe you are luckier than me and what you describe is something different, for example a torn muscle (which is what Bart said to me it was, originally). In that case, it may well heal on its own.
</p>
<p>
At five months post-op, it&#39;s still early to know what&#39;s going to happen. So don&#39;t worry too much- I&#39;m sure that what happened to me is actually rare and it won&#39;t happen to you too. Especially since you went to a different surgeon, who sounds like he knows what he&#39;s doing.
</p>
<p>
Did you have a Type I btw?

Yeah I think it’s different, I just mentioned it since similar topic. A few people have messaged me that they have/had similar dents like mine so at least I know it’s not as rare as I thought before.
</p>
<p>
I’m honestly not sure what type, I forgot. He took out a bone and chiseled it down then put it back. I believe a titanium screw was used with bone cement.

Don&#39;t they waffle on how when the risk of making a hole in the sinus is too great that they have to use a different method on their website?

I was reading on their site I think that you need a different type if the sinus turns out too thin to be shaven down. And I don&#39;t think they mentioned bone just disappearing because of &#34;lack of blood flow&#34; as a complication

Thanks. It seems their understanding of why this happens continues to evolve- which I suspect is because it continues to happen to their patients.

I&#39;m in no way an expert but from what you report I would be wary of them potentially trying to cover these things up. Because they&#39;re first and foremost a business that&#39;s not to be confused with a standard health care peovider.

Oh, of course, the clinic and the surgeon himself tries to CYA everything that goes wrong instead of taking responsibilty for his mistakes and trying to correct them.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had other issues with him. For example, he reduced my lower lip to about half its size and then tried to argue that it&#39;s better this way because a smaller mouth is more feminine.

I&#39;ve honestly never heard of anyone saying &#34;Oh that woman&#39;s mouth is so huge it&#39;s unfeminine&#34;

Faces aren&#39;t about specifics, they&#39;re about the ratios of the elements toward each other.

Oh  yes, I don&#39;t doubt that this is a good explanation of what happened to me. But if it&#39;s something that happens regularly, as Bart states in the
<a href="https://RealSelf.com" rel="nofollow">RealSelf.com
</a>
post then he should have warned me that it was likely to happen so that I could make an informed decision whether to have that type of surgery (and to have it with him) or not.
</p>
<p>
At the very least he should have offered this explanation when I asked him what happened to my forehead. Instead all I got is that it was a &#34;nick&#34;. Which explains nothing of course.

Of course I hope it all ends well for you, but if it&#39;s any comfort: It got me off the nagging thoughts of potentially getting bone contouring myself. I find plastic surgeons extremely suspect anyway and since I pass despite my forehead shape (and since it&#39;s going to be years until I could afford such a thing anyway) I&#39;m probably going to leave it alone. I would wager I still wouldn&#39;t recognise myself in the mirror anyway no matter what they do to me, and in and of itself that&#39;s fine.

I had similar reservations. I had been living as a woman for 20 years already so I didn&#39;t need surgery to pass. I guess I just wanted to see my face in a certain way, before I grow too old. I should have left things they way they were- don&#39;t try to fix what is not broken etc. I had hoped that the surgeon would recommend only necessary surgeries because I really didn&#39;t know what was needed. I was actually turned down for jaw recontouring by one of the Thai doctors (said I don&#39;t need it), so I figured maybe they&#39;re not all greedy bastards after all.

I had a very extensive type 3 forehead with dr Bensimon in Canada. My results are excellent. He used a titanium mesh to hold everything in place and then made a bone shaving slurry and applied it over the break points which allowed my bones to knit itself much faster. Both techniques prevent dents or stuff like that.  If you are willing, go to dr Bensimon for your revision. He will lay down the titanium mesh and smooth everything out. You will have excellent result with him!  Also, he is also a very kind and gentle man.  And the prices are more affordable. Maybe even less even with the plane ticket.

Hum no thank you. Will never let that guy touch me ever again. I went Bensimon and I have exactly what people here are describing so he’s not any better. The m fact he did my FFS in 3 hours. Which is the the shortest FFS time I’ve actually heard. So he would be the last I would recommend.

It was at the end of 2016. His last day of work of 2016. Dec 19th. Since then problems just keeps erupting. Well he did my FFS in 3 hours 7min and had the staff called the next patient on her cell during my surgery so that she come right away to the CMC so that he start on her. He was planning to finish early for holiday vacation and he did.
</p>
<p>
How do I know that? She was my neighbour and straight out told me the evening when we were both awake. She had gotten a facelift.
</p>
<p>
So  with my eyelid not closing, my chin that needs hardware, etc etc. Now if he permanently f me because he remove to much bone....

Can you say how you know this, about small holes being common? I never found that information anywhere and it was not explained to me by Bart before or after my surgeries with him.

I had a type 1 with Dr. Z and do not have anything like your indention.  This clearly is not normal.

Yeah I also have the same thing after my surgery with him. I&#39;m overall happy with my results but definitely this is the only thing that bugs me 😕

So it is common, at least with this surgeon. When was your surgery, if I may pry? Mine was in February 2017 (and the revision surgery in May 2018).

I was tempted but I&#39;m not super keen on having my forehead cut up again just for that. If there was a less invasive way I would be more inclined to ask.

Hi! I just came upon this post and wanted to know if you were able to come to any resolution regarding this? (Or anyone else reading) But I received Type 3 forehead recontouring with Dr. Lee in 2016. I&#39;ve noticed this dent for awhile now but I feel like it is progressively getting larger. I have chronic allergies, and I read that there may be potential complications with those who already have sinonasal issues. If anyone has any insight it would be greatly appreciated if you shared. I contacted Dr. Lee&#39;s office but his office was not very eager to help me.
