Hi again! Let’s go with days 8 and 9, although I must warn you that there wasn’t much happening in these days. These two were a bit part of the waiting game.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 8
</em>
Today went by without much novelty. Days are starting to become somewhat repetitive and all that happened today was just routine. I woke up with a bit of morning sickness, as has been usual, but it seems it’s starting to go better.
</p>
<p>
I had my usual doctor visit and everything is healing well, even quicker than what is average. Pain is almost gone, save for some sporadic pangs of pain.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 9
</em>
I woke up with barely any morning sickness. It seems that I’m finally getting over this thing and whatever was its cause!
</p>
<p>
Day went on as normal but this time I got some exciting news in my daily examination: the meatus area is healing wonderfully and the catheter will be removed tomorrow morning! Dilations can then start on Monday and discharge will probably be the day after, on Tuesday, for a total of 14 days in the hospital. I’m slightly nervous about the catheter removal and then having to pee myself (as well as the very real possibility that it goes back in if I don’t), but it’s also exciting as I won’t need to go around with the catheter bag anymore, which I’m really looking forward too!
</p>
<p>
Pain in the surgical area is insignificant, although there’s new developments in the area. Nerves are reconnecting more intensively now! I get all kind of sensations now. Sometimes is just a sort of tingle, others it feels like zaps between my new genitals and my brain. I also feel heat at times and even, sporadically, as if someone was touching my new labias. They can be really weird sensations, but it also means that nerves are starting to reconnect and remap, which is great! Until now, I had had some level of sensation, but the whole area (except the clitoris!) was sort of numb.
</p>

Days 6 and 7
