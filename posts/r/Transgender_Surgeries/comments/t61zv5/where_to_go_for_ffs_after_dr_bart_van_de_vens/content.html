30k euros is within range for facialteam, at least it was last year. I had forehead,nose, jaw+chin, and tracheal shave done and including hospital and hotel feels it came down to 34k.
</p>
<p>
So depending on what you wish to do and if you can get any procedure partially covered by insurance it could be in budget. Consultations were free and quite exhaustive so you could discuss it.

Thanks so much! Can anyone list more abroad options? What about USA? Are the good ones necessarily very expensive? What about Thailand? Does anyone know pros and cons? Again, help very appreciated!

I&#39;ve never heard of Dr. Maini either, he seems to be a very new surgeon. Can you link me to surgery results of his? How many FFS procedures has he done already?
</p>
<p>
He could be the new budget FFS option in Europe. And we desperately need that.

He doesn’t promote himself to much, but he had been doing FFS for a few years now. He doesn’t put any images online, but if you have a consult with him he has loads to show you.

There is also Dr. Janusz Jaworowski and his team performing FFS and SRS in Poland (clinic name is &#34;Timeless&#34;). His prices are probably comparable with the ones 2Pass used to have (maybe a bit cheaper). He is not really all that well-known but you may want to check him out:

</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there are not that many well-documented before-and-afters floating around the web currently but I&#39;ve seen one gamer girl who went to him this year for full FFS and it seems he delivered a good result. She posted her FFS journey video on YouTube (skip to 16:30 to see her face reveal):

Dr Norman Koebe of the Koebe Klinik near Düsseldorf, Germany is also a maxillofacial and plastic surgeon. In my opinion the prices are on the higher side, but he seem to have a very good reputation. However, they do not specialize specifically in ffs and I did not see any before and after pictures. I don&#39;t think they are allowed to do that in Germany so that might be the reason.
</p>
<p>
One other thing I am not sure about when considering them is that there is a tendency in Germany to be more conservative, while doctor Bart was of course considered quite radical at times with amazing results (if it worked out it seems..).

It’s because he was not a good surgeon and ruined many trans women’s lives. You should consider yourself very lucky that he did not operate on you because there’s a probability you could have ended up botched.

Getting FFS

<p>
There is a service called
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9ucqeo/virtual_ffs_experiences/e93gg97/" rel="nofollow">virtualFFS</a>
and consulting them in case may be a good idea. They also know surgeons. It may be necessary to discuss with them the kind of approach though. A standard may be a moderate approach. Be aware that with a more aggressive approach results can look more mask like, and less individual.
</p>
<p>
They could make a few suggestions including a minimal one. More details are

Hi Valerie, I went to facial team in 2018, they are excellent. I was 42 at the time and had a HUGE jaw and brow bone so could never pass. Now I have absolutely no problem, if I don&#39;t tell someone then they just don&#39;t know I&#39;m trans. I know everyone&#39;s results will vary but I think they have an excellent scientific approach to facial feminisation. I had forehead reconstruction, eye sockets shaved, jaw reconstruction, trachea shave and rhinoplasty (and it was a brilliant nose job - totally love it!! I had Dr Bellinga for my nose). I also got hair transplants at the same time. They are expensive and I was not sure about doing it at the time but it was such a good decision to go ahead with it. Financially speaking I really couldn&#39;t afford the hair but it really made a big difference to my overall appearance. Total cost for me was approximately 35k including hospital, anesthesia, recovery stay afterwards for 10 days in Aldea (also something I highly recommend as they have medical staff on site, and they wash your hair etc every day to look after and clean the wounds)
</p>
<p>
If I could offer one piece of advice, don&#39;t shop around by price. Facial team are not cheap but they are good, you have one face don&#39;t risk it for a smaller bill at the end. Talk to them and arrange a consultation,if you can travel to Marbella for the appointment all the better as I think they will do a CT scan if you go there which will give them, and you, a very good idea of what they can achieve. They can also do a Photoshop virtual FFS but in my case the final result is actually far better than the virtual images so I think it can be a little hard to judge from them. If you are tight in budget then try to wait a little (easier said than done) but once you have saved for everything then you can do it all in one go. If you have to break it into two or more procedures over time it is a lot more expensive since you will have hospital, anesthesia etc etc all to pay again.
</p>
<p>
Beat of luck with your search.

I heard DR DB in USA is very good. Although he must be very expensive, but from what I read his result is even much superior. Perhaps it could be an option?

I am shattered to hear that, he was the only doctor that could help me with my chin and jaw (ft and a local surgeon near me couldnt, i checked)

I would consider Dr. Spiegel or Harrison Lee for the overall results now
