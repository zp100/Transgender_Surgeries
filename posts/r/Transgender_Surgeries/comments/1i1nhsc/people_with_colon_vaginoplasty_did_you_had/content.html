Yes I had colon vaginaplasty, it caused obstructive defecation, chronic UTIs and excessive discharge, disuse colitis with bleeding and I ended up having it removed by 2 bowel surgeons. It was the worst decision in my life. It had no sensation and was tight and stinky.

Within 6 months. The problem is, behind the actual neovagina is about 15cm of unused sigmoid flap, the total length is 30cm, so half of which can‚Äôt be dilated. What happens to unused colon, not fed with nutrients by the colon? It bleeds from disuse. There‚Äôs theories you can feed it with something, made no difference for me. I would bleed every time I‚Äôd dilate. I gave it 3.5 years before making the decision to have it removed and focus on bowel function.

I&#39;ve had mine for three and a half years now and have had no issues besides occasionally large amounts of discharge (which i personally find to just come with the territory of having a vagina), and a tendency towards constipation if I don&#39;t get enough fiber and water. I&#39;m very happy with my results.

i have colon done and i opened this thread to ask for long term complications to see what other might have experienced, i by myself don&#39;t have a lot of problems except just some minor tearing from intercourse which ended in minor bleeding but as i got informed by my surgeon and now different people which had colon done is normal to a degree. So what i can say is that around the colon method there seem to be some myths which aren&#39;t true at least there are some half truths about it and the reasons why certain things are like they are have another reason. Like the poop smell for an instance and the neverending flow of lubrication. It seems that those myths came from half truths in my opinion and I can say that as long as you take care of the vaginal flora there isn&#39;t alot of smell going on after it is properly healed and there is no poop smell at all. In the beginning the colon method is keen to have a smell because a lot of the inner tissue will kinda renew itself with shedding, therefore there is alot of death skin and bacteria matter mixed with colonal mucous inside the vaginal canal which has to be douched out properly but there is no fecal matter left which can be the reason for any poop like smell because you have to undergo a laxative bowel prep and dont eat pre surgery to get rid of any fecal matter. Also every vaginal canal which has a moist environment, will have a certain smell to it anyway as natal vaginas do too. About the neverending lubrication, it is very likely to experience more discharge due the colon re-adjusting to the new environment and can take up to a year or sometimes longer till it&#39;s normalised but for most after some time it will normalise eventually as soon as there is a stable vaginal flora.

I‚Äôve read about so many people having trouble with vaginoplasties that I‚Äôm thinking about getting a vulvoplasty instead. (so that would be a zero depth surgery).  My reasoning is that I really don‚Äôt want to have to deal with all the potential problems, and possibility of lifetime Dilation, and also it would not require pre-surgical Electrolysis. I‚Äôm a 72 year-old lesbian trans girl, and I‚Äôm not interested in penetration so zero depth surgery is looking very appealing.

Your age and orientation does make sense for mininal depth.
</p>
<p>
However keep in mind that places like this one, aren&#39;t indicative of the overall success rate or even the average picture of the surgery. Or any surgery. There&#39;s gonna be a huge negativity bias because the people who didn&#39;t have any issues will likely just come here to ask pre op questions and then go on with their lives.

I agree with you. I think it all boils down to the amount of risk we as individuals are willing to take on. What would give me a better understanding would be actual numbers or percentages.

Hi there when I had the old school Penile inversion, absolutely no issues whatsoever (but I‚Äôm am planning a labiaplasty for aesthetics) but I penile inversion is the safest one I heard the PPV ( Peritoneal Pull-Through Vaginoplasty) is also a better latest option. I see that you‚Äôre over 70 I know a lot of older ladies would simply prefer zero depth b/c they don‚Äôt want the dilation or they‚Äôre not interested in penetration

I had my colon SRS just a year ago and I&#39;m really happy with it so far.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have any problems with my intestine, which is now a bit shorter and has no sigmoid, and I also don&#39;t have any problems with my vagina.
</p>
<p>
At first, the shape of the SRS caused a lot of mucus, but after six months the discharge went back to the normal amount for a cis woman.
</p>
<p>
I also have no problems having sex with my boyfriend and don&#39;t need any lubricant because I have enough natural moisture.
</p>
<p>
However, I will be undergoing a prolapse in a week.
</p>
<p>
The reasons for this can be very different and could also be because I do a lot of sport and go to the gym regularly.

Thank you, that&#39;s very kind of you!
</p>
<p>
I asked Theerapong some time ago.
</p>
<p>
He wanted almost the same price for the correction of the prolapse as I paid Kamol for the complete SRS.
</p>
<p>
That is absolutely unacceptable in terms of price for me and to be honest, his results, which you receive via WhatsApp or Line, don&#39;t look that impressive visually.
</p>
<p>
For comparison - in Bangkok, other doctors usually wanted between 4,000 and 6,000 euros for revising another doctor&#39;s work.

A prolapse can have various causes or even a mixture of different things.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that in my case it is some kind of tissue weakness, which was also caused by a lot of training in the gym and physical work.
</p>
<p>
But I won&#39;t know for sure until a week from now, because that&#39;s when I have my preliminary examination for the planned procedure in Thailand.

I have had my sigmoid vagina going on 4 years now and am very happy. I had it done with Dr. Djordjevic back in July 2021. Horrible initial recovery but great in the long run. I had a revision with Dr. Littleton in November to address my issues of aesthetics and excessive erectile tissue.  I had issues with slight bleeding and thick mucus around the 6 month- 2 year mark, i avoided the issue with douching and water based lube. After my initial consult with Littleton at 2-5yr post op he said I have minor colitis in my vagina, prescribed me mesalazine suppositories and he recommended to stop douching and use food quality oils (coconut/almond etc.) to dilate and for intercourse. It‚Äôs important to nourish the canal with fatty acids to keep it healthy.  Since implementing these things into my lifestyle i‚Äôve had no issues. :)

Is coconut and almond oil to dilate is enough? i hear someone using clarified butter i just had a bigger bleeding 3 years post op after intercourse. i need to get it checked but my surgeon said it could be a friction based bleeding where several small tears occured so i had some blood cloth like discharge after douching the next time i dilated. i douched after intercourse but it wasnt really bleeding then. im thanking you, i was looking for ans answer like that but i would be happy to hear if the oils would be enough to nurture the colon walls.

no problem at all, i‚Äôm happy to share :) ya the oils are working for me. i have also read about the clarified butter -i mean it does makes sense, i wouldn‚Äôt knock it until i try it! I‚Äôm going to stick to oils for now as they are working for me, personally the idea of using butter seems mad, but then again the whole thing is a bit mad lol. Alsooo littleton also told me to stop douching as it ruins your micro biome down there. I found this really helpful. Djordjevic had told me to douche daily if i wanted to üôÑ I think this is what had made me so sensitive and uncomfortable down there. I was also tearing during intercourse. When i was transiting to my new ‚Äòoil based routine‚Äô i tried douching with oil in a syringe. That helped a lot.

thank you sososo much I&#39;m so happy to hear im not alone with the tearing stuff. i never had big problems with it before hand or rather it was never so extreme but i feel a bit more at ease, i will see it tomorrow my surgeon will have a look but he said its unlikely that something serious happend because it didnt bleed to an extend where i had blood flow from it or after bleeding. do you use both oils or just one?

right!! the experience can feel very isolating, you‚Äôre definitely not alone. i think bleeding is a very normal thing too, like blood is the body‚Äôs way to heal. Yeah i use both oils. i prefer the smell of almond but i like how coconut is solid, you can get a lump of it and push it up into your canal and then your sorted for whatever activities:) i imagine variety is good, littleton even said olive oil is great but the smell is that bit stronger.

sure, pre revision every 1/2 months. post revision, daily since 6 weeks to make sure no scar tissue tightens things up too much.

thanks for the answers and btw i sorted it out with my surgeon and he had a look into my vaginal canal, it was a bit irritated but he said its probably from the intercourse and everything seem to be fine now. I asked if he would recommend the almond/coconut oil and he was a bit reserved about it. he knew about the possibility of colitis but his patients never had it to a very strong degree. he does surgery since 15+ years so im not sure if he has even seen a patient which could develop it? Im actually not sure in which time it could develop to a serious degree because i just saw an article about a transgender woman who had colon done for about 20 years or so and in every other case they said it was minor to middle stage, soo i asked if there is a downside and he said he wouldn&#39;t say its bad but he was a bit concerned about the ph change which the oil could provoke and that it could lead to spots where the oil has a hard time to drain and might make it hard for the colonal skin to operate normally. Did your surgeon say similar things?

i didn‚Äôt think much of his aesthetics, or him lol. His aftercare was little to none. Nothing compared to Dr. Littleton‚Äôs knowledge, perfectionism and attention to detail

It is the only vaginoplasty tissue that can be fisted in the same way as a cis natal vagina. Many people achieve fantastic outcomes with this surgery, try searching this subreddit.
