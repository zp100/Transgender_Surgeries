Hi everybody,
</p>
<p>
This is specifically for those who had peritoneal pull through vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
I am very interested in this procedure and had a few questions.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Does it provide extra lubricantion as they claim?
</li>
<li>
Why did you go for it as opposed to PiV
</li>
<li>
Is there any discharge?
</li>
<li>
Dilation frequency?
</li>
<li>
Do you feel you have more depth compared to PIV?
</li>
<li>
Is there anything you wish you knew beforehand that you know now?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Please only answer if you feel comfortable sharing.
</p>
<p>
Thank you  üíï
</p>

Yes but not enough for sex or dilating. It‚Äôs like enough to stick a finger in without much issue and it will always feel warm/moist. Most of the self lubrication still comes from the cowpers when aroused
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not enough penile length, horror stories of Penile Inversion smelling like a penis and having scarring that makes it rapidly close.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It‚Äôs clear and basically odorless but yes PPT has a discharge. Sometimes it builds up in the back of the canal and leaks out after dilating so you‚Äôll feel it running down your legs after.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
At 6 months once a day is plenty for me to maintain depth but the surgeon wants twice a day still so I do it twice a day when I have the time and energy. It drops to 1-3 times a week after 1 year for life and depends how often you feel you need to do it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I wouldn‚Äôt of had enough depth with penile inversion so yes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
That PPT gets a micro biome similar to a natal vagina and self cleans if you‚Äôre lucky, I don‚Äôt have to douche at all anymore and douching seems to actually do more harm than good for me cause it damages the tissue and makes the self lubrication worse + causes weird odors

Mine does.
</li>
<li>
Self-lubrication, self-cleaning, the peritoneal tissue is known to metaplase into mucous membrane when exposed to topical estrogen, no fear of internal hair, all external tissue available for aesthetics when constructing vulva, no need for a life-long dilation schedule, long track record among MRKH patients, and I was just and just able to afford it.
</li>
<li>
Yes
</li>
<li>
I&#39;m still dilating as often as I can a year from my revision. I had 7&#34; depth until that, which shrunk to 6&#34; when I needed to let the area heal without dilating.  I stopped for about a month one year after the revision when BF and I separated‚Äîand lost a bit more ... so... I&#39;ve decided to keep up as often as possible for a while longer.
</li>
<li>
I don&#39;t know.
</li>
<li>
Keeping to a dilation schedule longer than  instructed may be necessary in some cases. At one year my vaginal lining had metaplased into pink mucosal tissue. The urethral meatus seems to also be gradually turning a light pink, but parts are still dark red. Ask for time to discuss hoped for aesthetics before surgery, with pictures if possible. Stay in good contact with the doctors post-op‚Äîthey can&#39;t know what you don&#39;t report to them.

8 mo post.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
It&#39;s consistently damp inside but not enough for dilation or sex.  Enough to get a finger in though.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I had full ppt so I was able to get it sooner with less hair removal, since all the external skin stays external.  That&#39;s also means more sensitive skin tissue available for external aesthetics.  I was also hopeful reading about the conversion of peritoneal to mucosal tissue.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There was some excess in the beginning but it has since cleared up.  There&#39;s enough to help keep things self cleaning, but not enough to leave stains on my underwear.  I don&#39;t douche anymore, and use an occasional probiotic suppository.  It smells and tastes as it should. I have found that some lubes will cause more fluid osmosis through the membrane which can leak out during dilation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;ve been doing once a day for the last couple months, I&#39;ve been dabbling with every other day.  Eventually you&#39;ll get a feeling for how often you need to, and can increase or decrease frequency.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;ve got about 5 to 5 and a half inches of depth.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It takes a long time for the nerves to heal, I still have numbness but it is slowly returning.  I&#39;m still happy with my results, and my surgeon, and would still go with ppt if I were to do it all over again.

I&#39;m researching discharge so looking back through posts and I&#39;m wondering about this part as I&#39;ve never heard about it before.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Do you mean the act of using lube somehow simtulates more natural fluids to be available at the time? Or that lube gets absorbed and then leaks out later?
</p>
<p>
What has your experience with the tissue conversion been like? I&#39;m really only seeing that for the first time today too, and some people are talking about reductions in lucrication/discharge as well as changing from red to pink (I&#39;ve definitely seen some very red looking surgery photos which stood out.)
</p>
<p>
Do you find you need to permantly wear pads? That&#39;s the main question I&#39;m trying to answer atm.

Vaginal opening is where it is on cis women unlike PI which tends to be more forward. I liked the aesthetics more.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Only 6 weeks out. Still getting discharge. Gross. But I‚Äôll live. Invest in ice packs and Citric Aid Clear.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
This will be doctor specific. Gupta only wants twice a day to start but I know some do it three times a day.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Wasn‚Äôt allowed to dilate for two due to severe complication. I maintained 6‚Äù. Slowly working to 6.5‚Äù. Not easy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Make sure your surgeon knows how to do their job. Stay away from Rachel Pope who does work for Gupta at all costs. I‚Äôm planning a post later. It‚Äôs been a nightmare. I will have more revision surgeries than PI‚Ä¶. Fuck
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Also If your pelvic floor muscles are strong dilating may be hard. So working on relaxation, physical therapy, deep breathing help. It‚Äôs different the way the canal opening is made compared to PI. Slightly different.

Hi. Can u please explain why to avoid Pope? I have surgery scheduled with her 45 days from now.

Its always risky going with little known surgeons. I guess you can get some idea by seeing Gupta&#39;s work since they seem to work together.
</p>
<p>
Look here with a web browser, not a reddit app.
