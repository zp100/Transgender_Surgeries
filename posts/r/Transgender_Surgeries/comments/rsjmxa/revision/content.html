Hey guys I will be having a revision done to remove excess erectile tissue . For anyone that’s had this procedure how long did it take to heal ? Did you bleed a lot ? Pain anything similar to the original GRS surgery ? I’ve had penile inversion. Would you mind sharing photos ?

I’ve had this done twice because Dr. Gast is terrible.  Blood, there’s a good amount. I had to wear pads for weeks.  Pain is a lot less. I took pain medicine for 1-2 days post op. After that I could take ibuprofen and was fine.  Took me at least 6 weeks to heal and 7-8 to be able to have penetrative sex.

Why do you say Dr. Gast is terrible?

Look through this subreddit and read other girls stories. They also have a Facebook page for girls dealing with Gast results.  I’ve had three surgeries on my vagina from her and my vagina looks so bad. She says it looks so good and won’t do more revisions lol.
