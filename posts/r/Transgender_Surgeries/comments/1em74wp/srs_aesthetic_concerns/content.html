I’ve had SRS colovaginplasty 2 months and a half ago. It went well so far, didn’t have any complications so far, and dilation is fairly easy and can take around 7”  Was able to orgasm like 2 weeks ago, so it also has sensation and it’s actually pretty sensitive and can orgasm within minutes
</p>
<p>
My only concern is the aesthetic, at the moment it’s not exactly what I was excepting in my head. It looks extremely natural and pretty from standing up, my friends are amazed at how natural it looks The issue to me, is looking at it from standing down legs open, it is still on the swollen side I think, it looks like I’ve only got labia majora, I can’t see the clit for the life of me, and if I open the lips, there’s literally no signs of the minora I was a circumcised from a young age, and they decided to go for colon because I didn’t have enough material to work with. Scarring is pretty good and not noticeable as they done a good job with putting scars on the folds and the lines between the legs.
</p>
<p>
I’m already a bit thinking whether I’ll need an aesthetic revision as to me, it doesn’t look “proper” or I’m unhappy with the aesthetic
</p>
<p>
How long did you notice that it takes for the swell to go down completely? Is it too soon to think that it’s just going to stay this way? What about the labia minora? If I can see them now, does it mean that they forgot to make them?
</p>
<p>
I went to a very good surgeon in Europe, one of the best actually and known .  I don’t think it’s botched at all, but I feel insecure about the looks still , because it lacks of details IMHO
</p>
<p>
Please somebody give me some reassurance

Pretty good! All seems to be well
</p>
<p>
I like my vulva much more now, it seems to have gone down a lot I still don’t have defined labia minora and bigger labia majora, but that’s okay :)
