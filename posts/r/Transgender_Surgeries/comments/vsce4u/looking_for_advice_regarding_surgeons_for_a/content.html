Looking for advice regarding surgeons for a revision (McGinn, Min Jun, Bowers, Whittenberg, Gurjala, ect...)
</p>
<p>
I had my bottom surgery with Marci Bowers in April and things have been an absolute shit show ever since. I had my labia minora almost entirely die off (most likely due to an allergic reaction,) some pretty gnarly wound separation, a fair amount of necrosis and a ridiculous amount of granulation tissue. Plus my majora is uneven as heck and my clitoris seems to be very lopsided. Things are pretty uncomfortable at the moment because my clitoris is fully exposed with zero hooding.
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t supposed to be a &#34;fuck Bowers&#34; post, but after being told that my revision would be 2 and a half years out because they are booked, I decided that I want to at least consult with other surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Currently I&#39;m looking at Min Jun, McGinn, whittenberg and bluebond but I&#39;m more than open to other suggestions. Preferably someone in California, but I&#39;m open to traveling.
</p>
<p>
Here is where things are at at the moment
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have a consult scheduled with Min Jun in October, and his office has been extremely helpful so far. Huge fan of most of his work that I&#39;ve seen on here but I haven&#39;t seen many revisions by him.
</li>
<li>
I have a consult scheduled with Gurjala at align for October as well, my friend recommended them but I know very ver little about their office.
</li>
<li>
I contacted whittenberg but they won&#39;t even talk to me until 1 year post op.
</li>
<li>
I have a revision surgery scheduled for October 2024 with Bowers and to quote her office, her wait-list might &#34;move it forward to mid/late next year&#34;
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As far as bluebond and McGinn, I haven&#39;t contacted them yet because the trip across the country is a bit intimidating, but I&#39;m open to it if y&#39;all think they are worth the trip.

Don&#39;t know much about Gurjala but I just had a minimal depth vaginoplasty with Dr. Satterwhite who is also at Align and their staff were incredible. The office staff is on top of things and the nurse staff is great also. Highly would recommend Align

Min Jun all the way! Bluebond and Mcginn are a great alternative if you need them!
</p>
<p>
With Mcginn, Iâ€™ve heard her notoriously fixing bitch jobs of Rumer for instance. Min Jun is extremely skilled and artistic!

Hey there, saw this post just now so not sure if you are still looking for advice. But for posterity, i decided to comment anyway :)
</p>
<p>
I did not have srs with Dr Gurjala but I did have a secondary BA with him and I am super happy with the results. His stitch work is amazing!
</p>
<p>
That aside, purely based on my 2 consults with him, a quick meet before the surgery and the post-op followup appointments, he seemed a very calm knowledgeable empathetic person. He listened to all my concerns and answered my questions so that i fully understand the surgery. The day that i was gonna have the procedure, I actually started panicking while discussing implant sizes for my BA. This happened because the sizes he suggested looked way too big (in my eyes) and i kept on telling him that i wanted a natural look. He did a good job at calming me down, explained why he was suggesting that size and assured I would be happy. Fast forward to present day, I couldn&#39;t be any happier and I&#39;m glad Dr Gurjala used the size he used on me.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps!
