As title says, this afternoon I had a consult with Melinda Costa in Los Gatos.  Seems she hasn’t done any FFS cases on her own, but said she has been doing a case every week or two for the past year and a half with Keojampa at Good Samaritan Hospital, which is across the street from her office. She is double trained and board certified in plastics and craniofacial surgery. She was very nice, and spent almost an hour and a half with me and seemed very concerned about details and getting it right. She said she would do things “just like Keojampa does” because that’s who has trained her in FFS.
</p>
<p>
Several takeaways that sound like Keojampa’s process... She said she would work with an engineer to do virtual planning, and would have them come up with “templates” based on CT scans so that everything was planned ahead of time and precise. She said if I decide to move forward, we would sit down at least two more times (and as many times as I want) prior to the pre-op appointment, to make sure we were “fully on the same page.” She said she would use absorbable plates and screws for forehead osteotomy and sliding genioplasty. Said she would use a “skin flap from the scalp” to fill in the male receding temple area. Said that like Keojampa, all scars would be hidden except for hairline scar secondary to hairline advance, eyebrow lift, and brow and orbital rim contouring.  Lip lift scar and rhinoplasty below nose in fold below nose.  Jaw and chin reductions as well as Cheek implant scars inside of mouth.  She also said she would take tissue from the scalp to add fullness to lips. She was very personable, took a good deal of time with me (almost an hour and a half) and seemed to be a perfectionist on one hand, and someone that is nice to be around as well.  Very patient-centric. She did not have any photos of prior FFS work she has done because it seemed all of her work doing FFS has been with Keojampa so far.  She was honest that she is “working to build” her FFS practice. She is double fellowship and board certified on plastics and craniofacial surgery. I’d be surprised if we aren’t going to hear a lot about her in the next few years. She said that if we can get the insurance to approve, then she would foresee maybe being able to do the surgery in January. I’m intrigued.

This is an old post I know but it comes up when searching her. Just finished FFS with her 2 weeks ago and everything went great.

Alright coming back just about 12 weeks post surgery. Everything has healed nicely with no complications and I’m very pleased with her work! She promised me natural and subtle and delivered exactly what she said. If anyone is looking to work with her don’t hesitate to message me with questions, I’ve already gotten a few.

This.
</p>
<p>
Resorbable for forehead and titanium ones for chin are what we use as well.
</p>
<p>
OP, you should double check about that ;) but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she also uses titanium stuff for the chin and it was just a mixup of words.

True, and we didn’t discuss that because I don’t plan to have that procedure done by her if I decide to move forward with her.
