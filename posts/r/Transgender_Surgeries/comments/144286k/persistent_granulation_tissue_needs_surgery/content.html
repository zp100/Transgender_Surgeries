Hi, I had a vaginoplasty 14 months ago and from the month 2 I started bleeding more and having problems that would relate to granulation tissue. At month 6 I even had bit of tissue hanging out to the outside.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon neglected it until 11 months after surgery, making up explanations about my problem that I never read about. Turns out it was granulation tissue all along...
</p>
<p>
But he was unable to fix the granulation tissue I had at the very end of my 12cm depth, so we need to schedule a new suegery with general or regional anesthesia. Is that normal? I&#39;ve always read its treated a bit after it comes up with other means. I dont trus this surgeon anymore.
</p>
<p>
Surgeon was Jesus Lago from Spain.

It was a combination of silver nitrate and a steroid cream applied daily for several weeks helped to resolve mine.

Doesn&#39;t that kind of cream have a risk of growing hairs inside?

Not to my knowledge, but I can&#39;t confirm. It was Betnovate that I was prescribed by my GRS surgeon. I applied some internally each night just before bed.

Yes what the other l commenter said. You need to apply Clobetasol steroid cream deep into your vaginal canal once a day for about 3 months for this to resolve. What you&#39;re experiencing is very normal.
