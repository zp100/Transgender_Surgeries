So what do you think? This is a computer image of what I may look like post surgery. I feel like it‚Äôs not nearly aggressive enough but maybe that‚Äôs just my dysphoria?

The front profile isn&#39;t super Great for seeing the results of FFS in general, a lot of the changed features are really subtle in that angle.
</p>
<p>
However, you can definitely see an effect - for example, here&#39;s the image with
<em>
just
</em>
the jaw and chin:
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/Hr0pzCx">https://imgur.com/a/Hr0pzCx
</a>
- those two jaws are
<strong>
very
</strong>
clearly male vs female. If your FFS comes out like this image, you&#39;re gonna look great.
</p>
<p>
(as an aside, I love your hair omg!)

Thanks, I came out at work on a Friday, then dyed my hair the next day. I‚Äôve always wanted to. I definitely don‚Äôt usually tuck it behind my ears tho! That was for the picture ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

I think you should do what feels right in your heart, but I think that the picture on the right is very feminine

Neat! I went to Rolfes earlier this year and he wasn&#39;t doing this computer imaging at the time, so that&#39;s cool to see.

Yeah, there&#39;s no question that your jaw and chin are very femme in the second photo. I&#39;m not sure I can see much difference with the forehead, but often the difference from that is most evident in the profile.

I think jaw, chin, cheeks, lips, and hairline all look great on the after pic. I‚Äôm guessing if the eyebrows were groomed
<em>
slightly
</em>
more aggressively in the right pic the eyes would probably pop a fair amount more too. If I‚Äôd think any area to
<em>
maybe
</em>
be a little more aggressive, it might be fine tuning the nose a bit.  But that might just be me projecting because my own nose irks me the most üòÇ üëÉ

I definitely see a big difference, but I think I see what you mean. Have you considered shortening your upper lip a bit? That can be quite feminizing.

In all honesty, the results look pretty good, you look cute. I do think though consulting with a professional make-up artist after you‚Äôre all healed might help you achieve your ideal look. There are tricks you can do with highlighting, contouring to achieve a smaller forehead, softer jaw line, rounder cheeks, brighter eyes and a thinner nose if you think you may need it. You can also experiment with different hair styles to frame your face to make it appear more feminine. Regardless, you are beautiful, you look young and healthy, so you will probably heal well and quickly. The most important thing is that you trust the doctor who is doing your surgery.

There&#39;s a pretty big difference. The right picture looks completely female.

Looks like a girl to me  ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Of course, a lot more goes into it than just looks. Idk how they sound. If they sound female, though, I can‚Äôt see why anyone would think otherwise.
