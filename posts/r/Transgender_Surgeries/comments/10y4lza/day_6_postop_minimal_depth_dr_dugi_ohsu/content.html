Hello,
</p>
<p>
On Friday, February 3rd I had a minimal-depth vulvoplasty with Dr. Dugi at OHSU in Portland, Oregon. The reason I chose minimal depth is because I don&#39;t want to dilate, I don&#39;t have interest in vaginal penetrative sex, and I wanted to go a bit easier on my body. I have about 2-3cm of depth.
</p>
<p>
I have been journaling my experience for the past 6 days and can post some of that if people want it. In short, I&#39;ve been having some extreme ups and downs. Some times of day I have a positive self-talk that lets me know I can make it through this and end up on the other side happier than I was before. But without fail, every morning, I feel regret. I feel the wish to turn back the clock and live with my previous anatomy to avoid all the pain and suffering I am going through right now and will go through for months.
</p>
<p>
The results do not look that bad; my labial definition is very good and my only complaint is the size of my clitoral hood which basically just looks like the bottom of my prior parts cut off at the halfway point.
</p>
<p>
However, my swelling seems to not be going down very much at all. On day 3 when I was supposed to go home I had a severe panic attack at my lack of ability to urinate (after having the catheter removed) wherein I thrashed and screamed and cried out my regrets and my desire to end my life because of it. I had the catheter reinserted and went home with it the next day, it is scheduled to be removed on Friday.
</p>
<p>
Is what I&#39;m feeling normal? I&#39;m so hopeless at times, including now which is why I made this account to post. I really don&#39;t know if I made the right decision. I understand it&#39;s still extremely early. My hopes are riding on reaching that 8 week point and being much more happy with what I&#39;ve done.
</p>
<p>
My very long-term boyfriend is supportive of me and I know this surgery won&#39;t affect our sex life, but my mental health is in the trash regardless.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been consuming so much GCS content both here and on YouTube and I have a feeling it isn&#39;t doing me any favors either. Has anyone had a similar experience or can help me to get a better idea of the future?

Hi there!
</p>
<p>
First off, I’m so sorry you’re feeling regret and so much pain.
</p>
<p>
Would love to hear about your experience! I had surgery with Dr. Dugi full depth vaginoplasty on the 30th of December. I have been waiting to hit 2 months post op to make a write up of my experience so far.
</p>
<p>
The first month is difficult but more so the first two weeks were the hardest to cope with.
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry mornings are hard and that you regret it. I would definitely talk to someone about it, even reach out to ohsu to see if they have a therapist that could talk you through what you’re experiencing.
</p>
<p>
I had surgery scheduled originally in October, but last minute I had a panic attack and lots of anxiety and morning of called and told them I couldn’t do it. I regretted that and talked with them and they rescheduled me for December. It’s a long story. OHSU has great resources and psychologists that can do talk therapy and help you cope. I’d definitely recommend that, but of course that’s up to you.
</p>
<p>
It is a lot of pain at first, but it gets more tolerable over time. I’m only 6 weeks post op, but it will get better, each day will become easier and you’ll feel more like yourself again and the pain will be easier to manage.
</p>
<p>
Ups and downs are completely normal too! It’ll be that way as all the hard medication and anesthesia wears off completely. Also having to take it easy and not be as active as you once were can exacerbate that too at times.
</p>
<p>
Positive self talk is soo important! It’s great you have a supportive boyfriend. Talking to someone helps a whole lot and venting your feelings will help too.
</p>
<p>
It is still early and swelling will gradually keep going down over the next few months. If you notice more swelling or pain use Ice pack wrapped in a thin towel to help.
</p>
<p>
It’s absolutely normal. You just had surgery and it’s not uncommon to feel these feelings. I’m sorry you had that experience with your peeing and went home with a catheter. Hopefully Friday goes well. ✨
</p>
<p>
I think in 8 weeks you’ll feel like a different you than you do now. Surgery is very taxing on all parts of the body, mind and soul. The journey really begins once surgery is over and you’re recovering.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I hope this all made sense and helped a little. I wasn’t sure what to say, but I felt compelled to say something. Please reach out if you need support or have questions.
</p>
<p>
Healing vibes coming your way!
</p>
