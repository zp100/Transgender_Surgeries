I didn&#39;t have to pay anything for the consults with Dr. Theerapong, but BCS clinic wanted me to have my psychologists letters when I had the consult. Interplast didn&#39;t require the letters for the consult, but both required two letters to set a date (I think the rules on this are different for foreigners - you may have to ask the clinic). I was going to get them in my home town in Thailand but the hospital is small and the psychiatry division didn&#39;t have any appointments open for a long time. The clinic and some Facebook surgery groups suggested going to see psychologists at the Praram 9 hospital , so I figured that&#39;d be easiest since I was already going to Bangkok for the consultation. When I called they said I didn&#39;t need an appointment, I could just walk-in.
</p>
<p>
I had a hard time finding the entrance to the hospital, but it was pretty quick to register and the wait wasn&#39;t very long at all. The waiting room was really nice -

</a>
). I saw two psychologists that morning, a man and a woman. They were both very nice, asked basic questions like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How long I have felt this way?
</li>
<li>
When did I first knew I liked boys (kind of old-fashioned, I told her I&#39;m bi and that wasn&#39;t an issue at all)
</li>
<li>
Am I am out to my parents, how do they feel about it?
</li>
<li>
How long I have dressed as a woman and do I do it full time?
</li>
<li>
How long have I been on hormones and how do I like it?
</li>
<li>
Do I have any psychological diseases?
</li>
<li>
Do I understand that surgery will render me sterile and is irreversible?
</li>
<li>
Am I scared or worried about surgery?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was surprised that they didn&#39;t ask for any proof that I have been living full time and taking hormones for 12 months. Just asked me and that was it. Same for psychological disorders - they asked if I had any and since I don’t, that was it. They both were very polite. It took less than an hour, after that I waited for a little bit, paid at the cashier, went back to the mind center with the receipt and was given the two letters. We talked in Thai, but the certificates were in English.
</p>
<p>
Hope this is helpful for some of you! On this account I also have posts about my consultations with Dr. Kamol and Dr. Theerapong, and will be posting more about surgery and recovery as I get the chance.

A few questions
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do you know if the psychs speak English?
</li>
<li>
What was the cost?
</li>
<li>
How long from booking did it take?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is obviously different for foreigners, but I have the impression there&#39;s of medical gatekeeping and backwards attitudes in Thailand for local people. Any opinion on that?

I would guess that they speak ok English, certainly enough to provide English speakers with letters. I hear foreigners can go there too. Their written English was normal educated Thai English - understandable but with little mistakes.
</li>
<li>
Cost was 1,500 THB per letter, and I think there was a small fee too. Maybe ฿100?
</li>
<li>
I just walked in without an appointment, took a little over two hours until I left with the letters. They do accept appointments in advance too, just call them or message them on Facebook (can chat with them on their website). The mind center is open 8:00-19:00 Monday-Saturday, 8:00-16:00 on Sunday.

Can&#39;t really gate keep HRT in Thailand, you can just by it from any big pharmacy or from other trans women online. Bigger problem is people not having good information and taking a lot of birth control or herbal supplements or stopping to give your liver a break and stuff. Everyone worries about what it&#39;ll do to your liver but few people talk to doctors to get good information or testing. Some people in the trans community share good information like Garfield, a pharmacist who is contestant #31 for Miss Tiffany this year. There&#39;s also a big facebook group for Thai girls to ask about using hormones correctly and a bunch of LBGT clinics that do blood tests and HIV tests and stuff. It&#39;s getting better.
</p>

Like a decade ago newspapers made this panic about teenagers getting testicles removed and so they cracked down on it. Now surgery requirements are the same as most countries - have to be 18 with parent&#39;s permission (or 20 without or if an orphan) one year as a woman, one year of hormones, two certificates. Not that hard to do, hard part is paying for it.
</p>
<p>
The letters were a big waste of money, all it was is them asking if I&#39;m trans and I&#39;m sure I want surgery and I say yes. It probably mattered that I dressed nice for the interview - I think one of them mentioned that I dressed as a woman in their certificate. I guess it&#39;s backwards that everyone assumes trans women are straight, but I was open about being bi and still got letters. Just a dumb rule, but easy to pass. I guess that is gate keeping.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sad that I&#39;m seen as a separate sex instead of just a woman. I can&#39;t get married, can&#39;t change my ID card to say Miss. When people don&#39;t realize I am trans I am treated much better, but I can&#39;t pass all the time and my ID will always be wrong. Just because Thai people are nice doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not lots of discrimination. Have to fight for our rights here. But here is safer than many places.
