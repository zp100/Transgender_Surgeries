Dr. Slama/Dr. Oates. Boston, Ma. June 14th, 2022
</p>
<p>
Aesthetics are indescribably good to me. Love everything about the look and feel of everything. Dilation just over 6‚Äù. Did not have orchie prior due to some research I was presented with that discussed amounts of skin, expected results with or with out, as well as the atrophy of skin caused by orchie‚Äôs.
</p>
<p>
surgery: PI (felt as though best for me)  Dilator: 3 (not bottoming out yet, but dilation is painless)  Pain: at its worst, 2/10
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: people are asking how long my procedure took. My surgery was 6 hours.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm really, really glad that it wasn‚Äôt the two hour PI you often hear about. My self collected nerd data saw a lot of complications (specifically dehiss and necrosis) with speedy surgeries.
</p>
<p>
I asked a surgeon actually how much time was spent stitching during surgery. He informed me that adequate, tight, aesthetic stitching took time. 30 minutes, up to 45 minutes. Imagine a surgeon spending this much time stitching and having a little over an hour to dissemble and then reassemble your entire genitalia. No thanks.

That‚Äôs absolutely incredible! Congratulations on the amazing surgery result and I hope your healing etc. continues to go so smoothly!
</p>
<p>
Also thank you for the info on potential issues with orchie. Do you happen to remember where you were reading about that? It‚Äôs a major concern of mine because I always figured I‚Äôd get orchie first, but I‚Äôm not so sure now.

I‚Äôll see if I can find it!
</p>
<p>
Also. The research is mixed. Sone surgeons I‚Äôve talked to previously said it didn‚Äôt matter. Some did. Some say it depends on the amount of time inbetween the two surgeries, etc

After researching colon, PPT, PI - and based on my anatomy and amount of skin - I opted for PI.
</p>
<p>
I also tracked complications between the surgeries - and in my experience (which was limited to forums like this) I tracked a smaller overall percentage of complication to PI (this is just me. I‚Äôm a data nerd. I haven‚Äôt found any research to back this up in journals)
</p>
<p>
I also did not observe a dramatic difference in aesthetics, tbh. I know Heidi is a Goddess here - and it‚Äôs well deserved, but every surgeon has had bad results and she‚Äôs no excluded from that.
</p>
<p>
So, all in all, I chose Dr. Slama due to numerous reasons.

I could not agree more.
</p>
<p>
I think, in part, we trans women are always chasing ‚Äúthe latest and greatest‚Äù because we somehow think it will make us more valid, more ‚Äúcis‚Äù, or whatever. Most of us have had the thought that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait until the surgery gets better‚Äù. I know I‚Äôve said this to myself.
</p>
<p>
Then Dr. Jess Ting (who is awesome) pioneers a new surgery with the help of a patient.
</p>
<p>
There also seems to be a lot of misinformation with PPT, for instance. Average depth with PPT is literally around 4.5-5‚Äù. Not this ‚ÄúI can bottom all the dilators‚Äù depth you hear about. That‚Äôs rare.
</p>
<p>
In fact, I‚Äôd you take a look here - it‚Äôs pretty common to not have over 5‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
All in all though, I fo not regret having the procedure people snub their nose at. I have feeling everywhere - and more every day. I have beautiful aesthetics (imo), easier dilation than I ever imagined, and zero wound separation with 0 infections. I‚Äôve been driving and going out to dinner, or running errands, for like the past week.
</p>
<p>
Life feels way too normal at 23 days post. I‚Äôll take it.

Keep it up. I know recovery is tough but so worth it.
</p>
<p>
I mean, you get to look down and have a perfect vagina, and it only gets better from here.
</p>
<p>
Side note:  Your Doctor did amazing work. Most doctors make the labia a bit too thin, but they got it just right.

I had this same thought about my labia. I could not be happier
</p>
<p>
And honestly, my recovery has been stupid easy. Lots of protein, clean foods, multi vitamins. Ice packs, nightly douching, hot wash cloths and damp q tips to clean around my minora fo help fend off bacterial infections.

Because I opted to keep my nuts (LOL) prior to surgery, there was an excess of skin that allowed for a slightly thicker construction of the majora - which is 100% what I wanted.

Amazing amazing result. At 22 days it almost looks like the final product. Is it okay if I PM you in the future? I am not looking at any surgeries ATM (I&#39;m not even on hrt yet), but I&#39;m also a research nerd and would love to get info later on.
</p>
<p>
Btw how much was it if I may ask?
