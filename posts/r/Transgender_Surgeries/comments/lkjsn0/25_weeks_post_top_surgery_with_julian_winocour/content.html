I&#39;m an extreme weight loss patient having had weight loss surgery 2 years ago and losing 230 pounds.
</p>
<p>
Took some pics this morning after my shower at 2.5 weeks out. Started somewhere around a 40 A/B (wore a 40D with excess skin that was removed), not yet sized, but in think I&#39;ll be in a DD when they&#39;ve finished settling. 440cc Mentor Silicone Moderate Plus Extra unders. Avulsion arm lift (liposuctioned the excess fat, then removed skin), lipo to my sides and a revision of my FDL abdominoplasty from 6 months ago.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon for everything has been Julian Winocour with Vanderbilt Plastics.
