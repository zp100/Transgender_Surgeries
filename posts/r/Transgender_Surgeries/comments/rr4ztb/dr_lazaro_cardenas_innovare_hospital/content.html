It may seem too cheap for you, but trust me that here in México thats A LOT of money. I&#39;m also considering Cárdenas for ffs in the future since I liked the results I&#39;ve seen around here :p

I am 9 weeks post op from there.  FFS (basically everything except a rhinoplasty, but including a face lift) and BA all at once.
</p>
<p>
Very, very pleased with everything about it.  Results are great (or as great as they can be considering how masculine my face was beforehand), scars are very, very minimal, already.
</p>
<p>
Service while there was great, everything was really good, including the service at the recovery apartment.
</p>
<p>
Two minor complaints: they were somewhat stingy with the pain meds once released from the hospital.  mostly just NSAIDs.
</p>
<p>
And if you pay there via credit card (which I did), they break it up into smaller payments.  So, my balance of $25k USD was broken into 6 payments of $4k USD.  This, of course, triggered the fraud detection on my credit card (even though I told my bank about it beforehand), and since they did the charges the evening before the surgery, the fraud department was of course closed, and no one was able to unlock my credit card. So I had to sort through my other cards and use them, one by one, for each charge.  I would recommend paying ahead of time via wire transfer if possible.

I&#39;m told, from other trans women that have been there, that pain meds are VERY easy to get on the black market there. I didn&#39;t go that route, because I&#39;m actually a US gov&#39;t employee, and get drug tested on a regular basis.
</p>
<p>
The costs were exactly what is reflected on the site, they are very upfront about it.  Here is a total breakdown for me (and the costs listed for me are in US dollars)
</p>
<p>
Forehead Bone Remodeling - Includes Hairline Advancement and/or  Eyebrow Lift   $5,490.00
</p>
<p>
Upper Lip Lift  $1,490.00
</p>
<p>
Fat infiltration to the lips    $1,200.00
</p>
<p>
Chin Contouring - Bone shaving method   $2,750.00
</p>
<p>
Jaw Contouring - Bone shaving method    $2,750.00
</p>
<p>
Trachea Shave   $1,550.00
</p>
<p>
Special Combo: Major Facelift with Upper &amp; Lower Eyelid Lift    $5,550.00
</p>
<p>
Anatomically-Shaped Cohesive Silicone Gel Implants up to 590 cc $5,100.00
</p>
<p>
Pre-Op Testing (*): Standard Pre-Op Testing $190.00
</p>
<p>
Service &amp; Accommodations: 11 night local services package &amp; private apartment   $1,155.00
</p>
<p>
Total was $27,225 USD. Had to pay $2k upfront to reserve the spot, and the balance on the night prior to surgery.

They will arrange a zoom call with you and Dr Cardenas, and look at your pics, as well, and give you his recommendations on what would be the best (in his opinion) for you.  Just make sure you tell him exactly what results you are looking for.
</p>
<p>
Also, getting both a rhinoplasty, and chin and jaw work at the same time is going to be a rough recovery. You won&#39;t be able to breath through your nose due to the rhinoplasty while it heals, at least until they take out the insert they put in there, and you will only be able to open your mouth a little bit due to the chin and jaw work (he does in through the inside of your mouth on the gumline), so it will be rough. I mean, plenty of trans women have done the same thing, it&#39;s just not pleasant.

I wouldn’t travel through an airport with unprescribed opiates. You’d be in big trouble if you got caught.

I can&#39;t speak to FFS because I only had body contouring from him, but I&#39;m seeing his name come up a lot lately and I like to chime in with advice for people who aren&#39;t native.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
One commenter mentioned buying opiates on the black market. Do not buy drugs in Mexico. Aside from all the problems that could happen with the transaction itself, you don&#39;t want to risk ANY involvement with the police, trust me.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Inside the OR, everything is exactly the same as anywhere else. Before that though, the medical culture is different regarding sterility. Dont be afraid to insist that people wear gloves.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Paying Transop for daily meals will make your life so much easier, and if you talk to the restaurant they&#39;ll give you their regular menu with all the good shit.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Don&#39;t forget to only drink bottled water.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Dr. Cardenas is a very, very good surgeon, and he has a great staff that will take good care of you. Best of luck with everything 💛

That was me that mentioned it. I don&#39;t have any direct experience with that, just heard from other trans women that it was easy.  I don&#39;t recommend it, though, for the reasons you said.

He&#39;s pretty good ngl. Great work, great staff, and reliable. Ymmv but he&#39;s worth the try if budget is a problem. Him and Rossi in Argentina. I find Mexico is easier to go with due to cost of living and their apartments (part of the charge) are nice and clean.

Fellow UK trans-girl here and I can tell you that Cardenas it’s really good. Also, for approx £30k is DiMaggio and he’s probably the best of the lot.

I recognise Rossi, just not the surgery LOL. I heard his standards had slipped (although that was a couple of years ago so he may have recovered). What will be the deciding factor in your choice of surgeon?
</p>
<p>
Also, I am struggling to find a surgeon that can perform breast augmentation and make it look natural - Too many seem on natural hi, I’m naturally round and I’m naturally far apart – have you any surgeon recommendations?

Have you had your online consultations with them? Have they seen your photos and do you think they’ve given you realistic expectations?
</p>
<p>
The only thing that puts me off either is that they don’t offer any kind of 3-D modelling of your likely results and that’s a pretty big deal when it’s your face that’s going under the knife.

You may well be right, I’m just uneasy about not being able to visually show what I hoped to achieve (or what they say I would like to achieve) and so much can be lost in translation when is relying on words. Obviously 3-D modelling would remove that risk of misunderstanding as you would be able to get them to tweak the image to convey what you’d like to achieve.
</p>
<p>
That said, I had a consultation with Cardenas 2 years ago and found him to be very Pleasant, charming and with excellent English. I’m sure that you, like me, have seen of the amazingly beautiful Mexican trans-women on Instagram and he probably does a lot of them.
</p>
<p>
Would you please keep me informed of your journey/decisions?

Oh?  How so?  Because otherwise, without saying why, you seem to come off like a shill.

The mere fact that Dr. Guerrero uses virtual surgical planning, 3D printing, and CT scans for planning anything before executing should be enough.
</p>

Cardenas doesn&#39;t do any of that. And it&#39;s necessary when it comes to craniofacial surgery.

My transma did her FFS and BA with him and generally she was extremely pleased with her results. I think she looks fantastic - he is obviously a good surgeon from what I can see and from her own stories about her experiences there. TBH, the recovery villa sounds pretty magical, especially for the amount of money.

I had forehead type 3 surgery with Cardenas and ended up very dissatisfied. He did not setback my sinus far enough and still looks masculine. Just do your research and ask for before and after pics. Be wary of positioning/ lighting and makeup and stuff.

That&#39;s weird. Maybe because some patients were dissatisfied with their work. Ive never heard of other girls regretting getting FFS
