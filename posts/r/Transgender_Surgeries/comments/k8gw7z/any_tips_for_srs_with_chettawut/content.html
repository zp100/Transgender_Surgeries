I had SRS with him 3 years ago. I recovered well and quickly. My results are good. Food Panada (Uber eats equivalent) is a life savor. So get a phone SIM at the airport. Depending on where you stay, breakfast can be rough. Bring a laptop/tablet for entertainment. You will be bed ridden for at least two weeks so be patient. The nurses are amazing. Speak to them about any issues. Hmmm. I know I missed something, but if you have questions. Ask them. I’ll answer as best as I can.

glad to hear that.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m kinda scared of losing weight with the diet you need pre op. What could you eat basically for the bowel cleansing stuff
</p>
<p>
thank you so much for your answer already !

Uhh. If I remember correctly it’s 2 or 3 days before surgery, and about 3-4 days post-op. They have you on soups and chowder. Tons of soy milk and water. Funny, I love soy milk now because of my SRS trip.

I’m going to be Truthful. I have hair at the entrance of my vagina near my perineum.  I followed his instructions and did not get hair removal. It’s may be 1 or two follicles but they are there. Chett will give you all the dilators and a mirror. The nurses will teach how to properly dilate. Be ready... it’s quite an unusual sensation.
</p>
<p>
Forgot to add. I dilated three times a day for a year. After that I only dilate once a week. I’ve been doing it weekly ever since.

Get someone to buy you fresh water. The one at the Dusit Princess doesnt taste drinkable at all. Try to move as little as possible after surgery. Expect constipation after waking up. It can even be painful. Tramadol, the pain medication given after surgery is likely to cause heavy vomiting in some. Prepare for this if you know that your body reacts to certain pain medications badly. Get books and games and so on. Try watching the Labyrinth with Bowie in the room after surgery. You will be heavily sedated and that movie on netflix Thailand will be easy to process and help you sleep. Check out on time after your stay in the hotel. They can be pretty pedantic if you are late. Nobody wants to pay extra. Bromelain helps with swelling. Sutures are likely to rip prematurely. Its a known side effect of Chetts technique. It will heal.

Bowel cleansing is uncomfortable but easy to manage. Swiff solution should be downed with cola. It helps somewhat. Stay on the toilet for the next hours. Diet restriction was no real problem for me. You will enjoy the hot cocoa and soup after surgery though.
