I’m a few months postop peritoneal pull through. I have a few hairs deep in the canal probably 2” inside, right before the peritoneal tissue. I did laser and electrolysis before my surgery, so please, I don’t need the comment that I should have done it before surgery. I spent two years pre op doing my hair treatments. I’m still confused how any even got there in the first place.

Have you tried electrolysis? You should be able to reach at least one inch inside, maybe two.

It’s quite difficult to remove it fully pre-op. It’s needs to be kept fully clear for a year, and there’s one report of new hair growing due to a surge in testosterone levels post op. Laser seems quite questionable as there’s plenty of reports of facial hair regrowing, sometimes much later. Doesn’t really matter in the face of course.
