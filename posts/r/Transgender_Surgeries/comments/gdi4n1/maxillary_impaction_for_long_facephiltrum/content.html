Hi, everyone! So, I&#39;ve been doing loads of research on facial feminization surgery and was wondering if anyone has experience with maxillary impaction, a procedure not ordinarily used for FFS. It&#39;s normally an orthodontal procedure that shortens the middle of the face at the philtrum (the space between the bottom of the nose and the upper lip). I have a longish face thanks to a very long philtrum and my research tells me the lip lift to be the most common solution for this. However, one of the setbacks to this surgery is what&#39;s called a gummy smile, which I already kinda have. It may also make the upper lip look larger than necessary.
<a href="https://youtu.be/ZPUCPDIjdyw">It seems maxillary impaction resolves this
</a>
. It also seems like it might even be covered by insurance, so bonus there. I haven&#39;t heard of any trans women who&#39;ve had experience with it, though.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Thoughts? Has anyone else heard about this? I have a consultation with Dr. Simon at Facial Team in 4 days and so I&#39;ll be checking with them. Although they don&#39;t offer this procedure, FFS surgeons are required to have maxillofacial training so I hope they&#39;ll have some great insight on it.

Hello, Lilia of FACIALTEAM here. How did it go with your consultation?
</p>
<p>
I assume Dr. Simon did mention that the team are all Oral &amp; Maxillofacial surgeons, some with more specific specialites. These are indeed the specialists who would perform such things such as &#34;bimaxillary osteotomies&#34;, what is probaly what you are referring to, also known as Le Fort surgeries-- which fall under the Orthognathic surgery umbrella to correct things like gummy smile, dental occlusion (under/overbite) and are usually performed in collaboration with an orthodontist, who takes care of braces/brackets if necessary to stabilize the teeth.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://facialteam.eu/galeria/img/casos/alessandra-3-4.jpg">Here is a case on our website
</a>
, Alessandra, who had 1st orthognathic surgery to correct the position/height/width of her facial bones, and thereafter the remaining FFS in a second phase quite some years ago.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps!

There is no requirement that FFS surgeons have any special training to perform FFS.
</p>
<p>
I believe the procedure you&#39;re thinking of  is called a Lefort 1 osteotomy. If so, forget about it. It&#39;s not generally offered unless you have a specific deformity that warrants it. It requires a lot of orthodontic work before and after and the effect is probably not nearly as dramatic as you&#39;d like it to be considering the pain and difficulty involved.
</p>
<p>
A lip lift is a more safer, easier and cheaper procedure to reduce the length of the midface.

Yeah, the only place I&#39;m seeing it offered now is with Deschamps-Braly which is certainly out of my price range. I figured there&#39;d probably be a catch, otherwise I&#39;d see more people doing it. Lip lift it is! :)

I have a slightly longer philtrum, still within cis passing range but it bothers me still. I also have a gummy smile but I talked to Keojampa for a consult and he said that the lip lift wouldnâ€™t change the gummy smile or make it worse because it only affects how much of the upper lip is shown resting and the smile should relatively be the same, I would just have to get botox in the lip after to stop the muscle from raising too much

Oh really? That puts me at ease a little. I never thought I&#39;d be one to want botox but for this it makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much!

I didn&#39;t realize that was the source of some of the facial lines we get. I&#39;m 32 so I&#39;ve got a few more years there. Unfortunately I have a bit of a small nose, which in a lot of ways is nice so I can&#39;t complain.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll probably have FFS in about a year and I absolutely will post it! :D
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Also, I poked into your profile a little and really like the term gender abolitionist. I agree with your view. I think the huge spectrum of gender labels has been helpful to wean our culture away from diametric system of genders, but ultimately their purpose will run their course. Eventually people won&#39;t really think about it. They&#39;ll just like what they like and be what they, uh, be.

Oh gosh, I didn&#39;t realize. I hadn&#39;t considered it may be invalidating to some people. To me it&#39;s freeing idea that promotes diversity, but I&#39;ll be more careful about ruffling feathers and not bring it up again here or in

Are they though? Some people didn&#39;t have the best dental treatment prior to transition and never addressed some dentofacial deformities in their childhood and in turn now these dentofacial deformities hinder their ability to pass. I&#39;m not saying this is OPs case particularily but I and a few other people I know are in this particular situation.  Plus as long as OP finds a reputable and experienced  oral and maxillofacial surgeon they should be fine.

I figure it doesn&#39;t hurt to ask around. The more knowledge the better. Plus I&#39;m pretty sure a lot of stuff we go through to achieve the femininity we want is considered insane by others. I&#39;ve had a bilateral orchiectomy and I am sure most of the population on earth thinks it&#39;s absolutely bonkers to go through that.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I really appreciate your input though. It helps to get the full spectrum of replies. Thanks!
