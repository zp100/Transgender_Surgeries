I went with Dr.Lago in Madrid. Worst decision I‚Äôve ever made. It‚Äôs been 3 months and my mental health is in the gutter. I opted for the colon method (regret choosing that method), he punctured my colon then misdiagnosed me which led me to have an emergency laparotomy performed by another surgeon. The anatomy of my vulva is also incorrect and he made the scars huge and placed them in the wrong position. The administration is also trash, they haven‚Äôt checked in on me once.

The only advice I can give you is that try to not be sad about it , because being sad will actually not change anything, I also regret my surgeon choice mainly because of the bad scars and leftover erect tissues, but I will get revision to fix those problems and hopefully everything will turn out okay.

Haha that&#39;s wild. I just took the earliest date that was offered to me and ended up with Dr. Laungani. I did go for full depth, and am realizing just how much of a full time job dilation schedules are haha.

PI with Dr. Ting at Mt. Sinai, no regrets at all. navigating their system is a huge pain in the ass but the actual medical care i‚Äôve received has been top notch, and my results are exactly what i‚Äôd hoped for. if i had to pick someone else, i might go with Dr. Avanessian at Sinai, or RBL and Zhao at NYU

tbh i went down to 2x per day at 8 months and gave up on orange, and it‚Äôs been great, especially since i switched to a more acidic lube. i‚Äôm not a size queen, and i‚Äôm a dyke top, so i don‚Äôt need the girth

i did use clobetasol! i did 2 rounds of it for some granulation tissue near my clit and in my canal in january through march. it worked pretty well. i also did some silver nitrate on top of it.
</p>
<p>
i switched to Sliquid H2O recently. i‚Äôd been using Slippery Stuff and having discharge/bleeding issues, and i didn‚Äôt connect the dots until i changed up lubes. i think the Slippery Stuff‚Äôs thickness plus neutral pH was creating a really good environment for bacterial overgrowth that was inhibiting healing and causing discharge. Sliquid‚Äôs been much better

Did you have any problems trying to stop using the clobetasol, I‚Äôm at 10 months next week and despite trying to stop using I find that I‚Äôm pretty reliant on it for comfortable dilation

absolutely yes. i got a lot tighter after i stopped the clobetasol. that‚Äôs when i gave up on orange, because i just never got it comfortably in, let alone to depth. dilation became more painful and i bled more. it‚Äôs really only in the last few weeks (so like 2-3 months since clobetasol, 9.5 months post-op) that i‚Äôve gotten comfy again

nothing to apologize for! i‚Äôm happy to answer questions. i didn‚Äôt really titrate in a formal sense, but maybe i should‚Äôve. i just ran out of clobetasol and had a couple days of using the last dregs i could squeeze out of the tube, in much smaller quantities than my usual dose. honestly the way dilating almost immediately became more difficult and painful had me upset for weeks

Dr. Ashley DeLeon @ Crane Center, Austin, TX. USA.  I am very happy. I went with PI vaginoplasy and everything came out great, but almost went with peritoneal flap vaginoplasty. It‚Äôs not used as much yet so I was nervous.

Dr. Laungani at GRS Montreal. I&#39;m dealing with plenty of hypergranulation and discomfort right now at 3 months and I&#39;m struggling to heal some of it, but none of that seems related to Dr Laungani himself so I have no real regrets about my choice. Anything that&#39;s a little off for me right now just seems to be the result of how my body is healing, and if I do need any fixes down the road I&#39;m happy to go back to Montreal.

Every person I&#39;ve spoken to had some hypergranulation, seems pretty much inevitable. Glad your surgery went well, I&#39;m seeing Dr. Laungani in Sept so seeing comments like this helps ease my nerves a bit lol.

Dr. Ashley Deleon (a woman) for minimal depth. Its not perfect, but the situation I‚Äôm in she was the only option. I think her results are average. Some of it is on me as well. I didn‚Äôt take it easy early on as much as I should have.

Dr. Avanessian at Mt. Sinai. Minimal depth vaginoplasty via penile inversion 17 months ago, breast augmentation 5 months ago. Her surgical coordinator (Karen) and her medical assistant (Jim) are both wonderful. Her insurance coordinator, not so much.
</p>
<p>
The following is my personal experience there - your experience may differ. Some of the info will apply no matter which surgeon you go with.
</p>
<p>
Before you get your consultation with the surgeon, there are hoops you have to jump through, and each will tell you &#34;we&#39;ll get back to you in 3-4 weeks&#34;. They won&#39;t - you have to call them and bug them for the next step each time.
</p>
<p>
As I recall, the first consult was with their social worker (to make sure you have the necessary post-discharge support system in place - you&#39;re going to be in bed for at least two weeks, except for going to the bathroom, you&#39;ll need someone to empty your catheter bag, feed you, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Next was a visit with their psychiatrist - this does NOT count as one of the letters you will need. It is just a screening process.
</p>
<p>
Then I had the most lackadaisical physical exam ever.
</p>
<p>
At that point, you make an appointment to meet with the surgeon. That will likely be a long wait. You should have letters from two psychiatrists documenting your persistent gender dysphoria, that you have evaluated all the options and concerns (including future infertility) and that surgery is your best option. You&#39;ll need a letter from your endocrinologist saying how long you&#39;ve been on HRT, that there are no complicating factors with your blood work, etc. Lastly, you&#39;ll need a letter from your primary care provider saying you&#39;re in generally good health (listing any exceptions), the medications they prescribe for you, and that you&#39;re a good patient (complies with instructions, takes medications regularly as prescribed, etc.)
</p>
<p>
Once you have your consult with the surgeon, Karen will get back to you with a tentative surgical date. Ask to be offered an earlier date if there is a cancellation (if you&#39;re traveling for this surgery, you&#39;ll need a place to stay for several weeks after the surgery for follow-ups, so that may impact your ability to change your schedule - plane reservations, hotel/AirBnB reservations, time off from work, etc.).
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll be given appointments for a more complete physical, blood work, etc. closer to your surgical date. You may need updated letters (the first set was mostly to justify the surgery to your insurance so they will cover it) for your actual surgery.
</p>
<p>
I had the surgery in the morning and was discharged from the hospital 4 days later, with a wound-vac attached. My followup was a little over a week later to remove the wound-vac and packing, and to see my vagina for the first time. Don&#39;t panic - blood and bruising is normal. There will be additional follow-up visits, becoming further apart over time.
</p>
<p>
My insurance covered everything except my inpatient deductible and the co-pay on my discharge prescriptions. It also covered a visiting nurse, who started out once a day and taped off to once a week as my healing progressed.
</p>
<p>
If you have trouble finding psychiatrists to write letters for you, search for &#34;GALAP&#34;.

Thanks for the write up! I&#39;m just starting down the process for Mt Sinai (looking at Purohit...also considering Avanessian). Was also planning on using a visiting nurse, so wanted to ask...are they okay with you just saying you&#39;re planning on relying on a visiting nurse as your caregiver? (Their website implies that you need friends or family in that position...I&#39;ve got a support group around, but asking someone to live with me for the duration is just too much to ask.) And does the visiting nurse ever have to be overnight, or is day sufficient?

They come for an hour or so each day, to check the dressing, make sure the catheter is draining, the wound-vac is operating, and take your vitals.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll need someone to empty your urine collection bag until the first followup when the catheter comes out, to help you to the bathroom (for [not so] solid waste), and to bring you food and water.

There are services where you can hire someone to stay with you, often (maybe always?) another trans woman. Some I think have sliding scales for payment. When you first get home your job is to move as little as possible - basically only to and from the bathroom. You won&#39;t be able to bend over or lift anything more than 5 pounds. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll let you, but even if they did it&#39;s not a great idea to be by yourself for the first few weeks.

Thanks! I&#39;m fortunate to be able to afford hiring someone if insurance won&#39;t cover it, just need to make sure it&#39;s allowed. The visiting nurse service of NY has nurses trained in transgender care which seemed like a good option.

Dr. Hanna in Dallas. PIV. Great care, easy recovery, short stay in town. Good asthetics. Depth was very disappointing.
</p>
<p>
I was going to Min Jun but him leaving Crane completely threw off my timetable and I couldn&#39;t wait another year to see if he would even take my insurance.
</p>
<p>
Had a consult with DeLeon and even though dates were only a week apart I was unimpressed with Crane Center admin staff due to my earlier FFS experience with them.
</p>
<p>
I had a friend get hers done with DeLeon and wonder if I should have gone with her.

Sanguan Kunaporn in Phuket, jejunal graft.  No regrets, although next time I might be less specific about my current partner (F) and more generic in what I was after in case that made a difference to the surgeons intent for graft size.

Dr Chettawut for me. That will be 18 years in January. No regrets ever. Even first few days when a little uncomfortable I never thought &#34;why did I do this&#34;

Personally I feel it looks perfect, works great, peeing is just normal, I am super happy with down there and my life, what more could I ask for

Dr Sanguan Kunaporn in Phuket 2 years ago yesterday. PIV with skin graft from thighs. Very happy with outcome and performance, enjoying penetrative sex and amount of lubrication is surprising. Would change from skin graft to jujenum if given another chance and had the extra $$, still have scarring on top of thighs which I don&#39;t like.

Dr. Sibh Gallagher (PIV technique)‚Ä¶total regret! Horrible experience! I don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôs still allowed to perform any srs surgeries for ANY trans person. Non responsive. Gave me no depth, and my clit looked like something out of a horror movie. I knew a revision was gonna be needed in the near future.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Del Coral (Peritoneal technique)‚Ä¶Amaaazing! He fixed everything Gallagher fucked up (thank GOD). He gave full depth. His staff was AMAZING. Time and care was taken by Dr Coral‚Äôs team to ensure I had a successful surgery. Highly recommended this surgeon and this technique. I dilate once a week because PPT method your vag doesn‚Äôt easily close..and no there is no crazy smells.

Dr Meltzer in 2014 in Scottsdale AZ.
</p>
<p>
Two stage that was three months apart.
</p>
<p>
Had extreme difficulty that was later (and only after me practicing considerable self advocacy) diagnosed as ‚Äúvaginal webbing.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
1/2 hour outpatient surgery later under local anesthesia and I was good to go.
</p>
<p>
Had a fairly active sex life with little to no issue but right before Covid I started to feel like the manner in which the vaginal opening was left along with the more than necessary erectile tissue made it harder and harder to dilate during down periods and caused chaffing and eventually bleeding.
</p>
<p>
I reported it to Kaiser SoCal as Dr Meltzer (who they had sent me to initially) was no longer practicing.
</p>
<p>
Then came the 4 years of hurry up and wait and being jerked around by the Kaiser West LA ‚Äúteam.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
And what resulted was it getting virtually impossible to dilate and me losing nearly all depth and width.
</p>
<p>
I kept being told ‚Äúoh this will be resolved with physical therapy‚Äù when it was clear I had experienced considerable stenosis.
</p>
<p>
I tried the therapy. It didn‚Äôt even make a dent.
</p>
<p>
Finally, after a considerable decline in mental and emotional health and being less ‚Äúkind‚Äù to the Kaiser crew, I finally got them to understand what was going on and had a revision peritoneal flap method done in January of 24 with Dr Poh.
</p>
<p>
Initially it seemed like the problem was solved but by mid to late February I realized something was wrong.
</p>
<p>
I was losing depth and a whole host of symptoms began to emerge.
</p>
<p>
A little later, every dilation was followed by significant bloating, constipation, fever, discomfort and numerous other symptoms along with bleeding/spotting and discharge.
</p>
<p>
And now again I am having to keep going back and get them to take me seriously and figure out what is going on. I‚Äôve already had two CT‚Äôs and numerous examinations and feel disrespected, dismissed and almost right back where I started.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs pretty disheartening and I am now terrified of each time I have to dilate as the side effects/symptoms end up putting me on my back for 2-3 days each time.
</p>
<p>
So in closing, no, I can‚Äôt recommend any of f the trans care at Kaiser west LA.
</p>

Ramineni in Washington DC. 100% regret. Wish my first choice (Selph) hadn&#39;t moved and gotten mired down in anti trans stuff or had planned from day 1 to go to the Crane Center. The Crane Center is doing their best to fix me currently. For those that are familiar with medical records, you know it&#39;s rough when your HPI starts off with &#34;this unfortunate patient...&#34;

Dr Theerapong, PPV, I&#39;m about 6 weeks post op and no complaints about the work - but I&#39;ve gotta wait for the swelling to settle down and see final results.
</p>
<p>
It looks good considering I was circumcised.

Dr Krakowsky, Toronto. No regrets.
</p>
<p>
I did require a revision, and may still go in for an additional touch up with another plastic surgeon later. Nothing about their work, just my healing.
</p>
<p>
I also have permanent nerve damage on my right side. However this may be a referral from my lower back and hip. We are still investigating.

Modified PI with Dr. Ramineni; he constructs a tube instead of a pocket to increase internal lubrication chances. I have absolutely no regrets! He&#39;s an artist that has completely changed my life!! ü•∞

Been with Dr. Bensimon at GRS Montreal with PIV and I have no regrets. The only thing I guess I regret is that my scars are still kinda a bit visible, but they&#39;re not that noticeable and it&#39;s my fault for not taking care of them enough I guess. And to be fair I prefer this over any serious issues, overall the surgeon did a fantastic job.

Dr. Wittenberg, MoZaic Care in SF. Peritoneal pull-through, penile preservation vaginoplasty. No regrets. I had a complication, but I was able to have it repaired by a local surgeon after nine months. I don&#39;t have the most depth, but I am very happy with my results.

Dr. Min Jun. Definitely regret surgery in general, and with him in particular. I didn&#39;t have a ton of tissue and was circumcised. I knew this would be a problem. But I listened to the surgeon who told me it was fine. Now I have a garbage tier result that I consider worse than not getting surgery at all.
</p>
<p>
But when I asked Min Jun he said being circumcised doesn&#39;t matter.
</p>
<p>
And then I specifically asked for a physical exam pre-surgery (he wasn&#39;t going to do this beforehand without me prompting him??) and he said I had enough tissue to make it work.
</p>
<p>
First thing he said in my first post op? &#34;You didn&#39;t have a lot of tissue and whoever circumcised you decided to opt to take too much rather than too little. So I had to make do.&#34; Guess you can&#39;t fault him for being too honest. Definitely don&#39;t just trust what the surgeon says- you&#39;re the one who had to live with the results, not them.
