Not my main account for obvious reasons. Also - please don&#39;t ask for a &#39;spread&#39; pic - not gonna happen. I am posting for informational purposes because McGinn doesn&#39;t ever seem to update her ancient website. So here you go - a fully healed McGinn result. I&#39;d say I am like 8.5/10 pleased with the result. Ask any questions you want - just please be respectful.
</p>
<p>
Edit - also - the variation in pigment is just my skin&#39;s natural variation from pre-op due to my mixed race heritage. It&#39;s not a surgical result or scarring

Sure... in my personal opinion, there is a slight bit too much urethral tissue and my clit
<em>
feels
</em>
a bit large to me. I only had a 6 month follow up and then covid. I plan on going back and getting her feedback and possible revision to reduce the urethral &#34;bulk&#34;.
</p>
<p>
And I do have a few hairs despite 100+ hours of electrolysis and the fact that she does a follicle scrape

Just wanna say thank you for giving a thoughtful take- so often nowadays it seems like things have to be 11/10 best thing ever!!! Or -1/10 OMG WORST, but I appreciate hearing those who fall in the middle.

I think there&#39;s a natural tendency to want to have the best result possible and therefore see your result in the best possible light. Then there is the hyper self-critical crowd. I also probably fall somewhere in the middle of that because my boyfriend thinks everything I mentioned is fine but still - it&#39;s hard for me not to be critical.
</p>
<p>
Edit - well not
<em>
everything
</em>
. He doesn&#39;t need to know about the hairs I mentioned. Every woman has her secrets, after all 😉

How many months did you have electrolysis for, and how long since you first got full clearance to the last session?

At the time or my consult, it was still quite clear. She actually said it looked great and that there should be no problem. In fairness, and based on other posts I have seen since then, I probably should have had a year or two worth of clearance. But I really couldn&#39;t wait any longer. I&#39;m hoping they come up with a way to address it permanently rather than me plucking

If you wanted to you might be able to get rid of it with medical tattooing.

My bleeding stopped super early. That&#39;s just me tho - I&#39;ve always been a fast healer and not much of a bleeder. Even when I was in hospital with drains for where the spermatic cord used to be, those drains barely filled up at all. I just don&#39;t bleed much.
</p>
<p>
I did have some very minor granulation - which can cause bleeding during dilation - that the PA treated with silver nitrate at my 6 week follow up. She also had me use hydrocortisone on my dilator for six weeks following that treatment to make sure it healed well and did not return. It didn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
At 6 months I was still dilating once or twice a day I think. By just under one year I backed it off to 1 to 2 times per week (with the PA&#39;s blessing) and have since reduced that gradually to maybe once every 2 weeks

My depth is a bit over 6 in. Sensation is fantastic. Especially after you&#39;ve gotten accustomed to the new config. That goes for orgasm as well. It&#39;s amazing really

So if you don&#39;t mind, who is McGinn? I am just looking for a little more information to point me in the good doctors direction. I&#39;m quickly approaching my 1 year mark and my doctor has already suggested I started looking into doctors for surgeries

Would you recommend her to others?  And was your surgery the PPT or the penile inversion?
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s at the top of my list, so I&#39;m exceptionally curious.  Personally, I want the large clit result you got, so that sounds like a bonus to me.  Though the hair thing is pretty troubling.  How deep are those?

It was PI, but the way she does it - it&#39;s mostly scrotal donor tissue to form the vaginal canal. She uses mostly penile skin to form the labia. Not what I would have thought but I asked up front - what bits will be where - and she explained it fully. PI is really not accurate imho.
</p>
<p>
They are not so deep that I can&#39;t pluck them with my fingers. It&#39;s still a major bummer tho
</p>
<p>
Oh and yes - I would recommend. It&#39;s her whole staff also. Everyone is really lovely. McGinn is a bit clinical but she exudes confidence and has a sense of humor that I appreciate so we got on well

Thank you. Thankfully I missed whatever was said and you removed it before I had to. This is why I created this account yesterday simply to make this post for people who will find it informational. In that span of time, less than 24 hours, I have almost 20 followers.  Most of them creeps, no doubt. It&#39;s a shame but that&#39;s why I created this separate account specifically. I wanted to pay it forward and help out other people looking for recent McGinn results, but didn&#39;t want this kind of traffic on my main account. Shame that there&#39;s so many creepers here. Thanks for doing such a great job as mod!

It’s good of you to post. I’m definitely with you on paying it forward.
</p>
<p>
You can disable following if you want, but they are still all over the site. Personally I don’t care as long as they keep it to themselves, and if they don’t I report them to the site admins to get them banned from the entire site.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also left mine since there’s a lot of trans people who follow me.

I didn&#39;t know you could disable it. I might do that on my main account. Thanks for that.
</p>
<p>
Anyone following me is going to be disappointed because this is the only post there will ever be from this account haha
