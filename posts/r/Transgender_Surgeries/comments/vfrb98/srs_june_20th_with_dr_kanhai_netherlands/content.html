Throwaway alt because friends follow my main one.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is the big day! Bottom surgery with Dr. Kanhai in the Netherlands. I would appreciate to hear your experiences if you have underwent surgery.
</p>
<p>
Their clinic isn&#39;t too good at providing information. So I am not able to mentally prepare in the slightest. It&#39;s going to be a tough time for me. Please speak freely. What did you take with you? What should I keep in mind? What is the toughest part?
</p>
<p>
Monday is the surgery, Wednesday I will be sent home. The Monday after I have to return.
</p>
<p>
Thanks all!

Not much information to offer, but just my best wishes and lots of strength!
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s not much info around about most European surgeons, so you could be the one starting helping others in this respect if you feel like it later.
</p>
<p>
Again, best of all, and as they say over there: Success!

Do you have someone to help take care of you after you go home? This surgery is brutal and it&#39;s the norm for recovery to be really difficult without some help.

I do, I will be recovering at my mom&#39;s place. Surgeon told me I am supposed to be able to do everything myself after the surgery (dilate, clean, etc). I am very worried about the recovery period and the pain. We have to leave in about 5 hours from now because they scheduled me at 6:45AM. I am wide awake and can&#39;t seem to fall asleep... This will be a journey haha

Well, even if you can&#39;t sleep now, you&#39;ll probably sleep super well after surgery! I slept most of the day after waking up from mine.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s gonna be a challenge, I won&#39;t lie. Some people have less pain than others, but it&#39;s best to go in ready to deal with the worst. The first week after is going to suck, especially once it sinks in that a long recovery is what you have to go through and that there&#39;s no way around it. But the good part is that healing goes pretty quick once you get into your new routine. After the first month, most of the major swelling will be gone, and after the second the pain should be way less. Just stay on top of your dilation schedule, take as many pain meds as you feel you need to (without taking too many, of course), and allow yourself the space to be frustrated because it likely will happen. This is a major change in your life, and it&#39;ll be bumpy, but you can and will make it through this.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck to you! ðŸŒ·
