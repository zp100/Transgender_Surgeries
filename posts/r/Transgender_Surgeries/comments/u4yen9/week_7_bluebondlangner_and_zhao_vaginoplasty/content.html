hello again! we hit 7weeks yesterday! almoat two months! wild.
</p>
<p>
im definitely ready to be done with the healing process, and i want to like have sex again lol.
</p>
<p>
dilating is just like a thing i do all the time. im now sized to the green pretty consistently. im cleared for 3x a day, but its always better to do 4, so i still try to shoot for 4 but dont stress if i hit 3. my schedule is like thus:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
first: 15 minutes blue
</li>
<li>
second, third, fourth: 5 minutes blue, 15 minutes green
</li>
</ul>
<p>
all the labia stitches are dissolved or taken out. theres still some tenderness along the top of the labia and mons pubis is a bit tender still. i believe there are still some internal stitches in the clitoris and urethra area and in the vagina but theyre like on their last legs for sure. those should be gone over the next month.
</p>
<p>
my 6w appointment was good, no issues.
</p>
<p>
i douche just about every morning still, i guess it helps reduce the possibility of granulatjon tissue, which rears its head around this time to 3mo. just trying to stay on it. i still have this tender skin at the introitus which is just kind of stubbornly irritated, acquacell for the next week or so should help.
</p>
<p>
otherwise, pretty much back to normal activity, walking and driving. sitting just requires the right position and the waffle cushion. im probably going to start easing into workouts soon to rebuild my deflated glutes lol.

wow this is one of the best results i&#39;ve seen, I genuinely thought it&#39;s cis. most of the time in this sub I can instantly tell if the vulva is cis or not. (no offense to others)
</p>
<p>
you don&#39;t even have scars?!
</p>
<p>
I know this might be too much to ask and feel free to ignore, but is there a way you could post an image with the labia spread?
</p>
<p>
how much did it cost? I wonder if I can have surgery there from Canada

you can def have surgery here from canada, not sure how insurance works tho. with aetna insurance i paid 4k. i think my insurance company ended up paying 20k. i think they were charged like 125k or something.
</p>
<p>
i have scars, i just dont really scar very badly.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Just to clarify for anyone not used to US healthcare barbarism, the actual price tag is usually completely fictitious. Most healthcare providers have a made-up price that goes on the books(the 125k in this example), a price that the insurance would pay (a lot less), and a price that someone without insurance would pay (this varies wildly by whole orders of magnitude and is sometimes up on the spot).
</p>
<p>
So if you wanted to roll up from Canada, you have to call and ask how much it would cost if you&#39;re paying on your own without insurance

Great work! If you don&#39;t mind me asking, what was your hair removal choices pre op? I appreciate the retention of some natural hair. How far on the area did you need to perform hair removal?

i wasnt sure which surgeon id go with, so i did 2 years of electrolysis on the scrotal area and penis and just above (the horseshoe). rbl requires like an inverted triangle from the middle of your scrotal sack to the groun crease, with the point of the triangle at the top of the anys. so, basically, all of the perineum. i did about a year and a half there.
</p>
<p>
as far as i can tell, i dont have any hair inside. whatever hair you see here is like long hairs coming from outside the scars. hair removal post op is a thing you kind of have to be cautious of first few months post op

Hey thanks for sharing!
</p>
<p>
Can I ask what your opinion of Dr. Bluebond-Langner was during consults? All the results photos I&#39;ve seen look fantastic, yours very much included. Cannot believe you&#39;re only at 7 weeks, like holy crap! :D

i thought she and zhao were great. i had consults with avanessian and wittenberg. wittinberg really rubbed me the wrong way, personally. i cried after that consult. avanessian was also great, but i decided for rbl bc peritoneal flap and bc nyu def had its shit together more than mt sinai.

Gotcha! I&#39;m always amazed at how much variance there is in peoples&#39; experience, sorry things were so bad for you with Wittenberg. I felt really flustered after my consult with her but not because of anything she did.
</p>
<p>
Glad to hear your consult with her and Zhao were so good! I was on the fence about setting up something with them because of some other factors, but will probably look into it more now. Thanks again so much for sharing! Hope the healing continues uneventfully!! &lt;3

wittenberg was very dismissive of some of my questions and our community here. ex:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
i asked about sensation of hybrid penile inversion ppt and her response was like &#34;oh youre the third person whose asked me this... i can always tell whatevers going on in the current blogosphere by these questions.&#34; it was said in a very flippant tone. like, excuse me, even if we&#39;re under some wrong impression, these communities are here because DOCTORS dont share their information unless you have a $200+ consult, three letters, and a 9 month waitlist minimum.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
she requested i sign a arbitration clause before even meeting with her.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
i was concerned about ppt as having too much lubrication all the time and she was dismissive of the concern. like: &#34;i dont understand the problem, and you can just wear liners all the time.&#34; she followed it up with &#34;welcome to being cis.&#34; which.. just. no. im not cis, never will be even if i have a vagina. and, like. wtf.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
i asked her why she started doing bottom surgeries and her response was, &#34;i was born for this,&#34; and it felt very entitled and like separate from, idk, our humanity.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
she got visibly irritated when i asked her about how her methods different from other surgeons. it almost felt like she had beef with RBL. that was really offputting.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
so, ya. that was my first consult and thats how we were treated in it. and it was not enjoyable, and she made me cry.

Wow, that&#39;s a lot. I&#39;m really sorry you had to deal with all that :*( You&#39;d think surgeons would be more empathetic to people given how much they see their patients go through!

Having seen a lot of vaginas over the years (the internet is a wonderful place), I honestly can&#39;t tell that it&#39;s not cis. That is just amazing. This gives me hope.

You look amazing! That&#39;s such good work. You must be happy. How good are they at creating depth? I have seen some DR&#39;s create about 7 inches +/-. Just wondering how they compare.
