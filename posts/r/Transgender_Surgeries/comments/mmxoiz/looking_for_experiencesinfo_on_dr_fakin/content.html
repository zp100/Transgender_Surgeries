Hi everyone, My girlfriend is planning to have her srs with dr fakin in Madrid. We found some results on his official website but we would love to find people who actually had surgery with him. (how the care is, what he&#39;s like as a person, recovery etc. Pictures of results only if the person feels comfortable sharing) Anyone willing to share their experiences? Thanks a lot in advance!
</p>

I did not have surgery with him but he used to work at university hospital of zurich and was let go after a few years because he put breast implants in a trans woman who only wanted SRS surgery. They did not talk about this before surgery and when she woke up she had breast implants and srs. I personally met him IRL before and he seemed very arrogant. Also i have read about someone who got SRS with him and they were left without a clitoral hood which is really bad since the clitoris needs the hood to be protected. I can&#39;t speak for others but here in zurich he always had a bad reputation in regards to SRS and he was known as a botcher. In the end you will have to figure this out yourself but i&#39;m trying to spread awareness of his past...

A plastic surgeon who worked with him back in the day at university hospital of zurich told me personally about the breast implant incident... its quite horrible. I can&#39;t say much about his work nowadays but i&#39;ve also heard recently (like a month ago) from a friend of mine that her friend got a liplift done with Dr. Fakin and she got botched apparently. I&#39;m sure he doesen&#39;t botch everyone but theres enough evidence that he has botched people in the past, thats all i can say.

I do not recommend going to him for srs at all. He has a very bad reputation as a surgeon in general and he is known to botch people. He is just not a good surgeon in general in my opinion. I have yet to hear anything good about him. Everything i&#39;ve heard and seen of him is bad to be honest. He has botched many people here in Zurich and he fails to do even the easy operations like a Liplift for example. Stay away from him if you can.

Be careful of surgeons that tells you that they can do everything very well.

I just had a consult with him, and just from a video call, he seemed to be able to tell me what I could or couldn&#39;t achieve, and I don&#39;t know if I fully agree, but was also a bit pushy about wanting to see if I was ready to take next steps and look at booking. Idk, maybe it&#39;s because it was Friday and he wanted to go home?

Hey there so I know this post is quite old but Iâ€™d like to give my 2 cents. I was operated for srs by Dr Fakin in ZÃ¼rich 2 years ago and honestly I had nothing but a great experience. I went for penile inversion he spent 4 hours operating and was very meticulous. The results are great: it looks and feels fantastic.
</p>
<p>
Only downside is that unfortunately there are some hairs along the vaginal canal inside, but honestly its really not that bad. Especially since I really had a LOT of hair on my scrotum skin pre op, so itâ€™s only normal that I have some residual ones.
</p>
<p>
Other than that the depth is great, I keep it clean, and everything healed well and my clitoral hood is very much present. And even if it was lacking, I have been told that at revision one year post op they routinely inject a little bit of fat if needed be. It takes very well in the area and corrects any irregularities of the clitoral hood.
</p>
