Not the best pictures but I’m mostly happy with the results from Dr.Cardenas in Mexico.  I had type 3 forehead, lip lift and chin contouring.  I still have a bit of a black eye that I have to cover with concealer and the hairline scar is still pretty pink and tender.  I had pretty big patches of numbness directly after surgery.  My entire left eyebrow and up to the hairline was numb as well as the left side of my lower lip.  There’s still a slight hint of numbness on the lip but it’s basically unnoticeable.  The numbness on the eyebrow has completely gone away. The whole top of my head was numb from the hairline back which felt super weird at first.  That has already started to fade, the feeling is very slowly starting to come back.  Something I wasn’t expecting was the amount of hair loss around the incisions on the side of my scalp down to the ear and what seems like thinning on the top of my scalp.  I’m getting an alarming amount of hair coming out by the root every time I wash my hair.  It’s getting to be less each time but it was scary at first.  That’s something I’m going to bring up next time I see my doctor.  Not sure how normal that is especially the thinning on top.

My understanding is that shock loss isn&#39;t uncommon. I had some of it myself.

But it looks to me that you had great results, especially on the brow ridge!

Thank you, I just read that from another post.  It’s very reassuring.  It sounds like Fianastride might slow it down, I’ll ask my doctor about that.
</p>
<p>
And thanks, the brow ridge was my biggest concern and I’m really happy with the results. I was on the fence about doing my chin but it really made a nice difference as well.  You can’t really see the difference in a side profile because it was mostly just made a bit narrower and rounder/smoother?

Yeah, from what I&#39;ve read, the two biggest bangs for your buck for FFS are the forehead brow ridge and the chin.
</p>
<p>
In my case a third one was hairline (fixed via hair transplant).
</p>
<p>
Everything else can certainly help feminize your face, but IMO, those are the top three things.

To reiterate, you had the full type III forehead reconstruction procedure, right? Not the type I grind+glue procedure? Your results look fantastic and I&#39;m really tempted to try and reach out to his clinic.

Yes that&#39;s right, , type III.  As the swelling is continuing to go down I actually wish he took just a little bit more from the center. But all in all I&#39;m very pleased.

Hey again - do you know how Dr. Cardenas determined which type of forehead procedure was most appropriate? The consult person is saying he makes the decision between type 1 and type 3
<em>
after
</em>
you&#39;re already under. Did you get any kind of radiology testing done beforehand?

No testing before hand. He seemed 100% sure he would be doing type 3 from my pictures and then again at my in person consultation.
<br>
From what I remember though he uses a kind of light technique? It clearly outlines the sinus and he can determine the amount of material that can be safely removed.  It’s somewhere on the TransOp site.  I’ll see if I can find it and provide a link.

Okay, then it&#39;s probably just a quirk of my skull geometry that he couldn&#39;t make a clear determination. I&#39;m gonna get a skull CT done just to be sure.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, the consultant called it &#39;transillumination&#39;, which is amusingly appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Also thank you for replying!

I do but I’ve been putting KitosCell on the scar every night and it’s starting to fade.  They said to keep applying it for the first six months. The scar under my nose healed quickly and is basically unnoticeable already.

I had ffs with Dr Cardenas aswell and the hairline scar looked pretty bad. But I knew that before going under the knife and already saved money for a hair transplant beforehand.

Scarring is normal, but the appearance of it depends on the individual unfortunately.

If you go to
<a href="http://www.TransOp.com">www.TransOp.com
</a>
they have all the prices on there.  They are In Guadalajara Mexico.  My package price included 10 days at their recovery house and transportation to and from the airport as well as to all appointments.  Also there were no surprise costs, the anesthesia and your first order of prescriptions are included in the price.  For the total package they charged me $11,380 USD. On top of that my only other cost was the flight to Guadalajara.
</p>
<p>
I actually went down 4 days earlier and stayed downtown in an Airbnb.  The historic city center is very vibrant and I was there for the start of the day of the dead celebrations.
</p>
<p>
The recovery house is quite nice, it’s in a gated community in a pretty high end part of the city.  It’s a short walk to a real cool massive shopping mall.  They serve a basic breakfast and put out a late lunch/dinner.  In the morning there’s cereal, yogurt and muffins but they have no problem making you an omelet or something if you ask.  Lunch/dinner always has a nice soup, some kind of rice or pasta, lots of veggies and some meat options.  Each room has an en-suite bath and a tv with tons of streaming options.
</p>
<p>
During my stay there was only one other girl staying there but she was only there for 4 nights.  The rest of the time it was just the owner and his employee that both live there and the two ladies that come in to cook and clean.
</p>
<p>
Oh ya, and that price includes you and one other person.  My mom came down and stayed with me the whole time.
