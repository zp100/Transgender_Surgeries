I&#39;ve had several half-day (3-hour) bottom sessions (none on face). They were great. Staff were friendly, there was music on to listen to.
</p>
<p>
They do the local numbing jabs, then seem to work quickly. If you feel any pain, or as the anaesthetic wears off you can let them know and they can move to another area or add more drugs. They take a 10-min break every hour so the electrolosist can rest their eyes - it takes quite a bit of focus for them.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t need the area cleared, but was told they can&#39;t do the shaft of the penis, other areas are fine.
</p>
<p>
It was generally very easy and I&#39;d go back again if ever needed.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards i was a bit sore and tender, with some swelling but not too bad. X

I had a consult on Monday. She did a small spot on my face for free. It was swollen for 2 to 3 days. Nothing major but I could feel something under the skin. I moisturized and it has gone away. I imagine that for a large area it will take longer for the swelling to go down. It‚Äôs not anything like what you are about to do, but I didn‚Äôt think it hurt very much.

For reference, I have had long 4 hour tattoo sessions, and this was nothing compared to that and I didn‚Äôt numb anything for my consult

I‚Äôm glad you survived. I had laser resurfacing on my nose due to rosacea. Shots in the face hurt a lot.

Have had large volume done 3 times/2 days at a time with 2 electrologist, so total about 30 hrs over 2 days with local anesthetic. First time lots of swelling lower face with bruising from injections. As local wears off it hurts quite a bit. Unless re-inject which hurts. Each time swelling and bruising are less until go to one day. Think much better lg vol than 1-3 hrs at a time altho tried it once upon a time. Bring music or audiobooks. Use ice and sleep sitting to decrease swelling which lasts 4-7 days. After one week exfoliate ever few days as at least for me ingrown hair. Appx 10 to 12 weeks between sessions as hair grows in cycles. üò∑üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

Can apply skin anesthetic like Emla cream (need script) or several on Amazon you could get like Texas SuperJuice ( silly name but combo of three anesthetics) which I use prior to injections. I also take 2 Tylenol which helps.
