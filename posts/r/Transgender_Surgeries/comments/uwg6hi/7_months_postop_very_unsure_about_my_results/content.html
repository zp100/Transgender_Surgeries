Yeah girl, I’d get the revision. It’s normal to have less than satisfactory results the first time. I’m no exception - I have revision surgery in about 6 weeks

Actually no, it’s not normal to have unsatisfactory results. But maybe it’s becoming the new normal.  It’s likely due to the recent influx of new and inexperienced surgeons in the US just starting to perform SRS. They can make a lot of money from it since it’s being covered by insurance nowadays.

Good luck!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m trying to stay optimistic despite it all. At least now I know I wasn&#39;t just overthinking things
</p>
<p>
Are you getting a revision at the same surgeon?

Yes, I really like my surgeon and feel that she&#39;s extremely capable.  I have to remember that making a vagina from scratch is not exactly a straightforward process and it&#39;s common to have some revision work after everything has healed.  My surgery was 1 year ago with Dr. Gladys Ng at UCLA.  I have some issues with definition between labia majora and minora as well as not having a well defined clitoral hood.  My urine stream is also not great, so I&#39;m hoping she can fix that and a few other details.

Yeah, a lot of folks here are advising me to find another surgeon but I&#39;m feeling inclined to stick with this team for many of the same reasons. (As well as the convenience of location + cost factor. I&#39;m a student so I can&#39;t afford to travel far.)
</p>
<p>
Definitely conflicted though.
</p>
<p>
My next appointment with them is in early July, so at least I have time to think about it

Realistically, constructing a functional vagina in one step and making it aesthetically pleasing to the owner is hard. It can be done, but the surgeon can’t really predict how it will heal.

I disagree. We should not be giving a free pass to new and inexperienced SRS surgeons, just because they are “helping” trans people by doing surgeries. We should be holding them to a higher standard and calling them out when they produce unsatisfactory results.

Penile Inversion with Dr. Amir Taghinia, Dr. Oren Ganor, and Dr. Richard Yu.
</p>
<p>
Last outpatient check-in was in March. I was assured all going well with recovery.  But save for some scar tissue healing, not much else then was different from its current appearance.
</p>
<p>
The neo-clitoris was and still is perpetually exposed. The labial(?) assymetry still present. The middle tissue(?) still protruding despite the betamethasone ointment they prescribed.

I don’t want to make you feel feel bad at all but I definitely think you need a revision. I would focus on constructing inner labia and clitoral hood. I don’t think the clit should retain a ridge like that.

Surprisingly, I feel more relieved and vindicated than bad. That it wasn&#39;t just me overthinking things

Thank you for the input, and I&#39;ll definitely bring that up at the next check-in

If you would like a revision, it may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/">Here</a>
may be more, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic">Djordjevic</a>
may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time.

I would get a revision if i were you. These results are often from doctors in europe and US , it feels like they do this on purpose so the patient goes back to them to get a revision later and pay more money.
</p>
<p>
My Dr. In Thailand did everything in one surgery , yes the surgery is 10 hours but i dont have to go again to get labiaplasty.

I can only recommend my surgeon doctor Theerapong and my after care team Siam Transformative. Since i only went to them. Dr. Thee does revisions. I haven&#39;t had a revision i just had my srs with him 3 months ago you can check out my results on my profile.
</p>
<p>
There are more results of his on

I googled all three of them and it doesn’t sound like they do a lot of this surgery. I’d recommend going to someone who ONLY does this.

<p>
I’m going to Dr. McGinn in July and trust her. Stuff happens but at least she’s done over thousand SRS surgeries.

Thank you so much for your input!
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I definitely need a hood. Even if putting aside aesthetics, it&#39;s just plain uncomfortable! But hey, at least I managed to regain full sensitivity?
</p>
<p>
The darker coloration adds up with my ethnicity then. I&#39;ll inquire about the silicon gel at my next check-in.
</p>
<p>
I looked up my medical notes, and it&#39;s referred to as the “urethral plate”. What&#39;s confused me all this time was how different the middle appearance was from all the other photos here 😂
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, you are right that the urine stream does get caught to the side and I have to clean down there thoroughly every time.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m trying to stay optimistic though. At least I&#39;m dilating well and have good depth!

From what I am seeing there is no hole in the vulva leading to the vaginal canal as well. At least this is what I am seeing.
</p>
<p>
I am not sure if you got zero depth vaginoplasty, but even if you get zero depth usually a vagina still has a entrance even if it is zero depth. I&#39;ve seen many cis and srs vagina&#39;s, yours looks odd to me.
</p>
<p>
Not trying to be mean, just trying to point out stuff I am seeing.
</p>
<p>
I hope that if you get revision done that it goes better this time!

care to give your cis 2 cents on bluebond-langner. she&#39;s the surgeon im thinking of going with atm. It&#39;s frustrating because there aren&#39;t many posts where people are spread so I can see how the clitoris looks.
