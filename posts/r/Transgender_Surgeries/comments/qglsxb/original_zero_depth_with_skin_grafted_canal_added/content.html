May I ask why did you receive zero depth in the first place and added the canal later? I&#39;m considering minimal depth due to various reasons including no interest in sex, scaring issues, quicker recovery and not being able to be committed to dilation as I&#39;m not interested in sex.

This is interesting, I assumed this is what would happen at least sometimes with people who get zero depth and told someone that they might change their mind about wanting a canal. I guess there&#39;s a possibility I was right

It doesn&#39;t always happen. Most girls are good with it. I was at first. When my dysphoria became so little it made me realize, I now had room in my life for more things and that became important to me, whereas it never was before. I had NO clue it would alleviate my dysphoria so much!

Thanks for sharing! Happy for you. It seems that adding the canal later is also a viable option. I&#39;m from Asia and prone to hypertrophic and keloid scars. I&#39;ve heard terrible stories of difficult and painful dilation and recovery for Asian people who are prone to scar tissue formation. Also I&#39;m 33 and have zero experience in sex or romantic relationship and I think I&#39;m asexual. I think I would regret if I had a full depth because I don&#39;t have any motivation to dilate. Also it is really hard to spare so much time to do dilation sessions in such a busy society here. But at least I maybe have the option to add a canal if sex becomes important to me and I have the money, time and energy. There are really so many compromises that I have to make.

I feel like the fact that you have zero experience is a good reason to not close doors yet

Right. But I have zero interest in sex. I think motivation is the key to keep on doing dilation. So the problem is that because I have zero interest in sex, I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t stick to the required dilation schedule and may give up dilation very soon if I had a full-depth SRS, leading to vaginal stenosis that needs another surgery to fix. (Not considering my Asian scarring issues that may cause dilation extremely painful and difficult than other people.) That being said, if I receive minimal depth SRS first, as in OP&#39;s experience, there are still options to add a canal when it turns out that I have changed my mind and at that time I probably would like to do my dilations, which is probably better than or similar to a failed canal that needs revision due to no dilation.

I have some scarring issues because my body healed improperly in one specific spot and because I was unfortunate enough to have stitch come loose, but dilation hasn&#39;t been painful past the first 3 weeks. Occasionally I get pain from moving around because the scar is close to my legs and butt
</p>
<p>
Some definitely have issues with dilation from weird nerve healing and such, but it&#39;s not guaranteed even when you have bad scars

Dilation means 2+ hours every day less time + dilation-schedule = every 6 hours about 40-45 min (everything included), stress when travelling, when doing party, when having long work shifts, etc. Your decision! You&#39;ll notice what that means, when after having been working for 8 hours, being out of home for 10 hours, you want to go shopping, or to the gym, or so but you better do not. To not dilate for longer than 10h means: it closes slowly, you loose width. You&#39;ll also directly notice that getting the dilator -in- will be (much) harder. You&#39;ll have to start with one size smaller in order to get in first - then - OMG, you forgot the smaller dilator - You only brought the larger one with you - which you can&#39;t get inserted = frustration and so on.. Not to speak about hygiene, being disturbed or not able to dilate.
</p>
<p>
Yes you can skip a dilation round but you&#39;ll soon experience, why it&#39;s better not to skip ANY dilation session, especially in the first months.
</p>
<p>
So to say: If you can (wisely!) foresee that you won&#39;t have sex (too old, not sexually active, no social contacts, feeling unattractive - no matter if with a tunnel or not), maintaining your daily freedom (no dilation schedule)
<strong>
might
</strong>
be worth more than &#34;feeling complete&#34;, as there can not be such feeling, as I see here on Reddit every day, every hour... Many transgender will never feel complete and run to the surgeon every 6 months for the next appointment on their uncanny route to - feeling complete - beauty surgeries are a topic of it&#39;s own - and transsexuals, who will only undergo the &#34;most necessary&#34; surgeries, instead of every1 possible, have my full respect! ;-)

Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I won&#39;t feel incomplete if I&#39;m without a canal. I don&#39;t have so much genital dysphoria so SRS to me is more associated with being normal as a girl in certain circumstances and getting my ID changed. In fact, I accept the fact that I cannot be the same in every aspect as a cis girl. Being socially accepted as a girl is sufficient for me to fulfil my goal. But at least if I change my mind in the future, there are still options to add a vaginal canal.

I am unsure for other surgeons but mine only specified 3 times a day for 20 min each of dialating.
</p>
<p>
I skipped two days once for stupid reasons (flying home - my luggage was lost and therefor I did not have my dilators for two whole days)  once I dilated I found that it wasn&#39;t quite as bad as some made out to be. I started from the beginning thinking the worst and realized I could go right back to number 3 with little effort. I dont know its its the type of canal I had or what that caused it not to shrink so quickly, or that I use vaginal estrogen cream once a week maybe?  Who knows!
</p>
<p>
Anyhow ymmv of course. I dont find dilating to be that bad and I routinely skip a session as there just isn&#39;t enough time for 3 every day with my position and responsibilities.

Um...it gave my about 5.5 inches of depth..  not sure if that is the answer you need - if you already have depth and want to add to it this way im just not sure?

A bit off topic  but what is that scar running along your waist from? Also you have wonderful hips. So nice and wide. Did you get a hip fillers or a butt lift?

Actually not at all off topic!  That scar was from the skin graft used to make my canal.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!  Nope- those are all natural hips and butt!  I&#39;ve always had more of a feminine figure, my wife has always said that as well, she was jealous of my waste and butt.

Did they just pick an area of loose skin and tighten up the whole area in the process?

No - that is a typical spot for skin grafts, especially for enough connected skin for the canal. The thigh was another spot they would have used if they didnt get enough.
