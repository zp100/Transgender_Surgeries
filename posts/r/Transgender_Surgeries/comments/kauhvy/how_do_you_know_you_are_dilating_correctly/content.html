Sounds like you’re doing just fine and thats great depth. Like other people have said, just try and relax, use lots of lube and don’t overthink it.
</p>
<p>
Also I can HIGHLY recommend pelvic floor therapy. It’s the most useful thing I did post op and really helped me

What does that involve? What’s the benefit from doing that for post op women?

It helps to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and relax scar tissue in your neovagina. Sounds counter intuitive since we all want things to be not so tight, and having a stronger pelvic floor seems to suggest the opposite - but it really helped me to learn good techniques and I believe it’s allowed me to have better sex sooner tbh. It was highly recommended by my surgeon

We don&#39;t have a cervix, which is the opening to a uterus. Much older trans vaginoplasty techniques did create sort of a neocervix from the head of the penis, but those techniques haven&#39;t been used in about 30 years. Once surgeons figured out how to make functional clitorises, nobody really wanted the cervix that didn&#39;t actually do anything anymore. I don&#39;t even know if there are any surgeons still practicing who are trained in that technique, it&#39;s that old.

Interesting. My surgeon said that they made me a huge vagina but now that I&#39;m really in the swing of dilating, I can get to one dot showing on the purple (smallest) dilator. I&#39;m not sure if I already lost some depth. Either way, it&#39;s fine to be honest.
