tw: botched surgeries, transphobia
</p>
<p>
hello! i am a trans girl who underwent penile inversion vaginoplasty with dr. christine mcginn in june 2020. i am 20 y/o, 1.5 yrs HRT. this is my story - complications, existential dread, and probably some stuff you’ve already heard.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
complications
</strong>
beginning about 5-6 days post-op, i had necrosis of the top layer of my labia. it was fairly minor - the black, dead skin slowly shed and there was healthy tissue beneath so i was cleared to go home without worry. however, by day 12, it became more severe and located further into my labia and vaginal opening. everything was yellow and gooey, slowly draining out into a raw, patchy mess of a labia. it went from a snake shedding its skin to deep chunks of my vulva missing.
</p>
<p>
after about 2 months, things began healing back, but still not without aftermath. my labia are asymmetrical and weirdly shaped because the sutures helping to define them were anchored in the now dead and gone skin. in an attempt to heal, my body kept growing granulation tissue. but it kept growing and growing past what it should’ve, causing my vagina to nearly close from being so tight.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
second surgery
</strong>
even putting aside the horrific look of the excess growth, and childbirth-like pain that dilation was now causing me (if i even could)... this was a huge problem that needed immediate attention. dr. mcginn prescribed me hydrocortisone cream to help, which didn’t. dr. powers, my pcp, instead recommended that i have surgery immediately to cut and cauterize all of the granulation tissue. needless to say this was quite traumatic, although i’m glad to report that it was a success in addressing that specific concern.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
third surgery?
</strong>
i now am left with quite a bit of scar tissue from the hell my pussy has been through. this is an issue in particular with my vaginal opening, which now has an extremely small and thick aperture. because of this i am no longer able to even use the #1 dilator, even though there is enough diameter deeper in my vaginal canal. there is no consensus about what should happen to help with this, but all attempts to dilate have not stretched it hardly, so my non-expert opinion is that a sort-of episiotomy is in order.. in addition to fixing the aesthetic fuck ups i mentioned earlier.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
aesthetics
</strong>
imo, my vulva looks depressing in comparison to any natal vulva. my labia minora is hardly defined so it just looks like there’s a slit in my body. all of it is a dark brown color, no pink on my labia minora. especially when standing, you can see a clear line where my mons ends and then it dips in to shrivley skin where the my vulva is. it looks like someone stamped a pad shape into me almost. you can also notice this strange shape when wearing certain underwear.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
dysphoria
</strong>
i have none! wearing leggings, bikinis, etc now is so amazing and comfortable. it has been the silver lining keeping me moderately sane.
</p>
<p>
nonetheless i still feel very shameful about my vulva and am always uncomfortable to show partners. it’s just ugly and wrong i feel :-(
</p>
<p>
<strong>
post-op depression
</strong>
i struggled for a few weeks after coming home for a few reasons. firstly, i was bedridden in my apt during quarantine. i couldn’t see anyone and no one wanted to see me. day to day tasks on my own wore me down physically which translated to emotional exhaustion as well.
</p>
<p>
second, i couldn’t stop thinking about surgery regret and the permanence of my surgery results. bottom surgery absolutely is still necessary for me, but maybe i should have considered other surgeons - i thought. i don’t want my genitals to be mutilated, and i initially felt strongly that they had been. less so now, but i still sometimes get depressed when i think about them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
dilating
</strong>
it’s a chore. you all know this, so all i’ll say is that some of the other posts of sheer misery are not being terribly overdramatic. it’s only painful for the first few minutes. otherwise it’s just tight/uncomfortable, and very time consuming. “i can’t right now, i’m dilating” will be a more commonly used phrase than you’d like. it will take some emotional strength to stick to your schedule.
</p>
<p>
the open wounds on my labia and vaginal opening made this 100x worse. the only way i was able to dilate without tapping out from pain (and i’m a masochist) is to get insanely high or take narcotics. just in case we wanted to add substance abuse issues to this shitshow. after my second surgery things are now fine pain-wise.
</p>
<p>
work from home has made the dilation schedule a bit more doable. also i would recommend finding an activity you can do with one hand to pass the time, you will get bored quick.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
bedside manner
</strong>
there has been much talk of her bedside manner and it has had kind of a mixed consensus. initially at my consult i thought she was very sweet but direct and felt good about her patient relationships. but it later became clear that she is busy with many patients and does not have the capacity to give any individualized attention.
</p>
<p>
going into surgery we only spoke for about 2 minutes, it was all small talk so i never had a chance to ask my questions pre-op. i didn’t see her after surgery until i was ready to be discharged, my surgery buddy never got a call from her or the hospital either. after i left, i had some concerns about tearing stitches and i called the emergency number she gave. she was a bit short and dismissive that i even asked. at my first post-op appt though, she goes “i think you’re the only one i didn’t hear from this weekend!” and then proceeded to nonchalantly admit that she fucked up the way that she stitched my packing in... huh. it was stitched on my ass basically, pulling my skin a painful and concerning amount as well as covering my asshole (how am i going to shit?!). dr. powers independently noticed and was confused. once the packing came out, things were okay minus extra scars.
</p>
<p>
in retrospect, i feel much of the planning i had to do in the months leading up to surgery were not adequately informed by the office. i spent a lot of time learning from friends who are also patients of hers and just as lost as me.
</p>
<p>
i was repeatedly deadnamed in the hospital, on phone calls, and during visits despite explicitly correcting her staff and the nurses. there is also no reason for nurses to he/him me while i’m in the hospital for gender affirming surgery. i doubt this is a common experience but it still was extremely bothersome esp as this doesn’t even happen to me in my daily life these days.
</p>
<p>
further, i do not feel that she has acknowledged or properly addressed my complications - instead dismissing them as “this is just the way they heal.” to an extent, yes, it is going to be pretty damn messy for most initially. but necrosis of half the labia should not be made out as normal. so i have instead had to rely on dr. powers to tell me truthfully what’s going on with my body and how to manage it - not everyone has access to someone as knowledgeable as him. their medical advice has been contradictory to one another, making navigating things post-op even more confusing.
</p>
<p>
dr. mcginn to date will not call me back re: the most recent set of complications. because she is unwilling to even talk with me about my health (and further surgery), i’m currently exploring other surgeons.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
depth
</strong>
at my first post-op, they used a long q-tip to measure me and it was 6”. however even that night, i was not able to get past about 5” with the #1. currently i am about 4-4.5”. they were extremely dismissive of my concerns both initially and at my 6 week appt, essentially saying “it was 6 inches, remember, so this permanent loss is your fault” and granted, i have not been dilating as aggressively as prescribed recently (due to severe pain, reliance on addictive painkillers, and physical limitations), but that doesn’t address the discrepancy on day 1 or how to proceed. i can only fit about a finger‘s worth in diameter due to more recent complications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
the others
</strong>
i am not the only patient of mcginn who has recently experienced this. three other friends of mine had surgery within a week of me, and two of them also have significant necrosis, excess growth, and a small/scarred aperture. this doesn’t seem like a coincidence to me, especially considering as necrosis is sometimes caused by tight sutures cutting off blood flow. i do not want to speak for them, however, as i know they feel quite differently about dr. mcginn than i do.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
recovery at home
</strong>
it took some time to be able to do basic things like shower, cook, and walk long distances again. after 4 weeks, i comfortably went back to my desk job full-time (from home bc covid). currently, my energy levels are normal and general pain is occasional/minimal. even with the complications, there is hardly anything too painful to do (besides dilation, ugh).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
sex
</strong>
yes, i am sensate. thank god my clit is fully intact and unproblematic. my libido has gone down a bit but it still is there, probably thanks to progesterone. but no, i haven’t orgasmed yet. i’ve felt like i’m super close though. i’m extremely tight so i‘m terrified of penetrative sex, but getting fingered is fun if we’re careful. i always bleed slightly when we do. oh and wow, the gender euphoria!!!
</p>
<p>
also the whole “you need to use a ton of lube since you can’t get wet” is kind of bullshit (based on my experience ofc). i am dripping wet when i get fingered w/o lube, to the point that i have to put a towel down lmao.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
cost
</strong>
$23,100 for surgery, hospital, and anesthesia. plus another $2,500 or so for travel accommodations. michigan medicaid refused to cover surgery or meds because she is out of state, even though SRS is a part of my plan. i didn’t become aware of the insurance denial until 3 weeks before surgery - after i had paid over half of my surgery, expecting for it to come back in a reimbursement. i had to take out long-term personal loans to help pay for everything.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
wait list
</strong>
i called in feb 2020, got an in person consult for the following week, at which point i put down a $3,500 deposit to schedule my surgery for june 2020.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
coronavirus
</strong>
my surgery date was unaffected by coronavirus, however there were two key policy changes: i flew into the area several days early to be tested (nasal swab not sinus), and was not allowed to have visitors in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
hair removal
</strong>
i did not do genital electrolysis/laser and have not had issues. but it also may be too early to tell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
stopping hormones
</strong>
i also did not stop hormones, which was dr. mcginn’s instruction. however this is not true of most of her patients.
</p>

So Did Mcginn do your second surgery for Necrosis?  So you can&#39;t fit the smallest dilator now?
</p>
<p>
Is it expected that with continued dilation the depth will come back?  I read about some girls raving about Mcginn and now I see your post. It seems so varied.

mcginn did not do my second surgery. and no, i can’t use even the smallest dilator due to the tight scarring :-/
</p>
<p>
i am not sure about how recovering the diameter and depth will look like (if possible at all) because mcginn won’t return my messages about these issues. dr. powers also is limiting the extent to which he is helping at this point in time because he is not a genital surgeon. thus far i have not seen vaginal size improve recently from dilating

If the diamiter is the issue you can order smaller diamiter dialators online from soul source to use and work up from there.

I thought you would have a scheduled follow up...  I would think you need to hunt her down and get examined about this!   Its good you still have sensation and orgasm.. You can probably work on getting the rest fixed...
