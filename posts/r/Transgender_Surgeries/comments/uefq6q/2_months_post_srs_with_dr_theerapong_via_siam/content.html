Im 2 months post colon vaginoplasty time flies. Where to begin at this stage everything is becoming a routine with dilation. I was told to dilate 40 mins twice a day or i can do it all at once for 1 hour and 20mins. I don&#39;t really have any pain down there just these shooting pains from time to time that don&#39;t last long which im assuming is nerves reconnecting i also had some numb spots on my labia down toward the opening that seem to be getting sensation back now. Swelling has gone down considerably she is tiny compared to a month ago.
</p>
<p>
At two months i can stop douching so i did 2 days ago so my vagina can get to a more normal ph. I still get discharge that is yellowish which is normal for colon at the beginning its the colon shedding old cells the color will change after sometime to clear or translucent i must say it already started to change color a bit and the discharge is not as much as it was at the beginning now one pantyliner can get me through a whole day i could go without too but i dont wanna stain my panties. As for the smell that is still there too but it goes away after sometime.
</p>
<p>
Below there are some pictures of her. 😸

Thank you 😊. Don&#39;t worry babe your time will come too one step at a time. When i first went on hormones 6 years ago if you asked me back then if i saw my self being able to get srs i would tell you absolutely not but here i am 6 years later being post op. The universe works in wonderful ways , never give up hope 😉.

Thanks for information!
</p>
<p>
Did you do electrolysis or laser epilation before the operation? Moreover, did your doctor ask for it?
</p>
<p>
Also, when were the catheters removed?

I was advised to either do electrolysis or laser because the dr doesnt perform follicle scraping.  I went with laser only because i chose colon vaginoplasty .
</p>
<p>
Edit : catheter was removed on day 5 basically at the time i was going to get discharged they removed the packing the catheter and the drain.

I&#39;ve seen you post a lot. I hope you don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but even as just a random person on the internet, I&#39;m slightly worried about you. This is obviously playing on your mind a lot, and it&#39;s totally understandable why, but maybe it would be a good idea to step away from this subreddit for a while? I&#39;ve worked in mental health before, and I think it would maybe be good for you to try to avoid surgery related spaces for a while. Maybe get your mind on some other things?
</p>
<p>
Just my two cents. Hope you&#39;re well.

Hi again. Thank you for sharing your story for me.
</p>
<p>
I do need to say, I don&#39;t have any results or outcome at all at this point. I&#39;m not affiliated with or trying to defend any doctor or whatever, I&#39;m just a little peer support worker out in the wild, spotting something that looks a teensy bit concerning.
</p>
<p>
See, our brains kind of run on stories. It&#39;s how they run. And the more we say something, write something, or read something, the more true it becomes to us. Ideas become entrenched digging deeper and deeper, and end up consuming more and more of our time and mental engery. Every time you write out a comment - and I&#39;ve checked it seems like you write then all out, not copy and paste - you&#39;re entrenching these thoughts deeper, making them more important to you. And that kind of increasing fixation and focus isn&#39;t healthy for anyone, let alone when it&#39;s about something on your body.
</p>
<p>
Surgery for anyone is pretty traumatic, and a surgery with a bad outcome, that you&#39;d placed so many hopes in, must be doubly so. Are you seeing anyone at the minute? I think you&#39;d really benefit from some trauma counselling. Might be something to look into?

You commented on my previous post a month ago the same exact thing. I understand the frustration but highly doubt dr Thee refused just because he couldn&#39;t bother fixing it. I know dr Thee performs revisions on girls who got botched from other surgeons iv seen some serious botched results from girls who went to another surgeon and dr Thee fixed them up. The thing is when it comes to revisions honest surgeons that don&#39;t just care about money can and will refuse to help if you go in with very high expectations a revision is not the same as the first surgery there is significantly way less tissue depending on the result from the initial surgery.

I know this post is a little old now, but do you mind if I ask why you went colon vs PPT? Dr Thee is at the top of my list as a surgeon atm, and your result is probably the best of his I’ve ever seen, especially after just 2 months!! Did he mention any impact on aesthetics / recovery / etc of colon vs ppt??
</p>
<p>
So happy for you!

I went with colon because dispite what we hear about ppt i saw people reporting depth loss not specifically girls from dr Thee but in general. I also feel like colon is much more thick ,elastic, muscular and durable.
</p>
<p>
As for the results i didnt ask if cosmetically it can look different depending on the technique but im guessing unless you have penile inversion the vulva should be the same regardless of colon or ppt.
</p>
<p>
I my labia has still a long road to go specifically the one side i am flattered that you think mine is one of the best.  I was very specific with what i wanted and went in with pictures showing him how long i wanted the labia how big i wanted the clit etc.

Makes total sense! Thank you!
</p>
<p>
With the requests, did you use photos of his own work, or natal gals? And what sort of specific things did you ask for? You got an incredible result
</p>
<p>
Sorry for all the questions!! Aesthetics is pretty much the only thing holding me back from dr thee (some of the examples on his site look… huge), but you have really given me hope!

Feel free to DM instead if it’s too weird for a public post 😅

I dont mind posting here as it would help others coming across my post.  Basically my issue was the same as yours i liked that he gave a juicy labia unlike all the other surgeons that give a thin pornstar labia which doesnt look natural but it was kinda too long for my liking so i found different results of his and i went in the consultation showing each picture to him and pointing the part which i wanted for example on one picture i told him i wanted my clit to look like this one , the other picture was pointing at the shape of the labia and another at the vaginal opening.  I was prepared prior to thailand and very specific with each part from the clitoris size to the hood , opening , labia minora.  I also told him that i wanted a shorter labia.  Ill send you the picture i used if you want. He also took the pictures to the operating room with him as a reference and went over what he will do with me as i was on the operating table before they put me under.

That is SO reassuring and helpful! Thank you so much! I’d heard he can take ‘requests’ but I was worried that his kind of default aesthetics (esp length and overall size like you mentioned) were due to skill rather than preference, but sounds like it’s the latter which is a big relief.
</p>
<p>
Yes I’d love to see the reference you used if possible :) I have a few examples from his results site bookmarked already but haven’t gone through them in too much detail yet. Thanks again!

Thanks for sharing this with us!! I just had mine done about 4 weeks ago, and I am definitely healing slow. I still got a lot of stitches, a lot swelling and a lot wounds that still bleed a lot. Which isn’t unexpected. Are you doing any specific exercises or something to that helps to heal faster? 😊😇🥰 thank you!!!

What i did is i advocated for my self to remain on estrogen during my surgery since im on injections so the risk for blood clots is as much as a cis woman having estrogen from her ovaries. I think remaining on estrogen helped immensely my healing and also the fact that i am 23 years old. During recovery also Cherry my nurse from Siam Transformative was visiting twice a day to clean my vagina and she always brought me cooked food from scratch and loads of fruits and water nothing processed.

Wow okay thank you. I’m glad you had a good team😊 How do you clean it? Like take shower or? Do you douche? I’m almost 4 weeks post-op and my vagina is super swollen can barely see my clitoris, labia or my vulva ): I dilate 30 minutes 3 times a day and take a shower twice daily. I don’t douche or anything.

I was told i can stop douching after dilation but i can still do it twice a week if i want to but to be honest i want to try let my vagina self clean and have a more normal ph so i wont be douching i douched today after a week just to see if my vagina had build up or anything but it didnt really so im gonna stop doing it.
</p>
<p>
In the shower i only clean the vulva i dont really put water in the vagina i just use only dove soap to clean between the lips and rinse with warm water.

Looks very good and quite similar to mine ☺️
</p>
<p>
I am very happy I found out about Dr. Thee and trusted him before going elsewhere. I read about 3 other women on this sub who went there in the past few month and met one of them in the hospital. All report to be happy with results, have no major complications and a very fast recovery with ability to orgasms within two months. His results seem to be really consistent and his technique seems to give an easier experience with dilation. I believe he has a special way of how he creates the entrance so that it is not too tight.

Yes im also glad i found him i was initially going to go to Suporn but im not sure i could take another year of genital dysphoria i feel like Dr Thee is even better than Suporn when it comes to aesthetics. I showed most of my female relatives and friends and they all were shocked with how good it looks especially being so early after recovery.
</p>
<p>
Also remained on estrogen during my surgery i presented data long before going to Thailand about how parenteral (gel , pellets , injections , patches) estrogen is not a risk for blood clots and is even detrimental to stop hrt for surgery and i was given the okay to stay on my injections which i feel like helped immensely with healing and not getting depressed badly after surgery.

I also really like his aesthetics but the big advantage over Suporn is the recovery (from what I heard). I think it&#39;s really incredible how well that goes. I am dilating only 15minutes daily now just two month post op. Switching to once daily did not make the dilation feel any more difficult. Life is pretty much getting normal now again. I also stayed on hormones and believe it helped me too.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if your dilation schedule is from Dr. Thee or from Siam Transformative? Because for me Dr. Thee just told me to do 10 min for one dilator and 15 min if I have time. It could of course be that things are different with colon, but I wouldn&#39;t think that colon needs a longer dilation time.

I was told by Siam Transformative 40 mins twice a day with the big dilator that applies to both ppt and colon but to be honest i sometimes do it once a day the colon is a tube anyway I can&#39;t really lose depth the dilation is mostly for the pelvic floor muscles and the scar tissue that connects the skin of the entrance and the colon.
</p>
<p>
Im wondering why they told me to dilate for longer.

I just wondered too why my schedule is shorter with PPT. I got mine from Dr Thee directly at the follow-ups. I am not with Siam Transformative but maybe they want to avoid any bad outcomes and add some extra duration for safety on top of the doctors orders, but who knows. I will stay at the once daily 15 minutes as long as I notice no tightening. Pelvic floor muscles don&#39;t seem to be an issue for me so far.

heyy, I am the &#34;one in the hospital&#34; girl
</p>
<p>
I have to admit that my recovery seems much slower that yours, I am still very swollen and my labia are pretty full (no swirls) and also I still bleed a tiny little sometimes
</p>
<p>
I am far away from switch to once a day as my dilation are hard and not easy at all. I mean they are not painful but I need to push very hard to get it in and I have to pull super hard to get it out
</p>
<p>
TODAY I BROKE MY WAX DILATOR while trying to keep it out because of the force I need to use...... it&#39;s very frustrating and demotivating because idk what is the problem as I don&#39;t feel any pain is just fucking tight
</p>
<p>
SIAMTRANSFORMATIVE told me that is position issue but I tried different positions and nothing change, they told me I was fine when Cherry dilate me back in Bangkok and that is true!! It really was easier then and very hard now.....so yes I am not going better, I am definitely going worse
</p>
<p>
At least I got nice sensitivity and I can orgasm consistently but this doesn&#39;t change the fact I can&#39;t still wear panties (too much swelling) or dilate just once a day (too tight) so my life is basically the same as it was 2 weeks post op

Oh, I am very sorry to hear that things are still not improving much for you 🙁 I am also not at 100% but definitely better every week. Do you have any doctor to check what still causes bleeding? I haven&#39;t had a single drop of blood since I am back from Thailand.
</p>
<p>
For the dilations have you tried some exercises? If you need to pull hard to get the dilator out it sounds like your muscles are very tense? I have met some other girls here who are post op and dilation is harder for most of them. One told me that going in a squat position helps to relax the pelvic floor. You could try that before dilation, stay there shortly to stretch a bit and breath. Like here:
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s2khIguKg-w" rel="nofollow">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s2khIguKg-w</a>
</p>
<p>
Are you sure about the panties? I think some compression can actually help to decrease the swelling, or is that too painful?
</p>
<p>
I wish I could help you more 💜

well it seems I don&#39;t have any choice besides to try this exercise
</p>
<p>
underwear are not painful but they just kinda touch my swollen labia and I was waiting the swelling to go down before wearing but I really don&#39;t know what to do anymore

I think touching is okay regarding swelling. As long as there is a wound leaving as much air as possible is good but after all open wounds are closed you can wear panties without problems, especially cotton ones. For some surgeries there is even special compression clothing against swelling.
</p>
<p>
Hope the exercise helps.
