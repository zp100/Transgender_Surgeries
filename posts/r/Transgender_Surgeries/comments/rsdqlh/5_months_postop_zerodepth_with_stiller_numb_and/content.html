<p>
I&#39;m a little over 5 months post-op now following my stage 1 zero-depth vaginoplasty that was supposed to precede a colovaginoplasty next year. I&#39;ll be making another post going over the surgery and results when I can bear it, but my biggest and most upsetting issue at the moment is numbness.
</p>
<p>
I want to stress that this is not numbness from the initial surgery. A month after my surgery, I had good sensation on almost all of my right labia and upper left labia and the areas around them. I also had great sensitivity around and in my clitoris and clitoral hood.
</p>
<p>
At 2.5 months, I had started playing with myself more casually as I was very sensitive and was able to orgasm with essentially no pain. At this point though, something happened that caused me to
<em>
lose
</em>
all sensation along both labia. I was very alarmed and worried, and asked Dr. Stiller specifically about it at my 3-month follow-up and he tried to reassure me that numbness was normal while healing, but no matter how clear I tried to make it, he seemed not to acknowledge that I&#39;d
<em>
lost
</em>
sensation recently following his post-op instructions and just acted like it was normal numbness from surgery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve tried doing as much research as possible online to find anyone else with this experience but there&#39;s no resource I could find that addressed losing sensation months after surgery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been trying to hope that the nerves regrow and reconnect but I haven&#39;t felt any of the &#34;pins and needles&#34; feeling that everyone seems to say indicates a regrowing nerve after injury and it&#39;s now been longer numb than it had sensation.
</p>
<p>
Worst of all, today I noticed that I&#39;d actually recently lost
<strong>
<em>
more
</em>
</strong>
sensation. I had to do some fairly strenuous hiking to the store a few days ago after a snow storm, and today when I was thinking of masturbating, I noticed the numbness has extended to include the entire length of both labia
<strong>
as well as the whole external area making up my clitoral hood
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m absolutely devastated. I feel as though I&#39;ve permanently crippled myself and I&#39;m only 29. It&#39;s incredibly difficult to get any information or support from Dr. Stiller&#39;s office and I had an appointment already scheduled for the 3rd to discuss my options with him but this new numbness has me just catatonic.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone else experienced anything like this following GRS? Is there any hope for me? What can I be doing to try and help my nerves repair!?

Ok, I commented on this, just 2 months before starting to have the same symptoms.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve LOST 90% of sensitivity on labia, perineum, clitoris and labia minora, and the canal.
</p>
<p>
Once it was like 95% sensation recovered, I LOST IT suddenly.
</p>
<p>
Since april 12th I can&#39;t feel the vulva anymore, just the upper labia and a tiny spot in clitoris/labia minora.
</p>
<p>
Pudendal nerve entrapment or PNE, or cauda equina syndrome CES, are possible causes of saddle aneesthesia. Due or not to surgery. It could be a tumor, infection, cysts, something that is compressing the nerves in the medula, or more deep in the pelvic floor hub of nerves &amp; muscles, etc. But it NEEDS to be diagnosed early with imaging and clinical studies.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m devastated also, as I was recovering inmensely well, dilations improved, my life improved, and from one day to another, LOST all that. I&#39;m not the same person, it changed negatively my life and relations, and I swear I screamed for help to gynecologists and other GP&#39;s and other cities&#39;s doctors.
</p>
<p>
Seems to be like an infection made it to the spine and affected the branch of nerves that gives sensation and motor function to legs, sphincters and pelvic floor muscles.
</p>
<p>
FYI, the surgeon Dr Belinky just said &#39;&#39;ah c´mon, now everything that happens to you must have to do with the surgery?&#39;&#39; among other DISGUSTING THINGS.
</p>
<p>
I only asked if it&#39;s possible to lost sensation AFTER it was almost completely recovered. Now I&#39;m into a burden of suicidal thoughts and losing money in studies, travels, no sleeping due to breathing changes, diaphragmatic issues, and bowel disfunctions (diarrea and no urge to poop). This talks about medular or peripheral nerve damage, now looking for peripheral, as medular was ruled out with MRI&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t cope with this, and being in solitude and abandonement from family and friends, jobless and glad I&#39;m not homeless, because I&#39;ll end up taking my life.
</p>
<p>
Some friend helps, some other helps with talks. Is not enough of network contention, and I fear not making it. I have no relatives to get some support.
</p>
<p>
Please someone who can give guide and orientation leave some comment, this is not common to happen, but it happens. I&#39;m in the edge, not receiving real help in my country, doctors delaying attention or taking this with a laugh, this is not right.
</p>
<p>
June 20:
<br>
Dorsolumbar (w/contrast) MRI in May, showed no compromise in that area, but still no test done on Sacral area where Pudendal nerve starts to branch to the genital or &#39;&#39;saddle&#39;&#39; region, yet no imaging/test on the inner abdominopelvic organs to discard a vascular, tumoral, infection or whatever pathology causing the numbness and weakness in pelvic floor &amp; legs, and diarrhea.
<br>
Two neurosurgeons avoided imaging the Sacral area, focused on lumbar, cervical, and told that they weren&#39;t familiarized with this type of surgeries and won&#39;t give opinion. Yet, they COULD ask, or guide me to other specialists.
</p>
<p>
Hopìng yet, to be a somatization as some doctors said, but there is no evidence based data to sustain that.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: corrections &amp; updates.

Your story is totally heartbreaking. I can&#39;t even imagine all the pain you&#39;re and have been going through, cause I myself have just started the journey of surgeries.
</p>
<p>

<p>
However I do can offer some chatting whenever you want. Feel free to hmu and I&#39;ll try to give you all support I can. Stay strong sis, keep fighting. Kisses.

Hi, only a small spot of numbness in labia minora and introitus. The rest subsided and sensation came back a little.
</p>
<p>
All the other symptoms improved till complete subsiding along the months. A neurosurgeon told me to test for some vascular issue following this major surgery. I don&#39;t buy that, and point to a nerve compression (pudendal nerve, genitofemoral nerve, etc) creating the symptoms.

I am so sorry your surgery outcome and recovery have taken this turn. I&#39;ve had my own struggles with similar aspects of what your describing including the nerve damage. It&#39;s hard to get anyone to understand the full details and impact of what you lose. The worst part is being told, for me anyway, that doing more surgery will only risk further damage. Hopefully this hasn&#39;t impacted your ability to urinate or control your bladder like it did mine. Because that sucks too.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if you have reached out for a 2nd opinion or not, but it might be worth a try. I&#39;ve seen no less than 3 different Urologist as of now. Same result. You may find someone with a better idea of what&#39;s wrong, but because Stiller hasn&#39;t. Another issue is time. Despite having very little sensation in my vulva or labia, there have been other areas, my breast for instance where the feeling took a year to come back. But...it did.
</p>
<p>
We aren&#39;t the first to be in this situation and we won&#39;t be the last, but it&#39;s not the end of the world. I know at least one person on this sub (Hannah Simpson)  who done extensive investigation on repairing nerve damage after her experience. She&#39;s been all over the world seeking the right people. Last time she chimed in here, she mentioned that she was scheduled for surgery. I hope she has had some success. I am sure if you reached out to her she would be a wealth of information.
</p>
<p>
There are options worth seeking on these nerve issues even though getting yourself out of the doomsday mindset and depression. It really is that debilitating. Many of us have been through it and it&#39;s often the most difficult part of the recovery. My heart goes out to you, but you still have work to do.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to reach out

Thanks Emma, but did you had regained sensation after surgery, and THEN lost it again? Or I misunderstood that? Belinky suggested checking glucemia because &#34;could be diabetes or low vitamins etc&#34;. Nothing wrong with the rectal abscess? Why I feel that bump tenderness in the rectum still at 7 months?
</p>
<p>
Other surgeon who&#39;s urologist, is more interested in this result and he offered another neurosurgeon team give 2nd opinion on next MRI. Hours back another surgeon told me that this is far away from surgery complications. But he hasn&#39;t asked for more elements to give a detailed opinion...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m concerned about leg weakness, diarrhea together with numbness in vulva, canal.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t help myself anymore as my 2 friends don&#39;t talk back anymore in this moment. So I&#39;m asking other people with the risk of losing time and health.

I did not lose it in the same way, It never came back for the most part. I have decent sensation in my clitoris, but even that is diminished some. Unfortunately the nerves that are impacted were deeper and effect my bladder and more in that area.
</p>
<p>
Just knowing how this all works, it seems feasible to be that your nerves may have been to separated some how. Perhaps by cliff diving, or something else, and they became separated causing the problem. It sounds like it happened quickly. Nerves take a long time to repair themselves, so @ 5 months, it&#39;s possible you will gradually get that sensation back over the next 6 months. I&#39;m totally speculating here, I&#39;m not a doctor, I&#39;m just another lab specimen that can communicate.

Oh, that&#39;s different.
</p>
<p>
I had complete sensation back, felt great, then lost it again.
<br>
Didn&#39;t exercised or physical effort to do any damage, I was very cautious on movements, walking just fine, no running, no lifting, no jumping, etc.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to lose faith but something says to me that it&#39;ll  never come back. And my legs are weak, bowel hypotonicity and difficult sleep due to the diaphragm being affected also...lots of things creating a loop that feels dangerous.

It sounds dangerous when having noticeable problems with your diaphragm. You need professional medical advice, wherever that needs to come from, so they will take you seriously or provide an explanation. Do they not see this as an issue? It&#39;s obvious you aren&#39;t getting satisfying answers from your care team. This basically leaves you with three options, Demand better answers from them, get a second opinion from another surgeon or do nothing and hope that it resolves itself.
</p>
<p>
One more option, depending on your insurance company. You may have access to resources online like a virtual nurse, physician or case manager. Connect them and explain what&#39;s going on and see if they can make connections and get answers. Anthem was a huge help in this regard with my breast issues.

They said &#39;&#39;it&#39;s a somatization, you&#39;re stressed&#39;&#39; and that&#39;s all.
</p>
<p>
The GP and psychiatrist I&#39;ve seen days ago just laughed as if it&#39;s no big deal &#39;&#39;oh, you&#39;re better than me, look my neck&#39;&#39;, just horrible.

I totally feel for you. Sometimes their indifference is crushing. So what do you do? I see your dilemma. I remember so many times complaint about issues and hearing &#34;just give it time&#34;. Ugh.
</p>
<p>
But ok, this is the reality you&#39;re in. They still have a better understanding and more insight into you and your surgery recover than we can. If it was anxiety causing the breathing problems you wouldn&#39;t be the first person by any stretch to have this issue. I remember the 2nd night in the hospital after bottom surgery, feeling completely abandoned. I had a severe panic attack the literally paralyzed me and I could not bring myself out of it. It even shut down the flow to my catheter. I honestly thought that was it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m only bringing that up because it demonstrates just how powerful anxiety and panic can physically effect the body causing serious, but in most cases, temporary physical impacts. That was the first and only panic attack I have had to this day. To that I say, only a fool willingly underestimates how invasive and how much trauma this surgery places on the body and the mind.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really not trying to go all woo on you but meditation might be worth a try. There are some good phone apps for guided and personalized meditation.

This is just speculation (though based on some experience as a Holistic Practitioner)...but acupuncture and chiropractic might well help with the sexual response. I haven&#39;t had this surgery yet, but--in my case--these two (with supplements) have REALLY helped in that &#34;department.&#34; They might well speed the healing, as well.

I also have cervical spondylolisthesis, a protrusion that&#39;s surely causing breathing difficulties. Also lumbar protuberance, or internal infection/tumor that reached the spine. But if infection, it should present with fever and other symptoms.  And if tumor, can&#39;t believe symptoms appeared suddenly in few days.
</p>
<p>
I had sciatic pain for 3 years, and right after SRS, it disappeared completely. I had that leg pain the day of surgery. Then it ended completely. Then this?....
</p>
<p>
I can not notice that is surgery related... Something explains why dr Belinky was SO CRAZY AGGRESSIVE when I referred the sharp shoulder pain that his team never addressed, the abnormal edema/rectal lump, and then his gaslighter sending a psychiatrist to my hotel claiming &#34;it&#39;s all in your head, your crazy, you&#39;re mentally ill, ok?&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Is there any need to behave and act like this? So much in defensive mode, if he did nothing wrong with body and health?

First of all, I&#39;m sorry to hear what problems you have. Your description of the problems made me think spontaneously of my own numbness and sensitivity disorders, these come from a neurological disease and have actually also occurred in the genital area. It is strange to me that they felt so good at the beginning and the numbness only came afterwards.

I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through this, I feel your anguish and vacuum. What were exactly the post-op instructions?
</p>

Guessing, it can be a pinched nerve. electromyography needed. Google &#34;How Long Does a Pinched Nerve Last?&#34; And similar searches. Maybe there is an underlying process that&#39;s pinching a major nerve. But I&#39;m assuming.

Any updates from this .I am 3 months post up with the same surgery and surgeon. I am not feeling anything but I&#39;ve had a few wet dreams. Stiller also seems very dismissive about it I&#39;m our 3 months follow up. I&#39;m worried I feel like I cannot actually trust him .
