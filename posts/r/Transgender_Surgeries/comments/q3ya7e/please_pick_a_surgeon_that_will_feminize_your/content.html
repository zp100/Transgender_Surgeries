Not OP, but going by post history/having seen her share her story I think she got work done with Dr. Keojampa.
</p>
<p>
OP, Iâ€™m really sorry this happened to you. I really hope you can get this revised and get a result you want.

OPâ€™s post history indicates it was Dr Keojampa. He has been doing FFS for quite a while and has a lot of happy patients so Iâ€™m surprised at the unsatisfactory result. /shrug. I guess every surgeon has bad results sometimes.

What do you mean &#34;shrug&#34; why not just say who cares. I think it is interesting that you went in on Jumaily on a tirade but here it is &#34;shrug&#34;. Who do you work for?

Yeah, Iâ€™m done with the trans community on Reddit. So incredibly toxic. This will be my last post ever.

it so true they are more worried about dave chapelle than being botched. It is because trans people don&#39;t really give a damn about each other and for sure do not care if you are not a white person.

Is jumaily doing a revision too? I feel like a brow lift would help open up your eyes too

Hi thank you , you are so right a brow lift would help, it was supposed to have been done and wasnt :(
</p>
<p>
I wish I could but I don&#39;t have that money, Jumaily already fixed the trachea and the chin. Now even the forehead has to be redone. Maybe can do it in India or somewhere more affordable.  i don&#39;t know what to do honestly its all been too much. opening my forehead again seems like such a energy draining nightmare .

I think itâ€™s extremely malicious and harmful that you would throw his name out like that with no evidence whatsoever to support your slander of his reputation. Turns out the OPâ€™s surgeon was not Dr Z but actually Dr Keojampa.

Why? dr. Z uses dated techniques and has botched many girls. Including having a patient die while heâ€™s out operating. He deserves the slander. Who do you work for?
