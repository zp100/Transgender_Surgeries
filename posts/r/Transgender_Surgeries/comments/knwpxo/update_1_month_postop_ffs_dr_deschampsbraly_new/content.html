Hello again! 1 month update from my last post

General Thoughts &amp; Recommendations

<p>
<strong>
updates:
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Speaking is still challenging. My throat is still slightly sore, probably from mouth breathing. Soreness and numbness all over my face has improved considerably, but not having full motor control over your lips and mouth and jaw and whatnot makes speaking hard. I&#39;d say I&#39;m somewhere around 2/3 recovered with this. Speaking for extended periods of time can be tiring.
</li>
<li>
I had really hoped my nose-breathing would be better by now. It&#39;s healing slowly, and I&#39;m still waiting for the humidifier I ordered. I take a lot of steamy baths and showers, which helps with breathing, but is not so great for inflammation.
</li>
<li>
Inflammation and bruising has subsided considerably! I still have slight inflammation around my cheeks, and a moderate amount below my chin and throughout my nose, especially the tip.
</li>
<li>
Sensation is returning to numb areas slowly but surely. My chin and parts of my forehead and areas around my scars on the top of my head are still very numb.
</li>
<li>
I can chew soft food quite well now, but I absolutely cannot chew anything tough. I think it&#39;s going to be at least few more weeks before I really attempt that.
</li>
<li>
My energy levels are improving, but I&#39;m still quite tired much of the time.
</li>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bring/acquire a humidifier!
<ul>
<li>
Dry mouth and throat and all the side effects of this were AWFUL. Far, far worse than I expected.
</li>
<li>
Hard candies or cough drops are a great idea for helping distract yourself and keep your mouth wet. I figured this out later than I would have liked.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Soylent is the way to go
<ul>
<li>
My attempts at blending savory &#34;meals&#34; were mostly failures. I often augmented my Soylent with fruits, veggies, and supplement powders.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
If you&#39;re traveling,
<strong>
<em>
pack light
</em>
</strong>
. Bring zip/button tops and/or tops with wide collars.
<ul>
<li>
I basically ended up wearing fewer than 3 outfits over the course of nearly 2 weeks.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I really wish I had a boba straw for the first week!
<ul>
<li>
Even 10 days out, my lips are still sore and numb, and hard to use, especially for eating &amp; drinking.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I found sleeping, walking, and watching TV to be the best activities during the first week.
<ul>
<li>
Reading, writing, and video gamesâ€”for whatever reasonsâ€”were less appealing.

What was the dry mouth due to? The after effects of the lip lift? Also the lack of closing mouth is as a result of the lip lift? You look fantastic already btw!

Mostly due to frequently being unable to breathe through my nose, especially at night.

Hey, congrats, your face passes 100% I have a few questions:
</p>
<p>
Where is the scar from the tracheal shave procedure? Did you ask him for a cat-eye browlift or is it just swelling? Did he shave your frontal sinus + orbital rims? Did he rounded your forehead or just swelling?
</p>
<p>
Thank you ðŸ’‹

thanks!
</p>
<p>
I did not ask for a cat-eye browlift. I&#39;ve never heard of that, though I think I can guess what it is.
</p>
<p>
My front sinus was definitely shaved as part of the forehead contouring. I&#39;m not 100% sure about orbital rims, but I think they were.
</p>
<p>
There was definitely still some swelling at 1 month, but it seems to be mostly subsided now (5 months post op). I posted again with an updated photo.
