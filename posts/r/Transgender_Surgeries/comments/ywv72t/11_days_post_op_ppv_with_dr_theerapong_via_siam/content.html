I&#39;m a 38 year old trans woman from Australia (Melbourne specifically) and recently decided to go with PPV lacroscopic (keyhole) surgery with Dr Theerapong in Thailand. I also decided to go with Siam Transformative to help coordinate the entire trip.
</p>
<p>
Tl/dr summary of experiences and tips:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I am very happy with Dr Theerapong&#39;s work. Highly recommend him and PPV.
</li>
<li>
Being in Thai hospitals without speaking Thai is hard. Ideally have a partner/family/a friend with you for the last couple of days of your stay in hospital itself minimum (more time they&#39;re on hand to be there with you the better).
</li>
<li>
Make sure you have a partner/family/friend to stay near you (but not in the same room as you) for the first 7 days after you leave hospital (longer is better).
</li>
<li>
Siam Transformative are worth their weight in gold. If you go with Dr Theerapong make sure you go with them and pay for the extra 10 days nursing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Long format rambling style:
</p>
<p>
I did a lot of research. I was extremely hesitant to get an operation outside of Australia in a country where I don&#39;t speak the language. I was worried about scams, substandard quality of work, complications that might arise afterwards, etc, etc. While it&#39;s too early to talk about future complications, thus far there have been none and despite some very challenging circumstances it&#39;s been extremely smooth.
</p>
<p>
I was unable to secure a psychiatrists letter before coming here (had organised a series of appointments, got covid and then by the time I recovered the psychiatrist was no longer available). Siam seamlessly slotted me in with a second psychiatrist in Bangkok. Siam also facilitated getting accommodation for my parents who ended up coming for 1 week to support me during my post op phase.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very fussy with accommodation and was very anxious about the quality of accommodation Siam Transformative would book. Its definitely adequate for the circumstances (especially given I&#39;m bed bound the whole time since my operation). I&#39;ve stayed at places before where I felt uncomfortable. That is not the case here.
</p>
<p>
My doctor did get ill the day before my surgery. He was immediately hospitalised as a precaution but I was worried he&#39;d be there for 2 weeks. My surgery was postponed by 4 or so days (and I was the second surgery he did post covid which meant i knew he was 100% fit to return to surgery).
</p>
<p>
My parents got here 3 days before I left hospital and thank God they did because being surrounded by nurses who didn&#39;t speak English was driving me crazy.
</p>
<p>
Siam Transformative has 3 (probably cis) women as the driving force behind it from what I&#39;ve seen. One of them you&#39;ll deal with 99% of the time before arriving in Bangkok. The Second you&#39;ll deal with 99% before surgery and on the day you leave hospital. 3rd one you deal with 99% of the time after you&#39;ve left hospital.
</p>
<p>
I went with Siam instead of Interplast directly as I&#39;d heard Interplast can have communication issues. I&#39;ve had zero communication issues with Siam. At least one is American born and lived so communicating in English has not been a concern.
</p>
<p>
Moreover I get attended to twice a day by a nurse (one of the 3 aforementioned women). She dilates me, reviews the condition of my wounds from the surgery, removes stitches as appropriate and cleans me. I haven&#39;t showered since the day I was admitted into hospital due to energy levels and have been assured that (a) the lack of showering has had no impact on my vagina (b) I am not being unhygienic and my rest is more important at this stage. I have also gone unshaven that same time. Despite my nurse being cis at no point have I felt unfeminine or uncomfortable in front of her.
</p>
<p>
They provide a douche, Lubricant and dilators. I couldn&#39;t bring my own dilators so using theirs for now. They admit the quality is lacking and had recommended I get my own.
</p>
<p>
A couple of post surgery photos are here (TW: they&#39;re not pretty but do show my new vagina and im very proud of it):
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/ztlUh08">https://imgur.com/a/ztlUh08
</a>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to answer questions as I have the energy to if anyone wants to ask them of me. Prices are best asked of Siam. But overall I budgeted approximately $36k AUD on electrolysis, flights, clothes for tge trip, etc. I had some left over that I spent on sight seeing/clubbing pre-surgery but all up I spent approximately $30k AUD.

Theerapong girl here too via Siam ... congratulations on surgery yeah the girls at Siam have been very helpful and patient with me as i was very anxious with planning to travel and all that stuff that involved having surgery abroad. I felt very comfortable with them so im not surprised that you feel comfortable with them too.

Hey 👋
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your recent post. I saw it the day my surgery was delayed and was very helpful for me to read on that day.
</p>
<p>
I was fortunately not anxious. A bit naive on how independent I&#39;d be poorly surgery though. They&#39;ve really stepped up though.

I have three questions: What made you choose Dr. Teerapong over other doctors? What made you choose the PPT technique over the sigmoid colon technique? How is your vaginal depth?

<p>
My vaginal depth is currently 6 inches. My research tells me i can expect to lose some of that though (my goal was for cis results which is typically 4-6 inches based on my research). It&#39;s possible I actually have a little more depth. My nurse wants to reach the vaginal wall but not stretch it and its hard fir me to interpret that point. I consistently take 6 inches though and am happy to have that as my starting point.
</p>
<p>
Sidenote: Dr Theerapong starts his patients on the &#34;medium size&#34; of dilators and today I went up to the &#34;large size&#34;. I do not intend to go any further.
</p>
<p>
For why I chose ppv, I&#39;m going to explain why I ruled out the other methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Penile inversion technique: I&#39;ve heard this gives heightened sensitivity over other techniques because it uses the foreskin internally. I&#39;ve also read it gives far more sensitivity (when done well. Ymmv of course) compared with cis women. This plus minor lubrication concerns made me rule out this technique (I wanted as close to cis results as possible).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Suporn/Chettawutt/et al technique: I&#39;ve heard if recovery for ppv is 3 months then this is 12 months. I couldn&#39;t commit to that. I&#39;ve also heard revisions are very frequently needed (this is by design with suporn, chettawutt I&#39;ve heard is hesitant to give revisions). I also had concerns for failure rate (I&#39;ve heard it happens more then I was comfortable with from multiple sources).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Sigmoid colon: I&#39;ll be honest. I had concerns about smell. I&#39;ve since been informed this concerns were ill placed and no smell lingers (with Theerapong at least) beyond 12 months as an absolute outer limit (far more often it goes much sooner). But it was the stigma around smell that made me avoid it. I&#39;ve since recovery for sigmoid is mote difficult compared with ppv and your diet is far more restricted with sigmoid, but these did not come into my consideration as I was unaware of them (and have not independently validated these claims. But I do trust the source).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
PPV: it was mostly ruling out the other techniques that made me choose this one. I was attracted to the fact self lubrication can sometimes occur more easily (but I was also wary of over lubrication when not aroused being an issue). Mostly I ruled out the other techniques. The fact some form of ppv (I believe) has been done on cis women for decades did make me more positively inclined to this technique. But it wasn&#39;t a major factor.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once I chose PPV I searched for all Australian and Thai doctors who performed this technique. I could find information on 3 names. The Australian doctor I was concerned had less experience compared with Thai doctors. So the two main names I had who seed to offer the simplest experience of getting here, getting surgery, recovering and going home were Kamal and Dr Theerapong.
</p>
<p>
Kamals shenanigans on this forum plus persistent rumours of dodgy practices plus the accommodation potentially not being hygienic turned me off him.
</p>
<p>
So why Dr Theerapong?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I found a site (no longer have the link unfortunately) that had a gallery of like 10 years of his work. His earlier work didn&#39;t look great tbh. Definitely when compared with his newer work. But the fact i could see such a long timespan of his work and see myself how hos technique has changed and improved filled me with such confidence.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Information about from him English sources was sparse but always positive (unlike Kamol). Consistently I kept hearing he&#39;s very popular with Thai girls though. This helped me have some confidence in his work.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The fact Siam Transformative existed. I could speak with native English speakers. Send them money and let them organise everything including transportation for me everywhere and for my parents when travelling to and from the airport, accommodation, etc. It just meant I could throw at them and they&#39;d take care of the logistics for me. I imagine plenty of companies offer this but the fact they seemed closely tied with a reputable surgeon made me want to use them. A unique point of theirs was tbe optional 10 extra days nursing (I think I&#39;ll end up only getting to use 9 out of those extra 10 days but regardless I have nursing care until the plane leaves) and also the fact the nurse is twice a day, nit once a day, seemed something extra they provided that few others do.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The fact I could get the surgery this year was huge.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ultimately I&#39;d researched the hell out of all the options (using this site and other resources). Eventually I just had to stop researching and make a decision. So I did so.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Was there a potentially a better technique or surgeon? Definitely. But this is the information I had uncovered and so the information I used. Some of it might be wrong. But it&#39;s what I had to go off.
</p>
<p>
Apologies if this was an overexplain

I tried to provide a caption. But first was from day 6 post surgery. Second was day 8. I&#39;m currently at day 11 (if my maths is right).
</p>
<p>
Why do you ask?

Fun fact: I have phimosis.
</p>
<p>
I did not volunteer this ahead of time to the surgeon and as a result I was anxious fir months it might affect my results (but I didn&#39;t think it would stop the surgery).
</p>
<p>
Surgeon spotted it instantly of course and asked &#34;so your head has never been exposed?&#34; I confirmed it hadn&#39;t, he said &#34;that&#39;s good.&#34;
</p>
<p>
My clitoris is very sensitive now though (unsure if related or not).
</p>
<p>
Not revealing everything ahead of time was silly. But I just didn&#39;t think of it until 3 months before the surgery at which point it seemed too late.

Hey! The photos are long gone, how was the final results?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going in June with Interplast, their communication is quick but I do see your point about having access to native English speakers.
