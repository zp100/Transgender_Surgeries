To those considering surgery with Lazaro Cardenas:
</p>
<p>
My experience with this office has been largely terrible.  I was not asked to provide any authorization letter from a therapist or virtual simulations of my face and no simulations were made.  I wished to arrive a full day early to have more time for the consultations but his assistant insisted that arriving the afternoon before would be better.  I should not have listened.  Cardenas offhandedly expressed concern about a procedure in an exchange that went like this
</p>
<p>
Dr. C: &#34;In FFS, we can stretch the face upwards or downwards.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Myself: &#34;Won&#39;t that make my face taller?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Dr. C: &#34;No, features aren&#39;t what contributes to the height of the face.  We can do the incision (describes three different ways, two of which pull the face and hairline down, one of which pulls the face up).  It&#39;s possible some hair will fall out during the incision.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Myself: &#34;Well I don&#39;t want that.  Let&#39;s do it the other way.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Dr. C: &#34;Alright, most women want it done the other way, but...*quickly changes subject*&#34;
</p>
<p>
he provided basically no post-op instructions, was very difficult to reach, and his nurses were largely very impatient with us.  his work is not bad but he communicated very poorly.  I have heard that he is a conservative surgeon and talks patients out of procedures he feels they don&#39;t need, but this is absolutely not my experience.  My breasts are also a lot higher-profile than the reference I provided, but you&#39;ll have to take my word for that, and now my favorite punk jacket doesn&#39;t fit.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
Cardenas&#39;s work is alright if you can&#39;t afford anything else, but please understand you&#39;re getting what you pay for and expect basically no post-op care as part of your package.  This is the curbside pickup of plastic surgeries.

I agree with this. I&#39;m pleased with the results and can&#39;t thank him enough for changing my life. But the surgery was rushed and the hospital recovery was a nightmare. The aftercare? I saw him once after the surgery for ten minutes. His colleague removed the staples and most of the stitches. He then showed me how to tape my nose. That was it!.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been about a month and my wife has removed three more stitches since then.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m posting this in the hope that someone on his staff sees this. Surgery like this can be very traumatic. Taking the time to properly communicate with your patients, following up on aftercare, just making sure your patients are happy, those things are important.
</p>
<p>
Again, Dr. Cardenas is very talented, but my memories of the whole thing are not pleasant.

I&#39;m really happy. No, HRT softened my features and my body, but I didn&#39;t pass. But since the surgery I haven&#39;t been called sir once. My voice keeps clocking me but I&#39;m working on it. Once I figure out how to post pictures with text I&#39;ll put some up.

Are you saying he gave you a lower hairline when you didn&#39;t ask for it at all ?

no, he raised my hairline because he stretched my face upwards so that my features sat higher on my face.  I wanted him to lower my face, which would have lowered my hairline, but I wanted him to make the incision under the chin to reduce the risk of hair loss.  He misunderstood what I said and did not correct me.

Ohhh okay had to ask because in the after picture it looks like your forehead is smaller. I understand like you didn&#39;t want the scar but I believe that&#39;s the only way to lower/raise a hairline tho ?

yeah it just made my face seem very tall is all and it wasn&#39;t what I asked for.  Again, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s bad at surgery, I think he&#39;s bad at being an FFS surgeon because he doesn&#39;t really care if his combined efforts will help you pass or not.  If you go to him, bring reference pictures for *everything* and do not let him postpone your consultation (he did this for me during the video consult).  He rushes things and is very cavalier about it.  Also he hates doing Type III foreheads, and will probably tell you you only need Type I, even if you really do need Type III.
