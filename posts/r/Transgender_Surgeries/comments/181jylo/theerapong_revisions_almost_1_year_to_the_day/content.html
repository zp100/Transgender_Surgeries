The communication was all caused by a greedy ground “0” person treating this Surgery like I was going to the Dentist for a filling - first named starting with a “Becky” - The old Siam Transformative has disbanded almost a year ago “B” was taking patient money for personal use but grew up in THAILAND and learned read and write Thai - She’s a lying scammer and what was said to Theerapong I’ll never know other than I’m Blacklisted basically - I have a Tunmy tuck 2 ft long scar 1 1/2 inches higher on my right side compared  to my left side - just Fk’d up surgery using the same opening to access my Colon - are they kidding! Really- it’s not hidden below- that whole place is Fk!d up quite frankly - there’s more !!!!

That&#39;s why ST was dissolved in the first place. She&#39;s a greedy scam artist. I&#39;m sorry this happened to you. Don&#39;t be afraid to tell the truth. The community has the right to know

Originally many months before I dealt with ST which was technically great - Interplast as a clinic does have a person who reads and writes English for communication back and forth if just dealing with the clinic separately from the original ST .
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the ground “0” person named “Becky ” when I was 1 st picked up from the Airport there was a sense of something not quite right but I went with the flow anyways to get the deed done for revisions with Dr. Theerapong - when I left 30 days later  I felt very unfinished and not satisfied - The other person running “ST” was not the problem but the greed of the one named  “Becky ” became apparent to me early on - for a short period of time “ST” were trying to protect the basics of running a Service Business so I had a falling out initially after going home and was forced to deal with Interplast on my own Via email to Interplast - I’m not a diplomatic person in anyway and my 1 st email sent to Interplast was answered and told it would be forwarded to Dr. Theerapong and it was explicit I won’t lie with images and my being pissed off ! - North Americans are blunt people compared to Asian Culture  , we say and are point hard and this scenario creates the “Saving Face “ problem with a culture being insulted .
</p>
<p>
I realized early January 2023 “ST” had disbanded and struck up communication again ( for a time I was on their sh#t list also but ? ) with the other partner and through many dialogs of FB messaging we were on the same legit page about issues caused by this person named “Becky ” the  ex partner involved causing trouble for anyone at the time getting surgery with Dr. Theerapong pilfering money for personal greed/needs !
</p>
<p>
Dr. Theerapong tells the staff at Interplast in reality whether he will deal with a person or not “ He’s the Man “ “ The Boss “ and my problem comes in with what was said to the doctor in Thai language communicated from “Becky ”  because of “Becky&#39;s&#34; shear greed and it’s one of the reasons I never got a one on one consult chat and explained to me the surgical procedure involved , obviously “Becky ” didn’t want too much said encase I might back out of the surgery and go home ? - only a “fool” like myself or anyone has to expect a proper consult for a serious Sigmoid Vaginoplasty but I went with the flow anyways and as you can see this is what happens post op aesthetically without proper communication because a person just wanted me officially in Hospital to secure profits for her self personally .
</p>
<p>
I’ve paid the price with my emails etc. to Interplast on these problems I went through because of a Greedy person at “ST” - this person is now out of the Picture for good  and future patients won’t ever have to go through what I went through .
</p>
<p>
My answer is long unfortunately but “Yes” I did communicate initially with Interplast post op and got no were all of 2023 trying and if they think your aggressive they’ll Ghost you hard core like I got being Ghosted  from them ! This is what a doctor does when to show their power they have bottom line !
</p>
<p>
A person won’t have problems dealing with the Original Partner of “ST” who runs a new proper business ( Amani ) less the the greedy one “Becky ” Ha ! — All is good for future patients really with Amani going to Bangkok - I’m the one on the Sh#t list I guess with Dr. Theerapong ? but I tell it honestly for others  to make proper decisions - I’m the one that paid the price post op because of my old guard North American Diplomacy ways I don’t have !     And I’ll add I’m vintage as hell and almost 66 years old , been around the world to be me and say my piece on issues and problems being a Transwoman/woman !

well, don&#39;t know about revision surgeries, but I&#39;m going with Dr. Theerapong for my first and probably only surgery.
</p>
<p>
I guess best surgeons do still mess up sometimes 😔. Really sorry this happened to you.
</p>
<p>
Interplast always responds to me, the biggest delay in answering was almost 24 hours, probably preparing the best answer because they always answer in one message with all the information. I do get a little &#34;read&#34; notifier in less than an hour unless I message very late.

I’m considering him for next year. They also responded quickly to enquiry, even with the 12 hour time difference. Can you let me know your feelings after surgery, I’ll factor that in.

Doesn’t look like anything substantial was done externally at all, some very minor adjustment.

Read Carefully here,  explains the issues I dealt with on my Website  (
<a href="https://Siamtransformation.com/" rel="nofollow">https://Siamtransformation.com/
</a>
) all caused by 2 greedy assholes and lots of money spent to end up with a second mess and being Blacklisted by Interplast !!!!!
