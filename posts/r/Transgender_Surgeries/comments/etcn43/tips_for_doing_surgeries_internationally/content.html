It‚Äôs not really for rich people.. Global entry and battery banks are something a vast majority of citizens have.... especially for people that have to travel for work...  but yeah I did start off by saying I‚Äôm from the U.S ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
Also I don‚Äôt agree with checking a box saying you need assistance unless you actually do... by the time you leave most people can walk by themselves.... I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs morally right using that service

I know, I used to be privately health insured and now am on National Health Insurance. It is so appaling due to the Dr shortage here (brain drain lots emigrating). I even can&#39;t get a dermatologist appt under 3 months waiting list, so I am paying a private one 50+ Euros to check for skin cancer.

‚Å†You should check with the airlines if you&#39;re allowed to charge your devices onboard. Most flights I&#39;ve been on (across EU) didn&#39;t allow charging onboard and didn&#39;t allow powerbanks onboard larger than 10,000mAh (which is what I exactly have).

<p>
Idk about powerbank policies, mine is 10,000mAh which I didn‚Äôt have a problem with and let me charge my switch and phone to full 3/4 times which lasted the entire flight and more

<p>
Business class tickets are definitely worth it for international tickets on the flight back IMHO. Depending on the airline If it‚Äôs more then 10+ hours you‚Äôre getting a seat that reclines fully into a bed, quick service, uncramped access to the bathroom if you need it.  I also know

surgeons do recommend business or first class tickets when traveling home after surgery. It‚Äôs possible to do standard..... but it‚Äôs gonna be a hellish 10+ hour flight

<p>
I did a consult in Thailand last summer for SRS.  Netflix worked but not all the shows that were available in the U.S worked in Thailand... I think it‚Äôs licensing.. Netflix distributes shows based on geographic location.

When I went to Spain for FFS pandora didn‚Äôt work... that‚Äôs actually what made me finally switch to Spotify

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yeah WiFi is good.. but personally I‚Äôd want the ability to call someone from anywhere if I‚Äôm in a country I‚Äôve never been in before. I bought a Temporary SIM card in Thailand. It was $10 USD for a week of full LTE/3G unlimited data. I‚Äôm not sure about Spain since I did an international plan for that and it wasn‚Äôt worth it at all.. it cost me like $300 for 10GB of data and then it was 20$ per 1GB

Thanks for the information üòä I looked up the Kamol Clinic in Thailand in the internet. I want Top Surgery and it takes years where I live. Also the clinic doesn&#39;t require any approval letters (F64. 0 diagnosis) for Top surgery. They quote a price of 4000 USD which I am saving up for. Do you know if the Kamol clinic is good? Which one are you having GCS at if I may ask?

Yeah I went over to Thailand last summer and consulted with a bunch of the major SRS surgeons like Suporn, Chett, Kamol ect.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt want discourage you... but tbh out of everyone I saw Kamol was the worst consult... this wasn‚Äôt for top surgery though.. it was only for GRS
</p>
<p>
The doctor was rude the entire time... he refused to answer some of my questions. I asked to see some post-op results and he didn‚Äôt let me see them. He also said my depth would only be 3inches and I wanted more.
</p>
<p>
They also use the penile inversion method... which wasn‚Äôt what I was interested in.. as the entire reason Thailand was at the top of my list was the non-penile inversion..
</p>
<p>
Chettewut gave the best consultation, he let me see results and I felt like he was very knowledgeable. So I‚Äôm going with him. Suporn and his team had the next best consult... but IMO the location is kind of annoying. With Chett you‚Äôll be in Bangkok.. but Suporns clinic is an hour outside of Bangkok in a small town

Thanks so much for the Infos. Didn&#39;t a trans woman on Reddit post that Suporn is retiring? The pull down method is the best, plus more depth. I will check out Chettewut, Kamol did have a few before and after pics of Top surgery but I am terrified of it getting botched. Although anything down below is way more serious. When I inherit I will emigrate to Thailand or a transgender town in California lol.

They offer 3 techniques : PI, full graft and colon methods. Did you specify that you would like the full graft method ?
</p>
<p>
Sorry to hear you didn&#39;t have a good experience with them.

Both  the consultations were good, and they both offered a good amount of depth and aesthetics that the NPI method is known for.
</p>
<p>
Suporn went into more detail but he said that his college Dr.Banks or his team would be the one doing the surgery. With Chett he said he would be doing it.
</p>
<p>
Another reason is the location, Suporns clinic is in Chronobi... which is ok.. but it‚Äôs got a small town vibe so entertainment and food choices won‚Äôt be fantastic
</p>
<p>
Chett is located in downtown Bangkok... so you‚Äôve got the entire city to keep you busy + pretty much any kind of food you could want
</p>
<p>
There definitely both good options though, but IMHO as far as post-op recovery I think Chett is a bit better

I don‚Äôt think you should be doing anything after surgery, especially not getting out into Bangkok. You risk hurting yourself.

Yeah for sure, I think the main benefits I was talking about  was mostly down to food choices. I think there‚Äôs only a couple of restaurants and pizza place near the Suporn clinic. Chett has better variety
</p>
<p>
Also if you‚Äôre traveling with someone then they‚Äôll prob have a better time in Bangkok then chronbri

I didn‚Äôt get to see the hospital that Suporn uses, they showed me some pictures though and it looked good.
</p>
<p>
Chett does it directly in the clinic.. and I also wasn‚Äôt allowed inside the room they do it in.. but I did peak into it when I walked by and it looked modern and nice.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs much smaller though, I think Suporn does it in a fairly large hospital with a lot more staff members

I did yeah,  they were really informative and gave very good information, prob the 3rd best consult I had and much better then Kamol.
</p>
<p>
But they said they could only really do a version of PI and my depth would only be at most 4‚Äù but most likely 3.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm doing SRS pretty late into my transition. I‚Äôve been on HRT for more then 8 years and experienced a lot of shrinkage.
</p>
<p>
I want decent depth and I think my only option at this point is non-penile inversion.
</p>
<p>
If I had done SRS earlier then I prob would have gone with the standard PI... the longer you wait the harder it gets to end up with decent depth

I thought about it, but I‚Äôve heard stories about constant wetness in the neovagina and issues with smell? I also have a pretty bad history of colon cancer in my family so anything to do with the colon is kind of risky for me :/

Those stories are wrong. The smell goes away after a short while. Wetness can be an issue with PPT as well. But if you have colon cancer in your family then I would definitely count colo out and take it off the table. Wittenberg does PPT after PI complications. Maybe she would give it to you because of your lack of material to work with? There&#39;s Ting as well but I just don&#39;t know about his history. Whatever you do, good luck!

Did you have access to all the shows and  music  available in the U.S?
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs not that it won‚Äôt be available, it‚Äôs that licensing depends on geographic location.  EG: Netflix is the U.S distributor for a lot of shows, but in another country, it‚Äôs common for another network to be the main distributor because Netflix didn‚Äôt get the licensing deal for that specific location
</p>
<p>
If someone is listening to certain music or watching a show/movie in one country, when they switch to a different country there‚Äôs a chance it might not be available... hence why I‚Äôd recommend just downloading it
