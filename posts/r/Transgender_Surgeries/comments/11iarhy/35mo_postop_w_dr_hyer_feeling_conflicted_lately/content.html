I apologize partly for my previous comment.  Reading this makes me feel like I was being insensitive to your situation. No excuse really but I get so envious of those women who have managed to have their surgeries.
</p>
<p>
I hope  you find the right surgeons to make it right

If you do get a revision, I think it&#39;s worth shopping around for surgeons and not necessarily going back to the one that did your primary. There&#39;s some info in the wiki on surgeons that revise other surgeons&#39; work. Just a quick question if you don&#39;t mind, the darker-coloured skin looks like previous penile shaft skin, was it darker than the surrounding skin before surgery?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry your results didn&#39;t turn out the way you wanted! &lt;3

Im a trans guy, and I’ve had bottom surgery as well. The scars look like they’re healing great, and they’ll probably lighten a lot. As for the rest of the coloration, i think it looks great, super natural for your skin tone. The pigmentation in the skin of the scrotum is physically a match for the pigmentation of the labia, usually. Similarly, the glans of the clitoris is a match for the glans of a penis…and people with natal vulvas have erections :)
</p>
<p>
It is a bit different in size and location from what might be expected from a natal clitoris—but only superficially. The “wings” of a natal clit expand under the skin and tissues of the vulva in multiple directions. There are also people with natal vulvas who have blocked or partially-blocked glands in their labia that swell with arousal because the natural fluids can’t escape—and it can look (and likely feel) similar to what’s happening with your erectile tissue. If you’re worried about the naturalness/passability of your vulva, I don’t think you’re at all in bad shape :) Especially for this early! Vulvas are weird and unique creatures :)
</p>
<p>
I know looking natural can be different tho from looking like what you hope for. I think it’s very common to get revisions to these surgeries, because of what can unexpectedly stand out to us, and because as a reconstruction these are such complicated parts of the body that some part will almost always get a bit discombobulated in healing. Other reconstructive surgeries, like facial ones, often need revisions also for similar reasons. If you need a revision, that’s ok—and doesn’t mean this one went badly, either :)
</p>
<p>
It can take a bit to get used to a new body. For me it also took some time to sort of…demedicalize my new junk in my mind after such a long period focused on surgery planning and recovery. I think it’s smart to wait until at least 6 mos before deciding on any next steps :)

You’re welcome :) I also realized something i should have mentioned, is that post-op depression is very real and it can hit very hard. A lot of us feel like because we’re so depressed, our surgeries were failures for relieving dysphoria—but in fact the cause and effect is reversed: we’re depressed because our bodies are healing and putting all our resources towards that, plus pain and isolation etc, and the most familiar paths for most of our brains when we feel bad is dysphoria.
</p>
<p>
On top of that we are dealing all at once with the very same thing cis people have to do over time, which is coming to terms with insecurity over how our genitals look and act.
</p>
<p>
If you are struggling to feel euphoric, you are not a failure and neither is your surgery. Remember that your brain is a part of your body, and be kind to yourself &lt;3 Healing is more than incisions.

Consider another surgeon and medical tattoos to improve aesthetics. Good luck.

Regarding the aesthetics and colour - I see what you mean but i think it’s a case of it being worse in your head than it is in reality. I’ve definitely seen cis girls who have vulvas darker than the rest of their skin.
</p>
<p>
You have scar tissue but you’re only 3.5 months. In a year that could be much lighter.
</p>
<p>
The erectile tissue does seem excessive. But I’m not sure it’s so bad I’d get a revision.
</p>
<p>
Just FYI the sensation should get much better, it’s still super early days. Hope this helps.

when it just comes to color, if it’s at all reassuring, your vulva being darker than the rest of your skin is totally normal even for people born with that anatomy. i’m a trans man and mine is definitely darker compared to the rest of me. to really demonstrate this, if i actually color pick from a nude ive taken then my thigh is #D3C6B0 while my outer labia is #724F49 and you can google what colors those are lol. it’s still normal to be insecure about it, just know that the coloring isn’t any different from a lot of natal vulvas

It look fab from most angles, and soo pink. But does look like the labia need a longer opening between them. Otherwise looks really good.

Thanks for the update.  It&#39;s healing.  There’s improvement.  At six months it will look even better.  Glad to see you posted an update.  The stitching has healed a lot.  I&#39;m considering Dr Hyer as she&#39;s a local surgeon, so I&#39;m interested in her work.  These things take time.  Another couple of months and things will keep moving in the right direction.
