Dear Reddit,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been trying to get booked for vaginoplasty at PAI for years now.  I&#39;ve been unable to travel because of covid travel restrictions.  While waiting for restrictions to be loosened, I spent lots of time exchanging information with PAI regarding my medical history and plans for what is to be done before and after the surgery.
</p>
<p>
All of this correspondence came from Peera, who is the son of the physician who founded PAI.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we have a surgery date planned in late April.  I asked about making a deposit, and I received a response asking me to send part of the payment in advance and then pay the remainder when I arrived.  I asked them to clarify the amount I should pay in advance, and Peera specified 200 USD.
</p>
<p>
Where this gets really weird and suspicious is that Peera asked me to wire money to an account in his personal name at a bank based in Singapore.  If any representative of a US hospital proposed that I should render payment to a foreign bank in a hospital employee&#39;s name, I would believe it was fraud.  Every time I have paid money to a US hospital, I have paid directly to the hospital, save for one occasion in which I paid to a collection agency following a billing dispute.
</p>
<p>
That being said, I don&#39;t know how these things work in places like Thailand where PAI is based out of.  Furthermore, PAI has been repeatedly recommended on this forum.
</p>
<p>
My wife did some google-fu and found a story by someone who claimed to have paid 2000 USD in 2018 to someone who claimed to be Peera only to be later told that their email had been hacked and they simply lost their money; they suspect that this was advance fee fraud perpetrated by Peera himself:

</p>
<p>
I want to have my bottom surgery done by a reputable physician.  I also do not want to become a victim of advance fee fraud.
</p>
<p>
Can anyone here offer advice? Does anyone know what is happening?
</p>
<p>
I was excited about having my surgery done by a reputable hospital and now I fear that I&#39;m about to become the victim of fraud and lose my money and receive no surgery.

Sorry to hear you are unhappy with the result you got.
</p>
<p>
I chose PAI after reading many stories about good results.

Hello, the best thing you could do is call the clinic directly and see what happens, or send an email to another person who works at PAI, I also have that same fear due to lack of responses from Peera, hopefully it&#39;s not something bad.

Hello, I am considering having my SRS at the PAI clinic (with Dr. Sutin), I might ask you some questions about your experience with them, your results, aftercare and other things.

Okay, that&#39;s what I&#39;m mainly looking for, agreeing on the surgeon with whom I feel comfortable (Dr. Sutin), but I have a question: Which PAI surgeon did your SRS do? (Dr. Burin or Dr. Sutin) And how was your experience with them?

I had secondary sigmoid colon vaginoplasty with Dr Burin at PAI 4 years ago. After reading your post, I went digging through my old emails to find the wire transfer info.
</p>
<p>
The instructions I received back then were for $200 to Peera Tiewtranon. Swift code: UOVBSGSG. Bank code:       7375. That’s part of the info I was given back then.
</p>
<p>
The wire transfer went fine. And when I arrived at PAI in Thailand I paid the remainder of the balance. My surgery and recovery went well. I’m happy with my results and experience there with the surgeon and staff. Peera is a bit odd, but he always followed through.

Thank you!  Peera doesn&#39;t strike me as &#34;odd&#34;, per se.  I think it&#39;s simply a matter of English not being his first language.
</p>
<p>
The bank information you sent me match what I have from him in my email.

Yes, you are right, &#39;odd&#39; was not the best choice of word.  Anyway, I had a good experience with PAI.  Their building was very spacious and modern, and the hospital where I had my surgery was really very modern and comfortable too.

Wish I could help, just upvoting and hoping someone with experience with PAI finds this.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re wise to be safe. Good luck.
