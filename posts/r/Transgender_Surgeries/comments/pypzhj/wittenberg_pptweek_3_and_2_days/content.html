Tired. But good. Happy I&#39;ve got a vagina!!! Wish I could fast forward a couple weeks...ugh. On a side note San Fran is so ridiculously expensive, it feels good to be home and have everything I might need.

Color is improving-ish and I&#39;m home! Pain is really bad today day after airport,  but I&#39;m pulling through. Got some poking sutures and staples removed/trimmed, and was sent home. Sleep is still terrible as sleeping on my side is still almost impossible while icing. I&#39;ve tried pillows in between my legs to reduce pressure on ice pack, etc, I HATE ICEEEEE. Apparently I can stop icing 24/7 at the 5 week mark, so twoish weeks from now. Then its icing on and off, to control pain and stuff.
</p>
<p>
Last week I had a user point out possible necrosis, most probably not necrotic though, just minor sloughing off of tissue and regrowth of skin. Wittenberg alleviated my fears with that. She said it is still impossible to tell at this stage, but the change from black to yellow/pink is promising. You can&#39;t know what the tissue is doing underneath, gotta just wait and see if just surface sloughs off, or the whole thing sloughs off, or the surface sloughs off and regrows. You can&#39;t tell. Gotta wait.
</p>
<p>
STILL NO WOUND DEHISCENCE THOUGH! Yeet. Gettin a litttttle thin at the bottom of that labia though, I&#39;ll watch out. Will keep updating weekly for awhile.

Peritoneal is used for vaginal canal exclusively leaving scrotum and penile skin for external portions.

The peritoneal is as close as cis internal as you can get from what Iâ€™ve read. I think they use some scrotum for the beginning entrance but as far as sensations I think itâ€™s always been clitoral and prostrate mostly

Doctor Wittenberg&#39;s method is not peritoneal flap, but instead full ppt. She crafts the entire vaginal canal from peritoneal tissue.

This. That&#39;s part of the reason I chose her over the people at Mt. Sinai and other surgeons in the US that do hybrid approaches.

Thanks for sharing! Did you get the newer version of how shes forming the labia (with penile skin instead of sutures)? It looks like there might be some retraction on the labia minora, similar to one of the results posted on her website.

Yes, I got the newer version with penile skin. She gives you a choice actually! For me, I disagree, maybe im just optimistic, but the left side of the labia minora is just massively swollen, and the right side of the labia majora is swollen too, so the unswollen right side labia minora is squished underneath. But idk, this&#39;ll look WAY different after the swelling goes away so maybe I will have retraction? Who knows. But at least with penile skin I have a better chance. I think she said her retraction rate with sutures was like 60-80% (don&#39;t remember exactly).

Yeah thatâ€™s all a super good point! I think even if there has been retraction that itâ€™ll still look v good after it heals. Iâ€™m having my surgery with her in June and will probs go with that technique, so canâ€™t wait to see how yours heals! Thanks for sharing your experience ðŸ’›

Looks good! Amazing results already. That yellowish stuff, is that an abscess?

Its healing skin/sloughing off of surface tissue. Was originally black, you can go back to my previous post. I think it has something to do with lack of blood flow/swelling around it. Very common. Hopefully it all turns back to normal pink color

The yellow stuff from almost every procedure I ever had or have seen pictures of down there is skin sloughfing off in some form, particularly from my PIV when I got freaked out a few days after getting home after a lot of something internal came out in a sheet.
</p>
<p>
The moistness inside was too different for the skin to quickly adapt and it shed.
</p>
<p>
I saved some of it in alcohol and grossed some people out later at work by saying it was my p****.
