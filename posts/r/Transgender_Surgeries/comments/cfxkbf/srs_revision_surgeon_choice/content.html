Hi everyone! I would like to ask you some advice about the choice of the surgeon for a revision labiaplasty.
</p>
<p>
I had SRS last November at PAI with Dr. Sutin. I think he did a great job but at the same time my body didn&#39;t heal as far as we hoped and the are a few things that really need to be revised.
</p>
<p>
My first thoughts were to go back to Dr. Sutin to have it done, because nobody knows better my anatomy and how the tissues were cut and sutured. However communication has been a little difficult and at the same time I started wondering if maybe there are surgeons out there who have a built reputation for doing great SRS revisions?  I&#39;m open to all advices, thank you!
</p>

Dr. Bluebond-Langner in NYC has gotten a good reputation for handling revisions for other surgeons.

Hannah Simpson had a revision with Marci Bowers. Worth looking that up first.

Marci Bowers made my case worse. I will not make accusations of maliciousness or negligence in her attempts and the technique itself, but she created a BIG problem for me that did not previously exist (the destruction of my clitoris) and offered me sub-standard options moving forward, namely a cosmetic repair of the area with no attempt to salvage sensory nerves.
</p>
<p>
Knowing there were better options out there, I spent 4 years seeing over 35 doctors and have met a few who do believe nerve work is feasible (obviously not a guarantee to work) in my case. This was with ZERO help from Marci Bowers who said I should look to “forgiveness” and she referred to me as “Quixotic” impossibly searching for the help she refused to assist in my search for, and said that would get in the way of me leading a “normal life,” because clearly being left with a twice-botched vagina didn’t. She also left a full 1” flap of tissue just sticking out because it healed up after not being sewn into the wound correctly.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.female.plumbing">www.female.plumbing</a>
is my site and the pics detail things along the way from both surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Marci, to her “credit” (perhaps) is now speaking to me again and has said she will help refer me to another nerve surgeon she recommends, and will help me facilitate the surgeries I need moving forward, but in the last 3 months since we re-established communication (I had a friend in high places name-drop me to her, with a question of why my case has not been moving forward), she has been responsive to my texts and emails but generally all talk.
</p>
<p>
Nothing has actually happened.
</p>
<p>
It sucks. This has kept my life on hold for years now. People don’t understand that when your vagina looks freakish you don’t feel like a whole human, so you walk into interviews and feel like you don’t even deserve the job when they can pick an intact person. You feel like you don’t deserve long-term happiness so you focus on the instantaneous pleasures like ice cream over exercising. You don’t feel like your body matters anymore. You feel further from being a woman you bravely tried to reveal yourself as, you feel like a fraud, a freak, a loser, and you question whether your life even matters if you can’t be whole and intact.
</p>
<p>
I can’t say who can do your revisions. I wish I could, and we can talk more via PM if you like. But know that you are on one of the hardest journeys anyone has to go through, and it gets worse before—if ever—it gets better.

Thank you for sharing your experience Hannah. I looked at the page you linked. I, I can&#39;t believe what you had to go through, and that you&#39;re here writing and helping others while planning another revision is an inspiration. I can&#39;t help but be desparate at how all of this isn&#39;t fair, it&#39;s not fair! And the loneliness we also have to face is terrible.
</p>
<p>
I will gladly send you a PM later.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t have a good impression of Dr. Bowers when I chose my surgeon for my srs and I don&#39;t think I will go to her for a revision
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll try to read about Dr. Bluebond-Langner!  If anyone has other suggestions too about European or Thai, or Indian doctors they&#39;ll be more than welcome. Thank you so much!
