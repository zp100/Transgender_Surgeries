I was required I go off all HRT two weeks before my VFS surgery.
</p>
<p>
Rather than argue about how I was taking a bioidentical E2 via injection and not swallowing my estradiol and that Progesterone&#39;s half life is measured in hours... I decided to turn it into an experiment and document what I would go through.
</p>
<h1>
What I expect to happen
</h1>
<p>
My Testosterone was measured just the month prior and was at 15 ng/dL which is on the lower end of what women have.  I know enough endocrinology that going off HRT after three years on HRT is much more about the lack of E2 and sex hormones in general and not some great T revival.  I expect my T to rise every single day, but because of the slow growth curves (see papers on males who get off T supplements) by the time I can start HRT again it will
<em>
still
</em>
be in the cis female range.
</p>
<p>
Some anecdotes I found searching include people say nothing happened to them and others say it was miserable.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect, but if anything I was expecting some menopause type symptoms from the lack of sex hormones in general.
</p>
<h1>
Week 1
</h1>
<p>
I took my last shot of Depo Estradiol .7ml three weeks prior to surgery.  The first week was normal as always.  I continued taking Progesterone.
</p>
<h1>
Week 2
</h1>
<p>
I didn&#39;t take a shot this week and I stopped taking Progesterone.
</p>
<p>
I could have taken a final shot the night before and still claimed that I had not taken any HRT in the two weeks leading up to surgery, but that sort of invalidates the point of the experiment and felt like cheating.
</p>
<p>
The depo estradiol from week 1 would be in my system at low, but not zero levels for at least one more week and the idea of slowly going off E2 as it all was used up is much better than going cold turkey like if I had suddenly stopped taking pills.
</p>
<h2>
Symptoms!
</h2>
<p>
By the end of the second week I was waking up with erections and I had a male sweat from my right armpit.
</p>
<h1>
Week 3
</h1>
<p>
Going into the third week for three days straight I had a headache.
</p>
<p>
Then because constant headaches are not so bad the third week my list of symptoms grew
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Waking up with an erection happened daily now
</li>
<li>
Aches and pains all over in my joints, muscles, neck, etc
</li>
<li>
mild headache on and off, not as bad as the first three days though
</li>
<li>
Constant nausea
</li>
<li>
Zero appetite, energy, or libido
</li>
<li>
Unable to nap even though I feel completely tired and feel like I have been awake for days
</li>
<li>
Forgetful
</li>
<li>
Sweating
</li>
<li>
Hot flashes (thank god it was summer and I could stand in front of the air conditioner)
</li>
<li>
Body temperature changed.  Before at night with the AC I would need a blanket, but now I was still hot and sweating at night with the same temperature.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Looking through my phone data on my sleep I discovered that the last two weeks before surgery my daily sleep went from ~6 hours down to only ~3 hours.
</p>
<p>
By the end of week three, I was pretty much not okay.  Between the constant headaches and nausea, I was ready to be done. I was also starting to get really depressed.  I don&#39;t know if the depression and suicidal thoughts were the same as how I felt pre-HRT or if it was from just everything, but it wasn&#39;t nice.
</p>
<p>
But then the biggest shock was that I noticed that my bra which used to be tight in need of replacing was now too big.  Measuring I discovered I had lost almost a full cup size down to being snug in a 34D to being snug in a 34C.
</p>
<h1>
Things that didn&#39;t change
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
My sexuality didn&#39;t revert to what it was before
</li>
<li>
While I knew scientifically my T wouldn&#39;t dramatically rise (still well within cis female levels) even if I didn&#39;t get blood work it was still reassuring that my testicles stayed the same dimensions.
</li>
<li>
Sorry with zero energy / libido I didn&#39;t remember to see if my orgasm swapped back to a male orgasm which was one of the things I was curious to check.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
An open question I have is how much did the inability to sleep contributes to how I felt and if I had taken something to help me sleep if this 3rd week would have been much more tolerable.
</p>
<h1>
Starting HRT again
</h1>
<p>
After coming home from surgery I restart HRT that afternoon.  By the end of the next day my headaches, nausea was gone, and my male scent disappeared within a day or so.
</p>
<p>
By far the most shocking thing was within an hour of my first dose my female ability to smell returned like a freight train.  Over the previous few weeks, I had not noticed how much sense of smell I had lost.  Like a mini version of what it was like the first time this happened, I was noticing how every single thing in my house smelled for a few days before it tapered off.  The first few hours were absolutely intense, but I couldn&#39;t make a noise or say anything because the first three weeks after VFS you have to be silent.
</p>
<p>
3 weeks later even with losing 6lbs, my breasts are back to the size they were before going off HRT.
</p>
<h1>
Thoughts
</h1>
<p>
The third week was when everything got miserable and if I had taken a shot at 2 weeks out as my &#34;last hormone dose&#34;, the overall experience would have been very tolerable.

I had to go off hrt for a month.  I didn&#39;t have any major changes.  I was on gabapentin, which is supposed to ease menopausal symptoms.
</p>
<p>
I did wake up from surgery with no breasts.  They were there when I went in, and then gone.  They&#39;re kinda coming back, but it was like my body said, no estrogen? Fuck her for whatever the heck is going on.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think that last part was a scientific explanation.  But it was a very obvious change just in days

I guess it&#39;s different for everyone, as her already is. I was 2 and a half months without hormones due to the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
To me, the first month was hell! Pretty much everything OP described, though my libido skyrocket at first, the second month it sort of plateaud.
</p>
<p>
Overall experience, 1/10. Don&#39;t recommend.
</p>
<p>
When I was finally able to get my blood tested my T had only gone up to 50. Which is crazy low, considering.
</p>
<p>
Also, to answer OP, around the end of the first month, my orgasms were becoming much less intense, which in turn kinda lowered my libido, so not so bad ðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
Still though, I was absolutely miserable and I&#39;m glad I&#39;m back on hormones. Though I most definitely want to get an orchi now.

Oh it&#39;s interesting that you wrote this, I had been thinking about it. I definitely relate to the forgetfulness after my FFS. I took a book to read but I didn&#39;t read a single page because I couldn&#39;t focus at all. I felt like I didn&#39;t have my normal intelligence for a month afterwards. I wonder how much of that is due to the surgery itself, but I think a component is definitely due to the hormones.

That could also be the anesthetics and painkillers.

I didn&#39;t take anything but NSAIDs after leaving the hospital because I had little to no pain.

Thanks for this.  Not looking forward to two weeks off for GCS, even if I know it&#39;ll be fine in the end.
