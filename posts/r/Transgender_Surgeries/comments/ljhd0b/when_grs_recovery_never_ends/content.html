Long overdue, but these are some of the latest pictures from the last 12-months of my four-year+ recovery from the surgical claws of one self-proclaimed --“Renowned Gender Surgeon”, Dr. Sidhbh T Gallagher. This is the reason I tell all you kids to go with GRS procedure experience, and not just the latest surgery hustler to roll into town with a scalpel looking for crash test surgery dummies. Trust me, you’ll thank me later.

Otherwise you might end up doing the long-hauler extended recovery time for a bottom surgery that only causes you more and more pain and anguish as time goes by.

Oh my god, I am so sorry you&#39;re going through this bullshit.
</p>
<p>
I hope you&#39;re finding the resources to manage the problems you&#39;re having. Please tell me you have a good patient advocate in your corner.
</p>
<p>
Edit: the complications I had seemed bad enough, but they&#39;ve been dealt with now after 1 revision. Hopefully no new complications come forward.

LOL! Patient Advocate? Oh surprisingly enough that was the first thing I turned to only to discover they will only work with you IF you are currently admitted to the hospital. That was a disappointment. But it was just the tip of the iceberg. It took me roughly two years just to get an appointment with a urologist.
</p>
<p>
Crazy as it sounds, I had a mammogram that started an entirely new pile of trauma. It also triggered all these special services though Anthem. After three and a half years, my Anthem case nurse manager was the person who rescued me. She hooked me up with the right program in another state. After I get recovered from the current revision, I think there might be a plan on the horizon.

What really killed me was that being dismissed for fabricated reason. But not only dis she sever our relationship, she cut me off from ALL the plastic surgeons working at her provider. She cut off access to surgical care when I really needed it. She didn&#39;t even need to document when these accusation happened. I hadn&#39;t even seen them for 7 months. When I made a big deal about this she referred me to surgeons hours away in other States.

I cannot stress here enough to find a competent gcs surgeon. I have had urinary issues from day one after my surgery with Sidhbh Gallagher! After she revised my urethra for a third time, once again it began to close in me. I saw a local urologist this past fall who is a very competent gcs surgeon in his own right and he found my problem in less than 30 seconds. My urethra was placed in the wrong place! How could this happen! I have had it fixed and my quality of life has improved tremendously, now I face several other procedures as I have issues with numbness and loss of sensation in my clitoris and vagina. All of this because I thought it would be best to stay close to home and go with a surgeon that also performed surgery on a couple of my friends. About every single one of us that I know personally has some sort of issue post op that used her.

It was originally located just under my clitoris and needed to be about an inch and a half south, closer to the vaginal opening. I was also given a vulvaplasty at the same time.

See...you&#39;re lucky. I feel like just another practice dummies she used in learning what not to do in Indiana. Now she&#39;s at her own practice with her own face plastered all over Tik Tok for the newcomers.

I&#39;ve been hearing really good things about Dr. Witten. I haven&#39;t decided myself if I&#39;ll have GCS but if I can get my insurance to pay for it then I&#39;ll see him. My co-worker just had her consult a couple weeks ago.

This is just a the last 12 month trying to turn things around and getting some traction. This experience completely destroy me. Hands don&#39;t the worst part of the entire ordeal hasn&#39;t been the just surgery itself, it was they betrayal of my own surgeon actions that turned everything into a neverending nightmare.

This is a post by itself, but it&#39;s kinda meaningless without the context of the OP.
</p>
<p>
Wait, wait...I&#39;ve been at this for four years --non-stop. This story is so much bigger than the results of my Vaginoplasty. Much of it I haven&#39;t even revealed. I don&#39;t take any of this lightly, but I&#39;m not about to make accusations that aren&#39;t true and that I haven’t personally experienced or documented.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Here’s the perfect example of what I’m talking about.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have copies of the 300 plus emails and 100&#39;s of intimate images of my body post-surgery that I exchanged with her Dr. Gallagher and her Patient Coordinator --for over a year. The emails came from multiple domains, devices and locations. IU-Health does/did have a secure patient portal, but Dr. Gallagher did not use it. All of our communication was done via unencrypted email and without the written consent required.
</p>
<p>
According to Indiana Administrative Code on collecting electronic patient data (below), all of this correspondence must be maintained as part of my records. Later ,down the road, when I filed a HIPAA security complaint, they couldn’t find any incidents of the breach I described because they had already deleted all of these emails! There were only about 5 or 6 in the patient portal from the tail end of the entire year period that remained. To avoid responsibility for what they had done, --they simply removed them.
</p>
<p>
These were back and forth emails involving my care and appointments. There were image assessments and diagnostic information from Dr. Gallagher. They might have seemed irrelevant to some administrator, but they weren&#39;t.  They documented my state of mind and my care. Unfortunately, they also revealed things that the IU-Health legal counsel must of felt were riskier than me filing a case with the AG&#39;s office. Instead, they just made up a reason for down the road and removed them.  I was told that counsel removed all of these records because they were
<em>
patient initiated
</em>
. Oh that&#39;s rich. Unfortunately, even if that was true --and it&#39;s not even close, the Indiana Administrative Code and HIPAA regulations do not provide any loopholes that give them the authority to remove electronic data or emails that were generated through the Physician/Patient medical records. It&#39;s an absurd excuse.
</p>
<p>
They didn’t want those records to be read because they tell a much different story than they make excuses for. The worst part of this was not discovering this deletion for over two and one half years. Six-months of that time was spent just to get the medical records they hadn&#39;t removed.
</p>
<p>
Read the code below, Think about your own communications via email. Just to be clear. Gallagher’s practice did
<strong>
none
</strong>
of these things listed below. And they knew it.

Sorry for what you are going through. You are not the first person I&#39;m seeing who had a disastrous surgery with her.

I was told to come and check out your story because I was going to go to Dr. Gallagher.  Looks like I&#39;ll keep looking. Ideally I&#39;d like to have it done in Florida. Better support system.

I&#39;m sorry you had to see the carnage, but then, I&#39;m glad you did. Unfortunately, I&#39;m not the only one in this wayward club for Dr. Gallagher&#39;s GRS complications and other life-altering hijinks. This is not a surgery you want to trust to a Dr who spends way too much time marketing herself on Tik Tok.  Seriously, over the last three days, I stopped taking my urinary control meds to see if there was any way I could avoid them and still pee all right. Nope. The problems are unchanged, so it&#39;s back to the meds.

It&#39;s not hard, just download the app and jump on. It&#39;s an entertaining ride when you find the right feeds. GALLAGHER is not one of those feeds. She always bans me anyway.

Surgery competence aside, it was pure inexperience. I was one of her early patients and I didn&#39;t follow my own rules because she was setting up her practice in Indianapolis. I thought staying local and supporting Trans-healthcare in Indianapolis was the right thing to do. That was a mistake to end all mistakes.

She thought she was the experienced surgeon. So did the people around her. She hadn&#39;t done enough surgeries at that point to leave a trail of people telling their stories. I couldn&#39;t find anyone as a referral. I was the first one to step out of the shadows and speak up and I didn&#39;t do it until a year later. I got gaslighted into believing it would all get better. When it didn&#39;t. Not only did my surgery results fail to function properly, she deliberately kept me from accessing the care I needed to fix it. A year into recovery and not working, I was barely hanging on. I didn&#39;t have the resources to go to another State for care.

Malpractice or a medical class action case is almost impossible to file in Indiana. First the statute of limitations is only two years. Second, the case has go before a jury of surgeons who perform the procedure to first judge if there is any merit to the case. Gallagher was the only one practicing MTF vaginoplasty in the whole state when she was here. Plus, the Provider she worked for, IU-Health, is the largest employer in Indiana.

It seems to be almost impossible for any trans surgery. Plenty of botched surgeries around, but when is the last time anyone tried and won?
</p>
<p>
And you have surgeons requiring arbitration agreements now as well. That makes it even worse.

You know, I don&#39;t want to sue a surgeon, I just want a working vagina that they said they could deliver. I don&#39;t like being held hostage by nerve damage or pissing my pants at work. Or the contiguous pile of money it&#39;s taken my wife and I to unfuck my surgery. Is that really such an ask because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s unreasonable at all. I would like nothing more for this to not happen to anyone, anywhere ever again.

Just want to say, I appreciate you trying to help the local community. I&#39;m sure this attitude had a lot of positive outcome from it, hopefully more than than all the negative horrors you have experienced. From what you described, if it is indeed true that you were sort of a practice dummy, it sounds like if so, it had at least led to some more positive outcomes in others. I&#39;m hoping that at least now her results are a lot better. If not, the world needs to know about it! Thanks for sharing and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re getting better results now :)

I appreciate that. I have no idea if her results are getting better because so few people share them. As far as my surgery is concerned, Gallagher will just ride off into the sunset. I&#39;ll have the same sensationless vagina while I take my daily medications so I can control my urine. All thanks to her.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not foolish enough to believe she would take responsibility for anything that she did to me --her patient. The one she took an oath to &#34;Do no harm&#34;. I think I&#39;ve made it as clear as I can that she HAS done me harm. There is no question about that. I didn&#39;t go in with a knife and start cutting nerves. Although I should add, that when your vaginoplasty falls apart, leaving your incisions wide open at post-op +10, nerve damage takes a back seat for a while.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, the only harm she tried to prevent was to her reputation. If I have to live with those consequences then she should as well.

I will definitely keep this in mind if I were to ever have these surgeries and be wary of her name. Thank you again for bringing this to our attention, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll have some echo throughout the internet to help others.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime I&#39;m really into the latest in longevity science, and I want to say that advances in regrowing nerves may not be as far out as you think, so don&#39;t lose hope that you won&#39;t get your sensation back!

But I&#39;ll have to pay for it myself and it&#39;s THIS makes me rage.
</strong>
Constantly paying more money, I don&#39;t have, to fix mistakes that Dr. Gallagher made during my surgery. How is this fair in anyway? Sure there might be a risk involved in surgery, but it would have been nice to know up front I might end up with permanent nerve damage at

both
</strong>
ends of my surgery.

Totally, you deserve a lot better than this, and there should be a lot more reparations from there end. Is there any good central place these days that people can look up doctor&#39;s reviews? I guess what I&#39;m saying is, as you go through this painful process of healing and fighting back, in which I hope you get some compensation and acknowledgement back, that your experience is not for nothing and is helping others. Like just for myself I know now to be very critical of new doctors and to watch out for complications like those cysts. I&#39;d also be able to recognize Gallagher&#39;s name and warn others as well, and I am willing to bet I won&#39;t be the only person to think this :). I hope you can build on that good, and know that it sounds like you are a loving person (which ultimately is what matters), and not get discouraged!

Thanks, I realize your surgery didn&#39;t turn out this way, but there are substantial number of her patients with the urinary, sensation and vaginal restriction problems she left in her rearview mirror. I only know what my experience has been and it has been a nightmare of cysts, nerve damage, anger and depression. A four year disaster, that she has done everything she could possibly do  to build a wall around herself and hide from the lives she ruined. It didn&#39;t have to go down like it did, she escalated the problems in the worst way one after another. She still is. There&#39;s no closure for this trauma. There&#39;s no way to make it all disappear. She just thumbs her nose at another mistake.

Supporting me? You have no idea what other things she has done to me. They are beyond the pale and unethical. Prior to her fabricating my discharge, I had never in 18 months had a disagreement with her. No arguments, no name calling, no loud discussions. Nothing. She fabricated the reasons for my dismissal to discredit me and avoid legal issues.

I&#39;ve heard from people directly. On Facebook and via email. I just saw another person complaining on Youtube today! I don&#39;t know why people are afraid to tell their stories. Maybe they are embarrassed. Maybe they feel they can&#39;t. Maybe....they still need her to put them back together? I feel sorry for them, I know what it&#39;s like to be in that position. Gallagher had all the power she needed to make this right and she chose not too. It&#39;s really that simple. Why? I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not like she hasn&#39;t served me with papers trying to shut me up before.
</p>
<p>
I will happily retract anything I&#39;ve said that isn&#39;t my truth about what happened. If she wants me to change something, she can make a request. Tell me what I need to change. I&#39;ve always put that right on the table. I&#39;m not trying to ruin her but it was her extreme and dishonest action that denied me access to the care I needed for more than two years. All that time I had to deal with the constant pain of the cysts and the incontinence issues. I mean that --every fucking day. I can&#39;t think of one reason the entire world shouldn&#39;t know this.
</p>
<p>
No one signs up for this much pain and heartache no matter what bullshit consent forms they dream up.
</p>
<p>
Hell, she&#39;s gotta be pretty seasoned at bottom surgery by know, if she&#39;s making the same urethra mistakes, it&#39;s up to those patients whether they speak out or not. No one is going to advocate on their behalf. They have to do it themselves. That goes for everyone.

Right on, I&#39;ve been off and on here. it&#39;s hard to deal with this stuff everyday. I can&#39;t run from it. I can&#39;t get the nerve damage fixed. And I honestly thought I was going to be stuck with those cysts forever. I&#39;m so paranoid about wound dehiscence after the surgery 9 days ago I don&#39;t want to move. And the cyst removal was  just 1 month after having my recalled and ruptured breast implants replaced. It was such a mess the surgery took 6 hours.  I guess I should make a warning post about breast implant maintenance too.

I can tell you from experience that that caused so many of my problems, from my trip home from Indianapolis I spent most of my trip home trying to go to the bathroom and couldn’t, I had issues all the way up to this past November, since then some of my sensation has returned. My constant numbness started to subside, I wouldn’t doubt there is some nerve damage there, time will tell.

I had 3 revisions to mine, the last one lasted about 8 months. It wasn’t too bad to move it, no worse than the revisions she did on mine except this one seems to be working well! I also received a vulvaplasty in the process and things are looking good as well, I had basically no vulva before this. I hope you don’t have issues but if you do it is probably similar to mine and will continue to stenosis. I have a cystoscopy scheduled in April to check for any scarring. As of now urinating is effortless, and I don’t have to wear pads for the first time since my original surgery two and a half years ago.

Oh I thought Gallagher had done the revision, I am sorry. Great you had someone experienced!! I had horrible leaking issues since day 1, I would keep leaking after peeing. I saw the pelvic physical therapist at IU and she never mentioned that things were off but everything she had me do didn’t work! Nice to be able to wear a nice pair of panties and not have fear of leaking.
