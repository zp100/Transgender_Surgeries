Hey, everyone! I just had Stage One of FFS with Dr. Tommy Liu with The Polyclinic in Seattle today, and it was a genuinely amazing experience! Ask me anything you want about him, the hospital, the process...fire away!

(Stage One: Type 3 Forehead Setback, Orbital Contouring, Brow Lift, Chin and Mandible Contouring)

How did they treat you in the post op area at swedish? My male nurse was a complete butthole.

Did he misgender you a bunch? I&#39;m willing to bet we had the same one.

Yeah he did a couple times I can&#39;t remember what his name was though.
</p>
<p>
Mostly though my blood pressure was high after surgery because I was in a ton of pain and very stressed out (it was so loud in there and my head was fucking POUNDING). The only thing he did was give me fentanyl and it was enough to make me dope sick for about a week. He also was rude to my sister.
</p>
<p>
He didn&#39;t really help me get to the bathroom either and I almost fell over. Tommy will usually do the second procedure on the 16th floor OR in the polyclinic building. He did mine there and it was a much better post op experience.

Yeah, I&#39;m willing to bet we got the same one. He was a bit abrasive toward me. And I heard him misgendering me outside my recovery room every time he either left the room to talk to someone or when someone came into the ward. They always corrected him immediately. One person (I believe) followed up with &#34;you need to be more respectful&#34;. And he called me &#34;sir&#34; right to my face as well. Major league prick.

I need to get around to writing a complaint. You should do the same. Unfortunately swedish is owned by Providence and they don&#39;t care about trans people.

Yeah it was just the one nurse that sucked honestly. Everyone else was really nice to me and the nurse in pre-op was asking me questions like I have AFAB plumbing so she had absolutely no idea I&#39;m trans.

I have FFS next week with Dr. Liu and need to mentally prepare if that male nurse may still be working at the hospital.

You can ask for women only and it&#39;s highly doubtful homie is still there. Don&#39;t remember his name but he was a tall skinny white guy with a very generic name. Good luck with surgery honey, sending good vibes

My friend just had FFS yesterday and encountered the same person, same experience. Did not get the name. I also had FFS back in October last year and did not get that nurse. If we all called Dr. Liu to tell him about our experiences, perhaps they can figure it out. Plus the staff probably knows who it is.

It&#39;s a Swedish/Providence issue not a Dr. Liu issue unfortunately. Swedish hospital administration would be the ones to complain to. I plan to do so once I remember the name.

Congratulations and I hope your recovery goes so smoothly!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going in for my consult with Dr. Liu at the end of the month. What made you go with him over other surgeons you were considering?

Thank you! It&#39;s going great so far.
</p>
<p>
I consulted with him, Sarah Saxon, Mardirossian, and Toby Mayer. Insurance coverage and location
<em>
did
</em>
play a role in my final selection, but overall, I really liked his attitude and I
<em>
really
</em>
liked the results and reviews I was seeing online and on Reddit. He was also very thorough and friendly during the consult and got me in to get my 3D CT on the same day. He came across as humble but confident overall.
</p>
<p>
Mardirossian was my second choice. He and Liu have very similar temperaments and Mardirossian has loads of experience. Plus, being a student of Spiegel&#39;s and having tons of stellar reviews and results online were huge feathers in his cap.
</p>
<p>
Saxon was third. She was extremely sweet throughout my consult and was confident in her abilities. Her results were also very good, and as another student of Spiegel&#39;s, I knew she&#39;d do great work on me.
</p>
<p>
Mayer wasn&#39;t even on my list. He was extremely arrogant from the second I got on the call with him to the moment we hung up. All he really did was try to convince me that I shouldn&#39;t get Type 3 forehead work and trash other surgeons. It was gross.

I had my FFS with Dr. Liu on Dec 2.  I hope your recovery is quick.  I am pleased with Dr. Liu and the staff at poly clinic.
</p>
<p>
Did you feel like they rushed you out of the hospital after surgery?  I felt like Swedish just wanted me out of their hair.

How long did it take you to get your surgery scheduled with Dr. Liu.  I&#39;m having the most difficult time getting someone to call me to schecule.  I keep getting told &#39;you&#39;re in the queue&#39;.  It&#39;s driving me insane LOL.

Not too long. That said, Dr. Liu just lost his scheduler a few weeks ago. There&#39;s a new girl filling in, but she&#39;s in training. If I had to guess, the other surgeons&#39; schedulers are still handling most of his cases. If you can get in touch with any other plastic surgery scheduler at the Polyclinic, you can probably get a date almost immediately.

Awesome! Yeah, he&#39;s good. The
<em>
only
</em>
thing I will say is that you don&#39;t always get all of the post-op instructions you should. Remember not to touch your forehead for six weeks and to not wear your glasses (if you have them) for 6 weeks after septorhinoplasty. He&#39;ll say 2,
<em>
but
</em>
every other surgeon out there says 6, so I&#39;m inclined to go with their word over his on that.

Soft tissue. Septorhinoplasty, cheek fat transfer, and tracheal shave. You&#39;d also have your lip work done in Stage 2 if you wanted/needed it.
