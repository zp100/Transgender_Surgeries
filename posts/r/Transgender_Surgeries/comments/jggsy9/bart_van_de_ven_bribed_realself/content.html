Did you all realise that Bart van de ven has hugely bribed realself to get removed all his 1 STAR FFS reviews. REALSELF is a total undemocratic space.

Let him bribe Realself. There are far more transwomen using forums like Reddit and FB. Also no money can hide a butcher&#39;s incompetence forever. File a complaint to the Orde de Artsen and you can get his license removed.

Thanks Federal-Tension. My heart is filled with anger; how brutal and cunning a person could be. How can one suck money and destroy someone&#39;s life. I&#39;m nearly blind.

The more reason you have to file a complaint then if he damaged you that badly. You can keep sharing your stories here but I&#39;d advise to support it with evidence like photos of the damage, scans and x rays and reports. That way everyone will understand the extent of the damage better and you can also effectively warn people about him. I hope this makes sense?

But you would have notes and letters from other surgeons and doctors confirming this which you could share and send to the medical board as well as post a screen shot of. That&#39;s what I did for mine. I even shared my radiologist report here which showed Bart&#39;s horrid work on me. Very traumatising actucally ðŸ˜¢

What do you want me to put online? My face ? And my blindness? Or, my opthalmologist&#39;s report where nowhere it says Bart&#39;s name as the reason for my partial blindness.

I think you misunderstood, no worries. I did not ask you to do anything. I&#39;m trying to understand if Bart is legally preventing you from pursuing action or posting online?

RealSelf is a scam website. Read up on it on reddit. The business model is doctors basically pay RealSelf for marketing them. They decline to post negative reviews after a doctor has met their quota. Meaning doctors paying to be on their website will never get more than a certain % of negative reviews. Also RealSelf apparently allows patient coordinators or a surgeon&#39;s staff to write reviews as if they are patients.

OK. I hate Bart Van de Ven. And I&#39;m so sorry you went through hell with him. You and so many other trans folks deserve to sue that asshole for all his money.
</p>
<p>
But you have presented no evidence of this bribery.
</p>
<p>
And the 1-star
<a href="https://www.realself.com/dr/bart-van-de-ven-berchem-belgium#reviews">reviews are still up
</a>
, just search by lowest rating.
</p>
<p>
This is not helping the conversation of 1) why every trans woman needs to avoid him, and 2) why every botched patient of his needs to sue, and 3) that authorities need to revoke his license to practice.
</p>
<p>
Ps - just to reiterate, FUCK Bart Van de Ven.

I think the OP meant the several recent ones this year. There were 15 new ones I think that were removed.

Ave almost turned blind after Bart van de ven&#39;s surgery. My fave marks visible all post-durgery stitches. Plus, he&#39;s charged enormous money with no evidences of surgeries as spoken; leaving it to a DAMAGED face.
</p>
<p>
No evidences of bribery, which I agree- but if you look at Bart&#39;s REALSELF page, the 1 stars are removed, recently. And, as many times I try to post my review for Bart, realself never publishes it. I find no reason, why not(!) (?)

You need to sue that monster in court. For all he&#39;s worth. I hear your anger and pain. And I know you want to get Justice, and you deserve that.
</p>
<p>
But Lying online about bribes he&#39;s taken is NOT the way to get Justice. Contact the websites support team, and then contact your lawyer.

It&#39;s Bart Van de Ven butchering people which does not need evidence. We all know how consistent he is with botching people causing nerve damage and desths. All his patients even the happy ones have nerve damage but are too stupid to admit it to themselves.
