Since it&#39;s been a little while, as a reminder I had penile preservation vaginoplasty (peritoneal pull-through) with Dr Wittenberg in December. You can read a little more about it in my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/revtj4/part_1_penile_preservation_vaginoplasty/">first post
</a>
, which also links to all my other posts.

, four months post-op.
</p>
<p>
Healing is coming along nicely, with the exception of the fistula. I have a dye test coming up soon that will verify where exactly the hole is (it seems to be in my bladder), then I can try to get it fixed surgically. Meanwhile, I&#39;m on an antiseptic to try to prevent additional UTIs (I&#39;ve had three so far). Most of my pee comes out of my vagina when I pee, but fortunately I&#39;m not incontinent or anything.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is down to once a day as of a month ago (5 months post-op). I&#39;m having some trouble getting the orange quite as deep as the smaller dilators. I lost a little more depth, but things seem stable. I&#39;m able to make three dots fully disappear, and I can get most of the way to the fourth dot, although it remains visible.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is not exactly painful, but everything is pretty sore, possibly due to the antiseptic. It&#39;s better than when I had a UTI though, that was really bad each time.
</p>
<p>
As always, feel free to ask me questions here or in my DMs.

One of the advantages of the pull-through is supposed to be lubrication. How’s your experience with lubrication over these past several months? Are you satisfied?
</p>
<p>
Thanks again for your posts. They mean a lot.

It&#39;s hard for me to gauge lubrication so far because it gets flushed out every time I pee because of the fistula.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very satisfied! I just wanna get this fistula fixed....

Reading your journey has been fascinating and enlightening. I&#39;m glad your healing so well and hope your fistula gets sorted out. I&#39;m sure this will help a lot of people that are curious about this type of surgery, which seems kind of a niche but still quite successful and rewarding.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing.

I didn’t know this surgery was possiblle, thank you for sharing! May I ask you, do you experience pleasure with your penis still? Is the peritoneal pull_through surgery allow more depht rather than penis inversion vaginoplaty?

They went in through my belly to cut the peritoneal tissue, then pulled it down and formed a pocket to line my vagina.

I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to share your experiences, and with so much detail. Your PPV surgery has been the corner stone of my surgery plans, and helped me develop realistic expectations 🤩
</p>
<p>
I have two quick questions, if you dont mind sharing. Was the fistula a by-product of the surgery? Also, are the reoccurring UTIs related to having your urethra rerouted to peeing from your vagina? I ask because I&#39;m not sure if I want to continue to use my penis or not for urination. If rerouting the urethra mainly causes more issues, I might opt out from that part.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t wait to see your next update! Seeing your progress gives me the strength and confidence to continue my journey ❤️

Thank you! I&#39;m glad you are getting something out of my posts!
</p>
<p>
I actually didn&#39;t get the urethra rerouted. I&#39;m supposed to continue peeing from my penis, but during surgery my bladder adhered abnormally strongly to my colon and Dr Wittenberg had to go through the bladder instead of between. I don&#39;t fully understand the mechanics of it but that was how she explained it. Anyway, she sewed it up, but it healed with a small hole to my vagina that&#39;s allowing pee to come out when there&#39;s enough pressure (like when I pee), and allowing bacteria to come in from my vagina.
</p>
<p>
Urethral rerouting shouldn&#39;t have any effect on the complication I had, which is pretty rare.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck with your journey! 💕

Really impressed with your surgery. I knew about PPV but didn’t know it was also possible to also keep the scrotom intact. It’s useful to hear that doing labiaplasty seperately gives better results, at least so far
</p>
<p>
It’s comforting to see other non-binary people getting non-standard surgeries! Congrats and I hope the complication is fixed soon

Once you have the scrotum revised later will you still be able to get erections ? Does this involve orchiectomy?

I expect so, since I already had an orchi and I still get erections. The orchi was optional.

My surgeon says it&#39;s fixable, there&#39;s just a risk of vaginal constriction. But I need to get it fixed eventually because otherwise it will keep causing problems.

I haven&#39;t decided on the surgeon to fix it yet but they will be a urological surgeon or maybe I can get Dr Wittenberg to fix it.

<p>
Constriction meaning tightening, possibly enough to lose some depth.

Did they say why that was a risk?  Because you wouldn’t be able to dilate while you were healing from the bladder surgery?

I&#39;m not sure, but I think they have to put some fatty tissue between my bladder and vagina. I&#39;m unsure if it will interfere with dilating.

I had penetrative sex with a dildo with my partner a couple months ago and it was really nice, but it agitated the fistula so I haven&#39;t done that again. I might have to get that fixed first before I can really enjoy receptive sex.

I&#39;ve topped a bunch though, that all works great.

I&#39;m glad you are getting something out of my posts!
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had any weird odors or constant dripping or anything, but I&#39;ve also been douching pretty much daily as part of my shower routine. I also have a vesicovaginal fistula that I need to get fixed which means my pee comes out my vagina, so that&#39;s probably rinsing it out pretty good too 😒
</p>
<p>
Once I get the fistula fixed, I&#39;ll post about that experience and be sure to update everyone on the lubrication and odor (if any).

It&#39;s actually great seeing this, because I sort of knew that keeping the penis was an option, but I just had no clue what it&#39;d be like. Yours was done beautifully, thanks for sharing.

Me watching futanari porn: That can&#39;t exist you cant have a penis and a vagina. They&#39;re obviously just trying to portray trans women without explicitly making them trans women and saying no, theyre different because they have both genitals.

Do I see it correctly that they left your scrotum intact as well? What was your vagina made from then? Why did you want this rather than a normal SRS?

Yes, the scrotum is being preserved to become labia in a revision. There have not been good results trying to do the two at the same time with PPV. The vagina is made from peritoneal tissue pulled down from my abdomen to create a pocket in the vaginal canal. One benefit of peritoneal pull-through is that it&#39;s wet and doesn&#39;t shed skin cells, but I went with this method mainly so I could keep my penis because I&#39;m fond of it.

Do you have a revision scheduled? I&#39;ve seen a few people who&#39;ve had this type of bottom surgery, but none so far that had a labiaplasty

Did you have an orchie or do you still have your testes? That was not entirely clear from the picture.

The most notable effect I felt was a significant reduction in energy. Otherwise all the effects were positive for me, but I had already been on spiro. Are there particular effects you&#39;re worried about? If you want to discuss.

Does penetrating increase the pleasure felt by your penis?  Did you have laser hair removal prior to surgery?

Yep, feeling full helps a lot with sensation in my penis, but unfortunately last time I orgasmed with something inside me it made the fistula worse. So I may have to wait to get that fixed before I experiment more.
</p>
<p>
I had laser hair removal 2017-2018, and I got it touched up a little with electrolysis in the year prior to surgery.

Where did you get laser done?

<p>
I thought laser wasn&#39;t permanent and thus those hairs will eventually grow back.

A little of the hair had grown back, mostly stubborn pubic hair and a little arm hair. I would call it permanent though, if not 100% thorough.

Where did you get laser done?
<br>
I thought laser wasn&#39;t permanent and thus those hairs will eventually grow back.

Thanks! I&#39;ve used it a little, my partner used a toy on me and it was really nice. I had a vaginal orgasm another time too. But I&#39;ve been having problems with the bladder fistula, so I haven&#39;t been able to explore more unfortunately.

Thank you for sharing your evolution post-OP. I&#39;ve recently found out this surgery was possible, and my desire to get it has been growing ever since. Sadly, it seems to be barely known, and I don&#39;t think any surgeons in my country do it yet... so any information I can find about it is really helpful. Hopefully it&#39;ll be more widespread in the upcoming years.

If there are any surgeons who do peritoneal pull-through or sigmoid colon vaginoplasty in your country, it may be worth speaking to them about it. It&#39;s also possible to achieve using tunica vaginalis and scrotal tissue, although it won&#39;t look the same as mine and you won&#39;t have scrotal tissue left over to make labia later if you choose.

Thank you for the kindness! 💕 Yeah I got recommended two surgeons whom I could bring this option up to. Even if they end up saying no, at least I will leave with no regrets. I guess if there&#39;s enough demand for it, a surgeon will start looking into it further down the line...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still learning about the technicalities regarding the surgery. I was curious about the sensations post-OP. Is penetrative sex pleasurable on both sides in particular? That&#39;s something that, if possible, would really fulfill what I thought was a fantasy until I learned about PPV.

<p>
Absolutely. I haven&#39;t done much yet because I&#39;ve had a lot of soreness internally, but I recently switched to a different lube for dilating that is helping a lot, so hopefully I&#39;ll be able to try more soon.
</p>
<p>
The sensation inside is pretty great - I can feel everything against my urethra, which runs along the front wall of the vagina, and the &#34;fullness&#34; sensation is really great. There isn&#39;t exactly tactile sensation internally, but that&#39;s the same thing people with natal vaginas describe anyway, so I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m missing anything. Oh, and the g-spot is so much easier to access now!
</p>
<p>
I still top sometimes too.

That&#39;s reassuring to hear you have sensation inside. I was asking because I wasn&#39;t sure how that would work in comparison to other types of vaginoplasty.

<p>
You really give me hope!

I&#39;m really looking forward to hearing about your experiences with sexy time. I want to keep my penis but also don&#39;t want to miss out on having a vagina. I just heard about this surgery and am amazed at your results! It&#39;s important for me that the sex is good so I&#39;m wondering what it feels like exactly.

Your penis looks a little strange - though to be fair it&#39;s not often that I examine the underside of my dick. The skin on the underside for you seems to be very wrinkled and loose. Is this because of the surgery or is it something else entirely?
</p>
<p>
Also, I can&#39;t tell, did this involve removing the testicals (or were they removed before?) or do you still have those in there?
</p>
<p>
Also, also, what&#39;s the over-under on if you change your mind about wanting to preserve the penis? And I say &#34;you&#34; in the royal you sense, not you specifically. But if one were to get this done, is it possible to - if you decide actually the dick&#39;s gotta go - to complete a penile inversion or something like it? (Ie; basically same result as if you had done penile inversion to begin with, except I assume the tissue of the vagina itself wouldn&#39;t be &#39;redone&#39;. Thinking more in terms of clitoral function and such).
</p>
<p>
Cause if that&#39;s the case than this seems like - cost pending - a really good choice for someone to get if they KNOW they want a vagina, but aren&#39;t sure if they want to part with their penis completely. Like for myself, my genital dysphoria is fairly mild but the strongest point of internal conflict for me is the balls and the sack that carry them. I hate how it looks. It&#39;d be kind of okay I think if it was always snug and tight but I run hot, so it&#39;s rarely cold enough for them to pull up like that.
</p>
<p>
The other thing is that...anal is like...fine??? I guess??? But it involves a lot of...preparation that really kills the mood for me as well as a lot of anxiety around obvious things.
</p>
<p>
Oh, also, you say you&#39;re no longer on spiro. You&#39;re still (I assume you were already) on feminizing HRT, yes? Or no?

Not sure why you got downvoted. Yep, that&#39;s just what my penis looks like, very stretchy skin can look wrinkly from underneath. Possibly it&#39;s looser now after orchi, but I&#39;ve heard that maybe that tightens up a bit over time. By the way, I plan to have labia made from my scrotum in about a year.
</p>
<p>
Yep I got orchi at the same time as this surgery. It was optional. That&#39;s why I was able to stop spiro. I have been on feminizing HRT since early 2020.
</p>
<p>
If you change your mind, you can get a clitoplasty and labiaplasty with similar results to PPT vaginoplasty, which Dr Wittenberg also does. It leaves a lot more skin to work with than the current standard PI method.
</p>
<p>
Anal has never really worked for me, so I feel you.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with your journey! 💕

I think she had an orchiectomy as well (removal of testicles) which is why she stopped spiro. (just an assumption). Which is why the bottom part looks different.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s the aesthetic she wanted and she&#39;s happy with it.
</p>
<p>
Obviously its not the average aka &#34;normal&#34; to have both a penis and vagina, or to have an orchiectomy, but this is how she feels most authentic as a person. The fact that you think it looks weird just comes from a heternormative view of the world.

I&#39;m really feeling like you didn&#39;t actually read what I actually wrote and just took out and added parts to construct a meaning that which I didn&#39;t say nor imply.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not talking about the obvious scrotum. I&#39;m talking about the shaft, closer to the head, even. Where it&#39;s more wrinkled than I&#39;d expect. And I was asking some reasonable questions.
</p>
<p>
You seem to have interpreted this as some kind of transphobic...idk...criticism or something? Nothing I was talking about was about the whole set up looking weird. I don&#39;t have a very heteronormative view of the world - I&#39;ve dashed that against the rocks at this point.

I&#39;m still planning to have a labiaplasty, probably in about a year. I have a consultation with Dr Avanessian coming up in January.

Kinda, it&#39;s still healing a lot though. I had a complication that was corrected in September though, so hopefully it&#39;ll start to feel more like it&#39;s supposed to in a few months. It has a lot of internal sensation, though, so that&#39;s nice.

I definitely will! I&#39;m heading to my 12 month post-op appointment as we speak, and once I&#39;m home from that I&#39;ll post a 12 month update.
