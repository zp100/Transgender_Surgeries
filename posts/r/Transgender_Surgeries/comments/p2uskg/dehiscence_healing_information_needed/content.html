My wife just got her surgery. She&#39;s having major wound separation issues along the suture line. The doctor already had to cut away a few sections of necrotic tissue, leaving her raw in some areas. I&#39;m wondering how these wounds heal. The doctor just says they heal themselves and I&#39;m having a hard time believing him. I need to hear it from someone else.
</p>
<p>
Every day they separate more and more. I feel for her because she&#39;s headed towards total separation. What can be done? What should the doctor be doing?

He mentioned the silver nitrate sticks to me. I&#39;ll have to look up how they work and see if I need them sooner or if I use them later.

They cauterize the area that seems to refuse to stop bleeding. He&#39;ll tell you if you need them or not and he applies them on a schedule if so.

When I learn to post pics could you take a look?
</p>
<p>
50% dehiscence (wound separation), it&#39;s better now, hope new year is good with me.
</p>
<p>
I keep having problems with candida, now the urethra is dark red, can&#39;t dilate anymore.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m absolutely terrified. Ideas on dilating with fingers? Dilator goes near urethra and irritates it, so I need something less in diameter, but not a finger. Using condoms and some daily objects that can fit not so tight? I can&#39;t buy a mini dildo right now, I need urgency help and surgeon is not answering my messages since yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your comments and help

I think most anyone on here would be happy to look and help. But yes I am also happy to help.
</p>
<p>
My canal is far enough away from urethra that nothing can really go near when dilating, so I am curious now close things are. Fingers might work for at least the entry way but certainly not for depth.
</p>
<p>
When was your surgery?

Hi! 6 and a half weeks ago. Yeah... I&#39;ve just observed everything is just too close. I&#39;m thin btw but this shouldn&#39;t justify it. Urine seems to come from behind labia minora, and there&#39;s the clitoris. Maybe it&#39;s too much inflammation due to surgery and the fungus...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve just did 1 session, less pain than last night. Redness of that deep hidden mucosa is dark... This worries me.
</p>
<p>
Called the surgeon 3 hs ago and he was angry and blaming I send too much messages (unanswered questions with pics, that are piling from weeks ago, yeah i send many unanswered questions...). A total psychopath do this, not a doctor. I said &#34;i can not dilate with this tissue damaging itself with dilator&#34; and he went like crazy. Some other ex patient told me he maybe is high on Coke sometimes. And she has a true admiration for his surgeon...
</p>
<p>
Not me. I&#39;m not telling this to damage reputation, he&#39;s an inhuman horrible being.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m weakening more and  more. I&#39;ve been doing 4 sessions, eating, sleeping all gone till this fungus kicked in and heavy aches itches stopped my routine to zero. But with a non cooperative doctor i can&#39;t be sure what to do. Summer doesn&#39;t helps, 40° C, anemia is weakening me day to day. People are tired to assisting me. They have their things too but I&#39;m worsening and alone. I know that it&#39;s too soon but fungus is an added problem that I hadn&#39;t considered beforehand.
</p>
<p>
EXHAUSTED AND FRUSTRATED. This is like hell is on Earth. Don&#39;t know how to upload pics.., thank you again

I experienced wound dehiscence too during my surgery three years ago. This is because the the stitches automatically breaks apart due to tightness and just the way our body moves and stretches around that area.  My doctor also said that in time it will heal itself. And it did heal over time. I cleaned the area using betadine on the area. Also, diet plays a important factor too. I  ate a lot of  protein and vegetables to help heal the wound and rebuild skin and elasticity of the skin.

I do have her on a high protein diet for healing purposes. She also suffers from gastroparesis so I have to watch what I give her to eat.
</p>
<p>
How long was it until you saw the wounds begin to reclose? Do they simply start from the connected part and work their way down when healing?

I started seeing the wound re-close in about a month. It will definitely take some time. It  started from the top of the connected area and slowly work itself down. Also don&#39;t forget to clean the area too and rest up. The combination of a high protein diet, sleep and cleaning the area will help her with a speedy recovery.

I had dehiscence at my perineum at day 12. It was about a half in long by three eights deep. Two weeks later when I went back for my follow-up my surgeon had to remove the necrotic tissue in the area. It took about three months for it to granulate in and heal but it did without real issues. I will say it was scary as hell when it went because I bled a fair amount. As an aside I also found out at that same follow-up that I had necrosis of about 50% of the vaginal graph lining which had to be removed also. That also healed well but took the better part of six months.

My fourchette was all destitched, she was showing yellow fat tissue, and she was separated for 1.25cm at its lowest point. She healed in few months, and what i even s more interesting she is very flexible and sensitive in erogeninc sense. So magic just happened.
</p>
<p>
How to heal wounds? Antibiotic ointment (Furacin) + Enzymatic debridement (Iruxol) mix 50-50 and apply three times a day. Ovestin apply another times. 1 month and she&#39;s like new 😉
