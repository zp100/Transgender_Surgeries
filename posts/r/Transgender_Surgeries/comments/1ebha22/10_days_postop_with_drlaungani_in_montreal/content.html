Oh ok  ! I am post operative for 12 years. Trust and believe I know allll the drama that comes with healing. Trust your body and if you have any questions always ask. You can also see your pcp to make sure you’re healing properly. I used a gyno and she helped me with some tiny complications. I always tell friends that it looks like hamburger meat at first then the buns hahahaha now she’s just a little pussssssyyyy. Congratulations

I&#39;m 1 month post op from dr Brassard in Montreal, my gauze just fell off about a week ago. It&#39;s pretty much just held in by a blot clot on the clit and swelling so you just have to wait for it to detach itself or else you might cause some damage to your clit by pulling on it.

You are correct gsr Montreal reached out to confirm it was/is fibrin and though it is non viable tissue and looks scary it is completely normal.

To add a little more context upon my evening dilation I have noticed that this greyish tissue is continuing to expand.. and dilations are quite a bit more difficult and painful then they had been at the covalescence center.
</p>
<p>
I would like to confirm that this is not the beginning of non-viable tissue, I did notice this when I was in Montreal (though there was less of it) and mentioned it to once of the nurses, and was told it was fine, but I find it to be of great concern that the tissue seems to be expanding.
</p>
<p>
Anyone have anything similar to this?

I was with Dr.Brassard in January and yeah things started to hurt and be much more uncomfortable at about the same time.  Lasted about 4 weeks and then things improved dramatically.  Hang in there.  The good news is that it does get better.  I just started only 1 dilation a day this week.  Will see how that goes.

How is once a day going for you?  Today is day 3 for me.  Little bit of a change yesterday in that it required a little longer to get to the right dot.  Hopefully it won’t be much different today.  Would hate to go back to twice a day.

Idk, I&#39;ve been very &#34;to the schedule* in the first and mostly second month.  But after I started getting more mobile at about 4-5 weeks mark, going out doing chores, I started slacking off.  Mine was end of Jan, so I still officially have some 2x a day on the schedule, but I&#39;ve been doing once a day primarily for a month or two now.  There were a couple days I ended up skipping a day too. This started happening when, I would start the morning with a dilation, and then have a very long day, and by the end of it is be too tired to go through the paces and just passed out in bed.  The skipped days were mainly because I&#39;d wake up, kids would need things etc and I&#39;d start the day pushing the once a day till evening, and the evening - same, just went to sleep.  Tbh, I was really worried at first.  But in reality so far so good.  The skipping a day doesn&#39;t go well - by the time I get back to depth (would take closer to an hour), I&#39;d be pretty strained, and I&#39;d have plasma leakage/pink leakage for a day or two.  Minimal to no loss of depth so far though, after putting in the work when getting back to it that is.  I also think one component of 2x a day is you get a little more swelling from dilating more often - I feel more bruised/tender inside when I do it twice a day now vs once a day.  I still do it twice a day once in a while.  Such as for steroid cream.  In the morning before washing it out.  And in the evening to apply.  But anyway.  I feel like the schedule is good overall, but a little overrated.  I think it works to try once in a while to reduce to test the waters and see how it goes, and maybe reducing earlier if it goes ok doesn&#39;t hurt.  I hope reducing goes easy for you. I feel like I got a bit of a PTSD from so much dilating in the first month, it was an intense 24/7.  It felt a lot more liberating every time I dropped a step.  I feel like sticking to what I&#39;m managing now for the rest of the 6mo, dropping days still has its cost, so I&#39;ll keep it at once a day at least till maybe a month or two off 12 months.  But after that, I can&#39;t wait to not have to dilate every day, I&#39;m so sick of it already, even at the once a day mark.  Those hard plastic soulsource dilators def took a mental toll on me.

It really is quite difficult, that first month. I&#39;m sorry that you are really feeling the effects of it. It really hit me hard also and it&#39;s it a great place to be. I found my therapist really helpful but if you don&#39;t have that just someone to talk with regularly. I&#39;m just shy of 9 weeks post op with Brassard so 3x a day for another 5 weeks but just moving from 4 to 3 was a lot of relief. Next Wed I can drop sitzing and air drying. I saw my gyno last Tuesday and she said I&#39;m healed enough for penetration. &#34;Fingers, toys, penis..&#34;. As long as it&#39;s gentle.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot more positive things ahead now so but it can def depend on adherence to recovery protocol.

Dilations feel more painful once you&#39;re back home because you&#39;re not on the medication they were giving you there. It&#39;ll ease up and if you have to then size down for a bit. I found once it felt like 2 &amp;3 went in no problem I then went back to 3&amp;4 (about a week &amp; half) and was able to take in 4.

You have tissue that looks necrotic. If you cannot get in with your doctor urgently then you should go to your OB/GYN or lastly the emergency room so that they can treat the area.

I am waiting to hear back from both my doctor, GRS Montreal. I have contacted them both and should hope to here back within the next few hours if I don&#39;t hear from them within the next few hours, I plan on going to the emergency room. To the best of my knowledge there is not much they can do if the tissue is necrotic there then remove it.

Confirmed with GRS Montreal that it is indeed just fibrin which is still not viable graft tissue, but that it is not necrotic. I also am presenting no symptoms of infection in the form of a fever and am not showing any pus

Oh good. Just looks rather Sloughy and different to typical fibrin tissues that&#39;s all. This is coming from my eyes as a nurse who deals with slot of wounds.

Yeah I was considered for a while but it&#39;s looking much better today, then it was just a few days ago, I think getting an actual sitz bath rather then my small cramped bathtub is helping as well as I can clean much better.

Listen to my advice:
</p>
<p>
Looks exactly like mine did at that time. Keep in contact with your post op care provider and don&#39;t engage with this subreddit. If you wanna know what ur results will look like 2 months from now check my profile. Save yourself the stress, nothing is wrong here.
</p>
<p>
People telling you it&#39;s necrotic are actually insane

Omg thank you so much! I did take a look and your results look great 2 months in. I can say that I am already seeing a huge improvement on my end.
</p>
<p>
I think it&#39;s normal to see only extremes one way or the other so anything that is not great results right off the bat is seen as needing immediate medical attention. So it&#39;s very comforting to know this is not the case.
</p>
<p>
Much appreciated and congratulations to you!
