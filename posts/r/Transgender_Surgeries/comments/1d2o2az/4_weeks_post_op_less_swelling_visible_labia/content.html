For context, I follow some cis labiaplasty subreddits. I glanced at the sub and title for a bit then clicked on the picture.
</p>
<p>
Thought &#34;oh it&#39;s swollen but healing nice hm wait I thought this was on the trans sub... no the title said minora it&#39;s probably a minora plasty, wow it sure looks like mine though, odd her majoras look swollen too tho&#34; clicked into the comments and saw my mistake. So congrats, I dead ass saw the sub and then your pussy convinced me I must&#39;ve misread. ðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also got a Banksy. Tbh this looks pretty much like mine did at 4 weeks. Minora detachment is really common especially at the posterior &amp; especially if the starting material is circumcized.
</p>
<p>
Most other surgeons don&#39;t even attempt to do what he does at the posterior. I hope eventually some people post fully healed results because it&#39;s really something I&#39;ve never seen elsewhere. At the same time, I don&#39;t wanna post mine so I get it. ðŸ«£
</p>
<p>
I had a small amount of detachment near the posterior twice, the first was a bit larger and he sewed it up. The second was smaller and it healed on its own. Now you can&#39;t even tell except that there is a tiny bit of hyperpigmentation (a brown spot basically, looks like a birth mark). If it doesn&#39;t heal the way you want it to, you can always get it fixed in revision, though for me I won&#39;t have to.
</p>
<p>
Dilations will be hard for a couple days but don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll be back to your usual soon. Try not to let the drop of being home &amp; missing the Ratt get to you. It&#39;s a marathon but normal life does return again eventually.
</p>
<p>
Until then have fun with those clit stitches huh ðŸ¤¡

I had a few revisions as well, I think basically everybody does since he gives them out like candy. They all healed okay in the end.
</p>
<p>
Anyway it&#39;s looking great for 1 month post op. With time everything will finish healing just fine I&#39;m sure :)
