I have tried researching this, but there aren&#39;t too many articles or cases I found. I have a pretty jacked up mouth due to doing the bare minimum in maintaining myself for a decade. Was curious if there were some specific dentists to speak with for something like veneers or some case studies to send to my dentist to read.

Those were the two articles i found. I feel like with all these people getting ffs, your teeth should be considered a major part of that.

Americans are obsessed with teeth. Having had braces, there are minor things an Ortho can do shaping teeth without getting into veneers, but they are still attached to the upper and lower jaw, which as we know, does take on gendered qualities.

There is no such thing as feminine teeth, they’re just teeth. Dentists however can improve your smile which can help with your overall appearance

thats just not true...women and men have very different tooth layout and size and shapes are quite different by gender as well &#34;In general, the overall effect this difference would have is that men&#39;s teeth will look bulkier and squarer while women&#39;s teeth will appear more long and slender.&#34;

There is a difference based on a number of studies. Women&#39;s teeth on average tend to be more rounded and less square, the size tends to be smaller, canines look different.
</p>
<p>
My current teeth are pretty obviously male besides them being jacked up. Are there women that have similar teeth? Probably, but they are in the minority.

There may be a difference but it’s so small that it really makes no difference. How many times in your entire life have you looked at teeth and thought they looked like mens/womens teeth?

That is true but i do notice if someone&#39;s teeth are too large/square or appear buck toothed. Its not considered attractive for women especially. Maybe i am unusually critical due to dislike of my own teeth.

Some studies have noted that mens teeth are slightly larger, but that is functional size not necessarily ratio and perception of a feminine smile vs a masculine smile.  Which is fairly debated between any two people.
</p>
<p>
I think what most would agree on is its ideal to have nice teeth that are in good health and relatively straight.  Women are often expected to look nice and teeth are included in that part of the image.  Should they need to, absolutely not.  But perception of others is part of culture to some degree.
</p>
<p>
For getting your teeth fixed up there are many different options.  Just be aware that many are not permanent.  Example veneers and crowns have a lifespan of around 10 years before replacement may be needed.  Also you need to be careful you are getting the right fix.  Some ortho&#39;s will recommend &#34;veneers&#34; only to grind you tooth down to a stump and actually give you a crown (which is weaker over time and a very poor option if your teeth are healthy enough to not need crowns.

How does this have negative karma? This is great information that will help shape my transition and expectations! I am not stealth and will make sure my future dentists know I’m trans so they know what to expect.

I think there comes a point at which you have to say &#34;close enough&#34;. If your teeth are crooked, go get them fixed, but if you have perfectly nice teeth, worrying about girl teeth seems to be a waste of the few prescious seconds we have on this earth.

I just had all of my teeth ripped out and asked them for female teeth and they&#39;re going to do it the only ones that probably won&#39;t look right would be the front bottom ones that they&#39;re going to keep

A female dentist was about to retire or move on from my dental provider and had already minimized my canines previously for free.
</p>
<p>
So on her last day there she reduced and rounded my 4 upper incisors (actually crowns) so that my my top front 6 were of similar length and roundness at the corners. I definately had sexually dimorphic teeth and she was kind and helpful and appreciated both times what she was doing for me with the contouring.
</p>
<p>
In a month my orthodontist will be slightly narrowing my 4 bottom incisors so that they will all fit straight between my repositioned lower canine teeth. Not a lot of difference, but the straitening and the narrowing will be more feminine than before. 6 months back the bottom teeth more dramatically looked a jumbled mess of problems. After they go through this reduction my mouth will go into the final phases of the treatment.
</p>
<p>
I have saved an article titled &#34;Considerations for treating transgendered patients&#34; from Aesthetic Dentistry Today, April 2018 discussing the differences of gender typical teeth and &#34;considerations in evaluation and the care and treatment of cosmetic dentistry transformations for transgender patients&#34; in particular.
</p>
<p>
I found it with a google search.
</p>
<p>
There are 14 photographic illustrations of masculine and feminine teeth.

There could be more since &#34;cosmetic dentistry&#34; and transgender in google could find a few more and perhaps much nearer you with that phrase and your closest state names. Inquire by phone whoever may fit that to see if they may be receptive.

This is really dumb, you&#39;re not going to get clocked because your teeth don&#39;t have the perfect female curve, I don&#39;t know who gave you these brainworms but please move on with your life.

More like since I need to redo my teeth anyway, i would prefer they look right. Why have masculine teeth if given a choice otherwise?

There&#39;s not really much of a noticeable difference, I think it would be better to focus on the big stuff rather than waste money on fixing that which is almost certainly unnoticeable, even a dentist if you met them and you passed perfectly they wouldn&#39;t even clock you based on square teeth.

I dunno my mom has big teeth like I do... My dad has smaller teeth...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen women with both large and small teeth and it depends on Ethnicity or mix and all sorts of things... But It rarely has anything to do with your sex or gender....
