New Sub Rule

It&#39;s been bought to my attention that there&#39;s been a lot of sexually suggestive comments/complements on some posts, and that its making some of us uncomfortable. This is not about discussing sex, but making sexually suggestive comments aimed at other members. I&#39;ve been though a bunch of posts and I agree.
</p>
<p>
I do ban a large number of cis people making sexual comments, but have been leaving the trans people alone on the assumption that they are being supportive. However I often have to look at the post history to understand the context of some comments, and I shouldn&#39;t have to do that.
</p>
<p>
These comments have been steadily increasing, and we need a minor course correction in the sub before it gets out of hand. We don&#39;t want people afraid to post here.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t leave low effort suggestive comments like these.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Nice
</li>
<li>
Daddy
</li>
<li>
Looks hot
</li>
<li>
Gorgeous
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It might not sounds like much, but I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re a chaser and nor can the OP.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s plenty of trans subs where such complements, and more, are appropriate,
<a href="/r/GoneWildTrans">r/GoneWildTrans
</a>
(nsfw) for example.
</p>
<p>
<strong>

This is a surgery sub so lets keep it clinical.

I welcome discussion on this topic.

In my experience, all other trans surgery subs I&#39;ve been in have this rule, and it works well. Discussion is clinical and not sexual.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t know how to compliment someone without being sexual then maybe you should check yourself. You can tell someone they look great without a drool emoji or asking them to &#39;punish you&#39;.
</p>
<p>
Some of these posts are coming up with replies like they&#39;re DMs in grindr..
</p>
<p>
Good shout to moderate it.

I think though that it&#39;s important to distinguish &#34;sexual comments&#34; from &#34;comments about sex&#34; - discussions on sexual function in a post about GRS should be entirely on-topic, as long as it&#39;s posted with an educational tone and not a horny-on-main tone

I heard about this rule against sexual compliments. What if it was about the organs themselves and not about attraction.
</p>
<p>
Example: Trans woman shows picture of vaginoplasty that looks very accurate. Other trans woman who is pre op makes compliment (ex. &#34;Nice Vaginoplasty, I&#39;ll like to get one just like yours) regarding the picture. It is a compliment and expression of gratitude that the person got such a successful surgery, rather than just being creepy.

If the mods have to look in your post history to work out if you&#39;re a chaser or not then the comment is not acceptable.

<p>
That&#39;s already not acceptable. Rule 1. Any kind of harassment is not ok, but people getting into arguments over things is one of those things that&#39;s a bit hard to moderate. There&#39;s no clear line, and I tend to leave it to downvotes to settle it.

Nice and gorgeous, could be meant either way.  Sometimes we just want to compliment someone quickly.
</p>
<p>
It might be some amount of effort to get people to stop making low effort posts that have good intentions.  It might take a bit of mod effort to remove those posts.

It‚Äôs not always the intent that‚Äôs the problem, but how it can be interpreted.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it‚Äôs are already causing moderation problems, I just didn‚Äôt realise what the underlying issue was until this came up. I usually review every comment in this sub and mostly it‚Äôs easy, but for these unless I recognise the name I have to go through their post history work out what‚Äôs going on. Often these comments are by cis men who‚Äôs post history is full of comments on porn subs. Those are easy, I just ban them, but there‚Äôs many that are not so clear.
</p>
<p>
A fair number of the trans people making these comments rarely post in this sub, and with some you have to go back a long time to even work out if they are trans or not. There‚Äôs no need for any of this.

That&#39;s good to know
</p>
<p>
I know BPT has something they call country club posts.  Only approved members can comment.  What if this sub has something similar? So it&#39;s still open for anyone to post, but limits those who can comment to trans people? And I wonder if this takes mod action or if a member flairs their post it can happen automatically?
</p>
<p>
You were already considering flairs, right?  Just some ideas.
</p>
<p>
But good to know where most of the comments like that are coming from.

Trans people are also the problem. Not everyone appreciates these comments directed at themselves when they are posting here. So having approved posters is not going to work, and it would cause all sorts of other problems.
</p>
<p>
Some trans people like these comments and post in trans porn subs instead of here, and there‚Äôs quite a few trans people who comment on them. I pick up links for the wiki from them, but there‚Äôs very little technical discussion in those subs.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea for this sub to drift in that direction. At worst it‚Äôs boring here, but if you‚Äôre here because you want surgery I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an issue.
</p>
<p>
One of the strengths of subs on reddit is that there‚Äôs some narrow interest groups that really focus on particular topics. The HRT groups for example. Hence rule 4 about keeping things on topic.

Does it make sense that for many people, it&#39;s just a matter of being polite? Like, my doctors have said my surgeries look good or nice. So I think when some people post their pics, many comments are just being supportive.  We all know surgeries require a great deal of ourselves.
</p>
<p>
And I&#39;m not arguing that we should allow those sorts of comments, just discussing why they&#39;re often made, and trying to understand what the proposed rule would be.  If someone has a great surgical result, could we still say, omg that looks great! ?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m absolutely against any comment that&#39;s obviously lewd or sexual.  Or even uncomfortable admiration.
</p>
<p>
And also that the point of this sub is to gather useful information, including visual, about surgeries and the results.  That integrity has to stay.  However I don&#39;t necessarily see the harm in a few tasteful compliments that are intended to be polite and supportive of someone who&#39;s gone through a difficult procedure.

That&#39;s weird
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;ve had doctors look at my results and say, wow that looks really nice! And it&#39;s good to hear.
</p>
<p>
We lose a lot of context over text.  If I read just the word, &#34;nice!&#34; It wouldn&#39;t seem in that creepy south park way to me at all.  But maybe it would to someone else

You don&#39;t always get a choice. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever have one either but he was the only one around who could perform a procedure I needed. It was terrible and humiliating. üòí

That is terrible.  I&#39;ve never been in a situation where I couldn&#39;t request a Dr or nurse of the same gender.  I don&#39;t think I could do it.
</p>
<p>
I understand hidden said it&#39;s too difficult, but it&#39;s why I would like a private sub for this content.  Especially back when terfs were taking botched or difficult posts or pics and using them against trans procedures.  It&#39;s really content for only trans people.
</p>
<p>
I only have one male doctor I could trust examining me there, and that&#39;s bc he&#39;s known me since forever, even before transitioning.  I&#39;d trust him with my life.

<p>
Its because we are the problem, not the cis people. If you look at some of the recent FTM posts you&#39;ll see some fairly questionable comments from transwomen directed at the OP. Anytime you see someone who&#39;s  attractive or there&#39;s a breasts of genitals you tend to see a whole bunch of these &#34;supportive&#34; posts - but only then. If that&#39;s the only time we offer this kind of support then what does that say?
</p>
<p>
Apart from that, making the sub private would kill the sub. There&#39;s heaps of people here who post for the first time on reddit. I thought about doing it on a temporary basis when we were getting attacked, but it was handled just by extra mod attention. Reddit has cracked down on that recently so its relatively been quite lately.

<p>
In who&#39;s opinion is it tasteful?
</p>
<p>
What may be ok for one poster is not to another. Any if I can&#39;t tell the difference what am I supposed to do?
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s going to be a gray area somewhere, and I&#39;m sure its going to be a hassle, but I think its best to err on the side of caution. Hence the clinical approach.

That&#39;s your call.  I think supportive comments outnumber creepy ones by quite a bit.  And the sub is helpful for support, not just information.
</p>
<p>
The words nice, and gorgeous, are just super common words.  And if those end up being taken as inappropriate, it&#39;s going to end up where you can&#39;t say anything helpful at all.
</p>
<p>
Like, someone posts a picture of their results wondering how things turned out, and all we&#39;ll say is anatomically correct?  I think if we remove all comments regarding aesthetics, it would be a major shift in what the sub provides.
</p>
<p>
And aesthetics are a major component to our surgeries.  People stress a lot about it and it means a lot to hear that things look good from a community that doesn&#39;t really hugbox.

IMO, you seem to be missing the point about using terms like ‚Äúnice‚Äù and ‚Äúgorgeous‚Äù to compliment someone about their genitalia. For example:
</p>
<p>
gor¬∑geous /Àà…°√¥rj…ôs/
</p>
<p>
adjective: gorgeous beautiful; very attractive. &#34;gorgeous colors and exquisite decoration&#34; Similar: good-looking attractive nice-looking
</p>
<p>
The above examples are simply not acceptable under normal circumstances bc they carry a sexual connotation. Does not matter the intent when the word is used, it‚Äôs the normal meaning of those words and how that translates/is perceived when speaking about someone‚Äôs genitals. IMHO
