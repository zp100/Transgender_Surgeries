It seems that a lot of people (including some nurses) don&#39;t know what the pain and NEWS score system in hospital relates to. So here is the page with the info. This was from Parkside Hospital UK in 2021 when I had SRS with James Bellringer.
</p>
<p>
You can see from previous posts how much pain I suffered and the mental health issues that I now have. My main issues have been caused by him rushing the operation in 75 minutes and not allowing effective pain relief. I have been left with seemingly permanent neuropathic pain from nerve damage, PTSD from the way he treated me the morning after the operation and being unable to eat or stop crying for the week in hospital due to the pain.
</p>
<p>
Pain Score
</p>
<p>
0 none no pain at rest or on movement
</p>
<p>
1 mild no pain at rest, Mild pain on movement
</p>
<p>
2 moderate Intermittent pain at rest. Moderate pain on movement
</p>
<p>
3 Continuous pain at rest, severe pain on movement.
</p>
<p>
The lied on my forms when when I was crying my eyes out in pain and scared to move.
</p>
<p>
You need to be stern with them, if they don&#39;t do anything escalate it to the ward manager then up the chain until it&#39;s sorted. Don&#39;t take no for an answer or you may end up with PTSD, still be in pain 11 months later and wishing you never woke up !
</p>
<p>
My friend just had surgery with Ms Rashid at St Georges and was given a PCA of fentanyl for 2 days then oral morphene until discharge, then Tramadol. His excuse of constipation is complete bo//0cks and he just seems to enjoy leaving us in pain.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m back at Parkside soon for a revision with Ms Rashid (Bellringer did a cr@9 job) and while I am a lot more optimistic about her manner, closing technique and pain control I&#39;m still terrified of being left in pain again. He is not allowed in the same room as me and I&#39;m staying awake during the revision as the thought of going under general anesthesia again terrifies me.
</p>
<p>
Forewarned is forearmed.

It sounds like you went through something horrendous! I&#39;m so sorry to hear that you had such a bad experience! I hear about a lot of bad experiences with Bellringer on this sub.
</p>
<p>
I completely agree with you on advocating for yourself while in hospital. All the staff are so accustomed to patients and suffering that they just ignore it. They just ignore patients screaming in pain. I think blocking it out is a survival tactic because if they let themselves feel the suffering of their patients every day they wouldn&#39;t be able to carry on. So you have to keep pestering them for pain relief -- the key thing is to get the doctor to approve a ton of pain relief as soon as possible and preferably for it not to just be on demand but regular, e.g. oxycodone every 4 hours. The nurses are restricted to only give you what the doctor has approved for you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had some invasive procedures under just local anesthesia also no anaesthesia and it&#39;s really hard to endure. One was traumatising. None of those procedures were nearly as serious as a vaginoplasty revision. My body just starts to panic. I don&#39;t know if your body will do that, but I would strongly urge you to reconsider not going under general anesthesia. I am feeling afraid for you right now.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re dead set on using only local anesthesia then I would definitely recommend a ton of meditation and calming breathing practice every day between now and then. That&#39;s the only way I got through when I had only local anesthesia. Also, keep your focus on other things as much as you can. If you notice yourself visualising what they&#39;re doing, then make yourself open your eyes and look and focus on what you can see. Visualising what they&#39;re doing makes things waaaay worse. Keep your mind focussed on other things (preferably on breathing slowly into your belly, but it can also be on things that you love or have a great interest in). It sounds easy, but it&#39;s much much much harder when you&#39;re in the operating theatre.
</p>

Best of luck! üçÄüíú

Thank you for taking the time.
</p>
<p>
I started freaking out / having a panic attack as they were trying to get me to go under the first time, it took ages and got to the point I wanted to stop but I couldn&#39;t function enough to say anything. The drugs just didn&#39;t put me under quickly then they held a mask on my face, I&#39;m not going through that again ! For some reason they gave me adrenalin to wake me up in recovery as well, that wasn&#39;t nice at all.
</p>
<p>
The revision is for scar removal, internal examination under anesthesia and episotomy so it&#39;s not a complete Vaginoplasty. I will be having a spinal block and some mild sedation, I&#39;m assuming diazipam or something but I won&#39;t know until I talk to the anesthetist on the day. The new surgeon is fine with my request and understands the reasons. The only thing she won&#39;t let me do is watch.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m taking my own Tramadol, Codine, Zopiclone and Diazipam (plus my usual Paroxetine for PTSD and Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain) with me so that if they refuse to give me anything post op I can sort myself out. I will add that I have had them available for months and have hardly touched any of them, I&#39;m not a drug addict, I just don&#39;t trust nurses or doctors to deal with my issues any more especially regarding pain or mental health.

Oh my gosh, that sounds horrendous! I understand why you don&#39;t want to go under again.
</p>
<p>
It makes sense that she doesn&#39;t want you to watch!
</p>
<p>
Being prepared and taking in your own meds is a good idea; however (you may or may not know this) you&#39;re not allowed to administer your own pain meds while in hospital. So you&#39;ll either have to keep this a secret and be very discrete (which is risky because if you&#39;re out of it you could end up taking too much or have gaps which are too long) or you just be up front and show them the prescription labels (only good if they say to take every x hours or y times per day, not very helpful if they say &#34;as required&#34;) and allow them to give you the meds every x hours. If you&#39;re feeling crappy then it can actually be really helpful if they&#39;re keeping track of time for you so that you don&#39;t get behind on the meds.
</p>
<p>
I know that you can manage your pain and meds well and better than they can. Unfortunately they do have very strict rules in place about this sort of thing (mainly to protect patients as most wouldn&#39;t be able to manage it well).
</p>
<p>
The best thing is to get the doctor to put regular pain relief on your chart (i.e. every 4 hours). You can even discuss it before the operation. Once it&#39;s on your chart then the nurses have to do it. Most of the problems come about when the pain meds are &#34;as required&#34; or the regular pain relief isn&#39;t sufficient. As many nurses are overworked, disillusioned and ignore suffering, getting them to give you meds &#34;as required&#34; is difficult and they cannot give you pain meds that a doctor hasn&#39;t authorised.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like you know what you&#39;re doing and you&#39;ll be well prepared! I really hope it goes well!
