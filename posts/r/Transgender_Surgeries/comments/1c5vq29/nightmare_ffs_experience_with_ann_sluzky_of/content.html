I had surgery with Ann Sluzky on March 12th 2023 in Yerevan,  Armenia. The procedures were feminising rhinoplasty, frontoplasty  (forehead reconstruction), tracheal shave and a v-y upper lip plasty.  Sluzky is known to often use facial implants but I did not have any. For  those who aren&#39;t aware of her history Sluzky is a Russian surgeon who  left Moscow following the Russia, Ukraine war. Her full name in Russian is Анна Вадимовна Слуцкая - I share this as any searching under the English translation will omit reviews from Russian surgeon review websites that I was unaware of prior to undergoing FFS with her. Russian doctor review websites all appear to require the full name including middle name/s.
</p>
<p>
Prior to my surgery with Ann Sluzky I had given FFS a massive amount  of consideration over 10 years. I had done a virtual assessment with  Alexandra Hamer of Virtual FFS, whose advice I think is invaluable to  our community. I had also consulted with FacialTeam Spain, both online  and in Marbella. I had joined FFS social media groups. Bought and read  the Ousterhout FFS book that&#39;s now out of print and also read just about  everything I could find online. I had talked to friends in person and  online who had already done FFS and I even chatted to a patient of  Sluzky. I had a pretty good idea of what procedures I wanted and what  procedures I didn&#39;t and why. Despite that it&#39;s a life altering surgery  and I don&#39;t think anyone could honestly say they weren&#39;t scared of  undergoing it. I was.
</p>
<p>
Communicating with Sluzky was difficult from the get go. She didn&#39;t  have a manager at this time and was living in Israel whilst operating in  Armenia. She often ignored messages or didn&#39;t answer questions. At this  point I got the impression she was somewhat eccentric and blunt but I  liked her results and her use of modern technologies and her lack of  aggressive marketing made her seem honest so I decided to overlook the  shortcomings of her online communication at that time and where she was  working from. She seemed a good surgeon, and her patients seemed happy -  that was what actually mattered, not slick branding or being adept at  social media. I eventually got a video consultation with Sluzky, who  loaded up my CT scans in a computer imaging software to manipulate in  real time. Sluzky explained some things and said that despite my sinus  anatomy being only present on one side of my forehead (this occurs in  around 10% of patients so not extremely rare) she would still do a type 3  reconstruction across both sides &#34;for stability&#34;. FacialTeam Spain had  also told me they would do exactly the same thing, in order to  &#39;guarantee stability&#39;, so I was reassured by the consensus regarding  that physical abnormality. I felt this initial consultation was good and  I had not been terribly impressed with my other consults so I decided  to go ahead with Sluzky. Following consultation, after sending many  messages and being about to give up on her as an option I finally got a  response to asking for a possible date to arrange FFS. The definite  hospital date itself would be arranged when we were both in Armenia and I  would pay in cash. I felt suspicious of this arrangement but  considering her prices and the situation she had found herself in with  leaving Russia I thought it seemed understandable and she had been my  first choice for surgery, irrespective of cost or location. I didn&#39;t  exactly feel confident about doing surgery in Armenia or paying in cash  but I was not the first trans woman to do so and I felt it was worth it  to finally do FFS with a surgeon I felt confidence in. I felt that if I  went with a safer choice such as FacialTeam I would probably always  wonder &#34;what if I went with my first choice?&#34;, and a face is obviously a  very personal thing. This is all to say that the comparatively low  price of Sluzky&#39;s work was not the deciding factor for me, though it  played a part in my decision making process. I was determined to make  FFS happen having waited so long already, even if it meant risking  transphobia, travelling with a large amount of cash and staying in a  part of the world that doesn&#39;t speak a lot of English that is not known  for a high quality of healthcare. The risk of not doing FFS for another  decade was a larger concern to me.
</p>
<p>
Around when I had confirmed a block of time to be in Armenia for  surgery I asked to do a video call to discuss the nose in detail  specifically as we didn&#39;t have a plan on what to actually do with it  yet. During the consult I had just been shown examples of lots of things  Sluzky *could* do to my face with little, if any, discussion of each  procedure. Sluzky responded by telling me we would decide it in person,  before surgery. I also confirmed with her the surgeries I wanted were  rhinoplasty, frontoplasty and tracheal shave. I was confident in my  choice of surgeries. I had opted to avoid lower face work having given  it a lot of thought. The benefits seemed seemed marginal, Sluzky had  concurred during consultation and the other FFS specialists I spoke to  all said similar with one telling me his opinion was that I should do  not do any chin or jaw work to preserve a nicer aesthetic. I am 185cm  tall with a slender build so a bit of length to my face matches my  overall body type.
</p>
<p>
We set a provisional date for surgery of around the 10th March. I  booked everything I needed to and let Sluzky know the details. I arrived  in Yerevan on the 7th. This was quite stressful as when we pulled up to  the AirBnB my airport transfer was stopped by police, and when we got  inside the AirBnB the WiFi password was on a website. My e-SIM wouldn&#39;t  work so we had to wander around Yerevan aimlessly until we found  somewhere that could sell us a local SIM card that morning. Once that  was sorted out I let Sluzky know I was there and there was apparently  some confusion. I think she forgot when it was I was arriving and so I  ended up being in Yerevan for a few extra days whilst Sluzky arrived on  the 10th (the day we had provisionally planned to do surgery). Before  Sluzky arrived in Yerevan I had a barrage of tests done (bloods,  ultrasound of legs, chest X-ray, ECG). I took the extra days to do some  walking tours of Yerevan that were very cool and in hindsight the only  good thing about this experience.
</p>
<p>
I met with Sluzky and had a very trying pre-op consultation in which  we re-planned which procedures we would do. I also said hello to the  anaesthesiologist who didn&#39;t respond to me for whatever reason, I later  learned he did speak English so maybe he was just in a bad mood. Sluzky  tried to convince me at this stage to change the previous plan we had in  place and to do a chin reduction in this session instead of doing the  tracheal shave planned and to consider FEMLAR and bull-horn lip lift  with her at a later date. She was *very* insistent about these things  but I didn&#39;t want to alter the plan as I had given everything a lot of  thought already and there were reasons I didn&#39;t want to do any of those  procedures. Still, it threw me to consider changing even the basic plan  so close to surgery. We went over things a bit and I had some concerns I  tried to address which even despite not sharing a first language I feel  she was needlessly obtuse about. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to blame this  on any language barrier. You don&#39;t need to share a first language to  understand when I touch an area of my nose what area I am referring to  and her English is of an acceptable standard. I also brought an iPad to  the consultation with the thought I could use the accurate photo  simulations Alexandra Hamer of Virtual FFS did for me as a reference for  my preferences. Sluzky didn&#39;t want to look at these though, so we just  used her more limited 3d modelling software. There was no discussion of  the risks of surgery at this or any point and Sluzky&#39;s simulation  seemingly could not show a reduction of the radix or an accurate  simulation of what she planned to do to my forehead. After we reached a  point where I felt exhausted and overwhelmed by all this we concluded  the consultation, with Sluzky remarking that she had never found it so  difficult to communicate with me or my mother (who was attending the  consult with me). Perhaps she did find the communication a little  difficult due to not being a native English speaker, but this was  something I would come to learn was a personality trait of hers, telling  me she had already told me things which she had definitely not already  told me, blaming me for her errors, that sort of thing.
</p>
<p>
Following this difficult consult I didn&#39;t exactly feel confident  about my surgery as I felt we had discussed things which I didn&#39;t even  want to do such as a chin reduction, lip lift, hair transplants,  FEMLAR... and given that, we had only barely managed to cover my bigger  concerns with the surgeries we actually had planned. I still felt that  the smaller things such as the many details that make up a complex  surgery made up of many sub-procedures that is rhinoplasty had not been  given adequate attention. This worried me a lot and I started to panic  and spiral. I messaged Sluzky to ask if we could go over the nose again  before surgery to which she agreed and I felt a bit more relaxed about  everything. Or at least as much as I could whilst being in a country  that doesn&#39;t respect the existence of transgender people, doing major  surgery on my face.
</p>
<p>
I gave the nose more consideration and surgery day rolled around. I  arrived early to try to ensure we had plenty of time to discuss things  and I let Sluzky know when I was at the hospital. Eventually Sluzky  arrived, I paid her the money in cash and got into the surgery pajamas,  at which point I requested we go over the nose specifically as agreed  with Sluzky informing me that the surgical team were already expecting  me. Sluzky flipped through examples using her computer imaging software  faster than anyone could reasonably comprehend and blamed me for the  situation of leaving the rhinoplasty planning to this point of everyone  waiting on me (despite my asking twice to make time to discuss the nose  specifically and her agreeing - I still have the messages). I had to ask  her to slow down the computer slides and I did my very best to ensure I  was comfortable with what would be done to my nose whilst being aware  of the limited time pressure, not wanting to disrupt my surgery  happening. Sluzky made it very clear she was frustrated by this  situation and audibly sighed a few times which was obviously very  distressing for me. I couldn&#39;t quite believe this person I believed to  be an accomplished surgeon was behaving like this, she hadn&#39;t bothered  to make the time to discuss the rhinoplasty and didn&#39;t even seem to give  a shit about making sure we planned it properly. At my insistence we  very briefly went back over lowering the bridge, removing the dorsal  hump, reducing the radix/nasion area, rotating the tip upward, narrowing  the tip &#34;a bit&#34; and preserving the supratip break I had. I wasn&#39;t even  close to 100% on all these things or the degree to which we would do  them due being pressured to make a rushed decisision but I did agree to  them. Crucially though, we *did not* discuss reducing the nasal  columella (which is the area between the nostrils) at all. As I think I&#39;ve explained here, I did my best to try to  engage with the process of planning this rhinoplasty, but it&#39;s a  collaborative process so both parties have to be diligent, each  sub-procedure should at least be verbally noted. Had Sluzky been so  boarish and unprofessional prior to the day of surgery I think I would  have bailed.
</p>
<p>
As I walked toward the operating room, Sluzky pulled out her phone  and said we would make a video. Overwhelmed and terrified I just went  with it as she asked me on camera what I was about to do (I think I  responded broadly by saying &#34;facial feminisation surgery&#34; and I may also  have also listed the major procedures). She would upload this to  Instagram along with a video taken during my surgery which I obviously  couldn&#39;t consent to as I was unconscious, before and after photos were also uploaded without consent. I walked into the operating  room and lay down with a massive sense of dread that I would wake up  with a botched rhinoplasty but at this point, having travelled, paid,  already prepared for surgery and with the prospect of potentially never  fulfilling the long held desire to have FFS should I back out now I went  through with it. I was not asked if I was comfortable with what was  about to happen, nor was the entire list of procedures and sub  procedures run through with me which would have been another chance to  avoid mistakes. Instead, this surgeon was only interested in farming my surgery for social media content.
</p>
<p>
I woke up later in the day, with a pretty bad tension headache. I  recall seeing some kind of metal corridor above me and saying I  shouldn&#39;t be awake and that my head hurt, next I recall being properly  awake in my hospital room and my mother and some nurses being there. The  surgery itself didn&#39;t seem to really bothering me at all just the  headaches I&#39;d gotten throughout my stay from how stressful this  experience had been. I took some selfies as one does and let people know  I was awake. Sluzky had left by then and there had been mention of some  painkillers I could have, so thinking I ought to try to get some rest  for the night I asked for them and as soon as the nurses gave me them  and turned off the lights in my room I vomited. Annoyingly, the nurses  had just taken the sick tray away for some reason so I did my best not  to make too much mess. I was concerned about whether or not immediately  vomiting was a problem for the rhinoplasty and in trying to be fair in  talking about this I would be remiss not to mention that when the nurses  contacted Sluzky on my behalf to check if there was any reason for  concern she visited the hospital and even went with my mother to the  supermarket opposite the hospital to try to find me yogurt she thought I  should try to eat. I&#39;m not sure why the hospital didn&#39;t have any food  available.
</p>
<p>
I left the hospital the next morning after a short checkup with  Sluzky and walked back to my AirBnB which was on the same street as the  clinic. I felt like a loose sack of jumbled up bones. Over the next few  days having bandages removed I realised my upper lip looked very long  now, it was already slightly long before surgery but now it looked even  more so and I thought the tip of my nose was looking pinched and weird. I  felt extremely worried and upset that under the cast my nose may be  entirely disproportionate to my face as I had lost all confidence in  Sluzky as a surgeon, the experience had been so shockingly  unprofessional, I hadn&#39;t felt what I wanted mattered and I had been  rushed through the decision making process. I would learn a year later  that the reason my upper lip looked much longer was due to a nasal  columella reduction I never even had the opportunity to discuss as it  was never mentioned to me. I did not and do not want to do a bull-horn  lip lift as 3 FFS specialists and 1 dentist advised me a shortening of  the upper lip could look strange due to my existing prominent upper  teeth show so reducing the columella compounds a facial masculinity I  shouldn&#39;t even try to resolve with a bull-horn lip lift. Sluzky was the  only one to have disagreed with that consensus and I also think she is  mistaken. My &#34;rabbit&#34; teeth were something I was bullied for growing up  until I grew into my features. I wouldn&#39;t want to return to looking like  that.
</p>
<p>
During these early days of recovery I also noticed my brow felt  lumpy and uneven and even at this early stage with all the swelling it  seemed there was a big dent in it. There seemed to still be bossing between  my eyebrows and I felt my eyes still looked somewhat hooded by my  orbital rims. I was very upset by everything, extremely tired from  hardly sleeping the entire trip due to worry and my thoughts became  somewhat dark. I catastrophised due to the circumstances surrounding my  surgery. I had the irrational feeling of wanting to rip this new nose  off my face to undo it all and cried a lot privately. I worried I had  made a massive mistake with this surgeon and was terrified of what the  extent of the outcome could be.
</p>
<p>
I dealt with the physical recovery stuff as I think most do, it  wasn&#39;t bad at all, just uncomfortable. I think my throat actually hurt  the most. I had been given some medication to use by Sluzky after  surgery, antibiotics and such but no direction on what to take and when. I had stopped taking the painkiller:  ketoprofen (an NSAID) on day 3 as it seemed to cause my nose to bleed  excessively each time I took it which worried me. I met some other trans  women undergoing FFS with Sluzky who were nice but we didn&#39;t spend much  time together. One of them mentioned the chaotic nature of  communication around surgery and we shared notes on what we thought we  were supposed to be doing re. recovery but they still seemed happy with  things. So I tried to be positive around them.
</p>
<p>
I would attend daily checkups with Sluzky for a few days in which  she questioned why I looked sad as if her behaviour immediately prior to  surgery was totally normal. I asked how the forehead operation had been  performed and Sluzky confirmed she had used a combined type 1 and type 3  reconstruction as I suspected contrary to what we had discussed prior  when she said she would use type 3 reconstruction across both sides of  my brow. She seemed surprised by my asking if a combined approach had  been used. After a few days Sluzky left Yerevan and her surgical  assistant Edgar [?] took over the care and discharge. I was told  stitches are all removed on day 10 but as I had a flight booked Sluzky  decided we would try to remove them earlier, so on day 8 Edgar removed  my nose support and all the sutures from my nose and scalp. I recall  flinching excessively as these things were removed even though they  didn&#39;t really hurt. I suppose I just felt completely unsafe at this  point. When he was done he told me I could now examine my new nose for  the first time. I walked over to the mirror to try to assess the  situation and he asked me what I thought of the nose. When I turned  towards him to answer I noticed that he was filming my reaction on his  phone. Again without consent. I said that I didn&#39;t know how it would  turn out. I thought I looked freakish honestly but I was prepared to  look weird at this stage of rhinoplasty recovery and I was taken aback  by the privacy intrusion during such a vulnerable moment. It seemed such  a creepy thing to do. I assume if my reaction had been positive it  would also have ended up on Instagram. Edgar told  me that &#34;we [himself and Sluzky] have done a great job&#34; which alarmed me a bit as I thought I had paid Sluzky to do my FFS, not this random guy she had found to assist her whose qualifications I know  nothing about. I was told that my inability to breathe through my right  nostril at all at this point was just due to swelling. Edgar tried to  take my forehead compression bandage away until I informed him Sluzky  herself had told me to wear it for a month whilst I slept, but I only  had the one compression bandage I had already been wearing for a week. I  was not told when I could wash my hair so I just washed it right after I  got back to the AirBnB which I later learnt from another patient I  wasn&#39;t supposed to do. It struck me as very poor that the person doing  my discharge wasn&#39;t even aware of the advice to wear the compression  bandage for a further 3 weeks but this reflected the standard of care  throughout. If I didn&#39;t ask questions or repeatedly chase things up I  was on my own.
</p>
<p>
I travelled home 9 days post op. I had a letter for the Armenian  flight security that lied about why I was bandaged up and looked  different saying I had a traumatic deformation of the skull corrected,  this was to avoid issues flying home. That was the only documentation of  the procedures I left Armenia with. I had no trouble from the airport  security and besides a couple of insignificant incidents I had no  trouble with Armenians whilst I was there. The nursing team didn&#39;t seem  to bat an eyelid at me for being transgender either. I had intentionally  travelled under a male passport and tried to boy-mode to avoid problems  travelling. I&#39;ve heard of LGBTQ abuse being prevalent in Yerevan but I  guess I passed as cis male as I had also cut my hair short prior to  surgery. We flew via Warsaw which was a bit scary considering the  political situation but I had no problems there either.
</p>
<p>
On returning home I felt relief that at least I could feel safe  again. I finally caught up with sleep and acquired some more compression  bandages to use on my forehead. I didn&#39;t bother to ask Sluzky about  acquiring bandages because asking her for anything was more trouble than  it was worth so I mostly just figured stuff like that out for myself.
</p>
<p>
I had 2 friends I talked to around this time who had both already  been through FFS with different surgeons. I listened to their advice  about trying to be patient and not judge my results too early but I  started to become quite depressed and withdrawn as weeks progressed and I  felt the likelihood of needing revision was very high. I looked strange  and swollen as most people do early in recovery, which is very  difficult in itself. I also experienced a lot of shock hair loss, but  even as the swelling started to reduce and I recovered things still  looked wrong. I noticed a visible dent above my left eye, I was very  uncomfortable with how my nose looked but couldn&#39;t put my finger on  quite why and I realised I still had brow bossing between my eyebrows. I  also had noticeable tracheal shave scar adhesion due to her using an  anterior (over the surgical site) approach as opposed to the more modern  sub-mental approach (tunnelling down to the surgical site) which avoids  that complication. I had some further communication with Sluzky  regarding some issues with the coronal incision not closing for a couple  months and pain above my left eye I was experiencing.
</p>
<p>
Around the 3 month mark I asked Sluzky for my surgical report (a  report of everything that was done surgically) as I expected to want to  consult with another surgical team for revision and thought it wise to  get hold of this document sooner rather than later considering how  disorganised she is. Sluzky made this standard request that I understand  is typically granted without question unnecessarily difficult and tried  to bargain for photos and updates of my recovery in exchange for the  document. Despite having stating that I did not want a discussion, only the report. I calmly explained my issues with my results so far and the  serious concerns I had with the planning of my surgery. Sluzky responded  completely ignoring all of this, saying that she was confused why I want my  surgical report as the only thing I had told her was that I have post-op  depression and asked for photos again... Eventually after a month of  back and forth of this unprofessional nonsense I finally got the  surgical report which again confirmed the combined type 1 and 3  approach, though contained very sparse detail of the major procedures  with no mention of any materials used or sub-procedures and omitted the  V-Y lip plasty procedure which was something Sluzky had thrown in for  free. The report also mentioned septoplasty which wasn&#39;t planned - I&#39;m  not sure whether this was actually performed or not. I had no further  contact with Sluzky after I received the report at 4 months post op and  so all the worries I had, such as how breathing through my right nostril  has remained intermittently compromised for this first year of recovery  are things I went through without professional advice as I no longer  considered her at all trustworthy or competent. At this point  interactions with Sluzky had just become a cognitohazard.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to a year post surgery I consulted with a well regarded  FFS team who confirmed the dent in my forehead bone structure via CT  scan, which they referred to as a bone defect, along with what they  thought to be a hole through to my sinus cavity. I learnt that my nasal  columella had in fact been reduced without my knowledge or consent. When  I mentioned having a partial type 3 reconstruction they strongly  refuted this as they did not consider the technique Sluzky had used to  resemble a type 3 reconstruction at all. I was also able to confirm that  the forehead feminisation was incomplete with their specialist  analysis. Whilst I do look less masculine post surgery I am still  misgendered most of the time even before speaking, even with long styled  hair, form fitting clothes, laser hair reduction and electrolysis,  eyebrow shaping, a push up bra and many years HRT under my belt. Even  with a medical-mask covering everything but my upper face. Sluzky had  not set back the forehead at all, only removed the prominences directly  above my eyes so I still have bossing between my eyebrows and my orbital  rims were only thinned, not shaved from below as many FFS surgeons do  to open up the eyes to have them meet cis female averages. Anyway, the  result is that I still read as androgynous. I already read as  androgynous pre-op so the surgery has had essentially no real world  effect on my social interactions. Sometimes I get gendered correctly,  but still most often I do not. The bone defect is only mildly visible to  me currently, causing a slight depression, loose skin and a new wrinkle  above my left eye. However it was stated by the FFS team I met with  that as I get further post-op and as I age and my soft tissues  inevitably thin this could well become a clearly noticeable  disfigurement to other people. As of writing this I am 36 years old so  it is a valid concern. I also still occasionally experience pain above  my left eye, probably from the very poor bone work, and I have some bare patches of scarring on my scalp which  can be visible when I tie my hair back. I continue to have to use the  Cottle manoeuvre to clear the airway of my right nostril at times which  may indicate a partially collapsed internal nasal valve. At 13 months post-op I doubt that breathing is likely to improve much more. I feel  disgusted by the appearance of my nose as reducing the columella makes  the lower third of my face look more masculine by elongating the upper  lip and Sluzky has ruined the balance of what was a decent, albeit  large, nose pre-op. I will admit it&#39;s probably not as ugly to other  people as I see it having lived with my nose all my life but this works  directly against my goals in doing FFS. These were to feminise my  features, most importantly to do so whilst preserving my identity and  not detracting from or removing what *I* felt was attractive about my  face. Columella reduction was not a procedure I would ever have consented to had it actually been discussed with me and it was  completely unwarranted. I didn&#39;t have excessive columella show previous  to surgery and shortening the nose to this degree looks unnatural on my  long face. The tip also looks pinched and the supra-tip break that was present before surgery is gone and the nostrils are flared. The dorsal hump is straightened out but the lower part of  the nose is a mess. I wonder who even did that part of the procedure. Frankly the nose looked far better before. I still have tracheal shave scar adhesion but it has become much less  noticeable now and doesn&#39;t move around when I talk anymore so I suppose  it is no longer problematic. Possibly my vigorously massaging the area  multiple times a day to try to break down the scar tissue helped. The  mild Adam&#39;s apple protrusion I had is at least no longer present. The  V-Y procedure had very subtle effect once the swelling subsided. It  hasn&#39;t shortened the upper lip (it isn&#39;t supposed to) and it hasn&#39;t  changed the shape at all, but it has projected the upper lip slightly  which I think I prefer as this was a bit recessed before and looked a  bit harsh. Unfortunately this makes only 2 out of 4 successful  procedures.
</p>
<p>
During the recovery I had tried my best to look after myself and not  let myself become too depressed by focusing on hobbies, spending time  with family and trying to remain patient about the final result but it  was extremely hard on me and I really wish I had not done surgery with  Sluzky at all. It was not worth either the extreme stress of the surgery  experience nor the fact that I will need more expensive revision  surgeries involving grafts to reconstruct my forehead integrity,  complete the forehead feminisation and restore the function and  appearance of my nose to maybe something like what I could have expected  if the surgery had been planned appropriately. All of this burdens me  with significant extra costs, and increased risks associated with  revising surgery. It has been one of the worst things to happen to me.  For many months I would wake up half-expecting for it to reveal itself  as a bad dream and to see my old face again, masculine or not it was  still better than being landed with this mess. I felt traumatised by  this experience and became deeply depressed. I got myself on an SSRI  medication which I took for 9 months to try to protect my well-being. A  botched transgender surgery is an awful, incredibly lonely experience to  go through. I had hoped to do FFS and try to move forward with my life  as I&#39;m sure many of you understand. I felt having a male facial bone  structure had held me back from a feeling of comfort in my own body for  10 years as I tried to find a way to afford surgery and then also  delayed it due to the covid-19 pandemic. After surgery with Sluzky I  felt robbed of finally achieving this goal and my mental health reverted  back to what it had been early transition. I now lack even the level of  confidence in my appearance I had prior to surgery. It&#39;s deeply  upsetting to think about the rhinoplasty result and it&#39;s implications.
</p>
<p>
The feeling of shame over having volunteered for FFS with this  surgeon is also a very difficult thing to contend with. Even if I do  logically realise much of what happened was out of my control it&#39;s still  very hard to not feel as if I was the reason for this outcome and the  disgusting way I have been treated. As I said, it has traumatised me. As  it stands I don&#39;t currently look disfigured and I don&#39;t currently have  major functional problems but doing surgery with Ann Sluzky has made my  life as a trans woman worse. It has given me new insecurities, not  properly addressed the ones I started with, impaired my breathing and left the possibility of  disfigurement looming over me. It has put acquiring possible subsequent  interventions such as professional voice therapy or vocal surgery (my  choice would be glottoplasty over the risky FEMLAR surgery Sluzky insisted I should do) another step or 2 away from me  financially. To say I feel angry would not do the feeling justice. I do  not regret attempting to do FFS, doing surgery in Armenia, or my actual  choice of surgeries. I would choose to do FFS and these surgeries again  and Armenia itself was fine. My regret lies entirely in choosing this  surgeon. I was prepared to not always pass post-op and to still  sometimes think I looked male, or unattractive. Was prepared to battle  brain-worms and doubts during recovery and risk some smaller  irregularities or less than ideal scarring due to the nature of surgery.  However, considering the forehead and nose were the key areas I needed  to address and both are areas that would now require revision just to  repair the damage my primary surgeries caused I think it&#39;s fair to say  my FFS with Sluzky was a failure.
</p>
<p>
I have now got back in touch with Ann Sluzky to ask her if she would  be willing to refund me the cost paid for these 2 failed procedures. I  have sent her images of the CT scan, clinical photos and a report of the  findings of her medical peers which confirms a bone defect and  incomplete result of the forehead reconstruction. As I expected, on  bringing the issues to her attention she ignores anything is wrong,  instead callously mocks and gaslights me as dysphoric, verbatim: &#39;sorry to hear about your disphoria darling&#39;. She fails to even take partial  responsibility for the botching of the surgeries she and her colleague  performed and instead gives obnoxious deflecting responses that avoid  addressing the objective issues I have raised. Telling me I need to do more procedures, in spite of clearly botching the ones I actually wanted, telling me to &#34;say hi from me&#34; to the surgeons who provided the report on her shoddy work. When I directly asked if  she denies that the CT scans show a bone defect following surgery with  her she wouldn&#39;t answer. When I directly asked if she thinks I agreed to  columella reduction she wouldn&#39;t answer. Her response? &#39;Sorry I am not  going to play your games *wave emoji*&#39;. I am not even joking, this is  actually how this surgeon behaves. No accountability, no empathy and no professionalism just snide mockery and abuse. I suppose if nothing else  at least I stood up to her.
</p>
<p>
I personally understand that FFS is cost-prohibitive but  unfortunately I can&#39;t recommend anyone do FFS with this surgeon at all,  no matter how much more affordable it is to do surgery in Armenia. I  would avoid her for any surgery in fact. My opinion, as a former patient  of hers, is she lacks an appropriate level of professionalism, a  respectful attitude towards patients and seemingly the ability to do a  forehead reconstruction properly. With forehead reconstruction being  regarded as the most powerful FFS procedure this is the most important  skillset to have in FFS. Communication was abysmal. She took liberties  with my face, and didn&#39;t even know what she was doing. In terms of a  bedside manner, she doesn&#39;t have one. She was weirdly rude about my  appearance on more than one occasion (she seems to think she&#39;s funny) and is just unnecessarily rude  towards people in general. The hospital she is using for surgery badly needs repairs and renovation (the building is collapsing) and staff smoke in  examination rooms. Sluzky is no ally to the trans community - taking  money out of our pockets for procedures she can&#39;t do properly and even  making faces more masculine in the example of my botched rhinoplasty.  She seems to lack both the basic craniofacial training and knowledge of facial  proportions that someone calling themself an FFS surgeon ought to  possess. If you are unhappy with your surgery with her, or even if you  just want to consult with other surgeons about her work, well, you can  judge from my post how she may handle those scenarios. I&#39;m not sure what  this surgeon&#39;s problem is but it doesn&#39;t need to be yours.
</p>
<p>
My advice having learnt from this experience is to go to a surgeon  who can do a standard type 3 forehead reconstruction which will also  include a set back of the forehead and a shaving under the orbital rims  if applicable to your case. Don&#39;t risk the wild west of surgeons doing  hacky unorthodox things that surgeons like Sluzky call FFS techniques  but the medical consensus of the field doesn&#39;t recognise as such like  her type 3 -puzzle technique. They likely lack the ability to do these surgeries effectively using time proven techniques. FFS is a relatively young and niche area  of medicine but some standards have developed. There are studies that  show what works - the standard type 3 reconstruction works. Work with a surgeon or surgical team who use those techniques and technologies and respects the  body of research so that you at least control all the variables you  can. Don&#39;t put yourself through all this just to needlessly risk only  achieving a half-baked degree of change and/or a botched outcome.
</p>
<p>
[I have attached photos of my CT scans which show the bizarre state  of my forehead prior to doing any revision surgery on it and the fairly  mediocre level of feminisation obtained relative to what could have  been. The grey area within the dented area that looks like I got hit by a stray  golf ball (sluzky&#39;s &#39;puzzle technique&#39;) is completely recessed, a cavity or gap  of around 1-2 cm across. You can see there were no permanent fixation  materials used as Sluzky uses absorbable sutures only. If you look  carefully you can see some bone loss on the opposite side of the brow  where the type 1 (burring) was done despite being told only type 3 would  be done to avoid this occurring and if you look directly above the nose  you can see some remaining brow bossing which is most obvious in the  profile view. If you look at the upper-outer edges of the eye sockets  you can see these are still quite hooded/low as they have simply been  burred from above, not below as is commonly done in FFS. If you look at  the cross section view you can also see the central bossing that  remains. In this view it also appears that there is a hole through to  the sinus cavity. This could theoretically be a very thin area of bone  (&lt;1mm) and therefore not picked up by the CT scan but taken at over  12 months post surgery it is concerning either way]
</p>
<p>
[I have also attached a diagram which explains the relationship the  columella has to the rest of the face as rhinoplasty procedures can be  difficult to visualise]
</p>
<p>
TLDR:
</p>
<p>
* Surgeon said she would do type 3 forehead reconstruction despite  partial sinus during initial consultation, instead used a combined type 1  and 3 approach without discussion
</p>
<p>
* Surgeon rushed patient through rhinoplasty planning moments before  surgery, not making time to discuss it properly as agreed to
</p>
<p>
* Surgeon made changes to the nose without discussion, making an  already long upper lip even longer than prior to surgery (see diagram).  Not a desirable outcome in FFS as cis men typically have a longer upper  lip. This requires a cartilage graft to repair
</p>
<p>
* Surgeon and surgical assistant filmed video of patient, including  during surgery which was shared to social media without consent
</p>
<p>
* Surgeon left a bone defect / dent in patient&#39;s forehead (see CT  scans) that requires a graft from the back of the skull to repair
</p>
<p>
* Forehead feminisation was also left incomplete as confirmed by a well regarded second FFS surgeon
</p>
<p>
* Communication was abysmal and surgeon was rude and abusive,  mocking and gaslighting patient as dysphoric when legitimate problems  with evidence were raised post-op
</p>
<p>
* Surgeon takes no responsibility for any undesirable outcomes,  completely ignores CT scan evidence and report prepared by well regarded  second FFS specialist team
</p>

[Update 24/4/2024]: I have discovered Sluzky is aware of this post and is using her professional social media profile to screenshot and attack it and direct her followers to it... take the comments with a pinch of salt I guess.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/edk47vb12dwc1.png?width=273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f77aa266e866c0b26d92fb2925c7eae81a8c664a">https://preview.redd.it/edk47vb12dwc1.png?width=273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f77aa266e866c0b26d92fb2925c7eae81a8c664a
</a>
</p>
<p>
Sluzky is also using her platform to try to claim she doesn&#39;t share photos without consent so I have decided to attach receipt of having my image removed from her public Instagram profile in accordance with my country&#39;s data protection law.

I don&#39;t know where you are based but a CT scan should reveal all with regard to bone work. I paid 120 euros for this set so it can be relatively affordable. Best wishes with it all.

Because they have the trans community over a barrel so they can get away with it. The best we can do is warn each other of our bad experiences.

You&#39;re not alone in having a terrible experience with Dr. Ann Sluzky, I&#39;ve also been botched by her. I underwent FFS and experienced irreversible complications. I tried to DM you, but it wasn&#39;t possible. Please contact me when you read my comment.

That&#39;s very sad, sorry to hear it and hope you will be able to fix all the defects
</p>
<p>
I have 2 offline friends who went to Anna, I also spoke with her and consider her for second round FFS after first one with &#34;well regarded FFS team&#34;. It&#39;s very noticeable, that Anna is not good at communication. Stories she posts, the way she discusses surgeries, how she fixates on some details, this poor videos she posts - it&#39;s all very odd. Some say she&#39;s on the spectrum, I don&#39;t know
</p>
<p>
With that said, mentioned here &#34;well regarded FFS team&#34; also frequently messes up noses. Out of group of 10 girls who was in Marbella with me - 2 had bridges collapsed, 3 or 4 got infection, one still had bump 1.5 years after and my nose is not even close to what was planned and with some defects (similar to your with reduced columella, and they also haven&#39;t told me and advised against lip list that I wanted)
</p>
<p>
They say that it&#39;s important to do nose with FFS to fit it to new face proportions, but if I could do it again - I would go to the surgeon who specializes on nose jobs. It&#39;s a nasty and complicated surgery that needs special attention and someone who&#39;s really good at it
</p>
<p>
I also starting to think that all-at-once FFS that is somehow a norm maybe a bad idea. Having so many procedures done at once, by one or even several surgeons is a risky business and also spreads responsibility

Without your before and after photos it&#39;s impossible to really judge anything you&#39;re saying. I&#39;ve talked to a million girls who say they&#39;re botched and then you see the pictures and they look great. Also many things you complain about are super standard, like paying in cash, it&#39;s a bit Shocking but it&#39;s standard practice outside of Europe. The same goes with discussing every single bit of your nose anatomy, I had two rhinoplasties, never had that discussion neither. The truth is a surgeon sees you and knows what they&#39;ll do, so you just have to go with someone who you share their aesthetic views. Yes communication is somewhat strange but I believe it&#39;s just a huge cultural difference. You&#39;re expecting some american beverly hills treatment for a couple thousand bucks. I&#39;ve had many surgeries done, and I&#39;ve learned a very valuable lesson. It never goes exactly perfect, nor exactly as you wanted, ever. There&#39;s always something that heals weird or looks different etc, i really think this is just part of healing and ye, I know girls who spent 50k with FT and still feel like you&#39;re feeling... Anyway, put pics so we can see whether to take your advice. Without it&#39;s just impossible to take this seriously

You can judge the bone work if you have taken the time to educate yourself on these surgeries. I wont be bullied into posting photos I don’t want posted publicly just to prove myself to who are you to make all these bold claims exactly? I didn’t complain about paying in cash. That was made clear to me before I booked anything, that was my choice to proceed with, and on me. If you feel that my expectations were too high for a surgeon from that part of the world ok sure maybe I
<em>

stupid for not being prejudiced enough but why the push back then, I got a poor standard of care and I’m simply reflecting that in my post as you say I should have expected. Personally I think a fully functioning nose post op is a bare minimum standard as is not having defects and holes left in your forehead. FFS is still niche and many people consider medical tourism so I think providing a thorough account for people to consider is of utility. Especially when I’ve seen so many comparisons of her work to much more expensive providers.

No of course, I&#39;m not attacking you, just saying that the objective you pursue, which I assume (maybe I&#39;m wrong) is to warn other girls considering Ann (me, for example), isn&#39;t gonna be met really without photos that&#39;s all. Obvs I&#39;m sorry you had a bad experience. But I just know by now that dysphoria really makes many girls never be satisfied with results even when they look good which is why I trust more my own eyes than another girl&#39;s account. I spoke with another Ann girl who was crying for months that she was botched and she look not only not botched but actually really really good so...ye, henceforth me taking this with a pinch of salt. So far I&#39;m still going for Ann..if you want to share pics privately I&#39;d appreciate it but obvs understandable if you don&#39;t. However I must say I never miss one of her stories and I&#39;m yet to see a result I dislike so maybe it&#39;s a matter of taste. I admit not liking the super shaved foreheads they do in latin America for example, where no bone is left at all. Maybe that&#39;s your taste in which case I recommend dr ricardo morales from Colombia (he&#39;ll also ignore you like all surgeons do) but his results are maybe what you&#39;re looking for (no orbitals at all etc).

If people want to use this surgeon then that is their choice. You don’t see me commenting on the positive accounts of surgery with her disputing them or trying to discredit them or bringing up the outcomes other teams have. This was my experience in all the relevant detail I can recall. That is one of the purposes of this subreddit. If you or others take issue with that I don’t know what to tell you…

I truly believe this and I feel sorry for you. I had a consultation with her, and she was very rude and cut off the conversation without any follow up. A doctor’s result speaks for itself, but her manners and personality are just as important as a good indicator of professionalism - WHICH SHE IS NOT! Don’t go to her!

Sounds like such a mess. I would really like to see an actual picture of you though, if possible. I hate that trans people can just be treated so poorly and no one cares and no one is held accountable because we dont matter. I was strongly considering going to her when I can afford ffs, but this obviously changes things. I already had a botched tracheal shave so I am especially cautious, and some of the behaviours you describe here from her are such massive red flags. It sounds very familiar for many reasons. Its giving massive 🍇ist terf vibes. I am sorry you went through all of this.

In hindsight I would happily have abandoned the money paid and the travel expenses. Surgeons are generally an odd bunch so I extended some benefit of the doubt and then unfortunately I had no time or space to reflect on how this surgeon treated me in the moments directly before walking into the operating theatre. I lay down and felt in my gut that I was about to get botched, immediately I had a mask on my face and was out.

Reading this was challening as much as i can empathise with You not being happy with Your results You&#39;ve mentioned so many unnecessary issues like the one with transfer, being stopped by the police...
</p>
<p>
Comparing virtual ffs to 3d editing. Someone manipulating flat 2d image isn&#39;t the same as someone doing so to the 3d model with soft tissue etc.
</p>
<p>
Blaming her literally for everything.  Surgeons often advice different things when seeing someone in person.  Paying cash? Again many surgeons take cash, what are you trying to do here?
</p>
<p>
Why are You mentioning the smallest details which are completely irrelevant?
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re constantly using microagressions when referring to anything this doctor did...  &#39;Limited computer imaging&#39; while being completely happy with virtual ffs- which isn&#39;t realistic anyway...
</p>
<p>
It sounds like you hated your results before the surgery, it really sounds like you were completely against everything from the get go. You said Your forehad felt uneven from the beginning, did You keep on pressing it maybe?
</p>
<p>
It looked like You&#39;ve tried to micromanage everything, like literally everything. Sometimes when a doctor opens patient up, they have to make decisions best to their knowledge even if it wasn&#39;t what was originally discussed like You&#39;ve mentioned forehead type 1 &amp;3, from what You&#39;re saying it seems like You&#39;ve tried to control every aspect of the surgery even when you were asleep. Being overly demanding can be a tough process for the surgeon as well. You&#39;ve mentioned a couple of times that the doctor didn&#39;t explain to you what will be done to your nose, but then you mentioned how many times you went back to that discussion with the doctor.
</p>
<p>
Let me try to understand it all, she asked You for pictures and wanted to communicate with you. But you call it &#39;bargaining for photos&#39;?! And was giving her attitude rather than communicate with her and try to resolve the issue? Did she suggest correction procedure? Good surgeons offer it for free when getting something else done or just for the patient to pay for an operating theater. Did she offer any of that?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m her former patient, had ffs done with another team and she fixed a lot of issues that were made by previous surgeons. Even before I gave a chance to the original doctors to fix what I wasn&#39;t happy with, they did what they could and I moved on, found someone else who could help me achieve what I wanted. I understand that our experiences are different but why didn&#39;t You post pictures to show before and after? You shared a ct scan- how much flatter a forehead can be? Just look at it. Indentations happen to every surgeon, no need to get rude with them, but communicate and see what can be done to sort it out. It seems like You didn&#39;t do any of that, instead you refused to share pictures contacted another team rather than speak to her directly and find a common ground. If you don&#39;t want her to work on you, find someone else and move on. The extend of this review is just crazy.

The post was about my experience of an important surgery to me as I explained. It includes details that were relevant to how I was feeling and the trip in general. People post details like this all the time such as what they ate or friends they made. Your criticisms are bizarre not least because you seem to wilfully misinterpret what I have said yet criticise me for elaborating precisely to make my meaning clear. I think you are a troll, you have made a brand new account just to comment this nonsense. I’m not going to bother addressing your other outlandish statements. Maybe your time would be better spent promoting this surgeon elsewhere than desperately trying to distort my personal account of a traumatic experience of surgery in any way you can.

You can have your opinion however I&#39;ve had surgery done by Anna and Edgar and although I&#39;m not perfect I am very contented and accept my results .
</p>
<p>
I could complain about my nose not retaining its gorgeous slope somehow or my lip lift scar being worse than I&#39;d hoped or brow not being lifted enough but it&#39;s not going to alter what has been done.
</p>
<p>
From what I understand Rhinoplasty can and do regularly go wrong hence multiple revision surgeries until there&#39;s nothing left of the dorsal .
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s very easy to have huge expectations that one surgery is going to resolve all our dysphoria or make us super passable when it just won&#39;t.  Some girls are lucky with things others not so .
</p>
<p>
Within two months of my returning home from Yerevan I had already adapted to my new face and decided on my next lot of ffs surgery .  It&#39;s a gradual process that makes a larger difference .
</p>
<p>
But to say that Anna is &#34;sus&#34; or taking advantage of our community is disingenuous.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s not the easiest person to communicate with however I do believe her intentions are to do the best job possible for her patients.  She takes a huge amount of pride in her work and I listened to her advice (I wanted so much more doing)
</p>
<p>
If anything I think she over extends herself with performing long operations to get multiple procedures done simultaneously whilst keeping costs down.
</p>
<p>
She requires cash because she has to pay  the hospital for the facilities and staff on the day which can rack up with 8 plus hours in surgery and then recovery.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s actually pretty shocking being discharged the next day and walking but honestly it&#39;s way better recovery in the hotel than a hospital.
</p>
<p>
I managed to get a brow implant, rhinoplasty and lip lift,  larynx shave and cheeks lipo filled for a lot LOT less than at facial team wanted for just one procedure.
</p>
<p>
I see so much of the same experience the other girl had however I guess my take was much more realistic and positive... To be honest , I&#39;ve not been misgendered until I speak so I&#39;ll probably get Anna to do that also.
</p>
<p>
Surgery is never 100% guaranteed you just hope healing process goes smoothly and there&#39;s no complications. But it&#39;s certainly not personal !  Xxx

Disingenuous? Excuse me? I didn’t pay for a dent in my forehead and I didn’t pay to have been left with brow bossing or have things done to my face without consent. Taking money for a type 3 and doing something else.
<em>
You
</em>
can have your opinion but this post is about my experience, not yours. I think your insinuation that I was not realistic, or positive, is disgusting especially considering much of my post was about the awful experience of the surgery due to Sluzkys attitude not the results. Hard to be positive when your surgeon treats you like shit.
