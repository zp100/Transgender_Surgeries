<p>
- PIV will never be an option
</p>
<p>
- I might feel like a freak, not a real woman
</p>
<p>
FYI: I never felt attracted to men, but anal sex is something I&#39;m attracted to, so even if I happen to be attracted to men later on, that is still an option.
</p>
<p>
I fear ending up regretting it.

I’m definitely considering this option. Maybe I’ve read about too many botched surgeries but it’s hard to justify the risk and the pain when I don’t want to have piv sex. I don’t think having a zero depth vagina would make me feel like a freak, but having a penis sure does.

I think the takeaway is that women who have a vulvoplasty only, tend to be pleased with the results more than compared to women who have a full vagina created as well as the vulva.

People who select vulvoplasty only have most likely considered it thoroughly, thus know what to expect. Full vaginoplasty is the standard option and can come with its own problems.
</p>
<p>
Makes me wonder how much of an effect that has on the study result.

I’ve considered it. PIV isn’t an option for me. But I still want to be fingered. And maybe a strap on , who knows. I figure that when I do plan to get something done I would try to talk to them to focus primarily on the vulva when it comes to material to work with, then worry about the vagina. I don’t think I will need a lot of depth but a little bit of something would be nice

This is how I feel. I am fairly asexual/pansexual and I don&#39;t want to be with someone who needs to penetrate me. I would prefer to have a full-depth BUT I have to be realistic with my personal needs and vulvoplasty just makes the most sense.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice to have like 2 inches of depth, or even 1 inch for more intimate options with myself or a partner, but don&#39;t think they do more than a very tiny amount to give the external appearance of a canal.

Yeah, that&#39;s the hard part is you lose any potential partners that need a vaginal canal, but I&#39;m fine with that since fairly asexual. If I was in long term relationship, I would be willing to potential a PPT to make a canal if I can.

I think an important factor is, how far along in transition are you? If you&#39;ve just started, your gender attraction / desires might change
<em>
quite a bit
</em>
versus what they are now, so closing the door on your options might leave you feeling regret. However, if you&#39;ve been on HRT for a few years or so, it&#39;d probably be more reasonable to trust, &#34;Yep, not into PIV penetration, this is Fine&#34;.

I mean you can ask Reddit... but at the end of the day it’s your decision and yours only.
</p>
<p>
I’m going for zero depth later this year for my own personal reasons. I’m long-term married with a female partner. Our ‘play’ doesn’t involve penetration with me and we’re both still happy. I’m not interested in guys at all, never have been. I’m not interested in penetration. Given my situation and age (nearly 44) I don’t see the point of going down the full option. It’s a harder recovery and more chances of complications in surgery.  It just seems a waste for me personally to have the full surgery as I’d never really use it but zero depth will kill my dysphoria and still allow non-penetrative sexual play with my wife. But like I said... it’s a personal choice. You’ve got to do what works for you. Good luck 😉

Hi, we are in a very similar situation and thinking.  I was curious if you’ve already had your surgery, or have a surgeon?  What is your opinion today about it all?  I am just getting started in looking and am looking for resources, others who are considering to have had a Vulvoplasty (zero/minimal depth)

I only had my surgery last Friday, so just home in recovery at the moment and can&#39;t tell you too much apart from everything is okay but mega swollen and a bit painful.
</p>
<p>
Cleaning regime is pretty easy. Aqueous cream in the shower and hibbi scrub solution to clean everything before I get dressed. Told to use a hairdryer on low setting to dry everything as the quicker everything dries, the quicker you heal.

I had the minimal depth surgery done with Mr. Thomas at the Nuffield Hospital in Brighton, UK. This was free surgery on the NHS. They do take private patients as well.

Feel free to message me in a few weeks and I&#39;ll give you an update. I&#39;m not sending pictures though, not comfortable with that.

Maybe where you fall on the gender continuum might help you decide. I am binary female and there is no way that anything less than full GCS would make me feel &#34;complete.&#34; Yes, the surgery is invasive, and the recovery is challenging. But so were my knee surgeries and I survived them and moved on in life. It was the same with GCS.

I had this. My surgeon called it a &#34;minimal depth&#34; vaginoplasty.  I&#39;m 2 months post op. I have about a half inch-inch of depth. I never cared about penetration at all; my priority was to be able to look down see girl stuff. There are plenty of cis women out there who are unable to have sex involving penetration. Penetration doesn&#39;t make a woman. A vagina doesn&#39;t make a woman. True, you can&#39;t know what the future holds. But I was pretty dang confident my sex life would never involve penetration. And if something changes in the future, there are still options on the table for creating a vagina if i feel I really need to go that route. True it&#39;s not as simple as doing it up front, but I think the chances of that are so remote I felt very confident going forward with minimal depth. No regrets. Oh, and the official name of the procedure on the hospital forms I signed was &#34;minimal depth vaginoplasty&#34;. So terminology may vary.

Wow thank you a lot for your feedbackss! That is very helpful. Even if I don&#39;t want penetration, I still would like to be able to insert a yoni egg inside... maybe what I would like is a medium depth vaginoplasty?

<p>
Also, would share who was your surgeon?

I considered it, but I figured it would be safer to have a full SRS. If I decided dilation was too much of a chore, I could always stop. Better than having zero depth and regretting after the surgery is done. But to each her own, good luck.

Im 37 and had zero depth with dr. Chettawut almost a year ago. Not having a vagina has not really been an issue for me and the way that I enjoy having sex. The recovery time was a lot shorter although not as short as I have thought I feel like it took me about six months to fully recover from the procedure where I wasn’t exhausted after menial tasks like taking out the trash or standing in line at the store. Even climbing in and out of my truck multiple times a day was pretty much exhausted me. I’m not 100% satisfied with the appearance of my vulva, I feel that the doctor left too much Scrotal skin so I have kind of dangling labia. A lot of my partners have also had large labia that hang down a bit, so I don’t think that’s uncommon, it’s just that my urethra is pretty low, and I can get a lot of pee on my labia when I’m peeing. Also the doctor couldn’t do any hair removal during surgery since the scrotal skin is not excised during surgery as it is during the full vaginaplasty, so I do have some unwanted hair that I’m going to have to find a sympathetic electrolysist to take care of. I think when I have removed all unwanted hair that I’m going to seek a labiaplasty from an American surgeon, rather than returning to Thailand.

<p>
I think it&#39;s almost unthinkable, imagining it on my body makes me squeamish. Rationally I wouldn&#39;t ever take this path because I cannot know what will happen in the future and I&#39;d be way too afraid to regret the choice.
</p>
<p>
However I absolutely and without restrictions respect it as a choice for anyone else though. Each person knows their body and what they want and who they are. I&#39;d say go with your heart.

I kinda feel the same...
</p>
<p>
This srs for me would make mostly my social life more simple, more natural. My sexual life.. ? I don&#39;t know. Maybe I would allow myself more around men, and then want to have sex with one...

Remember you don&#39;t need to be attracted to men to enjoy penetrative sex. Toys, strap-ons and women who like to penetrate exist.

Ok yeah, let&#39;s talk about it. I&#39;m considering zero-depth vagino. But I have doubts, I&#39;m worried I will regret it. If I want to be penetrated, I can still go with anal sex anyways. I&#39;m not if it&#39;s relevant or not, but the porn I&#39;ve  been watching has always been : a guy with a girl doing anal sex. So maybe, even if wanted penetration, I&#39;d actually want to go with anal sex?

Sounds nice, cosmetic is important for me. Also, I&#39;m actually considering more of a-couple-of-inches-depth than an absolute zero depth. So That fingers can come in. I&#39;m worried it&#39;ll too unnatural to me if there is no whole at all.

I am in the same boat. I want to go for a vulvoplasty. Anyway I&#39;m asexual, so this is perfect for me.
</p>
<p>
Just asking if vulvoplasty is enough for a MTF legal change: I&#39;m referring to changing name and sex on documents

I know this is 5 years ago, but since unanswered.
<br>
Depends on location. Someplaces you need absolutely nothing, some places you need a court order, some you need document saying you transitioned, some need bottom surgery (I would think this would be treated the same as full-depth), some places don&#39;t even allow. Depends on where you live. Also for birth certificate where you were born. Type of documents being corrected as different places have different policies.
</p>
<p>
For me I need nothing for birth certificate (NYC) other than submitting paperwork and paying, nothing for passport (USA) other than submitting paperwork and paying, and to pay 3x and continuously contact for driver&#39;s license (KY) since they were violating my rights.

It is always possible to go back later and have a vagina created.  It isn&#39;t like you have to do this all at once or not at all.

Is this true? It seems like you&#39;d be stuck with the sigmoid colon method since you wouldn&#39;t have the equipment needed for the penile inversion technique, or?

Yes.  It is possible.  Dick or asshole is not the only material you have that can be used.

this is correct, however everything should be done right the first surgery and it is possibly you won&#39;t be a viable candidate for other options for canal in future, however this is my hope if I really feel I need in future is to PPT

Couldn&#39;t you choose to do the vaginoplasty at a later date?

Yeah this is the biggest con for people who are good candidates. Sexuality can change a bit after treatments. Hormones, this surgery. Basically, have to take that possibility into consideration and be fine with it.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s like how I take that I for some unknown reason decide I&#39;m cisgender in the future, I took that in consideration and I would be perfectly fine getting hormones and surgery even if that happened.
