I had my first revision on June 14th and had a second revision on my clitoral hood on June 28th. I flew home Friday June 30th and experienced slight swelling on the plane which seems to have created some separation. The swelling has since gone down due to Icing and keeping my legs elevated, but I&#39;m worried about the separation potentially not healing together.
</p>
<p>
I would like to know if the pocket that has been created as a result of the separation will be able to rejoin by itself or if I require intervention for rejoining.

Congrats on your revision, looks fantastic! If you&#39;re up for sharing, I was wondering if the separation you had around 11 days healed on its own or if you had to go back to Thailand for an intervention?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping to have SRS with Dr. Banks and having a complication after I leave Thailand is one of my biggest worries.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

Australia doesn&#39;t really any options, there is Dr Kieran hart, who is about 4 hours from I live but he isn&#39;t taking primary bookings till 2025... not sure he has time to do a revision.

i used manuka honey religiously when i had wound sep and it closed SO quickly, but mine was at the vag anus junction, so YMMV !!! make sure the area is clean and dry then apply honey with gloves or a q tip and cover lightly w gauze … i’d clean every time i peed or pooped and made sure to do before bed too … looks GORGEOUS btw … i’m ~ 8 weeks post op so still early
