I’m not exactly sure where I should go, I still have some time to decide and I’m pretty sure every surgeon is gonna portray themselves in the best light.
</p>
<p>
But as people who probably have some experience and seen some results, you may be able to map out the better surgeons in “my area”.

From the information I gathered and what I got from other ppl who already got their grs done.
</p>
<p>
Ive choosen to go to Dr. Markovsky, Lubos Klinikum Bogenhausen, munich. But it has the first meeting early in January, so can&#39;t say something from my own experience, yet.
</p>
<p>
He is covered by insurance not like Dr. Schaff, private Klinik in Potsdam or Dr. Morath Rotkreuz Klinikum Munich (Here it&#39;s &#34;only&#34; additional 3k €)

If being on the public healthcare is relevant, Dr Heß in Essen has operated with Schaff before and has been offering the extended method since 2016. Supposedly he&#39;s been pretty good since even before he was offering the extended method.

I didn’t learn much I didn’t already know, although I didn’t expect my internet resources to be this correct. It rationalised the thing for me and made it seem more achievable.

Well we talked about how long I would be out (4 weeks bed rest first surgery, 2 weeks in hospital, 6 weeks I can’t go to school/work, second surgery 6 days ? in hospital 2 weeks recovery) then about what actually happens during the thing and how they invert it with the urethra (they cut it open so it’s like rectangle ish line and then fold that inward into the wall of the penile inversion vagina.

Thank you. That&#39;s all the technique which is fine and well, but did you actually see the results he produced? I&#39;ve seen several of Schaff&#39;s and they&#39;re actually really good. When asked what would be the worst case of things going wrong he showed me a case that had mild necrosis at the left of the top portion of the inner labia. It still looked very acceptable though despite the resulting asymmetry. Did you ask any questions like that? I&#39;m a bit paranoid about my choice of surgeons because every revision needed might make it worse, so I&#39;m wondering whether he&#39;s as good as Schaff and what sort of mishaps can happen with Heß.

Perhaps you should if you do more consultations. My reasoning is that the more openly a surgeon talks about all aspects including the negative ones, the more you can trust them.

We did talk about complications and what he would do then, but he didn’t have any pictures.

Dr schaff looks great. I had mine with Dr Sohn and I have to admit I&#39;m kinda envious now.
