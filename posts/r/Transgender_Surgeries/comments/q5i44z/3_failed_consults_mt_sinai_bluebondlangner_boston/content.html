<p>
30-something trans woman here, 6 yrs on HRT.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m afraid to write. Folks have had good experiences with Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner at NYU and Dr. John Pang at Mt. Sinai. I don&#39;t want to burn bridges with Bluebond, since I may ask for minimal depth, but the consult was hurtful. I think Pang, Bella Avanessian (also at Sinai), and Bluebond have high likelihood of great results. I think Dr. Robert Oates at Boston Medical Center is very sus.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll go chronologically:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Boston Med Center -- March, 2017 -- Dr. Robert Oates
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was 1 yr, 5 mos on HRT, and the doorman greeted me with &#34;sir.&#34; Hadn&#39;t heard that in months, and it stood out, esp in a place w/trans patients.
</p>
<p>
Oates works w/Dr. Jaromir Slama, as I understand it, but I only saw Oates. This is a paraphrase:
</p>
<p>
&#34;...And we&#39;ll give you D-cup breasts at the same time as the vaginoplasty.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I said, &#34;I actually don&#39;t want breast implants.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Why?!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I just want whatever hormones gives me.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Him: &#34;What woman doesn&#39;t want big breasts?!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;I don&#39;t feel I need big breasts to be a woman.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;That&#39;s crazy!
<em>
Every
</em>
woman wants big breasts! Do you really want to be a woman?! Normally, we want to wait 2 years on hormones before implants, but I&#39;d do it for you right now!&#34;
</p>
<p>
This went on back and forth until he got up to leave. He told me I should think about what I want before contacting him, then handed me a card, &#34;Just in case you change your mind.&#34; Then he took another couple steps and stopped at the door: &#34;Oh, you can probably lose some weight too.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d been described as medium or medium-thin. I said, &#34;But I&#39;m well underneath the 30 BMI limit you stated.&#34;
</p>
<p>
He paused for several seconds, thinking, then looked be dead in the eye and said, &#34;Couldn&#39;t hurt,&#34; smirking. He left.
</p>
<p>
For reference, I&#39;m part Asian, and I feel like &#34;big boobs&#34; is an American standard I don&#39;t want to burden myself with, esp since my breasts are comparable to my Asian relatives&#39;. There were things Oates said I don&#39;t quite remember, but the vibe he gave me was that he had a certain &#34;look&#34; that he wanted. It felt like he had some fetish, TBH.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
New York University -- Drs. Rachel Bluebond-Langner &amp; Lee Zhao
</strong>
</p>
<p>
It took maybe 3 mos. to get from contacting folks to a consultation. I have an inflammatory disorder, but I take anti-inflammatory medication daily. I mentioned this in the patient portal, in a phone interview, in another phone interview, in a medical questionnaire online, and in the actual paper questionnaire at the hospital. I&#39;m from out of state, so it cost my friend and I like $1200 for transportation, hotel, food, etc.
</p>
<p>
A young...nurse guy? Whatever he was, he came in, and I talked to him rapid-fire for over 30 minutes, maybe closer to 40. He said my inflammatory condition would be absolutely no issue at all. He actually was
<em>
far
</em>
more concerned that I may have anal scarring. But reassured me many multiples of times I&#39;d have no issue with the inflammatory disorder, esp since I was medicated. He said both minimal and full-depth vaginoplasty was available, since I was trying to decide between them, and that I&#39;d get surgery very soon. He left.
</p>
<p>
After a long time, the door creaked open. Bluebond peaked her head in, and in the shadow behind her was Lee Zhao. They didn&#39;t step all the way in; just held the door open to lean over.
</p>
<p>
&#34;You have an inflammatory disorder that disqualifies you. There&#39;s nothing we can do.&#34;
</p>
<p>
They started closing the door immediately when my friend and I both panicked, shouting, &#34;Wait!&#34;
</p>
<p>
They finally both came into the room. Bluebond audibly huffed with a chest heave. My friend and I mentioned the previous nurse&#39;s comments, and Bluebond kept cutting us off before we could finish any sentence. I don&#39;t know if she even heard that I was medicated, because she kept talking over me loudly.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t remember exact quotes, but she then said something akin to, &#34;There&#39;s nothing anyone can do. You can never have vaginoplasty. No surgeon can do this.&#34;
</p>
<p>
My friend spoke up and advocated for me. We were both trying to wrangle Drs. Bluebond-Langner and Zhao from constantly cutting us off and leaving.
</p>
<p>
I said, &#34;I was actually thinking of minimal--&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bluebond: &#34;NO! You can&#39;t just decide on this on the spot because you can&#39;t get what you want!&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;No, I&#39;m actually not into penetr--&#34;
</p>
<p>
Bluebond: &#34;This isn&#39;t something you can decide on just because you&#39;re emotional.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Under pressure, I tend to code switch into Asian stoicism super hard, so I was dumbfounded by this &#34;emotional&#34; accusation. I tried to say, &#34;I&#39;m a lesbian, and I was thinking of minimal depth anyway,&#34; but both kept talking over me, especially Bluebond-Langer, and she was extra loud. I don&#39;t know if they even heard or registered anything I was saying.
</p>
<p>
To Dr. Lee Zhao&#39;s credit, he looked very embarrassed and bashful, like the cartoon kid who&#39;s friends with a bully but doesn&#39;t want to be a bully himself. It was like a Hey! Arnold episode or something.
</p>
<p>
We kept asking if there was really
<em>
no
</em>
surgeon that could give me vaginoplasty, and Bluebond&#39;s answers went from &#34;No surgeon&#34; to ambiguous tirades, berating us for being &#34;emotional.&#34; Finally, my friend persisted in her questioning and asked for the umpteenth time, and Bluebond
<em>
finally
</em>
said:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Okay. Yes. Yes, there may be other surgeons that can do this for you. Just not me.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I asked, &#34;So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s not impossible--that another surgeon could help?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Her: &#34;Yes, there may be another surgeon.&#34;
</p>
<p>
That just blew my mind. She really leaned in the door and said I could never have vaginoplasty
<em>
ever
</em>
, and really wanted me to keep believing that my whole life, never knowing I could have gotten help. Just seemed like typical &#34;inflated doctor ego&#34; that I&#39;ve seen countless times (particularly since it took 10 years before someone diagnosed my inflammatory condition, and bc I started transition in the Bible belt of the U.S).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Mt. Sinai -- Dr. Pang
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was interested in Dr. Pang, because he seemed to have comparable results (aesthetically, sensory, and w/overall satisfaction) as Dr. Bella Avanessian.
</p>
<p>
Right after the debacle at NYU, I contacted Mt. Sinai. Over and over again. They kept giving me wrong numbers, transferring me to the wrong people, transferring me to each other, not getting back to me, etc. I had to call
<em>
OVER
</em>
and over.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I was told to wait for a call. I had to keep calling about that call. Then I was told to wait for another call. I had to keep calling about
<em>
that
</em>
call. It took maybe 7 mos. to get a coordinator, Rebecca (they/them), who kept telling me to wait for more calls. Finally, they set up a virtual appt. w/themself.
</p>
<p>
They told me because I had Medicare (which was free), I had to switch to a Medicare Advantage PPO (which costs money, monthly) to get covered for Dr. Pang. They said I could go to two other doctors, Drs. Purohit &amp; Djordjevic, with regular Medicare, but I really wanted Dr. Pang. So I switched to a Medicare Advantage PPO via UnitedHealthCare and decided to pay like $50-$60/mo, if I remember correctly. Rebecca set a consultation to meet Dr. Pang.
</p>
<p>
By the 10-month mark, my friend and I had spent another $1200 or so--plus lost money due to my friend taking days off--to go to the consultation.
</p>
<p>
I went into a waiting room, then got called to see an in-house therapist. He was cool, and he had actually heard of my inflammatory disorder. He even taught me a couple things about it I didn&#39;t know, like which foods would be very harmful to me (I just so happened not to eat those foods, thankfully). He also was an ethnic minority and understood what I meant when I said my entire family disowned me for being multiracial and for transitioning. He was a tall guy with a mohawk, and he was baller.
</p>
<p>
After, I saw a nurse. She said, &#34;This is so weird! You&#39;re not seeing Dr. Pang?!&#34;
</p>
<p>
I was like, &#34;Wutt.&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Normally for out-of-state patients, we schedule for you to see the surgeon the same day we do bloodwork. Someone must have scheduled you like an in-state patient. We streamline two appointments into one for out-of-state, because it costs them more time and money to see us.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I went into the aforementioned numbed-out stoicism and was like, &#34;Oh, really, okay,&#34; really pleasantly. I don&#39;t really understand my own reactions, &#39;cause inwardly, I knew I was gonna lose it in the next couple days--just not right then.
</p>
<p>
The nurse did a lot of cis-splaining that was annoying afterwards, but because it&#39;s a distraction, I&#39;ll just write about it in the comments if anyone asks.
</p>
<p>
I was given no further instructions, so I called Rebecca, asking what to do. After some phone tag, they told me:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Umm, actually Dr. Pang doesn&#39;t take
<em>
any
</em>
Medicare at all, not even Advantage.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I asked about Avanessian.
</p>
<p>
Rebecca: &#34;Drs. Pang, Ting, and Avanessian
<em>
just
</em>
stopped taking your insurance. But...you can still see Drs. Purohit &amp; Djordjevic...&#34;
</p>
<p>
I was put on the hook by Mt. Sinai for 10 months. I changed from free insurance to a monthly one (with $10K deductibles for inpatient hospital stays) at Rebecca&#39;s instruction. In the end, I
<em>
still
</em>
can&#39;t see Drs. Pang nor Avanessian. And the suggestion is to consider the two surgeons that were
<em>
already
</em>
covered when everything was free.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Insurance Help? Surgeons? General Support?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Anyone know of any surgeons that would take UnitedHealthCare under Medicare Advantage PPO?
</p>
<p>
I see Dr. Min Jun takes UHC, but I don&#39;t know if that includes what I have. Does it?
</p>
<p>
Any general support or kind words? I&#39;m really socially anxious, so please be gentle.

All I can share is that everyone isn&#39;t going to have good energy with everyone else. In other words, I&#39;d keep searching. There are a lot of people that are competent at this procedure now. Find someone you&#39;re comfortable with that addresses your emotional as well as physical needs. Don&#39;t let these experiences jade you. Just consider you&#39;ve eliminated wrong choices so you&#39;re much closer now to the right one. Good luck! The perfect fit is just around the corner!

Thanks for reading and replying! I&#39;ll exhaustively search the wiki here for other options, but I just feel disheartened.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t blame Dr. Pang since I never saw him, but my main issue with Bluebond was she told me
<em>
no surgeon
</em>
could help me and that I&#39;d never have a vagina, only to change her tune when my friend stood up for me. It came across as an ego thing, that she didn&#39;t want to admit a diff surgeon could help.

YW.....I&#39;&#39;ve heard things from other people about her and her staff. You&#39;re not isolated and not the first. People have no idea what a tight rope we walk.... but these people? Well...they should know and if they can&#39;t even get the meet and greet and consultation correct, they certainly don&#39;t deserve our trust for something so important and so personal.  I have every faith it&#39;s the forces of the universe steering you in a better and healthier directuon. Keep your eyes on the prize (-;

That&#39;s great you had a good experience! No pressure to answer, but what do you like about your results? I hope you&#39;re healing very well, if you&#39;re still recovering.

Thanks for caring about me and for replying!
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, my former nurse practitioner told me that her patients who had gotten bottom surgery via Oates &amp; Slama were dissatisfied and had complications. She tried to frame it nicely, but she did say they &#34;might get better with more practice&#34; which wasn&#39;t a vote of confidence in my book. I&#39;d read before that they learned bottom surgery via videos, and a year or two later, I read someone (I think from a trans sub) confirm this, except I think they referred to the videos as YouTube videos. I did hear other Massachusetts trans folks mention that Massachusetts&#39; state Medicaid wanted local options to cut costs of sending trans folks out of state, so they found inexpensive surgeons to solve this.
</p>
<p>
In 2016-2017, when I went to Fenway Health--a health provider in Boston--their chief trans coordinator (a thin guy with glasses w/a 1st name like &#34;Cai,&#34; I think?) told me Oates &amp; Slama were comparable to the best in the country (when I brought up McGinn &amp; Bowers) and called Suporn and Chettawut&#39;s practices &#34;dirty&#34; and that they &#34;don&#39;t wash their equipment,&#34; saying that&#39;s how it universally was in Asia. (As an Asian, that&#39;s effing racist.) It sounded like Fenway and Boston Medical Center had a financial agreement.

Holy....wow. I&#39;m so sorry you had to go through all that. I don&#39;t have any advice (I&#39;m not in the US and I&#39;m ftm xD), but I wanted to offer a virtual hug because daaamn, you deserve so much better from so called medical professionals.

I had the exact same experience with Dr. Pang at Sinai. I&#39;d gone through their program to get all my letters and he examined me and set a date for surgery. The next day I get a call from accounting saying that my Medicare insurance was unacceptable. I ripped into them for allowing this thing to get so far fully knowing for like a year what my insurance status was. I told them they had better not bill me for his examination, which they did anyway. I ended up at another hospital in the city but the experience of finally having an appointment and then having it snatched away threw me into a tailspin. I had my surgery done at Montefiore, but they&#39;re not doing bottom surgeries anymore since the only urologist who did them left recently. Sorry for you, I know how frustrating nd demeaning this can be. I interviewed four surgeons as well when I started and the process sucks. Good luck!

Damn, that&#39;s terrible you went through that! I&#39;m so sorry. You don&#39;t deserve that. Very much like you, I lost about 1 year to it all, and I&#39;d gotten the impression from my last call they&#39;d known ab the insurance issue for a long time. You mentioned going into a tailspin; that&#39;s absolutely been happening with me. I hope your bottom surgery went super well and that you&#39;re happy.

Thanks. Yeah, you&#39;d think they&#39;d have some sensitivity about these things, like &#34;sorry, we fucked up. Let us assist you,&#34; whatever. But I&#39;m happy with my surgery, which followed hard on losing Pang. I hope YOU fare well in your struggles. Pity we have to pivot like this, but at least we can. Take care.

Yeah, it is frustrating I only hear of the same several docs, even though it makes sense that&#39;d naturally happen. No pressure to answer, but what led you to choose Dr. Selph? Also, thanks!

Wow that&#39;s all such a nightmare. I&#39;m so sorry 😔
</p>
<p>
Regarding your inflammatory issue, you might try Dr Mcginn. She suspected I might have IBS due to my issues with constipation, allergies, eczema, and celiac. I had to get a colonoscopy to screen for it, but she said she could still do the surgery either way. She just needed to know in advance so she could take precautions.
</p>
<p>
Not sure if that&#39;s similar to your situation, but it does point towards her being willing to work with challenging cases. Also, her whole office staff is just incredibly kind and helpful. She&#39;s in PA and has an excellent reputation. I&#39;m certainly delighted with her work!

McGinn was one of the 1st surgeons I learned about, and it seems to me she does good work consistently.
</p>
<p>
My inflammatory issue is Familial Mediterranean Fever, which is heavily localized among Middle Eastern, Sephardic Jewish, and Japanese populations but can affect other groups more rarely. It unfortunately inflames about everything that could get inflamed, incl the peritoneum, but since getting medicated I rarely feel it. It does still give me upset stomach and muscle ache, but only 1% of how bad it used to be. My arm was chomped on by a large German Shepherd as a kid, and my previous inflammation attacks felt more painful than that for much longer (3 days straight, once or twice a month). I&#39;m thankful an Iraqi doctor recognized FMF bc till I was 29, every other doc said I was making it up (this was in the southern U.S).
</p>
<p>
I did learn from the in-house therapist at Mt. Sinai that Mediterranean food ingredients can be harmful to me due to this condition, such as fava beans. He said my body didn&#39;t have the enzymes for it and that it could be toxic. I guess eating 99% candy and General Tso&#39;s all these years saved my life up to this point (jk). So at least I got that important knowledge out of that teip.

jesus, this sounds like a fucking nightmareish experience and i’m so sorry you went through such an uncomfortable and convoluted consult process. If you are local to massachusetts i would suggest checking out MGH’s trans health program. I’m from MA &amp; receiving phalloplasty with their team and do know they have a surgeon that does vaginoplasty. Also disappointed but not surprised by the rude comments made by fenway providers as well. our trans health is nowhere near as competent as MA seems to boast

Yeah, I&#39;m local to MA (though not originally). I&#39;m glad someone understands. Thank you for writing to me!
</p>
<p>
I had heard of MGH&#39;s trans program. I just switched to a new (non-surgical) doc who is kind of weird, but what she said was, &#34;Wait until December; that&#39;s when the REALLY good surgeon will get there.&#34; I have no idea what she meant by that, but she is also not technically a doctor yet and messes up a lot of my medical issues (thinking my inflammatory disorder was due to hormones--the &#34;everything is hormones&#39; fault&#34; thing). So maybe I won&#39;t take her words into account. Ha ha. (I just made an appt w/someone else to switch to someone I felt more comfortable with.)
</p>
<p>
Is MGH good with phalloplasty and trans male/masc issues from what you can tell? How has your experience been?

I recently had a consult with Dr. Bluebond-Langner. I&#39;m sorry you had such a bad experience.
</p>
<p>
I think the person you talked to before her was the surgical fellow. They perform the surgeries with Bluebond-Langner and Zhao but can&#39;t operate independently yet. They&#39;re usually very knowledgeable.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious if your inflammatory issue is Crohns disease. I asked them about the risk of rectovaginal fistula and they told me that it pretty only ever happens to patients that have Crohns. If so that&#39;s probably why they declined to perform the surgery. If that is in fact the case you can almost definitely find another surgeon who will operate with the understanding that you will be at increased risk for a rectovaginal fistula.

I hate to ask this, but do you think your ethnicity might have influenced

all

of your consultations, not as you noted was apparently true for the first?

I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t quite understand the question. But I can try to guess. I at first chose Boston Medical Center, because at the time, my health provider in Boston, Fenway Health, claimed my state insurance (Medicaid at the time) could ONLY cover in-state surgery. At the time, BMC was the only place, and Dr. Oates was my only option. Or so I thought. I read and interacted with trans people after that consultation that they were NOT restricted to in-state. It&#39;s just that Fenway had some sort of interest--presumably financial--to recommend BMC. That&#39;s what other trans folks in Massachusetts have said, and it&#39;s what it seemed like to me.
</p>
<p>
With Rachel Bluebond-Langner, I didn&#39;t know at first she would be assisted by Lee Zhao. I&#39;d heard so many great things about her on Reddit, and New York City isn&#39;t that far away, even if it is still a hassle. If Bluebond wanted to discuss options, I would have continued with her, but she wouldn&#39;t work on me even when I tried to tell her I was considering minimal depth anyway. She just kept painting me as emotional when I was kind of just robotic and clutching my hands in nervousness. Dr. Zhao barely said anything but when he did, he just repeated what she said except more softly.
</p>
<p>
I was initially more interested in Dr. Avanessian afterward because there was more info on the trans wiki here on Reddit. However, I started considering Facial Feminization, and I felt more comfortable with asking Dr. Pang for FFS, because I didn&#39;t want to lose any ethnic features as someone who was mixed. He&#39;s Korean-American, and I&#39;m Korean, Inner Mongolian, and European. I&#39;d read some African-American trans women mention their concerns about FFS, particularly with potentially getting more European features from white surgeons, so it made me think about my own situation. Pang also seemed comparable to Avanessian with bottom surgery despite having less info on Reddit at the time, so I went with him.
</p>
<p>
However, if you mean to ask whether I was discriminated against: I don&#39;t know. Very few people have ever wanted to tell me outright, &#34;I&#39;m discriminating against you now, you [slur].&#34; Often, people are just really mean or refuse to help, then pretend like they don&#39;t know what happened or that I messed up somehow. I used to think I was crazy, especially since lots of my former non-mixed friends (white and Asian alike) used to tell me that as a mixed person, I never experienced racism. But I was physically assaulted throughout childhood and called Asian, Latina, and Arab slurs. And the more I read of other minorities&#39; experiences, the more I realized I went through the exact same &#34;plausible denial&#34; aggeessions frequently.
</p>
<p>
So I don&#39;t know. But Oates&#39; words seemed kind of fetishistic, whether that was towards trans people or because I&#39;m assumed to be Latina, Asian, or what-have-you sometimes. My subjective perception which may not be true, but it is true he was inappropriate in a misognyistic, sexualizing way.
</p>
<p>
With Bluebond-Langner and the staff at Mt. Sinai (since I never got to see Pang), I can&#39;t say for sure either way, but if I were fully European descent and looked like it, it would never ever hurt. Sometimes something bad would happen to white friends of mine, and they got a lot of sympathy, but sometimes when a similar thing happened to me, I&#39;d be told it was my fault or that I was exaggerating. I was disowned by family and lost all but one of my old friends after I came out, so I don&#39;t know enough friends to compare experiences with anymore, though.

Dear Lord.
</p>
<p>
I am appalled you had these experiences.  &#34;Rebecca&#39;s&#34; bad advice costing you money sounds recoverable, frankly -- as a tort.
</p>
<p>
Oates now sounds like a mispelling of Ogre.
</p>
<p>
&#34;This isn&#39;t something you can decide on just because you&#39;re emotional.&#34;  &lt;--   $^@#(*!@#$%&amp;**$%^ !!!

Hey, just want to say that I had surgery with RBL, and I can understand why she has a good reputation, but I left every appointment I had with her feeling like an idiot. Zhao was gracious and fun to be around, but RBL definitely has a big ego. I also feel that none of my appointments were very thorough.
</p>
<p>
I am neurodivergent, which could have played a big role in my trouble communicating during my appointments, but I feel there&#39;s a lot to be desired about my experience at NYU. I&#39;m seeking a colon revision with a different surgeon, because I have been continually losing depth since I had my surgery in 2021.
