Just curious to get others takes on this. I have dream surgeons I would love to get my vagina from... McGinn would be on the top of that list. But I don&#39;t have lots of money and I&#39;m stuck looking in network through my HMO. Of the three in network surgeons, two of them have pretty crappy results imo, and the last one of them (Doctor Devin O&#39;Brien-Coon) works through Johns Hopkins and is more famous for his phalloplasty. He does a number of vaginoplasties every year though.
</p>
<p>
I got in touch with other trans girls in the area who have had vaginoplasty with him and they speak very highly of him. The vaginas look good (Not great, some surgeons vaginas appear to me to be indistinguishable), and the girls seem to love their function, healing time is good, bedside manner is good etc.
</p>
<p>
And I guess now I&#39;m just wondering if I should do it. I could get vplasty within the next year, with little to no money on my part, locally through a great hospital, but it won&#39;t be my dream vagina... it&#39;s a hard choice. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to save up $15-20k for other surgeons for at least 3-4 years.

I went to a lesser-known surgeon for a couple reasons.
</p>
<p>
1) She was trained by my all time top pick, Marci Bowers. I knew that, between time and money, my chances of having Bowers herself perform my surgery were slim to none. Especially because she&#39;s nearing the age of retiring (and which is why she&#39;s been training a lot of surgeons over the past couple years. She wants to retire from GRS and spend her retirement helping victims of FGM, but she&#39;s helping ensure that trans folks have more surgical options in the future.)
</p>
<p>
2) She&#39;s local, and located at a hospital who has spent millions over the past few years setting up a complete, integrated trans care program, including offering all surgeries. The hospital takes their trans care program
<em>
very
</em>
seriously (hence having Bowers train their surgeons), and I was impressed with what I saw from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
3) In talking to a few of her other patients, and then at the surgical consult with the surgeon herself, I came away knowing that she was exactly the kind of person I wanted doing my surgery. While there wasn&#39;t a ton about her online, there also wasn&#39;t really any negative reviews either, and she&#39;s been performing OB/GYN surgeries for over 16 years. She very much genuinely cares about trans folks, and I felt like I could trust her at least as much as any other respected GRS surgeon. She also assisted literally dozens of GRS procedures with Bowers before even doing her first one on her own -- she was very well trained.
</p>
<p>
3) My state&#39;s Medicaid would cover it completely.
</p>
<p>
I knew I was taking a bit more of a risk by going to a &#34;newer&#34; surgeon, but I also legitimately felt like I could trust her, and it paid off. I got to have surgery 20 minutes from home, by a surgeon who did an amazing job, in a facility with a wonderful staff, and I love my results! The aftercare was fantastic too, and I don&#39;t think it could&#39;ve worked out any better. I did have to wait a year and a half, but I got on the list before they even started performing surgeries -- their waitlist is now over 3 years long, so I got lucky.
</p>
<p>
Going to a lesser-known surgeon can be a great option
<em>
as long as
</em>
you do your homework! Find out who trained them, how long they&#39;ve been surgeons, what their track record in general is like, and try to find prior patients of theirs to talk to. Just because they aren&#39;t Bowers or McGinn or Bluebond-Langer doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t provide excellent results, but you need to educate yourself first to make sure they&#39;re worth taking a chance with.

Sounds like all of your stuff applies to me. This surgeon works a JHU, which is also putting a ton of money into their trans program, offers all trans surgeries, my recovery would be completely local, his results appear to be pretty good, other patients like him.

My surgeon is at Denver Health, but it sounds like a similar situation. Ultimately nobody else can tell you what to do, and you&#39;ll have to put a lot of thought into it before you make that decision. But I would at least suggest not writing him off out of hand just because he&#39;s not a more well known surgeon. It could end up working out really well for you, and you could avoid ridiculous waitlist times. And don&#39;t underestimate being able to recover at home, yet close to the surgeon! It relieved a lot of anxiety for me that I was able to do that, yet still have quick access to my original surgeon and staff in the off chance something went wring (I had no complications though, my recovery was pretty uneventful.)

Being able to recover 20 minutes from my surgeon and from one of the top hospitals in the country is a huge selling point. I think I’m just scared of settling for a vagina that isn’t as good looking as McGinn’s... like damn, hers are so amazing.

I don&#39;t disagree that McGinn is a fantastic surgeon, and she was always in my top three too. But she&#39;s another one that has a very long waitlist, and IIRC that&#39;s even after you&#39;ve put down a hefty deposit. It should also be noted that McGinn isn&#39;t the only surgeon who gets fantastic-looking results. I would put my surgeon&#39;s results pretty on par with McGinn&#39;s (but again, my surgeon was trained by Bowers, so she&#39;s trained with one of the best.)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not trying to steer you one way or another. At the end of the day, only you can decide what&#39;s best for you. I think it pays to weigh your options and wants and needs. My genital dysphoria had gotten really bad, which also factored into decision, as well as my age -- at 41, I didn&#39;t really have the luxury of time that other folks may have. Waiting another 5-10 years would not only have meant a
<em>
lot
</em>
more dysphoria to deal with (and I don&#39;t know that I would&#39;ve survive that), but I&#39;m rather quickly approaching an age where surgery is going to get riskier and riskier.
</p>
<p>
I suppose my overall point is that, while aesthetics and surgical reputation are certainly important factors to consider, there are a
<em>
lot
</em>
of other things to take into account too that may not have occurred to you yet.

Nobody except you can make that decision for you. We dont know how much dysphoria you have, your ability to get the financial assistance / funding youd need, etc.
</p>
<p>
Id caution you from jumping the gun, really think through things (maybe schedule some consults with various surgeons or talk to a social worker about your financial/insurance situation).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
This is not a surgery you want a bad result from. It is also a surgery that demands good initial results - major revisions are never going to get the same level of quality that an initial first pass would have gotten from a quality surgeon.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Best of luck

Tough call...I&#39;m from the Baltimore area, so I am familiar with JH Medicals &#39;s work. I agree with you that Hopkins is working very hard to try to redeem themselves in the transgender community - in fact, my primary care doctor is Dr. Hedian, and she is great. I also have heard that women who do get their surgeries at Hopkins are generally happy with their results.
</p>
<p>
That being said, Hopkins is just not getting the volume of vaginoplasty patients that the top surgeons do, and Dr. O&#39;Brien-Coon has nowhere near the experience that the other surgeons have, I also don&#39;t know if he has yet adopted some of the more advanced techniques that the other surgeons have. And I do think it is very much worth going with the most experienced surgeons for SRS, not just for aesthetics, but also because you&#39;re less likely to run into post-surgery complications with an experienced care team who spent much of their time that helping women through recovery and know how to deal with issues as they come up....don&#39;t underestimate the importance of a post-op care team in this process.
</p>
<p>
That being said, 3-4 years is a long time and I&#39;m really sorry you&#39;re facing this choice.
</p>
<p>
I guess what you could do is just wait 3 months, and then every 3 months later ask yourself: &#34;Can I wait 3 months more?&#34;

<p>
The counter point to waiting 3 months to see what&#39;s going on is that surgical wait lists generally don&#39;t get any shorter over time, so instead of T0+3 years (for the sake of argument), you&#39;re now looking at T0+3.25 years, and so on.
</p>
<p>
I agree that a complete unknown with no results at all would be worrisome, as would a doctor with consistently mediocre results. But, someone had to be Dr. Avanessian&#39;s (for example) first/10th/20th patient, and at some point a promising surgeon should have some track record and a reasonably short wait list. Waiting until they have a great track record will probably mean a similarly long wait list, and then we&#39;re back in the same boat as waiting for a top surgeon now.

I&#39;m personally waiting until peritoneal surgery becomes more common and widespread. It seems like that&#39;s the easiest recover, best aesthetics, and so on. That being said I&#39;m probably going to be waiting for a while.

I had a similar decision to make about a year ago.  Also live in the DC area. I went with Dr. Del Corral in Baltimore, which might be one of the ones you decided against. FWIW, I love my results and don&#39;t regret at all not going with McGinn despite consulting with her.

So Del Corral only has ONE result listed and I wasn&#39;t too impressed? But I can understand if people aren&#39;t comfortable sharing and so they don&#39;t have the ability to show their results.
</p>
<p>
You were pleased? Aesthetically, function, etc?

It was definitely a tough decision and one that caused a lot of anxiety in the build-up. Waking up in the middle of the night freaking out, &#34;Am I making a terrible mistake??!!&#34; Hah, I&#39;m glad those days are over.
</p>
<p>
Covered and local was obviously a big selling point. I could&#39;ve afforded someone else, but then I wouldn&#39;t have had the funds to do forehead contouring a few months later. I&#39;ll admit it felt like a bit of a gamble. Get everything I want (if it all goes well) and have some money left over or go to Thailand or McGinn. Also being local meant I would have a lot more visitors and could recover at home straight out of the hospital.
</p>
<p>
I also really liked Del Corral. He&#39;s nice, not-intimidating, communicative, just seems genuine. I guess I just felt like I trusted him pretty quickly. That picture wasn&#39;t on his website at the time, but I saw some other ones at the consult. He talked about how he thought it was best to do some details like the clitoral hood in a second procedure. That didn&#39;t bother me. I ended up liking being able to talk about what alterations to make. The original surgery was in March, and I did that small revision two weeks ago. I was actually pretty happy after the first one, and now it&#39;s just what I wanted.
</p>
<p>
Function is good, sensitive, feels good, orgasm, all that. I&#39;m not sure what the depth measurement is, but it&#39;s a bit past the last dot on the Soulsource dilators if you&#39;re familiar with those. And aesthetically, I don&#39;t know, it looks like my vagina, I&#39;m fond of it.

This is all good stuff. Did insurance cover both stages well? I hear conflicting reports about second stage coverage. Did you get minoraplasty as well? Did it turn out looking pretty... well, normal vagina like? Function healing bedside manner etc all sound good!

Yeah, no problem with insurance. It seemed to take longer for the approval for the second than for the first time around, but that&#39;s it. For the second stage, he just asked what I wanted and we made a list of I think 6 little things he would tweak. I think it looks normal vagina-like, but you know I&#39;m honestly just not feeling that critical of my body these days, so maybe I&#39;m a bad judge. I&#39;ll see if I can get a photo to PM you when I get a chance and some privacy.

Google wall of vaginas and you&#39;ll see they&#39;re all very different. The perfect looking vagina doesn&#39;t exist. So is the reason you&#39;re getting grs for you to look at it everyday? Or is the reason to get rid of your genital dysphoria and have a functional one that is more inline with your brain?
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t just look at the success stories and surgery count. Look for botched patient stories as well and new surgeons work. Meltzer for example is supposedly good but I&#39;ve seen, heard from people with, and read a lot of botched stories. SoCal kaiser had to train surgeons to stop sending people to him because of this. These surgeons have also fixed all of his botched patients.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s surgery things won&#39;t go as planned all the time. So consider how far from family/friends you&#39;re comfortable with and how far away you want to be from your surgeon/care team if something does go wrong.
</p>
<p>
How will you travel back to your home? Surgery while life saving does a number to your body. Going through the airport after 7 days of recovery doesn&#39;t sound great to me.
</p>
<p>
Consider wait times. Newish surgeons have shorter wait times and are cheaper most times. Is it better to have a small co payment and shorter wait time, than to probably pay more and wait longer?
</p>
<p>
You have a ton of things to consider and time. So you can try to do both save money for it and go through the process for a local surgeon. Or not totally up to you. From the last 5 years of reading grs stories on the net. The majority of people are just happy they got it done. Regardless if the surgeon was famous or new.

Hi. I know this is a bit late to your post, but I have a consult with Dr Del Corral in a couple weeks for FFS and bottom surgery. I was wondering what you ended up doing, and how it turned out.
