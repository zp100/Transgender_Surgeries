So we are now 30 days into recovery and so far so good with some (minor) hiccups!
</p>
<p>
Please see other posts to see how she has healed thus far:

Recovery is going well, pain is pretty insignificant and I am slooooowly getting more nerves to wake up as I heal. mostly still numb but I think thats still a blessing at this point. Sutures are starting to be absorbed, all the belly incisions for the robotic assist have already healed and I no longer feel any kind of discomfort from the gas they put in the body cavity for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Dialation has been pretty straight forward though I did struggle for the first few weeks with knowing how to get the angle right for insertion its pretty trivial now and I have started to work on sizing up to the purple (p2-&gt;1) dialator. On p2 I can get almost to the last dot but on the new one I can only get about halfway to the third dot so for now I need to spend most of my dialating time on orange while I slowly get my body to relax to the new bigger dialator but good grief does that extra 1/8th inch feel enormous.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
So the one big bummer so far has been the separation (image 3) at the bottom of my vagina opening, it developed just under 3 weeks in when the skin started to tighten. It does not seem to be causing many issues other than being visually gross and more than a little sore from time to time but it will heal eventually. The next biggest  issue is of course the swelling that you can see in image 1 and especially 2. My Labia minora are aproximately the same size but one has been pretty consistenly swollen more than the other but that should go down over time as I continue to heal and the tissues decide to stop freaking out. My clit hood/clit are also very very swollen but that should also resolve itself in time. Its probably the most consistently tender thing but still not too bad and keeping myself on ice definitely helps.
</p>
<p>

<p>
If you all have any other specific questions feel free to ask either about my recovery, the surgeon or whatever else.

Mine paid 173k but the out of pocket cost is significantly lower if you self pay from my understanding, hard to say why they would refuse you and they definitely do ppt revisions.

They thought you&#39;d post something? Like they&#39;re worried about screwing up and that you&#39;d rightfully tell people your experience?
</p>
<p>
Ffs either way I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t go to them, that sounds like a shitty attitude for a surgeon to have.

:P they won&#39;t be so prominent when the swelling goes down but yeah Jun is a sweet guy I actually did a consult with him before deciding to stay with Bonnington.
