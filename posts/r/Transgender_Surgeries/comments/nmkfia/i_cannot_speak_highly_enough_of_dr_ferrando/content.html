The main reason I am making this post is because years ago when i was looking into who would be my surgeon, i was terrified of making the wrong choice. I am local to Ohio, but there wasn’t much info online about surgeons here when I was starting the process. Especially pictures of results. I looked at the “big name” surgeons out of town, but they had wait lists in the years, rather than months.
</p>
<p>
Bear with me, sometimes I am not as well spoken as I’d like and I’m sure I’ll miss things. Feel perfectly free to ask me questions and I will try to answer them.
</p>
<p>
I’m mostly going to go over the process after my surgery but for people wondering what came first, I had to be 3/4 of the way through hair removal before i got a consultation. Once there I was able to see pictures of results, though i believe there are now a couple of photos online through the hospital. I saw a bunch more. I felt much more confident when I saw them. I was impressed. She also helped me feel at ease explaining her rarity of complications, and that if something were to happen that she would immediately pivot towards fixing it.
</p>
<p>
Day of the surgery. I am being wheeled to the OR and just absolutely losing it and having a panic attack. I was sure I wanted the surgery, but when you’ve waited your whole life for something and suddenly it’s about to happen it can be a little shocking. Outside of the OR the entire team met with me and told me what their jobs were and introduced themselves if i hadn’t met them before. Dr Ferrando saw (very obviously) how nervous i was and put her face right up to mine and assured me everything would be okay and that she would take care of me.
</p>
<p>
I want to make this it’s own point so it isn’t lost in this long post. The doctor and her entire team are some of the most wonderful people I’ve ever met. I have quite severe anxiety and I never had a single bad experience with bedside care. Everyone at Cleveland Clinic between the surgeons, nurses, and administrators really went above and beyond.
</p>
<p>
Well, I made it out of surgery alive. Very little pain actually. I was shocked. I have had surgery before and though it was a far more minor procedure than grs I actually had more pain in the past. I had my own room for recovery and was constantly checked on, as well as a button to press if i ever needed anything. Dr Ferrando visited every single day including in my hotel. That’s the other thing. There is a really nice hotel connected to the hospital that i was moved to after 3 days which i stayed in for about a week. I’m lucky enough to have had my parents help me financially, but i’m sure that brought the cost way down and i believe that’s part of the reason they do it that way. If I wasn’t well enough I would have been kept in the hospital room, so don’t let that worry you.
</p>
<p>
The most pain I felt from the procedure was 100% the gas pain. Holy. Shit. my stomach was as hard as a rock and the 2nd day after my surgery was probably the worst day of my life. Gas X can only do so much. It was basically impossible for me to pass any of it and eventually I threw up. the clenching from that sure didn’t feel good, but I felt truly blessed that I did because it was much more bearable after that. by the 3rd day that went away and the only thing really bothersome was the catheter. Though i’ve seen how some people talk about their experiences with a catheter, and it wasn’t nearly as bad for me. just annoying.

This is my result now, I am around 4 months post-op. I had no complications. I couldn’t be much more pleased with it. Directly after surgery, i actually wasn’t the happiest. I think what it was is that my brain was hyper-analyzing it because I wasn’t used to having it there. I don’t think people talk about this enough. I didn’t have that huge sigh of relief that everything was wonderful, and I really didn’t until maybe a couple weeks ago. I fully attribute that to myself though. It just took some time for my brain to be accustomed to the change and there’s nothing wrong with that.
</p>
<p>
The main thing that’s been rough since the surgery has been muscle tightness. Dilating has been really, really, really hard. I am still only on the 2nd dilator where I should be past it. I’ve seen my doctors (Dr Ferrando as well as her surgical fellow Dr Mishra, who has been equally amazing) an astonishing amount of times, as well as a physical therapist who sees most of their patients. The plan now to relieve the tightness is to go back into the OR for botox injections to relax those muscles. They say they’ve done it before and had great success.
</p>
<p>
Another small issue i had was a big amount of clitoral pain as the nerves reconnected. It was so sensitive. I would get random shooting pain throughout the day. They had me on a large dose of nerve pain medicine though, and that really helped. I’m just past that phase now and don’t need to take it anymore.
</p>
<p>
I guess that’s pretty much it. If anyone wants updates after the injections, or (again) has any questions, I’ll try to keep an eye on this to answer.
</p>
<p>
As the title says, I am extremely happy and relieved that Dr Ferrando was my surgeon. Knowing what I know now, I would not consider another one. My experience was better than I thought possible. Constant post op visits and reassurance. Wonderful bedside care, etc. And though I didn’t mention her as much, Dr Mishra (the surgical fellow) was the one I saw even more of between the post op visits and regular check ups. She is extraordinarily kind and caring and I feel very fortunate that I happened to get my surgery while she was there to help with my process.

Dr. Ferrando did my hysterectomy 2 years ago and I couldn’t agree more; she was one of the best doctors I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with. Great surgeon, does amazing work, but also extremely personable.

I just saw them on Tuesday for follow ups.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had surgery with both Dr. Ferrando, Dr. Mishra and Dr. Bassiri. I feel the same way. They are a class act and great surgeons. I like them enough drive from Indiana to see them.
</p>
<p>
Great Write-up! Dr. Ferrando should not be overlooked for GRS. She has results on her website.

wonderful to hear your experience, you give alot of subtle detail and it&#39;s always helpful to have representation of the positive.  i feel the way teams respond to anxiety should be on their websites
