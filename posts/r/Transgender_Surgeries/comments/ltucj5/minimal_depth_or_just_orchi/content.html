I have a consultation for minimal depth in the fall. I&#39;ll be 50, wlw, so depth isn&#39;t needed.  We&#39;re both increasingly worried about problems or complications.  The plumbing works, and isn&#39;t so bad.  Can I get some insight from someone with orchi only... how is intimacy, any complications, etc??  Thanks in advance...

I’m 73 year old trans woman. I had zero depth vaginoplasty on Dec 9th. I had no complications and very little pain. The hardest part was I couldn’t sit for 5 weeks - I could only lay in bed. I could do mostly everything else as long as it wasn’t strenuous and over 5 lbs. Been back 100% since end of Jan. Totally happy!! Also being a lesbian made the decision easy.

I am super happy with my Orchi. I do have some regrets not going through with zero depth. My reasoning was the same as yours. I was afraid of complications and reovery.

Orchi plus or minus scrotectomy is fine altho if with scrotum removal makes vulvoplasty minimal or no depth a little harder. Penis usually considerably shrinks with HRT. Very few complications with this vs vaginoplasty.

How about intimacy, any loss of function after orchi?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious about muffing, but have never been able to get it... would scrotectomy remove the ability to do this (as I understand you need to get into the canal through the  scrotum area).  sorry if this is incorrect, like I said I&#39;ve never actually done it.

I had an orchi and then had zero depth GCS 8 months later. Check out my posts and I&#39;m open to questions if it can help.
