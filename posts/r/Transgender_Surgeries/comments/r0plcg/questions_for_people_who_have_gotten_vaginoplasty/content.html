These answers are from someone that socially transitioned at 38 years old, I commenced my social transition journey in 1998.  I achieved Orchie at 34, GRS completed at 41. (GRS was just over 20 years ago)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
how long did you wait until you were sure you wanted it?        I was battling with dysphoria about my body from about the age of 10. By the age of 26, I was seeking medical assistance to try to stop the male hormone production without success.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
were you 100% sure you’d have no regrets?        No, I was not 100% sure. However I had to try it because the alternative was not a viable option for me mentally due to dysphoria, and I wanted to remain alive, so the only option was adjusting my body to suit my mind.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
can you come using only your hands? (or do you have to use toys like vibrators)        I can get myself to orgasm with fingers, in fact this is my preferred method. I also enjoy a vibrator, or the human fleshy version.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
do you have numbness?        No, I have feeling in all parts, including my vaginal walls
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
what is dilation like? painful? traumatic?        The first few years it was a bit of a chore.... never been really painfull for me. I now find it to be a great time for play, and is quite enjoyable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
how much pressure do you need to use to get pleasurable sensation?        I find a variation of pressures quite enjoyable, depends on what area as to how much pressure feels the best.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
how does penetration feel?        I quite enjoy it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
is it easier to have female orgasms?        NO, I need to be mentally relaxed and not be distracted by other things around me. It also takes quite a lot longer. These are not really bad things.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
does it feel better for sex? how?        Yes, it does feel better because my genitals feel like they are mine.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
10, how different for a partner to learn how to pleasure yours compared to a cis woman’s?        Not a question I can answer, it is one you have to ask partners of trans people that one.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
what level of dysphoria did you have before getting it?        My dysphoria was extreme, I had battled mentally with it for many years before my Orchie, I was hoping this would be enough to keep it away, but after a very few years I realised that I had to have complete GRS.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
are you happy with the end result/aesthetics?        yes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
where can I get the best info on srs?        You need to do some serious research, and also speak with surgeons.
</p>

This story is gruesome so-- &#34;trigger warning.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I wanted surgery in my late teens, but successfully repressed the thought for decades--it was out of the question for a low-paid orchestral musician/minimum wage worker in the Seventies, in Texas.
</p>
<p>
I took work as a public servant in the late &#39;90s, and got access to health insurance, but I wasn&#39;t able to get surgery for more than a decade after asking for it--the insurance industry and my employer fought it tooth and nail. I was forced to castrate myself when it became clear that testosterone blockers could no longer work (they cannot be taken years on end).
</p>
<p>
I am proud to say that my struggle opened the door to other transgender employees in that rather large agency. Yes, I was 100 percent sure, though I was and remain sad that it was unavailable to me until I was nearly 60 years old.
</p>
<p>
Orgasms are available manually, though I generally use vibration. My senescent flesh will not dilate. I tried diligently, and nearly hospitalized myself with blood loss and infections; I gave up. Penile inversion was used, though it was clear I was not a good candidate; the attitude was &#34;take it or leave it.&#34;
</p>
<p>
The surgery took more than a year to heal. It looks good. Most of the numbness has left.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: In case it isn&#39;t clear, penetration is impossible; the resulting vagina is tiny. I do not regret surgery in any way, though the attitude of many people in and around the insurance/medical industry has been, on the whole, hostile, dismissive and/or disgusted; as soon as you are perceived as MtF transgender, you will see that you are regarded as a perverted fool by many doctors and nurses. Some are quite sympathetic.

1, Define wait. I attempted transition in the nineties but stopped when I started transition this time I knew it was the end point no question.
</p>
<p>
2, yes I was sure I wouldn&#39;t have regrets, that said it didn&#39;t stop me from having a panic attack that started the night before and continued right up to being knocked out for my surgery.
</p>
<p>
3, I orgasm better with my hands but that doesn&#39;t stop me from enjoying penetration.
</p>
<p>
4, no numbness
</p>
<p>
5, dilation. Novel at first, tedious/annoying later, for me painful later when scars started to contract and now post 6year don&#39;t really do it that much.
</p>
<p>
6 not sure how to quantify pressure needed.
</p>
<p>
7, penetration is pleasant. With a partner that knows what he&#39;s doing well.....that&#39;s just something else.
</p>
<p>
8, my orgasms are as far as I&#39;m concerned &#34;female&#34;. I know they are nothing like before.
</p>
<p>
9, yes sex fells better because it&#39;s &#34;right&#34;
</p>
<p>
10,
</p>
<p>
11,
</p>
<p>
12, yes I&#39;m very happy with the results.
</p>
<p>
13, were to find the best info is a &#34;trick&#34; question. It&#39;s a huge topic with hundreds of subtopics. You need to narrow things down and work your way out from there. No one place will have all the answers and depending on the details you want it could be easy or if you want to really get down &#34;into the weeds&#34; with it, it could be a full time job in itself.
