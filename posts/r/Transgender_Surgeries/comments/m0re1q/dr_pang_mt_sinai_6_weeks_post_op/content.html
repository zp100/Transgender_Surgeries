Thanks for that last picture and explanation. If I had that happen and was not expecting it, I would have lost my stuffing.

I didn&#39;t feel it at all. Just kind of noticed it hanging there a bit before dilating one night and it kind of slid out with a little pull. No pain, or anything or blood. But I did feel it slide out from deep inside. Panicked immediately though and emailed and they said it&#39;s fine. So I&#39;m not too concerned. But it didn&#39;t happen at all until like this passed week. So it took some time for it to happen. Let me know if you get anything like it.

No problem. But yeah that was my first instinct. Especially since the first time it happened I had some suture material from the disolving stitches come with it. But they said at 6 weeks there&#39;s no real risks with that.  So this was actually my second instance. But I can kind of tell that it&#39;s coming from my natural discharge as that&#39;s kind of viscous and milky colored similar to this.  So just all the coagulation, mixing up with lube drying up etc. Just kind of makes sense you reject some nasty mcnasties. Especially since Dr pangs office doesn&#39;t want you douching or anything for a while post op.

That&#39;s great to hear! My pain is subsiding pretty more and more every day. But his dilation schedule is intense and starting to wear on me a bit lol. But great to know you&#39;re liking your results and things are going well! Forgive me if it&#39;s tmi but have you been told if you can experiment with trying to orgasm yet?  And if so how is it? Also any experience with the self lubrication aspect that was supposed to be part of using the tunica vaginalis?

hi again! yeah the dilation is intense lol. i sometimes do only two times per day and it seems to be fine but ymmv...! also i started touching myself and using a vibrator at about six weeks or so, and was able to orgasm then, and since week 8 or so i‚Äôve been able to regularly and reliably orgasm. also i explored with my boyfriend for the first time (not penetrative sex but just touching, very gentle fingering), and while i hadn‚Äôt gotten very wet on my own before, i got extremely wet that time, i guess because i was more aroused. i was really happy about that :) i think you should be fine to start trying at six weeks, just be gentle and if it starts to hurt then don‚Äôt push it! &lt;3 hope that‚Äôs helpful and not tmi lol!!

i really want to go to Dr. Pang if I can ever save up enough. Your results look amazing! Did insurance cover any of your surgery?

Thank you. I&#39;m actually very happy with the aesthetic. Still waiting on all feeling to return but it&#39;s coming back. My insurance covered all but 2k. So I can&#39;t argue with that.  The most expensive thing was the fact I&#39;m out of state and had to supply my own lodging, transportation, and personal caretaker for a month.

OMG that&#39;s amazing! I would definitely be out of state and I get really depressed thinking about how insurance will probably cover nothing, but now I kinda have a bit of courage and hope to ask! You just gave me so much hope, i may cry!
