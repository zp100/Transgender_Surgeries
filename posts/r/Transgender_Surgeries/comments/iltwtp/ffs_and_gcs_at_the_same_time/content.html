Hello! I am reaching out because I’m wondering if anyone has had any experience having a Vaginoplasty and Facial Feminization surgery at the same time, or close together in time, and want to know what that experience was like! Thanks in advance for your responses!

Nope, can&#39;t be done.
</p>
<p>
You could add BA to one of those, but you couldn&#39;t do those two major surgeries, no

I’m recovering from FFS currently and I urge you
<em>
not
</em>
to combine FFS and GCS, if it’s even possible. It’s taken a lot to recover from FFS so far. I can’t imagine how I could have recovered from both at once.

I’m at 4 weeks post now. I had more procedures than most - forehead, nose, cheek/chin implants, upper/lower bleph, lip lift, trachea shave. The first week was rough with lots of bruising and swelling. I was weak, easily winded, and on pain meds (Oxycodone, Tylenol). I’ve gotten progressively better each day/week but recovery has a long tail and I’m still taking pain meds when needed.

Currently a week into recovering from GCS and I have to say that would be absolutely aweful. GCS is intense. Very much worth it, but intense. Adding another major surgery/recovery on top of that would be more than I could personally handle.

I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. They&#39;re both major surgeries. My FFS felt and looked pretty brutal for the first 2-3 weeks after surgery (but after that was fine).
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have been able to deal with FFS and GRS recovery - which was less brutal in terms of overall pain but overall a harder, longer recovery with more persistent but lower scale pain and aches, where you&#39;re also quite immobile and really need to take good aftercare of your surgery site.
</p>
<p>
I did have a fairly minor FFS revision with my GRS (cheek implants removed as I just didn&#39;t really need them) and even that was difficult, dealing with a swollen, bruised face and doing the day-to-day GRS recovery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d really consider doing them separately, even though it&#39;s probably cheaper with hospital and anaesthetic fees to do them together.

My first thought was
<em>
good Lord, no!
</em>
Having done both, I cannot even imagine doing both at the same time.  Both surgeries can be  brutal to recover from.  I would wait a good six months in between those surgeries. I waited about a year between getting FFS done and getting GCS.
