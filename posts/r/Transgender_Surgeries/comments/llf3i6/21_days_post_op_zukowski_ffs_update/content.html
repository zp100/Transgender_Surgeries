I&#39;ve had all those procedures with Dr. Z and more. It took about two years before I got a &#34;final&#34; result.  I would wait on the revision.  Asymmetry is common and will resolve. I had uneven nostrils for months.   Having more surgery at this point would be a waste of money. You have healed up really well for only being 3 weeks post-op and I think you will keep getting better.

I can‚Äôt have a revision yet anyway, it would need to be done at one year. I‚Äôve also had a rhinoplasty before and know what‚Äôs swelling and what isn‚Äôt. Indents, holes and divots don‚Äôt ‚Äúfill in‚Äù with time, and just how the imperfections I had from my previous rhino didn‚Äôt go away after 3-4 years, this will be no different. I also need to get back to my day to day life and that will not and cannot happen while my nose is so deformed. If it was just uneven nostrils, I could work with that. Holes and indents? Yeah I can‚Äôt deal with that. Will definitely need a revision and have already spoken to two surgeons who agree, however they want to wait till the three to four month mark to definitively say so, without a doubt but the consensus is that there is an issue or problem with my nose not related to the healing process.

Well I am really sorry you have had these complications with your nose. Did Dr. Zukowski offer any comments or opinions, or just blow you off? He can be a real dick sometimes, then two minutes later he is as sweet as can be.

Let‚Äôs just say I felt like I wasn‚Äôt being heard, and I felt like my concerns weren‚Äôt being taken seriously. I went no contact and made it clear that I didn‚Äôt want to speak or correspond with him anymore. It seems that all they wanted was pictures, they made repeated attempts to contact me to get pictures. I was in a raw emotional state, trying to be strong over the phone with him. After our conversation I felt deflated and that was it. I‚Äôve re-established communication and sent the pictures they wanted so badly and now the ball is in his court.  I suspect nothing with come of this, I just did it to be nice. If he wants to be nice and refund the money I paid for the rhino I would take it in a heartbeat, but he‚Äôd probably rather do a revision. Unfortunately my trust in him is fractured so I don‚Äôt feel it would be in my best interest to go against my instincts.

That&#39;s understandable. I have had him talk over me on phone follow-ups and not listen to me.  It&#39;s very frustrating.  Sometimes all you really need is some fundamental acknowledgment of your concerns. Then he&#39;s all &#34;sweetie&#34; and &#34;honey&#34;.  I get what you&#39;re saying.
</p>
<p>
I felt I got pretty good results with him, but he&#39;s not good at scars. I had a chin contour as part of a bunch of procedures and I have a ragged scar underneath my chin. The hairline scar I have from scalp advance is not too bad, though. And I can still see a scar around one of my nostrils from the lip lift. It&#39;s barely noticeable, but it&#39;s
<em>
right there
</em>
, in  the middle of my face.
</p>
<p>
I think Dr. Z has lost a step. His outcomes are getting a little ragged. He is not great with noses, I will agree. I had a perfect little nose for about 12 days post-op, and then after further healing I was left with a bump. He actually did a revision, and I got... the same bump.  And of course, he said it was my fault for not massaging my nose often enough post-op.
</p>
<p>
The most positive thing I can say is the rest of your procedures look great. But considering the money, and time, and hope we invest in these procedures, I know it feels like a consolation prize.

I have the same scary scar under my chin, I hope it improves but from what you‚Äôre telling me I shouldn‚Äôt get my hopes up. My lip lift scar doesn‚Äôt look too bad, I just hope it heals nicely and it it doesn‚Äôt I‚Äôll just get some laser to soften it a bit..  yeah I just can‚Äôt see myself going in for a revision with him after this. It‚Äôs a shame because my experience aside from my results where overall positive and I like him. But his response to concerns needs improving because it just leaves you feeling like you‚Äôre being made out to be crazy or just having a moment of post-surgery reaction to temporary swelling. This is absolutely not that and I believe he knows this. I have to live like this for a year and that honestly sucks even more than the money. But you‚Äôre absolutely correct, going in and spending money, and giving every drop of emotional energy into a procedure that‚Äôs supposed to improve your mental health, only for it to make it worse. It really has shaken me and tested my strength.

And yes, the rest of it does look acceptable thus far, but as you said it kind of feels like a consolation prize lol very ‚Äúwell at least the rest of your face isn‚Äôt botched!‚Äù

Yeah, i think you look great.  It does take a long time for things to get to normal regarding swelling.
