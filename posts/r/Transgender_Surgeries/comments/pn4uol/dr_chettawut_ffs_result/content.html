There‚Äôs not many results posted from Thai FFS surgeries, so I hope it‚Äôs helpful to share mine. I used Dr Chettawut for all my surgeries in one visit - GRS, BA and FFS. It was a gruelling early recovery after two consecutive days of surgery, but in hindsight I am so pleased to do it all together and only needing to go through recovery once.
</p>
<p>
I am extremely happy with the results and the confidence I gained and of course I realise FFS is not for everyone. I also had a consultation with Facial Team. Viewing their gallery of results, I was very impressed with their results on younger women (under 40s), but overall personally felt they were too conservative on women my age (mid 50s). Through Dr Chettawut‚Äôs gallery, I felt his clinic would be slightly more aggressive with the overall result, and I feel that has worked for me.
</p>
<p>
I opted for quite the list of FFS procedures:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Forehead and brow contouring with brow lift
</li>
<li>
Upper and lower eyelids
</li>
<li>
Rhinoplasty
</li>
<li>
Lip lift
</li>
<li>
Laugh line filler
</li>
<li>
Jaw and chin contouring
</li>
<li>
Face and neck lift
</li>
<li>
Trachea shave
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Happy to answer any questions here or by PM any time (yes, even you finding this two years after it‚Äôs posted).

A couple of years ago now, but FFS, BA and GRS combined were around USD$55k/‚Ç¨46.5k. Keep in mind prices and conversion rates change over time.

You look Gorgeous!!  I&#39;m super happy for you, that you got such terrific results.  I would like to have any surgeries I end up getting done all any once as well.  Thank you for, not only posting this, but including the three pictures and listing the procedures.

Thank you. This is so helpful. In my early 60s &amp; would love to get it done all at once. How long did you stay in Bangkok? Stunning! üíôüíúü§ç

Thanks so much. I was there for the 30 day window of a tourist visa (medical was allowed in this category) applied for on landing.  But I also required another month or so after that before returning to work.
