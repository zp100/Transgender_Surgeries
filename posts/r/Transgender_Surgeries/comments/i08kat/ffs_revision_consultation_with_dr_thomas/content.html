<p>
So my consultation with Dr. Satterwhite was moved up to this morning. It was supposed to be on Saturday in person, but because of super spiking COVID19 cases in CA it was moved to a zoom consultation and he was able to see me earlier.
</p>
<p>
The gist: The consult took about 90 minutes and we discussed his general plan/strategy for my facial features. He reviewed my pics, x-rays and CT-Scans and made a series of recommendations and we discussed the possibilities at length as well as the possible complications.
</p>
<p>
What impressed me the most was that he had the same basic vision for my face as I did. He recommended all of the procedures that I want and nothing that I don&#39;t. i.e: redoing the osteotomy/type-III, forehead recontouring and brow lift, septorhinoplasy, and doing a more aggressive mandible reduction, a slight genioplasty, and a mild lip lift and the trach shave which also wasn&#39;t done in the first surgery. He said I could consider doing a minor fat graft to my cheekbones if I wanted, but it&#39;s not really necessary.
</p>
<p>
He noticed right away on my x-rays that Dr. Kleinberger was far too conservative in every area. He also noticed that there&#39;s no mention of Dr. K even touching my orbital rims at all in his surgical notes, which is something that all of the other consults missed. (In other words, I&#39;ve never had a real forehead recontouring. WTF Kleinberger?!)
</p>
<p>
He also mentioned that the CT-Scan showed very minimal jawline work, to the point where it was barely noticeable even on the x-ray. Which validated all of my observations regarding my first FFS.
</p>
<p>
When I asked him about his complication rate statistics he said he&#39;s done something in the neighborhood of 300-350 full FFS at this point and he&#39;s had a very few number of patients with serious complications. Most common issue is scarring (which is true of all FFS surgeons), followed by loss of some sensation which has happened in roughly 5% of his patients. He said he&#39;s never had a patient have a total loss of feeling in any area. Only 2 of his patients have ever suffered temporary hair loss, and he&#39;s never had one with permanent hair loss. I&#39;d say those are pretty decent stats. He also admitted that because this is a revision, he may not be able to get the full 7mm pushback that I want on my type-III reconstruction but feels he can get close to that. He mentioned that he thought Dr. K made the osteotomy too low, and that seriously effected the results. He would have cut a larger piece of bone and that would have made a more dramatic difference.
</p>
<p>
All in all, I think he&#39;s a definite option, especially since I wouldn&#39;t have to pay 40-50k out of pocket and he&#39;ll likely have done 50-100 more surgeries by the time he gets to me next summer which I think is even more than Dr. Rolfes, and certainly more than most other doctors outside of like DB, Speigal, Facial Team or DiMaggio or those bigger names. I guess I&#39;ll just wait for the pics and then I&#39;ll make up my mind.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still waiting to see more before/after pics before I make my final decision But the advocate that I hired to fight with my insurance  seems to think he&#39;s great, and says that all of the patients he&#39;s personally sent to Dr. Satterwhite have been very happy. I still want to decide for myself, but I&#39;m optimistic, especially since his office works with a few different insurance companies. Based on this consult, I found him to be very knowledgable and he comes off as a very kind and thorough doctor.

Hey! I had ffs from Kleinberger in December. It did absolutely nothing to help me pass. Really similar situation to yours tbh. I just wanted to chime in in case the people at Kaiser were trying to gaslight you into accepting the work he did as good.

Nice to have some solidarity, although I&#39;m really sorry about your results. I was hoping that maybe he was better by now. I was lucky in the sense that I didn&#39;t need it to pass, and I wanted it for my own self esteem but  it was totally pointless. Now I&#39;m mad at myself for going through with it.
</p>
<p>
Seriously, fuck Kaiser. They talk like they&#39;re helping trans people but they send us to garbage surgeons with inferior skills and only basic levels of training and next to no experience. I found out later that I was probably around Klienberger&#39;s 50-100th patient as a lead surgeon. If I had known that, there&#39;s no way I would have agreed to it.
</p>
<p>
He gaslighted the shit out of me for 2.5 years. Told me that it was great and I didn&#39;t need a revision. I asked him about 6 times. He just kept telling me to wait. Then he told me that everything that I was seeing was all &#39;cosmetic&#39; and not outside average female features and basically that I was crazy to want a revision. Every other surgeon that I&#39;ve met for a consultation has told me the opposite, even the other KP doctor, and insurance will approve my revision. I just need a GOOD surgeon that takes insurance now.
</p>
<p>
I know this thread has made it into the surgery wiki. I&#39;m really hoping it saves other people the anguish of going through FFS with Kaiser.

Totally! From what I&#39;ve heard other people say and seen from my own ffs his results have stayed more or less the same as what you were saying before. And like I really regret going through with it from him too, I&#39;m happy about the trachea shave but that&#39;s about it.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s really messed up! He came off as a slickster and that bothered me. The first thing he did in the consultation was immediately talk down my expectations by saying &#34;we&#39;re not LA&#34;, as in, don&#39;t expect any drastic changes or anythingl That should have been a red flag but kaiser literally wouldn&#39;t cover anyone else and passing is really important to me. I could pass just sort of alright before and after surgery but it hasn&#39;t improved at all.
</p>
<p>
I really, really hope whoever you find next gives you the results you&#39;re hoping for!

I got that vibe from him too, especially after. Looking back there are so many red flags. He never discussed measurements with me (although he took them) and never talked about how much he could do based on an objective scale.
</p>
<p>
When I went to DB he spelled everything out. &#34;your forehead is Xmm when it should be more like Zmm. You nose has an over projected dorsum and the tip is Xmm too far forward...&#34; etc. It was so much more thorough and he made a real plan with CONCRETE objectives. Dr. K was nothing like that. He talked about everything in vague terms and just mentioned the procedures, never stating how far he thought we should go with them.
</p>
<p>
I felt like afterward he talked to me like i was being irrational and demanding to look supermodel pretty or something. Drastic results don&#39;t need to look Hollywood glamorous. Just take of the male parts of my skull that never should have grown in the first place!  He acted like I have unrealistic expectations, but it&#39;s because he can&#39;t really do his job very well. And he got defensive. I really think he should give up FFS and working with trans patients. He&#39;s just doing a disservice to everyone he operates on. Every result I&#39;ve ever seen since my surgery is the same story. All of his patients that pass, already passed BEFORE his work. I feel really bad for people who go to him and expect to pass after surgery, I&#39;ve never seen him make a non-passing face pass.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also never seen a result by ANY KP surgeon on Reddit, Susans, FB, or anywhere else, that made me think &#34;wow, that&#39;s a fantastic result!&#34; Everyone that goes to their docs gets like maybe a 10-20% improvement. I think it&#39;s best to avoid them completely unless you only need VERY subtle changes made.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best as well. I hope you can get a revision with a skilled surgeon.

Yup. Dr. Kleinberger is a joke. I&#39;d never recommend him to anyone. What really makes me angry is that now I know he never did my orbital bones and he straight up lied to me about it.

Do you have proof that he offered this and/or said he actually performed it? Even more so if he charged for it?
</p>
<p>
If so, and assuming the scans are proof that he did nothing, then I think you&#39;d have a strong legal case.

I have the proof because there&#39;s no mention of it in the surgical notes that are in my medical file, and there&#39;s no evidence that it was done in the CT Scans. He told me that he &#34;contoured&#34; my forehead and brows, which could probably be just vague enough to elude me pinning him down for anything specific. He also eventually told me that he couldn&#39;t do anything else for me when I asked for a revision.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if I have a strong legal case because KP covered the surgery and I only paid like 100$ out of pocket. He could always say &#34;I didn&#39;t think it was required once I was in surgery, blah blah blah.&#34; Malpractice suits are tricky. I think you can really only sue for things that surgeons do that aren&#39;t necessary. I doubt I can sue for something that he didn&#39;t do.

It’s not only a question of money, but pain, wasted time, and heath risks. Sounds like you’d have not undergone the surgery if you’d known this would not be performed. So more fraud than malpractice perhaps.
</p>
<p>
The insurance company might have an issue with being overcharged, and that’s probably not a great idea.

Glad to hear that you had a good consultation.   I’ve heard good things about Dr. Satterwhite and it seems that he is in the game for the right reasons.

Yeah, he seems like an awesome person and he&#39;s very knowledgable. I still want to see more recent photos. All the before/after pics on the Align website are like 2-4 years old. Even the woman in the testimonial video had her FFS done in like 2018 or something, so he&#39;s probably done like 100-150 more surgeries since then. I want to see what his current skills are like before making up my mind.
</p>
<p>
I get that they have HIPAA considerations and all of that, but if he can&#39;t even show me his results in an office visit, I may have to try to go somewhere else. I made a horrible mistake going with Dr Kleinberger after only seeing like 4-6 photos of previous patients. I&#39;m not going to do that again.  I have til November to decide on my new insurance. So there&#39;s no hurry. I&#39;ll wait to see the results before booking.
