That does sound horrible :( I&#39;m actually scheduled for Bowers and this is terrifying.
</p>
<p>
I am confused about the hair; I thought she even had a guide on her website showing how to get laser prior to surgery?
</p>
<p>
So you said you don&#39;t regret it which is really relieving to hear. For the granulation....what resoson did she give that she couldn&#39;t see you? That sounds I sane

All experienced surgeons have negative reviews so don&#39;t form your opinion on one or two reviews. There&#39;s heaps of reviews in the wiki.

I had surgery with Bowers 9 months ago. She visited me in the hospital on day 2 post op, and that was it. Catheter removal was done by an office aid, and there were no follow up appointments until just recently at 9months post op. I had very minor complications, am very happy with the appearance, and am going in for a revision to fix some small issues like too much skin covering my vaginal canal and not having a big enough clitoral hood.

I&#39;m going to be very honest. Granulation being treated by yourself is normal and is a very common complication in this surgery. I was prescribed an ointment by my surgeon Dr. Avanessian. It eventually went away.
</p>
<p>
Also, I had a bleeding issue as well, and when I initially called MS, they weren&#39;t worried about it, and turns out, it was just a hemotoma. Tearing and popped stitches are also common, and yeah, it&#39;s your responsibility to get the surgical site clear of hair before surgery.
</p>
<p>
From what you described there was nothing extraordinary or overtly negligent. Maybe Bowers sucks at bedside manner, or she&#39;s really busy. Not everyone sees their surgeon right after surgery. I have had friends go through MS and this was the case. Complications are a fact for this surgery, not the exception.

I appreciate this review and there&#39;s a couple of things that bother me reading it.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, not great aftercare. Perhaps its the same in other places, but that doesn&#39;t mean its ok, just that other places do it too. Does it make any difference to the end results? Perhaps not, but you can only really work it out by looking at many reviews. It it were a lessor known surgeon you might for a different opinion.
</p>
<p>
It also reminds me of the TV show I am Jazz, and the complications and aftercare she experienced.
</p>
<p>
Second the internal hair. I&#39;d say that&#39;s totally unacceptable, but every other surgeon does the same thing and they are all at fault. So a red flag, but not a terribly useful one. It is yet another warning to get hair removed before surgery no matter what the surgeon says, so I&#39;m adding this post to the wiki in a couple of places.
</p>
<p>
Sounds like your granulation was treated using a steroid cream? Its also treated with silver nitrate and that can cause complications that will put you back in the hospital emergency department.
</p>
<p>
I think we should be careful not to put people off posting their reviews otherwise we&#39;re all going to have problems.

<p>
MS lasers their patients before surgery if you are local and require you to have it removed in addition to scrapping left over follicles. So even stating that every other surgeon does the same thing is misleading. The negative response to this review is that the OP described incredibly common and minor complications and escalated it to the degree of Bowers coming off as negligent.

Not sure I understand. Whats MS?
</p>
<p>
The OP said
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dr Bowers had said that laser hair removal was unnecessary
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And look here
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/l9otiq/just_got_offered_a_cancellation_date_with_marci/gljgwjv/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/l9otiq/just_got_offered_a_cancellation_date_with_marci/gljgwjv/
</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the phone with Robin, she assured me that Marci scrapes hair during surgery and nearly 30% of their patients have zero hair removal at all. She claimed that they have never had complaints about internal hair due to their use of scrapping and surgical electrolysis.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And in reply
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
That&#39;s a lie. I&#39;ve had issues after 18hrs of electrolysis and let them know about it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I shouldn&#39;t say every other surgeon says hair removal is not required as I don&#39;t know that for sure, but I have seen a lot say it. Its bugging me because so many people are not getting hair removal because they are not aware of the true risk and thus are not able to make an informed decision. And every time it comes up people say I had surgery and I don&#39;t have any hair, and then people don&#39;t bother. Well, no surprise there because its a risk not a certainty.
</p>
<p>
I spend a fair bit of time looking into it, here

Oh hey, I was just quoted.
</p>
<p>
I will say the thing that stands out to me in this post is being told hair removal was &#34;unnecessary&#34;. My understanding from them in speaking to and working with them was that it was not required, but highly recommended. This remains the case
<a href="https://marcibowers.com/transfem/gav/preparation/">on their website also
</a>
which includes guidance on how they want it done. They may have started giving different instructions over the last two years, but the website remains unchanged.

Granulation tissue can become cancerous. It absolutely should not be left up to the patient. I have to go to a different surgeon to get some removed as it’s all the way in the back and my surgeon is lazy/incompetent. Is it normal to treat it yourself? Yes, but it shouldn’t be.

yes, there is a major problem. I didn&#39;t see my surgeon after a major surgery. It was actually traumatizing to have to cut off some of my own skin. The hair inside of me was so upsetting I ended up in the psychiatric ward! Dr. Bowers said that there was no need for electrolysis.

The problem is, this is a review, so it&#39;s directed at people who haven&#39;t had it.

As a result, it&#39;s misleading AND irresponsible.

No, it&#39;s not. People need to understand I almost died because of how taxing this surgery recovery was. It was still worth it in the end but I almost lost my life! The psychological impact of having 0 support after surgery and dealing on my own made me suicidal.

You are projecting and making broad assumptions. The fact is none of the complications described by the OP require major intervention, and tbh, comes off as drama. Your argument of cis medical privilege is moot considering Dr. Bowers is trans. She is an expert in her field and understands that some granulation or a popped stitch is not the end of the world.

Your comments are hurtful and insensitive. Would you like to hear all the ways I started thinking of killing myself because I felt disgusting and abandoned? Is that being dramatic? Granulation tissue was extremely painful and I cut almost an inch off with scissors! My own skin! Dr. Bowers says it&#39;s a less than 8% complication and that is a lie. I want people to know the truth!

Someone once wrote that we need to consider what the surgeons do when there is a less than optimal outcome/complications.  The fact is that most seem to not do very well in this area.  Is it a matter of missplaced pride?  Not knowing HOW to correct the problem?  Wanting to move on?  I don’t know, but from reviewing the cases, it does seem to be a pattern.   It also is true of many surgeons outside of trans practices.  I wish trans  surgeons would form a more cohesive community and better share knowledge, experience and maybe even patients for certain problems.

god. is there a good surgeon that doesn&#39;t have these stories?
</p>
<p>
it sucks that we have to rely on these people for our much needed surgery :(
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy! and pictures always help everyone decide who to go with so i&#39;d love them!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve done days and weeks and months of research and i still don&#39;t know what I want.
</p>
<p>
at first I was like &#34;marci!&#34; then I saw the bad horrible results
</p>
<p>
then i was like &#34;Chet!&#34; and I saw that he too has bad stories and horrible results sometimes.
</p>
<p>
the closest i&#39;ve seen to mostly good results is Dr. Avanessian but they have only like photos from 3-4 different people.

Awww. I guess If you need it it might be best to just hope and do it. If you&#39;re not very keen to maybe research more and think?

From a surgeon’s perspective, no surgeon can tell a patient (anyone who is not in the medical profession) all the risks associated with a specific surgery. There are too many possibilities of things that can go wrong. And even if we did tell a patient the hundreds of things that COULD happen, no patient would remember them. So we stick to the LIKELY MAJOR complications. Wound dehiscence and granulation tissue, from our perspective is not really a complication, or it’s a minor one at best. Inconvenient, but will not lend itself to further procedures.

Internal hair is a common complication, around 7% according to one paper, and surgeons know it. The consequences can be quite bad.

Right, but I only addressed the complications of granulation tissue, and wound dehiscence.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure anyone would disagree with internal vaginal hair being an issue because it can lead to problems and it won’t go away without invasive treatment.
</p>
<p>
My initial reply was not to address anything regarding Dr. Bower’s bedside manner, the way she conducts her postop care, or even her preop care. It was only to state that a surgeon cannot inform a person about ALL the possible issues with any surgery.

I didn&#39;t read your comment that way. I read &#34;no surgeon can tell a patient ... all the risks&#34; and am of the opinion that a 7% risk is something that should be mentioned, especially when the patient has the option to do something about it.
</p>
<p>
Its not a small thing either as few if any women manage to get rid of it when its deep inside where it can&#39;t be reached with electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
There was a women who posted on susans who was having serious recurring infections and was told by her surgeon that she may need her vaginal canal removed to fix it. I don&#39;t know what happened after that as the mods removed the entire discussion (one of the major problems with that site). I also know another case, although not nearly so severe. I also understand that ongoing UTI&#39;s can cause quite serious issues over many years.

I certainly agree that intravaginal hair is a problem. And this possibility should have been thoroughly discussed. I apologize for not being clearer.
</p>
<p>
Yes, ongoing UTI/recurrent UTI can be very problematic since the bacteria can become antibiotic resistant over time, and can ascend to the kidneys causing pyelonephritis...

That was indeed the reason. I couldn&#39;t quite remember the details since I&#39;m not a doctor and didn&#39;t want to get it wrong. That would be a very scary prospect to look forward to. And I bet almost no one in the trans community knows about it.
</p>
<p>
If someone started offering a service to get rid of deep hair they could probably make some decent money doing so. Unfortunately the only people who can do it already make even more money. I have heard of one surgeon doing it for their own patient, but I can&#39;t imagine they would do it for anyone else.

The perfect surgeon uses the perfect technique with perfect bed side manner and with perfect communication. And even with all this, bad things and poor outcomes still happen.
</p>
<p>
Playing devil’s advocate, her website does state that “Intraoperative electrolysis is further performed in surgery although this can leave occasional hairs that can grow internally.”
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry you had to go through this. Surgeons can be better communicators.

I expected all that before my surgery with Dr. Bowers. I researched all the possible complications, Marci herself and asked how to prevent vaginal hair growth. Was also there with a close friend for her surgery with Marci, 2 years before mine.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t get hair removal done before surgery. Still don&#39;t have hair in there. I&#39;m super careful about keeping water from getting in there. Water has a ph around 7. Hair grows when ph is above 4.5.
</p>
<p>
The vinegar + water douche you talked about in your post history has too much water. Water raises vinegar&#39;s ph a lot. Vinegar decreases water&#39;s ph very little.
