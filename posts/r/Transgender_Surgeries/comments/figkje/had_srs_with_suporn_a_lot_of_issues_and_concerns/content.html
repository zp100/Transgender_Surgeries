<p>
So I am 17 days post-op with Suporn.. Recovery has been pretty brutal, but I&#39;m managing and I have support.
</p>
<p>
There are some big positives, and quite a few negatives actually, but it&#39;s also too soon to tell for a few things.
</p>
<p>
The positive:
</p>
<p>
Dilation is going well for me. I gave myself a break with the depth, I went with 13 cm, the main reason is because I have Crohns so we wanted minimal risk with that, and also after reading the avg depth for natal women isn&#39;t super deep I felt content with just 13 cm.
</p>
<p>
The negatives:
</p>
<p>
Every time I move, I feel leftover erectile tissue flex, and I get the sensation of a super erect micropenis from hell. It&#39;s very triggering in a dysphoric way and makes it more painful with all the swelling in the area.
</p>
<p>
Seems like more swelling than usual cases, but I may be wrong.
</p>
<p>
My clitoris is very large and still looks like the head of a penis. Well it&#39;s a lot smaller than how it used to be ofc. But it must be too early to tell what it will look like, right?
</p>
<p>
I am not super patient but I know I must wait for things to sort out, but I feel like there is a good chance I will need some revisions or corrective surgeries from another surgeon.. Does anyone have good recommendations for me if I have to see other surgeons?
</p>
<p>
The worst thing overall I&#39;d say is the erectile tissue, it&#39;s a very strong sensation.
</p>
<p>
Also I already flew home to Sweden for fears of what might happen with the coronavirus in Thailand, so I am kinda regretting not staying longer because I could have addressed this with Suporn while I was there, but I just didn&#39;t think about it. üòî
</p>
<p>
Thanks for taking the time to read this ‚ò∫Ô∏è

It&#39;s maddening, it was the last thing I was expecting, to have to deal with dysphoria again because of this micropenis feeling.. It comes back every time I move and sometimes is always there!!
</p>
<p>
Revisions with erectile tissue are common? I hope it&#39;s easy to do.

The vaginal opening feels too close to where my bum is.. When I touch that area something just feels off..

<p>
The anus and vagina of cisgender women are actually quite close together.

<p>
See

for example. (Obviously not safe for work).

Oh, you&#39;re right..
</p>
<p>
Someone was telling me that it was the constructed vaginal canal that was closer to the colon than in ciswomen, I thought that meant that the vaginal opening would also be closer to the anus. üòã

I don&#39;t think that is correct either.
</p>
<p>
The vaginal canal is right next to the rectum, which is at the end of the colon.

Are you a member of the Suporn discord group? I‚Äôd expect you could get a lot of advice there.
</p>
<p>
They do have a good reputation for doing revisions so you shouldn‚Äôt have any difficulty with that when the time comes. I‚Äôd say well away from any other surgeons, you‚Äôre more likely to make things worse than help.
</p>
<p>
I never heard of anyone leaving so early. Did they say anything about that?

Oh didn&#39;t know there was a discord group.. I should join that.
</p>
<p>
Ya Dr. Suporn said it&#39;s unusual for their patients to leave early, but he understood and said it wasn&#39;t a bad idea.

It‚Äôs a secret closed group, Suporn patients only. You‚Äôll need to find someone who‚Äôs already a member. Are you still in contact with any other patients you met?

At 17 days after nothing is going to be done healing or swelling.   You won&#39;t have any idea about your final results until at least three or four months and probably closer to seven.   Assume everything you&#39;re feeling is temporary now.    Did you find the discord?
