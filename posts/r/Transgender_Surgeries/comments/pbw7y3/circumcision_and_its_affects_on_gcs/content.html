I&#39;ve had problems with my genitals for a long time. Regular pain and difficulty having sex due to phimosis.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve considered getting a circumcision as this may allow me to actually have sex and end up enjoying it.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I worry about is in also not a big fan of having a dick and may want to get a penile inversion vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Would not having a foreskin affect the surgery? And would having a foreskin that already can&#39;t stretch and gets regularly inflamed cause it&#39;s own problems?

Hi I had similar issue. I had a procedure called a dorsal slit rather than a circumcision to releive tight foreskin but at same time retain the skin.  I&#39;ll be having penile inversion in December. I had the consultation couple of weeks back and they were happy to work with this. Hope this helps - but Please note this was only my experience and the only option I had and i had to wait sometime after procedure to get confirmation from consultant it was okay to work with this. Please check all options (streching with cream??) with your doctor and ask question with surgeon if possible.

I’d say probably explore as many options as possible before getting it removed, because depending on the method it can make a difference (although maybe not as much for PI). Some surgeons use the foreskin to create the clitoral hood and part of the labia minora, which tends to create good results. Obviously a circumcision will reduce sensation too, which isn’t ideal either.
</p>
<p>
Maybe talk to a few different doctors? I’ve heard that a lot of them tend to recommend circumcision over less invasive options (which I guess isn’t surprising since it’s performed on perfectly healthy babies for no reason). Good luck!!

I had phimosis for a long time and suffered pain and irritation problems until I was circumcised myself in my early 20s. I used to think that it would make my dysphoria (albeit I didn&#39;t recognise it as dysphoria at the time) go away. What I regret now is not taking the time and giving myself the space to figure out and accept my gender for what it is and just hoping that getting circumcised would make the dysphoria disappear, because it didn&#39;t. Though I won&#39;t lie, losing the pain and irritation the phimosis caused was a benefit.
</p>
<p>
As someone has mentioned, there are surgeons who make use of the foreskin during vaginoplasty, meaning I no longer have that skin as a possible component. Which annoys me because I intend to get a vaginoplasty, and that is a sensitive piece of skin which I can no longer make use of.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d suggest you maybe give yourself some time and space to figure out what you want from your body before considering any surgeries, and perhaps consult a doctor who could suggest some ointments and stretching exercises to help relieve the phimosis in the meantime.

have you looked into more conservative treatments for phimosis?  most of the time, phimosis can be fully cured non-surgically.

The vast majority of phimosis cases can be treated with just stretches, with a prescription cream too if needed. Consider this before a circumcision.

Don’t get the circumcision. There are alternatives to that that may help relieve the pain and complications due to phimosis.

If you are going to get Bottom surgery DO NOT get a circumcision. The labia you save may be your own.
