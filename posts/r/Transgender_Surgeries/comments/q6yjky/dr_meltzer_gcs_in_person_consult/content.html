What can I expect with an in person consult with Dr. Meltzer?  Will he do a full body exam or just explain the surgery and answer my questions?

Hi! I&#39;m a patient of Dr Ley of the Meltzer clinic. I had a
<em>
very
</em>
bad experience with Dr Meltzer in a position where I felt robbed of agency and decency. Meltzer has a mean side that I would advise people to avoid him.
</p>
<p>
Dr Ley on the other hand is good people. Very upfront, and a bit funny too. I&#39;m still healing from my GCS (2 months), so I&#39;m not ready to dish out any gcs recommendations just yet. However her ffs work was amazing!
</p>
<p>
The consult with Dr Ley was via the phone, but I remember it. A lot of discussion about what you&#39;re looking for, an outline of expectations and risks, and if we were in person she would have asked to peek under the hood likely.

Please be careful with him and do your due diligence. There are some girls with horror stories regarding his results. Truly, truly jaw dropping bad results.

He was state of the art, circa 2000.   Keep in mind he does a two step procedure.
