Please mark these posts nsfw in the future. I did this one for you.

Who&#39;s the surgeon and where did you get this photo from? I&#39;ve not seen it before?

Wittenberg Heidi. Mozaic Care. Also sorry for not marking it NSFW but you don&#39;t need to be so snappy about it.

I&#39;m sorry, what are you asking opinions on? Cause a few people have commented their opinions and you&#39;ve taken that as hate. I&#39;m sorry, but this does not look good. That&#39;s my opinion.

So I&#39;m going to ask Wittenberg about only creating a vagina without a vulva and while preserving my penis. I will be having my surgery this fall. We discussed everything already during two meet ups. Now I came across someone who has had what I want already.  What are your opinions about it aesthetically? Still toying about throwing a vulvoplasty in as well.  But a vulva would be more extensive surgery and doesn&#39;t add to my needs.

I think I prefer the aesthetics with vulvoplasty, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m getting don&#39;t by her in October. Mostly I hate the position and angle that all of the photos on her website are at. I wish there was more variety to see what it would look like day to day. (This applies to photos of her non PPV work as well)
</p>
<p>
I should really ask her why she cinches so tight around the base of the shaft in the Y pattern instead of a deeper V, especially for patients with labia. I&#39;ve seen the same from another surgeon and it doesn&#39;t look quite right based on what I can see on my own body. Without the Y it seems like the penis would nest more naturally within the labia rather than sitting above them.
</p>
<p>
Whatever I end up with I plan to post a wider variety of photos because they are seriously needed for reference in the community.
</p>
<p>
Not sure if any of that helped you but hopefully it did.

I&#39;m almost tempted to have her do an orchi, and the PPT vaginoplasty and use only as much of the base of the scrotal tissue as necessary to reach the peritoneal tissue in the opening. And leave the rest of the scrotal tissue in tact. Then once things heal a bit rearrange the scrotal tissue the way I want the labia to be shaped and have someone suture it appropriately.
</p>
<p>
I think I should go to her office for another consult early next month.

It looks terrible. I was wondering what I was looking at. If you want to get that be my guest but honestly, don&#39;t expect people to be thrilled to find that in your pants. I wish I could unsee what I just saw. You asked for the harsh truth, I&#39;ll gladly give it to you.

I&#39;m not going to reply in this thread anymore. No point in replying to people who want hugboxing.  Good luck with everything.

I asked the truth. I didn&#39;t ask your mockery opinion. Because there is no way you said that without being malicious.

Honestly, if you are doing it for YOURSELF, then go ahead. But the other user have a point: Don&#39;t expect others to be thrilled to find that in your pants.
</p>
<p>
To me it seems like you are reading or watching too much hentai (which is disgusting) but if having a penis and a vagina makes you happy, and a surgeon can offer you that, then go ahead and knock yourself out.

Is this hateful response really necessary? I never watched hentai. I just don&#39;t have penile dysphoria but still want to be taken in a vagina instead of constant anal. Is

someone who watched too much hentai to you? She had the exact same procedure 18 months ago.

Exactly. I think no genitals at all would be better than having a bit of everything. And this comes from someone who already finds regular neovags off putting. Let alone badly done ones.
