oh blodyn that sounds rough... especially the cheating part, hugs offered üß°
</p>
<p>
Before I say anything I just want to make clear I haven&#39;t got the foggiest clue what I&#39;m talking about BUT
</p>
<p>
Just from intuition; theres plenty of guys with small dicks out there, find yourself a 3 or 4 inch king and enjoy getting railed... right? Many cis girls aren&#39;t size queens either and find that bigger dicks hurt.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if a neovagina is equally as stretchy but you might find that it can go beyond the limits if lubricated and coaxed. Please before you take this advice
<em>
check with someone who isn&#39;t me because I&#39;m guessing here
</em>
. But even if this isn&#39;t the case - like I said before if you find yourself a 3 inch king then he&#39;ll fit just nicely :)

I‚Äôm sorry that things have been so hard on you. Since a revision will likely be a while I think that it won‚Äôt hurt to try out. Positioning helps so maybe try to do positions where your legs are closed and straight so your thighs can provide some extra stimulation and see how that works for you and your partner?

Keep in mind that many cis women have shallow vaginas as well. I was talking with a cis woman friend the other day, and she explained that her vagina is only 3-4 inches and that she can‚Äôt take big dicks as a result. (Which, btw, she totally cast as a problem for the guys. Not her.) Get a revision when you can if it turns out to be an issue for you, but don‚Äôt let it make you feel inadequate or make you question your woman-ness.
</p>
<p>
Also: I don‚Äôt care how shallow your vagina is. You deserve a boyfriend who is faithful to you, especially while you are recovering from major surgery.

I also had 4 inches. Wasn&#39;t issue for me. But if it&#39;s 20cm dick, it&#39;s just not that comfortable painful But still possible
