I understand, I wish I could get more wet on my own, but using a silicone based lube is pretty great and can be lot of fun to apply.
</p>
<p>
I just keep a towel sort of off to the side for lube to clean my hand off.
</p>
<p>
Lube up my partner, wipe off my hand, and then put them in me.

Does it ever bother you feeling like your ability to have sex is tethered to a bottle of lube?
</p>
<p>
Like if you and your partner want to get hot and heavy in the car or on a romantic evening getaway somewhere remote? You have to insure you have a bottle of lube with you at all times

This is a great question, I&#39;ve never actually not had lube near me when I&#39;ve had sex.
</p>
<p>
Honestly it&#39;s never come up. I assume I would default to oral ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
They do have those little &#34;to-go&#34; packets of lube, but I&#39;ve never carried them. You can keep them in your car or purse.
</p>
<p>
I used olive oil from someone&#39;s kitchen once üòÖ now that I think about it. Worked just fine, kinda fun to sneak out of the bedroom and steal it.

I would be weary of olive oil since it&#39;s technically a food product. I&#39;ve read that using olive oil as a lubricant for anal can be bad bc it promotes bacterial growth. I would think it would be even worse for a vagina

Oh 100% not good for anyone&#39;s vagina. It was a one time thing, and it was fun.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t struggled too hard with any issues personally, I douche with diluted vinegar every once in a while and she&#39;s all good.

No, it smells like a vagina. I was kind of shocked by that to be honest.
</p>
<p>
Obviously I smell a bit different depending on when I&#39;ve dilated or if I&#39;ve douched recently. Not bad at all, just very vagina smelling haha

I‚Äôm not sure how far along you are, but topical E (or vaginally inserted) and women‚Äôs probiotics can help quite a bit. Every surgeon, including MacPhee tells you up front that nothing is guaranteed, but you need to do your part in the recovery to get the most out of the surgery.

Well the thing with surgeries is there is never a guarantee with anything. I dont know what her numbers are but she could have a large percentage of people who have wetness and you got to be the unlucky percentage. Not trying to forgive the surgeon mine was just very very adamant about letting me know alllll the different things that could go wrong.

I meant estradiol in general, can treat vaginal dryness with cis women but I didn&#39;t specify whether topical or not because I didn&#39;t research more than that. I&#39;m assuming topical E wouldn&#39;t be beneficial to a trans womans vagina.

Super interesting that she supposedly lied to you when I flat out asked her about this and she said that it&#39;s not possible, even with an estrogen gel applied vaginally. She said there&#39;s no point for a trans woman to use a gel down there since it&#39;s penile skin

Not really interesting at all, Macphee is a compulsive fucking liar. She lies about her credentials, her experience. When you bring up issues that are commonly treated with revisions by other, better qualified surgeons such as urethra misplacement or erectile tissue then she gaslights you, telling you you&#39;re just depressed, that there&#39;s nothing she can do and later even admitting that she is still &#34;learning&#34;. I would have had more respect if she has just told me from the initial consult that she was inexperienced.
</p>
<p>
The person I met when I went to the first consultation and the final encounter with Macphee were like two entirely different people.  And you may have an affinity towards this person but I&#39;ve spoken with several other dissatisfied patients so clearly it&#39;s not a &#34;me&#34; situation.

And I&#39;ve spoken with plenty of patients who are happy with their results post-op. The users with negative experiences tend to hang out on message boards like this while those that are happy delete their accounts and/or move on
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s fine that you&#39;ve had a negative experience. I myself have some things I&#39;d like to be revised, but literally all of those things aside from some internal hairs are purely cosmetic. Everything functions like it should and I&#39;m honestly impressed by the work she did for me because I went in with rather low expectations in terms of functionality and recovery
</p>
<p>
Going so far as to call her a liar and a butcher is taking it way too far, though and that&#39;s my problem with how you&#39;re acting about this. As I said, she has told me the complete opposite of what you&#39;re claiming she told you, so either she changed her mind on this topic or you are lying because you have negative feelings towards her

She didn&#39;t lie to you, that&#39;s great. But she most certainly has lied to me and others. She claims she trained under Bowers. Bowers own staff have denied this. When I asked her she told me she trained alongside Toby Meltzer. I asked Meltzer at the Philly trans health conference in 2018 and he didn&#39;t say that, all he said is, &#34;the work coming out of NC isn&#39;t very good&#34;.  When I went for a follow-up consultation I showed her pics of post op surgeries done in Thai and she claimed she also studied in Thailand and practiced the Thai method. This woman even opened.me.up with a speculum after I complained about the hair inside and showed me the interior with a mirror claiming that it was mucosa. She&#39;s batshit crazy and me and the other people who know this are trying to warm others from making the same mistake. This surgeon might even be worse than Rumer but only time will tell.
</p>
<p>
She also never gave a straight answer on how or if she removed the hairs that I have internally and this isn&#39;t mentioned in her informed consent. It&#39;s easy to question my statements about her but given the collective feedback she is indeed a bullshitter.  Even her own website is misleading. She&#39;s performed corrective surgery by way of too surgery for over a decade but has only been actively performing bottom surgery for roughly three years.
</p>
<p>
I live in the triangle and know another trans woman who got a botched implant from her and Macphee treated her like she was insane. I mean look for yourself at the before and after on her page in comparison to other results on here. It&#39;s clearly the work of someone who needs a lot of practice.

If by &#39;collective&#39; you mean yourself and another reddit user who happens to have a few-weeks old account, sure..
</p>
<p>
I take everything I read on the internet with a grain of salt, but regardless of whether what you say regarding your experiences is true, I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re unhappy with your results. I would just go elsewhere at this point if you feel she isn&#39;t willing to work with you to get things revised to a point where you&#39;d be happy
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen the result photos you&#39;ve posted previously and honestly the results you have are ones I would have been happy with. Just remember that before you go on and on, using words like butcher.. she did not butcher you. Butchering would involve leaving you permanently disfigured

The erectile tissue problem is one I have heard come up a few times. I hope you&#39;re able to get that sorted out
</p>
<p>
I might have the same issue (I don&#39;t know how I would tell..?) but if that&#39;s the case, I&#39;m fine with how things work and function
</p>
<p>
My biggest gripe is the internal hairs. She said she hadn&#39;t seen a patient yet who ended up with them post-scraping when I asked her if I should get my hair removed prior to surgery. I didn&#39;t realize how much pain the hairs cause until I was finally able to remove them (turns out I have somewhere between 3 and 5) and notice how much easier dilating is when they&#39;re not getting tugged on when the dilator is in. I just managed to finally get my fingernails to yank them out. 3 came out a few days ago, and I&#39;ve seen 2 others come out post-dilation in the last few months

I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m being aggressive but what you described sounds exactly like Macphee lying. When I told her that I had hair inside me she acted surprised and said I was the first patient who had this problem. This was in July 2019. She also brushed off my concerns and said they would stop growing over time. I just removed 8 last night that were super thick.

I don&#39;t think the community has really spoken much about this problem until recently. I&#39;ve read that a lot of surgeons&#39; patients have this problem
</p>
<p>
I think it was talked about less because trans women didn&#39;t want the public to know about it. Because it wasn&#39;t talked about, I don&#39;t think many are aware they have hair there

I am going to another surgeon, I wouldn&#39;t let Macphee give me a flu shot at this point. I only am trying to warm others and it is more than just me and some other few on reddit but other trans women I&#39;m the triangle have been botched by her.
</p>
<p>
I consider the fact that my clitoris doesn&#39;t have any sensation and while it might not be a physical disfigurement it has been pretty detrimental to my quality of life, along with everything else.

Of course we have. I&#39;ve seen the same side you profess but I&#39;m telling you, from one stranger on reddit, in 100% honesty that it&#39;s an act and as soon as you start to dig you find a surgeon who is very inexperienced and is misleading about her capabilities.  Plus when she is inveitably confronted with unforeseen problems or if anything doesn&#39;t go 100% smoothly then you will see, a complete Jekyll and Hyde situation.
</p>
<p>
Just read about Rumer, even she has that one or two success stories of people who are super happy but the rest of the stories aren&#39;t much different than what others are reporting about Macphee.

I&#39;ve talked to her about wanting revisions and she understood where I&#39;m coming from.. I&#39;m not sure what to tell you. She attempted to give me a clitoral hood when she originally did my surgery, but the stitching for that ended up failing and the hooding went away. I told her that I liked the way it looked immediately post op because of the hooding and that I wish it would have stayed that way, and she agreed that it looked better. She said she&#39;s going to look into ways to fix it in the future. The only other issue I really have with my vulva is that the labia majora are a little wrinkly

At no point has she given me the vibe that she&#39;s a liar or unwilling to do revisions. I do think that as a plastic surgeon she probably has to guard herself from people who want continuous revisions. GRS isn&#39;t a perfected surgery and those who get it are not going to come out of it with perfectly cis-looking genitalia. I went into it with that fact in mind. The small revisions I want have nothing to do with functionality and all have to do with making it looks more cis-looking
</p>
<p>
In terms of her skill as a surgeon, I&#39;m honestly blown away by her talent. I was expecting to be completely out of it post op and yet I bounced back incredibly quickly. It felt like the anesthesia took more out of me than the surgery itself did. All of my scars have healed to be nearly invisible, as well

I can also say recovery for me was a breeze. I have a friend however who had surgery a month before and Macphee hit a nerve deep inside where the vaginal canal was placed. She cauterized it but my friend was in severe pain for well over a month. To this day she can&#39;t penetrate or dilate more than a few inches inside bc it&#39;s as if the vagina has collapsed in on itself.  So her results I would say are still hit or miss in terms of recovering.

I am speaking as someone who has done research only! My consult is with Dr. Stiller next month, but from what I have heard and read,  the right hormone balance can help. More testerone- believe it or not- even in cis woman is a factor in lubrication and sex drive. Something trans woman completely lack  testosterone post srs from what I&#39;ve read. But I also just recently read that the endocrine system may try to pump out T after surgery as a response to the shock of losing the testes or whatever the reason they gave.
