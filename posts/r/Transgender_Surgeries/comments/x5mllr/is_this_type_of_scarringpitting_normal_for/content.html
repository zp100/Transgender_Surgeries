Is this type of scarring/pitting normal for electrolysis? How can I get it to go away/be less noticable? More context in comments.

No, that is NOT normal. At all. People tend to overreact to minor redness, swelling and skin color changes after electrolysis and imagine “skin damage” where there isn’t any. This is NOT one of those cases. This isn’t a normal reaction and those pits possibly will not totally resolve, though after a year they may be far better. Do not go back to this person and get a second and third opinion elsewhere.

Yeah. I thought she was bsing me by saying it was normal. I&#39;m really upset now because my hair was faint enough that you can&#39;t really see it, but I just hated the feeling of it, but now I&#39;m stuck with this annoying proof of me trying to get rid of it.

The big thing now is to let it heal. Don’t pick at it or use aggressive skin care or acids or “13 steps” or whatever. Stay out of the sun and use a really bland moisturizer and a daily sunscreen. I’d also see a dermatologist for medical advice.

Yeah. I&#39;ll go see a different dermatologist for suggestions on reducing the scars, and I&#39;ll look for electrolysis elsewhere if I can find someone else in my town. Thank you for the advice.

If it helps any, my godmother (CIS AFAB) has scars like this all over her face from acne.

If anyone asks, just say it&#39;s from that. No reason whatsoever to think otherwise

i was going to suggest dermarolling or CO2 laser too, also i think that with a few modifications your anti-aging cream might become a perfect scar reduction cream in this case (maybe adding hyaluronic acid, B5 and collagenase?)

I had to take accutane five times. Acne scarring and these sort of injuries are something I take almost personally.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had fraxel more times than I can count. Does make your skin look smooth as glass though.

It didn&#39;t in my experience, and I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s even true. If I remember some senators kid killed themselves on it and after that they went on like a campaign against it.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I was never happier than when I was on accutane as a teenager. Suddenly I had completely clear skin after years of horrible acne.
</p>
<p>
Definitely caused me some joint pain, and I&#39;m probably not as tall as I would have been had I not taken it. I&#39;ve got size 15 feet and I was supposed to cap out between 6 ft 4 to 6 ft 5 and I&#39;m only 6 ft 3.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, I&#39;m very glad I took it. I never had any psychiatric issues with it.

<p>
I&#39;d say it is absolutely true, we know it induces cell death in the hippocampus, it inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis, increases the amount of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the brain (which is one consistent finding in corpses of people dead by suicide and in live suicidal people) along with disrupting the structure of dopamine receptors, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission, it increases the amount of serotonin reuptake pumps (decreasing available serotonin in the synaptic cleft) we also think (keyword here is think) that it disrupts the frontal lobe of the brain and the striatum
</p>
<p>
but yes, it is a life saver, although an unpleasant and potentially dangerous one for some

It&#39;s an interesting thing about the 5-ht1a. I would think that that would cause more anxiety issues than depression.
</p>
<p>
I had seen a lot of early studies on this when I was in med school that were questionable as to whether or not it was legit. And I always wondered whether or not it was actually a thing or something that was pushed heavily due to the pressure from that one suicide. Now I need to go do some new reading on this. I appreciate you pulling this out. I didn&#39;t know that there was more modern data that indicated that there were actually physiologic.  processes such as these that are measurable from it

some studies say 5-ht1a expression in depression is increased, other decreased and others no different from control, however it seems that messing around with it is not a good thing regardless (a good study to start with would be

For context: I started electrolysis in June on my face before I quickly focused the area of focus to be elsewhere due to having bottom surgery scheduled and realizing that electrolysis would take longer. The few procedures we did on my face have well healed completely by now expect this spot which looks ugly and scarred. I asked my electrolysis doc about this, and she replied that pitting was a normal side effect of the procedure and usually goes away in 2-4 weeks. When I told her that this was from an appointment done months ago, she said that it usually takes 2-4 months to heal. I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s bsing me on that. None of the other regions she&#39;s done result in this awful scarred texture, but I&#39;m worried if I should stop going to her when we switch back to doing my face because I don&#39;t want more pockmarked sections. If there&#39;s a way to make these scars less noticable or to go away completely though, I would love to know how.
</p>
<p>
Edit: for all those that are asking, this was thermolysis

Lasers at dermatologists or paramedical skincare clinics I bet would take it away. They normally use lasers for acne scars. Ask your esthetician which is the best treatment. Otherwise trentinoin fades scars and helps improve their depth faster. Sunscreen will help your immune response by preventing uv rays that suppress your immune system. Skincare wise, products with centella asiatica are commonly used for wound healing.

It does not, unfortunately. The coloration does though so now it&#39;s as noticeable in pictures. Only when you&#39;re more close up.

As others have said that’s not standard.
</p>
<p>
I’ve never dealt w pitting like that from electrolysis but I have mild versions of it from acne due to over-shaving (I have very thick, sharp facial hair).
</p>
<p>
I’m planning on treating it with laser resurfacing. There are a number of dermatological procedures that can address that if you want. I’ve had some success with lessening appearance w a daily retinol serum after they’d healed, but I believe Aesthetician work may be necessary to fully resolve them.

Yeah. I was thinking of going to a separate dermatologist to see if they have any suggestions for the best way to remove it from their end of at least make them nearly invisible because as is, the scars are painfully obvious even with some concealer.

Hope it works out well for you. And Fwiw I would never clock those as hair removal related. You mentioned them being evidence of the electrolysis but I think most would assume acne related.

I’ve met cis girls with very similar spots on their skin from puberty.

Thank you for the assurance ;~; Knowing that acne scars are so common at least alleviates some dysphoria associated with it.

Absolutely not.  I have been doing electrolysis for 2 years.  There has been no scarring.  Does my face hurt and get red and irritated yes and also sore after anything longer than a 1 hr session.   My beard is finally disappearing and I have soft skin and no scars.  See someone with lots of experience with transgender women.

I&#39;ve done electrolysis on myself without any training, and even I haven&#39;t managed to cause damage this bad... Either whoever did this is incompetent, or your skin is extra-sensitive.

I&#39;m sorry that this happened to you.
</p>
<p>
Hair in the corners of the upper lip can be very stubborn, and practitioners are often eager to turn up the power and overtreat to get a good release. This is the outcome, unfortunately. I see this far more often with thermolysis, but it can happen with galvanic as well.
</p>
<p>
Lasers aren&#39;t going to do much beyond soften the edges. I&#39;d recommend finding a dermatologist who specializes in TCA CROSS. It&#39;s a manual technique that can fill in ice-pick scars. The only dermatologist who does this procedure that I have personal experience with is Dr Rullan in Chula Vista, just outside of San Diego. He&#39;s very good.
</p>
<p>
Electrologists in general will not admit fault. Once they do, it opens them up to lawsuits. That&#39;s why you hear a lot of &#34;that&#39;s normal&#34;, &#34;it will heal in two years&#34;, etc.

I have the same issue. I thought it was from bad technique, but I went somewhere else and happens there too. Both places are highly rated. I’ve been going for a few years and I’m getting close to being finished. My dermatologist recommends laser treatment once I’m finished. Some people just have sensitive skin, and as a red head I’m one of them.

Yeah. The place I went to was highly rated, and one of my other trans friends recommended her, so there is a potential that it&#39;s a me thing. I partially think maybe I didn&#39;t take care of it properly in the after care since the stuff she has done for bottom hair removal hasn&#39;t left any scars. This is the only place.

If you’re in the US there is a website electrology.com where you can find certified electrologists along with the method they do near you. Maybe that’ll help?

<p>
When I was doing this I was told to only use Galvanic as it is the most reliable and least damaging.  No heat means it doesn&#39;t destroy keratin like heat does (which causes pitting).  I was told this by several electrologists and by my dermatologist.  This is the only type I will ever do on my face, it does take longer though per hair.  I will use the blend method on my genitals though to prep for SRS.

For those who may come to this post later and wonder how it looks now, the scars are still present and you can feel them although it isn&#39;t super easy to see them. I used scar away to help it heal better and the discoloration went away at least. I discontinued electrolysis for this scaring. I hate the texture of the scared skin. Unfortunately, I only have one electrolysist in my town, so I&#39;m kinda stuck with facial hair for now.

I’ve had close to 20hrs of electrolysis on my face and haven’t seen anything like that at all.  Something Was wrong with how the tech performed the procedure for you. I’m sorry.  I hope you can get profession help to resolve it if it really bothers you :/  On the other hand, I would assume it is acne scarring at first glance.

It looks like what happened to me with galvanic electrolysis. The owner told me the same thing. She was full of shit and fucked up my face. Now I’m doing thermolisis, which is much more gentle to the surrounding tissue. Eventually, I’ll have to have RF microneedling to try and heal the scar tissue.

Thanks. It&#39;d be nice to hear your experience with RF microneedling. I have a lot of white dots from galvanic overtreatment that I&#39;m hoping to improve, but I believe it&#39;s a long shot.

The textural issues of my upper lip were improved greatly by TCA CROSS and a few peels.

It is no longer red, but it is still very much scarred after using scar treatment. If you are having similar pitting, I would not recommend continuing with your doc unless you are okay with a completely scarred face. I did not continue treatment after this issue.

What I would recommend is Laser the laser not only kills the hair but  also regenerate collagen back into the skin.  You go to this laser for your face once a month and you will notice the difference buy 8 months I was pretty much cleaned up because I do not have coarse hair on my face and body so I was very lucky lol

The laser for hair removal does not induce callagen growth. But you could try medical needling, fractional ablative co2 or erb:yag laser or/and tca peelings six months after the damage. Until then people should care for propper healing by using scar treatments like silicon and pathenol containg creames.  Most important: SPF 50 + !!! Every day !!!

This looks like overtreatment, or too much power for your particular skin.  You look like you have reddish hair?  Personal opinion--Redheads are easier to overtreat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Try another electrologist
</strong>
before going back to whomever did this.
</p>
<p>
And you should also notify whomever did this, because they need to know.  There&#39;s no offense; one should try different electrologists to find the right one.

These aren’t normal. I’m sorry this happened it could be from a too high settings that burned most of the tissue? I would try microneedle roller every other day + vit c and see how that goes.

Clear iodine can help minimize scar tissue just be sure it&#39;s not an open wound, apply nightly before bed for best absorption and try to wear a light spf in the sunlight to help it from scarring

I’d say no. Especially if other areas are ok.  Do you know what method is being used? Blend(thermolysis &amp; galvanic) thermolysis (heat also be) or pure galvanic?
</p>
<p>
I get weapy light scabbing and swelling from galvanic but I’ve never had pitted healing unless I’ve made the mistake to pick at things too much. And even then it not like you show.
</p>
<p>
I know it’s hard but try not to shave for while day of treatment. And again as others have said. No makeup or doing anything to remove the natural scabbing few a few days after. Yep it look bad I know.

Which is using heat to burn/kill the follicle. If this gets too hot you burn the surrounding tissue and I’d say that is your issue.

I explained this in the context comment, but the appointment that made these was in June. I did a few appointments on my face before switching to bottom stuff because it takes so long, and I needed that done before surgery first. The other sessions marks healed except for these ones. I asked the electrologist if this this normal, and she said they should go away in 2-4 months normally which didn&#39;t feel right considering everything else had healed and this was from one of the earliest appointments I had with her.

laser skin resurfacing or chemical peels done by a professional can help reduce the appearance of scarring.
