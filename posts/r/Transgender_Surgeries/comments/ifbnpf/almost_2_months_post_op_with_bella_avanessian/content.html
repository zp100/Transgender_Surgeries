I&#39;m getting pretty close to 2 months post op and wanted to share more about the experience so far.  I previously made a post about my hospital experience
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/hlw8rs/3_days_post_op_with_bella_avanessian_vaginoplasty/">here</a>
so this will be about everything after getting home from the hospital.  For reference, I had surgery Thursday July 2nd 2020.

<p>
<strong>
First week at home:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
After getting home things continued mostly as they did in the hospital.  I mostly stayed in bed, needed a lot of help moving around since I had the catheter and the wound vac to deal with.  Pro tip: have someone hold that stuff behind you and walk in front of them.  If they&#39;re in front of you with all that stuff its a lot easier to trip over tubes.  I still had barely any pain, mostly just discomfort from laying down and also gas.  I think the gas dissipated after a couple more days, finally.
</p>
<p>
Sticking to the medication schedule was a lot more annoying once I was home.  In the hospital they gave me pills every 6/8 hours so I had 12am, 1am, 6am, 9am, 12pm, 5pm, and 6pm.  To simplify things I moved the 1am pill to 12am.  It was gabapentin and moving it up an hour didn&#39;t cause any issues with pain management.  Also I wasn&#39;t going to ask my boyfriend to wake up to give me pills at 6am, so what we did was set them aside before bed and I had an alarm set to wake me up.  As well as reminders on my phone for all the other times of the day I needed to take meds.  Also at this point I wasn&#39;t sleeping very well due to having to stay on my back and various sources of discomfort.  I was getting maybe a couple hours sleep at a time.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and since it was something I wasn&#39;t sure about before surgery, the most convenient thing to lounge/sleep in is a nightgown, especially with all the tubes coming out of you.  I used a bed pad just in case, but at this point with the wound vac nothing was coming out of me and going anywhere besides the catheter or the wound vac.  The bed pad was pristine the whole time so if you have a wound vac after surgery, do yourself a favor and save the pads for later.
</p>
<p>
After being home for a couple days I got a call from visiting nurses of new york and they scheduled someone to come check on me.  The nurse came on Monday and checked everything out, took my vitals, and helped me walk around a bit.  I was standing while talking to her and I happened to pass some gas.  I had been passing tons of gas for days and didn&#39;t think anything of it... until I looked down.  I had apparently shit on the floor.  At this point I was still taking stool softener since we were 5 days out from surgery and still didn&#39;t have a bowel movement.  I promptly stopped after that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
End of week 1 - First followup appointment:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had surgery on a Thursday and the following Wednesday I had my first followup appointment.  That morning, the wound vac decided it was time to start leaking air.  It had been fine for an entire week, and everyone told me about how it might leak so many times that I was ready for it to be a constant issue.  But that thing held in there till the very last day for me.  The leak was pretty small I think because it would re-seal if I moved around a bit.  I never actually found where it was leaking from, but it kept working on and off (mostly on) until I got to my appointment.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t take any additional pain killers before coming to the appointment since my pain levels had been so low the entire time since surgery.  I got to the office for my appointment and checked in and they pretty much took me to a room right away.  The first person to come in and see me was one of the PAs (physician assistants).  After exchanging pleasantries he proceeded to take the tape off the held the catheter in place on my leg.  This was easy, it dissolves with alcohol and came off with no fuss.  Now came the wound vac tape.  This tape, very much unlike the catheter tape, does not dissolve in anything.  Its made to really really stay there because the wound vac is dependent on an air tight seal that lasts for days with you moving around.  It took quite some time and pain, but eventually all the tape came off.  At the edges around where the tape was you&#39;ll have some residue where it migrated a bit and lint and such gets caught in the residual glue.  They told me it would take a few weeks for that to come off, but I was able to pick it all off within a few days.
</p>
<p>
After removing all those fun adhesives from my body the PA took the catheter out.  I was dreading this part the most as I didn&#39;t know what to expect.  He had me lay back, told me to take a deep breath in, and that he was going to remove it when I exhaled.  This went perfectly.  It hurt a little for maybe a split second and it was over.  Way less dramatic than I expected.  Next came the vaginal packing though, which is a bit more dramatic.  It feels very strange as they pull it out, especially when they get to the knots.  The way they pack the vagina is by tying lengths of gauze together and well, packing it in.  As they pull it out it comes out easily until they get to a knot which you&#39;ll feel as some extra pressure as its dislodged.  The knots can hurt a little, but for the most part this whole process just tickles.  The worst part for me was the packing around the clit as it was extremely sensitive.
</p>
<p>
After removing the packing he explained and demonstrated dilating.  This went very well and he made a joke about having to get a string attachment to fish the dilator out of me if it went in any further.  It was able to go past the 5th dot on the dilator.  He removed the dilator and then asked me to do it, this also went fine.  No pain or discomfort from dilating.  While I still had the dilator in me Bella came in and she immediately wanted to take a photo of it.  She loves her photos.  I guess they do help a lot if she can refer back to what things looked like at certain points... but it did feel weird at first.
</p>
<p>
Once done with photos Bella pointed out all my new anatomy and explained what everything is.  She examined everything to make sure things are healing right and also checked to see if my clit was sensitive.  I nearly jumped off the table.  Yes, it was.  She answered all my questions and then I got to wear underwear for the first time since surgery.  It was so nice not having to tuck anything, but I did have to put on a sanitary pad.  When I got home later I immediately wanted to take a shower.  I got undressed and saw myself in the mirror without any tape or coverings or random tubes for the first time.  I now understand gender euphoria.  If you could have seen my face light up in that moment, it was pure happiness.
</p>
<p>
As I progressed through that day I started feeling the urge to pee but nothing ever came out.  I eventually managed to go but the stream would only go for a couple seconds before stopping.  Then I would have to concentrate to get it going again, and this would repeat for about 10 minutes before my bladder was empty.  I emailed Bella that night and she said something is probably swollen due to the catheter and it should clear up on its own.  It took a couple days before I was peeing normally.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Trip to the ER:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Three days after my followup (Saturday) was the second time I had a bowel movement.  If you recall, earlier I mentioned that I stopped taking stool softener that Monday after getting diarrhea.  Well, my body can&#39;t make up its mind because this time I was a little constipated.  I ended up straining a bit.  As I got up to wipe myself I felt a series of what felt like something popping inside of me and the left half of my vulva began to swell up, getting tighter and tighter to the point that I thought it was going to explode if there was any more pressure.  Well, instead of exploding blood started streaming out of the sutures right at the bottom of my vagina.  I called my boyfriend for help and he called 911.  I had no idea what was really happening at the time but I remember wondering if I was going to die.  What if I bleed out on the floor before an ambulance gets here?  Now is a good time to mention I have anxiety issues and am prone to panic attacks.  Somehow, for some reason, I did not have a panic attack.  It&#39;s amazing how calm I was while simultaneously contemplating my death.  Looking back it almost seems surreal now.
</p>
<p>
While waiting for the EMTs my boyfriend and a friend of ours who happened to be over at the time helped lay me down on the floor.  I was afraid to move much with my vulva the way it was, it still felt like it was going to explode.  The EMTs got there within a few minutes of calling and spent most of the time trying to figure out wtf to do with me.  They ended up wrapping me up in gauze and putting an ice pack on me.  They put me in a wheel chair and took me out to the ambulance and they spent another good deal of time trying to get approval to take me to the ER that my surgeon specified.
</p>
<p>
Once at the ER, they processed me and checked my vitals.  They said it was probably just hematoma as I didn&#39;t seem to still be bleeding, but I had to wait a couple hours for one of Bella&#39;s PAs to come see me.  He checked me out and called Bella.  They had originally offered to try and drain some of the blood but Bella said to just leave it alone.  That was a huge relief because both methods they mentioned for draining the blood sounded terrifying.  They discharged me eventually, after waiting around for an additional couple of eternities.  If you ever thought the ER was a fast paced environment, you&#39;d be sadly mistaken.
</p>
<p>
Up until this point I had almost no pain.  Pain is mostly caused by swelling and I didn&#39;t really have any.  But now that I had the hematoma, I had swelling.  The next couple weeks were a bit rougher for pain, especially when standing or walking, or moving in general.  I still didn&#39;t take any opiates though, it was worse than before but still not enough to warrant the big guns.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Week 2:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The following Wednesday I had my second follow up.  This is the first time Bella saw the hematoma in person.  She checked me out, took more photos, answered more questions.  Normally the second week is when she has people start sizing up the dilators.  With the hematoma she said I should hold off for a bit.  I also asked her about douching since the instructions I got from the hospital said to get a douche bottle and start douching at 2 weeks.  She had no idea the instructions said that, so apparently whatever the hospital hands out is not actually her advice.  She suggested instead of douching to just use a detachable shower head on its least powerful setting possible.
</p>
<p>
I waited a few more days before starting to size up to the blue dilator and didn&#39;t have any issues when I did.  It had no issue going to full depth on the first try.  Despite the instructions saying to &#34;quickly size up&#34; I didn&#39;t think it would be a good idea to try the green dilator just yet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Week 3:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Uneventful week, all things proceeded as mentioned earlier.  No appointment this week or anything, kept sticking with the purple and blue dilators.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Week 4 5 and 6:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I finally decided to try the green dilator in week 4.  It didn&#39;t go in all the way and was kinda tight so I was afraid to push too hard.  When I went for my third followup appointment I mentioned this to Bella and she said that as long as I go to full depth with the largest dilator I can for at least 10 minutes, I can use the next size up for whatever time is left at whatever depth it gets to.  The most important thing is that you spend enough time at full depth with what you can.  So my routine became using the purple for 10 minutes, blue for 15 minutes, and then green for the last 5.  After a few days of this I slowly gave the green a little more time and the purple a little less until the green was at full depth.  At that point I was doing 5 minutes purple, 15 min blue, and 10 min green.  It was still a little tight at that point so I wanted to give myself more time on the blue before going up to the green.  This was mostly due to the hematoma putting pressure on the canal.
</p>
<p>
Also at my 1 month follow up she removed some external granulation and applied silver nitrate.  This healed up really well in one spot but came back in force in the larger area that was treated.  Theres a picture of this in my imgur link at the beginning of this post.
</p>
<p>
I kept looking at that orange dilator wondering if there was any way it would ever fit in me.  I think around week 6 I decided to give it a try.  At this point the hematoma had calmed down a lot.  It went in a bit but damn was it tight.  I was afraid of hurting myself because things were still pretty numb down there at this point so I let it go for a few days.
</p>
<p>
Around this time the hematoma is also no longer causing me any pain, mobility is getting a lot easier and I&#39;m doing more things around the apartment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Week 7:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had a large amount of wound separation due to the hematoma on the left side of my vagina.  This was treated with silver nitrate but didn&#39;t heal and turned into more granulation.  I emailed Bella and she prescribed me a steroid cream instead of having to come in for another appointment.  With the steroid cream its healing very well and has significantly diminished.
</p>
<p>
I also went back to work this week.  Well, &#34;to&#34; is a bad word, I&#39;m working from my bed.  Thankfully my job can mostly be done remotely.  Around week 7 I also began trying the orange dilator again and just like the green started slowly working it into my routine.  A few days later, I can now get the orange dilator to just about full depth but its not
<em>
quite
</em>
there yet.  We&#39;re talking millimeters though.  I think in the next few days I should be hitting full depth with orange.  Right now my routine is purple for 5 min, blue for 5 min, green for 10 min, and orange for 10 min.
</p>

<p>
I probably should have made a post sooner so I didn&#39;t have to remember so much at once from several weeks ago, but here we are.  Also sorry for how long this is.  If anything has anything they want me to add or wants to ask any questions I&#39;m always happy to help.

Yeah, she&#39;s great.
</p>
<p>
And that really is the best feeling ever.  And also like, every time I put my underwear on and I remember I don&#39;t have to worry about tucking.

Very nice results! Very similar to my own at those stages (Iâ€™m now 19 months post with Ting). You seem to have less swelling than I did. I didnâ€™t have any granulation or bleeding - that sounds so scary!
</p>
<p>
Congratulations!

Thanks.  The hematoma was pretty scary.  And yeah, I had basically no swelling before the hematoma.  Every doctor nurse and PA who saw me was completely shocked how little swelling there was lol

I had a pretty visible hematoma right on my pubic mound - it took almost 2 months for that to reabsorb and go away.

Looks awesome for 2 months- thanks for sharing!!
</p>
<p>
And of all the surgery stories Iâ€™ve read, the packing removal feeling weird is seemingly the one constant.

Just curious, you had the hybrid peritoneal surgery?   Or PI?  I&#39;m having PPT with Dr. Wittenberg in May, but it seems like your experience should have a decent amount of parallels.  Thanks for the detailed writeup!

Wow, I guess I never mentioned that anywhere haha.  I had PI.  Wittenberg uses one of those fancy abdominal robots and I personally know 2 people who went with a surgeon who uses a robot (one of them was wittenberg) and they healed MUCH faster, so our experiences will probably be a bit different

Understood.  I thought Avanessian also used robotics, at least for the peritoneal surgeries.  I guess not for PI though.

I don&#39;t think she uses one at all.  The only surgeon I know of in NYC who uses a robot is bluebond-lagner.  I considered her as well, because with the robot theres lower risks for certain complications, but she had a 2 year wait for a consult so I went with Bella

Yeesh.  BBL had a 13-month wait for my consult.  I thought that was bad enough.  I tried to get a consult with Avanessian, but her staff does not seem very responsive.

Mount Sinai is not super awesome at communication.  You have to keep on top of them.  Bella herself is pretty responsive though and usually answers my emails within a couple hours.  Things were really rough when the pandemic started because I had no idea if my surgery was getting canceled or not.  The mount sinai LGBT clinic was supposed to reach out to me to schedule my laser sessions and they never did, so I had to keep calling and trying to get a hold of people to get that sorted out (and then 4 of my 6 sessions got canceled because of corona).  And then same thing with the surgical office, I had to try a few times to get a hold of someone there to find out if my surgery was still happening.

That&#39;s... not really reassuring.  I&#39;m glad it worked out for you in the end though.  Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s office has been much more responsive.

I&#39;m used to it.  All of the LGBT clinics in NYC suck.  It took me years just to find a decent primary doctor.

I had mine 8 days ago and on day 6 when the pack came out for me I got a massive hematoma. Iâ€™m so glad to see yours turned out ok as mine looks vicious right now.

Yeah it was rough for a bit after the hematoma.  You&#39;ll get through it!

Thanks so much. Iâ€™m currently dealing with terrible constipation and hopefully I can solve that soon as I barely strained earlier and started bleeding ðŸ˜©

Just keep taking stool softener, drink lots of water, eat stuff with fiber.  Apples, popcorn, raspberries, almonds are good sources of fiber.  Just a random selection of ones I happen to enjoy
