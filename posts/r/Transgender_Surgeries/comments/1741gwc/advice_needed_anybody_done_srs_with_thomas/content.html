Hi all! ðŸ’• Thomas Satterwhite is a little bit of an enigma to me. I see very little posts about him relating to vaginoplasty, but I also have never seen anything negative said about him or his work. From my consults he seems like a very kind and knowledgeable doctor, but I was hoping to get some feedback from all of you! :) or any warnings I should heed ðŸ«£

I have only talked to Debby thus far. she was knowledgeable and friendly. Dr. Satterwhite was unavailable for my consultation. I am also wondering what former/present patients have to say about his workâ€¦

I had surgery with Align, not with Dr. Satterwhite specifically.

It was good overall. The staff was nice and helpful. Aftercare good. I had Dr. Rodriguez, who I followed from Crane. Sheâ€™s moved into her own practice recently. I was happy with my results.

Thomas Satterwhite and Debbie Anziano did my original reassignment surgery in Feb. 2018, then a revision cosmetic surgery in Nov. 2018.Â  I flew from Tucson back to SF for the revision surgeryÂ  and then returned to Tucson the following Monday after seeing Satterwhite for a very rushed post op, He YANKED the drainage tubes out and sent me on my way.Â  After returning home I had complications, extreme swelling and pain in my right outer labia.Â  I called Satterwhite for help the entire month of December 2018, could not reach him, was constantly told they would give him the message.Â  He finally called me back Jan. 16th 2019, after a month and a half, I begged him for help, and was told it was normal, and was charged $500 for a 5-minute phone call.Â  I reported my complications directly to Debbie Anziano via her cell phone, I was told it was just probably fat necrosis and normal.Â  I begged them for help after the surgery and got nothing.Â  Late December 2018 I used a mirror and saw something grey in the right labia surgical area, it was not normal so I pulled on it gently with a pair of tweezers, it was stretchy, I gently pulled on it, it was a 6 inch piece of drain tubing that had snapped off and was left inside me the day Satterwhite yanked the tubes out.Â  I called Debbie Anziano over and over, telling her that my right labia was very swollen and sore, and that I could feel a lump in it, again I was told it was normal, and probably just fat necrosis. I was so swollen and sore that I could barely walk.Â  I called Debbie Anziano and ask her to send me a prescription for antibiotics to Tucson, at which time she did, but told me not to take them, two weeks later I told her that I was still in great pain, which time she told me to send her a picture of the surgical area, she immediately responded start taking the antibiotics.Â  Once I removed that tube, it was like &#34;my water broke&#34;, leaking down my legs and onto my floor, but the pain subsided, but I my labia was still grossly engorged, with a hard object I could feel inside.Â  I can&#39;t tell you how many times I asked Debbie Anziano for help directly via text messages and phone calls between 2018 and 2021, and she did nothing but tell me she thought &#34;I should just get out more&#34;.Â  In January of 2020 I started having severe issues not being able to have bowel movements, which I thought might have something to do with my reassignment surgery.Â  Again I begged Debbie Anziano for help because none of the doctors in Tucson we&#39;re familiar with the surgery I had.Â  I felt the bowel issue was connected to my reassignment surgery, but could find nobody in Tucson or where I live in New Mexico now to confirm this, as the doctors in Tucson and New Mexico are simply not familiar with these surgical procedures.Â  In February of 2024 this year it was discovered that I had a complete neovagina prolapse, and while the doctors were looking at the imaging, Dr Max Gallegos at unmh Albuquerque discovered an unspecified medical device in my right labia. On February 26th 2024, I had surgery at unmh Albuquerque to repair the neo vagina prolapse, at which time Dr Max Gallegos removed the unspecified medical device from my right labia. Prior to having this removed my right labia was completely deformed, literally hanging down, with a hard ball in the center. Finally after 6 years I&#39;m not in pain and I&#39;m not deformed. I begged Debbie Anziano for help over and over again, and they did NOTHING. It was a horrible experience to say the least.Â  Even after the surgery in February 2024 I am still unable to have bowel movements. I am positive my bowel issues are a result of my reassignment affirmation surgery, and while the surgery at unmh Albuquerque corrected the neo vagina prolapse and colon rectocele, I am still unable to have bowel movements.Â  I am in pain all the time, unable to have bowel movements, with no doctors in New Mexico, even at unmh Albuquerque, that are familiar enough with the surgery performed by Thomas Satterwhite to help me.Â  I honestly want to die.
