I think the before and after you&#39;re giving us makes it difficult for me to tell what happened. You passed really well before, or at least at that angle. Some side shots would probably show the after stuff a lot better.

The picture I posed is mostly to highlight the jaw reduction, the lower half of my face is noticeably narrower than in the before photo.
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/v8OsamM">Here&#39;s
</a>
A side-shot comparison if that helps with looking at the overall changes!
</p>
<p>
I almost always passed even before my surgery, but I had huge insecurity and dysphoria issues about it and decided to get surgery anyway.
</p>
<p>
Maybe my results aren&#39;t helpful but I figured I&#39;d throw them out there since I would have loved to find more info on my doctor when doing research ¯_(ツ)_/¯

Hi Shaqueta. It was nice to see this side-by-side comparison. I can tell the difference and why you wanted to have the surgery. I am in the same position with my jaw! It just needs to be a tad narrower. I plan on visiting Keojampa for this same surgery. Thank you for this!

I had FFS with Dr. Keojampa around the end of March. The left photo was taken 3 days before and the right about 5 weeks after.
</p>
<p>
I had two areas done, my forehead (Type 3, orbital shaping, etc) and a jaw reduction.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/93iMRM3">Here
</a>
are photos of my before and after CT scans of the areas.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have a frontal sinus so my forehead reduction was minimal, though I do think it made a difference that doesn&#39;t appear in photos very well. In the CT scan photos you can clearly see the bone that was removed as well as the bone on the orbital rims that was removed.
</p>
<p>
The jaw reduction is the most obvious change. You can see there was no height reduction of the chin and that was intentional, as both Dr. Keojampa and I agreed that the chin height was fine.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m pretty happy with it, I still have a little bit of healing to go, so maybe I&#39;ll like it even more in the future!
</p>
<p>
I made my booking in late November and was able to schedule in late March.
</p>
<p>
Cost for both was 24k (could have gone for the trach shave at 30k but that was out of my price range) and I paid out of pocket / with financing, though he does accept insurance.
</p>
<p>
If you have any other questions feel free to ask!

I know you probably don&#39;t want to hear this, and I&#39;m not saying this to be mean (I think
<strong>
both
</strong>
photos are very attractive); but I thought the left photo was the
<em>
after
</em>
, not the the before.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Especially
</em>
the side views because the &#34;Adams Apple&#34; wasn&#39;t as prominent, I thought you had a trach shave (which you didn&#39;t). I was
<em>
astounded
</em>
by the lack of scarring and healing just 5 weeks post-op.
</p>
<p>
We are our own worst critics, but I think you were fine
<em>
before
</em>
.

The Adam&#39;s apple thing likely just has to do with slightly different lighting in the after photo, there&#39;s more shadows on my neck in general. Weird though! When I look at the photos, I see a pretty decent reduction in jaw width and on the side I think my forehead is definitely flatter
</p>
<p>
Scaring is all back in my hair and the last of my inter-oral stitches just dissolved, the fact I had surgery is pretty hidden once the bruising went away!
</p>
<p>
As far as being fine before, I knew I passed for a long time and that I&#39;d be fine in that regard, but I just couldn&#39;t shake the insecurity and the dysphoria. I probably didn&#39;t
<em>
need
</em>
it, but it was for me, and as long as I look better and not worse I&#39;m pretty happy! I feel like I&#39;m a lot more comfortable with how I look, even if the changes aren&#39;t that observable in photos I guess 🤷

Your results are so great! Especially your forehead #.# . I would think at 5 weeks you would still have a lot of swelling though. Also thanks for posting scans~

Awesome results!  I have a consult with Dr. K later this month, so this makes me happy to see!
</p>
<p>
If you don’t mind, I have a couple of questions.  Were you able to get insurance coverage for the procedures you had done?  Also anything someone who might also go to him might need to know?

I wasn’t but I didn’t even try because I knew my insurance provider wouldn’t cover the procedures, I know they frequently deal with insurance but I did not go through that channel
</p>
<p>
Don’t be afraid to ask questions! He’s very thorough and knowledgeable so if there’s anything you aren’t sure on you can always ask

Do you have a before and after of your forehead in harsh lighting?
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s where you can see the difference because in this lighting you can&#39;t really see much.

Hmm what do you mean harsh lighting? And from what angle do you mean? There’s only so many profile photos I have on the “before” category
</p>
<p>
It’s not a very dramatic change but I did not have a lot of prominence beforehand

7500 fee + 1200/hr for operating room and anesthesiologist fees (for me the jaw portion was estimated to take 2 hours, so 2400) + $300 fee for the recovery room (not overnight)
</p>

All told about $10200

ofc the final price can depend on a number of varying factors, but this is what it cost me
