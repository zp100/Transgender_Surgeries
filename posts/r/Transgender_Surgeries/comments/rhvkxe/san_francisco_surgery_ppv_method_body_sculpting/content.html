Hi everyone. I am planning to have my surgeries next year. First vaginoplasty. Has anyone done vaginoplasty in SF with the PPV method? It is the only method I desire. Would you mind sharing your prep and post care? You can dm me if it suits you.
</p>
<p>
Next tracheal shave in SF - what are your experiences with surgeons getting it right? I want no scarring after recovery what was the timeframe for recovering from tracheal shave and were your scarred completely healed? Has anyone done the scarless method with incision in the under lip?
</p>
<p>
Body contouring- I am wanting to sculpt my body waist, thigh and butt slightly for an overall natural look. I am thin 6&#39;1&#34; and 140 pounds so there is not much fat to graft but I wondering if anyone with similar build has undergone body sculpting and what were your results. I am not interested in implants for body conturing. Also if anyone has had favorable results non surgically please chime in!
</p>

THANK YOU ALL FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES! It really helps me understand what and how to prepare myself.

I had PPV with Dr Wittenberg in SF a little over a year ago.  I wrote about it some on
<a href="http://androgyny2018.tumblr.com" rel="nofollow">http://androgyny2018.tumblr.com
</a>
which I would trust better than my current recollection of events.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m open to questions by comment or DM.
