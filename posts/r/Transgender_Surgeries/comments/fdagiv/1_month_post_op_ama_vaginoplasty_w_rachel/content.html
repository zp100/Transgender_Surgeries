Saw the other recent post, figured I may as well see if I might be able to help any one else out by answering some questions.

There&#39;s still a fair amount of swelling, but I&#39;d say visually her results are fantastic.  My mother was my caretaker during recovery and she thinks it looks very natural - she&#39;s incredibly impressed.

Drastically.  Starting in the hospital I could barely move.  Changing beds was a serious challenge, but I&#39;m a stubborn bitch so I refused any help for it.  A couple days in you get encouraged to sit, which was incredibly painful for me.  After that they try to get you up and walking.  For me I could barely do that because of the nerve pain from the gas.
</p>
<p>
I think probably the most important thing to note is just how dramatically you improve each day.  From one day to the next you&#39;ll see incredible drops in swelling, significant increases in your ability to be self-sufficient, and dramatic improvements in your ability to be physical.  Taxi rides were definitely difficult though.
</p>
<p>
In particular, we purchased a cane (The Hurrycane - very nice, lightweight, folds up, has a tri-wing foot design which allows you to stand it up on it&#39;s own and also to swing it back up from the ground if it falls by using your foot.  Would highly recommend.) after I was out of that hospital and that helped dramatically.
</p>
<p>
So in the first couple weeks in NYC I went from being almost unable to walk, to being able to do almost a mile of blocks each day (worth noting that we did not do this everyday and that I was exhausted by the end of those walks).  I started out by just doing some laps in my hotel hallway before finally venturing outside.
</p>
<p>
The train ride was tough but manageable.  Sitting for such a long time at that point was definitely not the easiest.  Back home, I finally got a good taste of stairs and overall they were fairly manageable with my cane.
</p>
<p>
During my recovery I kept trying to push myself to be self-sufficient, and around the time that I got home I mostly was.  I could dilate by myself, take care if cleanup and restroom stuff, and get dressed (socks were still really difficult at that this point though).  As days passed I became more reliable.  I went right back to driving, relied on the cane less and less, and tried to keep walking regularly.
</p>
<p>
As far as pain goes, in the hospital I had a couple difficult nights.  In the hotel I had two really difficult nights.  Once back home I&#39;ve had one or two nights where pain kept me up a bit.  The swelling I still have is where most of the pain is really coming from.
</p>
<p>
For dilation, for my very first dilation in the hospital when I was learning we used the blue dilator (#2).  I got to about 7.5 inches and it wasn&#39;t very difficult at all.  Every dilation after I was on the green dilator (#3).  I&#39;ve had very little discharge from dilating, very little pain from dilating, and almost no blood.  I never had to dip down to blue at any point.  On the 26th of February I went up to the orange dilator (#4, the final one).  I could have gone up sooner according to my surgeon, but I wanted to wait until I was ready mentally.  Still little trouble, just mental focus, muscle and breathing control, and elbow grease.  I&#39;ve been on the orange dilator without dipping back down to green since and I&#39;ve maintained my depth of 7 to 7.5 inches depending on how tight I am.
</p>
<p>
That was really really long but I hope that helps a lot!

Not local.  Live in the Baltimore area.  Stayed in a hotel in the Times Square part of NYC after I left the hospital.  We booked the hotel a year in advance and it was still expensive.

Don&#39;t think there&#39;s actually a question in there, but I can wholeheartedly recommend Bluebond.  Just be advised NYC is expensive.

You use insurance for surgery and did you have to pay up front with them or did your insurance cover it and you just pay deductibles and get billed the rest? I havenâ€™t had individual insurance in long time n just want make sure I can afford it since Medicare wonâ€™t cover it.

So my insurance did cover it, but they put up a lot of about doing so.  They&#39;re still refusing to cover my electrolysis even though they&#39;re supposed to, so it&#39;s very frustrating.
</p>
<p>
There was an estimated up front cost that I had to pay.  The estimate ended up being smaller than the actual cost at the end of the whole thing.  Overall it was a couple thousand dollars out of pocket, not including room, supplies, travel, food, etc. which were a couple thousand more.

Is it worth the wait?  Iâ€™ve got less than 2 months until my date, and been waiting over a year now and itâ€™s really hard to just keep waiting.  I sometimes question whether Iâ€™m making the right choice in waiting so long to see her.
</p>
<p>
I just want to know if all the tears Iâ€™ve cried will be worth it.

If you&#39;ve only got two months left definitely just buckle down and hang in there.  I think for me it hasn&#39;t fully settled in yet that I really genuinely have a vagina now instead of the old genitalia, but I get little bursts every once in a while of really strong euphoria.  I think it&#39;ll improve drastically once my swelling goes down more and the area down there isn&#39;t as tender.  Definitely once I don&#39;t have to dilate 4 times a day - that regimen is a killer.
</p>
<p>
Overall I&#39;d say she&#39;s definitely worth the wait.

First coming out of surgery was...I dunno.  Kind of just a relief?  You&#39;re not immediately like 100% aware of your surroundings.  Both of my parents were there with me so at least had their company.  It&#39;s hard to quantify without describing my feelings before surgery.  Mostly it was being anxious, but particularly all my fears and doubts skyrocketed as I approached the OR.  As I got in the operating table they peaked and I started really crying.  I&#39;ve probably never been as scared in my life.  So like, relief in general, but also typical surgery relief of, &#34;Hey, I&#39;m not dead.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Physically, discomfort in general probably wasn&#39;t terrible.  There was a fair amount of gas pain (which would have been worse with a more traditional surgery technique).  I also had to wait a very long time for a room, so I spent most of the evening in recovery waiting for an actually room to open up.  In my feeling they&#39;re pretty stingy with pain meds.  They had me on a regular cycle of ibuprofen, tylenol, and oxy, which was fine for the most part, but there were definitely some times when I really would have appreciated something stronger.  That time spent waiting for a room was one of them.

Hard question.  Probably how easy dilation has been for me in general. It&#39;s been mostly painless and I&#39;m already up to the largest dilator.  That&#39;s not to say that it&#39;s easy.  It&#39;s tough, time consuming, and it really owns your life until you can finally go down to less dilations per day.  But I expected it to be
<em>
much
</em>
harder.  YMMV obviously.

Sorry if this is inappropriate, but do you smoke weed? I do pretty consistently and am curious if you stopped beforehand

I do not smoke weed, but it&#39;s worth noting that they will require you to stop for surgery as smoking can increase the risk of blood clots.

It&#39;s hard to really summarize.  It sucked, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it wasn&#39;t explicitly any one thing.  Hair regrowth sped up a bit which was very annoying.  I&#39;ve done laser but not electrolysis for my face (had to do electrolysis down there first).  Emotionally things just kind of reverted a bit.  Mood was generally just a bit lower across the board and it was harder to get back to cathartic emotional states like crying.  Physically I didn&#39;t notice any large slide backs or anything.  Post surgery but before I had gone back on my meds I had a couple moments of hot flashes where I ended up sticking my head in the freezer.
</p>
<p>
Overall it sucked, but it was doable.

I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m going to go with Dr. B-L for mine and I was wondering what your experience was with setting up your appointment with her were, especially for someone out of town. I haven&#39;t even started HRT yet (hopefully in the next few months) so I&#39;m still at least a year out but I want to try to do it next year if I can. How long before your surgery date did you initially contact her? What kind of meetings did you have before then? What was the timeline before the actual surgery? I&#39;ve seen some people say (at least it seems) that they have a consult with their surgeon and then very soon after they&#39;re in surgery.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

So to start with, I believe Bluebond-Langner has a waiting list of 2-3 years at this point (barring cancelations).  Scheduling stuff with her office wasn&#39;t difficult and for me, I had a consultation and surgery was then scheduled about a year out.  I also a pre-op informational appointment 4 months before surgery.
</p>
<p>
However, I had already been on hormones for some time, had already been in therapy for some time, and had already obtained my letters.  Bluebond&#39;s practice requires two letters, one from a mental health specialist and one from a medical specialist.  For me, I got letters from my therapist and my endo.  My insurance also required a third letter, so I saw a therapist that I had been in group with for the explicit purpose of writing a letter.  On top of that, most if not all of these letters have some specific requirements such as at least a year on hormones and/or at least a year presenting as your gender.
</p>
<p>
So to be frank, it&#39;s gonna take you more than a year.  That being said, I would recommend trying to schedule a consultation with Bluebond-Langner now, so that you are on the books.  Then, while you wait for the surgery to approach, you can knock out the rest of the requirements: hrt, therapy, letters, presentation, electrolysis, etc.  And unfortunately therapy and hair removal, hair removal in particular, are not cheap.
</p>
<p>
Once you have your surgery date I&#39;d also recommend booking whatever living situation you are going to have in NYC ahead of time.  It&#39;s still going to be expensive, but we booked a year out and saved a lot of money that way.  Also saved on costs because of where and how we booked (free wifi, free breakfast, regular free dinner events, kitchenet, free laundry, etc.).
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s daunting, but I wish you the best of luck.

Thanks for the info! For the consultations/appointments you had, I assume they were in-person so you had to travel there a few times before the actual surgery date?

Yeah they were in person.  Had to take the train up.  We went up the day before and spent the night in NYC because my appointments were in the morning.
