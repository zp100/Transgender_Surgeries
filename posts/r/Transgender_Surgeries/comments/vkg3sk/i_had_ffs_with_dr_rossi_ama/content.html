Wow! That&#39;s very cheap. I&#39;m considering Dr Rossi as my top choice for FFS. I&#39;m looking forward to you posting updates as you recover, if you choose to do so ofc :)

How has your stay in Argentina been so far? Did they provide the translator to stay with you at the hospital?

Yes they provide the translator. I edited my post to reflect that. It‚Äôs been great so far. I had one free day before surgery when I was able to explore Palermo. Love the tree lined streets and felt safe during the day grocery shopping.
</p>
<p>
But almost nobody speaks English or understands it either. So have an offline translator app on your phone.

That&#39;s really great. Honestly, tchange sounds like they&#39;re really good with patient care, and Rossi seems like a skilled surgeon, but I&#39;m so worried about spending the night in hospital in country where I don&#39;t speak the language. Thankfully they gave you a translator though. How has the app been working for you? I&#39;ve always wondered how well they actually work when trying to communicate with other people.

Thanks for writing about your experience. I have my FFS scheduled later this year with him :) Any other advice you can think of?

No worries! One thing I wasn‚Äôt expecting was how hideous I looked for the first few days. Even now, on the 3rd day, except my eyes have opened up.
</p>
<p>
So expect the first few days to look like a balloon face.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, buy as many yogurts, ice creams, soups you can before the surgery.
</p>
<p>
Make sure your Airbnb has good wifi and a nice TV because you need a way to pass time without going out at least for the first week.
</p>
<p>
Bring a bathrobe if you can for the first few days so easily cover yourself without bending to wear pants.

Yes, I don&#39;t expect to do much sighseeing there and I will bring my Nintendo Switch with me to kill the time ;) I guess good advice with the yoghurts, soups and so on. I am getting the same procedures like you and also rhino, trachea shave, some lipofilling and upper blepharoplasty. It will be fun.
</p>
<p>
Thanks and have a good recovery!

Hi! I have my FFS scheduled for the second week of December, pretty much the same as you except I will add a revision rhinoplasty.
<br>
I would like to ask you some questions, considering my upcoming experience.
<br>
-How manageable has the pain and discomfort been after the surgery?
<br>
-Have you been able to bathe?
<br>
-How difficult has it been to eat and manage within the stay? Can you cook, do you find it difficult to do so?
<br>
How was your check-in and check-out experience? Did Amanda pick you up at the airport?
<br>
-What items or tips would you recommend taking with you to make your stay more comfortable?
<br>
Thank you very much!
</p>

How was his bedside manner? And did they give you the good pain meds? The no after care facilities might make me go with Cardenas!

He‚Äôs ok and comes across as very confident in what he does. I had questions right before the surgery and he was happy to answer them.
</p>
<p>
I only briefly heard him again when I was waking up from the surgery saying how well it went.  I‚Äôll be seeing him again next week for a follow up and staple removal.
</p>
<p>
As for the meds, they gave me antibiotics, anti-nausea and pain killers (it‚Äôs called Flexiplen B12 not oxy). It‚Äôs actually helped me with lower face pain.
</p>
<p>
If it‚Äôs really bad pain, Amanda can help with stronger meds.

Hey! So the surgeon is in Buenos Aires, Argentina. They suggest staying at least 2 weeks post-op.
