I have a consultation with Dr. Mundinger at the Crane Center in Austin, TX for FFS this September and was wondering if anyone had experience with him? It looks like he worked out of New Orleans, LA before going to the Crane Center. I unfortunately can‚Äôt find much of his work online which is a bit unsettling.
</p>
<p>
His bio online states, ‚ÄúDuring his time in academic practice, he sought additional training in Facial Femnization Surgery with FacialTeam in Marbella, Spain.‚Äù So he must be good, right?
</p>
<p>
I freaked out last night and booked consultations with Justine Lee, Jeffrey Spiegel, Harrison Lee, Toby Mayer, and Bryan Rolfes. I‚Äôm just looking for someone to take insurance or at least help with claims and I know a lot of these don‚Äôt offer that.

I personally would not recommend Dr. Mundinger. I had a horrible experience with him in a consult regarding BA and decided to look else where. It was also at that very consult that he took a look at my face and gave some recommendations I didn‚Äôt agree with. He showed me some more photos of his work in his office and his FFS work is very inconsistent as well as his stitch work is not so great. I think the main problem I see with him is that he lacks aesthetic eye for really harmonizing the face, which is very important to me. Also, he was just not a very pleasant person to work with, extremely blunt and didn‚Äôt get the feeling that he really cared about my concerns.
</p>
<p>
You want to choose someone who does more FFS procedures than anything. Bryan Rolfes and Justine Lee (both take insurance) are amazing and would highly recommend as they mostly do FFS and have a great eye for aesthetics and their aftercare is way better than what you would get at Crane Center (at least in the Austin Location).
</p>
<p>
Also, the ‚ÄúFacialTeam training‚Äù is more of a ‚ÄúI spent the weekend at Marbella doing some shadowing of the FacialTeam surgeons‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt really mean much so take that with a grain of salt. I know cause I consulted Dr. Satterwhite who went through the same program as Mundinger.

Thank you so much this is a lot of insight! I‚Äôve heard he‚Äôs kind of blunt and an ass but that doesn‚Äôt really bother me. The only upside to using them is that they‚Äôre close to home. I‚Äôm only a few hours from Austin. My face gives me so much dysphoria though and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do if I had shotty work and fixated on that. Hopefully I‚Äôll hear from Dr. Justine Lee and Rolfes soon before I lose my mind and just choose someone.

Hello, Lilia here, Facialteam&#39;s community manager.
</p>
<p>
I can confirm that Facialteam
<strong>
Training Workshops
</strong>
are normally 1-day seminars based around expert speakers on FFS techniques and theory.
<strong>
Observerships
</strong>
consist of observing surgeries in the OR for a limited time, normally 1-2 days.
</p>
<p>
The third and most intensive type of professional development offered by Facialteam is the
<strong>
FFS Training Program
</strong>
, a week-long event which includes the above as well as a 1-day cadaver lab for practice sessions.
</p>
<p>
In all cases, the trainings indeed have value as continuing education, but due to limited time are not comprehensive, so cannot replace years of experience.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps!

His surgical results are horrible! He‚Äôs been apparently accused of switching with his surgical fellow to do all of the surgery instead of him behind the patients back or without consent. Also, his attitude is not so great!
</p>
<p>
He‚Äôs apparently become the ‚ÄúKathy Rumer‚Äù of FFS to a certain extent.

Sorry to hear about the wait. I had to wait about 7 months. I had a good experience at least. I was concerned with some of the healing after a month but it looks much better now. I can&#39;t even tell I had surgery anymore barely at all.

Sure, just give me a day or two to upload my pictures somewhere to show. Admittedly, I&#39;ve never actually posted pictures on Reddit before so I&#39;m not really sure yet how to go about that.

So at least for me I cannot post pictures on comments to threads, which is unfortunate. However, it does appear that I can post pictures in new threads so I will plan to eventually post about my FFS with Dr. Mundinger in the near future in a separate thread

I heard from Rolfes office today but they won‚Äôt even book me for a consultation until I‚Äôve been on HRT for a year. I was trying to be proactive and book my consultation now since I know it takes forever to even get one with them and I‚Äôd rather get it done sooner than later.

That doesn&#39;t seem right. I booked a consult with them before a year (10 months), I just told them I wouldn&#39;t be getting surgery until after I hit a year and they seemed fine with that

‚ÄúHi Kristen,
</p>
<p>
So Dr. Rolfes will want you to wait and consult with him once you have been on hormones for at least 12 months or more.
</p>
<p>
A lot of insurance policies will require that as well and Dr. Rolfes does not operate on any patient until they have been on those hormones for at least a year.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
I was thinking the same thing like he isn‚Äôt cutting on me but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
