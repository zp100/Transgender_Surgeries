So I‚Äôve made my mind up about which surgeon I want to go ahead with and I‚Äôm definitely going with Dr Banks for my SRS, my reasoning is that I‚Äôve never seen results as consistent as his and I love his aesthetics and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be satisfied with the depth given by him.
</p>
<p>
I was wondering though, after I get my surgery done with Dr banks can I get ppt after without changing the outside aesthetics of my future vagina?
</p>
<p>
What if in the future I‚Äôd want that extra lubrication or depth from the PPT technique, would I be able to mix suporns technique with PPT without changing any of the outside appearance, just changing the material inside, or would it not be worth it?
</p>
<p>
Would the suporn technique be satisfactory enough?
</p>
<p>
Is there any suporn girlies who can speak about their experiences with Dr banks? satisfaction rate, anything they would change?
</p>
<p>
Now after you had surgery with banks do you ever think about PPT or regret not getting PPT?
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôd appreciate any information/input given by anyone whether you‚Äôre pre-op or post-op, and I would definitely love if any of the suporn girlies can give me more insight about their experiences and hopefully answer some of my questions above.
</p>
<p>
I hope you‚Äôre all having a great day :)

I think it is not worth it at all. This is why:
</p>
<p>
First of all, the lubrication from PPT is not dependent on arousal, it is a constant thing.
</p>
<p>
I got the tunica vaginalis in my dr. Bank vagina. It is a membrane with similar properties as PPT. I also got 10% of my vaginal lining as mucosal urethral skin in the deepest part.
</p>
<p>
Because of this my vagina is always moist inside, and it is even self cleaning at this point. At the same time I don&#39;t have discharge anymore and nothing leaks out. It is just how I like it. This may depend on the person though, I just know my experience.
</p>
<p>
Aside from tunica and urethral skin in the deepest part of the vagina, the skin inside is inverted scrotal skin. It looks is pink, is very durable and it is good enough.
</p>
<p>
I got 16.5cm depth with little material. And that&#39;s perfect. Most people who go there achieve similar depth or more. Dr. Banks method is more limited by the available space within the person, than what material is available. They are very good at getting nice depth.
</p>
<p>
There is a LOOOOT of dilation accosiated with SRS, especially dr. Banks method. Recovery in general is really tough and takes a long time.
</p>
<p>
So if I list pros and cons it would be this:
</p>
<p>
Pro&#39;s: ‚Ä¢ there is a slight chance you might increase some depth  ‚Ä¢ if your vagina gets superdry because bad luck, ppt might increase it a bit
</p>
<p>
Cons: ‚Ä¢ Expensive and extremely time consuming ‚Ä¢ Dilation and recovery all over again (horrible) ‚Ä¢ Risks accociated with all surgeries ‚Ä¢ Might risk function and aesthetics ‚Ä¢ Dr. Bank won&#39;t do revisions on you and your warranty dissapears ‚Ä¢ PPT may lead to overlubrication ‚Ä¢ PPT is a very invasive surgery and you&#39;ll get big scars on multiple places over the body
</p>
<p>
The way I see it, it is not worth it at all. You risk so much and go through so much effort for a slight chance to improve stuff. PPT revision would be more of a last resort if something goes wrong or you fail dilations resulting in total loss of depth, not something that will improve your vagina. Recovery from SRS is no joke and it is not something you wanna do twice. If you are fully sold on PPT you should aim to get that directly.

OMG YOU, I CANT BELIEVE YOU COMMENTED, YOU ARE THE REASON I CHOSE DR BANKS, AFTER SEEING YOUR RESULTS I WAS LIKE YUP 100% GOING WITH BANKS, thank you so much for your input now that you‚Äôve said this I think you knocked a lot of sense into me.
</p>
<p>

Ohh haha hello!
</p>
<p>
I am super satisfied with my results. The biggest issue is my very visible raphe line that I plan to get removed in revision. It can not be removed in first stage because of dilation issues.
</p>
<p>
I also have a little hair in the entrance. (NOT INSIDE). It is purely a cosmetic thing but electrolycis there would be nice.
</p>
<p>
Theese are minor issues though and I&#39;m superhappy. And if I can never get revision I&#39;ll still be superhappy. I&#39;d say I am 100% satisfied. The care and support I recieved was top notch. And I still am able to email them whenever I have an issue or concern.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had sex yet because I still feel too fragile, but I&#39;m gonna try in a few months. I have explored on my own though and I have so much sensation it is crazy. I can also get a little wet. (They keep the cowpers gland that produces precum, so you can self lube a little bit).
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best of luck with your journey!

No I mean the one you are born with. It is still partly there in the entrance, and in my case, also the lip.

I still have my raffe and I love it because it&#39;s part of the mark where my original vagina would have been if things had gone that way from the beginning. It&#39;s also become a pleasurably sensitive feature for me over time, but I get why some people might not want it. good luck in your revision!

It‚Äôs funny you brought this up, when I consulted RBL and Jun, I asked this for kicks as I was curious for my friends that have already done Vaginoplasty, they were both okay with adding ppt depth to an already created vagina. They said it‚Äôs harder to do it with vaginal stenosis because they would have to dissect all the scar tissue and take skin grafts to create the canal along with adding ppt. But that could have changed as I had my consult a while ago. Also, Bank/Suporn use the tunica vaginalis and do different techniques to the standard PI so that‚Äôs something you would have to think about too.

considering the fact that you can get vaginoplasty while keeping your natal anatomy, you could probably get the added depth and lubrication without changing the outside too much.

might have some more people to ask (:

I think they meant that if they you can do the vagina bit whilst keeping your original anatomy they can probably do the vagina bit whilst keeping a vulva.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s necessarily that simple as the original vaginoplasty might make things more difficult.

Could you not just schedule a PPT pull through to have your vaginal canal created the way you want it from the beginning and then labiaplasty with Dr banks separately or vice-versa order? Healing from the primary canal creation is a big part of the pain/recovery, why do that individual part twice, when you could just do it once?
