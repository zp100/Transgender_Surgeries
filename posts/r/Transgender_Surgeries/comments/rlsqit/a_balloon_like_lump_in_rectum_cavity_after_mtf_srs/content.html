Do you feel stool is getting trapped behind that lump of anterior rectal wall? I can evacuate sometimes 3 times a day, like before but now it&#39;s a discharge of fluid (intestinal transparent type of fluid) but it shouldn&#39;t be producing it. I eat 90 grs of oats daily and helps great with constipation. This feels different now, more fluid than when you&#39;re having anal sex with lube and all that.
</p>
<p>
Almost 7 weeks post-op but I felt this since went to bathroom Day 5... And constipation made me go insert a finger to see if that was too dry, or not. It was, but there was a prominence protruding into the wall, felt like a ball. &#34;TF is this?&#34; Surgeon never answered what it was and went crazy when asked about it. Assistant said thiat it&#39;s&#34;vaginal cavity&#34;, then &#34;it&#39;s internal edema, hematoma, subsides in 2-3 months, no worries&#34;... Both were hideous. Never had I ve been warned about this, never heard it mentioned online.
</p>
<p>
Is really the vaginal lining? Should it change the normal anatomy of the rectal cavity? Is edema? Is expected? Is wrong?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s like 3 cms near the sphincter. Before surgery there was nothing like that. 2 months after it&#39;s the same prominence, nothing changed.
</p>
<p>
Could it be prostate being inflamed? back home, some person told me that i would never be able to have anal sex anymore due to the &#34;surgery i had&#39;... i DIDN&#39;T asked her for that... She came with it as &#34;don&#39;t be afraid oK? but you should know this, ok?&#34; And many other sex related unwanted things like that, so invasive and disrespectful as i wasn&#39;t talking about sex, just complications from surgery. She assumed i came from the club. But that initial statement was weirf, felt intimidating and she was like wanting to scare me for.... Reasons? Morbosity surely. Crazy people.
</p>
<p>
Thanks...

So the assistants answer flopping around from vaginal cavity, internal edema, hematoma.  Actually isn&#39;t as poor of an answer as it seams
<em>
initially
</em>
.  Edema swelling and hematoma type bruising are all normal after major surgery.
</p>
<p>
The lump you describe is not expected, but is likely a byproduct of your surgery.  The surgeon is obviously hoping the body will naturally correct the swelling and the issue will go away.  Being two months in with no change is concerning though.
</p>
<p>
The issue is both an internal edema or hematoma should have reduced in size by the two month mark.  Now it could be your vaginal canal scar tissue pushing inward against your anal cavity.  This obviously is not ideal or what you want to happen.  But it is possibility.  Scar tissue swelling after major surgery can take a long time to recover (6-18 months).  So there is some chance the lump will reduce in size.  Otherwise you may be looking at excess scar tissue from your surgery.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully others will chip in if they ended up with any anal lumps post surgery and if theirs recovered naturally or not

Katlyn, excellent observation and advice.  I&#39;m grateful for women like you, I&#39;ll keep posting on this issue. Yes I&#39;m concerned because he the assistant, mentioned also &#34;internal edema that, if drained with punction, will bring major deep problems&#34;, but then tokd &#34;it&#39;s just the vaginal canal&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in touch with the surgeon. He starts private smear campaign about my &#34;mental health&#34; everytime I ask questions like this ball/lump. Ty so much.

Hugs sorry you&#39;re having this frustration.  Hopefully you can get it figured out with your surgeon.  If not you may want to talk with your primary physician and get forward to someone for a second opinion.

That explains why I was suffering hell from the (stuck) catheter NOT COLLECTING ANYTHING more than 100cc in one whole day, ending in URGENCY ROOM, being gaslighted by this surgeon and his team claiming i was &#34;hallucinating you have a ball in the anus, so send me pictures of it please to corroborate, then we talk (shut down the phone call&#34;
</p>
<p>
Next call couple of hours later was him &#34;OK YOU DIDN&#39;T SENT ME A SINGLE ONE PHOTO OF THAT CRAZY IDEA that YO HAVE SOMETHING IN YOUR ANUS, you need a psychologist to evaluate your mental state that obviously is DELUSIONAL and not coherent with reality&#34;.
</p>
<p>
And many devaluating invalidating depreciative and malicious hateful words in a truly, recognizable narcissistic rage. He sounded like a true psycho, really intimidating and aggressive disrespectful.
</p>
<p>
They blamed for my supposed fucked up mental state because they didn&#39;t wanted to take accountability of their bad praxis and negligence in the surgery.
</p>
<p>
This also explains why he sent a psychiatrist the day 3 to persuade me to take Haldoperidol, for &#34;treating&#34; the hallucination of a IMAGINARY SHOULDER PAIN CAUSED BY MY FEARS OF WHAT THEY DID TO MY BODY FOR REAL..
</p>
<p>
He literally took me as if I were a confused men that went to have SRS as a fetishistic sex drive, and when it happened I entered in psychotic shock and break because my decision was wrong when clashing with reality.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, as if I didn&#39;t passed through tons if evaluations last 2 decades to not know I&#39;m real female not a &#34;shocked confused male by his sexual porn desires to become a slut that get aroused when having a via for himself: the eternal woman, embodied in me&#34;. These sickfucks took transexual people as irreversible mental freaks and punish us when they do something wrong, and to get out of the problem, blame your supposed mental illness (transsexualism) and then go suicide if you want, you&#39;re a sex masochist that wants to be sexually and quirurgically punished (by them). So they think you DESERVE IT.
</p>
<p>
They, all the staff blamed the deep pain in my shoulder to my fears provoking it. So this way they were out of the equation: it was all a result of my mental illness. They did &#39;nothing wrong&#39; with me.
</p>
<p>
A nurse here told me she had almost same hellish experience with a local team. Pain in shoulder. Because they grab from your arns and THROW YOU TO THE OTHER BED, pulling from your relaxed arns, not using a blanket to take you safely caring your cervical nerves and joints. She asked for help and they took her for a shitbat crazy and put her down with strong psychotropics. Same bad outcome, same strategy to save their asses for the damage they did.

I know what it&#39;s like not being believed when you are in pain. I had serious nerve pain in my bum and thighs and they wouldn&#39;t listen to me. Took a week after surgery to get hold of my doctor who prescribed the correct pain meds. It was an absolute nightmare !

Yeah because the do this rationale &#34;with morphine, tramadol, antibiotics and paracetamol this pain must be a psychotic break. Prepare Haldol and don&#39;t bother.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Then the surgeon itself called a effing psychiatrist and sent to MY HOTEL to bother me insisting i was in  &#34;hallucinations&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Due to, maybe the real complications that affected my rectum, shoulder and bladder? That psycho really got obsessive with me.
</p>
<p>
Time will tell whole I roll off all the story.
</p>
<p>
Hugs to you!

You have both external and internal hemorrhoids.  Not saying that&#39;s what&#39;s going on, but yeah there&#39;s a second set a few inches in that can also become enlarged.

Yes it could be internal thrombosed hemorrhoids. But that causes urinary infection? Bladder disfunction? Retention and/or incontinence? And prostatitis?  I need a rectal tact and some studies here. Thank you for your feedback!

At 7 weeks post op anything can be possible. I had issues with digestive system for a long time after the surgery. Partially it’s due to those antibiotics and medication that they give you. I think you can ask your doctor, but most possible it’s just a swelling, that would usually resolve naturally.

I was on antibiotics 15 days and it&#39;s side effects remited day 18 or so. I&#39;m not on painkillers since then, also.
</p>
<p>
A swelling mist reduce its volume in 2 months and this is  exactly the same as when i touched first time day 3 sheet surgery.... Feels the same, obstructs the same... Produce rectal fluid/lubrication in excess or lack of it. Nothing changed. The deny there&#39;s something, but &#34;it&#39;s in your mind, you go to Psychiatry to fix that&#34;
