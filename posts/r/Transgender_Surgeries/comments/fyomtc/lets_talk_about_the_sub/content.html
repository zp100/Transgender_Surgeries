Thank you for how you manage this sub and for the extraordinary efforts you put into organizing information in ways that are helpful and informative. The information found here has helped me to chart my path with every reason to confidently expect a positive outcome.
</p>
<p>
I sense you watch over this sub intently, which is very much appreciated and IMO creates an atmosphere to freely share information. You freely share tips on how to bring information together to tell/share one’s experiences for the benefit of others. Which leads me to ask, is managing this sub your job? Because you always seem to be reachable. If this is your paid job, IMO they ain’t paying you enough. If this is not your paying job, then what you do here to support us in the transgender community marks you as a super special person! Thank you for all you do❣️

You have good senses. I don&#39;t always have the time, but I usually check all posts and comments fairly regularly through out the day. There&#39;s also the mod queue which is where all the user reported items end up, and that&#39;s really helpful.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve tried to define and enforce a set of rules to make this a good place for us all. As you say

<p>
No, I just spend too much time on reddit. I should get a life, but in the meantime here I am. I&#39;m way past the point where I get much out of whats posted on reddit, but I&#39;ve also found I really like helping people. Must be the estrogen because I never used to, and I think I&#39;m making up for lost time.

I agree, but I don&#39;t know what I can or should do about it. There&#39;s already some established ftm surgery subs on reddit so I assume people are posting there in preference. I&#39;m fine with that, its not a competition, as long as people are helped I don&#39;t care who does it.

<p>
Before I joined this sub it was already getting popular for mtf surgeries and there was only one other similar sub (
<a href="/r/Transurgery">r/Transurgery
</a>
). As I&#39;m mtf I built the wiki as an mtf resource and I think that helped make the sub even more popular for mtf. I don&#39;t have the time/energy/interest to make an ftm wiki, and no one else seems to be interested, so I guess things will stay as they are.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any issue with the moderators being mtf. Most of what you do as a mod is enforcing the subs rules.

It’s an interesting conundrum: FTM-specific subs form because of lack of resources here, but then there’s even fewer here because of that migration. It’s cyclical.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think this sub should be for both. I think when discussing genital expectations, it’s useful to have lots of perspectives - for example, I’ve seen quite a few trans women here panicking about vaginoplasty results when they’re well within the range of AFAB vulvas, and I and other trans men have been able to provide comfort by talking about how our natal parts look similar.
</p>
<p>
It’s also a bit alienating when subs that just have “trans” or “transgender” in the title are MTF-specific... it implicitly feels like FTM and transmasc people aren’t really trans, or are just a variation.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t to say you should devote your limited time and energy to stuff you’re not interested in or don’t know about. I’m actually super grateful for all the work you put in! I just think a transmasc mod or more communication with the transmasc surgery subs could benefit everyone.

<p>
It is for both, its just that there&#39;s not many FTM posts here.
</p>

<p>
I don&#39;t know why that happens, but it seems to be quite common that subs are intended to be equally for both, the mtf voices overwhelm ftm. Given how pervasive it is I&#39;m not sure that I have much hope of doing anything about it.
</p>
<p>
If there was a FTM wiki here like the MTF one that would bring people over from the other subs, but at the same time it would severely damage them. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good thing to do, and I doubt anyone else is prepared to put the effort in to create and maintain it. I seem to be a bit odd. You don&#39;t need to be a moderator to do that either.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know that having a transmasc  mod would really make much difference. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything I do as a moderator that&#39;s gender based. My moderator duties are mainly just setting rules, enforcing them, and things like content in the sidebar. The stuff I do that&#39;s MTF related is things anyone can do if they have an interest. I moderate another sub as well, and its the same, only I post much less there.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps its the &#34;reward&#34; of being a moderator that would encourage someone to be more active in the sub to the point where they change its nature? All I can say is that moderation kind of sucks and I think of it a duty more than anything.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m all for it if some transmasc person wants to contribute more here.

Ah, for some reason I was under the impression you had to be a mod to add to the wiki.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d love to contribute, but I&#39;m far away from having bottom surgery, and I&#39;m Canadian - this complicates matters because GRS Montreal is the only place that does phalloplasty here. I really know nothing about American surgeons with regards to phallo. Hell, I barely know about Brassard - photos of his vaginoplasties are scarce enough, and I haven&#39;t seen a single Brassard phallo pic anywhere.
</p>
<p>
I know a bit about various surgical options for transmasc bottom surgery (I&#39;m already off of the norm of regular RFF phallo because I want phallo without vaginectomy and no UL), but when it comes to the doctors themselves, I really don&#39;t know.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m definitely not trying to blame you for the &#34;trans = transfem&#34; thing. I see it everywhere... Reddit, Twitter, etc. It&#39;s just something I&#39;m frustrated about in general. You&#39;re doing the best you can, and I really appreciate it!

Wiki&#39;s can be setup various different ways. I&#39;ve set it so only mods can edit it, but I can give access to specified people. Or even just open it up to anyone, but that would I&#39;m sure be a really bad idea.
</p>
<p>
Its not worth bothering with this unless you&#39;re really dedicated. I read and research a lot so early on it was just a documenting the stuff I go though anyway.
</p>
<p>
Mainly what I&#39;ve done is avoid expressing my opinions on things and just collecting what other have said and organizing it. Over time it just piles up and I sometimes reorganize it.
</p>
<p>
Have you been through transbucket? The search doesn&#39;t seem to work so I just went through all of it.

I&#39;ve always thought it was a little weird that there is no dedicated section in the Wiki for Tracheal shaves.
</p>
<p>
And very few posts with results in that regard, which Is probably why it hasn&#39;t? It&#39;s been difficult to find information on who would be good to go to.
</p>
<p>
Btw, thanks for everything ya&#39;ll do on here. This sub has really helped me with SRS!

I didn’t separate out tracheal shaves as it’s but one of many components of FFS. If I split that out I’d have to split out everything else, and that’s too much work. I don’t think it’s often done independently? Also, I don’t think it occurred to me.

I get what you mean there, though I guess I&#39;ve always considered it separate from FFS personally. FFS has always stuck out to me a set of procedures that are used like an artist constructing a face, but with flesh. (Sounds metal now that I think about it)
</p>
<p>
With tracheal shave though, I just set of skills specialized in a different direction. It&#39;s a pretty sensitive area that has some pretty severe consequences if it gets botched. It being hard to know who has a lot of experience with doing it specifically is a little annoying is all.
</p>
<p>
I guess in the end, the best FFS surgeons will most likely be the most experienced with tracheal shaves. I&#39;m planning to do it alone, as the expense for a full FFS is unlikely anytime soon, but I may as well do the full consult while I&#39;m at it.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for the response. :)
</p>
<p>
edit: Oh now that I think about it, last time I looked at the wiki I noticed a lot of SRS results post had their picture deleted/removed. I&#39;m not sure if you leave those up for the comments on the posts itself (probably worth doing) or if its gone unnoticed but just a heads up. It&#39;s a bit of a shame really, I remember some of those posts helping me decide on my SRS surgeon.

I know there&#39;s posts with the photos removed, and sometimes the post as well, but I don&#39;t have the time and energy to go through it all and do anything about it. To make it harder sometimes the posts are still useful even without the picture and I&#39;d have to evaluate them individually, and its often possible to read deleted posts if you know how.
</p>
<p>
I agree its a shame, but there&#39;s not much to be done about it. I don&#39;t think it would be ethical to archive them. We can only hope that over time more people who&#39;ve been helped want to pass it forward. I think I&#39;ve seen that, with more and more people posting their experiences on reddit, and this sub has probably played it part in that.

I agree with regarding Tracheal Shave as a separate part of FFS because my insurance does not provide coverage and as everyone knows, these procedures aren’t cheap. Getting this procedure is another huge part of my dysphoria.

There&#39;s no search in reddit wiki&#39;s apart from just searching the text of the page, but that won&#39;t help because I&#39;ve not separated out tracheal shaves though. You&#39;ll have to look through everything the hard way. Or search reddit, etc with google.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately there&#39;s a limit to who much time I can spend on this and how much energy I have, and I&#39;m already well past it.

<p>
The search on reddit can be difficult, using google with a few extras may show better results.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to include the sub or the wiki in the search keywords, either Transgender_Surgeries or TransSurgeriesWiki. It may be necessary to try out a few keywords.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example for the trach shave :
<a href="https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=TransSurgeriesWiki+shave+site:www.reddit.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=TransSurgeriesWiki+shave+site:www.reddit.com
