everything went well. But there are things which bother me: 1.i used to have a very bad smell before  and had to clean it every day.my partner used to remind me that and made me feel embarrassed.They said ppv is a self-cleaning thing and it was for the first forth months - no smell at all!however, from 4th month it started to have a horrible odour even worse maybe - but no infection or complications.2. They say dialation is easier with ppv. No. For me it&#39;s very,very tight. If with ppv i could use the biggest dialator directly, now i always should use a smaller one then a bigger one.and when i take it out - is very painful.i tried a some sex with different partners who has not a big dick. It always gets somehow easier to the place where it stiches with peritoneal flap. And then need to work it for a while to get deeper(same with dialator).i didn&#39;t have such issues with ppv. 3.when i get hard there is something in my right labia majora gets big and hard.and it&#39;s touchable and pushes my labia minora but not a vaginal entrance.4. clitoris orgasm is same but vaginal orgasm is worse. Its very short and fast instead of i had before (longer and brighter.maybe because of some prostate replacement etc. 5.pee stream went worse after 3.5 months. It doesn&#39;t pee down it pees upper like 55-65 degrees. (i did revision on my urethra). It was much better in the beginning. The doctor says it&#39;s still a recovery process and need to wait. 6.depth is stable but every dialation is very difficult to achieve it to the fullest and there is always some blood a little on dialators.(5.5inches).I don&#39;t regret because i wanted a robotic ppv but if i had a good authstetics before i would leave my piv. Its my personal experience.
