What the options for brassard girls in terms of revisions? Like does Montreal do aesthetic revisions? Or outside clinics?

Girl lazy has nothing to do with it.  Lol I just had my 4 month checkup today and I asked Doc to take a picture for me of a small area that has been irritated lately so he did and when he showed me all I could concentrate on looking at was a small jungle patch of wild hair between my holy-O and coochie.
</p>
<p>
About the only place I don&#39;t want any at all and I don&#39;t dare risk a blade there yet. Lol
</p>
<p>
As far as our coochies we are all different,  some are similar and some are dramatically but there are just like cis coochies and I&#39;ll step up and go one further and say I honestly believe we are better.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 56yo and have been with a lot of women in my day and I know when I felt inside of mine I new it was unique.
</p>
<p>
Now my days with women has long been over and I started having sex finally after my 90days, day 99 to be exact but who&#39;s counting 🙃.
</p>
<p>
Anyway my guy that took my virginity I&#39;ve known for a long lot of years and he told me what I suspected,  and that it felt like pussy but a little different but in a good way and that I was pleasantly tight. 😆 🤣
</p>
<p>
Needless to say he still can&#39;t break into the 2 min time zone with me. Lol  That&#39;s went up considerably from the excitement of 30sec I was getting from him.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s trying to blame it on my water bed and the fact that the women He&#39;s been with lately are pretty wore out. Lol 😂
</p>
<p>
Nothing like that tight new virgin pu-tang for a 42yo guy. 😆
</p>
<p>
All honestly he said it feels amazing.  I told him I would kick his ass if he was laying to me. 😆
</p>
<p>
Hug&#39;s Emily 🤗
