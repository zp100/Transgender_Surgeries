Yes, you can re-stretch. Just start small and work your way up. Fifteen minutes at a time, couple of times a day.

I&#39;m not sure if the vagina is same, but here&#39;s a stretching story that MIGHT help...
</p>
<p>
I used to have two inch wide tunnels in my ear. It took YEARS to stretch them. Then I let them close up... Then I decided to stretch then again;
</p>
<p>
From 1mm, to 23mm... It took a month.
</p>
<p>
If the hoo-ha is the same, you should be good. Just use this as an excuse to... Have fun.

Yup. In the ear. So, not only is it skin (link in the tunnel-of-love, I assume?) but it also has cartilage to contend with.
</p>
<p>
The human body can adapt. I have see enough to know that, with regular &#34;exercise&#34; you can get to where you want to be.
</p>
<p>
remember the old saying, &#34;you only get out, what you put in&#34;, So keep putting them in... if you know what I mean ;)

I’m sorry you were a victim, I heard about her status after the fact or I wouldn’t have gone to her. I have surgery in 2018. I like my outcome for the most part, but I do have discharge (granulation tissue) and pee at an angle since surgery, both of which I need fixed, but my mom had a seizure so I put my health on hold to take care of her. I had surgery a year after you. Was Dr. RBL able to help, did she take your insurance I have a UPMC one it isn’t listed on the insurances she takes. Was she nice?
</p>
<p>
Thanks

YES, I do this every time and have sometimes been incontinent of the bladder. The discharge is everyday too I’m the panty liner queen but a OBGYN said my tissue looked pink, so I’m not sure why I’m still having the discharge.

I have an I also found Hannah Simpson’s website, she is doing the right thing. I used to really look up to Dr. Rumer being a premed myself. I thought my complications were normal, but just not talked about because others were embarrassed. Is there like a group chat for us or something, or is this Reddit it. I’d really like to get to know more of us, because she has made what was supposed to be a fix into more of an issue.

I am

Hannah Simpson. I am really hoping you mean that you are upset with and used to look up to Rumer, just as I am and once did.
</p>
<p>
Note that your comment reads like you are upset with
<em>
me
</em>
for talking about it publicly, which is triggering to me. I hope you will edit the two sentences to clarify for others.

Hi, sorry, I read this back and it does sound that way. That was a typo. I think you sharing your story while triggering in itself is helping others and I really appreciate you. I cant believe she is still practicing. Sorry for the miscommunication! I hope there is no hard feelings, I’d like to get to know all of you better. It has really helped this past day, I felt so alone.

My fairly reputable surgeon in 1997 did one revision on my Urethra angle (I had to lean far forward too) in stage 2 Labiaplasty and once again after that and took out more erectile tissue from my vagina each time too (all free office procedures).
</p>
<p>
I have done a consult for another Urethral Angle revision  as it has been at about 45° for 20+ years after that 2nd revision and was surprised to find out there was also still a little more erectile tissue left that I was not feeling with sex or dilation all these years.
</p>
<p>
12 more months to go - if it stays the original date.

You might be able to get an inch back if you dilate a lot. But even then, you’d be at only 2 or 3 inches which obviously is not enough for penetrative sex. Sorry for the bad news but there’s a reason why it’s always heavily emphasized just how important dilating is. The good news is that you can get start over and get depth with peritoneal vaginoplasty or colon vaginoplasty.

Thanks, I knew I couldn’t get back a lot, but didn’t know how much, I know dilating is emphasized, I just suck at time management and it hurts (that’s the point) and that’s why I feel so guilty, now I have to go through another surgery with more risk factors, just kicking myself that This even happened.
</p>
<p>
Thanks.

I had to get a colon vaginoplasty as a secondary revision, not because I didn’t dilate, but due to other complications. It was pretty tough going through another surgery down there, but I got through it, recovered well, and am very happy. You can get through it too.

My girlfriend is very bad at dilating. Like I will get her dilators out and put them in her reach before work and I’ll come home and she will have put them away and said she wasn’t feeling it that day. Sometimes she will do this for a couple months even. Every time she starts dilating again it’s very painful in the beginning (which is why she’s so adverse to the idea of doing it) but within a couple weeks she is able to get back to her biggest dilator again. I know it’s different then having a couple years without dilating, but I think the same concept applies!

I feel her, dilating is a bitch. Yeah, I tried it today and it was very painful, hopefully I can get some depth back and it will be easier. I have perimerin cream to help soften my vagina.

Yeah, I was prescribed it first by Dr. Rumer and then by my gynecologist. She would just have to schedule and appointment and get the prescription. I would say it definitely helps make dilating less painful because it softens the vaginal wall

Rumer is not a doctor. She just plays one on TV. Get a second opinion from a real surgeon.

I also had Dr. Rumer for a vaginoplasty in August of 2021 (not quite a year yet). Despite all the problems other people seem to have had, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had any. Not that I&#39;d complain about at least. That aside, I also did the big no-no and didn&#39;t dilate for about two weeks. I lost a significant amount of depth from this - I went from hitting three dots to almost hitting the first one after 15 mins of dilation.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea about revision surgeries but I wanted to let you know that I am in a similar boat. How was your experience with Dr. Rumer? Maybe she has changed since you had yours done.

I just read your post about the complications you were experiencing. I still bleed when I dilate, however after I began healing and was dilating consistently every day, the bleeding was becoming less frequent. It wasn&#39;t until after I failed to dilate for two weeks that I began bleeding more. I think consistent dilation helps keep away granulation tissue, etc. inside your vagina. I didn&#39;t have any issues with insurance, nor were my medical records mixed up. I&#39;m not invalidating your experience, just wanted to mention that I&#39;ve had nothing but great results so far, and the small issues I&#39;ve had I blame on myself for not following the proper post-operative care regimen. She and her team (the entire staff at Delaware County Memorial, for that matter) were extremely nice to me as well.
</p>
<p>
I know Rumer has a bad rep in the community, but I don&#39;t blame her for everything. I&#39;m glad you were able to get care somewhere else to fix your issues though, and that you&#39;re healthy now!

The &#34;Vaginal Redeepening&#34; surgery is something you may be able to have. I don&#39;t know all the particulars but I think some of it addresses the strictures and places where the sides of the canal have healed together.
</p>
<p>
It may also require partially re-dividing the pelvic muscle that was split to provide the vaginal canal enough space for dilation and for penetrative sex. This sounds likely to be your primary problem considering the depth you mention.
</p>
<p>
A Gynecology or Urologist visit may be able to diagnose the nature of the problem. Finding someone that does GCS is better, but either specialist with familiarity may be able to determine whether it is possible to use very small expanders / dilators and how much depth may remain beyond. Unless of course the opening has closed and healed rather than merely narrowed to smaller than your standard #1 dilator.

If I don&#39;t properly understand the precise nature of your problem though please clarify for everyone.

Does the surgery have a name, if you can think of it? Where would they get the tissue from? I know of a peritoneal vaginoplasty and a sigmoid colon vaginoplasty

My knowledge is rather limited but as far as I know there may be some limited grafting but basically &#34;Vaginal Re-deepening&#34; is re-using as much of the original material in place and usable. Basically just getting back to the previous result using still healthy tissue distorted by strictures and perhaps some healing that was not kept open enough hours daily and as many months as well to make it essentially permanent.
</p>
<p>
I got out of the habit later on and have lost some width several times but always was able to open up 100% again but did think I lost 1&#34; depth permanently. I got a little more vigorously enthusiastic a few times and one day I felt strangely deeper and re-measured and suddenly I am back to barely deep enough for shorter disks at 4.75&#34; or so. I was told 5&#34; after my surgery was all the depth safely doable to my abdominal wall but that sounds like an excuse for the surgeon.

<p>
And a number had pelvic floor training,

may be more.
</p>
<p>
And looking for local med people who are experienced with trans people may also be recommendable. Asking at lgbt places or support groups for a referral may be a good idea.
</p>
<p>
This way a deepening revision may not be necessary.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise it may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.

may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time.
