Would you take the risk of trying a new FFS surgeon (Dr. Artur Fahradyan) who has already produced fantastic results but just doesn&#39;t have much history yet?

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/mdartplasticsurgery">I&#39;m seriously impressed with his work,
</a>
which went viral the other day. He does subtle very very well and is exactly what I&#39;m looking for - I&#39;ve been stealth and post-op for 11 years, but courtesy of the ongoing trans panic, I&#39;d sleep better at night if I was slightly stealthier.
</p>
<p>
Did the consult. I have absolute confidence that he knows what he&#39;s doing and is bringing the best possible technique and technology to the table. I was flirting with Cardenas or Rossi to save a buck but the risks seemed elevated; with Fahradyan... the only risks are that he doesn&#39;t have much of a track record of FFS, he doesn&#39;t exist on Realself,
<del>
and that he&#39;s board eligible instead of board certified
</del>
(although, there are board certified butchers, so, maybe he has his priorities straight) - even if he has a solid record of research and doing other surgeries which, frankly, require more surgical skill. Quote came in at 35k, which, if my intuitions are right re: surgical talent, will probably wind up being 70k in 5 years.
</p>
<p>
Do we have a consensus on Artur Fahradyan? Would you roll the dice vs. Mardirossian to save ~25k and get scheduled sooner rather than later?
</p>
<p>
Edit: 12/24/2024 - the good doctor has finished the board certification.

I wouldn’t put so much stock into a single good result, there can be a lot of variation case to case. It’s more important that you had the consult and felt comfortable, esp if you are informed about modern ffs practices. Nobody could really tell you whether it’s worth “taking the risk”, it depends on your patience and financial ability.

I had revision FFS with Fahradyan and my friend had first time FFS with him as well. I will say I was hesitant at first because I couldn&#39;t find that much of him online. I am stealth for over 15 years and was already very feminine looking before. I&#39;m 3 weeks post op and I believe him to be a genius. You can just see the precision of his work on my face. My friends face looks flawless.

It&#39;s good to know that I&#39;m not alone in picking up on &#34;undiscovered genius&#34; vibes, like... He&#39;s the guy you&#39;d go to fix where other FFS surgeons have failed, and is hypercompetent in ways that completely outclass some of the others in the FFS space. I specifically asked about risks with jaw surgery, and he&#39;s like, yeah, that&#39;s a risk, but here&#39;s how you fix it - versus all of the other horror stories where I don&#39;t think the surgeon knows how to fix their own errors.

I think he&#39;s about to make a big name for himself. My first FFS wasn&#39;t botched I just was convinced by a big name plastic surgeon to do very little changes the first time. Honestly he&#39;s very thorough, very serious, very meticulous. My experience overall has been great and my healing while tough at first has gone smoothly as well. Good luck to you! I&#39;m sure everything will go great :)

I&#39;ll book the consult with them - but, honestly, I think I feel better with Fahradyan.

I know exactly what you’re talking about. Like the post online, but yeah I had a consult with him a few weeks ago and quoted me around the same price as you. Said the lower half of my face is very feminine and basically wouldn’t touch it, Mardirossian said the same thing to me but cost more. But he has more experience. I liked Mardirossian the best out of all the surgeons I had a consult with.
