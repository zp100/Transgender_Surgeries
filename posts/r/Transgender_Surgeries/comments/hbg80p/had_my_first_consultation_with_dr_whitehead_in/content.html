I&#39;m posting this here because I couldn&#39;t find any information on this doctor other than &#34;he was trained by Dr Reed&#34;/&#34;replaced Dr Reed&#34; and any bit of information helps, especially in the state im in with barely any surgeons for this.
</p>
<p>
So I just had my consultation with Doctor Whitehead and it didn&#39;t go too well. I brought my fiancee in with me since she&#39;s going to be helping me recover.
</p>
<p>
He started off only talking about insurance stuff, said that he was doing trans surgery stuff to help the community,  etc. Then he said he&#39;s the cheapest surgeon around and all other surgeons are only there to make money, the price he gave us was $25,000.
</p>
<p>
He talked about not doing anything in any hospital rooms constantly to save money and, oddly, to make sure I didn&#39;t get unwanted publicity and people staring or something?
</p>
<p>
Then he talked a bit about the procedure finally. He does his work and then the patient stays there for 24 hours and is basically dropped in a hotel and stays there for a week. His estimate for recovery was 3 months which sounds standard.
</p>
<p>
Then I had to keep asking about what the actual surgery itself would be, what method he used etc. He said he uses penile inversion and uses some of the urethra at the front for lubrication? He went on a tangent about how &#34;all the other surgeons are urologists and [can&#39;t remember what other surgical/medical practice] and that they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing but he&#39;s a trauma surgeon so he knows what he&#39;s doing. He blasted sigmoid colon vaginoplasty saying it doesn&#39;t work and just causes complications then said peritoneal is &#34;just a gimmick&#34; and went on a 10 minute long tangent about how penile inversion is the best method that works 100% of the time and is the only one WPATH recommends which makes it the best.
</p>
<p>
He also said he&#39;s completely 100% dedicated to trans people and started his practice to help trans people, but his site hides any and all trans stuff behind a tiny button several pages in that leads to another site that&#39;s really poorly done with a ton of typos. Not the exact but a red flag I noticed before booking the consultation. The site also has 5 examples none of which show actual results or explain anything and one that definitely shows a different person in picture 2.
</p>
<p>
I would not recommend going to him. I haven&#39;t gone through with the surgery because I want to get my 1 shot right, but there&#39;s red flags all over this guy. He pushed really hard to take our money, (the first thing that happened was his accountant called to collect credit card information then hung up for him to call after) dismissed all other doctors and surgical methods, didn&#39;t want to even talk about the surgery I was seeing him for, kept repeatedly saying that nothing bad ever happens and there&#39;s no complications with his patients (shit happens and stuff does go bad. If your record is 0 bad cases either something&#39;s wrong or you don&#39;t get patients) and a couple other things that we didn&#39;t like hearing.

<p>
Seriously, run from this. You&#39;re considering having MAJOR surgery done to your body, and you need to be confident you are getting the best results and care you can, not the cheapest.
</p>
<p>
Buy a cheap bathing suit or a cheap pair of shoes, but not cheap life altering surgery.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, if your surgeon claims he has had no complications with his patients, he is lying. Complications can and will happen, even minor ones. This guy sounds like a used car salesman, not a accredited surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Glad you posted this.

Thank you.

<p>
I&#39;m getting a consult with Dr. Gallagher Tuesday since she just moved to Miami this year. They called back in 2 hours, the person that called back helped with insurance and money stuff
<em>
before
</em>
the consultation and got me set up with their app and told me what I needed. She told me about the 2 letters, ID requirements, and everything else required to get ready for the consultation without hassle.
</p>
<p>
Gallagher doesn&#39;t work with insurance but so far just from the initial impression setting it up her business is set up professionally.

I was told upfront that she doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m still going to try to work an out of network thing out of my insurance but I&#39;ll be expecting to have to use care credit for it.

Awh that sucks that she dosent take insurance, it&#39;s going to take me longer than I originally thought now since Whitehead is off the list, could you let me know how your consultation with Gallagher goes if you don&#39;t mind?

I would be happy to.
</p>
<p>
Still panicking a bit since she&#39;s definitely really professional and I messed up scheduling and scheduled the consultation the day before I could even get my therapy appointment for my first letter.

Sorry for taking a bit to respond.
</p>
<p>
The consultation went great. She started with actual medical stuff and was nice and helpful. I&#39;m going to get the peritoneal method if my insurance will own up and cover it.
</p>
<p>
So about insurance Gallagher is out of network but my plan still covers out of network stuff, just at double the out of pocket max (still cheaper than the alternative) so that&#39;s something. She also has people that work with insurance to help get as much as possible covered.

Thanks for the reply, do you think she may not be in network just yet because she moved here recently? I&#39;m hoping in a few years when I have enough money saved up she will be in network.

I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll ever be in network sadly since insurance companies are picky. Hopefully she can get in network one day since the only person is really bad.

It&#39;s sad to see insurances usually only have not so good surgeons covered in network and then people going to them having poor results and complications and possibly it going really bad if the surgeon hasn&#39;t done the surgery that much which it seems to be the case giving the lack of information on them.

I’m a trauma surgeon... trauma surgeons don’t know anything about gcs. I’d only trust a trained urologist or plastic surgeon.

Glad you’re going with Gallagher instead.  Reed was known as “The Butcher.”  I’d avoid anyone associated with him.

I read about that a couple days before the consultation but decided to do the consultation to find out more about him. There needs to be more people putting information out there about these surgeons so people don&#39;t get tricked.

I know someone who is friends with a nurse that worked with a grs surgeon in south florida, she would take pictures of srs patients&#39; bits mid-surgery and share them. That part about unwanted publicity has this same stink attached to it and i&#39;d recommend to steer away from South Flo surgeons altogether and go to a reputable surgeon instead. I&#39;ve heard nothing but terrible things from surgeons here.

Gross. We heard his patients would wake up in the courtyard. Definitely would never go to Reed from his reputation.
</p>
<p>
Which begs the question of why this surgeon even went to reed in the first place. If it was really about helping the community wouldn&#39;t he, you know, do research about the surgeon he&#39;d be training under before he goes?

Holy shit. Run for your life! How does this person even have a medical license? You don&#39;t need a trauma surgeon, you need someone with urology AND plastic surgery experience. Anything less is a no-go.
