This is my experience and rationale while searching for my GRS surgeon. The fact of the matter is I have always wanted the GRS surgery. I have experienced severe genitalia dysphoria ever since a very early age. I came out to my mom at 12 years old and by 22 I asked both my parents for their help transitioning. Unfortunately their understanding of my dysphoria and the services back then simply weren‚Äôt available at that time as they are now. The DSM guide for diagnoses and treatment at that time was more about behavioral therapy interventions in nature. At 49 my dysphoria once again began to interfere with my activities of daily living. Causing me to deteriorate forcing me to finally come out to my wife of 16 years. It didn‚Äôt go well and soon after my marriage and relationship with my children became estranged. While coping with my losses and my inability to continue to function at work. I closed my business walking away from my self worth. I began attending some transgender support groups that help me through this difficult time. I quickly made friends with people who seemed to understand me. My new trans friends gave me good advice to get my name on a GRS surgeons consultation list ASAP, even if I‚Äôm unsure about having the GRS surgery. They told me wait times typically average about 2 years minimum.  That‚Äôs for just a consultation date with the surgeons staff. Its just the start of a screening process with mental health and medical staff. It is not even for an appointment with the chosen surgeon.  Due to my pending divorce I chose to move in with my mom. Shelter insecurities is definitely a problem within the trans community. Thankfully my widowed mom who I‚Äôd not had contact with since my wedding welcomed me back.  During my transition I have had to move with her a few times through the death of her 94 year old boyfriend and the sale of her Florida condo.  Back in 2019 I had been living with her and her boyfriend in Great Neck New York. I was happy to learn that Northwell Hospital System had a transgender center close by her boyfriend‚Äôs condo. As I mentioned I first tried to transition in 1991 but at that time no such centers or services existed. When it came time to pick a GRS surgeon Northwell was a logical first choice. Being unemployed and on Medicaid further limited me to doctors in New York who accepted my Medicaid insurance network.  Thankfully I was able to get a consultation with Dr. David Whitehead at Northwell physician partners in New Hyde Park.  I got priority to bypass his waiting list having been a patient at Northwell‚Äôs trans clinic since January 2019. Treating at the Northwell clinic had its perks.  It helped me avoid the long waiting lists at all of the Northwell transition surgeons that are otherwise required at other hospital systems in NY. During my consultation I was disappointed to learn that Dr. Whitehead only offered the gold standard penal inversion technique. To me it was no different then a dry sock. I had been aware that Mount Sinai had recently pioneered a newer technique that produced a self lubricating vagina using abdominal peritoneum. Since leaning of this technique I have had my heart set on that one. The Northwell doctor told me it‚Äôs considered experimental and he doesn‚Äôt do experimental procedures.  I was happy to find out that Mount Sinai did accept my insurance. Unfortunately as a new patient I would need to wait on a two year consultation waiting list despite being screened at Northwell. It immediately became apparent to me that Mount Sinai downtown office was a doctors surgical mill but I was willing to overlook that and was just thankful to be put on the conveyor belt. The staff at the Mount Sinai downtown office was cold sterile with no empathy. Total nightmare and should be avoided. Finally I got my consultation with Dr. Bella Avenessian and definitely wasn‚Äôt impressed she seemed younger then I expected. During my consultation she told me that she has lost favor with the peritoneal flap technique Dr. Ting uses due to the added expense it requires having a second surgeon being involved while simultaneously operating robotically in the patient‚Äôs abdomen. She was experimenting with a solo procedure replacing the harvest of perineum from the abdomen with a lower complicated alternate technique of harvesting similar perineum tissue from the scrotal sac. Disappointed and feeling like I was given the bait and switch. I soon began to frantically looking for other surgeon‚Äôs in New York that accepted my insurance. That also offered the peritoneal flap procedure. One of my friends was scheduled at NYU Langone Medical Center but unfortunately the surgeon was not in my insurance network. While feeling very defeated I found out that another transgender friend told me she has also been actively searching for someone. Her priority was based on speed to get it done fast because she was already 74 years old and didn‚Äôt have 2 years to waste on a list. I absolutely lucked out and I‚Äôm grateful when she told me that she just met this amazing surgeon Dr. Rajveer Purohit. I was ecstatic learning he also offered the technique I had been looking for. The same exact peritoneal flap technique that was developed by Dr. Ting at Mount Sinai Hospital. She told me his office is also associated with Mount Sinai Hospital System and he is listed there as the director of transgender surgeries.  Because I was already cleared by the downtown clinic I was able to meet with Dr. Purohit right away. As soon as I enter his office I felt like I was immediately in the right place. I believe the difference was that his practice is located uptown on the upper east side in a very nice neighborhood. He services a wealthier patient demographic due to his great location located on the upper east side of the city. Since day one I have always had an amazing experience with him and his staff. During my consultation with him it was immediately apparent that he really does care about the transgender community. He related with my situation and said to me at 53 you have had to wait way way way too long. I told him my difficulties and setbacks regarding my long wait at the downtown clinic and how my insurance will be expiring soon by the end of the year. I mentioned how Dr. Avenessian changed my surgical date from December 2022 to February 2023.  I was surprised when he said he can definitely get me a surgical date sooner well before the years end. I left him being heard. About 3 hours later after leaving his office I received a call from his surgical coordinator that they have an open date for me on Oct 27th. I felt like I just hit the lottery. I notice that with other surgeons their accessibility is a major issue. Not at his office. On the day of my surgery I was surprised when he gave me his personal mobile number and told me to call or text him with any questions or concerns. His entire staff have always been very accessible and I get the respect we all deserve. He is a very caring doctor and always gives me great big hugs ü§ó. I‚Äôd recommend him to all my family and friends in a heartbeat üíì.
