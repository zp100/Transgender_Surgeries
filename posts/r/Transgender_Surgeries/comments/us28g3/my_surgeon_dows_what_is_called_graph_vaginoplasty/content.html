I had surgery with him almost 4 months ago. Let me tell you heâ€™s AMAZING. Iâ€™m about 7 inches in depth, I was at my biggest dilator after 2.5 months. There bedside manor is AMAZING. I did have a mishap that required emergency surgery but it had nothing to do with his surgery ( I developed hyper granulation tissue that was so severe I had to have emergency debriding surgery)
</p>
<p>
So his technique is he took a skin graft from my scrotum and made it into my vaginal canal .
</p>
<p>
my scars are a little large but this is my first surgery Iâ€™ve ever had so Iâ€™m learning how my body processes and heals . If you want I can post photos in a new post but good luck if you need anything or have questions PM me ðŸ–¤
</p>
<p>
I am at full sensation and had my first orgasm at 2.5-3 months post op but I will admit he makes his clitoris big only because he wants you to have optimum sensation and we talked about either trimming it smaller or hiding it more with the clitoral hood 6 montages after surgery but honestly I love my clitoris and my husband does too !
</p>
<p>
Again Dr Figler and his team are Amazing!!!

They basically make the neo vaginal lining from the penile and scrotal skin and attach the blood vessels and graft that in.  That skin is more elastic so after proper post op care its suppose to allow max depth and least risk to complication.

You&#39;d have to look back on stuff from the 90s but it&#39;s practically penile inversion. Probably why you&#39;re having a hard time finding anything.  I can search on my next day off

This is what they said. I&#39;m few months away from consultation and want to read up on what technique he uses
</p>
<p>
They replied
</p>
<p>
The technique is a graft vaginoplasty.  This is totally different from old school penile inversion and much better for being anatomically accurate and having less occurrence of vaginal stenosis.
</p>
<p>
But I can&#39;t find any info. Maybe new? I dunno . Sigh

Is scrotal graft what is meant? That&#39;s a kinda different PI method, where the scrotal skins is used for the vagina

So figler a technique is either PIV with modifications (thatâ€™s what most surgeons do) specifically with the construction of the urethra and introitus.  The benefit here is less dilation and delayed start of it.
</p>
<p>
He also does PPT.
</p>
<p>
If you need more info, DM me.  I helped design the program there.

Thank you for the info! Interesting that he does PPT. I have a consult scheduled for June and thought he only did PIV. I love that this option is available!

I expect you&#39;d noticed this already, but Dr Filger has no reviews in the wiki. He likely lacks experience and there&#39;s no way on checking his work - there would higher than usual risk of having problems.

I also don&#39;t understand why some think, if reddit wiki doesn&#39;t have reviews then its risky or the surgeon lacks expertise and experience.  Such a low % of population use reddit then even a lower of grs patients use it.  Majority of patients keep it private and don&#39;t post their results.

Itâ€™s because the wiki does contain a representative sample of reviews. In practice thereâ€™s a strong correlation between few reviews and new surgeons. And new surgeons have higher complication rates - thereâ€™s even a paper in it.
</p>
<p>
And given the potential very serious consequences of a botched surgery itâ€™s something to be avoided if at all possible.

Hes not new . He works for unc and he can&#39;t post results on web even if he wanted to. Can&#39;t dismiss a surgeon because of no reddit reviews. it&#39;s ridiculous actually. If surgeon was bad he wouldn&#39;t of designed the transgender program for a major university and perform surgeries.  They would have him resign and they would replace him. My point basically. My post was about info on technique not how good surgeon I&#39;m using is and if he had any reddit reviews.

A lot of surgeons try to stay hidden due to religious extremist groups. One surgeon a Dr I had when I live in texas I couldn&#39;t find contact info for and you literally could only find by word of mouth.  Eneded up not being able to work with them because they didn&#39;t work with insurance.
