Yeah, even if there were a specialist within 400 miles of my hometown who had experience in this (there&#39;s not, I called them all), it would cost $2500 at a medical office. Worse is that every place I call immediately relates what I&#39;m asking for to what they do for women after mastectomy, which is entirely different for a handful of reasons - reasons that these clinicians readily ignore in pursuit of payment for a non-insured procedure that takes 5 minutes of time, and $100 worth of dermal filler. Dermatology is the least magical, most overpriced specialty in the medical field, because they&#39;re selling aesthetic commodity at medicinal prices, NOT because of any talent that they do or do not possess. I can read and understand the anatomy, and consider the risks and contraindications. I can buy the material goods online, sterilize my bathroom, and inject myself. Done. $120.
</p>
<p>
The only reason to see a doctor for something this small and low-risk is if they had firsthand experience with MTF trans nipple augmentation, and hopefully had developed an art of the procedure. But that&#39;s not a thing in my town yet. Hence why I&#39;m looking for someone with experience on here.

So... there is an allegory which would seem appropriate here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A large ship&#39;s engine stops working.  No matter what they try, they can not get it to move again.  Having exhausted all of their options, and knowing that each day is costing them significant amounts of money, they call in the worlds foremost expert to get it running again.
</p>
<p>
The expert arrives, and after spending some time examining the engine takes out a small hammer and lightly taps on the side of the engine.  The engine roars back to life, and everyone is ecstatic that the problem has been solved.
</p>
<p>
A month later, the owner of the ship gets a bill for $20,000.  He is furious.  He calls the expert and tells him he can&#39;t possibly change that much for what he did and threatens not to pay.
</p>
<p>
The expert then sends an explanation of the bill:
<br>
1) Hammer to tap with:    $2.00
<br>
2) Knowing where to tap and how hard:   $19,998.00
</p>
<p>
The lesson being that even if something looks easy, the years of training an experience that those who dedicate themselves to a given profession have is really what you are paying for.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t matter how many YouTube videos you watch - you will not have the experience that doing this sort of thing daily affords.  Yes, there are &#39;dermatology spas&#39; which have some questionable skill sets being used for the services they offer.  But a true Dermatologist - or better yet, a doctor with advanced training in cosmetic procedures - is going to have the skills and understanding to do what you are after both safely and effectively.
</p>
<p>
It may have only cost you $120 this time - but how many more times will you need to try to get it right (if ever)?  And do you truly know what is in what you are purchasing and from whom?  There is a lot of shady businesses - particularly in this area - on the internet, and it isn&#39;t easy to tell the good from the bad.  You may not have any issues now, but what happens in a year or two when you suddenly find yourself with lumps or &#39;unexplained&#39; pain in your breasts or even elsewhere in your body from migration of the original injection?
</p>
<p>
You have worked hard to be yourself - don&#39;t undersell yourself by taking potentially dangerous shortcuts which may ultimately make your journey longer (or more painful) in the long run.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes!  ðŸ’œðŸ’œ

Progesterone is the main hormone for nipple shape.

As someone who has adult female looking nipples without surgery it was literally obtained by high doses of estradiol injections and normal doses of progesterone.
</p>
<p>
If your nipples donâ€™t grow its probably too early in transition or you have bad levels

I mean there&#39;s also just that some ladies don&#39;t get cis-presenting nipples from a proper HRT regimen. Maybe most girls who are starting in their teens do. But I started at 37 and my levels have been good for about 1.5 years now. My nipples aren&#39;t really cis-guy presenting. (The areolas are a bit puffy and enlarged.) But the nipple itself is definitely not cis-lady nipple like, and I don&#39;t think estrogen therapy will get me there. My boobs themselves are like half-way there as well. But then maybe 2 years from now they&#39;ll have had more than twice as much time to feminize and they&#39;ll get there. Who knows!
</p>
<p>
For me anyway I&#39;m okay with having little nipples. But not everyone has control over this.

Hi fam,
</p>
<p>
Any MtF&#39;ers out there had nipple augmentation via injection before? I&#39;m seeking experienced wisdom on the topic.
</p>
<p>
I met a trans girl the other day who had *perfect* nipples. 1cm cylinders, pointing straight out. She said she did a gel injection to get those results, but I didn&#39;t get all the details.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward a few weeks, I&#39;ve done a ton of research, and surgeons and specialists use Hyaluronic acid for nipple augmentation (pretty standard lip/facial filler). I bought some of this gel online and ended up doing it myself. It didn&#39;t go as planned (shocker, I know). Nothing bad, but it didn&#39;t do what i was hoping.
</p>
<p>
For the life of me, I couldn&#39;t get even the smallest bit of the gel to stay in the nipple tissue. It was either too shallow and would squeeze out next to the needle, or like 0.5mm deeper and it would just float to back behind nipples, making the areola fuller. I tried going in from the side, pushing up into nipple tissue as i saw surgeons do on YT, and when that failed, on the other side, I just went straight down the center. Nothin&#39;. Too shallow, or too deep.
</p>
<p>
Anyone had this done before who can elucidate for me?
</p>
<p>
Holler @ yo grrl! &lt;3

Sorry, I shouldn&#39;t share this info. I watched several DIY estheticians&#39; videos on YT and selected one that they all recommended.

There&#39;s no way to take dopamine directly, only meds that influence dopamine uptake. You might be thinking about domperidone, which is a dopamine agonist, but it&#39;s literally banned in North America for anything but GI issues because it&#39;s so bloody dangerous and has a high instance of heart attacks and death.

Google nipple suckers or some similar expression.  There are many websites, Amazon included, who sell vacuum cups for nipples only or for nipple + areola and even whole breast.  The most effective for nipples would be the nipple only version.  A pair of these clear plastic cups with like a cork screw handle on the end will create a vacuum and stretch the nipple sucking it into the cup.  I&#39;ve used them and they will work.  The more you use the more the nipple will be stretched.  But if you stop frequent use, they will shrink back but not all the way back.  The more you use the more plyable the nipple becomes.  Good luck.
