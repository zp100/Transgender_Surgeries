Harrison lee has been under a ton of backlash right now. Heâ€™s known to really only give his best work to influencers, I spoke to a girl who had such terrible complications that she needed three complete revisions and still is unable to chew and eat without pain in her jaw. Iâ€™ve also not heard good things about his bad manner. I think Jumaily is one of the best for this kind of aesthetic. If asked he can definitely do aggressive work even if he leans more towards natural, but I wouldnâ€™t call it conservative. Heâ€™s used to doing the LA dolls and his noses and forehead work are awesome.
</p>
<p>
DB while good I find his personality offputting. I consulted with him and his attitude towards my questions and wants were kinda offputting. Jumaily really listened to me and thought about my questions and he spoke about how passionate he is towards our community. Which was great to hear.
</p>
<p>
I ended up choosing him because he also operates in Canada which is where I am. So it is super convenient that he does both locations.

I notice there&#39;s not many reviews of Harrison Lee on reddit, and there&#39;s a lot more on YouTube. Kind of odd.

Interesting! I watched Gia Gunnâ€™s YouTube video &amp; I didnâ€™t like the way he spoke to her at her 2 month post op appointment because she was skeptical about her jaw results.. he immediately cut her off &amp; blamed it on being swollen. She asks if he actually shaved her jaw &amp; why it was never hurt, she never had any pain. Iâ€™m very suspicious, itâ€™s at the 42:00 mark

Harrison Lee, Mardirossian, and Deschamps I think are 3 of the most popular. Lee is who did Nikita Dragun. I think  Deschamp and Mardirossian are more natural and tbh, I may be in the minority here but I donâ€™t really care for Deschamp. His results arenâ€™t consistent. Sometimes theyâ€™re great and sometimes theyâ€™re pretty basic. I think Lee is your best bet for that glam look youâ€™re going for. Heâ€™s definitely my first choice.

I did consult w him and personally didnâ€™t like him.  Found him too arrogant and during the consultation, I asked him questions to see if our visions aligned and he was completely off the mark.  His 3D computed renditions scared me ðŸ˜‚

I will say in Dechamps-Bralyâ€™s defense, his 3D renditions arenâ€™t suppose to be actually how you look like, but just a general idea of what the outcome might be. Most of his patients look way better than the 3D renditions he puts out. I do agree that heâ€™s quite arrogant at times but in a way  he earned it, that man know his shit to be fair. I personally did find the 3D renditions scary when I consulted him because I was more upset (like OP) that my aesthetic vision didnâ€™t line up to what he wanted for me (like the super high brows and the very flat orbitals for me). He does go for natural aggressive results IMO so glam isnâ€™t really in the cards.
</p>
<p>
Even though I am not a fan of Harrison Lee personally, he is your glam guy to go to; Jumaily is a good alternative but kind of split between glam/natural; I have been seeing Mardirossian pull off glam results where this user showed a PowerPoint to Mardi and he delivered.

When you consult with him, he takes about a dozen pictures (in addition to the CT scans that are required for consultation) and he posts them on some editing software.  He starts photoshopping you to give you an idea of what you would like.  The results was like scary bc it wasnâ€™t proportional.  Like I had a small forehead but wide face, the area I have most dysphoria with (my jaw) he said I didnâ€™t need (I always ask surgeons first what they think I need before I tell them what I want to see if our visions align) jaw contouring even though I def have a wide jaw due to an underbite as a kid.  In addition to his professional but unfriendly bedside and his extremely rude Russian assistant, I knew then and there that DB wasnâ€™t for me

Yeah ... I understand you... The surgeon shows a monsters face and tells you happily this is how you will look....I come to think of Spy Kids for some reasons (where that dude makes claythings that gets to be people).
</p>
<p>
It could make a great scene in a movie, though... :-)
