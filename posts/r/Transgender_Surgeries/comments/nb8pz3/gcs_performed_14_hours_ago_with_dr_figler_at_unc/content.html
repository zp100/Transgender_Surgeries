GCS performed 14 hours ago with Dr Figler at UNC Medical.  I plan to share  more details about this practice but so far a lot of positive!  They don‚Äôt have a lot of these under their belt but hopefully I can be an early report of quality and care they provide.  AMA!
</p>
<p>
** Update : Was discharged Saturday.  Went back in today to have bolster and catheter removed.  Everything is going smooth so far!  I will have drains for a week then those will be removed and I start dilation.  It looks great, minimal swelling, and I got 6.5 inches of depth!!!  Very happy with the surgeon and program here at UNC Medical so far.

Oh huh I didn&#39;t even know there was another NC surgeon (Im a Keelee Macphee girl, 3 months postop). Out of curiosity what drove you to pick him and what technique does he do?

Was referred to the program by my therapist in Charlotte.  Also met another post op woman who went to him and recommended.  Went to the consult and was immediately impressed by the Program Manager and Dr Figler who each spent an hour talking to me separately.  Penile inversion, don‚Äôt think he offers anything else.  The Transhealth program at UNC has impressed me as a whole with immediate referrals for BA and FFS, which were also both positive experiences!  ($2000 of free Botox and cheek and lip filler at FFS consult!). Apparently they have had high success getting insurance coverage for all three procedures and I know they do a lot for trans masc folks as well!

That&#39;s awesome! Its good to know that we are starting to get more options here. I&#39;m pretty happy with Macphee&#39;s work, but the extremely limited number of surgeons in the area was something that was really concerning to me when I was still in my research phase. Still, congrats and hope the recovery goes smoothly!

Hey there! I know this is a relatively older post but it&#39;s great to see such a positive review because I plan on going to Dr. Figler as well. I have a few additional questions if you don&#39;t mind answering... how far out did you have to schedule the initial consultation (I&#39;m waiting for a call back right now)? After the consultation, how long was it until had the actual surgery? Once you had the surgery, how long were you in the hospital recovering (aka how much time can I take off of work lol), and what&#39;s the at-home recovery like? That&#39;s all of the questions I can think of.... for now. Thanks!

I got lucky and squeezed into the program right before they implemented the waitlist.  I reached out in November of 2020 and had my consult that december.  They had me scheduled for a target date of June but ended up having a cancellation so I was able to get in early May.  I was in the hospital for three days post surgery and pretty much in bed for another week and a half after I was discharged.  I recommend 3 weeks total recovery but if you do not have a physical job two weeks would probably be possible.  Sitting upright is definitely still uncomfortable that early and I was fortunate enough to be able to lay in bed and work on my laptop

Hi! I have a consultation with Dr. Figler at UNC in November! On the 3rd! I am 23 and have been transitioning for 10 years. This is my first ever surgery regarding my transition. I read a comment saying staying on top of laser! Do you have any places you went to that did great in NC? Also will insurance cover that? How many sessions would you say you had until your hair was permanently gone down there?  Overall how was your experience with him? I‚Äôm so sorry for all the questions I‚Äôm am just super nervous! Congratulations on your surgery! üíïüòäüéäüéâ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I went to Cindy at accentuated beauty in Salisbury. She is wonderful.  I only did about 4 months once a week and had an earlier surgery than scheduled. No problems with hair!

Surgery was about 6 hours I believe.  Pain was a little more than expected at first but has been managed well since then. I am trying to limit my presses of the morphine button as much as possible.  Discomfort is significant, then length of having my heels in the stirrups has them fairly sore and they are monitoring my legs for compartment syndrome due to length of surgery.  My butt also feels like a pancake from laying so long!

Yes.  He is newer performing these from scratch but has been doing revisions for many years.  He seems genuinely excited about what he does, which is what gave me confidence.

Hi, I was wondering if you could give an update on this? I recently moved to NC and Dr. Figler seems to be my only in-network option for insurance and I haven&#39;t found much info on him. Thanks! :)

Sure.  2 months later I am healing well, no complications.  The staff has been wonderful to work with and follow ups allowed lots of time for questions and providing information.  The week still having the drains was fine but uncomfortable.  Being free of those was huge for moving forward.  Dilation has been mostly routine, some minor pains here and there.  Doing activities like bowling, golf, disc golf, hiking with no issues.  Still can‚Äôt submerge in water so will be happy when I can do that again!

Thanks for the info! I talked to them and got on the waiting list this morning. They said the oldest person on the wait list is from November. Blech. Once I actually talk to them if shouldn&#39;t be too long (well, relatively) that I actually get the surgery

Wow that is amazing!   How often did you dilate?  Also did you need to do anything special during or after dilation?   I‚Äôve heard of people needing to douche every time they dilate.    I‚Äôm also wondering how much age plays a factor but I have a meeting with Brad soon for a consult so I suppose I can ask him that

Thank you for posting your experience with Dr. Figler.  I have a consult with him for GCS at the end of February which is only a month and a half from today!!  Can I ask how the hair removal was and how many sessions it took, also is there a place in the Charlotte area you&#39;d recommend?  Any info or insight would be greatly appreciated!!

Hi! That‚Äôs so exciting! Wish you the best in your journey!  I used Cindy at Accentuated Beauty in Salisbury.  It‚Äôs a drive but she is fucking fantastic at her job and an amazing woman.  I think I did about 5 months of weekly 2 hour sessions to get there.  It sucks.  Definitely get a prescription for lidocaine prilocaine cream, some Xanax, and 800 mg of ibuprofen.  That‚Äôs how I survived!

Wow, thank you so much for sharing, this is all hugely helpful, especially sharing who and where you went!!  How the heck did you find the time to get it done though?  Looks like Accentuated Beauty is only Tues/Wed/Thurs 12-6pm and I work full-time, 9 to 5, as a software engineer and it looks like it&#39;s an hour&#39;s drive from where I live and 45 min from my work.  It might take me years to get that many appointments in, especially with all of my other Dr&#39;s appointments ü•π.  With Dr. Figler, how long was it between your consultation and surgery date?  Did he have a long waiting list?

It was supposed to be 8 months but there was a cancellation and I went in at 6 months.  I was a little earlier before they had to start using waitlists to even have a consult and like almost 3 years ago so not sure where it‚Äôs at these days. They also referred me to a BA consult and a FFS consult after my initial one and all of them were amazing experiences. Especially Dr Fisher for FFS that woman will hold a special place in my heart for eternity
