Hello!
</p>
<p>
So I flew to Bangkok a little over 4 months ago and underwent primary colon srs at Interplast in Bangkok, performed by doctor Theerapong. My initial experience is described in my first post. I was shadowbanned in the meantime (lol) and that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t reply to some comments.
</p>
<p>
My first post was quite dark but I&#39;m happy to say that I&#39;m way better now. Most importantly I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOCTOR THEE!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
First of all, let&#39;s talk about pain
</strong>
</p>
<p>
In my first post, I complained about pain A LOT. Yes, it was very, very bad but I&#39;m starting to get the feeling that my pain was exacerbated by withdrawal from pregabalin (Lyrica), which I&#39;ve been taking for neuropathy for almost half of my life. I was a &#34;nothing per oral&#34; patient for few days so I couldn&#39;t take it. Anyways, the post-op pain was
<strong>
very
</strong>
bad, but after few months, after everything stabilized, I regret nothing. If I had to, I would go through that process again. I still highly recommend taking somebody with you that will be with you at least during these first few days, so they can keep the nurses in check,
</p>
<p>
<strong>
What exactly happened after my first post
</strong>
?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I got some kind of weird infection. It affected mostly my labia, clitoris, and urethral part of the neovagina. It caused swelling, redness, discharge, pain and burning. I couldn&#39;t walk and tramadol  worked less and less. I had 4 swabs that showed no results. Went to 5 different doctors in Poland and finally empiric local antibiotics helped. I also got prescribed medical marijuana to help with the pain. It allowed me to function semi-normally. I was stoned all the time though, that didn&#39;t help with post-op mental fog. I&#39;m off of it now.
</li>
<li>
The smell - In addition to pain, I have persistent bad smell down there. Unfortunately, nothing helped with it. I tried both oral and local antibiotics and antifungals, all probiotics available in my country, boric acid, lactic acid. I even found a lube that contains glycogen (direct substrate of lactic acid). NOTHING helped and swabs shown also nothing. I gave up for now - the smell is very, very faint and differs from day to day. Sometimes it&#39;s fishy - that one I could smell through clothes. I had it only 2 times, each time for about a day. Most of the time the smell is hard to describe. The closest smell imo is penis after intercourse if you don&#39;t wash it after and go to sleep. Sorry for graphic description. The smell is very faint though. I can pretty much only smell it on dilators, sometimes toilet paper etc.
</li>
<li>
Brain fog - I had so f-ing bad brainfog. Even without weed I felt just very stupid, forgetful. Fortunatelly, it started to faint around week ago and now I&#39;m pretty much back to normal.
</li>
<li>
Sensation, orgasm, functionality - there is sensation inside,
<strong>
including colon part
</strong>
. I am able to orgasm, but it&#39;s hard and usually requires both penetration and clit stimulation (during dilation). My labia, both minora and majora have sensation in top half and only that unfortunately. I&#39;m still satisfied though. Also, I can squeeze Kegel muscles and push things from the inside if I want to.
</li>
<li>
Dilation - it was pretty hard during the infection, but now it&#39;s ok. If I&#39;m in the right mood, it is pleasant. If not - it&#39;s pretty much neutral feeling. I no longer have urge to poop after dilation and I don&#39;t dilate as much anymore - 30 minutes of XL dilator from Interplast every 1-2 days is enough AFTER I was able to dilate only with this size for 30 minutes twice a day.
</li>
<li>
Douching - Doctor Thee recommends douching with Betadine twice a day for 3 months. I did that. During second month my weight decreased rapidly. I lost 5 kg in 30 days which is a big deal, because I&#39;m overall very thin (175 cm and 58 kg). I had to increase my food intake by a lot, I pretty much was able to eat everything I wanted + I had to force candies because I wasn&#39;t physically able to eat enough calories to keep my weight from dropping. My first thought was that there was something wrong with my thyroid from all that iodine that I was kind of ingesting. Unfortunately, I went to endo few days after stopping betadine douching and my test results were normal. After stopping, my metabolism clearly slown down though and I started gaining weight. I&#39;m back to my normal eating habits from before the surgery. I stopped douching totally for few weeks. I hoped it&#39;ll help with the smell - it didn&#39;t. I started douching again lately -
<strong>
It is crucial
</strong>
. When I douched after a break, there was a lot of green-yellowish gunk and some hair (I unfortunately have hair inside despite electrolysis). And I mean A LOT of gunk. It was thick, size of entire bottle of classic vaseline. It had consistency a little thicker than thick snot, it fit in my hand. That was scary. Right now I&#39;m planning on douching once a week, because my vagina clearly isn&#39;t self cleaning. I use other female product, not betadine.
</li>
<li>
Scars - on belly they&#39;re very little (laparoscopic), like few scratches. Almost unnoticeable. Groin scars are very little visible too. They are little more noticeable on labia, because they got kind of hard and I can feel it clearly when touching. One thing that I&#39;ve never seen anybody mantion - despite low visibility of scars, the groin skin (and part of buttcheak skin, because incisions were that low) is kind of loose, like it doesn&#39;t adhere to tissue underneath and I can move it. It is noticeable when I stand up. String bikini isn&#39;t an option right now unfortunately.
</li>
<li>
Despite described looseness, I am extremely satisfied with visual result. I, myself am perfectionist so I see some problems (+ I don&#39;t like vaginas so they&#39;re not really appealing to me) like little asymmetry and little too big labia (but it&#39;s personal prefference). But let me tell you, when my boyfriend saw it for the first time, he was extremely happy, his face was like little kid&#39;s on Christmas when unpacking presents. Also, few gynaecologists complimented it too. I don&#39;t believe any doctor could make better job than Doctor Thee.
</li>
<li>
Functioning - after the infection, I still am not in my form. I tire quickly, I can&#39;t go to gym and I need the donut pillow to this day. But it&#39;s not that bad.
</li>
<li>
Dryness - my vagina, despite being made mostly from colon, is extremely dry. I have almost no discharge which is pretty weird. I don&#39;t need pads and there is nothing on my underwear at the end of a day.
</li>
<li>
Very, very important thing - I am still in contact with Interplast to this day. Not with Doctor directly, but with Lan. She forwards messages to him. They helped with the infection, checked on me, gave advice. I&#39;m in constant care, of course with limited possibilities
</li>
<li>
The area at the top of clitoral hood (junction between  the hood and mons pubis) is quite touchy. Touch is very unpleasant. I don&#39;t know why, I hope it will pass.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
So yeah, that&#39;s pretty much all that happened. I also want to say some of the things that nobody talks about
</strong>
:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Your vagina is
<strong>
alive
</strong>
. What do I mean by that - as I said previously, the pelvic muscles are working. You can control and feel them. You
<strong>
will
</strong>
<strong>
feel moving inside the vagina
</strong>
if you cough, sneeze, work with your abdominal muscles etc. It was very odd to me at first and I&#39;m still getting used to it.
</li>
<li>
Underwear is uncomfortable at first. For 3.5 months I was wearing only bathrobe if I could. I highly recommend getting at least 2 of them. If I had to go out - don&#39;t wear pants, especially skinny jeans. Switch to skirts/dresses for at least few months.
</li>
<li>
Donut pillow helps, but still is uncomfortable if you sit on it for low. I recommend laying or half-sitting as much as you can
</li>
<li>
Get medical stuff ASAP. Clinic gives you betadine, sterile cotton balls etc. but you
<strong>
will
</strong>
run out of them. At first you will need more betadine,
<strong>
sterile
</strong>
cotton balls/gause, saline. You also will need pads for discharge and those sheets that you put on bed and they absorb fluids. Also
<strong>
get a pillow between your legs if you like sleeping on the side.
</strong>
Also, just in case I recommend getting some douche device. Interplast provides those but it&#39;s better to have more just in case. You can find douches they use on Aliexpress.
</li>
<li>
If you buy pads, check if they&#39;re scented AND the material they&#39;re made from. I made a mistake of buying cheap pads that were literally just pastic, just little spongy. Get those that have area that touches the skin made from celulose (also, fck wings, idk who invented them but they&#39;re useless and annoying)
</li>
<li>
You will need A LOT and i mean A LOT of lube. I bought mine in bulk. Try to find one with acidic pH, water based and possibly without glycerine.
<strong>
Don&#39;t use USG lube
</strong>
- they usually have preservatives that can irritate you. Also, they sometimes can stain clothes.
</li>
<li>
When you buy dilators in Interplast (they provide 2 made of wax and you can buy more, made from glass), go to the biggest size. I made a mistake of buying them only up to XL. Back then, I thought L was too big and XL was &#34;just in case&#34;. Boy was I wrong... Trust me, get the biggest one, even if it looks way too big at first. You&#39;ll get used to it faster than you think. :)
</li>
<li>
If you&#39;re tall, buy additional leg space in airlines. Flight back is tough. Leaning back a little on the plane seat helps tremendously. I personally didn&#39;t need additional space and I could stretch my legs freely in Emirates economy (175 cm height). If you&#39;re 180 or taller, I&#39;d highly recommend thinking about it. Also
<strong>
wheelchair service
</strong>
and someone close to you to help with luggage are crucial.
</li>
<li>
Don&#39;t be afraid of pain. It is worth it
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
Future plans
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll have to get rid of hair inside. I don&#39;t yet know how. And obviously I have to fix the smell issue. I&#39;ll try to keep you posted!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Summary
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I really cannot recommend doctor Thee enough. Don&#39;t be afraid of Thailand and of colon technique. You will be in good hands! The effect is not perfect but in my opinion it&#39;s the damn nearest to perfect that human hands can achieve.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, I think that&#39;s all. If you have any questions, I&#39;ll be happy to answer them in comments now that I&#39;m no longer banned. :) Sorry for typos, I&#39;m not native english speaker. Take care everyone! Oh and don&#39;t ask for photos. I&#39;m not comfortable with showing myself.

Congratulations on being a colon girl. Did you have a sex with your boyfriend? If so, how was the experience?

I&#39;m not really comfortable talking details. We tried once but it was too early, I wasn&#39;t stretched enough. Neither of us enjoyed that. Right now we&#39;re waiting.

They don&#39;t lubricate more during arousal, yes. But usually they lubricate constantly and from what I heard, there can be quite a lot of discharge. I&#39;ve never heard of someone being almost completely dry like me after this type of srs.

How are you taking your hormones? Injection, pill, gel, cream? Asking because it is very very important to keep up on your hormones. I have a lot of lubrication and discharge even after 2.5 years post op myself. It is mucusy and also smells weird when it comes out on the dilator and on the condom I put on my dilator to to keep the dilator clean.
</p>
<p>
The thing about any neo vagina be it colon, jejum, ppv is that you need to keep up on your hormone therapy and some therapies are better than others. Injections though the most painful because of the needle, are the best and keep the neo vagina lubricating. Yes it doesn&#39;t make more lubrication when aroused but you being that dry could be a health issue especially if you want to engage in intercourse.

Hey hey, I did mine with T also. Was staying at room 1916. Not sure if you stayed there. My op was first week of Nov 2024. I’m kinda the opposite of you. Very little smell, but lots of discharge. I didn’t get the dilators from them. Only the wax ones. Got mine from soul source. I’m about the same as you too. 173@59kg when I arrived, but I am guessing I was 53kg 1 week post op. I barely managed to gain back to 57kg before I left.
</p>
<p>
Now that I have gotten the soulsource I had always been wondering if I could have just saved the trouble of just getting their local straight dilators. Just curious how big is your XL?   From what I gathered, soulsource XL (bigger orange) might be the local’s XXL or XXXL. And yeah, lan calls it XL.

I think I stayed in 1918 but my memory from that time is very foggy. It was the room at the end of the hall, on the right side.
</p>
<p>
My smell usually isn&#39;t strong fortunately.
</p>
<p>
They didn&#39;t give me glass dilators but offered me to buy them. All their dilators have same lenght, I think around 8 inches. XL has 35 mm width so it&#39;s like the green Soul Source one. XXL has 37 mm width so it&#39;s 1 mm smaller than the biggest Soul Source. And they&#39;re glass which personally I like more than silicon. + they&#39;re cheaper, 1000 THB each i believe.

Interplast ones are straight, fortunately. You don&#39;t buy set, just pick the sizes you want and buy separately. I bought 3 (M, L and XL) and they provided little case for them, free of charge. One downside of them is that depth markings go only to 6 inches. They are longer though. I&#39;m around 7 inches and I use size mark as my stopping point, because it&#39;s carved pretty much at 7 inches.
