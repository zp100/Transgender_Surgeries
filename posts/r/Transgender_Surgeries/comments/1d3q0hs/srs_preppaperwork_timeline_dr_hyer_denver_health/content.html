I&#39;m intending to make a
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bottomsurgery2024/comments/1d4clyz/index_of_posts/">series of posts</a>
from this throwaway account to document my SRS experience with Dr. Hyer at Denver Health. You should be able to see any posts I make in this account&#39;s history. This first post intends to cover basic stuff I did pre-surgery, while I plan on making more posts covering the actual post-op results (which will include pictures).
</p>
<p>
As a note to the moderators - this is my second attempt at this series of posts. I&#39;m assuming my first throwaway account is just going to be shadowbanned forever.

<strong>
Why do SRS?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Mostly putting this as a section for those who are questioning whether or not they want bottom surgery, especially if they may feel rather ambivalent about their penis (like I was).
</p>
<p>
I sometimes wavered on getting bottom surgery because my dysphoria didn&#39;t feel like the worst dysphoria. I didn&#39;t actively hate having a penis, and wasn&#39;t completely bothered looking at it or even showing it to a doctor if needed. But at the same time, I hated that I couldn&#39;t wear tight clothing (ex. leggings or bikinis) without a bulge showing having to do some tucking. I specifically also asked some cis guy friends about their thoughts on bottom surgery, to which one described it as &#34;body horror&#34; for him. Their reactions helped convince me that simply being willing to undergo bottom surgery (and its accompanying long recovery) is a pretty good sign that I should go do it.
</p>
<p>
After having bottom surgery, I can say that I am much happier to not have to worry about some extra bits of flesh between my legs that can get painfully squished. I also enjoy not having to tuck.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Why Denver Health?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I live in Colorado and Denver Health accepts my health insurance - so logistics were the driving factor for me. Dr. Hyer has been doing bottom surgery since 2017, so I felt comfortable that I wasn&#39;t going to be a guinea pig patient. The anecdotal number I&#39;ve seen bandied about on the internet is &#34;50-100 surgeries&#34; before a surgeon irons out all the kinks, so about 1-3 years depending on how many surgeries they do.
</p>
<p>
I also considered:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UC Health, which also accepts my health insurance. They literally never responded to my calls so I stopped trying after a few months.
</li>
<li>
Dr. McGinn (New Hope PA). She doesn&#39;t accept health insurance and it would have been logistically difficult for me to arrange to stay halfway across the country for initial recovery. I quite liked McGinn&#39;s aesthetics and her many years of experience, but those weren&#39;t strong enough factors to override the out of pocket costs (of both surgery and living away from home for a few months).
<ul>
<li>
I did do a consult with Dr. McGinn just so I had a backup option, but it was still difficult to justify the out of pocket costs, especially compared to the relative simplicity of driving to Denver and being able to recover at home, not too far from Denver.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
Timeline:
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
January 2023: Began reaching out to surgeons to get paperwork started. Surgeons I contacted were Koutzanis (UC Health), Hyer (Denver Health), and McGinn (independent). I was targeting a surgery date of Winter or Spring 2024.
<ul>
<li>
Scheduled a consult with McGinn for July 2023 ($150 out of pocket cost for the consult).
</li>
<li>
Denver Health scheduled me for a required Zoom session that went over the basics of bottom surgery.
</li>
<li>
UC Health said that I could go on a waitlist because scheduling hadn&#39;t opened up yet for future dates.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
January 2023: Started hair removal. I went straight for a local electrologist and didn&#39;t bother with laser hair, as I wanted to reduce the odds that any hairs were missed (I was quite worried, probably for no good reason, that the 1% of hairs missed by laser could become an issue with surgery). Sessions were once a week for 2 hours.
<ul>
<li>
Dr. Hyer does do a follicle scrape, but I&#39;ve heard this described as &#34;it&#39;s not the surgeon who will have to deal with hair in the vagina,&#34; so I didn&#39;t want to just rely on that after laser.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
February 2023: Attended Denver Health&#39;s required Zoom session. There were multiple people on this call (hosted once a month, from what I gathered), and it looked like a general info session for those who may not have done their own research.
</li>
<li>
April 2023: Realized that I fucked up and was supposed to send Denver Health my mental health letters on my own volition. I was under the impression that they would reach out to me for these once they checked some boxes on their end. This was entirely my fault, because they said in the presentation to send in stuff and then they&#39;d start processing things.
</li>
<li>
May 2023: Scheduled a phone consult with Dr. Hyer for September 2023 and an in person consult for January 2024.
</li>
<li>
July 2023: Had an in person consult with Dr. McGinn. Total out of pocket cost for surgery was $27,200 (including hospital stay), but did not include extra stays in New Hope PA or cost of staying nearby for an extended period of time.
</li>
<li>
August 2023: Electrolysis sessions dropped down to once every 2 weeks
</li>
<li>
September 2023: Electrolysis sessions dropped down to once every 4 weeks to hit regrowth
</li>
<li>
September 2023: Had a phone consult with Dr. Hyer. Scheduled surgery date for April 2024.
<ul>
<li>
I&#39;m unclear the purpose of this phone consult; it really sounded like most of the same stuff as the presentation.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
January 2024: Had an in person consult with Dr. Hyer, where she was able to actually look at the material available to work with.
</li>
<li>
March 2024: Final electrolysis session about 4 weeks before surgery
</li>
<li>
April 2024: Surgery
</li>
</ul>
