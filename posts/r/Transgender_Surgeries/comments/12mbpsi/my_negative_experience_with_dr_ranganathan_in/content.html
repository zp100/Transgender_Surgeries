I’m writing this in the hopes that it can help someone else, because unfortunately I made the mistake of having surgery with Dr. Ranganathan due to finances and my insurance situation and am now deeply, wholly regretting it. If this is too long to read fully just please stay away from her and her team for FFS, even if it’s covered by your insurance, it’s better that you either save for a quality out-of-pocket doctor with a track record or simply go without.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Kavitha Ranganathan was the only doctor who performed FFS that was covered by my insurance. I’m not well off enough to afford it out of pocket or have good enough credit for a loan, so though I had been doing consultations with many surgeons across the country, they were all significantly out of my price range and I have been desperate for FFS since I started my transition, it was the one surgery I wanted more than anything else. I wanted to be able to look in the mirror and see who I actually wanted to be seen as, not the man who went through male puberty and  thirty-two  years of testosterone. She had next to no reviews and I could not find anyone online who had experience with her.
</p>
<p>
When I did my first consult, Dr. Ranganathan was very pleasant but there were a number of red flags that I should have addressed right then and there. First, she’d performed FFS on less than a dozen patients. Secondly, she had no before and after photos of her style, as any plastic surgeon has a specific tendency in their work, but the reasoning behind her not having any were that since she was working for a Massachusetts hospital, HIPPA was more in play than in a private setting. I asked why she’d not just asked for photo releases and the question was brushed aside. Lastly, she told me that she had to split the surgery into two parts, one surgery for the lower half and one for the upper half of the face, which no other doctor that I had consulted with had told me.
</p>
<p>
I first met her in late April of 2022. We spoke for nearly an hour about what made me dysphoric on my face, where I tried my hardest to impress upon her that it was the lower half of my face that bothered me much more than the upper half, but she insisted that my brow bone and nose were what really make me look masculine, not the jaw and chin that consistently bother me and that we needed to focus on that first. After reiterating that my brow and nose did not bother me, only my lower face, she told me that she would not perform surgery on my jawline and chin until after she had done the upper half of my face. I decided that if I was going to get the surgery, and get it all done, I felt that a few extra months between surgeries would be fine, even though the first surgery would yield minimal relief to my dysphoria. I let her team know that I was ready to move forward, and we spoke about a date in October of 2022. Her office administrator, Brenda, who, of all of her team was the most helpful and considerate, told me all of the information I needed to submit to insurance, two letters from two different counselors or therapists, she told me that she would get me in touch with the hospital’s for one, but never did. I got her those letters, and waited two months to hear from her about a date before reaching out again. She had still not even submitted my claim to insurance. It was now July, and she told me it was unlikely we’d have a date in October, because insurance takes a while.
</p>
<p>
At the start of this I lost my job. With that, I had to move to COBRA, and was suddenly on a timeframe that was not just “whenever we could schedule surgery.” I had until the end of April 2023 to get all of the surgeries done. I found another job, but the insurance provided didn’t cover surgery with Dr. Ranganathan. I called and emailed Brenda every day, and finally got a date for November for the top half of my face. I met with Dr. Ranganathan and expressed the short timeframe, and we spoke about having the second surgery in February  as soon as we could with some time to spare for insurance in case anything went awry. I spoke to Brenda about the second date for the first time in October.
</p>
<p>
November came and so did the surgery date. The first surgery was to cover my forehead, hairline advancement, rhinoplasty, and a fat transfer to my cheeks. She stopped by to say hi and to tell me, for the first time since we’d spoken, that I needed to “expect asymmetry” and then I was asleep and awake again, screaming in pain from, strangely, in the bottom of my feet. I was told that it was from the positioning during surgery, and not to worry about it. They gave me a painkiller, I vomited it up, they gave me another painkiller and some anti-nausea drugs. I had been under for surgeries before, but never had I felt pain like that in places where I was not being cut open. I couldn’t unbend my left arm for over a month without excruciating pain. I was told I would be staying overnight, but was not told that I would not be getting a room. I was dropped in a corridor with blinds for walls, right next to the nurse’s station, and lay there all night. I got a little sleep, but couldn’t stand to get to the bathroom, so I was stuck peeing into a cup-like contraption after they removed my catheter. The PM nurse was very nice, got me water when I asked, and replaced my urine receptacle, but when the AM nurse came in, it was a different story. She misgendered me to other nurses at the nursing station, wouldn’t get rid of the pee cup thing, made me walk to the bathroom even after I informed her that the majority of my pain was in my heels and made it hard to stand. I was left with a drain in my head that I had not been told about previously, but was told by another doctor who presumably worked with Dr. Ranganathan that I’d be going home with it in, however the nurse wouldn’t let me leave without confirmation about it from the doctor even though it was in my release paperwork. She also actually yelled at me for not reading the release when I told her about it, she told me I was not to leave until I actually read the packet I kept referring her to when she wouldn’t let my fiancee in to get me.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I did leave, though with a bad taste in my mouth, and went home. The paperwork said nothing about sleeping positions or needing to stay elevated as other doctor’s had spoken about when we talked about recovery, but I did stay aloft and I began to heal, felt everything was going to be alright, until I got my bandages removed and the cast off my nose. The surgeon was not available for my initial post-op, so I met with another doctor who I’d never seen but supposedly was present at my surgery who removed all my bandages, the cast from my nose, the drain from my head, told me I looked fine and sent me on my way, just to call me later and tell me that he just forgot to take some of the splints out of my nose and I had to come back in, even though it was again in the notes that those splints had never been placed to begin with.
</p>
<p>
The upper half of my face, in spite of how masculine Dr. Ranganathan told me it was, had never bothered me until after the surgery. The scarline is enormous and jagged, and when I asked why there are so many seromas and why the skin was so uneven, bunched tight in places, too loose in others, Dr. Ranganathan told me that it was done on purpose, because making a scarline that’s raised, not uniform, and up to half an inch wide will heal better and look better in the future. The sutures, though they were supposed to fall out eventually on their own actually became infected and I was put on a second run of antibiotics six weeks after surgery, and it opened new wounds by my temples with additional scarring. My nose now points to two o’clock if I’m looking at 12, and with my right eyebrow now drooping over an inch lower than my left, my eyes are completely different shapes, my cheeks are fuller but look “done” and have left worse hollows below my cheekbones than I had before, making me look skeletal and gaunt. The things that didn’t bother me about my face, the things I had told the surgeon didn’t bother me about my face now do, and instead of feeling any relief from this surgery, I feel more dysphoric and depressed than I ever have in my life. I was told that my face was carved down too far and I will need to have regular CAT scans to make sure the plates and thin skull that’s remaining aren’t caving in. When I spoke to the doctor about how disappointed I was with the first half of this surgery, she told me it would pass and “even my patients that came out well go through this,” and she said that I “could talk to their counselor, if that would help.” I expressed to her the things I believed would help me feel comfortable with my face at this point, and she dismissed most of them and yet again told me what I needed to feel better, without listening to what I wanted.
</p>
<p>
Then I was told by Brenda in the first week of December that she would submit to insurance but “I shouldn’t expect to hear back until after the new year.” We heard back almost immediately with approval and I had another post-op with Dr. Ranganathan where  she brought 2 extra strangers to the appointment, and reiterated that in her eyes the surgery was successful, and that I didn’t need the surgeries that I had asked for in the first place, what I actually needed was a therapist, and she was going to assign me one. I already have a therapist who I see bi-weekly and when I told her that she expressed that she would not move forward with any further surgeries until she was allowed to speak to my therapist about me. I found it to be an enormous breach of privacy, but agreed, because I was so eager to actually fix what bothered me about my face that she had not addressed in any way with the initial surgery that she told me would help. She went on to tell me that she had “no idea” that it was the lower half of my face that I took such an issue with, even though I had expressed it ad nauseam at every single appointment we had. She claimed we “would have gone about things differently” had she known I was more focused on the bottom half of my face. She also told me that “FFS is to change other people’s view of you, and not to alleviate your own dysphoria. It can’t actually do that” When I told her that, since she had forgotten, we only have two months left to get the surgery done, she told me to extend my COBRA, and when I told her we can’t extend it past said that I needed a second opinion from another doctor in the practice, that we would book yet another follow-up date. We did, and I had surgery two weeks before my insurance ran out.
</p>
<p>
What I had wanted was a mini facelift, because as I had aged my face had sagged considerably, making my jaw look even larger than it was. This was covered by insurance, but she refused. I wanted to round out my lower jaw and have sliding genioplasty and she made me get a second opinion, and the doctor she directed me to expressed what he would do, had he been the one performing the surgery. She decided the recovery time was too much with the surgeries he recommended, so she only agreed to sliding genioplasty. I am now two months out of the final surgery, and, for the most part, this has been relatively more acceptable than the prior surgeries, except that I had the sutures, which she new I had a reaction to the last time, push through the front my chin, causing pain and bleeding, as well as a half inch open sore that blew out like an abscess from the bottom of chin. I also now have a depression that’s about the size of a dime on the front lower left of my chin that looks like my face has been slightly caved in.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I feel like I am worse off than I was when I started, which is enormously disappointing when it comes down to it, because the reason I was seeking help was to be happier with myself, and, for me, it feels that she did more harm than good. I wanted to be able to look in the mirror without crippling dysphoria, now I still have that with the addition of constant pain, significant numbness, a crooked nose, a drooping eyebrow, CAT scans forever, a dimpled, uneven chin and large swaths of scarring.
</p>
<p>
This is only one person’s experience, but I implore you to go elsewhere if you’re able, or find any positive reviews to counter my experience. I had no information on her when I first went to her, and she talked a good game, but she’d only done a dozen FFS surgeries prior to me, and I hope I can stave off a few who would go to her in the future.

You need to complain to your insurance company first and foremost. They paid her, so they&#39;re your biggest ally right now.

If that’s the case, her OR report should have all the details as to who worked on her and for what parts. I recommend OP request that report to get more details as to what exactly happened during surgery

I am so, so sorry you experienced this with her. I almost went to her for double mastectomy top surgery around the same time, but she kept exhibiting red flags - some of them the exact same, like no photos and in my case, refusing to tell me how many top surgeries she’s performed - so I thankfully was able to go with someone else. Another person commented that it sounds like residents performed your surgery, and I am almost 100% certain that’s true because she told me that would be the case if I’d gone to her for mine.
</p>
<p>
Again, I am so sorry she hurt you.

OMG! You descibed my experience waking up with the feet pain. It was excruating. As soon as the nurses started waking me up and asking me how the pain was. She was referring to the surgery, but all I could do was scream, &#34;MY FEET. MY FEET&#34;. Right after that a nurse said it was from my position in the stirrups.
</p>
<p>
My feet hurt for days.

I wondered why my HRT provider, who&#39;s at the same hospital,  didn&#39;t recommend her for top surgery and gave me a referral to a specific surgeon (Dr. Agarwal) rather than to all of the surgeons who do top surgery there. I&#39;m sorry you had such a bad experience.

Please put in a complaint with the AMA.  She did the same thing to me, except I never received the surgery.
