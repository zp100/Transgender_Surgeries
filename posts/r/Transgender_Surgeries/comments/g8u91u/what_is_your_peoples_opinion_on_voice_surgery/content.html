What is your people&#39;s opinion on voice surgery (specifically in regards to yeson voice center) I have heard that some people think it&#39;s pointless/dangerous but I have also seen videos of people who voice sounds extremely natural after recovery

I have heard that voice surgery doesn&#39;t do much and such but then there are videos like this:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsgNuGDzMQo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsgNuGDzMQo
</a>
</p>
<p>
so I suppose I&#39;m just trying to get the general consensus. the surgery seems almost too good to be true (especially since voice training is something that has never appealed to me)

I had voice surgery at yeson and here’s my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/f1zu0c/my_voice_8_months_postop_vfs_at_yeson/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">results
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
A lot of people told me not to do it and that I should try practicing first. But practicing my voice felt so dysphoric to me that I couldn’t do it and would get suicidal after every time I tried. And with practicing, my voice never got anywhere near passing after about an year of trying on and off. The tutorial videos and everything seemed to me like “do this and that” but it seemed very difficult and never worked.
</p>
<p>
Surgery isn’t magic like everyone else says. But it definitely helped big time! After I recovered the first month or two my voice seemed to have hardly changed. They gave me some voice exercises to do and I couldn’t do them as much as they told me to, but they helped. Around 3-4 months though, my voice started to actually sound really different.
</p>
<p>
I still have to apply resonance and a bit of training had to be done after surgery to get my voice. But I don’t have to strain my voice almost at all to talk now and it feels so much more natural and easy. At the end of the day it’s your choice, please research carefully. And you can always ask me anything you want!

yeah, I don&#39;t get to suicidal levels when I try to learn how to train my voice but I definitely get feelings of &#34;what&#39;s even the point&#34; and things like that. Personally I never felt like voice therapy was all that effective because half the time the videos that try to teach it (unfortunately) still sound clearly masculine trying to imitate a female voice.
</p>
<p>
I personally do not expect magic from a surgery like this but to be more akin to changing the engine of a car. Sure you can replace the engine by hand if you&#39;re strong enough, and have a very good understanding of every single nuance of how cars work but there are tools available if you have the money that makes the journey easier. that&#39;s my opinion but i created this thread to hear others so :)

I’ve tried online voice videos and even had the EVA app on  my phone. None of those worked for me. I saw a voice therapist in person and I’ve been seeing her since  November and I don’t hate my voice now. Videos can’t give you feedback like a trained voice therapist will. If you can find a good voice therapist I highly recommend trying that first.

Personally I think you should do it if you have the money to and want it. A lot of people are gonna say do voice therapy first but some people don’t understand some of us just can’t do it. Because of how much strain I put on my vocal cords while trying to practice pre surgery my vocal cords were damaged or as the doctor told me “uneven”. So they had to fix that during surgery too(didn’t cost anything extra). So yeah it changed my life.

thank you, I try to respect all opinions and I am open to hearing them but i would lie if i said it wasn&#39;t mildly frustrating to hear the opinion of someone who only has ever done 5 min of research on the topic (not to say there&#39;s anyone in this thread like that, there could be, I don&#39;t know) but people who have done quite a bit of research and decided against it I suppose could be the &#34;main target demographic&#34; of this thread

You’re welcome! But all options before surgery should always be taken first. Surgery should always be the last option.

I would suspect that the woman in video already had voice training. I’m not an expert by al means, but she already didn’t have much resonance in her voice in the preop video and sounded quite feminine to me. The operation raises pitch, but won’t do much in terms of resonance and spearheaded patterns.

oh yeah I understand you have to train to get the inflection and stuff. but having a default hertz being higher just seems like it would be so much easier imo
</p>
<p>
speaking of botox, do you have to take botox medication for the rest of your life or is it only temporary? as in, does the result of this surgery have to be essentially constantly maintened with voice exercises and medication, similar to srs?

I had mine at Yanhee Hospital (Bangkok), I did quite a bit of searching online prior to making the choice (still I recommend yeson more, given the reviews I have seen)
<a href="https://www.yanhee.net/cosmetic-services/voice-change-surgery/">https://www.yanhee.net/cosmetic-services/voice-change-surgery/
</a>
</p>
<p>
Some photos:
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/lUFk98R">https://imgur.com/a/lUFk98R
</a>
</p>
<p>
Prior to the surgery, I do have quite a deep and low voice (110Hz). I didn’t quite do much of a voice training, as it was really hard to raise my larynx for resonance let alone pitch..
</p>
<p>
What the surgery does is pretty much these 3 at once: - limiting access to your lower voice (raising larynx for resonance, my neck kinda feels so tight right after surgery. Gets better over the months ) - making the vocal cords about 1/3 or 1/2 smaller (for pitch) - shaving Adam’s apple
<br>
It cost me around 3k USD in total with a 2 night stay in the hospital, the surgery took an hour.  Post-op, and I was up to around 220Hz.
</p>
<p>
Just let you all know, it is going to take at least 3 months of recovery and getting used to speaking with the new voice box.  Think of it like voice breaking during male puberty, as you are not used to speaking due to prior muscle memory that your brain remembers.
</p>
<p>
However the post-surgery depression is real 😤 despite the fact that I was assured again and again. I couldn’t speak on the first 2 weeks, a little odd raspy voice on the following 1 month.
</p>
<p>
It’s about 3 months mark before things got better! And I could talk, and sounding reasonably female, plus singing a little. At about 6 -9 months mark, I started getting gendered as a female for most of the time over the phone.. (it was quite hilarious, I got a call and the person asked if I am his wife) Finally about a year mark before being completely natural..
</p>
<p>
The process took quite a bit of time, but very little effort on my part than voice training without the surgery.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I am really happy for the change. I was so dysphoric about my voice prior to the surgery. Even hearing record of my own voice on the phone gets me on my nerves..  Despite liking to sing so much, I just stopped just shortly into my teens. (Stupid puberty). I am almost doing it everyday right now, as I listen to music, while training to get to an even higher pitch 😉
</p>
<p>
If you need more samples, feel free to check out their YouTube channel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ornouma1">https://www.youtube.com/user/ornouma1
</a>
</p>
<p>
Maybe if I’m less shy about myself, I might post some voice samples that I have saved 😤 but you get the idea, the YouTube videos are quite close to the change I experience

Price isnt an issue by any measure, its more about the results and reviews that I see (i.e its youtube channel, and other blogs)
</p>
<p>
At that time I wasn&#39;t aware of the fact that yeson voice center exist, or I would have chosen that instead as Yeson seems more specialised for that.

I went to Dr. Thomas and I&#39;m super happy with the result. Never did voice therapy and I could probably use it, but my voice causes me zero dysphoria so it&#39;s really a nice-to-have at this point

Yes, my insurance paid for it (though I have really really good insurance when it comes to trans healthcare)

Awesome that you’re still happy and thanks for responding. May I also ask if you are allowed to cough and sneeze again now that everything has healed? And do you you know if after it’s healed you are risk free or could it be that 10-15 years or more down the road something could happen to your voice because of the surgery ? Again don’t bother to answer if you don’t want to

It seems to be hit or miss, believe it is still classified as experimental. I would give therapy a 100% effort before surgery.

I think it is relatively new that it is better to have voice   therapy and avoid the risks from this type of surgery. I don&#39;t think it is necessary or that the perceived benefits outweigh the risks.

I had surgery at Yeson about nine months ago and the experience was great. Dr Kim is very friendly and professional. My pitch pretty much immediately was raised 50hz with no side effects. I didn’t voice train at all before, but I do need to now to sound how I want. That said, I haven’t been misgendered on the phone once since surgery so it does work even without training.

In my country, voice surgery is covered by healthcare when you transition. Ill definitly take this step

I did voice therapy, a bunch of nonsense, a waste of money, and I got nothing out of it. Yeson is awesome.

I thought I couldn’t get a passing voice for years, and I definitely don’t need it now after 2-3 years of continuous practice and work. Give therapy and practice a solid effort before taking the risk.

I have not done voice training. I am scheduled to get the triple with Dr Haben this year, assuming Covid allows it.

What I’d like to know is — because I also find it hard to form an opinion on this:
</p>
<p>
are there any studies conducted on that matter?
</p>
<p>
I know, us trans*folks are a small group anyway, so the number of ppl to conduct one on voice-surgery might be even smaller, but still... maybe there is something out there?! :)

Dr. Kim at Yeson published a paper with a rather large number of trans patients.

Yes definitely try voice therapy first. The surgery is so expensive and very hit or miss.
