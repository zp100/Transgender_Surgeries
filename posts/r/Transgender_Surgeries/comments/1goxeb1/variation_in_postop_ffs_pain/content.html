Pain is very low with facial team compared to most other surgeons because they use modern ultrasonic bone cutting tools. The bad pain you hear about is from surgeons who use traditional tools.
</p>
<p>
This is why almost no one needs tramadol there. Itâ€™s not that they wonâ€™t give it, but you donâ€™t need it. They do have stronger, but thereâ€™s close to zero chance youâ€™d need it.

Agreed. I had ssurgery with FT 3 years ago and experienced pretty much zero pain. It was a little uncomfortable the first night (wasn&#39;t allowed to drink water), and with the ice mask, but not painful.

This is really helpful :) thank you! Nothing could have prepared me for the first night in terms of discomfort, wow. But pain was very easy and I did not need any painkillers after the first night, which is incredible!

Pain was super mild for me with FT to be honest. And they have fantastic care if you request it (or sometimes pay for it). The only day I was really struggling I got this insanely amazing cooling massage on my face and it helped for days.
</p>
<p>
I think I was on paracetamol every 8 hours and ibuprofen every 6 hours for a couple days post hospitalization and it was very fine.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a definitive answer to this, like srs experiences are variable, myself I had minimal pain really for both ffs (forehead, chin, jaw, nose) and srs, and I took paracetamols only.

I had FFS with Facialteam this spring with forehead reconstruction and chin contour. The pain was quite mild, however the week after surgery was hard. I had a lot of swelling which was very uncomfortable and mentally exhausting.
</p>
<p>
Major pain is probably not very common with Facialteam, but you should definitely try to be prepared that the recovery can be hard even if the pain might be mild.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

So so so true. I was counting down the minutes during the first night and doing what I could just to keep myself from losing my mind and at least get to the next morning. I&#39;m so glad I pulled through though.

Happy to hear you made it through the first night. Hope you will have an uneventful recover.
</p>
<p>
It will get better as the days pass by ðŸ˜Š
