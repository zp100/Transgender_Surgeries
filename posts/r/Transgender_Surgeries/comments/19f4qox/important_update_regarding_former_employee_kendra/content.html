If anyone is wondering what this is about, like I am, there&#39;s been a Kendra trying to make comments here on this sub for the last 5 months or so under various accounts.

</ul>
<p>
They started off as the usual marketing activity that is not allowed under rule 6, but recently turned to criticism of Kamol. I&#39;ve no idea what is going on.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
6. Posts by people with a commercial interest in members decisions. Please follow
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/exrxnh/rule_6_posts_from_those_with_a_commercial/" rel="nofollow">these rules</a>
. You will be assigned a light yellow flair next to your user name.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is not the first time marketing reps do this.

Thank you!

<p>
But iIt may sound naive, but why should marketers advertise?

Yet more reason to stay away from this place, IMO. Faked photos, credible horror stories/appalling post-op pics, and the availability of far better choices make this surgeon one of my “stay far away from” when people ask me for suggestions.

This is untrue and not true to reality.
</p>
<p>
Every surgeon has his or her good and bad results.
</p>
<p>
In fairness, it must be added that failures are not always the fault of the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I have a well-known hand surgeon from Germany in my family. And especially when the date for my surgery was set, it was very important for me to hear an opinion and recommendation that was completely neutral.
</p>
<p>
These discussions were very helpful for me and I was able to prepare my body optimally (lots of exercise, no alcohol, no drugs, no nicotine, lots of sleep and absolute health at the time of the operation).
</p>
<p>
When I compare my results with the pictures on the Kamol site, I notice that my vulva is even more beautiful than the pictures shown there.

Hi, I wonder why you talk about fake photos and credible horror.
</p>
<p>
We are a JCI accredited hospital with high elevated standards, I wonder why you have so much hate against people who are working and trying their best to help other human beings.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the main letter and explanation about Kendra wasn&#39;t posted by Reddit, so I will post it again here.

Return my diplomas, give me the airfare promised, stop lying ( I realize that&#39;s a business practice) remove my name from every review. A native Spanish speaker also failed the &#34;test&#34;. The simple fact is Kamol considered transgender people as &#34;mentally unstable&#34; these horrible words were said on many occasions, in meetings. The hospital is toxic! It&#39;s all about money. Best regards to the racist transphobic bitch!  Why don&#39;t you contact me directly? I have an attorney in BKK now.

from what i get with the help of google translate, a certain kendra started working for kamol after being a patient of theirs. apparently kendra was supposed to take over communication with spanish-speaking prospective patients, but could not actually speak spanish (?) - kendra apparently stopped showing up to work and never returned the work phone &amp; laptop &amp; now kamol hospital is sueing kendra
</p>
<p>
i am really not sure if i am getting this right, hopefully somebody who knows thai can chime in
</p>
<p>
also, why is kamol hospital posting here?

I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s right for Kamol to publish something like that here.
</p>
<p>
But I would also like to give some background information.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of patients in the Kamol Clinic who speak different languages.
</p>
<p>
There are some countries where the English language is rather unusual (I lived in Spain for over 10 years and very few Spaniards can speak English).
</p>
<p>
As far as I understand, the Kamol Clinic employs some transsexuals or former patients in order to simplify this linguistic barrier for the patients.
</p>
<p>
The demand from patients who would like to try for such a job is quite high.
</p>
<p>
I personally saw how a friend from a German-speaking area tried to get the job because both the pay and the help for life in Thailand through Kamol are quite good.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, of course, as an employer you can&#39;t look into people&#39;s heads (we have a company ourselves with employees and I know what I&#39;m talking about). It is all the more annoying when the initially good and motivated employee turns out to be a slacker and petty crook.
</p>
<p>
I know that many transsexuals find it difficult to find a job and it is all the more positive when companies like Kamol want to offer such people a perspective for mutual benefit.
</p>
<p>
But I think it&#39;s unwise to publish documents about situations so publicly.
</p>
<p>
But well - of course we all don&#39;t know what else happened.

That&#39;s not true! I worked 14 hour days 7 days a week. Dr Kamol saw me every morning as he made his rounds. I just want my airfare diploma and my name removed from their reviews. I don&#39;t understand the hospitals end game here at all. Kendra
