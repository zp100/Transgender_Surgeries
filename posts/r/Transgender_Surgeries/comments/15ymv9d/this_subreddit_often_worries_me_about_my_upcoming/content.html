I have GCS scheduled for December of this year. I’m really excited and the. I’ll see people post some rough outcomes. None of those have been by my surgeon or the location I’m going and I still let it cast some doubt in my mind. I am counting down the days to surgery though.
</p>
<p>
Any advice for surgery you wish you knew before surgery?

I think because of this sub, I expected certain issues. I think I was lucky to have no major complications. I expected numbness and dehiscence and have/had both. I expected recovery would take a long time. I wish I could have been more sedentary during the first 3 weeks.
</p>
<p>
I think I wanted a better idea how my surgeon was going to construct my vagina. I asked and she was cagey, so it was a big surprise after my packing came off. But I am happy with my results.

What do you mean by cagey? So you wish you could have been full time recovery mode for 3-weeks?

Well to be fair what i asked about was what structure would be used for the vaginal dimple (the minimal depth structure for vulvoplasty) so I could make sure all the hair was removed and she couldn’t tell me. I wish I would have asked more about her specific technique. Although i think its kinda moot because she is going to do her technique. I’m not questioning that. And I probably could have studied her results photos closer.
</p>
<p>
Yeah. Even two weeks but i did too much even before my packing came of. I could have potentially avoided as much dehiscence and very much prolonging my healing.

Log off.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s my advice. Don&#39;t look at this stuff before surgery. I got so freaked out weeks before from all the people saying &#34;X surgeon is a butcher&#34;, &#34;No! Y surgeon is a butcher!&#34;
</p>
<p>
I just stopped looking at it. I stopped participating. I sat in my apartment, watched Netflix, and ordered food. My anxiety was sometimes so bad I would skip work or work from home because I was just dying of anxiety.
</p>
<p>
If you are happy with your choice and feel comfortable, no one else&#39;s opinions should factor in. Keep yourself and your loved ones in mind and no one else.

The anxiety is killing me. Not the anxiety about the surgery itself,  the every little brain worm that makes me think insurance won&#39;t approve the surgery, despite green lighting everything so far, or that the surgeon will find a reason to push my date back, despite every reassurance to the contrary.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad to know I&#39;m not the only one struggling.

I find this subreddit is invaluable because we get to hear all types of experiences. Not all perfect. Not all bad. Just real.  What ultimately worked for me is knowing that despite any possible outcome I knew deep down the alternative was worse. And I’ve not had a regret even during the very rough days of recovery.

like with a lot of things, people who have negative experiences or have questions are more likely to post. for every bad outcome posted here, there&#39;s 100 good ones. that said, i think its best to go into the operating room having a basic understanding of some of the most common complications so you know what to look out for. best to know and not need it than not know but need it

I got a snazzy-looking vulva. Pretty nice labia, if a bit small. Can&#39;t find my clitoris. I was asked by my surgeon, &#34;Will you be sleeping with men or women?&#34;
</p>
<p>
After the shock of such a blunt personal question was asked, I responded with, &#34;Both. I have no clue how my life will play out, but even women who love women enjoy penetration sometimes.&#34; He gave me what I got.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, I have a fistula near the opening, so I have zero fun dilating and definitely only love women, but as a trans woman, that has been a bleak and lonely road. Thanks society! No thanks to Caitlyn Jenner. People think that&#39;s what trans women are like: ENTITLED. WTF?
</p>
<p>
Wow. I had no idea that I was still upset over that stuff. Anyhow, yeah - tell your surgeon what you want! Butterfly labia? A large clitoris with a finely crafted hood? Sensate outside more than inside? You have to let the doc know! Look at batches of snatches and choose your warrior queen from among the elite few!

I really had no idea that you could ask your surgeon to give you specific results. I kind of figured that they put their best effort into each surgery and everyone got the best results possible based on their previous anatomical configuration. I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;d ask my doctor for.

Generally yes, your starting anatomy has a much greater impact on what might be possible. And complications can always get in the way. So mental-health-wise it’s probably best not to get overly attached to a particular aesthetic.

That is true, but if you don&#39;t ask, you don&#39;t get. Some surgeons won&#39;t attempt anything outside of what they know, which is why you can identify a post-op pic as a particular person&#39;s work. It&#39;s kind of a forever thing, so shop around!

Try to avoid the negativity! I ended up going to Chett in Thailand and on my first day of arrival, another woman knocked on my door and introduced herself. She wasn&#39;t staying in the hotels but actually lived around the corner. She proceeded to warn me about her failed surgery twenty years ago and her disappointment and, that I still had time to cancel the surgery. I didn&#39;t cancel, I just decided to avoid them.

To double and triple check yourself to make absolutely sure you chose the right surgeon for your GCS. We only get ONE chance at bottom surgery. There are no do-overs. Good luck!!

I will say I wish I had gone FFS before GRS. I think I had more facial related dysforia than i had genital dysforia. I think if I had FFS to start I would have perhaps not needed to have GRS, and risk all that i had on a pretty mid result.
</p>
<p>
I will say that if you have any doubts, or even kinda don&#39;t mind &#34;but it would be nice to have a vagina,&#34; etc- consider postponing in favor of FFS. There are plenty of trans women with penises out there living happy lives with other people.
</p>
<p>
If you have a tremendous amount of genital dysforia... well I still recommend ffs first. You see your face in the mirror, others see you at you most unfavorable angles and lighting.
</p>
<p>
No one is going to be upset that you went the less risky road of postponement, and FFS even has the potential to protect you in the environment of increasingly hostile attitudes towards trans people. You&#39;ll be a lot harder to &#34;clock.&#34;

I hope you have great results and try to keep a positive spirit. I personally had Peritoneal Vaginoplasty March 16,2023 and I had very few issues. Hopefully you have smooth recovery and healing as well

Going with an unknown surgeon is very risky. I’d not do it except as an absolute last resort and maybe not even then.

I think I’ve got quite a privilege when it comes to the surgeon I want to use as I’ve got 3 friends who all live under the same roof that he did PPT on. So I’ve got a gold mine of first hand experience with him and they’re all at a various time frames post surgery
