Honestly, you&#39;re fine with that forehead prominence but the surgeon should have opened up your eyes (orbitals) more, or done a brow lift, and done your nose. I think the prominence (dorsum) of your nose is the real issue, and the tip should be more narrow and defined. Not to mention the angle at the radix should be more open. You&#39;re basically where I am. Sure, you pass, but the results aren&#39;t really that good. People are telling you it&#39;s good because it&#39;s just pretty much fine... just ok.. not botched. They&#39;ve also probably never seen a truly excellent result. It&#39;s not what you wanted right? Classic Kaiser....

Thank you. I think the Radix and nose is what&#39;s throwing me off. I see my surgeon soon and I&#39;ll have to explain what I don&#39;t like.
</p>
<p>
Nose to forehead, orbital eyes area just screams masculine when I look in the mirror.
</p>
<p>
What does it mean to have my radix more open? Like vertical or a wider angle ?
</p>
<p>
I think my problem and why I&#39;m asking for help here is because I&#39;m realizing that Kaiser surgeons are trying to do the least possible. Then we&#39;re told to manage our expectations.
</p>
<p>
My consult was asking me what bothers me about my face. Then they told me what they could do and what they wouldn&#39;t do because it was already gender congruent (my nose). I&#39;m not a surgeon so I don&#39;t know how to feminize my face, beyond the obvious.
</p>
<p>
I think outside of Kaiser they study your face and make a plan to feminize it instead if gatekeep.

<p>
Like more open. The bridge of your nose should be flatter so the angle is more open where your nose meets your forehead. From the profile view, you want the &lt; to be wider.
</p>

<p>
Yup. They don&#39;t really have the skills to do most of the things that differentiate good results from &#39;meh&#39; results. Sure, they can cut bone and some can do ok rhinoplasty. But none of these Kaiser docs seem to do anything beyond the bare minimum level of training and therefor their patients get the bare minimum in terms of results. For some patients, this is fine, because they don&#39;t need much. But for others, it&#39;s useless.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;re just ENT surgeons. They THINK they can do FFS because they have egos. But if they were really worth anything at all, or wanted to REALLY understand how to help trans patients without the &#39;red tape&#39;, they wouldn&#39;t be working at Kaiser. They could make more money elsewhere. You might not want this doctor to do your rhino. They might suck at it... My surgeon messed up my Type 3 AND my nose and didn&#39;t do my orbitals at all after saying he would. It was a fucking joke.
</p>
<p>
One of the especially interesting things I talked to Dr. Satterwhite about at my recent consultation was that he actively goes to conferences, looks at new techniques and technology, does observer-ships, and works at other clinics and learns things about trans medicine from his peers. He frequently talks with Keojampa, and Bowers, and Deschampts-Braly, and other notable doctors. Yet, he didn&#39;t know my surgeon or any of the Kaiser surgeons doing FFS. He never sees them at these conferences... that says a lot right there. If you&#39;ve been practicing FFS for 3-4 years, and no other doctors know who you are in an already small, niche, surgery community you&#39;re doing something wrong.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Right again. The Kaiser FFS surgeon I saw didn&#39;t even take measurements at my pre-op appointment. Warning bells were going off, but I just wanted it so bad that I just chose to go for it. Turned out to be the wrong decision.
</p>
<p>
Before other people jump in and say &#34;your nose is fine, you pass blehhhhh!!!!&#34; I want to say that it&#39;s an ok nose. It&#39;s not a deal breaker in terms of passing. BUT, the problem is that it IS masculine; it&#39;s over projected and it&#39;s wide for a white woman. It also distracts from your eyes, which is the biggest issue. On a feminine face the focus should always be on the eyes. You&#39;re not crazy, and the fact that your surgeon doesn&#39;t recognize these things would seriously make me doubt their abilities.

Thank you. I really appreciate the feedback. I couldn&#39;t exactly explain what I felt was off on the upper part of my face and you described it well.  I haven&#39;t talked to my surgeon yet but I see her next month. Im not sure what to do. Im glad I got the forehead work and less square chin at least. Idk if I&#39;d want a revision with them, but with the virus everything is all messed up and I may be stick with Kaiser a bit longer 🥺

Well, open enrollment is over. So you&#39;ll be stuck with them until next year at least. I suggest getting a second opinion from someone independent of Kaiser. Even if you have to pay like $200 or so out of pocket. Do a bunch of research this year and make an informed decision about your revision for when you get new insurance.

I hear you. I&#39;m in group 1B because I&#39;m a high school teacher. We were just told that vaccines for us are being delayed again. I doubt I&#39;ll get it before March. If you get that BC/BS plan you have a lot more options Satterwhite and Justine Lee both take that plan. You may even be able to coax them into covering Deschampts-Braly or Keojampa. Although, since you only really need your nose done, I&#39;d suggest looking for a really good rhinoplastician and seeing if you could get them covered. Dr. Tanya Judge in SF is pretty excellent I think. She did my BA last year and was super great. She listened to me, and did exactly what I asked for and didn&#39;t have a bunch of preconceptions about me and my body.

Hey, who was ur surgeon with Kaiser? I had surgery with Julie ammes at Kaiser and my lower face feels botched. My upper face is decent but it’s not what I wanted. I’m going to see two other surgeons with Kaiser, Stacey Francis. I can’t afford the cost of a good surgeon, but I’m scared to go through this again and hate myself.

I do think if the nose is a little smaller / thinner on the tip, it would feminize u more. I agree that the apple of the cheeks  can make use more filler. Forehead is fine, it is 1/3 of your overall face so it should be within the right  ratio

I don&#39;t think your forehead would benefit from anymore work. But, I think your cheeks would benefit from augmentation.

In what way? My surgeon told me that my cheek bones were high and feminine, but she also didn&#39;t want to feminize my nose. Ik Kaiser approves the least amount that they can justify.

I feel like I&#39;m going crazy everyone telling me it looks good. But it&#39;s clear to me when I look in the mirror that the forehead and even nose, and nose to transition to it screams masculine.

Girl, it does look fine.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re only 5 weeks, I would advise taking some emotional time off and trying to relax, as you seem a bit exhausted (or maybe I&#39;m just projecting, can&#39;t tell 🤷‍♀️). Treat yourself to something nice and just let the new look grow on you - both emotionally and physically, before you start contemplating any further work.
</p>
<p>
No harm in taking one&#39;s time.

The transition between your forehead and nose is fine. If u are not passing, that isn&#39;t the reason, its something else. Im neither nice or dishonest.

Well they are linked aren&#39;t they? The level of dysphoria you feel should correspond directly with how well you pass. But, what I and so many others have told you, is that your forehead is fine.
