Your result looks very good (one of the best I&#39;ve seen), I don&#39;t think you need revision surgery, but it just depends on what you want

Wonderful result.  Other surgeons should learn from him.  Is it so difficult to create cis-looking labia minora and clitoris?

I&#39;m about to start the process of ppt with theerapong at amani. I have a rough idea of what to expect but ultimately I just wanna know about your nerves in the lead up and your reaction after if that&#39;s alright to ask? Basically how scared were you? Cause despite knowing it&#39;s something I want I am terrified üòÖ

Good question tbh. I actually have been in this sub for years but this is my throw away handle. Hence its obvious that lot of research and interview/pinging others here and hearing from them helped. It‚Äôs much more last surgery after ffs and ba recovery.
</p>
<p>
What to expect? Smooth and relaxed experience. They had a different way to manage such procedures and recovery hence it‚Äôs definitely different from Europe.  I‚Äôm usually relaxed and was totally relaxed and happy before surgery, knowing I‚Äôve made all prep, this is as much as I could do given the timeline. Yoga and meditation, soothing music or some Rom com etc helps, pain management was not a problem and medication was always in place well ahead so i never had to ask for anything. Most challenging aspect despite all this is emotional wellbeing. We have to keep that in mind that it‚Äôs a difficult and a long surgery, hence all the medication and that means that it will take a few days of no stress and total focus on recovery to get back to good emotional health.  Usually in 2-3 weeks you get to a good point and untill then rest, relax,üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è dilate, clean, eat and sleep.  Going there in a medical visa helps. It‚Äôs an easy process. Better to avoid tourist 28 days visa.

Thanks so much for the reply. Honestly I felt a kind of zen waking up from ffs knowing I&#39;d done the right thing but going in was also pretty nerve wracking and I&#39;m worried it&#39;ll be tenfold for this. You&#39;re not the first to recommend meditation and it seems like, given the amount of people who&#39;ve recommended it, I should definitely give it a go, lol. So I think you may be the nail that breaks the camels back on that, thank you üòä
</p>
<p>
The medical visa is a good shout though, I haven&#39;t had that recommended before but I&#39;ll look into it üíö
</p>
<p>
Your results are brilliant btw, extremely cis passing. Every time I see new results from theerapong it reassures me and yours are no different. I hope I get as lucky when it&#39;s my turn üòä

I‚Äôll be there in under 10 weeks at this point. I‚Äôm both excited and nervous. Your results look awesome, and give me a lot of hope. Did you take in an example you wanted to get close to, or just let him do his thing?

Indeed, I left behind few things with Amani team which might be of help to other girls in recovery such as a chrome cast, usb c hdmi converter which fits Airbnb and hospital tv , few toiletries, tbh two carry bags of stuff etc etc so these are tiny things but could be passed over from one to another and might go a long way to those in recovery and looking for these things.. So we all ‚Äú pass it on‚Äù for the community üôè

I am VERY curious to see what your healing looked like at the 1, 2, and 3 month marks as I am just 5 weeks post PPT myself and feel like my labia are large.  Though it could just be swelling g and I‚Äôm paranoid.

Ngl first 4 weeks are definitely challenging and if required weekly consultations with medical team and gaining back strength. 4-8 weeks things stabilise - swelling will come down and 12 weeks onwards is a road to stable recovery, slow walks to keep up circulation. First 6 months is a total focus with top priority on dilation and medic care ..I‚Äôll say we have to be in the mindset that any kind of rework can only happen after 8-12 months as it‚Äôs a long surgery 8-11 hrs so no point in worrying, let see how things go and wait, eventually things fall in place. I‚Äôll do a photo log as I did a everyday photo log

I had recently a revision with him, have you had any issues with healing on the top part of the vagina ok the sides of the clit where the labia majora are folded into creating minora? Like holes from too deep stitches?

Hey girl amazing result.
</p>
<p>
I am 2 months post op with Dr Thee myself and the swelling is still crazy, my labia are huuuuge.
</p>
<p>
When did the swelling really come down for you? And did you do anything to help it?

Yes it eventually comes down so nothing to worry! Also bit of slow walk time to time to help keep circulation helps. Healthy food and relaxation, some massage helps too..
