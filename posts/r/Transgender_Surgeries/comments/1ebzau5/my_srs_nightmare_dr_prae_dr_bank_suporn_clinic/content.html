for more than a year now i have been silent as my life crumbled around me. i wanted to wait to say anything until i knew for certain what the cause of my issues were and if my surgeons were at fault for anything. i no longer expect that i ever will know the answer to those questions, but as i’ve started receiving dms of new cohorts asking me for advice with Dr. Prae, i feel it necessary that I make public what has happened to me. i was afraid to share my experience because i did not want to deter anyone from getting srs based on my story. i do not regret getting srs. all surgeries carry some amount of risk. amongst my cohort, i am alone in my suffering to the degree that i am. i consider my situation to be a case of exceedingly bad luck. knowing what i know now, if i could go back, i would roll that die again. i was also afraid that if my story caught enough eyes, the clinic might get wind of it and i was unsure if i would need the clinic for something at some point in the process of my recovery. at this point, i don’t think i would use the clinic again following my experience with revision. lastly, i want to note that i am thrilled with the aesthetics of my results which can be seen here (

TLDR
</em>
</strong>
i had srs “Team Surgery” with the suporn clinic on February 1, 2023 performed by Dr. Prae supervised by Dr. Bank. upon returning home i had
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4wJ3448Eia7nEEMh6">unexplained bleeding
</a>
that the Suporn Clinic repeatedly assured me was granulation. the flow of the bleeding was somehow tied to my bowel movements and was accompanied by pain and difficulty during dilation. the bleeding only got
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/T4HkDsYXvxFERid58">worse as time progressed
</a>
. on July 25, 2023 i went to the ER during one of my bleeding episodes where i was
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/EuaWabPMNdJHEi8FA">diagnosed with a partial thickness tear
</a>
of my vaginal mucosa and told that if i continue dilating i could rupture the tear to full thickness. the suporn clinic
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tZPyvCRMvgSPhwQt5">disbelieved this diagnosis
</a>
, continued asserting that the bleeding was granulation, and told me to keep dilating, which i painstakingly did. on August 23, 2023 i got a 2nd opinion from my gyno, who
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/UeMqw6YBaLgvBj9M7">confirmed the tear
</a>
and urged me to stop dilating lest my “bowels fall out onto the floor”. the suporn clinic agreed to let me fly back to Thailand and have Dr. Bank examine me. at the examination, Dr. Bank asserted once again it was not a tear. he said my granulation was so bad he would have to redo the graft for a section of my canal as well as perform “starfish incisions” on my first scar ring to make dilation easier. on September 15, 2023. i had the revision. after the spinal block wore off, i had incredible pelvic pain. in a post-op follow up, i asked Dr. Bank about it and he said it’s sore on the left side because that was the side he did the scar ring incisions on. the pain was, in fact, nerve damage, which became chronic debilitating pain that i still have today. the spikes are still somehow linked to my bowels, which became chronically constipated following my 2nd surgery. the surgery made my bleeding happen much less frequently, but i still have
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/24Rso9fxWw2ci6AK7">random heavy bleeds
</a>
which precede some bowel movements in month 3 of recovery the pain rendered me bed bound only able to leave my bed for brief trips to the bathroom or the kitchen. sitting for more than 20 minutes was almost always out of the question. i went to a local pain clinic to test for pudendal neuralgia among other things. the clinic was completely incompetent and a waste of 3 months of agony for me. i will spare the details of that experience as it’s not relevant to you readers. eventually i got in to see Dr. Skaribas at

in Houston. on June 13, 2024,
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/waTegsmLofVC2aY16">i had a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulator implanted
</a>
which is like a pacemaker but for your spine. it essentially works similar to DDOSing, flooding the nerves with such frequent electrical stimulus that it creates a traffic jam for pain signals trying to be sent to the brain.   i still have some
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8JdZBMwKGpgqjA9K7">bouts of bleeding
</a>
and i have chronic constipation leading to
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/jNaCjTrqKpdk7XqZA">extreme bloating
</a>
despite being on trulance. idk what the underlying problem is or what my next step is medically. i would guess im close to $20k in medical debts across several credit cards and hospital balances. my life is pretty fucked atm. idk why it went wrong or who’s fault caused it. i dont even know if i ever had a tear or if the 2nd surgery was needed. but regardless of the unknowns and
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4yxH8zUft9KQLuNT9">how gaslit i’ve felt about my own body
</a>
, what i do know is that the clinic did not take my concerns seriously. i trusted them, i followed their advice, and in doing so where has it left me? most of my depth gone, in financial ruin, my ability to work taken from me, and in unending pain. i don’t think this will happen to you. i don’t want you to change your scheduled surgery. i think that you will have a wonderful result. but i don’t think the suporn clinic treated me right. and i think you should be careful of how much trust you place in them.

I feel so sorry for you. Suporn&#39;s so overrated in this website because of his aesthetics, but nobody&#39;s ever talked about the real stuff, like we&#39;ve heard from many other surgeons. I remember your older posts though and feel really sorry that this has no end. Hope your body can heal from this, and you, mentally, as well. The clinic need to take responsability and offer you a solution.

I feel like plenty of us talk about the real stuff? It&#39;s just not usually anywhere near as real as what OP went through.
</p>
<p>
Most of us have a difficult period that lasts between 3-12 months post-op and then we move on with our lives. Dilation with Suporn is harder than most. Re-hospitalization in the first month is also semi-common &amp; fully covered by the clinic.
</p>
<p>
We struggle with stuff like motivation to stay consistent &amp; setting up good microflora ummm yeah, occasionally someone has an aesthetic problem or needs clit reconstruction.
</p>
<p>
These pale in comparison to OP&#39;s experience though, obviously.
</p>
<p>
I wish that the clinic would take responsibility and offer a solution to OP. But sadly, I doubt they will. I doubt they would even know what the solution is given how rare this complication is.
</p>
<p>
Plus, there is the cultural norm of saving face in Thailand, which complicates things, despite OP being beyond reasonable in her retelling of her experiences.

By real stuff I meant how they treated her post op. Mostly there&#39;s this romanticization around the clinic in here.

Maybe, I don&#39;t follow this sub too closely.
</p>
<p>
The clinic is amazing with post op care in Thailand. Once you leave though you&#39;re basically on your own, as evidenced by the emails OP posted.
</p>
<p>
Most patients are pretty much set by the time they leave. Obviously, we all hope to be lucky.

I would tend to agree.  Along with some other clinics.  Herd mentality for any clinic is very dangerous for your health.  I&#39;ve posted previously on making the choice of a doctor....Make it very carefully and gather as much information as possible about how your goals match what the surgeon can deliver.  Look hard at their successes and FAILURES!  Ask lots of questions!!  Educate yourself on the various methods to see if the method will also match your needs.  Good luck to everyone!  Hugs, xoxo

I&#39;m so sorry you are suffering with chronic pain. I have similar pain since SRS over two years ago and its gradually draining my will to live but strong pain killers are working to ease it slightly.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really interested in the implant you have had, definitely going to do some research into it.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for the post and wishing you all the good luck for the future.

I am so sorry this happened to you.
</p>
<p>
In my experience the suporn clinic is exceptional for the majority of the patients. But for those unfortunate few patients who fall outside of the normal patient &#34;pipeline&#34;, their care can be quite lacking to be honest.
</p>
<p>
When I was there for revision there was a mental health related incident with one of the patients, and the clinic team did not handle it well at all. They didn&#39;t really know what to do, and in my opinion they didn&#39;t take it seriously enough, and should have definetely tried harder. It was very disappointing.
</p>
<p>
So while the suporn clinic has a really good reputation with many good outcomes, they sure aren&#39;t perfect..

I&#39;m so sorry to hear about all your complications related to SRS. It hasn&#39;t discouraged me from wanting to pursue SRS in future myself, albeit I&#39;ve little to no interest in full depth and have intended from the beginning to go for zero depth. Regardless the results in the photos look amazing. I wish you didn&#39;t have to live with chronic pain because of it. :(

because i was dropping all of my savings on srs, if i had any problems that might arise after i felt like i would be unable to properly solve the issues. when i read the Suporn 2015 SRS pdf what really sold me on the Suporn Clinic was that apparently the Suporn Clinic would be more than happy to fix any issue someone may have. they apparently valued quality work and pride in their craft so much that it seemed to me like free revision(s) would be insurance for any problems that arise. i felt like i was investing in my success. i was so gullible

I&#39;m so sorry this happened. I always thought the same as you, keeping an eye on the clinic for years and years. Every surgeon has complications, and the amount of information one has to go through to truly vet them is absolutely overwhelming. The process of picking a surgeon and weighing method and risk shouldn&#39;t feel like, as in all other things about medical transition, we have to be our own doctor and take on that level of knowledge and risk ourselves. And yet, it still does.
</p>
<p>
The Suporn clinic has so many glowing recommendations for such a long time, I don&#39;t think you had any reason to think it would ever go so wrong. Thank you for sharing, we should all be aware of the risks we face undergoing surgery, especially when it&#39;s at odds with the common perception. I hope you find more relief.

With all due respect, you got lucky like most of us. The reality of this surgery is that nothing is ever guaranteed no matter how good the surgeon is, no matter how experienced (though, admittedly, Prae is/was still new).
</p>
<p>
We all roll the dice &amp; hope we don&#39;t end up in this situation.
</p>
<p>
As far as I can tell, Min Jun&#39;s complication rates are not meaningfully lower than Suporn, sadly. OP&#39;s experiences are exceedingly rare, but they can happen.
</p>
<p>
I think how she expressed herself is incredibly even handed when she says she would roll the dice again &amp; doesn&#39;t want to discourage people from getting SRS even after all she&#39;s been through.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t imagine the level of emotional maturity that takes. I think if I were in her position I&#39;d have nowhere near the level of perspective she has to see outside her own experience while also recounting it.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s so so nonsensical why most of us get a result that means we can move on with our lives after a year or so of hard work, and others wind up saddled with complications like OP.
</p>
<p>
I think when facing a surgery as major as SRS it&#39;s really hard to grapple with that ambiguity—why do some people get lucky while some don&#39;t; how come we can&#39;t do more to control our outcomes—but it&#39;s important that we do so with eyes wide open, anyways.
</p>
<p>
If there is one thing to criticize the clinic for, it&#39;s that their post-op care is poor after patients go home. They just tell you to dilate more. That, and they care a lot about &#34;saving face&#34; if ever a patient becomes a &#34;difficult case&#34;.
</p>
<p>
However, I frankly don&#39;t think US surgeons are much better.

That&#39;s sort of a disingenuous comparison that&#39;s hard to take in good faith tbh.

At the time of OP&#39;s operation Prae had done 2 team surgeries. Bank, on the other hand, has done probably close to 1000 surgeries by this point, most of which were solo, the rest team surgeries with Suporn.
</p>
<p>
To say these two surgeons are &#34;both new&#34; as if those are equivalent is something else. I don&#39;t know many people who would call 1000 surgeries new, but sure I guess.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, leaving that aside...
</p>
<p>
Who do you believe does a better job? I personally feel Bank is a level above every other surgeon in Thailand aside from arguably Theerapong, who I&#39;d consider sort of a different category given the differences in technique.
</p>
<p>
Price is another factor, sure. The price is considerably lower than it would be in the US or EU. And the post-op care received while in Thailand (1-2 months with 24/7 nurses on call and weekly checkups/revisions) simply isn&#39;t done by any other surgeon, anywhere in the world.
</p>
<p>
Personally, price was the least of my concerns. I would&#39;ve paid far more to go to the US if I felt a surgeon there was better. Happy with my choice
</p>
<p>
If there&#39;s a reason to criticize the clinic I&#39;d probably say it&#39;s follow up once people return home. However, you&#39;re not gonna get that from any surgeons in Thailand, really. In the US it&#39;s pretty hot or miss too, or comes with huge fees.

Yes, I am aware of these two details. And overall the complication rates between both surgeons are similar. These are not mutually exclusive statements.

Min Jun has literally done the same thing to multiple patients. My granulation was so bad that I was having dead tissue scraped out in office visits and my canal had to be regrafted. He doesn’t have the training to handle any complications. And no doctor has a more significant history of gaslighting patients (including one he almost killed) than Min Jun. He was fired for a reason.

Dr. Jun was not fired or expelled. He went to open his own clinic and is doing extremely well. As any doctor who is a master at what they do he is just following the path of success.
</p>
<p>
Sadly this ONE girl is obsessed with him and spreads lies and misinformation. And this is the last time I will be saying it because she doesn’t seem to stop. If anything her delusions and lies get even worse with time. Now apparently Dr. Jun almost killed someone ? Lol

I’ve helped a number of girls with bad Dr. Thomas outcomes get revisions with my favorite voice doc Dr. Yung in SF. That doesn’t have a lot to do with Min Jun, completely different fields. I have an ongoing medical board investigation against Dr. Jun and I am not the only one with said process ongoing. We also found multiple HIPAA violations that led to the Feds working with the Crane Center on compliance. It’s complicated, and people can feel however they want about it, but attacks on my mental health are absolute nonsense.

Yes, he basically does not do revisions!  I&#39;ve heard multiple situations by where he has disrespected his patients in addition to not being willing/capable to do revisions!!!

Thank you for the honesty. I&#39;m really sorry to hear about your devastating situation. I hope you heal from it and have a speedy recovery. I haven&#39;t booked yet but I have applied for a date from Dr Bank&#39;s surgery for 2025. If I am successful with the date, I will take your words deep into consideration and take everything they say with a big grain of salt.

the complications aren’t the issue. the medical fucking gaslighting while the patient is in an impossibly worse condition than pre-surgery is. refusing to do fuck all to alleviate the issue before it literally cannot any longer be ignored isn’t medicine.

I&#39;m so sorry you went through this. No pressure here and I&#39;m sorry if it&#39;s out of line - I&#39;m on a medication for nerve damage pain / neuropathy and it&#39;s been life saving (I have fibromyalgia). I know 3 other people who are on it - one has a spinal injury, one has lupus and the other has Cerebral Palsey. It&#39;s called Cymbalta, generic is Duloxetine. It may help??? Nerve pain is hell. I&#39;m so sorry.

I&#39;m so sorry this has happened to you. You deserved so much better. The Suporn Clinic needs to take responsibility for this and give you their undivided attention until they have either fixed the problem or have done all they reasonably could. I wish I could do more than offer well-wishes but I sincerely hope you find a way out of this nightmare.

I will pray that things get better for you soon. I have been downvoted in this sub one too many times for suggesting local surgeons as opposed to finding one overseas. This is the reason why. A good local surgeon is almost always more dependable than an excellent overseas surgeon.

I know.
</p>
<p>
Testosterone has been demonized by transsexuals in the past.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, every body, male and female, needs some testosterone to prevent inflammation, that wounds can heal and so that muscles don&#39;t atrophy.
</p>
<p>
Have you taken cyproterone acetate or another androgen suppressant in the past?
</p>
<p>
How much estradiol are you taking, in what way, how often and, above all, in what form of application?
</p>
<p>
Are you taking progesterone and if so, how?

i have never taken an anti androgen. EV injections have always been enough to suppress my t levels. i take progesterone but inconsistently. i was on dutasteride for 3 years before srs and stopped afterward as my doctor said it wouldn’t be much use post-op. now that i think of it my t levels were too low pre-op so i had some pain when errect. i took testosterone topically on my genitals for 2 years prior to srs. i stopped when post-op

<p>
Hm.
</p>
<p>
It is a pity that endocrinologists confuse DHT and testosterone, so that they are not concerned with the androgen DHT, but with the vital (in terms of general cell building) anabolic testosterone. Endocrinologists consider DHT to be a type of stronger testosterone, but do not realize that they are completely different hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol, which is also converted from it.
</p>
<p>
This leads to testosterone being demonized - because of the androgenic effects of DHT, just as one would want to demonize testosterone for the effects of estradiol.
</p>
<p>
And yes, since DHT (like E2) is converted from testosterone, there is an unfortunate correlation. You can&#39;t increase T in concentration without increasing DHT in concentration, but that&#39;s only half the story.
</p>
<p>
In the low-concentration female range, T is primarily a partial agonist at the androgen receptor.
</p>
<p>
Within certain limits, testosterone therefore has an anti-androgenic effect (counteracting DHT IN THE EFFECT, but this cannot be recognized by the CONCENTRATION (the only thing that is measured)), but is still anabolic in the cells if it is there to
</p>
<p>
occupying the AR and chasing away DHT
</p>
<p>
as an anabolic agent.
</p>
<p>
Conclusion: Outside a certain concentration plateau, the androgenic effects increase.
</p>
<p>
If you increase T, these effects increase.
</p>
<p>
If you lower T, these effects also increase.
</p>
<p>
This optimum must be determined in the course of titration.
</p>
<p>
It is important not to get close to hair follicles when applying the gel, as this is where the 5-alpha reductase lurks for the testosterone molecules.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, applying it palmar (on the palms of the hands and only 1 to 3 small droplets, 4 times a day, to minimize fluctuations) is a tried and tested method.
</p>
<p>
By the way: dutasteride is a classic anti-androgen.
</p>
<p>
I hope that you will be able to solve your problem soon, I am rooting for you.
