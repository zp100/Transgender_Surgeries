FAQs:
</p>
<p>
Procedures done – 455cc breast augmentation
</p>
<p>
Surgeon – Thomas Satterwhite
</p>
<p>
Cost – $1400 with Anthem BlueCross
</p>
<p>
Other surgeons considered - Satterwhite was in-network for me and recommended by my insurance
</p>
<p>
Time on HRT – 9 years
</p>
<p>
Afterthoughts - Dr. Satterwhite did an excellent job, but the Align Surgical staff was not very professional. They lied to me about having booked my surgery date, then made me “reschedule” at the last minute. Also, the hematoma that you see in the pics thankfully drained down my sides as quickly as it formed. It looked scary at first, but wasn’t that bad in the end.

Thanks 😊 Before was 38A, and now is supposed to be a D cup. But everything is still in the process of settling

You look great for a month. Definitely a first seeing all that bruising on the side- can imagine it was very concerning at first. I’m at about two years post op and I feel like the shape is still changing the natural droop/fold. All to say that you will see a dramatic change in the coming months as they continue to settle. 💜

Looks great! How was your pain? Did you need any assistance after the procedure with basic tasks?

Thanks 😊 That’s a great question. The pain wasn’t too bad, but Satterwhite prescribed me some pain meds. Also, I avoided lifting anything so I never really needed any help apart from a friend driving me home after surgery and checking in every couple days.

I had to Privilege to chat with DF and they are So insightful, and just so Beautiful inside and out. The story behind this post and why certain choices were made is so moving and I had never heard such a beautiful reason as this.
</p>
<p>
I tip my digital hat to you.
