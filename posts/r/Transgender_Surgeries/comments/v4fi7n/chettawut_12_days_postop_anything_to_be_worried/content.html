Added context: I have this GI tract issue where I can&#39;t burp (
<a href="/r/noburp">r/noburp
</a>
where y&#39;all at) so I pass extremely large farts and on Day 1 I think I farted so hard that it popped a suture or two. Chet came to check in on me at 8pm and realized I was bleeding way too much so he rushed his team back to put me under so he could re-do some of the sutures on Day 1. There have been no fresh blood issues since then and I think there&#39;s no necrosis but again I have no clue what to look out for so it could have either made the result better or worse and I wouldn&#39;t know. I&#39;d like some community opinions on this.

I mean, just be prepared for a lot of pain. Even at about a month post-op standing for extended periods of time gives me mind-numbing pain to the extent that that&#39;s all I can think about, and this situation is already much better than it used to be in the early stages. Depending on your regime dilation can also be not quite painful, but psychologically taxing - I chose one of the surgeons with one of the more rigorous post-op dilation regimes so it does take a lot out of me on the daily. Just, be prepared to suffer is my advice. I mean, if you&#39;re not, I wouldn&#39;t really recommend SRS.
