The swelling is really hard to deal with and it can last a long time. As others have said it will take at least a year for everything to settle and probably three months before the majority of swelling is gone.Trust your surgeon and the decision you made. Try to eat less salt and rotate acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Gently ice your face on and off. Get lots of sleep, elevate your head if you can. You‚Äôll feel better soon enough and be so happy as the results slowly show.

Yess! Exactly, swelling is really hard to deal with since u can‚Äòt see any improvement and u start to doubt if the surgery really worked :/ so it definitely is also difficult since it‚Äòs not only body pain but hard to cope mentally. Thank you so much for the tips! I will watch my salt intake. Ive been sleeping elevated for the past 4 weeks, I put on this tape thing on my nose cuz it‚Äòs said it should help with the swelling, I do ice my face 1x to 2x a day and it always feels really nice :) I ate a lot of sugar the past 2 days cuz I struggled with my mental wellbeing and then I start binge eating. You gave me hope that it will get better in the future, ty ‚ù§Ô∏è

Awe. Yeah you don‚Äôt even realize how thick the swelling makes the skin on your forehead. So thick. Also realize that the most inflamed parts of your face are going to be where the work was done. I ate a lot of candy when I got a bit depressed during the beginning of my surgery too. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up, but sugar should be avoided. Be kind to yourself you just went through a major surgery, the post surgery depression is real and is in part from the drugs. It‚Äôs so normal. Make sure you‚Äôre going for long walks everyday too to get the blood flowing. Everything is going to be ok! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I really needed to hear this! You‚Äôre so kind. That‚Äòs what my surgeon told me too, that the parts where they worked and shaved off bones are the most swollen. &gt;.&lt; I guess I gotta work on my patience lol. It‚Äôs satisfying to hear it from others too that it is how it is besides my surgeon cuz I tend to not always believe them haha. I‚Äòm sorry to hear you had depression after FFS, too! I just checked out your profile and I gotta say you look fantastic! ‚ù§Ô∏èWhat a huuuge difference. U literally look like a cis woman now. Thanks for the tips- I will try to walk more in nature.

I was going to say you appear to have a ton of swelling.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about it for now.  Just be yourself, live happily and months down the road things should start to normalize.  Hugs you&#39;re beautiful and are going to be fine!

Swelling takes time, I never had full ffs, just a rhino, but even then I was told for all swelling to be gone can take up to two years. After 1 year 90% of swelling is gone, but that last 10% gonna take a while.

I know, my surgeon told me to give it 3-6 months time and still then it can take up to a year or more for everything to settle in completely. Yet i thought I‚Äòd see more of a difference in my forhead area :/ my chin seems swollen too but my forhead bothers me the most. I hope it will get more flat by time? üòë

Oh. Yeah swelling typically rolls down.

<p>
But give it a little more time!

I&#39;m a little late on this, but I will echo the sentiment that other people have:
</p>
<p>
You are fine. You&#39;re healing from major surgery and the swelling isn&#39;t going to settle for a long time. I still have (very slight) swelling at the hairline 8 1/2 months later (I don&#39;t think anyone else can see it, but I can feel an extremely subtle ridge where the forehead transitions to the scalp). This is normal. It will settle.
</p>
<p>
You look good for 4 weeks. It&#39;s just your body is completely out of energy because you&#39;ve been using ALL of it for recovery.
</p>
<p>
Much love.
