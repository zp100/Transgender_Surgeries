My GCS, GRS, SRS or however you want to call it.
</p>
<p>
I got PPV 6 weeks ago and this is how I´m doing so far.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetic is great I have now a big fat pussy or something similar.
</p>
<p>
I`m Still swollen at &#34;labia majora&#34;, it looks like a MC donald´s cheese burger. I still feeling a lot of pain specially at night and an awful tightness in the mornings.
</p>
<p>
Dilation sucks specially in the morning dilation, I can´t get more than 4 1/2 inches deep, and if I push harder my intestines hurt all day and I feel like a stick in my butt.
</p>
<p>
I also can´t walk &#34;normal&#34; yet,  I walk like a dancing horse, it still feels weird down there like something is missing. Peeing is a challenge, sometimes it is like a water fountain, some other times like a big rain and some other it feels like a whistle, but all the time I wet my butt and it sucks.
</p>
<p>
I have bought more toilet paper than in the beginning of the pandemics, I don´t know how to clean my A.. and I always feel I have urine everywhere, I have installed bidets in all my toilets.
</p>
<p>
My Home Gym is now a nursery room, I have installed a massage bed, have hundreds of ointments and antibacterial sprays, and thousands of Lubricating Gels, Pads, Saline Solution for Irrigation, syringes,...... ohh my God.
</p>
<p>
My day is as follows right now, I wake up (probably after a terrible night), I pee, I dilate, I pee, have breakfast and I pee, and then dilation again, and in the meantime I pee 100 times, and then I pee again, dilation, lunch, pee, and dilation and pee again, dilation, pee, dilation pee.
</p>
<p>
Emotionally I´m O.K, I just feel a horrible depression, I feel the ugliest person in the world, I feel like I´m gonna be alone for the rest of my life, I wonder why I had to go through all of this, I challenge God, I get mad at They (God), I cry, I feel handicapped, and then I try to breath and think &#34;this also shall pass and I will be o.k&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Ohh I forgot to mention that I feel like electrical shocks in my VG all day, and when I don´t feel those electrical shocks, I feel itchy, but guess what, you don´t know where to scratch, because there is nothing there (ghost pain).
</p>
<p>
Apart from all this, I´m doing o.k
</p>
<p>
How are you guys doing?
</p>
<p>
Please share your experiences.

A milestone reached, I&#39;m very glad for you, hopefully no complications will bother you, stay healthy and recover.
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s okay and if/when you feel like it, could you please post some post-op pics of your results? I&#39;ve also considered going to Kamol for PPV, but I can&#39;t find any pics to see his results in terms of aesthetics.

A handful, without any reviews, no mentions about post operative care and treatment, etc. That&#39;s not very representative, don&#39;t you think? Not to mention the fact that in the past not once he&#39;s hired people to promote him, which looks quite questionable.

Hi, will you post pictures after you&#39;ve healed more? I&#39;m asking because I&#39;m considering getting a revision with him, and any pictures would greatly help. Thanks!

Hello! I am having my PPV with Kamol in mid-July. May I ask some questions? I can&#39;t seem to find the answer anywhere.
<br>
1. Did you stay at K Garden (The Kamol hotel)? How is the wifi there? I am planning to watch a lot of Netflix during my recovery.  I am thinking of getting a local sim card if the wifi is terrible there.
<br>
2. I understand that some people have to rely on K Garden room service for their lunch and dinner. How expensive are they?
<br>
3. I can see there are one or two shopping malls/supermarkets near the Kamol hospital.
<br>
4. How long after the surgery do you think you are well enough to go there shopping and then walk back to the hotel?
<br>
5. Laundry service? It&#39;s not mentioned anywhere on the K Garden website.
<br>
As you can see, I am a bit nervous about everything!
<br>
Thank you for your time reading this!

a) Yes I stayed there, its very good but wifi is not very “reliable”, b) you get breakfast (is included) you can order food using the “grab” app, also there is a good pizza place across the street and some other few good restaurants around like a sushi place, korean bbq and an american style restaurant. Also near Kamol there is a small shopping center with McDonalds , KFC and other thai food restaurants which are good. Also a couple of supermarkets. c) I was walking like 3 or 4 days after my second surgery (got ffs 10 days after PPV), is really warm and you shouldn’t walk too much as you get pain and swollen, but is ok to walk a few blocks. 4) you have a washing machine and dryer at KGarden, the maids can do laundry for you for a tip. Don’t worry, message me if you have any doubts.

Will the depth become longer or are you stuck with that depth ? Also what kind of scars does the PPV leaves in the stomach area.  And congrats

I had PPV recently. You have four small scars on your tunny about 1cm long, they fade. Also I&#39;m not sure PPV is all it&#39;s made out to be. Seems a lot of people end up with about four inches depth.
