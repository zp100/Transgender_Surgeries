At my consult with Heidi Wittenberg she mentioned that she&#39;d never had a patient who couldn&#39;t orgasm a year out from surgery

That&#39;s slightly better than what I was told. I was told only 1 out of 500 patients from their practice were unable to have a clitoral orgasm a year after surgery (which is what I asked about -- clitoral sensitivity). That one person might have been able to achieve a prostate orgasm or something.

Thank gawd, I was with wittenberg 4 months ago, PPT vaginoplasty. I think I just need a ton of granulation tissue around my clit removed, feel very sensate, but have yet to have an orgasm. BTW I am late to my 3 month postop, lol, have been low on funds and have yet to fly back out there. I was maybe going to do something with a instate gynecologist or PCP or nurse from other local SRS surgeon (phone call with my surgeon, provide instructions to provider), but that seemed to difficult. Just gonna fly in fly out asap instead.

I&#39;d go to your original surgeon for granulation around the clit. Its risky removing it.

I had surgery with her last September, though mine included included a vaginoplasty. I can orgasm just fine. Did some gentle experimentation at 4 weeks and found it worked. It&#39;s gotten better since, with better orgasms than before surgery but it takes longer to get there and I have to be in the mood.
</p>
<p>
My notes from the consultation say that she told me that loss of sensation to the clitoris is a risk but that it&#39;s very low. And the post-consultation letter put the risk of inability to orgasm at 15%.
</p>
<p>
My surgery isn&#39;t quite the same as yours, but I suspect if you can orgasm now and you&#39;re not very unlucky to lose sensation, the chances are you&#39;ll be able to orgasm, but it might take a while to figure out how. Posts here often talk about it taking months before it works.

It’s not common in general, but as with many things its dependant on the skill of the surgeon. There no point in comparing to other surgeons and it would worry me if a surgeon said it’s common.
</p>
<p>
For what it’s worth, she’s a well known surgeon in the uk.

There’s plenty of other bad things that can happen so I’d be looking into those as well.

I don’t want to worry you but I read someone the other day in
<a href="/r/transgenderuk">r/transgenderuk</a>
saying that in previous studies only 75% of bellringer’s post ops could orgasm and only 85% of rashid’s could

<p>
J.Bellringer, &#34;Genital surgery&#34;, pages 209-219 in J.Barrett, &#34;Transsexual and other disorders of gender identity: a practical guide to management&#34;, London, 2007, in the section on clitoroplasty, which focusses on techniques for creating a sensate neo cltoris, on page 214 concludes &#34;only some 75% of patients are able to reach orgasm.&#34; In the concluding section on sexual function, on page 219 he stated - in the context of vaginal sexual stimulation - that &#34;a reasonable estimate is that some 85% of patients are able to attain organsm after the operation&#34;
</p>
<p>
Gradual incremental improvement in surgical techniques over the last 15 years may account for the rise in the proportion of people reporting a sensate neo citoris from Bellringer&#39;s report of 75% in 2007, to Rashid&#39;s report of 85% in 2021.

Just had my first squirting orgasm today, my first orgasm a few weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
But also have talked to a women who can&#39;t orgasm.
</p>
<p>
My surgeons said it has something to do with age. So as older you are the more used you are to your bits and it can get harder to get used to the new ones.

Confused. So... the prostate is connected to the vaginal canal but the squirting orgasm you had was urine or are you saying one needs prostate/skeen&#39;s gland stimulation for squirting either way?

It was just clitoral stimulation and no urine

Prostate is connected to the urethra and it came from there

I believe the AMAB Cowper’s gland is what might cause squirting, since it’s analogous to a AFAB glad I can’t remember the name of that produces squirt.

Did some research, the female one is Skene&#39;s which is actually closer to the prostate, the one you mention has a different female equivalent and they have no known role in sexuality, not surprising due to their tiny size.

It is extremely rare to be unable to orgasm after SRS, IF YOU GO TO AN EXPERIENCED AND SKILLED SURGEON.
</p>
<p>
As recently as 5-10 years ago, there weren’t that many surgeons performing SRS, and the ones that were doing it had many, many years of experience doing the surgery.  Each surgeon had done the surgery hundreds or thousands of times. Trans women would travel internationally to get these surgeries done.
</p>
<p>
Nowadays due to the recent increase in health insurance plans that cover SRS, there are so many new surgeons popping up seemingly out of nowhere to perform these surgeries that all of a sudden everyone can afford to get done. Some of these surgeons have become very good in a very short amount of time, but others not so much.
</p>
<p>
If your surgeon is making you sign a consent form that lack of orgasm is common, or even ‘not uncommon’… personally I would run away. That’s not acceptable.

Alot of insurances will help off set costs if youd like to choose another surgeon. I was offered the option but we both wanted the same doctor  Might be different I&#39;n other countries so dont hold me to it

The prevailing wisdom for this is that if you’re able to orgasm with the old parts, you should expect to be able to orgasm with the new ones.

I orgasmed after a month too, and it didn’t take that long either. It’s honestly so good and I’m so happy.

I&#39;m surprised they used &#34;common&#34;, would have thought &#34;possible&#34; a better choice based on statistics?

Okay, that’s a better phrasing—less negative, I think!

It&#39;s uncommon but it can happen, I assume if the surgeon screws up and damages your nerves or if damage happens due to infection or something during the healing process. I&#39;ve only heard from one person it&#39;s happened to.
<br>
The surgeons I&#39;ve spoken to say that something like 95% can orgasm after, they say it&#39;s better numbers than for cis women, but I&#39;m not cis so can&#39;t attest to that.

It also follows that &#39;Common&#39; is such a subjective word it&#39;s practically meaningless. To a surgeon who has to deal in side effects from surgery - many of which are extremely uncommon and happen to maybe 1 in a thousand, 1 in ten thousand or even 1 in a hundred thousand patients... 1 in 20 would mean it&#39;s an extremely common side effect.

I don&#39;t know much about her results, even if she was one of my shortlist and I know a handful of people who hard surgery with her.  I&#39;d suggest you ask for percentages. Not uncommon has no meaning. Also, they often count at 3 months post op (when you have the last follow up), a lot of people take longer to get there.

Ability to orgasm is often looked at in studies. So you can look at studies generally for vaginoplasty or for the specific surgical technique your considering and get a stat for how often it happens. Maybe there&#39;s even stats for the specific surgeon you&#39;re considering.

I had my consultation with Miss Rashid in early December. She confirmed that the risk of an inability to orgasm was 15%.

What if you can’t orgasm before SRS and before HRT?

I wouldn&#39;t say not being able to retain the function of orgasm is common at all. I was able to reliably orgasm about a month and a half after my surgery and I&#39;m still learning all the new nerves and connections but typically surgical techniques are so well performed now this isn&#39;t really something you have to be too concerned about as long as you&#39;re going to a reputable surgeon.

I think the definition of &#34;male&#34; versus &#34;famale&#34; orgasm can sometimes get a little tricky. I think to often people in these groups attributes orgasms to much a Dualistic sort way. Orgasms are more then just nerve bundles..the have pyscho/social/emotional/spiritual components to them as well.
</p>
<p>
I for one, have been able to cum/organism without gential stimulation and over various parts of my body (and yes I have been able to come from my pinky finger!) and these orgasms are fundamentally different then the orgasms I would get from ejaculating sperm from my penis. This was even starting to happen to be before hrt! In fact they would walk me up in the middle of the night, and they still are! So please people in the group, do not say with what your limited perspective is, what is and not is possible. Be more inclusive!  And leave room for other perspectives and you&#39;all just might learn something new!

Honestly, i was terrified the first few months post-op. I wasnt able to orgasm or pleasure myself in any ways. I cried so much. My surgeron told me he never had a case of a person not able to orgasm so i was like well fuck im the first one! But turns out...it just takes a lot of patience. Ihad my first internal orgasm at 6 month and then my first clitoral orgasm at 10month. It takes time to heal and figure out what good or not. Things will be different for sure but i perfer to orgasm now. I used to doubt post op if the surgery was a good idea...now i can assure you that im really pleased with everything.

I was able to orgasm via &#34;gspot&#34; about 6 months post op And about a year post op via clitoris. I think it had alot to do with nerves repairing and learning myself. I&#39;m not very experimental.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I&#39;m 24 now had surgery when I was 22 with Dr. Brassard in MTL

They have to list all the risks of the surgery before the surgery for legal reasons, so I wouldn’t read to much into it. It does happen but your surgeon should have the bedside manner to assure you everything will be okay. I know for me, I was able to orgasm after 4 weeks. The clitoris was perfectly intact but the labia were super numb.
