Got home from surgery, pain manageable, so far, I&#39;m pretty drugged up. Pain is no joke though. Hour drive home was the worse. Given oxy and Motrin for pain.  Said for constipation from oxy I should do a most liquid diet for 3 days.
</p>
<p>
Even with the pain, first thought when waking up was a happy dance in my head that they are gone.
</p>
<p>
Questions?

Just for know it, hmmm why orchi an not srs? Hmm what happens with the scrotum skin? Does that affect future srs? Does orchi makes tucking easier? Is it so expensive? Sorry many question but I always read about srs an not enough about orchi

I work for myself and for the foreseeable future there is no way I&#39;ll be able to take off 2-3  months off of work. Also if I do get vaginoplasty, it will be minimal depth, although I&#39;m curious about being penetrated, it doesn&#39;t outweigh the longer recovery time for me. I&#39;m not even sure the extra time/pain that it will take to get minimal depth is worth it for me.
</p>
<p>
Unless you want the scrotal skin removed, its kept. There is no effect on having a vaginoplasty as long as you keep it.
</p>
<p>
Advantage of an orchi if you&#39;re on an AA is you can stop taking it (testes produce T). I&#39;m on only estradiol injections and my T is already at 15-20ng/dL, so that didn&#39;t mater to me, although I can probably start taking less E as I don&#39;t have to suppress T now.
</p>
<p>
Yes, testes can get smashed when tucking, so removing them can help keep you from squishing them (there is nothing to squish).  When soft my penis is probably only 2 inches now anyways, it does grow to about 5. So hiding the penis part has been easy already for me. Pretty sure it will be both easy and comfortable once it heals in a couple weeks to tuck (with 2 inches, not like there will be much of anything to tuck now).
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you have any other questions.

You need someone to pick you up, you go under general anesthesia. Also shouldn&#39;t drive for about 10 days. The hour how with my mom driving was bad enough.
</p>
<p>
Surgery was 1 hour, 2 hours pre-op, 2-hours post op.

Congrats, I believe that orchi either alone or as part of srs is the single most useful surgery we can get

Woke up today with super sore breasts, seems a bit coincidental that 2 days after orchi they are sore. Next E shot is tomorrow, so I&#39;m actually even at trough right now.
</p>
<p>
Haven&#39;t found Ibuprofen necessary since last night. Pain is about a 4, I have a high pain threshold, most others probably would be taking something.  Changing gauze as necessary, due to blood spotting, which they say can be a couple of weeks and 2x daily Neosporin. Also today did have a bowel movement, first one since surgery. Up and walking around now and even making food for myself again.

Sure, he is at Kaiser San Jose Urology, Dr. Rosenstein. Answered all my pre- surgery questions to my satisfaction. Even had a second phone call as I was interested in why he does things a certain way. I&#39;m not sure how anyone could do this with local only. Makes me question if these people posting about doing this in office with local only are even real.
</p>
<p>
It was nice that he checked in with me after surgery and called my mom, who was my ride home

Ciaooo yes the orcheotomy does not compromise the possibility of undergoing SRS in the short or medium future, it is the proof that I have done the orcheotomy, on the advice of my gineocologist, to accelerate the female development of my body and above all to eliminate the source the annoying aspects of testosterone production. Calculate that I started my hormonal treatment at 12 years old and, as mentioned above, my gynecologist strongly advised to remove the testicles as soon as possible in order to obtain the best feminizing effect on my body thus avoiding the onset of puberty. obviously male that being a minor it was my mother who signed the consent after asking me if I was sure I would be castrated and seeing that the advantages far outweighed the disadvantages without much doubt I said yes that I was sure and from the moment of the orcheotomy they have passed only two years old and on my 15th birthday last May 2021 I finally got the SRS and my new vagina is perfectly normal and indistinguishable from that of any cis girl a deep enough to accommodate a
</p>
<p>
any penis therefore castration does not compromise the possibility of undergoing SRS and having a perfectly functional and feminine vagina ciaoo

I actually ended up having a good day. My girlfriend came over and spent the day. We talked, watched shows, played games on Nintendo switch. Pain has been very manageable, especially with the distraction of having her here.
</p>
<p>
Taken 3 doses of 800mg ibprofen (one they gave me in pre-op) they sent home with me, said I could take them every 6 hours. The did send me home with oxy and stool softener to take if I took the oxy. As of yet I&#39;ve found no need and will avoid unless absolutely necessary. I&#39;ve been drinking water with electrolytes (pedialyte) to make sure I stay hydrated. I didn&#39;t eat until about 8pm, had some vegan chicken noodle soup, playing it safe. Also the easier that things come out when you go #2, the better as it will push on that area.
</p>
<p>
As for pre-op I got there at 6am. Had to get admitted, waited a bit in the waiting area for them to take to to pre-op room by 6:30. They had a slew of questions during pre-op. I was scheduled to roll into the op room at 7:45. They put the IV in the top of your hand. Gave me an anti-nausea in the IV, it made the groin area tingle/burn for about a minute and dissipated (they warned me). Had me take an 800mg ibprofen, also attached an IV drip of Tylenol codeine. They told me I would have a breathing tube down my throat, while out. Rolled me in sometime between 7:45-8.
</p>
<p>
They had me slide on to the op table. The team of doctors/nurses/anesthesiologist were doing checklists to make sure everything was properly prepped and I was the proper patient. They also asked a co-worker about music. The put the oxygen on me, told me the sleep drugs  were being put in the IV. I joked it was sleep time. About 10-15 seconds and I was out, don&#39;t even remember closing my eyes or like I was getting tired).
</p>
<p>
Woke up in the recovery room at 9:30. I was super foggy and disoriented. Pretty much the first thought was &#34;Yay, they are gone!&#34; and I had heard the song Happy by Pharell Williams the night before, so I was doing a happy dance in my head. I could tell they were gone, the pain was inside, but higher up. Its the pressure type of pain, not the sharp kind, sort of just aches, but really badly. I do have a high pain threshold, I&#39;d give it a 7 probably and its been between 6-8 throughout the day.  Hoping it stays that way tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
They gave me a juice box and gave me more time to not feel so out of it. Was twiddling my thumbs as I didn&#39;t have my phone, probably for 30 minutes. They asked me how I was feeling, said good. So they got my things, the nurse helped me get dressed and get up and into a wheel chair. Rolled me out to my mom picking me up.
</p>
<p>
In total it was about 5 hours. One hour in surgery and 4 in pre/post-op.
