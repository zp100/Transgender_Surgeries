Depth is anywhere from difficult to impossible to regain.  You&#39;ll want to look at sigmoid or ppt revision surgery.

Sigmoid is smelly though or so I&#39;ve heard. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to her.

Itâ€™s only smelly if itâ€™s on the outside I had a girl do her srs with sigmoid colon and she showed it to me and as soon as she took her panties off it smelled nasty like a moucousy thing

You might want to go to other surgeons for them to have a look, give advice and propose revisions. Since Schaff is out of the picture I would suggest you might want to go to people like Dr HeÃŸ in the UK Essen and a few others that I probably don&#39;t know about.
</p>
<p>
Btw afaik in Frankfurt (M) there&#39;s a Dr Sohn who&#39;s abysmal, according to what I hear. What I&#39;m getting at is you should definitely make the same considerations as when actually picking a surgeon the first time.

My trust in surgeons is pretty damaged... I have talked to Schaff years ago and he is very umm... complicated. Maybe I&#39;ll give HeÃŸ a chance....

Schaff socially isn&#39;t the greatest person, true, but he still seems to know what he&#39;s talking about (I&#39;ve made a post on my experience with him). If you can afford the private clinic costs then you could go with him and you&#39;d probably be well treated in a medical sense at least.
</p>
<p>
HeÃŸ on the other hand seems to be quite interested in his patients while having had operated with Schaff and Liedl for quite some time. I sent him an email asking about some basic info on his specific practices and he replied the same day four hours later at 20:30 ðŸ˜™ Here&#39;s his e-mail address, maybe you can detail to him what&#39;s wrong and he might get back to you:

I went to Dr. Sohn but attention: after having done SRS surgeries for about 30 years, Dr. Sohn is partly retired now. Though, he still does surgeries, or he assists, working for the hospital just as a counselor. He is not there everyday. Ms. Dr. Morgenstern has followed him as the hospital&#39;s main SRS surgeon, while also Ms. Dr. Mocka is in the specialized surgeon team. Dr. Morgenstern is on the hospital&#39;s home page! Dr. Morgenstern is building up her reputation. Till now, I heard nothing negative about her and she is a very kind person. No troubles.

Where did you hear that Dr. Sohn is abysimal? I am in the biggest support group here in the region of Frankfurt, with some patients having had their SRS with Dr. Sohn and I did not hear one single negative thing. He does only the PI-method, ok, but it&#39;s no reason to attack him, as he has done about 30 years of surgeries + over 600 surgeries. The PI-method is still the least risky method, often without ANY (!) complication.. while another guy, very active on Reddit, has now been the 4th or 5th week in hospital, while going to one of the TOP 3 german surgeons. He didn&#39;t have the PI-method!
</p>
<p>
40% of the posts I read online are not reliable sources or trusted information! It&#39;s often an ill mind writing too much, being too sensible, asking to much but giving nothing. I see this so many times here on Reddit, how drama-queen like some ..people can be: &#34;oh, no, what is he asking me!? (it&#39;s his job! he is a psychologist) -  &#34;ooh no, where can I find the Inet-link&#34; (instead of using Google ONCE in their life... Loool..) Then.., they come here and they don&#39;t even know the different SRS OP-techniques but want to know all about how to get their next appointment at the best place and how to get it paid, etc..  I even had one asking me, why penile inversion is less risky - OMG omg OMG - so difficult!
</p>
<p>
I mean, if I were a Doctor, I wouldn&#39;t like to have so many troublesome customers, who over-react on so many little things, that it&#39;s practically impossible not to have problems, or negative reviews, with them because of their mental health or err &#34;style&#34;. Better be more laid-back, smove, relaxed, that is the way to go - not the drama queen. Doctors have no time, every single word they tell you is important - or you write it up - They will not take your hand and repeat the advises. And, most important, ask a Dr. the right questions! I am just switching the perspective, as also the surgeon is a human being! ;-) Of course, there are not only good doctors - but most will do their duty.
</p>
<p>
*Drama queens are often those, who undergo one surgery after the other and will never be happy. Later on, their follow-up surgeries make them dependent. I also see similar behavior when it comes to hormones, some sound even as a bunch of Trump-voters - &#34;oh no - you can take as much as you want! This type of hormones is innocuous, there is no limit!&#34; ;-) Such BS, sorry! Bubble-science, like that table that says that 2 types of hormones are &#34;as good as risk-free&#34; - no side effects! ;-)

Really sad to hear this. Unfortunately dilation instructions are indeed necessary and I turned to other trans women and the internet to get all the info I needed. I donâ€™t get why surgeons are actually doing good work and then leave a patient with little to no advice on aftercare :(

Yes but it is not really helpfull. In Germany Doctors are not allowed to advertise for themself. But here you go: &#34;UKE - Physician - Silke Riechardt&#34;
