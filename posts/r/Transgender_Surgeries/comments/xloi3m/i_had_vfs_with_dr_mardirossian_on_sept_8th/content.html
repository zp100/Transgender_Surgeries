I had vfs with Dr. Mardirossian on Sept 8th. Yesterday was the first time I could talk and I’m still healing , super hoarse but I can already tell I made the right decision! It’s like night and day already and I can’t wait to see how it sounds as I continue to heals!

I asked about when I need to get the stitches taken out and he told me, never they are the same kind used in heart surgery. I’m guessing that over time it fused together. I’ll have to ask on follow up. I will post before and after results on
<a href="/r/transvoice">r/transvoice

when everything sounds normal.

These are
<a href="https://www.palmbeachplastics.com/voice-feminization-surgery-west-palm-beach/" rel="nofollow">permanent sutures
</a>
.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
WHY ARE PERMANENT SUTURES USED AS OPPOSED TO ABSORBABLE ONES? After the procedure, the brain has to get used to the new length and tension at which the vocal folds have to operate. This process of “resetting the system” takes up to six months and is the main source for a hoarse voice after the initial swelling and inflammation of the voice box have resolved. To understand this process, just think about trying to drive your car by pressing the pedals with your left foot instead of the right one. Not having the fine motor skills, your left foot will be pressing on the pedals way too abruptly to allow a smooth ride. During the process of motor reconditioning of the brain, the permanent sutures allow for a firmer union between the vocal folds and a better chance for success of the operation. Temporary sutures may absorb prior to the completion of the motor adjustments and therefore compromise the result of the procedure. Permanent sutures will also cause some thinning of the vocal folds in the long run, with an additional increase in voice pitch months and even years after the procedure.
</p>

How did you find out any information about this? When I search he still only comes up at the Jupiter, FL practice. I’m literally like 20 minutes from Arlington and the procedure he uses is my dream procedure.

I had both surgeries done in Virginia, if you look at his posts he now states Arlington Va. he is very personable and talked to me extensively. If you want it done in Va even if he decides to stay in Fla, he will do it there I know for a fact.

couple questions -
</p>
<p>
Were you able to get this covered by insurance in any way/shape/form?
</p>
<p>
What was your out of pocket cost if you did not have it covered?

My work payed for it 100 percent. I work for Starbucks, but they are changing the way they do things. You could still get this covered but you would have to come up with the full max outta pocket for your plan you choose and also your full deductible first then it would be all covered

Basically I couldn’t talk at all for two weeks, not much pain. Like a mild sore throat for about 3-4 day that’s all. Then for the next week I can only talk 20 mins every hour, then after 21 days I can talk normally but no shouting or any super voice abuse for a few months. Absolute no smoking at all for Atleast 3 months or you’ll end up sounding like a 70 yr old that has smoked a carton of cigarettes a day for their whole life. That’s about it.

I’m guessing beca he does so many that he knows what he is talking about by this point. From now till next Thursday I can only talk twenty mins a hour but I’m trying to baby it. He uses a new method that uses three sutures so that could be part of the reason. He also did my ffs and I’m extremely happy with that. He’s one of the best and only works things from the neck up. He is double board certified and I trust him 💯

I’m honestly not sure but he told me that his results have been better with three sutures instead of two, from another post on here I read he used to use a surgical glue but can’t confirm. All I know is he has done hundreds of vfs surgeries and he did exactly what I asked him to do on my face and let him have free reign. I told him” I want to still look like me but look like testosterone never touched me and be as beautiful as possible. He did exactly what I wanted so no doubts on this either. There are a lot of voice feminization results on his website and ffs also if you wanna take a look or a listen. I was thoroughly impressed and went with him because I wanted a natural beauty look, not a plastic look. He hit the nail on the head and I’m only alittle over three months out and still some swelling esp in my chin and nose but I know it will get there! I work at a job where they payed for anyone I wanted to go to, and he was the best choice for me.

Different surgeons have different experiences and thus make different arbitrary rules - at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen
