A week passed by already since last journal entry, thankfully everything has been going smoothly.

On Saturday the Dr. came by and instructed me to start walking, little by little, first sitting in bed, then standing and finally walking around the hospital room, this should be done a few times during the day and then try to take a shower. Getting off bed after 5 days was awesome, I got a little bit dizzy but it was manageable, I did some slow walks, and it was good. At night I took a shower by then I was a little bit tired already however it felt really nice to take a shower and feel clean.

Sunday morning the Dr. came by and he told me that I would be discharged from hospital after the packing and Foley catheter removal, at last!! I&#39;ve read a lot of experiences here about the vaginal packing removal feeling weird, but I didn&#39;t feel anything at all, lol, the Dr. told me that he would be cutting some sutures to release the vaginal packing, I felt a pull when he cut those sutures, but that was it, actually I asked him if he was still removing the packing and he told me that it was already removed, lol. Perhaps it was smoother since he uses a condom filled with gauze instead of other Surgeons that use gauze directly. Even if I didn&#39;t feel anything during the removal I had the pressure relief that I read before. The worst part was the Foley Catheter removal, it was like a painful sting on my urethra, thankfully it was only a second and that was it.

After the removal of the vaginal packing and the Foley catheter he instructed me how to dilate, first using my finger with a dab of lube on my vagina so I can sense the area, and after that using the dilator, very slowly and with plenty of lube. First he showed me how to do it and then I did it on my own step by step. Thankfully it didn&#39;t hurt whatsoever and it felt really natural, right now I&#39;m using the SoulSource Purple dilator, the smallest of the 4 set, and I&#39;m getting a depth between the 4th and 5th dots, I think it&#39;s 5 inches or so. After the dilation and ensuring that I was peeing fine I was given the clear and I was good to go back home.

Being back home after a week felt really nice, I missed my bed, the food and a good internet connection (the internet at the hospital sucked big time, lol, I had to use my mobile plan most of the time). The dilations so far have been ok, I mean yes, they are a chore, he instructs you to dilate 4 times a day, 20 minutes for the first 6 weeks; but the good thing is that I don&#39;t have any pain with the dilation is only a little bit uncomfortable, I just watch some videos on YouTube while I dilate and that&#39;s it.

Also I&#39;ve been relatively pain free with only Diclofenac 50mg every 8 hours, I get some random shooting pains now and then, I suppose from nerves reconnecting perhaps? but that&#39;s it.

I had a complication however that started on Monday after being discharged from hospital and it progressed until yesterday (Thursday). The suture points around the perineum and the vaginal canal started to come loose and I started to bleed a little bit more, the real issue was yesterday when the skin from the vaginal canal entrance came loose and I freaked out a little bit, however I tried to remain calm and I poked a little bit and I was able to lower the skin to where it should be and I was able to reach out the vaginal canal. I sent a picture to my Dr. and he quickly replied saying that I shouldn&#39;t panic that it will heal on it&#39;s own. Today thankfully it&#39;s already bleeding less hopefully during next weeks the tissue will heal fine.

The swelling has gone down considerably since I got discharged it&#39;s more evident on my right labia majora, but the inflammation in all the area is going down pretty quickly. Stamina wise I&#39;m doing great, from reading many experiences I thought that I would be pretty exhausted but it has not been the case with me, I already went out for some walks around the neighborhood without any issues, and my pace is almost normal.

Today I had my first revision with the Surgeon and he told me that everything is looking good, to expect the swelling to come down more during the next weeks. Also I should start with the next dilator size in a week, that most probably it won&#39;t fit in a day but I have to keep working on it until it does.

Thank you!! üòä Yes, it&#39;s only week 2. Tomorrow is going to be 14 days since surgery. The swelling of the labia has gone down a lot but it still has a long way to go. Wish you the best on your revision surgery!! ‚ù§‚ù§
