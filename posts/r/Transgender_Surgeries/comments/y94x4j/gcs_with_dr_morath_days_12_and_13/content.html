Hi lovelies! And despite the slight delay, here comes what is now my last hospital update, as I was discharged last Tuesday, or day 13. I want to continue updating you on my progress and results, but things have calmed down and it doesn’t make much sense to do it so frequently now. I still need to think about frequency and format, but you’ll hear from me some time in the coming couple of weeks! I also want to write a sort of conclusive post with my thoughts and conclusions about this experience and my results, but that will wait a bit more as things settle down. Now, for the last two hospital days…
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 12
</em>
Today is my last full days in the hospital and I went in for a final revision before being discharged. The usual doctor checked everything and it continues to look good at this stage. My labia minora are quite swollen but slowly going down (they told me it could take several months). I also had my depth measured (this time I remembered to ask! It’s 12,5 cm) and a picture taken, which they will keep as a reference to have something to compare when I come back for a follow up consultation with Dr. Morath in 6-8 weeks time. They also tell me that it’s for now unclear whether I’ll need a second surgery, which well, it isn’t a no but at least it isn’t a yes! I’m also expected, said the doctor, to have quite a bit of lubrication given the state and current function of the mucous tissue used as part of the graft.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the day advanced as usual. Dilations are not the most comfortable but at least they aren’t painful (except a really specific point in my vagina, although it quickly disappears as the dilator goes through it. I’m told it’s one of the muscles of the area, which I believe because whether there’s this momentary pain depends on how I position my right leg - gotta experiment). I also get to depth quite easily, in under a minute or two, and “leak” a lot less now that I need to wear a placeholder in between dilations, as it tends to catch most of the discharge and stick to it (it can be quite of a mess taking it out, though!).
</p>
<p>
This was also my first day without compressive tights and without any painkillers, not noting much of a difference between taking them or not. Maybe I got used to it, but pain was 0-1/10 today, and most of the time I only had a sort of diffuse pressure in the area, mostly around the entrance of the vagina. Otherwise, all looks good and continues healing.  Also, last heparin shot! They usually are quite quick and painless, but the new nurse rotation that came in in the last couple of days may or may not have as much practise and they’re now more painful.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 13
</em>
And so today is my last day in the hospital. Not much happened apart from my dilations, a nice shower and packing. The doctor came into my room in the morning to check whether I had any last minute questions (and indeed I had some, regarding how long I need to be wearing bandages in my introitus and between my labia minora, as well as a thorough cleaning with antiseptic every time after using the toilet, which now I know I only have to do for two more weeks). I was then handed my discharge report and was told I could leave any time I’d like during the day. They also gave me some painkillers for the way home, which I took later as there was quite a bit of sitting involved.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, the day went by until I finally left with my partner to catch a flight back home. I had some mixed feelings between the pretty real wish to be back home, the nervousness about a long trip not even two weeks out of surgery, and the leaving the hospital and this life-changing experience behind of me. The trip was quite weary but I wasn’t excessively uncomfortable at any point (possibly thanks to the painkillers I was given, pain was kept between 1-3/10 throughout the trip, given the walking, sitting and waits involved). I got home, did my dilations and finally slept in my own bed. It’s great to be back a completely new and a happier me.
