My surgical team give you two as standard practice and ask you to work up the scale. They said I could skip the small orange one though because apparently there was &#39;significant donor material&#39;, to use their words lmao.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I need to get myself the green one soon, just need to wait until payday first. I went with Dr. Tina Rashid in London btw

That&#39;s odd. They gave me the full set. Never used the violet one, used blue for a couple weeks, green for about 3 weeks, and then mostly on orange now. Sizing up is something you can do at any time but not giving it to you is just silly.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
To be clear, mine from smallest to largest are violet, blue, green, orange where orange is 1.5&#34; in diameter.

Interesting. You&#39;re not the first person to say that about Parkside. They have recently changed ownership, so maybe it&#39;s something to do with that? It&#39;s not the end of the world though, I&#39;m happy to just buy the green one when I get paid.

When I had mine they provided two, but which two varied. My surgery was a bit unusual and I had a fragile graft so they gave me small orange P2 and purple #1. Bought blue, green and orange myself after I was given the ok to size up at 2Â½ months.

Makes sense. Someone I know had a similar technique done for her.

Hey Leah, can I just suggest you order the smaller soulsource ones?
</p>
<p>
I do a lot of post op care for other trans women, and I see a lot of wound seperation and stitch popping when women are given just the largest two.
</p>
<p>
Could be a coincidence, or just my experience, but.
</p>
<p>
I was given 4 dilators and never had an issue.

They havenâ€™t given me the largest ones, I have the mid sized ones that were given to me by my surgeon. If anything, I need to go up to the green one now because itâ€™s been 5 months since I had surgery. Iâ€™m all good down there, no open wounds or anything ðŸ˜Š

Oh, interesting. Is the second purple smaller than the other as well? I only got the set of four dilators from my surgeon.
