Thank you for the reply. Do you think that if it is granuloma, is it gonna heal by itself?

My surgeon is not in the country I live. And he does not want me to go other surgeons to do a silver nitrate. He also does not recommend me anything he said ok by looking this photo ( communication via e mail) . It is on the very outside, I think my clitoris way below than there, it is hooded.

I came across this post a few months ago about a much easier alternative to silver nitrate. If you and your surgeon think it could be granulation this could be an easier fix that you can do at home.  I haven&#39;t tried it (I&#39;m pre-op) but it could be worth mentioning!

iâ€™m not joking: poppers while dilating + medihoney on granulating wound after
</p>
<p>
iâ€™m serious - nitric oxide (NO) signaling activates wound healing processes such as prostaglandin E2 synthesis (which is inhibited by ibuprofen)
</p>
<p>
btw the OP does not seem to have a visible granuloma? thatâ€™s just re-epithelializing skin with a very mild granulation, if at all. treat super conservatively. most granulating tissue is healthy and part of the wound healing process, and builds a rich network of capillaries to nourish re-epithelializing keratinocytes
</p>
<p>
overgranulation is much more obvious and dramatic

I am not a doctor!
</p>
<p>
Looks good to me, and for 6 weeks you look to be healing well. The upper mark that you have circled looks like minor granulation? Lower one could be hiding a stitch. What does your surgeon say? Granulation is effectively treated with Silver Nitrate stick (by a doctor or your surgeon), however it does often heal on its own especially if its minor as yours appears to be.
</p>
<p>
I would try some medical grade honey spread on a folded gauze (fold several times, spread the honey on the crease). If you are anything like me then your outer labia will hold this in place - so just do this overnight for a week or so, replacing nightly.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, a steroid cream such as betnovate ointment might help, but speak to your surgeon!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and relax, you look good to me from this photo and you are likely getting yourself in a state for no reason!
</p>
<p>
And.... Congratulations!!

i just use sterile Q tips (super cheap on amazon) to apply medihoney directly to the wound, thereâ€™s no need for a secondary dressing. it dries rapidly on the wound bed forming a semi-permeable barrier blocking bacteria but allowing osmosis of wound exudate

Excellent! only other thing to suggest is make sure it gets plenty of air (sleep in the buff!), and keep it as dry as you can - eg air-dry it legs splayed!!

Looks amazing for six weeks! If it&#39;s a suture, they will absorb or &#34;show&#34;, emerging from the skin and can easily and painlessly be removed with tweezers.  Beautiful work!

does it hurt? do you shower or wipe after you dilate? thereâ€™s lots of sloughy lube (?) or discharge in this photo. the lower circle just looks like old lube mixed with very early slough that needs to be washed off on top of what could be a mild ingrown hair. re: upper circle / labia minora - looks like a spot where urine likes to track after exiting the urethra. just wash with soap and water once or twice a day (baby wipes other times) and maybe put some medihoney on it if itâ€™s tender. you donâ€™t have hair in the canal, right? it looks like a very good result. i wouldnâ€™t be worried. just wash externally with soap, douche with vinegar and keep the area clean.

It is not go off with wiping, I did not try  harder to it harder though. It is not relatively painful, but when I press it with finger, little pain I feel. I hope it goes by itself because I sent my surgeon this photo and he said it is all ok. My surgeon does not suggest me douche :( so I have never did douche.

<p>
is your surgeon in Europe?
</p>
<p>
my surgical team is from NYU (Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Lee Zhao) and their patients douche with vinegar (initially saline) to help wash out slough and fight ammonia from traces of urine breaking down in the canal, and bias the flora towards less pathological species.
</p>
<p>
when iâ€™m fully healed at some point iâ€™m going to transition to probiotics but thatâ€™s like months from now
</p>
<p>
ofc try your best to follow your surgeonsâ€™ advice
</p>
<p>
anyway a lot of it looks like regular wound healing. youâ€™re healing really well!
