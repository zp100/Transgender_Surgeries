How was the recovery and pain? E.g., right after, a week later, 2 weeks later?

The surgery is outpatient but the recovery has been a breeze. No lie or sugar coating. I had no pain either. I took a few Tylenol &amp; that was it. All I experienced after was being tired &amp; some mild swelling. I was in good hands with a top notch surgeon &amp; luck was on my side. But it‚Äôs really a simple surgery &amp; low risk.

I had mine last Friday, have you been able to tuck yet? Has the swelling gone away completely yet? I&#39;d like to know when I can expect to feel better.

First off congrats! This surgery is so affirming &amp; worth it. &amp; tmi but I don‚Äôt tuck so can‚Äôt answer sorry. My swelling is almost all gone. After the two week mark it started going down. I was lucky &amp; felt great the whole time during recovery. No pain, bleeding, or bruising. Up &amp; walking &amp; showering with caution but it was easy. Like I said all I experienced was a zap of energy- tired &amp; mild swelling. Hope you feel better soonüòä

Yeah, I guess there wont be much for me to tuck as well. So that&#39;ll be a thing of the past. The reality that they are gone hasn&#39;t sunk in yet. Looking forward to the two week mark. Once the swelling goes down things are going to hit me. Can&#39;t wait.

Hi Michelle!
</p>
<p>
I had my orchi on Feb 13 (so I am about two weeks). After orchi, you no longer have to tuck. Your equipment just slides up inside you and you get a completely flat front.
</p>
<p>
My swelling is mostly gone. :) Hang in there! It gets better quickly.

I read somewhere that some surgeons prefer you to skip orchie if you&#39;re going to do a vaginoplasty. Something about needing more tissue? Is that the case?

Yes, it is true. Although you can avoid that worry by telling your surgeon you plan on GRS/SRS (vaginoplasty) they will save scrotal skin during an orchiectomy. I‚Äôm not going that route so I didn‚Äôt care. But good questionüòâ

Hello! Thanks for your wonderful comment &amp; support. First off congrats on your transition journey. Heading towards an orchiectomy is very exciting. From one trans girl to another I promise it‚Äôs simple &amp; worth it. It‚Äôs been found to be very affirming &amp; make a trans girl happier &amp; healthier. No more t blockers does wonders. It‚Äôs an ideal option for us girl who are non op or who plan on full vaginoplasty but need a stepping stone.
</p>
<p>
Now to your questions. First off doubt is apart of life &amp; is very normal. Please know there‚Äôs no right or wrong way to transition or be a girl. If you have a day where you don‚Äôt feel like full girl mode that‚Äôs fine. Take a break. You‚Äôre still valid. I‚Äôm clearly a trans girl &amp; I have days where I don‚Äôt feel like wearing makeup or painting my nails etc. it doesn‚Äôt define me. I‚Äôm still trans &amp; myself. There‚Äôs also cis girls who you see like on weekends who look ‚Äúbare‚Äù hoodies, no makeup etc. don‚Äôt worry about your social role so much. &amp; I‚Äôll assume you have some advantages of passing since you started very young. Just be yourself &amp; follow your own heart. Don‚Äôt compare yourself to others &amp; live day by day based on how you feelüòä it sounds like you‚Äôve come far &amp; made the right decision

Where was you incision? I‚Äôm looking for inguinal, but I‚Äôm and starting to think it‚Äôs not that common.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm seeing a urologist in two weeks about it. Either way I‚Äôm so excited to get them excised.

It was a midline scrotal incision. I think for most trans girls who pursue this surgery almost always chose a simple bilateral orchiectomy. It‚Äôs easy, cheap, outpatient with lots of benefits. I‚Äôm in no position to tell you what method to do. But yeah inguinal I‚Äôve heard is more painful &amp; time consuming. Good luck! I‚Äôm so happy with my surgery outcome &amp; feel more affirmed

Unless you signed an agreement not then you can. I‚Äôll add this post to the wiki.
</p>
<p>
A few more questions
</p>
<ul>
<li>
how long was the wait list?
</li>
<li>
what did it cost?
</li>
<li>
did you need a psych letter?
</li>
<li>
would you reccomend your surgeon to others?
</li>
</ul>

Nope I signed nothingüòä  -there was no so called waitlist for my surgeon. I had my pre op appointment in November 2019 &amp; surgery in February 2020. So only 2/3 months by time I met her &amp; was on the operating table.  -it costs $2,000-$3,000 on average. Mine was $3k. Factor in possible health insurance coverage but if not that‚Äôs how much money it costs on average.  -yes,I needed two referral letters from a therapist, psychologist, or dr. &amp; 12 months on hormones.  - omg yes! My surgeon was so nice, loving, supportive, kind, respectful, &amp; skilled. She‚Äôs super smart too. Good bedside manor &amp; really listens to you. She‚Äôs not there just punching a time clock or collecting the big bucks. I can tell she truly cares. Plus she is an advocate for the transgender community &amp; created an lgbt healthcare program at Cleveland clinic. I highly recommend her to anyone. She does a variety of mtf &amp; ftm surgeries.

My swelling was very very mild. More just a puffy skin look. I had literally NO (zero) pain or discomfort. But I was tired &amp; sluggish for several days. I‚Äôm so sorry to hear of your recovery &amp; severe swelling with bruising. I‚Äôd call your doctor? It‚Äôs suppose to swell but yikes...to the size of a grapefruit sounds concerning. The lump inside could be swelling of the spermatic cords that got cut off when the testicles got removed. Hope the rest of your recovery will be okay
