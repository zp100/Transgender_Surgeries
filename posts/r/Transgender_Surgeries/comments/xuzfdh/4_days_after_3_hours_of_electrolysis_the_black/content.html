4 days after 3 hours of electrolysis, the black dots fell off but they dots look more intense this time around. it was very painful and she walked away to talk to someone and left them in for a few of them. I&#39;ve been using Neosporin scar cream. Are these normal results? Never been cleared before.

I&#39;m not an electrolysist but I do have dark skin and had it done at 1 hour intervals for every session. Even among darker skin, people heal differently. If you&#39;ve done this before and it didn&#39;t scar or leave any pits - then it should be fine.
</p>
<p>
However, this looks like she went way too high of a setting and/or too much time in one place. Mine didn&#39;t scab that badly, just made the whole area that&#39;s treated become swollen for a day and pin sized small scabs for another day or two. If this is not your normal healing process, I&#39;d recommend talking to a dermatologist asap.

I am an electrologist and also trans and have had my face cleared many times. Here are my thoughts: 1) This looks like really bad over treatment, she probably had the machine set too high and for too long.  2) I would never recommend galvanic or blend on the face. It is best used for deeper hair like underarms or groin. Galvanic electrolysis produces lye that destroys the hair follicle and on shallow hair, like on the face, you risk burning the skin surface with the lye. 3) I would recommend doing thermolysis electrolysis as it is a lot quicker with similar results to galvanic and blend methods. Instead of having to leave the probe in for 10+ seconds required to produce the lye it is instant. Thermolysis also uses alternating current which produces heat at the tip of the probe so you don’t have electricity running through your body which can affect things like pacemakers, metal implants, or a host of other medical issues. Also most electrolysis providers only do thermolysis now as galvanic electrolysis was invented in the late 1800’s and technology has advanced way more since then.
</p>
<p>
I hope your face heals up and I am sorry this happened. I recommend you finding another electrolysis provider that does thermolysis if you can. If you can’t then sit down with her and let her know what happened and to reduce the time and intensity of her machine. I hope this helps

I&#39;ve had electrolysis for a year and never ever had that reaction. My longest session was probably 2 hours, but usually they were only an hour. It could be so many things. If you can find another inesthetician, I would at least get a professional opinion.
</p>
<p>
Also, laser works and is WAY faster. You just have to find someone with a Yag laser and who knows how to treat darker skin.

FDA says Laser is good for hair REDUCTION and cannot advertise removal.  Only electrolysis can REMOVE hair.

Yes. That&#39;s why you reduce with laser first, then finish the follicles off with electrolysis. Just laser won&#39;t be permanent, and just electrolysis will literally take for ever if you have any average amount of facial hair.  I personally have been through this process. A year of electrolysis worked, but only a small area was covered in that time.  Now that I switched to laser, I&#39;m seeing MUCH QUICKER results. Once we get to the point where the laser isn&#39;t working, we&#39;ll go back to electrolysis and that should be it 😊😊

Really? I always heard that lazer pretty much stops working once you get to a certain point because theres no way to properly direct the energy at the hair follicles rather than your skin

This doesn&#39;t look right. It seems that she burned your skin on the surface , didn&#39;t go all the way to the root.

I understand that there is no heat . What I meant is burned by electricity . Sorry English is not my native language. And those dots from the needle most likely gonna live scars.

<p>
When you do electro it might cause your skin to be swollen but  there should be no holes in it

So this is my 3rd and longest session of electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
My doctor won&#39;t recommend me anything silicone until my appointment weeks from now
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m most concerned for the seemingly gashes.. 1 upper lip.. 1 chin...
</p>
<p>
Will this fully heal???
</p>
<p>
Am I overreacting??
</p>
<p>
It took 6 days for everything to clear last time.. but I am doubtful it will happen like that this time.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never had a clearing, btw

It will heal to some degree yes.  Hopefully lots.  But I mean the skin is not supposed to get this damaged from Electrolysis.  Something definitely wasn&#39;t right, and your skin ended up getting more banged up than it should have.  Huge hugs.  I would send pictures, to that office and I would NOT go back to them.

Editing this because I just saw that this is multineedle work.
</p>
<p>
In my experience, multineedle operators use way too much lye, resulting in scabbing and eventual hypopigmented (white) scars. I have a bunch of these on my own face, years later. You wouldn&#39;t happen to be seeing someone in Los Angeles, would you? This kind of work is distressingly common around here. The one electrologist leaving to talk to another, and the three-hour session is very very familiar.

This is NOT normal. Please don’t go back. I’ve been doing electrolysis an hour and a half per week for 3 months and have never had anything like this. My skin is red and a little bumpy after the session but after a couple hours the redness disappears and the skin returns to normal. Electrolysis is not supposed to leave scars like that. Please find someone who’s better!

Hi. I’ve been to several electrologists as I looked for the ones closest to me. Your tech is using way to high a setting and that can result in scarring. If it was me, I would ask her(tell her) to reduce the setting. I still have scarring from a tech who refused because “then it won’t work” but the fact is, the hair growing cell area is tiny. You do not need to obliterate the skin around it IF the needle is placed carefully. I think techs favour higher setting in the name of speed, because using a lower setting means that follicle may need to be treated several times, and the needle must be placed correctly which slows them down. Chin hair and upper lip hair seems the most tenacious. It’s deeply rooted and difficult to kill.

I never had electrolysis. But I’d recommend laser hair removal. See if Milan laser hair removal facility is near you. They offer lifetime on the areas you buy and only takes 5-10 min a session with no scars.

I just had a 7 hour full clear at Electrology 3000. For those that don&#39;t know their method is to do full clears in one/two days. They do a lot of lidocaine injections to control  the pain.
</p>
<p>
My point however is that even with 2 techs working all day to remove EVERYTHING I walked away with slighly swollen face and very few areas of pin point bleeding that had closed up by the time I left the session....nothing like this.
</p>
<p>
I have used a different electrolysis place in the past and I had this, blistering, happen when they were too high on their settings or zapped the same area too much (common around mouth/nose area due to higher density of follicles in the area). The tech should be moving  to a different area if this amount of irritation  is seen during a session.
</p>
<p>
Also for what its worth. The follow-up instructions from Electrology 3K specifically states NOT to use Neosporin on anything. Just let the skin heal naturally. (However they didnt send me out the door like this either).  They do provide all their patients with a tube of zinc oxide cream, 20% and an ice pack to counter any swelling. The zinc oxide isn&#39;t just to protect the face from Suns UV., zinc is very beneficial  for promoting skin healing and moisturizing...it helped more than I assumed it would
</p>
<p>
Be careful with any repeats of this or you may end up with permanent scarring
</p>
<p>
Hope this info helps some how. Take care.

Direct words of an electrolysis instructor: &#34;Either too shallow and or too much current.

Do not go back there--bad treatment.&#34;

I recommend you get a lawyer asap and sue them. If they did it correctly, there should be reddness and no scars. This is absolutely far from normal.

When Electrologist work with dark skin ( black, brown, light brown), always have a risk with hyperpigmentation. If Electrologist enough skills, they will make a few “setting test “. How is working on skin plus tolerance. Only after they can work with client skin without risk to damage. Also. If you feeling how Electrologist insert probe (pain), they just out from follicle. If inserting to deep - again painful, they again inserted incorrectly. If they already inserted and settings to high, strong for your skin and you “feel or hear “ like “sizzle”. They burned your skin….. Hard to find good Electrologist….

That&#39;s not normal (I&#39;ve had 30 hours of electrolysis), you need to find another practitioner before she ruins your face. This is not how you should look after electrolysis, is she qualified (obviously not)?!
</p>
<p>
Send her your photo and ask to see her qualifications.
</p>
<p>
Those pockets may not heal without medical intervention like laser resurfacing.  Don&#39;t go back, if you&#39;ve paid for more sessions already, take the financial hit and run.

She does not know how to work her machine and red flag for her being in business, if anything she should have gone at half the strength and had you come back for multiple sessions to slowly remove the ball hair and close the opening

Soprono Platinum machine has wavelength for dark skin. It isn’t they only one. Look for 1064 nm wavelength, also known as the Nd:YAG. See someone who has experience working with darker skin tones.

I was told that hyper pigmentation is normal after electrolysis. I have fair skin so I haven’t seen these sorts of lesions on me. I do turn red and have even little welts sometimes. These usually are healed up within a week. By two weeks the area is no longer tender. I usually switch areas from week to week so no one zone gets treated twice in the same month or so…

Took me about 160 hours over a year, four or five times a week, one or two hour at a time. A few three hour sessions.  The upper lip is a challenge. This looks way different from anything I ever saw on my face. I did a lot of soaking in facecloth with Epsom Salts and water as hot as I could stand.  Five minutes is plenty.  First, see a skin doctor, this does not look good.
</p>
<p>
Good luck.  Also, if surgery is possibly in your future, start genital electrolysis ASAP.
