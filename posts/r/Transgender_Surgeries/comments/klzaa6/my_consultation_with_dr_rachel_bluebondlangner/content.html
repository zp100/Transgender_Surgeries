I saw a comment saying that there is an unfulfilled need for more information on consultations (and results, but I&#39;m still a ways away, lol). I had my consult with Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner on September 8th, so it&#39;s not exactly fresh in my mind, but I figured I&#39;d share anyways :)
</p>
<p>
Scheduling:
</p>
<p>
Going chronologically, my first call was really easy. I called, said I&#39;d like to schedule a consultation for vaginoplasty, and they wrote me in. I got lucky and got a date only 5 months away! After covid really hit, I started having issues communicating though.
</p>
<p>
They told me they were switching to video conferences and that I should fill out some paperwork if I wanted to do it over video. I had questions but had to call again and again. I only got answers when I got to a human. If I hit an answering machine, my calls were not returned. My messages were only returned once iirc. I was told I could use MyChart, but I couldn&#39;t actually send any messages through there until after my consultation. They never told me if I was set up for the video or not. I finally get through to them (after a decent period of giving up on trying to contact them) and I&#39;m told, they are *not* doing video consults anymore. No biggie, but a heads up would&#39;ve been nice. Skip to a week or so before my consultation and they call me to make sure I&#39;m ready and such. Now they *are* doing video consults again (when that changed, I have no clue) and they require a covid test for in person consultations (totally fair, but again I wasn&#39;t informed and had already bought my plane tickets at this point. My plan was to fly in the night before, but they needed 24 hrs for the covid test to process.) I rescheduled my flight and hotel stay and got everything situated. It was a lot more trouble than I would&#39;ve liked, but everything is all set up.
</p>
<p>
Consultation:
</p>
<p>
Getting to the actual appointment, I showed up and waited for over an hour before I was seen. It doesn&#39;t severely stain my experience, but for something scheduled months (in some cases, over a year) in advance, it seemed odd. I&#39;ll chalk that up to something unexpected popping up though, as my second appointment (that I&#39;ll get to) went quickly and smoothly. The actual consultation went fine. I knew mostly what to expect, and they answered my questions. I will say that she was dismissive towards one or two questions though. Kinda gave a &#34;why would you even ask that&#34; vibe. I don&#39;t think it was the intention, but it unnerved me a little. (The question I specifically remember was &#34;can anal sex make SRS difficult/impossible?&#34; I asked because I had seen a post here about how a woman was only able to get minimal depth GCS (apparently) because of anal. She only learned this after waking up from the procedure.)
</p>
<p>
Overall, it honestly felt like a waste of time. Part of this is because I was hoping for some kind of tangible progress, but I didn&#39;t even get a tentative date until a week or so afterwards and I needed to get new letters anyways because they said that ideally, you want your mental health letters to be dated within a year of your actual surgery. I also didn&#39;t really learn anything I didn&#39;t already know from doing my research. If you can do it over video, I&#39;d probably suggest that, with some hesitations. You do need a pre-op physical (though, that turned out to be all of three seconds looking and jotting down about how long I was flaccid). This (along with hearing that she only shows results in person) were my main motivations for heading there in person. Not to mention that I had already planned on making the trip. I&#39;d taken time off work and booked my tickets etc.
</p>
<p>
*Big thing to take note of if you&#39;re planning on going with Bluebond-Langner:*
</p>
<p>
Make sure you *ask* to see results if you want to see them. I expected that showing pictures was standard practice and didn&#39;t even have it in my list of questions. I managed to forget to ask about them until I was on my way to the airport. I had to take a second trip up, isolate and take a covid test again. All to just see some pictures. I&#39;m glad I won&#39;t be going in blind so to speak, but I spent way more money and time than was realistically necessary. That all said, this second appointment makes me think the issues I had the first time around were a bit of a fluke. They quickly found a slot for me, scheduled me, and saw me in a timely manner. Communication is also vastly improved.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also worth noting that I did have to pay for both appointments. It was ~$130 the first time, ~$30 the second. Both were run through insurance.
</p>
<p>
Post Consultation:
</p>
<p>
I got lucky once again with my surgery date. It&#39;s 11 months after my consultation. That means I only waited 16 months from first call to surgery! I got in on cancellations for both dates, so I don&#39;t know if this is something to expect or not, but they also mentioned that once I&#39;m finished with my hair removal, I can ask to be moved further up. On the topic of hair removal, she does require it, but also does follicle scraping for safety. As for where it&#39;s required, you&#39;ll get a PDF, but it&#39;s a triangle starting right above the anus, following the creases of your legs and ending about halfway up the scrotum on each side.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got a pre-op appointment in May (this will be over video) going over what exactly to expect. What I know now though, is that I&#39;ll stay in the hospital for 5 days, walk after 2(!). Then I&#39;ll have to stay within an hour of the hospital for 2 weeks. I&#39;ll have several post-op appointments. Once a week for 4 weeks, then at 3, 6, and 12 months post-op.
</p>
<p>
The recovery schedule is roughly: Walking at 2 days, touching once you&#39;re comfortable, cleared for work at 6 weeks, sex at 3 months, major swelling gone at about a year.
</p>
<p>
The dilation schedule is 4x daily for the first 6 weeks, 3x daily for the next 6 weeks, 2x daily from month 3 to month 9, 1x daily from month 9 to 12. 1-3x per week post year 1.
</p>
<p>
I think that just about does it! Apologies for the info dump, but that should cover pretty much everything that came to my mind. Let me know if you&#39;ve got any questions!

I just had my consult with her two days ago. Waited 11 months. It was a major let down, to access the &#34;bulb&#34; of the glans, she incises from the bottom side of the penis along the urethra, tip to base. The would destroy my frenulum, which for me is my most sensate part. I asked if she could alter the procedure slightly to change this but she won&#39;t change her surgery at all, in any way. They do the procedure the exact same way every time, which is why they&#39;re so good at it, it also means your end result is based completely off your existing anatomy, and they can&#39;t/won&#39;t give you any kind of prediction of how that will play out in your case.
</p>
<p>
All in all, I felt kinda like I was sitting on an assembly line. I left in tears, I won&#39;t be going to her. If you want consistency she&#39;s your girl, if you need aesthetic control or anything custom don&#39;t go.

I&#39;m satisfied. I was a little worried when I couldn&#39;t find many results of her&#39;s here. It seemed almost hit or miss if you&#39;d have a well defined inner labia (though that perception might be biased from one particular result). From what I remember (she showed me then off of her phone), her&#39;s aren&#39;t as nice as, say, Suporn&#39;s, but they all looked very much like a vagina, which is my main concern, lol.
</p>
<p>
She didn&#39;t really highlight anything. I do think I remember her mentioning something about the difference in color between the vaginal canal and the labia though.

Thank you so, so much for posting this!! Iâ€™m really grateful for the heads up on scheduling issues, as my consult is in just over two months!
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m curious, as you said you were flying: do you live in New York State? If not, how are you getting insurance coverage.
</p>
<p>
Also as a other commenter asked, were you generally satisfied with her results? Were the pics immediately post-op only? I assume also 12 months, as thereâ€™s a 12 Mo post-op appointment.
</p>
<p>
Did she have much to say on the ability to self-lubricate?
</p>
<p>
Are you feeling pretty secure with your choice of surgeon?

<p>
No. I live in Florida. My understanding that she&#39;s still in-network so I should be fine? I&#39;ll know for sure once my insurance for next year kicks in on the first. I asked the insurance people and they said I
<em>
should
</em>
be fine, but we&#39;ll see.
</p>
<p>
Yeah. All in all, I wouldn&#39;t be upset if I got something like what she showed me. I would prefer a more defined inner labia, so I might have to get a bit lucky, but they were good. Revisions are always an option too if I get particularly unlucky. And they were all considerably post-op. I didn&#39;t ask for clarification, but I think they are pictures taken by the patients and sent back to her.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t remember anything sticking out. Basically assume you can&#39;t, but it seems common that you&#39;ll have decent lubrication. Like I alluded, I did a lot of research before hand, so I can&#39;t exactly remember if that&#39;s info she told me or something I picked up. Anecdotally though, a friend of mine just had hers done by Bluebond and she said she self lubes just fine, though, probably not enough for sex.
</p>
<p>
Yeah. My main concern for her was aesthetics. I&#39;ve heard overwhelmingly positive things about her and had no doubts on functionality. Seeing decent results makes me comfortable in picking her.

Make sure that the hospital is in network too! I didn&#39;t know to check that, so now I owe my full in-network and full out-of-network amounts.

Yikes! That&#39;s rough. :/ Yeah, I made sure to ask them to check the specific surgeon and hospital. Unfortunately, insurance sucks, so who knows!

.  I&#39;ve decided on McGinn, but this all would&#39;ve been very useful information when I was considering Dr. RBL - thanks!  My consult with her was over a year from when I scheduled it, so I bailed.

Really only the day before. I had to get my covid test done on Monday morning (they said I&#39;d be cutting it close, but it&#39;s either then or Friday, so...). Then I just waited in my hotel room from after I took my test until when I went in for the consultation on Tuesday.

I can&#39;t remember exactly. Once I heard a satisfying answer the specifics evacuated my brain. That said, I remember she gave me a specific number for complications. I want to say it was single digits? I know that doesn&#39;t mean much without knowing how many she&#39;s performed, sorry. I know it was a low enough complication rate that I was impressed. I should&#39;ve taken notes.

Thank you for all your excellent notes! Iâ€™m sure you canâ€™t wait for 11 months from now. She is also the surgeon Iâ€™m most considering as well.

*Definitely* ask about cancellations. My friend who&#39;s consult was in July of this year had surgery in October. Super jealous, but talk about a short wait, lol.
</p>

(Also, just in case my post was confusing, I had all my letters. I just needed to get new ones because I started preparing too early, lol.)

Itâ€™s a hidden fact with Rachael that if you have all your letters and have started electro when you see her for a consult she gives you a sooner date.

I went in for my consult October 2017 and had a date for July 2018. I pushed it back because of work and school to July 2019.
</p>
<p>
I had all my letters ready before my consult. I just needed to start electro.

Call once and a while to check in!! Thatâ€™s the best way to get the date moved up

Hmm. I guess there just haven&#39;t been any cancellations yet. (Either that, or you meant last November, in which case I have no idea how I&#39;d get the date I got.) If you&#39;re on the list, hopefully it&#39;ll shorten up for you! I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s a first come, first served deal, but idk. Good luck!

Ty for sharing! I had my consult with her this summer and it was very similar to what you described here.  Was also sorta disappointed that it didn&#39;t feel like a tangible achievement / step of progress and more of a hoop they make you jump through for no good reason with no real benefits
</p>
<p>
Also yeah you have to ask for pics, which is totally asinine.
</p>
<p>
If I can ask though, how are you doing with your hair removal? That&#39;s the most grueling part of all this for me, and I still have quite a bit more to go by sept.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the write-up!

I&#39;m doing fine? I think? My fourth laser appointment is next weekend. They&#39;re hitting me six times then switching to electrolysis. I should have about 6 months to do electrolysis, but I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re supposed to stop 3 months before, so maybe I&#39;ll be cutting it really close. I&#39;m also a little apprehensive that I&#39;m doing laser at all, but the fact that she scrapes during the surgery anyway is very reassuring. I&#39;d definitely go back and start electro a year ago if I had the chance though. (It doesn&#39;t help that they wouldn&#39;t give me the specific area they need cleared until after the consultation.)

I&#39;m pretty satisfied. I prefer Suporn&#39;s aesthetic results because, at least from what I&#39;ve seen, he tends to give you a more defined inner labia, but I wouldn&#39;t be unhappy if I got what I saw from her.
