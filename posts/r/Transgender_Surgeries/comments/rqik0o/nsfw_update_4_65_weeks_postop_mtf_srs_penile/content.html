[NSFW] Update 4 - 6.5 weeks post-op MtF SRS (Penile Inversion with Scrotal Skin Graft) with Dr. Sutin from PAI in Bangkok Thailand. Had my first orgasm yesterday and I&#39;m absolutely over the moon. This was the best decision I&#39;ve ever made. Healing is going great and no more pain (slide for more pics)

Yes! It was an incredible experience. Wouldn&#39;t have imagined to be able to do it at this point, but couldn&#39;t be happier :)

Not to hog this girls thread, but I want ya&#39;ll to know that the Hospital and nurses and personal care you receive in PAI&#39;s care puts the States to shame. They made me feel like a Queen and that I was all that mattered. I was overwhelmed with care. It blew me away, tbh. I also had concierge care from some sweetie named, Bune and he made sure I was always cared for. My point is, you don&#39;t receive &#34;discount&#34; care. It&#39;s all very First Class. My friend had 80K worth of U.S. care and nothing but problems and indifference.

There‚Äôs some excellent hospitals in Thailand and it‚Äôs relatively cheap because it‚Äôs not a first world country. PAI use one of the good ones, and they are far from the cheapest surgeons there. It only seems cheap because most of us are coming from wealthy first world countries.

Absolutely. Puts Germany to shame, too. I was genuinely extremely surprised with just how good the care from them was. Everything was absolutely top notch and their assistants are terrific. Especially Bune is a sweetheart. Totally agree

Remember that Thai costs make the US dollar considered the Lost Treasure of the Pirates. Paying that to a thai surgeon is called like paying 300K to an US&#39;s surgeon.... So they give you the service they&#39;re paid for. It&#39;s about money. They give back part of the&#34;fortune&#34; you sent then for surgery. 80K in the States is a misery. So they give back what they&#39;re paid for.
</p>
<p>
Simple as that.

I remember Dr. S having me douche with a betadine solution for the first two weeks. I think it made a massive difference with how I healed. It&#39;s years later and I still only dilate when I like. I started with 6.5 inches depth and still have 6 inches. He truly is an amazing surgeon. Self funders should definitely have him on their short list.

I entirely agree! The betadine douching is something I still do occassionally to just be safe. I&#39;ve had 0 problems with him and he&#39;s been basically perfect. My dilation schedule is very easy and I have almost no problems. It&#39;s been great!

What is more important to you? Returning to your job? Or the health of your new Vagina?
</p>
<p>
I might suggest you focus on healing. Not returning to work.
</p>
<p>
You can get FMLA in the US for 12 weeks. Plan for it and utilize it.
</p>
<p>
If you are outside the US, you might have it better.
</p>
<p>
I might suggest taking a look at

sometime, too.

I could already return to desk work, but I would recommend waiting longer. The 2 month mark should be a lot more comfortable. Desk work would&#39;ve theoretically been possible at 4 weeks. Again. Wouldn&#39;t recommend it though. Take as much time for healing as you can!

See this makes me want to go to Thailand, most of the results that i love are all from Thailand. Yours look so amazing, THIS is what I want! And it&#39;s only 6 + weeks? It will just look better, and better with time.
</p>
<p>
My problem is that, coming from Central Europe, my insurance covers Dr.Djordjevic, and it&#39;s basically an hour and a half by plane.But for a result like this i WOULD gladly pay!
</p>
<p>
Were you happy with their post op care? Was the pain managment ok?

I&#39;m from Germany and decided to go for Thailand as well because of your reasons. Especially since I&#39;m really not satisfied with the results of most european surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Post-Op care and pain management were absolutely stellar! I&#39;ve rarely felt this genuinely cared about as with their team and they made sure to always and regularily check in with you.

That is amazing to hear, I just have to do more research because I&#39;m circumsized, and small, and Djordjevic already told me that colon would be for me, not PI. So that is another obstacle I have, although maybe Sutin or some other Dr. from PAI would have a different opinion.
</p>
<p>
Your post, and the fact you are also from Europe, really made me open my eyes about Thailand, and especially PAI, so thanks again.

Girl, you look wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing these great photos. Your vagina is amazing and indistinguishable from that of a CIS woman. I am so happy for you that you had an orgasm after such a short time. And I envy your great body and cute breasts ;-)

The price for my SRS with Dr. Sutin was at 8220‚Ç¨ for PAI&#39;s SRS package. My overall spendings were at roughly at 12k‚Ç¨, but 10k‚Ç¨ would&#39;ve also been easily possible if I went with a cheaper hotel, etc. I really did the luxury package!

Hey! My personal reasons for deciding against a colon graft were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I didn&#39;t want a second major surgery site, especially not in the colorectal region, as that seemed a bit scary to me.
</li>
<li>
I don&#39;t really care all that much for natural lubrication, since I&#39;m very fine with just using lube.
</li>
<li>
I felt more comfortable with PI as it&#39;s the standard method and is better researched and most surgeons are more experienced with it than with a colon graft.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And that&#39;s mostly it! But then again. Those are purely personal reasons. I can totally understand why those may not be issues for others and they&#39;d maybe prefer a colon graft. I&#39;m relatively neutral on the topic.

Hey my love! Thank you for answering!! That all makes sense! Considering you only had PI and have obtained 5.5‚Äù depth I‚Äôm in awe!!! Kind of want to think a bit more because the tummy scar would really bother me! Thank you so much, really happy for you x

A bit, but not like a cis vagina. There&#39;s tiny bits of lubrication from the urethra though and during arousal a bit of what previously would&#39;ve been precum from the prostate. For penetration I&#39;d need a bit of lube though :&#39;)

I admire your youth, and your commitment to what appears to be health eating habits. Your overall frame (shoulders, arms, torso, et cetera)  is quite slender, and truly helps you blend into cis society. Very happy and envious :)

Thank you very much for sharing, you are having a very good recovery (and an aesthetic and very natural result), it makes me more relaxed and confident going to Dr. Sutin for my SRS, I have three questions about dilation and dilators: How do I are the dilators you use? (Could you share a photo of them) Did you buy the dilators that appear on their website? How has the dilation process been during these 6.5 postoperative weeks that you have?

I received 2 dilators from them. The first one has a thickness of 2.9cm and measures 15.5cm + the base (so probably a total of 19cm), The second one has the same length and is around 3.2/3.3cm thick.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t bought any additional dilators yet, might do so later though.
</p>
<p>
I have a depth of 5.5/5.75 inches (ca. 14/14.5 cm) which is good enough for me. I don&#39;t really care about having huuuuge depth, like some others and 12 to 15 cm is the standard for cis women, too so that&#39;s good in my book.
</p>
<p>
Dilation has mostly been easy enough. Some pain and discomfort here and there, but never major enough that it would&#39;ve really been too bad, im my case.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been put on a schedule of 2x a day for 30min, but sometimes do 45min each, just to be safe.

Was your first Orgasm from external or internal stimulation? Or both? I hope that&#39;s not too personal a question you&#39;re SO gorgeous btw. I have been reticent to even consider this surgery but you look so amazing that I&#39;m sorta starting to consider it.

External, mainly! I played around a bit inside, which felt nice too, but I had more sensation externally, which did the job well! :&#39;)

That&#39;s great üòç do you mind me asking- how sensitive was your glans before it was (I assume it was the glans) repurposed as your clit? Does it feel better now?
</p>
<p>
Personally, as I&#39;m considering this surgery I am concerned about the fact that I&#39;m uncircumcised and thus have little sensitivity in my glans/head, good feels are all on the front just below the head/glans. I&#39;m thinking maybe with a hood covering it I may actually be able to gain sensitivity but I&#39;m very curious about your experience here.

I would say I had medium sensitivity. I was half circumcised before, which wasn&#39;t an issue though.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard from a lot of people that usually you&#39;re actually more sensitive when uncircumcised so idk about that?
</p>
<p>
This&#39;ll probably vary from person to person, but I&#39;ve roughly kept the same sensitivity I had before, so it stayed pretty similar, although it is much easier to get aroused now, since I don&#39;t deal with the dysphoria anymore of course :&#39;)

How easy is it to urinate? Sorry if it‚Äôs an odd question I‚Äôve just always wondered how it felt and if it was easier or harder.

I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s a difference in how easy or hard it is. You just have a shorter urinary tract so things come out faster aaaand you have less direction of course :&#39;). In the beginning things were a tiny bit harder because of swelling, but that subsided in the first 2 weeks.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d say it&#39;s roughly the same. Just, again, a bit different.

What&#39;s a betadine douching? Can you explain please? Do you also put betadine inside?

The betadine douching you do after surgery is done by using a small vaginal douche (basically the same as an anal douche) to clean out ans disinfect the inside of your vagina in the first weeks after surgery to prevent infection, keep things clean, etc. In my case it was two bottlecaps of betadine solution diluted in 200ml of water everytime after dilating for the first 4 weeks post-op. It is a bit tedious, but really helps with keeping things healthy! And don&#39;t worry. It doesn&#39;t hurt. A tiny bit uncomfortable, but not painful :)

I know this is a late response... but I am looking to get surgery with Sutin and I really like the aesthetics of yours compared to some of the others I&#39;ve seen. Did you ask for exactly what you wanted? And what did you ask for if you don&#39;t mind me asking? I like how the labia minora isn&#39;t large or protruding if that makes sense? Would really appreciate any of your tips... let me know if I can DM you!
