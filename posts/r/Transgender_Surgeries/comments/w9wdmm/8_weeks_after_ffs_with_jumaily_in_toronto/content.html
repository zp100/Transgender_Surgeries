<strong>
8 weeks after FFS with Jumaily in Toronto (forehead contouring, type III, orbital rim contouring, browlift, v-line jaw contouring with sliding genioplasty including 4mm height reduction and t-osteotomy)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt have dysphoria anymore even without makeup. I still usually wear makeup, but I was short on time and went to work like in the light-makeup comparison photos today and didn&#39;t worry about it. I can just live life. FFS has been life changing for me.
</p>
<p>
I didn‚Äôt get a tracheal shave because my Eve‚Äôs Apple doesn‚Äôt bother me and I was worried about vocal risks. I didn‚Äôt get a lip lift because it would expose my gums even without a full smile.
</p>
<p>
I told Jumaily I loved his work, to be as aggressive as possible with my brow, and that I was worried about my chin looking too long after FFS. Otherwise, he gave me an overview of the procedures, but didn&#39;t get too far into details.
</p>
<p>
The swelling and pain from the first 5 days were brutal. I am very glad I stayed overnight at Clinic 360. Some surgeons say that genioplasty involves ‚Äúsome discomfort‚Äù and that doesn&#39;t reasonably describe the pain I went through. The rest of recovery was pretty chill but it took a month for my energy to be back up to normal. It was 3 1/2 weeks before I was fully presentable. I started work after 3 1/2 weeks and regret that ‚Äî 4 or 5 weeks would have been more reasonable.
</p>
<p>
I feel mostly recovered now and haven&#39;t had complications. Some sensation is still coming back on my scalp and chin, but everywhere has at least some sensation now. My jawline is slightly uneven (less than it was before) and Jumaily said that it might even out over time but if not that would be a reduced-cost revision. I think it would take a lot of unevenness for me to want more surgery, but it is an option. Unrelatedly, the bump on the bottom-left of my jawline is slightly larger than the bump on the bottom-right of my jawline. You can&#39;t see it, you have to push to actually feel it, so it shouldn&#39;t matter, but I found it a little disconcerting. Jumaily said the cut is slightly uneven but isn&#39;t unexpected or problematic. I had a small divot on my forehead from internal stitches and that&#39;s almost gone, and that&#39;s also not unexpected.
</p>
<p>
The only surprise I have is that I now have a tapered eye crease. I love it and if I knew he could do that I would have asked him to do that, but given how much it changes my face I would have expected that to be discussed. My sister actually has very slight tapering so it&#39;s not totally out of place given my genetics, but I generally think of those as Asian, so that might be something to discuss with Jumaily if you have strong feelings either way. He said they were intentional and should stick around even after my face finishes settling.
</p>
<p>
I first contacted Jumaily in December 2021 and was originally scheduled in Toronto for December 2022. A spot opened up last June, and I took it. Jumaily‚Äôs staff is great but overworked, it often took a few calls or emails to get questions answered. You might need to be persistent.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pricing (invoiced Feb 7, 2022)
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Complete Upperface Transformation (Forehead contouring, Type III, Orbital Rim Contouring, Browlift): $19,500 CAD
</li>
<li>
V-Line Jaw Contouring (with sliding genioplasty and T-Osteotomy): $20,000 CAD
</li>
<li>
Overnight Observation: $2,500 CAD (this is necessary in Ontario when the surgery could be over 6 hours, but I would recommend overnight observation if you are having genioplasty either way)
</li>
<li>
HST (tax): $5,470 CAD
</li>
<li>
Total: $47,460.00 CAD
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Overall, I feel like I got what I paid for and it‚Äôs been life changing. I am disgusted by how inaccessible FFS is. I hope more surgeons continue to take up FFS and that OHIP realizes it&#39;s at least as important to day-to-day life as bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to answer any questions.

Thanks for sharing all that info!! So many people post before and after without saying anything.
</p>
<p>
Looks like they did a good job!
</p>
<p>
I fully agree about FFS not being accessible. Only the Yukon has it covered in Canada. I just started saving for FFS but it feel like it will take me 5 years to get there

You have to be a Yukon resident, maybe buy a house there, live a year, and then go for surgeries paid by the provincial health care. :P
</p>
<p>
But it&#39;s a cold place :(
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s only 43 thousand people in that whole province. So it&#39;s probably not super exciting.
</p>
<p>
Maybe we should all move there and have a rainbow street.

Thank you so much for sharing all the details! I hope to someday get ffs, it‚Äôs scares me for multiple reasons but I think my need for it is bigger than my fears! I‚Äôm just always amazed at how quickly everything heals, that‚Äôs two months after, for some reason in my head I‚Äôm like you‚Äôd still be bruised and stitched by then! Anyways thanks again for sharing I hope to see updates! Sending love sis! üíú

Generally, just shaving the chin bone isn&#39;t enough to get much of a v-line or chin reduction, so you have to remove a piece in the middle of the chin. That&#39;s called a t-osteotomy.

I had three virtual consults before the surgery, because he doesn&#39;t do in person consults out of Toronto. I met him in person the day before surgery.

Can I ask around what week you started to see a significant reduction in swelling? Or when you started to look closer to how you look now?
</p>
<p>
Amazing results by the way. So glad you‚Äôre feeling happier and more comfortable! Thank you for sharing.

It got worse and worse during the first five days and I looked like a balloon. Then for the next couple weeks, you could see significant changes every day. I think by around 3 - 3 1/2 weeks, most people wouldn&#39;t think of me as swollen, and I stopped being able to see the difference day-to-day. I&#39;m still a little swollen and can see changes week-to-week especially in my chin, fully recovering takes a year or so.

I‚Äôm so glad! In case you have the same kind of thing as me, I actually had a bone growth on my left side. Before FFS, it hurt sometimes at night or when I got a cold. FFS fixed that.

For vertical height and as part of v-line. I was happy with how much it stuck out before, so I didn&#39;t get that changed.

i honestly can&#39;t tell the difference in that respect, since you also shaved the mandible i can&#39;t tell what&#39;s the result of trimming bone and what is the result of realigning the jaw (i.e genioplasty) but obviously great results overall, it&#39;s just that genioplasty seemed overkill maybe?

For the record, genioplasty doesn&#39;t realign the jaw (either or them). You may be thinking of maxillomandibular advancement/orthognathic surgery. The genioplasty just refers to the chin and any movement (superior, inferior, anterior, posterior) it undergoes.

In a genioplasty, yeah. You separate it and then shift it forward, down, back, etc. to achieve facial balance and harmony. Then it gets affixed with the same titanium screws and hardware that all jaw surgery uses if an osteotomy has been performed.

Honestly this is super common, so I would be floored if FT or essentially any surgeon you&#39;re looking at for FFS couldn&#39;t do this. ü§ó I feel like I just showed you that drinking water is good for your health after you&#39;d somehow not been exposed to that information your whole life! Genioplasty (and chin fillers) are super easy ways to adjust ones facial appearance from a profile or head on angle!

all i&#39;ve heard FT doing is shaving the bone where it is, which means a lot of patients have had trouble with sagging skin after, because the face skin doesn&#39;t adapt to the new face bone. i just read on keojampas facebook that genioplasty prevents that problem. so seeing as FT has that problem, maybe they don&#39;t do genioplasty?

I guess you&#39;d just have to email and ask them if they do genioplasties or not, but I will say that a genioplasty doesn&#39;t, magically, prevent sagging skin. In fact, if you take a chunk of bone out and leave a gap - which can happen with any osteotomy - the skin and underlying tissue doesn&#39;t have anything to anchor to and can sag. Shaving and cutting are both great tools and can both have great outcomes in a good surgeons hands, or sagging skin in the wrong hands.

I was on the fence about chin/jawline work in general, but it&#39;s a package deal. My chin would look too long if it wasn&#39;t moved up since v-lines tend to do that. If you look at some of Jumaily&#39;s early chin/jawline work, you can see that problem IMO. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard of a v-line with a t-osteotomy but without sliding genioplasty.

If you haven‚Äôt already, take a look at my summary in the comments, but I think everything went really well! My advice for the consult is to have an idea of what the common procedures are and what you want. You don‚Äôt need to have your mind made up but I feel like that helped the consults go smoothly. Good luck!

It really is üòû. I would also look at Mexican and South American surgeons. It was important for me to stay in Canada, but I‚Äôve been impressed with some of their work and they are less expensive.

Thank you!

He can do incisions on or behind the hairline (coronal). I didn&#39;t need hairline lowering, so I had mine behind the hairline. I think FT doesn&#39;t like hairline lowering for whatever reason, so they mainly do coronal. FT are definitely competent, I think it&#39;s a question of aesthetics.

He has an Instagram/TikTok, and there are plenty of results in this subreddit (check the wiki) and in the

. There are not as many before/after shots for his chin/jaw work. He does require a CT scan for cranioplasty and genioplasty. I did a lot of research on him. One thing to keep in mind is that negative reviews tend to get taken down. This isn&#39;t unique to him, but his team seems to be particularly aggressive. I have no idea what kind of deal is involved, if any. The negative reviews that I&#39;ve seen removed were mainly somewhat common complications (like infections) and results that honestly looked good to me.

The procedure is in a surgical center. I paid for overnight observation at the Toronto location and I&#39;m glad I did. If you&#39;re having genioplasty and he won&#39;t keep you overnight (I think he tries to avoid this in the California location), I would recommend hiring a nurse at least overnight.

<p>
There&#39;s generally an in-person follow up a week after surgery, and I think the length of stay would depend on your procedures, that&#39;s really a question for him. He used absorbable stitches for me, but it depends on the specific procedures (I think absorbable is more common when the stitches aren&#39;t visible).

Best luck!
