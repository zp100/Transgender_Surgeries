Well, hair removal would need laser or IPL.  As far as skin health, you might consider shea butter and raw coconut oil mixed together.   Shea has amazing softening and fortifying effects, while the coconut oil is both anti-bacterial and anti-fungal. The hyaluronic acid found in coconut oil helps with a plethora of skin issues.  You might also consider supplementing your diet with some coconut oil daily.  If you have any raw feeling skin, look to simple salt water to help heal and toughen up the skin.  You can saturate a cloth with salt water and let it rest on the tender skin a few times a day.  Then dry thoroughly and apply the shea/coconut mix (just rub the two together in your palm to mix) and then be sure to wear breathable underwear.

For chafing/new skin protection you could try a zinc or a vitamin A&amp;D ointment (both are traditionally diaper rash ointments) I’ve used both on my vulva whenever it’s irritated. The zinc is messier than the A&amp;D, but it will dry out any oozing.
