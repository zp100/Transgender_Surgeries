Hey y’all! As you could probably guess from the title I had surgery with Dr. Ting at Mt. Sinai 3.5 weeks ago. I chose to have the Peritoneal graft penile inversion vaginoplasty, this was due to both a slight lack of tissue (hrt made things smaller) and I wanted a better chance at lubrication. I booked my consultation for surgery in April of last year, had the consultation in October, and the surgery at the end of June. All together it was about 15 months from booking to surgery. My wait would have been shorter had I gone with dr. Avenssian (trained by Ting) however I hadn’t seen results from her and that seemed like just a bit of a risk I wasn’t willing to take, and at that point dr Ting was the only one doing the Peritoneal version of the operation. I did not stop hormones until one day before surgery as recommended by dr ting.
</p>
<p>
I entered into the NY eye and ear infirmity for surgery (a weird location but apparently it has some equipment needed by the surgeons and also has more room and suits the needs of the surgery better) at 5AM, after doing a truly trying bowel prep the night prior to clear out my body (It tastes like Coney Island sea water and you have to drink a LOT, then you shit yourself for 12 hours. Same prep as a colonoscopy I’m told.). I checked in then met with the head nurse, several PA’s (including dr. Slackman who did my laser hair removal and is one of the kindest and smartest people I met during my time working with mt Sinai), and the anesthesiologist who walked me through how anesthesia would go. Then I met with dr Ting who went over all the risks -and scared the shirt out of my mom who was with me, I said goodbye to her and went into the OR. I got knocked out pretty quickly but they did ask me if there was any music I’d like to listen to beforehand.
</p>
<p>
Right after surgery:
</p>
<p>
Not much pain tbh, but intense nausea. I threw up multiple times and slept a lot. I couldn’t even take pain meds without immediately puking at this point (I’m told this was a side affect of anesthesia).
</p>
<p>
The nurses are all amazing and super kind, and once my nausea dissipated later in the evening I had some lovely conversations with them. The rooms are single and very nice.  I finally was able to eat a little and take oxy as well as a cocktail of other meds to keep pain under control once sensation started returning. I had a catheter in which felt like I had to pee constantly and a wound vac (machine attached to your vag sucking out blood) hooked up so I was limited in mobility.
</p>
<p>
I also had several low fevers (100-101F) which came and went from the first day until about 2 weeks post op. This meant I was always sweating and hot which was not pleasant. By day 2 I was walking a lil more, and could look at myself in the mirror for the first time, I saw myself looking the way I had always imagined and broke down crying on the spot.  I had a bowel movement day 3 which was thankfully fine though a weird experience when you have tubes coming out of you. I went to my family home the morning of the fourth day (I grew up in the city) and it felt amazing to be in a familiar bed again and not eat hospital food.
</p>
<p>
That night my wound vac got clogged. We called the hospital and they told us to come in the next morning to have it fixed - if this happens to you know that it isn’t the end of the world and does not need to be immediately fixed (it can wait a day or two max if necessary). We went in the next morning to fix everything and I was back in bed 2 hours later. Bowel movements were and continue to suck. At this point I was using the bathroom very often and that whole situation became raw and irritated. Not showering also sucked especially as I have long curly hair that tangles after one day without showering
</p>
<p>
Week 2:
</p>
<p>
Packing and cath out!!! This was a fucking weird experience let me tell you, they unhooked the wound vac first which was fine - but the thing about a wound vac is that it uses suction and in order to make that suction there needs to be a seal. They make that seal with surgical tape. So I had to have surgical tape peeled off of the entire surgery site and it was provably the most painful part of this whole ordeal. I was screaming and cursing up  a storm as they tore tape off my freshly operated on vagina. Thankfully that lasted 5 min max and then the packing and cath came out - both of those were weird but not painful feelings, similar to douching before anal sex. I saw my brand new pussy and freaked a lil cause she was U G L Y. The PA told me this was normal and she’d sort herself out soon, he helped me dilate and I was sent home with my freshly waxed and uncovered vagina.
</p>
<p>
This week the fevers got bad, I was oscillating between super hot and cold sweats constantly. The nurses said this was a side effect of surgery so I took ibuprofen and rode it out. Dilating was mostly fine, messy and uncomfortable, but fine.  This first week I dilated Twice a day with the smallest rod. I discovered the hell that is pads which had the effect of both validating my gender and making me waddle like a baby penguin with a full diaper. I was able to shower and gently clean everything, wash my hair, not smell like the gowanas canal, which was an incredible relief.
</p>
<p>
The documents will give you a lot of specific instructions about walking, standing, etc. but take it with a grain of salt and listen to your body. If standing feels fine for longer than 15 min, you’re probably fine. If you feel like ur gonna pass out, sit the fuck down. Also no sitting at all and dilate the way your doctor tells you to no exceptions (except if you have a complication obvi).
</p>
<p>
Week 3:
</p>
<p>
Ah week 3, the worst week yet Sensation has started to come back and with it, pain. So much fucking pain. Like to the point where I could walk before decently and suddenly I couldn’t make more than 20 steps without collapsing.  I started taking oxy again which I had weaned off of because my vagina felt like it was constantly being stabbed and my inner thigh muscles ached like I just ran 5 marathons.  I also started taking fiber supplements because having stopped stool softeners, the meds made me constipated and gave me mild hemorrhoids that are thankfully finally starting to go away now.   This was arguably the hardest week.  I went in to see the PA’s to make sure the pain was normal and fortunately it is, also fortunately they said I had one if the best looking vaginoplasty results they’d seen which made me feel at the very least like the pain is worth it,
</p>
<p>
I went up to the next sized dilator which did not help the pain or muscle ache, neither did upping the schedule to 3 times a day  (There are one or two times I missed a dilation here or there and I was able to reach and sustain depth the next session without pain so know it’s not the end of the world if there are one or two times you have to miss early on, just make it up with a longer session next time).
</p>
<p>
First half of the 4th week :
</p>
<p>
The pain is lessening slowly, thankfully, though it’s still not great I take it as a sign that I’m improving.  Bowel movements are still painful but less so, I’m also taking a fiber supplement to help things and I would highly recommend this. I also moved up to the penultimate dilator which hurts, but less and less each time. Still on painkillers but not around the clock now which is nice. I’m told that after week 4 patients usually turn a big corner in recovery,
</p>
<p>
Aesthetically speaking I’m thrilled. Everything looks gorgeous, very little visible scarring, and the swelling is down loads. dr ting himself said I had incredible results and though  it seemed like he was patting himself on the back a little, it makes all the tough stuff a little easier to handle. Sensation is coming back slowly, I tried masturbating recently and had a good time though I couldn’t cum yet. Stitches are more and more prominent as swelling has gone down which is very uncomfortable and as many of them are by the clit that’s also part of the reason why cumming was so hard to achieve.
</p>
<p>
Discharge is lessening though I still definitely go through at least 3 pads a day, hoping that number drops soon and I can switch to liners,
</p>
<p>
I’m very much looking forward to being able to go home at 5.5 weeks and not have to rely on my mom, as well as see my boyfriend and sleep in my own bed.

Do you know if they take New York Medicaid? And how much is the surgery? I&#39;m having my consultation in October for the Peritoneal Pull Through.

I don’t! That’s something to talk with Ting’s office about! I will say they try very hard to fight for you and make sure they do all they can to get you covered.  I haven’t received a bill yet butl I’ll let you know when or if it comes

Hopefully, I get covered because I&#39;m out-off state. Otherwise, I might need to move to NYC.

I was going to find my previous question I had asked you a few weeks ago to message you and see how you are doing by now, I guess I have the answer. :)

I grew up in the city so I stayed with my mom! Sorry I know that’s not the most helpful thing for people coming from outside New York to have surgery.

Yeah, my own parents have offered to let me stay at their place to recover from surgery...said place is in Ohio, and they&#39;ve made it clear that the logistics for Mount Sinai are already rather difficult. :/
</p>
<p>
Good news is that there are still lots of options within fewer hours of home, but still.

Ooooh that makes a lot of sense
</p>
<p>
Hm tips huh
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Make sure you stay home for the bowel cleanse, it’s a day long thing and it’s absolutely horrible. Get some video games or movies to watch while you do it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Buy wet wipes for after, regular tp is Gonna hurt
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Listen to your body above all else, if something feels wrong it probably is. By the same token if something feels right it’s probably okay.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Stock up on pads. I like Kotex they’re v soft. Prepare for some gross discharge
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I lost a lot of weight right after surgery and I was already fairly slim, make sure to eat a lot after to gain back lost weight and keep your body healthy and energetic
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fevers are common, nausea is common, blood is common, don’t let These scare you too much unless they become clearly problematic.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Good luck!

How often did you see Dr. Ting and the nurses after the surgery? And do they require you to stay nearby while recovering?

Seconded the four weeks, though because of my healing they told me I could leave after 2.5 weeks. They tell you you cannot be on your own until 5 - 6 weeks though.  I saw them all the time in the hospital, 1 week after surgery, 2 weeks after, and I have a four week appt soon.

Thanks for the answer and for the awesome post!
</p>
<p>
And while you were in the hospital and then nearby Mt. Sinai, did you have any contact with other SRS patients of Dr. Ting?

The only place I met other patients was in the waiting room of the clinic, I met a few lovely girls and one great guy who were tings patients, though we didn’t exchange info or anything. In hospital I didn’t meet anyone else that was fairly isolated especially given the single rooms

A lot of reading drawing and sleeping aha, spend some time each day trying to walk and building strength, lots of sleep.  I’ve depended in my mom a lot and I’m super grateful she’s been around to help because I’d be miserable rn without her.   You absolutely NEED someone for the first two weeks, no exceptions. You cannot function without another person taking care of you for the first two weeks. I’d strongly suggest finding someone to help you weeks 3 and 4 be it a stay at home nurse or a friend, but if you absolutely must you can probably tough it out though it won’t be easy. As you can tell I had bouts of fevers, bowel issues, intense muscle pain, and all of these are very common after surgery. You want someone to be able to help you through that.

Hey thank you so much for sharing this. I am having surgery with Dr. Avanessian in 3 weeks and this is soooo helpful to know what to expect. Quick question about the Peritoneal Tissue. Do you know where they harvested it from? When I had my consult, I was told they could harvest the peritoneal tissue from the scrotal area. Is that what they did for you? Or did they go through the belly button? I haven’t heard much about getting the peritoneal tissue from the scrotal area only from the abdomen. Thanks!

I honestly am not sure where they harvest it from. I know I have no visible abdomen scarring or anything that would indicate they cut me up anywhere except my vagina so I’m inclined to think it was scrotal. By the same token they could’ve been able to do it internally so it could still be from my abdomen lining.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck!
