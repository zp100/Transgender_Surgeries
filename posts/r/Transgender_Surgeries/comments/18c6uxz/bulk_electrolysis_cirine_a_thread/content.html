Looks good. Curious to hear about the dying of the hair; this is a trick I‚Äôve used on body hair that was ‚Äúlight but prickly‚Äù and which my electrologist has since used on other people, but it‚Äôs hard to see how you‚Äôd do safely on genital hair! Do you have plans to go back for more?

They make dye for the hair down there! &#34;Black Betty&#34; and similar products. Makes the electrologist&#39;s job easier because they can go faster, and it helps them be more thorough. Crucial for bottom surgery clearance. Definitely patch test though, because sensitive reactions to dye would make the skin much more irritable and make it even harder than normal to sit through a session.

I want to jump in and endorse Cirine.  I went there about a decade ago (when it was still part of Dr. Z&#39;s practice), and had a great experience.  I did 4 or 5 extended sessions (~40 hours total with 2 technicians, so equal to ~80 hours) and had excellent results.  It made such a huge and immediate difference in the early years of my transition.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had other electrolysis done, usually 1-2 hour sessions, with at least 3 different technicians, and the Cirine staff are by far the best.  Not only do they do large scale work, but they are more efficient.  I would estimate that Cirine staff removed 33-50% more hair per hour than the other technicians I visited.

A couple days. I would usually do it on Friday/Saturday and was fine for work by Monday. Though I&#39;d have to cover up the injection bruises from Dr. Z&#39;s aggressive pain injections.

wish more places offered anesthetic like you had; would make little to no pain possible. Did insurance cover this or did you have to pay for it yourself?

I had to pay out of pocket and am submitting to insurance.  We will see what gets covered but some coworkers have had good luck with getting it covered.

It looks like you had a lot of dark hair still that Laser should have gotten rid of.  Did you try or just said screw it and just go for electrolysis? I wasn&#39;t lucky enough to have dark hair plus I&#39;m 56yo and part of my face was white. I did manage to get my bottom surgery area all electrolysis and Done, it took every Thursday for a little over a year.  I still have another 18 months on face.

The dark hair around the mouth did not respond to laser/did not stay dead.  Apparently I‚Äôm really good at growing hair there
</p>
<p>
My local tech for electrolysis was doing 2h a week for bottom and I just couldn‚Äôt take it and she said I could not go down to one hour.
</p>
<p>
This will be 4-5 total sessions 10 weeks apart. Cost is more per service hour but as others have said they are very efficient and fast plus it‚Äôs basically painless.
</p>
<p>
My concern with this plan was one cost (we will see if my insurance pays and how much) but larger was how long and what recovery looked like.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs now two days out and I have a little bruising and some red spots. Swelling is gone and at no point was in any large amount of pain.

That&#39;s just opposite from my tech.  She mostly done laser stuff and you&#39;d of thought she would have to go get her back adjustments at the end of an hours worth of electrolysis,  too hear her grown about it.  Lol she wouldn&#39;t do 2 hr for me at all and I never could get an answer out of her for why.  I think it was a steady money booking thing. I mean I seen her weekly for over a year.
<br>
I told her that I am going to have to go under too have my face done all at once.  I can&#39;t grow it out the 4 days out of the week and look at myself.  I just will shave every day before I put myself through that.

Question have you gone back since for another session? And did you do genitals and face the same day? And they did both in 7 hours?

Nice! I can‚Äôt wait to start mine. Laser has done a lot but the remaining shadow clocks me every time. When they do numbing shots, they put a needle in all of your parts down there when doing electrolysis? That sounds scary AF

No scars of note. Skin takes a beating. Do the recommended skincare routine it helps significantly.

Thank you for this thread! I had a couple of questions as I am looking into booking Cirine now:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Do you remember the general cost per session, and did you end up having insurance reimburse any?
</li>
<li>
How many sessions do you think you will need on your face? I am 16 sessions of IPL laser in (no electrolysis yet) and have a few small stubborn areas but probably only a little less than your starting point in these photos.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thank you so much and congrats on the great work!

Which location did you go to (Chicago or Wilmette)? I&#39;ve been working up the courage to do a bulk removal. Doing it 1 or 2 hours at a time feels like it will never end!

I doubt dying works for laser as you go in clean shaven.
</p>
<p>
It did a lot but some came back around the mouth and I had a bunch of grays.

You can&#39;t really dye the root of the hair follicle, and that&#39;s what the laser targets. Dying the hair after it is out of the skin doesn&#39;t help anything for laser.
