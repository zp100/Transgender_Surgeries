It is both true there is someone here with a vendetta against him and that he has many bad reviews.    I might rule out Facial Team for cost, but rule in a Thai or South Korean surgeon -- of course, I&#39;m in the US, so a European surgeon would have to have quite a lot to recommend them for me to go there.

I went to Raphael for my chin and trach. I wouldn’t say he botched me but his results kind of seemed like an amateur surgeon, especially after seeing the ct scans after.
</p>
<p>
He also did no scans of my face prior which could have caused serious problems. He only talked to me for like 2 minutes total, and while consulting with other surgeons for my brow and nose I realized how shitty his whole process was. I don’t feel like he cared very much about getting the best result. I’m going with Baez in a few days for nose and brow (Baez is amazing with noses), and the difference in the meticulousness and attention to detail is night and day with Raphael.
</p>
<p>
If you’re looking to pay through insurance, it might be difficult because he is in Mexico. If you really want to pay with insurance I’d recommend Regina Rodman in Houston or Mardirossian in Florida. Their results are great and they’re still not “famous” enough so that it takes a year to get in like keo. I liked them but went with Baez because it’s much cheaper in Mexico out of pocket (I live in a shithole state that doesn’t have any insurance that covers ffs) and his noses are top notch.

Hey, I just had a consultation with Dr Peter Raphael. I&#39;m confident with him doing my brown bone and everything else but I think youre right about your chin and the chin work he&#39;s done on other girls. Can I ask when he did you chin? Maybe it&#39;s still healing? But yeah I don&#39;t know why he doesn&#39;t go aggressive with the chins. Are you going to get the chin done again in the near future ?

Raphael did my chin over 2 years ago. I had it redone by Guerrero (Baez’s chin/jaw partner) because the way Raphael did it messed up the proportions of my face and caused a problem with the soft tissue under my chin. Also had the trach redone by Baez, he shaved off an extra 8mm of cartilage Raphael left in there.

There’s quite a bit in doctor Bart in the wiki and it goes back a some years. He’s even made a few posts here.

Based on the reviews and the photos I&#39;ve seen, the issue with Dr. Bart is a tendency to be very aggressive with bone cutting, even bordering on overly aggressive in most cases. Notice that even one of the comments in defense of Bart on this post mentions that he damaged her mental nerve? I just don&#39;t see why you&#39;d have to cut so much all the time...
</p>
<p>
While he has happy patients (and I&#39;m sure the majority of his patients are happy) the issue for me is: how comfortable are you with even a ~5-10% chance of being botched or losing sensation, or having the over cut, double-chin look that many of his patients seem to get? Those look like the most reported problems with his technique.
</p>
<p>
What would totally rule him out for me is the fact that he seems to just do what he wants rather than listening to the women who have surgery with him. A recent post indicated that he did a patient&#39;s jaw even though she had told him not to. That&#39;s unforgivable in my book, regardless of the outcome.
</p>
<p>
Why only these two surgeons?

Go with bart. He’s the best in Europe and did many friends of mine including myself, someone here with a vendetta has some many accounts, posting without showing face or any proof (like surgery proposal etc) just because of high unreal  expectations. Yes he did damaged my mental nerve but after 2 years the sensation is coming back. FT charge 16 k for forehead alone, subtle work and won’t do hairline advancement adding another 7k for hair transplant. Just no.

You will only get botched and have guaranteed nerve damage or worst. Look at the botch stories and don&#39;t listen to his minions. If you get botched this people won&#39;t help you but delude you to thinking you are just imagining things. Never go to a surgeon with botched history. You&#39;ll regret it for life.

Well if he is the best then the surgery should have made you passable not more clockable. Also less is more for those already feminine. I&#39;m not sure who you referring too as too masculine to be feminine because I certainly don&#39;t need more surgery to look feminine and I only needed light work on jaw and chin but butcher Bart is just too incompetent.

If you go to Bart the chances of you getting permanently botched is very high. Once done you can&#39;t go back and unless you&#39;re from Belgium suing him is hard. I think this also plays a large part on his carelessness. Botching foreign patients is less threatening. Also when I was there he operated on 4 girls in one day! Other FFS surgeons do one a day only!
</p>
<p>
So if you&#39;re gonna take the risk by going abroad it better be a proper surgeon not a cheap wanna be plastic surgeon. Heck your local butcher may do less damage than Bart.
</p>
<p>
And I agree nerve damage is guaranteed with him. My nerve canals are destroyed based on my CT scans.
