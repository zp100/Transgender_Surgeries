Oh that&#39;s awesome! A trans person posted in his fb group recently as well! I&#39;m having ft ba in 2 weeks though not with bednar. How many CC was he able to put into each breast? Are you planning on a second round ? I consulted with him but ultimately did not go with him.

He did 525ml for eachso like a half liter in each breast then added about 230ml to my hips whichhid some indentations which really went a long way for me.  The fat was all removed from my flanks so that made the results of both upper and lower really stand out.  I should note i was already 34c so i had a bit to work with. I lost at least 3 inclmhes off my waist though.  He also released the shape of my areolas which had been complicated by constricted milk ducts.  I am increibly happy with the result so far and he expecys me to only lose about 20%.
</p>
<p>
He mentioned that i think hes only done two trans women before me but he was very friendly and everyone in the staff was absolutely lovely and respectful to me even though i am not whole in certain places.  It might be worth mentioning you do need to be naked for preops and the operation itself but no one had a problem with working with a trans patient, despite breast fat seeming to be pretty rare for trans women compared to implants.
</p>
<p>
I highly recommend more trans women. Do this than implants because its your own fat and theres no risk of implants breaking or anything like that.  The size increase is limited but im very happy with the result.  Id never be down on someone for getting implants but i just want to prove this is a good option for us.

Congrats! Yes, I’d also love to hear more about the breast fat transfer process. I’m considering this over implants.  Can you provide any details about the process of preparing for the procedure? From what you can tell, do the the results meet your expectations?

Im very happy with the results and was immediately. I fully expected post op depression bit i am just so happy that i dont have time for it.  It did hurt a lot and the drugs messed me up but im ok with that if it means im pretty.
</p>
<p>
On preparation you dont need to do a lot beforehand. I had to come off alcohol and hrt for a week or two.  I was 165 and a 34c and they were able to move 525ml into each  breast and about 400ml into my hips to smooth out the line frlm my waist to my thighs.  I will likely retain 380ml in each breast, im not sure what cup i am now but my old bras wont fit. I only had one preop the day before ( i mean plus the consult). You do need to be ok with being totally naked and having photos taken, that was a bit embarrassing.  But the staff was kind and never treated me different when i didnt have clothes and makeup on.
</p>
<p>
If you had other questions let me know.  Implants really sketched me out even though they are very surfire to get an exact shape, i dont like the idea of having to replace them.. bft is 100% real tissue and what survives the first 3 months that last forever after. The recovery has been a bit hard cause i do have to wear a special bodysuit (i meam any faja would probably work) for a month to protect the lipo sites and have to stick to unlined bras for 3 months, but my chest is now larger than it was with a push up bra on before, so not a problem.

full disclosure, its incredibly painful, but they put me on hydrocodone which is a narcotics so i was asleep and laid down when i was awake most of the last week. they do want you up and walking around and with the narcotic its easy to but once it wears off the first few days are bad. im about 5 days out now, and it hurts but im off of all pain killers and can mostly walk around and drive, but like im not running or able to play volleyball or DDR again yet. I can however sit her eon reddit and get up to pee and get my clothes back on painlessly when im done which is really nice lol
</p>
<p>
whats good is the breasts and legs are totally painless today on day 5

Great data, thank you! Doing breast augmentation and some body sculpting on December 14th. But juuuust completed Facial Feminization Surgery on October 13th and I’m trying to see if I should limit my next surgery a bit to deal with face healing. Sounds prreeeeety bad, but no worse than FFS.

well i meant to do FFS first but because of the travel ban my plans got messed up and now im planning to do FFS second. im basically you but reverse :) haha
</p>
<p>
my new date is currently on january for FFS but i might actually move it  out so i give myself a good 4 or 5 months of healing so my body isn&#39;t trying to recover from two major ops at once.  While you are stable and shouldnt see loss at 3 months , 6 months is when the fat is basically completely done healing. it&#39;s been recommended to me to do the next operation sometime in the 4 to 6 month area to reduce stress on me.

I&#39;ve a few questions.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the incredibly painful bit, did they refuse to give you any more hydrocodone? I&#39;m not a fan of pain, especially incredible pain. Did you ask offer any other painkillers?
</p>
<p>
Any plans for a second round?
</p>
<p>
How did you find North Carolina? I&#39;m Australian and it doesn&#39;t sound a very safe place to visit if you&#39;re trans. I&#39;d not consider it, except that Dr Bednar seems to be such an incredible surgeon for this procedure.
</p>
<p>
Did you do any fat transfer to your face/lips at the same time?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d appreciate it if you could post an update in a few months and a year or so to let us know the long term results.

<p>
They gave me 20 tablets. I only took around 8 before stopping.  To answer your question though, if you use it all or lose it, you Cannot get more. it&#39;s an extremely controlled narcotic and I wasn&#39;t even allowed to fill that prescription in my home state.
</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
Yes they also gave me gabapentin and vallium. I didn&#39;t use either though (though you are required to take gabapentin the day before and hydrocodone the day of.) also you&#39;re allowed to take as much acetomedophin (tylenol) as you want, but no ibuprophen.
</p>
<p>
all in all I could have taken a lot more but i do not like being on drugs because it knocked me out and i couldnt play video games or draw, which id rather do instead of sleeping.
</p>

<p>
I was originally going to do this than a BBL next year.  but the hip results look so sexy and cute that i kind of like the look I have maybe even more than just going for as much size as possibe.  I look like a real woman like this now because my curve from my hip to my waist is totally smooth and cute.  I also dont want to make a decision to do my breasts again or not until they completely settle.
</p>
<p>
One thing he does do is facial fat transfer which I  could see myself doing maybe in 10-15 years.  Basically im in my 30s and im good about AHA and anti aging products so people often think im 22-25. at some point you start to lose  lose elasticity though and when that happens facial fat can de-age you a lot and its also not terrible costly. I think its a more natural look than doing a face lift too. But I just dont need it now and would be stupid to decide to do it before FFS.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
Decided if i wanted Breast fat over implants
</li>
<li>
Talked to cis women online who had it done and found a reliable specialist, double check their reviews with realself and yelp
</li>
<li>
Consult with the doctors who seemed the best, and the one i liekd most just happened to be in NC.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note on this, make sure they are ok with trans girls. some were NOT and i did get rejected from other local plastic surgeons for being a transsexual.  Being trans friendly was not a requirement for me so long as they were aware and still ok with it -- you do have to be totally naked at parts.  Dr bednars office had seen only a few trans patients but they ere all extremely nice to  me, no misgendering and extremely caring and respectful as if i was a real woman, even after knowing i am pre SRS.They also were ok with my questions and concerns related to trans things, the anestesiologist Joel was especially kind and even went over what is different for my needs during anestitizing from a cis man or cis woman

I dont want to get too much into politics but its not bad.  ITs really not worse than anywhere else in america. I&#39;ve lived in CA and texas and you&#39;re going to get harassed anywhere if you stand out and if you blend you are going to be fine anywhere even if you dont pass.  Thats just how it is.  Yes NC is very red when it comes to government it actually is where the anti-trans bathroom bill came from. however We saw many rainbow stickers and such in charlotte on our trip and i didnt get misgendered or meet any rudeness at all the whole trip, and neither did my trans friend who came with me (both female). The reality of america is most urban areas there are LGBT people around and most people are generally ok with transsexuals / other trans people.  If someone is being rude a simple &#34;im a woman&#34; or &#34;im just here to do X&#34; is enough to disarm people.  If you get into a fight or get defensive with trans things thats when people get really nasty.  Just generally be polite to others and they will return the favor.  Also be smart, drive everywhere you can and defintiely dont be walking around at night.  The general rules for womens safety apply to being safe as trans, avoid local dive bars, dont club alone, dont walk streets alone especially at night (lot of homeless, you are more at risk of rape than transphobia), always uber or rent a car if you can afford it and stay with a man or group of girls if you can.  If you stick to shops, airport, your hotel, and the surgery, which you should be doing anyways becaus eyou&#39;re supposed to be recovering, you&#39;re going to be perfectly safe.  In the south generally everyone is friendly so if people talk to you dont be afraid to just be relaxed and chat a moment. it also goes a long way to disarm people even if they are religious or anti trans you&#39;ll get a lot of &#34;well, hmm, i seem to like YOU, you&#39;re not like those lgbt on TV i see&#34; or you pass and no one says anything about anything. the big attractions like nascar meuseum and mint meuseum are also very sterile and safe when open, however they are closed due to covid in the state. Another fun fact about the south is there are a lot of tall , masculine black and white women and the lack of lgbt people can make it easy to pass for MTFs. just another thought.  Its not like people are used to seeing transsexuals in the wild especially out ones like they are in SF/LA.  Also, there are cops stationed in most downtown shops so if someone tries to assault if you can run into a CVS or something they will help you.
</p>
<p>
Final thought though -- dont fuck yourself over, We deserve to exist anywhere everyone else does, its stupid to confine ourselves to SF/LA because its &#34;safe&#34;  . Dont miss out on a good surgeon you like because you are too scared to visit a red state. theres lots of good people, especially in cities where its more pro lgbt, who would be supportive and love to meet you everywhere you go.  Its not like its going to Dubai where youre going to get thrown in jail. Honestly the more we interact positively with people it will help future trans to be seen as normal and accepted because we are just like normal people.

Nope I will not touch my face until after FFS which I have scheduled for January. However that was an option as i said earlier. My face is pretty cute for male anyways but i do dream of having the perfect ffs nose.

The pain was basically gone on hydrocodone /norco.
</p>
<p>
I stopped because it makes you extremely tired.  I wanted to play games and watch tv while i recovered and talk to my mate, even if i was i. A little more pain.
</p>
<p>
Anothe reason i stopped is because like any hard narcotic it males you constipated very badly.  I was not able to use the bathroom for a poo at all in 6 days. Needless to say this os somehwat uncomfortable considering after surgery i was very hungry and ate a lot.  I actually gained almost 15 pounds when when i went in at the worst point despite having fat lipoed away because i didnt use the toilet.  When i was finally able it go it hurt a lot.

As someone who has been to NC, it has pockets of progressive spaces wherever it&#39;s more densely populated. For example New Orleans in Louisianna. It&#39;s a great place, but once you leave it, people aren&#39;t as accepting of differences. In North Carolina, Charlotte is one of the more LGBT friendly areas.
</p>
<p>
While NC was the place that introduced the first bathroom bill, there was a huge response from local businesses that made sure trans folks were welcome since the state had all eyes looking at them.
</p>
<p>
Unlike other horrible places in the US, NC doesn&#39;t have any legislation barring youth from taking HRT.
</p>
<p>
Long story short: urban areas of NC are fine, it&#39;s nothing to worry about.

Thank you for so much illumination! So, then you didn&#39;t need to wear that BRAVA system to get ready for it? If so, that&#39;s amazing--I&#39;d heard that that would be a requirement leading up to it.

Would love to see this because I’m booked for January and I’m so worried a bit I mean I don’t even have a cheat at all so they’re gonna try to form an A. But your saying that ur cheat normally was a 34 c? How? Did it grow out? Also not sure can fat be put under the muscle for more of a projection or is it only on the top where your fat is already is. But anyways happy recovery 💯💯💯

<p>
yes, im a transsexual girl so I had breasts going into the operation.
</p>

<p>
Also not sure can fat be put under the muscle
</p>

<p>
No unfortunately this is only possible with certain types of implants as far as I know the fat must be injected to an existing fat pocket so it can &#34;take&#34; and survive. you&#39;ll have to ask your sapecific surgeon about it though.  he&#39;ll know better than me.

lmk if i can answer anything else

Congrats first of all! I’m so jelly because literally the week of my surgery I did not know this procedure existed but was days away from my breast augmentation with implants surgery. It’s like the healthiest alternative! Hoping for a speedy recovery for ya!

implants is not a bad decision. theres still benefits especially in terms of getting the perfect size and shape you want immediately so dont feel bad. id never be down on implants and i  wish washed for years until i finally committed to this. if you ever do need to  remove implants this is always an option thats on the table too.

Congrats!!! Was your procedure covered by insurance at all? Or did you pay entirely out of pocket for it?

lol nope &#34;cosmetic&#34; i have UHC and they do not even cover my pills, all they covered was SRS. ironically my plan does cover top surgery for FTM, which for my case this is literally the MTF equal of for me.

Sexism.  Love it!
</p>
<p>
I paid cash, cause due to some things i dont want to get into im in a good position this year, however, this was prohibitively expensive to me before this year, which is why im doing this now instead of earlier in my life.  I do feel guilty that I did because i know my past self would me jealous/ upset it wasnt possible before.  how inconvenient this happened all in the year of corona.

11.5k, just a smidge more than BA but less than BA + lipo would have been separately.  plus hotels and flights too since i travels to do it. IT will be different depending on your needs though.

I got an email from him for the price, it states:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#34; The fee for fat transfer to the breasts is $11,595, including  anesthesia, two sets of compression garments, and a comprehensive  surgery kit to help mitigate swelling and bruising, as well as help with  lightening incisions. &#34;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Furthermore:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is a 50% deposit required to secure the surgery date with a remainder due at pre-op.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They said nothing about insurance coverage. But they do offer no-interest payments with a third-party service. So you&#39;d be paying them ~$966/mo for a year. The interest rate after a year is pretty steep.

I know they aren&#39;t in network with any place and have no experience billing but If your insurance will cover it you can probably go through prior auth and getting it covered at out of network rates. I&#39;m going through this process right now with my hair grafts.
