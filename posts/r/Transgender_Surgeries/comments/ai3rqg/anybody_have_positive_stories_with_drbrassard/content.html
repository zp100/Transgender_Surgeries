I had my op in 2005. Results are good. Not perfect, not amazing. But pretty darn good. Except that I have hair inside my vagina so get rid of that before op. Labia, inner and outer, not 10/10 but 7-8/10, close enough and when I compare to other girls from other surgeons, I consider myself lucky. Orgasm amazing, sensations out of this world. No complications.

Brassard does more surgeries than most other surgeons.  I know about 3 dozen people personally who been to Brassard. Couple had complications that probably would have happened anywhere, and 1 unhappy with the look and is fighting for a revisions. Otherwise everyone else is quite happy.
</p>
<p>
I think some people have unrealistic expectations - especially within the first year. Don&#39;t base your decision off of someone who recently had surgery and only knows the short term. They&#39;re convinced that everything would have been PERFECT if they had just gone here or done that differently.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s not how the world or your body works.

Brassard and most doctors won&#39;t consider doing a revision until after a year. I&#39;ve heard so many people not understand the healing process takes a year minimum, sometimes longer, for the final appearance and that&#39;s all they care about.
</p>
<p>
A revision can be for cosmetic reasons or for health/adjusting when the surgery didn&#39;t work quite as good as can hoped. Cosmetic work you&#39;re really on your own, no surgeon will guarantee you the most beautiful vagina in the world.  But there&#39;s a bunch of cosmetic procedures available for post op/cis women vaginas if people really want to spend the money I suppose.
</p>
<p>
In my friend&#39;s example, she&#39;s just hit the 1 year mark and waiting for a consult this spring to see if they believe it&#39;s worth a revision and then who would pay.

Agreed, but I&#39;ve seen some people get quite indignant that they had surgery 6 months ago and it doesn&#39;t look as beautiful as they had hoped, and they want the surgeon to fix it immediately for free.
</p>
<p>
If you want insurance or whatever to pay for the revision, that&#39;s where it becomes tricky and takes a long time from what i&#39;ve heard. Pretty standard as far as i&#39;m concerned.

PLEASE don&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in the same boat took 6 years for me to save up, but i&#39;m not just being a negative nancy here, these are real stories and botched results going back to the 90&#39;s seem to be a consistant theme with him. Can you explain why Brassard has in the past legally threatened people for posting their botched results online?
</p>
<p>
If not my personal accounts. Maybe this person

<blockquote>
<p>
I for one am going with Brassard because I can&#39;t afford it otherwise

</blockquote>
<p>
That&#39;s not a good reason to go with him.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t judge by what people &#34;say&#34; Use your eyes. Is the work aesthetically pleasing, does it even look remotely like a vagina!?  Are people abnormally defensive about their results and why? Ask questions, don&#39;t settle treat it like a police investigation.
</p>
<p>
Do you have sensitivity at all? or do complications make more pain than pleasure?
</p>
<p>
For those who&#39;ve had botched surgery have you really considered the impact it&#39;s made to their lives? Not being able to pee, normally. One girl lost her clit.. just fell off. All Im asking you to do is to not walk into a suicide trap.

Don&#39;t have a tantrum.  You can do what you please.  We both have access to the same information, a keyword search of reddit or google will give you all the case studies required to make informed decisions.

You are literally throwing one right now.
</p>
<p>
Passive aggressive? First there&#39;s nothing passive about what I said. Second Aggression is only coming from you. But now i&#39;m happy to be more &#34;assertive&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Listen, don&#39;t talk to me like you&#39;re special. Like you&#39;re the only one who&#39;s had obstacles or sacrifices in their transition. The whole &#34;poor me, there for you&#39;re wrong&#34; stance is tiring. You can&#39;t hide behind that wall of BS that you can with cis people. Welcome to reality and dealing with the own consequences of your decisions, The entire point of this conversation is that you shouldn&#39;t listen to me, the question was &#34;Anybody have positive stories with Dr.Brassard?&#34; And guess what? MY answer is NO! Not based on &#34;hyped up and fake&#34; anyone, Infact they have names MAYBE you would like to meet them? I know 5 personally.
</p>
<p>
Your head is in the sand that&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t bury others truth. Don&#39;t erase them by saying they&#39;re lying or their hygiene isn&#39;t good or they didn&#39;t care for themselves, because that&#39;s a load. For what, because you don&#39;t like that fact? You have to take the contrarian stance against it at your own possible expense?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
but like the amount of bad posts regarding brassard are disproportionate (hmm 🤔)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are people attached to them all. Gee did you ever stop to think about WHY there were disproportionately bad? Do you honestly think there is some sort of neo-vagina conspiracy going on here? Because I can assure you that&#39;s just as absurd as the case your presenting here.
</p>
<p>
Listen, It sounds like you&#39;re in a very similar boat as me and I&#39;m very sorry that genital dysphoria is as bad for you too. But the goal of this post seemed to be about blunt honesty on the matter. Nobody wants to see anyone have a botched surgery, and yes we all take into account the risks and yes every surgeon has his or her off day. If you had 3 drinks in front of you and you were told that the blue one was statistically more likely to kill you and it was required to drink one, would you honestly choose blue above the others just in spite?
</p>
<p>
You don&#39;t have to agree with anyone in public but please please consider this more carefully. This Brassard issue is getting serious many reports over decades now, and I think we need to start demanding accountability on this issue. But the first step is visibility.

No, none at all. At least none from women who&#39;ve confided in me or have shown me results. I&#39;m starting to think, that the Brassard team needs to be held accountable. Met 4 women who woke up during surgery, 2 could feel all the pain of the operation and yet were completely paralysed. The rest had horrible looking labia, non existent, labia. The general area tend to look more wound like than other SRS surgeons. One girl who I know, has basically lost her vagina and her depression is worse over that than her dysphoria that caused her to get the surgery in the first place.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Complications do happen. With any surgeon.
</li>
<li>
Avoid people who&#39;ve been recently trained. Wait a year or two. I hear Dr. Banks at Suporn is great though. HIs results are coming in and they look great. Also happy with chet&#39;s work.
</li>
<li>
Avoid, pitches or upselling from people. In Canada, Bassard is shoved down your throat. My endo even went as far as after a year to auto book my srs consultaion. Without asking me... I was like no. My body remember?
</li>
<li>
Plastic surgery is an art. You don&#39;t want a surgeon, you want an artist. DO NOT CHEAP OUT. There&#39;s no going back.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Having said that, I would like to see good results from him. Aesthetically or functionally. Actually please please someone show me.
</p>
<p>
Lastly. This is a touchy subject, You&#39;re likely not going to get truth from many people who&#39;ve had srs. Many girls secretly lie about the results they get if they didn&#39;t get what they were expecting. How else do you explain the baffling lack of trans post op porn? You would think after finally having the body of your dreams you would want to show it off?
</p>
<p>
Human psychology reveals everything, that&#39;s why I look for body language when I ask people who they&#39;re results go. You will know right away if someones not being forward with you.
</p>
<p>
Sorry if this topic is well.... BLUNT. But I feel we need to start raising standards for care for transwomen and the only way to do that is to be honest about the healthcare we are receiving.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t tell you what to do. But If I was booked with him i&#39;d cancel, only two surgeons i&#39;ve seen any wow work from have been Supron or Chet.

Your point #2 about avoiding surgeons who have been recently trained is important.  The thing is, every surgeon early in his career is going to have a &#34;recently trained&#34; period of time.  Inevitably, no matter how innately talented a surgeon is, he&#39;s going to have a higher chance of making mistakes during his learning years.  Eventually every top surgeon gets old and retires; new surgeons need to be trained. There&#39;s no getting around that.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the people who have lots of money are the ones who get to pick and choose the best surgeons.  The ones who are poor or are relying on insurance have fewer options and end up &#39;helping&#39; the newer surgeons gain more experience.  Being poor sucks.

When I went it was a ballance of finding someone who was new enough to be up on the latest techniques and had been doing it long enough to be proficient. I met with 4 of the 5 surgeons in the US at the time. The one I didn&#39;t only did a few a year, dubbed non-proficient. For my time period it was Meltzer. Sometimes saving more $ for a better surgeon can be a good move. You&#39;ve got one chance at this, choose wisely.

Yeah, it&#39;s really painful when people in our community &#34;RUB in&#34; the surgeries that they get. I think it should be a generalized fopaux, just keep that info to yourself. I&#39;ve finally managed to save enough for SRS took me 6 years. Seeing other girls be able to finish their transition in like a year while I was basically stuck due to lack of support was very hard.

Brassard is pushed down our throats because he&#39;s literally the only option in Canada... There is going to be GRS in B.C. this year so my choices are Brassard or someone brand new.

I&#39;m late to the party but I had to create an account for this. I had my surgery with Dr. Brassard two years ago and I have nothing bad to say about my surgery. Perfectly sysmetrical, barely visible scar, fully orgasmic both vaginally and through clitoris stimulation six weeks after my surgery and I had an amazing experience post-surgery with his recovery home and the nurses.

Everytime I read someone online that had a bad experience, they don&#39;t say it directly but by reading their stories I know that they didn&#39;t follow to the letter the recovery guide given after the surgery. I see stuff like &#34;I went back to work or the gym after 3 weeks&#34; &#34;I didn&#39;t do as many baths and cleaning as recommended&#34; and so on. It seems that Brassard&#39;s technique could be leaving you more exposed to infection and with a slower recovery to help with the sensations and nerves recovery.
