Had anybody had bottom surgery at the  Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota?
<br>
Anything good or bad, or normal to report about them?

I have a number of friends that have had surgery at the Mayo and results are very very mixed. From catastrophic (far too many for my liking) to ok. They will not show you results of previous surgeries, so you get nothing to judge their work. Their aftercare also has much to be desired.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Nicholas Kim at the University of Minnesota did my surgery and a number of other friends. His quality has been excellent as is aftercare. (I might be a bit biased here) I would definitely suggest seeing if you could at least get a consultation with him.

Thanks, I checked with them but his waiting list is ungodly long,because he is the lone ranger there.  Mayo has two surgeons.  They, and Kim, were understudies of Brassard.  The newer surgeon at the Mayo did some time in Thailand, and learned the newly developed G=Spot technique there.
<br>
I know both, the UoM and the Mayo system from working with them, both have their shortcomings like any hospital I worked with.  What do you consider aftercare, and what is not good, or hat is good?What do you think I have to question at the Mayo?  They might answer me, because i am a peer of the surgeons.

As for aftercare, Dr. Kim is easy to get in to see and quick with questions even after a year and a half whereas the people I know at the Mayo struggle and fight to get any aftercare after the initial healing period. This seems to be a systemic issue with the Mayo though and not centered on the trans surgery department.

Did she stay connected with the, talking to them through the patient portal?  For a stupid carpal tunnel release I had two follow ups, and another one each after one and two years. Do you know the name of her surgeon?
<br>
I know that one surgeon left a while ago, I don&#39;t know the reason why that was.

Late to the party but Dr Manrique did my surgery. He&#39;s the one with the G-spot technique. I&#39;ve heard all-over reports about his results but my friend and I were both happy with our results. I&#39;m 9 months recovered and have about 95% sensation, ~3.5&#34; depth (which is what I specifically asked for, as penetration beyond my girlfriend&#39;s fingers isn&#39;t a concern for me), and, for a man-made vagina, looks pretty much like a vagina. The cool thing about them is, they&#39;re all so different that how mine looks isn&#39;t a big deal. I reach orgasm easily enough, which was the scariest thing for me.
</p>
<p>
The only real drawback (I knew this going in, and am not surprised) is that Manrique leaves a little bit more tissue around the pelvic floor where the urethra leaves the bladder, because he doesn&#39;t want his patients incontinent. The tradeoff is that it feels a little weird when aroused. Not a bad feeling, just different. But it&#39;s all different, I expected it, I&#39;m not surprised, and I&#39;m not disappointed. All in all I&#39;d say his work is 8/10 in function and aesthetic, and his manner is 10/10, he&#39;s a wonderful and communicative doctor.
</p>
<p>
Edit: it has come to my attention Dr Manrique is no longer working with Mayo. Disregard everything I&#39;ve said.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, I see Dr Martinez in 40-something days for an FFS consult. Will let you know what I think if you&#39;re interested.

Thank you for your report.  I talked with Dr. Martinez, and he told me that he is doing the G-Spot thing, too.  I assume that his outcomes should be similar to those of Dr. Marnique. A draw back are the long waiting times, which got even longer now because of the Corona delays. I also checked with Dr. Kim of the UoM,and his waiting times are even longer, and nobody mentioned anything of a G-Spot.

Yeah, I imagine Martinez is a little backed up with the &#39;Rona shutdown AND Manrique relocating to another hospital system. Still, it&#39;s impressive that he&#39;s not as backed up as the U of M. I really can&#39;t recommend Mayo Clinic highly enough. And for what it&#39;s worth, everything I&#39;ve heard puts Dr Martinez as more consistent with post-op results than Dr Manrique.

I am a patient of mayo for my other health care needs for over 30 years now, and i had one major, and several minor surgeries with them.  The major was a spinal deal, and I had to stay for a week in the hospital, it was St. Mary&#39;s.  Everybody was friendly there, but the food was pretty bad, and my partner brought food in every day.

At some point I read that he was a student of Brassard.  But all of them use the inverted penile method first used by  Georges Burou who operated  in Casablanca.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how much each surgeon modified this method, i know that Brassard seems to be the senior for this in northern America&gt;
</p>
<p>
I was not able to find any information to see if Kim is doing the split penile gland version to use the other half for the G-Spot, or if he relies on the prostate sensitivity to fulfill this purpose.
<br>
This would not work for me because i am not build like anatomical males in that area (and other areas of my body).

Are you referring to Manrique? He is no longer working for Mayo. Martinez is the sole SRS surgeon at Mayo

Dude what. He was on sabbatical last I heard, when did this change? &gt;.&lt; this means I&#39;ll have to follow up with Martinez on a surgery he didn&#39;t do. Dammit.

Last I&#39;d heard he was giving input to establishing a trans and intersex clinic in Venezuela. My friend said when she was there, there was a doc from Venezuela following him around. It&#39;s possible he decided to go work for them instead.

Thanks, I am also a Mayo patient for the last 30 or so years, and did some research cooperation with them.  I trust them as an institution, I just don&#39;t know much about their relatively new gender department.

I have no problem with recovery, because how to do that best is part of my profession

My partner (mtf) had bottom surgery at Mayo Clinic, with Dr. Manrique, who I&#39;m not sure is still practicing there at the moment.  I accompanied my partner to all of her appointments, and we were both really impressed with how they handled everything.  They seem really thorough - you have to have blood work, meet with a physical therapist, meet with a social worker, an endocrinologist, and the surgeon.  Dr. Manrique and all of his staff were exceptionally caring through the whole process, and I have nothing but good things to say about them.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been like 9 months since my partner had her surgery, and she seems satisfied with the results.  She&#39;s pursuing FFS with Mayo now, so hopefully it&#39;ll be a similarly good experience.

Thank you for his info.  I am a Mayo patient for about 30 years now, and I also worked with them on research projects, which means, my entire health history is on file with them.  This should make it much easier.  I am intersex, and I am already treated by the endos of the gender department.  The only unknown doc there for me is the surgeon.  If they do a good job, I feel pretty comfy with the Mayo.  I had 4 unrelated surgeries there before

Can you give me any details?  Anything I should watch out for?
<br>
I had an orchi a little over two years ago already, so they would have a little less work with me

Thank you, that is what I wanted to hear. I had 4 surgeries at the mayo already.  But all were done at St. Mary&#39;s.  And yes, the food is really bad there (by taste).  I have been told it is better at Methodist?  I have plenty of skin of any kind, because I was not circumcised. That is at least what Martinez told me when they did the big inspection of my ether region. Originally, I was going for the shallow version, but he told me it would be a shame to waste all that nice skin.

Im hoping my insurance covers a surgery with mayo being that my options are heavily limited by finances and being on hrt for 7 years is making me really desperate to find a surgeon.  I would love to have brassard but I don&#39;t think I could live with the wait time especially now with the virus and no border crossing. I had my initial visit at mayo the other day and I&#39;m waiting to see if insurance will cover it. I was a nervous wreck at first but after meeting the staff I became more comfortable and confident in being there. They mainly want me to work on dropping my BMI. I&#39;m currently 3% too high so I have to lose weight, get my letters again (mine expired previously in 2015 when I gave up after insurance denied coverage) and then wait roughly a year or so.

Did you meet with Dr. Nippoldt?  He seems to be a really good guy.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with getting your letters in with them.

Thanks, no I havent met with him yet. I&#39;m still waiting to see if my insurance covers my initial visit.... if it doesnt I probably wont come here again. The treatment and staff were great but the cost is insanely high. In texas I paid $400 out of pocket once every 6 months then year. My first visit is currently $2100 without insurance.... my gf had to calm me down because that instantaneously gave me a panic and anxiety attack.

Wow, that is lots of money.  My insurance covers the Mayo, I am a patient there for more than 30 years already.
<br>
I have no idea what their charges are.I hope your insurance will cover them, too.
</p>
<p>
Good luck

I met with Dr nippolt last week. He seemed knowledgeable but disinterested. He didn&#39;t really bring much to the table other than discuss seeing the surgeons soon to see if my bmi should limit my options being that I&#39;m quite bulky from muscle from the physical demand of my job. Everyone thinks I&#39;m skinny despite being 290 lbs.

I met with Nippolt last week again, and he was friendly like always.  If I ask for certain medications, he prescribes them for me.  I can&#39;t complain about this.  It might help that I am also a medical doctor, I don&#39;t know?
<br>
I was quite a bit involved with surgeries during my active medical life, and we never liked to operate on persons who were overweight, because of the danger that sutures might not last in some type of tissue, and a higher rate of wound infection can be expected.  I would strongly recommend to loose weight if possible!  It is up to the individual surgeon to accept or reject you for surgery.
