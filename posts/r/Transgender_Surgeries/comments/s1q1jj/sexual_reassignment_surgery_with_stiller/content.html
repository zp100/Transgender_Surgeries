So I had SRS Surgery with docter stiller in spokane Washington and iam so pleased with the results 100% I got 6.5 inches of depth  he did such an amazing job I was not expecting my vagina to look so good and he was such a sweetheart he also visited me  in my room a day after surgery and was so caring and sweet it was definitely a life changing experience when I woke up in recovery there was such a sense of peace and relief knowing I had the right external female parts and I felt so emotional and blissful of course I was on so much Opiods I didn&#39;t feel much pain maybe a little discomfort and a really tight feeling in my groin area whenever I would start feeling pain they would give me more opiods all the nurses were amazing and kept me so comferable during my stay in the hospital there was 2 drains inserted and it was kinda gross seeing my blood in these little domes i also had a Foley catheter so I didn&#39;t have to get up too pee wich was actually nice since it was painful and uncomfterble to walk but I was supose to walk around the hospital so I did as much as I could then I went to remove the packing and dressings after a week and they showed my how to dilate and about my new anatomy like my clitorus and lucky me a neurovascular bundle above my clitorus and after that was the hardest few days I&#39;m not gonna lie one of the hardest weeks of my life it was uncomfterable to sit and painful I couldnt go#2 everything was extremely swollen and that made dilation a little painful not as bad as I thought it was going to be I could pee 12 hours after they removed the catheter it was so different I also peed like a sprinkler the whole second week I&#39;m now on the 3rd week and am doing very well physically I&#39;m walking just fine even bending squating down I&#39;m even going back to work soon once my paid leave is over this 2nd and 3rd week I felt my first arousal and sensation witch was new and exciting and way different than anything I felt before sexualy I&#39;m looking forward to living the  the rest of my lifeðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

I&#39;m on Medicaid, so the process was a bit more drawn out. My initial consultation was May 4, 2021. All the paperwork and letters took a month and a half to get squared away. Once pre-authorization cleared, I was scheduled for Feb. 11, 2022.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there was a huge Omicron spike in our state and the governor panicked. He issued an executive order that cancelled my surgery. I just got the email that has allowed me to reschedule for May 13.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve waited almost 20 years for this.

Good to know someone escaped the disaster of Gov. Inslee&#39;s executive order. I wasn&#39;t so fortunate. My original date was Feb. 11. The hospital cancelled mine and a few others during that time. No exceptions were made.
