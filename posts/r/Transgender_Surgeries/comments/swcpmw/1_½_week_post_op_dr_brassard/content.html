Hey,  I had my surgery on the 17th, everything went well, I&#39;m happy with the results so far and healing is going well.
</p>
<p>
Dr Brassard was very nice and his demeanor was very soothing.
</p>
<p>
My journey at l&#39;asclépiade was great, most of the staff were angels and their recovery plan is really great, introducing new things every day which makes you feel better and better and brings you little by little to autonomy.
</p>
<p>
I got to say, the dilation regimen for the first month is excruciating as I have kids and my partner had both covid and lost her mother to a CVA while I was at the hospital.
</p>
<p>
One thing that is not talked about enough is the duration of the whole dilation process. They ask me to do 30 minute dilation plus douche plus either shower or sitz bath depending on the time of day plus 45 minutes air dry time. This brings the whole process for the first month to about 1h30 x 4 if I&#39;m efficient.... It&#39;s shitty... I can&#39;t wait to be at month 2 to lower that to 3 times... It&#39;s gonna make a world of difference.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s what it looks like at this point in time. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions.

Looking very nice! Dilation is literally your entire life for the next month, and expect it to still be the largest fraction of your day until the 3 month mark... but it looks to be healing up quite well!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
PS: Little trick they probably didn&#39;t tell you. You can make your own saline with bottles of distilled water from the grocery store plus salt. $2 for 4 liters. This is specifically approved by Brassard, but it wasn&#39;t in the booklet last time I saw. Way faster than boiling and all that.

Wow !! Your results are incredible !! I&#39;m waiting for my operation and hoping to also get Dr Belanger :)
</p>
<p>
Do you mind sharing how long it took from the moment they confirmed your documents, until you got the operation ?
</p>
<p>
Could you describe what I should do in order to prepare for this ? (Mentally, physically, logistics)
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much !

<p>
Hey, thanks a lot! (incoming wall of text)
</p>
<p>
So I had everything submitted by the end of June 2021. Then I was contacted in November to see when my available dates were. They had a lot of cancelations with Covid and were trying to fill some spot. I couldn&#39;t get one of those dates because they filled fast.
</p>
<p>
Then in December, they tried to send the application to the government nurse but found out I was missing a letter. Your GP is supposed to provide a 2 line letter that indicates you&#39;ve been on HRT for how long and that you&#39;re stable or whatever, so anyway I had to wait for my GP to do that but he was in vacation and the CMC closed for Christmas. When everyone came back from vacation, we send the application, it was approved in about a week and the secretary worked with me to book my date beginning of February.
</p>
<p>
So all in all, it took me ~7 months but without the fuck up&#39;s it could have taken 4.
</p>
<p>
So for preparation, buy all the things described in the documents they send you and buy more of it, you won&#39;t be in a state to go shopping when you come back, especially if you use opioids for pain. We go through a lot of lube fast so buy a lot, like a lot. You learn to use less as you go but they teach you to use a lot not to create a lot of stress on the site.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you have food prepared or that you&#39;re ready to order a lot, especially for the first month. It&#39;s really hard coming back from l&#39;asclépiade where they care for your every need to your home where you need to do everything.
</p>
<p>
Have your bathroom sparkly clean and dish soap in the bathroom so you can clean your dilators easily. You need to do it prior and after each dilations. Keep a dish cloth that doesn&#39;t create particles in the bathroom to wipe them. Buy Lysol wipes to clean the bath easily.
</p>
<p>
Get a mirror that has a wide base and stand on it&#39;s own and make sure you can make it stand in your bed. Mine kept falling, I had to use something to level it because my mattress is too soft.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you have a space to clean your dilators and the vagina douche every time you dilate. Personally, I wasn&#39;t ready and it made my coming home days really hard at first.
</p>
<p>
Buy some dove unscented soap. You will have to do sitz bath twice a day and you need to create like a milky soapy water for it. Any unscented soap works but I find that bars will not create little floating particles in the bath like the shower gel does plus that&#39;s what they show you to use at l&#39;asclépiade.
</p>
<p>
The recovery at l&#39;asclépiade will be hard physically and mentally but remember that everyday it&#39;s gonna get better. My biggest pain and discomfort came from the bandages and the stint that they suture to you, with the swelling, this creates a lot of pulling on the sides and hurts but they remove at day five and its glorious. Also, one thing that&#39;s super irritating is the hair coming back and you can&#39;t shave it but it&#39;s temporary.
</p>
<p>
The thing you need to keep in mind while all of this is happening is that most of the struggles are temporary. Like, dilating sucks, not because of the dilation itself but all of the aftercare but it won&#39;t stay as intense forever. After a month, you cut down to three per day, after three months, you fall to two per day which is very manageable.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you need someone to come pick you up and you need to have a small suitcase, fill it and stand on your balance, it should not be more than 10lbs heavy, that&#39;s your carrying limit after the surgery, any more and you risk to strain and put pressure on the site which can lead to major complications.
</p>
<p>
In the end, accept that you won&#39;t be perfectly ready, have someone on the call to get stuff from you or make sure to use delivery services for food, drug store and supplies.
</p>
<p>
Oh one last thing, you need to stop by your drug store on the way home to get your meds. Make sure you account for that with the person bringing you home.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Buy the biggest bottle of Tylenol and Advil you can. Keep taking tylenols regularly and use Advil to lower the swelling combined with ice (unless they prescribe you another anti-inflammatory, dont mix them)
</p>
<p>
If you have any more questions don&#39;t hesitate to ask :)

Congratulations on your recent surgery, you have a beautiful result and your going to be very happy. I had my surgery 2 yrs ago and i am very happy.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s funny you mentioned the stent and bandages because they where also my biggest source of pain too. It hurt like hell and i couldn&#39;t get comfortable that i was happy when the bandages and packing came out.
</p>
<p>
Dilating does suck as it consumes your life the first 3 months, but it gets better in time. we have the prep, dilating, cleanup, and douching.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t worry to much about the bubble on your clitoral hood right now, my clitoris had a lot of swelling too after my surgery. Wishing you a speedy recovery.

I know it&#39;s only been a week but how do you feel about the results so far? I&#39;m considering GRS Montréal but I&#39;ve heard really mixed things about Brassard and am leaning towards Belanger. But hearing your experience would be extremely valuable.
</p>
<p>
Keep us updated 😊

I actually love the result, everything is in its place, the scars are all clean and look like they will heal nicely. I have good depth. The only thing that bothers me a bit is the little bubble on the clitoris hood lining but I think that when the swelling goes down, it&#39;s gonna be fine and worst case it&#39;s a tiny correction to make.
</p>
<p>
I too wanted Belanger at first but the nearest date was with Brassard and I took it and I couldn&#39;t be happier to be honest. He&#39;s really nice and comforting. I&#39;m a very anxious person and I felt like I was in good hands.
</p>
<p>
But whoever you go with, the experience at the CMC should be great.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think that we don&#39;t hear enough of the positive experiences. A couple of people have had bad luck which I think we all know there is a chance of something going wrong regardless of the surgeon but the vast majority of the people that go there seem to be very happy with the results and the experience.
</p>
<p>
On the local Facebook groups, I&#39;ve yet to see someone complaining specifically about the Doctors. We do have some nonsensical stuff coming from the government coverage that have made some people angry but that&#39;s it.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I&#39;m rambling, if you have specific questions, don&#39;t hesitate, it&#39;ll be my pleasure to reply between dilations haha.

That&#39;s awesome. I&#39;m really happy for you. I have booked my surgery with Belanger. And I have the same feeling (albeit before doing it) that timing in the first time is frustrating.  May I ask your age? As your wounds look very nicely clean

Thank you, I&#39;m 44 and it seems being older has less complications. Those that I talked to and are older than me were very well. As you look great too. Hopefully my experience be like yours  One more question, did you stop your t-blocker right away after the surgery?

I stopped the day of, they ask you not to take any meds the day of but to bring them with you in their original packaging with the prescription note so that they can control what gets into your body combined with the pre surgery meds.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, last time I took a T blocker was the day before

WOW your results are amazing! I’m a week and a half out of my GRS with my surgeon here in Hillsborough NC , but my doctor was a little more in detail with my surgery. I was supposed to be in surgery 4 hours but was in for a little over 6 . Your results look amazing!!! I start dilation in 3 days
