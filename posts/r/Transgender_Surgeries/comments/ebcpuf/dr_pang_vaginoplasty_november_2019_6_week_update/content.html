I recently had the (

<strong>
peritoneal
</strong>
vaginoplasty with Dr. John Pang at Mt. Sinai.

I wanted to write about him as I found there was scarce info on him and his work prior to my surgery. I had confidence in his work because I saw his early work of another GRS vagina at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The patient&#39;s vagina looked so cute, there was minimal scarring at the hip crease and the clit looked &#34;right&#34; to me. It didn&#39;t look too big or too small.

Urine was evacuating my bladder normally. The urethra opening and the two slits at the base that are more red stung after peeing. These slits were left open after the vac was removed because they heal on their own after about 1 week.

Day 15 - The GRS vagina is at its largest after the surgery, so he was very encouraging to use the larger dilators sooner to maintain the maximum depth and width.

Yes, my clit is still numb but even touching my labia gets me horny! I can&#39;t wait for the numbness to subside in the clit and get cunnilingus :D

In a perfect world, I would have maxed out the FMLA leave time of 12 weeks. But my company does not offer full paid medical so I went with 10 weeks. Mobility at this point is pretty decent but my leg muscles have weakened from lack of movement and the loss of testosterone, so stairs difficult and Dr. Pang insists on me avoiding them. Avoiding stairs in NYC is impossible, so, I can&#39;t imagine going back to work at this point. Sitting is honestly the most uncomfortable part even with the donut cushion, I keep feeling the pressure on my vagina and I worry I&#39;m gonna split it at the taint lol.
</p>
<p>
If you have full paid leave or your financials work out to take the full 12 weeks, do it! Even if you feel amazing at week 10 or 11, you&#39;ve got a paid vacation essentially.

I also went to Mount Sinai at the same time you did and I’ve been seeing Dr. Pang for my follow-ups since Dr. Avanessian recently had a baby. He hasn’t been quite as insistent about going big on the dilators with me. I can get the green all the way in but struggle with the orange. I also don’t feel exhausted after dilating, nor have I ever had the level of bleeding shown here.
</p>
<p>
Am I not dilating hard enough? Do I need to force the orange in there even though it’s a struggle? I feel like I have great depth and width already since I can get all the dots on the green one but maybe I need to push it harder.

I am not sure why Dr. Pang is not pushing the orange on you like he did with me. I think it might be that he was not the one to construct your vagina so he does not want to push you too far and puncture? As for the bleeding, that was only the first week of dilating, I only have a drop of blood or no blood at this point.
</p>
<p>
I think the exhaustion came from moving to the largest dilator because there was a point where the green felt really comfortable but I know that the group of men I have lined up as casual sex buddies are bigger and thicker, so, getting this orange one for max depth and width was important. I did not force it but there is definitely a
<em>
stretch
</em>
that I felt when I was slowly sliding it in and doing the lamaze breathing that I remember from 90&#39;s sitcoms lol. Another factor that exhausted me was dilating through all the nerves waking up, it felt like my vagina was getting shocked by small quick zaps from the inside, by week 5, this sensation has mostly subsided.
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps! Lmk if you have any other questions &lt;3

He did say it was important to move up to orange eventually, so I recommitted myself to trying it today. I only got a couple dots in but I think if I keep doing it every session it should work in time.
</p>
<p>
I also have some very patient and well-endowed partners to consider 😂

Yassss queennnnn, slow and steady and breathe. I think full depth occurs at the &#34;prostate squishing&#34; point which I cannot wait to have repeatedly rammed by some dick, oy, I am already horny just thinking about it.
</p>
<p>
One tip Dr. Pang gave that was super helpful was if you feel you abs flexing, you need to relax it. I found that expanding my stomach to take deep breathes helped me relax to take the orange dilator.

I have a consultation with Dr. Pang super soon and seeing this was super comforting and exciting! Can I ask how long it took to schedule?? Like between the consult and the surgery date? Also your vagina looks so good holy fuck

Sorry for the late response. When I met him, it only took 6 months but then I pushed the surgery back a few weeks for work. Then it was all the laser prep done directly with Mt Sinai so not additional costs or specialists to find. Just showing up to the appointment times.  I hope your consult was a success!
