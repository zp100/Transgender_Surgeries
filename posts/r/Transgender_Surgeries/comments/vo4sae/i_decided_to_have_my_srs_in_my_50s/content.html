I want to share my positive experience in Thailand and why I decided to have my SRS in my 50s. (I’m Japanese so if my English wasn’t perfect, I’m sorry.) I’ve always known since I was little that I wanted to be a woman but being born as a Japanese man, I didn’t have many choices. My country wasn’t friendly with LGBT at all. In my younger day, hate crime against transgender and gay men happened regularly. As a Japanese man, if you’re nothing but straight then you’re a selfish freak. Growing up like this made me didn’t even think that coming out was possible so I just lived like how everyone expected me to. I have a stable carrier (I’m an engineer). I’m married to a beautiful woman and have children. I though this is the best I could do. I should be content and grateful for I have such a nice life that make many people envy but I just didn’t. Then I was diagnosed with dysphoria in my late 40s so that made me decided to take hormone for the first time. Three years after that I decided to take a big step for myself and spoke to my wife about my desire to be a woman. Even though she’s the kindest person I’ve ever known, I still thought she would be disappointed in me or even shamed me about my identity as a woman in a man body. I prepared for the worst to come. However, after I said everything, she said that she’s always known about my dysphoria condition and me taking hormone since then and she’d supported me if I wanted to have SRS. I’ve never cried so hard in my life. With her support and acceptance, l contacted and booked SRS with Dr. Theerapong in Thailand
</p>
<p>
I’ve been to Thailand before because of my work which made me know some of Thai trans women so when I decided that I wanted to have SRS, I contacted them, and this is the way I found Dr. Theerapong and Interplast clinic. Even though my friends said he’s great at SRS, I still didn’t want to rush to him since this is such a big thing to decide. I searched the internet and found more Thai surgeons that offer SRS. I read many reviews both from Realself and Reddit (Not from this account by the way, I made this new account so I can keep my regular one private.) and in the end, I chose him. (He also offers urethra technique which others did not) My English is alright in reading but not so much in listening and speaking so when I contacted with the clinic, I managed just fine. I known that I might have a communication-problem when I came to Thailand so when the clinic introduced Cosmopolis Team to me, I decided to go with them as they claimed to provide Aftercare and handle my liaison tasks in Thailand. I have to come to Thailand by myself because my wife couldn’t make it made me need them.
</p>
<p>
When I arrived in Thailand, the team has already arranged my ASQ and my Thai psychiatrist appointment. I’m glad that I didn’t have to deal with that much of paper works all alone by myself, but the stress started to get to me as having SRS is such a big step in my life and I’m here in the foreign land where nobody couldn’t speak my mother language. Cosmopolis staff made me feel a little better by being my companion and took me sightseeing in Bangkok. They also introduced me to some Japanese restaurants that I didn’t know before. It was fun but my stress just wouldn’t go away. When it’s the time to meet the doctor, my inside was a nervous mess. To be fair, Dr. Theerapong is kind of weird me out a little at first as I already feeling bad. He asked so many questions about my background, the reason why I chose to have SRS, what’s both my Japanese and Thai psychiatrist said etc. I feel like I spent forever consulting him in that room but at the same time, he gave me so much detail about his technique and answered all my questions without being annoyed or distracted. This really made me feeling better again. At first I wanted to have PPV as it’s the most advance technique but my budget’s limited so after consulted with the doctor, I chose the scrotal skin graft technique instead. (I didn’t care about depth because my purpose didn’t include anything sexual desire related; I just want to have a vagina like a cis woman. I also didn’t want to do anything with my colon since I’m old and I afraid my recovery wouldn’t be as good as young people)
</p>
<p>
Before the surgery, the team took me to buy dresses to wear for my recovery-period after the hospital discharged because I forgot to prepare it. (I never wear a dress before, so I didn’t own one) After that I checked in with the hospital, had my heath-check again and then the surgery happened at night. During the hospital-stayed, the thing that I felt most thankful toward was the pain killer since I’m in constant pain after a surgery and couldn’t move much on the first few days. I also had higher temperature than usual. Thanks to Cosmopolis Team, I had someone to stay with me 24/7 for all my hospital-stay. Even though I didn’t talk much cause I’m in pain and not in the mood for the chat but having someone with me made me feel safer and not as lonely.
</p>
<p>
After discharged, I stayed at the hotel near the clinic. Everything is alright and the pain is started to become more tolerable even my vagina was still swelling but the most hideous thing of all is the food. I don’t like Thai food at all. I still couldn’t walk/stand long enough to go to the Japanese restaurant that I wanted to. The one they had on Grab also didn’t suit my liking, so I lost almost 10 kg after surgery. I also couldn’t bear to use my money for food in the hotel since it’s so over price. Luckily, I had the mini mart on the opposite side of my hotel, so I didn’t have to walk far. I stayed in the hospital for 3 weeks after the surgery and almost every day the team came and checked on me. Sometimes I ordered food through them as well. They were so good to me except one time the staff threw my nutto away because the doctor said I shouldn’t be eating any fermented food and I was frustrated after that. I still tease them about that in the chat not long ago.
</p>
<p>
My last day in Thailand is also my last face-to-face follow-up day with Dr. Theerapong. The clinic’s staff tried to say goodbye in Japanese to me and it’s just so sweet as they were so friendly and never judge me since the 1st day as I look so manly in appearance. They always treated me like a woman, and I’m appreciate that a lot. The team send me to the airport and then I was back at home.
</p>
<p>
Now is six months post-op, my vagina looks great and cis women like. (Confirm by my wife.) The swelling subsidizes and I could almost walk and sit normally again. Before the surgery I always thought that SRS is the final stage to womanhood as it’ll give me my own vagina but being a woman is a lot more than that. Even though I still dress like a man and didn’t have enough courage to tell my children about my real identity as a woman yet, having SRS really boots my confident and lessen my shame about being a transexual. It makes me want to express my self as a woman even more and I hope that one day I’ll be ready enough to live a non-apologetic life as a transwoman. I have to thanks Dr. Theerapong, Interplast clinic and Cosmopolis Team for they’ve been part of this big step in my life but most of all, thanks to my beautiful and kind wife, my best friend and my companion for life, even though you will not be reading this post. I feel like I don’t appreciate you enough for such an understanding and acceptant of yours. Thank you for supporting and loving me.

That&#39;s a wonderful story, thank you for sharing. I hope one day you&#39;ll be able to socially transition and tell your children and friends/coworkers/etc too. You have good English too—there are a few mistakes but it&#39;s perfectly understandable. Most English-first-language people can&#39;t speak a second language to anywhere near your degree of fluency. Congrats on the vagina :)

The earnest sincerity of your story, even though not in your own language, has brought tears to my eyes.  Your perseverance has been well rewarded and you are to be commended for your willingness to think out of the box, especially in Japan!  And to your amazing wife of unimaginable understanding and compassion, how fortunate you are.  Thank you ever so much for sharing your story and for the courage I&#39;m confident you have given others.  Thank you!

Thank you for sharing! I am 52 and have &#34;Cosmetic SRS&#34; (Limited-Depth Vaginoplasty) scheduled for a few months from now. I went with Limited-Depth because, like you, I don&#39;t have interest in using my vagina for sex and I don&#39;t want the more serious surgery involving my colon (or other parts).
</p>
<p>
You have a wonderful wife! I wish you the best of luck with the future of your transition. Specifically, I wish you the strength to be open with your children.

Congrats! I&#39;ve heard about how Japan is not the greatest for LGBT folks, it&#39;s good to hear you&#39;re finally able to start being your best self.
</p>
<p>
Wishing you a continued healthy recovery and for the rest of your transition to go smoothly.

Wishing you the best of luck from the US. I know that Japan isn&#39;t the most welcoming of countries for LGBTQ people. I hope one day you can be your true self. Until then, continue on your journey and be true to yourself.
</p>
<p>
I am glad you have a very supportive wife as well! :)
