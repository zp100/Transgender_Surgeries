Hi, I&#39;ve been searching online for information about the upper eyelid incision approach that Dr. James P. Bradley recommended to perform forehead contouring and orbital rim reduction on me for facial feminization. While typing in &#34;upper eyelid incision&#34; and &#34;osteotomy&#34; in Google, I came across Dr. Bradley&#39;s book! I assume that the techniques described on Pages 92 to 33  are similar to what he has in mind for me: h

. I wonder how he&#39;s going to be able to remove the anterior part of my frontal sinus, remold it, and set the wall back through my upper eyelids. I will ask him in my second consult, but I don&#39;t have one scheduled for the foreseeable future.

Looking over his website, my slight concern is that this method
<em>
might
</em>
be used/developed for mostly younger patients (think children) needing corrective surgery. If it&#39;s a technique developed for anything other than adults I&#39;d be wary of using it, our incision scars are not going to heal anywhere near the rate that children heal.

Hi, You raise valid points. I think that Bradley wants to use surgical techniques that he developed on craniofacial pediatric patients. He is relatively new to performing FFS compared to other other surgeons. I am tired of being experimented by inexperienced FFS surgeons. My first FFS was botched.

I’m all for developing new techniques! And who knows, some surgeons’ needlework is exquisite.

I no longer want to be a test case for surgeons developing their techniques. I&#39;ve been there and done that with other gender affirming surgeries.
