I am making this post in case it is helpful for the WIKI and also to see if anyone has any advice.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The clinic provided me the following information regarding the format of the required SRS Referral letter.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>
You have been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria - such as meeting DSM-5 criteria for Gender Dysphoria or F64.0, ICD-11
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
You are good candidate for SRS or SRS is indicated for you or SRS is the recommended treatment for you or SRS is medically necessary for you
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
You have been socially transitioned and living full-time as a woman in all aspects of life for at least 12 months (RLT) – Please be specific on your start period
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
You have been undertaking Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for at least 1 year for Male to Female – Please be specific on your start period
</em>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I explained that I am non-binary trans femme and I present as a woman most of the time but not all of the time depending on how I feel on any given day.
</p>
<p>
This was their reply:
</p>
<p>
<em>
“Living full-time as a woman in all aspects of life” is our requirement to undergo the surgery with us. We understand your non-binary status and truly respect your choice, however, it is our requirements that clients must live full-time as woman and this must be clearly written in the letter.
</em>
</p>
<p>

I have read every post on the WIKI about
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/thailand/#wiki_chayamote_chyangsu_.22dr_bank.22">Dr. Banks
</a>
and I have read the entire 280 page
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fayd3p/srs_with_dr_suporn_pdf_5th_edition/">PDF
</a>
that a prior patient kindly put together.  I was very encouraged as I read several accounts from people who were able to undergo surgery even though they didn&#39;t present as a woman all of the time because they are non-binary or due to social/professional reasons.
</p>
<p>
However, from the responses I have received it appears their policy has changed or, the people who were able to undergo surgery without this requirement somehow got an exception via a process that is unclear.
</p>
<p>
I think very highly of Suporn Clinic. From the research I did, they are absolutely amazing, and I can tell they really care about their patients and have our best interested at heart.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this particular condition, if I want to proceed, requires me to live inconsistent with my gender identity in order to align a critical physical component (vagina) with my gender identity.
</p>
<p>
I am very disappointed. Any advice or even just kind words are much appreciated. I am feeling down today.
</p>
<p>
Thank you.
</p>
<p>
EDIT:
</p>
<p>
When responding to a post, I located a couple of the past accounts that I read from prior patients who indicated that the policy used to be different. I added those references below.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/eqvk9c/9_month_update_dr_bank_suporn_clinic/">Example 1
</a>
</p>
<p>
&#34;
<em>
There were no issues at the Support Clinic with the fact that I was not socially transitioned. Really, no difference at all in treatment and acceptance vs if I had been socially transitioned. It was great.&#34;
</em>
</p>
<p>
Example 2
</p>
<p>
This one is from
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fayd3p/srs_with_dr_suporn_pdf_5th_edition/">&#34;the PDF&#34;
</a>
created by the past patient. It is on page 239.
</p>
<p>
<em>
&#34;I followed this up with the clinic administrator via email afterwards and was told they do accept non-binary patients for SRS, and also those who’ve not socially transitioned for social or professional reasons.&#34;
</em>

The Answer is “ Keep Everything Simple “ These Surgeons want to hear your M to F and not “ Non Binary “ really even though it’s your right to have what ever relationship feels the best like being a Lesbian or Hetrosexual Trans woman post op - Suporn/Banks will not do revisions from other surgeons anymore - Things are changing in Bangkok covering their butts quite Frankly from complaints these surgeons are now seeing online done by other surgeons ( there being very cautious now , times have changed already said ) that have spread like wild fire like dealing with “ Kamol “ and his post op messes being created by wannabes Interns learning the ropes and getting scalpel time in the OR !

This is why I only talk with my therapist about being NB and leave all of my medical records marked &#34;female.&#34; We discussed this and she agrees with me that it isn&#39;t dishonest to distill down &#34;nonbinary trans woman&#34; to &#34;female&#34; for the purpose of writing my permission slips.

Tbh, if it helps you get the car you need, it doesn’t really matter if you lie. Like realistically we have been doing that for decades. Trans women would sometimes claim to be intersex in order to get surgeries. It’s not actually taking resources from people and it actively improves your quality of life. Recognising that we have similar struggles and using the system to get what you need to survive is just that…survival. I don’t see anything different about being NB wanting GCS and then “lying” and saying you’re a binary trans person. If it gets you the care you need, do it

Thank you for your reply. I can understand your skepticism and take no offense. I added screenshots of the emails I received from Suporn Clinic.
</p>
<p>
Is this adequate? If not, what else can I do to prove what I am saying is real?
</p>
<p>
My post history certainly shows I&#39;ve been active in this group for months, I think in a constructive way, as I&#39;ve conducted research on SRS providers and other topics.

I’m a mod here and I removed your post temporarily as I don’t think you should post those images. I’m not sure but they may be some things in there that’s not safe publicly.

Thank you for looking out for me. I removed the images.
</p>
<p>
So I better understand the safety issues, what was it you thought might be unsafe? As far as I could tell it didn&#39;t reveal anything other than my first name (Markina), which is also on the Reddit post, but I&#39;m a newly cracked egg as of a few months ago and I don&#39;t have a huge amount of forum experience so I may not understand all the issues yet.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for any advice you can offer.

The url, but I don’t really know. Maybe there’s something else. Best not to tempt fate as unless you’re an expert it hard to know, and there’s plenty of people on hate sites follow this sub.
</p>
<p>
If you’ve only started transition recently it’s quite possible you’ll change your mind as to how you want to transition and where you end up. Plenty of people do.

I second the suggestion to lie. The healthcare system and professional life are literally the only contexts in which people know me as male, and I&#39;m planning to come out at work at some point in the next few years too, so at that point it will only be the NHS that thinks I&#39;m male. I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m only there to get a penis, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m there to befriend the doctors or whatever. I&#39;m there for a purpose and if I need to be male for that purpose then I will be. I have been transitioning for a long time, since I was 13 (won&#39;t say how long exactly just to avoid revealing my exact age), and I&#39;ve not identified as male since I was 15 but I&#39;ve been maintaining with medical professionals that I&#39;m binary trans male for the duration of my whole medical transition in order to get past gatekeeping. It&#39;s worked and I would recommend it. You can present however you want outside of medical contexts and they won&#39;t know. They&#39;re not the police; they&#39;re not going to conduct an investigation and search for evidence.

Mirroring the other replies. Unfortunately you will have to lie. I am also enby/transfemme and ultimately I just had to suck it until I was in recovery and then I could return to my more enby life.
</p>
<p>
When you arrive, the Thai psych will also ask you some questions about &#34;how do you know you&#39;re a woman?&#34;. I simply repeated the question back to her. I would say the weirdest thing I had to do for Suporn was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum_test">House-Tree-Person test
</a>
. It&#39;s a debunked psych evaluation.
</p>
<p>
I recall making fun of this entire process when I was there, so hey, they still let me go in for surgery so clearly I am 100% a woman enough, but I think you&#39;ll probably want to just fulfil all the checkboxes to _actually get in the room first_.

Thanks for the reply! This is great information. So you literally asked her how she knows she is a woman? Just want to make sure I understood that correctly.

The purpose is to get surgery, not score points against the psych. What are you going do if they refuse to sign off on it?

Should be clear that the Thai psych and I did not have a very serious conversation and they were laughing through most of this meeting, yanno, read the room and make a decision if this is the time to push back of course.
</p>
<p>
I can be quite an obtuse person when I want to be, but I also know how to advocate for myself; I know what to say to gatekeepers while not totally abandoning my furious anger at being forced to draw a house just to get fucking healthcare.
</p>
<p>
Especially
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/5ndXnRN">when the clinic has made you, by law, draw a bad stick figure of (presumably you?)
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
She asked me “is your drawing showing you wearing trousers” and I said something like “are women not allowed to wear trousers? All my friends wear trousers, very rarely do they get denied access to healthcare for it.”
</p>
<p>
I am a very patient person, but if my GP had me draw a picture of a tree before giving me PrEP, they would deserve my righteous indignation.
</p>
<p>
Questions like “how do you know you’re a woman” are simply impossible to answer.
</p>
<p>
How do I know I have free will? How do I know what the colour blue looks like to you? How do I know that strawberries taste the same to you? I’m sorry but I’m not a philosopher, I just want healthcare.
</p>
<p>
So stupid questions get stupid answers.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the tldr is just give yourself an easy life and check all the “yep absolutely 100% a woman I only see the colour pink and wear skirts and I love cleaning up after men” or whatever, and then hopefully this ticks all the boxes to be allowed healthcare. After you’ve arrived and had the surgery, then you can basically go wild with enby joy 😅

Indeed, on an individual level, lying is the best option. However, it is this very type of transition storytelling we do with providers that created the myths around autogynophilia. It’s a shame we’re forced to do this as it narrows the medical field’s perspective on a complex community.

This sounds like they&#39;re covering their bases in case they get folks who are rushing and might try to reverse their decision and blame the surgeon later.
</p>

I know an article exists somewhere of doctors in Thailand having to do this once before

I agree. As mentioned in my OP, I&#39;ve read tons of information on Suporn Clininc and as frustrated as I am, I think they truly do have good intentions.
</p>
<p>
However, this particular policy ends up being exclusionary and I think a reasonable solution would be simply to leave it up to therapists to make the determination on whether a person is ready for surgery from a social standpoint. Sadly, that&#39;s just not where they are at though.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with lying, but I also find it ironic that Reddit’s favorite surgeon who gets treated like the best in the world is enbyphobic. There are many many many surgeons around the world who will happily perform vaginoplasty on non-binary folks
</p>
<p>
FWIW I’m lesbian and personally would never go to a surgeon who is homophobic and would only do surgery on straight trans women when there are many other good options available 🤷🏻‍♀️ (kinda in analogy of you being nonbinary and giving money to a surgeon who doesn’t respect your identity)

There is still a great deal of gatekeeping in the process and many doctors who work around these surgeries have outdated views at best and transmedicalist views at the extreme.
</p>
<p>
It was wild going through the surgery process after seven years of hrt and just settling in to being myself. It felt like my first weeks with my therapist all over again.

Unlikely. There have been multiple reports of problems from GenderGP letters for Thailand. There are other options though.

My understanding is they do provide letters in support of surgery though I do not have direct experience with them.
</p>
<p>
In my research I did read a post from somebody saying the letter Gender GP provided didn&#39;t meet the requirements of the surgeon (I think Suporn / Banks but I don&#39;t recall for sure) and Gender GP was not willing to change it for some reason.
</p>
<p>
If it is the only option you have though, I think it is worth a try.

I&#39;m not surprised.  I suspect that the Suporn Clinic originally had few barriers for accepting patients, but increasingly tightened up as it became well-known.  There was no social transition requirement when I first contacted the Suporn Clinic in 2001 indeed they seemed to be surprised when I offered them a doctors referral letter!  However when I contacted them again in early 2004 I was told that they were now using the &#34;Standards of Care&#34; guidelines (version V?), which included the requirement that patients live full-time as their self-affirmed gender for usually 12 months.  The SOC originally focused purely on transgender / transsexual individuals, but has been expanded to include &#34;gender non-conforming people&#34;.  I&#39;ve found version 8 online here:
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/26895269.2022.2100644" rel="nofollow">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/26895269.2022.2100644
</a>
. You may be able to make a case based on this.  Finally, as far as I know, Dr Suporn himself only performed surgery on transitioned/transitioning MTF patients.  Maybe Dr Banks is more flexible.

Thank you for your reply.
</p>
<p>
I have no doubt many have done that. I&#39;ve also read a handful of past accounts that indicate Suporn Clinic was willing to approve them for surgery even though they had not socially transitioned.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/eqvk9c/9_month_update_dr_bank_suporn_clinic/" rel="nofollow">Example 1
</a>
</p>
<p>
&#34;
<em>
There were no issues at the Support Clinic with the fact that I was not socially transitioned. Really, no difference at all in treatment and acceptance vs if I had been socially transitioned. It was great.&#34;
</em>
</p>
<p>
Example 2

This one is from

</a>
created by a past patient. It is on page 239.
</p>
<p>

&#34;I followed this up with the clinic administrator via email afterwards and was told they do accept non-binary patients for SRS, and also those who’ve not socially transitioned for social or professional reasons.&#34;

Just read this post as preparation for getting my SRS/GRS ducks in a row.
</p>
<p>
The Suporn Clinic is clearly in a league of its own—as many of us prefer their expertise. I suppose—among the loops one has to jump to be accepted for surgery with Suporn—is the fact that they have inelastic demand.
<br>
Heck! They could raise the price to a stratospheric level and have a hard time shaking demand.
</p>
<p>
And seeing as they have a proven track record—and are renowned—for making the best vaginas in the transition game, one just has to tow their line. And I&#39;m fine with this, as I&#39;m set on having Dr Bank correct my biological mishap😹.
</p>
<p>
Dare I write this here: But I&#39;d happily raise my hand to being touched by Dr Bank even if Suporn charged US-$100k for his services.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been living full-time for close to 1.5years.
<br>
And, yes, I&#39;ve done FFS, VFS, BA, and regularly get touch-up liquid BBL shots (every 6 months).
<br>
The only question swirling in my head is: Would my application (for an SRS slot) be overlooked for someone who&#39;s been full-time for longer than me—assuming all else was equal?

Hi, OP here!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure how high they&#39;d have to raise the price before demand fell, but I agree it&#39;s a lot. Like you, I could and would pay big money to go there. However, I do respect that they are managing their demand a different way proving a chance to those who don&#39;t have the economic means that we do. My impression is this is intentional on their part, just another reason why they are awesome people IMO.
</p>
<p>
Regarding your question, their lottery system is very opaque. There was a post,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/1got2zr/comment/lxm0op1/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
, a few months back that an in-depth analysis of what is known about the lottery.
</p>
<p>
My advice would be to find a 2nd choice, and if they have a long wait list get on the list, and while you&#39;re applying for the lottery, you&#39;re winding down the clock on the waitlist for a plan B.
</p>
<p>
Even if you are set on Banks now and willing to wait, trust me, you might change your mind and if you don&#39;t you can always cancel the plan B or ask that surgeon to reschedule for a later date.
</p>
<p>
I said trust me, because when I started the process I was of the same mindset as you. Banks or bust. I applied for the lottery 4 times (over the course of a year) and didn&#39;t get it. I think there is some prioritization going on and I&#39;m not what they are looking for.
</p>
<p>
After the last time I started giving a serious look to the top US surgeons and eventually found one I&#39;m pretty comfortable with - Dr. Ramenini in Washington D.C. I&#39;m scheduled for surgery with him this spring.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

Thanks a mill for taking the time to respond to my message,
<a href="/u/MarkinaGail" rel="nofollow">u/MarkinaGail
</a>
.
<br>
Your wise words of advice will serve as a beacon of light for my considerations in this regard.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also encouraged by your tenacity and strength of character in the face of uncertainty—as far as navigating Suporn Clinic&#39;s alleged* SRS lottery gauntlet in vain.
<br>
It further reinforces within me that, &#34;

</p>
<p>
I honestly look forward to soon finding a new post from you—in this Reddit maze—talking about how much you&#39;re loving the results of your neo-vagina, facilitated by Dr Ramineni.
<br>
Your feedback on his service may help us gals consider him as one of the artisans we choose to help us realise the physical representation of who we know ourselves to be.

Have you considered just... lying? What are they gonna do, tap into surveillance footage of the past 12 months to check? Like, I&#39;m a binary trans woman, but sitting here right now at home, you&#39;d think I looked like a man because I&#39;m not wearing my wig and I haven&#39;t shaved whats left of my facial hair... but when they ask, yes I present as a woman 100% of the time.

Yep, main reason to avoid Thailand unless you are binary, they still go by outdated wpath standards even though wpath 8 started including non binary people and dropped the hormone requirement
