[4 weeks post-FFS] [Dr. Francis] Southern California Kaiser. Frontal setback, orbital contouring, tip rhino (deprojection), contour chin. Happy with what I could get from Kaiser, but still feel dysphoria when I look head-on in the mirror. What next? Suggestions?

Personally I feel you look great. I only see female features but I&#39;m no expert.
</p>
<p>
Maybe time getting used to your results is the recommendation?

Thanks. The dysphoria in me would say the pictures are in soft natural lighting and don&#39;t emphasis the masculine parts I see lol ðŸ¥º

Give things at least a year to settle as difficult as that may be. I had FFS through Kaiser Norcal (the works) back in 2018 with Dr. Kleinberger and Dr. Shih. The forehead work was adequate, but I&#39;m now about 5 weeks post-op from revision rhinoplasty and jaw surgery along with a lip lift performed by Dr. Keojampa. I now have close to the results I anticipated the first time around. The jaw contouring (shaving) I had through Kaiser left things asymmetrical and pronounced 2 years post-op. Kaiser has limited capabilities because they refuse to perform sliding genioplasties and will insist you don&#39;t need it. My nose was still masculine as they barely did anything to it. Once your swelling all goes down (believe me, once you think it&#39;s all gone, there&#39;s still more residual swelling), think about exactly what makes you dysphoric and you can target those parts of your face. For what it&#39;s worth, I think you look pretty feminine already.

Thanks for the feedback, I really appreciate it. What insurance did you switch to and how long was the wait to see him?
</p>
<p>
Also, do you really thing there&#39;s swelling still in my forehead? It seems to be 0 swelling, I can feel the bone. And my chin is nearly back to normal too. I anticipated more swelling and a longer recovery, but it was very easy after the first week.
</p>
<p>
I kind of knew what I was going into beforehand with Kaiser, but I was pretty desperate to have any FFS after nearly 8 years of transitioning. Especially with Covid, I barely got my surgery in before everything got cancelled (it actually did get cancelled then uncancelled lol).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad I got it done, especially my brow/forehead. But now I&#39;m trying to stay positive and look forward for future.

I had my consult in January and had surgery on December 7th, so about a year.
</p>
<p>
I doubt you have much swelling in your forehead, but nose and jaw swelling take a long time to go 100% down. At 1 month you have a pretty good idea of the results you&#39;ll achieve though. I can understand being desperate. I don&#39;t regret having FFS through Kaiser. It&#39;s what I needed at the time, but I sure wish I could have avoided going through jaw surgery twice.

I would say you pass 100% but it comes down to how you feel in the end.

My forehead was pretty bad beforehand and now it&#39;s super smooth, but I still can&#39;t help but feel it&#39;s over-projected w/ my deep-set eyes? Maybe the limitations of my skull idk.
</p>
<p>
The other thing that bothers me is still my nose. They wouldn&#39;t do a full rhino because it was gender congruent, so I had to settle with a tip rhino for deprojection. I don&#39;t like my nose still, though it&#39;s better.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
I also don&#39;t like where the nose transitions to the forehead
</strong>
. It doesn&#39;t seem feminine at all, though I think that would be under full rhinoplasty which they wouldn&#39;t do.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Overall:
</strong>
I went with an &#34;I&#39;ll take what I can get&#34; attitude, and I did that, and I feel much better about my profile view. So
<strong>
I think my surgeon did a good job with what she set out to do
</strong>
. Dr. Francis is also very nice, and I would recommend her if you have Kaiser :)
</p>
<p>
But as far as dysphoria and long term goals, I feel incomplete. I still have a lot of dysphoria from looking at myself straight in the mirror. I wish Kaiser had more of a goal to feminize the face to reduce gender dysphoria, rather than only doing what they can justify as necessary.
</p>
<p>
I may have to switch to another insurance in the future for more work done.
<strong>
What would surgeries would benefit me?
</strong>
I&#39;m thinking Rhinoplasty for sure, jaw, maybe lips? Idk. I feel like my face is long and a little flat, and I&#39;m not sure what to do to feminize it.  Any advice would be helpful, thanks.

I think the nose, forehead and transition between the two are all fine and feminine right now. Your nose is a bit too upturned imo; since your face is long, the tip should not be too upturned.
</p>
<p>
The only that is construed as more masculine is the height of your lower third, which contributes to you having a &#34;longer face&#34;. The only practical way I can think of reducing the height is a lip lift + reduction genioplasty. At this point, anything else (lips, nose, etc...) I feel are just bells &amp; whistles.

You pass. The photograph in which you&#39;re smiling is especially flattering. One of the better results I&#39;ve seen from Kaiser and it will likely only get better with time.

It was a good 6 months after FFS before the final result was visible for me.  Just give it some time and things will keep changing for the better.

A few things stand out to me in your photos.
</p>
<p>
You still have a visible brow ridge. I assume you had type 1 contouring? If so and you&#39;re open to revisions I think you&#39;d benefit from type 3 forehead surgery.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t see that you mentioned having a lip lift. Your philtrum is still a little on the long side so a lip lift would help that.
</p>
<p>
You didn&#39;t show your full hairline but it looks a little sparse at the temples. A hair transplant could improve that.
</p>
<p>
Finally, your nose is still very swollen from your rhinoplasty. It could take up to one year before you see the final result. I think part of the issue is that the swelling is making it looking bigger than it&#39;s going to end up.

Thank you. I think I did have a type 3. They cut out a portion over the sinus and did something with it? I think with titanium screws

you look beautiful! please be patient with yourself, results won&#39;t look perfect right away. i just had top surgery and am also in the process of getting used to my body looking different now. you look awesome just one month after surgery, i&#39;m sure you&#39;ll look even more amazing as time passes!

I think your nose could use some refinement.  After that, I think itâ€™s just a matter of make-up and hair style.  I think you look good overall.

Mental health is awful, too inconsistent and weeks between sessions . But actually getting trans care going is pretty streamlined. Referrals easy as cake, your RN coordinator will take care of all that for you.
</p>
<p>
Surgeons for trans stuff have maybe 4yrs experience now? But they are experienced in plastic surgery in general. For example my ffs surgeon is a craniofacial surgeon and her specialty is fixing cleft chins for children.
</p>
<p>
I honestly want to switch for ffs surgery then switch back to Kaiser after. You might be met with resistance with procedures you want done. For example, they do FFS but might not approve nose, or something else because of their criteria of &#34;gender congruence &#34;.
</p>
<p>
Overall good insurance, but if you need serious mental health and more extensive FFS I&#39;d avoid.

Thank you, so much!! I&#39;ve been seeing FFS being covered and that by itself seemed worth the insurance. I had thought that many insurances don&#39;t  cover that, but I could be wrong. Is the hrt process streamlined? Is there any coverage for hair removal? Or hairline/hair restoration? I know the month health is meh there, but overall, do you think they comparatively cover more than other insurance? I know, lots of questions but I&#39;m literally picking new insurance through work on Monday with transitioning in mind â˜º

I don&#39;t have a lot of experiences with other insurance. Also mind you that I&#39;m speaking for California Kaiser. Other states have their own coverages.
</p>
<p>
Mine covers laser, electrolysis, speech therapy, ffs, gcs, trachea, breast
</p>
<p>
And socal Kaiser fights ppl on breast aug if they think you have enough breast growth. But there&#39;s workarounds.... like know which surgeon to go to
