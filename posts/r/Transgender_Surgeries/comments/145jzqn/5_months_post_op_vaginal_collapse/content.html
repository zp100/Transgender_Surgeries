I met someone at GRS while I was there for surgery who just got a revision for basically the same thing. Her graft didn’t take and so it had to be redone. It was also one year after her first surgery. This unfortunately happens, and if you want to have depth in the future it will need to be redone.  I’m sorry you are going through this and I hope it gets better.

Had similar issues at 8-9 months. I literally exceeded the dilation schedule. Was still doing 2-3 times a day at 9 months. I was little behind on moving up size but even my surgeon told me I could drop 1x/day. Woke one morning and couldn&#39;t get dilator 1. I speed shipped a pelvic wand that been looking at and went sec store got smaller one trying fight the loss. Got exam by surgeon&#39;s  PA and he said I need revision.   Basically was left hanging after and struggling to get much out her office now.  I&#39;m basically contracted to point where only much smaller dilator goes at 14 months.  Can&#39;t imagine PIV is even possible full stop. I manage basically a finger and just little more the depth of my pelvic want with a little work.  I just do what I can few times as week now.  I&#39;ll have pursue revision later.. I&#39;ve had really rough year + since surgery. My marriage imploded, lost and started new job, on just you know had major surgery that changed my life. That alone has huge mental health impact.  I do not regret surgery even with this result. It&#39;s not ideal but I love myself more each day.  Not that I&#39;ve not had numerous mental health issues. A life time of un fealth with stuff as well as current stuff has all come to forefront.

The complications I think accelerated existing issues. As things unwind turns out there some resentment going on both directions for us. Some of it transition related and some it various mental health issues/addiction(her) as well trauma and raising a kid. Its big hot mess and isn&#39;t limited to surgery or anything. But it definitely played a part.. alot repressed communication. She has been very supportive our entire relationship with being queer/trans and she&#39;s identified as bi-sexual since before we met. So it&#39;s not so much transition thing perse but more of execution of it and us failing to collaborate better. She apparently suppressed big resentment on being left handle our toddler in very early days of surgery. Had alot projected fears on my intent after.. that didn&#39;t want us anymore now that gotten this change..  the list things is growing as we talk more.

Complications happen to even the best surgeons. I’m sorry you’re going through this, but things will improve.

I’m confused at people mentioning graft failure requiring revision. My grafts failed and fell out at 4 weeks post surgery but I’ve still been using orange dilator to depth 3x a day for 30 minutes each. My surgeon said as long as I maintain steady dilation I should be ok and my canal will reline itself in about 8 months.

Unfortunately, this is one of the rare but possible complications. It&#39;s not the end of the world; I have a close friend who had a similar collapse thing happen due to pass-out-screaming level pain while dilating the first time (nerve cluster problem), and they got a revision that worked perfectly for them.

How did the nerve cluster problem get diagnosed and how did it resolve?

You lost me here. If you were dilating the whole time how was it closed? I&#39;m just not sure what you mean by it collapsed. Could you provide some more detail on the day to day when it all went sour?

Because sometimes the skin grafting just doesn’t mesh with the existing tissue it’s attached to and the body will just wholly reject it. Like sometimes when people get nose jobs, it can look perfect and fine and then all of a sudden just collapse one day, because the nasal canals decided to not wholly convert into a functioning unit.

Grafts always have a risk to fail, especially if you have certain preexisting health conditions like ehlers danlos syndrome.
</p>
<p>
I had a fun issue with a urethral mucosa graft bleeding  and having discharges for like 3 months after surgery so stuff doesn’t always heal quickly or correctly but it ended up not getting rejected and took and is fine now

I was given a 50/50 chance of a graft failing which would have led to this, though the way my surgery was done I should have been left with an inch or so of depth had it failed. But I&#39;m non-binary, had very little material to work with and agreed to the increased risks hoping to get the result I wanted.

You should go to Dr. Wittenberg for revision surgery, she is the best option to have PPT (Peritoneal Pull-Trough), or if you want to have colon there is Dr. Theerapong, Dr. Sutin or Dr. Stiller (the best option in the USA)
