4 years after receiving the cheap GRS Montreal SRS surgery by Dr.Brassard. Feel like I have a penis tucked in that will explode when aroused. 1:37 minutes SRS. The fastest guns in America.

Sis there is light at the end of the tunnel, another girl in this sub had surgery on 2017 and after revisions she now has one ofthe most natural results ever, she knows who she is but i just dont want to mention her name in case she does not want me to.
</p>
<p>

Hey gurl:)
</p>
<p>
Yeah look is one thing but in my case it‚Äôs not just look. It‚Äôs fixing this.  I did not get SRS to end up simply having the feeling of now having a penis tied under my skin.
</p>
<p>
So like constant tucking with added bonus of still having the erection feeling. Just that now I can‚Äôt loose it :( fml

I was experiencing this for several months after surgery. I think it was month 5 or 6 before I was able to get my mind to accept recontextualizing the sensations.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I caught myself experiencing, &#34;feels like my peen is erect,&#34; I would interject, &#34;No. This is what an aroused clitoris feels like&#34;.
</p>
<p>
While I recontextualized the terms, I also focused on mentally changing the positions of the sensations to match how they are now via imagination.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s how I changed the default contextualization of the experience. It made the experience of it feel natrual which was enough to resolve my dysphoria.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve flipped it back a couple of times out of curiosity, but I generally avoid doing so as it leaves me feeling dysphoric.
</p>
<p>
I suspect doing the recontextualization will solve this for you as well.

Thanks for your comment but I am 4 years post up. And even though rewiring yourself can improve your perception of it. It is also tie to the amount the of erectile tissue left by the surgeon and position of the labias. The pictures I have actually posted don‚Äôt actually do Justice to how bad it can get. This can go up more than 1.5 inches from the pubis. So I pretty much now have a micro penis. I can literally contract it and poke. There is no amount of mind  Jedi trick I can do to myself to make me believe that I don‚Äôt have a penis. :p
</p>
<p>
The reality is that when aroused i still have mini penis poking.

You could have a look at

were examples of a similar case (NSFW).

Hey your discomfort is of course understandable but I did want to point out that clits do get erect naturally so after revision it‚Äôs okay if you still feel that somewhat!!

Yeah clit not ending up having a 1.5 inch erect mess pointing left than suddenly twisting on it itself. Or when I go pee it can actually get to 2.5 inch.

It is normal to feel a throbbing sensation in your clitoris when you become aroused. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what you&#39;re describing, but clitorises do get erect.

No this is not my clitoris but my labia minora. There is too much tissues and about 2-3 inches of my actual penis tied to my skin underneath. So the feeling is like having a small penis 3 inch with a huge  amount blood wanting to filed it up but not enough material. A girl in the comment said she got a revision and it got fixed so clearly it‚Äôs not normal. I do understand that clit is composed of gland part which I obviously will have so blood flow.

Thanks for you comment.

I just had a surgery for depth revision with peritoneal tissue but he also gave me a labiaplasty because I had a similar issue (and I wanted cosmetic work). Now I don‚Äôt feel that ‚Äútucked,‚Äù feeling. It still gets puffy but it‚Äôs not like an erection. Because i know exactly this feeling and hated it. My labiaplasty saved me! I hated how I had felt.

Omg thank you so much. I just feel so destroyed by Montreal and everything they did to me.  Im so happy that you say you got it fixed.
</p>
<p>
I just hope the surgery I got was close to yours. Brassard use the urethra to make the minoras. And I‚Äôm super worried that a skilled surgeon might not even want to touch it.
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much for your comment means the world to me.

Yes.  And he doesn‚Äôt seem to think it‚Äôs an issue. Lawyers from Belanger-longtin told me it‚Äôs because he does so many so he‚Äôs fast now. Told them maybe he should stop doing some because he will end up doing them in half an hour. Haha

Good lord! Not sure what I&#39;m even looking at there...but if that&#39;s what you have to show for after 4 years; I&#39;d sue whatever doctor you went to! -- (no offense). Maybe I&#39;m an idiot, but I thought they could do all sorts of surgical magic these days! Not so much?

No, America is the wrong informal term people from the us use to refer to our country, the country is UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. America is a continent formed by north america south america and central america. Also this is not the best place to be silly FFS our sister is sharing her most intimal stuff

Hi, sorry to jump in but the name Americas is because of North America, central and south. Our whole continent is America.
</p>
<p>
But you do are right. I did make a mistake . I should have said fastest guns in  the world and not simply America. Lol:)

There&#39;s no need to apologize. I know everybody jumped in to stick up for you but honestly even though I know you&#39;re going through something, your title used humor, so I just used some humor as well. I&#39;m not sure if you were offended but I hope you were not. Everyone else seems to just need a geography lesson. I hope everything goes well for you‚úå

I always refer to USA as &#34;USA&#34; because I don&#39;t want it to get mixed with the continent America.
</p>
<p>
USA is not the only country in the world, get over it

Well good for you. The general consensus is that when you say just America, you&#39;re referring to the USA. Don&#39;t believe me? Google America and see what comes up first and foremost.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
USA is not the only country in the world
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But it
<em>
is
</em>
the only country in the world that is referred to as
<em>
America
</em>
. Furthermore, the phrase
<em>
Fastest Gun
</em>
is evocative of images of the American Old West. Let&#39;s not pretend otherwise. Also, see how I said the American Old West? Not the United States of American Old West? Because it&#39;s beyond extremely common to refer the United States of America simply as
<em>
America
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
Are Canadians American? No they are not. Are they North American? Yes but let&#39;s not even pretend that is what was being said here. If someone is American that means they are a citizen of the United States. It does not mean North America, and you know it. So stop with the nonsense

Canadians, Brazilians are all Americans
</p>
<p>
USians are also American because they are in the American continent, but not because they are from the USA
</p>
<p>
If someone writes &#34;fastest hand in America&#34;, I am going to assume that that person is talking about the whole continent until that person states otherwise, because thats what America is, a continent. USA is United States of America, not just America

Well then you are in the extreme minority of people on the planet. Anyone calling themselves an American, to anyone in the world would be perceived as saying they&#39;re from the United States of America. You are either being deliberately obtuse or you&#39;re actually that naive
