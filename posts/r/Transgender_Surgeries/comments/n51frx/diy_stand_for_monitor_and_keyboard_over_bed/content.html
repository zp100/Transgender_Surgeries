I&#39;m currently recovering from vaginoplasty surgery where I&#39;ve been stuck on my back in bed for 8 weeks.  I&#39;m writing about my recovery
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/m4ia2x/had_pptppv_with_dr_heidi_wittenberg_march_9th_2021/">here
</a>
, but I thought it might be useful to share my design for the DIY monitor and keyboard stand I&#39;m using over my bed:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/7tmbc6hat6x61.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b33371539c6efe6ca0d7ed49076b97508d3849a1">https://preview.redd.it/7tmbc6hat6x61.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b33371539c6efe6ca0d7ed49076b97508d3849a1
</a>
</p>
<p>
To build it, you&#39;ll need to get 1 3/8&#34; diameter pipes from a hardware store or fencing company.  Ask them to be cut to lengths: 64&#34;, 20&#34;, 20&#34;, 26&#34;, 18&#34;, and 23&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Order two
<a href="https://www.ysbw.com/Canopy-Fitting-1-3-8-Sliding-Elbow-p/2435.htm">sliding elbow
</a>
fittings and one
<a href="https://www.ysbw.com/Canopy-Fitting-1-3-8-Flat-Side-p/2405.htm">flat side
</a>
fitting.
</p>
<p>
Order one VESA mounting plate designed for a 1 3/8&#34; (35mm) pole:
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Single-Bracket-Mounting-Diameter-002-002H/dp/B074MKWPKH">option 1
</a>
or
<a href="https://mount-it.com/products/vesa-pole-mount-mi-390">option 2
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Order a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vision-Universal-Camera-Junction-Bracket/dp/B08DNCHRTY">pair of pole-mount plates
</a>
for the keyboard.  Note that I didn&#39;t test these - see below.
</p>
<p>
Place the flat side fitting under the bed, flat side against the wall.  Insert 64&#34; pipe straight up, two 20&#34; pipes along wall, and 26&#34; pipe pointing away from wall.  Tighten screws in the fittings to keep pipes in place but consider leaving the screw for the vertical pipe loose so you can swing the monitor if needed.
</p>
<p>
The 18&#34; pipes will form an arms for the monitor while the 23&#34; pipe will form the arm for the keyboard.  Place pipes in the sliding elbows and slide the elbows down onto the vertical pole.  It&#39;s probably best to have the sliding part of the top elbow (for monitor) point up and the bottom elbow (for keyboard) point down.  In the picture above, the bottom elbow points up but I think it&#39;s too much work to flip it at this point.  I attached a metal screw collar on the vertical pole to ensure the elbow can&#39;t slide high enough to let the eyelet screw hit the corner of the monitor.
</p>
<p>
Attach the VESA mounting plate to the monitor and to the pole for the monitor.  Because my monitor is likely too heavy for the pole mounts linked above, I used the VESA plate that came with the monitor and drilled a 5/16&#34; hole in its center.  I drilled the same hole in the steel pipe and put a 5/16&#34; nut and bolt to hold the VESA plate to the pipe:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/3qlcam2ht6x61.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a354e756088a21c8f01b76dfb4aac67809e9fa3">https://preview.redd.it/3qlcam2ht6x61.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a354e756088a21c8f01b76dfb4aac67809e9fa3
</a>
</p>
<p>
The dark grey stuff around the bolt is metal epoxy which I used to try to hold a metal strap that originally held the VESA plate.  It wasn&#39;t strong enough.  So I had to drill through the pipe which isn&#39;t the easiest thing.  It&#39;s best to use a drill press or a special hand drill that rotates slowly with high torque.  You apply high pressure of the drill bit to the metal which I do with a big clamp squeezing the drill against the pipe:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/wct5a6qit6x61.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9834e59630b08c14e32a00f009af5705d4a5aca8">https://preview.redd.it/wct5a6qit6x61.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9834e59630b08c14e32a00f009af5705d4a5aca8
</a>
</p>
<p>
If you drill in metal with a high speed drill and not much pressure, you will probably get through eventually but you&#39;ll generate a lot of heat that will dull the drill bit quickly.  You&#39;ll be lucky to get a couple holes out of it.  So I recommend buying the VESA pole mount I linked unless you have the right tools for metal drilling.
</p>
<p>
The keyboard is actually sitting on another VESA mount I was using for a second monitor.  I found that I could position the keyboard just right and secure it to the pole with just a zip tie and it remains surprisingly stable:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/yhsrh4nkt6x61.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=007bf204153b212cdbe014aacc087ac20b2f9719">https://preview.redd.it/yhsrh4nkt6x61.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=007bf204153b212cdbe014aacc087ac20b2f9719
</a>
</p>
<p>
This VESA mount is held on by the metal strap technique I mentioned earlier so I didn&#39;t have to drill through the pipe, though I had to drill through the strap (easier since it&#39;s so thin) and I put some scrap rubber between the strap and pipe.  I got pretty lucky that this actually works to keep the keyboard stable.  For a more generalized solution, I think using the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vision-Universal-Camera-Junction-Bracket/dp/B08DNCHRTY">pair of pole-mount plates
</a>
I mentioned earlier and a couple zip ties would work.  In that case, the flip-down feet at the top corners of most keyboards could hook over the edges of the plates.
</p>
<p>
You can also just set the keyboard on your lap but I always found that to hurt the abdominal incisions or my groin.  Or you can order a
<a href="https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/ebern-designs-garbani-laptop-tray-w002367081.html">laptop tray
</a>
with adjustable height but it&#39;s less convenient to move the tray to get in and out of bed and blankets can get under the feet and throw things off.  I find the keyboard on the metal pole to be easy to swing out of the way and easy to rotate to just the right place so both my hands are hitting the keys at the correct angle.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, that&#39;s my setup and I hope it helps others during recovery.  This is definitely something I recommend building and getting working
<em>
before
</em>
surgery.  I had to drill in that monitor pipe after surgery because my helper couldn&#39;t figure out how and it wasn&#39;t the most pleasant thing.  But that was only necessary because I broke a monitor during our trip and the monitor I bought to replace it was too heavy for the metal strap VESA mount.
</p>
<p>
Also, in the original photo, you might notice I have a USB light
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Dimmable-Switch-Flexible-Gooseneck/dp/B06XH9XR12">similar to this
</a>
plugged into the back of the monitor.  I find it to be quite useful during dilation to see how deep the dilator is because the room light is shadowed by the monitor and my anatomy.  You&#39;ll also see in the photo that I have a 10-port powered USB hub held to the wall using velcro straps.  The hub connects to my keyboard, trackball, webcam, and a USB sound device so I can set speakers behind the monitor and also use a wired headset (all my Bluetooth mics are too quiet or don&#39;t work reliably).

There&#39;s really nothing in building it that can hurt you except maybe serious carelessness with the metal drilling but drilling shouldn&#39;t be necessary if you use the alternate parts I suggested.
