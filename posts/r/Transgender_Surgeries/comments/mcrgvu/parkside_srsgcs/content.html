Hey all,
</p>
<p>
Just wanted to blog my last few days here recovering from GCS at Parkside in the UK. Surgery itself went well and I woke up feeling fine on Monday. I saw the early results and Miss Rashid has done a wonderful job.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, however, it is now Thursday. I have still not been allowed to move due to continued bleeding. This has resulted in changing the pressure dressing on my wound near 10 times, multiple gowns and even a direct injection into the urethra to help clot the bleeding - which by the way was the most painful experience I’ve ever been through.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, I required a blood transfusion due to blood loss on Tuesday night. The hospital staff are mostly useless and just left me to keep bleeding both nights.
</p>
<p>
Tonight, the fourth night of bleeding out, I have thrown up on multiple occasions, naturally making the bleeding worse. I am still being left for hours at a time between nurse visits due to short staffing and honestly cluelessness as to how to even help me.
</p>
<p>
I am reaching the end of my tether now, sat here covered in blood with so much pain and discomfort in my stomach - feeling totally lost and hopeless.
</p>
<p>
It may be advised that anyone waiting to come to Parkside for GCS at the moment should wait longer, as it seems they have bitten off more than they can chew in terms of getting the back-logged patients and the after care is shambolic.
</p>

Hi there Violet. I am so sorry you are having a rough time! I can only imagine how you must feel.
</p>
<p>
I have not had the same surgery, but I&#39;ve had several in my life. The common thread with all if them has been that it took twice as long to recover, hurt twice as much, and sucked 10 time worse than they said it would! If I may, I recomend that the first thing to do is take some deep breaths to stay oxygenated and helps to control panic.
</p>
<p>
If you are on any narcotic pain medication (which I hope you are with that surgery), keep in mind that will not only make you feel like throwing up, after a couple days of steady use, it will start to wear on your mind.
</p>
<p>
I had knee surgery where they did a nerve block. It didn&#39;t take, so when I woke up, I felt 100% of the cutting and drilling they did in my knee! I had to wait for them to pull the anesthesiologist out of surgery to give me a second block, and watched him stick a 15 cm needle into my groin and wiggle it around until they saw it was on the nerve. I wish I could have just blacked out! I never felt so alone.
</p>
<p>
Over the next week, I fell hard into a wall and then the ground. It bent my knee brace and after that all I could think of was that I undid the whole surgery, which gave me endless panic attacks. The pain meds really wreaked havoc on my emotions. I am not saying that is what&#39;s up with you, but keeping your mind ahead of the meds made a huge difference for me.
</p>
<p>
In the end, the pain and mental anguish was worth it. If you feel like chatting, feel free to dm me. I&#39;m in the States, but will be awake for at least another hour.
</p>
<p>
If I don&#39;t hear from you, I hope that means you are able to rest. ❤

Yeah I cannot take any more morphine, even though I am still in so much pain is is destroying my stomach and making me feel so nauseous.
</p>
<p>
I just want to make some progress so I can at least feel like I’m not going backwards or destined to stay lying in this hospital bed forever

Hang in there. There will be a point when you get over the hill and can coast for a bit. You will get there girl!

Omg yes this describes it perfectly, it’s not even a dig at the nurses, it’s just there are so few staff with the specialist knowledge so often you are just waiting hours and hours to see someone that understands.
</p>
<p>
I would definitely recommend miss Rashid to anyone and the result so far looks great.
</p>
<p>
But this is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do and to do it so alone with all the initial complications has been brutal.
</p>
<p>
I can’t wait to get home but I am also scared of doing the next steps by myself without even nurses to support me!
