I&#39;m also looking into PAI because of their great aesthetics and their affordable prices. Thai SRS surgeons are much better than here in the West. Your result looks fantastic.

Yes I came from the USA specifically for PAI, because they have the best results I had seen . I did 100s of hours of research and everything pointed me to PAI, the cost is less than all the others in THAILAND but the care is comparable to no other. Dr.Sutin is a wonderful sweet man , very humble and full of information to help u. My last appt is tomorrow to get cleared to fly I&#39;ll let u know how it goes.

It looks great, I have a question: How has your recovery been so far? How have vaginal dilations been so far? Are they painful? How has Dr. Sutin&#39;s aftercare been?

So far the recovery has been fantastic going well getting rest. The dialation is going great 7 inches no pain. It&#39;s a slow process.Dr. Sutins after care is FANTASTIC any questions I&#39;ve had he has answered right away. And he&#39;s very gentile on the 1st visit after surgery at the office, he used a speculum and I didn&#39;t even know it until he started cranking it. He&#39;s a great surgeon, very happy overall.
