I was looking into SRS and was considering Kamol as well. I was starting my transition at the time so I decided to start my HRT with them and at least scope things out. I&#39;m glad I did. Their pricing is definitely on the high end, but their service, professionalism, and standard of care were not. I found myself afraid to think what it would be like for a major surgery like an SRS with them, so that was a big red flag for me.
</p>
<p>
Almost every interaction I had started with them asking when will I come in for my hormonal shot to which I always had to tell them I&#39;m not doing shots since I am using transdermal gels. Plus even if I do shots, don&#39;t we normally do it ourselves at home after learning how to inject properly? With the way it was explained to me, I actually had to come to the hospital to get the injection every 2 weeks and that&#39;s definitely not happening.
</p>
<p>
The doctor I&#39;m seeing for my hormonal check-ups is only available on Thursday for some reason and the $90 involves a blood test with a literal 1-minute consultation afterward and I only get to know my levels a few days later via a phone call. And I&#39;m a &#34;Mr&#34; on their receipts. I know I&#39;m still in boy mode but I&#39;m just about done.

I can understand how annoying the Mr is. The hospital Endo dept I go to for HRT does that, just because I haven&#39;t changed my passport yet. Why i am there is quite easy for them to look up if it isn&#39;t obvious.

I’m glad I didn’t go to him because his results aren’t consistent and they don’t seem to take their time to create the delicate structures like the labia minora etc.

The first red flag was when I emailed them and Darci started shit talking about other surgeons and how bad they all were. I was also in contact with another girl who had surgery there and she had nothing but issues.

Sorry you are frustrated, big hugs.  Not having much depth is always a risk and a frustration so huge hugs on that.  But honestly visually you look quite nice down there.  Sis-women vaginas come in quite a few different folded shapes, and yours just doesn&#39;t look too far outside of normal vagina spectrum, so don&#39;t be too hard on yourself we can be our worst critics.  It would be nice if your clit hood was a bit more well defined and (maybe) your outer lips but that is a to-taste.  Not having well defined lips makes your vagina look younger and a few women will get their lips greatly reduced in their 30-40&#39;s to have a vagina that ironically looks more like yours which appears to be a more youthful vagina.

Well on the bright side when you go in for a revision (which is not uncommon for visual touch ups for GCS) your new surgeon will kind of anticipate you may be upset.  Obviously you aren&#39;t angry with them.  But you just have to find a surgeon who maybe has visual examples that match visually what you want to look like after, and ideally is known to do revisions.  The sticky part is your depth issue.  That&#39;s not trivial to fix.  A big part of the issue will be what caused the problem and do they need to take a section of your colon to fix it.  At which point you have to carefully ask yourself if its worth the pain.  But I wish you the best luck and hope you can find what you&#39;re after!

I also did my PPV with Dr. kamol recently. And I can say it looks nothing like the photos on his website.
</p>
<p>
During my consultation, I asked if he could make my clitorial hood pointy &amp; make my labia minora longer to cover the vaginal opening. He said yes confidently to both requests without hesitation, but he achieved none.
</p>
<p>
My clitoris hood has a wide base and you can clearly tell it was a bent penis. The urethral opening looks like yours as well, it just doesn&#39;t look normal.
</p>
<p>
I had some tissue necrosis which requires a second visit to the operation room, but it happens to every surgeon so I wouldn&#39;t complain too much.
</p>
<p>
But what I experienced makes me think maybe I picked the wrong doctor.

Your perineum is a little long but otherwise the results look quite good. If functionality is as good as it can be and you aren&#39;t in any pain that can get better with another surgery, I wouldn&#39;t get more surgery.
