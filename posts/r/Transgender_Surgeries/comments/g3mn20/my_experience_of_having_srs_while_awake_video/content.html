Oof, how could one endure that? I can&#39;t imagine not having a panic attack and botching their work through fussing with the body parts that I actually could still move...

seconded. I had a few surgeries while awake.
</p>
<p>
One was with ketamine, best trip of my life thx to medical grade K administered by an anesthesiologist. it&#39;s popular in the third world, not in the US unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
another one was to save money on anesthesia. it was fun having my whole arm paralized and insensitive for a few hours after! and I was suuuper relaxed during surgery. you&#39;re in la la land, you don&#39;t care, you listen to people talking and funny noises but you&#39;re out there
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m generaly chill which may have helped. I just wish I could have watched or made a video

i&#39;m the complete opposite, I did some research so I knew what was going to happen during surgery and what I would feel  so that meant I could mentally prepare myself. If I was given General Anesthesia I would have spent the night before surgery panicking.
</p>
<p>
I did my revision operation without any sedation at all.

Thank you for posting this; just on the subject of knowing it can be done. I feel the same way about general anaesthetic, but had been hoping I can do some things to address my anxiety. Was this a private surgery or through the NHS? I have made some enquiries with LTC about having an orchidectomy done under local and they seem extremely resistant even to that.

It was funded by the nhs but done at Parkside Hospital which is a private hospital.

I think that&#39;s always how it works; how free was your choice of hospital and surgeon?

I had full control over the choice of which hospital and surgeon I had. I requested to be referred to Parkside by the gender clinic and when Parkside got in contact with me they let me choose a surgeon then.
</p>
<p>
Parkside has been quite flexible with my care and done a lot of adjustments to match my needs. The surgeon and anesthetist also both work at Charring Cross Hospital.

You do realize they very often due brain surgeries with the patient awake, right? It&#39;s actually far safer that way. Also, they can numb you from the waist down and you can&#39;t move (see: every person who gets a epidural for a C-section.)

That&#39;s from the waist down. If I panicked and waved my arms around for instance, what&#39;s saving me from moving the rest of the body?

You&#39;re not knocked out, but you&#39;re still sedated. Again, this method of anesthesia isn&#39;t unheard of, and there are protocols in place to perform it. I mean, a lot (if not most) brain surgeries are performed with the patient still awake, because they&#39;re safer that way.
</p>
<p>
As for freaking out, that&#39;s unlikely too: I can almost guarantee they gave OP something like Versed (or as I like to call it, Nofucksatall.) It&#39;s a benzodiazepene that basically eliminates fear and anxiety about five seconds after they inject it. It&#39;s very common to give to surgical patients, to lower their anxiety before surgery. I&#39;ve had it twice, including before GRS. Trust me when I tell you that the hospital could be on fire and you wouldn&#39;t care.

Thank you for posting this, I had been wondering if this was possible, every surgery I&#39;ve had, from circumcision to leg amputation have all been done under local anesthetics, so it&#39;s a huge relief that I may also be able to get my SRS the same way.

I’d like to suggest you name the surgeon in when you post on YouTube and reddit so that people searching for information about that surgeon can find it.

I added your post and video to the wiki here in a number of places. Its very good. Here&#39;s one
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_tina_rashid" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_tina_rashid
</a>
</p>
<p>
You mentioned you have learning difficulty. Have you discussed how this has affected your transition, surgery, or recovery anywhere? I don&#39;t recall anyone else discussing this and I&#39;d like to add it to the wiki to help others in the future.
</p>
<p>
It might be helpful if you edit your YouTube post to say you went to Tina Rashid in the text, so its searchable.

<p>
I haven&#39;t discussed in a video how learning difficulties has affected me yet but it will be getting a mention in my next video about my recovery in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
I did plan to make a video discussing about all the stages of transitioning I went through so I could also talk about my learning difficulties in that.
</p>
<p>
I have also now added Tina Rashid&#39;s name to the title of the video.

Hazel,  what a wonderful video, it&#39;s so nice to put a face to the people who I spoke to prior to my surgery with Miss Rashid. It brought back so many happy memories of my admission day and surgery day and also gave me an insight into what happened after I was put to sleep! Looking forward to the next video.
</p>

<p>
There was actually a few reasons, If I was to have a general anesthetic I would have panicked all the time in the weeks leading up to surgery which wouldn&#39;t have been good for my health or mental well-being.  It was a lot less stressful for me knowing I had the option to stay awake and plan for that.
</p>
<p>
Another reason is that I have a jaw deformity which would make putting a breathing tube down my throat more difficult and which also puts my teeth at higher risk of breaking if one was used.
</p>
<p>
Being awake also meant the operation had less risks and I had an easier recovery as I didn&#39;t have to deal with the side effects of  general anesthesia. I only gave consent for general if it was a medical emergency.

<p>
if you can get a custom fitted tooth protectors, the same that boxers use, and demostrate to the anesthesiologist that even with all their strength they won&#39;t be able to remove it, they let you keep it.
</p>
<p>
they&#39;re just worried you may accidentally swallow stuff, but if it is fixed, it helps. I learned about that stuff for vfs

Wow! Thanks for sharing. Not knowing if this was possible has been one of the things keeping me from considering SRS. Did you have a choice to watch the operation? Was the blue curtain optional?

I didn&#39;t have a choice to watch the operation as the the blue sheet wasn&#39;t optional. i&#39;m not entirely sure what it was for but as they called it a shield I assume it was there to protect me from something. When I had my second operation I found a reflection in the room and watched the operation that way.
