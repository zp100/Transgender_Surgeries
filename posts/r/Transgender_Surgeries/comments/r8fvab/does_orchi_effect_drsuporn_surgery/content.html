I got an orchiectomy a year ago for medical reasons and now that I’m looking into srs and really loving Dr. Suporn I’m wondering if it will be an issue my scar is right down the center which the doctor did purposely for a future SRS but I’m worried now also my doctor scraped the fat off the testicles but I’m not sure if that’s the same thing Dr. Suporn uses instead of the Colon lining

No but he will require you stretch what you have left to combat any shrinkage. I had minimal material and had an orchi. Still got 6 inches of depth.

It is used as an addition &#34;to line the vaginal cavity&#34;.   Because I did not get it I don&#39;t know exactly where it is used, that may differ from patient to patient. I only know what is mentioned on the Suporn Clinic website. I think it is similar tissue as used in PPV type surgery, so would have similar potential advantages and disadvantages.
</p>
<p>
Dr Suporn and Dr Bank adjust the non penile inversion technique used to suit the differences in different patients. Plus the technique continues to evolve over the years.
</p>
<p>
Because I had a small penis and was circumcised, in the past this would have meant I would get a Type B operation. However Dr Suporn said he decided to give me a hybrid, Type A at the top and smaller section of Type B at the bottom. I said but that&#39;s not in the pdf report of your procedure. He said no, it&#39;s new, it will be in the next report. I said, so Type AB then. He laughed and said, yes Type AB.

Dr Suporn and Dr Bank do not always use the tunica vaginalis tissue that surrounds the testicles. They may offer the choice to use it or not depending on the individual. It my case it was not an option as it would have increased the operation time which Dr Suporn wished to minimize due to my age as I&#39;m in my mid 60s. I am good friends with another younger transgender sister recovering here and she was offered the choice to use it or not by Dr Bank and chose not to have it.
</p>
<p>
It does not change attainable depth or aesthetics. The Suporn technique can achieve depth even for those who had a very small penis.
</p>
<p>
As to the midline scar on your scrotum I do not know. Perhaps you could consider contacting the Suporn Clinic and enquiring directly, that way you will get the most accurate answers to your questions.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not going to give a full review but I&#39;m super happy with the results of my surgery and the quality level of aftercare is absolutely outstanding.
</p>
<p>
The chance to meet, converse, share meals and make friends with a whole floor full of other transgender women from many different countries in the Rattanachol recovery hotel is a great joy.

Its used to line the end of the neovagina. Since its made or a peritoneal material its said by some that it gives a little wetness. Maybe look into ppt to understand the benefits/drawbacks of peritoneal material for lining and then you understand why it might be beneficial to use the tunica vaginalis

Thank you, sister! I understand that Suporn decides not to give you the option due to your age and shorter survey time for your safety reason. However, how come the young trans sister was given the option and agreed to have it but ended up having the option being taken away?

If you&#39;re talking about the woman I previously mentioned, it was her choice not to use tunica vaginalis after consideration of the possible advantages and disadvantages that were explained to her by her surgeon. By the way, young is a relative term, all the other patients are young compared to me. Some other patients are so young I could be their grandmother, haha.

Do you know if they do a version without meshing the testicle skin?  I hear that this is what causes the more difficult recovery.

No, I don&#39;t think so.
</p>
<p>
Yes recovery is longer, more physically arduous and psychologically challenging than after other surgeries. However many consider the sensation, aesthetic and depth results to be worth it.
</p>
<p>
With a small circumcised penis it is unlikely I would have been able to attain 19cm of depth with other methods other than colon vaginoplasty which has some serious risks involved.
</p>
<p>
Not to mention the level of aftercare which is so excellent. Clinic staff visit every day in the recovery hotel to check on you. And twice a week the Clinic bus  takes you for a check up with your Suporn Clinic surgeon.
</p>
<p>
If any  issues arise that need fixing, such as wound separation etc. then the Suporn Clinic surgeons fix it at the Clinic during your recommended 4 week post-op recovery period in Thailand before you leave for home.
</p>
<p>
Many patients return after a year to get the included revision surgery which improves aesthetics by kind of closing up the posterior commissure. This is purposely left more open as it would be split by the dynamic dilation maintenance requirement. Sometimes excess tissue is removed also. Dr Suporn sometimes tends to leave a fair bit of material in place as this provides spare material if anything needs fixing.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t really know but I&#39;ve heard that Dr Bank may differ somewhat in this regard. All I know is that all the Dr Bank patients I have spoken to are happy with their results.
