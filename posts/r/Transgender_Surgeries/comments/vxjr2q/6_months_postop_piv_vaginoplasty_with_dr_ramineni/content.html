</a>
</p>
<p>
Coochie update:I lost a little bit of depth around the three month mark but I leveled out at just past the second to last dot on the soul source dilators. I haven‚Äôt really made any effort in sizing up dilators (more on that later) and have just focused on keeping depth and having dilation be as smooth and easy as possible. A couple times a week I bleed a little after dilation but it‚Äôs a very small amount if I do. I still have a little bit of discharge but it really depends on what I‚Äôm doing in a day wether or not I need a panty liner. Peeing is a little bit messier than I would prefer but that‚Äôs more of a nit pick than anything. Lastly I have a little bit of hair at the entrance of the vagina but that‚Äôs more or less to be expected when you don‚Äôt get hair removal ahead of time, as far as I can tell I don‚Äôt have any truly internal hair.
</p>
<p>
Sex life:So getting SRS changed quite literally everything about my sex life. I went from being a bisexual capital b bottom to a lesbian top. Turns out that when you don‚Äôt hate your body some things start coming into focus. I haven‚Äôt had an orgasm yet which is definitely from a lack of trying and lack of interest. I‚Äôm sure if I wanted to I could because getting fingered and getting head both feel great but ultimately orgasming is no longer at the top of my priorities when it comes to sex and post surgery I haven‚Äôt really had much interest in masturbating. Also I don‚Äôt really have a ton of interest in full on penetration (i.e. why I haven‚Äôt worked on sizing up) so I just make sure things are wide enough for fingers.
</p>
<p>
Life update:My life really felt like it went 100% fully back to normal after the three month mark when I started dilating twice a day. Yes dilating sometimes gets in the way of doing things but I‚Äôve taken multiple trips and had a very functional personal life despite dilating twice a day. Getting back to high impact exercising (specifically running) was a little scary because I had a little bit of blood after the first few times but I was told I shouldn‚Äôt worry and once I was into a semi regular routine I was all good.
</p>
<p>
Gushy feelings:Getting SRS has been maybe the best thing I‚Äôve done for myself since I started transitioning seven years ago. The weight of having something you actively hate about yourself strapped on the front of your body takes a massive toll and I didn‚Äôt realize the full extent of my bottom dysphoria until I got SRS. Also day to day it‚Äôs such a nice change to not have to have the fear of bathroom stall doors flying open, tucks becoming undone, or worst of all an erection sitting in the back of my head. I truly can‚Äôt believe that I was on the fence for so long about it before I finally pulled the trigger but oh my god I‚Äôm so, so glad I did.

Did you need any revisions?
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm curious because I had the same with Dr. Ramineni in March and we currently have revisions scheduled for October to make minor adjustments to my urethra and fix some less than desirable adhesion that happened for me. Otherwise I‚Äôm right there with you, the euphoria I have now is amazing and the results are better than expected really. Dr. Ramineni is amazing and gods do I wish every doctor had his bedside manner.

You look amazing girl.... Im excited to see Ramineni for consult later this month. Seeing his results like this really changed my mind on going with him. I have horrendous bottom dysphoria and seeing posts like this are so helpful‚ù§Ô∏è

Well I‚Äôve got a question here and excuse my stupidity.  But your wonderful looking vagina the bottom part is rather close to the exit.

<p>
Does that cause any issues say on taco Tuesdays?

Not at all. Everything is nice and separate. Keep in mind your butthole isn&#39;t at the bottom of your butt crack.

That seems like a fairly normal distance from vagina to anus for natal vaginas. I&#39;m not sure about neovaginas or op&#39;s vagina specifically, but natal vaginas are used to having a bit of butt bacteria in them just due to the proximity‚Äîas long as you&#39;re not directly putting something from the ass into the vagina it shouldn&#39;t be an issue. Considering neovaginas generally attempt to emulate natal vaginas as closely as possible, including with positioning, I imagine the butt-to-pussy microbiome situation for neovaginas would be similar. It can feel a bit disgusting when you&#39;re pooping messily but idk, you get used to it. And I have never felt a spicy poop in my vagina if that&#39;s what you&#39;re wondering.

I‚Äôm so happy for you! You do look amazing and I hope I get results like you do. I‚Äôm going to Kieran hart in Canberra this September. I feel frightened but I have to do this as my bottom dysphoria sounds similar to yours. When you said how happy you are and that you waited 7 years I was heartened as I‚Äôve waited 10 years.

This is both wonderful to read and see. You look amazing and that&#39;s a beautiful vagina and I&#39;ve looked at a lot the last few months! I&#39;m scheduled for my vaginoplasty with Ramineni on April 9th and reading this is so inspiring and confidence inducing. Thank you so much for taking the time to post your update. I&#39;m so excited for your new life. Congratulations.
