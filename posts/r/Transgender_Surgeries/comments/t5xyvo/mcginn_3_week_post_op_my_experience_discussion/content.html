Hey y&#39;all!
</p>
<p>
So I won&#39;t be sharing pictures, but I wanted to talk about my experience healing from Dr. McGinn&#39;s vaginoplasty surgery.
</p>
<p>
I have been extraordinarily pleased at my results aesthetically. If you search &#34;mcginn&#34; and sort by top, mine are perfectly in line with some of the ones I see there. My labia touch, I have an in-tact fourchette (which is one of the major reasons I chose McGinn), and the vagina is contained correctly within the labia. I also know other trans women that went around the same time I did who have had equally stunning results.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got no granulation tissue, no complications, and I&#39;m healing extremely well. About the worst thing I&#39;ve experienced was a stitch popping but airing it out/drying it out healed it in a few days. This is absolutely the reason I chose McGinn - her 0.6% fistula rate, and extremely low rate of other complications, combined with her aesthetic results were what made her #1 for me.
</p>
<p>
3 weeks later, I would say that my biggest issue has been tiredness. I just don&#39;t have a lot of energy - the surgery saps a lot out of you given that you go without solid food for at least 5-6 days combining pre and post op. The healing process is very taxing on your body. McGinn has several supplements she has us take, and I do think it helped.
</p>
<p>
Gaia house was incredible. I loved staying with other people who have had the surgery - both people who had it recently, and others there for follow up appointments. We all hung out and socialized and it was a wonderful, healing experience.
</p>
<p>
Kristal (McGinn&#39;s PA) is super responsive via email on answering questions and looking at pictures. I feel like I am listened to and quickly responded to. I have absolutely no complaints.
</p>
<p>
I have pleasurable sensation and feel confident that I will easily be able to achieve orgasm. I have not explored it too much though because she says 6 weeks until you can engage in sexual activity. I am already up to green on the dilators a week and a half early - I have found dilation not overly difficult. 30 minutes 4x/day for the first 6 weeks, then a gradual reduction to 3x, 2x, 1x, and then 1x/week. I just listen to an audiobook or browse the internet while doing it.
</p>
<p>
I look forward to returning for the 6 week follow up, I love New Hope, Pennsylvania - it is a wonderful town.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I just wanted to add my voice to the group of people singing McGinn&#39;s praises. I&#39;m extremely happy and can&#39;t recommend her highly enough.

So glad to hear! Two quick questions.
</p>
<p>
First, at three weeks, would you find it realistic to go back to work part time starting next week (at week 4), assuming you have an office job or WFH? Trying to figure out roughly how much time I need to take off. My surgeon (RBL) suggests 6 weeks, which is a lot.
</p>
<p>
Second, how was traveling back from PA to wherever you&#39;re located? My return trip will be from NY to DC, and I&#39;m trying to figure out the best way back (train, plane, or car).
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

Office job no - I think I can sit down right now for an hour tops and that would hurt. With a donut pillow maybe 2 hours. A full days work? Probably not. I do feel like I&#39;ll be ready at 6 weeks though given my pace of recovery.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not just that though, dilation and general fatigue is pretty intense with this surgery. I still find myself needing naps/rest right now.
</p>
<p>
As for the travel, I&#39;m in DC, so it&#39;s about 3 hours from New Hope. The trip back was not terrible. It certainly wasn&#39;t fun or great, but I was able to do it. I had a driver and laid back in the seat with a donut pillow. I actually feel like the car is best.

Much appreciated! Is it alright if I DM you about trans stuff in DC?
