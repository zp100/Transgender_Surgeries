Hi everyone, I know with the recent post this might seem like bad timing, but I&#39;m 2 weeks post-op and eager to share my pictures/experience with Dr Bensimon.
</p>
<p>
I found him quite pleasant and professional. I was quite anxious going into my surgery because
<a href="/u/HealthyCompote9573">/u/HealthyCompote9573
</a>
&#39;s initial post had come out the week before, so the day of my surgery I made sure to ask him specific questions like how long I&#39;d go under (6.5+ hours), how deep the jaw cuts would be, etc. We went over my CT scan together and he showed me that we couldn&#39;t go the full depth because the mandibular nerve was too close to the surface, so the most he felt comfortable doing was about 5 mm. We also discussed my rhinoplasty, and he was debating whether to reduce the nostril size, which I personally was in favor of. He ended up agreeing with me while I was under the knife. He also showed me that we would be doing a type 3 forehead reconstruction, with a titanium mesh plate to ensure I wouldn&#39;t end up with a hole if the bone didn&#39;t attach properly. The order of the surgeries was: Trachea shave, Forehead, Jaw, Nose (nose last as they have to change the respiration tube from nose to mouth).
</p>
<p>
The surgery ended up lasting longer than advertised, at around 8 hours. There was a minor hiccup with the surgery with the catheterization, but otherwise he told me afterwards that &#34;he likes to take his time&#34; with these things (maybe he learned his lesson?).
</p>
<p>
Waking up I had very bad pain in my ankle. The compression socks I had to wear were too tight, and were digging into my heels. I was told to continue to wear them for 24 hours post-op, which made those first hours quite miserable. The facial pain was much less than the ankle pain! In fact, two weeks later, my heel is still a bit numb. For my next surgery, I&#39;ll make sure to try on the compression socks beforehand, to make sure they fit comfortably.
</p>
<p>
Another unpleasant part of the hospital stay was that they had hooked me to an IV for my first night, which meant I had to pee every 30 minutes. With the catheterization issues mentioned above, this was quite uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
The day after surgery, I saw the doctor and he showed me operation pictures (quite gruesome, but cool!), and I was discharged with long lists of instructions. (including no garlic, ginger, papaya or chamomile for 2 weeks post-op :( :(, and no straws!). I was told to wear my face brace for 7-10 days, or less if it was uncomfortable. I wore it for around 5 before giving up.
</p>
<p>
On day 10, I went to his office again to get my staples, nose splint, and the stitches in my nose removed. He was quite happy with the results, and assured me that swelling in the adam&#39;s apple and jaw would go down significantly over the coming months.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m very happy with my results. Swelling will continue to go down, of course, but even after two weeks I&#39;m starting to feel like myself again. I hope he&#39;s right about the adam&#39;s apple, but even if it&#39;s as good as it&#39;ll get, it&#39;s still quite a bit reduced.

Thank you so much. From what he told me in my consults I&#39;m in a very very similar position to you in terms of the nerve stuff (even the same max of 5mm on the vline and all the same line items), and have been really worried with my surgery coming up in January. You look amazing and I can only hope he does as well with me.

Hi Alexe,
</p>
<p>
The first night was a bit miserable. I didn&#39;t have a bath robe, but they provided one. For the compression socks I just got some at the pharmacy, it said they would fit my size but I was at the limit, and my left foot is a bit bigger than my right so... ouch

Feeling good! Very happy with the results. Still have a teensy bit of numbness on the top of my scalp, but other than that I have no complaints.

I had no problems with him! His bedside manner was very good. I&#39;m not sure about other people, I can only talk about my own experience.
