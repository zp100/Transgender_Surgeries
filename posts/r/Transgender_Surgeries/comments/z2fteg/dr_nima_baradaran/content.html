While discussing bottom surgery with one of my fellow transfeminine friends, she mentioned that she had had a consult with a Dr Nima Baradaran out of Ohio State University and while he definitely appears to be a urologist his profile says nothing specifically about GCS.  Has anybody heard of him in terms of being a GCS surgeon?  Has anybody had GCS performed by him and if so, what were your feelings about him and his work?  Any information would be appreciated.  Thanks.

I was scheduled to have surgery at the end of January with Dr. Baradaran. But it had to be changed because they went over on OR hours. I should be getting my new date soon.
</p>
<p>
They have been very helpful in this process and have been good at answering my questions. I was very pleased with the previous surgeries that I was shown during an appointment.

I&#39;d also be interested if anyone has some stuff to share on Dr. Baradaran. His profile doesn&#39;t have any info about bottom surgeries on it (probably because of threats against providers), but I&#39;m definitely interested, since I&#39;ve heard that he&#39;s trained with lots of really good folks.
</p>
<p>
Anyone have any experiences with him??

Fyi went to a consult with him and could nottttt get out of the office fast enough. He straight up told me that he&#39;d expect me to need at least two revisions. (Lots of other not great stuff in this appointment too, but don&#39;t wanna type it all out right now.)

My surgery is scheduled for December 7th. Full depth vaginoplasty/orchiectomy. Will be posting progress stuff.
</p>
<p>
He performs it with Dr. Chandawakar (plastic surgeon).
</p>
<p>
I was supposed to have it in 2021 but the pandemic pushed everything.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had great consults with them both since this whole process began. Ymmv I guess. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
