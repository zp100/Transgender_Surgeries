In 2022, I had FFS with Sarah Saxon. I did not consent to a reduction rhinoplasty, but she gave one to me against my will anyway. I am now experiencing
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6a6n3duAeg/?img_index=1">complications</a>
that I&#39;ve been told will only get worse and more visible with time. I have repeatedly asked for her to send me my records (which I need to sue her, along with the recording of our Zoom meeting where I explicitly tell her I do not want the surgery she performed on me) but she has refused to give them to me
<strong>
for almost 2 years,
</strong>
presumably so the statute of limitations will run out and I can no longer sue her.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s against Texas state law to do what she&#39;s doing, by the way.  It&#39;s also against Texas state law to refuse to release someone&#39;s medical records, which she is doing by forcibly cutting off contact.
</p>
<p>
I have reported her to the state medical board for these three violations, but she&#39;s still licensed as of now so I wanted to warn people not to trust her.  If she makes a grave mistake like she did with me, you will be left out in the cold.

I can&#39;t get a lawyer to take my case. They&#39;re all saying it&#39;s not worth it. I have contacted 20+ attorneys in DFW so far

Try contacting the dallas lgbt bar association
<a href="https://dlgbtba.org/">https://dlgbtba.org/</a>
, I can&#39;t promise they&#39;ll take your case as it&#39;s extremely hard to sue for medical malpractice in this state but they may be able to offer advice. Sorry if you&#39;ve already contacted them and I&#39;m so sorry you had this experience

That&#39;s exactly why nobody will take my case. Texas law severely limits how much you can sue for and every lawyer is like &#34;I want more money than that for this&#34;

If 20+ lawyers have said your case is not worth taking, and you&#39;re not a lawyer yourself, that should be an EXTREMELY strong sign that a lawsuit is not worth your time.

I’m so sorry to hear this. I listened to a podcast interview with Sarah Saxon and got bad vibes with how she spoke about trans people and the “why” of FFS.
</p>
<p>
I really hope you can find someone to take your case. Have you tried to local ACLU?

My local ACLU isn&#39;t in Texas, so I haven&#39;t. Again, Texas law is basically bullshit and severely limits how much money you can sue for, which means every lawyer I talk to is like &#34;it&#39;s not worth it&#34;
</p>
<p>
All I can do is tell the world how much Sarah sucks

she got trained by Dr spiegel? no wonder Dr spiegel did my FFS and he did a horrible job after my FFS I looked like a guy that just got out of a bar fight and I still get misgenderd so after six years living like this I finally got a FFS surgeon that is going to take my Insurance. to fix my face. Zhe is not a good surgeon at least with my FFS. I also have been hearing other patients complaints about him with there FFS that he did on them.

Sorry this happened to you.  I have the exact same deformity as you, acquired in Argentina,  among other problems.  In fact mine is much worse. I&#39;ve just given up on trying to fix it honestly.  I think an implant is the only way to fix it.  You can&#39;t &#34;rework&#34; a missing chunk of cartilage.  Nasal implants can be risky.  If they get infected, you can be looking at necrosis and Micheal Jackson syndrome.  I&#39;m not trying to talk you out of it but I will suggest that if you do, go see a nose god, someone who specializes in that.  I&#39;ve been hearing about
<a href="http://www.facialsurgery.com/PPghome_page" rel="nofollow">this Dr for years</a>
.  If you find a new Dr, then they can get your records.  The only other way is if you actually manage to find an attorney, and then it can be gotten in discovery.
</p>
<p>
You might want to see an ENT about your breathing and infection issues.  Not cosmetic, just fix your breathing.  I went to Dr Leeman in Austin.  He accepts insurance.
