I heard a lot of stories about Chettawut&#39;s &#34;hospital&#34; being extremely outdated and potentially dangerous, how did you experience it there?

It was clean, my room was really nice actually, to me it was clean and very well run. It&#39;s small yes but if you need electric doors and a big reception then you would need some where else. Dangerous in what way exactly? He has done over 3000 surgeries. I went because he is consistent with his results and a good surgeon. I don&#39;t need a big hospital or sliding doors I wanted a good result and a new vagina.

I noticed that the equipment wasn’t as new in the OR as I would have liked, but it was very clean. My only gripe was that damned staircase!

How has your euphoria and dysphoria acted over the past month, if I can ask?? Anything in particular you’re happy about having GCS? &lt;3

My dysphoria I would say is pretty much no more. I am more confident as I feel I am hiding nothing. I feel relief, I cried after knowing that it was done, again when I saw my new vagina, it&#39;s been emotional but in a fantastic way.

I’m stealth. I’m six months post op, so I’ve only had soft sex twice with men that wanted to go down on me. One of the guys did notice that my inner labia was very small, so he just brought it up without any assumptions. I explained that I did a labiaplasty... though common to see with women with very small inner labias, it’s still not the norm. Nevertheless I’m still very very happy with chett... and I think I’d have preferred small labias anyways. Knock wood, yours seems to be healing well :)

That&#39;s awesome that you can go stealth!  I think I&#39;d probably still tell partners just to filter out people I&#39;d personally never want to be with, but I am legitimately proud and happy for you and respect your choice. You did it!

That&#39;s pretty deceptive and wrong imo. Plus how could you start a relationship that should be trusting with that? I get the dilemma but it&#39;s not fair to not tell someone if you are sexual with them

More and more I’m seeing chett disregarding the inner labia. Though I like mine without/ or with very small inner labia, I did get asked by a guy about it!

Okokok this is rly intrusive so don’t answer if you don’t wanna !! But
</p>
<p>
May I ask how your experience has been in dating post-GCS? Do you / would you tell casual partners that you’re trans, or are you able to go stealth with it?

I haven&#39;t dated I am only 1 month post op. I would tell partners and if it&#39;s a problem then in my eyes they would not deserve to date me. Besides I am open about who I am and if I met someone special starting with a lie doesn&#39;t sit well with me.

Don&#39;t stress, follow all the instructions your given. Your in good hands best of luck. Oh stock up on everything for the bowl cleanse jelly soup coconut water electrolytes just get plenty because you can&#39;t really go out when it starts. Use Tesco online delivery for water and food, I got 36 bottles delivered. Use food panda for take away or if at the Dusit room service. Rest rest and rest. x

Are you still in Thailand? If so, I’d make use of being close to the clinic- ask any questions you have, otherwise you might not have access to that same wealth of knowledge so easily again

Well, I am glad you got home safely. I’d advise you try and be as consistent with your dilation routine as possible. Eventually it’ll become almost not necessary, especially if you have an active, varied sex live. However, doing your due diligence early on is key to actualising this.

Yes I am one of those that are very meticulous I follow instructiins to the letter try divide my times to space them equally apart and actually dialate extra at the moment taking my time and doing it all properly.

I fell into the trap of trying to do that additional dilation. Though it is admittedly not a bad idea, it isn’t always sustainable. In that, as a result of having been tired from ‘over doing it’ there can be occasions when you ‘under do it’ elsewhere. Food for thought. As you progress through your recovery though this will become less relevant, allowing you to ‘bulk up’ as and when is needed.

Yes at the moment it&#39;s ok to do a little extra as I do not go back to work until April. I guess I will just listen to my body but I will dialate 3 times daily it&#39;s a commitment but waiting so long to get it done and then not doing what is needed to me seems like stupidity. It is tiring sometimes I agree but I will only add say 10 or 15 minutes to some of my dialation sessions.

Absolutely fair... no one needs to know of my past unless if it’s relationship goals :). I’m a woman and it stops there. Unless if asks, then I’m happy to tell. I don’t hold a label and carry it with me
