Given you&#39;re using a new account do you have anything to back this up or give it more credibility?

Ok. I see them. That doesn&#39;t look good.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how Facebook works, but how can anyone get photos removed from your own account on Facebook?
</p>
<p>
You should be able to post photos somewhere they won&#39;t get deleted. Imgur is quite popular on reddit, but I don&#39;t know if its possible to get images taken down.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/">https://imgur.com/</a>
</p>
<p>
You could also take screenshots of stuff you post, just in case it is taken down.
</p>
<p>
Have you taken any legal action? That&#39;s pretty good for credibility.

There&#39;s others in your situation from other surgeons. Perhaps they can offer advice. Here&#39;s one.

Ah... the old, sign the informed consent form and let me experiment routine. That&#39;s a dandy people need to wake up to. Informed consent was meant as a vehicle to share the risk, not to place it all on the patient.
</p>
<p>
This is a tragedy, but you are not alone. I hope you realize this. I completely understand how fast surgery can go sideways and ruin your life. It&#39;s difficult to believe your situation spiraled out of control from what sounds like a rhinoplasty.

I think a wise patient considers taking legal action very carefully and depending on the legal framework they live under. It&#39;s almost always a losing proposition even if you have a good case. The OP is doing the right thing by coming forward and telling their story.
<br>
If you haven&#39;t actually been thru a nightmare like this there is peril at every turn coming at you from all sides unless you roll over and play dead. These surgeons aren&#39;t country doctors, the first sign of risk they institure their protection policy which is 100% consistent with what the OP is describing. First wall of defense is silence. They lock you out and stop communicating with you. It&#39;s effective, this is why they do it. It forces you to spend resources ie, legal counsel, to get past it. their bet is you won&#39;t do that.
</p>
<p>
Then go back and look at all the insane paperwork you signed when they stuck it in front you knowing you wouldn&#39;t read it. My surgeon introduced a surgical resident that would be joining her in the OR and ask me to sign an Informed consent form 45 minutes before I was wheeled into the OR.  After months of planning, the morning of my surgery what do you think the chances were that I was invested in this paperwork? What are the chances I would have said, I&#39;m not signing that! None. When you get to that point you&#39;ll sigh anything to cross the finish line. I&#39;m bringing this up because there are surgeons who will make you sign things so you cannot disclose your results. It&#39;s that simple. You don&#39;t want to do this, but might have done it and not even realized it. Chances are they wouldn&#39;t lift a finger if you were saying nice things but when shit goes south, like the OP, they will try and exercise control over that content to protect their reputations as experienced experts in GRS even if they&#39;ve only done a dozen surgeries.
</p>
<p>
Be careful out there people! These surgeons aren&#39;t your friends.

Having met and had surgery with Dr D I find this hard to believe from a 0 day account, but if it is true I wish you all the best.
</p>
<p>
If the error is as clear as your post indicates you should be able to find a lawyer willing to take the case on a no win no fee basis. Have you looked into that?
</p>
<p>
It would also add extra info to make this post more credible. I think I saw the same or a very similar post some months ago.

This sounds like it is straight from a nightmare. I’m sorry this happened to you, I’d be a mess :(

When you say “I was a ftm transexual” does that mean you no longer identify as ftm?

I went to DB and was completely satisfied. I&#39;m kind of surprised by these claims considering how methodical he was at the consultation explaining everything to me then through surgery and recovery doing exactly what he said he was going to do. The singular link to a facebook page without a profile picture also raises my suspicions.

No it&#39;s that you&#39;re posting about it and your only confirmable evidence is claiming to be someone in a promotional blog photograph from a year ago. I&#39;m not trying to shade you I just would like to see some hard evidence because what you&#39;re providing right now isn&#39;t as buttressed by the kind of evidence you would expect from something like this happening. I&#39;m giving you the benefit of the doubt and will wait for your surgical records but forgive me in saying this all seems super suspect.

well I&#39;d be interested in seeing some medical records etc. if that is the case I&#39;ll be happy to look at them. It&#39;s just kind of a bold claim I really doubt he&#39;s taking posts down because there are plenty of negative reviews of FFS surgeons out there on websites like realself and facebook. I do not want to condescend to you because if you can provide me some kind of proof I&#39;d be interested to see it. otherwise, it&#39;s just kind of like, anyone at any given moment could have claimed anything with what you&#39;ve provided so far. catch my drift?

Why would anyone be so stupid as to provide a stranger on reddit their medical records? I&#39;m stunned by that request Both that you would make it  or that anyone would consider it.

The did provide &#34;Some kind of evidence&#34; plus their story seems consistent with others. Mine as well. I don&#39;t know the OP, but people, do in fact, make up bullshit. They also tell the truth. They haven&#39;t said anything at all that seems off or throws off red flags. They just sound young.
</p>
<p>
I have learned way more than I ever wanted to know, having gone thru my own traumatic situation and discovering other people who have been stung by the overconfidence or negligence of a GRS surgeon. Especially, the noobs with less than 100 specific GRS procedures like FFS or GRS. These situations tend to  follow the same path when they go off the rails as patients are blamed, compartmentalized, and ignored. You don&#39;t just &#34;get over&#34; something like this. It stays with you for a very long time.
</p>
<p>
There are always muddy details you can pick up on if you&#39;ve had the experience. I just think asking someone for their medical records is stepping over the line in terms of intrusive demands. Redacted or not.

I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m a little sceptical of this account. No previous posts, one picture of just a nose on Facebook, and I haven&#39;t heard of a single plastic surgeon that won&#39;t correct their own mistakes* for a minimal/hospital fee. I smell a troll.

<p>
*Mistakes being different from just a patient being unhappy with the outcome, but if OP&#39;s story is true it definitely qualifies as a medical mistake.

HAHAHAHA...then you know nothing about 100&#39;s of people who have similar experiences. Have you ever read an informed consent form for GRS? Read one and get back to me. If you can&#39;t find one, I&#39;d be happy to send you mine.

Then it might open your eyes to this persons experience and their recourse in terms of ongoing care or revisions. I speak from experience on this.
