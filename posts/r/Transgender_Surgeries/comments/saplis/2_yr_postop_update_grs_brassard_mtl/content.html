Howdy! It&#39;s my coochie&#39;s 2 year birthday.  I had PIV grs with Brassard in Montreal, as well as a trachea shave.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never posted about my experience here before but it seems alot of you beautiful people have so ill just answer already asked questions, also new ones yall might have. Early apologies for anything that doesn&#39;t make sense or spelling errors... I rushed this tbh.
</p>
<p>
I included some photos marked with their estimated time.
</p>
<p>
I had a fairly good recovery. No MAJOR complications, however a few. I suffered from a allergic reaction to the pain meds so the first 4 days were terrible. I had alot of swelling, and some complications during recovery- scar tissue tore and hyper granulation right beside my clit... yes it was painful lol.
</p>
<p>
Now to answer some of yalls questions:
</p>
<p>
*I was &#34;bedridden&#34; for about 3 weeks in total. The swelling made movement few painful. I did go for 10 min walks 3 times a day though. Didn&#39;t go very far.
</p>
<p>
*Work: I returned to work after the 2 months off reccomended. I didn&#39;t feel comfortable returning at all but I was out of Money. Covid also made me alittle bit more anxious to get out of the house. I&#39;m a long haul truck driver so aside from the &#34;camping&#34; lifestyle, working dilations into my day wasn&#39;t too difficult. The no running water was.
</p>
<p>
*Trachea shave: I paid out of pocket which cost $5k cdn (2020) I think that&#39;s on par with many FFS surgeons? Recover was easy and simple. I had a sore throat for 4ish days and I was fine. Simple suture and scar care and forget. Scar can&#39;t be seen at all.
</p>
<p>
*Dilations: when I first started Dilations it didn&#39;t really hurt at all. As I recovered, I find dilating hurt more each time, especially when I &#34;bottomed out&#34;. Now, 2yrs later, it&#39;s just uncomfortable. I rarely have piv sex so I start with the green and go to orange. When I do have piv sex... I get to skip a week of Dilations :D  I should mention, since surgery, I&#39;ve lost 1/4 inch of depth I also forget to dilate more often now, but I still get it done in a calendar week atleast. Sometimes I also don&#39;t dilate because I&#39;ll use a toy and have fun. It&#39;s as big as ol&#39; Mr orange ouch.
</p>
<p>
*Regrets: I won&#39;t lie, I have a couple. 1. I wish I saved up more money to take more time off work. 2. I wish I was single at the time (boyfriend was no support) 3. (NOTE THIS) Expect the unexpected to happen. My grandma died nearly 1 month after surgery and it broke me emotionally. I had a rough year from that and im sure affected my recovery greatly. (Depression+drinking problem=rough recovery) 4. I waiting until the reccomended time to have sex but I should of waited longer. Some scar tissue was weak and it tore. 5. Wish I had BA at the same time but not rlly a regret.
</p>
<p>
Honestly I don&#39;t have many regrets. It was a life altering experience. The surgery itself went great. The recovery had its highs and lows. I was just focused on recovering.
</p>
<p>
*Surgeon: I had Brassard do the vago&#39; and I believe a resident or someone else did the trac shave. Whoever... they did a good job. Even though our crappy Canadian Healthcare paid for bottom surgery, I chose Brassard. I was given the option to go to Thailand or have some of the cost covered to go elsewhere to a reputable surgeon. I dont regret my choice.  I liked his work and the recovery was easier. He also resembles a Dad IMO. He made corny jokes and was very respectful to my concerns and privacy. My Dysphoria was overwhelming and i was at a point where a smooth surface would be fine with me, but I think he did a great job. Also the recovery team there was super accommodating to my needs. I loved the nurses and the chefs did a bang up job. The team at GRS Montreal helped me out promptly outside of their care facilities and communicated fairly effectively with my GP.
</p>
<p>
Also, one of the new techniques offered today wasn&#39;t available to me when I had surgery. Atleast to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Sorry no before pics. Dysphoria made me delete them lol. If anyone has additional questions feel free to ask away !

omg relate so much to dysphoria making you delete before pics. I have a tiktok and whenever i post myself before or even with a guy filter, even if its funny at the moment, my dysphoria gets worse and worse until i delete.
</p>
<p>
Lol Daddy Brassard did an amazing job xD
</p>
<p>
Your coochie looks amazing (i hope mine will look at least somewhat that good) &lt;3
</p>
<p>
Was it a standard PI or also a PTP?
</p>
<p>
does it get wet? :x
</p>
<p>
how does it feel?
</p>
<p>
Edit:
<br>
Also your recovery timeline looks really good to me?

Lol I feel that! I even made my family take down photos. Lmao Daddy Brassard  I&#39;m sure your coochie will turn out amazing. I&#39;ve seen some great &#39;Gina&#39;s before I had surgery and continue to.
</p>
<p>
I had standard PI. I&#39;m not sure if he is offering PTP. He wasn&#39;t when I saw him (to my knowledge atleast)
</p>
<p>
I get wet enough for a finger or two but that&#39;s it, and yes I&#39;ve squirted (I swear I didn&#39;t pee)
</p>
<p>
It feels amazing. Warm and soft like any cis-cooch I&#39;ve felt the insides of ? Been told it feels the same/I&#39;m too tight/it&#39;s better.... they all fall in love so I guess it&#39;s good stuff lol.
</p>
<p>
Also, if you meant how does it feel to me ? Well natural. Like it&#39;s always been there and it...just... feels right?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for stopping by and commenting babes &lt;3

It was offered to me. My endo helped me fill out the paperwork and the second time around I was given the option to go elsewhere (brassard denied me the first time I applied but ohip approved me)  My endo informed me that I can get funding elsewhere but I chose brassard anyways. His office denied me based on what one of my doctors said (I hadn&#39;t even seen him in 3 years) and I was asked if I wanted to see a different surgeon. I still said no I want brassard so then began another year of waiting. Hope my rambling helped

So you where denied based off of what one of the doctors that wrote your letters of recommendation said? Do you happen to know what was said that resulted in that?

I was admitted into a psych ward for attempted suicide when I was 15. I started HRT when I was 17 and saw this Dr for 1 year. Let&#39;s call him Dr F. When I was 18 Dr F discharged me, I started E and life went on. When I was 20 I applied for GRS qnf the process is long so It took a year. I got a letter from Dr Brassards clinic informing me I was denied and the reason, including exchanged letters between Dr brassard and Dr F.
</p>
<p>
Dr F mentioned that I was admitted to the hospital for mental health reasons and recanted his decision of reccomending me for surgery when he was questioned about my mental soundness. He&#39;s main excuse (which I believe is fair) is that I hadn&#39;t had an appointment with him in 3 years at that point. I also couldn&#39;t because he&#39;s a pediatric psych. He misgendered me alot in his letters and even spelled my name wrong. So left a sour taste in me mouth.
</p>
<p>
I got another psych who specialized in gender therapy and even worked Along side Brassard. Paid out of pocket and got everything needed for GRS Montreal and they then gave me a surgery date.
</p>
<p>
Reapplying was a relatively quick process. The therapy sessions took 4 months. One session every 2 months. And then I was good to go.
</p>
<p>
2 years post op and mentally sound, so...

I broke up with him haha. That told me it wouldn&#39;t work out.

Brassard is famous for that on reddit lol. I don&#39;t want to down play some people&#39;s bad experiences, but I had a great experience and so did a friend of mine, as well as all but one girl in the recovery center. Not saying he&#39;s the greatest but I feel that I made the best choice for me.

I&#39;m on the 3 months mark now and new to all this .... Never imagined so many complications I&#39;d face... seems to have no end. Ty for sharing!

It really feels like it doesn&#39;t end but I promise it does  By &#34;bottoming out&#34; I mean to hit the wall at the back of my vaginal cavity. Like at the point nothing can go further.  Hypergranulation tissue is a tissue that grows in while healing a wound and becomes too much, or in abundance, and will usually sit higher than the normal/healthy skin. There&#39;s nothing wrong with it per se. However it heals ALOT slower, is sore or painful, and delays the growth of healthy epidermal tissue which can result is poor scarring. It&#39;s a minor complication and easy to get rid of. I have hypergranulated tissue grow under the clitoral hood which was rubbing on my clit and it was sore and tender. I had a silver nitrate treatment (chemical cauterization) and it healed in a couple days

Thank you SO MUCH dear... Maybe I&#39;m having that! In the canal, there&#39;s a red line going deep, and it hurts/burns like a knife in the belly/urethra/prostate/anything deep.... Or like a nerve pinch. It confuses me so much because it feels like ripping skin, soreness, burn, itch, sharp knife, etc etc.... And it feels at different places.... I&#39;m hugely confused at WHERE IT IS, really. Thought about bladder or prostate injury. Or the canal failing, or granulation. My local drs aren&#39;t aware of neovaginas, they can&#39;t help and have bizarre ideas about transwomen. Mostly they said &#34; you&#39;re just on a post-operative&#34;.  Huh? Didn&#39;t knew it... Thanks...
</p>
<p>
In the clitoral hood i feel so tender! And rubbing all the the time walking. I don&#39;t want to even clean it with soap because it gets ulcerated quickly. I had liquen sclerosus before srs and I&#39;m sure is there, messing up my tissues. Or is granulation. Hope tomorrow a new (3rd) gyn can fix that. I&#39;m so tired of everything never felt more than 1 day give, then all is nightmare.
</p>
<p>
I had candidiasis day 35, they didnt treated well, now seems to reappear. Then wound infections above it. Now clitoral ulceration (don&#39;t know the cause). And tissue sticking to another (labia to clit) and if trying to separate, it rips away and bleeds.
</p>
<p>
I need urgent Care since 2 months ago and never get that. This is Argentina...

Hey babes. I honestly don&#39;t know what that would be. Hypergranulated tissue would be sore and tender, it shouldn&#39;t burn or have sharp pain. Maybe that is stretched tissue or wound separation? I&#39;d find a gynecologist who has surgical experience. Even though it&#39;s a neovag, it&#39;s still technically a wound qnd surgical site that should be treated objectively without judgement. F those ppl.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through all that !  I had candidiasis issues later on too and frequent douches with saline and prebiotic helps get rod of it and then return to normal.
</p>
<p>
I really hope everything pans out for you lovely

Hopefully.  Stretched tissue in canal doesn&#39;t feels like this, I know it well, it&#39;s little bit uncomfortable all sometimes feels like &#34;alleviating&#34;. Right? Even feels good. This other pain feels crushing inside, making my stomach spasm in pain. I feel it like damaged nerves, or prostate damage/inflammation. That last what one GP suggested but was unsure as neovaginas are a total unknown in towns...
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s hope tomorrow some other gyn figure it out what can be because it&#39;s not normal. When i push dilator 5 mms wrong angle, it spikes deeps sharp effing pain... In the end of the canal. Sometimes it&#39;s on the introitus. Sometimes spikes in urethra. So confusing. Thank you heart!

I did it I think at the 3.5 month mark. It hurt and I tore some scar tissue. I waiting another month and it got better and better. Now I love it but don&#39;t mind some outside work, if you know what I mean. Its really tough, even after 1 year. I felt like it was indestructible. Um. The feeling is good. Anything too big, ouch. Anything not big enough, meh. The feeling of Penetrative sex seems on par of that of cis women I&#39;ve asked.  Bottoming out, or hitting the back wall, used to hurt and be uncomfortable with dilations, but now I actually like that feeling.

So it&#39;s pretty tough material? Further, have you had sex with anyone who has a very girthy penis? What kind of width can you handle? My partner is very thick so I&#39;m just trying to figure out logistics.

It&#39;s very tough. I didn&#39;t use big orange until a month in cz it hurt so badly.... now it&#39;s uncomfortable but manageable. I have had sex with a man bigger than orange. It HURT. It took forever to get on it and I couldn&#39;t really move much. But we both came rlly fast so it was over quick lol I was very sore after. That&#39;s the most stretched it&#39;s ever been. It was tender and hurt to walk for a day. But no blood and would do it again if our paths cross again lmao I hope that helps give you an idea of thickness. I&#39;ve never actually measured. I&#39;m currently holding 7 regular sharpies In my hand and he was bigger than that

This is a really really nice result and it&#39;s incredible how much will still change between 1 and 2 years :o
</p>
<p>
Really looking forward for my recovery (1 week shy of 5 month post op). This really gave me more hope that I won&#39;t stuck with labia majora as thick as balls. (My opinion, everyone can look at my pics, but for me that&#39;s a major dysphoria factor right now)

Thick as balls... I think we were trying to get rid of those. Lol I&#39;m jk &lt;3  I had swelling for what felt like forever. It&#39;ll go away :) I still notice little changes here and there but they are alot slower to be seen. Hang in there! Recovery is a long journey but makes for a great story &lt;3

It&#39;s a journey lovely. Honestly I feel like I was healing up until the 1 year mark. I still notice changes this past year but it&#39;s subtle. (More sensation, more wetness. Actually learning how to use it)

Bowers was one of the options I thought about :) the results were very similar but I have more connections in Montreal. (I&#39;m from that general area) so that and a few other things probably steered me to brassard. But I did, and do. Like Bowers work :)

2 years later... super low key.  I wash it regularly like any genitalia should be.  Just water and feminine wipes when im backpacking/hiking/camping. I shave once a week. I have very sensitive skin so hair irritates it. I douche twice a week as per my GP and I&#39;ve been doing that for a long time but I&#39;m trying something new where I go down to once a week or not at all.  I dilate on Sunday usually -play with my pussy on the lords day- and douche after that and then on Wednesday or Thursday. If I had PIV sex or choose to use a big enough toy (I rarely do) I ofc skip dilations.

You&#39;ll love him. He&#39;s a Dad imo. How do you not love a Dad lol.  Tips.... wow... why am I drawing a blank. -Take it easier than you think you should. It&#39;s easy to think you feel like 1 million bucks when you JUST felt like a used $1 bill. -Water. -If you live in a winter climate like I do. Get spikes for your boots. I slipped on ice and though I broke my vag. Nope. Just my spine lol. -just remember it gets better. Have a strong support system. I cried on my dads shoulder for hours telling him I couldn&#39;t take it anymore. He assured me that I could, and I did. -the first 2ish days you&#39;ll be very gasy from the meds. Dont force a fart cz you&#39;ll pop a stitch but try to move. Wiggle side to side to help the fart escape. I know it sounds silly but it was extremely painful imo. Hurt more than the cooch. -light physical activity is your BF -have lots of healthy snacks and stock up on food if you don&#39;t have someone to do groceries for you. Took me 3 weeks to get back in a vehicle. -Get high quality lube but it doesn&#39;t need to be the most expensive.  - don&#39;t tug at literally anything. I did and I paid the price. -when u have the catheter.. idk if you&#39;ll need to flip a valve to pee. But the emptying feeling terrified me so right when the stream almost stopped, id close the valve.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure I have alot more &#34;tips&#34; lol this is all I can think of right now

Howdy. I&#39;m Canadian and my Provences Healthcare (OHIP) covered the cost of bottom surgery. I hear it&#39;s in the $23000 usd price ranch though. The trachea Shave i paid for and cost me $5000cdn or roughly $3800usd. There were additional expenses. Fuel cost to Montreal (GRS mtl offered to pay for my plane ticket there and back but I declined). I stayed a few extra nights so I covered that cost too.

Are you not able to ? It&#39;s an achievable goal. Some definitely have yo work alot harder to get it though. No denying that
