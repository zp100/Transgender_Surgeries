I think your vulva looks really good! Is it just a cosmetic issue u are thinking about or do u have functional problems as it is now?
</p>
<p>
May I ask who your surgeon was?

Thank you &lt;3 It&#39;s mostly a cosmetic issue. I sometimes feel like it&#39;s not covered enough (for example when I am exercising) and it&#39;s uncomfortable, but that happens very rarely and it&#39;s not thaaaaat bad
</p>
<p>
My surgeon was Dr. Markovsky (Dr. Lubos Clinics, Munich Germany)

Ah cool :) i knew I recognised his work since I will be a patient in February with his team 😊 as someone said, maybe they can bring the Labia majora at the top to some extend together so that the labia close a little bit more your clit.

thanks for the recommendation with the tighter panties, I&#39;ll definitely try that!
</p>
<p>
Well, I hoped that they could just move the clit, but apparently that&#39;s not an option (or atleast my doctor didn&#39;t tell me about it). I guess they don&#39;t want to risk that I lose sensation or something.
</p>
<p>
I kinda like how big the outer labia is rn, but thanks for the suggestion :)

Well thank you :)

I mean, I&#39;ll definitely have the revision (it&#39;s common in germany (or atleast in this clinic) to have two surgeries), but I guess I won&#39;t change that then

<p>
So, I&#39;ll have my revision in less than two weeks and I am faced with a decision.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t like how much space there is above my clit (between the clit and the junction of the labia minora) when I lie on my back.
</p>
<p>
My surgeons told me that they could try to remove some of the skin above the clit to try to bring the junction of the inner lips further down, the problem is that it actually looks fine when I am sitting up and that dialating brings my inner lips down a lot.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m scared that it will look worse if I decide to do it and I just don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth it to risk ruining my labia minora (which I really like) or having problems whith dialating/piv sex.
</p>
<p>
What would you do in my situation? Does it look very unnatural as it is now, or am I just overthinking?
</p>

I feel like the clit being closer to the entrance would mean more stimulati9n to the clit making sex feel really good. This is also one of the prettiest results I&#39;ve seen. Jun, right? Or Rachel BBL?

I didn&#39;t have the chance to try that yet, so I don&#39;t know, but t sounds pretty logical.

And thanks &lt;3 reading this gives me soooo much euphoria rn :D

What does Jun and BBL mean?

Leave it the hell alone, it looks great and quite natural!
</p>
<p>
Check out some porn, keywords, pussy, spread, and have a thorough look around.

Yours looks like many CIS vaginas I may or may not have been looking at with great interest!

I can see the difference in position with the dilator inserted that you’re wanting to achieve but I just don’t know if it’s worth the gamble since your vulva looks so good as it is!!

This kind of action means taking it to far: you pussy looks as natural as they come and the rest is in your head. I would check a psychiatrist before honestly. You may regret it more later. Learn that our eyes are the blindest when it comes to our own bodies. How old are you, if i may ask?

They will help you allow to see the reality as it is, not as you imagine it is. You have to learn that when you go down the road of fixing everything you see wrong with your body, that road will NEVER end, thus making it the wrong choice. What you need to do is talk to a lot of different people and ask each one how perfect they think they are, and you&#39;ll realise that NOBODY thinks they&#39;re perfect. Nobody, not cis, not trans, not even those liars on Instagram or tiktok who say they are. For me, the moment i realised this was the moment i realised I&#39;m truly a woman.

Context is important here. In Germany SRS is a two stage surgery. It&#39;s not meant as a one surgery thing. OP isn&#39;t going into this with the mindset &#34;Oh my god it has to be perfect fix it please&#34;. Revision is expected. If they really want to they can cancel it completely. It&#39;s just not recommended as not everything is done in the first stage surgery.

Thank you for the context. Obviously i didn&#39;t know that and it went without saying that if there are functional issues she should get the revision. But nowhere in the op&#39;s post is mentioned what you said, so i based my advice on that.

I just thought to elaborate! You couldn&#39;t have known. It just changes the perspective completely. The whole 1 stage vs 2 stage surgery approach is interesting anyways. But even here in Germany it&#39;s mainly there to improve the aesthetic of the outer appearance mostly.
</p>
<p>
One advantage I&#39;ve seen from this is that the surgeons get to look at their results a few month to a year after the intial surgery which lead to quite some small improvements here and there over the last few years (at least I was told so by one of the surgeons of Lubos Kliniken in which OP had their surgery).

If anything, just wait a year or so before making any more changes. I think it looks incredible!

This isn&#39;t really an option since I already have the surgery scheduled and I just want to be done with it. So I&#39;ll either have it as a part of the surgery in two weeks or probably just never

Have you discussed your feelings with your surgeon? (or are you concerned they may disqualify you from surgery for even bringing it up?)

Yeah, we talked about it during my pre surgery examination and it was this doctor who told me that I should think about it some more (since I was really unsure about it during that appointment) and I will talk to my surgeon right before the surgery  and then we&#39;ll decide

Well the votes are in. Pretty normal and perfect looking CIS pussy. Many girls would kill for that. Don&#39;t get a revision, they might make things worse. Treat yourself to one of your favourite activities instead. Love it BTW

I think that I would only have the most minor of adjustment. You have a wonderful looking vagina and I would love to have a similar vagina to yours and I think that it’s just perfect. Congratulations girl, you look totally gorgeous in your nether regions!💜💜💜💜💜

All vaginas are perfect. Some vaginas are more prefect than others but perfection is reached always in the presence of a vagina. It’s the most prefect organ in the human body, possessed only by around 50% of the population, but 100% of the population have emerged from the vagina of their mothers. So, any vagina imparts its perfection to the human who emerges from it. Its perfection is only sullied by those who do not respect it and its perfection, because they cannot deny that they emerged from a vagina.

I think it looks fine! But if you feel like you need a revision just for aesthetics, that&#39;s okay too! I just have a question: I was reading your comments, are you saying that they would remove your clitoral hood or would they make one? I&#39;m a little confused about that part lol

I will get a revision because grs happens in 2 stages in germany and this will be my second stage (and I also have some minor aesthetic things that I would like to change).
</p>
<p>
Tbh, at this point I&#39;m not sure what is and what isn&#39;t a clitoral hood.  According to the definition I read I don&#39;t have one (and will not get one), but the surgeons called the part of the inner lips that covers the clit a hood, so I don&#39;t know.
</p>
<p>
The thing I&#39;m talking about is removing some of the skin above the clitoris to bring the &#34;upper tip&#34; of the inner lips closer to the clit (if that makes sense?)

Technically, the clitoral hood is like the female equivalent of having foreskin, so you&#39;d be right about that. I&#39;m just confused because when I hear something about the  skin above the clit, I immediately think of the hood lol. I think you&#39;re talking about the part of the clit that shows the most, but I could be wrong lol this is just worded a lil weird yknow

All good! If you have the opportunity, I would definitely recommend going to the dr lubos clinics, they do not only have great doctors, but also great nurses etc.
<br>
I wish you the best of luck for your grs sis
