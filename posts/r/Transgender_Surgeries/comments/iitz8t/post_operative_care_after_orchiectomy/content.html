I got my bilateral orchiectomy done this Wednesday. So far I don&#39;t have any pain, only some mild discomfort.My surgeon only specifically asked me to wear tight underwear, wash the incision area with soap once a day and prescribed an antibiotic and pain killer pills, both which I am taking from day one.I was also advised to use any over the counter anti bacterial ointment if needed.So for those who had this surgery how was your post operative healing? Did you have to wash the incision area couple of times a day or follow a specific diet?

Following the doctor&#39;s instructions is pretty basic here. My incision healed quickly and my discomfort level was super low. After two days, gentle washing with a cloth and mild soap helped out. Heh, I even ditched the provided dressings and started wearing pads instead. After a couple of weeks the swelling was gone and feeling started to return. You&#39;ll be fine.

Seeing as I had to travel three hours from the surgery center to home, like immediately. My wife drove though so I was able to rest easy. From Friday surgery I was back to work on Monday; I&#39;m a school bus driver and sitting is part of the job. No trouble!

I&#39;m curious : why did you opt for orchiectomy and not for SRS, if you feel comfortable sharing?

Not OP obviously, but I did it because it‚Äôs way cheaper and easier to get quickly as well as the benefits from no longer needing a T-blocker.
</p>
<p>
I still plan to get SRS in the future, but that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not financially or emotionally ready for right now. I also don‚Äôt hate my penis, my testicles were a much much bigger source of dysphoria. My ‚Äúpackage‚Äù is so little now it‚Äôs actually kind of cute :)
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs just something I needed to do in two steps. I‚Äôm already feeling my transition reigniting with facial changes and breast growth so for me this was 100% worth it.
</p>
<p>
If I was ready for SRS right now I‚Äôd have done it, but I knew I wanted my T gone and I had already frozen my sperm so I just went for it. I got really good insurance this year in anticipation, and my surgery only cost me $512.

Does getting an orchiectomy lower the depth from a later SRS then?

Yeah, the fact that I could get it done right away from a local surgeon instead of shopping around for a specialist with a waiting list, it wouldn&#39;t cost much after insurance, the recovery is easy, I could get off T blockers, etc made the choice pretty appealing.

Getting SRS takes longer then an orchiectomy. Getting rid of the balls asap is nice for increased feminization, faster, longer and better breast growth. Besides not having to take those toxic shit T blockers Cyproteronacetate ü§¢

I am still unsure whether i need SRS or not! But one thing I was always sure was getting rid off my balls.So this will give me the time off to think about whether i do need a vaginoplasty in the future or not. Also my surgeon has done a number of SRS surgeries, so he did my orchi in a way that it will not hamper any future SRS surgery.

Had mine 6/30/20. I was not told to do any specific washing just that I shouldn‚Äôt take a bath for a few weeks but showers are fine. My incision was completely covered in surgical glue. There was literally no bleeding whatsoever and I waited until the 2 week mark to start picking at the glue scab, which was completely healed when I did.
</p>
<p>
I was just told tight underwear, no baths, and to keep legs elevated/walk around, also no lifting more than 10 lbs for two weeks.
</p>
<p>
I had antibiotics given to me just before surgery, but non beyond that. Opioid pain killers were prescribed, but I didn‚Äôt need them past the second day. I did need a stool softener though. The shit I had after not pooping for 3+ days was pretty epic/wonderful.
</p>
<p>
Everything went okay. I‚Äôm still healing though. I had a two hematomas one in my scrotum and one in my right inguinal canal. There‚Äôs a lot more scar tissue in that area for some reason. Surgeon said it was not typical, but fine.
</p>
<p>
Still might go back due to some ‚Äútethering‚Äù of the right spermatic cord, but it still seems to be healing and I know that it can resolve on its own so I‚Äôm giving it a little more time. Doesn‚Äôt hurt or anything. Also the only medical solution is another surgery so I‚Äôd rather give it a real shot to resolve on its own.

I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve only heard the term used around here. It didn‚Äôt google well for me.
</p>
<p>
Tethering is when the spermatic cord attaches itself the the wall of the scrotum (in my case the inside of the incision) instead of closing off and retracting.
</p>
<p>
I asked my doctor to cut the spermatic cords as short as possible and she said that that‚Äôs always how she does it. She‚Äôs also done this for many trans women before and someone I know had her orchi like two months before me with the same doctor and everything went great for her. So I don‚Äôt think it was her fault.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve heard can resolve on its own and the cord does atrophy even if it‚Äôs not cut super short so if it detaches on its own it should be all set.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm planning on giving it another few weeks before I go back and see her. I hope being more active will help.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that common. You could bring it up, but I wouldn‚Äôt stress over it.

Tethering is a medical term used to describe what happens when the sectioned ends of the spermatic cords become attached during the healing process. In my case, the surgeon did not section the cords high enough to retract into the inguinal canals while healing. Mine adhered external of the inguinal rings. I was in constant pain and discomfort. Because they were ‚Äústuck‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt move or push them back up in the canals to get them out of the way. They caused me to feel like the cord was being pulled with certain movements. On the one side, the end adhered just external of the ring near the base of the penis, and became swollen about the size of my thumbnail. It was under constant pressure from my inner thigh and there was nothing I could do to relieve the pain. The surgeon told me either it would resolve on its own or I would have to live with it.
</p>
<p>
After nine months, I found another surgeon who performed a second surgery to resection the ends. Turns out the one side apparently did retreat into the canal just before the second surgery, because the surgeon couldn‚Äôt find it. She felt it during the consult, but couldn‚Äôt find it during the surgery. Lesson learned: have the discussion with your surgeon to ensure they section the cords as high as possible so they will retreat back up into the canals, problem solved. Hope this helps‚ù£Ô∏èü§ós

Even i had to use a stool softener from day 2. I had my bandage dressing removed by my surgeon yesterday evening. I came home washed the area as per his suggestion and applied a sterile gauze pad over the incision area and then put a tight underwear over it. Do you think the gauze pad is needed over the incision or can i use a sanitary pad underneath?

I had my pussy done and about the cleaning and the diet: Follow a healthy diet in order to heal better and washing it once a day with soap (try to use neutro soap or a natural one) is really fine. Good luck honey &lt;3

Just follow Docs postop care instructions and while you are 4 days out from the procedure and shouldn&#39;t have problems; any  signs of new bleeding, worsening swelling or increasing pain or redness or fever should prompt a call to Doc. Also tell pts. to stay away from aspirin and motrin due to bleeding and avoid heavy lifting more than 10# for 2 weeks.

I am 3 weeks post orchi. The pain and most of the swelling is gone. I was concerned I had some tethering but I woke up 3 days ago and that seems to have resolved itself. Definitely don&#39;t lift anything. At 2 week mark I had to lift some garbage bags full of old clothes and had to stop because I could feel it hurting. I&#39;ve barely taken any pain killers past day 3. Sitting for long periods wasn&#39;t a problem but when I&#39;d get up I&#39;d feel it.

The initial healing was pretty fast---I got off the prescribed pain killers the first day and was back up and around after a few days. I mostly just slept for the week weekend. Ice is super helpful. I was restricted on washing for a week (no soap, just water). I used pads and tight underwear for the minor bleeding and swelling.
</p>
<p>
I recommend having ice packs and a small pillow to put between your knees to keep your legs apart (and pot, if you&#39;re into that). I found it easier to sleep on my back on the couch than on the bed.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I was a bit surprised how long it took for the last of the healing to finish. The stitches took a while to dissolve, and although it was pain free very soon it remained a bit lumpy and swollen for months.

I&#39;m 8 weeks out from an orchi.  I had two other surgeries at the same time.  My rhinoplasty was the biggest source of pain compared to the tracheal shave or orchi.  Some of my aftercare may have been more restricted because of 3 surgeries.  I wasnt allowed to exercise or life more than 5-10lbs for 6 weeks.
</p>
<p>
I could take quick showers after a few days.  I couldnt really wet my face until I had a nose brace removed, and by then I was cleared to do anything but soak.
</p>
<p>
I was on a regular schedule of cleaning my incisions a few times per day with peroxide and then putting bactracin on them.  I just worked through all 3 incisions and then plopped down with ice and watched netflix.  Not explicitly recommended but it was something I did.  I just used q-tips, nothing fancy.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon had me wear two pairs of compression shorts for about 6 weeks.  I think it was really helpful overall for healing and pain.  It helps with swelling too. I didnt have any pain there until I stopped taking the pain meds.  Stopping those was also a bigger annoyance and feeling weird than post op care and I wish I&#39;d stopped them sooner.  And overall, preop sitting with a tuck was way more uncomfortable than post surgery healing.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon went in thru my perineum and I only have one scar.  This was to minimize impact for a future vaginoplasty.  I had a drain in for 2 weeks.  I needed pads for a few days after it was removed and then that incision healed right up, no stitches.
</p>
<p>
For the first couple week or so my spermatic cords were &#34;stuck&#34; which was uncomfortable, another user called it tethering or something.  I got them moving again with some massage.  Dont be afraid to move things around down there to your pain tolerance.
</p>
<p>
I had erections again pretty quickly.  I think my hormones were off for a while and I was getting them at night.  I was supposed to avoid sexual activity for 3 months, but after about 3 weeks things were happening down there and all pain free.

This far out I need to pay a bit more attention to that scar.  It can be a little uncomfortable if I sit the wrong way, but its nothing regular massage cant help.  I just need to stretch it out and move it around.

As for diet, eat nutritious foods.  You dont have to be overly specific.  Generally the recommendations in the healthcare system I work in are to not mess around with diets post surgery. Just make sure you are eating. Unless of course you have other health reasons for a special diet.  The biggest thing is just to make sure you get protein throughout the day because your body is using it to heal.  If you&#39;re really into food and special diets, my recommendation is just to increase omega 3s, which may decrease inflammation.  But you don&#39;t have to over think it.

I forgot to mention.  Just wait 10-14 days before massaging your incisions.  Just to make sure they are closed.

So did any of you use fresh gauze pad over the incision area while you were recovering at home? I am specifically using gauze pad over the incision area underneath my underwear.But i am thinking now whether i need to use gauze pad every time after i clean that site or i can ditch that completely?
