Description: So I had SRS (PI) 17 days ago and rn I‚Äòm dealing with some serious wound healing issues; there‚Äòs a big hole  where the labia majora meet at the back and the stutures at the sides seem to be dissolving. Spoke with my surgeon today and he said that there‚Äòs no reason to worry because that‚Äòs unfortunately really common. I just need to keep it clean (saline solution), keep it dry and give it time to heal. Could take some weeks, though.
</p>
<p>
What do you think? I already posted yesterday and you guys and girls told me not to panic but IMO it looks reeeaaally bad atm. Guess I‚Äòm just really nervous because the first two weeks post-OP went way too smoothly. üòÖ
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your opinion! I‚Äòm going to see my surgeon for a check-up in two weeks anyway, but I guess I just need some peace of mind for now. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

While it looks terrifying the human body can heal some incredible things so long as its not infected and there is no critical damage.  And I don&#39;t see either of those issues here.  Just be careful to keep things clean, and follow your Surgeons instructions.
</p>
<p>
Generally the hope with wound separation is that while it happens frequently, the body also frequently closes the wound over time on its own.  It just takes longer when separation occurs, and the risk of infection increases so you have to take extra care to keep things clean.
</p>
<p>
Big hugs just do your best to be easy on your body!

If you have it clean and something good that you can use there it should be healing again.
</p>
<p>
I mean you could look at my day 7 or so and see how bad it was compared to my last thread with day 28

It looks good üëß i just had mine done August 4th. Takes time to heal all the discoloration will turn pink. Your vjj will be awesome in a month or so. Mine looked similar and now she is gorgeous.

Honestly that&#39;s not too bad, when I had mine done it separated all up the side of one labia and it bounced back pretty well despite looking like the demigorgon for a bit. Still need a revision but yours looks like it will heal niceley

Thank you all for your supportive words; I feel a bit less panic-y and afraid now. :) Guess I‚Äòll just keep it as clean and dry as possible, be extra careful with dilating and try not to think about it too much.

That happens quite often. It will heal nicely and you&#39;ll never know it happened. In the off chance it chooses not to heal they will go after it with some silver nitrate and make it right. Everything will be fine. It happens a lot.

That is a really common area to have separation occur. It happened to me 3 days after I got home from the hospital. Follow the surgeons orders and keep it clean.

Hi! Curious to know how this healed, how long it took, if any complications relating specifically to this dehiscence arose in your healing journey? I am currently dealing with something similar myself. Looking for advice and reassurance! :)
