---- Some details and review (NSFW) ----
</p>
<p>
● Price
</p>
<p>
I got srs at the Suporn Clinic by dr. Bank. I paid roughly 23k USD in total, that includes surgery, hotel, flights, food and supplies.
</p>
<p>
● Recovery
</p>
<p>
The suporn method is known for having a very rough recovery. You spend 1 week in the hospital bed, and 1 month in thailand to recover. You&#39;ll probably get a few minor complications.
</p>
<p>
To name a few, I got an allergic reaction to the antibiotics, I got some clitoral necrosis, bleeding, a small piece of granulation. But I think I got off very lucky. All of theese complications are very common and minor. They are to be expected with a major surgery like this.
</p>
<p>
I felt like I got good care while in thailand. The first night after surgery, a nursed stayed with me in my room the entire night monitoring me. And every day dr. Bank would check up on me.
</p>
<p>
Later in the hotel, I would get daily checkups with a nurse, and checkups with dr. Bank every couple of days.
</p>
<p>
I made a lot of friends there with other patients in the hotel. It was a nice little community.
</p>
<p>
I was physically disabled for few months after surgery. After month 3 I could walk and move normally again. The pain mostly manifested as long term aching, not many sharp pains. It could always be managed with painkillers if it became too much.
</p>
<p>
Dilation has been rough for me, but I think I had it easier than most. It would be 2 hour long dilation sessions, 3 times a day, for months. Now at 6 months I can dilate quite easily only once a day, and it keeps getting easier. It has been a big time consuming and painful struggle, but it was all worth it.
</p>
<p>
● Results
</p>
<p>
Aesthetics was my primary goal, but I feel like I got great results in every category.
</p>
<p>
I got nice aesthetics, 16.5cm of depth, 34mm+ width, full sensation and ability to orgasm. Also discovered I&#39;m able to fully self lubricate enough for penetration.
</p>
<p>
● Surgical Details &amp; Hygiene
</p>
<p>
My surgery lasted 6 hours. The vagina is made from inverted scrotal skin graft, with additional tunica vaginalis and urethral tissue. This means I am always moist inside, and I&#39;ve been able to be m fully self cleaning since month 2. I only wash the outside with soap, and have no issues with smell or discharge at all. My vagina is super soft and pink inside.
</p>
<p>
The part of my glans which did not become the clitoris has been kept and integrated below it. It is called the &#34;chonburi organ&#34; and it adds extra sensation. It is my understanding that the foreskin was used to line the inner lips and clitoral hood with pink and sensate tissue. (They also do circumcised people really well, but it might be less pink and harder to make a clitoral hood)
</p>
<p>
● Possible Revision?
</p>
<p>
I might get a revision in the future for some minor cosmetic details. They offer it for free so I&#39;m thinking I might go for it. There are a bunch of stuff that can be dealt with in a revision. In my case, I might do the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Removing the raphe line which is still visible in my opening (can not be removed in primary surgery due to dilation issues).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If I get the revision I also plan on getting anterior comissure, which will bring the top of the labia majoras togheter a little more and make the vagina more &#34;0&#34; shaped rather than &#34;V&#39; shaped.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I would also get posterior comissure to bring the minoras togheter more at the bottom and reduce my vagina gaping when I spread my legs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure if an urethral reduction is neccessary, but I feel like it&#39;s a little too big and uneven on one side.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix a super subtle hole between my labias. It is so subtle that I can&#39;t even catch it on camera, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a small hole from a stitch separating in recovery.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
All of theese are very minor details and only cosmetic improvements. I feel like I could be happy forever with only the primary result. The revision would only be a cosmetic bonus, a cherry on top.
</p>
<p>
I got no electrolysis before surgery, but I kinda wish did some. I have a few hairs between my labias, and in the vaginal entrence which are hard to remove. Theese are only a cosmetic issue though, I have no hair inside the vagina, because dr. Bank removed all that during the operation. I might get electrolysis once I feel even more healed, but tbh it might not be problematic enough to put in the effort.
</p>
<p>
● Conclusion
</p>
<p>
It is everything I dreamed of and I am so grateful. No regrets :)

Hey there! Once again I am impressed by your result and this further reaffirms Dr Bank as my top pick. Hope you don&#39;t mind if I ask one more question hehe
</p>
<p>
Could you please share a breakdown of what you have paid for 23k USD? How much does the surgery itself cost and the hotel room. As I understand it, you get to have different room levels, the more premium and the longer the stay, it&#39;s gonna hurt your wallet more.
</p>
<p>
Also, I guess I could save around 2k because Bangkok is just a 2 hour flight away for me :D

Surgery is about $18.5K USD, depending on the current exchange rate.

Hey! Is this type of surgery something that insurance would cover (at least a portion of)? I would assume not, but I just wanted to check.

Depends on where you go, and what state you&#39;re in (assuming you&#39;re in the US). Safe to say they won&#39;t do pay for anything in a different country though. Same state though? yeah sometimes, again depending on the state.

Wow this is absolutely amazing. Is there anybody in the states that can even come close to this? Because insurance is great and all if it covers it but this level of expertise is something that you don&#39;t really want to go cheap on.

I have seen their work and it&#39;s pretty outstanding. The look of yours still seems superior as well as the additional erogenous areas utilized seems to be unique as well.
</p>
<p>
What was your decision to not use them yourself?

There’s a lot of info on there so worth making it work. It’s the wiki for this sub.

Holy crap this looks... Kinda perfect.

Yeah there&#39;s the semi-visible scarring... But there&#39;s nothing else about it that I&#39;d think is off and then it&#39;s only semi-visible

I think my surgeon did a really good job patching me up. I started using scar gel at month 2 and I think that helped a bit as well. The scars will keep fading more in the future I think. I&#39;m not really bothered by them :D

My friend had her surgery with Suporn almost 10 years ago. She had her gyno ask why she doesn’t have a cervix, the doctor couldn’t tell it was a neovagina. I’ve looked at her scars with 5.5x magnified loupes/head lamp and can’t see them. The Suporn clinic is by far the best in the world. Congrats!

I was so ready to call bs, could just assume you&#39;ve got stretch marks or something.. your results are phenomenal! My wife immediately wanted to know more about your doctor, lmao.

I could never afford the trip, let alone the surgery, but we&#39;re in awe. This is a prime example of a Gucci coochie; expensive but quality made! 👌

What really amazes me is how symmetric the internal structures are. None of the US surgeons are anywhere near close to as precise at having the results come out so... flawless. The only criticism I&#39;d have of Banks technique is how he consistently makes the labia minora terminate independently, when they should technically have anterior commisure at a dimple past the canal before the terminus of the labia majora, but I imagine trying to do that is a huge necrosis risk since the area has the most bloodflow problems.

Almost every surgeon seems to do this, it’s fixed in the revision. My friend hopped off the table when she had her’s done, it’s a very short procedure done with local anesthetic.

Wait, are you saying revision to improve definition of labia minora is possible under local anesthetic, not general?

They give you sleeping pills and a local, your awake for it and its done in the clinic. It takes them like 30-60min…
</p>
<p>
The only time they give you a general is if its something major that you need to go into hospital for…
</p>
<p>
Your also not allowed to dilate afterwards for i think 1-2months depending on what they change etc

Beautiful results as said by many others! That recovery sounds tough though… I really wonder how I would be able to manage the 6 hours of dilating per day next to my professional life for months on. How many months does this period take usually?

I&#39;d say that the average person would have to dilate 3 times a day for 3 months, then 2 times for another couple months, then after month 5 or 6 you can drop to once a day. Some people have it much worse than this though.
</p>
<p>
It is likely you will struggle a lot and maybe even suffer depression because of it. After about month 12 you only have to do it a few times a week. And it keeps going down from there. It is a struggle and only you can decide if it is worth it.

Pretty amazing results. Some of the best I’ve seen. And other than the few hiccups in recovery, and possible revisions you mention, it sounds like all the “metrics” of a successful SRS were met. I’d be thrilled! Happy for you ❤️

Another dr bank patient here, while ive not shared any pics, I can confirm that my results are pretty similar.
</p>
<p>
Dr bank seems to get very consistent good results… dont get me wrong anything can go wrong and everyone heals differently but he does seem to manage a level of consistency that you dont hear about from other surgeons.

Yes, but not everything. The majority of sensation is in the clit and chonburi organ. But I think my lips are a little more sensitive because of the foreskin. Of course I&#39;ve only known my own perspective so it is hard to compare.

That’s one nice looking 😺I hope when I get mine done it looks half as good as yours does. I am looking at late this year, possibly 2024 before I can get my first surgery.

What technique did you get? Just standard penile inversion? But from the fact you self lubricate tells me otherwise?

First of all, I think the most important thing is to pick a good surgeon, and see pictures from them before you decide, all surgeons do it a little differently from eachother.
</p>
<p>
The majority of the result quality will depend on the surgeons skill, rather than technique. I&#39;m saying this because there are a lot of surgeons out there who claim to use &#34;the thai technique&#34;, but who actually use a variant of penile inversion with a skin graft. S
</p>
<p>
Some surgeons can have excellent results based on penile inversion, who can lubricate, nice aesthetics etc, while some surgeons are just horrible.
</p>
<p>
I was so close to pursuing surgery in my home country, because they marketed themselves as using the thai technique. Making it sound like going overseas for surgery was the worst idea ever. I almost trusted them, but in the end I went with to thailand anyway. Best decision I ever made.
</p>
<p>
So please look into your potential surgeon before going for it. Results of the same technique can vary greatly.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of great surgeons out there in all techniques.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The technique I used is suporns non-inversion technique. I think they call it &#34;Chonburi Flap&#34;. My understanding is this:
</p>
<p>
The pros of this method is that they use scrotal skin to make the vaginal canal, allowing much more depth, regardles of penis size. This also frees up the penile material to be used in creating a realistic vulva.
</p>
<p>
In the canal they use 10% urethral skin, and tunica vaginalis. Theese are mucosal tissues that create moisture in the vagina. This makes it easier for a self-cleaning microbal biome to exist there.
</p>
<p>
They also keep all sensitive tissue, as well as the cowpers gland, allowing for some lubrication when aroused. (Same organ that makes precum).
</p>
<p>
The cons of the method is that the recovery time is twice as long and difficult, and you must dilate a lot more.

Great result, and I agree with many of the previous comments. A typical Suporn/Banks result. Excellent cosmetic results. And if you follow their instructions and endure the recovery (yes it is longer and tougher but worth it) excellent results also in terms of depth, width and overall functionality.  And no, the average person cannot tell the difference, and most men who claim that they can tell can not even draw a genital on paper. I am a physician and i can guarantee you that the average doctor will not be able to tell.  I had an MRI of my pelvis done for another reason and I revised it with the radiologist. She said it was the best result she had ever seen (and even told the gynecologist that)

Congratulations on being a Woman.

<p>
Sorry to hear about experience and your recovery time as well.

<p>
My bottom surgery will be in The Vancouver General Hospital, in Vancouver, B.C. Canada., hopefully by the end of 2023, or sometime in 2023.
</p>
<p>
The waitlist so far for me is now at the 2 year mark for bottom surgery.

Was there any wait list and, if so, what were the wait times like? For consult and procedure. Your description of results sounds nigh perfect, like everything I want and my interest is very high.

<p>
it&#39;s not a wait list, exactly.  once or twice a year, the Suporn Clinic releases the available dates. you email them immediately after they release the dates, and they let you know which date you got, or if you didn&#39;t get any date at all.  the demand is pretty high.
</p>
<p>
you do need to contact them ahead of time to g et your medical history cleared with them.
</p>
<p>
yes, it&#39;s kind of a frustrating system, but it is what it is.
</p>
<p>
they are completely booked out for all of 2023, as of now.

You got to be fucking kidding me!!! That is by far the prettiest GCS I have ever seen! I am floored by the results.
</p>
<p>
Do you have depth? 27k was what you spent. When was that? The price point might be different now.

<p>
Just gorgeous!!! Seriously fucking incredible

You can see my comment in here for more details. I paid 23k USD for everything, and I got about 16.5cm depth. The prices may change. You can email the suporn clinic for a quote if you are interested in making a budget yourself.

How exactly does your method named? Non penile inversion? Is it a combo of penile inversion and ppt?
</p>
<p>
Did I get it right 1) after 2 months you dont douche at all and will never need to?  2) you fully self lubricate? Even enough for penetrstive sex?

This method is almost exclusive to the suporn clinic. It&#39;s a noninversion technique.
</p>
<p>
Personally I never have to dousche inside, and I can self lubricate enough for penetration. But this may wary from person to person. I got the tunica vaginalis option, that might be a contributing factor.

gosh, that looks amazing. I&#39;m so happy for you!!
</p>
<p>
at the same time i can&#39;t help but feel really down about having to pay thousands and go inan entirely different country to get what I want. I&#39;ll never be able to afford any of that and it&#39;s so depressing :(
</p>
<p>
though on the other hand, it also shows what&#39;s possible. and the results are really breathtaking &lt;3

Hello! I was wondering about dilation and this is the method I think I’d want to perform! Do you know if you’ll dilate for a long time after, or do you not need to eventually?

wow! she&#39;s amazing. one of the best results I&#39;ve ever seen.
</p>
<p>
how long did it take from initially reaching out to the clinic, to getting your consultation, to getting the surgery? I&#39;m interested in going with Bank but I&#39;m worried he&#39;s so busy it&#39;s gonna take 5 years.

I&#39;m just wondering did you have insurance or any help or did you just grind away at work to pay for this? The price and recovery time are my biggest hurdle cuz I have to work to pay for it but I can&#39;t just leave my job for months to recover..

Unfortunately it is almost impossible to get any financial help for the suporn clinic in thailand. It is all out of pocket. I took a loan to go there

Wow. Absolutely stunning. You’ve healed very nicely. If it’s not too intrusive, would you please share your age (even a five year range, or what decade of life you’re in), pre-surgery electrolysis experience, and what the whole thing cost?
</p>
<p>
Aside from the typical surgical complications (fistula, popped stitches, etc) and esthetic issues, having hair in the vaginal canal is one of my biggest concerns and it seems hit or miss even for people who take the time, expense and pain of “doing it right” beforehand.
</p>
<p>
Again, marvelous results. I hope you’re able to live your life to the fullest with one less thing weighing you down.
</p>

Dilation makes it really annoying still. You have do dilate right before because otherwise it is too tight. This problem gets much better with time though.

About 6.5 months post op I did it. But the dick was so big we barely got it in lol. But it worked LOL. It was amazing

Hey girl, quick question. You said with the suporn method you self lubricate, do you wear a panty liner to catch excess moisture? Or do you not need to. Thanks!

I did in the early months. Now I never have to wear anything though. I can sleep naked and have any panties without worrying.
</p>
<p>
However, I am never dry in the vagina. And when aroused I can self lubricate tons.

Holey moley, I wasn&#39;t 100% sure whether or not I want to get SRS beyond an orchiectomy, but this is incredible and I want one. Like, I know that it&#39;s surgical, but looking at it I still can&#39;t tell, it looks completely natal.

Wow your results are amazing! Congrats! You make a strong case for Dr. Bank! If you don’t mind me asking: How did you feel about just being there once… having to get all important information? Or did you have contact afterwards? How was the preparation/first contact in advance? Online? How did it go when you arrived? Surgery on day 2?

You are there for a whole month, and you get all the information and go through all the details before coming there with the clinic. They even pick you up and leave you at the airport.
</p>
<p>
Since you stay for a month, you are very unlikely to get any complications that require medical attention aftee you go home. They also offer help and advice through email once you are home.
</p>
<p>
When I arrived, they took care of me the entire time. They helped me check into the hotel, drove me everywhere I needed to be. I went alone and it all went really well and felt safe.
</p>
<p>
When you arrive surgery is usually on day 3. Before that you have a consultation with psychiatrist and anasthesiologist, get medical tests, and do some paperwork.
</p>
<p>
There is also tons of other patients to hang out with. Every morning at breakfast, and many fun evenings togheter!

What tissue is the bit in the middle top made from? (pic 5) it seems to be... inside the labia minora? (I&#39;m trying to compare surgery results for my own srs and... I think I&#39;m gonna pick dr bank based on some pictures, and not the surgeons in my country... and the clitoris reconstruction the surgeons in Germany do don&#39;t seem quite right to me, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m looking at the clitoral hood, or the clitoris itself... is there anything beneath it?)
