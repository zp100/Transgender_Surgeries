I had vaginoplasty with Dr. Gabriel Del Corral on 8/10/20. I&#39;m in my 4th day of recovery, and BORED in the hospital. AMA.

Congrats! He did mine too! Days 5 through 505 have gone pretty well for me as well. Lots to look forward to in the future.

im actually considering him for phalloplasty but currently working on getting the letters needed to schedule a consult. With that in mind I was curious how him and his staff&#39;s bedside manner have been so far? also how well did he answer your questions during consult, like did he seem knowledgeable? just trying to gauge what i can expect from him as a person for ftm bottom surgery, thanks!

OMG, bedside manner is AMAZING! I&#39;ve never felt so much caring and compassion (from both him, and his staff). His team was super helpful with all the pre-surgical stuff too. Also, his patients recover in the oncology ward, and it is nice. Private room, the techs and nurses have been awesome.
</p>
<p>
He was knowledgeable, and answered all my questions. Of course I&#39;m using him for vaginoplasty and FFS, so I don&#39;t know how that will TRANSlate to ftm (see what I did there?)

No before pic. It was in when I woke up.
</p>
<p>
So far the pain has been really minimal. Not nothing, but completely bearable. It has been more difficult being confined. Not being able to move, sit up, or even roll over for 3 days left me feeling really confined and claustrophobic.
</p>
<p>
As for a difference. O. M. G. YES.

Too bad, I saw mine immediately after, and it felt great.
</p>
<p>
You don&#39;t have a button to adjust sitting up?  Also you should be ambulatory by now.  I&#39;m confused by that.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve felt more confident.  I have nothing to be ashamed or scared of anymore :)

A few different reasons. First, the photos and testimonials I&#39;d seen of his results were good. Secondly, I had heard that his team is great to work with, and really good and partnering to deal with insurance. Finally, the wait was short (like only a few weeks to get a consult, and only about 3 months from insurance approval to surgery).
</p>
<p>
I have yet to see my final results as I am just a few days in, but his team was great, and it was a fast turn around (even with the COVID delays).

Sorry. yeah. So he wants to take the packing out on Sunday, to give the graft extra time to heal. So a day or two after that depending on how dilation goes.

Can you describe your healing process?  I&#39;m going to be working with him and I&#39;m going to ask if he could do both FFS and Vaginoplasty in a single surgery. I&#39;ve heard good things about his behavior and results from basically everyone.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had facial reconstruction done before but I don&#39;t know what healing from bottom surgery is like.

I am asking this on another review, but just in case they don&#39;t get back with me:

<p>
Did he require hair removal? I am terrified of that down there, the face was bad enough.

Wow, sorry, totally missed this question. He did not require it, but strongly suggested it. I did, and while it was very difficult, I&#39;m glad I did.
