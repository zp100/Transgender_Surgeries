Hi everyone, I&#39;m starting the application process for surgery, and my province only offers the clinic in Montreal as an option. I was wondering if you could share your experiences with the clinic and specifically the results; whether you&#39;re happy with them, whether you had side effects, how the clinic helped with complications, etc. Really I&#39;m just trying to get a sense of its reputation. Thanks for the help!

Hi!  I had my vaginoplasty at grs Montreal last June. I have been in recovery for only 3 months and yet, I am very happy with the result. It looks very nice (gf approved), very cis-like. It is healing very well and I didn’t have major complications. I have some granulation but I could quickly have an appointment at the clinic for a treatment. I have a follow up in 2 weeks to see how it goes (it is already a lot better).
</p>
<p>
I must say that I didn’t go with Brassard but with Maud Belanger because I liked her style and because I wanted a more feminine touch. She is an great human being, radiant, confident and talented. I would recommend her anytime.
</p>
<p>
The communication with grs montreal has been flawless. Right after having my pre op consultation, I could contact them by email any time and they would answer right away. They have been very professional and they were sweet hearts. I have nothing bad to say about anyone there.
</p>
<p>
The day of the surgery everything went well. Everything was explained to me and they always asked me if I had questions. Nothing was rushed, everything was done to put me at ease. After the surgery, I stayed 2 days at the clinic and the staff was great. I got sick the first night and felt bad for the nurses. But they never complained, never seemed annoyed when I called them (and I called them often!). They were also sensitive and sweet. I will never forget them.
</p>
<p>
At the asclépiade (the small recovery house where I stayed for a week), the staff, once again were amazing. They are loving human beings. You will spend a very good time there (and the food is fantastic ;))
</p>
<p>
At last, when I came back home, I missed them a lot. But it is very easy to either leave them a message on the phone (they call back really quickly) or send them an email. The first few weeks (because they were still adapting to the COVID situation) they took 24 to 48 hours to answer emails. It made me anxious but it was ok. Never hesitate to send a picture, they take the time to look at it and assess the situation.
</p>
<p>
So that’s it! I recommend them wholeheartedly. Once thing though. I speak French and I live in Montreal. It was a big plus for me. I guess it made it a lot easier to communicate and to make quick appointments. They speak English, yes,but I witnessed some surreal conversations with English speaking people where a lot of things were lost in translation.
</p>
<p>
I hope it will help you make your choice. Don’t hesitate to ask me more questions :)

You are most welcome :) if you choose to have your surgery there, you are in good hands. But never forget that you have the choice, it is still a very important part of your journey. Take the time to ask as many questions as you want during your pre-op appointment. Take care :)

I have my surgery with Bélanger on the 14th of October, I’m super excited and have been searching for something recent to put my mind at ease. You made my day with your post.
</p>
<p>
With COVID and all they told me visiting is at zero, so I am flying alone which is kind of getting me nervous.
</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t miss it’s for the world though!

I’m doing good. I am down to three dilations per day, I’m figuring out a routine and my spouse has moved away from being annoyed by it all to tolerant.

Overall happy with my surgery except for the hair deep inside my vagina. Had my surgery in 2005. Looks pretty natural and cis AND works fantastic, great orgasms, no problems peeing.

Had you found any way to remove the existing hair? Researching myself to see if electrolysis before surgery is necessary or if there is some way post op to take care of that.

I heard another user mention something about having a gynecologist cauterize the hairs post-op! Just wanted to mention that if it’s something you still wanted to look into.
</p>
<p>
Sorry if this is too personal, but is the hair being deep inside uncomfortable or painful? Or just upsetting when you notice it?

It&#39;s upsetting mostly. Not painful or uncomfortable. Dr Brassard cauterized my hairs post-op, it made no difference. They are deep inside my vagina.

Ah okay, makes sense at a certain point you would see or feel that. Well every body is different and unique so if it doesn’t cause any issue it’s not the worst thing in the world.
</p>
<p>
I’ve just heard some hit or miss stuff out of GRS MTL, and being in ON they were my planned clinic. Wanted to talk to some girls who’ve been through it already.

Dr. Brassard was trained by Dr. Menard who was probably the best surgeon of the 1990s.  I knew girls done by both doctors who were pleased with their results.

I haven&#39;t had surgery with them yet but have my GRS with them coming up this Wednesday. I&#39;ve been in contact with the clinic for over two years now and while I did have problems with one admin clerc she seems to have left and everyone else I&#39;ve talked to there has been both delightfully pleasant and very helpful.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m part of a private Facebook group for GRS Montreal patients and though there are a few people who have mentioned complications the majority of the people in the group seem happy with their results and have nothing but good things to say about the clinic and staff. The few people that do seem to have complications and negative experiences seem like the type to me that over exaggerate and wouldn&#39;t be happy with anything but perfect results as they&#39;re usually minor and common complications that could happen with any surgeon and usually heal fine if given enough time.
</p>
<p>
I will say that you will need to find a doctor with experience with trans patients to do your follow up. The clinic will be there for you during your initial recovery but are very busy performing other surgeries and after you are discharged can&#39;t always answer questions about after care or complications within a reasonable time frame though they do try their best. Most of the complaints I hear are from people who don&#39;t understand this and expect Dr. Brassard personally to drop what he&#39;s doing and make time for them every time they have a minor problem.
</p>
<p>
Edit: also if you haven&#39;t checked out the subs wiki there&#39;s a ton of information, pictures and personal accounts from other patients linked on there specifically about GRS Montreal.
