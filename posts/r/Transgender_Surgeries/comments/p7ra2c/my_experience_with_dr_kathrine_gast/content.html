I just wanted to add my experience with trying to get bottom surgery with Dr.Gast I see mostly positive posts about her and that’s why I pursued going with her. But my experience was far from positive. First off, I called her offices in January to schedule a consult. The wait time on the phone was a whole hour before I got through to someone. The staff were very rude and after 20 mins of giving all my info as a new patient they told me I can’t make a consult until I have 2 therapist letters. I very much know you have to have the letters for surgery but I just wanted a consult just to see if she was someone I’d like to go with since I was also getting consults with other doctors as well. It wasn’t set in stone to go with her or anything. The fact to you have to have your 2 letters before they would even let you speak with her was beyond me. I got my letters very quickly (within a month) just so I could schedule a consult with her. So this is February by now. I had to wait 30 mins on the phone before I got through to their office.  Again they were short and rude. They said the soonest I could get a consult would be the middle of October (keep in mind this was scheduled all the way from February). I found that to be a ridiculous wait time for just a consult. I went ahead and accepted the October slot. Well about 3 weeks later they cancelled my October appointment out of the blue and said I’d have to reschedule again… and further out on calendar. I just dropped the whole thing from that point. All other doctors I consulted with got me in super quick to talk and never required letters just to talk to them. I’m sure others have had better luck with her but just wanted to post my own personal experience with her gender services.

I went to UW for a different procedure. They’re trashy, the staff is like something from a honey booboo family reunion. I had similar treatment from them. Dr. Gast has been botching patients as of lately. I’d avoid.

Thanks for this information! I was under the impression she was very good bc when I researched her I found nothing but positive comments but now I’m learning this isn’t the case as time goes on. I’m glad I didn’t go with her!

Yeah you dodged a bullet. Dr. Gast botched me up something fierce, still trying to figure out just how wrong everything is down there.

I’m really glad I didn’t go with her now but hate that you got a botched surgery!

I&#39;m glad that you didn&#39;t! Don&#39;t worry though, I have found a surgeon who&#39;s willing to take a look at things so that&#39;s a bit exciting. A proper revision may still be in my future
