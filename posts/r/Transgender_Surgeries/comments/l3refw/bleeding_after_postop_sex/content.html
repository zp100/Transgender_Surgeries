Any chance it was just too much friction and a little more lube could help?

Honestly that is quite possible, especially seeing as how I’m the first trans woman my partner has ever been with. So he’s usually quick to be like, alright let’s get it going! When maybe I actually need a little more prep work beforehand. I appreciate your comment!

Do you have any indication if the bleeding is due to insufficient depth, or width? Does your orange dialator fit easily, or is it a struggle to get in?
</p>
<p>
Because, I imagine if you have sufficient width and not depth, he may be able to just not &#39;go too deep&#39;. 5 dots is probably over 5&#34;, which should give most average guys decent penetration (perhaps not &#39;to the hilt&#39;, but enough for pleasure?). Trying to go deeper when he&#39;s hit your apex is probably not going to end well. Our vaginas are not as flexible as cis vaginas.
</p>
<p>
But if the width is insufficient, then it really doesn&#39;t matter how deep he goes or doesn&#39;t go. I imagine it would be hurting you from the first inch.

If it&#39;s depth, they make a slip over restrictor (for him), so he can&#39;t go too deep.

I think it&#39;s

Everyone responding has good responses so read theirs for some good suggestions, I don&#39;t need to repeat them here.
</p>
<p>
However one potential thing hasn&#39;t been mentioned: Is there a chance you may have small bits of granulation tissue inside of you?
</p>
<p>
If so, it could be that the smooth dilator isn&#39;t irritating it when you dilate, but having sex is rougher than dilation and could be irritating granulation and causing it to bleed.

I know this is gonna sound annoying but possibly get back on a more regular dilating schedule until you get used to having sex with no bleeding.
</p>
<p>
Even though your schedule is significantly reduced after all this time, since you hadn’t had sex till now it would prob be good to get back into a daily routine just to adjust. You shouldn’t be bleeding every time you do it. The first few times is normal. But please use tons of lube. And dilate more just so you don’t have issues. Best of luck and positive vibes for lots of wonderful sex in the future !

ah I remember a youtube transgender girl had something similar. She had sex then saw blood afterwards you can watch these videos to see how it went for her.
</p>
<p>
Part 1 her first time experience having sex she brought up how she was bleeding afterwards.
<a href="https://youtu.be/5IZD_Nw7D0w">https://youtu.be/5IZD_Nw7D0w</a>
</p>
<p>
Part 2 post op 6-months She mentioned more about it.
<a href="https://youtu.be/AmYImOCmBeM">https://youtu.be/AmYImOCmBeM</a>
</p>
<p>
Part 3 near the end she mentioned about tearing and some blood. 2 years post op
<a href="https://youtu.be/Fy5YmlM_zag">https://youtu.be/Fy5YmlM_zag</a>

It should stop after a while once it&#39;s gotten used to the stretching and tugging. It&#39;s probably just tiny tears of the skin.
