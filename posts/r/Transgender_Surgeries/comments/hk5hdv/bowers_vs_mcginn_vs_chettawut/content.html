These are my top three choices based off all the research I’ve done. My priorities in order of highest to lowest are sensation, appearance, and any amount of self lubrication. I know Chet is best with appearance, but can a labiaplasty help with appearance afterwards if I go with Bowers or McGinn?

I have Crohn’s disease so unfortunately peritoneal isn’t an option for me. Thanks!

I was deciding between those three names a little over 6 years ago. I went with chett because at the time I read and heard that he was the best for aesthetics, which were most important to me. I think I made the wrong decision.
</p>
<p>
One of the things chett does, and mentions on his website, is that the clitoris and hood is in a forward position, since that is also the most forward projecting part in cis vulvas. Even though that&#39;s an understandable way to approach making these parts out of the available material, it make for a less cis aesthetic imo. In some cis vulvas, that &#34;projection&#34; is literally like 2 mm, and chett&#39;s projection can be 5x that. As far as I can tell, this is because the clitoris in trans patients is often left much larger than a cis vulva would have for sensation reasons (I&#39;d argue that this in itself is unnecessary, but ALL surgeons do it). This, along with the projection that chett seems to do rather than the sunken look of most surgeons, can result in something that looks a lot like when trans men have from taking T. It took me getting the surgery to understand that.
</p>
<p>
Anecdotally, I think patients who are arent circumsized have much better chett results because he&#39;s able to make hooding with that more delicate skin. If you&#39;re circumsized, he just uses penial skin which is thicker and adds to that projected, bulky look of the clitoris and hood. This bothers me a lot about my result, and I&#39;m looking into a third revision to reposition and fix that.
</p>
<p>
Something else to consider is that chett does non-inversion and the other two do inversion, so you should consider the material you have. If you think you have probably enough penile skin for inversion but either lost (due to hrt) or never had much scrotal skin imo that&#39;s a bit of a reason to choose against chett. He has to use skin grafts if you don&#39;t have enough scrotal skin, and this might just be a personal thing, but I didn&#39;t like the idea of normal skin grafts to build the canal.
</p>
<p>
Between Bowers and McGinn is difficult. Both are great. I went to McGinn for an aesthetic revision and I&#39;m pretty happy with what she did, she&#39;s a wonderful surgeon, I just wish I was more clear about what I want. She was very quick to assume what I wanted, and then tbh, she wasn&#39;t able to do exactly what she said she could. But still, if we&#39;re talking about results, I was very happy.

I went to Dr. Chettawut, I think my results speak for themselves. The Thai surgeons are generally better than the US surgeons, in my opinion.

I don’t get the hype for Bowers, I think her target demographic is the Susan’s crowd.

<p>
Why do you say that? Just because she&#39;s older than a lot of surgeons? TBH that&#39;s kind of a shitty take.
</p>
<p>
She has more experience than most of the currently practicing surgeons in the US. She is reponsible for a huge number of the modern techniques used in GRS -- she either revised or straight up invented them. She has spent the past few years training quite a few other surgeons and helping several hospitals get their trans surgical programs up and running, because she&#39;s getting closer to the age of retirement a wants to make sure more trans folks have access to surgery, from quality surgeons, once that happens. She also volunteers a ton of her time to help surgically repair victims of Female Genital Mutilation, for free.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s one of the best, most-respected GRS surgeons in the world, and she&#39;s very much earned that reputation. If it wasn&#39;t for her, we may very likely not have the kind of results GRS surgeons are able to provide these days. There&#39;s a reason she has a 3-year waitlist.

<p>
I would love to read it :)  I am leaning heavily to Dr. McGinn atm, but would love to hear someone else&#39;s opinion.  I have not seen too much of Dr Bluebond Langner&#39;s work and getting a consultation just to ask questions is is a waiting game :|  Especially given Dr. McGinn work and how I could always down the road get a revision for peritoneal if I lost depth, but knowing that I have McGinn&#39;s aesthetic which I am not sure about Langner&#39;s.

<p>
The wiki doesn&#39;t have any posts showing her aesthetics, and there are none on her &#34;website&#34;.  Where can I see some results?
</p>
<p>
Edit: I haven&#39;t heard of Dr. McGinn&#39;s patient having issues peeing straight, is this a common issue she has?  From everything I have read anyone who has srs doesn&#39;t pee straight for a month+ from swelling

Why you do not go to the Suporn Clinic, it is cosmetically superior to Bowers and Chett (McGinn&#39;s aesthetic is very good), that is if you should consider it a 2-step surgery because they use a technique where they leave more tissue in case there are any complications (after revisión everything looks perfect), they create a secondary sexual organ for more sensitivity, the depth is very good (at least 6 inches) and the pre and postoperative care is the best of them all.
