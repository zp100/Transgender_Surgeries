Hi there
</p>
<p>
I’m just reading that Suporn Clinic test for ‘addictive substances including cannabis’ during pre-op assessment.
</p>
<p>
Could anyone who has been recently please confirm how testing is done (blood / urine etc)
</p>

That’s interesting. I wonder if it’s new.
</p>
<p>
I’d suggest you stop. It’s not worth getting your surgery cancelled, and I doubt you can rebook if it does happen.
</p>
<p>
They do have blood tests prior to surgery and presumably it wouldn’t be hard to add one more. I’ve no idea if they actually do.

I’m two months away from surgery and only smoked as a one-off, so will def be gone from blood and urine by then. Just concerned about them doing a hair test, which is obviously very unlikely.

They said one month so presumably that’s all they will test for, assuming they even do that. If they tested for longer and then charge a fee there would be no end of trouble.

I imagine it’ll just be part of blood tests (which would only test for use in the past few days) but will obvs not use again

I don&#39;t think they ever actually test this in any way shape or form. They only write it to scare you out of consuming weed. However, probably best to stop if you can
</p>
<p>
Patients definitely consume cannabis there while recovering. I don&#39;t recommend it &amp; anecdotally the big stoners seem to have difficult recoveries

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s new but I also don&#39;t think they check.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s just standard fare for the clinic to say scary things in the hopes patients will comply. After a while dealing with them you kinda get a sense for when they are kinda bullshitting you for your own good
