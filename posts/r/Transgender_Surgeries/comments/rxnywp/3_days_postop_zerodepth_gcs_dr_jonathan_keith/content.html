I&#39;ve been laying here in a spacious room in a new wing at St. Barnabas for a few days, and my head is just about clear enough to get my thoughts out coherently, so here&#39;s my contribution to the transgender medical knowledge base.
</p>
<p>
This is my first surgery of any kind ever, so I have nothing to compare my experience to, but I couldn&#39;t imagine a better one. The floor that I&#39;m on is an ICU step-down, and specifically contracted with Dr. Keith&#39;s practice to care for his post-op patients. That last bit is important, because every member of the medical staff here is trained in trans/gnc sensitivity, and for many of them, working with trans patients is part of their vocation. So when I say I&#39;ve been treated with flawless dignity and respect, I mean I expected one or two clumsy moments and maybe some over-eager allyship. There has been none of that. Apart from being the entire reason I&#39;m in the hospital at all, my trans-ness has been as much of an issue as my religion. (Probably less so, tbqh. The charge nurse pulled quite a few strings to get the chaplain to this floor when I requested her). Well, except for one thing. I&#39;ve not been able to shave for 4 days, and I&#39;m on a blood thinner, so I can&#39;t use a razor. When I told them how incredibly dysphoric 4 days of stubble made me feel, they went out and bought an electric shaver.
</p>
<p>
The care has also been incredible. Someone is in here hourly at the very least to check in on me. Pain management and mitigation has been the top priority. The staff is responsive and caring and encouraging. If I have questions or concerns, they&#39;re taken seriously and fully answered - and this is for doctors and nurses.
</p>
<p>
As for the aesthetics, well, you have no idea exactly it&#39;s going to look until the swelling goes down, but the picture I saw that was taken at surgery looked just like a cis vulva.
</p>
<p>
Tl;dr, I&#39;m thrilled with my experience so far. AMA, and if I can answer, I will.

Congratulations! I was set to have my surgery with him on Monday, but St Barnabas is closing down due to Covid.

It looks just like a cis vulva, and that&#39;s the aesthetics I was going for. Mostly I want to be able to wear cute tight clothes without a bulge. And I don&#39;t need any depth for the kind of sex I like, so all of the maintenance a neo-vagina requires is just not worth it for me. There&#39;s a good two knuckles worth of depth there in the little dimple, and that&#39;s really all I need.

If you&#39;re a lesbian that was a very good way of hinting to that

Marketers of strap-on dildos might disagree, but, yeah. It&#39;s the gay girl&#39;s discount.

Did you get a blood thinner after surgery? And how long do you need to use it for? üê∏

Congrats. Had same surgery with Dr. Jonathan Witten in January 2021. Basically the same hospital set up. They use a physician owned hospital that is pretty small. Care was extremely personal and amazing. I‚Äôm extremely happy with my choice and results.  Glad to hear everything is going well for you!  Wishing you a continued safe, speedy and successful recovery.
