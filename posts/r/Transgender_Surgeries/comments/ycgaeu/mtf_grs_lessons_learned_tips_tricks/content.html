Number 1, you cannot go it alone. You might, MIGHT be able to pry yourself out of bed and shuffle around microwaving Hot Pockets, but you need someone to drive out and pick things up at the very least. Surgery takes a lot out of you and you will be under both a driving restriction and a lifting restriction. You&#39;re also going to need someone to take out the garbage and do your laundry because you will create a lot of both, and DoorDash is not going to help you with that.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t already have one, set up a Venmo account so you can reimburse your friends for fetching stuff for you.
</p>
<p>
Buy a bulk pack of toilet paper. You&#39;re going to be cleaning up a lot of urine until your swelling goes down because it goes all over your butt. It&#39;s also good for mopping water off your butt after you irrigate so you don&#39;t get discharge all over your towels.
</p>
<p>
Buy a donut cushion. It&#39;s possible the hospital will not give you one. Mine didn&#39;t. And then they asked me to get out of bed on my second day and sit in a chair. It was like trying to squat fuck a cactus.
</p>
<p>
Get plenty of fluids. Buy a tumbler with a lid, keep it filled with ice and your drink of choice. You may be pissing like a racehorse, but it&#39;s better than drying out. Staying hydrated will help keep your BMs soft and help with suture pain. It also helps if the nurses have to stick you for an IV again, because if you are dehydrated, your vessels will be &#34;flat&#34; and they&#39;ll stick you full of holes looking for a good vein. I ran into this problem at my emergency revision and my arms looked like I&#39;d been handling rattlesnakes.
</p>
<p>
Get a soft blindfold and foam earplugs with a rating of at least 32. This will make it infinitely easier to sleep in the hospital. The best blindfold I&#39;ve ever had, I bought a fleece beanie and cut the top out of it to let the heat out, leaving me with a fleece headband. If it gets too loose, you can wash/dry it and it will tighten back up. I suggest at least two so you can wear one while the other is being washed.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you use the incentive spirometer frequently. If your lungs get used to lying down, you can stop breathing when you fall asleep. Opioids can also contribute to this, called &#34;respiratory depression.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Raise the foot of your hospital bed to support your butt, so you&#39;re not constantly sliding down the top of your bed and putting tension on your sutures. I&#39;m not saying this caused the necrosis that destroyed half of my vagina, but I&#39;m not NOT saying that. When you get home or have to stay in a hotel, you can approximate this by putting pillows under your thighs. Pull the outer ends of the pillows up to support your hips instead of the middle of your butt, to avoid putting pressure on your sutures.
</p>
<p>
The day you get discharged, make sure the nurse gives you a good supply of irrigation equipment before you leave. Red Robin catheters, bottles of saline, and saline syringes. At first, until you heal up enough to give your immune system a break, this stuff will be single use only, and you will go through a lot of them. Later on, you can wash the catheters with antibacterial soap and reuse them.
</p>
<p>
When you run out of saline solution or in a few weeks, you can mix a few drops of baby shampoo with tap water for irrigating, then rinse the shampoo out with tap water. I do 3 syringes of shampoo water, 3 syringes of tap water.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of irrigating, warm water can alleviate anal cramps if that&#39;s a recurring problem you have now, like me.
</p>
<p>
Look up &#34;MedPride&#34; bacteriostatic lube on Amazon. The tubes don&#39;t look big but they go a long way. This is for dilating, but if you don&#39;t drink enough water and your stool dries up, it can also help pave the way, so to speak.
</p>
<p>
Stock up on pajama/lounge pants. They&#39;re roomy and comfortable, and unlike sweatpants won&#39;t make you sweat as bad when you have hot flashes from going off HRT. Personally I like flannel.
</p>
<p>
Buy a bunch of &#34;chucks,&#34; or incontinence pads, for catching blood and discharge when you dilate, so you can dilate lying on the bed without wrecking your sheets. EDIT: You can use unscented puppy pads as well, as they are cheaper.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re going to want rolls of gauze, and lots of them, the longer the better. By &#34;lots&#34; I mean have your friends buy up every box they can find. Unroll them, fold them into a bundle appx the size of your surgery site. Place over your vagina and pull your underwear on over them. You want rolls, not pads, squares, or sponges. You want your &#34;fluff&#34; very fluffy, thick, and soft to protect your sutures. You&#39;ll probably soak through them with discharge, and it will take too many individually-packaged gauze squares to achieve the texture you want.
</p>
<p>
The mesh panties they give you at the hospital are a lot less abrasive than the leg holes on your personal underwear. Get as many as you can, they&#39;re great for the first few weeks because they won&#39;t rub your lateral sutures as bad.
</p>
<p>
You might hear a lot about buying maxipads, but in my experience they&#39;re bad about rubbing on your lateral sutures. They&#39;re stiffer and more abrasive than you expect. Stick with gauze fluff until you&#39;re more confident about how tender your sutures are.
</p>
<p>
You may feel like you have a lot of energy at first. This is a lie. It will run out faster than you think. It will run out before you understand what&#39;s happening. Take it easy and let people do things for you. Avoid stairs if possible.
</p>
<p>
DO NOT SKIP DILATING. You can lose depth, depending on your healing ability. I lost an inch of depth because the surgeon didn&#39;t let me dilate or rinse the week after my emergency vulvoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Pee and poop before you dilate. It will be easier to relax if you&#39;re not worrying about peeing on yourself, and easier to get the dilator in if there&#39;s no stool obstructing your canal from the other side.
</p>
<p>
Stool softeners are a MUST, especially if the nurses have you taking oxycodone. I&#39;ve found success with
<del>
2 Dulcolax tablets (one in the morning, one before bed) and
</del>
a capful of Miralax in 8oz Vitamin Water a day. You can also mix the Miralax into cold brew coffee with liquid creamer. I&#39;ve found that either one masks the Miralax significantly.
</p>
<p>
You won&#39;t be able to push a poo because the increase in blood pressure can make your incisions spray blood (something I personally did not enjoy). And if you don&#39;t drink enough water, your stool will dry up into a brick and be impossible to get out, especially if you are still taking opioid painkillers. Yeah, with the Miralax it&#39;ll be like wiping a marker, as Andy would say. But it&#39;s better than crying and trying to shit driftwood logs at 3 in the morning.
</p>
<p>
Buy a few medicinal enemas, just in case.
</p>
<p>
Flushable wet wipes, grab a store brand bulk 5-pack at least. Keep a pack on your nightstand to wipe your hands and face, and a pack on the back of the toilet.
</p>
<p>
If you can, and don&#39;t already have one, buy a bidet. Super easy to install with a pair of channel-lock pliers. Do this BEFORE your surgery, while you&#39;re still mobile. The cold water can aggravate anal cramps, but it cuts down on wiping.
</p>
<p>
Buy a box of surgical gloves. If you don&#39;t drink enough water, you&#39;ll be glad you got them. Keep your fingernails clipped short.
</p>
<p>
A strong cup of coffee first thing in the morning can boost your energy enough to get you started on dilating and rinsing. It can also augment the laxatives.
</p>
<p>
Get a bottle of HibiClens. Put a few squirts in your peri peri bottle, fill the rest with warm water, shake, and use it to rinse your surgery site in the shower. Rinse off with shower water. If you&#39;re still too tender, block the water with your fingers and let the runoff course across the site. You can also rinse out the bottle and use that to rinse.
</p>
<p>
Eat even if you don&#39;t feel like it. You&#39;re going to need the energy, and in the early days of your recovery most of the food will go to healing. Breakfast will be super important, especially in the hospital. Omelets and bacon are your friend.
</p>
<p>
Depending on your mobility, get a shower chair for irrigating your vagina. It&#39;s a lot easier to get up from, and cleaner, than lying on the bathtub floor. Sit on the edge of the chair and lean back with one foot on the wall to brace yourself, one foot on the edge of the tub. Use a hand mirror to insert the irrigation catheter, and once it&#39;s in you can tuck the end of the catheter into the crease of your groin to hold it while you fill the saline syringe.
</p>
<p>
Unless you scrub the bathtub out with Comet and a brush, your bathtub floor is very dirty and can cause a yeast infection. I do not endorse sitting or taking a sitz bath in it.
</p>
<p>
The chair will also come in handy when you are allowed to take showers again, because when you start running out of energy and get lightheaded, you can sit down or get on your knees in front of it and rest your elbows on it. Make a habit of tightening the wingnuts affixing the legs to the seat.
</p>
<p>
Because of the general anesthesia, your eyes may get blurry during recovery, probably temporary, and I guess it depends on how old you are. Buy reading glasses in a range of powers, you&#39;ll be glad you did when you realize it&#39;s a lot easier to read your phone.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re driving a long way for surgery or follow-up appointments like me, put everything you need in your purse or backpack THE NIGHT BEFORE or even earlier. Paperwork, meds, entertainment, debit card, keys, etc. That way you&#39;re not running around the next morning at 7AM freaking out because you can&#39;t find this or that.

The chucks are unnecessarily expensive, so you can just buy doggy pee pads. It might make you feel like a b****, but they&#39;re the same thing.

Seconding not going it alone. Aside from a ride home from the airport post op, I had to, and it was fucking hell. I knew that was the situation months ahead of time so I had stocked up on pretty much everything I needed, but completely underestimated the emotional toll it would take on me, and some 7 months and change later am just starting to unpack and process how traumatic the first few weeks really were.
</p>
<p>
If I had the choice, I&#39;d go back and postpone until I had that support structure. In a fucking heartbeat.

Thank you for the detailed write up. This all sounds like such an ordeal, and it&#39;s looking increasingly likely that I won&#39;t have much support during my surgery.
</p>
<p>
I have my date next April with Dr. Jun, but to be honest, I feel like I&#39;m losing my nerve. The photos and stories on this subreddit are so harrowing. I&#39;m beginning to feel I can&#39;t do it, or don&#39;t want it bad enough to try.

You do want it bad enough - remember that the perspective here is skewed.

It&#39;s hard, but brief. And you likely won&#39;t have as hard an experience as I did. For one, I was at a university hospital, and the nurses taking care of me were actively learning right in front of me--I actually had to reassure a couple of them when they seemed frazzled or rushed.
</p>
<p>
For another, I had severe complications that necessitated an emergency revision a week after I was discharged. My recovery has been significantly more difficult than it should have been. If you can get away with a healthy result right out of the gate, you&#39;re golden.

Oh hey, I’m seeing Dr. Jun next April too!  Maybe we’ll bump into each other? :)

I definitely feel you on the lacking support.  Just praying that my Mom is willing to spend the first week or two with me.

Absolutely do NOT re-use catheters. Even after washing with antibacterial soap as recommended in the post above. You will be putting yourself at great risk of UTI which can ascend and cause pyelonephritis if severe. Always use catheters as directed by your surgeon/healthcare specialist. NEVER reuse catheters ever!!!

They&#39;re not going into the urethra, they&#39;re being used in the vaginal canal, which is considered a clinically &#34;dirty&#34; environment. They&#39;re used in conjunction with the saline syringes to irrigate the vaginal canal. I was instructed by the nurses at the hospital that I would have to wash them and reuse them after I asked for more irrigation equipment at my second operation.
</p>
<p>
Do not reinsert catheters into your urethra. That can give you a UTI. And always wash your hands before you irrigate!

The first time, for my initial vaginoplasty, I was in the hospital for a week. The second time a week later for my emergency vulvoplasty, I stayed the night and that was it, but that procedure was all external reconstructive cosmetics. They didn&#39;t enter my canal.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think anybody would let you go home the day after a vaginoplasty, and to be honest if they did I wouldn&#39;t trust them. Just getting over the anesthesia takes a couple of days, it roundly fucks you six ways to Sunday. I threw up four times in the OR recovery room and didn&#39;t eat until midnight the next night, just because (a) I felt like hell, and (b) I wasn&#39;t lucid enough to use the room phone. I couldn&#39;t even get out of bed until the fourth or fifth day.
</p>
<p>
And that&#39;s outside of the nurses needing to keep an eye on your vitals. Personally I bled so much that I was sitting in a puddle of it for several days every time they changed my chucks. The first night or so was especially brutal. Ever since then I&#39;ve been eating like a horse and I&#39;ve only just now got my strength back weeks later.
</p>
<p>
I cannot fathom a reality in which a reputable hospital would let you go home the day after a full-depth vaginoplasty, or a reality where anybody would want to. I&#39;m a security officer in good physical shape, and I was in the Army for a decade. I&#39;ve been through some Real Shit, and this operation knocked me full on my ass.

Many  thanks for the detailed reply. Glad to know you have recovered well.
<br>
I agree with your opinion that any place that releases you right after major surgery is asking for a lawsuit...
<br>
Thx, Be well.

Re: not going it alone
</p>
<p>
For the first month, which I&#39;ll be spending in a hotel room, I plan on having a different friend take care of me each week because none of them can be away for the whole month.
</p>
<p>
Any thoughts on this?

I like this idea. The hotel room, not so much, that sounds like its own kind of hell, but having a rotating crew sounds pretty choice. They won&#39;t have time to get tired of the routine, and you&#39;ll have someone fresh most of the time.

Re: gauze
</p>
<p>
My surgeon (Gabriel Del Corral at MedStar Health Franklin Square) recommended gauze as well, but with two extra bits: moisten the gauze, and insert it into the vaginal opening. I don&#39;t know if those are general recommendations he gives to all patients  or if they applied specifically to cases like mine, as he was helping me deal with some slight dehiscence along my incision and at the edge of my vaginal opening.

What do you mean by irrigating with a catheter? I never did anything like that and my surgeon never mentioned something like that either.
</p>
<p>
Not sure about the bacteriostatic lube either. My instructions were to use vaginal metronidazole gel to dilate and after than ran out to use KY jelly or Surgilube.
</p>
<p>
As far as clothes go I&#39;d recommend no underwear unless absolutely needed to go out and then wear panties with elastic in a much larger size  than you normally wear so that they&#39;re very loose. Definitely would recommend not wearing pants and sticking to skirts at least for a couple week.
</p>
<p>
Also gauze squares and manuka honey work well for dehiscense at the opening or a little bit inside.

It&#39;s a tiny tube about a foot long that you insert into the vaginal canal as far as you can get it, and wash out the discharge and lube from dilating. You attach a saline syringe to the other end and push fluids into the vagina to flush it out.
</p>
<p>
Once it heals, I&#39;ll probably figure out something less annoying.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, follow your doctor&#39;s advice. This post is just supplemental in case you&#39;re left hanging, like I was.

I just douche with warm water. That&#39;s what my doctor recommended.

This is amazing advice, thank you so much for the level of detail. My partner is having surgery in December and I&#39;m going to use this to write our shopping list

Interesting notes thank you so much  But not everyone has a partner and shopping for food is easily done on line for delivery  Also hornones of taken trans dermal need not be stopped at all  oth pre op and post op even WPATH new standards of care include this  Plenty of research showing that stopping HRT pre op for 4 weeks etc has no benefits at all and is not grounded in any science at all  In fact patches of bio identical estrogen are incredibly safe ( I don’t include people with pre existing conditions of clotting disorders etc )  Very useful.Notes needs to be made into short book and sold on internet ! Thank you 😊
