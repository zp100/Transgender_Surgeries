There&#39;s was another post a while ago describing something similar to your experience.

I suspect that means whatever you signed is not legally binding.

I did read it and yes I had a similar experience. I was bleeding to death in my own bed. My girlfriend took time off work because of how sick I was. I begged her not to leave me and I’m glad she didn’t. The doctors said that if I had waited a few more hours it would be a very different story and I would have passed away.

And I can’t tell people not to go to Dr Brassard. He is a very skilled surgeon. My vagina looks beyond pretty. I’m blown away by the results. He’s also the only surgeon in Canada that preforms these surgeries. There’s so many women and men waiting to see him because es the only option.
</p>
<p>
I do feel like we’re on an assembly line though. I was rushed in and rushed out... it was basically one week at the recovery centre and then that’s it. I was on my own.

it though? I&#39;d be curious to see what kind of surgery this mystical man performs where he has so many horror stories and yet walks out smelling like a rose, especially considering that I can&#39;t find anything online.

I&#39;m not entirely sure, so take this with a pinch of salt, but I think I remember reading a comment claiming Brassard requires his patients to sign some sort of non-disclosure agreement prior to surgery. If that is indeed a thing it might explain why he&#39;s still around despite all the horror stories.

I walked away with the same assembly line feeling. My surgeon even told me it was all about the numbers to the hospital.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t have have to deal with near death or travel stuff, but did get to experience an 11-month horrorshow of recovery with all kinds of other complications. Be really careful, because just when you think you&#39;re out of danger and feel like you can be more active, things can sneak up on you. I&#39;m really glad to hear the aesthetics are good. There&#39;s nothing worse than paying the price and ending up with a unsatisfying disaster for an outcome.

I’m not saying it was his fault. No one knows what happened exactly. I am actually very bitter towards him and his clinic and do not wish to have future dealings with them because of how I was treated when I got home. They dismissed a lot of my concerns over here home calls and emails. They had told me the bleeding was normal. To an extreme yes bleeding is normal post op, but the pictures of the blood pouring out of me should have been a huge concern for them...
</p>
<p>
But I met a ton of women out there who had positive experiences. They’re healing extremely well. They’re up and walking around now and preparing to get back to work. As for me I’m struggling to move around. I’m sore and weak.
</p>
<p>
Complications with SRS aren’t unheard of. It’s an extremely invasive surgery and there’s a lot of variables and things that can go wrong... I’m not going to blame him, but I do blame the nurses on staff that I called repeatedly but assured me that I was fine. They didn’t seem to care.
</p>
<p>
Oh and the whole clinic conveniently went on Holliday’s from the 27th of July to August 17th and have one nurse on staff to answer questions and emails. Don’t expect hem to care once you are sent home. They don’t. They nearly killed me by assuring me my bleeding was normal.

I’m happy to hear that this post is informing others. I don’t want to cause any fear, and I don’t wish to tell anyone they shouldn’t get bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
As for me, I’m slowly healing. After everything I went through post op it’s going to take me a few weeks before I’m able to get back on my normal routine of dilating and aftercare.

I’m one year post with Brassard. My personal experience? In short:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Textbook results
</li>
<li>
No complications
</li>
<li>
No major pain issues; Tylenol and Advil only
</li>
<li>
No hairs
</li>
<li>
I like the look, but not much labia minora to speak of, as long as you’re ok with that
</li>
<li>
minor hypergranulation got treated at Three Bridges easily
</li>
<li>
pain never exceeded a 4/10 in first 10 days; never more than 2/10 afterwards
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now,
</p>
<p>
In my 9-woman cohort that week, two had major bleeding problems. One got home and just about didn’t make it. One had pain issues because imo, they were young and unprepared for mental pain management. Another was catheter related and once it was out, she was good to go.
</p>
<p>
Another friend about 9 months prior had major pain issues and had a bleeder that wasn’t checked on during her first night post-surgery and nearly bled out.
</p>
<p>
Here’s my current opinion (change my mind!):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
There is a culture of nurses who fail to escalate or are otherwise dismissive of patients’ complaints that is dangerous and needs to be addressed. As a stop-gap, you need to either have a strong advocate with you during your stay, or be a strong advocate yourself. This shouldn’t be necessary but it is until the culture changes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you are in a major urban area with educated post-GRS care, then you will likely be fine. If not, you need to seriously check yourself on your acceptable risk. This is tantamount to brain surgery without immediate follow up care short of a flight back to Montreal. Are you prepared for that?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you haven’t managed significant pain before, you may be unprepared for the relentless nature of managing pain over weeks. Pain killers are not going to do all the work. You need to do the work too. Dropped something on your toe? That’s what the catheter coming out will feel like. Healed from a broken bone? There’s your GRS recovery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Surgery is complex. They aren’t shitting you when they say complications can occur and be life threatening. Take this seriously and balance with your dysphoria. Which of these are you better able to live with?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you have anxiety and depression issues outside of your genitally related dysphoria, and these issues are not under control through medication and therapy, it will make your recovery worse. Particularly when you are left to deal with your recovery by yourself. I did it and I was fine, but I recognize that not everyone is privileged to have manageable mental health.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Brassard needs a better communications system and follow up process. Nobody seems to be able to get to him directly post-op. Lobby your provincial assessor/trans care body. Demand changes, and demand accountability. The provinces are paying Brassard’s clinic.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The guy isn’t a butcher. Stop that shitposting. If we actually had empirical data on outcomes that included all of the outcomes like mine, you’d see there are exceptions and a small number of problems occur. We are dealing with a complex surgery and I expect all surgeons get their complaints. I also note with interest that I see women posting (I’m part of a FB group as well) about masturbating at three weeks, fucking at five, and shit. Follow the rules, dammit.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Canada has the unique ability to collect quality empirical data on outcomes because of the way our socialized medical system uses Brassard almost exclusively. It’s long overdue that the provinces get together and measure the success/failures through the Brassard clinic and help make it the best in the world, and safer for everyone.
</p>
<p>
That is going to take all of Brassard’s patients lobbying their provincial trans care organizations.

I am about to finalize a date with Brassard in th coming weeks, and this terrifies me. He is the only option for us Canadians without having to travel to another country. I went with him mostly coz I have anxiety about travelling across countries and didn&#39;t wanna add any more complications to the process, but now I&#39;m super worried.

Don’t be hun... please?
</p>
<p>
What I went through is considered to be a small percentage... he is very good at what he does. I am not going to lie. You are in good hands, just don’t expect a ton of communication with GRS Montreal and their staff when you leave the clinic. They have basically abandoned me. Your stay at the recovery centre should be quite relaxing. Just try to eat a lot, stay hydrated and don’t push your body too hard.
</p>
<p>
But I had a lot of factors that may have led to this happening. I was also robbed the night before surgery. Someone broke into my apartment and stole a lot from me and my girlfriend came home to our apartment destroyed. I didn’t sleep at all that night and walked into the hospital with no sleep at all. My stay was rough, I barely ate, I pushed my self hard to get walking, I vaped, and was extremely constipated. I was a mess. But I was in high spirits and felt amazing!
</p>
<p>
I hope your journey is going to work well for you.

Thanks a lot for sharing that. I can&#39;t even imagine how difficult that must have been. I hope the recovery goes smooth for you from here onward. I try to keep myself fit and healthy by eating well, but so much is just on luck going your way :/.

I’m so sorry to hear about your experience. I had complications with Brassard as well and when my OBGYN contacted him for help he told her, “My patients don’t get complications. Send her to a wound care clinic”.
</p>
<p>
My stay at his clinic was so bad that I actually begged for assisted suicide. Sounds dramatic, but the mistake they made with my medication, and the uncaring attitude of the nurses, was enough to make a normally happy person suicidal.
</p>
<p>
Sure... I have a pretty vagina. But that’s all it has going for it. I can’t use it for sex.

Oh my god... I can’t believe this. I am not doubting this at all after everything I’ve been though... I am hoping I don’t lose depth at all...

I’m down to 2.5” because I had to stop dilating for a while.

I am shocked...
</p>
<p>
I cannot believe the response from Brassard! Bastard!
</p>
<p>
I get where your coming from begged my girlfriend to allow me to die, and asked for assisted suicide when I was hospitalized after I got home. The incredible amount of pain I was in, the fear of the unknown, not being able to dilate, not having a clue as to what to do. I wanted to die. I begged the doctors and they sent a psychologist and doctor to assess me. I wanted to die and was in a really dark place... I wish never to return there... ever...

I&#39;ve Soooo been there, just not with Brassard. You&#39;ll get through this, post-op depression can feel like the base of hell. Just understand that a lot of that feeling is being driven by your bodies response to all the trauma its been through and the anesthesia. You have to give yourself a week of recovery time for every hour you were under general.

It&#39;s these constant stories of neglect by him post op that have me thinking about petitioning my province to allow me to go outside the country for my surgery.  I never hear anything but horror stories about his clinic.

BC is working on providing alternatives. I’m currently working with them to get approved for an out of country depth revision.

Ontario was working on it as well, but who knows with Mr. Ford running things. My province just started covering the procedure this year so I don&#39;t know how much luck I will have with getting them to agree to out of country work.

I hear it’s getting worse. At one point they were a great clinic to get the surgery done at. They were way more caring and the stay was much longer. Now it seems we’re being rushed through as quickly as possible. Obviously he’s in it for the money because he does 4-5 of these surgeries a day and doesn’t meet with any of the patients afterwards and they only allow us to stay for a week instead of the nearly 2 weeks that it was before. I’m not sure if it was 2 but I’ve been told by quite a few people that it was.
</p>
<p>
What the system needs is clinics across Canada to help us post op because Brassard and his staff do not care about helping us at all. The right people need to be informed. I think he’s a skilled surgeon but they have a complete lack of care for us once we leave the recovery centre.

Time and again, nothing but horror stories from Brassard&#39;s office. I&#39;d sooner hack my own dick off DIY-style than go to him.

I underwent GRS 2 months ago and im healing very well but my neovagina looks strange. It has no labia majora and minora just the clitoris and urethra at the right place where it should be and it looks like the doctor just took the ball sack and sewed into my pelvic bone... Am I the only one going through this situation?  I feel like there is too much erectile tissue. What can I do? I felt relieved at first when I looked down there and saw a vagina but now I&#39;m starting to get anxious and depressed by the way it looks
