<h1>
Intro
</h1>
<p>
I want to share my experience because I struggled to find info like this when I was researching.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m MTF and 33 years old from the UK. I&#39;m funding my own treatments of course, because it’s not common to get any funding in the UK.
</p>
<p>
I was mainly interested in surgeons near the UK, and my max budget was approx. €35000.
</p>
<p>
I was initially drawn to Dr. Macía because both his rhinoplasty and forehead reduction results seemed very impressive in the before and after pictures on Instagram, and the info on his website was clear and reassuring.
</p>
<h1>
Consultations
</h1>
<h1>
Facifem
</h1>
<p>
I had a Skype consultation with Dr. Macía which cost €80. We talked about my goals for feminisation and he recommended that I didn&#39;t any other surgical treatments (eg. jaw, chin or tracheal shave) for feminisation. But that I would benefit from hairline lowering and forehead reduction and rhinoplasty. He said he aims to get natural results.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Macía also made a 2D model based on my face in profile to show how the forehead reduction and rhinoplasty would look. He was friendly and answered all my questions calmly. We spoke English and I left feeling impressed.
</p>
<p>
The quote from Facifem was €15620. This includes rhinoplasty, forehead reduction, orbital rim shaving, hairline lowering, 1 night stay in hospital (or more if needed), all hospital costs and aftercare etc.
</p>
<h1>
Facial team
</h1>
<p>
I also had a similar Skype consultation previously with Facialteam. They made the same treatment recommendations as Dr. Macía.
</p>
<p>
They seemed impressive too, but ultimately I was concerned that it&#39;s a group of surgeons and you don&#39;t know who you get on the day, so I decided I wouldn&#39;t go there for something as delicate and specific as a rhinoplasty.
</p>
<p>
The quote, for basically the same set of treatments was approx €27000. Although some of this was for the included the accommodation in Marbella, so realistically it costs roughly €10000 more than Facifem overall.
</p>
<h1>
Other
</h1>
<p>
I had scheduled a consultation with Dr. Taskov but cancelled it after I met Dr. Macía.
</p>
<p>
I tried to get a consultation with Nikhil Maini in England, but I couldn’t even get on the waiting list since he is so overbooked.
</p>
<p>
I considered Anna Slutzky because her results look great, but the travel, payment setup etc. was too sketchy for me.
</p>
<h1>
Appointment
</h1>
<p>
After the consultation I was in contact with the Facifem patient coordinator who discussed payment, and offered a surgery appointment approx. 6 months after the consultation.
</p>
<p>
During this 6 month period I was able to message the patient coordinator and the surgeon on Whatsapp to ask more questions. The surgeon was very responsive and answered all my messages.
</p>
<p>
I also had to get a blood test for clotting factors, and an x-ray of my forehead. I did the blood test with Randox, and the x-ray with Nuffield.
</p>
<h1>
The surgery day
</h1>
<p>
Dr. Macía performed a rhinoplasty, forehead reduction, orbital rim shaving, with hairline incision and hairline lowering on me about 3 weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
I arrived at the Madrid University hospital (where Dr. Macía operates) early in the morning. I met Dr. Macía at my private hospital room, and we clarified the details of the surgery by updating his digital models. Mostly around the size and shape of the nose. The model is important to him because this is exactly what he aims for in surgery.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards a nurse came with gowns, I got changed, then they wheeled me off to the theatre. I had a general anaesthetic via injection, then went to sleep thinking about my pet dog to calm me.
</p>
<p>
Then I woke up in the recovery room in the afternoon. I was under for about 5 hours. After I was fully awake I was wheeled back to my private room where my partner was resting on the sofa. She had received a WhatsApp message already to explain the surgery was a success and was sent a photo of my results from inside the operating theatre before they added the cast and bandages.
</p>
<p>
It was mostly quite calm after that. I snoozed on and off, nurses came to give medicine via IV then left. I had some water to sip then eventually they brought me lots of food at intervals. Some nurses spoke a little English, but mostly they only spoke Spanish.
</p>
<p>
The doctor visited in the evening and told me the surgery was a complete success, he checked my over and gave discharge papers for the following day at noon.
</p>
<p>
The next morning was similar, the nurses helped me to my feet, to walk a little, sit down etc. Basically made sure I was well after the GE wore off.
</p>
<h1>
The next 8 days
</h1>
<p>
I left the hospital the next day as planned. I took a taxi back to my airbnb, then basically lived on the sofa like a goblin, getting up only for bathroom, hygiene etc. My partner went to get food, prescription meds, and made sure I took my meds on schedule.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon had prepared prescriptions and aftercare instructions for me to take home.
</p>
<p>
I looked like a human again by about day 6 or 7 I guess. When most of the bruises and swelling were invisible.
</p>
<p>
On the 8th day after surgery I had a follow up appointment at the Facifem clinic with the nurse to remove stitches, remove nose cast, check everything and provide more aftercare instructions.
</p>
<h1>
Results
</h1>
<p>
Overall my results are great and I&#39;m very happy with it all.
</p>
<p>
I’m not going to post photos, I believe the existing before / after photos of other girls on the Facifem Instagram page are representative of my results.
</p>
<h1>
Rhinoplasty
</h1>
<p>
My nose is still a little bit swollen (it can take a year to go away completely), but at 3 weeks most other bruising has gone and any other remaining swelling is too subtle to easily notice. My nose is already cuter and smaller than before surgery, and the only visible scar underneath is not very noticeable.
</p>
<p>
Before surgery my nose was crooked and with a deviated septum (when I was a child some asshole threw a beanbag at my nose really hard and broke it). The rhinoplasty fixed both these issues, so now my nose is straight and my breathing is slightly improved.
</p>
<h1>
Forehead
</h1>
<p>
My forehead shape is everything I hoped for, it&#39;s now a very feminine and natural shape, same for orbital rims.
</p>
<p>
In profile my hooded eyes have opened up (yay now I can use eyeshadow!). I think there is still some swelling on my eyelids, so maybe they will open even more over time.
</p>
<p>
My hairline has advanced about 3cm, and a large portion of my receded hairline areas were erased, so my hairline looks more feminine. I expect that in the long term I will get some hair transplants to fill the small remaining areas, but I won&#39;t need much to get a nice round feminine hairline. This is what the surgeon explained during the consultation, that some patients get transplants later, but it’s best to wait 6 months at least.
</p>
<p>
My incision runs across the top of my hairline in a C shape and is already not very noticeable for most of the length. I have some prescription cream to reduce scarring over time.
</p>
<h1>
Complications
</h1>
<p>
Unfortunately a portion of my hairline incision separated slightly, so I am currently applying an antibiotic cream (prescribed by the surgeon) to avoid infection while it heals. I expect it will be a slightly wider scar in this section (maybe 1mm or 2mm thicker?) but time will tell. Once it has closed up again I will use the scar cream here too. I don’t blame the surgeon for this complication, and in the grand scheme it seems minor to me. It likely won’t have any real long term effects on my life, especially if I get hair transplants later, or wear a fringe (bangs).
</p>
<h1>
Summary / TL;DR
</h1>
<p>
I&#39;m super happy with my results and recommend Dr. Macía for all the treatments I received:  rhinoplasty, forehead reduction, orbital rim shave, hairline lowering.

Congrats on the surgery! Super happy to read everything went well and you&#39;re healing great.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m scheduled with him for Nov. 13th for the same thing, forehead + rhino/septoplasty (as I also have a deviated septum), and was going to make a sort of pre and post-op AMA as there&#39;s no information about his procedures.

Good luck with your surgery, I&#39;m confident everything will go smoothly, you are in safe hands.

Hey! Just popping by to provide an update: my surgery was a success!
</p>
<p>
Everything went exactly as you wrote above down to the T, so I won&#39;t be making a new post about it, but I&#39;m extremely happy with the results so far!
<br>
I had zero pain throughout it all, just some minor discomfort the first four days due to pressure from the forehead incision (expected, no surprise there), and both the doctor and his nurse treated me amazing.
</p>
<p>
Highly recommend Dr. Macia to anyone looking into FFS! Happy to answer anyone&#39;s questions about him/his work/the procedures.

I’m really looking up this Surgeon, as I’m from Spain , and his prices and work seems pretty fair compared to the others!
</p>
<p>
But as you did, I saw that a lot of his surgeries does not involve touching chin/jaw at all (you can’t find any examples of this on his page, for example), but that one of the procedures I’m more interested in…. Do you know something about it? Did the doctor showed u any examples of chin/jaw surgeries, and in that case, were they good…? Thank u!

Sorry but I didn&#39;t see any examples of jaw/chin work from him. Fortunately my face didn&#39;t need, so I didn&#39;t ask about it during the consultation.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you could contact the clinic and ask if they have posted examples anywhere on socials, or can show some in a consultation. In my consultation I asked about the number of surgeries performed for forehead reduction, and specifically type 3 reduction, complication rates etc. and he was happy to answer, but he didn&#39;t show me any more photo examples than were on the social media pages.

Hi! I also wanted to get chin lipo, buccal fat removed, and chin osteotomy as part of my FFS with him, but when I brought it up he told me it wouldn&#39;t help feminize my face as much as I think it would... which to me sounded like he either a) has little experience in that area and wants to save face (ie., stick to what he&#39;s good at and not ruin his reputation with bad or botched results), or b) doesn&#39;t think he can make a big difference performing them and doesn&#39;t want to deal with complaints, so he just refuses to do them.

Omg thank you so much for this! I’m interested in the same procedures you had done (except rhino, I like my nose as it is) and I’m from madrid, but I’ve haven’t met anybody that got stuff done with that surgeon and facial team has mixed reviews, so I’ll try and have a consultation with him 💖💖

Sure, I&#39;ve never heard of Dr Berenguer. But I only considered surgeons who specialise in transgender feminisation surgeries.
