Hi! Two weeks ago I (33nb/amab [he/they]) had a Penile Inversion Vaginoplasty without Orchiectomy (testes retained). My surgeon was Dr. Dany Hanna out of Texas.
</p>
<p>
The procedure was pretty standard overall. More scrotal tissue had to be left attached to house my testes externally in the outer labia and he anchored them in place. I have a clit and possibly inner labia. I&#39;m still very swollen so time will tell with aesthetics. Visually the results are consistent with Dr Hanna&#39;s work. I have almost 3&#34; of depth, that&#39;s as much as I could get with all things factored in.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m looking forward to finishing healing. Dr Hanna and team were awesome and he was VERY realistic with me every step of the way. He definitely delivered despite my having a rare request. He does recommend I get my testes examined every couple of year to ensure things are still good down there. I am not on hormones and do not require them.
</p>

Thanks! My dysphoria was centered around the phallus. PIV was the closest option to what felt right. Keeping the testes meant no hormones and a more controled physical changes since they still produce testosterone. I&#39;m also still fertile, so children are not totally out the picture in the future.

Yep, IVF may be an option since I technically still produce sperm. I&#39;m not planning on it, but it&#39;s at least still on the table.

Thanks a lot for the answer. I don&#39;t think any surgeon does that here. Did it cost you a lot of money or does your insurance covered it ?

I know one in USA and one in Mexico who does it. It&#39;s kinda rare to find a surgeon who ventures off from the norm, but definitely worth asking around if there&#39;s something specific needed.  Insurance covered the hospital stay. I had to pay the surgeon fees out of pocket, tbd if I get those reimbursed from insurance. For now, I put it on a credit card with 0% interest for 12mths. My insurance also has a $2k reimbursement for travel due to surgery.

Why did you want to retain your testes, if you don&#39;t mind me asking?

I replied above. Basically my dysphoria is phallus related and the testes have their benefits.

Interesting. I’m glad that people are pushing the boundaries of these surgical techniques.
</p>
<p>
You said you’re not on hormones, do you present as female? Have you had breast surgery or plan to?

I&#39;m happy to share. I have found very very little information on this specific procedure, and I&#39;ve been looking into it for over a decade. Since I have gone and done the procedure myself, I figured I&#39;d share to make it known that it is a possible option.

They simply were not cut off. They were repositioned to be closer to my body and less &#34;mobile&#34; so they don&#39;t move around.
