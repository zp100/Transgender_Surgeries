It‚Äôs about bed time for me and I just had a small fight with my husband. We just got married last week.
</p>
<p>
I found out today that I wasn‚Äôt the best sex he ever had (I‚Äôm a little butt hurt and very realistic). I understood why. We talked about how he can not penetrate me fully and how he only experience sensation at the tip of his penis and not his shaft.
</p>
<p>
Here is mine story:
</p>
<p>
I had srs with Satterwhite a little over 3 months now, which now I regretted at choosing him as my surgeon. P/s I will have srs over and over 100000%. I love having vagina.
</p>
<p>
When having consultation with Satterwhite over the phone, the was at least 45 minutes late. He spent more than half of the time talking about his credentials. I only asked for full depth not knowing how many inches I would get.
</p>
<p>
When I talked to his PA (Debby) 2 weeks before surgery request over 7-8 inches, she was flipping out over the idea how that is so impossible.
</p>
<p>
The day of surgery, I told Satterwhite again that depth is really important to me and I would like full depth. I was begging him. He said we might do skin craft.
</p>
<p>
A week after surgery when I dilated for the first time using the purple dilator. I barely got 2 dots in and 4 dots was fully visible any naked eyes. That was about 3 - 3.5 inches. At 4 months now, my depth was still at 3-3.5 inches. I brought up the concern only to be told that my body can handle so much!
</p>
<p>
I am an Asian person. 5‚Äô5‚Äù tall. 36 chest. 28 waist. When my penis was fully erected, it was 4.5 inches. I was on hormone at the age of 25. I experienced a full puberty just like any of my peers. I was uncircumcised.
</p>
<p>
I do not know what went wrong! I knew plenty of girls my size was able to achieve much greater depth. Even down to the last 2 dots or no visible dot.
</p>
<p>
My insurance was limited to align surgical and I regretted both top and bottoms surgery with them.
</p>
<p>
I have not experienced orgasm yet. I feel like I have wasted years of research on my own for nothing. I wish I have found this subreddit sooner.
</p>
<p>
What should I do from now on? Does any one know doctor that accept blue shield anthem that perform revision that improve on depth? Is it possible?

Same thing happened to me. I started with a 7 inch penis with a scrotal graft and somehow ended up barely able to reach the first dot. I wish I could strangle that son of a bitch. I want to watch the light go out of his eyes.

Nothing. I&#39;m just going to live with it. I&#39;ll end myself before I go back to the hospital. I already had to go back in for an emergency revision a week after I left the hospital the first time because the initial operation caused necrosis and half my outer vagina rotted off. I also lost 3% of the skin graft in my canal.
</p>
<p>
I am extremely hospital-traumatized and I&#39;m not going back. Fuck that. I don&#39;t have any inner labia and my depth is fucked, but I&#39;m not going under the knife again. Nope.

Get the peritoneal pull through method, it can build upon/repair a penile inversion surgery. But I read that colon one had greatest depth.

It is possible to do revisions for depth, you can either add skin graft from other areas for example thighs or belly skin graft, there is also options like colon srs revision or ppt revision, l do highly recommend Thailand for the revision, you can search about pai clinic or Dr theerapong ,l feel that they are good options.

Some but not all! I wouldn‚Äôt say my husband is one. I begged him to answer the question truthfully and he did.
</p>
<p>
My vaginal depth has nothing to do with the facts that my husband is white and cis.

Be patient with and graceful toward yourself!
</p>
<p>
Every couple, every
<em>
good
</em>
couple, finds what works sexually for each partner as an
<em>
exploration
</em>
.   First time is never going to be the best.  Practice makes perfect.  I had no idea what would comprise great sex with my t4t partner other than assumptions pre-transition, and all of them were wrong.
</p>
<p>
Hang in there!
<em>
Communite
</em>
with your new spouse!
