I had full depth penile inversion vaginoplasty with Dr. Jonathan Witten at First Urology in Louisville, KY. So far I&#39;m ecstatic with the results. My healing process has been relatively uncomplicated, sensation is great, and I dilate to the last dot on the Soul Source #4 (orange) dilator. Please let me know if you have any questions. I&#39;m happy to talk about my experience and results for anyone else considering Dr. Witten.

<p>
I&#39;ve only had penetrative sex with a partner a couple of times but it was absolutely wonderful. To my complete surprise, I was able to produce enough self lubrication that we didn&#39;t need to use any extra. I understood that vaginas created using the penile inversion method don&#39;t self lubricate but getting turned on by my partner was enough for me to produce some myself. Presumably this came from the urethra and not from the vagina itself but still, it was enough to allow penetration without anything else.
</p>
<p>
I asked my partner for a 100% honest assessment of how it felt and they assured me that my vagina was indistinguishable from a cis one.
</p>
<p>
Sensitivity in the vaginal canal isn&#39;t much. It mostly feels like a sense of pressure but there&#39;s enough friction against my labia and clitoris that sex is pleasurable. I&#39;ve had many orgasms since having surgery but they&#39;ve all come from manual stimulation of my clitoris.  Being filled with something adds to my enjoyment though so sometimes I will use a dildo as well. I never had much sensation from my prostate before surgery and I don&#39;t seem to have much after. I wish there was more but it&#39;s not unexpected. Likewise, I assume someone who has more sensation would retain it.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m very happy. Orgasms take longer to achieve now but when I do, they are earth shatteringly good. The experience of being filled is so incredible and the closeness I feel with my partner is unmatched by anything else.

Welp, this looks pretty damn good! Glad to know the person neutering me in 4-ish days is a good enough surgeon to pull off PIV, definitely reaffirms that he&#39;s worth the extra hour drive for my orchi (even tho I&#39;d have gone there anyway since his wait for an orchi is extremely short, got in 3 weeks post-consult...)

I don‚Äôt feel much of anything except pressure in my canal as well- I also need to use a vibrator on my clitoris to have an orgasm- I am afab - watch out for discharge - most people who are experiencing their vaginas for the first time get surprised by this- I personally use pantry liners but all women are different. Congratualtions btw -I wish you a healthy and happy life -

Hair removal is definitely the biggest headache in regards to surgery prep. The electrologist that I went to has a lot of experience so I trusted her judgement on the progress that I was making. I got scared about two months out from my surgery date though so I scheduled an appointment for Dr. Witten to take a look at it. He said that it looked perfect so I felt confident with moving forward.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t noticed any remaining hairs inside my vaginal canal. I&#39;ve spent some time exploring to see if I could detect anything but so far I&#39;m happy to say that everything looks good. If you&#39;re concerned then you could try to schedule an appointment with him to check your progress.
</p>
<p>
My pain level was manageable during the first few weeks following recovery. I was able to wean myself off of the oxycodone during week 3. The hardest part of recovery was the mandatory five days of bed rest while I was recovering in the hospital. Dr. Witten doesn&#39;t want you to get out of bed until the packing and catheter come out. That was really difficult for me because I had a lot of trouble passing gas which caused some extreme pain. It wasn&#39;t until the night before the packing came out that I figured out a way to do it. It involved laying on one side for about 30 minutes then switching. Going back and forth allowed me to finally pass the gas that had built up inside of me and I instantly felt much better.
</p>
<p>
It took a couple of months before I was able to sit comfortably without a donut pillow. I was able to sit using the donut pillow pretty much right away.
</p>
<p>
Stopping hormones didn&#39;t really affect me much but I think that everyone is probably different in that regard. I&#39;ve heard of some people having a really difficult time with it. Dr. Witten is a very conservative surgeon when it comes to the techniques and processes that he uses. It can be frustrating at times but I really think it minimizes the chances of having any complications which is worth it in the long run.
</p>
<p>
In regards to general advice on getting ready for surgery, I&#39;d say just make sure that you have adequate care lined up. It will make it much easier if you have someone to prepare your meals, bring you water, and get you to your follow up appointments. Also, while Dr. Witten is a fantastic surgeon, the office staff at First Urology frequently make mistakes in regards to scheduling and follow up. They gave me the wrong date/time for my first surgical follow up and I had to rush in unexpectedly so I could start dilating. Make sure to sign up for an account on their web portal and double check any appointment dates there.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I&#39;ll say that the most important items that I took to the hospital were my neck pillow and a stuffed animal. I was able to use those two items to support my neck and body in a variety of positions while I was on bed rest. They were invaluable to me during the first week. Also, a good wedge pillow was very helpful for sitting up in bed after I got home and a folding cane was useful for a lot of things including reaching distant items while laying in bed.
</p>
<p>
Good luck to you and please feel free to reach out to me directly if you have any other questions.

Yes, I went to Christina as well. She knows what she&#39;s doing. You&#39;re in good hands.
</p>
<p>
I was on strict bed rest. I went into the OR on a Saturday and was in bed until the packing came out the following Thursday. I couldn&#39;t eat much of anything because the gas pain was so bad. Between that and the bowel prep before surgery, I didn&#39;t really need to go until that Thursday. If I had then I would have had to go in a bed pan.

I just had to meet my co pays and deductibles through insurance. I figure every plan is going to be different to some degree though. If you decide to schedule surgery then Dr. Witten&#39;s scheduler will work with your insurance to get you pre-approved. You&#39;ll probably just need to contract your provider to get an idea of what your out of pocket expenses would be.

I have a consultation with Dr. Witten in April (he&#39;s the only surgeon covered by my insurance,) and I&#39;ve been very nervous due to the lack of results online. Thanks so much for posting!! This has been very reassuring, and I&#39;m so glad to see you&#39;re thrilled with your results :)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m wondering, however, about the electrolysis process. I&#39;m wondering mostly about the price, and how long it took to get the results needed to go ahead with surgery? I&#39;m also wondering, assuming you&#39;re local, where you might recommend someone go for electrolysis? I&#39;ve been having trouble finding anyone who will perform electrolysis in the areas needed.

Electrolysis was definitely the most grueling part of getting ready for surgery. Dr. Witten&#39;s office is supposed to be offering electrolysis for surgery prep. Unless something has changed, that would be the first place that I would check. They&#39;ll be set up for medical billing and will be able to get the treatments authorized by your insurance provider. Otherwise, the only two electrologists in the area that are trained to do prep for this surgery are Louisville Electrolysis (
<a href="https://www.louisvilleelectrolysis.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.louisvilleelectrolysis.com/
</a>
) and Always Electrolysis (
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Alwayselectrolysis/" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/Alwayselectrolysis/
</a>
).
</p>
<p>
Everyone is different and the amount of electrolysis that you will need can vary considerably. Personally, I required about 15 total hours over the course of a year and I was definitely on the lower end of the range. From my research, the average is around 25 total hours over 1-2 years but some people can require more. My girlfriend required about 60 total hours but she was also going to a different electrologist. The skill and experience of the electrologist go a long way to minimizing the amount of time you need so I&#39;d consider that very carefully.
</p>
<p>
I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.

Did he talk to you about aesthetics? I am going to see him for a consult soon.

We discussed it but the conversation mostly revolved around how there is so much variety in the appearance of vulvas. He didn&#39;t ask me what kind of appearance or attributes that I was looking for but it honestly wasn&#39;t super important to me. I was more concerned with function and sensation. He did mention that he will do a second stage surgery if the aesthetics of the first surgery aren&#39;t ideal.

Thank you so much! I&#39;m excited for my consult with him but I haven&#39;t done any hair removal there yet so I know it&#39;s going to be a while. üò•
