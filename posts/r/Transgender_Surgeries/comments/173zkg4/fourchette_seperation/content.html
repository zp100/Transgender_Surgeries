Out of curiosity, the reason there&#39;s some &#34;bumps&#34; on the lower labia is because of the dehiscence?Did the surgeon say this will flat out eventually or might need to be adjusted in the future? Thankfully overall looks quite good so its good to know even that with some dehiscence the result remains great
</p>
<p>
And is there some bleeding even at 6 weeks or is that due to the separation?
</p>
<p>
Was it painful? Like if you are able to do your daily activities and job how much pain did you notice?
