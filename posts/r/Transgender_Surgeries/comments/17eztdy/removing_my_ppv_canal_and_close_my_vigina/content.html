My understanding of what you are saying: no it&#39;s not about the sensation, when I do anal and my partner penetrates me it feel different and alot more difficult for them to enter, previously it was alot easier.
</p>
<p>
From my understanding you would need the canal fully removed so that the g spot is now next to the anal canal and then it might be fine. This is quite a complex anatomy change so it is best to speak to your doctor.

If you decide to let the vagina close up there could be complications yes. You should speak with your doctor.

Could the creation of the canal have caused scar tissue or adhesions to form? ..therefore the different feeling for anal. By removing the canal, would they not be cutting into the scar tissue &amp; in fact encouraging more scar tissue to form? perhaps even worsening the current condition? Over time, scars can &#34;mellow&#34;, perhaps give the current situation more time for this to happen before planning more surgery

The vaginal canal is built under the prostate and the prostate acts as a &#34;g spot&#34; of sorts. If I had to guess, this is contributing as there is no longer prostate stimulation from anal. Also depending on how long post op, tightness of all muscles down there is normal as your body adjusts to the new form of penetration. There should not be any scar tissue that is affected by anal

I don’t think it’ll ever go back to feeling the way it did before surgery because we no longer have the penile muscle there to support the anal sex and make it feel… as good as it use too. If your experiencing what I’ve experienced anal sex now feels looser? Like I have less support back there, not as much grip. And also deep inside at some point like 6-7” deep I feel discomfort, but I notice that I don’t feel it passed 7”. Hmmmm.

:/ 7 years post op. It deff feels better than at year 1, but it doesn’t feel the same, and although I kind of miss being an anal queen.. I know it’s still “great”, just not as great for me..

I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you...Kamol is digging his grave.
</p>
<p>
I have the same fear of the kitty closing and the risk of future internal infections.
</p>
<p>
Yes, better to do a vaginectomy and prevent that, and no, it won&#39;t have complications.
</p>
<p>
For your concerns about anal, I had a &#39;&#39;ball&#39;&#39; in my rectal canal in the upper part (where it joins the lower wall of the vagina), suposedly it was an internal, huge blood cloth in the shape of a golf ball.
</p>
<p>
I was having SO many issues with the recovery, candidiasis, the pain, ultra painful dilations, IBS, sudden numbing of the vulva, vaginal hair regrowth, and many more....that this issue in the rectum was left aside as secondary, as it didn&#39;t hurted. But it caused me a panic attack in Day 6 because I noticed it appeared suddenly and freaked out and the surgeon &amp; assistant didn&#39;t helped me, all contrary...
</p>
<p>
Like more than a year after SRS, I noticed it was lesser, and felt more natural (originally felt hard, tender and weird).
</p>
<p>
Now 2+ years after it&#39;s normal and, if I wanted, I can have anal sex no problem, but hell....it was a huge worrying in the moment 😓
<br>
So if you remove your vagina, maybe you&#39;ll have some numbness in the area due to repeated interventions, cut nerves, etc.
