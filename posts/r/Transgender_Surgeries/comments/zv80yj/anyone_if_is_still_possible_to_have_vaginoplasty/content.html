Just before the pandemic started, I unfortunately got into an accident where permanently damaged my penis leading to a condition called Peyronie&#39;s. Does anyone know if there is any alternative solutions for this.

Peyronie&#39;s affects part of the erectile tissue of the penis and/or skin. I&#39;m not a surgeon but my understanding is that during a vaginoplasty most of the erectile tissue goes in the bin anyway. I don&#39;t think it would make any difference. Even if it does, there are vaginoplasty options that use virtually no penis tissue beyond the glans, so you should be fine.

Oh wow that&#39;s a relief. I assumed the inner penile tissue was used during vaginoplasty.. thanks a lot for the info.

I developed Peyronie’s years back.  I am one of the lucky few for whom pharmaceutical treatment worked but I still have a little scar tissue.  When I discussed transition with my urologist about a month ago, he seemed to be of the view that my case of Peyronie’s would become completely moot if I had penile inversion vaginoplasty since the affected tissue would be removed in the process.  I guess it depends where your damage is.  I would talk to a urologist who has a clue about trans health.

You might consider one of the alternates to penial inversion such as peritoneal pull through (PPT) or Colovaginoplasty.

Like others have said, most surgeons remove the erectile tissue in it&#39;s entirety so it would be a non-issue. Just be sure this is something you ask during consultations, since some surgeons do not remove all of it.
