You look like a cis woman to me so when it comes to passability your FFS was successful. Maybe just get a revision for the scar or laser to make it less noticeable if it really bothers you.

I&#39;m starting the process of consulting for a revision for FFS.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m honestly kind of at a loss for what can even be done for me as I felt that my last surgery didn&#39;t end up doing much positive for me.
</p>
<p>
Any recommendations for how to salvage my face? Or if its even possible?
</p>
<p>
For reference I had the following done in 2020 with Dr. Mardirossian:
<br>
Forehead contouring
<br>
Brow list
<br>
Scalp advancement (which left a very noticeable scar)
<br>
Rhinoplasty
<br>
Cheek implants
<br>
Lip lift
<br>
Mandible contouring
<br>
Sliding genioplasty
<br>
Trachael shave

You look amazing already though. If anything, maybe just get hair transplants to cover up the hairline incision scars.

&#39;Before&#39; pictures would be helpful to see what has changed. From what I can see from these pictures alone, It seems like he removed the jaw angle a little too much or maybe burrowed it down, which is causing a lack of definition and some laxity of the soft tissue. Can&#39;t know for certain without seeing your before pictures. The nose is alright; it&#39;s a typical mardirossian nose, although it seems like there&#39;s a bit of pinching in the mid-vault area.

I&#39;ll share some pre-FFS photos when I&#39;m home but I do agree that he was a bit too aggressive on the jaw and I have a lot of laxity there as a result. I have the same issue with my forehead where I now have a lot of loose tissue above my eyes that I&#39;m looking to resolve likely with a revision brow lift or a blepharoplasty. Whatever the surgeon finds most applicable.

The problem with Mardi&#39;s jaw procedures is that he almost always removes the jaw angle. Lots of FFS surgeons do something similar. Everyone needs a jaw angle, and you can always reduce the thickness without removing the mandibular angle etc. the pinching in the middle part of your nose is also typical of his rhinos. Several of his patients have this, it takes about 6 to 12 months to develop or become apparent.

I would do custom chin implant to make it more prominent and give the face some structure.
</p>
<p>
I feel like the chin is to small, The same happened to me too by the way, too much was done and it didn&#39;t femininize me.
</p>
<p>
tho you look very feminine to me. Maybe get a smas/deep plane lift as well

I went to the same surgeon as you in late 2020 and had a lot of the same issues. I got almost a full FFS revision with Facialteam last year that included custom implants for the Jaw and am in a much better place now. Feel free to message if you have any questions or would like photos. Sorry this happened, but it can and will get better.
