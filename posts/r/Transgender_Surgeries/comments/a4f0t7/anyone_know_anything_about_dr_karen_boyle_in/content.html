Anyone know anything about Dr. Karen Boyle in Baltimore? (I’m specifically concerned with vaginoplasty, but if there’s anyone with experience with phallo-/metoidioplasty with her, that would help me understand her skill level)

My insurance company is trying to deny my pre-auth for Dr. Ting by pointing out that Dr. Boyle is in-network for me. I’ve scoured the Internet, and aside from Dr. Boyle’s own website, I’m finding very little information about her capability to perform vaginoplasty (or any transgender bottom surgery, for that matter). Does anyone have any experience with Dr. Boyle? Any information about her training, how many trans surgeries she’s performed, etc?
</p>
<p>
I don’t see her listed on the Trans surgery wiki, nor on other lists/review sites.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

Update: I spoke with Dr. Boyle’s office and while they perform vaginoplasties, they only perform them on cisgender women (vaginal rejuvenation), and not transgender women (GCS). She is a urologist, and
<em>
has
</em>
operated with Dr. Bluebond-Langner on MtF vaginoplasties, but only performing the orchiectomy (which her staff graciously offered as a service to me). She did this when Dr. Bluebond-Langner was based in Maryland, but hasn’t participated in a MtF vaginoplasty since.
</p>
<p>
So, I’m back talking with my insurance asking them to explain this referral and to move my case along. Funny quote of the day was when one of the customer care people at my insurance told me (in response to the information that Dr. Boyle doesn’t perform MtF vaginoplasty) “that can’t be; the authorizations department
<em>
thoroughly
</em>
researches these things before they give their responses!”   Umm, well.... ¯_(ツ)_/¯

Go to the transhealthcaremd group on fb. And ask in there. I know a lot of other folks have asked about her in there. So you should find some info there.
