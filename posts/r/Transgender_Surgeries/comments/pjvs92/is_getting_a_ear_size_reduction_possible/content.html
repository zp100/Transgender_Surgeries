I thought that when I&#39;d get FFS, my ears would be even more prominent than before since they&#39;re REALLY big, and other features of mine low-key kinda helped drawing attention from them. But If those features get &#34;fixed&#34;, then my ears will stand out like crazy. This is unreasonably worrying me to no end at the moment and I thought maybe there&#39;s a surgery for it? I think 10 years ago I heard that surgeons don&#39;t do that because there are so many small bones in there, but that was 10 years ago and a lot has changed in the medical field. Is it still not possible or done at all?
</p>
<p>
If surgeons do it, is there one who&#39;s famous for it? Appreciate any replies!

I can tell you I myself see the difference on photos before and after. Scars on lobes treated with Dermatix and rosehip oil. Recovery is the easiest among the other surgeries of FFS.

Wow! Alright, this sounds exactly like what I&#39;d be looking for, but isn&#39;t the US crazy expensive with surgeries? Not sure If I could afford that. Maybe I&#39;d find a surgeon who does this in korea? Hmm.. gotta do more research def

I had this done in office under local. Cost me $750.00 and took less than an hour. It made a big difference. It was the one procedure Gallagher didn&#39;t screw up --not that I recommend going anywhere near her for surgery. I think I&#39;ve made that clear at this point.

I expect many surgeons could do it. Look in the wiki for ffs in Korea as it‚Äôs risky.

Because of the surgeon swapping and stuff, right? Heard a lot of shady stuff from clinics like ID hospital. Anyways, thanks I&#39;ll look into it.

And false advertising, etc. there‚Äôs good surgeons there, but it‚Äôs really hard to find out who‚Äôs good and who is not.

You could get ear pinning, which can pull them flatter against the skull reducing their appearance. I asked for it as part of my FFS but unfortunately my insurance considered it cosmetic. I couldn&#39;t scrape together the $4500 to add it on to my FFS so I skipped it.
</p>
<p>
Now after my FFS, BA and a couple years on hormones and GCS next month, I feel a lot different about my large, asymmetrical, rather hairy ears. I actually love them now and as my last gender affirming surgery, I&#39;m hoping to save up to get pointy ear (elf ear) surgery and maybe some cool piercings.
</p>
<p>
I pass as a woman (but not cis) and that&#39;s caused me to relax about needing every part of my body to be as close to an &#34;ideal&#34; (cultural aesthetic fantasy) cis binary woman&#39;s, and I feel able to express myself in more creative ways.
</p>
<p>
I know that&#39;s not an answer to your question, and this is just my two cents. Your feelings of dysphoria are valid. I suggest looking into ear pinning and also consider that AFAB people have all sorts of ears too.

hi, ear pinning is not something I need to be honest. And yes, AFAB people have all sorts of ears, but I have never seen a woman in my life who has as big a ears like I have.

Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s your sort of thing but you could always get your ears pointed like an elf üòÅ
