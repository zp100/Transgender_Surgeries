Mainly I just want to know what the required area for hair removal is and how long between initial consult and the actual surgery I will have. Thanks Edit: should have been more clear. Specifically relating to vaginoplasty

They have about the same requirements as everyone, they will send you the diagram if you email them. They currently don&#39;t have any insurance contracts so I was almost left with a $16,000 bill due to his staff being incompetent and generally horrible at communication. Consult to surgery was 3 months if I had been able to actually get it but I think they were just trying to get someone to take the spot because of their contract problems. The doctor himself is very nice and I&#39;ve heard good things about his work. Just get ready for a nightmare dealing with his staff.

I had vaginoplasty with him back in March before he left Moscow ID, thing went really well but it very much seems that his current staff is still trying to figure out how to get the job done efficiently and communicate with their patients. Honestly his staff is making me think twice about recommending him because they can&#39;t seem to get very simple things done.

The whole thing pissed me off so much I decided to switch to Wittenberg in San Francisco and get the PPT method. Stiller&#39;s staff lied to me constantly and couldn&#39;t even do simple FMLA paperwork for my work properly. Also the only person they have that schedules people AND can answer medical questions is PART TIME ON AN INCONSISTENT SCHEDULE BECAUSE SHE&#39;S IN SCHOOL. If you call and ask for people the front desk asks who you are and then asks them if they want to talk to you. Often times they are randomly &#34; out of the office&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Also they violated HIPAA as well as misgendering and dead naming me several times when I was there for a GRS consult. They don&#39;t even have the most basic level of sensitivity training towards transgender people. I never even gave them my deadname as my name has been legally changed.
</p>
<p>
They are a nightmare to work with and clearly don&#39;t care about their patients at all.

They didn&#39;t have me remove any hair for my SRS. Only took a few months from the initial consult to my surgery.
