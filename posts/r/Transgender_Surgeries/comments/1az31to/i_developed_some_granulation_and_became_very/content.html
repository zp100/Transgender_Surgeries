Context: I got my srs with skin graft in Thailand 11 weeks ago with dr Chettawut. A week before I left I got my post op consultation, I did had some minor granulation which was treated by the doctor and that was that. They told me that if anything else happened I could go with a doctor in my country to get it checked out.
</p>
<p>
So… last weekend I noticed that there was some granulation in my labia near the flap, it wasn’t painful, but it did look angry. Anyway I told my mom and she said that she would book my an appointment with her gynecologist, but since it was Saturday he wasn’t gonna be able to see me until Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
During the weekend I googled “skin growths in labia…” 🥴 that was a mistake lol, so by then in my mind I was thinking it could be either granulation  or cancer hahahahahahaa
</p>
<p>
Anyway I went to the doctor on Tuesday… He asked me to change into a gown and to hop on the examination chair. He began with the examination and he said that indeed it was granulation, which then he explained to me how granulation happens, which I thought was a little odd since I already knew, but I was like ok… he then told me that he needed to check my canal to see if there was any granulation in there, so he placed the speculum and he was like… ok so there’s no granulation here… but… I’m sorry I’m having some trouble to see the uterus… I WAS GAGGED 🤣! It honestly took me a couple seconds to respond to the doctor that I didn’t had one hahahahahahahaa the doctor looked at me with confusion in his eyes 🤣!!! And I was like I’m sorry since my mom made the appointment I thought she had explained that I’m a trans woman, and he was like, oh, she did not, then he looks back at my vagina and went, they did an amazing job! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha he then asked me stuff about the procedure, but it felt ok…
</p>
<p>
Anyway back to the issue… I had granulation and the doctor told me that since the granulation was on the outside and it wasn’t very big he could treat it with silver nitrate, which he did, it didn’t really hurt, it did sting for a little while and my skin (where the silver nitrate was applied) changed color to a whitish gray… he asked to go back Wednesday and Friday for another application with one of his nurses.
</p>
<p>
It’s been a week and the granulation has disappeared completely, as if it never happened 🥴 so moral of the story, if you see something appear in your 🐈 that wasn’t there… go get it checked out 🙃
