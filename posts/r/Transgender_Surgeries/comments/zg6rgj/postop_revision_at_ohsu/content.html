<p>
So I recently had a revision with Dr. Peters and Dr. Dy to fix the surgery I got from Dr. Rumer in 2019. I&#39;m satisfied (happy with my results) and they did all they could for me given the circumstances (the way Rumer left things). I had a full revision PPT and vulvoplasty. As you can see the comparison is night and day. I have labia, my urethra now points down, and it looks analogous to cis women. its not &#34;born with&#34; perfect but I&#39;m happy and can move on and put these last few years behind me.
</p>
<p>
The surgery went quick 3 vs their scheduled 6 hrs. I spent 4 days in the hospital and was able to move around after 36 hrs. everyone was kind and informative about my recovery.  I did all the things i needed to do before leaving, and while initially painful I was able to go without opioids. My post op visit was leagues above what I had previously gone through.
</p>
<p>
All that said,
<a href="https://www.insider.com/surgeon-counts-human-clitoris-nerve-fibers-for-first-time-ever-2022-11">Dr. Peters</a>
did inform me that my previous surgery was like nothing he had ever seen or heard about. There was a lot of erogenous tissue left, and the reason why there was such a long vertical scare was because they could not find my the tissue that was meant to be my clitoris. Instead of aimlessly hunting for one, they did what he could to fashion one of what was available. While I do have sensation (and I am grateful for that) and my mind can make up for the rest...I will be forever without. I personally see this as a byproduct of letting Rumer do my first surgery and disregard of patient out comes (not just mine but other stories).
</p>
<p>
To anyone making the decision for SRS, it is ultimately your decision who you go to but  the results speak for themselves. I only hope that this post and the others I have made with this account can help in the decision making process. It is better to wait a few years than deal with complications, loss of tissue, confusion/loss of intimate partners, and SI as a result of my first surgery.
</p>
<p>
It should be evident to all that I by no means endorse Dr. Kathy Rumer or anyone that she has

I have two questions: What was your original depth? And what is your current depth after PPT?

~6 inches (4 dots green) from first surgery. I dilated every day for 3 years but i still lost depth to ~5 in (3 dots green) and bleed with any aggressive intercourse. also the excess erectile tissue will rip if overly engorged.
</p>
<p>
PPT I&#39;m getting a full 7 inches (5 dots orange).

If you&#39;re using the common Soul Source GRS dilators your numbers seem off. First dot is 3½ inches and each dot is half an inch. The last dot is 5½&#34;.

Was this out of pocket or through insurance?

Lovely, and thank you. May I ask which one you used? I am also seeking a revision, and cannot afford out of pocket.

I really appreciate the information. There is a good chance I can get on that. It has been hard finding coverage for some revisions/ continued care. This helps.
