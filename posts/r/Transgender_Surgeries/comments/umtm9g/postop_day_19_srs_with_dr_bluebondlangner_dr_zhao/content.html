That labia definition looks amazing!  Yet another example of the great work that BBL/Zhao do. üíúüíú

Are they having you apply anything to the scars to help with healing?

For me, when I went to physical therapy they taught me a few &#34;scar tissue massages&#34; to help with that and also to help with reducing swelling

Ugh that‚Äôs the only department I didn‚Äôt have a good experience with. The person was so checked out and didn‚Äôt teach me anything or even mention scar therapy!? The surgical team just said not to go anymore. I have already found better information on pelvic floor therapy on my own in about 5 minutes.

Im sorry to hear that! Did you use the nyu PT? Do you happen to remember who you saw? Tbh my therapist was also a weak point in the care team but I still found it helpful (eventho I had to do a lil more question asking) im glad you found good info tho, I found it really hard to find good info on dilation outside of reddit

Looks like it will be very aesthetic once it heals. So you had another appointment 19 days after surgery? I thought you said ur only required to be around for 2 weeks after surgery.

Ok thanks for clarification. Do you recommend an affordable place to stay for the 2 weeks? I have 2 years to plan it lmao due to waitlist but seemingly nowhere is very affordable.

Here is what I did, take from it what you will. Including how much i spent for your own planning purposes.
</p>
<p>
I booked at the Hilton garden inn -midtown for 8 nights for before surgery and for my partner to stay while I was in hospital. It was only 4 blocks away so she could easily walk to visit me every day.  That was about $2100.
</p>
<p>
For the following two weeks we stayed at Extended Stay America in Secaucus NJ for 16 nights. It&#39;s only 4 miles away (about 20-30 minute uber, roughly $35-50 each way FYI) and a very safe area with lots of stuff easily in walking distance. (Very nice movie theater about 300m away, with recliners!) That was about $2400. I chose an extended stay over and Airbnb or Vrbo because of having amenities like linen service, housekeeping etc.
</p>
<p>
I recommend paying in advance for as much as you can well ahead of time so you can just save cash for thing like dining (we went shopping locally and tried to cook most of our meals once in the extended stay.) as well as plan for Uber/lyft costs and any other fun thing you&#39;d like to treat yourself too. You&#39;ll definitely still be able to go out to some fun things, we did mani/pedis &amp; spa treatments one day, and I even got some tattoo work done another. While not totally incapacitated, you&#39;ll still want to plan any outings around the dilation schedule and keep those plans fluid. Some days are darker than others by far and you&#39;ll just want to be a puddle in bed. Bring entertainment.  Feel free to PM me if you have questions or need advice leading up. &lt;3 -Liana

Oh that&#39;s awesome! I didn&#39;t get my date until about a month after my consult as i needed to get one more referral letter at the time. The time will fly by and you&#39;ll be having you won post-op bliss soon enough! Feel free to PM me if you have questions or need advice leading up. &lt;3 -Liana

Well since I gamed my insurance carefully, my portion came out to 2900, my insurance covered the rest. My biggest expenses are from travel and the lodging. You‚Äôre required to stay within an hours drive for 2 weeks after being discharged from the hospital.

my understanding is if you&#39;re paying cash out of pocket it&#39;s around 30-40k. That said, this team, IMO, is literally the best in the world currently.

How is recovery going in terms of independence and mobility? How much can you move around, take care of yourself, do household chores, etc. My spouse is looking to get bottom surgery soon, but unfortunately looks like her date may line up around same time as my due date, so I&#39;m wondering how much she may be able to help or not help with herself or the baby as she heals, since I&#39;d have no other help person to help with her healing or the baby, and wondering how long to expect until she can go back to work (manager at a grocery store)

I was able to be very active very quickly. The only thing I actually had trouble with was sitting in any kind of hard chair for any length of time for about 3ish weeks. I was easily walking 1-2 miles around the extended stay hotel and cooking some of our meals too.

looks great, btw were you circumcised? I plan on going with her team but I have only seen results of uncircumcised patients and they all look the same - which are all amazing. It would be nice to see a picture of what my clit might look like  aswell

I was circumcised yes. Also I‚Äôll note; my left labia minora looks different like that because I had a scar on my scrotum from a long ago partial orchiectomy I had due to an infection unrelated to transition. She told me in my consultation that I‚Äôd likely still have a scar on my new labia. I kinda like it though ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

thankyou for sharing, I have some scars too, I honestly had not toniced anthing out of the ordinary and when I look at Dr. Langners results only see beautiful and intricate vaginas all around. the labias and the nice slope in the transition from the external forchette to them looks soo amazing and those nice vurved lines outside the lips too! I am in love with the results from  Dr.BBL and  Dr. Zhao . Congratulations...

<p>
I am circumcised two with about half an inch of inner skin with a very defined transition scar from inner to outer skin that worries me because of my skin conflection whereas you seem to have nice fair skin

Pretty rough for the first 6 weeks, 4x a day for at least 15 minutes. I won‚Äôt lie, dilation is hard. Like really hard. Having my partner with me as my caretaker was essential for my success.

I understand. Mine is 4x a sat, 30 minutes each, but for the first month. The whole thing from dilation to air dying takes almost 2 hours. I&#39;m on day 17 now.

I went to GRS Montreal with Dr. Belanger. I faced many problems from the first day of surgery, from a thrombosed hemorrhoid to abscess and infection. Still at the same time with dilations, I struggle with hemorrhoid and also have receive daily IV antibiotics. From head to toe I am sore. I wish it was just dilations

Not OP but went to the same place. I can say that NYU is the best hospital I&#39;ve ever been in or worked with (I do EMS) the rooms are really nice (single rooms)  they&#39;re very up to date, Ipads in every room, the staff is really friendly and the pain management team had spoken to me before even going into surgery and were in the recovery room shortly after I woke up from surgery

Still looking so good!! üòä

You seem super kind and you said AMA, so here it goes‚Ä¶

How different does it feel just moving around? Like daily life type stuff.
</p>

What is it like having your genitals farther back towards your bottom down there? Sometimes when I am pretty dysphoric, I will put my fingertips where I think I would have a vagina if I had one. Kind of helps me visualize things and get out of that headspace.
</p>

I love how your doctor really defined your labia, and such. Is this something special that you requested, or is this just how he does the procedure? That note, did you want to have a lot of folds down there, or were you surprised with how your anatomy is shaping up to look?
</p>
</li>

<p>
The obligatory bathroom question‚Ä¶ How long did it take for you to get used to peeing with your new parts? Or are you still getting used to it? I‚Äôm looking forward to normal things like this, but I imagine the newness wears off at some point. Lol
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I have a ton more questions, but I think this will do for now! Thanks for sharing with us!

This is a dumb question, but how was your mobility about 2-3weeks out from surgery. I&#39;m kinda a foodie and would love to at least get a chance to eat at a few places if I&#39;m going to be in New York City for over a month.
