I&#39;m 22 and I knew I was trans at 18 but I was a crossdresser from 13 yo. At that time I didn&#39;t know trans was a thing.

Well... He said this:
</p>
<p>
Goood afternoon
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve tried to get in touch by phone, but it goes to voice mail...
</p>
<p>
Lorena&#39;s evolution within the complication she has had, is being correct, it will be very slow, the black scab will soften and end up falling off, while the scab is there it will smell bad.
</p>
<p>
In my experience, although now everything looks swollen and with the scab, the result when everything heals is very good.
</p>
<p>
Tolterodine is not essential, but it helps to better tolerate the tube.
</p>
<p>
All the best

This seems inadequate, but I&#39;m not a medical person, so what do I know? Couple questions.
</p>
<p>
Are you taking your temperature to see if you have a fever? That could be a sign of worsening infection.
</p>
<p>
Are you able to eat? If you can&#39;t tolerate food, that could also be a sign of infection.
</p>
<p>
Have they given you any guidance about how the area should look? You need to know in case the necrosis spreads or worsens in some other way. This is not to imply that you&#39;re not getting better, but that you simply need to be aware of what to look for should things go south.
</p>
<p>
Have they suggested antibiotics in the event that you develop some kind of infection?
</p>
<p>
Do you have any support for a local doctor in case you need one?
</p>
<p>
What kind of pain meds do you have?
</p>

You need to keep in mind she was already back in the hospital after the initial scare.  But the evaluation from her current point sounds accurate.  As terrible as it looks it has been looking a little better each day (per her pictures)
</p>
<p>
All your other questions are totally valid though.  But my understanding is she had answers to the key parts.

So sorry you&#39;re in pain but...last question.
</p>
<p>
Have you considered consulting a local wound-care specialist? They could probably give you a more accurate evaluation of what&#39;s going on because that&#39;s their specialty.

Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
But luckily my surgeon is not one of those. I keep contact with him via email and he always answers my doubts and everything. The day 19th September I have a revision with him. And this Monday I have another revision with an external surgeon here in my city.

I can&#39;t even imagine the pain and frustration. I am considering SRS and have seen most recovery times advertised as a week. Is this a big surprise to be happening?
</p>
<p>
Also, do you feel like you have all the support you need? I&#39;m happy to chat if it helps ‚ù§Ô∏èüåà

Thank you for sharing your journey, this is hugely helpful and you are my hero!

A week? No. Nobody&#39;s saying that. Sex after 3 months maybe, fully settled in up to a year, possibly longer if there are any issues.

I know it takes months to fully heal, but every other source has said discharge happens in 5-7days! Good to know what to prepare for ‚ù§Ô∏èüåà

Discharge is very different to being fully healed up.
</p>
<p>
Discharge means they&#39;re happy you won&#39;t die or have horrible complications out of their sight, nothing to do with being healed!
</p>
<p>
I had my apendix and illeum junction out 4 years ago and I was out after 5days, but maan, I took a lot longer to feel right after that.
</p>
<p>
Be prepared to feel like you&#39;ve been run over by a bus, and more tired than you&#39;ve even been before. Plus going nil by mouth will have you feeling stupidly dehydrated.

Don&#39;t quote me because I&#39;ve half forgotten it all now, but the junction between your small and large intestine is called the illeum. It&#39;s where the apendix is attached and there&#39;s a valve between the two sections. Happens to be where vitamin B is most readily absorbed. My apendix I gather was unrecognisable and the 6inches either side necrotic, so it all got cut out and rejoined. Lovely long scar down my belly.
</p>
<p>
The wrong foods just go right through me now, so my life long Weetabix habit had to stop, no more brown bread or high fibre foods!
</p>
<p>
Thankfully most veg and fish are agreeable.

Yep, just a bit. There&#39;s a big TMI section I&#39;ve missed out on the after effects of the wrong food - Took me months to realise until I had a weekend away and ate garbage, but it&#39;s given me a first hand insight into the huge after effects of major surgery and a new appreciation for moist wipes!

Totally different than recovery. I was discharged from the hospital the day of surgery. No issues. But I had to stay at a hotel near the surgery (since it was out of town) for 2 weeks for follow up
</p>
<p>
Took about 2 months to be able to return to work

Yeah I made a friend on the hospital who did the surgery one day before me... And she sent me a photo of her vagina and it was so perfect... I&#39;m jealous, not gonna lie. I mean I&#39;m proud and happy for her. But well shits happens and it happened to me again... And again... So I&#39;m trying to be strong...
