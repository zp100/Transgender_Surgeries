I was in Thailand just visiting and I met a Swiss girl that went for srs with Dr Banks. I was allowed to go with her and meet very briefly with Dr Banks. I immediately asked him if he prefered laser or electrolysis, and if he wants us to have the penis and tests done. He told me to avoid electrolysis because it will scar the skin deep and it also often reduces vaginaldepth. He likes laser because it is more effective and doesn&#39;t damage the skin. He told me we can have the tests and penis lasered, but with electrolysis only the perineum area. But he insisted he prefers laser, more effective and modern and without damaging the skin.

I suppose dr Suporn thinks the same since they work together

I remember Suporn used to say it scarred or made the skin less supple. Not sure if his policies have changed.

Hi, from my understanding it is preferable you do get hair removal. I’m having surgery with dr bank in about 6 months and the information I’ve been given a few weeks ago it was there preference to get hair removal in a certain area and laser was ok. I can forward you the information once in back at my pc if you like.

No idea why they would say to avoid electrolysis.  As long as you find a competent provider (same as with laser), there is virtually no risk of any kind of damage that would impact surgery.

From their website:
</p>
<p>
Prior electrolysis of the scrotal area may result in scarring andthickening of the skin which could reduce its elasticity and vaginaldepth. If desired, only the perineal region (perineum) between the anusto the scrotum should be cleared (which can also be cleared after SRS)

He still does a few surgeries, though not many. And Dr. Bank has the exact same technique as him.
