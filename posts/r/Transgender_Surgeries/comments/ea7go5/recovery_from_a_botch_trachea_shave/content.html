Hi all, I saw an ENT today who told me that my voice was damaged from my trachea shave about 6 months ago. He said he never had experience with someone who has had this surgery but he said that the damage was permanent. The vocal chords are intact but mentioned that the surgeon may have taken too much cartilage off and as a result my chords don&#39;t have enough support to produce higher sound.
</p>
<p>
I used to be a singer but I&#39;ve completely lost my upper third of pitch and have very poor voice quality for the high notes I can hit.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone had experience with this? Is there a way to repair the damage or I am going to have a damaged voice for the rest of my life?
</p>

I&#39;d imagine that if the cartilage is too weak, external support like a titanium plate might help. Another user has already mentioned Dr Thomas, I would definitely second trying to get a second opinion from him. He does VFS, and his baseline technique involves remodeling the voice box, so I&#39;d imagine he could have some solutions to your situation.

I just reached out to his office actually! Thanks so much for your input. I saw one patient on there who went to him after she had a similar issue from the tracheal shave

You&#39;re welcome. I&#39;m not exactly unbiased to be fair, he was my surgeon for VFS, and I&#39;m quite happy with my results. :)

Are you able to sing? I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t have the same complications with a trachea shave as I did

I haven&#39;t really tried to sing anything beyond lullabies so far, but I think I should be able to.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re correct, I declined having a trachea shave done with FFS because I was already booked for VFS with him, and his technique gets rid of the Adam&#39;s apple.

I don&#39;t think anyone will be able to tell you whether this will be successful, whether Dr. Thomas or anyone else can repair the damage is gonna be highly person-to-person. That being said, I can&#39;t imagine a better person to fix it, he&#39;s extremely talented with anything voice-related

Thatâ€™s the worst!! Sorry to hear.  I wonder if a second opinion from an ENT who specializes in voice disorders may be able to be helpful.  I know Jim Thomas in Portland OR is one.  And many university medical centers have a voice clinic.  It may be worthwhile to check into seeing someone like this.   I hope things get better!!!

Same happened to me, voice became lower than it had ever been. I had subsequent vocal cord surgery at UCSF that tightened things back up moderately. The road to a healthy, feminine voice is still long and challenging from there, however, I&#39;m still working on it 3 years later. I&#39;ll dig around to find out what the surgery process was called and post it here later if I can.

That&#39;s what I wanted too, and so far I have a severely limited vocal range compared to before. Sorry. I hold out hope but it&#39;s fading.

I&#39;m sorry to hear that. Is it ok to ask if your surgery at UCSF was successful? Did that help or hinder your range?

Oh it helped bring my &#34;average&#34; speaking voice up, and allows me to work to a higher cis-female speaking range. But I don&#39;t feel like my cords are as pliable and I have very limited range. My goal is to cement my speaking voice and then work on training for singing.  My 3 year timeline may not be normal, so don&#39;t despair about that. First of all I&#39;m in my 50&#39;s so everything is harder than it might be for a young person. Second, I&#39;ve had multiple surgeries with intubation which seem to retard progress. And third, lots of stress that manifested in tightening of the jaw and cords. So if you can beat those issues down you may be far more successful than I!

ok! thanks so much for all of the detail. I am lucky in that I can still get a femme perceived speaking voice after doing vocal warm ups for a while. I&#39;m worried that going in for my voice surgery is just going to damage the quality of my voice further so less pliable cords are a concern for me. I really appreciate all of your help

Voice feminisation surgery can get your high pitch range back but youâ€™ll lose your low pitch range (but I doubt thatâ€™s a bad thing if you identify as female)
