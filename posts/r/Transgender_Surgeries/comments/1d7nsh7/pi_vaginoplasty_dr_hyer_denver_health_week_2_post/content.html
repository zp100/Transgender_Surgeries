Link to my

documenting my surgery results.
</p>
<p>
As is fairly obvious, there was some wound separation along the edges of the vagina, as well as some skin sloughing. I messaged the surgeon about both of these; I was told that these were minor complications and would heal over time. As will be documented in future posts, this advice was correct.

Thanks for posting.  Good luck on your recovery.  It isn&#39;t pretty those initial few weeks but will look amazing in the long run.  I&#39;m going to be going with Dr Hyer.  Appreciate the posts.

please wait for OP to post updates from further along in the process before confirming w/ this surgeon. The initial post-surgical results aren’t like anything i’ve seen before.

All vaginoplasty looks rough at two weeks regardless of the surgeon.  It takes until 6 weeks before the worst is over.  Even the best surgeons like Bluebond-Langer or Min Jun results look rough during the initial weeks.  That&#39;s the nature of this surgery.  Dr Hyer has a good reputation.  And yes, there are plenty of good outcomes of her work further along in the healing process.

Dr Hyers Post surgery results seem excessively gruesome compared to other surgeons.
</p>
<p>
His patients get desired results eventually but it seems they are extreme.

Not this rough. Go look around this sub by typing 2 week post op in the search bar on top

I would say to everyone to be very cautious about expectations going into vaginoplasty.  Please do not make assumptions about what ideal healing looks like.  This link presents an example of a person that heals quickly.  Everyone heals differently.  For every person that heals quickly there&#39;s a person that heals slowly.  Setbacks like dehesience and granulation are very common.  More severe complications like fistula and bleeding are also common in vaginoplasty.  Don&#39;t rush to judgement.  Go into this knowing that recovery can be difficult but in the end results will look better.

There is more than one link in there and a lot more from the search. While complications are common, looking like this after two weeks is far more rare than the links I added here.

It&#39;s been unclear to me if Dr. Hyer&#39;s initial results are unusually bruised or fairly typical of all surgeries. From my anecdata, my suspicion has been that people with more bruised results are reluctant to share those results, so there may be a selection bias in favor of pretty results.
</p>
<p>
Part of my goal with sharing these photos is to have people think about whether or not things should look super pretty early on, and also to recognize that bodies are pretty good at healing things. It&#39;s been very disheartening to have people think that bodies can&#39;t heal up and accuse me of stealing someone else&#39;s photos for my healed up results.

I&#39;m not saying it won&#39;t heal up nicely. I think it&#39;s looking bad, but bodies usually heal pretty well. I&#39;m mostly concerned about the severe amount of complications you seem to have and thus, unnecessary physical and emotional pain.

I would say this doctors version seems like it will be on the longer side of recovery as compared to my surgery from Dr Jun. Just for consideration of others, my surgery results from Dr Jun have looked great from the get go. I didn&#39;t have to go through this level of recovery. Nothing against this doctor but to group Dr Jun in seems not quite right.
</p>
<p>
And I&#39;m not trying to stress out OP but I also wouldn&#39;t want misinformation hanging around like that. The levels of &#34;rough&#34; are very very different.
</p>
<p>
I wish OP a great healing journey and hang in there! You&#39;ve got this.

If this was my surgeon I would cancel immediately. This is not standard 2 week healing.

I agree, I was originally going to go to Dr.Hyer but too many gals I talked to had poor outcomes with her so I wound up with a different surgeon. OP&#39;s outcome is not normal, sending good wishes for recovery!!!
