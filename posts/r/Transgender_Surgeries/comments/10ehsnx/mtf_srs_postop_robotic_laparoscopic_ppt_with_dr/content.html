Hey y&#39;all! I&#39;m on Day 4 in the hospital after having the Peritoneal Pull-Through vaginoplasty with Dr. Del Corral. I thought I&#39;d share a little bit about my experience so far in case this is helpful to anybody else. My insurance is Cigna, and Dr. Del was in-network. Cigna initially denied my application, claiming the procedure could be done outpatient without the hospital stay. Dr. Del&#39;s office got in touch with Cigna and fixed the issue within a week of me receiving the letter denying my claim. Shortly after I received the go-ahead from Cigna.
</p>
<p>
So far, the doctors, nurses, and caregivers have all been really kind and helpful. It was interesting being here over MLK Day weekend because there wasn&#39;t necessarily the consistency that I had anticipated among who was taking care of me. That being said, everybody has been very nice and easy to work with and has gone above and beyond with my care.
</p>
<p>
The morning of my surgery moved by super quickly. I think the intake with questions and meeting the surgery team and everything took about an hour, but it felt like no time had passed before they were wheeling me into the operating room. I woke up in the recovery wing and had some very kind nurses taking care of me while I waited for my room in Dr. Del&#39;s wing to be ready. I slept a ton post surgery, basically just waking up when I had visitors and when the doctors/nurses were checking on me. Probably the most unexpected part was the sensation of the catheter which made me feel like I had to pee nonstop. Something pretty consistent with me throughout out my stay has been a pretty low level of pain experienced. It&#39;s never really reached above a 4 and usually hovered around a 2.
</p>
<p>
Days 2 and 3 were generally pretty okay. Again, the pain really wasn’t a problem for me, and I was able to keep myself entertained or sleep most of the time. The worst part was that all of my bowel movements were liquid and I had to go in a bedpan on the bed which was a miserable experience, but the caregivers did a good job of making it feel less weird and helping get me cleaned up after. On Day 3 I was allowed to stand up on my own and sit in a chair for half an hour at a time. I was also allowed to use the toilet by myself which was quite the relief.
</p>
<p>
This morning Dr. Del came in and removed the packing and the catheter and the drains. The sensations were really bizarre because a lot of me is still pretty numbed up but I could feel the movement inside of me. Then the Doctor helped me with dilation. It wasn&#39;t too bad--definitely scary the first time finding the vaginal canal and figuring out the shape of it--but again I&#39;m still pretty numb so there wasn&#39;t much pain. The sensation of it will definitely take some getting used to. We then douched my vaginal canal and then I was able to pee (very weird!) and take a shower!
</p>
<p>
So that&#39;s basically where I&#39;m at so far--should be heading home tomorrow morning sometime. Feeling cautiously optimistic about dilating. Hoping the numbing starts to fade a little over the next few weeks! OH and I should add that I&#39;m already very happy with the aesthetics of my new vulva! She&#39;s definitely a little swollen but overall I feel really good about the aesthetics and my choice of surgeons. Let me know if you have any questions or want me to post results pics or updates or anything!

I&#39;m glad this was helpful! I will add that I was pretty impressed with the turnaround time from the consult to the appointment. I saw him in May and got an approximate range of November-January. Even with the delays from Cigna he still kept to that window!
</p>
<p>
Best of luck to you and please feel free to let me know if I can answer any other questions!

How are visiting hours now? Last year they were like 11am-7pm, crappy! Also, are they letting a caretaker (family member/friend/spouse, ect) stay with you?
</p>
<p>
Edit: isn&#39;t Dr. Del the sweetest man ever?! So happy you&#39;re doing well and like the look! He&#39;s great after with any questions. Result pics if you&#39;re willing would really help! Not many people post for him.

Visiting hours were still a little weird for sure. I think it might be 10am to 9pm which is a little better but still not ideal and nobody can stay with you overnight. It worked out alright for me because I&#39;m not much of a morning person, so I didn&#39;t really want people to visit until the afternoon anyways!
</p>
<p>
Yes! Dr. Del and his whole team have been so wonderful! I appreciate how easy they are to work with and informative, responsive, and caring. I&#39;ll update the original with results pics!

Great results! Congrats! What was your hair removal like? I have my PPT surgery with him in 6 weeks. I have been doing electrolysis for about a year but still have some hair on my scrotum and perineum. Were you 100% clear?

I can help answer this! I did about a year of electrolysis before my PPT with Dr. Del and was a little nervous about it going in. They reassured me that they would remove all of the hair from the graft sample really thoroughly. I am super happy with the outcome and haven’t had any issues with hair growing where it shouldn’t be.
</p>
<p>
Side note: Anybody who is in the Baltimore area should see Stacey Elder at The Epilation Clinic for electrolysis. She’s an absolute gem!

Yeah, I had PI done back in October, and I found my experience to be pretty much the same as yours. I didn&#39;t get a chance to see the doctor much in the hospital, but I saw Hatcher a lot, and Dr. Del Corral has been in frequent contact with me since I got out of the hospital. I haven&#39;t posted pictures yet (at least not here on Reddit) because I&#39;m self-conscious about a couple still-healing spots, but I&#39;m happy with my results, too.

I had my consult in May 2022 and was given a soft estimate of November 2022-January 2023. My only delay was because of my insurance company and Dr. Del’s office took care of the issue really quickly! I ended up having surgery in January 2023!
