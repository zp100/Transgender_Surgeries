I&#39;m reposting this with a more accurate title.
</p>
<p>
I have about 5 inches of depth, 3.5 dots on dilator #2.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The swelling continues to go down every day. I&#39;m happy with how things look and how they continue to improve.
</p>
<p>
I have clitoral sensation and have been able to orgasm since the second week of recovery. Vaginal stimulation is pleasurable.
</p>
<p>
The only complication that has occurred is wound separation which happened on the bottom left of the labia minora, where the labia minor and major meet. That complication is almost entirely healed at this point.
</p>
<p>
I hope this post is able to help someone. Please feel free to ask questions if you have any!

Why do you describe it as half depth?

Because I was more concerned with the appearance of the vulva than I was with having the most possible depth, Dr. MacPhee advised that we do a &#39;half depth&#39; version of the surgery where she would sacrifice some depth so she had more donor tissue to use on the labia. I lost about 2 in. of depth that would have gone in the vaginal cavity.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if she actually uses the word half depth for other patients, that&#39;s just what she referred to it as during my consultations.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really happy with how things turned out and from her reactions during my follow up visits, I seem to have more depth than she expected.
</p>
<p>
Also I just wanted to say that Dr. MacPhee is a really awesome surgeon with great bedside manner. She gives you a phone number to text/call if you have urgent questions and is always very quick to respond when I have a question. I&#39;m glad that I chose her as my surgeon.

Does that affect your dilation schedule at all?

Not much, I think it probably takes me less time to reach my maximum depth but that&#39;s about it

Looking really good girl! I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre happy with it. Dr. MacPhee seems very talented. I‚Äôd gladly lose a little depth to have a better aesthetic. Amazing to hear you have so much feeling that quick! Enjoy!

Your result looks very pretty.
</p>
<p>
If you trim up the minora and and get the top cinched together I wouldnt be able to tell it isnt cis from the outside only.
</p>
<p>
It looks like since you did half depth you got a pretty result. Her regular results are nowhere near this good, theres some in the wiki, I&#39;m assuming they dont look as good cause they&#39;re full depth.

I still have a lot of healing to do. You&#39;d be surprised how much swelling can impact how things look - in the first three weeks or so it straight up looked like I had a large pair of lips between my legs üòÇ I couldn&#39;t look at other people&#39;s mouths for a while without being reminded of my labia.
</p>
<p>
She actually made sure to give me a well defined clitoral hood that is clearly visible in the pictures she took immediately post op before swelling started, I think the swelling just needs to die down a lot more before you&#39;ll really be able to see it. I think my labia will begin to &#39;hang&#39; a little more as well, which will make it look even more realistic. The labia majora will also smooth out and that folded/wrinkly look will go away.
</p>
<p>
Also, keep in mind that many of Dr. MacPhee&#39;s other patients still post here. I know you&#39;re trying to compliment me but just consider how it would feel to have such an intimate part of yourself that isn&#39;t fully healed put down as not looking as good as someone else&#39;s.

Not only do you look incredible, but you amazing for 7 weeks post op! I‚Äôll definitely have to consider her for when I take the plunge! I feel I can live with 5‚Äù of depth to have that aesthetic!

I don&#39;t believe so. If you wanted good depth and good detail for the labia you could always do a labiaplasty after traditional GRS

Holy crap. I‚Äôm at 8 weeks and I still look like one of Mike Tyson‚Äôs opponents. My scarring is brutal in comparison and everything is still swollen and painful. You‚Äôre obviously a very good healer!

5 inches is not half depth. I don&#39;t think anyone has 10 inches of vaginal canal.

Wow your results look amazing! I&#39;m considering getting shallow/half-depth with Dr. Macphee too but I have a bunch of questions I&#39;d like to ask if you wouldn&#39;t mind PMing me?

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. MacPhee? Do you recommend Dr. MacPhee? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics, sensitivity and depth?
