Hi everyone, I had an orchiectomy two weeks ago and wanted to post this because when I was considering the surgery something that I was really curious about was how it would look afterwords in terms of the profile, or how flat it would get, and I couldn‚Äôt find any direct side-by-side photos comparing this before and after the surgery.
</p>
<p>
The surgery itself went fine. I got referred by the gender clinic I go to, and it took about eight months to get an appointment with the surgical urologist, and then another six months until I got the surgery itself, and it was rescheduled once due to covid. I really lucked out with my date two weeks ago, because as I was waiting to get wheeled into the operating room I overheard nurses talking about an email that they had all received informing them that they would be getting recalled and sent to help with covid related things. Feel free to AMA!
</p>
<p>
Edit for more info: The procedure itself was a bilateral inguinal orchiectomy; I do want a full vaginoplasty in the future so my surgeon didn‚Äôt want to create any extra scar tissue on the scrotum.

Yeah I definitely want full srs eventually. the main reasons for getting an orchiectomy now is that it was quicker to get, had a much shorter recovery time (can‚Äôt afford much more than 2 weeks off of work right now), and that it would help with bottom dysphoria/tucking/creating a flatter profile.

I never had big balls to begin with and now with HRT they have drastically decreased the size even more to the point where I look pretty flat with leggings, so if an orchi helped you with this change I wonder if me getting one would help me look even completely flat without the need of tucking. I was already considering it so much! Thank you for sharing

Not sure how you arrange yourself in your garments. I mostly kept the shaft in upwards position against my body. But it would be nice to get my testicles out of the picture when considering more feminine clothing. And I&#39;m certainly planning on having this done next year due to complications of dealing with SRS surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Do you find it easier to tuck now?

I have always kept everything hanging downward, and I haven‚Äôt tried really tight tucking because I want to wait until I‚Äôm a little more healed. I imagine it will be a ton easier though.

I‚Äôm looking to do the same here hopefully soon‚Ä¶ as early as this week!  My question is though, when you are flaccid , how flat is it?  I wear either tight underwear or a gaff and that seems to pass quite well but would really like to just wear underwear and be done.  I‚Äôm also waiting on SRS here in the next two years.

the photos labeled ‚Äúafter‚Äù show what it looks like for me after the surgery but untucked! this is just a bikini bottom and it isn‚Äôt too tight. i could get it flatter if i wore something tighter but i‚Äôm the same i definitely prefer to just wear underwear and get on with my life lol

At least that‚Äôs reassuring.  Maybe let me know once you are healed well enough.  I tuck and use kt tape and use that for when I wear bikinis‚Ä¶ I pass really well but it‚Äôs an extreme thing to do and not comfortable after a long time.

Thank you so, so much for sharing!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really looking forward to this - I have surgery in a couple weeks!
</p>
<p>
May I ask if any swelling is still there two weeks out, or if there&#39;s discomfort? (You mentioned you didn&#39;t want to do a tighter tuck.)
</p>
<p>
Can I also ask if there&#39;s any of the &#34;hit in the balls&#34; feeling left anywhere? Not sure how to ask this one, but that particular horrible feeling you get when touching them or the tubes that connect them. That feeling is always big dysphoria for me...

Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised at how little swelling there was overall. I can still feel firm ridges under the scars and some bumps if I gently push my fingers into my scrotum, but in my experience swelling hasn‚Äôt really been an issue at all.
</p>
<p>
quick edit: from what I‚Äôve read/heard from my surgeon, there will be considerably more swelling if you have an orchiectomy through midline scrotal incision vs. what I had which is inguinal.
</p>

<p>
I‚Äôm pretty sure that I know the feeling you‚Äôre describing, and while I haven‚Äôt really felt around there too too much, especially for pain sensations, I would say that that I haven‚Äôt felt that kind of pain or discomfort since getting the surgery, and that includes doing things like hiking tight jeans up really forcefully. hope that answers your questions, and good luck with your recovery!

I had my bilateral simple orchiectomy 5 days ago. To offer some perspective of simple versus inguinal.
</p>
<p>
For the first 3 days, it felt like everyone in the OR used my scrotal area as a trampoline. This pain was far beyond kicked in the nuts feeling. I surprisingly don&#39;t have much swelling though. I spend the weekend relaxing and resting. I also have some bleeding that I control with panty liners. The hospital gave me a batch and I went and got some today as I was out. It is down to a tiny spot.
</p>
<p>
Today was the first day I didn&#39;t have a lot of pain. There is some cord pain but otherwise I&#39;m fine. I definitely feel that they are gone. I am a grower not a shower so everything is pretty flat down there at this point. Erections are already difficult. I can already sit with my legs together.
</p>
<p>
Mentally, today is the first day I can feel a difference. I can&#39;t describe it, but I do feel different and have a feeling I haven&#39;t had before. I feel more relaxed but moody today.
</p>
<p>
I resumed hormones today after a 4 month hiatus. We were waiting for cardiology to say if I could. He said at this point it won&#39;t hurt me. I have a complex heart condition so I am one of those that has to be under a cardiologists care while I am taking hormones.
</p>
<p>
Sorry, I forgot to take a before pic. In a few days, ill take an after. There was no bulge in the mirror the other day but I also wasn&#39;t feeling well to really look.
</p>
<p>
If you want to know more, just ask.

Honestly recovery‚Äôs been pretty easy, except for the financial stress of having to take a week off of work! I didn‚Äôt need any pain killers stronger than naproxen except for the T3 they gave me before I left the hospital. I was allowed to shower/bathe right away, and being able to get off of spiro has been SO GREAT! thanks for asking :)

Yeah, the main factor for me was that I was in the middle of a master‚Äôs degree and couldn‚Äôt afford all of the time off would take, especially because I‚Äôd have to pay to fly across canada to get srs, but there are surgical urologists everywhere. I also really wanted to get off of spiro.
