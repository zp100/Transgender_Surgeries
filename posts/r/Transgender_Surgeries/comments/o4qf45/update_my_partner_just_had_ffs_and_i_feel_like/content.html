Man these posts are so necessary but so scary to read right after putting in the deposit at facial team.
</p>
<p>
Facial team gives off such a &#34;we care about you extensively through the entire process&#34; image but even if they want to do that it must be almost impossible as they can&#39;t have full control over their staff and partners.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s to praying they fix this fast.

To be fair it was not truly FT staff, but more like an specific staff and nurses they relied on (another company). I hope FT did something about this behaviour honestly

Yeah it sure must be tough to make sure everyone in the chain treats the patient well, especially when you dont have as good control over affiliates like the private hospital.

I’m so sorry if it has alarmed you (or anyone else). I just really felt that we owed it to other trans people considering surgery there, to provide the information. In all fairness, every single FacialTeam professional we met did keep up that kind and caring manner. And the main thing I am hoping people will take away from my post, is that FacialTeam responded swiftly and positively to the concern I raised. It’s a sign of a good care provider when they take feedback seriously and act on it, and welcome it as an opportunity to improve things. But I can understand how that would be scary to read.

Thank you very much for writing it. It&#39;s definitely better to be aware of it and it&#39;s great that you said something to facial team.

Having gone through multiple other kinds of surgeries, ALWAYS have someone else there with you, especially right after you wake up. You will be severely disoriented, you won&#39;t be able to think clearly, and if you have any complications, you might not be able to advocate for yourself very well.
</p>
<p>
Even besides that, having support is super beneficial. You won&#39;t have to rely on hourly staff who may or may not give a shit about you, they can bring you outside food and keep an eye on your stuff if you take a nap. Not to mention drive you home after you get discharged.

This for sure! My sis reeeeally didn&#39;t wanna eat much if what they brought her, despite most of it being ok haha... I was making smoothies in our air bnb and taking them to her and her partner in the hospital for her to have with a straw, and any craving she got i could go and get while they allowed her partner to stay in a fold out bed in her room so she wasn&#39;t alone through the night. We met others at her group therapy sessions after surgery, and a couple of them came to our air bnb after for a meal too so its good to have people with you plus you&#39;ll be able to meet others too if you like

For those who have surgery consultations with FT, I think it is a legitimate and fair question to ask about post care and concerns raised about the hospital staff in recovery. Ask them what have they done to ensure standards are raised and adhered to, perhaps?

Have a consult with FT coming up and honestly this gives me concern. They&#39;ve got a pretty pristine image from what I&#39;ve read previously, so hearing a couple similar stories in that thread shakes my confidence a bit.

Hi, thanks for your comment. Sorry to have caused worry. I just thought of how my partner scoured these forums before choosing her provider, and I thought it was important to add her story to the mix. Maybe the aftercare is something you could ask about at your consultation?

Hello, I&#39;m Lilia of Facialteam, and we thought a response on the topic might be helpful.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your feedback, which helps us to maintain quality in our care protocols for a low-stress recovery period that is as important as the surgery itself.  For this reason, we sincerely regret if any aspect of our or the hospital&#39;s care has not met expectations. As mentioned in the update, we took immediate action in order to prevent future incidents.
<br>
It is important that patients and companions feel secure about the Facialteam experience, on all levels and at all times, as trust is fundamental to the patient/companion-doctor relationship. We encourage our patients and their companions to take full advantage of open communication with the team when they arise, so solutions may be implemented as efficiently as possible. Your feedback is taken seriously in order to provide the superior services Facialteam patients expect. Your comprehension is appreciated and we are happy to answer any other questions on the topic.
</p>
<p>
Please contact your patient coordinator immediately to discuss any issues that may arise, we remain at your disposal. Kind greetings from the team in Marbella.
</p>

Update from a month later:
</p>
<p>
I think they must have changed some things in response to your complaint because they put a night nurse employed by Facialteam (in their uniform, not HC Marbella&#39;s) on call in the hospital (coming by, hanging IVs and caring for hair implants and such) during the nights.  So thank you for speaking up, it made a difference.

I replied to this in the main thread but just to clarify here that your surgery would have happened before I made my complaint. So it shows that decent aftercare absolutely is available there, but it is a case of “pot luck” based on which nurses are on shift. Well, hopefully not anymore.
