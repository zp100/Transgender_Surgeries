I had penile inversion with scrotal graft srs technique 1 year ago with Dr sutin, I have very good depth 6 inches, and I didn&#39;t have alot of tissues pre op ,I have sensation and I can orgasm, but I am not very happy with the aesthetic outcome, it is acceptable but the clitoral hood looks a bit  like a tucked in penis and I can feel that there is tissues in that area ,I also have two noticeable scars on the labia majora, and I have excess tissues around the urethra, or you can say a minor urethral prolapse.and also I had necrosis on the right labia, and it made my labia minora uneven, my goal is not to talk badly about the surgeon, but I am just sharing my full experience without sugar coating.

Did you try and talk with them about a revision? Going with sutin in a few months and wondering how they handle cases like this

I did try to get a free revision, but the only thing they can do is to lower the price of revision from 6000$ to 4000$ wich is still alot considering I will have to travel to the other side of the world, also revision means more scars than I already have

I don&#39;t feel comfortable doing that, but my clitoral hood is big like a tucked in penis, and I have excess tissues around the urethra and 2 scars on my labia majora.

It&#39;s a bit more difficult to orgasm but it really depends if I am in the mood or not, I don&#39;t know if I will have such a great depth with burin, but if I have a time machine I think that I will risk it and choose burin instead, just because I had complications and I need revision, plus I am not very happy with the aesthetic outcome, so I would go with burin and ask for tunica vaginas especially.
