A little blood spreads a long way. That doesn’t look much to me - I&#39;m a nurse. How long you been bleeding for? You need to seek advice if it&#39;s not stopping or slowing down. Also any pain when you used the dilator?

Maybe you hit some internal granulation tissue?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps see if your doc can take a look inside…

I can share your anxity totally!  Hugs.  Yes it could be a number of things causing this.  Please seek advice from your surgeon for a countermeasure.  Would you mind sharing the name of your surgeon?  Thanks and lots of hugs!

Caveat, my experience is about three weeks less than yours, but I want to hopefully ease your worries. Also, I&#39;m not a health professional, so definitely ask your doctor for more practiced advice.
</p>
<p>
Now it is time to take a breath. It&#39;s gonna be alright. I bled more than that when I first went up to the second to last size, like a lot more. I freaked out all day, waiting for a reply from my doctors. They suggested taking it easy for a few days. i.e. go back to the size down one, and then try again after a few days. Now, in that few days I had a pre-scheduled checkup, and my doctor reassured me that blood is normal when going up in dilator size.
</p>
<p>
When I went back up the second time, I had about as much blood as I see in your video. From my understanding, it&#39;s fairly normal as long as you&#39;re not gushing blood, which they advised me if that did happen to apply pressure to the bleeding site and call them. And now I don&#39;t bleed at all with the second largest size. Haven&#39;t for a week.
</p>
<p>
Still, everyone&#39;s doctors are different, and can have varying rules and guidelines for recovery of their work, so the best place to voice your concerns is with them. They might want to just take a look. Otherwise, I&#39;d say you are doing great.

Hun you are going to be fine.  That is not a lot of blood.  That much could easily have been a granulation issue, a random stitch being pulled, or simply stretching and a little micro tear.   I had much the same when I went to the biggest dilator.   We all think that the little 1/8” difference between dilators isn’t much, but to healing and scar tissue it is. And for that area it means a LOT.
</p>
<p>
You’re doing great. I’d say unless you have an active blood flow thing going on (think big open cut type of flow) you’re ok.  But, if you’re still concerned call your surgeon.

My dilator set is the other brand but the 4th (orange) is about the same size as your blue 5th. When I attempted to use the orange and started bleeding, I went back to the next size down for a few more weeks before attempting the largest one again. Talk to your surgeon, you may have some granulation that needs medicine.

I have bled like that, maybe more. I think there are several explanations. Internal granulation will bleed when stretched.  Scar tissue can bleed when stretched. Sometimes, I&#39;ve been bleeding at random other times. It should stop after an hour or so. Just use pads. It feels like a lot of blood, but it probably isn&#39;t. You may need get silver nitrate treatment on the inside to help it heal. If in doubt ask your nurse or surgeon.

I would probably consult your doctor. It could be granulation tissue but they will know best

I had blood for months. See your doctor, granulation tissue 100%! I had to go back 17 times to get it all.

Yes, granulation tissue is one of the most common side effects with GCS, and sometimes it’s very persistent and doesn’t want to go away. Because you can’t stop dilating, you’re irritating it everyday. It took until almost 7-8 months before it was all gone. It does go away, you just have to work on it.
