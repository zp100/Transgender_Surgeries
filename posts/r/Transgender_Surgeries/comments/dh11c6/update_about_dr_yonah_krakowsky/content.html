That is not entirely accurate. As
<a href="/u/hiddenstill" rel="nofollow">/u/hiddenstill</a>
mentioned, they did their first 3 surgeries in June, they are also on track to do another 3 by the end of the year.

To answer your questions: He was trained by Dr Bowers and uses a similar technique to hers. As far as I know, yes they are accepting referrals, but you could get in touch with their Nurse Practitioner and confirm (the Transition Related Surgery page on the WCH website has their contact info, and details of what they need for a referral). According to them, yes, the first surgeries went well, I&#39;ve seen early post-op photos from their 4th patient, and they looked similar to some of Bowers&#39; day 1/2 result photos. They haven&#39;t had any major complications, and from what I&#39;ve heard, they&#39;re doing well.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, I&#39;m scheduled for surgery with them in November as their 6th vaginoplasty patient. (They&#39;re currently doing 1 a month while the program is still getting set up. I don&#39;t know what their future plans for tempo are. )

I&#39;m planning to, though I&#39;m not certain when I&#39;ll feel up to it after surgery.
