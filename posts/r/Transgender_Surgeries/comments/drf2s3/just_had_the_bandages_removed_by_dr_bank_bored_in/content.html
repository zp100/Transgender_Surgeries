Haha must‚Äôve just missed you! And thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è! So far I feel like I couldn‚Äôt have made a better choice.
</p>
<p>
And yeah today I get my first dilation (yaaaay üôÉ), but eh, it‚Äôs done, no going back. Do what I gotta do and I know it‚Äôll be worth it after the few months of hell I‚Äôve braced for.

Hospital is wonderful. Honestly way better than any american hospital I&#39;ve ever stayed in. Room has wood lining and decorative curtains... outfitted with a fridge, microwave, etc. Feels better than a hotel room tbh.
</p>
<p>
After getting through customs and immigration (super easy), a clinic staff member was there with a sign exactly where the email said she would be. She helped me get checked into the hotel (very helpful since most of the hotel staff know little to no english). I got a card saying when to be in the lobby for pickup to the various pre-op appointments/final hospital check in, and pretty much everything went smoothly from there. The whole clinic staff are very friendly, and one of them (Vikki) is a native english speaker and trans women, so she&#39;s very good to have around.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t have any surgical complications. I did have an unusually hard time walking when it was time for the shower, and couldn&#39;t even make it to the bathroom on the day I was supposed to have one. I think this was because I was just coming off an anti-nausea drug that had pretty much knocked me out. The next day though (ie 10 minutes ago as I write this :P) went fine.

Thank you!!! Was wide awake on day 2, but day 3 (or 4 I don&#39;t remember) they put me on anti-nausea medication that I believe also happened to be a narcotic of some kind (especially given that it took them like an hour to get it approved). Anyways, whatever it was, it put into a sleep trance hybrid for like, a day? Maybe two? I have no idea. Got me sleeping in any case!
</p>
<p>
How do you feel at 10 weeks? Heard dilation starts to get harder in the second/third month.

Think I covered most of it in my other replies (and too tired to write it again lol sorry!), but the TLDR:
</p>
<p>
Experience has been wonderful. Hardest part is the language barrier, but there&#39;s a native english speaking trans girl on the clinic staff so worst case, she always seems know what to do (Vikki if you read this thank you you&#39;re amazing. Also I hope I&#39;m spelling your name right üòÖ)
</p>
<p>
Hospital stay had me SOOOO nervous before surgery, but except for a few hiccups (as expected with any major surgery), it&#39;s been wonderful. Unlike America, the rooms here are more comparable to hotel rooms. And yeah, Bank is lovely, the nurses are lovely (although language barrier has been a problem a couple times), and thank you for the well wishes &lt;3

So incredible!  Do you immediately know/feel its gone when you wake up?  Is it a relief or a sense of weight lifted?  I have no clue how far from this I am but I&#39;m starting the process now :)  thank you for sharing, looking forward to how the healing does.

Was never particularly dysphoric, so no major relief, just happiness.
</p>
<p>
First night was just soreness in the area and I still had phantom dick sensations (I think my brain only knew the area hurt and just assumed).
</p>
<p>
A few days in I could start contracting muscles and that‚Äôs when I started discovering that they all moved my parts in different ways. For example, sending the signal that‚Äôd normally lift the penis now contracts the vagina, and telling my body to ‚Äúcontract the penis‚Äù now contracts the area around the clitoris.  Playing with the muscles was the first way I started noticing differences, especially since I felt things happen internally rather than externally.
</p>
<p>
Some girls have lasting phantom sensations, but so far for me it‚Äôs felt like I simply have no dick, just have some weird new organ my brain is trying to wrap its head around.

It‚Äôs genital euphoria. I didn‚Äôt  get much psychological pain pain from having a penis, but still felt much happier at the thought of having a pussy.
</p>
<p>
Same way you might come across say... a cute skirt you like. You don‚Äôt get pain from not having it, but having it brings you joy. Just in the case of GRS, $20,000 and a year of recovery worth of joy.
</p>
<p>
Hope that kinda explains it.

Hi! I saw your AMA post about Dr. Banks from 4 years ago (thanks for doing that!) and this comment you made described how I feel exactly.
</p>
<p>
How do you feel about your decision now?
</p>
<p>
I really want a pussy but the recovery sounds intimidating. I hope I can
</p>
<p>
work up the nerve to do it.

Christ, it has been four whole years. That&#39;s crazy to me lol.
</p>
<p>
I think you are right to be intimidated by recovery. I had it relatively easy, and it still consumed my life. I watched basically the entirety of Breaking Bad during the first few months of dilation. I had the money that I didn&#39;t have to work, and coincidentally the whole thing lined up pretty well with COVID anyways so half of my recovery was literally during lockdown. Obviously, something like that is probably not gonna happen for you. And I think it&#39;s safe to say that for at least half a year you will be more or less handicapped.
</p>
<p>
I also had two complications. The first is a deep wound that never healed that continues to make dilation fairly painful even now. It&#39;s not the worst thing, especially since dilation is only like once a week. But that happened. The bigger frustration from this complication is that it makes penetration extremely painful if my partner goes too deep, which is... annoying.
</p>
<p>
My second complication is that I tend to get bad rashes on my labia caused by extensive walking. Once the rash starts, I have to either wash up or stop moving or else the whole area gets severely irritated very quickly. This has kind of crippled my ability to do long or multi-day hikes, which was one of my favorite activities.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not saying you&#39;ll have either of these problems specifically, but just be aware that issues are not unlikely and might affect you in ways you&#39;re not expecting. Or you might be fine. My buddy who had surgery around the same time had no issues whatsoever to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>
That all said, it was
<em>
absolutely
</em>
worth it. I feel great. Everything from feeling that much less weird while nude in women&#39;s and non-queer spaces, to being able to wear what I want when I want without having to tuck, to just looking in the mirror and finding joy in my body. I also started dating a cis man around 2 years into my recovery, and while I suspect he would have accepted me either way, it absolutely gave me a lot more personal confidence early in our relationship.

Thanks for the reply! Thank you for sharing these details. I do want to make sure I know what I&#39;m getting into, and great to know you definitely feel it was still worth it. As I read about recovery and risks, several times it&#39;s scared me off, but it doesn&#39;t take long and I&#39;m back to feeling like I want to do it again.
</p>
<p>
One question about dilation, if you&#39;re up for it as it&#39;s rare to be able to talk to somebody years out - have you been able to substitute penetrative sex (PIV of dildo) for dilation? I&#39;ve read on some surgeon&#39;s websites that it&#39;s possible but am really trying to get a direct perspective on this.
</p>
<p>
P.S.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also a hiker! I&#39;ve done several 14&#39;ers in Colorado. I am sorry to hear your ability to do long hikes has been affected, I know how much that must suck.

Ahh! Colorado was where I mostly grew up. I loved hiking through the mountains, and yeah losing the ability to freely do that sucked :/. Colorado was so amazing for it.
</p>
<p>
On your question -
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t substitute PIV for dilation. Half the process of dilation is stretching the tissue all the way in the back, so to substitute that with PIV I&#39;m envisioning a partner sticking their dick all the way to the back of your vagina and pushing into it slowly.
</p>
<p>
And maybe PIV sex that doesn&#39;t go all the way to depth would still stretch the tissue in the right way?? but I wouldn&#39;t trust it. Like maybe it works, but if it doesn&#39;t work then you&#39;d find that out the hard way I guess is what I&#39;m saying

Congratulations, I&#39;m so happy for you :)
</p>
<p>
I saw in a previous post that you were considering Mcginn aswell waht made you decide to go with Dr Banks in the end?
</p>
<p>
How has been your experience so far with the syoirn clinic?

First off, thank you!
</p>
<p>
As for Banks or McGinn. Honestly I don‚Äôt remember most of it. At some point after hours and days of research I just chose Bank and stopped thinking about it from there because continuing to think about it was causing undue stress. (maybe when I‚Äôm less exhausted I‚Äôll update this or make another post about it because I do think there‚Äôs a lot of information that should‚Äôve been more easily accessible which I had to dig through)
</p>
<p>
The short of it though is that I wanted an analogous result (ie as similar as possible to a cis girls genitals in terms of having the same parts feel and function the same) so I could better relate to other cis girls socially. and keeping it analogous seemed/seems to be what Suporns focus was. The advantage of PI seems to be that it‚Äôs simpler (ie less risky, easier recovery, easier for a surgeon to learn). McGinn‚Äôs approach seemed to be to modify PI to give it certain cisnormative features not found in the basic technique (such as a scrotal graft, granting possible lubrication and a more natural color), however in the end, it seemed to me that any PI variant, however good the aesthetics, sensation, or depth, still wouldn‚Äôt cut it for what I was looking for.
</p>
<p>
So far I think I made the right choice here. I‚Äôve been talking/comparing with my cis girl/trans guy friends, and even the muscles in there are functionally the same it seems. Will probably find out more about this with time and healing.
</p>
<p>
And the experience with the clinic has been pretty good. They have one native english speaking staff member (also a trans girl herself), and most of the rest of the staff have enough passing english to communicate what you need to, but the language barrier is definitely there.
</p>
<p>
In terms of friendliness though, everyone is just lovely. Not much more to add to that.
</p>
<p>
Only frustrations came before I was in thailand while emailing their  booking, if you ask a question,  you‚Äôll instead get a copy-pasted block of text that happens to contain the information you asked for. In retrospect, this isn‚Äôt the worst thing, since it helps cover all grounds, but it does feel kinda impersonal, so just fyi if you‚Äôre sensitive to that.
</p>
<p>
I also got a few bits of information that were unclear and could have been rather bad. They want you to get a tourist visa, not medical (Type-O), but that wasn‚Äôt made clear until I asked a question about getting my Type-O and only then got the block of text about how to get the tourist visa. Another email said finasteride based products were ok, so I was rather surprised by the frustrated look when I said I‚Äôd kept taking finasteride (which is apparently itself NOT ok?).
</p>
<p>
After all that though, I want to reiterate! Once actually in thailand, everything was amazing.
</p>
<p>
PS it‚Äôs the middle of the night right now so sorry for any incoherent rambliness

Wo thank you for such a detailed response!
</p>
<p>
Haha no problem, you can answer this tomorrow if you like, please take your time.
</p>
<p>
BTW I have been looking at the Suporn clinic for quite sometime now and came to the same conclusion as you. I am now primarily looking at Dr Banks aswell.
</p>
<p>
Did you chose to go with Dr Banks over Dr Suporn specifically or was it that you were able to get a date secured with him faster?
</p>
<p>
So you leave the hospital in a few days right and how are your pain levels, are you still on IV pain killers?
</p>
<p>
Did you just do the standard under 30 day stay or did you extend beond that.
</p>
<p>
Thank you :)

Aww thank you &lt;3
</p>
<p>
I became interested in Suporn between when he announced his retirement and when he announced he would be delaying it. I saw I could get a Bank date though, and figured by the time came to pay the full deposit, there would be more information on whether he was holding up to Suporn&#39;s reputation (and if people were dissatisfied with him I could simply cancel the surgery, which in the grand scheme of surgery costs, was worth the financial risk to me). Sure enough, the stories started circulating that Bank was indeed a very good surgeon (I think one person said she believed from seeing both surgeons results that Bank might even be better), so I just kept the booked date and started making travel plans.
</p>
<p>
Leaving the hospital tomorrow (fingers crossed I can pee, otherwise they&#39;ll be sending me back with the catheter. Had one re-inserted once during FFS recovery, kill me). Pain has been WAY lower than I imagined. Only exception being the first night after surgery, during which the nurse actually had to tell me to stop pressing the morphine button üòÖ. Oh yeah and also during a morning checkup, Bank accidentally tapped my clit and umm... let&#39;s just say it does indeed have sufficient sensation!
</p>
<p>
And I&#39;m staying for 33 days if all goes to plan. Got the 60 day visa (as per recommendation of the clinic), which I figure is good in case of any major complications.

Did you get a choice of anaesthetics? I heard that Bank/Suporn offer either a general or a epidural.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. Bank over Dr. Suporn? Do you recommend Dr. Bank? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in Thailand(Chon Buri)? How was Dr. Bank&#39;s aftercare? Have you tried the dilators of the soul? And if you used them, is there any advantage? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

Got the date back when Suporn planned to retire in 2020 and had little availability. Figured I‚Äôd cancel if Bank didn‚Äôt sound like he was holding up, but it sounded like he did.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bank is easily just as competent as Suporn. Every Bank patient I met was satisfied.
</p>

Aesthetically looks natural, a little better really. Some minor complaints, but tbh even if they don‚Äôt resolve as I heal, I‚Äôm still the only one who‚Äôll notice.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Sensation is still lacking. I still have some numb areas, which Suporn himself took a look at and thought it was odd. Even sensate areas are still generally too tender to enjoy, though obviously expect that to get better.

¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. The hotel was mediocre, but the local food was good (just don‚Äôt get american food there for fucks sake)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Has some issues. I‚Äôd often got inconsistent and contradictory information from different people, and relied more on the patients who were back for revision and my own intuition than the staff. Also the post op care book they gave me was an outdated version with uncomfortable language and bad information (now I rely on a newer one my friend got). I could go on, but basically it‚Äôs a bit of a mess imo despite the reputation.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
7/8. Not sure what those are, but the dilators they gave me worked fine, so I never looked at other options.
</p>

And thank you!
