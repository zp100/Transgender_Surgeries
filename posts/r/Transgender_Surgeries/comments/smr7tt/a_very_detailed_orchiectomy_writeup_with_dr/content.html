So after 2 years of HRT, most of which I was aware that the T blockers were very much not doing their job that well, I finally managed to convince my therapist to fill in the form-letter template for WPATH compliance and find me another therapist for the second letter back in mid-October. I&#39;d wanted an orchiectomy for literally longer than I even knew I was trans, it was just hard to find therapists in the area who&#39;d write the letters and if I COULD HAVE I would&#39;ve gotten it a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
The only doc in the state I really knew about with, like, actual REVIEWS and who&#39;s actually USED TO dealing with trans patients is Dr. Jonathan Witten at First Urology. All-in-all it was less than 3 months from phone call to surgery, with consultation happening at around the 2 month mark and surgery as soon as possible afterwards 0 in this case, exactly 3 weeks.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/rgmeng/just_had_my_orchi_consultation_with_jonathan/">I already did a write-up on the consultation
</a>
so no point going over THAT, but suffice to say, I like Dr. Witten and would definitely recommend him if you&#39;re within an hour or two of Louisville.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, a little bit after the consultation, I got a pamphlet in the mail with pre-op instructions - standard stuff for most surgeries really, nothing too special, just &#34;don&#39;t shave down there for 2 days&#34; and &#34;no Aspirin based medications or smoking for a week&#34; and &#34;no food or drink after midnight or 8 hours pre-op&#34; and while I don&#39;t usually smoke, I had been tapering off of vaping and my Adderall in the weeks leading up to surgery. I didn&#39;t get COMPLETELY off nicotine, but I DID fully quit Adderall.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day of surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was excited enough for it that I couldn&#39;t sleep that well, I got 4-ish hours of laying in bed sorta maybe dozing but not really accomplishing much. My mom had come over to my place, since she was willing to drive me, and slept here the night before so we could just kinda roll outta bed and into the car in the morning.
</p>
<p>
The hospital Dr. Witten had surgery slots in was Baptist Health Louisville, although he operates out of a number of hospitals in the area and just goes wherever there&#39;s an open O.R. on any given day. They&#39;re serious about COVID, so I needed to be in an hour before my 9am check-in time to get a PCR test.
</p>
<p>
However, everyone in the hospital was working as fast as they could to run as many people through as possible cause this was when Omicron was picking up. On the drive in, we heard on the radio that Baptist Louisville was gonna be postponing electives starting 2 days after my appointment, so I was really lucky to not get my date pushed back. The PCR test results came back in 15 minutes, and by 8:30 I was signed in and waiting to go to a preop room. 8:50, I got my grippy socks on and changed into a hospital gown and disposable underwear, and that was the last point I have actual DATA on time until the actual operation as my phone and watch went into a Patient Belongings bag for my mom to hold onto while I was in surgery. Until the actual surgery time, I have no concept of how long anything took.
</p>
<p>
After that point, several people came into my preop room and went over informed consent for various things - mostly anaesthesia related, I did have a minor argument with the anaesthesiologist over whether to give me sedation on top of the spinal/epidural block cause their standard procedure was to wipe your memory with VerSed which I VERY MUCH DID NOT WANT - the only reason I was GETTING SPINAL in the first place instead of getting knocked out was SO I COULD REMEMBER IT. Eventually they said &#34;we&#39;ll only sedate you if you get too anxious&#34; which was fine by me, cause all MY medical anxiety is related to talking to doctors and not actually being worked on.
</p>
<p>
Then, Dr. Witten came in, went over a buncha stuff pre-op one more time that we&#39;d gone over in the consultation, talked with my mom a bit, everything went pretty smooth and his bedside manner was as good as ever. I did kinda pick up that he was a bit nervous about working on a CONSCIOUS patient, as I think he&#39;d only ever done an orchi under full general anaesthesia before and this was his first time doing it under spinal, but I expressed that I would be fine and acknowledged they&#39;d sedate me if things got to be too much.
</p>
<p>
After all that, mom left the room again with my stuff, and I was prepped for surgery - IV drip hooked up, got REALLY cold from the saline, they gave me a shot of preoperative antibiotics and (for some reason) some Pepcid for anti-nausea into the IV, and when the OR was ready I got wheeled in.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
My concept of time returned once I entered the O.R. on the gurney as there was a really big clock on the wall to my left, where I could see it even after the surgical drapes were put down, so THIS part is gonna have actual timestamps.
</p>
<p>
At about 10am, I got into the room and they rolled me off the gurney and onto the freshly-autoclaved and still warm Muslin surgery blankets. They went over my info one more time, reiterated some oral consent to various parts of the procedure, and the anaesthesiologist instructed me to sit on the edge of the operating table and &#34;arch my back like a cat&#34; so she could give my spinal block.
</p>
<p>
Well, I re-learned that my high amount of Irish blood makes anaesthetics not work all that well, cause the pre-injection local they gave to make the giant spinal needle not hurt so much did literally nothing and after their second re-numbing attempt I just gritted my teeth and took it. That, in my opinion, was the worst part of the surgery. Then, the spinal block ALSO didn&#39;t do all that much either - it basically felt like everything below my waist was COLD and ASLEEP but far from actually being NUMB, I could still move both legs and all my toes - and the pinch test and the ice cube test failed for me, proving I could still feel the pain down there. I really didn&#39;t mind, I have a high pain tolerance when there&#39;s a reward associated with it, and Dr. Witten was understanding and said he&#39;d use plenty of local anaesthetic on the actual surgery site.
</p>
<p>
That took about 10 minutes, so at 10:10-ish I laid flat, spread-eagle on the table with the arm supports out, got covered in fresh warm blankets and a hot-air warmer on top of that cause the anaesthesia and the fact I hadn&#39;t eaten or slept much in the last 10 hours meant I was feeling REALLY cold. The surgery site was prepped with one of those big sponge-on-a-handle thingies of orange-dyed Chlorhexidine-alcohol antiseptic, I was draped in sterile Tyvek, and they hung a Tyvek curtain in front of me (against my wishes since I wanted to watch, but I didn&#39;t argue that much) so I couldn&#39;t see what was going on.
</p>
<p>
Lemme tell you, that spinal block was doing literally nothing cause when Dr. Witten (or one of his assistants, can&#39;t see) gave the Bupivacaine spermatic cord and Raphe incision anaesthesia, I FELT THAT. Once again, I didn&#39;t really mind - hell, after wanting this procedure for years it&#39;d sorta become a kink of mine, I actually kinda enjoyed it - but I DID tell him that I was definitely not numb. It took the edge off though, cause while I did FEEL everything going on it wasn&#39;t unbearable.
</p>
<p>
I felt some tugging, and the Raphe line incision being cut, which didn&#39;t hurt much. After that, I didn&#39;t really feel a whole lot besides more tugging as (I was following along in my head with the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840oej-7KmU">tutorial video (NSFL)
</a>
) he cut down through the Dartos muscle and Tunica Vaginalis, and couldn&#39;t REALLY pinpoint what step he was on until I felt the cords get yanked out as far as they&#39;d go and get clamped with forceps. That hurt a little bit, and he pulled BOTH testes out before moving on to the next step instead of cutting and ligating one-at-a-time like in the video.
</p>
<p>
This is, for someone who DOESN&#39;T have a kink for it, the worst part and why I&#39;d recommend anyone who isn&#39;t into this to just get it done under general anaesthesia:
</p>
<p>
He got out the blunt dissection scissors, gave the cords another good yank, and slowly cut through the right one first, then the left. That? That hurt enough that when he finished, I told him &#34;Yeah, I definitely felt THAT one!&#34; and he gave me another shot of Bupivacaine into the cords. Which didn&#39;t help, because immediately afterwards, he got out the electrocautery pen and cauterized the ends of the cords, which hurt even more, followed by cauterizing the bleeders in the rest of the surgery site, after which the operating room smelled like a delicious combination of cooked bacon and burnt hair.
</p>
<p>
Worst part over with, he ligated the cords with 2/0 Vicryl (none of that &#34;nylon ligature clip&#34; crap, he&#39;s a GOOD surgeon not a LAZY one and I specifically asked what ligatures he was using in the consultation) and, naturally, I felt a lot of that but it was really not painful in comparison to the last couple minutes. I felt a wet sensation and heard squirting noises, followed by the surgery site going slightly more numb than it was before as he sprayed a Bupivacaine splash block into the surgery site, then from there it was simply a matter of stitching everything back up.
</p>
<p>
Stitching, for a surgeon who does this every day, is basically automatic and doesn&#39;t require much concentration so we made small talk while he stitched me up. Since I wasn&#39;t sedated or nauseous, and hadn&#39;t eaten, I told him I was basically starving and talked about how as soon as I got outta the hospital I was gonna stop at that Wendy&#39;s I saw on the way in and DEMOLISH a Baconator.
</p>
<p>
All said and done, the surgery took 20 minutes, and at around 10:30 I got 2 entire rolls of crinkle gauze shoved into my disposable skivvies and they rolled me back onto the gurney and took me to a recovery room.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Rolled into the Phase 1 Recovery room, and was greeted by the on-duty nurse who was clearly NOT used to patients being fully awake and sober in her care. I told her I was hungry and kinda thirsty, and she basically just assumed I was coming off of SOMETHING - either VerSed or Propofol - and was gonna be nauseous until I told her otherwise. She wanted to just give me ice chips but I managed to convince her to give me a can of ginger ale, naturally one of the tiny little 8oz ones. After I got through THAT fine, she got me another can of it and some Graham crackers, which I also finished, before finally getting an 8oz can of Pepsi, some Graham AND saltine crackers, and a cup of applesauce. That took the edge off my - at this point probably close to 11 hour long - hunger and thirst. The block started to wear off, so my last drink got used to wash down a Perc 7.5 which didn&#39;t make me any less in pain, but DID make me sleepy.
</p>
<p>
I did still get a cup of ice chips tho, just cause sucking on ice is a good way to kill time when I&#39;ve still got hours of anaesthetic and they won&#39;t let me leave until things wear off, and mom can&#39;t come into Phase 1 Recovery with my phone, so I kinda just stared at the wall sucking on ice, making small talk with the nurses about what it&#39;s like to be trans and how bad COVID is ravaging our broken down healthcare system, did it all over again once shift change happened at Noon, and by 12:30 was FINALLY worn off enough that they at least wheeled me into Phase 2 Recovery - if I remember correctly, the criteria was being able to move my legs STRONGLY enough that I could pull my knees up or something instead of just limply flopping around? IDK it&#39;s been over a month and I was high at the time.
</p>
<p>
There, instead of being in an open bay, I got a private room with a curtain which was nice. Mom also came in, so I got my phone and watch back and could get
<a href="https://twitter.com/LenKusov/status/1478422216282886144">back on Twitter
</a>
to kill time. That... took way longer than it probably should have, all things considered.
</p>
<p>
The main criteria for being able to leave after a spinal block is for it to wear off enough to control my bladder. Easier said than done, given how aside from IV fluids and a few mini cans of Ginger Ale and Pepsi and some ice chips I didn&#39;t really have much liquid in me, AND, my pelvic floor was seemingly the only place I was ACTUALLY numb. Honestly wish I had just gotten local on its own, it would&#39;ve hurt about the same all things considered, and I woulda been able to go home as soon as I got outta the O.R. instead of waiting around for my bladder to start working at like 1:45pm before they finally got my discharge papers ready. They gave me a handful of Maxi pads to use with my actual briefs instead of the disposable mesh undies, some anti-nausea meds I didn&#39;t need, some laxatives to keep from straining too much, a tube of Bacitracin ointment, and a frankly ridiculous number of Percocets for how few I actually needed, and wheeled me out to the car.
</p>
<p>
Out of the hospital, we swung by the Wendy&#39;s on the way out to the expressway like I said we would, I got a Baconator combo with a Coke and absolutely DEMOLISHED that shit on the hour and 15 ride home. We had to swing by Walgreens to pick up a refill for my Provera script, cause I was running low and knew the next few days would be worse, and I could walk fine as long as I kept my legs spread to keep from irritating the stitches. Got home to my Blahaj having arrived in the mail, and (against my better judgement) passed out with my
<a href="https://twitter.com/LenKusov/status/1478488436931805190">bra half off, cuddling my new Blahaj,
</a>
not showered yet, and slept til midnight.
</p>
<p>
The next day or two were the worst, but I really wouldn&#39;t call them BAD. It definitely was WAY easier than my wisdom teeth to heal up, I held off from walking TOO much, but everything went smoothly. Day after surgery I was still on painkillers but really not that urgently, they mostly just helped me sleep easier, and I had my boyfriend drive me to Meijer so I could buy a jockstrap for my Maxi pad so there was more compression - that was the main thing keeping me from walking much, loose clothing that let things shift.
</p>
<p>
The second day after was better, I switched the Percocets out for Tylenol except before bed, and what little bleeding there was on leaving the hospital had lessened to just a few spots on the pad here-and-there along with a lotta the Bacitracin antibiotic goop. That was ALSO the day where my libido overcame my willingness to obey doctor&#39;s orders, because I wasn&#39;t SUPPOSED to do any sexual activity for an entire MONTH but what are the odds of me being able to hold out THAT LONG? Didn&#39;t hurt anything anyway, and was a LOT of fun since my residual T levels had previously made getting girlgasms a needlessly complicated mess of headspace, timing of progesterone and estrogen doses, and pure luck whereas NOW I can get a girlgasm WHENEVER I WANT!
</p>
<p>
By day three post-op I was basically off all painkillers, the pain was basically nothing as long as I wore some kind of compression underwear so they were pretty pointless to keep taking. Other than that, uneventful day.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to one week after surgery, my incision was pretty much healed up - no scabbing except for where some of the skin didn&#39;t quite line up from an off-center stitch, no real pain. Two weeks after, things had FULLY healed - not a scab anywhere except for leakage around the Monocryl sutures.
</p>
<p>
Which brings me to TODAY, when the extremely stubborn Monocryl finally dissolved enough for the knots on the ends of the mattress stitches to pop off when I absentmindedly scratched at them while waking up. Honestly wish Witten used a faster dissolving suture like catgut or something, but meh, they weren&#39;t THAT bad to have while they lasted but they also weren&#39;t exactly fun. For those counting, today is one month and 3 days post op - my orchi was on January 4th.
</p>
<p>
This surgery was probably one of the best decisions I ever made and the last month, even with the minor gripes about stitches and aching spermatic cord remnants and such, has been one of the best times of my life. If you&#39;re a trans girl who doesn&#39;t have enough bottom dysphoria to justify getting full SRS (or can&#39;t afford it) then I HIGHLY recommend getting an orchi cause you don&#39;t even REALIZE how nice it is to be without balls until you finally are.

If all goes well, and there&#39;s VERY few horror stories for any doctor who&#39;s actually halfway decent, I know you won&#39;t regret it. It&#39;s really no big deal and it was honestly more of a hassle to get the paperwork to get the surgery than it was to actually GET THE SURGERY.

I mean, if you can&#39;t get WPATH letters and can&#39;t wait around for v8 to drop which loosens requirements a bunch, or if you can&#39;t afford American hospital prices and need a sub-$1000 orchi without mooching off your dad&#39;s really good employer insurance plan like I did, then go for it. Most of the Mexican surgeons are, at minimum, decent at their jobs and any of the ones offering full SRS oughta be MORE than capable of doing an orchi without trouble.

Some time this spring idk, although if you&#39;re just waiting on the &#34;time on HRT&#34; requirement it&#39;s prolly best to just wait cause either v8 drops and the requirement is cut to 6 months, or you hit a year and can get all the paperwork started. Either way, a lot easier than flying to Mexico.

Pretty high, the draft version opened for comments in December and THAT version said 6 months so it probably hasn&#39;t changed.

Honestly no clue, depends on the company and the surgeon and how good the surgeon&#39;s &#34;yell at insurance people on the phone and brute-force every CPT code til one works&#34; specialist is. There&#39;s still some weird obscure insurance companies running WPATH v6 from the early 2000s but they&#39;re rare and the big players keep things up-to-date.

I will one day have my GCS but have no financial path to that goal as of yet. I got my Orchie 4 months ago after 2 years of HRT. Wow. My mind has become calmer, both internally, and externally. By that I mean the second &#34;voice&#34; in me has gone away. He doesn&#39;t talk to me any more. Externally, the knowledge that my body cannot ever detransition now, even if I lose my E is so comforting. I am CHEMICALLY 100% transitioned. My breasts have double since my orchie, which is nice, since they were not as big as I would have liked. (They&#39;re and honest B bordering on C, which isn&#39;t to my liking, but at least I can see REAL boobs under my blouse now). I 100% agree with you that if you are going to get GCS anyways, but not any time soon, do this now if it&#39;s an option. As a side note, sex has gotten much more intense (and feminine) than every before.

I just got an orchi that I was under for, and I still have a bit of pain a week on from surgery. I think you&#39;re overstating the sexual aspects of it a little. I&#39;m glad I was under for it.

Well, it&#39;s obviously different for everyone and it might just be that euphoria is really making things a lot stronger for me, I dunno. As for healing I did have SOME pain but it was basically just a dull ache in the cords and some sensitivity at the stitches that really didn&#39;t need meds to control.
</p>
<p>
It might just be that, for me personally, getting an orchi wasn&#39;t &#34;settling&#34; for a cheaper surgery, it&#39;s what I&#39;ve wanted from the start. Now that I got it, it feels like I&#39;m finally at home in my own body, my genitals feel like MINE now, and I can use them without having to be extra super duper careful to not accidentally disturb the dysphoria orbs and throw myself out of the moment anymore.

Thank you so much for the detailed and entertaining write up :)  I have my Orchi this Thursday with Dr. Stiller in Spokane.  A few years back I had a Vasectomy and it was interesting chatting with the doc about fly fishing while they cut, tied and burned.  This time is general anesthesia, reading your experience is good enough recount for me.

Hour and 15 min drive? Like towards Evansville, maybe? This is the 2nd or 3rd account I&#39;ve heard of Dr Witten. Putting together a decent picture of a local trans friendly doctor.

Nah, just Lexington. There ARE surgeons who&#39;ll do an orchi in Lex but the one at UK is an absurdly long wait time (as most UK stuff tends to be) and the one at Lexington Clinic, after having a consult with THEM as well, is... less than stellar with trans patients...

I had my orchiectomy by Dr Witten on October 3,2022 He was, as you said, very good.  I had requested to be given a spinal, as I wanted to be awake to  be aware when, after many years of wanting to be castrated it was finally done. BUT, Dr. Witten  and the anesthesiologist said no. And laying there in operating room, I was in no position to argue. Anyway, everything went well. Sounds like I had a much easier recovery than your experience.  I looked up on my chart the doctor&#39;s notes, which described the surgery, which was interesting. Also, they biopsied my both my testicle. That was very interesting.

I put in the request to be awake during the consultation, and reaffirmed it during the day-before confirmation call with the anaesthesiologist. It doesn&#39;t really surprise me that they&#39;d deny it when you&#39;re already in surgical prep, usually they don&#39;t want to deviate from the standard plan once things are actually in motion.

Hopefully starting HRT this month, then I have to wait a year to bin the berries as per the guidelines where I am, too much full GCS fears especially in my financial position, whereas I&#39;ve seen far less scary orchis.

<p>
Thanks for the detailed write-up and the pics, you&#39;re healing awesomely must say.

I def applaud you for being able to stop taking it for the surgery. I stopped taking adderall a few years ago once and for all which was a very hard thing to do. It is like half way between breaking up with somebody you love and kicking out somebody you hate. But now my hair grows thicker every day that I don’t take badderall

Yea that pretty much describes addiction to anything tbh, but like, I managed to taper off just cause at the time I had a decent social support system to keep me stable and no job or other major responsibilities to keep up with. Once I started having responsibilities again I started realizing I wasn&#39;t functioning without it and once the surgical afterglow wore off I realized I felt like shit all the time, thankfully I never actually cancelled the prescription for it.
