There have been a variety of issues with peritoneal tissue. It’s not very stretchy, it’s very thin, it’s does not necessarily produce good lubrication, has tearing issues, and issues with tissue shrinkage over the long term. Just avoid it, Ting abandoned it, bluebond only uses it in cases when there are no other good options, most doctors who have looked at it have opted to either not use it or stop using it and there are reasons for that, probably beyond what I have described.
</p>
<p>
In terms of the colon method, reach out to doctors who perform this method, the old school lower colon section that’s used to be used (what most people are discussing when referring to this surgery) is hardly used anymore . Large secondary scars are pretty non existent with new methods in this area, and the tissue source has altered to some degree alleviating the odor issue, although not any issue with excessive lubrication.  It also produces unparalleled depth in compared to inversion, which take it from me is an issue. I have what most people would consider amazing depth 7”+, and I still wish I had gotten something closer to 9, the standard 5” would be a nightmare. I would even consider having my canal redone with the newer colon methods myself, and almost kinda wish I went that route initially. Not to mention no potential for hair in the canal! I am not affected by this but I know tons of women who are, it’s very common (more so than people let on it understand). And even though I am not affected now, it does not mean I won’t be later as follicle development will happen overtime naturally, not an issue with colon methods.

I think very few people have gone this route, but Id also be interested in hearing people&#39;s experiences. Do we know why Ting stopped? I&#39;m pretty sure they pioneered the surgery for trans folx.

A little anecdotal evidence but one of my friends who recently got Penile inversion can get absolutely soaked from arousal.  So it&#39;s very much YMMV

So it looks like we are currently in the same boat. I&#39;ve realized that I will probably have to go out of the country for Sigma SRS. The posters above are right, they use a different part with the colon. So smell is now apparently rare, and if it does happen, it goes away with in few weeks. I&#39;ve been talking to one girl who went with Dr.Kaushik in New Delhi, India. She is very happy and has a great amount of depth. Depth is a huge thing for me too, also wetness/aesthetic. Monday I&#39;m going to see my GP and I&#39;m going to ask if possible to get an MRI or X-ray on my pelvis. I want to see how narrow my hips are, that can also determine how much depth you&#39;ll receive. The more narrow and less tissue, I believe the less depth(don&#39;t quote me though). I think it&#39;s something with having to do with the space, between the hips?  Peritoneal is a great method too, but so far no data has been received afterwards. Very few people from my knowledge have done it. I know Priyamed in Mumbai India offers it, but again still new. I&#39;m not totally sold on it yet.

I have heard a bit about the sigmoid colon but not as much on the peritoneal technique. But I have heard both have been know to be very self lubing, however I have heard that they do not have an off switch as in tied to arousal so it is constantly wet and many pads may be in order. I presume since the PT is of similar harvesting area as the SCM it would behave the same in terms of wetness just with out the removal of a colon, so less invasive.
</p>
<p>
I was reading on Susan&#39;s (I know) someone who had the colon method and their experience was that it was constant wetness and they said that they would concider it a last/back up option if anything was to go wrong with Inversion or non Inversion and not to get it as the first option for srs. Unfortunately I can not find the page it was on.
</p>
<p>
Just some things in you post that I think need to be adressed.
</p>
<p>
Lube was not invented for trans people. It helps cis women who have trubble with enough wetness and it can also help prevent condom tears. So using lube is not something specific to being trans.  Many cis women and circumsized penis weilders use lube or it wouldnt be on our shelves. If it was just the few post op trans women in each city buying it, production would slow dramatically.
</p>
<p>
Also sorry if I sound bad but you said that if vaginal reminds you of anal it may make you think why you had the surgery in the first place. If the only reason you want srs is so you don&#39;t have to have anal, maybe you should hold off as there are many more reasons that should be concidered before you get the surgery, e.g genital disphoria, the better fitting of clothes, no more erections/tissue pain, buldge social and relationships reasons and the list goes on....

Just fyi you can look up scientific studies on sigmoid colon for the vaginal canal on pubmed.
</p>
<p>
The cases of excessive wetness and mal odour are rare, they are the exception not the general rule.
</p>
<p>
The problem is the ones who currently do this technique kind of suck with the vagina aesthetics IMO.
</p>
<p>
I am like you and dont wsnt to dilate or have to use lube, I also care about the experience for my SO and want it to feel just as good as a cis one.
</p>
<p>
But life sucks for us and everything is harder.
</p>
<p>
I am booked to have SRS with suporn/bank for the aesthetics as they make the most cis looking vulvas of any doc I&#39;ve seen.
</p>
<p>
But I will revise it most likely with dr Kamol to get the sigmoid colon canal. So basically ima do this shit twice but like I said, everything is harder for people like us and I have to do what I got to do, you know?
</p>
<p>
Again you can look up dozens of studies on sigmoid canal used in trans women and cis women on pubmed and excessive discharge and malodor are very rare and especially the odor is due to hygiene issues, not the procedure itself.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps.

Yes it helps me, I was under the impression that it was more of a continuous thing just due to the nature of the tissue its self, I am just still unsure how it would know that it is not being used as a colon anymore and to start behaving like a vagina. Is douching nessary after the canal has settled in?
</p>
<p>
Is there any word on pH levels and flora with this method as I have heard quite good things about non Inversion in relation to this. It would however be nice not having to dialate all the time.
</p>
<p>
Would you get the full depth procedure and get the canal replaced or the no depth procedure and just add it in afterwards?

I know it&#39;s been 5 months but if you don&#39;t mind I was wondering why you chose that order. I would think the recovery and costs would be better if you got the the sigmoid colon first and then an aesthetic revision. Is there a reason to do it in the other order I&#39;m not aware of?

I&#39;ve been very curious about this method as well but it seems to be very uncommon and I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s not growing as a trend, there has to be a downside somewhere?

I think there are issues with thinness of the material and subsequently, tearing. But don&#39;t quote me on it.

Yeah, so much about it seemed promising but it doesn&#39;t seem to be growing more popular
