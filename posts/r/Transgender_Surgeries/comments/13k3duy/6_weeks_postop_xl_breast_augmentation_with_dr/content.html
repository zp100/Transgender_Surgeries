<strong>
TL;DR: I got some XXL implants with Dr. Revis, of South Florida Plastic Surgery Associates. I&#39;m leaving a detailed review because almost all of the previous reviews of his work seem to have been deleted. My experience with Revis was great, my results are fantastic,
<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741772721137909790/1108396368990588978/PXL_20230425_1807208962.jpg">really big implants don&#39;t look as big as you think they look
</a>
, and no, I don&#39;t have any back pain.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The full version
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve always had some pretty bad top dysphoria, and HRT gave me bupkiss. After two years of that, last September, I went in for a breast augmentation, going as large as I safely could. I chose Dr. Revis based on talks I&#39;d had with previous trans patients of his, who gave glowing reviews of him and his work, because I&#39;d always wanted to be busty, and because I&#39;m 5&#39;11&#34; and weigh about 225lbs. Because my dysphoria demanded that I be busty and because sizing is always about proportions, I knew I&#39;d need a larger set of implants than are typical for cis women, so I figured I&#39;d just go to someone who specialized in big implants, since he really wasn&#39;t that expensive. I wore large silicone breast forms for over a year before surgery, to be sure I&#39;d be comfortable with the size.
</p>
<p>
My first surgery went well. Dr. Revis was great with me being trans, and treated me in exactly the same way that I&#39;d expect him to treat a cis woman. The surgery itself happened in a nearby hospital with a fantastic staff, and that was a big selling point to me, because there were backups for everything, even the anesthesiologist had a backup, and if I&#39;m going in for surgery, I&#39;d really rather not do it in someone&#39;s clinic. Just a safety thing for me.
</p>
<p>
One thing you should know about Revis is that he moves quickly. Be ready to bring up the things you want to talk to him about. It&#39;s not that he&#39;s inattentive, it&#39;s that he does
<em>
so many
</em>
boob jobs that every single one of them is really routine for him, so he&#39;s liable to just sort of get on with things in his consults, both pre-op and post-op. He&#39;ll slow down and answer your questions to your heart&#39;s content, no problem--just be ready to ask them.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35fcdf90-b6e8-4f13-a63f-eeb0e668d7d0_1034x2048.jpeg">My first set of implants were 900cc&#39;s
</a>
, and if you look at that picture, you&#39;re probably a little surprised because they really don&#39;t look very big, do they? Like I said, I&#39;m tall and broad. German/Irish heritage. Curves are about proportionality, and knowing your body type, and meeting it, is huge. Also, I&#39;m gonna write up a thing on implant sizing after the review, so maybe check that out.
</p>
<p>
Recovery after the first op was pretty rough, because I went under the muscle. Revis prefers this in general, and if you&#39;re going larger than 600ccs, it really is the best way to go, because the pectoral muscle supports the breast implant better. Better support, better look, and no back pain. The hardest parts of recovery come from being under the muscle, because they need to carve up your pectoral muscle and modify it, then place an implant inside the freshly-operated-on capsule. That hurts. It took me about four weeks to get back to normal upper body functionality, and the hardest part of recovery was lateral reaching, which pulled on my new capsules and hurt.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, while the first implants were a huge improvement over being completely flat, I wasn&#39;t curvy. Certainly not busty. I realized pretty quickly that, while those implants
<em>
reduced
</em>
my dysphoria, they definitely did not
<em>
eliminate
</em>
it, so I scheduled a second augmentation. As the months wore on, my certainty that I needed more grew, from more episodes of dysphoria and disappointment with my looks.
</p>
<p>
The second operation was on April 7, about 7 months after the first. To the best of my ability to guess, I needed something like a 50% increase on the size of the implants to beat my dysphoria for good, but I&#39;d been through a lot of procedures in the last year and a half and, after doing some work in therapy, my therapist and I agreed that I wouldn&#39;t be disappointed by going bigger. Since it all cost the same and since I
<strong>
<em>
REALLY
</em>
</strong>
didn&#39;t want any more surgeries, I told Revis to just go as big as he could the second time around and still be safe with the results looking good. I also opted to get an internal bra for support.
</p>
<p>
We ended up a little more than doubling the size of the first implants.
<strong>
No, I do not have any back pain
</strong>
. Under the muscle implants plus an internal bra and even the most vague core workout pretty much precludes it. UTM implants don&#39;t pull on the back in the same way that natural breasts do.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the recovery the second time was much, much easier than the first time, because the main pain point from the first time--the freshly-created implant capsule--didn&#39;t need to be recreated, only stretched. I was completely pain-free two weeks after the surgery. I&#39;m very, very pleased with the appearance of my new boobs, and they&#39;re settling more and more by the week, so I expect them to look even better as time goes by. They&#39;re big enough, and I was flat enough, that I doubt they&#39;ll ever look fully natural, but that wasn&#39;t a particular priority for me, as I rather like the nicely-done augmented look. You can see how they look, clothed,
<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741772721137909790/1108396368990588978/PXL_20230425_1807208962.jpg">here
</a>
; I&#39;m not posting anything more revealing because every previous pic of Revis&#39; XL work on
<a href="/r/transgender_surgeries">/r/transgender_surgeries
</a>
has been pulled down, so I presume that creepy cis guys have been bothering people over them. I haven&#39;t had a whisper of dysphoria since, and I absolutely love the way my boobs look and feel.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I was pleased with Revis and his team in all respects. They went out of their way to make sure I was treated exactly as a cis woman would be (right down to pre-op pregnancy tests, hilariously), and I&#39;m very pleased with his results. By far the worst part is that his practice is in Florida, and Florida is horrid; assuming the terrible laws get rolled back, I&#39;d unhesitatingly recommend him to anyone who wants to be busty.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
A side note on big implants:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Big implants aren&#39;t as big as you think they are.
</p>
<p>
Most of what you&#39;ve seen for bigger B.A.s are on small, skinny cis women, and if you&#39;re neither small nor skinny, you&#39;re probably going to need larger implants than you think you do if you want to be curvy. More importantly, breast implants are governed by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">square-cube ratio
</a>
very aggressively, because spheres and hemispheres are
<em>
extremely
</em>
volumetrically efficient, and the degree to which they are efficient grows exponentially faster the larger they get. The effect of this is that, when you double the volume of an implant, its radius increases by only about 20%. To illustrate,
<a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F42adc538-783a-4962-94aa-93e4e73d3d16_764x130.png">a 450cc implant will project about 6cm from your chest
</a>
, while

<p>
If you&#39;re tall, broad, and/or not exactly skinny, you&#39;re probably going to need implants that are significantly larger than a cis woman of your general build to have the same look afterwards.

Congrats they look great.  I have 700 from Dr Revis and have a similar opinion of him.  His techniques are great, and his opinions are solid.  I really wish the FDA would stop dragging their feet and approve silicone larger than 800.  I&#39;ve been waiting like 5 years.  I&#39;m going to need to replace mine eventually and would ideally want at least 1000.   How much more was your revision than your first op?  I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s more because of the explant.

Thanks!
</p>
<p>
I know the FDA is trialing 1000cc silicone shells, but that&#39;s as big as they&#39;ll even consider right now; if 1000 is the floor for your revision, and if you have 700 now, my honest advice would be to go with saline (imo, they&#39;re great) and to go larger. Adding 300ccs to 700 is only going to add
<em>
maybe
</em>
another 8% of diameter to the projection you have now. Given the costs involved, it&#39;s a lot for not much extra boob, and you&#39;ve been waiting forever already. Live your life, and get your boob on!
</p>
<p>
My revision costs were about three grand more than my first BA, but almost all of that was actually the internal bra, not the implant exchange. There was a small fee for the swap, but it was like a couple hundred bucks at most--the increase in the cost of the facility fee was over twice that much (stupid inflation).

I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d be satisfied with 1000s.  I&#39;m for the most part satisfied with 700, but after a dozen years there&#39;s some tissue stretching.  So if I have to do a swap I&#39;d like a bit more perk.  I really like gummies, and there is less risk of a flat.  I don&#39;t ever want to be in a position where I have to fork over 10+ grand for an emergency implant change, and the risk of that goes up when you over pump them.

It does a little, but today&#39;s shells are not the same as shells from 10-15 years ago. They&#39;re so massively overbuilt these days that it&#39;s not even funny. If you search, you can see videos of surgeons overfilling a shell by ten times its rated volume just to show how absurdly tough they are. So, yes, technically the risk is higher... But not by a lot.
</p>
<p>
Besides, if you have a puncture/rupture with gummies, they still need to be swapped immediately, because the silicone is exposed to the body and cna be absorbed. The advantage of gummies is just that when the implants are removed, all of the silicone is removed; since they&#39;re not liquid, less has leeched out.

Gotta say, I absolutely love them (obviously). But the part I didn&#39;t expect was how negligible the weight is. Like, it&#39;s there. My balance is further forward. That feels amazing. But mostly they just vanish into my sensorium. People have to remind me that they&#39;re big sometimes.

Oh, also, the women I know have all been
<em>
overwhelmingly

supportive. The amount of sapphic panic I caused at my wife&#39;s last two roller derby bouts was amazing.

Thanks! I met one of Dr Revis&#39; other patients when considering my options before I did anything, and her pictures of herself with 800cc implants blew my mind for how unremarkable they looked. That kinda led me down a rabbit-hole, and the rest is history.

100%. There&#39;s a lot of presumption about what makes boobs big--for example, the bizarre idea that a DD is always big (for real, check out The Irish Bra Lady on Insta to dispel
<em>
that
</em>
nonsense)--and that really impacts taller or heavier or broader transfems.

First surgery was about $10k, second was $12.5K. Most of the difference was that I got an internal bra the second op. Insurance coverage helped some.

<a href="https://www.chongmd.com/understanding-the-internal-bra/">It is indeed

!

It doesn&#39;t replace the need for a bra, but it helps support them when, like, you&#39;re wearing a swimsuit or a strapless top or something, when a normal bra won&#39;t work. It&#39;s also nice for larger implants, just to reinforce the pectoral muscle, given the extra size.
