I do not get why he always needs some legs tissue for vaginoplasty, isn&#39;t the penile skin enough for him? Today someone asked me if Id recommend him, I personally do not know him but I do not like that he uses skin graft even when he has a nice penis shaft to work with

Thanks God you had a big friend, cause these past few weeks Ive read of girls whose scars in their thighs are quite uncomfortable!

He uses grafts from the peritoneal region. I got the additional graft but I have no scar on my thighs.

I am the same - and we even fought about the additional price he was charging as a &#39;just incase&#39; insurance. So I paid the extra fee and didn&#39;t end up having the skin graft. No refund..however I have no scars, 6 inches, cis-like minora..I can&#39;t complain.

I don’t actually know if he ever took the graft from me. I’ve got minimal depth due to a complication mid-surgery and I suspect he may have just scrapped the idea half way through surgery do to not needing it. I don’t know though.
</p>
<p>
He said I had one done though, because a specific part one side (near the crease between the groin and inner thigh) hurt way more than anything else, and I was still on the epidural. So who knows, but I can’t see any scarring at all, anywhere except the usual V shape scars from the actual vulva creation.

The only time he uses a graft is if there isn’t enough material to use. The most common type he uses is scrotal and in the event that there isn’t enough of that either then he’ll resort to use a skin graft from the groin.

Yeah, this past week I read of a girl who ended up with shitty depth (she called it like that herself) and he used graft so I do not know what happened there

That’s real unfortunately, oh well that’s a risk when it comes to surgery. I had my surgery with him and I have great results, I have 7 inches of depth and i’m also able to self lubricate.

Chettawut performs non-penile inversion, thus deconstructing the penile skin to create the labia minora and exterior
</p>
<p>
i was informed it was only the last option to take it from ones thighs? in my surgical papers he describes it as:
</p>
<p>
<em>
&#34;The lining of the vagina is made from a skin graft which can be taken from the scrotal skin and / or groin skin. &#34;
</em>
