Hello, we are compiling data on
<strong>
Dr Zukowski
</strong>
who has been developing a reputation for threatening his trans patients with legal action whenever they speak out against his abuses as seen
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/le1wqx/this_is_imo_how_dr_zukowski_has_created_an/">here
</a>
, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/18cm94r/ive_just_been_threatened_bydr_zukowski_with_legal/">here.
</a>
</p>
<p>
Who are &#34;we?&#34; exactly? We are &#34;The Butcher Busters&#34; we formed in response to another infamous surgeon: Dr. Kathy Rumer who witch hunted and terrorized her own patients with
<a href="https://www.outfrontmagazine.com/dr-kathy-rumer-accused-of-abusing-transgender-patients/">a right wing legal team.
</a>
The lack of legal advocacy on behalf of the two patients she sued and the overall problem of surgeons like Rumer and Zukowski never truly being held accountable by WPATH and the medical system at large is the reason why we exist.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Frjxwmeoui5l91.jpg">Rumer previously used to hold a stranglehold of fear over the community from other surgeons who were terrified to speak out against her and ended up deleting their own social media pages as a result.
</a>
And even
<a href="https://jezebel.com/when-surgeons-fail-their-trans-patients-1844774990">journalists.
</a>
</p>
<p>
We launched a
<a href="https://www.change.org/p/kathy-rumer-must-resign">petition
</a>
which accumulated over 800+ signatures which we used to blacklist Rumer from any reputable clinic and establishment. We did on the ground outreach in Philly and distributed flyers in queer spaces to warn against Dr. Rumer&#39;s practice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
We are now setting our sights on Dr. Zukowski.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We are hereby asking people to submit their Dr. Zukowski horror stories of his unprofessional conduct, Just send us a DM here on reddit. We have members who are overseas and outside of the reach of this guy&#39;s litigation so you don&#39;t need to worry about us. The more info the better and the sooner we can begin direct action against his practice. We need to send a clear message to these &#34;wild west surgeons&#34; that you can&#39;t punch down upon the community you pretend to serve.
</p>
<h1>
We also need the last name of this man. &#34;Cole&#34; He is responsible for sending out
<a href="https://i.postimg.cc/66xsbX7S/zukowskiemail.jpg">legal threats
</a>
on Zukowski&#39;s behalf, its not listed anywhere and somebody has to know it.
