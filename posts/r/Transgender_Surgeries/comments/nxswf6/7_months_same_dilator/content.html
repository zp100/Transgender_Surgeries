<p>
I&#39;m coming here for help, and ideas, as I don&#39;t have any more, and neither does my surgeon or GYN on what to do.
</p>
<p>
So the story: Had penile inversion style surgery in early November 2020 and right after surgery I was using the #2 (petite orange dilator) at first. After a month or two at 3 times a day, it got tighter, and more painful. I was advised to start with a smaller dilator first and move on to the #2.
</p>
<p>
3 months in I was past most of the post surgical secretions and messy whatever stuff, but still had a lot of yellow discharge, and the pain was still very bad, like sitting was still pretty awful and I need to lay down a lot. The surgeon thought I had an infection and prescribed Metronidazole vaginal gel to treat it, two weeks of that and my discharge maybe went down but it was definitely still there, and the surgeon suggested I go to a GYN and get swabbed to see what it was exactly. At this point I was only able to use the #1 (petite purple) dilator.
</p>
<p>
GYN takes a look, swabs but suggests the tissue looks like gingivitis and doesn&#39;t believe I have an infection just that it wasn&#39;t healing, and prescribed hydrocortisone ointment 2.5% (a steroid cream) to kickstart the healing. Omg it actually helped a ton! The pain was gone in a couple days and I was doing good! After a week the swabs came back with nothing confirming no more infection and I thought I was done.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately 12 hours after stopping the steroid the pain was back. So the gym suggested I needed more time on it, 3 more weeks go by and I&#39;m told to stop and come get another look. The GYN does a exam and says that it looks much better and healthy and as it should, and commented that it was almost to small for her to actually get in there to exam. But hey the pain was gone it looked good and yeah!
</p>
<p>
Lol nope, next day pain was back and it was tighter then ever.
</p>
<p>
I plead with the GYN to let me keep taking it but im told that extended use of the steroid will make the skin thinner and eventually puncture and fall apart, which my surgeon seconds and yeah that sounds worse..
</p>
<p>
Okay next thing to try, change lube, change soap to douche with. Well soap didn&#39;t seem to matter but changing lube has helped lower the pain a bit, I was using a whatever water based medical style lube which was causing some irritation. I have since tried a silicone based lube as well as slippery stuff and both seem to be better and less irritating.
</p>
<p>
But the pain isn&#39;t gone, and I&#39;m not making any progress dilating two times a day for about 30 to 45 minutes each. (It takes 15 minutes to get to depth, then I hold it for as long as I can stand)
</p>
<p>
At this point the thought is that dilating itself is causing the irritation which makes it swell up and get tighter.
</p>
<p>
Surgeon then prescribed Premarin cream a couple times a week which they suggested would soften the tissue and ease the pain, as well as hopefully make it easier to start getting width going, (still on the smallest purple pitite one) and to give it 6 weeks for it to start working, well 6 weeks of that later and nothing has changed, in fact the time I dilate after using it, I could swear it felt tighter and was harder to get in.
</p>
<p>
Okay well surgeon has one last idea, to try a drug called imvexxy, which is a vaginal insert which has a similar concept to the Premarin cream, but is a slower dose and activates slower, they said to use it for 3 months dilating 3 times a day and then check back in.
</p>
<p>
This brings me to today, and I&#39;ve just started using imvexxy and trying to dilate 3 times a day, which is very hard on my work and personal life as well as seems to make it harder to dilate in general (which lends to the idea that dilating itself is causing the swelling and irritation).
</p>
<p>
I do want to mention depth hasn&#39;t really been an issue, and my depth has stayed the same since post op.
</p>
<p>
Tldr, my vagina is tiny and nothing has worked over the past half a year.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the long text but hopefully it will help people find help or ideas if they are having similar concerns.
</p>
<p>
Now what: Any ideas? Any techniques? Any suggestions on other drugs? Lube? Soap? Should I give up? Is there any hope? Has anyone had this hard of a time and managed to get their way out of it?
</p>
<p>
It feels utterly hopeless, that the hours and hours and pain I&#39;ve gone through these past months to have a vagina that I can&#39;t get a single pointer finger in without dilating for 15minutes seems like how am I ever going to get to even a size that is somewhat usable? I have literally nothing to go on, since I&#39;ve never had improvement except for the steroid (which allowed me to start using the orange petite dilator again, until I stopped the steroid) so I can&#39;t even math my way to and end point.
</p>
<p>
Please, if anyone has any ideas or suggestions on things to try I&#39;m all ears and ready to try them.
</p>
<p>
Also I&#39;m going to wait on discussing who my surgeon was because I don&#39;t think this was their fault really just my body fighting me, and I want to do a full report and story once I hopefully am at a better spot so I can do a full report with a clear head.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for reading &lt;3

Could it be that your pelvic muscles are struggling to relax and adjust? If so pelvic floor physical therapy may help, it might be worth discussing it with your surgeon.

That&#39;s possible as if I excercised somewhat recently before dilating it appears to be tighter. I will ask about it! Thank you!

Im so sorry you are dealing with this... what about a lube with lidocaine or some kind of numbing lube(there are lubes like this) i think that will male dilating less painful.
</p>
<p>
Can you discuss with your surgeon a surgery to gain width? They might be able to do something while you are under to give you width, but im not sure
</p>
<p>
Third option, having your canal replaced with ppt or colon? Honestly they are great options!

I&#39;ve considered numbing lube but it kinda feels like going around the issue at hand or I guess a bandaid on a broken bone, might be worth a shot though, at least to make the meantime easer! As for a second surgery, it has crossed my mind plenty, my surgeon said they would be willing to operate again after a year post op, but said there is no guarantee the same thing is going to happen again, which to me seems like it wouldn&#39;t be worth it. Instead if nothing works I&#39;ll try and get on a list for a colon revision. And hope that works. Thanks for the suggestions and feedback!

So sorry youâ€™re going through such an awful time :-( The one thing from your post that stood out to me was that youâ€™re douching with soap??? Iâ€™ve never heard of that. Post op I used a vinegar/water solution (now rarely if ever do). Did your surgeon recommend that? It sound very harsh!

I was instructed to use soap, I now use Cetaphil, as it is as least irritating soap as soap goes, surgeon says these days I don&#39;t need to douche often, just before I put in an imvexxy for now.

I donâ€™t wanna argue with your surgeon but that doesnâ€™t seem great tbh. Iâ€™ve also never heard of trans women using vaginal estradiol before. Was there a reason for switching? Do you think that could be part of your issue?

As for the soap, I honestly thought that was standard, I&#39;m surprised to hear that it isn&#39;t. My instinct tells me that the soap is unrelated, but who knows maybe it is, what is the standard? Just water? As for the vaginal estrogen drugs, my GYN was skeptical that it would do anything but didn&#39;t have a better idea. As well I&#39;ve heard of it being used here and there once or twice, but I&#39;ve never seen imvexxy mentioned, but I believe it&#39;s a relatively new drug.

Like I said, I used 50/50 water and vinegar for a few months after surgery and then reduced frequency and concentration (more water/less vinegar). Now I literally do it once every few months if that. Maybe some other women can chime in with what they use but any kind of soap (even cetaphil which I have used externally) seem likely to be irritating.
</p>
<p>
As for the vaginal estradiol, maybe ask a question in
<a href="/r/drwillpowers" rel="nofollow">r/drwillpowers
</a>
. Heâ€™s the guru of trans hormone therapy and might have some insight. Certainly worth switching to a different method like patch or injection to rule it out as a cause

Sorry for the confusion, my actual estrogen dose is via a patch, the vaginal estrogens is in a very small dose just meant to be absorbed by the tissue in there, not really sure how it works though.

I guess itâ€™s a case of ruling out things that are causing the irritation and inflammation one by one. You could also try applying some lube that contains lidocaine before you insert the dilator? Lastly if you havenâ€™t already Iâ€™d strongly suggest looking into pelvic floor therapy. That helped me quite a bit in the early days

Hey there, congrats on surgery! Iâ€™m more familiar with ftm surgical recovery, but I know in any surgical situation, it can take around a year for scar and tight tissue to relax. How quickly did your surgeon recommend increasing dilator size? It definitely sounded like in the beginning you did need more time to heal, and I could imagine that trying to stretch that tissue so soon could cause irritation.  Wish you the best!
