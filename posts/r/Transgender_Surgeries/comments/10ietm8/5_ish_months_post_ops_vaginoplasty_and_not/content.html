My gyno said the scars would fade overtime and the skin would become lighter in colour over time, which I’m not worried about.
</p>
<p>
I am very happy with it when I’m standing up straight. I know literally every girl alive is probably self conscious about how her vagina looks, I’m just worried about… I don’t even know, the labia minora I guess? There doesn’t really feel like there is a labia minora.
</p>
<p>
I have some hypergranulation which is being treated with silver nitrate which probably isn’t helping.
</p>
<p>
Other than that it functions like a vagina and I don’t regret my decision for surgery
</p>
<p>
Edit: surgeon was dr brassard in Montreal

See if you can get a labia revision. It sucks that they couldnt make it more prominent the first time round because youve healed nicer than Ive seen 90% of people heal at 5 months. As in your scars will be pretty much invisible given time.
</p>
<p>
Im very confident a surgeon who specializes in revisions could give you exactly what you want considering you have next to no scar material.

Definitely echoing that~ it looks good, but getting an additional labiaplasty in the future may be something you&#39;d want to look into in the future if you&#39;re concerned about it

Hi, I am no expert but your scars healed nicely. I agree that more labia minora would add esthetically. I am 3 1/2 months post op and I think I have too much labia minora. (I posted some pictures on Reddit) I will give it more time. The question for me, will be more from a health and feel perspective. If that’s ok I don’t know that it matters but it’s an individual choice.

I think she looks great, each technique and the outcome whether visible labial flaps has there benefits and drawback and you sound like you have a realistic understanding of what is possible.. Personally i have come to accept the fact that being circumcised it is less likely that i could get the labia with the limited tissue i have available and when it comes down to it i would prefer to have prominent labia myself but it&#39;s not a perfect world and some of are more more privileged than others.
</p>
<p>
I would be happy enough to have the results you got

Honey, I want a vagina so, so, bad.  It would complete me.  But my chances are slim to none. First, I&#39;m 74 years old, second, I only have minimum health benifits. Be thankful that you got it done. Sweetie, It Looks Fantastic BTW!.
