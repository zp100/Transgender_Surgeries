It already looks good, and judging from the post revision pictures I have seen (admittedly only 2) of Suporn&#39;s work it will be incredible after revision.

Looks great. Nice to see how much the swelling has come down. I had mine done by Suporn about 1 month before yours. I was probably leaving the hotel around the time of your surgery. Definitely we have the Suporn-Banks signature look‚Ä¶ meaning, they look great! üí™üèª

I walked a little bit too much the first week after leaving the hospital‚Ä¶ payed the price ü§£. Was grounded in my room for the next 2 1/2 weeks. I wish I could have socialized more. We probably have met on the discord

Overall I think the total cost was around $17,000 of the top of my head? I mean it definitely hurt but it was mostly manageable. Dilating in the early stages is absolutely brutal but it‚Äôs just one day at a time and it was ok.

2 more months until mine, and really can‚Äôt wait after seeing results like these!! Really like how the labia minora end up looking with their technique after the swelling comes down

Roughly a million years???? Seriously though I was able to go down a bit faster than average. I dilated 3 times a day for two months and then twice a day till like 4 months and I‚Äôve been at once a day since then.

Oh wow this gives me so much hope! I am hoping to go with Bank when the time comes but it&#39;s a way off yet.
</p>
<p>
May I ask if you had hair removal beforehand or did the technique live up to the promise of removing it all?
</p>
<p>
Also regarding dilating I&#39;m freaking out about the schedule you&#39;re describing, at what point is going back to work manageable? 2 months off work is going to be a tough sell for me and it sounds like I can&#39;t nip to the loo and dilate over lunch?
</p>
<p>
Anyways sooooo happy for you, congrats! üíñ

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do great with Banks when the time comes! I have full confidence in the clinic.
</p>
<p>
I did not have hair removal before surgery and it has worked out totally fine but I do have a few hairs around the entrance that I pluck and will probably get electro on. Honestly for me I was just not emotionally in a place to get electrolysis before surgery and I‚Äôm grateful it wasn‚Äôt required but I feel very open to it now. I don‚Äôt have any hairs in places they can‚Äôt be removed with this technique.
</p>
<p>
Not going to lie dilation in the beginning is brutal but I think going back to an office job at two months is very doable provided you have flexibility to dilate during the day or have a flexible schedule. When I was at three times a day I would dilate at like 7am, 4pm, and 10pm roughly.

This first week has been hard &gt;&lt; how long did it take before the swelling went down and you stopped feeling too sore/raw?

I would say that swelling goes down some during the first 4 weeks but it really takes 3 months at least to start feeling a little bit better. My second month was the hardest, and the third and fourth were the worst in terms of wound contraction. At seven months I still have maybe 25% swelling and it is getting better really slowly. Pain is mostly gone (and was gone by 6 months), can still be uncomfortable at times, but it is no longer painful. recovery is a 1 year affair. Keep in mind that recovery times vary from girl to girl, so take every comment and photo as a grain of salt and do not compare yourself to others. As far as I know, everybody eventually gets to feel better.

How is general sensitivity at 6 months? You look great and they seem to be very consistent in terms of aesthetics, but I‚Äôm curious how long sensitivity takes to develop. Also, how much time a day are you currently dilating? I know that their procedure requires an insane amount of dilating up front but not sure hat the regime is for you right now.

I‚Äôm not numb anywhere that I‚Äôve been able to find yet! It probably took around 2 months for sensation to fully return to my clit which was a little nerve wracking but it all worked out. Everything else was sensitive as soon as the bandages came off.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm dilating once a day now but I started at 3 times a day until two months and then went down to once a day at 4 months. On average my dilations take about 1-1.5 hours with prep and cleanup.

Thanks so much for the answer, this is really helpful! One more follow up question. When you dilate, is it a focused process mentally/physically? or can you watch tv/read/do some things?  Do you need to be in a specific position the whole time? and lastly is it a painful process?

Yeah! So these days it can actually be kind of nice to just have an hour to myself to watch tv and chill while I dilate haha but in the beginning it was definitely something that required a lot of mental effort just to get through the pain. I could only listen to calm music or podcasts where the hosts had slow soft voices. That was really only for the first few weeks though. You do have to be laying down at like a 45 degree angle with your legs straight. As far as pain like I said it was pretty incredibly painful early on. After the first month and up until like ~3 months it was painful but manageable with pain killers. Now it‚Äôs mostly but not completely pain free except for like every 15th session where my body decides to turn on me haha.

Are you able to have orgasm with clitoris? And is there any pain with penetration or do you feel pleasure from it ?

I was scheduled for Dr Suporn but unfortunately he&#39;s been very ill and has now retired. I&#39;m now scheduled with Dr Banks and although he&#39;s good, I&#39;m not sure if the asthetics are quite the same as Suporn&#39;s. I&#39;m not saying that he&#39;s not as good, but it&#39;s very much a matter of personal taste I guess. Bank does the bigger puffier outer labia. Suporn&#39;s results seemed to be flatter on the outside. Unless if course there is still a lot of swelling on the Dr Bank photos? I&#39;m still unsure what to do about going ahead or not x

I‚Äôm 24! Not sure if it effected the results or not, but as far as recovery went it didn‚Äôt seem to be a large factor in speed or severity with the people I was around in Thailand.
