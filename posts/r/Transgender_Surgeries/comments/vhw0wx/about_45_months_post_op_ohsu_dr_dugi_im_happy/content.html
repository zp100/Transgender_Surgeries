Can I ask how youâ€™re experience was overall?  I have a assessment for vulvoplasty with OHSU coming up soon.  How long of a wait was there between the consult and surgery?

I had a great experience with all the staff. I liked Dugi, he was pretty warm if reserved and he answered all my questions thoroughly. The nurses in my aftercare were amazing. Some stood out, but they were all really sweet.
</p>
<p>
I suspect I got lucky with scheduling. I had full depth, but they told me that when I had my consult was that had I already had all of my necessary hair removal they&#39;d have been able to schedule me. That may or may not be the case. They can only schedule 3 months out, which is a huge bummer. Mine got canceled once due to some covid emergencies. I was persistent and super nice to the scheduler to get back on it.
</p>
<p>
I consulted December. Finished my hair removal a year later and then had my surgery within 3 months.

Can I ask how much depth do you have and how the dilation is going for you?

About 6.25 inches, and I&#39;ve been consistently using the larger orange dilator. I forget the girth of it but it&#39;s the optional 5th one. It&#39;s been a chore the last month or so but I&#39;m getting through it. It&#39;s easy to do but it takes so much time. I&#39;m excited to eventually be at once week.

Sorry if this is too personal, but are you able to get wet? Its been my biggest misgiving about choosing the penile inversion technique instead of one of the other methods.

I need lube for sex, but I know a lot of cis women who do too. Ppt is likely the better option if you&#39;re hoping for lubrication, but even then you&#39;re likely to need some lube. It&#39;s less of an issue than you might think.

I have surgery with Dugi in October, I&#39;m very nervous about the outcome and complications, so thank you for posting your results.  Overall, has sex met your expectations in terms of feeling?  Have you been able to climax?
</p>
<p>
Your results look great!  I&#39;m assuming there is still a decent amount of swelling there?  How are you doing getting around?

I think he and the entire team are great. I had an absolutely lovely experience.
</p>
<p>
Sensation has been incredible. I feel I should provide some context though as well, climax has never been easy for me to achieve. It got a lot harder about a year into my transition. Before srs I could likely count on one hand for the past two years.
</p>
<p>
What I will say is that self exploration feels much more right. I don&#39;t often have a defined end point or a climax per say, but I can really build up some amazing feelings. For me it&#39;s pretty much night and day. I&#39;m just lost in sensation and feeling it everywhere in my body. I&#39;m not distracted in the way I used to be.
</p>
<p>
I orgasmed for the first time about 10 weeks after. I&#39;m still figuring out what works for me, but it&#39;s night and day for me. I&#39;m always enjoying myself and even if climax doesn&#39;t happen it doesn&#39;t feel so far away. My clit was a little too sensitive initially, but it&#39;s getting much much nicer. I have zero regrets about going with Dugi.
</p>
<p>
His staff does a great job laying out expectations which reeeeeally helped me have a good mindset through recovery. One thing I&#39;d definitely try to keep in mind is that fear and pain in recovery are powerful and will make you believe the worst. Don&#39;t trust your thoughts in those moments. You will be fine and if things are too painful call them. Take your pain meds. Use the opiates if you need them. I was scared of them because of some family history. However, these drugs have an intended purpose, your pain should be managed so that your emotional energy can be put towards recovering.
</p>
<p>
Also very happy to answer more questions and or ramble at you if you&#39;d just like to hear more.
