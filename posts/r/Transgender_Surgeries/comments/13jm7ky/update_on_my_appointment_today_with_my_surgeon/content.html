Update on my appointment today with my surgeon, Dr.Johnathan Keith. When I expressed my concern about my vagina being 3 inches he said cis vaginas are an average of 3.5 -5 inches and can stretch. When I told him mine doesn‚Äôt he cut me off.

Neovaginas have almost no stretch so yes they have to be bigger than natal.  If under 4-5 inches it‚Äôs very difficult to have straight sex.
</p>
<p>
You could always try to find a gynecologist that‚Äôs not associated with the surgeon to have them check if there‚Äôs excessive scar tissue, that‚Äôs a common reason why people lose depth after 2-3 months. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do if they tried to gaslight me a complication is normal

Hi love, I‚Äôve been following your posts for a bit and I really don‚Äôt have much of an antidote for your depth issues other than looking for a revision with another doctor. HOWEVER, I too am a Dr. Keith patient. He did my BA and while I told him I wanted a specific size and profile, he didn‚Äôt follow what I wanted and now I‚Äôm left with implants that are way too big and are now bottoming out.
</p>
<p>
He asked about a revision but i honestly would rather go to another surgeon. It seems like he just wanted a quick cash grab with my insurance plan. Also, I‚Äôve noticed he tends to be a bit aggressive and condescending not only towards certain patients but to his staff. I could go on about him and his team, but just want you to know that you‚Äôre not alone and he needs to be more mindful of his patients. Again, not the help you‚Äôre looking for here but just wanted to share this w you. Sending hugs!
</p>

I understand your upset but there&#39;s no need to be toxic to people trying to help. What&#39;s going on with your vagina isn&#39;t right, and I&#39;m sorry for that. I recommend you go with a different doctor that can do a revision or something. I wish you the best, but remember that being rude will not help improve your situation.

i can tell you that my natal vagina is only as long as my middle finger, 3.5 inches. it does stretch but it hurts. large sized men are not my ideal partners or i opt for anal if there&#39;s any considerable length. too deep makes me bleed, vomit, pass out. i&#39;m not the only afab that has this experience and sure it isnt ideal but that doesnt mean its not normal to some degree....,
</p>
<p>
i understand your doc is being somewhat insensitive but what he&#39;s saying isn&#39;t factually wrong. i think you need to keep doing what you&#39;re doing and give it time. it seems like you want to be very upset at your surgeon more than you want to work on fixing your issues, if that makes sense? reading your post history a lot of ppl including your doc have given you some good advice so just stick with it and im sure things will get better over time üëç
</p>
<p>
edit: im autistic and kinda stupid at wording stuff so i wanna be clear, it&#39;s okay if you disagree with me, your surgical team, and everyone who has given you really good advice historically that i saw- most of which said to seek a second opinion/revision which is what i was implying you should keep at- but i dont condone being misgendered or being hostile to me. i think there is hope in the situation, and if that warrants downvotes i really am sorry for being offensive, but seriously.., ?

You have absolutely no conceptualization of the amount of pain and terror I‚Äôve gone through these last 15 months. For you to say what you‚Äôre saying is pretty damn insensitive. Imagine your vagina rapidly shrinking and people telling you oh that‚Äôs just normal. You have no conceptualization of this at all.
</p>
<p>
And yes I am following directions. I have been since the start.
</p>
<p>
And all I‚Äôm starting are facts. Documenting what‚Äôs going on so people know.
</p>
<p>
I wasn‚Äôt properly informed about my care and it caused complications. I am furious because those may be for the rest of my life

surgeries go wrong or have complications all the time. you have no idea what i&#39;ve gone thru in my life to make assumptions like that. i&#39;ve had medical procedures go wrong involving my genitals specifically that made me go into shock, damaged me, and that gave me ptsd. it&#39;s not a competition.

No what I‚Äôm getting at is that you‚Äôre a cis woman. Just go away. I‚Äôm in just about the worst place in my life and you‚Äôre just making it worse.

If you don&#39;t get colon/jejenum then yeah there isn&#39;t alott of stretch sadly. If canal is your only problem why not just get a revision at some point with either peritoneal or one of the above? it sound like you can still get off well and that the issue is piv sex. I mean for the meantime why not try anal until you can get more depth ? it sounds like hyperfixating on it is causing you intense mental damage.

hey i get it, trans healthcare is a joke in the US. Ive been helping ppl at my uni fight the draconian healthcare policies the admin put in place (which essentially limits trans students access to knowledgeable/trained providers) and honestly I&#39;ve heard so many stories of malpractice and halfassed care it sickens me etc. Hopefully one day the future will look back at this period as a shameful dark age. Idk. it gives me some solace

I think Dr. Keith does penile inversion?  If so, lack of depth is well documented and long known as a potential weakness of this approach.   From what you are writing I do not think he is gas lighting you.  Nor do I think it sounds like he is giving you particularly poor care.   Rather, outcomes can vary with this method and you were unfortunate in losing depth.   I don‚Äôt think there is anything that he did wrong via carelessness or indifference.  I think Dr. keith has not be doing this all that long and your case may be challenging for  his level of training and experience.
</p>
<p>
To recover depth now, your best bet is to get 100% healed and keep working with the therapist.  Even the psych drugs might be a good way to help you deal with your situation.  Think positively because your problem is not novel and the long term solution is likely going to be a graft of some sort and there are strengths and weaknesses to each approach.  If I was young, I would consider going to Thailand for Dr. Sutin or Theerapong both of whom seem to get consistent good results.  In the US, Dr.RBL, Min Jun or Stiller are experienced in this kind of procedure.  You have options and potential ways forward.   Fortunately Dr. Keith did an otherwise competent job and did not leave you with a mess that will not heal like a few other docs.  So try and keep your head up and move forward. Hugs.

I really hope that‚Äôs true. I wasn‚Äôt warned about this happening on the consult, he made it sound like I was going to walk out of there and be perfectly recovered after six weeks, maybe just everything went wrong. If I am blaming him too much I‚Äôm going to delete all my posts and probably just feel like shit about it too, But as it stands I‚Äôm still on the fence.

Well, I think it‚Äôs kind of a wash on them warning us: they don‚Äôt go into enough detail and we don‚Äôt listen.  Bitd (I am old,lol) most of us just expected to do two steps of surgery.  Dr. Menard/Brassard really popularized the single step srs.  I wonder if it is not time to reconsider that method.

I‚Äôm sorry but I think that‚Äôs completely unfair. I took detailed notes before and after my consult, hung onto every word he said, my therapist made sure I do that. Because I wanted to know exactly the consequences of making permanent changes to my body. Before my consult I was prepared to have a rough journey with a major surgery. After my consult I actually thought this was a minor surgery with minimal risks. My therapist even noticed the change in my perspective on the surgery abd tried to warn me, same with some of my support system. But I believed him because he‚Äôs a surgeon.

Sry for getting angry at you yesterday when you were just trying to express a different perspective. Im not well right now and Im having difficulty expressing myself without my emotions just completely taking over. I agree with you on that after doing sone reading.
</p>
<p>
complications from this caused me a lot of psychological and physical damage I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to recover from. I wasn‚Äôt exactly all there when I went into this.
