I&#39;ve had surgery like 2 months ago with Dr. Taskov too &amp; had the same issues with one side of the labia minora being much more swollen. Symmetrywise it evened out by time, tho one side is still a little bigger. With you, it seems that the swollen one in the lower part is not fully stiched up to the rest of the skin tho, creating a litte bit the impression of &#34;hanging out there&#34;. But that could be easily fixed in a second surgery i assume, if it bothers you.

Besides that i think your Vulva already looks really pretty &amp; you have the biggest respect from me for posting regular updates of your healing! x
