Three years post op from Avanessian, and I really wish I went to NYU or somewhere else altogether. I deal with longterm post op issues that Avanessian essentially washed her hands of. NYU has more variety in technique, and advanced technology. Their facilities are WAY better than Mount Sinai’s, I know the wait is longer but it’s for a reason.

Can I ask what issues you’re having? I’m five months post op from Avanessian and had only ever heard great things about her until your post.

She left too much urethral tissue around my urethra, which lead to me developing a lot of scar tissue that took extensive physical therapy (and an eventual revision) to solve. My pee doesn’t ever stream straight, I have trouble consistently urinating, and it engorges a ton when I’m aroused which is not pleasant.  She also advised me against hair removal, or more so said it was unnecessary in my case and we could go ahead and schedule surgery and told me there wouldn’t likely to be any internal hair - well she was wrong. There’s a lot. I was a dumb teenager, and I shouldn’t have taken her advice. She also never took responsibility for saying that, despite there being e-mail evidence of her saying exactly that - as I was concerned about internal hair and followed up with several messages asking about it prior to my surgery. Whatever.
</p>
<p>
She also gave me the impression she constructs labia minora with her technique, however I don’t have any labia minora and when I asked her about this she told me they construct the illusion of labia minora when the legs are closed but not the tissue itself which again contradicted yet another thing she said to me pre-operatively. My clitoris is also way too large, which leads to a lot of over sensitivity that’s unpleasant - she literally just took the head of my penis and resewed it in place it seems like. The aesthetics of my result aren’t great, and she doesn’t have enough experience with revisions for me to feel comfortable going back.
</p>
<p>
In fairness, I went to her in 2018 when she was new and had no reviews, and my experience was tougher than many I read about, but a part of me does feel she embellished aspects to gain her own patient load. It’s possible she’s learned quite a bit more now, and has better consistency, but when I went back in 2021 for my revision consultation I just left feeling like I had a really unpleasant experience, felt like she wasn’t listening to me in the way I needed. Anyways, hope that clarifies it sorry about the word walls.

I’m in the same boat so I am curious what others have to say.

I couldn’t agree with this comment more! Every surgeon that has trained under a specific surgeon will have slight variations as to how they set up their vulvas despite it being the same peritoneal flap vaginoplasty. For instance, Dr. Jun has a bit of different way in which he uses the urethral tissue and the structure of the clitoris and definition of the labia minoras than RBL, where as RBL/Zhao have more definition of the Labia Majorias and depending on the patient, have a more defined labia minora. A lot of people will prefer Jun over RBL/Zhao or vise-versa when it comes down to the nitty gritty of aesthetics but the main point is that they are well trained, very skilled, and very high quality work!
</p>
<p>
Also, NYU Langone without a doubt over Mt. Sinai! I couldn’t speak more highly about my time and experience with NYU and their attention and efficiency (during the consultation) which in the long term is so important for patients going through a very rigorous surgery; yeah the wait is longer but everyone says it’s worth and it is worth it. Personally you won’t find a better team and set of compassionate providers than NYU Langone in my opinion. However, there are other great options like Min Jun, Dr. Dy from OHSU and as of recent there was HC Denver with Dr. Kaoutzanis and Haguchi who did great work on one of the girls; all trained by Bluebond-Langner/Zhao!

I signed up with Mt Sinai, before switching to NYU.
</p>
<p>
As an RN, the organized approach NYU is taking, as well that they try to discharge you without a urinary catheter, gives me a lot of confidence in NYU.

Mt. Sinai is a total pain in the ass to deal with as far as answering phones, scheduling, changes to scheduling, and mistakes made in scheduling (like you show up to another building for a COVID test and they have no record sent over). Facilities could be better also. Proximity is convenient for me, but I don&#39;t really have any interest in ever dealing with them ever again. They do not make things seemless.
