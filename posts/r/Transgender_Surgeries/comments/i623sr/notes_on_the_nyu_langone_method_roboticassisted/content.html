I&#39;m going for vaginoplasty at NYU Langone in September. I&#39;m doing their robotic-assisted peritoneal vaginoplasty, which they refer to in published research as
<strong>
<em>
Robotic-Assisted Peritoneal Flap Gender Affirming Vaginoplasty
</em>
</strong>
<strong>
<em>
(RPGAV)
</em>
</strong>
. On Reddit and elsewhere on the internet, people refer to this as Peritoneal Pull-Through Vaginoplasty (or simply, PPT).
</p>
<p>
<em>
aside:
</em>
I work in an office where I come into contact with a lot of Microsoft Powerpoint files, and every time I see the &#34;.ppt&#34; file extension I think of peritoneal pull-through... so yeah, I&#39;d be happy to get a new acronym for that, lol. I digress...
</p>
<p>
At NYU Langone, Dr. Bluebond-Langner is the plastic surgeon, and Dr. Zhao is the urological surgeon. I think this may be a bit of a reductive description, but it seems like Dr. Zhao is in charge of most of the &#34;inside&#34; work, and Dr. Bluebond-Langner is in charge of the &#34;outside&#34; work. And from the results I&#39;ve been able to find online, they&#39;re like,,,,, really good at this :o
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d commented on a previous thread about this method, but I was wrong about a few important things. I&#39;m trying to collect all of this information in one place. Hopefully it&#39;s useful for others who are interested! I&#39;ve included selections from my past comment in italicized block quotes. The other text is my updated commentary/notes.
</p>
<p>
----------
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>
A lot of people talk about peritoneal tissue being great because it produces lubrication. But when I asked the surgical team about this (Dr. Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Zhao) they emphasized that this should NOT be expected.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
I’ve also read other people who had PPT say that they lubricate too much, to the point that they don’t consider it “lubrication”, but rather discharge (I believe this was an account by a patient of Dr. Jess Ting, but I cannot remember when/where I saw this). I think this may be more common in full PPT: where the entire canal is made from peritoneal tissue. More peritoneal tissue = more secretion.
</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/bq4gb8/peritoneal_gcs/content.html">the thread</a>
where I read about issues with PPT. A number of people were saying it&#39;s not a good method, that Ting had stopped doing it, etc. But it&#39;s very much second- and third-hand commentary. I would take the published science a lot more seriously than anecdotal information.
</p>
<p>
And in regards to the &#34;lubrication&#34; question -- when I asked Dr. Bluebond-Langner about this she was very quick to dismiss it as way, way over-hyped.
</p>
<p>
My takeaway: You should go into surgery expecting zero self-lubrication. If you do end up with a bit, great! But you should not anticipate it.
</p>
<p>
----------
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>
From reading a paper that NYU Langone’s team published about the technique, it sounds like the PRIMARY benefit is that peritoneal tissue is different from skin graft tissue and adheres better to the back of where the canal is placed. This means that it has a lower rate of fistula occurring (which is a rare, but relatively more common occurrence with non-peritoneal tissue).
</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, turns out it wasn&#39;t a paper, it was an abstract (a.k.a. the summary of information that would be included in the full paper). And, I also misrepresented their own description of the benefits of the procedure.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/full/10.1097/JU.0000000000000107">Here&#39;s a link to that abstract.</a>
-- from September 2018, involving a cohort of 20 trans women.
</p>
<p>
They actually don&#39;t mention the enhanced adherence. I believe this is something that was mentioned in the consultation, but I confused my info sources -- from my understanding, the peritoneal tissue acts as a better &#34;anchor&#34; for the back of the canal than the typical penile inversion graft does.
</p>
<p>
The primary benefits that they emphasize in the abstract are
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
the increased depth
</strong>
(~5cm additional depth)
</li>
<li>
<strong>
the peritoneal tissue is well-vascularized
</strong>
(i.e. it has better access to blood flow), especially in comparison to what they refer to as &#34;extra-genital&#34; skin graft. What that means is, if there isn&#39;t enough genital tissue to work with, then they can use peritoneal tissue rather than pulling a skin graft from somewhere else on your body that isn&#39;t your genitals. Those sources of extra-genital skin grafts aren&#39;t as well-vascularized, which means that they are more likely to suffer &#34;donor-site morbidity.&#34; I think this means tissue necrosis, but I&#39;m not sure exactly... it doesn&#39;t sound good though :/
</li>
</ol>
<p>
----------
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>
Actually, I don’t know how many times they’ve performed the surgery, but when I spoke to them at the end of June they said they’d had 0 cases of fistula with this technique.
</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, again, I might be misremembering the conversation, or I misinterpreted what was said.
<a href="https://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838(20">Here&#39;s another abstract from the NYU team</a>
30469-3/fulltext) that was published in July 2020 that contradicts what I originally said.
</p>
<p>
This time they analyzed results from 145 trans women who underwent this type of surgery. In that group of 145,
</p>
<ul>
<li>
&#34;
<em>
Complications included transfusion (6%),
</em>
<strong>
<em>
rectovaginal fistula (1%)
</em>
</strong>
<em>
, bowel obstruction (2%), pelvic abscess (1%), and vaginal stenosis (7%).
</em>
&#34;
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, they have had fistula (among other complications) with this method, but it&#39;s a very small percentage. Vaginal stenosis is the highest complication (at 7%). Stenosis is when the canal shrinks or contracts, and it&#39;s usually caused when people don&#39;t follow the dilation schedule (although it can be caused by other things, too).
</p>
<p>
----------
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>
The NYU method involves a portion of peritoneal tissue being used to “cap” the end of the canal (in a sort of cone shape). That “cap” is attached to the rest of the skin graft. So, the canal is composed of penile inversion (shaft skin) for the first third, scrotal tissue for the second third, and peritoneal tissue for the back third.
</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is pretty much accurate, although they never use the word &#34;cone&#34; to describe the shape. The word that they use to describe it is the &#34;apex&#34; of the canal, but they don&#39;t ever specify the shape. I don&#39;t think that part matters too much though.
</p>
<p>
----------
</p>
<p>
I will be consulting with Dr. Bluebond-Langner again in September before my surgery. If anyone has questions, please feel free to post them below or DM me.

I wonder if you can ask to have the scrotum used fully for the Labia Major as that is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_related_male_and_female_reproductive_organs">what it is on a afab</a>
,   You also lose the Labia Minor homology by using the penile skin though with the Bluebond-Langer/Zhao method.  I guess on your end goals.  but at least with the scrotum to Labia Major, you only have to worry about 2 tissue types in your vagina vs 3 per scarring.
</p>
<p>
The lack of lubrication is good to note though.  Thanks!
</p>
<p>
Probably more reasons to wait to see if a Doctor would be willing to attempt a
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25283707/">vitro cultured vaginal tissue stint</a>
(which exists in amab, but is in the
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatic_utricle">Prostate area</a>
).  That or the
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322815395_Autologous_Fibroblast-Seeded_Amnion_for_Reconstruction_of_Neo-vagina_in_Male-to-Female_Reassignment_Surgery">amonion fibroblast seeded</a>
stint.  Or if that&#39;s not available, the
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31103284/">Tilapia skin</a>
method.

Those alternative methods you listed are really interesting, thank you for linking those!
</p>
<p>
I just turned 23, though, and at this point I&#39;m definitely not willing to hold out for a
<em>
Better Method™
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
From what I&#39;ve seen/read, both the hybrid peritoneal and penile inversion methods would be a million times better than the current configuration. As long as surgery is performed by a competent surgeon with a good sense of aesthetics, and an ability to avoid severe complications, I&#39;ll be happy :)
</p>
<p>
The results I&#39;ve seen from NYU Langone are pretty superb, they have low complication rates, good aesthetics, ...

So this sounds like a hybrid method. A canal that is only peritoneal tissue still won&#39;t produce much lubrication? And is there any more academic information on wether or not it is a good procedure? I&#39;m torn between PPT and PI right now because I would really like lubrication but also want to make sure I&#39;m going with a procedure that is proven and has good long term results.

<p>
The research about NYU Langone&#39;s method can&#39;t answer that because they don&#39;t construct canals entirely from peritoneal flaps.
</p>
<p>
There is some info in the wiki section on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_peritoneal_vaginoplasty" rel="nofollow">Peritoneal Vaginoplasty</a>
about people who have had &#34;full PPT&#34; and experience so much lubrication that it&#39;s constantly leaking. So, it may be that the amount of peritoneal tissue used in the canal would have a significant impact on the amount of secretions produced.
</p>
<p>
But, in the context of this post, I guess my main point was to say that, at least with this particular method, the surgeons advise that you should expect 0 lubrication.
</p>

<p>
<em>

<p>
I think that the penile inversion method has a lot of research showing satisfactory outcomes when performed by a competent surgeon. And the NYU Langone method is essentially penile inversion with the addition of a ~5cm peritoneal flap at the back of the canal. Otherwise, it&#39;s the same method.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s no data on long-term outcomes for trans women. There are
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-015-2675-z" rel="nofollow">some scientific data</a>
about women with MRKH syndrome who have peritoneal vaginoplasty to address vaginal agenesis. They seem to have good long-term outcomes, but I don&#39;t know how this method differs. I don&#39;t think it would translate neatly to the context of GAV.

I don&#39;t know, but if you&#39;re consulting with him at some point you could talk to him about that possibility. I think the main issue is that it&#39;s difficult to harvest the peritoneal tissue from inside your abdomen without the robotic assist. So I wouldn&#39;t expect a bunch of surgeons to start switching to this method unless they had a robot (which requires a team of people to set-up and operate).

I don’t know that it’s superior. But I do know that there are many, many people who get PI with a skin graft, and they achieve good depth without complications. This method may be preferred by this particular surgical team, but I think if another surgeon is well practiced with PI, you can get great results.

I&#39;m headed there in March.  I met with Avanessian Mt Sinai this month.  I&#39;m torn on what surgeon and method to choose. I look forward to reading your follow up or hearing anything about your consult.  I&#39;m taking the soonest as long as my insurance (nyu in network) covers mt sinai.

Surgeon says don&#39;t expect it, OP defaulted to the surgeon&#39;s advice - I think that&#39;s reasonable if a tad overconservative. Though I don&#39;t really know how you COULDN&#39;T have more lubrication with a naturally self-lubricated tissue continuing to make lube in your vag.

Dr. Bluebond-Langner specifically emphasized that it shouldn&#39;t be

</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
I sincerely don&#39;t mean to imply with my post that people who experience lubrication after PPT are wrong about their own experiences in any way. I only wanted to share that the surgeon told me it

shouldn&#39;t be expected.
</em>
</p>
<p>
I believe they do this to manage expectations for surgery. Peritoneal tissue does produce secretions, but the amount may differ between individuals.

Oh I didn&#39;t mean to imply any implication from you. I liked your post! Very much the set of info that convinced me to get on her waitlist, months and months ago. 230 more days...

A russian paper I read on the technique said only 2/3 of their patients self lubricated.  After reading that seeing a surgeon say don&#39;t expect it makes sense.  It can happen, but don&#39;t assume it is a given.
</p>
<p>
Edit: or maybe the amount of self-lubrication was so minimal it barely counted?  Sorry been a few years since I read the paper.

To be clear, the information I compiled above is only in relation to the method practiced at NYU Langone.
</p>
<p>
There
<em>
are
</em>
other surgeons who use peritoneal flaps in the construction of the vaginal canal (either in whole or in part). The amount of peritoneal tissue used and the particular method used to construct the canal will likely differ between surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I think that the data presented by a group of surgeons about their specific technique doesn&#39;t necessarily apply to another surgeon&#39;s outcomes. I hope this makes sense.

Dr. Heidi Wittenberg (in San Francisco, CA) performs a peritoneal flap vaginoplasty. I couldn&#39;t find info on her website about whether or not it&#39;s robotic-assisted.
</p>
<p>
However, I did see an image on her website that shows a person who appears to have incisions made in the abdomen and belly button (which are the type of incisions used to make the ports that a robot would access to harvest tissue).
</p>
<p>
Someone who has had surgery with Dr. Wittenberg could hopefully clarify!
</p>
<p>
Although, again, I&#39;d note that the information presented by the NYU team in their research is not going to translate perfectly to another surgeon who uses peritoneal flaps and a robotic-assist. Those two aspects of the surgery could be the same, but if other variables differ (e.g. the amount of peritoneal tissue used) then the outcomes will probably differ a bit, too.

I&#39;m consulting with Dr Wittenberg about revisions and she did mention that she uses a robot for peritoneal revision work. She doesn&#39;t use ppt for every vaginoplasty at this point in time.
