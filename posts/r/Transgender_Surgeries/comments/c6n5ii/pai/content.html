Has anyone had the Sigmoid colon procedure with Pai? I&#39;m currently starting the process and I&#39;m wondering if anyone has went through it personally. Thanks!

I had sigmoid colon SRS at PAI, in November 2018. I wrote a very detailed account of my experience at Susan’s Place. The thread is titled “I had Secondary Sigmoid Colon SRS with PAI”. If you do a google search for that text, you will find the link. There is also a link to that thread in the wiki for this subreddit. Yes, I am SpiralCream.
</p>
<p>
I had a very good experience and am happy with the results. After I started that thread at Susan’s, two more trans women were encouraged by my thread and went there themselves. They added to that thread, writing about their own positive experience with PAI and sigmoid colon surgery.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions that I didn’t cover already in that thread at Susan’s, I will answer them here.

Can you dispel the myth that your lubrication smells unpleasant?
</p>
<p>
Also any excess lubrication that leaks out?
</p>
<p>
Ty.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also planning on having this technique, but with a diff doctor.

Yes, it is a myth. My natural lubricant does not smell bad at all. My vagina doesn’t smell any different from when I had my first SRS with Chettawut.
</p>
<p>
There is a tiny amount of discharge, but it is easily handled by an ultra thin maxi pad that I only change twice a day.  I am 8 months post op though, so maybe it will become even less with more time.
</p>
<p>
My colon vaginal tissue produces lubricant based on what it feels inside it.  To understand this, think about how things move through your colon in your digestive system. If you are not eating anything, does lubricant come out constantly and randomly out of your anus? No, of course not. The colon tissue produces lubricant when it feels food/waste particles moving through it, to facilitate the particles to move through it.  Similarly, my colon vagina, while it is moist at all times, does not constantly produce lubricant for no reason. But when it feels something moving along inside it (like a penis!) it produces lubricant to facilitate movement and reduce friction.

No, I had full depth with Dr Chet. But the internal skin graft failed about a month after I returned home.

Oh no, I&#39;m sorry to hear that. How has everything worked out in the end for you?  This is the first time that I have heard about something like this happening before.

Everything is fine now, thanks to PAI. It was a successful surgery and now 8 months post op I am doing very well.

That is great to hear. :)
</p>
<p>
The month that you did have the non Inversion method installed, were you still in Thailand and was the whole month nothing but problems and very stressful or was it more like just one day it failed?

Just one day it failed. I waited 4 months hoping it would get better but it never did. Then I flew back to Thailand and Chettawut examined me. He said I would need sigmoid colon revision. I flew back home and thought about my options. After 6 more months I flew back to Thailand again for sigmoid colon revision with PAI.

I&#39;ve not heard of that happening before. Any idea why?
</p>
<p>
Did having the second surgery at PAI change the aesthetics you got with Chettawut at all?

It’s more common than you may think. PAI alone does 50 sigmoid colon surgeries per year. And of course there are other additional colon surgeries done around the world. How many of those hundreds of people have written about their experiences in the last several years?  Almost zero, except me.  It’s too bad that more people don’t share about their SRS experiences.
</p>
<p>
Dr Burin at PAI told me that internal skin graft failure is quite common when most or all of the vaginal canal is constructed from skin grafts, as was the case with me. I had very little material for Chettawut to work with. I know of at least one other trans woman in my area who also had SRS with Chet. Her skin graft also failed and she also had to get sigmoid colon revision. But she went with Chet, not PAI, for her sigmoid colon surgery. Last I heard she is doing well. But you never heard of her because like 99% of other trans women who get surgeries, she did not share her experience on the internet.
</p>
<p>
The second surgery at PAI did not change the aesthetics of my vagina at all. It is 100% the same.  You can’t even see the colon tissue unless you use a medical speculum. I do still have a scar similar to a Caesarean section scar though. I went to my med spa and they told me they can use laser to greatly reduce the appearance of the scar. I need to wait until I am 1 year post op though.

That&#39;s very informative, but I realise I don&#39;t actually know know failure means? How do you know if it fails?

Constant bleeding, pain, and discharge. A failed skin graft manifests as large areas of hyper granulation that does not respond to treatments of silver nitrate or electro-cauterization. The only way at that point is to completely replace the failed tissue with a new graft.

They used 8 inches of sigmoid colon tissue. I was able to dilate to about 7 inches several months after surgery.

FTFY:
</p>
<p>
They used
<strong>
20.3 centimeters
</strong>
of sigmoid colon tissue. I was able to dilate to about
<strong>
17.8 centimeters
</strong>
several months after surgery.
