so for some context i’m 20 and i’ve been on hrt for almost 2 years. i dropped out of uni in september to take a year out and focus on getting surgeries and furthering my transition. my original plan was to get bottom surgery in late feb/early march and then ffs in august kinda time once i’d mainly recovered from bottom surgery. however, due to a number of circumstances, i still haven’t had bottom surgery, although i have it all confirmed now for the end of this month. i go back to uni at the end of september and i still haven’t sorted out my ffs. im now getting kinda worried that my ffs will be too close to bottom surgery if i get it in august or too close to going back to uni for things to heal a bit if i go in september. i really don’t want to be going back to uni with my face all bruised and swollen. so anyway, i wondered how painful ffs really is and how long i should leave between bottom surgery and ffs as well as ffs and going back to uni?? i hope this makes some kind of sense lol

Today I had my ffs on March 19th I have to admit it was really painful for the first 2-3 days I couldn&#39;t eat anything and I was constantly given painkillers.  I was supposed to stay in the hospital for 3 days but stayed 5 days because I was in pain, after that it was less but the pain is also dependent on how sensitive you are.  I wasn&#39;t blue but very swollen.  The truth is that you can only breathe through your mouth after the op, so you have to prepare yourself if you do a nose job.  The first 2 days are the worst because you have a tampon in your nose and you can&#39;t breathe at all, your mouth always dries out because you only breathe through your mouth.  Although there is no pain, it is difficult to breathe and eat at the same time because everything happens through the mouth.  Jaw still hurts can&#39;t chew hard things.  Swelling is still there and forehead chin and nose are numb.  I&#39;ll be home until April 18th, so I&#39;m counting on a month&#39;s rest

Could you have seen yourself going overseas to visit say a partner a month after surgery?

Everyone will be different.
</p>
<p>
I had my FFS and augmentation on the 30th. I have had absolutely no pain whatsoever. I woke up from the surgery confused because I fully expected to be in pain already and was wondering if I even had the surgery.
</p>
<p>
My face still looks like I was beat up by a gang of bikers and left for dead in the gutter so I know they did the surgery. I just feel no pain from this. NONE.
</p>
<p>
I had these things stuffed up my nose from Wednesday until my appointment on Thursday when they removed them. I need to put eyedrops in my eyes because they are blood red still today and they get so irritated.
</p>
<p>
They released me the same day on the 30th and I had a nurse that I hired take care of me until Saturday morning.

I had FFS on March 10. The first night was pretty spicy but it&#39;s mostly been low key annoying since then. I&#39;m only about 20-something days post op now and I still have quite a bit of swelling but the pain level is pretty low. Honestly, during my particular recovery I didn&#39;t really need any narcotics.
</p>
<p>
Edit to add: I would plan
<em>
at least
</em>
3 months between FFS and any further surgery. So if going back to University in September is your goal and you had FFS in April somehow (not sure where you&#39;d go in that timeframe given wait lists) you could potentially have bottom surgery in July or August.
</p>
<p>
(Or vice-versa I guess. But personally I think the recovery from FFS will be quite a bit easier and less stressful than bottom surgery.)

thanks for the info :) that’s really good to hear. i kinda expected the first few days to not be great but yeah i think it definitely seems less stressful overall than bottom surgery. i’m also p much only getting jaw and chin work with some minor forehead stuff so i’m hoping that’ll make things slightly less bad??
</p>
<p>
i’m getting bottom surgery at the end of this month, i already have my date confirmed with the hospital and everything. there’ll probably be around 4 months between my bottom surgery date and my ffs date, so do you think that’s okay?? i want to leave at least a month before i’m going back to uni i think

FFS pain depends on the surgical technique, your pain tolerance, and how well you respond to painkillers. Best case it’s not very painful and can be managed with paracetamol, worse case it’s pretty bad and you’re on opiates, which hopefully work.
