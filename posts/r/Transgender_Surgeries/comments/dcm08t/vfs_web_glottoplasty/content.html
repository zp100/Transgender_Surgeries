Off for my second web glottoplasty in London today with NHS England.
</p>
<p>
I originally had it in March this year but the surgery broke down as the suturing hadn’t been good enough or I screwed up the recovery?
</p>
<p>
For the two or three weeks it really worked last time before breaking down it was amazing so hoping it all sticks and works this time.
</p>
<p>
Ironically my voice training has improved a lot since then but still want the surgery to remove the bass end of my resting voice.

Thank you, surgery went smoothly. Now silence for a bit and patience until I find out the result.

Only a weeks complete vocal rest. Then can talk a little bit in a confidential quiet voice before bringing it up from two weeks - slowly - keeping generally quiet for 6 weeks - no whispering though. They thought it was counterproductive to have vocal rest for too long.

He did your original surgery and this second one as well?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve not heard of him before. I added a link to this post in the surgery wiki. Would you like to add anything for others considering this surgeon in the future?

He did both surgeries. He said it was very rare for it to fail but sutures didn’t hold properly first time - whether my fault or his idk
</p>
<p>
This was through the NHS but a speech therapist there told me they do it privately for approx. £3-4K
</p>
<p>
I had Web Glottoplasty using CO2 lasers. He offers Cricothyroid Approximation as a last resort if the Glottoplasty doesn’t work but is less satisfied with results from CA - less consistent pitch.
