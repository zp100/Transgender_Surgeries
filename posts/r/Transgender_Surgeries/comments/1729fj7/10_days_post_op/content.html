Took a look at your earlier post surgery posts and it looks like you are healing well. Really hope you love the outcome, I‚Äôve had an orchie and in my late 50‚Äôs and ZDV just seems like such a wonderful choice.

Awww ü•∞ thank you. Still very sore but the pain seems to be subsiding. The swelling is going down a little bit and the bruising is going away overall I feel great thanks for asking.

Yes those are the same reasons I&#39;m wanting to have zero depth very very low maintenance I&#39;ve always wanted zero depth and with my health the way it is I was set for a consultation in Tennessee and I live in Arkansas and with my insurance being out of state they would have trouble getting my insurance to cover it in my they dropped my insurance so unless I had cash which I didn&#39;t they canceled my appointment

Look into Arkansas bluecross blue shield PPO trueblue out of state. I had mine through the affordable care act and had only a 875 max out of pocket for the year with a 400 deductible  By the time my surgery came i was down to only 60 dollars so yeah a 25,000 surgery for 60 dollars.

Omg thank you. Yes the maintenance of dilating was not appealing. not to mention the risks associated with full depth vaginoplasty like rectal injury for example.

They are in network. Bluecross just preauthorized and then paid for my surgery. If you have PPO trueblue out of state then you are all good. Make an appointment for a Telehealth appointment consultation with Grey or her nurse Judy. Use me as a referral my name is Stephanie Lynn Lesmeister. They will run your insurance and let you know-w what‚Äôs up right away.

My is Blue Cross Blue shield and PPO I&#39;ve already met my deductible and copay and out of pocket for in network but out of network I still have a long way to go like 1300 deductible and something like 11,000 copay and then even when I met that I got to pay 50% and even in network I got to pay 30% and being on disability that&#39;s hard to do I can barely make my business as it is my monthly insurance rates only $26 but the rest of my bills add up to everything else

By the way what&#39;s the type of surgery you had zero depth did you have to do any type of hair removal before surgery I&#39;ve heard what that type of surgery you don&#39;t have to

Okay I can try I just talked to my insurance company and they said anything out of state would have to have preauthorization which already knew and be medically necessary and still there&#39;s a chance they would deny it being it&#39;s not in the network I would have to find out if it was in the network I&#39;ll go check and see if it is thank you very much because I need to get my surgery done very badly
