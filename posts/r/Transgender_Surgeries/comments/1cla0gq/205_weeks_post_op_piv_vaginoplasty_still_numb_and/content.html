It’s getting progressively more painful to sit. My vaginal canal feels incredibly sore. I can only use the petite dilators and I’m far away from the first dot. I still have a very numb labia and no ability to orgasm. My clitoris is completely hidden behind fused skin and since that skin is numb I’m guessing that’s part of the struggles to orgasm. Any sensation I do feel in the clitoral area does not feel pleasurable at all. I’m on day 146. It’s a slow process. I have no functional depth or width, no visible clitoris, can’t orgasm.
</p>
<p>
I have a revision scheduled next month for depth width, bringing forward the clitoris and connecting the labia to the introitus. How painful is revision surgery recovery? I haven’t gone a day without pain in 146 days. 146 days of pain is brutal and I’m about to restart the pain clock and the dilation clock. This has been an incredibly difficult journey for me. I deal with major depression and have no clue what the future holds.

I can only imagine how concerned and disappointed you are.  I can&#39;t answer your question unfortunately, but I very much hope it goes well for you.  You&#39;re very strong to have kept the faith, and signed up for a revision.

Same here, but I’m not trying to do any of that so I’m really grateful that I haven’t been able to do that and it’s been part of my dysphoria that has caused that

I&#39;m not a professional,  nor have I been allowed to get mine done yet. I will never receive a canal. But I have been researching for the last 5 years.
</p>
<p>
1 have you been checked for bacteria? 2 does it seem like you have inflammation still? 3 have you been using a vibrator?
</p>
<p>
Bacteria, and inflammation can cause it to be harder to dilate. Also prevent you from having revision until its cleared up... inflammation can be brought down by ibuprofen, but you need to ask if it&#39;s too close to surgery to try. Vibrator has shown to stimulate growth of new nerves and awaken current ones. I&#39;m sorry you are having issues, and hope you&#39;re revision goes excellent.

Crohns. Most only are willing to give me zero depth. I&#39;m talking to one right now that might be willing to give me a minimal depth. I will never get a canal.

Yeah, that’s difficult. I think others have done it though.

My issue is I had a fistula 10 years ago and it was corrected. But because I had one I can technically have another. Which means it could go co between canal and colon. So I&#39;m high risk, and no one is really willing to do it. I also can&#39;t afford to pay cash either.

Hmm, could you do it in two stages to reduce the risk? Have you looked into that?

It&#39;s not the risk of the surgery, I was offered to do both top and bottom surgery at the same time. (Same surgeon and plastic surgeon.  The fistula that doesn&#39;t even exist could open between the two.  I&#39;ve only had one, and long ago. I have looked at multiple ways, and the only one who is willing to do minimal depth, is the Peritoneal pull-through. Which is only done by him in one procedure.  1.5 inches is not much, which is common for minimal depth.

So basically they are afraid of a hypothetical due to past history?

Exactly. But Noone wants to touch the issue. Now the one in Mexico said they would do it. Afraid to take that route, and cash is an issue.
