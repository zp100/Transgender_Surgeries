Complications are the real deal but once they go away you&#39;d be glad to have gotten SRS.

You‚Äôre also in the time frame of post op depression in addition to the complications.
</p>
<p>
You‚Äôre still healing from a major surgery, and nutrients your brain needs are being diverted for healing. So while I‚Äôm not a 100% sure you have that, it‚Äôs possibly compounding your struggles.
</p>
<p>
You can get a revision, since you chose PI you have the possibility of ppt or the intestinal procedure.but your post indicates that you know this. You‚Äôve got time to get better insurance and file appeals for any denials this insurance is failing you on. Plus there is the possibility of having your case reviewed for potential malpractice. (Don‚Äôt make threats though, you don‚Äôt want your records to get ‚Äúlost‚Äù or get edited.)
</p>
<p>
Please don‚Äôt give up. This is a lot on you right now but like I said I have a suspicion you‚Äôre dealing with all this and post op depression too. But you can do this,

I read somewhere before my surgery that every hour under anesthesia can lead to depression for a week.

Hang in there. I had an extremely rough start with massive hemorrhoids that needed surgery one week later. I can tell you it does get better.

I totally get that. I still need a revision almost three years later since a flap was left over my vagina that makes dilating and sex painful. (It has to be pulled down.) I don‚Äôt blame my surgeon because there is only so much they can do with the swelling.

This all sucks and I‚Äôm very sorry. I think it‚Äôs good to remember the people have complications and still end up ultimately at the very least happier than pre-op. I think you will be the same, but I know that doesn‚Äôt make right now much happier.
</p>
<p>
If I can ask, what is your support system irl like to help with all these? Do you have friends/family to help take the stress off or are you navigating it mostly alone?

Mother and my boyfriend/relationship is actually causing more emotional turmoil than ever right now. It‚Äôs a codependent relationship and I need him for my primary needs and that‚Äôs being threatened right now while i‚Äôm at my weakest state so it seriously puts the heat on me.

Gotcha. I guess I meant like, is there an lgbt center in your town? Somewhere lgbt people in your area can go to if they need resources and such?

Totally understandable, I don‚Äôt want to presume you‚Äôre somewhere with a robust LGBT community. In that case maybe locally linked social media networks could be useful? What I‚Äôm basically trying to accomplish here is help you get yourself some supportive people in your life who aren‚Äôt your BF. People who can at least offer you someone to talk to irl and maybe some advice on where to go for help. Online places like this are great, but they are never a substitute for irl connections, which (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong), it sounds like you‚Äôre low on atm.

I did start talking to a girl i met on here who had her surgery a week before me and we‚Äôve become good friends since that so maybe if i find a few more like that i‚Äôll be good. just really feeling the pressure right now is all. thank you for the advice i appreciate you taking the time.

&#34;It looks okay but the clitoris is huge and not tucked away behind a hood and looks exactly like the tip of a penis (i know that‚Äôs what it is)...&#34;
</p>
<p>
I have the same issue. I got no idea why they thought it had to be that big, maybe to try and have more sensitivity? But mines too sensitive as it is. Revision for sure.
</p>
<p>
&#34;...having the canal below the vulva is a oddity i didn‚Äôt expect.&#34;
</p>
<p>
This. This needs to be more common knowledge as I didn&#39;t expect this either and it was a major stress for me after I realised. Once again maybe a revision can fix this.

They make the clitoris large and prominent because it lowers the chance of necrosis and if you lose your clit in recovery you can‚Äôt get it back. They put the vagina below the vulva because of the internal organs and narrower pelvis us trans women have and hate. Everything the surgeon does is to preserve the existing tissue so if they have to sacrifice aesthetics they will. I definitely see a revision in my future with PPT method because PI depth is some bullsh*.

I&#39;m sorry there have been struggles with surgery and then you have all this added stress. It&#39;s not fair and it&#39;s scary. I cannot believe the surgeon didn&#39;t believe where you were peeing from until he saw it himself.

In his field he really can‚Äôt believe everything a patient claims without seeing it for himself. I understood why but it was no less frustrating.

Is there a chance you‚Äôre going through post-op depression?  Not to invalidate your feelings, but what you have described isn‚Äôt the end of the world.  You still have options in revisions.  Between a vagina that is non functional and pretty and one that is functional and not exactly what I was expecting, I‚Äôd choose the latter.  I know it‚Äôs tough on the mind, but just know it‚Äôs early, you have options, and you‚Äôve gone a long way.  Don‚Äôt give up now.  I‚Äôd focus on healing, keeping open communication w your doctor, and maintaining your mental health.  Everything else will work itself out.  Rooting for you!
