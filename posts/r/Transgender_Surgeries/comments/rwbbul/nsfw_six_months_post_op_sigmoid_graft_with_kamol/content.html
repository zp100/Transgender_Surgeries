Just figured I&#39;d drop in an give a short update since I&#39;m six months post op! Since my last post most of my swelling seems to be gone, and my vagina is in good order, despite my continued poor compliance with dilation schedule. No more strange discharge, sex is easy enough and satisfying, and it happy with how everything looks now. Feel free to ask questions! Images in link below.

I had kind of a brownish clumpy, booger consistency discharge that cleared up around month 5. Never really had a yellow goo.

I&#39;m quite happy with the results, and the fact that my vagina seems so resilient to me not being great at remembering to dilate. I liked kamol and his hospital well enough, but I&#39;m an easy patient. I was content to let him do his thing, and was researched enough to handle myself a fair bit. Others who need a more feedback oriented doctor or need more things explained might find him frustrating to work with.

Your results look great. One of the most natural clits and hoods I&#39;ve seen. A lot of vlits I&#39;ve seen seem to look like stitched up tips of penises and it scares me :(

hey! thank you for sharing your experience. I&#39;ve been researching and am strongly considering sigmoid. if it&#39;s not too late for questions...
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Does the fact you used a section of your colon had any impact on your diet? I&#39;ve heard the procedure can be more invasive than other methods and I wonder whether your health is affected afterwards or if you become prone to any conditions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Did Kamol specify what hair removal regimen to adhere to prior to the surgery? I&#39;m thinking of doing the procedure with Dr. Miroslav and he didn&#39;t specify whether he wanted laser or electrolysis, so I&#39;m suspecting laser might be enough since you aren&#39;t using penile tissue for the vaginal canal.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thanks!

I was dead set on Kamol since i saw your post back in December. Now that ive lost enough weight to qualify for sigmoid graft, ive been seeing mixed reviews on reddit and it&#39;s starting to sway my decision.

It&#39;s a big decision, and I have no doubt Kamol is not a perfect doctor. I had a good experience, and I&#39;m still very Happy with my results, but I also had a very specific set of expectations and needs, and I doubt that would match up with lots of people. I do think I&#39;ve heard reports from all of the Thai doctors that show they have the problem of &#34;the surgery is done and any complications are gonna cost extra to fix, if I even acknowledge them&#34;,  which makes sense since they basically have no accountability to medical tourists legally. It&#39;s certainly a factor to be aware of, and be prepared for. I made sure I had a GP ready and on call back at home with experience with post op girls and recommendations ready for specialists if issues cropped up. Certainly make sure, no matter who you go with, that you&#39;ve got your ducks in a row. Fingers crossed that you get it all figured out and get your op soon! I hope my recounting has been able to help no matter who you go with.

I can feel pressure and movement, but not specific touch as if you put a finger in and just poke a random spot. This is largely analogous to how my AFAB partners describe the sensation of being penetrated, though. Most sensation around the opening, g-spot, and cervix, and everything else is mostly pressure and movement.
