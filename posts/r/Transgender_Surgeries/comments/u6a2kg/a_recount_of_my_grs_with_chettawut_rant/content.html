I have been struggling a lot with the aftermath of GRS, so I made this throwaway account to tell my story. I hope this helps people, but truth be told I&#39;m doing this to finally get some peace.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I had surgery with Chettawut almost 4 years ago in 2018.
<br>
I never had much money and was struggling with other things in my life when I decided to go for it, and took me about 2 years of holding three different jobs to pay for my trip to Thailand and for my surgery with him.
</p>
<p>
Looking back I sometimes wonder why I chose him. It was a combination of recounts of reddit stories, plus not being able to afford Suporn which I guess were the two most famous surgeons at the time. Surgeons in my country of origin are absolute trash, so that was never an option - nor was it having healthcare that covered anything remotely trans related.
</p>
<p>
When arriving in Thailand and first meeting Chettawut one of the things that struck me as immeditely wierd was that he kept asking me very heterocentric questions about my preferences. He asked my wife which was with me there at the time if she was ok with me doing it, even going as far as asking her to sign a concent form for her to give permission for me to do my surgery.
</p>
<p>
When I expressed that I am a lesbian, he suggested then that I did not need depth and should get a minimal depth surgery. I objected, not wanting to get into details and argument of why this is not true, but also feeling already like something is up when the surgeon who is supposed to be an expert in making vaginas does not understand how they are used. Additionally, I got breast enhancement with him, but more on that later.
</p>
<p>
The recovery was not great, there was a lot of blood, a lot of pain, and what I felt was a lot of misinformation from his team. Yes, they all speak english, but there was always the feeling that they have done this so many damn times that they take for granted that you should know everything as well as they do. But this is really not a recount of recovery, it was very long time ago.
</p>
<p>
What I really want to convey is that last 3 years. I&#39;ve had several complications, perhaps not as bad as other girls, but i&#39;ve struggled a LOT with neuropathies.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know exactly, and will never know, what happened in the surgery. But the first few months after it I had neuropathies in my left foot, where my big toe would feel like it was on fire whenever it brushed up against my sock. Thankfully I was able to get this in control with the help of my gynecologist and a neurologist, which both believe it was due to a bad anesthesiologist (since they block you on the spine for surgery.).
</p>
<p>
The other neurophatic problem ive been struggling, and still am, is near my clitoris. Basically if that are gets even a _little_ bit irritated be it by sweat, friction, lube, whatever - it feels like anything that touches it is sand paper. Surprise, I havent ever been able to have an orgasm with a partner because it is a combination of pleasure and pain. By myself its a little bit more manageable, since I don&#39;t have to communicate pain points and can traverse my feelings better, but meh.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetics. God, where to even begin? I am not happy at all with the results. He left two gigantic scars on the sides of the vulva from where the bottom of the vaginal opening is to almost the height of the clitoris going outwards in a V shape. He claimed that I needed a skin graft ($$$$$) even though my final depth was only almost 5 inches. WHAT?
</p>
<p>
Thats not even it. The back of the vulva&#39;s wall, where the clitoris is has at least 4 &#34;holes&#34;. They are not really holes per se, but more like poorly made stitches that created ligaments over them, which now I have to get fixed. Mind you these are bad enough that a gynecologist seeing me for the first time could not tell which of them was the urethra.
</p>
<p>
About the urethra - on the wrong spot/angle. Peeing is a major pain in the ass. I dont have to bend in weird ways, but squatting is out of the question, if the angle is not perfect the pee stream hits the bottom of the vaginal canal and sprays everywhere outside of the toilet. I was hoping this would go away with time, and it didnt. Its even worse whenever theres some sort of swelling, for example after dilation.
</p>
<p>
Dilation... Impossible, after almost 4 years I still am getting bleeding, pain, and at this point im only doing it to not lose the depth &#34;just in case&#34;. I have thought several times about just stopping altogether, but I havent done it since I want to consult with a dr first to make sure that once that shit closes up theres no infection or potentially another problem.
</p>
<p>
The depth is unideal, I cant fit most toys - even the ones marketed for women with vaginismus, let alone a penis. Thank god im gay.
</p>
<p>
Not only that, but two gynos have confirmed that the muscle surrounding the vaginal canal was not carved/removed properly enough so that even with dilation I will never get to a good size. So I can only get the dilation before the biggest one inside and only about half way.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m now looking to go to another surgeon, for yet another surgery to at least fix the aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
PS. Dont go to Schaff, his manners are borderline rapey. Unless you want a guy, WITH NO GLOVES touching your clitoris and asking you if that feels good.

Unfortunately, both Schaff, Chettawut and Suporn are very heteronormative doctors.
</p>
<p>
Stick with US and UK doctors if you want more open-minded surgeons.

I wish those of us in poor countries with little to no resources could afford to go to the US for surgery, but sadly we don&#39;t have much of a choice

This is the wrong conclusion to draw.

Which UK doctors would you recommend? The ones I&#39;ve seen seem a bit scary with their whole &#34;sign this acknowledgement that there&#39;s only a 75% chance you&#39;ll be able to orgasm&#34; thing but I can get them for free via the NHS

Apparently they put you down as not being able to orgasm if you haven’t had one by like 2-3 months which is wild! I’m sure most patients actually do have one after that appointment

That&#39;s a huge relief! Although also maybe a little worrying that they&#39;re not properly following up with their patients. Not sure if it&#39;s £12,000 and a trip to Serbia levels of worrying though!

I’m not sure why they do it in such a manner but yeah, from what I’ve heard their statistics are pretty inaccurate

Eh. So you had a good experience, and a lot of people did. That doesnt balance out the fact that for me it has brought me so much distress. I did ask him for a revision, and he only wants to fix a partial part (the holes).
</p>
<p>
He fails to aknowledge anything regarding the neuropathies, claming its a non specific symptom and the scars that he left me. Honestly I just hope that people know that its a coin toss when they go here
