Dr. Gallagher in Miami, FL, United States. She is on TikTok I guess. She dismissed a trans man’s massive infection from his top surgery that she did and belittled him in a sexist bid to make a joke. The post I linked has the original post from the man himself. It does include graphic conversation about his resulting medical issues and infection, so I didn’t link it directly.
</p>
<p>
Please stay safe!!!

Fortunately, the MtF community is about 5 years ahead  on this issues. There are plenty of victims of this surgeon here already.

Then the lack of documentation on this sub of issues transmascs have faced with her is concerning - after all, this isn&#39;t
<a href="/r/MtF_Surgeries">r/MtF_Surgeries
</a>
. I think a lot of people assume that transmasculine top surgery is simple or hard to mess up, since it&#39;s &#34;just&#34; tissue removal. This is a sobering reminder that it can go as badly wrong as any other transition-related procedure.

transmasc people don’t post here much. The transmasc subs are pretty good so they mainly stay there, but they don’t collect info in a wiki like I do so knowledge isn’t accumulated in the same way. I’m all out of energy to expand beyond what I have.

I wasn&#39;t implying it was your fault at all - sorry if it came off that way. Obviously you can&#39;t organize info you don&#39;t have access to. I really appreciate everything you do here regardless. The wiki has been a huge help to me.

It didn’t come off that way. I was just explain how it came to be.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice if someone (not me) built a wiki for the ftm community, either here or on one of the ftm subs, but it seems a bit unlikely.

There are bad reports in
<a href="/r/TopSurgery">r/TopSurgery
</a>
about Gallagher. We have made the effort to inform everyone. I&#39;ve posted about this myself in transmasc subreddits. For whatever reasons, until Ryan&#39;s post on twitter, those concerns haven&#39;t had much impact and then languished into reddit oblivion. It&#39;s very traumatic when this happens to you. It takes a toll on you that most people don&#39;t fully comprehend. In fact there are people that have contacted me personally to talk about ongoing problems that choose not to go public. I respect their choice but after reading the onslaught of vicious responses from the anti-trans army on twitter, no one should question the value of a sub like
<a href="/r/transgender_surgeries">r/transgender_surgeries
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
I reached out to Ryan shortly after the post went nuclear and he was completely overwhelmed by the hate messages. How could you not be? I invited him to post his story here without fear of any reprisals from the twitter horde. He said he would try to talk about it more when he feels better. According to his post, It doesn&#39;t sound like he&#39;s interested in continuing on twitter.

There was a post a couple years ago by a trans man who had badly botched FMS done by Dr. Deschamps-Braly.

That was an ugly story, but typical in the way surgeons handle patients when they aren&#39;t happy and complain.

No matter what these surgeons say about being affirming and wanting to help us at the end of the day we’re still just a paycheck to them.

So, is Dr. Descamps-Braly a hack?  What happened with that &#34;botched&#34; surgery?

So everyone understands. Dr. Gallagher is the surgeon responsable for crossing the ethical boundaries of marketing gender-affirming surgery to minors on Tik Tok. This was something she started after her Relocation from Indiana to Miami FL. As a result of her escalation into Tik Tok, along with her public admission of operating on minors, she drew the wrong kind of political and legal attention. The anti-trans youth groundswell we are dealing with now, grew out of the outrage over her activities in addition to images of an alleged FTM minor  sitting in a recovery room after his surgery. In the image you can see the IU Health logo on the wall behind the patient.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea where or how that image was obtained and made public. I have seen seen it. There&#39;s nothing that looks suspect, but I would never post a link to it here. Nor should anyone else.

Our next campaign is going to include Gallagher too. She is just as terrible as Rumer and they both need to be in prison.

I’m so glad that her office manager blew me off years ago and I never had surgery with Dr. Gallagher. I’ve known not a few folks who did not fare as well and took a bit to recover from the experience.
