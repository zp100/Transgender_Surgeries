I&#39;m leaving on the 2nd (ahhhh), and I&#39;ll be going with my girlfriend.  I&#39;ll be staying at the Dusit Princess, so some of my questions will be specific to that, but any answers to anything would be great!  Apologies for how stream of conscious all of these are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I know Chett operates out of a clinic and that you stay there for a few days - a week after surgery, but I was wondering if my girlfriend could stay in my room with me or if she&#39;ll need to stay back at the hotel?
</li>
<li>
How is the internet in the recovery room / hotel?  Is it still free?
</li>
<li>
Are there any places we should check out during the two ish days we have free before my surgery?
</li>
<li>
How safe is travelling between the hotel and Chett&#39;s clinic?
</li>
<li>
Any recommendations on how to avoid getting a bit stir crazy while recovering?  Both for me, but mostly for my girlfriend.  She&#39;s not keen on travelling or going far alone.
</li>
<li>
I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s best to get ahead of time / bring when it comes to preparing for recovery.  I know it&#39;s a broad question, but any suggestions for underwear, lube, pillows, etc.
<br>
</li>
<li>
How necessary is bug spray?
</li>
<li>
From a cursory google search, the plugs in Thailand seem to be the same as the US.  Is this actually the case?
</li>
<li>
Any general advice on how to be as safe as possible when travelling to Thailand?
</li>
<li>
I&#39;m struggling to get a second letter supporting my SRS, due to weirdness at the clinic I went to.  I have one already from my therapist, but I was wondering how bad / what I&#39;ll have to do if I don&#39;t have it in time to leave?
</li>
<li>
Any suggestions on &#34;last things to do while I have a dick&#34;?
</li>
<li>
What was something that surprised you about the experience?
</li>
<li>
Worst part?  Best part?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yea!  I think that&#39;s everything.  I&#39;m a bundle of nerves at the moment, but I&#39;m pretty excited :)  Thanks in advance to anyone who responds!
</p>
<p>
EDIT - Also if anyone happens to be in and around Thailand from June 4 - July 2, I&#39;d love to meet some new folks!

I had my surgery about 7 weeks ago. I too stayed at the Dusit Princess. I will do my best to answer your questions:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
but I was wondering if my girlfriend could stay in my room with me or if she&#39;ll need to stay back at the hotel?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
She&#39;ll need to stay back at the hotel. The visitation hours are pretty limited unfortunately. The day after surgery you get 1 hour, then after that its 3 hours only.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How is the internet in the recovery room / hotel? Is it still free?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&#39;s free in both the recovery room and hotel. It&#39;s also good enough for Netflix in both the recovery room and hotel :) I think in the hotel I was getting around 25 Mbps. I was too out of it to test in the recovery room though :P
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Are there any places we should check out during the two ish days we have free before my surgery?
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Floating markets - There are a bunch. We went to
<a href="http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/damnoen-saduak-floating-market.htm">Damnoen Floating Market</a>
. It was a neat experience.
</li>
<li>
Temples - There are tons. At least 40 or 50. The ones most people go see are The Grand Palace Wat Arun and Wat Phra Kaew. I did not get to see any unfortunately.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/rot-fai-market-ratchada.htm">Train Night Market</a>
- I wasn&#39;t able to go see this but my wife said it was pretty neat.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bangkok.com/shopping-mall/seacon-square.htm">Seacon Square Mall</a>
- This is a huge 6 or 7 floor mall the size of a football field. Lots of shopping, lots of food, neat to walk around and see.
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
How safe is travelling between the hotel and Chett&#39;s clinic?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You&#39;ll get transportation to and from the clinic/hotel, but your girlfriend will need to get her own when she visits. My wife used the Grab app (it&#39;s an all in one app for ride sharing, food, groceries, etc.). She didn&#39;t having any issues.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Any recommendations on how to avoid getting a bit stir crazy while recovering? Both for me, but mostly for my girlfriend. She&#39;s not keen on travelling or going far alone.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Go down to the pool and the restaurants. Also go to Seacon square right across the street or Paradise Park mall (at the end and across from Seacon square). The Night market is also open pretty late for street food and bars.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s best to get ahead of time / bring when it comes to preparing for recovery.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Pack Colace. As soon as you’re back at the hotel take one with breakfast and one before bed. If you don’t poop soon enough for the nurses liking they’ll make you take an herbal laxative and it’s not a good time.
</p>
<p>
Pack a fuck ton of things you’ll actually want to eat after surgery. The first day you’re back at the hotel (until the packing comes out) you’re on a soft foods diet. So think soft granola bars (bonus points if they’re high in fiber), instant oatmeal packs, etc. Breakfast is free for you to order at the hotel but all other meals are on your dime.
</p>
<p>
Pack loose clothing like dresses and robes. Tight clothing was not comfortable for me.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How necessary is bug spray?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not really. You&#39;ll probably get a handful of bug bites, but mostly you should be fine. My wife was out and about nearly everyday and she got bit 3 or 4 times (which is not much considering she usually gets eaten alive by bugs).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
plugs in Thailand seem to be the same as the US. Is this actually the case?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes your US plugs will fit in the sockets, however the voltage is 220 so you will need a converter. Things like hair dryers typically have a switch to change from 110 to 220. Computer/cell phone chargers tend to have converters built in, but double check on the charger. It should say 220 or 240V if it does. For example, my 3DS charger only says 110V so I needed a converter to use it. I ended up buying
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0785QS46W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this</a>
which came in handy and was compact.
</p>

</p>

<p>
It&#39;s a pretty safe city. My wife even went on a tour of some temples an hour outside the city on her own and she had a great time.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You&#39;ll want to get one before you go, otherwise you&#39;ll have to find someone in Thailand to pay to get you a 2nd letter. I had both letters so I don&#39;t know how to do this.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Any suggestions on &#34;last things to do while I have a dick&#34;?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not really. You could get one of those clone a willy things so you can fuck yourself when you&#39;re healed?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What was something that surprised you about the experience?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The terrain and things looked a lot like Southern California except with way more humidity. Also the drivering there is like organized chaos. Lots of vespas/scooters zipping around and it just all works together in harmony but yet its chaos.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Worst part? Best part?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Worst part: Sweating. So. Much. Sweating. So humid. Best part: Food. My wife and I love Asian food. Ramen, Rice dishes, Sushi, all so good and cheap!

I don’t really have an answer to your questions but I did get both my letters from the thai psychiatrists. And I will say that they are both more typically traditional when it comes to their expectations for trans women. They asked me if I was straight and I could tell that it mattered to them.  I’m sure they let lesbians get srs but it might do you some favors to just say you have a boyfriend instead to prevent any unwanted questions that don’t need to get in the way of your srs. Just a heads up for what to expect if you go with the thai psychiatrist route (pretty sure you do need one at this point though). Good luck! It’s a transformation of a lifetime and it’ll be difficult but it’ll be worth it. Stay strong girl!

Have you looked in the wiki? There&#39;s quite a lot about Chett and Thailand.

If you need anything I had posted some of the links I found useful in here, (
<a href="http://bambi.atspace.org/guide.html" rel="nofollow">http://bambi.atspace.org/guide.html</a>
) has been unreachable for me for awhile
</p>

<p>
Oh.. I read that a satin-like
<a href="https://www.tencel.com/about" rel="nofollow">pillowcase</a>
would be useful for those nights after SRS at the clinic especially if you have long hair and  treated straight at some cost, as braiding will destroy that investment &gt;.&lt;
