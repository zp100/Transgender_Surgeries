Are these electrolysis effects normal? Yellow discharge and white bumps. I used Bacitracin per electro&#39;s recommendation; was careful not to touch. Photos 1 day after treatment, before and after cleaning the area. Thanks!

Sort of yes and no the probe or there not letting your skin cool down so yes it’s normal for electrolissis but it just shows they’re not that experienced

Do you think it will heal properly and not scar? How worried should I be?
</p>
<p>
The electrologist has been around for a while, I think, so I&#39;m not sure experience is the issue, but maybe something?
</p>
<p>
Thank you!

Keep it clean it shouldn’t scar,

You do you again she’s either over heating the area or the probe is to hot sincerely your local electrolissis

This is fine. Not what I like to see, but sometimes it&#39;s inevitable with a first pass on thick hair. Don&#39;t touch. You can open the yellow bumps up with a warm compress if you&#39;d like. If it hasn&#39;t resolved in a week, then I&#39;d be concerned.

I&#39;m not sure exactly, but I remember switching to a different technician when I felt the first one was just plucking hairs and not killing them. Now my face is only red and slightly swollen for a few hours instead of being red and inflamed for 5 days.

They felt like they were coming out smoothly, rather than being plucked, for what that&#39;s worth.

A year-ish out now, apologies for the late reply. I&#39;ve got some pock marks that I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re from the electrolysis or from old acne scars that I never noticed, and the skin around my chin looks more aged than I remember it (wrinkled), but more or less it&#39;s healed up pretty well. I&#39;ve been meaning to post a followup picture at some point but don&#39;t have time right now, I&#39;ll try to remember to later.

What sort of machine was it? Pure galvanic, thermolysis or blend?

Not galvanic. I think it&#39;s pure thermolysis, but not 100% sure. The electrologist seemed kind of anti-galvanic (said galvanic scars more, though my impression from research *any* modality can scar if carelessly used so I have doubts about that claim)

I’ve just started with an experienced tech that uses 16 probe full galvanic. First session had me pretty swollen. But that was ok after 2-3 days.  There was one follicle that seemed not right. Seemed to scab up more and was looking pitted. But thats closing ok now. It’s important not to pick or touch it. Simply hydrate it with aloe and keep it clean.  In and hour with 16 probes at one time (about 4-5 minutes a cycles) she’s cleared the outers of my upper lip. I reckon after 4 sessions top lip will be done.

My tech scarred me up good. I still have little bumps that won’t go away. That was 3 years ago. Also added like 10 years of aging around my lips. Electro is dangerous in the wrong hands. Do laser. Not as good but way safer.

Yeah I usually agree, but for someone with this color of hair, laser would be minimally effective.
</p>
<p>
Way too many laser operators will try to convince people with blonde/red hair that laser will work on their hair (for $$$), but it simply won&#39;t. The only option for people with Blonde/red hair is to find a highly skilled electrologist.

My electro tech uses blend and that exact area looked exactly the same. You can ask them to move around a bit more instead of concentrating on one area. This should minimize some of what you&#39;re seeing on your chin. The lips and chin area I think we&#39;re the most sensitive for me followed by the jaw bone.

Thanks. I&#39;ll definitely ask them to thin instead of clear. Did it heal for you eventually without issues/scarring? (no need to reply if not comfortable of course)

Yeah I think it healed well. I kind of treated it like a tattoo and kept putting aquaphor on it. I think the bacitracin is a really good idea I also use a spf 50 sunscreen daily. How often are your electro appointments? I try to space mine out about 7-10 days.

I&#39;ve only had one appointment so far. I have another scheduled for 1 week after the first. It looks like the grocery store near me has Aquaphor, so I&#39;ll get some tomorrow. Thank you!

Oh, I&#39;m sorry to bother you again - but I was wondering, how long ago was it that you had the treatment with effects that looked like mine? I&#39;ve read that it can be months before some types of damage are visible, so I&#39;m curious how long it&#39;s had to heal.

No bother, it can take a bit to heal and if there is scarring keep it covered with sunscreen it will fade with time. I started in that area in June of 2021 and if there has been damage I don&#39;t notice it, the hair is gone and that helped my dysphoria a ton. If you do see damage you can get laser skin resurfacing to correct it when you are done with electro. If you&#39;re ever really concerned along the way take a trip to your local dermatologist.
</p>
<p>
I feel for you electro is no fun I was lucky enough to get the majority with laser, but I also have a bunch of red, blond, and dark with blond roots. Electro is really the only way to get rid of it currently. I&#39;ve been going every week since June.
