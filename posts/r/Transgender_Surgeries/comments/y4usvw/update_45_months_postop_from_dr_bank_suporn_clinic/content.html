<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/vimasv/experience_with_dr_bank_suporn_clinic_so_far_35/">Last post (I won&#39;t really be updating anything that&#39;s stayed constant)
</a>
</p>
<p>
Hey all! Thought I&#39;d make another surgery update seeing as it&#39;s been a while since the last one. This one will be formatted a bit differently, mostly just with things that weren&#39;t applicable when I made the last post.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Aesthetics
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Structurally, not tons has changed since the last update, but again I&#39;ll try to explain as best as I can without photos (for the time being at least). My labia minora have gotten a lot thinner/more crinkly in appearance since the last update, as well as a lot smaller. While some of this might be fusion, I think most of it is just the swelling going down. In month 3 I spent a lot of time worrying about fusion, but I think the decrease in depth of the interlabial sulcus is pretty normal for most Suporn Clinic results. Most problems seem bigger when the only thing you&#39;re doing is dilating. One side appears to be shallower than the other, which is probably something I&#39;d get addressed in a revision if I go back.
</li>
<li>
As it healed, the anterior commissure got narrower (the labia majora pulled together a bit, slightly asymmetrically), which kind of &#34;extended&#34; the labia minora fold to the very top of the vulva. When this happened it seemed like a big deal, but I&#39;m not super concerned at the time being. This would be addressed in an anterior commissure revision if I got one. The whole clitoral hood area is a bit asymmetrical, as new folds got created as the swelling went down. That said, I don&#39;t think it looks overly unnatural.
</li>
<li>
My vulva still gapes a bit when my legs are spread.
</li>
<li>
The scarring is still healing pretty well, still red with almost no white scarring yet. I&#39;ve been keeping up with silicone gel scar massages twice a day. That said, the scars are still most obvious and raised on the bottom third of the vulva, towards the posterior commissure. The scars are still pretty noticeable overall since they&#39;re red, and my pubic hair doesn&#39;t really cover them.
</li>
<li>
Besides some granulation, the vulval vestibule is coming together. I have a very defined clitoral frenulum on one side, although the hood fused more on the other side. The chonburi organ is visible beneath the clit, and sort of blends into the urethra after. I don&#39;t tend to spread much, but the whole thing is looking pinker, and while not perfect, I&#39;m pretty happy. My clit is pretty small, rounded if not a tiny bit pointy, and is completely hidden unless I spread. I&#39;m really happy that it looks like it&#39;s &#34;coming down&#34; from the shaft, as in cis women. I think Bank does a really good job with clits.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Plans for revision?
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Probably. My list hasn&#39;t really changed, I&#39;ll probably get both commissures done to reduce gaping and improve appearance, maybe a urethral tissue reduction, possibly a scar revision, and likely deepening the interlabial sulcus on one side to better match the other.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Long-term pain and painkillers
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Dilation is always at least a little bit painful and usually comes in phases. Currently, it&#39;s getting better.
</li>
<li>
I&#39;ve been having less and less soreness and aching as time goes on. Since about 3 months I&#39;ve been able to sit without the donut pillow, been able to walk for longer, and pretty much resume life as normal back at university. Now, at 4.5 months, I rarely think about things like sitting and walking anymore, although I try to limit sitting on hard surfaces if I can.
</li>
<li>
I got extra celecoxib to deal with general aching, soreness, and swelling, but I won&#39;t be needing more. During my primary scar contraction phase, I got worried that it would get really bad and I&#39;d need more tramadol than the clinic gave me, but I&#39;ve been able to manage. I&#39;m using up the tramadol the clinic gave me intermittently for easier dilations once or twice a week, mostly just because I have it. Overall, pain isn&#39;t really a concern anymore besides dilation, which is really great.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Long(er)-term complications
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
I have some visible granulation in the vulval vestibule that I&#39;m pretty sure is the source of some bleeding. The clinic instructs you to leave it alone and that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be doing. It&#39;s kind of ugly but it&#39;s not really causing problems.
</li>
<li>
I had a small abscess on the suture line that was confirmed by the clinic when I sent them photos. Per their instructions, I took antibiotics for a week and it cleared up. This happened at about 3 months postop.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Depth and Dilation
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
I&#39;ve been dilating at about 7.5 inches/19 cm (measured from the labia majora) since about a month postop. I&#39;ve been able to maintain the depth I gained, and haven&#39;t really gained or lost any since.
</li>
<li>
Dilation got to its worst in months 2 and 3 as predicted (I don&#39;t remember the exact dates). Overall I think I got really lucky, as my time to depth never really went above 20 minutes besides outliers. Dilation got a lot easier right before the 3-month mark, and I went down to twice a day at 3 months exactly. Sometimes dilation will get more difficult, and when that happens I&#39;ll dilate 3 times a day for a day or two (I&#39;ve only done this for 3 days so far), which seems to make things easier moving forward. Within the past week or two, dilation has kept getting easier, and I&#39;m hopeful that I&#39;ll be able to go down to once a day at 6 months.
</li>
<li>
I&#39;ve been able to manage the work portion of university around dilation pretty well, but even dilating twice a day still feels like it&#39;s taken over my life in a sense, almost more so than when my only job was to dilate. I say this because I feel like I have time to dilate, get my schoolwork done, and sleep, but not much else (going out and socializing). I&#39;ve definitely been a lot more lowkey this year after surgery, which isn&#39;t ideal but it&#39;s not forever.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Sensation, sex, and masturbation
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
I&#39;m orgasmic, but it takes a bit more effort than before surgery. I don&#39;t think a lot of this has to do with lost sensation, but more to do with re-learning how to get there quickly, which I haven&#39;t spent tons of time doing. I don&#39;t have a very high sex drive and haven&#39;t been incredibly motivated to relearn my body, especially in the weird transition from surgery site to vulva/vagina.
</li>
<li>
I haven&#39;t had sex of any kind yet, and don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready. I still have some bleeding (I think from granulation) when I masturbate sometimes, and to be honest, I haven&#39;t really felt like communicating my early postop needs to a partner (it would probably be different if I had a long-term partner, but I don&#39;t). I have some mental roadblocks too, but I think the only way to get over those will be to push through them. I don&#39;t think having sex without disclosing will be an option for me until at least 6 months, since my scars are still fairly visible and the clinic advises against rough/unrestricted sex until then. I&#39;m trying to put less pressure on myself, and take things as slowly as I think I need to.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Hormones
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
As far as I can tell from blood tests, my testosterone levels are still undetectable, as they were before surgery (I was on lupron for almost 4.5 years beforehand). My sex drive hasn&#39;t really changed from before, but seeing as I&#39;m more comfortable in my body now, I want to try some things to get it up a bit. I&#39;m increasing my estrogen dose and adding progesterone, so I&#39;ll see how that goes.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
How I&#39;m feeling (postop depression, recovery, therapy, moving forward)
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Honestly, I think this has been the roughest part. In months 2 and 3 (after leaving Thailand and at the worst of scar contraction), I spent lots of time looking at my vulva and analyzing the result as it healed, finding lots of problems. It&#39;s not that those problems are so much gone now, just that they don&#39;t feel as significant now that I have better things to do than to look for them. Leaving Thailand and the community left me feeling pretty lonely, and I felt pretty down and unmotivated that whole time. Luckily though, I never lost any depth or stopped taking dilation seriously.
</li>
<li>
Now, I think I&#39;m dealing with a weird mix of &#34;what now&#34;, semi-unrealistic expectations I subconsciously had for healing, and the overall transition to postop life. Even though surgery is technically an immediate change, I&#39;m starting to wonder if the actual impact it&#39;ll have on my life will take almost as long as it did for hormone changes to materialize. I feel like this year more than ever I need to make sure I get enough sleep to function, so that plus dilation and schoolwork takes up almost all of my time. I think I had a mental image for this time of going out a lot, partying, dating and hooking up a lot, and that&#39;s just not the reality. I don&#39;t really think I&#39;m ready for those things as of yet. I hit my limits a lot sooner than I did before surgery, and an erratic dilation schedule tends to sabotage future dilations. I wouldn&#39;t call it postop depression anymore, but more postop melancholy: the main reasons I got surgery haven&#39;t fully materialized yet, and a lot of my day still revolves around aftercare and my limitations. I&#39;ve started going to therapy again to talk through some of this, and healing is temporary so I&#39;m sure things will be much better at this time next year. I think before surgery, it&#39;s hard to hear things like &#34;full healing takes up to a year&#34; and fully understand what that means for your life, and how it&#39;ll feel to live through it. I definitely think managing your expectations in this area is important, and intermediate healing and limitations don&#39;t seem to be as discussed as in the first 3 months.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

I hope this is helpful, and feel free to ask any questions!

OMG same leaving everyone from the hotel, and watching others who I met first leave and new folks rotate in. It&#39;s like a strange microcosm of life all condensed into a few weeks, but extra melancholy.

yeah, when i left, i was overjoyed at finally escaping there and getting to go back home, but i was also crushed that i might likely never see many of those girls again, and how wonderful a support group it was.
</p>
<p>
i&#39;m still in contact with many of them (including the OP), but it&#39;s definitely not the same as being there.

Yup this was true when I was there. It might be worth it, especially for people where postop depression could threaten dilation and depth

<p>
you can do that, but speaking as someone who stayed 5 weeks post op there, it starts getting confining, and restricting being there, and you really start wanting to go home.
</p>
<p>
being there isn&#39;t going to help with the scar contraction that makes dilation in months 2 and 3 more difficult.

Yeah I feel this too, I think a lot of it really is the difficult dilation and how much time you spend taking care of yourself. I know for me I spent a lot of time analyzing my result and fixating on things that aren’t really super important just because I had nothing better to do. I think going back to a normal life helps push you out of some of that.

Thanks great to know! Do you know if they were still able to get checkups at the clinic if they were concerned about anything?

Aww no worries! I feel like I made it sound worse than it is, overall I’m super happy with everything. I think it’s just hard to fully understand what an intense and long healing process it is (especially with the Suporn Clinic) before going through it, and how it can take time to feel at home with the results.

Thanks so much for sharing! I think the period of time you&#39;re covering here tends to get glossed over in most post SRS updates posted here. As someone who is excited but also scared going into it late next year, I really appreciate all of these posts about people&#39;s experiences :&gt;

Hi ! How did you achieve a depth of 7.5 inches with penile inversion or non penile inversion technique ?? Isn’t it reserved for those who have had sigmoid colon?

Nope, if you have enough material (regardless of technique) and your surgeon can properly utilize it, depth is more limited by your internal anatomy. My surgeon is generally very good at achieving good depths with limited donor material.
