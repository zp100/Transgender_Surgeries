I had Vocal Feminization Surgery with Dr. Courey at Mt. Sinai Medical Center. My Story + AMA
</p>
<p>
*Please note that I am not a medical professional and anything written is not to be taken as advice on practices to be taken, this is solely a recollection of my experience. Please consult your doctor for any particular medical advice.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to write about my experience of receiving VFS (Wendler Glottoplasty) and Tracheal Shave with Dr. Mark Courey at Mt. Sinai Medical Center because it seems like not much is written about him on the reddit forums.
</p>
<p>
I have nothing but praise and esteem for Dr. Courey and the Speech Therapist team there.
</p>
<p>
I had been thinking of a VFS for sometime. I had a voice that I could sing bass with. And while my feminine voice was pretty good. I always feared I could drop an octave while talking. So I was afraid of talking in public because I didnt know how my voice would sound. My partner had a hard time hearing me in public because of this.
</p>
<p>
Yet, the dysphoria was quite powerful. Sired in 20%? of public interactions. Misgendered 90% on the phone. I had gotten somewhat used to it but some days it made me feel terrible. I remember a day pre covid. I was wearing my favorite blue dress. My cleavage quite apparent. I handed paper copies from a printer to my co worker and she said “Thank you sir” I replied “It’s actually ma’am” and she left the room quite embarrisingly saying sorry.
</p>
<p>
Keeping these interactions in mind, I just wanted to prevent my voice from going into the deeper part of my register. So I looked into VFS and VFT. I was very fortunate as I have BCBS of Illinois insurance and their coverage covers just about anything a woman who transitioned would need. FFS, VFS/T etc. Insurance issues are quite ridicoulous because I reside in a state that didn&#39;t cover it so if I had had a BCBS plan they likely would not cover the things above.
</p>
<p>
Having a job that provided BCBS IL insurance I wanted to take advantage of it.
</p>
<p>
About a year ago (November 2020) I made an appointment with Dr. Courey took a plane out there with my friend Ann. His practice is in the Mt. Sinai Faculty Offices next to the hospital. I was pretty dead set on Dr. Courey because his credentials are quite impressive. Professor of Otorlaryngology, Director of the Eugen Grabscheid Voice and Swallowing Center and Chief Laryngology of the Mount Sinai Health System (from his business card.
</p>
<p>
The only person I would have trusted more was Yeson, but I didnt have the funds to head out to South Korea, especially during COVID.
</p>
<p>
Seeing Dr. Courey he was kind, polite and inquisitie he looked down my throat and said I was a good candidate for surgery if I had wanted it. He suggested I try vocal therapy first (surgery is a big change). So I opted to try therapy first.
</p>
<p>
The two big things holding me back from surgery was A. I might loose my ability to sing. He cant gurantee it will be kept) B. I wasn’t sure if surgical intervention would give me the desired results. He had mentioned I would probably sit a gender neutral to feminine range after surgery.
</p>
<p>
So I did the Vocal Therapy with one of their speech therapists (I think they have 3) I have nothing but good things to say of Voice Therapist, Leanne. She was very kind, compassionate and helpful in my sessions. I confess I wasn’t as studious with the Vocal Therapy sessions as I should have been (had about 6 sessions before surgery) but I learned helpful things about forward resonance, phonation, and vocal drills I could do to help maintain a feminine voice (which the trouble is on me, still have to do vocal therapy after surgery too).
</p>
<p>
Leaving NYC I thought about the surgery for a while. Going back and forth between acceptance of my current voice and wanting change. Still my voice dysphoria would follow me around. Talking with my partner, making sex noises with my partner, talking in public with people (I used to teach before transitioning so I was a voracious talker) It had gotten to the point where I just was worn down. I wanted that change.
</p>
<p>
My voice was personally uncomfortable for me and I didn’t like using it in public. I was still getting misgendered on the phone. I felt like it was time for me to get the surgery. I called in June to set up a surgery appointment. They were able to schedule me for mid September.
</p>
<p>
My partner and I drove from our state a few days before surgery and stayed in New Jersey with our wonderful Air BnB host.
</p>
<p>
We arrived at the Air BnB the day before surgery. Surgery prep was straightforward. Don’t eat anything 8 hours before surgery.
</p>
<p>
I was relatively calm the day of surgery. We sat in Central Park waiting to go in for surgery. However, when we got to the Faculty Offices we were told the surgery was taking place at the New York Ear and Eye Infirmary (Pre Op notes said NYEE but the appointment slip we were given showed the Faculty Offices as the place no harm no foul) so we took an Uber to the NYEE.
</p>
<p>
After a quick COVID interview I proceeded to registration where they take your name and confirm who you are. After waiting we were taken to their financial aid office to fill out paperwork (just general consent to bill and private policy stuff) After that my partner had to go to the 5th floor waiting room while I went to another floor for further preparation. We hugged knowing this would be the last time before surgery I would see her.
</p>
<p>
I was taken to another waiting room used for people preparing for surgery. After sitting for a bit. I was taken to a locker room where I was given a name tag and a locker to put my stuff in. I put my stuff in the locker and was told to change. I changed into a gown, with pants and a robe. I took off my bra but kept my undies on. I was weighed and blood pressure was checked. I was taken to another part of the waiting room which had these nice recliners. I was starting to get more nervous then. I trusted the doctors but surgery is still surgery It’s an unknown and thats okay. I took some time to pray, meditate and look out at the buildings. A nurse came and I went into an exam room where I was asked about my complete physical history. I let them know I have a nose ring which they were gracious to know about (I had a mask on so they couldnt see it) There was a possibility the nose metal could have burned. Mine was unremovable so I asked them to cut if they felt the need (which they actually didnt have to do).
</p>
<p>
After going through my physical history I sat in the recliners again. Soon after an assistant came and grabbed me and took me to the operating floor. They had a wing for folks recovering from surgery and another that had the operating rooms. They ushered me to another exam room to sit. I was expecting the doctor to come in soon but it was quite a wait and wait and my room was next to where doctors and nurses leave the operating floor so every few minutes someone would walk by the door, stare at me and look out (as one could imagine I thought each one would be the doctor) but then I got sleepy from fasting and a nice nurse brought me a blanket (he probably passed my room a few times). I’m sure I waited a good 40-50 minutes. Then I heard someone outside room say “she’s late” The same nurse that brought me the blanket came in and asked if I was so and so. Turns out I was so and so. They had lost track of me. It was quite comical, but then the Dr. Courey came in with another physician and a nurse (different nurse) and marked my neck and giving me some reassurance with a hand on my shoulder that they would start soon.
</p>
<p>
I think where I felt the most nervousness was the operating room. I had one surgery when I was a young kid so I dont remember what an OR looks like. They take me into the operating room and its about the size of a dining room. Multiple monitors, 2 big lamps and a lot of machinery. Also there were like 8 people in there including Dr. Courey. They had me lay back on the table. It was comfortable I had a pillow. I was pretty nervous then I asked the nurse to hold my hand and he held my hand and put an arm on my shoulder. I was asked a couple questions (pharmarcy stuff) One of the nurses got my IV line ready to go (but it took a couple pokes because my veins aren’t so great. I thought they were sticking 2 lines in me but it was only one. (Thanks mom for the veins :). They put a soft mask (it wasnt hard) and must be the stuff to knock you out was pumping. The nurse asked me what I was going be doing on vacation. I remember starting to tell him but then losing track of my words and then I was out.
</p>
<p>
A word on the surgery itself. This was a Wendler Glottoplasty with Tracheal Shave. The WG takes your vocal cords around your vocal hole and sews them up 33% of the cord or about 40% of the hole which should give you a higher pitch. It’s delicate because the sewing has to be done accurately and to ensure no overlap. Then the shave was just widdling down my adams apple (its not terribly big but I figure if they were gonna do one they might as well do the other, and especially helped with dysphoria. They told me that Out of Pocket the WG + Trachael Shave would be 10K. WG is 8K and the TS was 2K. I’m anticipating my insurance covering the 80% surgery provision and my out of pocket maximum is 3K. So I’m anticipating on paying around that when the insurance goes through and the bill gets back to me. We are going to pay about half up front and put the rest on a payment plan.
</p>
<p>
I woke up from surgery sleepily. I was out of the OR and in the Waiting Room laying down on a bed to the right of the nurse station. I knew immediately not to try talking (I was going to be on a 1 week complete vocal rest) and my throat had some moderate pain. I would say it was less than strep throat but more than allergies. Say Pain 4 on my subjective scale. I think the most pronounced to me was my ability to swallow was impeded. It felt like I had half of a tangerine in my throat. Breathing was okay though. Just swallowing kinda hurt. I was given a white board to write for communication.
</p>
<p>
I did feel the pain start to increase and I asked for some pain medicine (I think it was Tylenol with Codeine) which they gave me through an IV. I was relatively calm in the bed just glad after months of planning and a fair amount of hand wringing, it was over.
</p>
<p>
I asked to use the restroom and they had a nurse come. I was able to sit up and then got up and with the nurse help walked to the bathroom. He shut the door for me and I sat down to pee. After I got up they took me to another waiting bed. I started to sweat and feel nauseous. I felt a fair amount of weakness too. Just glad to get back to the bed. I asked for them to give me Zofran for the nauseous which they did. I was super nervous because I didn&#39;t know if vomiting would tear my stitches (I guess I asked before or gotten it before because this was my second dose of Zofran but I don&#39;t remember getting my first dose) I laid there for a few minutes and the nausea went away.
</p>
<p>
I had very pronounced dreams. I would dose and it felt like every few minutes I was having a different dream. I don&#39;t know if that is what the body actually does when you are sleeping or if was from the anesthesia. My ability to stay awake was for sure not there and I got nervous so I paged the nurse but they told me this was normal. So I just slept a bit more. I must have been there for an hour or so but then the nurses came in and got me ready to go home. I was able to wear my cross again and my lesbian pride ring which I felt super happy about, having had to take these off before surgery. I loved talking with the nurses (I enjoy studying different cultures) so I talked with a nurse with Korean ancestry about Kim Convenience and other things. She said she would write down a Korean show for me to watch while recuperating.
</p>
<p>
I was taken out in a wheel chair (which I totally did not mind as I did not want to walk or risk throwing up. I was reunited with my partner and she promptly got an uber. I was helped out of the wheel chair and got in the uber with my partner. While I was okay at first, I got super nauseous on the car ride back (30 minutes as we were staying in NJ) I was doing my best to keep it together. Started to get the itchiness of a cough but I suppressed it.
</p>
<p>
We finally got to the Air BnB and my partner helped me to our room. I think we were up for a bit eventually I laid down and went to sleep.
</p>
<p>
Voice rest and recovery throughout that week was challenging but not as bad as one might think. I didn&#39;t really feel the urge to talk (and this is when we were walking through NYC seeing the sites eventually). My biggest concern became coughing. Sucked on cough drops (which having the Halls ones actually contributed to my dryness. Honestly, I think I coughed 50 times that week. They were weak single coughs spread throughout the week but each time I coughed I was scared I tore the stitches (which would result in a revision surgery) The mucous also started to build up (which contributed to more coughing) but through positioning myself it was mostly okay. If the mucous got overwhelming I would go sit in the bathroom and let hot steam from the shower clear me which it did wonderfully. The throat pain was back to being manageble think like a sore throat but less than strep. By day after surgery it was gone  The ability to swallow which had some pain was the thing that stayed with me for 4 or so days but that also dissipated. All in all it was quite tolerable. I would rather have this stuff happen instead of having strep or even a heavy cold).
</p>
<p>
I took it easy the first day after surgery but I was cognizant, could move around and what not. I drank a lot of water and kept the food decently I was eating normal post surgery. The biggest concern for me was the dry coughing. We eventually got some Delsym which helped a ton, should have gotten it to begin with. I was so afraid I would tear a stitch that the fear was dampening our trip. For all that worrying anyways it didnt tear. Dr. Courey did a great job, so that was cool. We spent the rest of the time seeing the sites and also just laying in the air bnb because we are introvert home bodies.
</p>
<p>
Surgery was on Thursday, and the check up was on Wednesday. I did a good job resting  my voice. I remember only letting out a “Sorry Baby” when I accidently bumped into my partner while we were sleeping, and I tried desperately to remember what it sounded like. I felt like there were little tells that the surgery went through (I would cough and it would seem higher?, same with breathing?)
</p>
<p>
My partner was a saint throughout this whole process. She was attentive when I would need something (mostly water when I was sleepy) and would make the food we brought or order something from Grub Hub. Had some great food. Check out some Burrito Bros if you’re out that way. It was a great help, and more importantly comfort to have my partner with me.
</p>
<p>
Waiting in the waiting room of the appointment I was super nervous (did the stitches hold? would I like what I sounded like?) I paced the sitting area we were at. We went back and saw Dr. Courey and a resident. He cut away the steri strips that was covering the trachael shave and then took a peak in my throat. He then had me make noise.
</p>
<p>
My goodness it felt  like I was talking for the first time. It’s almost indescrible. I had a sense of wonder and curiosity. The sound was definitely different. The sound was definitely feminine. Well smoker mid 60s feminine but there it was. I love to sing and have a good use of my voice. The amount of effort to talk was more, my volume was degraded and my ability to move and sustain pitch was hindered. Keep in mind it was only the first day. I liked what it sounded like on the first day and was (still) am curious what my voice is going to sound like in a few months. After Dr. Courey told me the stitches held and the surgery went well I gave him an awkward high five and had an appointment with Leanne. Leanne walked me through some lip drills and glides. My voice was clearly feminine. I felt like jazzy Burlesque singer from the 20s. The voice had that vibe. After talking for a bit about voice rest now (I can talk but only for 5 minutes per hour and can only talk conversationally at this time the most important thing is no yelling. My voice needs to heal and repair itself. Also I guess the stitches could actually still tear. I’m not clear on when this risk goes away but I think the risk is less then the first week would be my gut reaction.
</p>
<p>
We drove back from New York and headed back home. I was careful to not talk much during the trip (it was also quite effortful so that dissauded me from talking) and took it easy the first couple days back.
</p>
<p>
We had our friend from Chicago come stay and I was more talkative. While it was okay,  definetly a mistake to talk. I would say I was talkng 60% less then I would have normally. Let’s say 3 hours the day she was here but my voice was tired and a bit strained. My throat hurt that night and went back to bed.
</p>
<p>
I was more cognizant the next few days and after I stuck more with the voice rest my voice went from burlesque singer to just quiet, but higher, monotone to an actually clearly feminine voice. It was when I was in my work’s bathroom that I practiced the rainbow passage and smiled as I heard the desired pitch and resonance come out. I sounded like a girl. I know I was a girl, but it helps me to feel better knowing I sound as I perceive myself.
</p>
<p>
Now as I write this, I’m really happy with my voice, I anticipate it changing over the weeks, I’m guessing it will settle in 1-3 months, but I no longer have that fear of what might come out of my mouth (will I drop an octave?) My bottom register is gone I try to access it but I really cant. I can feel more comfortable speaking in public and I just genuinely like how voice sounds. For me I was very happy with Dr. Courey and have nothing but good things to say about him

Thanks for the detailed write up! Do you have any sense of what his wait list is or total time from consult to surgery date? I currently have Starbucks insurance until then end of March 2022 and am wondering if that’s enough time to schedule a consult, do voice therapy and get surgery. A stretch, I know...

Hey there! Getting the consult was fairly quick. It was my impression I could see him a couple weeks out. I know for me insurance coverage was a big factor and I too wanted to get surgery before I eventually change jobs early next year (I want to take advantage of the market right now) I called in June of 2020 to actually schedule an appointment and I was given one 3 and a half months later. So my impression is 3.5 months.
</p>
<p>
As for therapy I&#39;m not sure about that time line. I did my therapy between Jan-March (every two weeks) and then later decided on surgery in June. Check with them and they should know more about working with your timetable.

Thank you for this 💜 I live in Germany and would have this surgery in Hamburg, but I have had too many fears to actually go for it. Your wonderfully detailed post answered many questions and brought up a few things I didn’t think about, like if the vomiting is a problem after surgery, which happened to me before after a surgery and would be pretty bad I think 🙈 Thank you again! ❤️

Hey there :)
</p>
<p>
So this was kind of a weird thing with BCBS IL and the billing department (they are awesome by the way). I was pre approved for the procedure without letter referrals. However, when I asked the billing department they asked me to provide a Primary Care Physician and Therapist letter in support of the procedure. Similar to a GCS or Hormone letter, just swapping out the name with VFS. When I asked if they had people get pre-approved and then later denied the billing deparment said yes. So they see having those two letters the safest way as geting this approved by insurance. My insurance is currently fighting with me over Vocal Therapy coverage because I didn&#39;t have those letters. I anticipate this and the VFS being covered in the end but it is quite a process in having to fight for approval when it is already covered by their actual policy.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
Check out this link as this is what I used as my decision to get the VFS. I&#39;m not sure if its BCBS IL plan dependent but if you call up and ask they should be able to tell you if those things are covered with your plan

My apologies I didnt realize I didnt reply to you. For surgery consult not long I&#39;d say a few weeks, but for the surgery itself it was a 3 month wait list. He typically does surgeries on Tuesdays (one day of the week)

Post Surgery Consult Update
</p>
<p>
I had my consult with Dr. Courey last week. We flew out to NYC and back in one day. We took a peek down my throat with a nose camera (a very bizarre sensation, like you are swallowing metal). Everything is healing well and the stitches have held. An unofficial conjecture was that my voice has moved 60 hrtz or so. I couldnt really nail Dr. Courey down for specifics but he did say the results are better than average. My voice should settle in about another monh and then we will see where I&#39;m at. I&#39;ve had mixed feelings at this stage. My voice is clearly different and thats cool, but I notice I do get misgendered on the phone (not as much) and I knew this was probably going to happen post surgery but it sure felt awful when it happened. I still have some male speaking patterns that Dr. Courey noticed that I need to work on to better accentuate my voice as feminine so in all it&#39;s still a work in progress I&#39;m happy with the results so far, but as much as I hoped it would be that magic bullet, its not quite that. I still dont fear when I speak but I am trying to be cognizant how I sound and I look to alter my speaking patterns for some time.

Hi there! I am scheduled for a voice modification surgery with Dr. Courey this summer.
</p>
<p>
May I know how your voice is now? How is everything? Are you happy with the results? Did you have any complications after the surgery?
</p>
<p>
Also, may I ask if you had to stay at the hospital over night after surgery? Or were you released the same day?
</p>
<p>
Thank you!

Hello, sorry for the late reply I can thankfully still sing and it appears to be a lower alto pitch. It feels pretty, good just knowing I can stil sing is incredibly joyful but there is still some training needed to find out where my voice will be.

How does your voice sound now? I&#39;m considering Dr. Courey too! :)

Hey there! I should see if I can upload a recording...about a year and a half out I&#39;m really happy with my voice. Now the VFS did a ton and I don&#39;t want to under sell that in anyway but I neglected to do the VFTherapy but I started really doing so about 5 months ago. Because of the surgery and actually doing the therapy, I hardly ever get misgendered over the phone and I have a sneaking suspicion it contributes to less in person misgendering. Even without modification the surgery has dramatically raised my voice. I was looking over old video recordings and its quite apparent. Keep in mind most trans women who get the vocal therapy don&#39;t progress to therapy but certainly do what is best for you. :) Happy to go into more detail or answer anything I can :)

I&#39;d also love that if you&#39;re able and feel comfortable doing so, as I&#39;m considering Dr. Courey as well!

Hi love. Your story super resonates with me. I had vocal feminization surgery too about three months ago. I didn’t notice much change. Just a light increase in pitch. But nothing drastic still get misgendered on phone and in person even. Do you know what Hz you started with and what it is now? Also when did your voice settle. Did it improve in higher pitch as time went on ? Or did it pretty much stay the same once you could start talking regularly?
