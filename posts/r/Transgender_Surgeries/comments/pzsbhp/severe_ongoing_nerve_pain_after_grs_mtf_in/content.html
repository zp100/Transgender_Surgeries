My gf had penile inversion bottom surgery a few years ago in thailand, at a very well known doctor, not naming names. She tried to stick to her dilating schedule but quickly after surgery the pain was getting worse and worse, she then had a revision done and then a pain injection done, which she was told would help the pain. It got half better for a few months and then started getting worse, back up to and over the original amount of pain. She&#39;s since then done a few steroid/pain med injections, and she&#39;s daily on a plethora of pain meds, nerve blockers and etc ( I have 4 herniated discs pressing on my spin and nerves, we are on the same meds, she takes more than I and is STILL in unbearable pain where I&#39;m even with high drug tolerance, am able to get 99% relief). She is still in a debilitating amount of pain, cannot have intercourse or even be
<strong>
touched
</strong>
below the belly button due to severe pain on a daily basis. Visibly, it appears normal and though painful and though she cant get to full depth, she can dilate, but with a great amount of pain. We know it has to be a pinched nerve or something but have zero idea what to do about it. Original doctor says &#34;dilate more and stop taking pain meds&#34;. The pain is so severe that even a day or two without pain meds is unbearably excruciating. She is at the end of her rope and doesn&#39;t know what to do and I&#39;m extremely concerned. She has consulted with a few doctors, the original surgeon, and her own primary care doctor says theres nothing more to do.
<strong>
HELP?!
</strong>

I’m just spitballing here because I’ve not heard much about this but did your girlfriend experience any complications while healing? Someone made a post about developing neuropathy after healing from complications, you can read it
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/i7w98r/neuropathy_as_a_result_of_complications/" rel="nofollow">here.</a>
Unfortunately it doesn’t have much info but it might be of use.
</p>
<p>
Additionally was dilation initially really painful? Is it possible the pelvic floor muscles could be playing a part in this too? If you can afford it and are up to it consulting with a pelvic floor physical therapist might be helpful to at least to determine why there is pain during dilation. Im sorry she is in so much pain, I cannot imagine how scary and upsetting that must be.

I think the best thing to do when you have unusual problems like this is consult a lot of doctors and specialists and to try to find one who has a clue. And don&#39;t give up looking.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if its similar, but I recall Dr Will Powers has talked about using a testosterone cream post-op for some bad pain. I don&#39;t remember where he talked about it, but I think its this cream
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also used for pre-op so you&#39;ll see those discussions too if you search.

What about seeing a pelvic floor physiotherapist? They may be able to assist and tell her what’s going on and where they think the issue is originating from.

Ok well id say definitely go to a different doctor if that’s all that doctor said. Id suggest going to a neurologist as well as looking into getting an mri done. That may tell you more. Also id say give acupuncture a try I mean if it hurts that much what have you got to lose? Im sorry its not much at all but its something at least.

Shes been to a pelvic floor therapist. Nobody has been able to help. No complications. Ill have to ask her when dilation became painful and if she ever got an MRI, she really really hates talking about this stuff because she&#39;s really guarded and basically given up on ever living a normal life. So getting specifics is really hard. Ill def check on the neuropathy post, T cream and acupuncture. Thanks!

Likely neuropathic pain from nerves that did not heal properly. It can occur after surgery but it is rare. You would not see that on an MRI. It&#39;s only visible under a microscope. There are some genetic factors to it. Unfortunately there is really not much one could do about it except removing the offending nerves. There might be some pain medication specialized for that kind of pain but this is a rough situation. Some people literally had devices implanted that would 24/7 pump out low amounts of painkillers.

She&#39;s on a micro dose of ketamine, buprenomorphin, gabapentin, duloxetine, and tramadol as a last resort but it gives side effects. Sucks because the tramadol is the only thing that works good otherwise.but yeah that&#39;s what she&#39;s hearing is that nothing can be done. I&#39;m interested in these pain med pumps though, would it release a micro dose locally?

You might want to try getting her (and yourself!) into a dedicated Pain Management program/ center. A lot of docs are weird about prescribing pain meds nowadays.  As others have indicates, consultations with other surgeons will be necessary.  You also may want to look for other patients of your surgeon who have had complications.

You would have to do research on that. I only know it exists because of some documentations about corneal neuralgia from LASIK procedures (laser eye surgery). Those were not local.
