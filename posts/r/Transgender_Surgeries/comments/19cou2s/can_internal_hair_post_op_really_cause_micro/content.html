I’m 4 years post op after having grs with Dr. Bowers. Unfortunately, I’ve struggled with some internal hair. I’ve tried everything to get rid of it to no avail. Due to experiencing some chronic illnesses, I’m worried there might be a connection between the two. I do know that the trigger for my illness was a round of heavy antibiotics in August 2023, but I can’t help but wonder if there are other contributors since my illness is autoimmune.
</p>
<p>
I remember reading a while back that internal hair can cause micro infections. Is this true? Where could I learn more?
</p>
<p>
Maybe I don’t need to worry at all. I don’t have any pain or vaginal swelling so that would mean micro infections are unlikely, right?  Thank you

I&#39;ve seen external ingrown hairs cause infection so, probably.

I don&#39;t experience any pain or swelling, though, so at least that&#39;s a good sign I hope

I usually don&#39;t care when I get downvoted pretty strongly on posts, but I&#39;m genuinely puzzled why this post would get downvoted so harshly?
