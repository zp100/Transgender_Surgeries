16 months post op James Bellringer.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t been able to dilate properly from day 1 and had to start on the smaller pre dilator, small soul source orange. Getting further in than about 7cm has always been painful but i could manage it for a while.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to 16 months post op and I cannot get the small orange one in any more. I have tried several times over the last few months and it&#39;s just getting worse and more painful.
</p>
<p>
It looks like I have lost most of my depth, what I do have is about 6 cm and it feels like the skin is stuck together stopping me from getting any deeper. I have tried more and different lubricant but it&#39;s useless. It&#39;s now at the point its just pushing in skin and my labia are getting painfully dragged inside.
</p>
<p>
Is this it just how it is now, any chance of salvaging it ?

Did you comment about it to your surgeon? Do you receive any follow up post surgery?

I&#39;m long past communicating with the original surgeon, wish I had never let him do it to me in the first place.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon that carried out a scar revision 4 months ago told me not to dilate for a week after. She said it looked OK inside and couldn&#39;t do anything about the pain up there. If anything it got worse after leaving it for a week and now I&#39;m here,  unable to dilate.
</p>
<p>
So they are no help whatsoever.
