I‚Äôm 5 weeks post op, and here are some observations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I mentioned before I had dehiscence. It was mostly confined to my left labia, and a little on the right. They‚Äôre healing up well! The wounds are pretty much closed, very little discharge, but they are generally still healing ( I.e. new skin hasn&#39;t completely grown over yet). I have a very tiny hole at the bottom of my right labia that I&#39;m monitoring, I think again, from a popped stitch at the 4 week mark. It&#39;s closing rapidly. Just putting a little bacitracin in it daily.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>

<li>
Not a lot of pain, but can feel more stitches again, as they start to come out more (normal at this post op time)
</li>
</ul>

My 5 week post op appointment, to determine if my complications need sooner revisions, was supposed to be this week. Welp, Dr. Slama was exposed to COVID and now my appointment got pushed two weeks. For all the Boston trans friends who had surgery dates with him this month, I&#39;m so sorry. I feel your pain. Your dates will eventually come. Fuck 2020.

</ul>

I have been a bit, ahem, curious lately. TMI, but my libido never changed. I didn&#39;t have a high libido but I really do enjoy regular sex.
<strong>
Well, I am happy to report I can orgasm at 5 weeks!
</strong>
That answers a big question for me, haha.

The dirty details: one Hitachi magic wand and lots of mental stimulation. I am still wary of direct finger play, so I placed the wand above where my clit is, but kept my underwear on (with pads also underneath).
</li>

What&#39;s it like? I&#39;m 6 years on HRT, and it&#39;s similar to before but different. The buildup is slower, the climax is longer and a bit more fully body, and there are electric tingles if you keep stimulating as you come down. I&#39;m betting I could try multiple orgasms.....but one step at a time. üòè

I&#39;m really happy about this! Given me lots of ideas for exploration.... we&#39;ll see how it goes.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That&#39;s it! Feel free to ask questions if you have &#39;em!
