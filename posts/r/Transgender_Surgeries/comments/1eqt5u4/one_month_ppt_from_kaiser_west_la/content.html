Hey girl. My recovery has been great. The first two weeks was hard but definitely got better after that. My surgeon was Mellisa Poh from Kaiser and the technique used was Peritoneal Pull through.
</p>
<p>
I had irritation on the entrance of the canal from dilation. That was one of the problems I encountered. What I did was I delayed increasing the size of the dilator. Waited until that was healed. And it‚Äôs important to keep it dry.
</p>
<p>
I also would like to recommend to get a toilet seat riser. It definitely made things easier when you need to go to the toilet.
</p>
<p>
For healing, I heard about arnica montana and gave it a shot. I believe that it made a difference on my healing, so i would also recommend you research about it and maybe use it when you do your surgery.
</p>
<p>
Now I can drive with seat cushion but i try to avoid going to busy roads.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you have specific questions üòÄ

Thank you for sharing! What did Dr. Poh give you as far as a treatment and recovery timeline?

Thank you. I will probably take pictures from time to time and post the progress especially with aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
At first i didn‚Äôt like it. It looked like a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù. But it was just in my head because it was so swollen and now it‚Äôs getting better ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

To be honest i didn‚Äôt expect a lot from my surgery since with Kaiser they do everything in house. And i didn‚Äôt have options for surgeon. But I am happy because i liked the results. And i didn‚Äôt pay anything since my work has really good coverage.
</p>
<p>
I wish you have that liberty to choose which country. Have you ever thought of exploring surgeons in Thailand if you can‚Äôt find a good fit in Germany?
