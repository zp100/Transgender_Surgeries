ive found other peoples accounts really helpful, so im going to do that here.
</p>
<p>
showed up at 6am, stopped eating and drinking at 12 last night. a good deal of anxiety prior to admission
</p>
<p>
after showing up i dressed and prepped. i actually passed out from them putting in the iv. kinda rough, but it was nerves. felt like a victorian debutante.
</p>
<p>
the surgeons checked in on me, we moved to the surgery room not long after recovering from passing out. while in there they ask questions (name procedure bdate, etc.). countdown from three and i was out.
</p>
<p>
i think i got some lucidity when they took out the breathing tube. i just remember coughing and a cold sensation into my vajay. then i fell asleep lol.
</p>
<p>
unfortunately waiting for my nice room took me 6 hours. so i was just kind of hanging with my nurse drinking fluids and taking drugs. my pain hasn&#39;treally gotten higher than a 5/6. its pretty manageable. the catheter made me feel like i had to go to the bathroom all the time.
</p>
<p>
now im in the nice room with my wife, sleeping and chilling.

I saw your previous posts - welcome to the other side. Sorry you felt so much anxiety - hopefully it&#39;s subsiding now?

ty! a lot of anxiety was lifted when i got out. its kind of wild. girls, you really gotta prepare for just the low key hum of anxiety building up. ive literally spent just the last month walking my dog and grinding valorant (and therapy) to stay sane.
</p>
<p>
its really wild how a lot of this is just... lifted.

Congratulations! Thank you for giving back to our community. Your recount tracks with other RBbL women, and what RBbL RN Navigator Katie, told me this week. Especially bc you are sharing on Day 0, is remarkable❣️ Surgery is behind you, now your job is to rest and heal. Hang in there, you got this, Girl!
</p>
<p>
I was referred to NYU Integrative Health Services for their Prepare for Surgery, Heal Faster program and can report the anxiety is significantly reduced. My turn comes in April and am grateful you’ve shared.
