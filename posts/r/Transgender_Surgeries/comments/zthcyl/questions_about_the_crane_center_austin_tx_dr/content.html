I&#39;ve read mixed reviews about Dr. DeLeon. I have personally seen one example of her work done four years ago and it was good. From what I&#39;ve gathered she left the practice for a period about three years ago and came back about two years ago. I specifically requested her and my consult is scheduled for April 2023. I am self-pay so I don&#39;t have insurance to deal with. I am local to Austin so that is another significant factor. I&#39;ve seen both good and bad. Everyone will have their good and bad. Like many reviews, I reckon the praises are quieter than the negatives.
</p>
<p>
So who here has recent (i.e. from 2021/22) experience with Dr. DeLeon and am I in good hands?

How much is she without insurance? If you’re already paying out of pocket, you might want to broaden your geographical criteria (because why not). Looks like someone already linked to the wiki, really great resource!

I couldn’t agree more with this statement. If out of pocket in the US with DeLeon, you’d be paying way more than what you would pay with Bank to get surgery, and Bank IMO is world class!

I personally don’t think you are in good hands with DeLeon specifically! I’ve seen quite a bit of inconsistency from her and it’s not worth paying all that money for someone to mess with your genitals the wrong way. Yes you are right, “everyone will have their good and bad” but there are some surgeons that are way more consistent like Dr. Jun, Bluebond, Bank, etc. Negative reviews are important and if there are a lot, then that’s a red flag. I also heard that the Crane Center is quite awful care wise, especially in the Austin location. There are some stories if you search on other forums of abandonment and neglect.
</p>
<p>
If you really want to have bottom surgery from them because you are local, I’d strongly recommend Santucci! He’s the one surgeon that I’ve seen consistent results from; he’s also a urologist (DeLeon is not) and is great at fixing major complications, especially according to Dr. Will Powers.

I’m here to tell you, you’re wrong on every level. She’s done great work on myself, and her staff is awesome! Sorry you’ve heard what you have, but I can tell you from personal account, she’s awesome!

For the record I am glad that you had a great experience with them, unfortunately there are many people who had not been so lucky. I know of a girl who attempted to commit suicide because of the treatment she received from them (not sure if she’s still alive or not). “I’m wrong on so many levels” is not a very nice thing to say to someone! Again, I’m really happy for you, you have a beautiful result and experience ❤️ but there are always 2 sides to every story.

DO NOT GO HERE, They cost me thousands of dollars on no refundable hotel, and paid nurse.  All because they said I called them too much.  I called them 5 times on friday and they never answered, my surgery was going to be monday so I needed info so my psychiatrist called and they told my psychiatrist that i was crazy because i called too much.  but yeah i lost money but it was a stroke of luck because my breast augmentation surgeon recommended them so when i called them and told them how they cancelled me because i called too much they said im so sorry, we stopped recommending them since they have gotten many calls with similar issues.  then about 4 months later I get a call from a reporter at the new york post. She saw my review and heard some bad things about the place too and they did an article about the surgoens are doing dangerous things and they wanted to do a second article about how they treated me as a patient .  So i found a great Doctor Hanna right here in DFW and they are the best my surgery is june 18th and they have made the experience how it should be exciting and happy.  STAY AWAY FROM THE CRANE CENTER, you can get hurt, you can lose thousands of dollars and worse they could botch you like some of the others.  Its apartment not just one surgeon its Ashley, Mundinger and the other guy.  Please im not bitter,  i just want people like me not to get hurt like i did or worse like some of the people that got the surgery and really got hurt and i heard some died and some almsot died.
