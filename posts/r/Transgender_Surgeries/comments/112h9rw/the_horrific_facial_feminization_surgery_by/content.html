I made this account especially to spread my story. I usually browse reddit but not a poster, if it in the wrong place, please feel free to delete it and I apologize in advance.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sharing this story to spread aware about this horrible hospital and its doctors, might be helpful to someone.
</p>
<p>
This story was written in segments to make it short and more readable.I wish if I could add more images, but I&#39;m mentally suffering and broken, I can&#39;t get to show more of myself.

_________________________________
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m transgender MTF, started my FFS journey in 2018, booked with Yanhee international hospital Dr. Suthat Koonnawarote for the procedures, mainly I choose Yanhee because it was the cheapest, I was tight on money and wanted to move with my transition, mistake on my side, but I did researches about Yanhee and Dr. Suthat, I found good reviews on the little info I could find and so on I proceeded with the operation.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The operation:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I did 2 operations.2019: with rhinoplasty, genioplasty, jaw shaving v line and cheek implants.
</p>
<p>
On 2nd operation 2022: I did revision for jaw shaving and brow shaving + hairline lowering and eyebrows lift.
</p>
<p>
None of the procedure came as expectation by the doctor nor did he follows any of my wishes, not even close and mostly they were &#34;random practice&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Jaw had sharp angle and required revision, chin is slanted and uneven, nose still has hump, and cheeks as if they never had any implants.
</p>
<p>
But worst of them all is on 2nd operation, asked for oval feminine hairline and he gave me &#34;M&#34; shaped hairline, my eyebrows looks worse and I have a flat caveman looking eyebrows now, they sag over my eyes and can barely lift them up, trying hard not looking grumpy.
</p>
<p>
For transgender who&#39;s trying to look more feminine, he made me more manlier than a man could ask for, with possibility that it can never be fixed, I went into deep depression with suicidal thoughts, I couldn&#39;t look at my face anymore. I cried alot.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Follow up:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I can see the shock on nurses faces during my follow ups, as how I looked before and after the surgery, one of the nurses even cried and hugged me.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Suthat was careless, I could see he wasn&#39;t happy with his own results but in all coldness he said &#34;I can try another way&#34;... this butcher was &#34;trying&#34; on his patients
</p>
<p>
I got upset and moved out of the room, I talked to some manager and he offered to be seen by another surgeon Dr.Somsak, he suggested to do another revision right away but results aren&#39;t guaranteed, and would laugh for no reasons, I swear this hospital is running by clowns. And was told I need to pay for the revision, to fix Dr. Suthat mistake...
</p>
<p>
When I filled a complaint and asked for refund and compensation, the hospital&#39;s management took by their doctor&#39;s side and said &#34;I didn&#39;t like the results&#34;... What results? Of being butchered? And paying to look worse?
</p>
<p>
After struggling with my life for 6 months, I went to another hospital hoping to fix it, the doctor suggested to wait a year for full recovery but assured me it can be fixed, maybe not as much I&#39;d hope for, and then pointed at my uneven chin and jaw.
</p>
<p>
He suggested to do CT scan and we looked at the results, not only we found that Dr. Suthat Koonnawarote did the procedures as poorly as it can possibly be done, but there was protruded screw coming out of my genioplasty bracket and unexplained screws on my jaws.
</p>
<p>
I had to undergo with another revisions for chin, jaw and rhinoplasty.
</p>
<p>
My face now looks more feminine, as I hoped it would be and feeling more confident.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Contacting Dr. Suthat Koonnawarote:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
After the first operation.
</p>
<p>
I was understandable and read that most surgeries don&#39;t come out as expected but they were far off from looking natural or normal. Dr Suthat told me it&#39;s just the swelling and should wait 6 months for final results and I did.
</p>
<p>
After a year I contacted the hospital again, my jaw wasn&#39;t smooth, it had sharp angle and didn&#39;t look feminine, my chin was slanted and uneven, cheeks as if they never had implants, and still had nose hump after rhinoplasty.
</p>
<p>
He promised me to fix them for free so I booked back at Yanhee, to be told that is the best result could be achieved and he can&#39;t do anything anymore, did not even bother to take X ray or CT scan, I was persistent and he said he can only fix the jaw angle, and along I asked to do hairline lowering and brows shaving with eyebrows lift.
</p>
<p>
Also asked for his opinion on what else would he recommend for more feminization, &#34;You face is long, you never look feminine&#34; said to me while laughing. That was my cue, I should have left but I was stupid, I was excited to get rid of my male looking eyes.
</p>
<p>
Then I was charged for the revision that I was promised for free, after traveling all the way, I went with it after convincing them to drop off 50%.
</p>
<p>
And as results, I ended with more damage by that butcher.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dr. Suthat Koonnawarote:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The doctor does not speak English as suggested by the hospital&#39;s page and some reviews, mostly speak of broken English with simple words.
</p>
<p>
Did not provide any advice, recommendation or explanation during the consultations, and would just asks &#34;What you want?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Would laugh occasionally, would wave his hand at me and say something in Thai that makes everyone in the room ( the nurses and coordinator) look at me and laughs. Felt I was a joke subject, so disrespectful.
</p>
<p>
It didn&#39;t feel I was talking to a doctor at all. But I though I was being paranoid.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Conclusion
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s all on me, I was stupid, had many signs to quit, as someone said, if the doctor didn&#39;t treat you as human, that&#39;s not a doctor, go elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Dr Suthat did not treat me as human, more like practice project.
</p>
<p>
I gambled with my life and now I&#39;m suffering for it.
</p>
<p>
I paid about $15k on Yanhee, and had to do revision for all the procedures in another hospital and spent so far another $12k.
</p>
<p>
Still have to pay to fix my eyebrows and hairline in 6 months from now.
</p>
<p>
My life suffered dramatically because of this and trying my best to recover.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m probably the first person who had their FFS gone wrong and ended looking worse than what they started with and had to go for another FFS.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend Yanhee hospital, don&#39;t gamble with your life, don&#39;t make the same mistakes I did, and find better place with real doctors.

I just wanted to mention that this is absolutely not your fault! When a doctor treats you carelessly and makes &#34;jokes&#34; around you that aren&#39;t in good spirit and refuses to take accountability for their mistakes, that&#39;s on them not on you! As a patient, you trusted that your doctor&#39;s credentials + your money would mean you would be treated as you deserve. That&#39;s what we all do every time we go to to the doctor! The simple fact is that he repeatedly betrayed your trust and simply acted like a shit person!
</p>
<p>
In contrast, you show incredible strength of character in talking so openly about your experience here. Thank you for sharing so that others can avoid this despicable doctor! You deserve to look and feel beautiful and feminine, and remember that you&#39;re not alone in that long journey: we have trans sisters all over the world connected on here 💖

Sadly, medicine nowadays became more of a business, with the law in favor of protecting the doctor in most countries, it became absurd.
</p>
<p>
I dealt with depression for long, and still get depressed from time to time when I look in the mirror and see man&#39;s eyes and can hardly pass.
</p>
<p>
Trying to cling on hope that I can hopefully fix it after few month.
<br>
Thank you for your sweet words.

Yes, I wanted to post his page and picture, but thought might against the terms.
</p>
<p>
There aren&#39;t much reviews about FFS specialists, Yanhee hospital is known for FFS and cosmetic surgeries, tho all the reviews are bit old.
</p>
<p>
All big names known for FFS are beyond my reach and I&#39;m limited with my options sadly.

Bitd when Dr. Greechert was the main surgeon I knew of people who had gone there and got work done that was decent.  However, Greechert left maybe 5 years ago?  They had a reputation for being more popular with local women.  Thanks for sharing and sorry for your bad experience.  Hugs sent.👍♥️

This can be rectified but not by Yanhee. I can give you all the contacts that I have. I do run a business here related to tjis, but don&#39;t want to breach rules on advertising you can DM me or email at &#39;

I&#39;m terribly sorry to hear that.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve done my revisions at Kamol.
<br>
After visiting many hospitals and doctors, he was the most one who looked deeply in my case and noticed my asymmetric chin and jaw.
</p>
<p>
I heard many bad review about Kamol.
<br>
He sounded like a jerk and speak in a rush, but I took that because he had many patients in queue, and there was alot of patients waiting outside his room.
<br>
Mostly transgenders with beautiful results, and one of them came out of his room who had her eyebrows shaving and lift, the initial results looked beautiful already. I almost cried for myself there.
</p>
<p>
For those reasons, I went with him, there wasn&#39;t anything to lose anyway, I was desperate.
<br>
My chin and nose looks nice, especially the nose.
</p>
<p>
Had my plans for eyebrows shaving and lift there later this year, but I&#39;m questioning my decision now, maybe I was lucky, I&#39;m not really sure anymore.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
We&#39;re in the same situation here, I know how you feel, stay strong and have faith.

I&#39;m searching for hospitals and doctors. By the end of year, I&#39;ll check and review my options, and decide after consulting the doctors.
</p>
<p>
It all feels like gambling to me, I&#39;m getting paranoid.

Thank you for sharing your story. I’m currently looking to have FFS in Thailand. Dr. Suthat is the doctor that was recommended to me. I’ve seen a few unsettling experiences with his work.

Glad my story helped you in a way, keep searching, if the doctor isn&#39;t showing much care or giving you enough info just leave, I&#39;ve been with few doctors that are rushing the consultation and wouldn&#39;t give me time to ask question or hear me out.

I&#39;ll be going in Feb to hopefully do a revision and fix that butcher&#39;s mistake.

I can keep you updated if you want, or you can use HiddenStill&#39;s wiki page for research, which I&#39;m doing.
<br>
I wish you the very best luck.
