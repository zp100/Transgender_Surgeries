Hi, I have a couple of questions: How was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. Ting over other doctors? Do you recommend Dr. Ting? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Are you planning to undergo any revision surgery or medical tattoos? How was the stay in New York? How was Dr. Ting&#39;s aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

Ok so definitely thinking about making a vlog based video about my whole GCS experience, if it turns out how I would like lol. But to keep this answer short, my whole recovery turned out to be a breeze quite honestly. There were days I had to rely on the pain meds/nerve blockers more and bled more but about 3 months I started to really settle into it and could do most activities again.
</p>
<p>
I chose Dr. Jess Ting because of his credentials and because of his love and passion for being a surgeon for this community. He is so personal and knowledgable about this stuff and his staff are the most caring people you&#39;ll ever be around. I was in such good care with them that it almost made leaving kinda sad :&#39;) so Yes I recommend Dr. Ting or anyone trained with Marci Bowers and in that network. I stayed in the hospital for 3 nights and discharged the 4th day to go recover in my airBnB where Mt. Sinai sends trained on sight nurses to you for the remaining of your recovery (a month). Best Staff Ever!&lt;3 I also answer some of these questions in previous comments on this post!

Hey, not the OP, but I got this as well. My insurance company has been asking why I got the service and it&#39;s still a pending transaction from my surgery in July 2020. The nurses are a third party service and tbh didn&#39;t know how to do much, nor was it the gender-affirming care I got during inpatient recovery. I called a surgeon&#39;s personal number on Ting&#39;s team in order for the nurse to properly help me and give me all the supplies so my partner and I could do it ourselves. Again, they were not trained specifically for GRS recovery. We used this service to get supplies we didn&#39;t get when discharged from inpatient care. I had one visit in total from the service.
</p>
<p>
They helped replace the wound dressing but didn&#39;t know anything about wound vacs. I suggest having the surgeon on call show your travel buddy how to replace the dressing while still an inpatient.

super interested in this! Also I kinda got the same stitching on mine, where he tried to make a clitoral hood, but it didn&#39;t work and left those circular scars right above the clitoris. Did you address that with him? I&#39;m trying to figure out what to do for revisions.

my previous parts were circumcised, yes! I wasn‚Äôt working with that much material given I had been on HRT since I was 13 and had my operation done at 23 yrs old so Dr Ting was able to give me about 6 inches of depth. (5-6in. is pretty standard.. I think) The peritoneal method they do definitely helps with self lubrication and overall appearance of the üòΩ‚ù§Ô∏è. When it comes to sensation it‚Äôs almost entirely in the clitoris and vulva area but I do have some feeling in my actual vag, it‚Äôs nor a good or bad feeling rather just a feeling that something is inside. hope this helps ‚ù§Ô∏è

yes absolutely! I had the standard penile inversion method done with the Peritoneal pull through so that I wouldn‚Äôt have difficulty with self lubrication, and let me tell you... she definitely splashes back ü§≠ü•∞ TMI? lol

so after surgery they keep you in the hospital for a few days then release you to go stay wherever or somewhere under their care and encourage you to walk some everyday until you‚Äôre stable enough again! 6-8 weeks usually before going back to work, and 3-4 months of no physical work is pretty standard but hey everyone‚Äôs recovery is different! Also revision type surgeries really vary in recovery length

thank you‚ù§Ô∏è and about the hair growth- I had many laser hair removal treatments done prior to surgery and will be continuing to do so now post op! I had zero hair growth before üòª and sometimes hair can grow back on the outside after depending on one‚Äôs hair growth pattern and hormone imbalance! (very common) BUT the hair won‚Äôt grow inside due to follicle scraping the Dr includes during surgery. it‚Äôs all pretty amazing to me TBH ü•∞
