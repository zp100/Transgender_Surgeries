My apologies for the repost. I had to take down the original post because I was pretty sloppy and didn&#39;t blur any of the faces and it had like patients in there. I&#39;ve re-uploaded with all the faces blurred except for those I got permission to show.

Thank you for uploading this, I was planning to start this process at BMC this year. I&#39;ll have to watch it when I get home from work. Was it overall a good experience? Outcomes have been ok?

I would say so!
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have the vagina I was expecting, which says a lot about expectations. It&#39;s more mental effort than I was intending and I&#39;m not üíØ sure I was ready for that. But what BMC provides is outstanding and I&#39;m happy with the results.
</p>
<p>
PM me if you have any questions! And best wishes with the procedure!

The more ‚Äúmental effort than I was expecting‚Äù really hits home. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs hard to understand what people are saying when you read surgery reports without experiencing it, or people just don‚Äôt talk as much about that. But yah. There should be pain management courses you can take prior.

Thank you again for taking the time to film/edit/etc your experiences. This is one of the most in-depth journals I&#39;ve seen, and it&#39;s very helpful for those of us who are just starting our transition!
