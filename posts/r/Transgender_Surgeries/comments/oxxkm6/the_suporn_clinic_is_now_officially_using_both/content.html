I just noticed that the Suporn Clinic recently updated their website to include these two pages (
<a href="https://supornclinic.com/suporns-non-penile-inversion-srs-technique/">Supornâ€™s Non-Penile Inversion SRS Technique</a>
and
<a href="https://supornclinic.com/vaginal-vault-lining-augmentation/">Vaginal Vault Lining Augmentation</a>
), where it&#39;s confirmed they are now using both the tunica vaginalis and urethral mucosa in addition to the scrotal skin grafts they&#39;ve been using for the past 20 years.
</p>
<p>
This is pretty interesting and exciting for me! I had actually already booked with them a couple months ago, as I had considered them to be my best option at the time (and I still would even if they had not added this). However, I did feel that I was compromising on the lack of mucosal tissue lining the vagina in their method. This new information makes me feel that I&#39;m making very few compromises in choosing them, which is pretty exciting. I also respect the fact that they seem to be continually improving their technique!

From memory, i thought he used the urethra around the entrance to the vagina rather than internally???
</p>
<p>
Unsure if anyone can help confirm???
</p>
<p>
But thank you for noticing this :)

Confirmed it is internally used. I&#39;m a Suporn patient.

I imagine he does both? It would only take a few centimetres to line the entrance

I saw that, that&#39;s really interesting that they confirmed that... It&#39;s kinda rough for me since I already had an orchie (and my tunica vaginalis removed along with them), but I have plenty of urethral mucosa to work with so it should still be okay. Not having a foreskin might present a bigger issue for the aesthetics, but, I guess that&#39;s why Dr. Bank gets paid the big bucks!

Judging by his work I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll deliver! He&#39;s going to be my surgeon as well.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s unfortunate but I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll make a huge difference, I personally think peritoneum has been oversold a bit, although I guess I can dream now lol. I&#39;m also happy because I started blockers at 14 and was a bit worried I might not have enough scrotal skin to go without added skin grafts or using any of the penile skin, but this solidifies the fact that donor material is kind of a non issue with their technique.
</p>
<p>
I also think this means that the Suporn Clinic now performs a &#34;state of the art procedure&#34; in almost every aspect. I chose them for their vulvar aesthetics, because I think it&#39;s more important than the lining of the vagina, but I think this really rounds out their procedure. At this point I&#39;m not really sure you could find a better clinic, unless you were looking for a full PPT or colonovaginoplasty procedure.

At least the urethra tissue they must have used already 9 years ago. Some questions recently came up in their discord server and clinic staff asked Suporn/Bank who confirmed that it is used.
</p>
<p>
Originally I was wondering where that discharge came from and also noticed lubrication from within the canal.
</p>
<p>
we&#39;re talking about PIV without lube being possible.

Yeah I think this was widely assumed by people, but I don&#39;t think they had specifically stated it anywhere public.
</p>
<p>
I imagine they&#39;ve probably also been using the tunica vaginalis for some time now, but they didn&#39;t want to announce it too early.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s also good to know as a future Bank patient, I&#39;m super excited for my surgery!!

It is not their official discord but staff is in it and they would regularely check it out plus ye most of the clients are there.
</p>
<p>
If you want to get in you have to ask other clients or wrtie the author of that pdf.
</p>
<p>
I could eventually let you in in case you did the deposit.
