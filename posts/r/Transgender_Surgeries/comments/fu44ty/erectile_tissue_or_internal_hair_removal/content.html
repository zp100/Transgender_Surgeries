Hello there, I underwent SRS about two years ago with Bella Avanessian in NYC. My partner and I love my results though there are two issues that have been downsides. I have excess tissue on my vulvar vestibule near my urethra where it attaches to the left labia minora, but it&#39;s only ever noticeable when I&#39;m aroused (so my doctors are generally confused when I mention the issue in post op appointments). In my case it isn&#39;t extreme, doesn&#39;t blockade sex and my partner doesn&#39;t notice anything off with it - though it can be uncomfortable to deal with. Does anyone else have this issue?  If so, have you gotten a revision for it?
</p>
<p>
If you have gotten a revision did it affect sensation, function, etc.?
</p>

As for internal hair - does anyone have tips for ridding that? I only have it within the first 3.5 inches of my vagina and only about 10-15 follicles at most thankfully. I have used estrogen and progesterone cream which has helped immensely - I might get electrolysis if it doesn&#39;t go away completely but it seems to be manageable.

Having erectile tissue there is actually a really good thing. The fact that it actually gets erect should also mean that it’s sensitized to estrogen

Too much can be bad and some women have revisions to reduce it.

Same, even down to being on the left side.  15 months post op, 6 months post revision.  My sensation is even better post revision, but the vestibule still engorges with arousal.  It doesn&#39;t block penetration, but it does make penetration more &#34;tight&#34;.

I had a revision at 9 months and my surgeon tried to reduce the protrusion of the vestibule, but after 3 months it was back to the same size.  I think swelling post revision pulled the revision apart.  It was a delicate revision and it just didn&#39;t hold.  However, I had very thick scar tissue along the labia minora that was excised and that made a huge different in the appearance and I&#39;m pleased with the revision.
