Looks great! I‚Äôm just curious, so I hope you don‚Äôt mind me asking, is your clitoris underneath your inner labia? Also do you have a clitoral hood cuz I can‚Äôt tell. Otherwise, it looks like it‚Äôs healing well and it looks healthy! Also if you get more yeast infections, just get OTC vagisil cream, I‚Äôve heard it works AMAZING.

Apologies that its not stabilized, I couldn&#39;t find an easy way to do it.
</p>
<p>
A couple notes, I did have some wound separation at the bottom, wasn&#39;t painful just looks gross. It resolved as you can see. I also had a yeast infection towards the end of april which just swells things up like crazy and makes them itch. No fun.
</p>
<p>
Right now I have zero pain, i&#39;ve been able to orgasm 3 times, starting at 5.5 weeks. Dilation is annoying but not painful and I&#39;m able to take the large orange dilator until you can just see the very last dot, so depth is around 5.5 inches or so. Peeing still sprays a bunch but isn&#39;t bad.
</p>
<p>
Right now my major focus is just regaining sensation but that will take a long time.
</p>

Heres a google drive folder that has all of the pictures of my pussy that ive taken in the last couple months.

I&#39;m not OP, but it&#39;s recommended that you do.  Doc recommendations generally start at 3-4 times a day and decreases over the first year to 1-2 times a week.  I&#39;ve heard many people mention discontinuing due to PIV sex though, but docs usually say PIV is not as effective as dilation for maintaining everything.

PIV: Penis in Vagina sex.  If you don&#39;t dilate it will start to diminish - you could lose depth, size, and it could form voids.

I&#39;m trying to remember what the doctor I consulted called it.  But essentially if there&#39;s a loss of depth due to failing to dilate, there could be pockets which could become infected.  (I am not a doctor, obviously...just listen to whoever you consult with).

I&#39;m 2 weeks out and at the same stage with the goopy bottom, looks almost the same on me, so it relieves me to see yours heal up nicely

Hey hun! About how long from the first post op/dilation till it got less painful/difficult? I hear when the healing is mostly completed? I just had my first session and Dr Pang is my surgeon so I was hoping you‚Äôd have some insight üôèüèª
