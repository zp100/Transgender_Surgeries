Context: I had piv with dr Sutin over 6 weeks ago!
</p>
<p>
â€‹
</p>
<p>
Moving arround is starting to feel normal again!
</p>
<p>
Walking I already could, but now I don&#39;t start hurting because of it anymore! I&#39;ve been going ln frequent walks, even spent some nights on a friend&#39;s house without dying in the process... Also, I seem to be recovering my strenght, i may or may not have picked up said friend and shaked them like a maraca for a moment :P
</p>
<p>
â€‹
</p>
<p>
Still, im trying not to force myself, even if nothing feels &#34;a bad idea&#34; I&#39;m not running arround constantlyÂ likeÂ aÂ headless chicken... I&#39;m actually being very carefull and taking care of myself very well huh
</p>
<p>
What does not feel normal is sitting! :(
<br>
It&#39;s not that baaad, but it gets anoying quick... Sitting with the donut pillow is ok, but after like 3h starts being uncomfortable. Without it hurts a bit like after 30 min, and i don&#39;t really sit &#34;normal&#34;, i just kinda cross one of
<em>
me legs
</em>
and put my foot under my ass/tigh and that way is comfortable enough, I usually sit like this to eat and in the car(more comfy this way), but for the rest i use the donut
</p>
<p>
FINGERS!
<br>
They feel nice :3
</p>
<p>
I kinda realized that i don&#39;t know how finger myself at all, sooo, i got some help! My clit is a bit less numb than before and the canal feels quite
<em>
good...
</em>
I haven&#39;t done much tho, i dont wanna &#34;overtouch it&#34; and break something. The only problem is that i need to get rammed already and thats just a no no for now
</p>
<p>
Swelling is better, my labia minora doesen&#39;t cover the hole anymore and the granulations are healing, I have a gynecology apointment tomorrow and if anything comes up i&#39;ll post.
</p>
<p>
Thats all, feel free to ask anything! And when i stop being a lazy fuk i&#39;ll post some photos
</p>

Congrats on the surgery! Your healing sounds great though you probably shouldnâ€™t overdo the maraca shaking or anything else for now. Sitting should gradually get easier. I was lucky it was never an issue for me. Good luck at tomorrowâ€™s gynecology appointment!

A comment I know you may not welcome, but even art 6 weeks I would not recommend deliberately crossing your legs. You are likely still to be placing too much strain on your introitus and surrounding tissue.
</p>
<p>
3 hrs would be max on yr Donut. Check your local baby store or Baby Care warehouse type outlet for something more comfortable to sit on. You should be alternating sitting, standing or even gentle small walks every 2-4 hrs.

Well, not crossing them one over the other, I mean kinda using one to make sure i don&#39;t put all my wheight on my genitals since, kinda using my foot to simulate the pillow, don&#39;t know if you get me?  Im quite sure there is a correct way of saying this, but my english can be quite bad at time lul
</p>
<p>
Still, thanks for the tips! And yes, I do alternate positions quite frequently &gt;:3

Lol, 11 years post op and working in my own business serving the Trans community have given me some insight into what we all do to make ourselves comfortable in our early years of post op surgery.
</p>
<p>
When I give advice I have to weight it towards the more difficult issues we may find ourselves in. You may well be recovering and be able to take short-cuts in your behaviour, because you know your body well and be aware of your limits. If this describes you - congratulations!
</p>
<p>
For others I may well be preventing them from some potential harm to their recovery. Common Sense and physical awareness are fantastic attributes.

Hi, I&#39;m getting a revision with Dr Sutin next week but I&#39;m still going through some last minute questioning. Can I ask:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
How satisfied are you with your results?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Would you recommend Dr Sutin to others?
</p>
</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>
2: Yes, but even if it&#39;s a revision I would advise you against going alone, other than that yeah, go for it!

Do you mind explaining the operation time and how long before they discharged you? I had a consult with Dr Saran from wansiri and my surgery type is PIV+graft but I had wondered about Preecha&#39;s team PAI and Dr Sutin also as a good option.. please DM me if you could.. I&#39;m really unsure on this..
