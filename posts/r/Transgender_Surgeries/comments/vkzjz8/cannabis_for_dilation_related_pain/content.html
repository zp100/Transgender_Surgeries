Just wanted to share my experience on this in case it helps others as Iâ€™ve seen almost nothing here on medicinal cannabis.
</p>
<p>
So, Iâ€™m nearly 8 weeks post op now and completely fine but I really was not fine in weeks 2-4. Dilation was uncharacteristically painful. More painful than most people report. Severe, sharp, burning pain on the inside.
</p>
<p>
First up I will say nobody should be smoking cannabis so soon after surgery without good reason but I found small quantities (0.2g combusted) of it before each dilation session (3x day) to be a godsend. Smoked pure, no tobacco of course.
</p>
<p>
I would compare the type of pain relief to opiates. You still have the pain but you donâ€™t feel it properly because youâ€™re too fuzzy. It was as â€˜mind-numbingâ€™ as strong opiates but without the addiction/danger, constipation and extreme sedation.
</p>
<p>
About week 5 I switched to dilating without cannabis, as the pain had dropped considerably. Wouldnâ€™t even think of needing it now.
</p>
<p>
At nearly 8 weeks Iâ€™m healing wonderfully. It helped get me through it without resorting to drugs which are (in my opinion) excessively strong/dangerous.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, hope this helps someone.

Thatâ€™s so good it worked for you, as an old cannabis smoker I would love to do this and might think about it after the first month or so (way to scared to introduce norms) I think Iâ€™m going to add in a CBD drink 20 minutes before to chill my mind.

I tried with cbd infusion and itâ€™s great for the dilation! Youâ€™ll be very relaxed

Thanks for sharing your experience! Iâ€™m surprised there isnâ€™t much info on this sub about it. Iâ€™ve been taking 200-500mg CBD per day and it helps a lot.

The occasional edible has been life changing for bad days in early days and honestly on emotional days just need relax and tension build up makes it difficult to dilate like today. It&#39;s actually more effective than muscle relaxers my surgeon previously prescribed in early days to make dilation easier(they stopped filling it after 1st 3 weeks).  I never needed much like 10mg of 8 messes me up so not like I&#39;m taking huge doses.

One surgeon&#39;s with my surgeons medical group &#34;unofficially&#34; almost encouraged using edibles. Like he indicated to avoid smoking it but that number of various compounds can be effective tools anecdotely but that we obviously lack research and can&#39;t medically encourage its official usage.

I found it made me hyperfixate on the uncomfortable sensations associated with GRS generally as well as contributing to an unstable psychological state while dealing with recovery but ymmv
