I was hoping to post this a lot sooner, but to be honest, I haven&#39;t really sat at my laptop and it&#39;s not what I wanted to type on my ipad.
</p>
<p>
My first day was Monday 4th - I had been told to fast from Sunday night.  I was picked up by the lovely PAI drivers, and then met the most amazing person I have ever met - and likely ever to Bune.  He explained what the day was going to entail, and then funnily enough, I did it in this order.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
First Weight, and Height, I had met the required BMI.  Filled out all the paperwork and got asked probably 7,000 times when I stopped hormones.  From there I met Dr Sutin, a lovely man with a sense of humor and good English.  He briefly showed what he was going to do, and asked to see what he would be working with.  This is quite confronting, but one word of advice, basically, when you hit Thailand, your body is not yours.  Remember that, and the confronting parts are a ton easier.
</p>
<p>
From there we went to pick out the new girls.  I had already decided on 500cc on each, but they handed me some 600cc, and whilst they looked great, I decided I would stick with the 500cc, it was a decision I questioned, and even sitting in the operating theatre wondered if I made the right decision.  Spoiler Alert, I was happy I stayed with 500cc - I didn&#39;t want big boobs, I wanted bigger than I had.
</p>
<p>
Then it was off to the nurse to get the bloods all done.  Then I could start to eat and drink...  But I had to stop eating at midnight, and only clear fluids from 6am Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
From there I was driven to a hospital for my two pysch appointments.  These took about 10 minutes each, when did you know you were a girl, when did you start hormones, Do you live openly as a girl.  Do you like wearing womens clothing, and do I have a boyfriend.....  No I have a wife I&#39;ve been happily married to for 23 years, would you like to meet her - she&#39;s just outside...
</p>
<p>
Then it was back to PAI to confirm everything, reminding that it&#39;s not surgery I can reverse.  I couldn&#39;t pay at that point, because since I&#39;m an old bird, they wouldn&#39;t want me dropping off the perch, so I would have to attend cardio, ECG and something else, I cannot remember on Tuesday.  We were then driven back to our apartment.
</p>
<p>
Tuesday I went and got final sign off from the cardio, taken back to PAI, paid my money, and returned to the Apartment to start the Poo Volcano...  Seriously..  It goes off....  You send a clear &#34;poo&#34; photo to  Bune and then you can stop drinking.
</p>
<p>
8:30pm I was picked up from my apartment and driven to the hospital where the next morning - I would be fixed.  The room was amazing, and look I could do a whole section on the nurses, but simply put, you are treated like royalty, they are always around, courteous, and funny.  Get to know them, you&#39;re there 5/6 nights, they can make your time so much more enjoyable.  I also took in a chrome cast for the TV - This was an absolute life saver.
</p>
<p>
I then was changed into the green gown (with pockets) that would cover my lily white tush for the next 6 days.  An IV was then put it, and it was time for my last sleep before surgery.
</p>
<p>
5am Wednesday I was woken, and told to shower with the special cleaner, and at 6:30am was taken down to the surgery rooms where I lay while they set up.  I was calm, at peace, I took one last look at my penis, and soon enough I was being put to sleep.
</p>
<p>
I awoke about 2:30pm in my room, a morphine drip, some pressure on my chest, and a ridiculous amount of cover over my groin.  I wasn&#39;t in pain, and my wife and daughter were both there to see me start life - finally with the right parts.
</p>
<p>
I was able to eat, and look this is one complaint I have, every meal, including breakfast comes with Cauliflower and Broccoli.  Over the following days I finally settled on what I liked, but if you have people coming to see you - Starbucks and Aunty Anns Pretzels for the win.
</p>
<p>
After having a look inside my green gown I drifted in and out of sleep until about 7:30am on Thursday Morning.  I will recap the next week tomorrow, but for now - this was the view.
</p>
<p>
Finally Thank you to both a friend of mine that gave me all this information from a family members surgery 6 weeks before mine, and the amazing writings from RealHumanNotAnAlien.  Both of these amazing humans helped me a lot in the lead up to surgery.
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer any questions that would be covered up to this point.
