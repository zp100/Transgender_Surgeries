As the title states, had my vaginoplasty done Wednesday morning, discharged today and now just recovering. Hit me up with questions.

Hi another Keelee girl.  I am also going to have to recommend going to someone else.
</p>
<p>
Had I to do this all over again would definitely gone with a different and more experienced surgeon. I&#39;m actively planning a revision with Bowers or McGinn, that Macphee says is not advisable.
</p>
<p>
Basically, Keelee left excess erectile tissue under my labia minor. When I am aroused a stump of what was there before appears. It&#39;s hugely dysphoric and in spite communicating this, my surgeon says she will not consider a revision.
</p>
<p>
Keelee was awesome up front and law of probability says she has probably had a few raving success stories. I&#39;ve since been in touch with other Macphee girls who have the same complication I do.
</p>
<p>
Do your homework and use discretion!

For one she&#39;s very inexperienced. She&#39;s only been performing bottom surgery for roughly 4 years. Secondly she lies compulsively. She claims to have trained under Bowers but that not true. If you go to Bowers website and look at alternate surgeons Macphee isn&#39;t listed.  Macphee also claimed at another point to have studied under toby meltzer and another time she told me she studied with thai surgeons. She told me I would have a vagina that would produce wetness like a cis woman&#39;s this was a huge lie. As for the results, she seemed to carve a substantial amount of tissue out so the vagina doesn&#39;t look plump at all but deflated. I have a ton of erectile tissue with is unsightly and Macphee refuses to remove it. This is something several other patients of hers have expressed frustration and despondency over on here. I alao have a ton of hair inside the vaginal canal. She told me initiate that she would scrape it when I asked. After surgery I asked her again and she said she &#34;zapped them&#34;.  I have almost no feeling in my clitoris and it&#39;s been nearly a year and a half since surgery. There&#39;s no mucosa inside the vaginal canal which is another thing she lies about. When you bring these issues up to her the entire demeanor changes and she attacks you, declines to help.  The staff at the hospital you are staying are also very uncomfortable with trans people. I was misgendered constantly. You&#39;re also ignored by the staff bc they seem to seem the other patients who are there for things such as spinal surgery or knee replacement as more important.

Thank you. I&#39;m going to try and see about getting a revision with Ting in January. I know things won&#39;t be 100% fixable and I&#39;m still going to have to spend a lot of money to get this fixed. Going to her is the biggest mistake I&#39;ve ever made. Good luck with your transition.

FWIW, I went to KM and I am super satisfied with the two surgeries she performed. I had a trach shave and genital reconstruction done, both turned out well. Recovery was super mild because she&#39;s a talented surgeon. The nurses were amazed at how realistic things looked when they were checking the surgical area immediately post op
</p>
<p>
The only thing I&#39;m iffy about going to her for is facial work because I don&#39;t know that she&#39;s that experienced with it
</p>
<p>
I have a few small things I would like to have revised for the sake of making my vulva look more cis passing, but outside of that, I&#39;m totally satisfied
