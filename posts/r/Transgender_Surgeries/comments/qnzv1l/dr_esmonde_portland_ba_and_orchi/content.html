I got to say I love him! He is such a down to earth person a very kind. I got that ever since the first consultation. I am also a person that likes to have control over most things I can in my life and this man made it so easy to trust him. I think it says a lot.
</p>
<p>
He is &#34;new&#34; but has plenty of experience with trans surgery since he practiced at OHSU. I lucked out and had a very fast appointment but it seems like he&#39;s also getting booked out like everyone else.
</p>
<p>
I am also thinking of fat grafting and base on my results so far I would go back to him again. I didn&#39;t do it due to finances.
</p>
<p>
Here is how it went.
</p>
<p>
First consultation.  We talked about my goals and sice of breast i wanted. I wore a bra that made me feel super confident to show him my goals. That help him a lot to understand size. He very calming talked about all the risks, procedure, after care etc. I really felt like all the attention was on me and there was no time constraints in his part so no hurty at all. Also the staff in Portland clinic are super nice and caring. I left with no questions at the time but was offered to call any time to ask more questions. We set up surgery dates which was only 2 months away. That is unheard of in Oregon specially on Medicaid so I say yes.
</p>
<p>
Telehealth consultation I had couple of questions so they set up a video chat so I didn&#39;t have to drive from Eugene to Portland. Only about 2 hrs away but it made easier on me not have to schedule around work and the consultation was couple days after I ask for one so very fast.  Even though it was online I felt again that I had his whole attention. It was a little funny that he was not aware of where the camera was and I saw mostly half of his face. This didn&#39;t bother me. In fact made me feel connected more to a human.
</p>
<p>
Pre-op Tues Nov 2nd. Nothing fancy or new. He took a look again, went over everything again and chatted again about size. I felt like we where both in the same page. I was given all my post op goodies and I went back home. Never got nervous since he was so calm and the way he explained everything was concise and easy to understand.
</p>
<p>
Day of surgery Thursday Nov. 4th I showed up to the hospital at 6:30am for check in. Stay the night before at a hotel 2 blocks away from the hospital. Once checked in I was called to the surgery waiting area. No one missed pronouns or my name. Even though I legally change my name to a female name I still go by a different nickname and everyone used it. I was impressed and I didn&#39;t have any bad experiences before surgery. Of course they ask you a million times what you are getting done every time you talk to someone new but it was just another day for them. I was told a couple of times by nurces and anesthesia folks about how excited they where for me which seem genuine and not empty words. The anesthesiologist showed up and he and his assistant where super funny which I appreciate. Then Dr. Esmonde shoed up. In leggings a shirt and back pack. He sat down talked to me again chatted about my hotel stay and such. I didn&#39;t take this as unprofessional but just as a human talking to me whiched I liked. 30 min later the anesthesiologist assistant came to take me to surgery. Again super funny guy. He asked me about my anxiety and I told him it was very low and that the source was mostly for the anesthesia part and not surgery. He the said &#34;okay I just gave you something to help with that, if you like it tell me I have more where that came from&#34;  I laughed and I started joking about his driving skills as he was pushing me Dow the hall. 5 minutes later I was out. I just remember waiting for the elevator with everyone that was having surgery that day.
</p>
<p>
Post-op.  Woke up at the recovery room. Some one told me I was being their best patient that day. Later to not poke an eye out as I was rubbing my eyes. I felt pressured on my chest and I remember crying since I know it happened and I was out of surgery. All that was less than a minute. Then out again
</p>
<p>
Woke up again now I was being pushed down the hall. Out again. Awake in another hall, Dr. Esmonde is talking to me. I really dont remember the conversion he was wearing scrubs that time. Out again.
</p>
<p>
Woke up again in a room maybe just gotten there but who knows. Nurse is in the room getting things in the IV. I asked for another pillow. Great nurse and team. She got me some jelly, water and icepacks. She followed the Drs order on pain killers. I had a self administered paint killer button. Sounds that he does this with all his patients. I hardly used it. Only pressed it 5 times in about 24hrs. Nurses where impressed but I really didn&#39;t needed I was comfortable for the most part. I do gotta say that the hospital staffaybe need a little 101 from Dr. Esmonde. One nurse while checking my orchi incision she was looking on the sides. I had to tell her that the incision should be in the middle.  At night nurses changed a d i got two one seemed like was shadowing or training which is common in a school hospital. They where both very nice and we joked around.
</p>
<p>
Friday Nov. 5th Of course I was awaken a bit since they needed to do meds and such. Still had good sleep. I woke up around 3:30am after they change my antibiotics. Still no much pain. I was able to finish a online certification test for work that morning.
</p>
<p>
By 6am my back was killing me and I really wanted to walk. nurse change again and I got the same older nurse. Super kind.  She needed to call her mom since it was her b&#39;day, wonder if she did. I reminded her once I was leaving. Around 8 we heard from esmonde and I was okay to walked so we got out of bed and went to the restroom. I was still on IV. I had just order lunch when Dr Esmonde showed up. Again in running pants and a t-shirt. He then removed the ace wrap around my chest. It was very nice to get rid of that think it was biting into my skin. He showed me the massages that I neended to do and put anoth band to stabilize the implants. He then check my orchi incision. I started tearing up he help me button up and I had to give that man a hug.
</p>
<p>
He dischargede and by 2pm i was in the car back to Eugene. I am now here typing this because I can&#39;t sleep. Pain still low and I am a happy camper.
</p>
<p>
I have little to no brushing in all of my incision. I already have nipple sensation on both nipples. The incision and as through the Arreola which scared me a little but I already have sensation. I am starting to question if I want him to do my vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
I will take couple of picture and then make a timeline later on.

I assume this is Nick Esmonde, who recently moved to the Meltzer Clinic?
