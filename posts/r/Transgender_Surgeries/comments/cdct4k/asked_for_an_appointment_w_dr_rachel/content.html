Well, I messed this one up and deleted the original by accident! Still learning how this works. Several weeks ago I met with Dr. Karen Boyle and she recommended Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner for my surgery. I read that she is now scheduling surgeries out to ‚Äò21. My psychologist suggested I schedule a consult soonest. I went online yesterday and asked for an appointment. I received a response stating the office will contact me in one business day to set up an appointment! I‚Äôm excited and hopeful‚ù£Ô∏è

I did too and was told ~18 month wait for initial consult exam by surgeon and urologist (cost $470 for that), unknown wait after that for actual surgery... best guess 6 months minimum and total ballpark estimated cost for cash pay, no-insurance patients like me was ~$125K

What? That&#39;s huge, one could have SRS six times elsewhere with that amount of money.

I know.... I was kinda blown away by the quote. The 18 month wait to be seen in person for the preliminary exam didn&#39;t shock me that much, knowing that the well-known first tier surgeons are in high demand now but was expecting total cost for a cash-paying patient to be maybe $40-45k max. I guess since this surgeon is in such high demand, and $125k is probably about right for how much they&#39;re milking health insurance companies for these days, that no matter who&#39;s paying, the price is now the same because they&#39;ve got a career/lifetime supply of patients lined up and they figure they might as well demand the same amount of money for each case. That&#39;s my speculation as to an explanation anyway. The problem ror me is I Live in Texas and since that rat bastard judge struck down the trans protection clause 1557 of the ACA, it&#39;s damn near impossible to find health insurance in this state that hasn&#39;t reinstated trans-exclusions back into all the policies they sell. Only a few really large companies still cover trans-related procedures in their employee health insurance plans and fat chance I could ever get hired by one due to my age... and I realistically cannot move to another state at this time, but I do have a sizeable savings account now that I could pay a
<em>
reasonable
</em>
amount for GCS, and I need to do it soon because I&#39;m getting old and recovery is gonna be rough enough as it is, and I still want to have enough good years of my life left to enjoy my new hoo-haw if I can ever get one.

07/16/19: So, today I received a call from NYU Langone Health! They kept their promise to contact me in one business day. I‚Äôm registered in their system and was given my consult date for Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner. All the rumors are correct. My consult is in 18-months! However, I was advised that once I‚Äôve had the consult, the time to surgery is nowhere near so long a wait. I  W I L L  WA I T!!!  P.S. And, as suggested, I will call every week to check on cancellations‚ù£Ô∏è

10/05/19: Update, I received my consultation package (no joke - 25 pages) from NYU Langone within about two weeks of the original call. The information is very detailed and there are a number of tasks I must complete
<em>
</em>
before** my consultation.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, among the most critical is the stapled two-pages entitled
<em>
SURGERY REFERRAL LETTERS
</em>
. It covers their requirements for Gender Affirming Surgery. They are very clear that I am expected to submit the required mental health referral letter(s) prior to the surgery consultation appointment. Excerpts follow:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
. . . Surgery cannot be scheduled until all letters have been received and meet their requirements outlined in the document. . . .
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Chest/Breast Surgery: One referral letter from a qualified mental health professional.
</li>
<li>
Genital Surgery: Two referral letters from different qualified mental health professionals who have independently assessed the patient.
</li>
<li>
If you are currently receiving hormone replacement therapy, an additional letter from your hormone provider is required. This letter must be dated, signed, and indicate the month/date/year of the start of hormones.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The page lists their specific requirements for mental health referral letters
</p>
<p>
. . . appearing at the bottom of the sheet: &#34;ALL LETTERS MUST BE DATED WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF SURGERY AND SIGNED BY THE PROFESSIONAL&#34;
</p>
<p>
I have two of the three required letters.
</p>
<p>
Stay tuned . . .
</p>
<p>
Update: 03/31/20 Today I had my consult w/Dr. RBb-L and members of her team via video visit. If interested, look
