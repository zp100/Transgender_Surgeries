Looks fine so far, keep it clean and dry, especially the bottom left (your left, picture&#39;s right.)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
You have some slough and infection but it&#39;s not severe yet. Monitor it, and as mentioned keep it as clean as you can. If you have some sterile gauze, use that to pat dry after cleaning, then stay bare to the air.
</p>
<p>
As for a stitch or two popping, it&#39;ll take a bit longer to heal but won&#39;t prevent the healing.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
If the infection gets worse consult your surgeon.

Thank you for your detailed reply. Is there anything else I can do? Ie. Sleeping on my back rather than my side?  Should I be trying to be more mobile or less mobile in the interim?

That advice is going to vary by surgeon so I suggest going back to any docs they gave you.
</p>
<p>
If they did NOT give you any documents: My surgeon does advise sleeping on the back to allow more airflow. As for more/less activity, I don&#39;t know how much you&#39;re doing, but my experience between self and others is that there&#39;s a sweet spot where you do a little but don&#39;t tire yourself out, and gradually increase while you heal. This early on, if you&#39;re going for 3 hour walks every day or lifting weights or anything that&#39;s probably too much, but some mild activity (generally) promotes healing. Again, surgeon&#39;s advice is the best resource.

looks very similar to mine with the separation, I&#39;m on day 16 and when i asked about the white pus the advice i got was to soak a gauze pad in saline solution(either store bought or homemade) and put it under whatever pad you use to keep the wound moist and clean. but i would ask your care team what to do. the separation isn&#39;t anything to worry about in a week it will look much better, I get the anxiety you have because I&#39;ve already cried multiple times over that issue. üòÅ

And for the love of everything just dab down there when you clean her up from the drainage!!! that will definitely risk your stitches if you rub at all, i only rub gently if the blood is caked on!

I highly recommend activon cream which medical grade manuka honey, it really helped with wound sloughing, I suffered a bit myself with wound dehiscence and it worked wonders.
</p>
<p>
Also as others recommended keep clean and dry,  Dove Baby brand sentivive moisture fragrance free wipes were amazing for me as well.
