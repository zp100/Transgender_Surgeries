Been calling and keep getting leave a message, I&#39;ve left two but haven&#39;t heard back. Is anyone like, on the waiting list there currently? Do they have an email or alternate contact method? I&#39;ve called the &#34;for appointments&#34; number which always is a leave a message, and the other number i talked to someone but was then just transferred to the message again. Curious if anyone can help, or offer any info on the doctor in general. Thanks!

If you can&#39;t get ahold of anyone, I would never bother calling back and find some place better.

I have very few options that my insurance will cover unfortunately. I may be able to pursue an out of network exemption if i absolutely can&#39;t get through and can convince insurance of that. I have heard from my regular doctors office that they are short staffed still and might start surgeries again in June. If i need to travel or save up, it would be a looong while away, so I&#39;m going to focus on the local options for now. Which as far as I know are Thom Loree also at ecmc and Dmitriy Nikolavsky in syracuse- which I&#39;m not sure even counts as in network.
