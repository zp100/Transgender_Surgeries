You never know who&#39;s going to operate you when Kamol&#39;s team puts you to sleep but you are lucky to have a good result

I thought Kamol was supposed to be a butcher? Everyone says to avoid? Your results are amazing.

Thing is he has so vastly different outcomes that it is kind of a gamble.

I think he does ghost surgery.  So its a lottery on whethet kamol himself operates or one of the 10 other docs or juniors.
</p>
<p>
Theres no way only 2 or 3 surgeons handle an entire hospital with that many operations, def lots of other surgeons working there.

From what I know, those who have issues did SRS PPV, whereas mine is an SRS via colon. And thank you for the compliment (:

He used to do all the actual surgeries but in the last few years it’s evident he’s letting interns get scalpel time and  once your asleep who knows now ? and he  may initially be there at the start but ? - any outcomes lately  just don’t jive with his old skills and outcomes he used to do say 5 years ago that others got in the past - this is a good outcome above  and he must have done the whole thing himself start to finish with obvious surgical nurses etc. - they have “I-T” staff and a board of directors watching the internet of complaints etc. so maybe things are changing however one died about 4 - 5 months ago found passed on at the Kamol Hotel in her room from Japan and the the other an English gal doing the reserving for surgery as an employee for Kamol an ex-stand up Comedian from the UK that was put in position of great “stress”  because of bad surgeries being done by inexperienced intern surgeons given a chance learning the ropes and drove her back into alcohol addiction it appears trying to cope with the place and trying to help patients but dealing with the money grabbers who have an investment for profits at the Kamol Hospital ? - they said it was an asthma attack sleeping and died the so called cause but ? - I don’t think so ? - it appears well covered up covering their butts - they gave her a good send off but something is amiss and the real reason of her death quite frankly ?

There&#39;s a whole lot more to that story, my wife met Darcy while she was there for her surgeries.  While she worked with Jaime Lee, she said Darcy was a sweet woman as well.  Apparently, she told me there was some question as the ex wife showed up 2 days before it happened and there was a whole bunch of stuff that was discovered.  Possibly a criminal investigation into the ex wife going on, but not sure.  Kamol did my wife&#39;s colon SRS and it is perfect.  We are very active and have no issues.  But, as my background is healthcare, we made sure she followed the aftercare routine to a T.  Yes, there were some UTI issues at first, but they quickly passed and have not been an issue since.

By far the best Kamol result I&#39;ve ever seen. But anyone looking should be aware of his generally very negative reputation.

How does it look a good already after two months?

And how is feeling, lubrication, etc? How does the inside and your clitoris feel?

If it’s not too personal to ask, how’s the sensitivity? Also I’ve heard SRS via colon can cause it to smell really weird, is that something you’ve experienced?

I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a weird smell haha. There&#39;s definitely a smell when you&#39;re wet, but tbh the smell is kinda (strangely) affirming to me. Not a bad smell at all, pretty neutral smell in my opinion. Not fishy or anything.

That&#39;s nonsense!
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t really care who operated on me.
</p>
<p>
For me the only thing that counts is the result!!!
</p>
<p>
And I am absolutely satisfied with my SRS as well as my FFS and VFS, which I had carried out at Kamol Hospital.

I guess so! I have a lot of trust in the Kamol Clinic and find the PPV method quite interesting.
</p>
<p>
But ultimately, a lot of healing depends on individual life circumstances - which is why I often see the reviews of Kamol as very subjective. Circumstances such as age, alcohol consumption, physical fitness, nicotine consumption and, last but not least, self-discipline when caring for wounds are always different.

Wow incredible healing speed. It&#39;s so amazing to see on this sub how some people are healed within the first two months and other people are still raw at 4 to 5.

There’s lots of info on this surgeon and Thailand generally in the wiki here

You MUST use a web browser to view that. Do NOT use a reddit app or you won’t see all of it, and there’s a lot.
