I’ve seen cis women with an identical forehead. I feel like you look entirely unclockable, fem, and attractive.
</p>
<p>
I’m really harsh about gauging that stuff, like unhealthy so, especially with myself. I feel like you 10000% pass better than I do.

I agree. You have striking features but nothing that stands out as masculine or that would get you read as trans. I think it looks great with your frame and you should embrace them. You look like a cis woman and you were to get more surgery to make your face even softer you would look like a different cis woman, but one that&#39;s more average looking.

I think maybe I’m just asking for too much. I’m trying to be grateful for how I look now. Sometimes it helps when I look at my before photos. thank you for you kindness though

Oh, there was no kindness in it.  It is honestly what I think!

But beyond my objective perceptions, I do hope you will give yourself permission to believe yourself to beautiful, because you are.

Wait my voice was in this, I didn’t even realize. But anyway no vfs, I just self trained it. No classes or anything. Just little by little I figured out how to keep it at the right tone and pitch. Took years tho

Hi everyone. So I got FFS 4 months ago on May 4th, 2021 with Dr. Ozaki from UCLA health. At first I was so happy with results. For some reason I really liked the swelling in the beginning. Idk if it was because it gave my face so much volume and sort of evened it out? But each month my swelling has gone down more and more and I feel like I’m starting to see the final results and I’m no where near satisfied. I wish I would have done more. Thing is, I don’t know exactly what else I need. I can’t figure out why my face looks so ugly and masculine to me. Any suggestions on future procedures I should get done or any opinions on why I feel this way. Dysphoria just hit me like a train today and these past few months had been so euphoric. I feel hideous and i don’t know what to do :(  I’ll drop a video of my face as it is right now. Also some with makeup. I feel like I look fine with the makeup but bare faces I feel so gross.

I honestly think this is observer bias.. you have spent so long seeing yourself as male, that you subconsciously associate your features with masculinity, even if they are objectively not.
</p>
<p>
I know it sucks - I get it too quite often (had FFS in November last year, I have pictures on my profile), I think it just takes time to unlearn and accept to see those features as feminine.
</p>
<p>
You look cis to me by the way, you&#39;re beautiful.

You might be right. I guess it doesn’t help that I’m in an environment where some people still refer to me as he/him and deadname me from time to time. It really messes with my head and makes me doubt myself

The measure isn&#39;t how people who knew you before react. Like you, they can&#39;t ever remove their previous knowledge, and that influences things. My own family though my FFS was &#34;more subtle than they expected&#34; and that it &#34;hardly did anything&#34; yet I cis pass to strangers now, which I didn&#39;t do before. Strangers are the only non biased source you&#39;ll get unfortunately :

I had FFS nearly 3 years ago. I spent the first 6 to 9 months thinking it had failed. Just like you, I was cis passing, but I couldn&#39;t see it, because I saw little lingering imperfections. I wish I could tell you that one day you&#39;ll learn to see yourself accurately, but I&#39;m still not at that point. What I will say though is that eventually it will become impossible to avoid the fact that its your self perception at fault, not the results

I saw Dr Ozaki for a consultation for FFS. To me, he seemed cold, like he didn&#39;t care about me or the surgery. He offered me options for what I want in my FFS surgery, but I didn&#39;t know the answers. He asked how I want my chin, jaw, forehead shaved and at what angle? I kept asking what he suggested, but he didn&#39;t give me his opinions, or he did very little.
</p>
<p>
When I see
<a href="/u/edenrodriguez" rel="nofollow">u/edenrodriguez</a>
surgery results, you look beautiful and natural to me. I would never know. I have small features and am smaller framed. But I feel full of fear making a decision.
</p>
<p>
My insurance will cover Ozaki. The other doctors I want to see are Toby Mayer, Kyle Keojampa, and Des-Champs who will not take my insurance. The other doctors on my list to see who do take my insurance are Dr Mittenmiller and Dr Nance Yuan.
</p>
<p>
Its hard to decide if I should spend the amount of a college education for this surgery or go to a doctor that takes my insurance. When I see
<a href="/u/edenrodriguez" rel="nofollow">u/edenrodriguez</a>
surgery results, that gives me hope. Has anyone else seem Dr Wayne Ozaki or has any other advice? Thank you

You&#39;re most likely referring to your orbital area. Did yout surgeon do a proper type 3 setback? Usually, insufficient sinus setback is what makes orbitals still pop out

I don’t know tbh. I know he shaved down the brow bone and said he would open up the orbitals. But my forehead still looks very sloped to me. I almost feel that I need a fat graft to my temples

You gotta ask what exactly they&#39;re gonna do to you before they open you up lol. Every good FFS surgeon would recommend doing a &#34;Type3&#34; reconstruction for maximum feminization

Honestly besides my forehead, my right side of my face is my biggest insecurity. It looks so weird compared to the left side which is a lot softer and more feminine. I’m not sure if I should get filler in my cheeks or something?

Well, I see the forehead area that is troubling you.  The orbitals could have been more aggressively burred.  The forehead angle is still a bit unusual for a female.  Overall, I think you are passable and pretty: no cause for concern.

Yea I was thinking that too but I wasn’t sure whether the orbitals needed to be set back more or if I just needed a fat graft above them. either way I just wish it could’ve all been addressed at the surgery table. Now I’m considering a second FFS

They might have done all they could in terms of shaving.  You might need some bone paste to change the shape of the areas above the orbitals.  I think the Thai surgeons tend to be better with augmenting.

I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m just a little bit confused.... you are gorgeous. What part are you unhappy with? Also I hate you just a tiny bit for hoarding all the boobs for yourself. But seriously you look like a girl. I don&#39;t think I would ever even come close to clocking you.

Honestly you look great now. Also worth remembering that FFS can take up to a year to see the final results. I&#39;m 3 months out from it myself and I keep having to remind myself there&#39;s still a long way to go.

You look unmistakably like a woman to me. I&#39;ve seen many women who look like you.

I felt the exact same after my FFS on July 26th with Angela Rodriguez at Align Surgical. Hated the results then loved them and then hated them again to the point that I didn’t feel passable or cis at all despite everyone saying otherwise. Dysphoria is so hard to deal with, but honestly your results are beautiful and you’re gorgeous 😍 definitely cis passing.

I personally see nothing masculine about your face , not only do you look femme but your face is very pretty too. Dysphoria is a bitch babe. Hugs ❤️

Hey sis you look beautiful and very passable. I’m looking into osaki but a lot of the girls I see that went with him their results look very subtle and I want more aggressive.
