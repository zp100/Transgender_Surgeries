What do you guys think? Personally I love the aesthetic and think it looks decently ‚Äúnatural‚Äù. Still waiting for the scars to fade a little more but I‚Äôm happy with Avanessian‚Äôs new minora definition technique.

If it‚Äôs not too forward, can I ask how you paid for it ? I looked into mt Sinai a few months back and they quoted me something crazy, like $90k
</p>
<p>
Looks incredible though.

You should have your insurance covers it. Mine covered everything but my maximum out of pocket (~1.5k). My insurance actually had a few glitches on their end when the hospital sent them the bills so it didn‚Äôt go through and I got to see the out of pocket price by accident. It was actually in the ball park of 50-80k üò¨.

They take insurance. After my insurance it was like $500 I think, because that was what was left to reach my out of pocket max.

I believe they do, but I think it has to be NY Medicaid.

Their website has a list of insurance they accept and you can call them to confirm.

I‚Äôm still at my maximum depth since surgery date. It‚Äôs about 6.75-7 inch. Sensation wise, are you asking about the vaginal canal or clitoris? My clit is functioning properly and I was able to orgasm at 2 months. The canal is pretty dull. Not sure if it will change over time.

Me? I haven&#39;t seen her yet. But I scheduled my consult originally in winter 2020. The virtual (mine was just a phone call) was a week after my first phone call made to mount Sinai, then she scheduled my consult, psych eval and some other appointment all on the same day June 9th. I don&#39;t have a bunch of hair down there so hopefully from consult to surgery isn&#39;t too long!

Thank you üòä. So recovery isn‚Äôt 100% linear but general gist of it is I was quite immobile with occasional discomfort for about 2 months. 3rd month I could move around a lot more but it did get a bit uncomfortable with minor pain when standing or walking too long. 4th month was when the pain and discomfort from activities were almost entirely gone. Now I‚Äôm at 5th and everything is pretty much back to normal though there‚Äôs still more swelling and definition that will settle down more over time. I have had sensation from my clitoris since day 1 tbh üòÖ. I had tried to touch myself here and there in the first two months to get used to the new part but couldn‚Äôt actually achieve an orgasm until 2 months mark. It all depends on your body and your will to learn and explore. Oh, and your mental and physical state as well. Hope this helps.

Than you so much I&#39;m on estrogen one mg three months now  when you did have the surgery did you have to use a catheter and for how long did it take to get it out. When you did take it out and start to pee did it hurt at first how does it feel when you were peeing on your own. Ty so much again for taking time out to answer I&#39;m very curious about this I&#39;m in Kansas so it&#39;s very scary here in ict wichita hometown. Trying to move to a lgbt friendly city when I do transition fully ty again.

Congrats on starting your HRT journey! I had my surgery back in mid-January. There was a catheter in for the first week and they removed it at my 1 week post op appointment. It did not hurt for me to pee at the beginning. The only thing was not knowing how to hold it in, I was often not able to make it to the toilet in time before some would drip out. Also because of the swelling, the stream was a bit messy. After a few months, all of this was resolved. I have better muscle control and the stream is no longer messy. I would definitely recommend getting surgery with a reputable surgeon closest to you. It is the single biggest/most important decision for SRS. Like dont settle for the convenience of distance or wait time. Always find the best surgeon!

Thank you! üòä It feels so euphoric the more I heal and start going back to normal daily life. I had my first orgasm at 2 months! All the usual stuff is going well. The whole process so far is relatively smooth except for a small granulation tissue at the bottom of my canal, which seems to be almost gone away after treatments.

Yes, so Avanessian‚Äôs office will work with your insurance to get pre authorization when it‚Äôs closer to your surgery date. I received a letter from my insurance explaining the approval about a week before my surgery. Also when you deal with Mt Sinai CTMS initially, they also verify your insurance to make sure it would be cover.

My clitoris is working well! The canal doesn‚Äôt have much feeling and pretty dull. I assume if something enters at the right angle to stimulate the prostate then maybe. I heard the same from my cis friend that it doesn‚Äôt really feel crazy amount in the canal for them. It‚Äôs mostly the clit!

Looking good! When was your surgical consult? Mine is scheduled with her in January, it&#39;s taking a year to get from initiating things with Mt Sinai to surgical consult... I hope surgery is soon after, things are moving slower than I hoped and I don&#39;t want to miss the whole summer healing.

My initial contact with Mt Sinai CTMS was last February, then consult in June and finally surgery in January. So about 11 months total. Are you local or out of state? I have heard that if you re out of state, it is a bit slower unfortunately since they prioritize locals first. Don‚Äôt quote me, I just vaguely remember this back when I was doing research. Hope this helps.

No, I&#39;m in state. Ugh my consult is so far away. I cried when I got called in April and was told I had to wait till January... I&#39;m glad yours went faster. You had like the exact timeline I was hoping for, a year earlier. I was hoping for a consult this summer/fall and surgery this upcoming winter.

Awe, I‚Äôm sorry. My guess would be her popularity is growing and it is starting to be a longer wait. But in any case, you will be in good hands so hang in there, take the time to get prepared for everything and it will be here before you know it! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

I‚Äôm not sure yet because only time will tell if I would be comfortable with my scars down the line. So far, even at this stage, I mostly don‚Äôt think about it too much even when I look at it. Plus if I get intimate with someone, they must know my surgery status in advance. üòÖ

Amazing. Can I just say that you pubic hair looks incredible? Not always something you see with SRS results and, imho, a very under-discussed feature of post-op life.

It was a hybrid PI and PPT. All Mt Sinai surgeons do this. And no, I didn‚Äôt have body sculpting üòÇ. It‚Äôs probably mainly the angle of the photos plus I‚Äôm on the skinny side so the HRT (E and progesterone) did the trick to distribute fat in the right area and perhaps it looks more obvious.
