I am just shy of 5 months post op SRS with the PPT method of Vaginoplasty.  I am generally extremely happy, particularly regarding function: peeing and sensation.  Swelling has mostly gone.
</p>
<p>
There are some things I don‚Äôt like though and am wondering about, and wondering whether a revision for cosmetic/comfort reasons makes sense.
</p>
<p>
First, it chafes when I walk or run unless I am wearing very full coverage underwear.  I have always preferred tanga, g-string, or Brazilian, but these are not an option with how much my vulva sticks out/hangs down.  Ironic that I was able to wear these things with a tuck but cannot now.
</p>
<p>
If I am looking critically, my labia Majora seem flabby and a bit loose, and they look ‚Äòscrotal‚Äô, which though not surprising, goes away if I tighten the skin a bit.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôd really like to feel comfy in my favourite panties but at the moment I cannot for physical and aesthetic reasons.
</p>
<p>
I have heard that some surgeons leave an excess of fat in the labia as this will settle out after a year, but I am thinking that it will leave the labia even flabbier.
</p>
<p>
Do any of you have knowledge or experience and can comment on the photos?

If you&#39;re in a position to be covered by insurance, please don&#39;t describe this as for aesthetic or cosmetic reasons. It may exclude any potential coverage by an insurer.
</p>
<p>
What you described:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
chafing
</li>
<li>
loose skin that interferes with wearing gender specific clothing
</li>
</ul>
<p>
... These aren&#39;t just aesthetic concerns; they are also functional and potentially dysphoria inducing. Whether or not you&#39;ve been seeing it that way or not.
</p>
<p>
Just mentioning this because there are still so many significant uphill battles in receiving inclusive, safe and universal gender affirming care and it may be of use to frame these as other than aesthetic (because they are!).

My surgeon offers revisions after 6 months. He likes to make sure all the dust has settled before cleaning up the aesthetics and tweaking anything someone asked for.
</p>
<p>
When I went in for my revision consult I brought up a similar worry of how my labia was still causing dysphoria when in a couple different positions (due to the same reason you brought up). I also had a bit that healed awkwardly due to dilation. Then I opened the floor to him on what he&#39;d like to do. He offered giving more of a hood (I was happy with what I had hood/clit wise but I figured why not) we discussed some other aesthetic choices until I was happy with the plan moving forward.
</p>
<p>
For the labia issue he got more fat from my stomach. They initially were puffed up dramatically (a little uncomfortably) so that as the fat migrated over time it&#39;d level out to what I wanted. After healing from the revision I&#39;m extactic with my decision to go back for it. This is your pussy and your life! It&#39;s absolutely worth it to make it into something you love touching, looking at, and using!!! üëèüëè

Totally valid to get revision for that.
</p>
<p>
I have mine for Sept 13th which will put me at almost 13months post.
</p>
<p>
Got a bunch of things that need addressed but I definitely need my majora tightened up. I was gifted a balloon animal and now that it&#39;s getting close to done being swollen it&#39;s evident that it&#39;s not gonna tighten up on its own. This will hopefully help with how numb it is.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s see, I need * depth revision * Granulation cauterization * scar tissue removed in my canal * a labiaplasty  * touch up with my clit (some fusion)  And  * majora tightening
</p>
<p>
Otherwise it went perfectly ü§£

Yeah I feel this is a really common concern people have. I would wait a few months, to the one year mark before going under for surgery again.

It&#39;s relevant for anyone else looking to go to them. A lot of people ask about sensation.

While you‚Äôre right, that information is secondary. OP is being vulnerable and sharing personal information and asking for help regarding a potential revision.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs self-serving and unempathetic to not offer any help or sympathy and just immediately ask for the surgeon‚Äôs name.

I‚Äôm not saying to ask about the surgeon is wrong, but I am saying to have some empathy when asking.
</p>
<p>
Gracelessly and tactlessly only asking ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs your surgeon?‚Äù when OP expresses dissatisfaction is heartless. At least try to offer sympathy or helpful advice/information
<em>
and then
</em>
ask.

In general, I don‚Äôt have a problem sharing my surgeon‚Äôs name and have done so on many different posts including with pix.  And I recommend them without hesitation.  But as this has nothing to do with the surgeon and is a very personal question, I don‚Äôt think it is appropriate to share that in this context.
