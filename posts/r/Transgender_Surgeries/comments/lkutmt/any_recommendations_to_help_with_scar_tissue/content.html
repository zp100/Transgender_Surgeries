I just recently had an abdominoplasty as well as ba.
</p>
<p>
For the abdominoplasty scar and any ba scar you may have I&#39;d recommend silicone tape. This is what I use

</p>
<p>
For your belly button I&#39;d recommend a scar gel cream. I use biocorneum scar gel

My surgeon has given me a special type of tape to put over the scars to help with reducing them, however I&#39;ve not seen much details regarding it. I&#39;ve also taken to using some bio oil on them as well. Just wondering if anybody else has any recommendations to reduce the noticeability of the scarring over time.  For the record, the abdominalplasty scar runs from sternum to groin, and then around the hips, just at the bikini line
</p>
<p>
Thank you in advance for any recommendations!

My BA surgeon told me she‚Äôs seen a lot of trachea shave patients with invisible scars. She asked them what they did to reduce the scarring and they said nothing. However, these patients were still having to shave their necks.
</p>
<p>
She suggested gently shaving the scars just enough to scrape at the top layer of tissue, then apply vitamin C oil after. I haven‚Äôt noticed much myself but people think my scars are tiny and barely noticeable at 5months post-op (I have to assume they‚Äôre comparing mine to others). I saw a TT scar the other day and it was angry.

I have no specific recommendations, but most pharmacies have scar reducing creams and tapes. It might be worth looking at some and checking for reviews online. Good luck. üôè

You can buy medical-grade silicon scar reduction products directly.  Here&#39;s an example:
<a href="https://oleeva.com/" rel="nofollow">https://oleeva.com/</a>
</p>
<p>
At least some of the stuff on Amazon seems like a &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; situation.

I worked at a plastic surgeons office. We sold this brand of silicon tape: Silikan Clear Gel Silicone Scar Tape-Invisible Medical Grade Silicon Skin Sheet Transparent Safe Scar Improvement Keloid Burn Breast Face Scar Recovery Protection-5 Foot Roll
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GHZCY1H/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_18Q3GQ6HX69F768J9DMW" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GHZCY1H/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_18Q3GQ6HX69F768J9DMW</a>
</p>
<p>
Most people came back for laser scar removal and that‚Äôs honestly the only thing that will make the scars go away. It works great for the breast scars. The tummy tuck ones are harder because most women get the little bumps on the ends of it where it‚Äôs raised. But use the tape and massage your scar to try to break up that tissue!

I use silicone gel like Kelo-Cote. I&#39;ve used it on both my abdominoplasty scars and my GRS scars. There is medical research supporting the use of these to reduce keloid formation and normalise colour. X

There an essential oil Helichrysum italicum that I have found works for scars. Search it and scars. It has many other varied benefits. It is pricey. Not sure if I can post which  distributor I obtain it from so DM me if you would like.

May I recommend Manuka Honey, please look it up, it‚Äôs available online.
</p>
<p>
I had a friend that had large second degree burns and he has almost no visible scarring.
</p>
<p>
Not easy to deal with, but if you‚Äôre serious, it works.
