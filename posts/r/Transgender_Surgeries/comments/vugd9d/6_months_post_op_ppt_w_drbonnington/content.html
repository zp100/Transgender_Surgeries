How is your swelling? How is dilating going? I&#39;m just about 6 months or so, PPT with Dr Wittenberg and Dr Bonnington (together).

They worked together for me as well, with dr. b as my main and w as the tool assistant. I cant say for sure where my swelling is at as ive never had a vulva before but it feels 90% down. Dilating is easy going enough, I can fit big orange (1.5&#34; diam) but honestly i prefer green #3, I can consistently get to dot 4ish. Also congrats on almost 6 months!

Thank you! Yeah, I can get to dot four too at this point. Lost a little depth from where it started, but I&#39;m not too broken up about it. I also have a little trouble getting the orange one in to that depth, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get there eventually. These days I&#39;m doing 10 minutes petite orange, 10 minutes blue, and 10 minutes orange.

<p>
I feel like I still have a lot of tenderness inside, and the entrance is kinda rigid sometimes, I think from swelling. Ibuprofen seems to help though.

Compared to 6weeks to 3 months 3  months to 6 is more subtle. Scars are fading, swelling slowly continues to go down and things settle into place. Most of my sensation on the labia minora is bas with a could of numb spots here and there. I do have a small hole where my minora connects to majora but its not a big enough deal for me to care and it will likely heal shut over time. Overall very happy, though recovery has been a challenge by virtue of being tired easily and so on, your normal surgery stuff. Sex is pretty cool, would recommend. I did finally manage a vaginal orgasm about 4.5 months in and that was a huge relief functionality wise. I have lost about a cm of depth over time but thats probably more due to swelling going down than anything else. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask, my posts are always ama&#39;s!

Also as a reminder if you are a patient/future patient of mozaic (Dr.Bonnington/Dr.Wittenberg) I do run a patient peer support discord, just pm me to request access, we have over 50 other patients and a ton of institutional knowledge if you need the help for the sometimes unique challenges our providers have.

The short answer &#34;Yeah I am doing okay&#34;.  The longer one... The primary reason I have not updated is because I fell into pretty severe post-op depression shortly after this post. Not because anything went wrong with my surgery or anything like that. The recovery has been pretty emotionally taxing and moving on from the highs of transition has made things pretty hard to deal with. Lots of weight gain, etc. So I have just been kinda avoiding it until I felt better about myself and I could make a post that wouldn&#39;t be needlessly negative because of my mental health being poor. I am only now kinda coming out of the shadow but I have a lot of work to do on myself and my self esteem.

As far as my vulva goes presently. She&#39;s fine. Aesthetically fantastic, I have lost a bit of depth over time, down to 2.5-3 dots from 4 and thats a bit of a bummer but thats more because I was too eager to decrease my dilation frequency than anything my surgeon did. I do still think outside the Aesthetic possibilities it opens up ppt is a bit overrated. Sex feels good though I do have to be mindful of how girthy my partners may be, thats also been a bummer but also not something unique to my surgeon at all. Trying to find a gyno where I live willing to work with Neo-vaginas has been frustratingly difficult and insurance providers are total scumbags but thats not any new info. Anyway id be happy to answer any other questions you might have.
