I had my initial penile inversion vaginoplasty SRS 16 ish months ago. Then an episiotomy and scar revision 4 months ago by a different surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just wondering if I can expect any long term improvements?
</p>
<p>
It still hurts to dilate with even the smallest dilator, I think it&#39;s mainly the skin not being very stretchy and it feels like I&#39;m pushing the skin inside even with lots of lubricant. Does this get better with more time or is what I have the final result ?
</p>
<p>
Can I expect to get any improvement in sensation after this long,  is there anything I can do to make it feel nicer ?
</p>
<p>
Willing to try anything at this point.

Ask your doctor for vaginal estrogen cream it helps with irritation and makes things more moist and elastic but speak with your provider first.

You will need your provider to prescribe it you Premarin is the RX but they have other generic options speak to your medical provider first so they can determine the amount you need and follow your medical providers instructions

Thanks again.  I don&#39;t have a medical provider any more as they have discharged me from their care (Welsh Gender Service). So I will have to source it online. X

Thank you. I have seen others mention this before and will look into it.
