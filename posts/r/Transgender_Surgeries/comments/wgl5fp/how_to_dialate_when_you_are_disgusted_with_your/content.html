Sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to be flippant. Let me unreddit a better answer for you. Unfortunately there&#39;s a lot of wiggle room in what they tell you. Keep that in mind.
</p>
<p>
Do you feel like everything is healed?
</p>
<p>
What type of vaginoplasty did you have.
</p>
<p>
Is there any point where you are feeling resistance other than from reaching depth?
</p>
<p>
Have you been able to reach the larger-sized dilators?
</p>

Yes I should have asked this from the get go. What your describing is a ring of scar tissue that commonly develops around the skin graft connections. That scar tissue doesn&#39;t have the elasticity it needs to accommodate ongoing dilation. Basically you force the dilator through and it causes tears in that scar tissue. It heals with --more scar tissue which makes in more restrictive.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure if you feel just inside your vulva opening you might be able to feel a thick ring of scar tissue that&#39;s developed. But then again, I&#39;m not a doctor, I&#39;m just another patient that&#39;s had, what sounds like, a similar issue. I&#39;m like the encyclopedia of shitty surgery complications.
</p>
<p>
The first attempt to fix it was by having my PT try to break it down using massage. That didn&#39;t work. It took a vulvectomy to surgically remove it.
</p>
<p>
Some of that story is here:

TMI, but after I had hemorrhoid surgery I now have that same ring of scar tissue, just in my anal canal instead of vaginal.

This would be good advice of the doctor wasnt a butcher. But rumer’s results do not give anatomical results. Therefore you might be giving advive which may hurt OP

I simply described my own experience in hopes they may find something relatable to their own circumstances. It&#39;s not professional medical advice. Even so,  feeling your own vulva is a fairly low risk activity unless your Edward Scissorhands.

Idk how we, as a community, can do better to spread the word that going with Rumer is a huge mistake. I honestly dont know how she is still allowed to perform this surgery because its horrific how many trans women she has disappointed. The majority of her results are messed up and her patient satisfaction rates are likely the lowest of any other surgeon that does GRS.
</p>
<p>
My heart feels so much for the trans women who have trusted her with something so important to them only to end up heart broken by the results.

Can you give me the names of them? So far, with Florida blue cross, she’s the only one Ive found who says she will accept it. I’m supposed to be scheduled with her in the fall. Thanks R

Hope that helps and that you can cancel your surgery with her. Please do. Please please it is not worth it to go with her, no matter how bad your dysphoria is

I have only used this for anal sex, but you may want to give poppers a try.  They relax the muscles down there quite a bit.

Last week was the four yr anniversary of Rumer and I getting into a heated verbal altercation in her exam room.
</p>
<p>
She’s a disgusting bitch.   I have similar problems.    Went to Dr. Ting to help make it better.  Still sucks knowing I’ve been Ruined by Rumer™️

I started reading your post and thought, hmmmm sounds a bit like me.... Then you said 2 years, seriously I&#39;m at 8 months and was hoping it would get better when I can stop doing dilation every day 🥺 if it&#39;s going to be every day for more than a year 😳 FFS
</p>
<p>
My biggest success so far has been making it not smell awfull without douching every day. (Balance active pH4 gel, I stick it in after dilation when it&#39;s gaping open.)
</p>
<p>
The only thing that sort of helps dilation is a lube shooter but even that hurts going in, scratches and pulls skin even though it&#39;s smooth. May be worth a try for you though? I have given up on it and just ram the thing in, hurts like hell but it&#39;s the quickest way when I just want it over with.
</p>
<p>
Can you enjoy any part of it ? Any part at all ? Please tell me you can 😢
</p>
<p>
Honestly wish I could be more positive but have a virtual hug from me instead x

If you can get a consult with a different Dr. please do so. A revision may be necessary. I had a slight extension of my perineum that interfered with PiV. I had a revision that fixed that issue. There may also be a possibility to address your other issues.

Hi. Sorry to hear about your issues. I was scheduling with Rumer since she’s the only one I’ve found who takes my Florida blue cross insurance. I wanted to ask why trans women don’t leave the dialator in all day, like some do with butt plugs.  Thanks R

Same way you do it when you aren&#39;t disgusted. You follow the instructions your surgeon gave you or you&#39;ll make a bad situation worse.
