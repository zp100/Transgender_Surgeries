My surgeon is telling me now that most trans women get 10-11cm of depth. Does this sound accurate? She’s telling me this because I only have 9cm of depth after she said she measured my depth at 14cm during surgery.
</p>
<p>
Would any of you be okay with 9cm of depth?
</p>
<p>
Someone please msg me if you want to chat about it.

I’d say 14cm is average what people get with penile inversion. Personally I’d be upset with 9cm and I’m sorry your surgeon isn’t taking some responsibility

It depends on your surgeon. Some are better than others, but 9cm is not good, and nor is 11cm.
</p>
<p>
Who is your surgeon?
</p>
<p>
If you’re losing depth, look in the wiki

I don’t know how to even log into a browser. I’ve only ever been on my phone and don’t know my information.
</p>
<p>
9cm is so far away from acceptable I don’t think there is anything that can be done. It’s fucked. I’m the 1% shit outcome for everything.

Bad surgeon probably.

<p>
This is the wiki entry for the first link, the other is far larger and doesn&#39;t fit. I&#39;d recommend you find out how to use a browser. You probably don&#39;t need to log in.

<em>
&#34;In the name of data compilation, I am very happy to report that I have gained approx 1.5-2&#34; of depth, overall. The 6-inch mark on my dilator now sits flush with my labia minora. This was achieved simply by putting extra pressure on the dilator, as advised on the previous thread and by my surgical nurse when consulted. I occasionaly use coconut oil as a lubricant, which has had the added effect of softening the skin around my pelvic floor considerably.&#34;

<em>
&#34;this matches my experiences: it is possible to gain or regain depth, contrary to what the surgeons proclaim... I see from the other posts you had surgery 4 month ago. I do not think such results are replicable much further than than 4 month mark (1.5 to 2&#34;) but 0.5 to 1&#34; might within 6 month to 1 year. I do not know if the effect can be cumulative... With Suporn, I gained about 1.5 inches in the first 2 months, to about 7.5 as measured with the L Due to serious disease, I could not dilate for a while at about 8 month post op. It was not SRS related but really bad and I didn&#39;t have my mind on that. It was about 2 month stop. Hard to remember, it&#39;s a bad experience I try to forget I lost about 1 inch, and have since regained / relost/ regained some of that. Currently, at least on the S, I&#39;m at 6.5, on the L I used to be at 6 but working up Then a few month ago I have lost the M dilator (yeah my bad, don&#39;t do drugs kids) making it tough to work with just S and L so I&#39;m back to 5.5 on the L while still at 6.5 on the S I will try to get soulsource or something with E3 oil to go back to at least 6.5 on L&#34;

It doesn’t really matter, nothing can be done. I have 9cm. I’m told that’s wonderful by the surgeon. Even changing the surgeons mind, what’s that do for me? I’m fucked. I’m horribly depressed. I’ve always hated my body, so it makes sense that my body would come through with horrible results for me.

I got 17 cm in surgery. As long as I can keep 15, I&#39;ll be happy. Keep in mind the average penis is about 13 cm.

The average penis stat is so stupid, if I end up with 13cm depth should I be happy with the fact that I can’t take 50% of dick (assuming median~average)?? I’d rather know the 90-95 percentile size.

I’m told to be happy with 9cm. I feel like I should end it all and stop the attempt at making things right. I’ll inevitably lose depth over the years as everyone does and I’ll be 8 then 7cm. My life is pointless. Paid a lot, lots of pain, then results that can’t even take a finger.

Nope. But it was better than the alternative. Which was a labiaplasty with no depth.

I believe the clinical term they used was, &#39;limited anatomy&#39;.

It&#39;s a surgical team, but women&#39;s health college Ontario. Tbf, they aren&#39;t wrong. Being on 250 mg of Spiro for nearly 6 years... Caused some shrinkage. Not that I wasn&#39;t already considered &#39;smaller&#39; before.

Please don&#39;t lose hope. With a bit of luck a different technique (peritoneal pull through, or colon) and a different surgeon could fix it in revision.

It’s hard to think about going through surgery and intense recovery again. It was a challenge to clear my life to be able to do this. I wonder if revisions are less intense recovery.

I can understand that, I&#39;d feel the same in your situation. FWIW I do believe they should be less intense, yes. I don&#39;t have any personal experience though.

I dilate 3 times a day. Each session is 15 min with the purple dilator, then 15 mins with the green dilator.

You should increase your dilation to 4 times a day.  I had to when I lost depth.

My PT has me backing off how much I’ve been doing. 30 mins three times a day. Surgeon says depth is lost and 9cm is great! Fml

10-12 cm (some stretching with the dilation). Guess it’s lower then my surgeon’s average, but average is literally average of lower and higher numbers.
</p>
<p>
I had some internal grumble for being below average and scared of losing any depth. At three months have not lost any, nor any issues with dilation, came to conclusion that I’m just upset over the fact it’s below average really.
</p>
<p>
On a positive side: I’ve survived 4.5 hour surgery with no major complications. Some penetrative sex experiments showed that sex can be good. By any measure -10 is better then +10.
</p>
<p>
Would I want 15cm? Yes, why not 🤷‍♀️. Am I upset for not having 15cm? No.

What penetrative sex am I going to have with 9cm though? I can’t even accommodate my middle finger. My middle finger is 10cm. I can’t accommodate a finger.

So, I discovered a few weeks after surgery that I&#39;m an inch deeper than I thought. A layer of my pelvic floor was too swollen to be pushed through the one day I had it pop deeper while dialating and discovered I was exactly as deep as she said I was during surgery. Not saying that&#39;s what&#39;s happening to you, but it certainly could be as 9cm is around where one of the pelvic floor layers is.
