It&#39;s a big step in your journey, it&#39;s good that you had fun. It&#39;s great that they did it under local, going under for such a simple procedure seems excessive.

that’s what i thought too! i’m glad they could do it this way cause idk if i would have decided it was worth the extra risks of general anesthesia, plus the risks of having to stay in the hospital longer when covid is still really bad here.

i kinda just assumed they’d say no to that, but thinking about it later i wonder if they would have done anything to stop me if i’d just bagged em up and walked out lol. after i took that pic i asked if i could touch them and they said yeah sure they’re yours. so...yeah...i did that lol.

one thing that surprised me was that they were softer than they seemed when they were still inside me. but otherwise they feel kinda like chicken gizzards. softer than that. but that’s the closest thing i could think of to compare them to.

That is interesting, maybe that extra skin and blood flow adds some Firmness.  How are you feeling so far? I checked out your pictures 🥰  You&#39;re gorgeous and goals 😊

thanks! the pain was better today than it was last night. it’s getting worse now though. and the swelling is getting worse. i’m afraid it’s gonna hurt a lot more tonight later and maybe for the next few days. which would match what some friends have told me to expect. so i’m not looking forward to that.

I&#39;ve heard similar things, that the first couple of days are the worst. But after a week or so things calm down.

Im really happy for you, and glad that everything went ok, just that i wasnt prepared to see the second pic. on the local anaesthesia, what happened once you got home? and what was the recovery process like?

i’m sorry! i probably should have given a little more warning about that in the title.
</p>
<p>
luckily i was still pretty numb down there for the two hour drive home. after that it slowly started to hurt more as the stuff they used for the surgery wore off. i’ve been alternately taking tylenol and ibuprofen and icing it. it hurts a lot but i’m still able to get up and move and eat and do things mostly normally. that may change soon though. a friend told me the first couple days are easier than the next. we’ll see i guess. i’ll probably be taking it easy at home for at least a week.

yes. general anesthesia is way more expensive and risky, and isn’t really necessary for this procedure. it really wasn’t bad at all! they were playing music and we were all chatting and laughing and having a good time. it was actually a lot of fun! lol

during the procedure i was totally comfortable and felt no pain at all. now it hurts quite a bit but so far it’s been manageable with tylenol and ibuprofen and ice.

How was the the pre procedure part? I’d do local but I’m afraid the anesthetic injections would be more than I want to deal with.!

i was kinda worried about that part too but it didn’t turn out to be nearly as bad as i was expecting! it was a little uncomfortable and hurt about like any other injection. really it wasn’t bad at all! definitely no reason to avoid doing the procedure this way!
</p>
<p>
and walking from the room where they did the injections to the operating room was really cool cause i got to feel a little preview of what it was gonna be like to walk without having balls lol. seriously though that was great, it was the first time i’ve ever walked without the balls hurting and feeling like they’re in the way and not supposed to be there. they felt like they were gone. just like it feels down there now!

yep! they gave me three big shots of some kind of local anesthetic down there plus a valium and a couple percs. so i was feeling real good, and felt no pain, but i was awake enough to walk in there, lay on the table, play with my phone and take selfies through the whole procedure, and walk back out to the car immediately after it was done. i thought it was a pretty cool way to do it!
