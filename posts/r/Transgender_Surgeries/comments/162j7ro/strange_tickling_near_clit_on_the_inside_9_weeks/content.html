Anyone had this? Feels almost like a hair when it brushes against things? Is this nerve ending regrowth do you think? Have follow up appointment with surgeon in a couple of weeks

Honestly it might just be an ingrown hair. I just got 5 ingrowns surgically removed and it&#39;s exactly as you described. Tickling sensation near the clit.
</p>
<p>
What happened was that the penile skin had hair and it was stitched to the foreskin. The stitch happened to be near where the hair is so it ended up growing from one region over to the foreskin region which is extremely sensitive.
</p>
<p>
Try spreading your legs out and pressing around with your fingernail to see if you can locate the source. You might be able to feel a slight bump and it should be painful and ticklish when you press it.

Yep, thats exactly how it feels. Found the spot. Can wiggle it with my finger and kinda feel it move.
</p>
<p>
Well this is annoying!
</p>
<p>
How was the removal? I&#39;m not sure my surgeon will do that. (uk nhs)

I went to a general surgeon for this, they basically just cut the whole portion out and stitch the surrounding area back together. It sucks but it&#39;s better than dealing with the itch...I lived 3 years like that.

Oh alternatively you can try to get it out yourself. Get a sterilized needle, sterilized tweezers. Do warm compresses and try to get it out.

You&#39;re having phantom pains. Very normal part of healing.
