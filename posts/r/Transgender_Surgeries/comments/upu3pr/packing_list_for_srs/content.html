Hey yall! I&#39;m going to be going under the knife with Dr. Avanessian in just under 3 weeks (
<em>
AHHHHHH!)
</em>
</p>
<p>
This is my first post for a planned digital diary of my Surgery Experience with SRS. I would use my main account, but seeing as I&#39;ll be posting the nitty-gritty of my recovery, including results, I&#39;d rather not have the +150 creepy followers I got from transtimelines be copping a pic at my new pussy.
</p>
<p>
My plan for this post is I already have a tentative list for what to bring to ensure I don&#39;t go insane with 3 days in the hospital and a month in a basement (don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s at my dad&#39;s house, the entire basement is very nicely renovated and cozy, but is pretty boring). My plan is to take the wisdom and experience of all the lovely people who can take the time to reply to collectively compile a list of must-bring essentials. I&#39;ll put my list at the bottom, and add to it as good suggestions come in! I&#39;ll also create a followup post after my surgery as I find items not necessary or absolutely essential. Luckily I&#39;m also moving of out my college apartment for summer/fall so I have a ton of stuff like a mini fridge and a TV that I can easily bring with me.

Hey! Just had surgery with her myself on the 25th of April. Good list, but a few things to note:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You‚Äôre going to be prescribed the Golytely, and it‚Äôs gonna SUCK. Drinking it will suck, not the resulting carnage lol.
</li>
<li>
you‚Äôre also gonna leave with 650 mg Tylenol, extra strength ibuprofen, and gabapentin. If your pain is low, you might try and stretch them. I miss the gabapentin already lol.
</li>
<li>
I just recently got bored, and I‚Äôm 2.5 weeks post op. I just haven‚Äôt had the brain power to commit to new things. YMMV!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I can‚Äôt stress this enough - you need to make sure you have someone with you 24/7. Sounds like you‚Äôve got a good set up though, so maybe you‚Äôve got that figured out. Getting out of bed is such a chore, and stairs are out of the question (aside from going down them once to your resting place)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, feel free to DM me if you have questions!

Thank you for the reply! I&#39;m reaaaaally not looking forward to the Golytely, but I guess I gotta do what I gotta do. As for having someone with me 24/7 my dad and his wife (conveniently an OR nurse) are trying to balance their time as much as possible, but I may need to get nurse to gap the time. Hopefully between a mini fridge, full entertainment system, and everything but the bathroom within reach, I&#39;ll make it to July without too much fuss :)

It definitely tasted like that at first, but it got more plastic / manufactured tasting as it kept going. Kept making me gag lol

When I had to use it for a colonoscopy I didn&#39;t really mind it either - other than having to drink so much so quickly.   The trick, for me at least, was to make sure that it was REALLY cold.
</p>
<p>
Just have to remind yourself that it is just a means to the end - it will be a somewhat miserable 24 +/- hours, but that is a relatively small blip in all of the other things we have to go through just to get to the point of surgery.
</p>
<p>
To the OP - You got this!  And you have the support of those who have gone before you, and those who are on the same path in their journeys.  üíúüíú

Imma shamelessly re-use a post of mine...
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<h1>
</h1>
<p>
‚Äã Let me copy below the shopping list notes that I assembled through doctor&#39;s instructions coupled with the experiences of myself and several others I know. Hope this helps!
</p>
<p>
My surgeon&#39;s instructions (with comments from me in parentheses)
</p>
<p>
2: Sodium phosphate enemas (I also took a bottle of Mag Citrate purgative.)
</p>
<p>
-: Chlorhexidine soap, or two individual sponges so scrub (4%)
</p>
<p>
-: Veet/nair to clear the area (Razors risk opening extra cuts in skin)
</p>
<p>
1: Bottle unscented alcohol-free soap (Baby dove.)
</p>
<p>
-: Thermometer to ensure you&#39;re not sick
</p>
<p>
15: disposable underpads (Hahahha no you need like 100. To catch ick under you.)
</p>
<p>
8: Small cotton towels (For ice packs, pat-drying, or underpad duty)
</p>
<p>
1: Case hyopallergenic baby wipes (Huggies one-hand wipes are least annoying)
</p>
<p>
60: Unscented maxi-pads (Get multiple kinds, to see what works for you)
</p>
<p>
1: Tube of silicone gel or vitamin E for scar reduction (Sil is far superior)
</p>
<p>
1: Measuring cup or spoon to mix saline (Graduated cylinder &lt;3 )
</p>
<p>
1: Portable makeup mirror for dilations
</p>
<p>
1: bottle of unscented dish soap to wash dilators
</p>
<p>
ALL THE LUBE. No, seriously. ALL. THE. LUBE. My surgeon said 10 tubes. Which would last most girls um, maybe a week. I bought three cases of individual ketchup packet size medical lubricant. Protip: Medical lubricant is cheaper than K-Y and other sexual health stuff. I suggest you buy about 3 liters worth of lube in total. Lube keeps. If you don&#39;t use it in the first three months, you&#39;ll definitely use it eventually.
</p>
<p>
Protip on saline: They may tell you to buy pre-packaged saline, or to mix your own by boiling salt water; saline for douching is a fairly common thing. Eff both of those options. Buy 4L jugs of distilled water and drop in 40mL of salt - preferably iodine-free - and that makes a jug of saline good for several days. Way way cheaper than medical saline, way way easier than boiling.
</p>
<p>
Freeze a ton of meals, buy a bunch of canned foods, healthy snacks, or get a case of MREs or something. Recovery will be your entire life at first, and your support system will also be busting their butt pretty hard.
</p>
<p>
If your surgeon doesn&#39;t supply the dilator set and a douche bottle, get those. (Soul-source for dilators.)
</p>
<p>
Clothing suggestions: Slippers, slip-on shoes, loose pajamas, sweat pants, skirts, nothing skin-tight and nothing with legs to pull on. Bring a laundry bag to bring home anything you wear to surgery / recovery.
</p>
<p>
Protip: Wraparound sarong skirts (not the bathing suit BS, legit sarongs) are super useful. Clothing you do not need to bend over for? Eff yes.
</p>
<p>
Other non-critical things to consider if you want:
</p>
<p>
Doughnut/U-shape pillow if you&#39;re far from the hospital
</p>
<p>
Small fan or heater to dry your nethers (Dry = better healing)
</p>
<p>
Conforming gel ice packs (Ice machine probably won&#39;t keep up.)
</p>
<p>
A breakfast-in-bed table.
</p>
<p>
50-ish sterile 4&#34;x4&#34; gauze (I pat-dried with sterile gauze the first month to reduce the risk of infection.)
</p>
<p>
Wedge pillows to sit up in bed
</p>
<p>
Mattress protector
</p>
<p>
Bendy straws (YES.)
</p>
<p>
Senokot stool softener (or senna tea. Lots of tea in general. FLUIDS GOOD.)
</p>
<p>
Shower head with a hose (GENTLE rinsing of the nethers.)
</p>
<p>
Thigh-high socks for warmth while bottomless
</p>
<p>
Silicone/plastic piercing retainers
</p>
<p>
Walker/cane/wheelchair, or just a lightweight portable chair for walks
</p>
<p>
Camera tripod if you want a series of pictures
</p>
