i had a similar issue where the incision was hanging around forever in certain spots. I was told the same thing it was due to an internal stitch and my body not liking it. basically the skin would turn to mush in a certain area and was a scab for like a month or two. the scab would be much larger/wider than the original incision. the depth of the affected area was shockingly deep. it went all the way down to the stitch.
</p>
<p>
but gosh 5 months out is a lot. min was resolved a little after month 3.

i’m freaking out now because this describes what i’m experiencing to a t. it’s been almost 2 months since my surgery and i have an area near my right ear where it’s like a  super mushy scab that’s much wider than the incision. it’s only 2-3 inches long the rest of the incision is more or less healed.

To clarify mine did eventually resolve but make sure to see your provider. In case you have an infection or something else wrong. I was told i had a reaction to the stitches and sometimes that happens.

Well the worst comes to worse you will not have a pretty scary. You can try and put  Neosporin on it and keeping it dry and clean. That means no headbands, no hair spray not hair products. Just let it heal up. And if it doesn’t heal up still then you can ask your surgeon to glue it together with surgical glue.  I have had over 30 plus surgery major and minor and a lot of head surgeries as well. And I have had scars healing like this a few times it’s really nothing to worry about. If it is infection then get antibiotics and then go from there.
