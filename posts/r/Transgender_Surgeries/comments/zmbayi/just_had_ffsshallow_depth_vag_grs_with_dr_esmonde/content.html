TLDR: Everything went great üëç KP insurance paid for it all.
</p>
<p>
I had FFS on Tuesday, GRS on Thursday of the same week. First set of surgeries were Hairline advancement,  midline face lift, brow line burring, and trach shave. It took 9hrs of surgery, felt like I had a quick nap.
</p>
<p>
Thursday I was rolled in from my room to the OR, and had a Shallow/Limited depth vaginoplasty. That took about 5hrs of surgery. I was in the hospital on bed rest for 2 days afterwards then stayed at a nearby hotel. I saw Dr. Esmonde in-person Every. Day. He is great üíú
</p>
<p>
This was a lot of body trauma for me, I&#39;m 52, and in decent health for a couch potato. I wouldn&#39;t have chosen to have both unless I had my gf by my side the whole time, incl in the hospital room. As well as the faster recovery this kind of vaginoplasty allows.
</p>
<p>
I have Kaiser Permanente Washington Core for insurance, and they paid for absolutely everything except the hotel fees when I was in the hospital. I have already reached my deductible this year. I don&#39;t usually go to bat for corporations,  but I will for this insurance. They have a transgender liasion that helps arrange everything and navigate the system. They paid travel fees and a per-diem for food when I wasn&#39;t in the hospital. I delayed my surgery for a year+ and had to change surgeons to use Kaiser, but it&#39;s been worth it. So, cheers for them. I had BCBS prior, and won&#39;t use them again.
</p>
<p>
I had appointments with Satterwhite in San Fran that I canceled bc he was out of KP network. It took well over a year to reschedule a consult and even more delays from covid before I could get to my date with Dr. Esmonde. All in all from insurance, therapy, covid etc Its taken me just shy of 3years. I am not disappointed üòå
</p>
<p>
Dr. Esmonde is a skilled surgeon, all around great guy, has a top-notch surgical team, and a caring staff that made my experience very very positive. Legacy Good Sam is a quality hospital, I had a private room, with a great team of nurses up on the 6th floor üòâ I acknowledge that I am receiving this quality care and positive experience from a position of significant privilege. YMMV.

I&#39;m not posting any pics just yet, in DM or here. My face is a week of bruised healing, and results dont look any different from the millions of others I&#39;ve seen. I&#39;ll do a before and after comparison when there&#39;s something worth comparing too, for sure. Sorry

I did. I&#39;m currently waiting for a surgery date. Likely Oct-Dec. I liked him. He was very courteous, reserved, completely unhurried. I actually wanted his opinions on which areas it might help work on to feminine my general facial structure and aesthetic (as opposed to knowing everything and exactly what I wanted) and it took a like bit to warm him up to giving suggestions. Which I think is a good tact to take generally; reserved and not aggressively leading the process. The clinic was going through a bunch of changes over the last year and unfortunately I think the disorganization meant that my ball got dropped and pushed me back a few months, but if that is accurate I didn&#39;t get the impression it was rank unprofessionalism or anything, just circumstantial.

I should be hearing from him around Oct-Dec to schedule a date for vaginoplasty next year and I‚Äôm going to call this week for a FFS consult. I also really liked him, he was polite and easy to talk to. He made time for me. How did your FFS consult with him go?

I had BCBS Fed Employees version. At the time it didn&#39;t cover but 80% of the cost, no travel coverage or hotel stay during recovery. It was bottom surgeries and meds only. My FFS and BA wasn&#39;t covered either as they were &#34;cosmetic&#34; They delayed my surgeries awaiting required letters from Doctors, therapists, and a psychiatrist. I don&#39;t know if everyone requires 3 letters, but it was another hoop to jump through.
</p>
<p>
Kaiser Washington Core covers everything, including travel, hotel, ffs, a variety of bottom surgical options, and has a trans-liasion team to walk you through the process. It was a snap.

Update: my face has almost fully healed. The scars are barely noticeable unless you&#39;re close up and looking. My scalp still itches and feeling across the top if my head is returning, maybe 60%now. Still totally numb in some small areas. I know it takes a while, but this has been the most irritating thing of the whole procedure. I wish I had gone with cheek implants, as the roundness I liked after surg was due to swelling. And It&#39;s a lot less noticeable now. My throat scar is almost completely gone, and I&#39;m very happy with the results of my ffs.
</p>
<p>
I have some small issues - cosmetic only - with my zerodepth cage, but I&#39;m due for a phase 2 in December. Should fix all the rest of my issues.

I&#39;m 38 and just starting, considering the Meltzer clinic. Would it be OK if you pm me how their face work looks? My dysphoria is extreme when it comes to my face so it&#39;s the first thing I need. üòî

Hello! I‚Äôm curious if you‚Äôd be willing to share photos of your ffs results? I‚Äôm having a consult with Dr. Esmonde tomorrow but they‚Äôve said they can‚Äôt show any previous results he‚Äôs had since leaving the Meltzer clinic, which is really unfortunate. I‚Äôve heard great things but there‚Äôs nothing to reference regarding his work.
</p>
<p>
Thanks üíú

I haven&#39;t shared ffs pics because my changes were very minor. Theres no good before and after pic to show the difference. And your needs/results will be different than mine. Things that pics cant show are scalp numbness, bumps where implanted hardware poke, and how the swelling has gone down. My scarring at my hairline has healed nicely, the scar under my chin is almost gone.
</p>
<p>
Dr Esmonde and his team are great, you&#39;d be in good hands.
