I had rhinoplasty and forehead contouring with him 3 years ago and I immensely regret it.
</p>
<p>
The forehead contouring barely made a visible difference and I have had persistent sinus issues since. The &#34;brow lift&#34; that was included somehow made my eyebrows set
<em>
lower
</em>
than they were before; I look constantly angry now. (Edit: I forgot to add that there was zero contouring done to the orbital rims.)
</p>
<p>
The rhinoplasty was the worst part. My nose is now not only lopsided, but it was raised up far too much and now my philtrum is overly long and my nose is set way too high on my face.
</p>
<p>
I am not only further from passing than I was before, I am deep in debt and will likely not be able to afford FFS again.
</p>
<p>
I am hideous and I feel completely hopeless.
</p>
<p>
His incompetence ruined my life, but I suppose you get what you pay for. He&#39;s one of the cheaper options for a reason.
</p>
<p>
Please approach him with extreme caution.

I’m so sorry this happened to you. Thank you for sharing and being honest though, these kinds of posts helped me decide not to book with him.

Yea I had a consultation with him but I didn’t agree with his overall approach, I also had concerns about his brow work since I’ve seen a few girls (including OP) end up having to get revisions to have them raised higher. I only have enough funds for one shot at this so needing a revision would be really bad for me.

Dear
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FFS_Throwaway123/">u/FFS_Throwaway123</a>
, after reading your comments, I regret that you feel as you do after your experience having surgery with me several years ago.
</p>
<p>
Those who know me know that I take absolute ownership of my work. Testimonials of this are found in the honest feedback from many, many FFS patients who have even video documented their journeys with us.
</p>
<p>
My policy is simple - every patient must be happy! Many hours of reviewing the objectives of surgery together with the patient, meticulous surgical work, and a close follow-up are the mainstay of the practice I built through the years. Any patient concerns we receive, my Team and I review immediately and treat with the utmost compassion and to the point. This hard work has been rewarded by my patients in their 5-star reviews on Google, Realself, and Facebook, as well as here, on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Please reach out to our office to discuss your options. We will be happy to work with you.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
Dr. Vartan Mardirossian

OP, I&#39;d like to ask: Have you approached Dr. Mardi&#39;s office? I know first hand they&#39;re one of the practices with the best QA and post op follow up protocols, as well as revisions policies and warranties.
</p>
<p>
What have they told you so far?

It&#39;s good to see both sides of the story. I thought Dr. M was very consistent with his results as I haven&#39;t seen any complaints. From your description it doesn&#39;t sound like your health is in any danger which is good news. I hope you&#39;ll be able to fix the cosmetic issues and the functional problems with your sinus. I had my FFS 8 months ago and Butcher Bart Van de Ven truly destroyed my face giving me long term functional problems and left screws to impinge on the roots of my teeth and more.

This. It&#39;s pure statistics and quality control theory.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not about IF it happens. It&#39;s about WHEN. Obviously the goal is to maintain satisfaction levels as high as possible (Say, out of every 500, only 2 or 3 unhappy. Realistically it would be like 1 out of every 90 or 100).
</p>
<p>
What matters when such situations come up is, how do we handle them as practices? What&#39;s the revisions policy like? Who will pay for what in such cases?
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it happens even to the best of us as Arlo mentioned. And sometimes, too early in the practice, with situations like defamation, lies, slandering and even fraud attempts (We&#39;ve had to deal with such situation a year ago).
</p>
<p>
But again, this is a two party thing (Client and provider), and communication is vital to reach a mutual solution.

Yes - Also, the metal plate that was put in can be felt through my skin over one side. It has a bit of a bump that protrudes.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also the side that has the constant sinus issues, so I suspect that it&#39;s related.

Sorry.  I have two screws above my eyes that I can feel and barely see.  I sorta learned to accept them as a part of me.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have the sinus issue, or any aesthetic problem with my forehead or nose.  I&#39;m really sorry that happened to you.  Have you looked into revisions?  Contacted his office?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going through something similar but from srs.  Where a good surgeon didn&#39;t produce the usual results.  It&#39;s why we always need to look at the body of work when choosing a surgeon.  It helps to know that none are perfect but some still remain better alternatives than others.

Yeah, it looks like a indentation above my eyebrow. And I tried before but they ignored my emails after awhile.
</p>
<p>
I held off on this post for a bit because I was trying to get a revision from them, but decided I&#39;d rather not put that trust in them again. I&#39;m looking into other surgeons in hopes of saving up for a revision.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really sorry to hear about your bad experience too... Stay strong.

I don&#39;t know what his skills were three years ago, but he is one of the best FFS surgeons now. There&#39;s a veritable army of Dr. M girls here who will attest. I&#39;m sorry this was your experience, but I would caution against blanket defamation.

<p>
And I&#39;d caution against blanket praise.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not the only person who&#39;s had a poor experience with him.
</p>
<p>
Why should I have to hide my horrible experience just because others have had a better one?
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m happy for them, but not every review has to be a good one. My life is significantly worse now and I&#39;d like people to consider other surgeons like I wish I had.

You should not have to your hide your experience -- please do share it. The title of your post, however, isn&#39;t suggesting others consider other surgeons, it&#39;s simply telling everyone not to go to Dr. M.

I agree I could&#39;ve worded the title better. I just feel very strongly about this and I want others to seriously consider other options if they can.

I really regret it and don&#39;t want anyone going through a similar situation.

How dare you. She has eveey right to share her story regardless of if hes a great surgeon now. 3 years aint that long ago. And if he wasn&#39;t skilled than he should have never operated on a patient till he was!

If anyone is looking for a reliable surgeon for FFS at a good price, check out Dr Cardenas at transop.com. I couldn&#39;t be any happier with my results!!

I&#39;m sorry to hear about your experience.
</p>
<p>
I recently went to Dr. Mardirossian for revision FFS and had a great experience.  Only time will tell if it heals well but so far no complaints. I don&#39;t know what happened in your case but sinus issues are a risk with any type 3 surgery.
