10 Weeks Post Op GCS (PI). Tina Rashid, Parkside, London. Prob my last pix until I get to the 6 month point.
</p>
<p>
Very happy with my new bits and very happy with my recovery.
</p>
<p>
Down in London in a hotel room at the moment ahead of my 10 week checkup tomorrow and hopefully final signoff(!).
</p>
<p>
My hotel room has pink &#39;porn star lighting&#39; lol so I could not resist a pic of ma bits with the flattering lighting.
</p>
<p>
I have recovered well to this point. After about week 6 I just dilated twice daily, and at week 7 I was able to go solo with the blue dilator which saves loads of time (and lube!). Takes me a couple mins to get to depth with blue solo.
</p>
<p>
From week 7, I was  back to work full time (was part time from week 3). Back hill walking, DIY and even cycling, basically able to do everything I did before at this point.
</p>
<p>
I did manage to chaife my labia while cycling (can see this on left inner lip in pix!)
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have a bath at home, and previously have never enjoyed baths. Basically three unwanted guests used to float on the surface and look bloody ugly!! With said unwanted guests now gone and I found that I quite like exploring ma new bits in the bath!
</p>
<p>
Few annoyances still, After dilation/douche I leak and am thus still having to use pads. This is totally unpredictable when you think it&#39;s done out comes some  more it&#39;s just water/lube but still annoying. Hopefully as the need to dilate reduces so does the dribbling.
</p>
<p>
Also not had the big O yet. Came very close a few weeks ago while employing a wand on my Mons Pubis which was fairly sensitive, but could not quite get there and made said Mons Pubis swell right up in the process! Whoops!
</p>
<p>
Since then, my Libido has dropped off a cliff. Hopefully it comes back, I switched to patches post-op and levels after 7.5 weeks only @ 380nmol/L they were around 600 pre op on tabs. Prob need to give it a bit longer than 7.5 weeks to get accurate levels. Hoping this explains why libido went off the cliff. T continues to drop. 0.8 via blockers, and 0.6 now the poison sacks are in the medical waste!
</p>
<p>
Still got a 1.5&#34; band of numbness right across towards top of labia. Inner lips also totally numb. This is just going to take time.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and my outer labia like to dance together when cycling, running etc, so I have some preventative cream (chub rub!) to make them glide against one another rather than chaife. Thus far my cycling has just been a couple miles each way to the pub, with hill walking 15KM with 700 odd metres of ascent I am building distance hill walking as I go.
</p>
<p>
Depth wise I have gotten 5 and 3/4 inches. I was able to regain the depth I lost in the few days immediately post surgery.
</p>
<p>
Oh and a recommendation for anyone else who is outdoorsy re outdoor peeing(!) The &#39;pStyle&#39; works for me better than the she-wee but it does need practice in the shower beforehand. Due to direction when I simply crouch 2 pee outdoors, I end up peeing into my own hiking boot!! Come winter I&#39;ll hopefully be back to ski touring and winter mountaineering, so this will save having to bare my arse to a cold easterly!

Looks great, though that last one has me concerned. You should probably talk to your doctor about that one.

Pretty sure it&#39;s not supposed to change to such a strange shade of purple like that...

Another Rashid patient, seconding all the praise! Her work is incredible and she’s so reassuring. I had my operation at around the same time and I’ve got very similar results! I would definitely suggest her to anyone in the UK
</p>
<p>
On top of that you’re clearly healing up really well, congrats :)

Hey do you mind to say how much it was private? I&#39;m looking at Dr Rashid as an Aussie who would need to go private too! Thanks :)

It cost me £15K, but the price has gone up I believe to £23K but you would need to check that.

I&#39;m still deciding... got a long way to go in terms of savings. I dont want to go to Thailand (I have a chronic illness and need English speaking healthcare workers) and might not get in with Hart.... but Tina has better results (imo)... lots to consider. If I had 100k Min Jun would be my choice 😅

Not sure it helps, but you can hire English speaking help in Thailand that have experience with the surgeons there.

They gave me purple and blue. You must have been rather larger than me pre-op!! Or maybe I got that the other way around there are two orange dilators in their range.
