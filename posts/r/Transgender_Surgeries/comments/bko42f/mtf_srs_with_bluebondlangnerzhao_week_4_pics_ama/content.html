There&#39;s not as much to say this week, so I&#39;m gonna switch to weekly summaries rather than daily journal entries. Daily pics are available for this week

Dilation is still a chore, but everything continues to heal. Swelling is improved but still present and causing the lop-sided appearance. My labia minora swelling is still pretty extreme. The white tissue (which is yellow for some reason in the pictures) is starting to turn fleshy, and there&#39;s no more raw, bleeding areas -- everything seems to be healing over.
</p>
<p>
About 3-4 weeks or so post op, I finally had the urge to test out the sensitivity of my new bits. There&#39;s a giant stitch right on top of my clitoris that makes things tricky, but I seem to have enough sensation to (carefully) get to orgasm already. I still don&#39;t have much sensation in my vagina, but that&#39;s probably a good thing at this point, since I can feel the stitches in there and sensation would just make dilation hell. That area should have sensation in the next few months if all goes well.
</p>
<p>
Lots of stitches have fallen out this week. That&#39;s nice, since a few of them are were getting annoying. There are still plenty left, though.
</p>
<p>
Energy levels are returning! I was able to bake (and eat!) a cake this week, and I&#39;m starting to do more household chores and stuff. I&#39;m not back to work yet, I might give that another month. We&#39;ll see.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s about all that&#39;s worth saying this week, but as always, feel free to ask any questions!

Thanks for posting. These photo&#39;s are great, but I think it would be helpful if you posted a photo standing so people could see what it looks look like in a more normal position.

Sure! I can do that for the next batch. The swelling is much more noticeable with my legs closed, so it&#39;d be good to catch what that looks like.

Looks like the swelling has gone down a lot. It&#39;s looking really good!
