Looks like the Suporn Clinic will start booking more people for the January-March 2021 time frame.  It&#39;s more costly (in time and money) than normal as you will need to stay a minimum of 42 days in Thailand, including 14 days of quarantine ahead of your surgery, but it may still be good news for many.  The 50,000 THB needed to cover 14 days of quarantine alone come out to an extra USD$1,663.45 (plus cost of food and other expenses) you&#39;d need to budget for as of today&#39;s exchange rates.
</p>
<p>
Looks like you will have to be a resident of a &#34;Green Zone&#34; country as per this list:
<a href="https://healthserv.net/en3776">https://healthserv.net/en3776
</a>
.  It may be relevant to many people on this sub to note that the United States and United Kingdom are not on this list (albeit for good reason), while Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, etc., etc. are.
</p>
<p>
Apparently you can only book with Dr. Suporn or Dr. Bank currently -- no word on Dr. Prae (P.S. Has anyone on this sub had surgery with her yet?).

Dear Clients,
</p>
<p>
We are delighted to announce that we will be accepting bookings starting from January 2021. Since November, we have undertaken a limited number of operations following the new and tighten controls both from the Thai government and from our partnered hospital. And now, we are more than ready to welcome all interested patients.

<p>
If you already have an operation reserved or provisionally reserved AND are resided in the ‘Green Zone’ countries, you have a priority in scheduling your operation with us. Please feel free to contact us to schedule your appointment at your convenience.
</p>
<p>
Before making an appointment, we would like to inform you of a few important requirements that you must comply. We ask that you please ensure you understand them thoroughly:
</p>

This also includes 3 Covid-19 tests. The cost of quarantine must be paid-in full and directly to SCH prior to your arrival. Guests are welcome, however, you are unable to share a room whilst in quarantine. You must book additional rooms if you are coming with family members or friends.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>

</strong>
- These include 14 full days self-quarantine at SCH and another 28 days or more for operation and recovery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
Schedule operation between January - March 2021
</strong>
- For the first phase of our reopening, we will accept bookings from January - March 2021. You can schedule operations with either Dr. Suporn or Dr. Bank. We will publish the calendar with available dates on our website before end the of 2020.

</a>
The types of permitted person in your COE application would be ‘Foreigners with Medical Appointment’. Please note that you may need up to 30 days to prepare and process these documents before actual traveling. Should you decide to come, please plan your preparation and processing time accordingly.

</li>
<li>
<p>

</a>
. We will provide you with more information on the process and documents required to obtain COE. For those who are not ready to proceed at the moment, we will keep you posted on our update and are looking forward to welcoming you soon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Cosmetic Improvement
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately we are not yet able to accept booking for cosmetic improvement (CI) because the stringent safety regulations do not allow us to perform any surgery in the Clinic itself. However, as previously notified, we have extended your warranty to compensate for the time we have been closed. We anticipate that we may be able to resume in the second half of 2021.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
STAY SAFE
</strong>

Originally yeah
<a href="https://archive.vn/6Gjbc" rel="nofollow">he was supposed to retire at the end of 2019
</a>
(see end of archived page), but
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/b87wu3/updates_on_suporns_website/" rel="nofollow">he decided to stay on a little bit longer through the end of 2020
</a>
to support the new surgeons, Dr. Bank and Dr. Prae.  It seems because of COVID-19 he&#39;s going prolong his retirement even longer?
