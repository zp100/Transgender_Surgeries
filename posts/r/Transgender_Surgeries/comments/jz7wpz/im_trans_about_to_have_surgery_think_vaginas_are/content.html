I&#39;m not huge on the aesthetics either, but the functionality is nice, as well as the fit for clothing.  A lot of cis women don&#39;t really think their genitals are super-attractive either.

True.  I was close friends with a CIS lesbian and she thought vaginas were ugly.

Why does this seem to be the small opinion I never hear? I never was crazy about em and I would also hear comics and my friends describing the most vulgar ways to enjoy it. Always thought something was wrong with me cause I wasn‚Äôt interested in hours of ‚Äúdowntown ‚Äú

Generally I would way that cis women think vaginas look weird. This is true of my wife and seems to be the opinion within her social circle, for what it&#39;s worth.

I&#39;ll have to disagree.  I am pansexual, though.  I tend to think genitals in general look appealing.  Even non-human genitals, to some degree.
</p>
<p>
As far as vulvas go, I think the vast majority look attractive.  Big labia, small labia, exposed clit or not.  And for those wondering, yeah, what you&#39;re looking at externally is the vulva and/or clitoral hood/glans.  Not the vagina.

It‚Äôs a big surgery and a big step. Just be sure you want a vaginoplasty over what you currently have. It‚Äôs also OK to be non-op.
</p>
<p>
You asked why you would want one, but you should only get it done if you REALLY hate what you have and REALLY want vaginoplasty. There is no
<em>
requirement
</em>
for surgery of any kind.

There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s called &#34;bumping uglies&#34; and it ain&#39;t cause you&#39;re flying space fighters cobbled together from parts of different ships.

That&#39;s not an abnormal thing for straight women to think. Don&#39;t worry too much about it.

If you want it, you&#39;ll get very used to yours very quickly. It just becomes another part of you.

if you ask &#34;why would i want that between my legs?&#34; and you don&#39;t feel dysphoria about what you have, then maybe you shouldn&#39;t get one. it&#39;s not a requirement to be a woman because any gender can have one. and what genitals are really cute? lol

There‚Äôs an olde expression where I come from - ‚ÄòIf in doubt, do nowt!‚Äô (Which translated from Yorkshire means ‚ÄòIf in doubt, then maybe best to do nothing‚Äô - at least for the time being until you‚Äôve perhaps been able to talk more with others and gather more perspectives. As has already been said, there‚Äôs no absolute requirement to have SRS and certainly not if you feel under pressure because it‚Äôs somehow expected. Personally, I‚Äôve always been rather indifferent to the aesthetic of genitals of any type and it‚Äôs more of a function-over-form thing for me and a necessary sense of completenessüòä

I kinda feel the same, I find them ugly, I just want a downstairs that passes, that&#39;s the extent to which I care about aesthetics. I just want to get rid of the dysphoria, to, for lack of a better way of phrasing it feel for myself that I&#39;m a real woman, and get rid of that thing that stares back at me. Also it helps in straight relationships to have things configured a little differently, or at least i&#39;d think so.

You need to talk to a therapist first if your not sure. Do not go into your surgery with this type of attitude. If you think vagina&#39;s are ugly, you will not be happy with your vagina. Take your time to think this out thoroughly. Good luck in what ever you decide.

I&#39;m totally with you, sister. Vaginas, yuck. And on top of that they&#39;re high maintenance.
</p>
<p>
All the same, I am a woman, and I really don&#39;t want a penis and scrotum. And like the others have said, your clothes will fit so much better. I also think psychologically it&#39;s just very affirming. And who knows, I might get an opportunity to share it with someone someday.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also heard a lot of girls say that they didn&#39;t realize how much it would change how they felt about themselves.

Have you considered nullification surgery?  No vulva created, but penis and testes are removed.

Concentrate on the functionality aspect for sure, its fun as hell! Surgery did wonders for my bathroom and clothing dysphoria, no regrets! Im just one of those weird people who also likes how vaginas look (dicks however are gross)

I did actually consider that, but (1) I might want the functionality of the vulva/vagina, and (2) I just think it would look really weird.  I mean, you end up with what, a urethral opening, and that&#39;s it?  If nothing else, I&#39;d stand out in less-clothed situations, which is not what I&#39;m going for.

I don&#39;t have a solution, but I find this topic personally fascinating. As an engineer, I have wondered, &#34;why standardize around a vagina or a penis?&#34; If a person wants to have surgery for body modification, why not invent something new or more personalized?
</p>
<p>
That said I haven&#39;t come up with genital alternatives, it&#39;s just something I have pondered lightly since researching transition.
</p>
<p>
One thing I have thought of is keeping my penis, but adding a vagina. This is a less popular, but possible surgery... I forget what it&#39;s called offhand. There are lists out there of many surgery options, but the only one I know of that &#34;adds functionality&#34; is this one.
</p>
<p>
I am also curious to explore keeping my testicles, but permanently tucking them internally. I posted about this a while back and no one seemed to think it was a good idea. :/

they used to do the internal testes thing apparently. sometimes you can find older transsexuals who had it done. I&#39;ve seen at least one online (she acted like it gave her magic powers or something though it was strange lmao)
</p>
<p>
I feel like I&#39;ve heard people say they could become cancerous? I know undescended testicles can be dangerous
</p>
<p>
I personally am getting a cloaca so everything comes in and out of a single hole. it seems very efficient to me. ü§£

Haha, I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re being serious or not, but I appreciate the creativity! I hear a lot about cancer anecdotally, but have seen no evidence scientifically. There are people who tuck for decades without issue, so I am skeptical about inherent danger.

I was joking about the cloaca thing but I promise it wasn&#39;t like making fun of non-standard SRS, I just thought your idea was really interesting and I&#39;m also kind of nasty.
</p>
<p>
I think the cancer thing is like... people say &#34;smoking causes cancer&#34; but I just ran a calculator and said I was 50 years old and had smoked 15 cigarettes a day since I was 18 and it told me my risk of lung cancer in the next 6 years was 0.6%
</p>
<p>
so I think the undescended testicles thing is probably similar? it&#39;s all about risks/benefits
</p>
<p>
out of curiosity can I ask why you&#39;re interested in keeping them? is it just for sentimental value (totally valid)?
</p>
<p>
I would think that having them tucked permanently that they would basically shut down and not really provide any sort of medical/hormonal benefit (idk that for sure of course but I know tucking can actually be used as a birth control method because the testicles have to be outside the body to be at the proper temperature to function correctly(

I have researched hormone production and sperm production with long term tucking.  From what I have found, tucking does not reduce testosterone production and does not necessarily reduce sperm production (ie is not a valid form of birth control); however, this may vary between individuals.  Similarly estradiol does not guarantee birth control... though after 3 months of high estradiol medication, my sperm FINALLY disappeared or at least became immobile.  I have literally been monitoring and documenting under microscope since I began treatment.  I still find some sperm but they appear dead and there are very few. (all it takes to monitor sperm is a 400x microscope btw - about $100 for a decent one)
</p>
<p>
The reason I am interested in keeping them is because I want
<em>
some
</em>
testosterone production. Gonads, male or female, produce natural sex hormones, and regardless of gender, humans &#34;function better&#34; (ie are designed for), on
<em>
some
</em>
level of both testosterone and estrogen.  I also don&#39;t really have gender dysphoria in the typical sense - I have a dysphoria about having a body in general, but feel nothing in particular about my body.  For example I am not bothered by growing breasts and having a penis, or having no breasts and a vagina, etc.
</p>
<p>
I cut off my pinky finger with a table saw a few years back and don&#39;t have particular feelings about that either. I am more disturbed by my lack of feelings about my body than anything about my body in particular.
</p>
<p>
My identity is just sort of decoupled from my body and always has been.  It&#39;s more like I&#39;m driving a leased car or something.  I can finally confirm that estrogen has been helping a little bit with depersonalization, in that it gets a little worse when my e is lower; but it does not fix the problem by a long shot.

Wow, thank you for such a fascinating and informative response! That&#39;s really interesting what you said about tucking and E, I didn&#39;t know any of that.
</p>
<p>
it is so interesting how different bodies can be, my orgasms personally went completely dry after like 3 or 4 weeks on a relatively low E dose.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s really cool that internalizing the testes doesn&#39;t actually shut them off, I really hope you can find a doctor who will help you with that if it&#39;s the route you decide to go! I wonder if you could (or already have) find historical information about how they used to do that as part of SRS?
</p>
<p>
also totally feel you on all the depersonalization stuff. I am pretty lucky that just switching my hormones pretty much fixed it for me (there was a little bit more to it but yeah)

I am going to give things more time before pulling the trigger on any surgery options, but I find testicles annoying physically speaking.  It&#39;s a big bonus that HRT shrinks testicles because they were too big I think.  The older I got, the bigger they got it seems like.  It was starting to get uncomfortable for me and I had to rearrange often.
</p>
<p>
Amazing, you went dry that fast!  I am going on 4 months and still have volume.  I even still have some sperm, but very few and no motility.  I actually just posted in
<a href="/r/transtimelines" rel="nofollow">/r/transtimelines</a>
.  Hopefully I don&#39;t get downvoted too much. :P
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad HRT was a depersonalization solution for you... I wish I could identify exactly where it stems for me, but when I really thought about it, I realized I&#39;ve felt this way since I was very young.  It just became worse when I began to look &#34;very male&#34;.  I was starting to look like I belonged on a magazine cover - good muscle bulk/tone, etc. and I realized I hated it.  I also don&#39;t like hyper feminine appearance though.

when i grew up, the &#34;adult&#34; magazines showed breasts and pubic hair.  you&#39;d never actually get much look to know what a vagina even looked like.
</p>
<p>
i guess there&#39;s a reason for that :)
</p>
<p>
i&#39;m interested in SRS, and want something functional.  but as long as it works, i&#39;m not at all picky about how exactly it looks.  i&#39;ll never do porn, i have no reason to take pictures, so as long as its healthy and works, does it matter what it looks like?
</p>
<p>
i can tuck and wear w/e i want, but it&#39;ll be more comfortable once something is gone... that&#39;s important to me... all that matters really....

This is basically me.  I&#39;m going to a super-experienced, highly regarded surgeon.  I&#39;m pretty damn sure she can put together a good-looking vulva from what I&#39;ve got.  I didn&#39;t ask a single question about that end of things at my consult.  I was with my ex (cis woman) for 22 years, and Really enjoyed giving her oral sex, but my eyes would always be closed, I couldn&#39;t really tell you the first thing about differentiating features of her genitals.

Talk to your therapist about these things.  It&#39;s important to go into surgery in top physical and mental health.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s pretty normal to search for reasons not to have major surgery, it&#39;s your brain trying to avoid something risky or difficult.
