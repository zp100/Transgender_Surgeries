$18,000 USD for colon technique.  Other techniques I believe are about half that cost.  The medical care was better than what I am used to in California.

That&#39;s great.  It&#39;s a good idea to start planning and researching now, because I personally could only research about 30 minutes a day before getting overwhelmed with information and emotions.    Plus I must have emailed PAI about 100 times with questions back and forth.  11 months will fly by way faster than you expect.

Hi sorry, I know you posted this a while back.. just wanted ask is the $18,000 for the surgery only or the cost of everything including hospital stay, accommodation etc?

Thank you!  My understanding is Theerapong is a great choice.  He was my second choice.  I would rate my sensation as very good.

Thank you!  I&#39;m pretty sure they are well over-exaggerated.  I never hear of anyone actually having issues who have had colon technique.  In my research I only came across these myths from people who went with different techniques.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand:  How many times do we hear of someone needing secondary sigmoid colon because of complications with their original PI technique?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not saying sigmoid colon is better.  In fact, I think for most people PI or similar is likely the best choice for them.  But unlike colon technique, you do hear about PI technique occasionally needing secondary sigmoid colon to correct problems with PI.

Because with PI there is an option for revision with colon or ppt but if you go with colon the first time you don&#39;t really have an option for revision if something goes wrong, as you said everyone is different and there is no specific technique that is a golden standard for everyone

Great point.  And that is something very important to pause and consider before choosing colon.

It&#39;s completely fine.  I had some diarrhea in the hospital and some gas, but it resolved on its own within a couple of days.  I was on soft foods for maybe a week and a half?  Then I could (and do) eat everything I ate before surgery.  I think there&#39;s a lot of scary or unpleasant rumors about colon technique that just aren&#39;t true.

Yeah, I was happy for that.  I had
<em>
some
</em>
sensation within a week which was a good sign.  Then most of the rest of it returned over the past few weeks.  I still have a couple of numb spots in my crotch area which im hoping return to sensitivity, but they arent apart of my vulva.  I also have to be gentle for a couple more months, so the anatomy can become strong.  I assume pleasure will be even better once that occurs.

The paperwork wasn&#39;t complicated.  I did a lot of emails back and forth when I was asking questions and sending info back and forth.  Picking a surgeon was a lot of effort, but it was worth the effort.

Sorry I know Iâ€™m late to the replyâ€™s but it looks amazing is there any benefits to using the colon technique over others? If I donâ€™t get the waitlist for bank next time around im likely going to go with sutin. Is colon the best?
</p>
<p>
Also how long is the waitlist?

Hello, I am also considering having the sigmoid colon technique and especially going with Dr. Sutin for my SRS, from what I have researched the sigmoid colon technique has the following advantages: good depth (of at least 6.5 inches), vaginal lubrication (It can be a lot or very little, that depends on the person and it should be clarified that it will not increase with arousal), vaginal elasticity (more than you would have with the Non PI technique, PI with scrotal graft and PPT), more tissue for the creation of the vulva (all the skin of the penis and foreskin if available for the creation of labia minora and clitorial hood) and less need for vaginal dilation
</p>
<p>
Regarding waiting times, it would be best to contact the PAI clinic to find out.

Oh wow thank you so much yeah Iâ€™m just really unsure because I havenâ€™t really researched much about the colon method and was completely set on dr bank.
</p>
<p>
I heard that for some people it can smell quite bad due to it being the colon?
</p>
<p>
What does it mean the wetness doesnâ€™t change at all from arousal does that mean that Iâ€™ll be wet like all the time even when I donâ€™t want to be?
</p>
<p>
Also Asthetics mean a ton to me and this girl by the looks got extremely lucky Iâ€™ve looked through the photos and quite a few arenâ€™t perfect though I know itâ€™s impossible for all to be perfect. Do you know if they offer revisions at all?
</p>
<p>
Sorry for all the questions

The smell is a myth, since they make a very rigorous and sophisticated preparation with the tissue of the colon before grafting it to the vaginal cavity, with that they make sure that it is 100% clean and so that the tissue can adapt to its new function, maybe during recovery there is a smell but after healing there is no more, the aesthetics of the vulva has a lot to do with the available skin (size of the penis and if you have circumcision or not), with respect to vaginal lubrication, that will vary, it can be a lot or very little (that depends more than anything on your body), the lubrication will be constant and you may need to use a panty liners (which is normal and common with cis women) and regarding revision surgeries, you can choose to further define the labia minora or the clitoral hood (even both), increase or reduce the size of the labia minora or majora, creating the anterior or posterior commissure, creating or further defining the frenulum of the clitoris, but that is something you can only decide after recovery (between 6 months and a year)

Amazing amazing thank you so so much for all this information I really appreciate it I wasnâ€™t really sure about the colon as hadnâ€™t really researched it but am looking more and more into sutin.
</p>
<p>
I am wondering however if it turns out not to be symmetrical can that be fixed through revision ?

I too was unsure about the sigmoid colon technique, but the more research I did the more confident and attracted to this technique, Dr. Sutin and PAI are great for the sigmoid colon technique, they have special equipment for the colon part.
</p>
<p>
And asymmetry is something natural that exists in biological vulvas, it&#39;s not like porn has taught you, vulvas are very diverse and one is not going to look like another, but if you want to have a little more symmetry in case it did not turn out as you expected, there is the option to increase or cut the other labia.

Yeah I know they arenâ€™t generally even but I guess since Iâ€™m having it for the rest of my life Iâ€™d want it as even as possible and would pay whatever it takes to look and function perfectly.
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much Iâ€™m definitely considering sutin now!
