<p>
I had my SRS with Dr. Bank 1 month ago.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
I arrived 3 days before surgery. Flight was really long and I was really tired when arrived. Also time zones is no joke for me.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
The next day I passed several examinations and blood tests at the hospital and short appointment with psychiatrist (her English accent was really excellent). I had short appointments with Dr. Bank and Anesthesiologist (she in nice). Dr. Bank briefly showed me the presentation of some results and overall information of the Dr. Suporn method. Consultation was a bit short.
</p>
<p>
The next day I was admitted to the hospital. The hospital looks really nice. Everyone is wearing face masks and use hand sanitizer here.  Unfortunately, you can&#39;t walk there post op anyway as you have to stay in bed all the time (5 days). In the evening nurse did enema for me (7 times) untill it was really clean.
</p>
<p>
The next day was the surgery day. I had spinal block anaesthesia (you can have general anaesthesia also but anaesthesiologist really recommended me spinal block during the consultation). I do not remember much during this day. I did not have any pain and woke up easily after surgery. Spinal block is indeed a good thing.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Next five days I stayed in bed. They have TV and Netflix there (but you need to select English language in Settings manually or you see it in Thai only). The staff bring you menu for food and you should choose what is allowed for next day (always only two options). As for me - food was tasteless and awful. I think it should be like this because limitations after surgery (no fiber). It was ok overall. Doctor and nurses visited me for daily check ups.
</p>
<p>
On the last day was catether removal. For me it did not work (apparently due to swelling) and they put it back for 7 days. It was really uncomfortable and painful especially when you need to dilate or move.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bank removed packing (bloody) and showed  how to do static dilation before leaving hospital.
</p>
<p>
Overall surgery makes me really sleepy and tired. I almost could not walk (even inside hotel room) and now one month post op could barely walk 300-500m / daily.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Static and dynamic dilation
</p>
<p>
I did static for 2 weeks and then move to dynamic (with rotation and 3x/day). Clinic has own mini bus and drive to the Supornclinic on Monday and Thursday for consultation appointments with Dr. Bank.
</p>
<p>
My Aesthetics results are nice even now with swelling but dilation is pure hell for me.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
It became especially more difficult after I arrived home. Maybe I am doing something wrong or just stressed more when I am not anymore in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
Depth is around ~6&#39; (not sure how to measure properly).
</p>
<p>
I was under impression that my strength was really low and other patients were more active during my stay at the hotel.
</p>
<p>
Recovery is extremely difficult for me. Maybe it&#39;s just me.
</p>
<p>
I had FFS before (full) and it was much easier as you can walk right after it and be active.
</p>
<p>

Update: added dilation photo

<p>
everyone is different. i was walking 1-2 miles (2-3 km) per day once i was out of the hospital. it&#39;s honestly just luck, i guess, because i don&#39;t normally heal all that well.

<p>
this was like one of the worst parts for me. i hate enemas, and this really sucked.
</p>
<p>
as for the rest, including dilation, i&#39;ll just say it gets better. i&#39;m 14 months post op and life is great.
</p>
<p>
you got this!

Yes, I noticed the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Many girls there could walk freely and sit for long time.
</p>
<p>
So, indeed probably just me.
</p>
<p>
As for dilation did it also became more difficult for you since 1st month or later?

Looks great! Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
If you are up for sharing, I am curious, how many times did you apply to the Suporn lottery before receiving a surgery date. I have tried three times with no luck and am just trying to get an idea of how long it has taken for others. Thanks much.

Hello, I have a few questions. After the operation, what did you have against the pain? Medicines, an infusion?
</p>
<p>
And for the food, is it only Thai or were these meals also European, American,...?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m barely 20 years old, and I really want to know everything before deciding to go to the other side of the worldüôà

Hi, they give you injection agains pain right after surgery in hospital + pills. When staying in hotel Dr. Bank gave me tramadol, paracetamol with codeine (15mg) and regular paracetamol. You can take it symptomatically when you have pain.  In hospital they brought me a menu with &#34;Western&#34; food choise only (typically 2 meals and you need to select one). In hotel for breakfast it&#39;s self serving (you choose what you like - Western or Thai. Also you can order food directly from any restaurants close by using Grab app (it&#39;s super cheap)

Oh ok, thank you very much. I don&#39;t know yet which surgeons I would choose but I prefer to take all the information to know.
</p>
<p>
However, I have great difficulty swallowing the pills, so I don&#39;t know if they have soluble medication.
