I&#39;ve said before and I&#39;ll say again, the WIKI on this sub that
<a href="/u/HiddenStill">u/HiddenStill
</a>
and her team maintain is amazing. I&#39;d be lost without it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve read every post for Dr. Banks (incredible results and reputation!) and many posts for other surgeons in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
For the other surgeons (I don&#39;t want to name names here, but DM me if you want to know), some had many positive posts but also had some really awful ones describing major complications after returning to their home country such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
fistula
</li>
<li>
failed skin graft
</li>
<li>
nerve damage affecting non-genital areas like feet
</li>
<li>
permanent numbness on parts of vulva
</li>
<li>
severe granulation not responding to silver nitrate, requiring surgical removal
</li>
<li>
urethra placed inside vagina (discovered during gyno exam in home country)
</li>
<li>
hair inside vagina
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In some (not all) of these cases I read about the local doctors in the patient&#39;s home country were not able to help due to lack of experience, and the surgeon would not respond when the patient asked to schedule a revision to fix the problems or refuse for unstated reasons.
</p>
<p>
The notion of having SRS surgery in Thailand, having major complications when I get to my home country, not being able to get help locally, and my Thailand surgeon ghosting me is absolutely terrifying. To be clear, other than this issue, I really like what I see with Thai surgeons. And based on the research I&#39;ve done, I don&#39;t want to have SRS with a surgeon in my home country so it&#39;s a dilemma.
</p>
<p>
The ray of hope for me in all of this is Dr. Banks. In all of the posts on the WIKI for him, I didn&#39;t read any reports of complications anywhere near the level of the ones mentioned above. Nothing beyond difficulty dilating and minor granulation, etc. And no reports of him refusing to do revisions.
</p>
<p>
My questions are, if you&#39;ve had SRS with Dr. Banks have you had any major complications or heard of anyone with major complications? Have you heard of Dr. Banks every refusing to do revision or otherwise fix problems?
</p>
<p>
I realize that major complications can occur with any surgeon, and probably will occur eventually. My goal in making this post is just to gather more data points and gauge the risk accordingly.
</p>
<p>
I also realize that Dr. Banks&#39;s price includes a free revision so I&#39;d think it would be bizarre for him to refuse to do one without a very good reason (like safety) but I figured I should ask as I&#39;m also baffled as to why any surgeon would refuse (or not respond to) a revision request in some cases even when the patient is willing to pay more.
</p>
<p>
The crap we have to put up with in the trans community is so disheartening. That of course extends so much further than the topic of surgery but to see such neglect from doctors who purport to want to help us is just...
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if you made it this far, thanks for reading!

A trans model/influencer in my country went to suporn  clinic, got surgery by dr suporn (this was a couple years ago), she had terrible complications and ultimately decided to stop dilating and let her vaginal canal to close, her name is viko volkova, she did a series of videos on her YouTube channel about the whole thing, hope this helps :/

Are you also from Mexico?
</p>
<p>
According to me, she just had a vaginal stenosis and that is why she decided to stop dilating, but she said that her result in terms of aesthetics and functionality is good.

Yes i am :) and no, she never said what it was specifically, she just said that dilation was hell ish for her, that it took at least half an hour getting one dilator in and after that she was in pain for a couple hours, also she said she was loosing depth, and that was in general why she ultimately decided to let it close :( she also adds that she is aware she needs a revision, but it’s not a thing that is pursuing right now, but yes she did said that aesthetically she is happy with the results 🙂

To clear things up a bit, Dr. Suporn is a different surgeon who is now recently retired. Dr. Bank trained under him and is the new main surgeon at the Suporn Clinic and seems to be considered on this subreddit by some to be even better than Dr. Suporn.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, yes and yes.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had surgery with Dr Bank.
</p>
<p>
I had urethra bleeding during my first night after surgery which required 4 AM emergency surgery. Wasn’t such a biggie for me back then, I was in and out anyways lol. I just needed a lot of blood afterwards. Also worth mentioning, Dr Bank came directly to the hospital in the night on a Saturday when the nurse called him. In the end, it didn’t change anything aesthetically and I’m fine now, but I guess it counts as a major complication. I also had minor separation that he fixed during a routine clinic visit while still in Thailand. All free of charge.
</p>
<p>
Regarding others, I know of someone having severe bleeding while still in the hotel in Thailand and requiring emergency surgery, but that’s not my story to tell. Although that’s supposedly really rare, just as my complication. I do however know of many people who have a hell of a time dilating and had big problems with granulation, including myself. The clinic’s advise is to let granulation heal itself—something I personally don’t agree with, as that can take forever and ruin your life in the meantime. However, I don’t think I’ve ever heard of anyone having to have surgery because either steroids or silver nitrate failed. I also haven’t heard of anyone having any of the other complications that you listed.
</p>
<p>
Yes, the clinic can refuse you revision if you don’t adhere to their rules of post op care or you simply wait too long to request a revision surgery date. Also, I’ve heard of many times, when Dr Bank refused to remove excess erectile tissue or even acknowledge that it’s even there. His reputation for revisions is rather bad in the community.
</p>
<p>
Hope some of that helps :)

Thanks so much for your reply! I have a few follow-up questions below if you have time.

Glad to hear Dr. Bank was able to fix the problem and that you are okay now!

<p>
For the women with excess erectile tissue who were unable to get a revision, do you know what the impact to them was? Like was it an aesthetic issue or were they in pain?

<p>
Wow, that&#39;s 180 degrees opposite the impression I got from reading all of the Dr. Banks posts on the WIKI of this sub. I&#39;m not doubting you at all, I realize that the WIKI, as great as it is, is limited to the people who choose to post publicly and only a small portion do, which is exactly why I made this post.
</p>
<p>
Do you know if there anywhere I can find more details on the issues that leads to this reputation?
</p>
<p>
Or is this coming from private conversions from women you met in Thailand and/or the Suporn Patient Discord? (which I realize I can&#39;t get access to without a surgery date (I&#39;ve been trying, applied to lottery twice so far).
</p>
<p>
Thanks again for your reply!

Of course, you’re welcome.

<p>
I know of one case who had pain because of it and got it removed by a surgeon in the US years later. But for most cases that I know of, it’s rather discomfort than pain or (but often both) an aesthetic issue during arousal. Sometimes resulting in not being able to have PIV intercourse because of it.

<p>
Yes, the latter. I’m sure some of the other patients might disagree with my assessment of Dr Bank’s revision reputation based on their own experience. I made mine through years of conversations on the patient’s discord and personal connections. For context, I personally only know one person who posted here on discord. Most experiences stay in the Suporn community.
</p>
<p>
Also a little heads up, that I forgot to mention before and is really rarely mentioned when speaking about revisions. While the clinic offers you a free revision, this offer is limited to in-clinic surgery under local anesthesia. Certain procedures however require general anesthesia in the hospital—which is not covered by the clinic. I’m not sure how much the hospital stay is at the moment, I think it’s around 3-4k USD. So that’s something to keep in mind. Considering that other Thai surgeons don’t even offer a free revisions at all, I still thinks it’s a great offer by the clinic.

Circling back to this.
</p>
<p>
Since it doesn&#39;t sound like there is anything more I can do to research this further on my own, is there anything else you can share about the types of issues that you think lead to this reputation, if there is more to it than the erectile tissue issue and misunderstandings about the &#34;free&#34; aspect to the revision policy? (not minimize that at all, just wondering if there is more to it)

I have yet to meet anyone who is really satisfied with his revision. Mainly his work on anterior commissure, clitoral hood and sometimes posterior commissure seems to me to be a hit-or-miss. I’ve met people who’ve had four or even five in-clinic surgeries instead of just the one planned revision, because things just kept separating or other minor complications. But I guess, that is not the rule and rather the exception.

<p>
Thanks for the details and I can understand why people would be frustrated.
</p>
<p>
For my research purposes, I am also a bit relieved to hear the nature of the issues because what I was finding with some other Thai surgeons I researched where they refused to do a revision (for unknown reasons) or did not respond to setup an evaluation appointment back in Thailand, included situations where the patient was in severe pain from a major complication that local doctors couldn&#39;t help with. And there were also plenty of cases where aesthetic revisions seemed to be arbitrarily refused.
</p>

<p>
Just to make sure I understand, is it your impression that  problems with a revision is the exception, not the rule? Or the other way around?

Sorry, I should have phrased that differently. I meant it in context of the complications and having to undergo multiple procedures.
</p>
<p>
I felt the need to say that, because Dr Bank only does a small amount of revisions per month, so while you’re in Thailand you only meet a handful of people who are there for revision. Meaning my view on revisions is based on much less experiences and might be biased.

I&#39;m going to keep applying to the lottery with Dr. Banks. If/when I am able to get surgery date and pay the deposit do you know how I would go about getting on the Discord?

EDIT: I thought the double asterisk was used to write with bold letters, sigh. At least they make the actual questions more visible I guess!
</p>
<p>
**So, is it Dr. Bank specifically who has a bad reputation with revisions? Was Dr. Suporn better at it?** If I recall it correctly, the author of &#34;A Butterfly&#39;s Journey&#34; wrote in her PDF that she had like 5 revisions or something like that with Dr. Suporn :/
</p>
<p>
**Can you have your primary surgery done by Dr. Bank and then the revision surgery done by Dr. Prae?** That is, if she does them at all.
</p>
<p>
And I&#39;m taking this opportunity to ask you, who seem to have such a valuable and deep amount of knowledge thanks to having been active in the &#34;mysterious secret Discord channel&#34;, some other questions if that&#39;s ok. I&#39;m VERY thirsty for information :(
</p>

-Not long ago I was talking with a fellow trans woman about dilation schedules. She got operated somewhere else -actually, for free, here in Spain-, and she told me they made her dilate 5 times a day, 20 minutes each time. She hypothesized that it is possible the Suporn Clinic only schedules 2-3 dilations a day because they assume you go back to work very early in the process. And that might be the case for most women going with them, but in Spain I can have a longer sick leave. I told the clinic this and asked them if they might give me a dilation schedule adapted to my specific circumstances, and they answered that yes, they might. **Do you have any information of women who had a much easier time thanks to being able to dilate more times per day? Like, someone who was not currently working or something.**
</p>
<p>
-I am circumcised, and have a small scrotum bag as well as reduced penis size because of estrogens. The clinic themselves tell you that, in these circumstances, you might be lacking several aesthetic features, since they give functionality the topmost priority. Thus, I&#39;ve been doing manual foreskin restoration for almost half a year now.
</p>
<p>
Around here, I read that for circumcised patients, there is a 50% chance of clitoral necrosis -only the cosmetic part of it, not the functional part-, which can be mended using part of the &#34;Chonburi organ&#34;. I also read an account about a doctor who had her surgery there and then talked about this with Dr. Bank. It seems he told her that, since there is less available tissue for circumcised patients, there is more tension on the stitches to keep everything together, and thus there is a much higher chance of complications post-operation. **Do you have any information about all of this?**
</p>
<p>
**And, do you know of anyone who might have had a better end result thanks to having been doing foreskin restoration?** I&#39;ve already recovered more than 1.5 cm, and I now want to focus and trying to get more inner skin, so I have the same amount of inner and outer skin -I want at least 4 cm for both-, so I&#39;ve more chances of having my minoras go all the way down to the vaginal introitus, which is the most important aesthetic goal for me. I want to look down there and see something I can see at least partially cis-passing. **In this regard, would you be able to tell me at which exact point they place the vaginal introitus?** So I can know how many centimeters of skin I need to achieve my goal. I know that it&#39;s probably not that simple, and that skin elasticity and all of that might also be a factor, but I just want an estimation to go with so I can adapt my restoration process accordingly.
</p>
<p>
The clinic also told me I might be able to get more scrotal skin by pulling that skin in the shower everyday. **How do I do that exactly? Do you know anything about this?**
</p>
<p>
-I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to get my sick leave BEFORE going to Thailand -I have an appointment with my family doctor this month to see if it&#39;ll be possible. **Do you know of any woman who was able to get their sick leave from there?** I&#39;m specially interested in cases from Spain, of course.
</p>
<p>
-**Is the clitoris they give you always sensitive?** I feel almost nothing from my glans now, and I think it&#39;s because I&#39;ve been circumcised, so that skin has been keratinized. Now that I&#39;m doing foreskin restoration, there are times where my glans get covered by my growing foreskin, and after having been covered for some hours, my glans actually feel much better when I touch it. So I was wondering if clitoris sensitivity depens on being on having enough skins for it to be less exposed, a.k.a having a clitoral hood and prominent enough labia minora. **Bottom of the line: do you know if people with less available skin got less sensitive clitoris or no sensitivity at all?**
</p>
<p>
-The goddamn lottery system. **Is there anyone who knows for sure it is indeed a lottery? Does anyone have any suspicions of them prioritizing some women over others? Like, for example, the ones that have more available tissue, or younger, or older, or whatever.** I really hope that&#39;s not the case!
</p>
<p>
-There is almost no information about Dr. Prae&#39;s work here in Reddit. **Do you have more information about her results?**
</p>
<p>
And I think that&#39;s all. I know that&#39;s A LOT, and that you might probably not know the answer to a lot of them. But it is the first time I&#39;m able to directly ask someone who says they are in the Discord channel. Getting some more information would really put me a bit more at ease. Thank you in any case.

Okay yeah that’s a lot, I’m gonna keep it short.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So, is it Dr. Bank specifically who has a bad reputation with revisions? Was Dr. Suporn better at it?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I honestly don’t know. I suspect Dr Suporn was at least open to removing excess erectile tissue or left less behind during primary.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Can you have your primary surgery done by Dr. Bank and then the revision surgery done by Dr. Prae?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, you can do that and people are already getting their revision dates with Dr Prae.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Do you have any information of women who had a much easier time thanks to being able to dilate more times per day? Like, someone who was not currently working or something.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No. Many of us were able to take a long time off at work, but if you’re having a bad time dilating, you’ll be struggling even doing it 3x a day. It’s not unheard of that a dilation session can go over hours during what the clinic calls “difficult period”. Dilating 4 or more times just isn’t possible. And not just because of the time, but you may also have significant pain—and that drains your energy and sours your mood (to put it lightly). And if your recovery is going well, then I don’t see a point in dilating more than necessary. In contrary, it might even cause you trouble. Dilate as least as possible, but as often as necessary.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And, do you know of anyone who might have had a better end result thanks to having been doing foreskin restoration?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, I don’t. Sorry, that’s not really my field of knowledge. But I know of quite a few people who were circumcised and had surgery with him. And I know a few people who have lost their whole tip of the clitoris due to necrosis. I suspect most patients get at least a little bit of necrosis on there and it is nothing to worry about. But again, I’m not sure how that corresponds to circumcision.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this regard, would you be able to tell me at which exact point they place the vaginal introitus?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m not sure how to answer your question, I think it’s best to ask the clinic on that one.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How do I do that exactly? Do you know anything about this?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s the first time I’ve heard of that.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Do you know of any woman who was able to get their sick leave from there?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The clinic can certainly give you paperwork for sick leave. But I don’t know if the clinic’s letter satisfies spanish regulations. You can ask the clinic on that one, if you haven’t already.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is the clitoris they give you always sensitive?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As I said, necrosis is a thing that can happen and so is sensitivity loss. There’s no “always”.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bottom of the line: do you know if people with less available skin got less sensitive clitoris or no sensitivity at all?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nope, I don’t know. At least I’ve never read about that.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yeah their system isn’t great. But I’ve never read that anyone suspected them of preferment of patients. And I personally don’t think so as well.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I do, but I can’t share them here. Sorry. She seems to be doing well, however. I’m confident that with time you will find more experiences with her here on Reddit.

Thanks, thanks a lot for your answers, it really means a lot!
</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
Do you mean the whole clitoris or just the tip of it? Because you also said...
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
But I also said that: I read that for circumcised patients, there is a 50% chance of clitoral necrosis -only the cosmetic part of it, not the functional part-, which can be mended using part of the &#34;Chonburi organ&#34;.
</p>
<p>
So are there cases where there is necrosis of the functional, sensitive part of the clitoris as well? And so it cannot be saved by using the excess glans tissue stored within the &#34;Chonburi Organ&#34;?
</p>
<p>
Do you know how common that is, more or less? I mean, I&#39;d still be willing to take the risk, it&#39;s not like I want to use what I have for sexual purposes anyway so it&#39;s as if I don&#39;t have any sensitivity already. But this still certainly scares me :(
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Thank you for also answering this one. I want to believe in people as well, but I always worry because this is the most important thing in my life, and it all depends on pure luck.
</p>

<p>
I was not referring to &#34;photographic information&#34;, but just general information. For example...
</p>
<p>
-How do you think it compares to Dr. Bank&#39;s work both aesthetically and in terms of &#34;realism&#34;? Placement of each part in the correct tridimensional position, as well as similarity with natal vulvas. In my opinion. Dr. Bank produces the most natal-looking vulvas in the whole world, Is she more or less close to him?
</p>
<p>
-What about complication rates? I know there might still be not enough data about her results to answer this one though.
</p>
<p>
-And sensitivity? Functionality? Peeing and the like.
</p>
<p>
Again, thanks a lot! :)

</blockquote>
<p>
I only meant the tip as in “the visible part”, whereas the underlying nerves, the “Chonburi Organ”, were kept intact and Dr Bank was able to reconstruct the clitoris in revision with those nerves.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’d say most patients get some necrosis on their clit. It’s often just a little and doesn’t cause problems. I even know someone who is able to orgasm solely through the Chonburi organ after loosing the whole clitoris. But I don’t know how often the complete loss of clitoris is reported. However, there was a study done by the clinic a few years back (2019?). If you haven’t done so already, you might want to check that out.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Me neither. Sorry, I’m not gonna talk about Dr Prae and her work. That’s for someone else to do.

Do you know where I can find that info?  I only heard of the necrosis possibility from a friend in the last few weeks, and it&#39;s something I&#39;d

I don’t know why your formatting is not working, it looks like it should. Maybe the editor you’re using?

I see this link here says &#34;If, instead, you click &#34;Switch to markdown&#34; on the post-submission screen, then you&#39;ll be submitting Markdown.&#34; I didn&#39;t do that, but I think I cannot do it anymore now? I don&#39;t remember even seeing the option, though. Thank  you in any case for you for your selfless help here ;)
