Don´t know if you have seen it ...
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/uvx0gh/how_big_a_deal_is_postop_canal_hair_growth/content.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>
might be some hints that could help.
</p>
<p>
And it may be an option to contact a few surgeons who do revisions, and ask about their opinion. Some may cauterize the tissue.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
might be some examples, and

may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time.

Do you mean the surgeon did electrolysis?
</p>
<p>
Has internal hair caused you any problems, or is it only cosmetic?

Yeah, electrolysis is what my surgeon said she did in the operative report. She didn’t indicate how many she zapped. She did that before she began the other parts of my revision surgery, which included redoing my urethra, removing excess erectile tissue, repositioning my clitoris and opening my forchette more.
</p>
<p>
And definitely. The hairs make it more challenging to keep an odor from developing. When I wasn’t diligent about tweezing, sometimes I’d feel a kind of “internal irritation” that seemed impossible to really relieve. Though since my revision surgery, I’ve been using Good Clean Love every couple of days when I dilate and that has helped significantly with odor.
