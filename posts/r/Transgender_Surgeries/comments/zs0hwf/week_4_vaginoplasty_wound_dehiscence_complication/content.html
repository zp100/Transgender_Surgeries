I was literally where you are a month ago just my open wound was way bigger - it&#39;s closed completely now, there is some added scarring from it but otherwise it&#39;s good. Just be sure to keep it clean, my doctor told me to use &#34;Aquacell&#34; on it until it closed up. :)

Thanks. I really appreciate the positive comments. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for this emotional journey. I was prepared for recovery but emotionally it‚Äôs draining and not know what it‚Äôll end up looking like. I am documenting this journey for others who want full depth bottom surgery, but I also hope this will be something I can look back at and say it was all worth it. I really really appreciate you guys giving me these words of encouragement

After surgery there can be additional post op depressions due to anesthetics. It may wear off after a number of weeks.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/gender_therapists/index" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
might be a number of resources concerning looking for a gender therapist in case. Atm many use online counseling so it may not be necessary to only look for close ones.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/support/index#wiki_connecting_to_others" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransAdoption/comments/nnz697/join_the_trans_galaxy_an_18_inclusive_safe_space/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
might be a number of hints concerning looking for support and connecting to others.
</p>
<p>
Additionally
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/surgeries/transfeminine/index#wiki_after_surgery" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
might be some resources that could also help.
</p>
<p>
And for local aftercare some people ask at lgbt places or support groups for a referral. And

was also a discussion.

Wait for the left labia majora to heal, I don&#39;t think it is nearly as bad as you think it is.
