I&#39;m 23 (U.S.) and I&#39;ve finally decided that I do want to get a vaginoplasty someday. Like the title suggests, I want to know how important it is to pick a top surgeon. I&#39;ve looked at the trifecta (Bowers, McGinn, Meltzer), but there are other surgeons who have fewer requirements and shorter waitlists and seem totally fine.
</p>
<p>
For context, I&#39;m transitioning in stealth. I don&#39;t plan on coming out to my work and school until I already feel like I&#39;m sort of &#34;passing&#34; already. This will (hopefully) happen in the next 9-12 months. This kinda makes RLE/RLT a dealbreaker for me, since it&#39;ll tack on an additional year of dead air
<em>
on top of
</em>
the surgeons waitlist. I&#39;ll wait forever for my surgery if I have to, but I&#39;d rather get it done in 1 year than in 5.
</p>
<p>
So like I&#39;ve heard of nightmare surgeons like Rumor and amazing surgeons like McGinn. What do I have to lose by choosing a surgeon in the middle? Are there any red flags? Any green flags, for that matter? How did you choose yours? Any info would be super helpful

I wouldn&#39;t be worried about RLE/RLT. Actually they
<em>
don&#39;t
</em>
care how &#34;femenine&#34; presenting you are, they only care about your soundness of mind and your fundamental understanding of what you&#39;re embarking on.
</p>
<p>
I showed up to my psych analysis + social worker meetings for surgery letters (pre-vaginoplasty consult)..... 6 months into hrt.
</p>
<p>
I was age 24 and wearing boy clothes. A basic navy cotton buttondown shirt from uniqlo and forest green chinos from banana republic. And my skateboard shoes. I hadn&#39;t even cut long boy hair at the time and I wore no makeup. I didn&#39;t even have my ears pierced yet and wasn&#39;t wearing any jewelry. My nails were trimmed short and I had no polish on.
</p>
<p>
I told them I was still going by my deadname at my job and with my students, although I had come out in most instances.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the psychiatrist at Dr. Ting&#39;s office is a trans man in his 50s. The social worker is a trans woman in her 40s.
</p>
<p>
I received my letters of support 3 days later.
</p>
<p>
And still to this day, 2 years later and 9 months post-op, I continue to present &#34;GNC&#34; most of the time. I still got the same guy voice. I rarely shave my legs or rarely ever shave my armpits. I often still go out with a few days of worth of stubble to work or hangouts with friends. And I will never change that for a partner.
</p>
<p>
I guess my point is they don&#39;t give a shit what you look like. Because those appointments are not even about that. It&#39;s about what&#39;s inside
<em>
you
</em>
, your soulshine. So rejoice and be yourself (:
</p>
<p>
And schedule those consults now! Your future self will thank you.

It matters. Make sure you research your surgeons thoroughly before making a decision.

Get a consultation asap.  My surgeon let me schedule for when I would have my rle, not have to wait for it.
