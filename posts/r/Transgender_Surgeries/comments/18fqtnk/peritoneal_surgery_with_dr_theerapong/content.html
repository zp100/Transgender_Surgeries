Hello
</p>
<p>
I wondered if anyone has any experience of peritoneal surgery with Dr Theerapong Poonyakariyagorn.  I have limited genetic material to work with as I have had hormone suppressors since 13 and cross hormones at 17.  I was originally going to have surgery with Mr Inglefield in the UK next year but the London Transgender Clinic has now gone into liquidation.  He was offering a peno-scrotal flap technique.
</p>
<p>
I would appreciate any advice from anyone particularly if they have been on suppressors and don&#39;t have a lot of material to start with. It&#39;s a Jazz Jennings situation. The peritoneal surgery seems so new and I would be glad to hear from anyone who has had this.
</p>
<p>
Have been in touch with Interplast who seem to think peritoneal is the solution. Thank you!
</p>

I had PPV with Dr Theerapong about 6 weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
Started HRT at 25 and had plenty of tissue to work with. I can&#39;t imagine it would be a huge issue with the PPV technique, as it allows for more depth, and more Penile/scrotal tissue for aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
Very happy with aesthetics. I have 6.5-7&#34; of depth. Its currently quite swollen but reducing slowly, which is quite normal for any vaginoplasty. I had no complications and I&#39;m really happy with my experience and result.
</p>
<p>
Cost me 600k baht in surgical fees. Factor in a bit more for aftercare, flights and accommodation.
</p>
<p>
I dont know too much about booking directly with the Interplast clinic. I booked mine with Amani Thailand, and they were exceptional.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to AMA.

From first emailing them how long were each of your milestones? (Consultation, surgery, flying home etc?) I&#39;m starting to more and more consider theerapong after a few rejections from the suporn clinic.

I first emailed Amani Thailand 7th August this year. I&#39;m not sure how Interplast is when going direct; good hopefully, if you choose that route ü§û
</p>
<p>
Surgery date was confirmed and 20% deposit paid 2 weeks later.
</p>
<p>
Arrived in Thailand on 25th October. First in person consult on the 27th, Hospital admission on the 30th for surgery the following day.
</p>
<p>
Discharged on the 5th November, and returned home on the 24th (Thailand -&gt; UK), it was a very unremarkable flight (sitting was fine with a doughnut cushion).
</p>
<p>
Walking was comfortable after about 2 weeks, after most of the stitches are removed. I can run if I need to from about 5 weeks post op, and will resume normal exercise next month.
</p>
<p>
Hopes this helps!

That is the single fastest turnaround on a surgery I&#39;ve ever heard of! What did you need to do before they&#39;d accept you as a client? Psychologists note? Visa etc?
</p>
<p>
And yes, that is extremely helpful, thank you.

I get 30 days visa free with a British passport. Many other nationalities do also, so confirm with yours to be sure.
</p>
<p>
I had no Psychiatry letters before arriving. Amani Thailand booked me in with 2 Thai Psychiatrists on the day of my admission, it cost around 2,000 baht, so not expensive. I live in Australia and don&#39;t get rebates for non emergency medicine, so would have cost me $500+ AUD for a single letter üò¨
</p>
<p>
They required hair removal, 12 months of HRT and 12 months of &#39;real life experience&#39;. BMI of 25+ results in an extra fee (if its laparoscopic surgery ie. PPV or colon). The above is self reported, but I would absolutely recommend not skipping hair removal at the very minimum.

Ok, the hair removal would be the only gripe then. Is there a specific area you need to deal with or do you pretty much need it all gone? How long did it take you? What method did you use and how painful was it? Because I can&#39;t really imagine how electrolysis pain transfers from lips to down there üò¨

I did Laser only, starting last year September (14 sessions total iirc). There&#39;s been a few stray hairs on the labia minora, near the vagina, but nothing inside thankfully üôè
</p>
<p>
For context, I have light skin (Fitzpatrick T2) and dark brown hair. I&#39;ve had great results from laser so far.
</p>
<p>
IMO, electrolysis is definitely more reliable. In a perfect world, I would start with laser and finish up with electrolysis. Electrolysis did wonders for my facial hair, but god it&#39;s awful.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck! ü©∑
</p>
<p>
Edit: Dr Theerapong will ask for hair removal around the base of the penis, the scrotum (particularly the central third iirc), and around the perineum especially.

Thanks for all your help, you&#39;ve definitely answered a lot of the questions I had about theerapong that I hadn&#39;t had the chance to research yet üòä good luck with the rest of your recovery!

forgive me if this is random but do you know by any chance if he works ppv? (edit lol i can read forive me) As well does he do revisions. I know this could b outside of what you heard and saw but I can&#39;t find too much on him but I heard he works revisions and I am really hoping he can help me out after the horrible care I had here in Australia.

I got ppv done here in Australia by Dr Hart. I thought I was gonna die in the hospital even was deny pain killers at some stages as well just very much ignore by alot of the staff.
</p>
<p>
Even past this tho I am about a year and half in and I still get alot of pain and I am straight up missing a clitoris and outer labia. Dr Hart more or less has just said this is fine which I disagree greatly but he refused to do anything else.
</p>
<p>
So yea idk I feel alot of folks talk higher of Dr Hart but he has legit ruined my life and the rest of the systems here in Australia do nothing to help.
</p>
<p>
I said it before if you can go anywhere other than here for this type of surgery please do so. I truly believe Dr Hart shouldn&#39;t b allowed to practiced this care is sub standard and will drop you if he feels like it

He fixed my old Scrotal PI from Kamol 2019 mid summer with Sigmoid Colon 2022 late fall and it works well 7 1/2 inches depth maybe a bit more but not good at aesthetic external revisions quit frankly, he speaks English but I was never given a one one consult  privately so aesthetically I have a mess that looks exactly the same as the original Kamol fuckery !!  I got 1 st time  and they‚Äôve/Theerapong cut ties with me , Black Listed I guess - it‚Äôs the ‚Äú Saving Face ‚Äú asian pay back if you bitch not being happy - all this was caused by a greedy snarky Thai Speaking EX US Texas patriot married to a Thai man that got involved to make extra money living in Bangkok ! This person at the old ‚ÄúST‚Äù I dealt with at the time is No longer involved thankfully  but caused me a lot money I paid gone down the toilet because of greed and problems post op having a relationship with Theerapong involved as the Surgeon ( What was said in Thai Language to Theerapong by this person I‚Äôll never know covering her greedy assed butt ) - now I struggle getting things fixed all over again aesthetically at almost 66 - Don‚Äôt get Blacklisted all I can say - Interplast won‚Äôt even acknowledge I exist now !  Wow !

I have not had my SRS yet, but he is my choice of surgeon, I chose him after a very long investigation, his results are excellent in terms of aesthetics (one of the best I have seen in the world) and functionality, in my case I decided on the sigmoid colon technique, but I have seen many successful cases of Dr. Theerapong&#39;s peritoneal technique.
