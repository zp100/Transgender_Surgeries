A second professional opinion on how things can be resolved sounds a must.

<p>
As a general help, have you tried finely ground psyllium husk powder.

I&#39;m not familiar with sigmoid blood supply but am sure I&#39;ve seen a paper with mesh used to fix a prolapse of sigmoid srs.

I&#39;ve uploaded the paper to here:
<a href="https://www.docdroid.net/ZbxKokh/laparoscopic-promontofixation-for-the-treatment-of-recurrent-pdf">https://www.docdroid.net/ZbxKokh/laparoscopic-promontofixation-for-the-treatment-of-recurrent-pdf</a>

<blockquote>
<p>
Laparoscopic Promontofixation for the Treatment of Recurrent Sigmoid Neovaginal Prolapse: Case Report and Systematic Review of the Literature
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is the correction of a prolapse in a Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome girl with sigmoid canal.
</p>
<p>
Was just scanning it, so a repair was attempted with mesh, but it didn&#39;t work so they found a better way to fix. However the point is that she still had both the mesh and sigmoid cancal in after the final working fix.
</p>
<p>
Lots of useful surgical images in it too for a surgeon!

I commented on another comment, but I&#39;m wondering why the prolapse of the bowel means removing the vaginal canal unless they fused together and they cannot separate the tissue. People with vaginas have rectal prolapses fixed without losing their canal. What did they do/test for to come to this conclusion?
</p>
<p>
Edit: is it because of the blood supply?

Well, the main point is that the study girl has the same as you plus mesh all in the same area, indicating that in principle hopefully there shouldn&#39;t be an issue. Though the final method used to fix her prolapse might also be useful for you. The two canals run right next to each other.

You can always get PPT revision if colon graft fails. Good luck.

Omg that’s horrifying. Girls planing on getting srs should definitely remove colon srs from their list, I didn’t even know something like this could happen to you. how’ve you contacted Kamol about it? He should be able to fix it. If you don’t mind me asking, but why would you agree to get sigmoid srs when you know you have had a constipation problem, did he pressure you into getting it with the benefits? It does some really good things about it, but if you can get a prolapse than it’s not worth.

Its not colon method thats the issue its the actual surgeon. I heard lots of bad stories from Kamol hospital.  If he as a doctor was competent he wouldn&#39;t operate on op before ruling out the issue with constipation and their rectal prolapse they had before srs.
</p>
<p>
I had colon method last year and one of the first questions i was asked is about how regular i was when i pooped and general questions to assess my bowel health. I was told if i had bowel issues i would not be able to get colon vaginoplasty.

This. I know surgeons who require a colonoscopy first to make sure you can get it. If they aren&#39;t listening or ensuring things are ok it&#39;s a surgeon thing not a type of surgery thing. I feel like he tries to lure people in with aesthetics but doesn&#39;t seem to care about the insides. This gives the colon surgery a bad rep. I think he also does open surgery for Colo?

I see it depends on the doctor. It’s always good to do research on the surgeon before deciding on something as important as srs. OP should have known better if she had problem’s before though.

In the U.S. you are supposed to get a colonoscopy before a colovaginoplasty. This rules out any issues. I do not know if they do that at that clinic. Prolapse can happen with PPV too, hell even PI even if it&#39;s rarer. It happens with hysterectomies too. It&#39;s all about pelvic floor and how the canal is anchored.
</p>
<p>
OP, can you see a second surgeon to see if they can repair the prolapse without it cutting off blood supply? Would you be ok with a repair that shortens your canal (just a little not like inches)? A PPV surgery would be the repair surgery and my understanding is there can&#39;t be anything in the abdomen that would hinder using the peritoneal tissue.

Yeah, I wonder if just part of the canal could be removed and then replaced with PPV surgery to extend?

That’s terrible. I’m so sorry this happened to you sister. Kamol is a evil place. I researched Kamol after seeing this post. It has a bad reputation on Reddit, and should be avoided at all cost. I hope you recover and have the best life you can have.
