Any useful advice you can give to those considering zero depth?
</p>
<p>
What are the pros and cons of doing it his way?

The aesthetics definetly changed with this, but it is becoming more pleasing as healing continues - I was worried it would not.

<p>
Why and how did the aesthetics change? I thought it would all be internal and there would be no external differences.

I will find an original pic and take a current and post so it can be seen. Mostly to. R its less pleasing looking but its really starting to look better as of late.
</p>
<p>
Where the canal starts to go inwards, it cause, what I can best describe as, a separation in my labia so to speak. Its not bad bit I see it and am hoping it does change over time.

After the original vulvoplasty - took me 8 months to figure out how to orgasm.
</p>
<p>
After canal - 4 months. I can easily orgasm now as I want. Seems to be more options to get there all of a sudden ü§óü§≠üòäüòÅ

Not from swelling. He had to cut into both labia to form around my urethra so the canal would have a separation from my urethra. It was sore/numb/swollen from that.
</p>
<p>
My clit was sore and swollen as it developed a skin covering that lessened sensation and confined it too much. He removed that (and its soo much better now!)

My lower abdomen. My depth is about 5.5 inches right now. I think i can get closer to 6 but im not pushing it now due to the issues Ive had with the granulation tissues. When the packing was removed that device was burried and was bigger than 6&#34; - so I think once I start trying more I should hopefully have about that.
</p>
<p>
Thanks about the labia!  It&#39;s hard when it comes to your self but I&#39;m just a bit hard on me most times.

Its actually doing pretty well!  Its definetly visible but blending in more and more. I think by the 1 year mark it should be no longer very noticeable.  I cant even feel it when I run my fingers across - its quite seamless. The feeling is good too, as if that strip of skin wasn&#39;t cut out. The nerves seemed to have just reconnected without issue. If it wasn&#39;t for the redish purpleness of the scar it wouldn&#39;t be noticeable at all.
</p>
<p>
Follow me and I will post a pic later about it. I&#39;ll also post a before/after of my labia so the differences can be seen.

We both seem to have an enlarged pelvis. Was it like that before or you think it is swelling, and has it been improving?
</p>
<p>
No doubt a lot of mine is fat. I am not lean at all. Just it also feels numb so I assume swelling. I am 4 months out from srs.

It wasn&#39;t thay way until I had my orchy. Pretty sure it was mainly swelling - but it came back after my vaginoplasty and seemed to have stayed. I&#39;m not overweight or anything so I dont know if it is still swelling or just some fat from when I was overweight. Ive not yet figured out an easy way to lose it either.

I had a zero-depth almost a month ago. I thought I was ace before my surgery, but since having it things in my brain have... changed. I actually regret not getting the canal, something I swear to myself I wouldn&#39;t feel. I was super convinced that I had figured myself out sexually. Oh well, lol.
</p>
<p>
May I DM you some questions about your experiences and what the recovery has been like?
