I’m in a lot of pain at the moment and the surgeon refused to give me any painkillers. He suggested i take tylenol. So that’s fun.

I called the office earlier and left a message asking if I could have something stronger than tylenol prescribed for a couple of days because I feel pretty uncomfortable.

The only woman I&#39;ve known irl to have it done did it under local at her doctor&#39;s office. She was an emt and wasn&#39;t freaked out by watching. How was the process of getting approved for the surgery?

The surgery didn&#39;t need to be pre approved and I was able to get the surgery 3 weeks out from my consolation. I needed a letter from my phycologist. Didn&#39;t get the bill yet but it should be around 500$

That&#39;s great insurance. A lot of them still require jumping through hoops and are more expensive.

They only cover bottom surguries which is great but a little saddening they don&#39;t cover anything else and say anything else is cosmetic.  I was hoping I could get BA but I will try and submit a claim for it and try and get it covered.
