<p>
I (29, m, cis) am dating a girl I am absolutely head over heels in love with (24, f) who got bottom surgery about 24 hours ago. We met about 9 months ago, and when she told me she was planning a bottom surgery, we kind of planned to end our (very casual, very physical) relationship when she was approaching surgery. The problem, of course, is that we fell in love.
</p>
<p>
I love her to death, and Iâ€™m looking for advice/tips for the next few weeks/months.  Iâ€™m currently her primary caregiver during her immediate recovery, which mainly involves keeping her company in the hospital, talking to her family/friends, and starting Friday, doing all the tasks she canâ€™t (cooking, cleaning, and driving) while she recovers in a local hotel.
</p>
<p>
I want to be the best caregiver possible in the next couple months, so Iâ€™m looking for advice or perspectives from people who have gone through this before - especially people who have had bottom surgery or been primarily caregivers for partners who got it. Anything from physical stuff, like how to keep her most comfortable, to emotional stuff, like what people typically experience after surgery, would be really helpful.
</p>
<p>
Seriously, any advice would be SO appreciated.
</p>
<p>
Thank you in advance!

<p>
Ok. Actual advice time!
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Food. Figure out her favorite proteins. Protein helps wound healing tremendously. My girlfriend bought me protein shakes, meal prepped a lot of food - protein and greens (green contain iron. She will NEED iron after surgery) so. Meal prep for her. Food feeds wound healing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Vitamins. Multi vitamin plus slow release iron if she doesnâ€™t like greens.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ice packs. Swelling sucks. Stores like target and Walmart sell refteezeable ice packs. I find that the ones for elbows work the best. They are the perfect shape for a vulva. Ice 5-10 minutes at a time. She wonâ€™t have much feeling, so watch for ice burns.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Essentials: maxi pads, panty liners. Lube. You know those wee pads for puppy training? Theyâ€™re great for discharge so you donâ€™t ruin your sheets. Also. Buying a few packs of wash clothes in order to not waste a ton if towels with dilating is useful. Flushable wipes because toilet paper will suck for awhile.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Pillows. Body pillow. Fluffy pillows. Comfy, oversized sweat pants/shorts. Loose and comfy shorts. Maybe a fan. I tended to have hot flashes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Make sure whatever medicine she goes home with does not run out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Paper plates/bowls/utensils take the burden of dishes sash and is super helpful.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Protein packed snacks. Granola bars. Shakes, snd throw in a couple things she just likes just because. Costco sells a 3 pack of water bottles. She needs do stay hydrated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Shower chair. Youâ€™re going to need to help her shower the first few times. A chair in the shower is super helpful
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Youâ€™re gonna so great. Being an affirming and loving partner is so critical.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

I got hot flashes with my orchie, and am lining up bottom surgery proper. Any of you ladies who got them done separately too, did you experience hot flashes again? I hadn&#39;t expected to.

I never had an orchie prior. So maybe the flashes were because of testicle removal?

Recovery is going to be

intense

. It was the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever gone through. She is going to need help with small things, like getting water or food.

Okay, thatâ€™s good to know. I expected this, I went grocery shopping today to prep a bunch of food for when she returns to the hotel. We donâ€™t have an oven, but we do have a small fridge and a microwave and an air fryer, so I think weâ€™ll be good.
</p>
<p>
Did any specific foods help as you were recovering? What kind of stuff did you want to eat/were helpful?

Stuff that is easy to eat reclined! I couldn&#39;t sit upright for quite a while and some foods are very hard to eat when you are reclining and others are much easier. Also I did not want anything real heavy or rich.

For me, very simple whole foods to start as all the meds and a sleepy digestive tract can be rough, then progressively back to a more of a normal diet as time goes on.

My wife had her bottom surgery recently, the only advice I can give is to prepare/provide as much comfort food (emphasize on proteins) as possible.  Keep her stress levels as low as possible.  Also, don&#39;t disregard/downplay any complaints of pain, as they may be signs of serious complications.

Help her do things around ur hotel and house when u return home,let her just rest, nothing over 5lbs., Don&#39;t let her constantly get up and down have her rest . At least 30 days post op. Don&#39;t push sex on her she needs to wait at least 3 months to have sex or whenever she is comfortable. DONT PUSH HER. but most importantly just support her. She shouldn&#39;t drive, walk far, lift, drag pull etc. Till she is comfortable I am 25 days post op tried driving bad idea. I&#39;m gonna wait a few more weeks. Hope this helps.

This is great advice, thank you. Funnily enough our anniversary kinda falls around the time that her doctor says she may be intimate again, so weâ€™re postponing sex for a kind of anniversary reconnection, which helps alleviate the frustration of not being intimate for a couple months lol. But itâ€™s good advice not to be married to that timeline, so thank you.

Be aware of your own feelings, don&#39;t just push them down. Suddenly taking care of someone you know as an equal partner has
<em>
so
</em>
many facets and at some point you will inevitably become frustrated, whether you realize it or not.
</p>
<p>
Try to be mindful of that so you wont inadvertently make her feel like it&#39;s her fault...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m nearly 6m post-op and my boyfriend and I just had a rather intense &#34;discussion&#34; because well, we both miss sex and I just can&#39;t atm. It&#39;s not like he just threw insults or was a dick, but it&#39;s a constant strain and things escalate a little more quickly than they should.

Going to mention (since I donâ€™t see it here yet), entertaining stuff to keep the two of you from getting bored. Try to keep it potentially low involvement on her part, she may be too tired (mentally and physically) to stay engaged with most things for too long early on. My partner and I brought our Nintendo Switches, both our laptops for gaming/art, watching lots of Netflix/movies and such.
</p>
<p>
Lots of comfy bed/sofa/chair items (blankets/pillows/etc) for her to prop up on to eat/dilate/watch tv or whatever she will want to do. It lets her stay super comfy and warm too (icing constantly has made me cold more often than I care to admit ðŸ˜…)
</p>
<p>
Compassion, understanding, and love are the biggest things to bring her by far though. Her mental health will need just as much nursing as her physical. Though this will hopefully end up being very rewarding for her (and you by extension), it is still a bit of a trial for you both. You are an amazing person for doing this with her! Best of luck, hope she heals quickly, and you two enjoy it!

This is great advice! I actually got her a switch as she approached surgery, and sheâ€™s been elbow-deep in Breath of the Wild at the hospital. It was a great purchase, it really helps her get out of her body for a bit - what other games did you play while recovering?
</p>
<p>
Also, the extra pillows idea is very good, Iâ€™ll pick some up asap

As for games. I found like super dreamy mellow games like Animal Crossing or Pokemon Snap (stuff like that) really helped me when I suffered depressive episodes. It just helped me not have to face the world around me.

I am really into PokÃ©mon, so any of those (if you two want to play together, Letâ€™s Go Eevee/Pikachu has couch coop). My partner and I are really into Fire Emblem: Three Houses (Strategy Game), and the new one Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes (Dynasty Warriors type game). Mario Party is always fun, same with Super Smash Bros. I was super into Animal Crossing too (the chore-like parts helped take my mind off things)

Hello hun and contacts to your partner!
</p>
<p>
I was the caregiver for a friend back in October and November of last year. It sounds like you have the basics covered with cooking and cleaning and such. Here are some things that helped my friend while I was taking care of her. Iâ€™ll try not to repeat advice already given.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Night dresses. I know shorts and loose pants are most comfortable but the dress helps keep things breezy and flowy. That area can stay moist which can be both a good and bad thing so we did a lot of dresses with panties and a pad. Most of the time she just stayed on her bed pad with nothing on underneath.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Minimize her walking!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough. Wound separation will happen and movement can potentially make that worse. Of course sheâ€™ll need to walk to the bathroom and back but I moved her bed out to the living room to reduce the distance of the walk.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Set timers for her medication. I had regular alarms that went off when she needed her meds. There are so many bottles and times to take things that a set schedule made things so much easier. Iâ€™m an overly organized person but even the pill schedule was hard to manage. I tried to align meds together so that she didnâ€™t feel like she was taking pills all day. Some pills required doses at like 3am and 6am. This was tough but I keep the burden of the pills on me and woke her for meds and then encouraged her to go back to sleep.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Buy a water bottle! Keep it filled. She needs to drink water constantly. I got one of the ones that have times down the side so she knew how much was required of her per hour. In addition to drinks, I got juices, especially cranberry juice (itâ€™s possible sheâ€™ll develop and UTI, not uncommon), Gatorade, and her favorite soda. Point is keep up the fluids.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do not let her use a wash cloth or loofa to wash down there. It has the potential to get caught on stitches and it hurts! Non scented gentle soap and her hands will be enough to get the job done.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Useful items. We had a wedge pillow to sleep on. Sheâ€™s not allowed to sit up for the first few weeks to a month. A bed tray so that she had a place close by to keep all her electronics for quick and easy access. A personal handheld bidet. She cannot wipe the area and so she did a lot of rinsing. Iâ€™ll give vaginal tips in a bit for her. A cane. We used this in the beginning for the first doctor appointment to help her walk. Sheâ€™ll be very weak and it was nice to have the extra support as I helped her to and from the car and doctorâ€™s office.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Entertainment. Oh boy!!! This was a big one. My friend is a social butterfly who cannot stay put. Lazing around and watching tv or playing games all day sounds great but itâ€™ll get old really fast. Make sure to talk regularly and bring tissue, chances are sheâ€™ll be emotional and vulnerable. Those tears will come. But make sure to open the windows and curtains/blinds (if itâ€™s not too hot). A little sun goes a long way and being able to hear the outside world helps. I see that you are in a hotel, so being creative in entertainment might be a bit tricky. I hope the hotel stay isnâ€™t too long. I was with my friend across the country for 2 months in an AirBnB and we still got tired of the same old rooms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Okay these tips are for her specifically.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dont wipe your vagina. Pat pat is key.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
After doing number 2. Wipe front to back while doing the regular reach around. Carful to not reach too far to the front to wipe back. Use bidet afterwards with a wet wipe.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
donâ€™t push to pee. Go when you need to but using your new muscles to push isnâ€™t a good thing. You could hurt yourself.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
my friend lifted the toilet seat to go peepee. She said there was less pressure on her wound site.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
itâ€™s okay to sit with your legs open but dont let your vagina dry out.  -discharge is normal and a wound site smell is normal. Donâ€™t panic. Youâ€™ll KNOW if something isnâ€™t right.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lastly, Iâ€™m so proud of you! This was a huge step and a scary one too! You got this! Both of you do! Congratulations!
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Iâ€™ll send you a DM with my phone number. Please feel free to reach out if you need advice or help with anything!

I went through surgery recovery alone. That sucked. Be there for her as much as humanly possible.
</p>
<p>
A lot of good advice in this thread I won&#39;t repeat, but to add: you&#39;re probably gunna be making a lot of saline for douching, you don&#39;t have enough lube, promise, keep an eye out for post surgical mood / mental health issues - post op depression is very much a thing, and shit got dark there for a while for me (like grippy sock vacation), and as much as it sucks, moving is good for healing; don&#39;t force it, but do try to make sure they&#39;re not just on bed rest for a few months.

Be there for her emotionally. Take care of her physical needs just like you would for an infant. If she is in pain don&#39;t let her suffer alone. Even if you think she doesn&#39;t want to be touched offer a shoulder to lean on and cry on. Gently stroke get arm or back. Be connected!
</p>
<p>
Edit: I went through this and my caregiver was emotionally disconnected and I felt very abandoned. (She was on heavy meds herself at the time.)

A piece of advice I haven&#39;t seen on here yet is set up and clean up. Not sure what version of surgery you&#39;re partner had but, if she has to use dialators then there&#39;s a lot of set up and clean up involved. Every time it&#39;s time to dilate get the area set up and comfortable as possible for her. Afterwards take care of washing everything and cleaning the area up and put away. It helps take some of the physical and emotional burden off of them.

Okay absolutely, hadnâ€™t even thought of that so itâ€™s good to know. Dilating is a bit of a mystery to me - should I get a special soap? Guessing the doctors explain everything, but Iâ€™m heading to cvs in like an hour anyway so I could just snag some lol

I had no help post operatively (7 weeks post-op, and two weeks post op VFS). And the hardest part was probably just having food - nutritious food. I think ensuring plenty of iron and protein in her diet will go a long way - and if it&#39;s stuff she likes/reasonably tasty all the better.

I know this doesn&#39;t help but I&#39;m curious how you two met. I just starting dating and it&#39;s been rough. They want a girl with a dong and I&#39;m not going to be that in the future. I feel like I can&#39;t date until I get bottom surgery and it seems so far away.

Tinder! We were both dating a few people pretty casually at the time, just hooking up, really. We were initially going to end our relationship as she approached bottom surgery because we wouldnâ€™t be able to have sex for a while, and that was kinda the original basis of our relationship (well, kinda - our first date lasted like 12 hours and we just got along really well lol). I probably canâ€™t offer any specific advice about dating guys who are specifically seeking trans women, cuz sheâ€™s the only trans woman Iâ€™ve ever been with, but I imagine itâ€™s very difficult to have people attracted to a body part you feel so conflicted over. In our case, I wasnâ€™t attracted to her because of her penis, and Iâ€™m not going to stop being attracted to her because she has a vagina; it sounds like such a cliche, but there are def people out here who will be interested in you, not just your genitals. Iâ€™m sorry, though, that sounds very difficult and I canâ€™t imagine what thatâ€™s like - wish I had better advice to give.

I wrote a story here about how my recovery went. People kept saying it was intense and crazily painful. None of this was the case. I put the pain at a 2-3/10. She won&#39;t be allowed to walk or do many choires so she&#39;ll likely be bed bound for at least 3 weeks. You&#39;ll have to help her in any way you can. Making breakfast, dinner, coffee and what not. The mental challenge is the biggest. If she can get around that, there&#39;s nothing to worry about yet. I am almost 3 weeks post op with Dr. Kanhai in the Netherlands

One thing I will add that I havenâ€™t seen mentioned is that itâ€™s going to take a long time before sheâ€™s ready to have sex again. I tried to have penetrative sex at 4ish months post op and i was not ready for it. So prepare to not have anal or vaginal sex for a while. Like probably 6-8 months if yâ€™all are really trying to be safe

I am so happy for yiu. I just got my bottom surgery three weeks ago, and hoped it would  be the most affirming time for me ever, because  the  transmasc man who had pledged to take care of me was the love of my life.
</p>
<p>
Well, like the name of the book a few years ago. &#34;And God Said Ha!&#34; that want&#39;s. meant to be be . MY loving caregiver had some sort of existential personal crisis two days after I was discharged, and walked out on me.
</p>
<p>
In pain. Weak, dizzy, and terrified.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Maybe your ex wife can check in on you once in awhile,&#34; as he walked out the doos.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Love you.&#34; he added.
</p>
<p>
SO. Don&#39;t do that.
</p>
<p>
DO be with her as much as you can. She just lost a piece of her that regardless of whether she liked it or n to, or even hated it, maybe, she still relied on her penis ro give her cute for urinating and sexual pleasure,
</p>
<p>
She has some retraining to do. Not much, but some.
</p>
<p>
I wish I had known how much pain the backs of my thighs were going to give me. Even when she&#39;s in the hospital, elevate her new vagina as much as she can. Build a tower of pillows in front of her she she can keep her entire backside OFF of the bed surface--and make sure she keeps her legs spread. Obviously, you&#39;ll have to build similar  pillow structure for he back if she wants to sit up.
</p>
<p>
Yes, It sounds like she&#39;ll be squeeze inside a soft pillow V structure, and she will be incredibly comfortable. The back of her vagina is really tender right now, and the less surface contact she has, the better. I still still sit and sleep this way and I love it.
</p>
<p>
Youb are going to have tom help her dilate, So pay attention to the instructions she gets from the nursing staff. You can&#39;t do it for her, but yiu can be there for her to talk too her, hold her, and  keep her calm. It  will not be fun, but it is also the most intimate thing you do do for her right now. You&#39;ll be helping her do stuff most men cannot imagine, and their relationships with women (cis/trans) have suffered for it--a LOT.
</p>
<p>
The time you spend with her will be the most important of your lives, Because this is where all of the years off hurt and betrayals, and sadness and heartaches she&#39;s had to suffer over the years are literally going to be put on a crucible for the next few weeks.
</p>
<p>
I hope you are  the rarest of rare cis males who has found the treasure of your life in this fragile young woman who needs you so badly right now.
</p>
<p>
Be the next few weeks can be fun too: she&#39;s going to feel better and you guys can get out and about in a couple of weeks. Just carefully.
</p>
<p>
Feed her well. Lots of fluids. Lots of chocolate.
</p>
<p>
Lots and lots of love.
</p>
<p>
I am so envious, I so wanted my recovery time to be spent with someone I totally loved and trusted. But --not to be.
</p>
<p>
Another male who abandoned me.
</p>
<p>
Oh. Did I mention  I also got covid three days after I was discharged from  the hospital and then pneumonia? NO? And that I&#39;m just getting out now isolation?
</p>
<p>
Well, I did.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been the funnest trip to hell I can imagine.
</p>
<p>
But YOU guys can have a wonderful, healing, bonding, and incredibly loving experience.
</p>
<p>
I wish you you so much luck and so many bLessings!!!!

Holistic doctor here: Yes on the icing and vitamins...especially Vit C and Zinc (for speeding the healing). Lots of hugs and other forms of psych. support (like shoulder and back rubs)...and frequent reminding her of how wonderful she is. And, regular chiropractic spinal work, which will help after most ANY medical procedure. There is likely some spasm or other problem in her lower back, post surgery: CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT!!!

If I were her D.C., I&#39;d want her in the office at LEAST biweekly!!!

And viewing of old movies together is HIGHLY recommended!!!
