Hey everyone! Just wanted to give a quick update on my GRS recovery in Montreal. Overall, things are going well, but the pain is still pretty intense. I&#39;m trying to avoid narcotics due to some side effects, so I&#39;ve been relying on Gabapentin, Tylenol, and Advil. Any suggestions for non-narcotic pain relief without weight gain?
</p>
<p>

Had a rough moment with pain, and the nurses weren&#39;t sure what to do since my Suboxone might block traditional pain meds. Ended up with Dilaudid, which worked but brought on a week of terrible constipation. Any other suggestions for pain relief without this issue?
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Shoutout to Dr. Brassard and the team, they&#39;re amazing, but the med protocol was a bit old-school for me. Anyone else have a similar experience?
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Quick question: They recommended mild Dove soap in the sitz bath â€“ what about Epsom salt? Can it be used in douches since they said any salt works? Wondering if something stronger like Dettol soap might be better?
</p>
<p>
â€‹
</p>
<p>
Also, let&#39;s talk about the grossest part â€“ the gauze blocking my urethra. Seriously looked like I&#39;d expelled an alien when it came out. Any similar experiences or tips?
</p>
<p>
The only thing I am a bit upset is how I had to suffer so much before pain relief. I was told I was not the first patient who came on suboxone. The fix was just to give me diludid hydromorphone. But no one did anything about it cause they had no orders? I understand that so many patients coming in and out it is hard. yes I would do it over again and no I do not trust any other team with my recovery in the world other than maybe banks in Thailand. They gave me a handful of diludid to take home and its useless to me now the first week and day when iw as crying with pain is when I could use them. SO those of you on suboxone be very careful and make sure you get tell them the protocol you would like as soon as you feel pain. Your need to ask for hydromorphone asap. Try one oxy and then move up. Do not let what happened to me happen to u. They gave me one tramadol wait two hours of extreme pain the one oxy wait a few hours of extreme pain and crying. Hours and hours would go by and no pain. They take all your meds make adjustments. So you got to work out the med situation before you go in for sure you.  Meet with the surgeon at least and get down a pattern to save pain. SOme girls FELT NO PAIN and were up running around In a few days. I still feel pain. It was like nothing to some girls. I am shocked at how high their pain tolerance is. Honestly tho the way health care is i do not believe any other place would have put in a protocol for my pain relief. YEah id go through it again but i would have had it all down in writing before. I just jumped at the chance i mean its all free right and i got a opening a few months. I will clean this up and put this up on a blog site so no other girl has to have a painful break down. I LOVE the staff i love the girls the surgeon is an aratest and everything is done so fast so clean. They keep us like 10 days in their recovery house. BUt i got to blog about the pain was terrifying and my leg is numb might be a part of this i hope.
</p>

Missing the recovery home, the nurses, and my awesome roomie. Glad to be home but navigating the post-op journey. Share your thoughts and advice! ðŸŒˆâœ¨

Best advice I can give is to take the narcotics if you need them. If the pain is intense then your recovery will be slower. I had to take them twice during the first week at home (and the side effects sucked). But remember to take some Senna (or similar) to combat the constipation.
</p>
<p>
You need saline solution for the douche, so any NaCl salt (table, rock, sea, etc.). Epsom salt is a different substance (&#34;salt&#34; is chemistry terminology, you can&#39;t replace one salt substance with another).
</p>
<p>
Mild soap is important while you are healing. It is to help some of the gunk soak/wash off. I used Aveeno (for sensitive skin) rather than dove. Dettol soap is going to be way too harsh.
</p>
<p>
Grossest part was the first pee after the catheter came out. It was a mixture of all kinds of things that went everywhere except where it needed to go.

I had some extra bleeding so the gauze packed around my clitoral hood was very densely clotted and took a while to come off. Do not touch, do not pull it, just do the baths and showers, and if you have extra supplies when home then pour saline water above your vagina and let it run down over the gauze. It needs to slowly rinse through the clotted blood and it will come off on its own.

Black skirt is my recommendation. Also take some of the undies they have as they often rub less.
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s too cold to wear a skirt, loose fitting jammie pants are 2nd bet IMO. Nothing tight. I&#39;m 7 weeks out and can just now wear pants.
