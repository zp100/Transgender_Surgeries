I am 5 weeks post op PI GCS with Dr Gupta at UH Hospitals Cleveland. I want to share my experience with everyone here.
</p>
<p>
I chose him based off of a recommendation of a friend who went to him and I wanted to stay near home for surgery. The deciding factor for me was the confidence of Dr. Gupta and his team they put together. The entire process leading up to surgery made things extremely simple and stress free for me.
</p>
<p>
I woke up a few hours after surgery in my room. I was pretty doped up so I didnâ€™t feel too much pain downstairs. The only pain I felt was in my feet from the stirrups. The first 5 days I didnâ€™t move very much. On day six they pulled out the catheter and took the wound vac off and I immediately felt better. The hospital staff took pretty good care of me. Everyone was friendly, the food was good, and the view wasnâ€™t half bad. I left on day seven after being taught how to dilate and clean.
</p>
<p>
I have had a few minor complications during my recovery. I scoured Reddit and Facebook groups for information to put my mind at ease. I tried to compare others notes to make sense of how it applies to my issues and that got me through things. The first issue was I had a thin red wound just below my butt. It was from the catheter hose getting stuck to my leg and ripping the skin off. It was really painful. On day 10 I was walking when I felt a stitch pop for the first time in my perineum. That really fucking hurt. There was more blood than the normal amount but it didnâ€™t fill a pad up. On day 14 there was another stitch that popped near the bottom of the V. I found out that a lot of taller girls pop stitches more frequently than the short bitches do and Iâ€™m 7â€™ so apparently that was normal. Oh the smell needs to be addressed. It smelled like that water that leaks out behind a garbage truck for a good three weeks after surgery. It was awful it could clear a room out. I thought it could be infected and went in to have it checked out. It wasnâ€™t infected but there were some skin sloughing areas that would eventually fall off. On day 19 I had this dark purple string looking looking thing fall out in a pad and in the canal. I had no idea what it was. It didnâ€™t hurt at all but was alarming to see. I didnâ€™t pull on it I just trimmed it and left it alone. I kept getting pieces of this for the next week after douching or dilating or in the morning. After the last piece fell out the smell went away. On Day 21 I had more bleeding than normal and it was from pushing myself more than usual the previous day. I just rested more and that went away. I found that icing on and off in the evening had a real positive effect for how I felt the next day. The last little issue I have had were from some stitches that had popped near the bottom of the canal. They rubbed the skin raw which caused a lot of irritation when I was moving a round. That was 10 days ago and now I feel pretty good with everything.
</p>
<p>
Physically I feel like Iâ€™m at 40-50% of what I was before. I drove after two weeks for 30 minutes and I felt like a truck hit me. After a month I can drive up to an hour without issues. I canâ€™t sit at 90 degree angle but a donut pillow really helps. For sleeping Iâ€™ve had to sleep mostly on my back. Sometimes I can put a few pillows between my legs and roll over for a bit but itâ€™s only a temporary solution. There is still some pink discharge and some occasional bleeding  Most  of the blood is after dilating. Dilation isnâ€™t awful. In truth Iâ€™m off work currently and it sort of adds structure to my day which I appreciate.  Iâ€™ve been gradually pushing myself with walking and bending over and doing isolated exercises so I donâ€™t continue to lose strength. One positive from this recovery is that I have lost a lot of muscle mass in my shoulders. Hopefully when I hit the gym again I wonâ€™t be as bulky as I used to be. And probably the best thing physically so far has been no tucking. That alone makes this shit worth it!
</p>
<p>
Mentally Iâ€™m bored. A couple years ago I replaced all of my bad habits with healthy choices; my smoking with walking, my stress with time in the gym and out in nature, and my feeling of boredom with traveling but being home with nothing to do has had a negative effect on me. Itâ€™s really easy to get used to being lazy even when Iâ€™m bored. Iâ€™m lacking the motivation to get my shit together again. Iâ€™ve talked to my therapist about this and itâ€™s good to keep up with sessions during and after this process.

Iâ€™m not very good at Reddit-ing so Iâ€™ll post pics separately.

surgery seriously wrecks ur mental health. i had major surgery for my crohnâ€™s in my freshman year and recovering was hell on my mind (still is tbh)
</p>
<p>
i can only imagine how difficult something even more intimate and complex than that is for your overall feeling of health. solidarity ðŸ’•ðŸ’•

The whole Gupta family works at Cleveland and i donâ€™t see one who does this surgery. Most of them are in cardiology.

Thank you for sharing. This is the first I&#39;ve heard of the food being good, maybe the cafeteria changed after you were discharged. I&#39;m sorry about the boredom, this will pass. Congratulations!
