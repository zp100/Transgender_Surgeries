It&#39;s not totally clear in your pictures the changes due to hair style.
</p>
<p>
Did he do a hairline incision or an incision in the back of the skull? If the latter then that does result in a raised hairline and that&#39;s your issue yes ? What you mean by a longer face?
</p>
<p>
If so you could have a forehead advancement by making a hairline incision or have hair grafts placed in the front of your hairline to make a new hairline.

hairline incision.  by a longer face, I mean that I have a large chin and my features now take up more of the face that previously I would wear big fluffy bangs in front of.  My forehead&#39;s already pretty short right now, so I don&#39;t think that would help and would probably just look really weird.  I certainly don&#39;t want to push it backwards.

So you could have the chin implant removed and via a genioplasty have your chin advanced forward and otherwise shaped. An issue with chin implants is they can only increase chin size

That chin implant is too big. I would look at getting that excised and I think you would get a lot of bang for your buck in that one stroke.

But then I&#39;ll just have a tall face *and* a weak chin, right?
</p>
<p>
I know some people have issues parsing their new face when they get a lot of work done at once.  Everyone I know who I&#39;ve sent pictures to says I look great.  Is it really fine except for the implant, because I hate how tall it is, but maybe it looks femme to other people?

Just think it would even you out a bit.  I have a very small chin implant and it did not add mass as much as push the chin forward a bit.  It seems to me that would be the second easiest route.  But I think it is the implant throwing your facial dynamics off.

that&#39;s what this one was supposed to do.  Maybe it&#39;s because it&#39;s crooked or maybe he just went too big, but I did ask him to keep it level with my forehead and cheekbones.

Are you not happy with the chin implant or were your goals to have a shorter face?

the implant isn&#39;t so bad except insofar as it makes the new tall face even taller.  I think it would&#39;ve looked really good with a short face.  It is slightly crooked, but I did accidentally hit myself in the chin while trying to pop my neck, that&#39;s on me and it&#39;s not noticeable.
