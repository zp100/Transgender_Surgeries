Bilateral Orchiectomy:
<br>
ON: -7days from posting
<br>
AT: Logan Health, Kalispell, MT
<br>
BY: Sarabeth Martin, Logan Health Urology
<br>
General Anesthesia
</p>
<p>
I had no problems whatsoever, Dr Martin was respectful and easy to get along with.
</p>
<p>
At initial consult expect to state and confirm in a couple different ways that you do want your testicles removed, and do know that it is permanent. She also asked about sperm banking, I sure as fuck was not stopping hormones for that, lol.
</p>
<p>
On surgery day, Everyone at the surgery place was great, no problems. You will though have to state again multiple times, who you are, and that you are there for an orchiectomy.
<br>
You also have to sign some papers saying that you are asking for an orchiectomy and anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
You have to have someone to take you to the surgery center, and pick you up after.
</p>
<p>
Discomfort after surgery is minimal, I am off work, I scheduled 3wks off for surgery. as of now 1wk past its not bad. I did go to my heels pole class yesterday, and that upset it a little bit. So its probably a good thing I&#39;m not at work all day.
</p>
<p>
The day after surgery there was minor bruising on the left side, it went away as quick as it showed up.
<br>
For the first few days it was like, why is my scrotum so big, it was alot smaller with the testicles still in it, lol. Not even swollen though, just oddly stretched out. but its been pulling back up more every day. I think it&#39;ll be fine pretty soon.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, the worst of it is that they shave your pubic hair, so ofcourse it itches a couple days later. I hate itchies.

Your walking before you leave the hospital.
<br>
As soon as your back in your room after surgery, You&#39;ll be like, get the rest of this shit off me so I can move.
<br>
Once back home the rest of the day was dancing around listening to music.
</p>
<p>
I very much do not have a desk job, and am glad I took time off.
<br>
If I did have a low-intensity desk job, no running/lifting/kneeling/fighting asshole customers, Then yes.
<br>
You could easily do surgery on Friday, and be back on Monday, If everything goes good.
<br>
That&#39;s a big if though, I would atleast take a week even with a desk job. Just incase your scrotum turns into a swollen bloody mess.
</p>
<p>
The cost?, I&#39;m actually not certain yet.
<br>
I do have insurance $3k deductible (1.5 already met) and $6k OOPM.
<br>
My insurance has an explicit policy document for &#34;Gender Reassignment Surgery for Gender Dysphoria&#34; and it requires a whole buncha bullshit, that I didn&#39;t do.
<br>
They have also &#34;revised&#34; the document 3 times this year alone.
</p>
<p>
Now, I got the impression that nobody here past my endo has any experience with trans bullshit.
<br>
So when urology was like, yes we can do that, lets put you on the schedule. I probably should have spoken up and been like, hey have you ever dealt with this bullshit before, cause the insurance company as far as I know wants very specific letters from you, and endo, and two psycs, and records from pcp, and sacrifice a goat.
<br>
Umm, but I didn&#39;t.
<br>
Soo, on surgery day, I was presented with an estimate on checkin.
<br>
Supposedly based on my insurance, which they do have on record.
<br>
it shows an estimated out of pocket cost after insurance of $5800.
</p>
<p>
The estimate shows initial charges before insurance of $22k for the hospital, and $1800 for the surgeon.
<br>
They had me pay $100 deposit day of, and I have $6k set aside.
</p>
<p>
So, if insurance doesn&#39;t pay, then I will pay the DR, and anesthesia, The hospital depends on how stupid they want to be.
<br>
That $22k is not a real number, they bill stupid shit like that, then insurance goes oh our per-negotiated discounts make it $4k or whatever the fuck it is.
</p>
<p>
Even if insurance declines, if they give me a reasonable bill I&#39;ll just pay it.
<br>
No claims have come through yet, still watching.

I&#39;m beginning to think that maybe I made a mistake booking an Orchiectomy instead of going straight through for a PPT Vaginoplasty.. I know I&#39;ll need the additional tissue in the future should I go through with PPT-Vaginoplasty, or a scrotectomy should I choose not to.. but goddd, I was really hoping that removing those trouble makers would make the rest smaller/just skin.. I guess only a week out you&#39;ll have alot of swelling tho..?

There&#39;s always swelling after a surgery so I wouldn&#39;t take op&#39;s picture as representative of the final result of a standalone orchi.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask why you&#39;re going for a separate orchi instead of getting it all done at once? Is it because the waiting times are shorter for orchis or?

Yeah, alot of my dysphoria extends from that portion..also shorter wait times, shorter recovery and seems like a more realistic first step for me!

After surgery my scrotum was somehow alot larger, even though it didn&#39;t really seem swollen. its shrinking more every day though.
<br>
Before surgery I was often smaller than whats pictured here, and my balls would pull up inside alot of the time. But as I said, its shrinking back more every day. I think it&#39;ll be fine.
<br>
But that&#39;s for me, I currently have no plans for Vaginoplasty.
<br>
I considered it for some time, but ultimately decided that wasn&#39;t worth it.

Most pictures I&#39;ve seen (after swelling goes down) of the results of removing the twins have the desired effect basically across the board. If you&#39;re wearing panties (and if you&#39;re more of a grower than a shower this helps) it&#39;s much easier to pass...and also seems you don&#39;t have to worry about things popping out nearly so much.

You look wonderful. I had my orchiectomy surgery thirty years ago and have never regretted it.

Scabs can be dark colors, especially purple and dark red. That, combined with the black sutures, can make it look like the skin around the incision has changed color.
</p>
<p>
What impressed the hell out of me is the lack of bruising! At 7 days out, my scrotum was still looking like it had pissed off Evander Holyfield.

There was some minor seeping of blood at that part on the first day, it scabbed, which is what you see. it&#39;ll come off eventually.
