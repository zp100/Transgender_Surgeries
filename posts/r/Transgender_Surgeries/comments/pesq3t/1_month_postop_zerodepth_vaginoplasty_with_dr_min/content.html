I have two questions, as someone who is considering zero depth.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Is there a difference between this and vulvaplasty?  I keep hearing of the two but I&#39;m not sure what the difference is.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I know that it is called zero depth, but some people have said they have a minimal amount of depth with it.  From the pics it looks like you have a little depth.  Mind of I ask how much it is?  Thanks for answering my words questions.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

Hi! Thanks for the question!
</p>
<ol>
<li>
There isn&#39;t any difference, really. Just two terms with the same meaning, more or less.
</li>
<li>
I have a little bit! My surgeon called it a &#34;dimple.&#34; I think its about a half-inch but I haven&#39;t played with that part much yet.

Sorry, I dont know the scientific words but one only make the look and the other add a bit more(for penetration sex) Its been a long time since I looked into them so I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have the full break down

It&#39;s looking really great! Wishing you a smooth, easy recovery. I elected to go with zero-depth myself, and am looking forward to my operation in a few months.

Congrats,  looks amazing,  especially considering you&#39;re only a month out. I&#39;m having minimal depth in 2 weeks,  any suggestions for healing post op or any advice would be super helpful.  Good luck with your recovery

Get some comfy pants that you can wear out and about! And some comfy dresses too. I didn&#39;t bring nearly enough comfortable clothes that i would feel fine going to the store in. I ended up wearing the same leggings like every day.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to dm me if you have any other questions!

I feel like zero depth is a better option for me at my age (61). Are you all who have chosen/may chose that option happy with it? There is still feeling down there, right? Just no penetration ability?

I had a similar procedure, but it is more limited depth. I have about 3 inches. I have great sensation and everything looks fantastic.

Thank you for sharing! That sounds like kind of what I&#39;d want, to be honest. I just want to make sure there is sensation down there. I&#39;ve been pretty much asexual for a long time so penetration isn&#39;t something I&#39;m craving anyway. I appreciate your input and I am starting to think this is the way to go.

Thank you! I will! I have SO many questions, particularly about recovery time....but knowing that you can still maintain sensation is very good to know as well. Most important!

Can I ask who you saw to get 3 inches of depth? I’m considering min-depth because I don’t want to deal with dilation but I’ve heard a lot of varying responses as to
<em>
how
</em>
deep the zero/min depth variation actually is.

My surgeon is Dr. Gurjala with Align Surgical Associates in SF. I wanted as much stuff as I could get without a scrotal graft.

I too am over 60, and seriously considering a Vulvaplasty. I have pretty much been asexual all my life,.Faster healing, and minimizing the chance of complications are big pluses.I want my clothes to fit right, and not have to avert my eyes from the mirror as I get out of the shower.  Congratulations OP, this is a very nice result.

Thanks for sharing. I am likewise pretty much asexual going on 20 years, since my divorce. I would love to experience something orgasmic as a woman but...I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s possible even without penetration. Anyone with experience in that can please weigh in....thanks!

Not to say too much, but you can

definitely

experience orgasm with a zero-depth vagina. I had my first orgasm a few days before my 1-month post op anniversary!

Wow! Thank you for sharing! This is all so not about, you know,

that

. Still, my whole life, I&#39;ve wanted to know what that feels like and it&#39;s so good to know that it can happen and happen that soon after surgery. I really appreciate your sharing and giving me hope!

And what a great feeling I bet that is! I feel like I&#39;m the same...that full-depth is not worth the pain and recovery based on what I want at the end of the process.

A few reasons!
</p>
<ol>
<li>
no hair removal. I had started doing some and it sucked. i really didnt want to go through any more.
</li>
<li>
I don&#39;t really have any interest in being penetrated
</li>
<li>
I knew i wouldnt be able to keep up with a dilating schedule
</li>
<li>
Theres a shorter healing time

She looks really amazing! And only one month of recovery...so I am looking forward to my own zero depth wonder.  Awesome that you enjoyed already your first orgasm. How does it feel? I can&#39;t wait ...
</p>
<p>
Thanx for charing.

There is a lot of terminology confusion.  It also depends on how the specific surgeon describes it.  There is a zero depth and there is a minimal depth that does not require dilation to maintain. I had what my surgeon called a modified vaginoplasty with minimal depth in December of 2018.  There is also an internet myth that these procedures result in an easy recovery.  I believe there are no &#34;easy recoveries&#34; in GCS.  I had a difficult recovery and required a revision that was repeatedly delayed because of covid-19.  I finally had it in March 2021.  So I have a small depth of about 1-2 cm.  This procedure does eliminate the risk of one of the more serious complications in full depth, a fistula.  Also, I do not need to dilate.  However, after my revision I went to a psychical therapist who is an expert with female pelvic flor problems.  I was still having some discomfort issues.  She recommend that I use a vibrator in my small opening to help relax the muscles and relieve tension!

Why go with zero depth? Is it a healing thing or just personal preference?

Zero depth is less inclined towards post surgical problems and allows more material for cosmetic aesthetics

Plus you don’t have to dilate. That’s the main reason I’m choosing it.

Nope. I’m pretty much asexual, and if I did decide to have sex it would be with another woman. Valid question though.

It was honestly pretty rough at the beginning. I had trouble sleeping  bc im usually a side sleeper and I had to be on my back. Also I had somehow convinced myself that it wouldn&#39;t hurt very much, and the it did (obvs—its genital surgery) so I felt kinda blindsided by that. Once first 3 weeks passed, though, it got a LOT easier.
</p>
<p>
As for hair removal, you technically don&#39;t need to get any (or at least my surgeon didn&#39;t require it) but i originally was going to get a full-depth so I did have some done initially.

Thanks for your response! I’m heavily considering min-depth as well and from reading about it and hearing doctors talk about it I feel like it’s definitely made out to be something that doesn’t hurt very much, so I’m very grateful to hear your side of things. Do you feel like they gave you enough pain killers or is Dr. Min Jun hesitant to prescribe them?

Nah, i definitely had enough. They gave me percosets for a while, and i ended up usually taking them just to sleep and not during the day. Extra-strength tylenol and advil did the rest.

Honestly, I worried a lot that i

none

. So happy to have gotten the surgery, and so happy to have gotten zero-depth. It feels perfect and totally

me.

This is exactly the kind of procedure I want☺. I do have a few questions. For reference, I&#39;m 31 and I&#39;ve been on HRT since late April of this year.
</p>
<p>
1: Did your surgeon require that you be living in your preferred gender roll for a set amount of time before doing the procedure? I&#39;m out to some people, and generally speaking, stealth to most. My environment is not very safe for transgendered people, and I could lose my job/ ability to afford surgery if I came out to everyone.
</p>
<p>
3: I don&#39;t have hardly any head-hair.. male pattern thinning and all and I&#39;ve never really made &#34;passing&#34; a big deal for me; could a surgeon conclude that I&#39;m not &#34;transitioned enough&#34;  and refuse to operate on me until I &#34;look the part?&#34; It May just be an irrational fear; I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a long time. I&#39;m not even that feminine.. and I&#39;m normally not myself around people I&#39;ve just met. 😔
</p>
<p>
2: Did your surgeon give you choices when it came to your desired aesthetics .. allowing you to pick...🤔 how your vagina would look?
</p>
<p>
4: Lastly,  now that you don&#39;t have to worry about a bulge or tucking, what&#39;s it like to finally be able to wear clothes like panties, swimsuits, leggings, and dresses like any other girl? I&#39;m sooo looking forward to this. 😆

I had to get a couple letters from therapists saying that I was &#34;socially transitioned&#34; and also &#34;sound of mind.&#34; The process was quite gatekeepy but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have trouble if you explain yourself.
</li>
<li>
I had pretty short hair at the time of surgery, and now I have a buzzcut. My surgeon didn&#39;t care but the therapists writing my letters needed me to explain it to them. They got it, but I was nervous that they wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;ve heard that some trans women need to really &#34;dress up&#34; and &#34;play the part&#34; in therapy to get their letters (e.g. wearing a dress, maybe a wig, even if its not something they would normally do). This sucks but it seems to work.
</li>
<li>
I did get a choice! The general design that my surgeon does was exactly what I wanted, so I didn&#39;t need to tell him to do anything different, but he was definitely open to it.
</li>
<li>
It feels great! I can wear leggings out now, which is amazing. I feel like I could actually go to the gym and work out without any dysphoria which was hugely holding me back from getting fit. I can&#39;t swim yet (I have to wait until month #3) but I tried on my swimsuit and I look wonderful!
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Please let me know if you have any more questions! U can comment or DM me, I&#39;m happy to help!

Thank you. Your post has answered a lot of my questions. It&#39;s going to be a while before I consider (or are eligible for) GRS, but at my age, zero-depth seems like a much more sensible option.
