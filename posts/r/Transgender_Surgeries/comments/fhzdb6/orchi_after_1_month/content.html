1 month ago today (Feb 13), I had orchiectomy/scrotectomy with Dr. Hope Sherie at Cosmetic Concierge in Charlotte, NC. As you can see, as fantastic result. Has healed up nicely ...  Feel free to ask questions!

Youre going to love how it feels not to have those &#34;stones&#34; between your legs. It also makes &#34;exploring&#34; down there much easier ;)  FWIW, I kept all of my skin for SRS in a yr or so; Two down, one to go.  Good luck :)

Probably not. But as you can see, I have enough for zero-depth which would be my choice. I dont need a vagina, but a vulva would be alright.

I just postponed mine.  My former significant other said I would have to self-quarantine from our children for 21 days if I chose to go out and expose myself to potential covid getting an elective surgery............I just hope now this virus doesn&#39;t delay things for me for 6 months!

Your health (and theirs) is the most important thing, so given that circumstance, it seems prudent. I&#39;ll give a full report to give you an even better idea of what to expect.

Kaylee, you’re going to love it whenever you get in there. Don’t rush. For data, I took one painkiller the evening of the surgery. My groin ached (like a really mild knee to the testicles). I really only took it because I’ve never had one and wanted to see if it worked. It did. That was the only pain I’ve had. I was planning on staying a week until my post-op check up, but ended up flying home on day 3 with zero concern or pain. I spotted a little on my pad (they give you a few and a set of compression undies). I’ve been home since tele-working with the ability to keep everything out in the air where it heals best. Showers are no issue. I had a little asymmetrical bruising, but it’s all clear now. In short, easy. I hope the world return to normal and you get rescheduled soon. Cheers!

How is the healing going Janelle Diane? I’m still on for Apr 2nd, fingers crossed. The governor of North Carolina is closing non-essential businesses down tomorrow, but from what I can tell, all of the things I will need are on the critical infrastructure list that stays open. Sending fast healing wishes to you.

I just had mine done. Totally amazing! I agree completely about the office staff. Totally friendly and professional. Showed at 8 and was done by 10. Wonderful. Not a single bit of anesthesia fog or pain down there. Doc Sherie and her team are amazing. It’s a great day.

After 24 hours, all is well. It was totally awesome, and I agree with your post-op experience. Some abdominal aching, but nothing else. There appeared to be some still-fresh blood last night, but today it’s totally clean.
</p>
<p>
The area is still swollen, but honestly, it’s hard to tell.

Were you awake for the operation? How much pain were you in after (1-10)? How long did the pain last? What positives have you noticed since the op? Any negatives?

No I was out for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I was in no pain after, and then about 2-3 hours after it was a dull ache, which was easily taken care of by alternating tylenol and motrin. I never took any of the narcotic pain relievers i was prescribed.
</p>
<p>
Im still healing, so kinda too early to tell about positives/negatives. I mean its only been six weeks! :)

The surgery center would not let me leave by myself.   I had a caretaker with me who drove me back to the hotel and stayed with me until after i ate lunch.
</p>
<p>
The next day I was able to take my plane flight home with no issues including walking the distances in the airport.
</p>
<p>
Edit: The deleted question asked if was allowed to leave by myself and ride public transportation, and how much pain I had walking.

Not OP, but somebody who&#39;s had 13 different surgeries in life (none trans-related yet, alas!). Some people can tolerate anesthesia very well and aren&#39;t
<em>
too
</em>
affected by it in the immediate aftermath of surgery, but most people are pretty impaired. That goes beyond just reaction speed and driving ability, too - confusion, nausea, and memory loss are all very very common side effects of anesthesia, and that&#39;s not even to count the side effects of whatever pain medication you might be on and the pain itself.
</p>
<p>
You should not be getting yourself home immediately after anesthesia whether by driving or public transit, and you really need to have someone to drive you or otherwise escort you home. In the US, at least, most reputable healthcare providers won&#39;t even perform elective outpatient surgery if you don&#39;t have someone to take you home afterwards, and may hold you in the hospital if possible if nobody&#39;s able to take you home. The chances that something could go wrong are far too high to not line up a ride.
</p>
<p>
I handle anesthesia extremely well and am really used to its effects at this point, and even I wouldn&#39;t dream of doing that. Something going wrong because of the post-anesthesia confusion is just too big a possibility, even if that&#39;s all you experience.
