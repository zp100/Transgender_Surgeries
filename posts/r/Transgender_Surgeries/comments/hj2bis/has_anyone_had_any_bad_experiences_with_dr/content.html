There are a few critical reviews on RealSelf.com and on Google (i think?) but I think it&#39;s mostly quibbles about him not doing EXACTLY what they asked for rather than being botched. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard of him botching anyone other than a patient on whom he attempted to perform a facial masculinization surgery. I think if I was FtM I&#39;d be wary of him for that reason. But in my situation, he&#39;d be my preferred surgeon if I could afford him.
</p>
<p>
When I went for my consultation he openly told me that he has a few patients that are fairly unsatisfied and showed me pictures. They all looked very feminine to me, but I could see being upset if my surgeon made a decision that altered my appearance in a way that I wasn&#39;t expecting. I think it amounted to aesthetic differences of opinion. He didn&#39;t talk negatively about them or dismiss their opinions but seemed to have a &#34;what else can I do?&#34;
<em>
shrug
</em>
attitude about it. Of course, that&#39;s just reality. Not everyone is going to be over the moon about their results. Obviously, I don&#39;t know these people and I don&#39;t know what their expectations were, but to me they looked amazing. He also commented that some of his most beautiful patients (in his opinion) aren&#39;t happy. But it doesn&#39;t happen often. He&#39;s also done free revisions for people for whom he feels the results didn&#39;t live up to his standards. (as any surgeon worth a damn should!)
</p>
<p>
I commented on another post this week about his office staff though. They&#39;re extremely unhelpful and if you don&#39;t have the cash for a 7500$ deposit they won&#39;t even bother to attempt pre-authorization with your insurance carrier. If you&#39;re MtF, and you have cash on hand though, and don&#39;t need too much assistance with the process, I don&#39;t think you can do any better.

He&#39;s expensive. Not the most expensive but near the top.  There is no &#34;usual.&#34; Your quote will depend on what you need done. For my full FFS revision + anesthesia and hospital fees, I was quoted about 40k.
</p>
<p>
Also, your consultation will cost $600 if you don&#39;t already have recent x-rays. It will be half-price if you do.

I haven&#39;t heard anything about that. So I can&#39;t comment.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I will say that Dr. Ousterhout, (whom DB inherited the practice from, and who pioneered many of the current techniques) speaks glowingly about Dr. DB. Other FFS surgeons also hold him in high regard. (I&#39;ve talked to Rolfes, Rodman,  Facque, Mayer, Rossi, and Facial Team and they all had nothing but high praise for his work. I&#39;m talking to Satterwhite and DiMaggio before I make up my mind) But like I said, no surgeon can get it exactly right 100% of the time. If you look and research long enough you can find critical and negative reviews of every single FFS surgeon who is currently practicing.
</p>
<p>
What you really need to look for is the results that  people get with similar faces to yours. Most FFS surgeons have a more difficult time with people of color for example. You have to pay attention and make the right call based on who you think gives YOU the best chance and whose vision aligns the most closely with your own. That may not be Dr. DB. I think his results for people with North African backgrounds like mine, are really excellent. So he&#39;s my first choice right now. But I may go somewhere else because I hate the staff and it&#39;s such a pain. Not to mention the price tag. I&#39;m still making up my mind

I don&#39;t know about DB but I do know for a fact there are other doctors that engage in this practice. A lack of negative reviews means nothing in this field.

Honestly, 40k isn&#39;t bad for full FFS.
</p>
<p>
$600 for a consult is insane, though.

Yeah. I thought so too. Every other consultation I&#39;ve had has been free.  Just to be clear it&#39;s 300 for him. And 300 for x-rays. He partners with a dental office in his building and you have to pay them separately.
</p>
<p>
Well. Actually the Kaiser one was 20$. Co-pay.  I think Lee and Keojampa charge fees in the 200-300 range too

I was under the impression that Lee was a tier below in pricing but I’m thinking you’re right. Or maybe I was overinflating Dr. D-B’s pricing.

I had the same experience with Dr. D.
</p>
<p>
He seriously fucked up my chin and jawline, two things that I was adamant about through the entire process that I wanted good results on.  I ended up with saggy jowls and a jawline that didn&#39;t match my chin position (which was also set out too far and not down far enough).  He also assured me many times that he&#39;d do the face/neck lift I was also asking for (but he wouldn&#39;t do until after 6 months) if I thought it was necessary.  He agreed it&#39;d improve my appearance, but told me I&#39;d have to pay for the face/neck lift instead of the cost being waived.
</p>
<p>
When I pressed him on my jawline and chin position he suggested that moving my chin down so that it was in line with the angle of my jaw (and this would&#39;ve only been a few millimeters) would&#39;ve made my result more masculine.  He dismissed my concerns about the entire thing and then, like you, begrudgingly offered to redo the jaw and chin.  And like you, I was dismayed that someone who seemed so likeable could turn into a gaslighting asshole in the moment of my despair when I needed some good news and up until then I had felt good about it all.
</p>
<p>
He also charged my insurance for a procedure that he never performed on me that I indicated I wanted.  I&#39;m still looking at options for suing him for fraud and malpractice.
</p>
<p>
And again, like you, I&#39;m going local to finish up the things that he was negligent on.  Luckily the surgeon I&#39;m going to happily accepts insurance instead of just standing there and acting like it&#39;s the worst thing ever.

Hi, I&#39;m the FtM that he deformed and left in a coma and then threatened to sue me/my family when I asked for my medical records and for posting about him. He&#39;s also SUPER overpriced. Currently I&#39;m still battling severe suicidal thoughts since I&#39;m in so much pain. You deserve to go somewhere better :(
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s done other things as well, not just to me. He laughed about how he and his colleague caused brain damage on another patient, he has used bigoted words to describe trans women. This guy is shite.

Yeah, he&#39;s fucking disgusting. I wish I had taped my convos with him, they were horrifyingly revealing. One time he was talking to me about how other patients weren&#39;t happy with their results. He said, &#34;it&#39;s not like it&#39;s my fault they all look and dress like queens.&#34; He then went on to criticize how I was dressed and my posture and said I&#39;ll never be a manly guy no matter what I do.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s not a friend of trans people. If he were, what happened to me wouldn&#39;t have happened. He used me, as he&#39;s using other trans women for money and fame. I hope what he does comes to light one day. Trans people are not experiments.

I do get the arrogant and too proud vibe from him. But what is shocking is how he treated you when you developed issues and tried to raise awareness. I&#39;ve heard of some people who are happy with his work but he obviously did you wrong. I  don&#39;t think any of the FFS surgeons to date are a friend to us but it is their duty to correct their mistakes and offer help if necessary. Similar to you I&#39;ve been abadoned and my synptoms keep getting worse.

I&#39;m really sorry to hear that you&#39;ve been abandoned after developing complications. That unfortunately, from what I&#39;ve heard and experienced, seems to be the M.O. of a lot of U.S. surgeons. I&#39;ve had better luck with treatment in Europe. If you are able to travel, maybe you could find help there.
</p>
<p>
I also still can&#39;t believe how I was treated. Honestly, all I wanted was a follow-up appointment and for him to help get my records into the hands of capable surgeons who could clean up his mess. But that was waaaaaay too scary for Dr. Douch-bag. Him and his whole team turned into absolute monsters. I don&#39;t wish that experience on anyone. It&#39;s awful that someone that dangerous is allowed to treat his patients like their lives are worthless.

Did you try to sue or something. It should be possible if your case is genuine and if DB did fail to adhere to the proper standards of  care.

I did not try to sue. I was still dealing with the infection a year later and I financially was not in a place to sue with all the medical expenses. I had to sell my apartment so that I could afford my ongoing treatment. It&#39;s one of the main things I regret (besides going to him) is not suing.

Hmmm I think most medmal cases can be funded through a no win no fee agreement. If your situation is bad or worse and surgery took place in the country that you&#39;re in lawyers will take your case. It is even more attractive for them if it is against a surgeon who is doing well for himself. You literally don&#39;t have to pay anything unless you win but you have to TELL THE TRUTH and NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH without exaggeration and provide documented evidence and documented communications via email etc. If you LIE you can be put into prison, case gets dropped or you pay all fees including your defendant&#39;s. In my case it is hard cause surgeon is in Belgium and I don&#39;t speak Dutch or can afford to hire a foreign lawyer and don&#39;t know their laws. But if your surgery was not over 2-3 years ago you can file. I don&#39;t see why not if you were genuinely harmed.

Yeah this was in 2017. When I messaged lawyers I never heard back. Don&#39;t know if it was because my case was so unusual or because I was trans. But I&#39;m still hoping to find a way to publish my story so that he will be unmasked.

&#34;feckallyall&#34; - - I am new here and stumbled on to this set of messages - -  so I am a bit lost.   Not sure what all of the deleted messages are about.

That unfortunately, from what I&#39;ve heard and experienced, seems to be the M.O. of a lot of U.S. surgeons. I&#39;ve had better luck with treatment in Europe. If you are able to travel, maybe you could find help there.&lt;&lt;
</p>

<p>
Can you tell me what procedures you had in Europe and who the surgeon or surgeons were ?
</p>
<p>
And what went wrong with your surgeries in the US to sour you on surgeons and make you like the surgical training done in Europe better than the surgical training done here in the U.S.    I used to do a lot of surgical OR nurse work.   Now I also have other duties.  You have my curiosity !

One of the users here is trying to discredit me since I have evidence of a coma and facial deformity that happened with Braly.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Brusco in Switzerland took out a shitload of old screws and infected stuff I had in my jaw, then he put in a 3-D custom printed titanium implant since I had dents and gaps along my jawline. Also looking at Dr. Ion to fix my nose which has so far been irreparable to US surgeons.
</p>
<p>
What went wrong in the US was I asphyxiated and fell into a coma after nearly dying. The surgeon experimented on me and refused to help me out after. There&#39;s a lot more that happened but that&#39;s the gist of it. feel free to DM me

Here you go! Post from 11 months ago, but talking about results from 4+ years back. Unverifiable account, but negative nonetheless. And some so-so, and critical comments thrown in as well.

<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This says a lot I think. Fat grafting to the face can have serious unintended issues. Generally when you undergo FFS you want the surgeon to take away rather than add. Not blaming the patient at all. She probably wanted high cheekbones or something similar. But from what I&#39;ve seen in results photos, that tends to be a bad call. The fat can settle in funny ways. I&#39;ve never thought that these techniques produce very natural looking results. Just my personal opinion.

I did the same to Brassard. Sure he might have 40 bad reviews, but he also has 4000 patients. It&#39;s about context.

Exactly! The surgeons that do the most work are also going to have the most patients with issues. It&#39;s just math. DiMaggio, for example, has some terrible reviews and at least one horribly botched patient. He also has some of the best and most beautiful results for forehead and upper face work out of anyone.

I have heard some pretty nasty horror stories, suing patients for leaving bad reviews, threatening people, etc. To the point where he isn&#39;t even on my list of surgeons.

Everyone reading or posting on this message string:
</p>
<p>
Consider taking a careful look at the recent messages responding to posts by Feckallyall. There are three new messages posted in about a 1 to 2 hour period earlier yesterday (July 2nd) in the afternoon by  throwawayihate2day ,  anonitsanon , and drklurker.
</p>
<p>
All three are apparent follow up messages to the messages from Feckallyall.
</p>
<p>
Notice anything strange about these three new messages - - ? Look closely and click on the post names to see the post history summary. All three of these were the very first message from BRAND NEW ACCOUNTS ESTABLISHED - - - when ?
</p>
<p>
Oh!  Wow!   The account history shows those accounts were opened on July 3rd. Anything weird about that ? Well, yes. The messages were actually posted on the afternoon of July 2nd.  Yes.  That&#39;s right.  They were posted on July 2nd, one day before the accounts were time stamped/dated by Reddit as new accounts.  That is all pretty mysterious.
</p>
<p>
All three messages, rather viciously attack the same surgeon.   Within the same hour.  In the same message string.  Coincidence - - or conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>
I have no idea how Reddit time stamps new accounts - - but unless these three new accounts were established by time travelers, then my guess is that they were most likely opened with Reddit as new accounts late on the afternoon of July 2nd (United States time zones) from an anonymous private mail server in Europe or Russian, or maybe India, where it was then ALREADY JULY 3d!   But that is just informed speculation.  Maybe there is an innocent explanation.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of THAT mysterious coincidence - - these three messages remain as:
</p>
<p>
a) the very first messages; b) each one from each of three brand new accounts; c) posted in the same sub reddit message string; and,  d) SIMULTANEOUSLY, telling horrible, unsupported and undocumented stories about one of the most highly regarded craniofacial / plastic / orthographic surgeons in the world.
</p>
<p>
(And, yes, I have met the surgeon and his mentor, Dr. Ousterhout, and a number of their respective patients at social events in San Francisco over the last two years or so.  More importantly,  I have seen the dozens of the photographs of the surgeon&#39;s patients   - - -   all of them direct photographs by provided by patients who have voluntarily posted those here in Reddit over the last several years to help other people make their decisions on what surgeries to have done.   Also, one of my close relatives was a patient several years ago.)
</p>
<p>
Mysteriously, all three of those brand new accounts on Reddit - - - JUST HAPPENED TO FIND THE SAME MESSAGE STRING - - - IN THE SAME SUB REDDIT - - AT THE SAME TIME on a Thursday afternoon!
</p>
<p>
Oh... and just by chance they all three had really bad experiences with the same doctor.   Just by chance.
</p>
<p>
Is that set of coincidences in any way believable or credible ?   Or is it more likely that Feckallyall just quickly set up those anonymous accounts and signed up those three brand new reddit user names and created those three posts to further continue his multi-year  vendetta and libelous attacks on the surgeon ?
</p>
<p>
Hard not to appreciate all of the highly unlikely coincidences that would have had to occur for those posts to be legitimate statements of those patients&#39; experiences.
</p>
<p>
Consider that the first of these three consecutive &#34;first time post&#34; messages,  the one by &#34;throwawayihate2day&#34; makes the claim that this surgeon sexually assaulted her as she was in the recovery room after her surgery.
</p>
<p>
Really - - ? Part of my work is in medical quality assurance associated with hospital personnel. Absent a code blue or other emergency, no male doctor EVER - - - EVER goes into a female patient room without a nurse with him. EVER. Hospital policies typically do not allow it. Moreover, most of those surgery recovery rooms have multiple patients and nurses etc. They all have security cameras. That claim is just over the top preposterous.
</p>
<p>
Respectfully, this kind of attack is totally unfair and should be identified and fully recognized as such. Feckyouall has been posting up unsupported and undocumented attacks on this surgeon for over two years on Reddit and probably other forums.  When Feckyouall has been called out by several other redditors - - in earlier message strings at different times last year (some of which were under earlier names - - since deleted) he then normally deletes the account and then re-surfaces with a new user name a few months later. By my count, he has done this at least three or maybe four times on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Please be aware of these circumstances.
</p>
<p>
For the record,  in case the three original messages are deleted by the mysterious original poster,  here is a copy of the first of those three messages.
</p>
<p>
If those messages are removed,  then the message below will also be removed.

You&#39;ve had your posts which are always targeted to attack me removed on other subs before.
</p>
<p>
I have enough evidence on my FB page, I don&#39;t need to make anything up about him. You bullied me pretty relentlessly on my last post too. This post is only a day old, so technically  everyone here has found this post within 24 hours. Please stop trying to discredit me. I&#39;ve been really patient with all of your questions before but now this is getting ridiculous.
</p>
<p>
Also I openly told everyone that I had posted before. This was my starting sentence. &#34;I&#39;ve posted this before but many didn&#39;t believe me so I took the post  down. I&#39;ve put up a lot of evidence on my facebook review of him, so  y&#39;all can go there for it.&lt;&lt;
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=148895379788360&amp;id=100040036966593&amp;notif_id=1577082050201374&amp;notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic" rel="nofollow">facebook</a>
&gt;&gt; Anyway, this time around my shell is hardened and I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m believed or not, that choice is up to you.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I know that you don&#39;t like what happened to me and that I have irrefutable evidence for it, but I&#39;m respectful of everyone who says they had a good experience. Please be respectful of my experience.

I had a good experience with Dr. D, he&#39;s thorough and meticulous which I think are Good Qualities to have in a FFS surgeon.
</p>
<p>
He leans rull hard into the Plastic Surgeon Luxe Experience which doesn&#39;t really appeal to me at all, and he&#39;s really expensive, but other than that I felt well taken care-of.
