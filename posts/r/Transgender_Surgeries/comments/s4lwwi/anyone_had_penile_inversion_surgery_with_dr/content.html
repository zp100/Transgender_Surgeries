I have the impression he&#39;s new to it and not very experienced. Probably quite risky.

Yeah he said he&#39;s performed 40 surgeries, he said he learned in the VUMC Amsterdam and said he uses a different technique that results in less loss of feeling than what they use. He said he doesn&#39;t use a cauterisation method with the glans penis which is usually responsible for the nerve damage.
</p>
<p>
I asked how many of his patients had loss of feeling and he said none.
</p>
<p>
Idk I&#39;m sick of waiting and dealing with the dysphoria down there. And if i go somewhere else I&#39;ll have to wait a while so idk idk.
</p>
<p>
I asked a few questions i had on the top of my head at my first appointment but wasn&#39;t prepared for the surgery talk, i thought I would just have to ask for a referral to hair removal and ask which places would have to have hair removed, because i like my current amount of hair down there.
</p>
<p>
I asked over email to see pictures of his past surgeries and he said that he would show me next appointment which is fine. If i aesthetically don&#39;t mind them I&#39;ll probably go for it.
</p>
<p>
Maybe if there&#39;s any questions i can ask to gauge how well it might go with him that&#39;d be great, otherwise, hugh chance I&#39;ll take the risk.

I don&#39;t know there&#39;s much else you can ask. There&#39;s no chance a surgeon is going to tell you they are bad and you should see someone better.  Personally I don&#39;t trust any of them and prefer to look at independent reviews. The consequences of getting botched are very serious.

Fair point. I&#39;ll have to really think about it, dunno which surgeons are considered good in NL/BE area and what waiting times will be for them. I can probably argue with my insurance to go to Belgium but it&#39;ll be much harder.
