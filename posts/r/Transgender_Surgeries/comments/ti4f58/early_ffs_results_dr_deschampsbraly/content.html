Thanks!  When I finally got the cast off I was uber happy with how well the profile flowed, even mummified up I could still tell I was gonna be happy.  Honestly my nose was my main worry, but I think he hit it exactly where I wanted it.

Did you describe what kind of nose you wanted to him before surgery? Not sure how that works. We briefly talked about it during consultation.

We did a bit during the photo adjustments in the consultation.  I didn&#39;t really have a vision in mind for what exactly I wanted my nose to be tbh.  I just knew I didn&#39;t want it too pointy or upturned (I think my exact words were I don&#39;t want it looking like Michael Jackson&#39;s lol).  Reinforced this during my pre-op, and he did another couple quick renderings; one more curved and one straighter and I definitely preferred a bit of a curve.  He was definitely willing to work with me on it.  But outside of my subtle preferences, I explicitly gave him free reign to do what he felt was best balanced for my face overall.

Thanks so much!!  The story will definitely be a bit of a roller coaster due to all the logistics and such, but the end result makes me soo happy!  The actual plan was fairly loose though, I told Dr. DB where my main points of dysphoria were, but wanted to lend to his expertise in how to address them in a balanced way.  Totally worth it!

Haha, thanks!!  I honestly HATED getting my pics taken before, probably readable in my expression.  I was actually trying to hold back smiling in my new ones to get a better 1:1, was only semi-successful lol

Haha, nope!  Definitely not a repost.  Although the before and afters are done in a studio at his office, plus Dr. DB has a particular style.  So I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you&#39;ve seen similar picture pairs.
</p>
<p>
And thanks!  I honestly have my partner to thank for a lot of it.  This was my first ever surgery, and she helped keep me calm, sane, and on schedule the whole time (still is haha)

My main question after looking at your FFS results is what exactly was the name of the specific surgeries that was done to your face?
</p>
<p>
Like I see a jaw, nose, and forehead difference... But what exactly are the names of these procedures.
</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance.

Couple of additions actually (sorry for the correction babe! ‚ù§Ô∏è):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dr. DB called my Scalp Advancement a &#34;hybrid&#34; approach.  The majority of the incision went right across my hairline cutting off my widow&#39;s peak, then kind of went into my actual hair around my temples.  That helped get rid of a little bit of the recession.
</li>
<li>
The Forehead Contouring was type 3
</li>
<li>
The Genioplasty was a &#34;T-style&#34; reduction. It&#39;s a bit different than just cutting off the tip of the chin and repositioning it.
<br>
</li>
<li>
The Jaw Contouring also included a masseter muscle reduction
</li>
<li>
The Fat Grafting was sourced from my thighs, so a couple extra incisions to deal with lol
</li>
</ul>

Thanks and congrats as well!  Definitely exciting to be able to see a large part of the results so quickly, was a happy surprise haha
</p>
<p>
Also, for me the most difficult part of the recovery was the first few days.  So best of luck it&#39;s only uphill for you now during the rest of your recovery, and hope your Monday is just as exciting! ‚ù§Ô∏è
