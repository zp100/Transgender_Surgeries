Today I had a consultation with Dr. G√∂tz-Christian Melloh, he is a quite new member of Team Markovsky and an urologist.  Initially I had the appointment with Dr Klemenz but for some reasons I don‚Äôt know he had no time to do it himself. First of all, he asked me some questions about my transgender past and what surgeries I got done so far. After that he moved on with a presentation and a quite detailed sequence of pictures from the operating room. He seemed a bit confused and in a hurry but he apologised for that serveral times but for me it was just a fact which made him even more pleasant. I‚Äôve noticed that they developed the used method (basis  is the Invagination method). They divide the remaining part of the  glans after creating a smaller clitoris into two legs which serve as additional erogenous tissue. Then I asked some questions and in the end he shortly examined the ‚Äúarea‚Äù and ensured me that there might be enough tissue so that there might not be a necessity for a second skin graft. A final statement will be necessary before the real surgery date.
