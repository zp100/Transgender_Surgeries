Hi, Dr. Brassard was my surgeon too... you&#39;re two weeks in?  As in you had surgery around January 10?  If so, you have been home for less than a week and this seems normal based on my experience.
</p>
<p>
Do you remember what the nurses told you about it?  If you didn&#39;t meet with Dr. Brassard, did you meet with one of his colleagues like Dr. Laungani?  What sort of instructions did they give you at L&#39;Ascelipade?
</p>
<p>
I had a big piece of gauze for a couple of weeks after I got home.  It felt like it was attached to me and it was so gross when I went to the washroom.  The instructions I was given were that I could trim the gauze VERY carefully which I did.  Have you ever been around a new born with a clip on their belly button that you need to be really gentle with when you do up their diaper?  That is what the experience reminded me.  One day I hit the gauze with my towel and that didn&#39;t feel good but it was fine.
</p>
<p>
Hope the nurses get back to you, they&#39;re pretty good by email.

Awh thank you so much. Yeah they said I could trim it but I don&#39;t think I should cut it off from the bottom part. Yeah I have been speaking with asclepiad. I&#39;m just waiting for a message back. Did your gauze just fall out? Yeah I had mine on the 10th so it&#39;s been two weeks in total. I really appreciate the response. I&#39;ll let you know what they say. I&#39;m probably freaking out for nothing. Also have you managed to stay on #4 dilator? I can use it for a few minutes a day but I&#39;ve been relying on #3 mainly.

I was on #4 from the beginning with no issues.  The nurse said I had a really big stent so should start with that so that&#39;s what we did.  There was some minor bleeding about four weeks in but nothing other than that.

I had started off with it as well. I can keep it in for 27 minutes max with pain medication. But I&#39;m running out right now of the oxycodone and all the pins and needles around the clit make it insanely hard to keep it in for that long. So I&#39;ve been doing #3 for 25-40 minutes x4 .Then #4 twice a day for 5-10 minute after #3. Once the pain goes away I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to keep it in longer. It&#39;s just the overall pain of the clitoris right now and the stitching.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t gave up on 4. But I&#39;m terrified I&#39;m going to be loose like my ex. She had the procedure done as well and I had sex with her when I still had a massive dick and was incredibly loose. So I have no idea if dilating with 4 it still worth it in the end. But I will make sure I use it everyday.

I haven&#39;t spoken to him yet. I have to wait another two weeks before I&#39;m allowed to. In the booklet it says the yellow stuff is normal and they said the gauze should fall out eventually, no specified time, also fusing of the labia can happen and it&#39;s normal and can be corrected with surgery. I&#39;m freaking out though I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m supposed to look this swollen and at the bottom I&#39;m absorbing all the stitches and it looks granulated. I haven&#39;t seen any photos of the surgery before so I have no clue. Im scared to see what&#39;s in there when it falls out. I don&#39;t want to have to get a revision.

I mean I&#39;ve spoken to them when I was at the clinic. They reassured me everything was fine. I just mean in the past week since I&#39;ve been home. I&#39;m assuming this is normal. I&#39;ve been in contact with GRS Montreal and they&#39;ve said everything is ok so far. I had Dr.Brassard do my surgery.

Contact the clinic. I went to the Montreal clinic for my GRS and the staff is very nice. They’ll listen to your concerns.

I thought you were going to say someone I never heard of. There obviously have a lot of experience.

Maybe someone else has said something useful.

That link helped me out so much right now. I&#39;m looking at someone 12 days in and I&#39;m 14. They have so much more blood and crust around the stitches. So that gives me an idea that I&#39;m actually healing alright. You&#39;ve been such a great help. Also to everyone else who took the time here to help me out, you have no idea how much I appreciate this. Thank you

You aren’t “allowed” to talk to your doctor for two weeks? That by itself is deeply concerning. This does not look normal. Normally I tell people to listen to their medical team, but I’m concerned you may have necrosis and/or infection. That black tissue especially is deeply concerning, and it’s not standard to have gauze packing for weeks, nor should you EVER be told you can’t talk to your doctor when you have urgent questions. You need to find a secondary medical care NOW. Please do not delay.

The black tissue is actually a gauze that&#39;s in there. It&#39;s not skin. It&#39;s supposed to fall out eventually. There&#39;s no black spots.

When I zoom in super close, it looks like there is black tissue adhering to the gauze. I am doubtful that there is not something going wrong down there. Be that as it may, it’s not normal to have packing for two weeks that you don’t take it out. It’s not normal to not be allowed to talk to the doctor. There is nothing about this experience that is not concerning. Again, please insist that you be allowed to talk to your doctor or else find other medical care as soon as possible. I have had surgery myself and talked to many, many other postops and no one has ever had an experience like this save one other person who developed complications from an unknown surgeon. I don’t want that to happen to anybody else.

Thank you very much for the reply. Yeah it says if I have any questions to contact the post op team. But I have to wait to schedule video appointment 1 month from the surgery date with the surgeon. It sucks but I can&#39;t force him to talk to me. Also I just managed to cut the hanging gauze out earlier and I feel so much better, its starting to look more normal now. I will post more photos in the following days if you&#39;re all interested. I&#39;ll just make a new post. Thanks again!

If you can’t contact the surgeon, go to your pcp and get it checked out.   They can at least tell if there is infection or necrosis.

Yeah it&#39;s been going through the gauze and out the sides. I usually take some soap and rub it around then I spray saline solution in there or just take a quick bath. Peeing in the bathtub mainly right now because I usually have to clean after anyway. I know it&#39;s nasty but I&#39;m have a hard time not getting pee all over the floor lol... 😭

I looked a bit like that when I left Asclepiade in July 2022.  I spent lots of time in sitz baths. Lots and lots, as hot as I could stand. It was off before tw weeks. And, when I wasn’t soaking hot, I was icing.
</p>
<p>
The instructions were quite clear… if problems, contact Asclepiade. I did several times and had quick, helpful answers.

Yeah I&#39;ve messaged them before but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m contacting them too much. Also I wanted an opinion from someone that also had the same procedure. I have contacted them in regards to this though. Thanks for the information.

Did you stay at Asclépiade after the surgery? My gauze was removed on Day 4 (Day 5 for those with a canal), by a nurse, while I was at Asclépiade . I was just left with a bit of it on the clitoris that was supposed to fall in its own (and it did a few days later).
</p>
<p>
Would it be possible for you to go there so they can look?

Awh hello. Thanks for your concern. I managed to cut most of it out. But part of it is still attached to my labia. I&#39;m hoping it just falls out soon. Also I&#39;ve been leaking a bit of discharge. They assured me it should be ok. I&#39;ll keep you all posted.

The discharge goes on for a long time. I had it several weeks in. What really surprised me is that they sent you home with the gauze even without the catheter. I have no idea why they left the gauze in. Best of luck!

And yes I stayed at Asclepiad. I left with the gauze on. I can&#39;t go back it&#39;s 2 hours away from here and I can&#39;t afford more train rides at the moment.

After about three weeks I developed a couple of very tender spots inside. #4 was not possible due to the pain, even tried topical anaesthetic but still owie. I dropped back to #2 and #3 for about three weeks, then gently, slowly reintroduced #4 without  problems. After six months now doing once a day, 5 minutes on 2, 5 minutes on 3, and 20-25 minutes on 4. Seems to be working but if I use too much pressure I get a bit of blood on the dilator. No blood flow after dilating.

Awh thanks for sharing your experience. I&#39;m glad you were able to return to the original. I have #4 in right now but I&#39;m getting tons of discharge from my clit area. It looks really gross right now. I did my regular dilation with 4 earlier for 7-10 minutes, right now the pain is unbearable so I&#39;m only doing it for 5. I have no issues with #3. I can keep it in for over an hour with no issues.

Try to gently pull it off bit by bit on the edges. If you’re sitz bathing everytime you dilate it should be soft by now. Mine fell off on 9th day. Everytime after my sitz bathe i try to loosen the edges. And on the 9th day after my shower, it just fell off. I had mine with Dr. Brassard last year of September.

Thanks for the advice. I managed to cut move of it out. It was barely hanging on. But now I&#39;m leaking discharge down there like crazy. I&#39;m not sure if this is bad. I&#39;m still waiting for a reply from the clinic.
