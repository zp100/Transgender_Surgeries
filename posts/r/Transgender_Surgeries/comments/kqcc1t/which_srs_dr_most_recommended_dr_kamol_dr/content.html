As someone who went to Chett, I&#39;d heavily recommend going to Dr Suporn or Dr Bank instead.

Honestly he did a piss poor job on me. There are dozens of Chett results on this reddit and none of them look remotely anything like me. I have a massive fucking huge and long scar on one leg and that scar still makes it uncomfortable to stretch my leg 5 years later.  Out of ALL the results I&#39;ve seen from EVERY surgeon, not a single one of them has scars as bad as mine.
</p>
<p>
I asked for a revision and this fucker has the nerve to tell me that
<em>
iT LooKs sO PerFeCT and WoMaNLy
</em>
. My second mistake was trusting him a second time to do a revision on me. All he did was fuck up the appearance even more and now I&#39;m looking for a surgeon to fix what he did to me.
</p>
<p>
When I went for SRS, there were 2 other girls who had surgery at the same time, both of which have horror stories.
</p>
<p>
The first girl had necrosis and everything was rotting and falling off for the first 3 weeks. Meanwhile Chett and Som kept telling her that everything was just perfect and it&#39;s healing perfectly and there&#39;s no problem at all! It was only after repeatedly questioning and confronting that they finally admitted that necrosis happens sometimes, however it can be mitigated during the follow up revision after 3 weeks.
</p>
<p>
The second girl had a problem with her bladder after leaving Thailand and was leaking pee all over her vagina. When she asked for help and asked if he could do anything, instead, Chett blamed her and said it was her fault for dilating too hard and breaking the wall. He denied any wrong doing during the surgery and eventually stopped responding altogether.
</p>
<p>
I know this is only a sample size of 3, but out of all 3 of us that went, all of us had a horrible experience.
</p>
<p>
Even putting all that aside, I really dislike his work even on other patients. IMO there is no definition to the labia and more than half of his patients don&#39;t even end up symmetrical.

I had a decent experience with him, but depth issues seem to be way more of a common issue than he lets on. Of the girls at our hotel, at least 2 others as well as me had issues with getting 3-4” of depth rather than the promised 7-8”.
</p>
<p>
As for his reactions, yeah I can see that. I would email with concerns and he’d just be like “yeah, it looks great, everything is 100% great and wonderful, a flowering rose petal of femininity blah blah blah”. Not a fan, just be straight with me please.
</p>
<p>
Would probably recommend another surgeon as well to be honest.

I had the surgery at Sporen Clinic, I can tell that in terms of nerve sensitivity and  orgasm it is just perfect! I do not know girls who have a hard time reaching orgasm and just mention that it is much better and it is a feeling that I also experience.  In terms of appearance, I think that in PAI, the results are better cosmetically for SporenThe dailation are very difficult ,in terms of depth. I reached 17 cm and after three months, I lost 1 cm.
</p>
<p>
One of the things that really bothered is the hotel, the sanitation is bad and the food is not tasty and there is no variety in the menu does not justify the price of the hotel and especially that there is no proper atmosphere and sanitation after surgery and recovery from it, I hope the conditions at the hotel have changed for the better.

Hi dear , thanks for answering me
</p>
<p>
You have WhatsApp of dr supron? Is so hard talking in mails .. dr kamol has WhatsApp Its make the process so much easier... and dear you research before you pick supron also dr kmol and Chettawut ?
</p>
<p>
And I know dr kamol has 5 different type of techniques- the one they suggest most is   Type 4.2 and 5.1 - which supron type you did ?
</p>
<p>
.4SRS using sigmoid colon- This technique is used in the case patients who have short penis and skin or who would like to have a natural lubricated vaginal with optimal depth. There are 2 options for SRS using sigmoid colon: )4.1Open technique 420,000 THB (14,000 USD approximately); ~8- 10 cm. incision scar in the bikini line )4.2 ); 4 small incisions in the abdomen -Hospitalization: 7 nights -Duration time of surgery: 6 hours -We recommend you to stay in Thailand for recovery 3-4 weeks *The BMI (Body Mass Index) should not be more than 25-26 *We do not perform the open technique in HIV patients .5SRS-PPV (Penile-Peritoneal Vaginoplasty) This is the most current advance technique and innovation of neovaginoplasty for transwomen. The procedure using penile inversion combine with peritoneum pull through the neovaginal canal by laparoscopic method. The neovagina will has self lubricate resemble to biologic female. The neovagina is Laparoscopic technique 577,500 THB (19,250 USD This technique is benefit for those who have chronic colitis (Crohn’s disease). In addition, the that’s no hair growth at the deep part of the neovagina. There are 1 option for this technique: )5.1 ); 4 small incisions in the abdomen -Hospitalization: 7 nights -Duration time of surgery: 6 hours
</p>
<p>
-We recommend you to stay in Thailand for recovery 3-4 weeks.
</p>
<p>
Thanks

I have no information for communication on WhatsApp, I imagine that there is no. On the subject of communication with contacts they are very late. They have renewed the site only now that it was something that should have been done a long time ago!  And the clinic&#39;s contacts are sometimes busy arguing instead of finding solutions such as doing their own job and filling out the medical profile on a PC. I personally do not have a PC.  In other clinics, just send the questionnaire to the email and send back, it is very simple.  Until that happened, they made sure to send me emails that they did not believe I had a PC, and they had to believe me and do the job for me. It was a really surreal situation.
</p>
<p>
Regarding Suporn&#39;s method of surgery, as far as I know he only has one method of surgery, you should think carefully about what is really important to you, and hear the disadvantages and advantages of each method of surgery.   In suporn method you Must dilation a lifetime.  If you are in a period when you are not sexually active then you should dilation often and it is something to worry about and take into account and it is a particularly sucky situation, it restricts the freedom.  And I also want to emphasize that it is best not to get into long periods without sexual contact and vaginal penetration because it just goes backwards and then you has to get used to the act again.
</p>
<p>
I chose Suporn because that&#39;s what I knew and my girlfriends underwent his surgery, and these are almost the only results I&#39;ve seen live.  I personally know patients who have lied about vaginal depth even 5 cm apart!  I can say that the patients I knew achieved vaginal that the average is 15 cm and sometimes even less so do not listen to stories of vaginas and endless depths.  Hope I helped

Dr. Suporn will give you what you ask for but there are limitations to each method this is the reason for the multiplicity of methods.  For me the full nerve feeling and feeling like it was always there, it&#39;s worth it all and its result looks very natural.  Just at that time I was young and a little stupid and underwent more surgical procedures to improve the appearance because the first result seemed to me too old, unfortunately another surgery brought with it complications, infection and I found I was sensitive to antibiotics and in addition I smoked.  The clinic clung to the fact that I smoked as the only cause of the complications that happened, only I was not the only one with infection and there were more girls with infection and they would not smoke. Today I see it completely unnecessary, the first result was very good.

I&#39;m not sure there is surgery that offers vaginal without dilation, maybe vaginal from the colon requires much less dilation but this is information you must find out with each surgeon and also understand that our body does not listen to surgeons and sometimes needs much more effort to maintain results

<p>
That&#39;s how it is with any SRS technique. You dilate a lot in the beginning, then you dilate less and less often as your body heals. Usually by 1 year post-op you only need to dilate a few times a week, and at that point, penetrative sex counts. So if you have a partner, they can &#34;help&#34; you dilate too. ;)
</p>
<p>
To your question, my vote is for Suporn Clinic, just based on my own research (not experience, yet). They cost the most out of any Thai surgeon, but they&#39;ll take great care of you and their results are consistently the best I&#39;ve seen.

I do not buy the &#34;less dilation&#34; unlike the colon, which moves part of an entire organ to another place ... here it is a tissue covering on an area that is wound, and where there is a wound scar tissue develops that needs dilation and this scar will always be in the process of contraction.
</p>
<p>
Lubrication like of a natural organ?  how exactly?  This is definitely an area that is humid but not enough for penetration.  I just think we should share as much information as possible and talk about the surgery in a factual way, without exaggerating to talk about things exactly the way they are, that way it will not allow all kinds of clinics to publish information that is sometimes at a particularly blatant lie.

I wrote to you from my experience and from what I know and understand, just keep checking with surgeons and do not rush.  And also have to make sense about it it&#39;s not magic it&#39;s surgery. I hope girls who have had the surgery in other methods will answer you from their personal experience, and maybe you should decide that you do not decide now.  In my opinion if you think you are going through the surgery and after that continue as usual as if it was always there then this is a stop sign for you.

I had surgery with suporn in the past week. As far as I know, suporn doesnt have whatsapp. They use email as the primary means of communication. It takes some time for them to respond to emails usually ~3 day.
</p>
<p>
In terms of pros: they take really good care of you once you arrive in thailand and walk you through everything.
</p>
<p>
Cons: Its a bit scary being in a foreign country, but the nurses are very friendly. And when there is a communication barrier, google translate works wonders, or you can use the phone numbers they give you for the cliniic staff when you get here.
</p>
<p>

<p>
I can&#39;t comment on long term results as I haven&#39;t been discharged from the hospital yet. I highly recommend going through the wiki here

Hello a question: What makes you believe that the surgeons at PAI produce better results than those at the Suporn Clinic? both clinics are on my list and your opinion would be helpful

I just saw both results and I liked more of PAI&#39;s cosmetic results only!  Suporn makes everything thick and big ... and it is very important to choose which surgeon do you prefer for your complications?  And here I prefer Suporn

And by the way, I have a couple of questions for you regarding your surgery: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. Suporn over Dr. Bank? Do you recommend Dr. Suporn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? Did you have revision surgery? And if I had it, what did it improve? How was your stay in Thailand (Chon Buri)? How was the aftercare for Dr. Suporn? Have you tried soul dilators? And if you used them, is there any advantage? and by the way many congratulations on the surgery

Look in the wiki here and count the number of reviews for each surgeon. It will give some approximation.
</p>
<p>
Actually reading the reviews and looking at the photos would be better though.

Did you go to Suporn? I had the impression you went to someone else.
