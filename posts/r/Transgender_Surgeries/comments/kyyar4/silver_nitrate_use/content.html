Same here I had a small spot treated by my doctor. I do live close to his office, so I was able to drive there.

I had hypergranulation on my scalp but was never asked to treat it myself.

There’s places where you probably shouldn’t do it yourself. I’ve heard of the urethra getting blocked and ending up in emergency, and that’s with a doctor doing it. Also, around clitoris is risky.

The reason for the tube of 100 is that&#39;s just one of the quantities they come in. Means you don&#39;t have to worry about running out, at least.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s fairly easy to apply to the more outward locations, it&#39;s when the granulation is deeper than an inch or so you&#39;ll need help as you can&#39;t hold the mirror and keep yourself open while still applying it.
</p>
<p>
When applying it, you may feel a sting or slight burn, this is expected but doesn&#39;t always happen. Just gently brush/roll the tips against the granulation tissue, it&#39;ll react with the moisture, and you will see the silver nitrate on the tips of the sticks disappearing as you run it on.
</p>
<p>
The silver nitrate you apply will neutralize itself via the chemical process that cauterizes the granulation tissue you apply it to, but you may want to take a shower after a couple minutes to rinse off residual residue/byproduct so it doesn&#39;t smear around and stain the surrounding skin (lasts 1.5 to 2 weeks or so). Just be very gentle with the treated spot as you&#39;re literally chemically burning the granulation tissue away, no scrubbing the area.
</p>
<p>
If your surgeon prescribed anything else to go over the treated area (medi honey, betamethasone, bacitracin, etc.) apply it after gently patting the area dry after your shower.

Wait you&#39;re supposed to do it on yourself? That seems very odd. I&#39;ve had one round of it done so far, but my surgeon did it himself.

Yeah. I’m not super sure I wanna do it. See them in a month so maybe I’ll wait and have them treat it. They’re in northern Cali and I’m in southern Cali.

If I were in your position I&#39;d just wait. If you really want it done soon your primary care doctor might also be willing to do it. I know mine said she&#39;d be open to it, depending on where it was.
