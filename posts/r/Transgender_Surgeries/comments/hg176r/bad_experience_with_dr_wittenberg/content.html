<p>
How much did you have immediately post surgery?  Did you keep up with the recommended dilation schedule?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Also my inner labia is too short, so the skin at the bottom of the inner labia partially occludes the vaginal opening. Basically skin blocks almost all of the vaginal opening, and the skin has to be pushed down in order for anything to go in the vagina.
</p>

<p>
I have seen this same issue posted a few times before where the posterior forchette partially or fully covers the vagina opening.  This seems like it is common enough to get a revision on.  Have you asked Dr. Wittenberg about this?

I had full. After surgery I was up just under the last dot on the dilator. I could do a revision but I&#39;m trying to stretch the skin using the dilator. I&#39;m having some success so here&#39;s to hoping that it won&#39;t be necessary. Atm there&#39;s no way I can psychologically take going through another surgery.

How far are you able to get the dilator in? Both my roommate and I had PPT with Dr. Whittenberg and both of us have up to the second dot. She&#39;s at 8 months and I&#39;m at 6.
</p>
<p>
The muscles themselves down there are horrid. If I stick my finger in there&#39;s muscles right at the very back that are more closed off but still &#34;available.&#34; I have to dilate those muscles with my finger, and then stick the dilator in and push *hard* for like 15 minutes. And then I slowly cycle up, pushing *hard* each tier. I cry almost every session.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I will say that we both have a lot of muscle training do. I can take a dick-sized thing when I pleasure myself after like 15-20 minutes of playing with it and building up (no idea what my roommate gets to during her sessions we don&#39;t do things together) and we can both get to big orange
<em>
eventually
</em>
when we dilate but it just takes a lot of time and owie.

Are you sure you&#39;ve lost the depth? Get something
<em>
really
</em>
thin and see if you can get it to depth. If you can, go to Soulsource and order the P1 dilator, super skinny. I had a similar issue, thought I was losing depth but I was able to recover it because I really just lost width. I went from P1 all the way to Green / Orange. It can be done!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really sorry about your experience, Dr. Wittenberg is a great surgeon but her obsession with avoiding opiates is really like, Not Okay given the magnitude of this surgery

I absolutely concur with the advice to get the petite dilators. I did not have them when I left the hospital, but did learn quickly how important they are to the full recovery process.
</p>
<p>
Also, what type of lube are you using ? Not all types of lube work well with the SS polyurethane dilators.

My own view is that is has something to do with exactly how much girth you ended up with from the surgery. Some people, I suspect get more, others get less. While I can get the big orange #4 dilator in, I cannot get it to 5th dot, only 3rd. So maybe I have somewhat less girth than some people. Maybe mine is a bit more tapered than some.

Kitan is 100% correct..
</p>
<p>
I have heard a good amount of stories about Dr. Wittenberg patients; when doing PPT brought up that post op you will lose some of the depth as in the back seems to tighten. It then recovers lil by lil after a good amount of months.. I think avg I heard is about in 5-6+ Months back to post op surgery depth.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m now realizing that this must be why...its not the PPT it is how she is having maintenance done.
</p>
<p>
On the East coast now the Surgeons doing PPT, its common now to at least for 5min after your regular dilation, use the smallest one. It seems that the tightening is a real thing (its not depth loss) and using standard dilation the patients are not getting far back enough so this is meant to slowly counter that and it works. You will even know simply by using it as a double check in the first place as it will go in further. Nearing the end of the 5min and making sure its all the way back you then pivot it to the left , then the right, then up and down slowly before pulling it out.
<br>
What is happening as you go up in size you are slowly not getting back as far because the apex of the back was not getting caught up so its always behind.
<br>
This method seems to avoid that 100%.
</p>
<p>
Opinion/Speculation:I have heard Dr. Wittenberg many times talk about how she does 2 steps.
</p>
<p>
(I always through this weird because Labiaplasty traditionally was always done in a later procedure for a neater look if wanted.. So I assume that&#39;s why she leaves the extra material - but you would think this would have been brought up.
</p>
<p>
The only other thing I can think of is she did both at once if not the above mentioned 2 part(?). Which has a risk to not come out right.I mean either way she would fix it.
</p>
<p>
Do as Kitan said (Even now) and you will have success. You are around that time where it starts to gain some elasticity back anyway People need to remember this is still new and the unknown is still even greater for full PPT.. Tbh Ive head nothing but good - long term still pending.
</p>
<p>
Best Wishes

As long as you can get
<em>
something
</em>
to the back, you can recover it. And you can move up relatively quickly, i probably took 3-4 weeks per level though I was pretty aggressive with that schedule.
</p>
<p>
Try to remember that this surgery is indeed super new, that&#39;s the downside, that doctors are gonna not give out perfect instructions right now. Like anything else Trans Health, you
<strong>
have
</strong>
to be actively pushing for your own care, researching online, and ensuring you get a good result. You
<em>
cannot
</em>
just &#34;do what the doctor says&#34;. If it doesn&#39;t look right, say something fast!

She took me off of my pain medication after 2 WEEKS. This resulted in me living in literally hellish pain for the remaining week that I was in San Francisco. I could literally feel the stitches in my clitoris. The pain was horrible beyond your imagination.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
First, I&#39;m really sorry you went thru this. At the very least you should have had choices, and the ability to choose wisely.
</p>
<p>
As to pain tolerance … everyone is different. While I was recovering in the hospital I had percs available via PRN. I probably used them no more than twice a day, and maybe once/day the last couple of days.
</p>
<p>
They sent me home with a script for percs. At a clinic checkup, maybe 2 weeks post surgery, the nurse asked about my pain level … I replied about a 1 mixed in with the swelling. She then asked me if I was taking percs, and I told her I had not filed the script. Then she wanted to know if I was on Tylenol, and I said no. At that point she made a few notes and left the room. Maybe 5 mins later the surgeon came in, looked over at me and said &#34;your a tough old bird&#34;. I took that as a complement of sorts, I wasn&#39;t trying to prove anything, but I was managing my medicines very carefully. Various conversations later it comes out that I have a considerable amount of pain tolerance. Everyone is different.
</p>
<p>
I hope, over time, that your pain issues lessen, and you end up with the result you wanted. Peace.

<p>
I&#39;m sorry you experienced this, here&#39;s what I can offer for feedback.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
after primary PI GCS with the same surgeon, I was able to have penetrative sex at about 4 months and then, only with my smallest dildo, one that&#39;s easier to take than most of the &#39;real&#39; penises I&#39;ve experienced. I wasn&#39;t ready for what I&#39;d call more spontaneous until more like 9 months (at which point I had one *vigorous* session of like an hour of penetration. It was a little early for that, however it worked. By 12 months, I could do that sort of thing more easily and by 18 months, things finally began to feel settled in.
</li>
<li>
I also lost depth, from initially 7&#34; depth down to &lt; 4&#34; at about 6 months. Dr Wittenberg attributed it that I probably heal more aggressively than most people (which I know to be true, I&#39;ve always beat surgeon&#39;s estimates of my ability to return to activity by a factor of 2, however I also got their clearances along the way).
</li>
<li>
my revision surgery PPTV, same surgeon, 7 months ago now has been similar, and different also. The PPTV healing process is not the same and I found dilating *much* more demanding and painful than from primary GCS, even though in most other respects I had little pain.
</li>
<li>
the occlusion you describe at what I&#39;m taking to be the anterior fourchette of your vagina is something some of us experience. That&#39;s the most-stressed skin in most GCS procedures and depending on position, that happens with cis women&#39;s vaginas also (a couple of my about 20 partners). This may resolve in time or could want revision.
</li>
<li>
I also have a very high pain tolerance (I never took narcotic pain meds for more than a couple days after major orthopedic surgeries). Primary GCS proved different, it turns out when the pain is low-level however unrelenting, it&#39;s very draining for me and I continued to use some percocet out to 2 weeks, however I was taking less than half the prescribed dose for adequate control (I hate the side-effects of opiodes and was only able to take as much as I did due to the anti-nausea med that hadn&#39;t been available for prior surgeries).
</li>
<li>
I also hated gabapentin, for different reasons. It made me jittery and I knocked off of it early. Unfortunately that also resulted in severe withdrawal, I needed to resort to marijuana to sleep a few times. I got support for this from my pshrink back home, we tapered off over a 2 week period. This speaks to having a good support network.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So I want to suggest that what you&#39;re unhappy about may resolve in time and has been experienced by others. I knew most of these things going into both surgeries.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Ok, all that said, I&#39;m sorry, I have some direct critiques of your post.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you broke the terms that (all) GCS surgeons put down for support. I worked hella hard to have a support system in place for my entire recovery in SF, my partner could only stay a week and she didn&#39;t come out for the surgery, arriving when I was released from hospital after both surgeries. I had full support with friends in the area after she left. I couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t have undertaken the surgery without that support. Dr Wittenberg&#39;s staff were 100% clear and required documentation of my support plans.
</li>
<li>
I know everyone experiences pain differently, however solving &#39;feeling stitches&#39; with percocet doesn&#39;t fit my idea of appropriate use. In your shoes I&#39;d allow that her motivation was more about concern for the overall health of her patient than of lawsuits.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Obviously I hope things clear up for you. your post is lacking in some specifics (depth measures, measure reference points), so it&#39;s hard to gauge where you&#39;ll wind up. I reiterate, I, and most post-op women I know experience that it takes more than a year for GCS to fully settle in. This also squares with what&#39;s known about the tissue healing process.

Thanks for the information, very much value your experience, but I do think I still will go with her. Have a consult next month. I will try to negotiate and discuss her painkiller stance beforehand, if not, I will probably just transition to using Marijuana to manage the pain, considering it is legal in Cali. And I do want to ask, &#34;why&#34; do you have very little depth? I doubt you started with no depth. I&#39;m guessing you were unable to keep up with dilation especially in the beginning (bc of extreme pain), so got major depth loss as a result. Considering it is FULL PPT, as you said, not even worrying about having enough material to work with, can&#39;t see why you would start with not enough depth?
</p>
<p>
EDIT:Wait a second, why were you in an airbnb alone? I&#39;ve read her website and talked over email with them many times about this, but they SPECIFICALLY require a caregiver to be with you for 3 weeks? No gaps in coverage, can have multiple different ones, but how were you alone? I would hope it was just a short time you were alone, like caretaker getting groceries, bc that sounds blatantly against their protocol. Unless that last week was your 4th week? Crossin my fingers that that was the case.

Don’t smoke the Marijuana, it’s really bad for healing.

You don&#39;t have to smoke it. Some people have really good responses to CBD oil, edibles, or transdermal patches. It does take the edge off a little in my experience, but it&#39;s not nearly as good as oxy. It helped me to not have to take a ton of Tylenol though.

Marijuana usage is completely anecdotal and hasn&#39;t been researched in depth to see if it truly causes a delay in healing or not - so we can&#39;t say if it&#39;s bad for healing or not!
</p>
<p>
I smoked marijuana throughout the entirety of my healing process (though waited about 5/6 weeks post operatively) and never experienced any functional or aesthetic complications due to it.  YMMV but do air on the side of caution!

I&#39;m guessing you were unable to keep up with dilation especially in the beginning (bc of extreme pain), so got major depth loss as a result.

<p>
No I follow the dilation schedule despite the pain. As I said in the original post, I was dilating 1.5 hrs per day. 3x 30 mins, as directed

I had 24/7 support for 2 weeks, but my mom had to return home after the 2 weeks. After that I had people stopping in to check on me (2 were nurses). Not everyone can find 24/7 support on the other side of the country from where they live. I was lucky to have what I had tbh.

<p>
My best advice to you for pain meds is to talk to your PCP or other doc and have them give you a big supply of 5 or 10mg percocet/oxy
<em>
before you go
</em>
(pain meds cant be called in from out of state, which I learned the hard way). That way if you end up in my situation, you can just use your supply.

You say 24/7 support, and then you say most of the day and overnight you&#39;re alone.  Those two things can&#39;t happen at the same time.
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m guessing now you had someone there the first two week but not after.  Or you consider someone coming bye if needed counts as 24/7 support.

Gotcha

Did the initial dilation go well? I know the Dr has the patient try on their own during that unpacking visit.  I&#39;m just curious if it was always difficult or got progressively worse.

Pain management is real, and I&#39;m sorry for your ordeal, but that&#39;s not on the Dr.  Anyone can talk to their Dr prior to surgery and talk about it.  They&#39;ll tell u when the cut off day is, and it is for a good reason.
</p>
<p>
Sorry you lost depth.  Were you dilating to depth 3x daily as instructed?

<p>
Bullshit. I&#39;m an ex drug addict and I told them before the surgery, and I was still prescribed oxycodone for a longer period than this. I was concerned I&#39;d relapse so I asked them to cut my dosage in half. Still got 4 weeks of pain pills, I actually made my roommate take them away from me around the middle of week 2 because I was worried I&#39;d have an issue. I have a higher pain tolerance than most people, but it was pretty rough for like weeks 2-4. I get that doctors are worried about over prescribing, but if a patient reaches out to tell you they&#39;re in pain, you should prescribe them something, even if it&#39;s a lower dose. Patients can be weened off of opiates if they&#39;re on them over short periods of time.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll add that it&#39;s especially important to prescribe some additional painkillers if the patient is in too much pain to dilate adequately. That&#39;s a no-brainer. How could she expect to have a good result if dilation was too painful to push to depth or for the recommended length of time? Sounds to me like Wittenberg fucked up based on the story that we&#39;re hearing...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so sorry OP. It&#39;s terrible that this happened to you. I hope you can get a revision.

I&#39;ve already said the amount of time is arbitrary.  I never said, 2 weeks is the perfect number, but that there will be a cut off date.  And to talk it out ahead of time.

There are non opioid alternatives.

No one is saying that she should prescribe them indefinitely. Of course, there&#39;s a cut off date! I&#39;m saying that this should be determined on a case by case basis. It shouldn&#39;t be a hard and fast rule that you always cut off a patient after a specific, predetermined amount of time. One important fact of medical care is that everyone experiences pain differently. How was the patient supposed to know ahead of time how much pain she would be in, and for how long?
</p>
<p>
If you can&#39;t adapt your medication plan even after a patient is calling you and telling you that they&#39;re literally unable to dilate because of pain, you&#39;re an asshole. Why are you so intent on blaming the patient for her outcome? She&#39;s not the expert here. The doctor is. She was the one who undertook years of training to be able to administer care to people. Suggest alternatives, try different dosages, prescribe SOMETHING! Find a fucking way to help your patient or you suck as a doctor. If I was pre-op and still considering surgeons, this thread would completely rule out Wittenberg for me.

I have patients who scream their pain is at a 10 when I open the needles, before anything touches them.  There are non opioid alternatives and a very high percentage of the abusers are the ones who say that&#39;s the only thing that works.  And the patient was prescribed those alternatives.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not blaming the patient.  I don&#39;t have enough information at all to make certain judgments.  The claim I&#39;m making is that yes, a doctor can and should make hard cut off dates for opioids.  If that alarms people, do your research ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
SRS is a bitch. Just bc Zoe down the street was on orange week 3 with orgasms, doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t be the one who ends up spending the whole day in pain trying to figure out the angle.  And that will be true with any doctor.

The two weeks is arbitrary. No Dr is going to give opioids indefinitely.  There are also non opioid pain killers which were an option.
</p>
<p>
This is something to discuss prior to surgery.  Pain management is a big part of the plan of care and should have been asked about in the consult.

Nope, I had the same experience with Dr. Wittenberg, she is EXTREMELY conservative with pain medication - I told her I was in a ton of pain and the most she would do was write a script for more Gabapentin (aka useless). I was up to 15+ pills a day of Ibuprofen + Aspirin + Tylenol before I ordered 100g of Kratom. Without that I&#39;m absolutely sure I would&#39;ve ended up with a stomach ulcer

Agreed she seems to love Gabapentin, but I couldn&#39;t take it because it made me depressed. Which isn&#39;t unreasonable since it works on the same brain circuits as alcohol.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
I used Kratom as well! It was the only thing that kept me alive tbh. She told me not to use it. She said she read a study that said combining it with opioids would cause respiratory failure 🙄. She pushed the weed edibles instead, which actually increased my pain. I was concerned about this beforehand bc weed makes me
<em>
more
</em>
sexually sensitive, but she insisted. I tried them post op and it magnified my pain several times over, as I predicted. Which sucked bc I would loved to have been baked for the duration of my recovery.

I&#39;m glad you found something! tbh I do agree with her advice around combining it with opioids though, it&#39;s best to use it as a
<em>
replacement
</em>
for opioids (ie once you run out). That being said, it sounds like you were in some pretty extreme pain, more than what&#39;s supposed to be for this surgery, so that&#39;s understandable. Marijuana helped for me but not that much to be honest, it just made my brain hazy more than actually relieving anything

I disagree entirely. Most people don&#39;t have severe longer term pain so most are not aware its a possibility and so won&#39;t discuss it. And then if doctors says they are conservative on painkillers how many people are not going to have surgery or find another surgeon? Not many.
</p>
<p>
Some doctors definitely do prescribe painkillers long term. This YouTube video is from a women who had surgery in Thailand on returning to Australia had incredibly painful recovery. She was on a high dosage of opiates for months and the doctor told her she&#39;s be addicted if she took took it (but she wasn&#39;t).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgCeISjvEk" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgCeISjvEk
</a>
</p>
<p>
The women in the Suporn PDF was on tramadol for around 5 or 6 months, and its handed out to everyone for a month in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not a high risk, but the thought of being in severe pain and not getting treatment really scares me, and I didn&#39;t realize it was a possibility for a very long time.

I had to recover from ffs without single narcotic.  It was their version of Advil after the anesthesia wore off.  Was my surgeon right? Is the 5-6 months of tramadol from supporn right?
</p>
<p>
Again, I&#39;m not debating that.  What&#39;s the perfect amount.  I&#39;m saying talk it out with your Dr, realize there will be a point where opioids are cut off, and there are other pain management solutions.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a big difference between, this Dr has a conservative pain management plan, and this Dr fucked up my vagina.  Anybody who did five minutes of research into SRS would know dilating is going to suck, physically and emotionally.  And if you want a functional vagina you have to commit to doing that.

<p>
Anybody who did five minutes of research into SRS would know dilating is going to suck, physically and emotionally. And if you want a functional vagina you have to commit to doing that.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;ve done a lot more than 5 minutes research and I don&#39;t think you understand the pain and suffering some women go though. I met a young women who was still suffering through intensely painful dilation a year after surgery and was finally looking forward to get a revision to fix it. She broke down in tears talking about it. It was really hard to listen to and I can&#39;t begin to understand how she lasted weeks let alone a year.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard much much worse than that as well. For some people, at some point, the only alternatives are either opiates or giving up.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There&#39;s a big difference between, this Dr has a conservative pain management plan, and this Dr fucked up my vagina.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When doctors refuse to give you painkillers and you can&#39;t dilate properly then yes, its the Dr fucked up. It&#39;s the surgeon if you&#39;re still in their care or your own local doctor once you&#39;re home. Perhaps they saved you from addiction, but you should be offered you the choice. More likely they are lacking in empathy and/or don&#39;t want the liability.
</p>
<p>
Its hard to imagine whats it like to finally get your surgery and then it turns to shit and your doctors don&#39;t support you. Some women have psychological trauma leaving them in fear of further surgery, and they may not be able to afford it anyway. I&#39;ve been there some something else and its a horrifying situation to be in.
</p>
<p>
In that YouTube video she was told by her doctor she would be physically dependent on opiates if she took them, and it was her choice to do so. The end result was successful, so yes, it was the correct decision. Five months of high levels of opiates, not 2 weeks. The alternative was clearly going to be a totally failed surgery with no depth, or suicide by the sound of it. Its not something you can tough out, and no amount of  knowing ahead of time that dilating is going to suck can help. Its far far beyond that.
</p>
<p>
The 5-6 months of Tramadol was also the right decision if your read that pdf. It all worked out with no issues and excellent results. Obviously Suporn doesn&#39;t prescribe that long, only 4-6 weeks or so. It would be her doctor at home after that.
</p>
<p>
Most people are unaware of the possible bad complications of surgery and it will probably never matter as they are relatively rare. Being rational, you don&#39;t turn down surgery because of something so unlikely. However, not being supported by doctors when things do go wrong is absolutely unacceptable. I find this behavior a huge red flag - not only does it increase the risk of failed surgery, it also raises questions about the ethics of the doctors involved.

Again, she was given alternatives to opioids. The doctor had a sound plan of care, the patient was not satisfied.  It happens.
</p>
<p>
Your sample size of one does not impress me.  But if it matters so much, maybe more people should go to Thailand and not here.  I haven&#39;t been advocating for any Dr, just for people to be responsible in chosing their surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I do applaud the Drs ethics in this case bc opioid addiction is permanent, the pain is not.  I can guess how you feel about it, so we don&#39;t need to have a back and forth about it.
</p>
<p>
A large number of trans women will always have something to be crying about.  It&#39;s what they do, and opioids won&#39;t fix that.  It&#39;s probably better you&#39;re there for them and not me.  I&#39;m definitely not looking forward to my psych rotation.

I&#39;m already there.  You don&#39;t know anything about me or the level of care I provide my patients.  You won&#39;t find a more empathetic nurse, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not fully aware of how stupid, selfish, and plain crazy patients can be.
</p>
<p>
Empathy doesn&#39;t shut off reality for me.  But I&#39;ve seen the type who think it matters most.  They&#39;re usually too weak to be much help.

As a neuroscientist and therapist with more school and experience than you by far, I&#39;ll say this reply speaks for itself. I&#39;m sorry that your school and mentors failed to teach you true empathy. I&#39;m also sorry they taught you to blame patients and call them crazy. Empathy isn&#39;t weakness, it&#39;s strength, and it takes more strength than to blame people and make situations black and white. I hope you find a better path someday.

There were some rly good responses farther down by 2 past patients of Dr. Wittenberg who posted about depth loss. They came up with a solution on their own, without help from medical professionals. It&#39;s a great example of how medicine doesn&#39;t always have the right answer. In this case, our own community found a viable solution faster than the surgeons, and way faster than medical research.  Their posts both validate what I&#39;m going through and show the limited scope of medicine. Medicine is great, but it&#39;s best when combined with patient and community input. Pitting patient and doctor against eachother is just not as effective as working together.
</p>
<p>
Also, their responses show that I&#39;m not doing something wrong. What I&#39;m experiencing with depth  was actually me just not being given good instructions. That&#39;s not 100% the doctor&#39;s fault, as this is a new procedure, but it goes against your hypothesis that I&#39;m just some crazy simpleton who can&#39;t follow instructions.

I have the impression from what you’ve said that you’ve seen so much of it that you’re extending it to everyone. I don’t really know what you’re like, but I have met medical people like that in real life and for far longer than this short conversation, and I’d stay well away from then wherever possible. We’re not all crazy, and I’m certainly not.

I know a lot more than this, but I don&#39;t want to spend the time looking them up and others I can&#39;t repeat.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had really mixed experiences with doctors and as a result I&#39;m not very tolerant towards such things and don&#39;t have much respect for the average doctor. Some a great, but others have put my life at risk. Obviously you don&#39;t know me or if that&#39;s really correct or not, but I assume you can tell I&#39;m not ignorant or an idiot. I also assume you can agree there&#39;s bad doctors around that harm people, and the medical system often ignores it. You can see it very clearly in the wiki.
</p>
<p>
As a society we have this idealistic view of the medical profession, but I find the medical system as a whole is somewhat abusive towards its own members. I have the impression that its partly because of this that some of these problems arise - it grinds doctors down until they can&#39;t see patients as individuals. I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve never been though that.

That&#39;s probably why we disagree.  I work in the medical field, and I see unhappy patients every day.  And I know medically, they were given the best possible care.  They&#39;ll never understand that.
</p>
<p>
Did the OP individually receive the best medical care? That&#39;s a different question, and I can&#39;t answer that.  But I do support Wittenberg&#39;s POC and feel this is something to resolve in the consult.
</p>
<p>
SRS is a difficult surgery, yet has extremely high satisfaction rates.  When a patient is not satisfied, it seems easy to say, do this or that, but from the medical team&#39;s point of view, it&#39;s not possible except in hindsight.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not that doctors don&#39;t care, most do.  When you have to justify your decisions to the board or a family, you&#39;re either explaining how you followed standard procedure given the situation, or how you decided to go against it.  You can tell which one will cost your career, and which one is more acceptable to the audience.
</p>
<p>
I had a patient die going AMA.  We grant as much choice as we can to the patient.  But I haven&#39;t seen a patient lost bc of a treatment, only despite it, or without it.  And I will always look at these scenarios that way.

The issue with opiates is that if the patient gets addicted its the doctors fault, and it they don&#39;t dilate its their fault. Easy decision.
</p>
<p>
Its a devastating issue for most people if their surgery fails and sure, so is addiciton, but (this) doctor is making that choice for their patient. They are not allowing the patient to choose for themselves. I&#39;m a big believer in informed consent, and I find that unethical. You can&#39;t make the right choices for everyone, as you can&#39;t stop (and shouldn&#39;t) someone going AMA, but the difference is autonomy, consent and ethics. You (the doctor) cannot make the right choice for me.
</p>
<p>
We had a somewhat similar situation in Australia last year with an endo retiring and his 4000 trans patients having to find new doctors for HRT. He prescribed high levels of estrogen and other doctors refused to prescribe that on safety grounds, and that its not within the usual guidelines. Sounds all ok, except that a few women had severe psychological problems as their levels dropped, in some cases becoming suicidal. So we had well known HRT doctors refused to help until their levels dropped even further, while they were at risk of suicide or wrecking their lives though depression, job loss, etc. No problem, the doctors are not going to get into trouble as its not their patients and not their fault. They were following guidelines.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me the the stories I&#39;ve read from the USA of patients in chronic pain who kill themselves when they get cutoff from painkillers. I understand why its happening, and that the doctors are in a difficult position, but I don&#39;t like being on the receiving end of that kind of treatment.
</p>
<p>
Its unfortunate, but I&#39;ve become very careful to protect myself from the medical profession. I spend a lot of time evaluating risks and ways to work around things in case I need to.

This is bullshit. When I was a nurse, pain management was absolutely the doc’s responsibility. Patients are not medically savvy, nor do they need ton be. There is nobody else that is responsible for pain management. Patients trust doctors not to screw them.
</p>
<p>
This is the second doc I’ve seen that is cutting pain management (Dr. Ley being the other) to extremes. 2 weeks post op for such a big surgery? That’s not unreasonable to still be on pain medication.  This is certainly due to the current climate surrounding opioid medications. While we do have to be careful with that class of medications, iirc the studies I read show post surgical usage does not increase addiction. I’m quite a few years past active nursing though.
</p>
<p>
Yes there are non-narcotic options but to yank it all is absolutely awful and not standard practice. There is no reason to put a patient through that kind of pain.

The patient was already AMA prior to the medication being cut off.  Whether that had been made known to the medical team at that point, I&#39;m not sure.  I think I could understand not giving opioids to non compliant patients, though.

If you ask Dr Wittenberg in the consult, she will tell u two weeks.  Nobody got duped.  If you, the patient, aren&#39;t ok with a strict doctor, go elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also in healthcare.  Conservative plans  make sense.  There are non opioid solutions. People who disagree should find an alternative provider.

Legit asking, how does the back narrow up in 8 hours?  Bc if you go to depth 3x daily... That seems crazy soon to no longer be able to push past.
</p>
<p>
Afaik there&#39;s a major appointment where the Dr will show the pt the original depth.  And patients are to go to that depth, every time, for the given time, as scheduled.
</p>
<p>
If it still narrows after that, something is really wrong.  But I have heard many people say they want PPT bc they don&#39;t want to dilate as much and I don&#39;t know a Dr who&#39;s saying that&#39;s how it works

I don&#39;t wanna be an asshole but going into surgery with that expectation is well - not the best idea. Going in with any expectation if you ask me. The surgery is meant to kill body dysphoria in the first place that is the point. Consider the &#34;it works&#34; a bonus. And yes the pain is pure torture.

<p>
I feel sorry for you, that is definitely not what you deserved.

<p>
You could eventually fix it up. There are techniques that use part of the colon to give you enough depth and it should be pretty good in general. The labias can be fixed in a revision.

Bad idea really. There&#39;s a chance things can go wrong and if you are not sure if you can deal with it if that happens you might reconsider it for your own sake.
</p>

Thinking short term can bite you in the ass.

Sure I do feel sorry when these things happen but it is what it is and life goes on. All we can do is make the best out of it.
