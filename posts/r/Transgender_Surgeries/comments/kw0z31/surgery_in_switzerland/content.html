So I had a look at the Swiss surgeons for GRS, but neither of them seem...good, there&#39;s only a handful of &#34;reviews&#34; I&#39;ve been able to find, and they&#39;re all negative and I&#39;m very scared to go with this procedure, does someone have any advice? A different surgeon who would be covered by insurance? Anecdotes of people who&#39;ve had good experiences? I&#39;m at a total loss...
</p>
<p>
Edit 1: Indicated that it&#39;s for GRS surgery
</p>
<p>
Edit 2: Turns out I might be eligible for the NHS healthcare
<a href="https://www.expatnetwork.com/uk-citizen-living-abroad-can-i-get-free-nhs-healthcare-when-visiting-the-uk/">https://www.expatnetwork.com/uk-citizen-living-abroad-can-i-get-free-nhs-healthcare-when-visiting-the-uk/
</a>
I have a British passport, my primary passport, and I believe I have such an insurance card
</p>
<p>
Edit 3: Turns out this is false...back to square one yay
</p>
<p>
Edit 4: I did it! Almost 2 years ago actually, I wrnt with Dr. Paul Daverio and his team in Zug, the work has been amazing, the only &#34;issue&#34; is that my urethral tube kinda...sticks out, but it doesn&#39;t bother me one bit

I&#39;m getting sigmoid colon vaginoplasty on September 9th with Dr. Waldner at University Hospital of Zurich in combination with Dr. Turina and his people from the visceral surgery team for the colon operation. Basically that team and the plastic surgery team will be workig together on me. Dr. turina has a really good reputation and he is one of the best visceral surgeons out there. And Dr Waldner just knows his stuff so well. They have the best results I have seen so far, like ever. The sigmoid colon technique looks so natural i was shocked when he showed me pictures. He is truly an Artist and i can&#39;t wait for surgery with him. All of my friends who went with them for sigmoid colon vaginoplasty are happy. I will post updates of course on my account in case you are still interested in the topic. The only problem i&#39;m experiencing so far is that University Hospital of Zurich is very disorganized and the administration people don&#39;t know what theyre doing, so the planning stage of the surgery so far has been complicated and my surgery date got postponed two times already... but yeah other than that its really good and I can&#39;t wait.

How does that Vaginoplasty differ from penile inversion?

Well basically it&#39;s a bigger operation... they use part of your sigmoid colon to make the vaginal canal instead of just inverting the penile skin. That way you get a fully self lubricating, self cleaning and also completely hairless vaginal canal and you get way more depth than with inversion. With sigmoid colon, pre op size of the genitals does not matter, they can use as much colon as you ask so you can pretty much decide how much depth you want. But there is also more risks involved with this surgical technique, but i fully trust the surgeons and i&#39;ve only heard good things about the team at USZ (University Hospital of Zurich)

Hi, This is Isabelle.My son is turning 17 this year and is transmale.We live in Melbourne.I&#39;m Swiss and I&#39;m looking at surgeons in Switzerland,who do trans surgeries.I found Dr.Daverio and his team who offer an All-in-One Surgery,basically a 9 hour surgery,which includes Top- and Bottom Surgery.He operates in 3 locations,Zug(Switzerland),Berlin(Germany) and in Italy.His Web page s very informative,worth looking into it. My son is very keen ,but he is not 18 yet. I understand that trans surgeries in Switzerland are covered by health care? Is that so?  Let me know please,what you think about that AIO procedure by Dr.Daverio and if you would consider it. Thank you, Isabelle

<p>
So, I did go with Dr. Daverio and his team, and it was excellent, the results are amazing
<br>
I didn&#39;t got for the AIO option, I only went for the lower surgery, but I am considering going back for some additional work at some point
<br>
My insurance, Assura, paid almost everything, we had to pay around 700 francs for some medication and other stuff, but the costs of the whole thing was around 15 thousand, so definitely worth the 700
<br>
As your son is transmale, I think that the AIO surgery would be better than doing things on at a time, the hospital stay will be absolutely miserable, but completely worth it in my opinion
</p>
<p>
If you have additional questions, I&#39;m mostly always available to answer, and if your son uses something like discord, he can talk to me directly, my username is KitsuneNoNatsu

Sure GRS, Breast Augmentation are basic health care. Also tracheal shave and FFS are paid depending on how necessary it is

It&#39;s so scary, genuinely have no idea who to go with and what surgeries to go with, I heard of the sigmoid colon surgery being done in switzerland, I&#39;m tempted, but there&#39;s not enough positive data for me to make a &#34;safe&#34; choice

Sadly in Europe we only have 2 safe and good options. That&#39;s FT in Spain and Christopher Inglefield in London. FFS was not pioneered in Europe but in the US and that&#39;s why in the US you have Mayer, Rolfes, Mardirossian, Braly, Salterwhite, Sinclair, Keojompa, Harrison Lee etc as options for FFS and they accept certain insurances like Starbucks, Microsoft etc. Another problem we have is that butchers like Bart Van de Ven and Noorman Van Der Dussen target the trans community offering &#34;cheaper&#34; and cookie cutter surgery that will cost you more money and a life. Reality is you&#39;ll have to save.

Well if I have to pay, why not go with Dr. Brassard? I&#39;ve had everyone recommend him to be if &#34;you can afford it&#34;
<br>
But I&#39;d much rather have an insured option, is there absolutely nothing I can do

I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t really want SRS so never looked into it much. I read mixed reviews with Brassard but Inglefield I haven&#39;t heard anything negative. Here in the UK elective procedures are not covered by insurance either. GRS is covered by the NHS though with NHS GRS surgeons. Wish I can give better advice I&#39;m sorry ðŸ˜”
