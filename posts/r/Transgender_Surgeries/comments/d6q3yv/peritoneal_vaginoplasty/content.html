I’m considering this surgery and was hoping to hear experiences and cost. How well does it self lube itself and how does it feel for sex. Thank you if you can answer I’m honestly considering getting this next year and I’ll appreciate any advice.

This is actually not a new surgery at all. They have been doing it since the 80s on cis women. It’s a fairly new procedure when being combined with a penile inversion technique. The main benefit to a peritoneal flap is the prevention of a prolapse, making your canal depth virtually nothing. The peritoneal flap will act like an anchor, holding the end or “tip” of the canal in place and in turn adding a bit more depth. The flap also self lubricates but it is still highly recommended to use external lube during intercourse. You still need to dilate using this method.
</p>
<p>
Insurance will cover this procedure.
</p>
<p>
I got my mine done with Dr Bluebond-Langner and Dr Lee Zhou at NYU Langone. This information was given to me by Dr. Zhou, who is the urologist and performs the peritoneal graft using robotics.

It needs to be pointed out that neovaginal prolapse is
<em>
extremely
</em>
rare, and not something anyone should expect. The end of the vaginal canal is still anchored with regular PI, so the chances of it happening to anyone are vanishingly small.

It&#39;s still really new, so I&#39;m not sure many people have had it for over a year.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also not sure it&#39;s an option if using insurance.  Like, there would have to be a medical need like lack of donor tissue or something wrong with the first procedure.

I could be wrong, but if expect someone to correct me if so.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d also like to have it and will be asking my surgeon next week.

Fortunately you are wrong, lol. I have gotten it myself and know many people that have as well. No issues with insurance with any of the surgeons in NYC. That is unless you have state insurance and trying to go out of state, that is an issue with any procedure and surgeon.

just an fyi that bluebond-langners method isn&#39;t strictly the peritoneal method. Its a hybrid approach (much more so than the &#34;canonical&#34; peritoneal method). Its the best of both worlds. But i do think the distinction is important especially on subs/posts like this one.

The method used at Sinai is also not truly PPT, they have two different peritoneal methods and the one they prefer if you have adequate donor material has all the benefits of PI with scrotal graft and about 95% of the benefits of PPT without the potential drawbacks such as a more fragile vagina

That&#39;s actually good bc I was hoping to have it myself.  I&#39;ll find out more when I see my surgeon next week.  Maybe it&#39;s different in NY, but I was told you needed a medical reason to have it and not just the standard inversion.

Are you going to wittenberg? She does the &#34;canonical&#34; peritoneal pull through but only on second surgeries, penile preservation surgeries, etc. She might let you do it if you push really hard, but I&#39;d seriously caution against it. There are some major major downsides to the &#34;canonical&#34; approach.
</p>
<p>
The reason why im saying this is because she is the only surgeon in the us that I know of that offers peritoneal but does not offer it as a first pass. (though of course, my knowledge of surgeons in the usa who offer this procedure is not exhaustive).
</p>
<p>
Mt Sinai, Bluebond-langner, and Bowers all offer hybrid approaches as a first pass.

Yes, forking brilliant of you.
</p>
<p>
Quick rundown of canonical?
</p>
<p>
I think Bowers takes my insurance, just, got excited for Wittenberg.  Ty!

Essentially penile/scrotal tissue is only used in creating the vulva and possibly a tiny bit of the entrance to the vaginal canal. This mimics mrkh women who have a similar procedure performed to lengthen the vaginal canal.
</p>
<p>
The remaining procedure is virtually indistinguishable from the dadydov procedure. I think wittenberg has a rundown of it on her site. This means that the vaginal canal is mostly composed of tissue harvested from the peritoneal membrane.
</p>
<p>
Where the hybrid approaches differ are in a few areas (they differ from each other a tiny bit too). But they all include only partial inclusion of peritoneal tissue for the majority of the depth of the canal. For example, bluebond-langner uses it for the back part and as an anchor. Its just enough that the tissue is believed to cause metaplasia in the surrounding tissue to get the &#34;correct epithelium&#34;. But not enough to cause issues with tearing, always on lubrication, etc.
</p>
<p>
I do want to say that wittenberg by all accounts is a wonderful surgeon and one of the biggest advantages is you can see her quick. (3-6 months from consult to surgery iirc). As opposed to 2-4 years for bowers/bluebond-langner; I&#39;ve heard mt sinai is a bit more manageable (1.5 years-2years).
</p>
<p>
But if you really want to have the peritoneal method, I&#39;d opt for one of the surgeons in the us that can provide a hybrid approach for first pass. Its worth the wait imo, but it might not be for you. It just depends on your goals, etc.

Wow, thanks.  And that&#39;s a lot to consider.  It&#39;s definitely what I would want but yeah, 2-4 years seems... Impossible.  Like, almost enough to make me have a breakdown.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ve been such a great help, thank you!

I live in Nevada near Wittenberg I think most likely she will be my doctor. February 6 is my one year I plan to call right away lol so that I could get the surgery. Thank you sooo sooo much :))
