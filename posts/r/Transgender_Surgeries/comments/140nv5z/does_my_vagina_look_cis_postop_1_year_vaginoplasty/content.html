thank you all so much. I went to Dr. Belanger in Montreal. I thought about going for a revision but maybe I won&#39;t after hearing such nice comments and I am still functional.

Did you talk to them about getting a revision yet? I&#39;m curious for future me in case I&#39;m considering the same thing. From what I&#39;ve heard, it doesn&#39;t sound like revisions are as easy to access in Canada as they should be and are only reserved for &#34;medically necessary&#34; things and not &#34;aesthetics&#34;. I&#39;d love to hear if access was getting easier though!
</p>
<p>
Also for the record I think your vagina looks amazing!! I&#39;d be very happy with a result like yours. :) But it&#39;s also totally valid if you feel like you want a revision, after all we&#39;re all just trying to feel more comfortable in our bodies. ^^

Mostly, but the lack of labia minora is what would clock you. The clitoris is also a little harder to make out imo.

really? the clitoris is very easy to spot imo. easier than most results I&#39;ve seen. I was actually worried it was too noticeable and thought about getting a more pronounced clitoral hood.

I&#39;ll be honest, I think I can see the clit, but typically the hood set up looks a little different so I&#39;m not sure. Clits are also normally at the top right beneath the hood but in this case it looks a few millimeters down.

This is why we have a word for it. So, Yes, they do. There are variations on the theme however. It doesn&#39;t always mean 100% detachment  or under the radar. It used to be a lot easier to do. It not easy and comes with plenty of baggage these days.

I’ve been stealth since my surgery 7 years ago. It’s emotionally difficult above all else, but I feel purposeful and true to my beliefs and reasons as to why.

it definitely looks like a vagina, and you should be really happy with your results - i know I and a lot of us would be. you should drop the cis aspect because you’re just going to drive yourself insane as that will become a new focal point - and what benefit would it bring? if we all said no, what could you logically do about it? except shell out thousands for another surgery for a perfectly fine vagina.

I know that our vaginas can look different than cis vaginas. But I feel like even a cis woman&#39;s vagina could be &#34;clickable&#34;. I feel like us as trans women and a community, to define when a vagina looks cis, just harms us and creates these insecurities in us with our vaginas. Your vagina is beautiful! It doesn&#39;t look cis or trans, it just looks like your beautiful vagina!!

I understand the sentiment. But you&#39;re completely ignoring the physical safety aspect of cis passing here.

<p>
This line in particular I find challenging to read. Like you&#39;re scolding other trans women for causing &#34;harm&#34; by having passing as an objective. No one should be judged for wanting to pass, or worse not wanting to become a statistic.

I&#39;m not judging or scolding anybody, or ignoring the safety aspect of passing. You have no, fucking, idea, the things I go through, or the experiences I have that differ when I pass and when I don&#39;t. So explaining that I&#39;m shaming or scolding someone for wanting to pass, is an extremely bold and ignorant statement. I&#39;m just saying, do you think any one night stand is going to notice slight differences to a vagina? No, because all vaginas are different. This doesn&#39;t just apply to just trans women, this applies to cis women too. Let&#39;s take trans women out of the picture right, the culture of &#34;some vaginas look weird&#34; is still very present, and makes A LOT of cis girls very insecure about their vagina. So now along with that, we also are trying to define what&#39;s cisnormative, instead of just seeing every vagina as beautiful. Cis or trans, ALL vaginas are different.

Post-op trans women have definitely been clocked by men in the middle of sex based on their genitalia.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s not just something I think—it&#39;s a factual statement based on many first hand accounts. It doesn&#39;t need to happen to everyone, or even most, in order for it to still be the experience of some people.
</p>
<p>
It is harmful to ignore or minimize those accounts simply because they are uncomfortable for you to grapple with.
</p>
<p>
Repeating that all vaginas are different and beautiful is sort of beside the point. I don&#39;t disagree with that. You can say that without taking shots at people for finding it important to ask or assess whether their surgical results pass.

Ya know what, you win. Thank you for your aggressive, ignorant, and incompetent comments exclaiming things like you know it all, and also know my life and the things I&#39;ve been through from not passing. I don&#39;t care enough to try and persuade you into a different way of thinking. Go ahead and keep telling trans women their vagina is clocky in some form. I&#39;ll make sure to dm you a picture of mine to ask if it looks fake or not. Have a great day

No. I have not seen a single neo vulva where the clitoral hood, clitoris and labia minora look like they do for cis women. That said plenty of neo vulvas look pretty and all I&#39;ve seen look „within the natural variation“, even though there are details distinct from cis vulvas. Furthermore most people will not be able to spot or clock a neo vulva based on these details, since they haven&#39;t looked closely at a lot of neo vulvas and possibly not a lot of cis vulvas either.

Excellent post.  I think some folks think they are going to get srs results that are indistinguishable from natal.  No current surgeon has that ability to recreate that on every unique body, and when you consider all of the variables it is not surprising.  You pick a surgeon who will keep you safe and give you the best possible results considering your unique body.  These days most competent surgeons can get us in the ballpark of natal, keep us safe, and that is amazing progress from the results of even the 1970s.

Exactly. Also, having a result that can pass in the context of sex is not the same as having a result that is indistinguishable from a natal vulva. Mine falls in this category, and I&#39;m really grateful for what my surgeon was able to achieve. I think we can gain a lot by appreciating SRS for what it is while acknowledging its realities.

I wanna ask a question, i look forward to have srs too but kinda scared of surgery and afterwards. Do you feel aroused when you touch your genitalia more? I saw on the videos that in order to make clitoris they actually use the head of penis but in a small amount so I wonder it

Wow, so glad to hear it’s Dr. Belanger. Beautiful. I live 20 minutes away from GRS Montreal. I was going to go with Brassard but you have me doubting. Do you think Belanger is better? She is known to have issue with the urethra where girls pee everywhere. Do you have that issue. Anyways, beautiful 🤩🫶

Long-term issues or in the first year of healing? I went to Belanger and I had a lot of trouble peeing, but only for the first year. 2.5 years out it&#39;s not a problem at all.

I have a natal vagina. Yes, it looks cis. I didn&#39;t even notice the scars at first either, and I don&#39;t think those are a giveaway at all (somebody asks? you had a horrible shaving accident)

As A lesbian, my first thought was, &#34;I want to bury my face in there!&#34; So... I&#39;d say that you&#39;re good to go.

As a trans woman, I&#39;d say...&#34;what did you get done, and where? I wanna follow your lead!&#34;

Yes! It looks more cis then a lot of cis women. It&#39;s clean and neat looking and very pretty. I promise, you have nothing to be shy over. You can live stealth with no issues.

Rule 5. This sub is by and for trans people. Partners, carers, etc, with a legitimate interest in surgery may post if its of clear benefit to a trans individual or the community. Intersex people who have related surgical interests may post. Do not post otherwise. People that only or primarily post compliments on this and other trans subs are likely to be banned. If you&#39;re not sure, ask first.
