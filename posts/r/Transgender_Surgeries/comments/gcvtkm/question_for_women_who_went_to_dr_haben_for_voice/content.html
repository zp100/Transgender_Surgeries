I don&#39;t really care if I can&#39;t sing but what do you mean short term? Is it not permanent?

I went to Haben and I can’t recommend him. I have a bitonal “witch” voice in the upper range and my normal range is mostly unchanged from before. I chose Haben over Thomas because I was impatient and I regret it. Wait for Thomas.

Already have the triple with Haben scheduled... I&#39;m pretty dead set on surgery too. I want permanent results and low risk. Do you have recommendations?

My parameters were 1) In the US (Rules out Yeson) 2) Can get it this year (rules out Thomas) 3) Specializes in voice surgeries [rules out Mardirossian (my ffs surgeon)]

Have you had any consultations?  I am curious about spiegel&#39;s as it seems maybe the same as Yeson, but in the U.S.

I was told by other people who had the surgery to only go to &#34;The Big Three&#34; aka Yeson, Thomas, or Haben bc they all specialize. I tend to agree with them bc voice surgery is very risky. A not insignificant amount of women do not see their desired results, a small amount of women get no change, and a few women can permanently lose their voice. This is subject to change per surgery. Its also very expensive and id prefer to not need revisions.
</p>
<p>
I havent had any consults because to Haben only does in person consults and i don&#39;t have the time or money to fly to NY for only a single day. Most people who go to Haben schedule their surgery before they even have a consult.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Spiegel is somewhat controversial bc he doesn&#39;t specialize, he&#39;s expensive, and some clients feel he&#39;s only in it for the money, not out of a sense of passion for medicine. I haven&#39;t gone to Spiegel for anything so I can&#39;t confirm or deny. My only advice is- don&#39;t trust someone just because they have good results on their site (those are for advertising), find reviews of him elsewhere. Reddit has been immensely helpful for me.

I just had the minimally invasive surgery with Haben a couple days ago May 27th 2020.  Obviously too soon to talk about any results as I&#39;m currently in the omg stitches please don&#39;t break voice rest stage but so far my experience with Dr Haben has been great. He has been very upfront and honest about potential results and is very respectful. Luckily I only live an hour from his office but once I can start speaking again I will try to give updates.

Ive gone through months of voice training and I don&#39;t enjoy having to manually modify my voice and not even passing as a result. I&#39;m dead set on surgery

Why does it have to be in the US? Even factoring in travel and 10 days in Seoul, my total cost going to Yeson was comparable if not less than going with a US surgeon.

Traveling internationally as a trans person is scary. Especially if you&#39;re less passing and not going with a partner or very trusted friend.
</p>
<p>
Idk if this is the reason for op, but I imagine a lot of trans people feel nervous about the prosoect of international travel

That’s reasonable. In this specific instance I’d offer that I’ve never felt safer than the time I spent in Seoul. From a risk standpoint I’ve felt way more nervous in mid-sized “safe” American cities than I did there, even as a not very passing trans person at that point in my transition. There just isn’t the same vitriol there that we’ve had to put up with in the US. I’d also offer that Yeson offered the same level of medical care as you’d expect in any high end clinic in the US or Europe. I offer this info not to discount the US providers, but rather to make sure that a solid choice isn’t being discounted because of logistical concerns.
