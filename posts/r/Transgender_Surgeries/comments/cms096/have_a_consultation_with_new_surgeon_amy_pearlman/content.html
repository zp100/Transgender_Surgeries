The University of Iowa sent her to train at Mount Sinai and now she&#39;s doing GCS back in Iowa. If anyone knows anything about her I would love to hear it; otherwise I will report back with my impressions.

Whoa that‚Äôs crazy! I am from Iowa and am in Mt. Sinai recovering from surgery yesterday. Mt. Sinai is phenomenal and am so glad Iowa is getting a surgeon that has trained there. Congrats on the consult ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I know Dr Pearlman, she did my orchiectomy at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. There were actually two surgical teams. One did facial feminization surgery, and Amy&#39;s team did the orchiectomy. I was very happy with the results of both operations. It was the first time these two operations were done at one time at the University of Iowa hospitals anyway. And it was done as an outpatient procedure believe it or not. I know they want to begin vagio plasty type bottom surgery soon. I&#39;m seriously considering a zero-depth vagio plasty I&#39;m in the Iowa City area if you want to contact me

She JUST started offering it and it isn&#39;t on their website yet. But you can call or request an appointment online:
<a href="https://uihc.org/amy-m-pearlman" rel="nofollow">https://uihc.org/amy-m-pearlman</a>
I filled out the online form and they called me back in like 5 minutes. Have your insurance info ready.

Another Iowan here. I am glad they finally have this lined up, and I can get my business taken care of at a world class hospital that&#39;s an hour and a half from my house. Let us know how your procedure goes.
