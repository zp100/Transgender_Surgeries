When you had your consultation, did your surgeon give you pros and cons of the different types of vaginoplasty? If so what did he say?
</p>
<p>
What made you go with ppt? Can you just request it from a surgeon? Assuming they are practiced in it.
</p>
<p>
I know it’s early but do you like the results?

Did you discuss clitoris size prior to surgery? He did mine and I didn’t know at the time, but he creates a rather large “clit” and not much of a hood. The entire area is a source of frequent irritation. The size and positioning is just off. Everything works and I haven’t had any major complications, but the aesthetics just aren’t ideal.

Early on, there was so much swelling that it did look somewhat normal, minus being slanted and off center. After the swelling started going down it started to look   like he left the entire damn penis head there. I can’t wear certain clothes because it irritates that area so much. Everything is healed up and I’m grateful that I didn’t have any major complications, but what I got was not what I was expecting. Yes, I’ve seen some of his other results and spoken with some of his other patients. He isn’t providing consistent results yet. I’m thinking one of the residents there did more of the work on me than he did. He had a plastic surgeon that was working with him at the time, but he backed out shortly before my surgery. I should have taken that as a sign to hold off, but desperation made me go ahead anyway. I’m planning to have a revision next year. I need to have my urethra fixed and see if someone can do something with the rest of what’s still there.

Have you had a full ppv or combined with scrotal graft? And why did you make this choice

I was asking because my doctor said it&#39;s half skin and half or peritoneal (and i guess usually they combine it in this proportion)
