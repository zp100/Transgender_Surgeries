i had vaginoplasty with dr john whitehead with restore medical llc in august 2024.
</p>
<p>
i got a urethrovaginal fistula pretty early but it took almost 2 months to be acknowledged by the surgeon simply because we didnâ€™t know if it was swelling causing the wild urine spray or not but that was what i was told it was. i insisted it was not that and in a follow up appointment my suspicions were confirmed after he saw me pee and it came from the canal. I was catheterized under anesthesia nov 4th and couldnâ€™t really do much but sit around at home. dec 9th i went in for a follow up and got it taken out but the fistula did not heal. i had the catheter put back in same day not under anesthesia (ouch) and on valentineâ€™s day iâ€™ll go back and have it taken out so weâ€™ll see if it healed by then. if it didnâ€™t i have to have it patched with a urologist or something. not looking forward to that.
</p>
<p>
donâ€™t get urethro-vaginal fistula. catheter is no fun. you have to lug around a bag &amp; not walk too much or youâ€™ll bleed inside or get a UTI which slows healing of the fistula. thereâ€™s no better time to tackle a book collection or become a gamer because you canâ€™t really move or even go to work if itâ€™s not a sit down job. you gotta buy your own bags either leg or night bags but never use the same one twice. itâ€™s a lot to handle right after SRS.

iâ€™ll edit the post in february to say how it went. wish me good fortune i really need it!

Oh, wow. So sorry you are suffering all this. If you are having it repaired by Dr Everett then I assume it never healed on its own.
