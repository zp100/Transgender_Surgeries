Hi all! I just had my 1-month post-op appointment with Dr. Schindler in Portland and I wanted to make a post here to give an outline of what the procedure was like for me. Skip down about halfway if you only care about my surgery and recovery and not my experience with Dr. Schindler in general! images at the bottom as well :)
</p>
<p>
First thing&#39;s first, Dr. Schindler works in the ENT (ear, nose throat) part of OHSU, and is NOT a plastic surgeon by trade. This was important for me when finding a surgeon because i wanted to make sure that I was not sacrificing safety of my voice for more aggressive results.
</p>
<p>
My surgery was on August 18th, and I had my consultation in early June. There seemed to be a much longer line for the consultation than for the surgery, as it seemed they were scheduling at least a month out. My mom went to me to my consultation, and we were both incredibly impressed by how cheerful and sincere Dr. Schindler was. He said that he had performed over 200 tracheal shaves, and that he had never had a complication with regards to vocal cord damage. However, his fellow still recorded a video of my vocal cords to establish a baseline. This was done via spraying numbing spray up a nostril and sending a small camera on a tube down my throat. It was quite unpleasant, but not necessarily painful. For those of you who have had the kind of covid test with a deep swab, it felt quite similar, except less painful, longer, and farther down in your sinuses. The numbing spray lingered for about 30 minutes after. For this period breathing and swallowing felt quite bizarre and shallow, but they assured me this was normal so I was not stressed about it.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Schindler also briefly talked about swelling and scarring. He said both greatly varied by person, and that scars would generally be easier to hide for people who are shorter than I was(I am 5&#39;10). However, as many of you may know, the procedure is typically done laparoscopically, working from a few inches above the actual adam&#39;s apple. So, I wasn&#39;t too worried about the scar, especially if i liberally applied scar cream, etc. I was happy with my consultation so I aimed towards scheduling sometime later that summer. I was told that a scheduler would be in touch within a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
A few weeks later I tentatively scheduled my surgery for August 18th, which I ended up sticking with. The scheduler was difficult to communicate with at times, largely due to my notorious ability to constantly miss phone calls. But eventually we locked down the date once I figured out my work schedule. Also, she asked me what time of the day i preferred, and I requested late morning, which i thankfully received!
</p>
<p>
The more stressful part was scheduling my required covid test 2 days in advance- I live a few hours away, so it didn&#39;t make sense to get tested at OHSU. Also, there are only a few places that OHSU trusted enough to get them the results on time. I strongly recommend getting in touch with the scheduler as soon as possible about what testing sites in your local area are acceptable. Luckily, I managed to set up a last-minute walk in test, but this was a super stressful part that I shouldn&#39;t have procrastinated. do it ASAP!
</p>
<p>
I had a few phone calls leading up to the surgery- just procedural pre-op stuff. Until a couple days before the surgery, I was totally relaxed, but the last couple days I began to have some nervous thoughts, mostly centered around having an IV for an extended period of time, and also the first few hours of recovery.
</p>
<p>
So this brings us to the day of the surgery. The night before, I had received a call asking me to come in at 9:30 instead of 10:30, which was earlier than I would&#39;ve liked, but it was totally fine. Checking in went smoothly, and all the staff was amazing, upbeat, and friendly. I did have to do a urine sample, which i later learned was due to some confused nurses thinking I had a uterus and should take a pregnancy test. The nurse who put in my IV was really great, especially as someone with a lingering fear of needles. I told him about this and he gave me a lidocaine shot at the IV location before he put it in, which was actually more painful than the IV itself. My worries went away pretty quickly once the shot wore off and it didn&#39;t even hurt.
</p>
<p>
However, we just kept waiting and waiting and waiting in the prep room. Eventually my mom got a nurses&#39;s attention and she told us that the schedule said my surgery time had been moved back to 1pm from it&#39;s original time of 11:30 am. So, this basically resulted in me sitting with an IV in for 2.5+ hours before surgery even happened, which was pretty unfortunate. I&#39;m glad they allowed one guest for this procedure because i would&#39;ve been beyond bored without my mom there.
</p>
<p>
Finally, my anesthesiologist came in and told me about what was gonna happen, and I asked for an anti-anxiety drug which they gave me through my IV. Dr. Schindler and his fellow came in and gave me a brief rundown again of what was going to happen and what recovery would be like. The drugs kicked in just as they started to wheel me off and I suddenly felt ridiculously high. I vaguely remember them putting electrodes on me in the ER and putting a mask over my face and the next thing I remember was waking up in the recovery room.
</p>
<p>
I was absolutely starving at this point so once I was lucid enough to eat I basically immediately ate the applesauce they had given me. I remember having a lot of exhaustion and a fair bit of pain and immobilization in my neck, probably about a 4 or so. Eventually, I got wheeled back to the car and my parents drove me home. About five minutes into the drive I felt incredibly nauseous and almost threw up, but i managed to just barely overcome it and it never really resurfaced. In retrospect, I was still incredibly loopy from the pain drugs they were giving me through the IV. The pain on the drive home felt quite manageable, especially with my head supported and stationary.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Schindler had previously described the pain as a &#34;bad sore throat&#34;, but I don&#39;t think this really captures how it feels. My throat really only felt very sore when I swallowed. The vast majority of the pain for me, especially early on, was an acute muscle and skin pain, almost as if I had pulled every muscle in the front of my neck. This resulted in me keeping my head angled down as much as possible. It felt as though angling my head higher would rip the skin, even though I know that makes no logical sense. In any case, tilting my head too far up was sharply painful, so I tried to avoid it. I was super cautious the first few days and just took it easy and ate soft foods. There was no mandatory liquid diet- the guideline was essentially &#34;eat whatever feels comfortable.&#34; I ate soft foods for about 3 days before slowly phasing in things like pasta and rice. My diet was basically back to normal on day 5-6.
</p>
<p>
The day after surgery was definitely the peak of the pain and swelling, though most of my bruising was pretty minimal. Honestly, this day was really a struggle and I felt a plateau after it as well. Recovery was more difficult than I expected, but also in an entirely different way due to the relative lack of sore throat. Dr. Schindler had told my parents that he was particularly aggressive with my surgery because my younger (i&#39;m 19) cartilage was much easier to shave away. I think this probably accounts for a lot of my increased muscle pain compared to other accounts I&#39;ve seen online. However, there was a sudden point around a week where I felt essentially back to normal, and it happened shockingly quickly without me realizing it.
</p>
<p>
Once I could bear to touch the area, I started icing it every hour or two. This GREATLY helped, so I recommend doing it as often as you can. It enabled much great range of motion in my head without pain. Starting on day 4 or so, I found that I could move my head around without fear of it suddenly hurting. I did end up taking all of the pain meds they prescribed, but towards the end I started splitting them in half to avoid front-loading it. I found sleeping very easy, especially after the first night. The first night I woke up at 4am or so to have a snack and take pain meds. I just took melatonin every night and that made falling asleep on my back (which i don&#39;t normally do) manageable.
</p>
<p>
In terms of voice, I could speak fairly okay the first day, but the next three days I could barely speak in more than a whisper without my voice cracking. After a week it was basically back to normal, though, and i&#39;ve had zero lasting effects.
</p>
<p>
My incision was sealed entirely by internal dissolvable stitches, and medical superglue put over the incision itself. This peeled off when it was supposed to, around 2 weeks after surgery. I began showering 2 days after surgery, though, and was just careful to not directly spray the incision for a few weeks and avoid any scrubbing.
</p>
<p>
After 2 weeks my incision was entirely ignorable. The last of any pain whatsoever was a few days before then. At my post-op appointment a month after, Dr. Schindler said he was happy with my healing and that eventually it will fade into a thin white line. They numbed my nose again, but didn&#39;t end up using the vocal cord camera again because my healing and voice were doing so well.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d definitely recommend Dr. Schindler if you live in Oregon, and i&#39;d also recommend this procedure in general! However, know that even though it&#39;s a relatively minor surgery, it&#39;s still surgery, and you should be prepared to factor in about a week of recovery time, with a great deal of discomfort. let me know of any question you have and i&#39;d be glad to answer them, if there&#39;s anything I&#39;ve missed! i hope this was of some use to some of you :)

Thanks for sharing your great results and detailed review fellow portlander. I guess the wait time for this is much smaller out here than I thought too!

hi- sorry for the late reply, I don&#39;t check my account often. Absolutely no voice changes/complications, everything was back to normal within a couple weeks. I believe my insurance was billed for around $4k, though I don&#39;t have the paperwork on me at the moment. OHSU was in network for me so most of it was covered! That being said, I have been having some mixed feelings about my results recently- my adams apple is definitely still there, despite being a huge improvement. As I said originally, I think it&#39;s likely that those more conservative results are a function of Dr. Schindler not being a plastic surgeon. lmk if you have any more questions !!
