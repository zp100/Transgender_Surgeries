The issue with this is that even if you&#39;re legally in the right, you might have to battle it out in court, which costs money. However, defamation is incredibly hard to prove, and has pretty strict guidelines as to what even constitutes it. If all he has on you is a post you made on Reddit about the care he provided, I don&#39;t think he has much of a case. It might even die before a judge who won&#39;t accept the case. But I&#39;m no lawyer, so don&#39;t take anything I saw with too much faith. This is just some of my passing knowledge on the topic.
</p>
<p>
The best you can do is talk to an attorney about it. Consultations are often free, and you may even be able to contact an organization that helps queer people and see if they can help you with a lawyer.
</p>
<p>
Or you could delete it and never talk about your experiences again online, which would blow. Trans people are a marginalized community whose voices are often silenced, so I get how this isn&#39;t a great option.
</p>
<p>
Whether or not either of you did you any wrong is beside the point. A man with any spine whatsoever would be trying to rectify any issues, instead of threatening to sue an underprivileged patient of his. That&#39;s just pure cowardice.
</p>
<p>
And there&#39;s a chance he sees this comment so here&#39;s my message to him: Pull your head out of your ass and behave like an adult. Silencing trans voices is pretty fucking cringe and it makes you no better than the bigots who are working to take away our rights.

To add on to this and why defamation is so notoriously difficult to prove in the US, is that a defamation claim requires a couple of parameters to be met.
</p>
<p>
First, a person has to make a false claim about another person
<br>
Secondly, the person making the claim had to know the claim they were making was false, and there must be evidence that they knew it was false when they made the claim.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, there has to have been damage caused by this defamation and there must be proof of this damage.
</p>
<p>
Chances are that the post did not substantially impact their ability to participate in their practice. I doubt they were getting mass cancellations due to it. Additionally Even if that was the case, the doctor could not prove that that OP was lying, because they weren&#39;t, and the burden of proof is on the doctor.
</p>
<p>
Personally I think OP shouldn&#39;t give in to the black mail. The case would likely be thrown out before ever going to court so they wouldn&#39;t need to spend a time on a lawyer.

I’m not sure the second one is a requirement unless the person you’re defaming is a celebrity. Its called the ‘actual malice’ standard that came to be after the New York v Sullivan case.
</p>
<p>
The damage caused is reputational damage. And the standard used for that is simply what an ordinary reasonable person would consider to be reputational damage. You don’t always need explicit proof of some monetary damage
</p>
<p>
I could be wrong since I’m not from the US but defamation law in the US as far as I know is pretty similar to the UK and India

I&#39;m pretty sure the US does require actual malice because it would otherwise interfere with free speech.

It does, but only for celebrities. Please let me know if there is any law or binding precedent that says that standard applies to all defamation cases, I’d be very surprised if that was the case

</a>
</p>
<p>
This outlines the 4 fundamental attributes that a defamation claim has to meet.
</p>
<p>
I suppose you&#39;re correct that the actual malice only applies to government officials, even so you still need to prove that someone made a false statement that they claimed was fact, and that&#39;s a high burden to overcome.
</p>
<p>
Another fact to consider is whether OP would be judgement proof. It&#39;s unlikely a Doctor will go through the effort of suing a person and paying all the legal fees when the individual in question will just be exempt from paying anything that Doctor would win in the case due to not having the income for it.

I just want to add that there are laws called Anti-SLAPP statutes. SLAPP stands for strategic lawsuit against public participation. Illinois has one.
</p>
<p>
Anti-SLAPP statutes provide protections for speech in addition to the common law and Constitutional protections. When someone sues you for exercising your right to speak publicly, such as on social media, you can
<em>
immediately
</em>
file a motion, without any discovery happening, to dismiss the case.
</p>
<p>
And what’s especially great about this is that if you win the motion, the other party must pay your attorneys’ fees. (This isn’t how it usually works in the US.) So you have a chance of getting an attorney to take your case at no cost to you.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know if Illinois’s law would protect you in your situation. I’m an attorney but this isn’t legal advice.
</p>
<p>
I would also add that the communication you received isn’t a particularly threatening one. It sounds like your main risk is losing your patient relationship with this doctor (which you might not care about), not getting sued.

He says that to everyone, he doesn’t do shit. You post your honest review about your honest thoughts and feelings, and he can’t do a thing. It would be a waste of time and money for him to try it with a frivolous lawsuit.  ☺️

Honestly I’m not sure about him but surgeons tend to flex but in reality they don’t want the truth to get out.
</p>
<p>
Maybe refer yourself to all the crap I said about Jumaily lately. Never was threaten to be sued because last thing he wants it’s for the Truth to get out.
</p>
<p>
In your case he flexes, in mine he knows that won’t bother me so he doesn’t even bother.
</p>
<p>
So as long as you what you state is the truth based on fact and data that supports it. He can’t really do anything.

i had a car garage try and trick me into getting 1200 dollars of work done on my truck .. they insisted i pay up front .. i thought that was weird no shop ever asks for money first .. you pay when work is complete .. so i told them no and left with my truck .. i then went to 3 shops and asked if work needed done .. all 3 said nothing is wrong with your truck ..
</p>
<p>
i then left a very nasty google review saying how this shop tried to scam me ..
</p>
<p>
the shop owner called me on my phone threatening legal action if i did not take down the review .. i told him to go fuk himself
</p>
<p>
he then tried asking me please take down the review .. i said no you tried to scam me and others need to know ..
</p>
<p>
that was 10 years ago .. the review is still up and nothing happened
</p>
<p>
a car is not surgery but you left a google review .. just in reddit .. people need to know .. thats not smearing his name thats giving your opinion on your experience
</p>
<p>
but im no lawyer
</p>
<p>
call a free consultation lawyer and they will give you a 20 minute interview on the phone .. tell them this story and they will tell you whats up
</p>
<p>
id bet money this doctor cannot do shit ..you was a good person warning others giving your opinion on your experience with this doctor .. that&#39;s not smearing his name that&#39;s just a google review

Its just a meaningless threat. Defamation doesn’t apply when what you’re saying is true. Your post was also in the form of a question where you outlined your subjective experience. He has to show how you saying what you did was (a) false and (b) directly led to reputational harm for him. Both are difficult to prove.
</p>
<p>
Tell him that if he chooses to sue you, you’ll tell the world that this is a doctor that sues his own patients for sharing their experience with him. And that he can be countersued for threatening to file frivolous litigation.

Ah, now I understand why people are secretive about surgeons who botched something. That fine line between wanting to protect others and avoiding being sued. Sucks
</p>
<p>
Also wtf, his office is acting like that 31 upvote, 3 comment post made it to national television news. Makes me think they&#39;re bluffing - there&#39;s no way a small post on a niche subreddit is gonna be some smoking bullet in court 😂

Hi, lawyer here. I don’t practice tort law (including defamation), so my thoughts come from what I learned in law school/for the bar/in the general legal world, and shouldn’t be relied on as official legal advice, but that being said, I don’t think a defamation suit here should be a concern. Defamation distinguishes between statements of fact and statements of opinion. Reviewing your original post, you have a mix of these (“he left my dentures in” is fact, “he talks at me rather than with me” is opinion). Fact is all that matters for defamation. If the facts you conveyed are true, you cannot be held liable for sharing them public or sharing other negative opinions.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there is a heightened standard that applies when the person being allegedly defamed is in the public eye or the matter is of public concern. Hard to say whether that applies here, but arguably it could since you’re trying to publicly inform people about something that could do them harm. If that standard applies, he would also need to show that you knew these statements were false before you made them, so even if you incorrectly (but reasonably) assumed something to be true, that still wouldn’t be held against you.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I wouldn’t give into his demands. Doubtful he’ll actually sue in any event, and if he does, there are a lot of organizations that provide pro bono legal aid to LGBTQ+ individuals.
<a href="https://www.spencerfane.com/professionals/dj-healey/">DJ Healey
</a>
(who is trans herself) and
<a href="https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/anten-todd/">Todd Anten
</a>
are two high-profile lawyers that have done notable pro bono trans representation, and there are many others. I’d hold strong, and if he actually comes after you, you should be able to find the help you need. Good luck!

Contact any trans legal organizations and see if you can get a nice letter sent in return.

This is bullshit intimidation.

This is a scare tactic. Min Jun attempted similar things and sent a formal letter to me ending care etc, don’t listen to it and carry on. Doctors who act like this aren’t worth listening to, and their threats prove it. In my case Min Jun was let go from his clinic a few weeks later, I know that can’t be the case here unfortunately.

Min Jun being “let go” is all speculation but there is no actual proof that he was let go from the Crane Center.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I’m not in anyway defending the guy but I doubt the Crane Center would want to let him go since he’s the most popular surgeon in the center and they would lose so much business, plus the Crane Center is selfish and would try to keep Dr. Jun in every possible way. I think he left on his own accord to be honest but that is just my personal opinion.

Dr. Jun was no let go. Far from it. If anything opening his own practice is a huge step up from working as one of many doctors in a clinic. All the major doctors have their own practices if you think about it.

The top ffs doctors, the top srs doctors, the top plastic surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I was one of the last patients from Dr. Jun at Crane and everyone there was absolutely devastated that he was leaving. So, not only he is an amazing surgeon but also someone lovely to work with :).
</p>
<p>
As much as the commenter above loves to sound “matter-of-fact” she sure likes to spread fear and lies. And that should be called out.

This is what will happen to his reputation if he fucks around. He has now caught the attention of the Butcher Busters.
</p>
<p>
Post the screenshot when you get a chance. We&#39;re going to look into this guy, a petition, and flyers will follow shortly. Fuck any surgeon who uses the trans community as a grift and attempts to punch down and silence.

Fuck it. Don&#39;t do anything. If ur actually worried, Delete ur account and have one of us post it &#34;anonymously&#34; I don&#39;t give a fuck he can try to sue me. So hard to prove defamation, especially when you&#39;re sharing experiences at his practice.

He can&#39;t stop us sharing in DM&#39;s anonymously so the data can&#39;t be deleted from the internet. Indeed, he&#39;s wining now a permanent &#39;&#39;data preservation gift&#39;&#39;.

There&#39;s no way to stop the review he obtained from OP.

nah this is fucked up he did you dirty; over charged; and now threaten legal action?  Dr, if you&#39;re reading this; this couldve been avoided if you did your due diligence across several missteps.  Sarah couldve sued you outright for the way care you provided: and instead she chose to warn others and leave it at that.  There&#39;s not a jury thatll take your side over hers. Get your shit together.

You could add an &#34;All persons fictitious&#34; disclaimer at the end followed by a wink emoji. Something like this:

Just wondering about this for myself because the surgeon who did my orchi did an amazing job but misgendered me repeatedly and said sexist stuff about my mom in the post op meeting. I want to let people know but don’t want to end up getting sued

Fuck him, share your story. A tyrant surgeon who threatens SLAPP suits is no ally to the trans community and only exists to be toppled. Our sisters at stonewall would have never of tolerated monsters like Zukowski and Rumer and neither should we.

I wrote a very long highly detailed complaint to the patient representative . His job will not be around much longer. It was exceptionally bad . It wasn’t just the misgendering. He was making sexist rapey locker room jokes about my mom.
</p>
<p>
Misgendering is bad but the other stuff he said is much more legally enforceable
</p>
<p>
If you must know he’s based in Colorado but I’d rather stay anonymous

He can’t do shit!!! This speaks volumes on his professionalism. He’s a dr. He took an oath to not do no harm to others under his care… how will you go back for check ups when he’s breaking his professional oath. us as patients we surrender everything to them. they have our life’s in their hands. What we should do as trans community is to stand behind this girl and fight with her. there’s bunch of associations that will stand behind you. Let’s fight for the respect we deserve. Let’s educate and make it clear to this “surgeons” that weren’t lab rats to experiment on because that’s what tons of this medical profesionals are doing with us… making it up as they go. Unfortunately it’s part of the process as laws are barely starting to look our way and considered us humans… so let’s let them know we appreciate it, but we also demand respect.

He should be sued by you for threatening you. Basically renouncing to take care of your health after you voiced your experience with him and his team. He’s basically has threatened your health and life.

If they allegations made against the doctor are true then u cannot Claim defamation and therefore the other individual could sue for threats online.  you cannot threaten someone to remove the post for defamation unless it is really defamation..  others should definitely be made aware of any bad practices or malpractice so the next person has that knowledge so the same issue won’t happen to anyone else. And honestly individuals have an obligation to warn others so they don’t become victim from the same place. However, if u lied in ur post to defame someone knowingly and willfully u can certainly be sued if u don’t remove the post. Most people don’t go out of there way to make up fake claims which I hope this isn’t the case. If u told the truth in your original post, then u have every right to share that with others.. and don’t let anyone scare u into taking down your post that is accurate. It’s just some folks don’t want u saying what they did because it hurts there business. But, that’s not on u that’s on the business and they shouldn’t have done whatever said things u claimed. I’m giving u both sides, I don’t know what happened or what didn’t happen. Only u know whether ur accusations are true or not so u can choose to leave the post up if it’s accurate or remove it if ur accusations are false and owe an apology. Either way I hope this helps u to relax alittle bit so u can decide what u want to do.  Take care..
