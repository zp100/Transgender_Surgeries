Who was your surgeon? I made a
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/iajbhp/how_common_is_nerve_damage_in_ffs/">thread
</a>
just yesterday about this and no one seems to have good information on how common it is.

For me, yeah.  Is it really numb it just feels weird? Like, if you closed your eyes and had someone poke it, are you sure you&#39;d feel nothing?
</p>
<p>
How much swelling is there?
</p>
<p>
You won&#39;t really be able to tell until month 3-4 if it&#39;s nerve damage

If I closed my eyes and someone poked it I wouldn‚Äôt feel anything at all, I wouldn‚Äôt even know. But if they pressed on it I‚Äôd feel some soreness on the inside where the bone is. But yeah it‚Äôs completely totally numb. It feels like when ur leg feels asleep except less tingly... just uncomfortable. Like it kinda hurts from feeling numb... but also if I touch it I can‚Äôt feel anything.
</p>
<p>
Edit: in fact I keep biting my bottom lip like really badly because I can‚Äôt feel it. I‚Äôve got a lot of sores where I‚Äôve bit on the inside of my lip

Probably or probably not. If you want to find out you can get an xray or ct scan. You should be able to see if the inferior dental nerves are still connected to your mental nerves connecting to your lip, chin and gum out of the foramen.
</p>
<p>
If the nerves are attached and not severed then celebrate. You only need time. If they are cut it won&#39;t come back.

If it&#39;s still very swollen, that could be expected, and could go away in a few months.
</p>
<p>
I remember trying to shave a few hairs, and scared bc I couldn&#39;t feel the blade.  I&#39;m fine now.
</p>
<p>
But nerve damage is possible and it could take a year to heal if it&#39;s a damaged nerve vs edema pushing on it.

Took me like 3 months to get most of it back, but to be honest about 1/3 of my bottom lip is still around 70% numb. Its was annoying for a while, after over a year with it I hardly notice anymore. guess my body just got used to it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Does lead to some awkward moments when I drink  sometimes.

I have a numb spot, not the same place as you are though. My doctor told me the sensation will take
<strong>
months
</strong>
to come back.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d say it&#39;s too early to tell if there is a problem, so hang in there!

It takes the nerves a while to reconnect and it can take a while.  It should be getting a little better, bit by bit, though.  I‚Äôd ask my surgeon if I were you.

I can‚Äôt promise this is going to be helpful as it‚Äôs a touch off topic BUT I broke my jaw a few years ago (BADLY) I bit through my lip; broke teeth; and of course; broke my jaw (in three places) I read people talking about the types of nerve damage and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm one of the worse case. I loved to whistle but couldnt even move my lip into that position for about 8 months (like novocain at the dentist- it was tragic all drinks had to be straw for a long while) which is to say nothing of the fact that I couldn‚Äôt feel ANYTHING on my lower left side of my lips as that‚Äôs the side I bit through.
</p>
<p>
This is all to say that was early 2017 - by mid-late 2018 I had the ability to whistle back and aside from broken teeth; these days I forget it happened at all. I know 17-20 isn‚Äôt the time line you want to hear but I thought I was screwed for feeling again, patience and time a whole lot of patience and time. Oh and stay positive ‚ù§Ô∏è
