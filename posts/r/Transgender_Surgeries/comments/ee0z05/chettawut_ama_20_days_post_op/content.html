I noticed my results post, NSFW, was getting a lot of AMA type questions, so I&#39;ll just answer those here.

My surgery date was dec 2nd with Chettawut in Bangkok, I last minute changed to the cosmetic surgery, shallow depth: 1-2&#34;, because I didn&#39;t know it was an option before my consult. I&#39;m asexual, so this isn&#39;t a big deal for me.
</p>
<p>
Cosmetic vs full depth schedule: Time in clinic post op is 4 days instead of 7 and you can start eating solids as soon as you are returned to the hotel rather than waiting for the packing to be removed (I think this is 10 days).
</p>
<p>
Consult: Dr. Chettawut was very sweet and didn&#39;t bully me or scare me out of my last minute cosmetic decision and went straight to reasuring me that I had options in the future if I changed my mind: he can do a skin graft from the belly if you have enough extra tissue or he can do a colon graft.
</p>
<p>
He saw how nervous I was, hugged me, and said he and his staff would do anything in their power to put me and any worries I had at ease before I was sent home with my bowel cleansing kit.
</p>
<p>
Bowel cleansing and diet: It sucks, see schedule below ...

<p>
General schedule:

</a>
Fyi, I posted the full depth schedule as this is more common.
</p>
<p>
Recovery in the clinic: Boring and uncomfortable. They feed you 3x times a day from a limited, but okay menu, I experienced a bit of nausea early on, but never threw up ... always eat slow.
</p>
<p>
The nurses are on speed dial, but check in on you regularly. Sponge bath once a day I think? The bed is kinda uncomfortable and this really wore me down by day 3 and 4 with back soreness, they did anything they could to help (brought a gel pad). Day one and two I experienced a really bad growing pain that the tramadol didn&#39;t help with, so they gave me morphine, don&#39;t worry they won&#39;t treat you like an addict and want to make sure you aren&#39;t in pain.
</p>
<p>
Recovery at the hotel: I was returned to the hotel after 4 days, the drive over was fairly painless and the driver was insanely cautious, avoided bump, etc.
</p>
<p>
Bandages came off a few days later and nurses checked in on me daily except Sunday, they&#39;re all very sweet and gentle. One day after the catheter is out you&#39;re free to roam the hotel within your ability. I snuck out a day or two before the catheter was removed since I was going stir crazy.
</p>
<p>
The most pain I experienced was after the bandages came off and my nerves started &#34;hooking back up&#34;, the tramadol didn&#39;t seem to be effective or maybe that that level of pain was much less than hadn&#39;t I taken the tramadol. It was like a throbbing pain that kept me awake a few nights until the catheter came out.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it&#39;s now day 20 and I can sit for 2-3 hours on my donut and stand/walk for any amount of time without discomfort or pain.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m headed home in five days!

I have a question: Is there a difference when it come to price between a full depth and no depth surgery ? Assuming the no depth would be cheaper because simpler

No price difference, I think the bulk of his efforts, time, and work are in the entire vulva. Full depth surgery is only 6 hours vs 4 hours shallow depth (although I&#39;m suspicious he spent 6 hours on me since I woke over 6 hours later on the table). Cosmetic gcs is around 2-3cm, he doesn&#39;t do zero depth.
