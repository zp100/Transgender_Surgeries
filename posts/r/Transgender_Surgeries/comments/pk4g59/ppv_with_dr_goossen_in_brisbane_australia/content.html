Please feel free to ask me any questions, either as a comment or as a DM. I tried to write this as a general recap of my experience thus far, with the idea that people who haven&#39;t had surgery can read it and learn.

That‚Äôs what don‚Äôt get about Australia. These surgeons are swamped with work, yet our private healthcare doesn‚Äôt cover these surgeries (even though there‚Äôs clearly a demand) which results in Australians taking that cash, overseas.

Thank you for this, I recently had a shock, because a suregon told me that PPV might not be possible for me since I&#39;m so thin, my pelvis is too narrow he says. Need to get second opinion, but you wrote that you are slim, was it ever an issue?

I have child bearing hips and did before hrt. My issue was length while flaccid, which like, even though i was dead average erect i was significantly under while not. Its why i went for ppv in the first place.
</p>
<p>
My surgery went overtime because my doc had trouble making the piv tissues meet the peritoneum but it worked in the end.

You&#39;ve been in recovery for a little while now. How are you feeling and how satisfied are you with the results ?  I didn&#39;t know he did PPV and really don&#39;t want to settle for penile inversion so your post is music to my eyes üòÜ Been on his wait-list a while now so hopefully I&#39;ll have a consult soon üôèüèª

gotta go back under soon. I&#39;m pretty happy with everything. Its a complex surgery and i need a revision. &#34;settle&#34; for piv is a concerning comment, what do you mean settle.

While PIV is the most common method of GRS and is well documented and widely performed, it&#39;s an almost 100 year old surgery and has many downsides compared to PPV.  I&#39;m also worried about not having enough tissue for PIV but that doesn&#39;t matter for PPV. If I had no other options then I would &#34;settle&#34; for PIV but PPV is way more innovative in my eyes.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask what sort of revision ? I hope nothing went wrong or anything. Glad to hear you&#39;re happy with everything tho.

I want to summarise our DMs.
<br>
This person has some very incorrect ideas about what exactly PPV is. Their research they they&#39;ve linked me is the surgery version of used car salesmen tactics. I strongly object to how they talk about PIV, as someone who has had PPV done.
