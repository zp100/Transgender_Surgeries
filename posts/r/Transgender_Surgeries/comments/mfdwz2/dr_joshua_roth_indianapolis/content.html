hi everyone! i know there’s been a few post about Dr. Roth, but i was hoping to make a post with the potential of finding more information. i haven’t had a consultation with him yet as i only have one referral letter as of now. i also haven’t seen any post about anyone’s srs experience with him and apparently he only has about 20 surgeries under his belt. i’ve also heard that he has an experience  srs surgeon helping him but idk the name of said surgeon. Dr. Roth is my only option as a surgeon bc he takes my insurance and saving up thousands of dollars would take me decades upon end. i just want to make sure he’s a good surgery and that i’m not gonna end up on the next season of botched. so, if you have any information and i mean ANY information please please please share.
</p>
<p>
update: hi guys, i found a sweet woman who posted on her experience with Dr. Roth!

Many of my patients have gone to him (I’m a sex therapist). I have heard his bedside manner isn’t great, and it actually had two of my patients not go back after the consult. For those who actually went through with surgery, unfortunately, I just wrote their WPATH letter and they were not ongoing patients of mine so I never heard how they felt about the results. If you’re in Indy, join the Facebook group Queering Indy and ask there if anyone has outcomes to share. And good luck!

I agree completely on your bedside manner feedback. Unacceptable.

I think so far I&#39;m the only one speaking up who has had any surgery with him. He did a small revision.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve posted about my experience with Dr Roth and how I feel about it. I have no idea why no one else is willing to speak up about their GRS surgery with him.
</p>
<p>
Personally,  I&#39;ve had noting but problems with Trans care at IU-HEALTH and with multiple doctors. After the disasterous last four years and multiple surgeries, I don&#39;t want to be responsible for recommending anyone from the LGBTQ community seek surgery there. Sorry,  I don&#39;t have better news for you and I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s your only choice for GRS .
