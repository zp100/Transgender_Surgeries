You might want to talk to your surgeon for SRS about it, they&#39;ll be working in the general area anyways, and you&#39;ll have to be cathed for it.

I was under for 12 hours and catheterized by FT for my FFS. This was back in 2015 before having SRS. Comparatively being catheterized pre-op SRS is way more uncomfortable than it was post-op SRS. That said, it was a minor annoyance and the catheter was out the morning after my FFS. I wouldnâ€™t worry too much about it. If you plan on SRS or havenâ€™t had SRS yet, get used to it. Catheterization is just part of the experience unfortunately.

I had a catheter for FFS and while ofc it&#39;s not a Joy, it wasn&#39;t a negative experience for me - they remove it relatively soon after you wake up, you&#39;ve still got a lot of pain meds on board, and you&#39;re not really walking around so much so it doesn&#39;t really get a chance to get so uncomfortable - even the removal just felt Odd instead of painful

FFS went great. I had a lot of work done. I did get unlucky with the cath though post SRS. Wore that sucker for two weeks due to complications.

I had no idea this was a thing. Surely thereâ€™s an easier way than a catheterisation.must kill to remove it too.

I had it for an unrelated surgery a few years ago, and it&#39;s really not that bad. Worse on paper than in practice.

From what I remember from mine coming out, the nurse looked like he was trying to start a lawn mower.

If you&#39;re going to be under for more than a minor procedure, catheterization is almost always indicated, and FFS is not a minor procedure. In addition to preventing unwanted voiding of the bladder during surgery, keeping the bladder empty helps prevent compression of the iliac veins and compromising blood return from the legs, which could lead to deep veinous thrombosis. The catheter is removed after you wake up because you need to be able to control your bladder.

No, not all procedures, and yes, it is a function of the length of a procedure.  Some surgeons say anything more than an hour, and some say more than three hours.  I was catheterized when I had a BA.
</p>
<p>
I realize your question was specific to Facialteam, but I was giving a general answer.  If you are that concerned the simplest answer is to call them up and ask.

Lets get some context here. So you go into theatre with an empty bladder. The average person produces 40mls of urine per hour, providing they are fully hydrated. They will put a drip in mainly for IV Drugs and blood loss. That should keep you hydrated and facial surgery is generally low blood loss surgery. The human bladder can hold 400 - 800mls. So yes, if you are having facial surgery for 12hrs it is warranted. Come on FT a catheter is there just to make things easy for the staff, not the patient. You have every right to tell them to stick it elsewhere. Totally not needed.

Not if you can&#39;t control your urethral sphincter.  That&#39;s kind of the point.

Its common for general anesthetic to prevent urination for a while after the patient wakes. Personally I would rather have the catheter put in while under and removed after the anaesthetic has had plenty of time to wear off. In terms of FFS the addition of a catheter is insignificant.
