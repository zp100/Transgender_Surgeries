I wanted to speak about UC Health here in Denver, CO, and my experience with them now that I am post-op for one month. Surgery was on January 19, 2023. My surgeons were Dr. Winocour, assisted by Dr. Kaoutzanis. My insurance paid over $50K for these procedures, and I have a rhinoplasty, lip lift, and some fat grafting still in the face to get done.
</p>
<p>
Update: I received my breast augmentation at UC Health with Dr. Winocour.

<p>
I received the following surgeries for the upper 3rd and lower 3rd of the face. Unfortunately, they would not do a rhinoplasty or any other soft tissue work at the same time.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Frontal bone osteotomy with anterior table setback (Dr. Kaoutzanis).
</li>
<li>
Coronal brow lift, bilateral (Dr. Kaoutzanis).
</li>
<li>
Hairline advancement (Dr. Kaoutzanis).
</li>
<li>
Genioplasty (Dr. Winocour assisted by Dr. Kaoutzanis).
</li>
<li>
Bilateral contouring of the mandibular angles (Dr. Winocour assisted by Dr. Kaoutzanis).
</li>
<li>
Bilateral buccal fat resection (Dr. Winocour assisted by Dr. Kaoutzanis).
</li>
<li>
Neck liposuction (Dr. Winocour).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
Total surgery time:
</strong>
9.5 hours in the OR with two days of in-patient stay afterward

Comparisons:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I attempted to show the same lighting to highlight the changes a little better. Also, the doctors said that the swelling wouldn&#39;t be gone for months. This is very true for my chin and jaw. It looks very similar to the original, but I know they did a lot of work on it.

Hairline advancement. My hairline was 9cm from my eyebrows pre-FFS. Supposedly it&#39;s now 5-5.5cm, but I still had some bad recession around the edges.

I was wondering, was their decision to not do soft tissue at the same time based on your specific procedures and circumstances, or is that just what they do for everyone? (sorry for asking so long after you posted, I only just now found out that Dr. K is my in-network surgeon). Thanks!

They really don&#39;t like doing a full-face transformation at UC Health in one go (meaning more than one 3rd). I pushed them to do the top and bottom with such significant bone work because I am trying to get as much surgery as possible so I can leave my job sooner. Not to mention having a very masculine presentation and wanting a dramatic result (though still natural). I was concerned with scheduling issues that I would only get a portion of my FFS as well.
</p>
<p>
Dr. K and Dr. W like to see the bone structure settle prior to soft tissue manipulation. If you have minimal bone work, they will combine bone and soft tissue work... but they tend to gravitate towards one-thing-at-a-time methodologies. I was probably one of their more complicated and involved FFS bone contouring surgeries. I was under anesthesia for over 8.5 hours with two plastic surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Dr. K has evolved over time, but he is very precise with his work. He ended up doing most of my face eventhough I thought it was Dr. W at the time. They usually help one another. It makes sense because Dr. W trained Dr. K, but K came to UC Health prior to Dr. W. They studied at Vanderbuilt together. Also, Dr. W is FACS while K is not.

Awesome, thanks for all the info! I suppose I understand where they are coming from, I am just concerned about undergoing multiple procedures when lots of other FFS surgeons are able to produce great work in one shot, since I will likely need the full suite of work done. Hope your recovery and everything is going well!

I know this is super late, but I just discovered your post as I was about to post my own quesyions about Dr. K while researching him. Can I ask how your recovery was and if you have numbness? I am concerned about permanent sensation loss in my lips specifically. Also, are you generally happy with your results?

I haven&#39;t seen a ton either, but I did some poking around to find other&#39;s reviews/experiences, and it convinced me enough to schedule a consult (be warned, he is booked pretty far out).

Hi! I&#39;m wondering how this has turned out for you. I&#39;m also searching right now for FFS doctors around the Denver area. My work insurance includes benefits for trans employees, and I&#39;m unsure what/ who my options are

So I scheduled a consult with Dr. Koutzanis at UC Health but I haven&#39;t had the appointment yet. (I called in July, and the earliest they had was December). As far as I can tell from my insurance, I&#39;ll still have to hit my out-of-pocket maximum before they start paying, but at least it is not too bad. I&#39;ll try to do a post once I get further in the process.
