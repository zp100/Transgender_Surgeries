So, back in mid October I finally convinced my therapist to write me the letter and get one of his coworkers to write the second one for me. After a LOT of frustration with the lack of ability to do ANYTHING MEDICAL without having to wake up early and play phone tag for a week I got my consultation SCHEDULED on the 20th of October, for today (December 14th) with Dr. Witten at First Urology.
</p>
<p>
Now, I live in Lexington, and one of my former HRT prescribers also referred me to Dr. Monnig who I had as my &#34;plan B&#34; surgeon and I had the consultation with HIM 4 days ago, but the surgery date is farther out than the 3-week estimate Witten gave me (which is basically just making sure insurance clears, it&#39;s a 20-30 minute outpatient procedure so it&#39;s easy to find time for it). Monnig REALLY turned me off cause despite all my referral paperwork getting my chosen name on it, since my legal name is my deadname I got deadnamed more than alive-named AND for the cherry on top I got asked [sic] &#34;so you&#39;re a transsexual or whatever they&#39;re calling it these days?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Needless to say I&#39;m going with Witten for a reason. He&#39;s also the only surgeon in Kentucky with any actual, like, REVIEWS anywhere for trans-related surgeries so I&#39;m definitely gonna add mine to the handful already on here.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Witten lives up to the hype when it comes to bedside manner and open-ness about preferences, not getting mad and defensive when a patient actually has half a clue what&#39;s going on, and seems to be very accommodating of requests like &#34;can I get it done under local or epidural?&#34; or &#34;can you see about getting me a Medical Memento release if you can convince em to not slice em up in Pathology afterwards?&#34; which is a welcome treat in the medical world, at least in my experience. Having a surgeon not get weirded out by me saying &#34;yeah I&#39;ve watched the videos&#34; or &#34;yeah I&#39;ve been looking forward to this for ages so I wanna be awake for it&#34; is also pretty relieving, honestly.
</p>
<p>
His operating assistant/nurse/secretary is also absolutely amazing in terms of &#34;getting shit done&#34; and from what I&#39;ve been told, she is not afraid to brute force every single combination of DIAG and CPT code for any given operation until insurance covers it, for an orchiectomy they have ONLY HAD TWO PEOPLE DENIED and both had CareSource which is kinda bottom-of-the-barrel as insurance goes. She&#39;s also the person you need to talk to in order to even SCHEDULE a consultation, as trying to dial up First Urology and navigate the phone tree is hopeless and trans care doesn&#39;t show up in the menus - her extension is 8925 for the record, leave a voicemail cause she&#39;s usually busy and prepare to get a call some time in the next few days to iron things out.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I don&#39;t really have much more to write FOR NOW cause I haven&#39;t actually gotten in for surgery and I&#39;m supposed to get the call back from his assistant with an actual date and insurance clearance Soonâ„¢ and I dunno when, exactly, it&#39;ll be because I kinda just said &#34;soonest possible, I&#39;ll figure it out&#34; and am hoping to get enough warning to find a driver for the 3 hour round trip instead of just a Louisville friend to crash with for a few days.
</p>
<p>
Edit: got the email today, I&#39;m in on January 4th! Almost exactly 3 weeks out from the consult, 2 weeks and a day from today. Perfect timing, I&#39;ll get more info soon and hopefully in a few weeks we&#39;ll get a surgery write-up.

I&#39;m just starting my process and have 0 clue what this process is like.  Thank you very much for your candor as well as your characterization of Dr. Monnig.  What to avoid is also very valuable.

Yeah, I mean, an orchiectomy isn&#39;t as complicated as full SRS is so honestly Monning probably could&#39;ve gotten me something I&#39;d find
<em>
acceptable
</em>
but tbh I&#39;ve formed enough opinions on procedure ins-and-outs in the 2+ years I&#39;ve been researching this hoping for the day I could get it done, so I feel like he would NOT be the ideal surgeon...
</p>
<p>
Witten&#39;s good and open to various techniques and being a full SRS surgeon as well, he knows how to do an orchi that&#39;s easy to work with later on down the road. Monnig mainly just does orchiectomies for boomers with ball cancer and as such is probably gonna be doing a less-than-optimal setup - most likely inguinal approach not scrotal Raphe incision, DEFINITELY under general anaesthetic and got mad for even SUGGESTING local (Witten typically does general but I stated my preference to be awake for the biggest event of my life, and not get anaesthetic hangover for 3 days), and I got the feeling he&#39;s the kind of &#34;surgery keeps you alive it&#39;s not supposed to be fun&#34; guy to use the stupid Nylon ligature clips everyone who&#39;s had them hates instead of silk or Vicryl suture ligations (Vicryl is what Witten uses).
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re closer to Louisville than to any other middle-of-the-road surgeon (not a BIG NAME one since they have absurd wait lists and are usually assholes, not an unheard of one who just says they do it but never actually has, just someone like Witten who&#39;s good enough to work but not so good they&#39;re swamped or have too much of an ego) I&#39;d suggest him. Heard good things about his results at least, and from what I&#39;ve seen of him and his team they&#39;ve at least got their hearts in the right place. Hell, my consultation was FREE, unlike Monnig who charged me the $35 &#34;specialist&#34; copay just to have me piss in a cup and fondle my dysphoria orbs and not even sign any consent papers.

For all that, a fee and an ego?  I&#39;m glad you found Dr. Witten.  I hope things go at least as smoothly on the day.

Omg omg omg. I have been looking EVERYWHERE for something about Witten! I&#39;m seeing him for phalloplasty and haven&#39;t found any reviews of him yet. Please keep us updated and thank you so so so much for sharing!

Yeah I know he does metoid and phallo for AFAB as well as zero-depth and penile inversion for AMAB, and off hand when I mentioned my intent to (when it gets available) get penile preservation vaginoplasty he was VERY interested in seeing what I knew especially after I mentioned how few surgeons do it, so he might get training on that too at some point.
</p>
<p>
Once my transmasc boyfriend gets a new set of surgery letters (he only had one, for top surgery, and it expired) I&#39;m definitely giving him the rec for Witten - not too far away, great insurance coverage, good bedside manner, and from what I&#39;ve heard his results are decent but there&#39;s not much info out there yet.

Yeah... sadly his assistant has apparently been out sick this week and most of the operating room time is booked out for FIVE weeks not THREE like the previous quote cause between COVID and insurance bullshit meaning people all schedule their surgeries for the very beginning and very end of the year all the hospitals are packed to the gills. Thankfully an orchi&#39;s a 20 minute procedure and she said over email that I&#39;ll get a call Monday with tentative dates and another when insurance clears, I&#39;m HOPING there&#39;s a tiny window I can get shoved into sooner than 5 weeks but that&#39;s still sooner than my Plan B&#39;s quote.

Thank you for this, I am in the middle of Illinois and for being so close to the third-largest city in the country, there is eff all for quality surgeons here. Like...how? I&#39;m not really in a position to fly and/or stay someplace for weeks to recover so this could be a huge answer to my wishes. I am more than willing to drive a couple of extra hours to go with Witten if I know it will be done right and done well.

I can&#39;t speak for how good his other surgeries are but the reviews I&#39;ve seen and his IRL mannerisms so far tell me he&#39;s probably good for an orchi no problem, and the current top post on the sub is his work on penile inversion - looks damn good to me. He does also do work in Southern Indiana as well I think, First Urology has several locations and he operates out of various hospitals in the greater Louisville area on both sides of the river.
</p>
<p>
If you need somewhere to crash for a few days pre/post surgery, Louisville area has a pretty damn good trans underground - I stayed with a FULLY post-op girl (who I met at a furry convention a week prior...) the night before my consult so I wouldn&#39;t have to deal with the construction traffic on I-64 and risk being late.

Are you referring to Dr. Stephen J. Monnig?

Yeah that&#39;s him, personally I&#39;d avoid him just based on vibes and general inexperience with trans patients, he&#39;ll probably be ADEQUATE if you&#39;re broke and don&#39;t have gas money to Louisville but he&#39;s not gonna be particularly GOOD.
