I also plan to have minimal depth SRS but with Chettawut. I am also asexual. But I think I&#39;m different from you in that I have zero interest in any kind of sex with others and I have never had any sexual or romantic relationship with others even though I&#39;m 33. So I have no interest in depth and no motivation for dilation. Also there are really so many possible complications and problems with the internal neovagina and dilation in terms of a full depth SRS and I understand our reasoning for this.

I also have a consult for minimal depth too but I have been second guessing a little I knew I wanted the vulvaplasty for a long time but I mean idk why not the regular penile inversion method is kinda what I&#39;m thinking. Also I&#39;m really not sure about stitches being inside of me.

If you are interested in sex and can tolerate dilation and complications associated with full depth SRS, you may consider a full depth SRS. There will be internal sutures and internal scars if you choose full depth SRS. Also, you&#39;d better not underestimate what dilation will demand from you. People have different goals and backgrounds. I&#39;m and will be very happy without sex with anyone in my whole life and I think I&#39;m rare.

That&#39;s correct. The problem you have to deal with is the scar formation internally. Not so much about the sutures themselves.

Hair removal is only needed in some cases, it seems PPT doesn&#39;t need it at all in most or all cases. The douching part confused me because I&#39;ve read a few places it&#39;s a bad idea to do long term, but after looking at the wiki it appears unclear if it is necessary to douche long term, I stopped douching at about 3 months post op personally.

Thanks for sharing! Great post. I feel like this was a good synopsis of your experience. I tend to be extremely detailed in my own posts but sometimes brevity is good. Very happy for you!
