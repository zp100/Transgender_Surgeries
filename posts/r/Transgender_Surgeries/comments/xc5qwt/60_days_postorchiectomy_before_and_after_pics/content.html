I&#39;m 12 days after surgery and I can concur. Initial swelling is very significant. But everyday it gets better. I can&#39;t wait for it to heal. Looks like a great result you had. Congratulations!

I was really curious about how easy it would be to hide things away post surgery so I&#39;m posting a before and after to hopefully help others that have the same questions.
</p>
<p>
While it looks the same in the after picture, pointing things downward basically makes it disappear and I can wear any clothing (including bathing suits) with almost no issue. For that alone, the surgery was worth it.
</p>
<p>
For the first two weeks post surgery there will be so much swelling it will look like the testes are still present. But once things heal up, everything else is very compressible and disappears with a very easy tuck.

Thanks for sharing about the swelling, I just got an orchi and scrotectomy and it still looks like I have testicles because of all the swelling! Mostly expected but I&#39;ve just been feeling super bloated in my lower abdomen and I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s also the swelling. Did you experience similar feelings a few days after surgery?

Oh yes, abdominal swelling/bloating was also a thing. I think the soreness keeps the muscles from properly contracting in that area or something

Oh that&#39;s good to hear, thanks! And that makes sense. I&#39;ve been worried that I&#39;m going to explode or something lol. It was really bad yesterday but it&#39;s been getting better ever so slowly.

That&#39;s crazy. It feels like - honestly in both pictures - you should have WAY more scrote...i mean - at least compared to what I&#39;ve got going on. Even when everything is bunched up cause it&#39;s cold or something it&#39;s quite wrinkled.

Fabulous. I‚Äôm on day 5 post op. I‚Äôm wearing leggings at home and every day it‚Äôs getting flatter and adopting a more female aspect. It‚Äôs indescribable not seeing or feeling those damn things.
</p>
<p>
I am of course, incredibly excited at not having damaging amounts of testosterone coursing around my body, I was using Finasteride which doesn‚Äôt stop testosterone but stops conversion to DHT. My surgeon was very impressed with the feminisation I‚Äôve achieved after two years on Finasteride and Estradiol and is confident that feminisation will accelerate.. exciting‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm also looking at getting Progesterone thrown into the mix. x

Feminisation is achieved by estrogen and progesterone it is not true to say that you need an orchi - it‚Äôs incorrect  My T levels are almost zero and have been after 3-4 estrogen mono therapy  Btw you need some T - cis women have some as well I ve never had an AA as not any need - even gender clinic 4 years latter confirmed this

some girls can never fully suppress their t with blockers or high dose monotherapy. Everyone is different. Your experience is not universal.

I‚Äôve never ever said you need to have an orchidectomy. I know females need T and produce T in the ovaries and adrenal glands and that after the orchidectomy I will only produce T from my adrenal glands and will be about that of a post menopausal woman. I am aware of monotherapy but in my case Finasteride was prescribed along with Estradiol, my regimen is now being reviewed.

The key question to answer is through your HRT what are your T levels running at ? Due to a mix of age and slowing ‚Äòeducating ‚Äò your endocrine system vie dr powers methods Your T levels would after 4-5 be negligible lower part of female range - and it doses are done correctly and levels checked every 4 months you‚Äôll see the complete folly of the need for orchi  I hope you realise that you‚Äôll need to pay special attention now to your bones  as you‚Äôre at high risk of osteoporosis Which is very dangerous in the winter months Others will often not be aware of this.

I really don‚Äôt understand the supposed attraction to this - for me it seems completely pointless operation which can often ruin a prospect of good SRS  As for the supposed reasons -If your HRT regime is managed correctly your T would be at the lowest end of female range after 4-6 months and with SRS this is actually part of it anyway. In the UK orchi quite rightly is not even commissioned as it‚Äôs seen as a waste of scarce resources. Those who transition get SRS (eventually )  You get feminisation by Estrogen and later progesterone ( bio identical )  You mention that you‚Äôve not had progesterone yet ? Why ?  My T level after only a few months on estrogen was in female range and I never had a T blocker as modern therapy often means itbis completely unnecessary often counterproductive  There are many who actually understand this although sadly very few on Reddit - they reside in medical forums and informal medical education

I really think less celebration is required as people can be influenced only to regret it terribly later on If you don‚Äôt want to transition fully please ignore the above completely

Ok. Seriously. You need to back the f up.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re projecting your own experience and desires on everyone else and then adding some pissy little guilt trip in there as well to make people feel bad about &#34;wasting resources&#34;.

As someone who&#39;s had both, having an orchiectomy was some of the best money I have ever spent on surgery. It&#39;s not even a contest.  The procedure has little impact on GRS and if you have a particular surgeon picked out you can always reach out to them and ask them directly if you&#39;re concerned. The advantages are clear from a &#34;bulk&#34; perspective. It may not seem that significant by the OP&#39;s images, but it is. It provides confidence when wearing just about anything you&#39;d like without the need of tucking. I went 12 years between the two procedures and it had a huge impact.
</p>
<p>
All that aside, the reduction of long term anti-androgen use is advantageous. It also reduces the overall estrogen required to meet long-term maintenance levels. The overall reduction in HRT cost and risk again is significant. That may not seem like a priority in the first 5 years of HRT, but this is a lifetime commitment. It matters. Some people already have difficulties with HRT supplies. The less reliance on that supply chain the better.
</p>
<p>
You are more than welcome to approach this any way that you&#39;d like. If you don&#39;t understand why is procedure can be a significant advantage, perhaps my answers will help.

You just could have said --Not all surgeons do GRS on post-orch patients, you may want to check.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s been discussed on many occasions.  I believe Suporn is one of those surgeons. Perhaps Banks is too. They are outliers however, and have a specialized technique which is impacted by an orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not trying to be difficult here. I&#39;m simply providing you some reasons why this procedure is worthy of celebration to many.

They are not outliers they probably represent the very best SRS surgery to those who are completely self pay and are from countries such as England  where we have no choice but to wait 6-7 years plus or find a reasonable economic solution at the same time as getting excellent results amongst the very best I ve seen anywhere  There are many in my position and if they saw this without further knowledge  that option and hope would have been removed completely by the inaccurate posting information above hence my comments  Also mention constantly of cost of anti androgens is not true as modern transitioning if done correctly means no need for AA at all. I ve never had AA as not needed My T has always apart from first 3 months always been in lower end of female range I know that many others share same experience and Dr Powers advocates this

Hey, you do you girlfriend. Everyone has to use the resources available to them. No one is trying to dash anyone&#39;s dreams here, but it sounds like your advocating for a one-size-fits-all solution for HRT and surgery that&#39;s based on the limitations or access to your own care. There are people who use monotherapy, but the use of  anti-androgens hasn&#39;t fallen out of favor here in the US.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, I was responding to your negative comments about having an Orchiectomy, which I stand by. This is the wrong Sub for a longer discussion of HRT.

I understand what you are saying but it‚Äôs the celebratory tone which is extremely worrying. Luckily it‚Äôs not too late for me but I fear that others may get this procedure without the knowledge that the 2 or 3 best economic as well as successful surgeons can‚Äôt do SRS if you‚Äôve had this first. Also the emphasis on help with T control and anti androgens really shows the OP being unaware of newer developments  I m in the UK snd thanks to my knowledge and being able to find and convince a local doctor I was able to  obtain access to estrogen patches with no unnecessary AA or T blocking injections. If you‚Äôre T level is next to zero and this is constant for over 4 years through constant checks it is unnecessary This is what Dr Powers concludes as well and it is true to say that feminisation takes places via good estrogen loading and dosing and then later added bio identical progesterone  The posts above seem to suggest that it is all about testosterone which it is not  Good understanding of how the endocrine system works is essential  Sadly in trans healthcare knowledge is often outdated and poor  We deserve better and sharing outdated info in a celebratory manner does not help those looking for answers  Hence why I posted

You can go to Suporn Clinic if you‚Äôve had an orchiectomy. It‚Äôs removal of the scrotum that‚Äôs the problem.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone can suppress testosterone with estrogen, and transdermal doesn‚Äôt work for everyone either. You‚Äôre lucky it works for you.

I was actually wondering about this. I saw on the Suporn Clinic website that their technique relies on use of testicular material (it looks like they rely on foreskin as well) and I couldn&#39;t find anything to confirm or deny whether circumcision or orchiectomy would disqualify someone from that technique.

Full bottom surgery is a massive commitment with serious complications and recovery and this helps with dysphoria, reducing meds, tucking, faster feminization, etc. Also, much much cheaper

SRS is transitioning ( after HRT obviously for at least a year to 2 years )  In America people seem to get insurance for everything even including FFS TS and numerous other procedures as well as BA In the UK we wait over 7-8 years to eventually get considered for SRS ( nothing else ) and even then many are turned away or give up and go private in desperation even if they have no money  I have my Own thought about the real reasons why and I m sure this is part of the cost benefit analysis that is part of commissioning services  What I wrote above is true and is the facts over here. I ve seen others really regret orchi as it terribly affected later SRS - often ensuring a poor result  and then really warning others to not do this

I&#39;m not sure what you expect people to take away from what you&#39;re explaining? There are risk involved?
</p>
<p>
It is unfortunate that it takes as long as it does in the UK to get into the system. Ot clearly has a lot of impact on people&#39;s mental health and other aspects of people&#39;s lives. But your comment that you&#39;ve seen so many others others regret their orchiectomy after poor results feels loaded, misrepresented and flies in the face of the experiences shared in the sub over years.
</p>
<p>
It feels more like resentment than practical advice based on evidence or your own experience.

As I said above orchi is NOT feminisation  you get feminisation with correct hormones ( estrogen and progesterone) and later SRS vaginoplasty

Not everybody who transitions with an Orchiectomy wants a vagina. And it is really a relatively minor although irreversible procedure. I had mine two years ago and I still have enough skin for a vagina should I want one. But being 69, not sure I need or want one.

If something is irreversible then it‚Äôs not minor and I have seen others really regret it as it DID affect their subsequent SRS very negatively  The fact needs to be established that this is serious and can mean an inability to have SRS later  As I ve said it‚Äôs not even commissioned at all in Uk and the reason is correct HRT sorts T to be negligible and as for tucking - most lose 40-50 % or more in size down there so that barely noticeable at all  I can accept there maybe a few who are too old or unable to be accepted for SRS and may want to avail this privately but  i ve seen too many who are younger and may well live to regret it with dire consequences
