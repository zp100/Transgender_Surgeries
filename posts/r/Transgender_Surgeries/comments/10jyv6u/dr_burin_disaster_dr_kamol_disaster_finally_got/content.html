Notes: I wouldn&#39;t trust Dr Burin to do anything other than PI SRS. My experience is that Burin suffers a lot of internal fear - which isn&#39;t ideal in a surgeon - as if surgery isn&#39;t going to plan - he likely can&#39;t keep a cool head.
</p>
<p>
Kamol hospital is past it&#39;s sell-by date imo, mainly because there&#39;s a very strange thing going on between Kamol and his wife Siripen (the supposed manager of the hospital). I was wondering if they&#39;re separated but both want to keep ownership/position. This might explain the atrocious admin and communication which goes on between Kamol and the admin side of the hospital. Plus Siripen just goes absent without leave for weeks/months at a time. I really felt I was having to deal with a person who is both an actual real sadist (i.e. gets off on purposefully causing her patients emotional and psychological suffering), and someone who manifests symptoms of serious mental health issues. I communicated my experience of both of these to her.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the pre-surgery consultation with Kamol was turned into a farce because Siripen hadn&#39;t advised Kamol that I&#39;d wired approx 16k USD rather than the 5k USD he had admin notes for. So Kamol spent most of the time focusing on what I couldn&#39;t have done, because of me only paying 5k. And he asked me to pay more! I even wondered if it was a common setup they play on patients, as I read of other trans girls experiencing similar.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s vital to confirm who will actually be doing the surgery. SRS is way too important to have a trainee working on a trans girl (at least without such being clear up front). Bear in mind, a surgeon can legally say they&#39;re doing the work if they&#39;re in the room and supervising a trainee (whose actually doing the work). So is essential to find out who is actually going to be doing the bulk of the hands on surgical work.
</p>
<p>
I was treated so poorly and unprofessionally by Burin and Kamol - just an utter disgrace.
</p>
<p>
When I turned up at PAI in June 2018, after traveling to the other side of the world - within the first five minutes, the admin staff (who are real sneaks and backstabbers imo) informed me that Sutin who I&#39;d booked wasn&#39;t available and that not to worry, Dr Burin was an amazing surgeon (sic). However, later, a nurse at the hospital explained to me that six months or so before, Dr Burin had a patient who went home with a ostomy pouch, and that I was his first patient for the same procedure since then. This was the third time I should have run as fast as I could. But with such excitement, expectations, and having organized three weeks away and paid out such precious funds - I overrode my natural sense and just hoped for the best.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve long felt that PAI/Burin set me up - so as to provide Burin with a new patient - so he could get his confidence back!
</p>
<p>
The point being, they could have written me that Sutin wasn&#39;t available, at least before I left my home country (if not a significant time beforehand) - as they had known for weeks. Rather without question they purposefully set me up.
</p>
<p>
I was officially (financially) bankrupted trying to recover from Burin&#39;s disaster.
</p>
<p>
I hope my managing to sort things after such disasters, proves useful for any other trans girls facing similar issues.
</p>
<p>
If I was starting again, I would keep it simple with PI SRS, and see how it goes. So important to cover every last detail and know what a surgeon&#39;s going to do. In Burin&#39;s revision, he just did things which hadn&#39;t been ageed.
</p>
<p>
Another factor with PI is that the named surgeon is likely to be doing the whole procedure. But with other SRS methods, it&#39;s often the case that the named surgeon will only be doing the &#39;exterior&#39; vagina work. Often, another (unnamed and unknown to the patient) surgeon will be contracted in by the main surgeon to do any (inside) tummy work, etc.
</p>
<p>
Problem with this for the patient is the surgeon doing crucial work is unvetted and unknown to them (probably never even get to meet them before or after) - plus the patient doesn&#39;t have a contract with the second surgeon if anything doesn&#39;t go to plan.

If you have to question this I think it’s better to find a different surgeon. In Korea it’s go so bad there’s hospitals who video the entire procedure so you can check who the surgeon was afterwards.

Depending where you live, check out transop.com, they are out of Guadalajara Mexico. Dr Cardenas and his team are great!! You can find results from them on other subs

I was screwed up in Kamol for good with my BA which needs to come out and be fully fixed. Long term prospect is not good here because of bottoming out, double bobble and damages they did to the nerves. PPV srs is a scam there and in March I will find out what is actually happening inside. Other procedures were more or less below average. So yeah, Kamol - stay away if you can. More I read about Thailand, more I am thinking about where I do go to fix this mess. It looks like it is normal practice in Thailand to cover up damages, do false advertisement and falsify the documentation and procedures details. Cannot trust anyone there tbh.

What an absolute ordeal to have to go through, I&#39;m so sorry they did that to you! But it is wonderful to see you finally getting the results you deserve, it is so important for our dignity 💜 I hope the fat transfer exceeds your expectations 🌈

Thank you so much my dear. Re dignity, exactly, at times I felt so totally ashamed of how I looked - and so many dreams and deep level desires seemed broken and beyond realization.

Image captions (as are partially hidden above):
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surgery #1:
</strong>
Dr Burin discharged me like this pretending all was good - and then gaslit me for nearly a year claiming the prolapse was to do with weak pelvic floor muscles (and so had me doing pelic floor muscles). As if. [For ref, studies show that avoiding prolapse is helped by having a laparoscopic surgery, rather than open.]
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surgery #2
</strong>
(revision): A further example of Dr Burin&#39;s masterful hand! It might look like he solved the prolapse issue, but inside, it was a total bodge (he just tied up/compressed the prolapse tissue (which he couldn&#39;t excise) with sutures. With this revision, Dr Burin had a chance to correct the dreadful aesthetics from his first butchery - but for some reason, he didn&#39;t have it in him and/or didn&#39;t care.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surgery #3:
</strong>
Dr Kamol this time. Kamol took no notice of what I explained about the issue (in writing) and instead played the &#39;super cool high-flying surgeon&#39;. After disregarding what we agreed in writing, he then barefaced lied to me about he&#39;d done more than one time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surgery #3
</strong>
(second image): At least Kamol did improve the outer aesthetics especially the clitoris area. But as above, after disregarding most everything, he barefaced lied to me about what he&#39;d done inside (which was basically nothing in terms of why I went to him and what was agreed - even of the surgery paperwork documents). Like he claimed several times with a straight face that to solve the prolapse issue, he&#39;d sutured the canal to the bladder (which it turned out he hadn&#39;t at all - not a single suture).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surgery #4:
</strong>
Complete removal of canal segment and replacement with PPV canal by a new/different skilled and professional surgeon. Further surgery on aesthetics. Still blisters as only a couple months out.
</p>
<p>
Re future, I&#39;m planning on some fat grafting so as to create more defined labia majora. Everything looks okay though (better in real life than the camera for some reason), which is little short of a miracle given the previous surgeries.

First of all I just can&#39;t express how much I feel for you in this situation and I&#39;m so happy there&#39;s light at the end of the tunnel ❤ But I am just floored, I&#39;ve been planning on booking with Dr Burin this year as I&#39;d only ever heard good things but even just hearing about the administration expirence has me worried now.

My guess is, Burin&#39;s potentially skilled at PI. It&#39;s so much more straightforward and safer - and in line with his surgical capabilities. After I&#39;d been setup as described above, I should have stopped the train - and gone for PI instead, presuming I decided to continue with Burin.
</p>
<p>
If you reference this thread, it might be a good time - as in I would hope it will &#39;encourage&#39; those involved to do better.
</p>
<p>
Another important question for an SRS surgeon - I would ask them exactly what style of neovagina would work best given my physiology and what there is to work with - and in line what they consider they are best at. And insist on seeing multiple surgery outcome images.
</p>
<p>
I found Thailand (most surprisingly) to be a very hierarchical society, where many surgeons believe they&#39;re like gods. Most patients from their own country are thus probably very subservient. But until the monies are handed over, the power is with the patient. If doing again, I&#39;d wait until the last moment before an op to pay - and be willing to walk away and lose any deposit if things aren&#39;t completely up to scratch.
</p>
<p>
PAI had me pay into private individual accounts offshore (in Singapore) - which didn&#39;t feel right at the time.

Hopefully this sub and patient reviews will balance that out again. These surgeons rely on foreign patients and currency. If they get a bad reputation their income will go down. And vice versa.

I was wondering if it was a first, as had never heard of it being done before - and several surgeons wouldn&#39;t touch me. It was fortunate the sigmoid-segment hadn&#39;t adhered to the rectum wall and/or any other organs. It took the surgeon ten hours though.

I am considering having the sigmoid colon technique with Dr. Sutin, Do you think it is a good idea?
