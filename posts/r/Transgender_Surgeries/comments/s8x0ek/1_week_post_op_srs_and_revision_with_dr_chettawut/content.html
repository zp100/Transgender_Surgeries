If you want I can show you pics of what I looked like at two weeks and what what I look like now. It’s very drastic. Don’t worry or stress too much because that makes it worse.

I could also show you how swelling could look like in comparison just look at the first pics In
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/K1jHCVI">week 1</a>
and the last pics in
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/leGyMiL">month 3</a>
. Sadly imgur won&#39;t let me upload more recent pics right now, but my kitty looks even better then the latest pics I shared.
</p>
<p>
Give her some time to heal :3
</p>
<p>
Edit: if you wanna see more of the healing I&#39;ve made thread about the first 4 weeks and then week 5 to 10

It will look so much better in two months. 2 weeks post op is when most separation happens and it gets much better in the coming months. Don’t listen to rude comments made by people.

It’s where stitches come apart and the wound starts exudating yellow stuff and blood that can be confused with an infection. It’s called dehiscence.

Nobody has said anything rude. Chettawut told me it was beautiful and I feel so gaslighted because any pictures of my vulva make me cry.

Chettawut has seen this thousands of times, and can likely picture extremely accurately what the end result will look like.

On further reflection I removed a bunch of it. You&#39;re comment attacking Chettawut would be ok if it were in a review or in response to a post asking about choosing him, but its insensitive and potentially harmful in this context. Insulting other users here is not ok.

Oh I’m sorry I thought someone else called it ugly..I don’t think it’s ugly. But I’m two months post op and felt very down and depressed because mine looked worse than yours. You might just heal beautifully.

I feel sorry for you, but how do you expect it to look after 7 days?
</p>
<p>
do you know what he had done with your genitalia? It is called reconstructive surgery, it always looks cruel in the beginning until it healed fully. Look at people who had a nose job how their face look in the first week: like someone punched them to death. And 1 year later they look beautiful.

A surgeons perception of beauty is different from what you typically use the word for.  They are usually referring to how the site looks - for the time frame it is following the surgery - and how that relates to their experience with the overall healing process.  His statement really is about how it is healing thus far.
</p>
<p>
As far as the end result once you are further down the healing path, I would have to say you will almost certainly be happy.  This is not an easy thing, and it takes a great deal of strength and fortitude  to have gotten as far as you have.  Hang in there a bit longer.  I know it doesn&#39;t look like what you have visions of in your mind, but it will get there.  As with all aspects of our journeys, patience is the key.  Chet has very consistent results, there is no reason at this point to expect that yours will be an exception.
</p>
<p>
Hang in there, and know that there are many of us here to talk with when you need it.  This part of your journey is complex, but you got this!  💜💜

Because a surgeon who has done this many times can look at someone who is swollen and in recovery, as you are, and know what the final outcome looks like.  His experience means he can look past the swelling to see the final results.
</p>
<p>
You ARE beautiful, you are just in surgical recovery right now.  This is temporary, give it time.
</p>
<p>
Edit: fix spelling

Maybe he means that the *immediate* results from surgery are beautiful. Give it more time! Keep an eye out for complications but it might be too soon.

The person she is replying to has had SRS with Chettawut.
</p>
<p>
I pray with every ounce of my heart that everything will turn out fine for her and she will be happy with her SRS results. I really, truly do.
</p>
<p>
But I also know he&#39;s not infallible and has many flaws.

I don&#39;t think literally anything can be operated on and look amazing the very next day or even a week afterward or hell even a month. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be pretty satisfied with your results.

Because he&#39;s a plastic surgeon and normally they can tell great results in the making 😌. Or if they&#39;re a horrendous surgeon they&#39;re blowing smoke up your arse. But Chettawut is reputable so probably the first one..

Or he would just rather lie to your face than have a difficult conversation.
</p>
<p>
Before anyone swarms me with downvotes, for those of you who have actually met the man, how many of you have ever had him be upfront and initiate difficult conversations? Or even Som for that matter?
</p>
<p>
Both of them find it easier to just tell you that &#34;everything is fine your vagina looks beautiful!&#34; and hope you fuck back to your country ASAP.

When a surgeon says their work looks beautiful during immediate recovery I think they mean it looks healthy, no sign of infection, the stitches look tidy and should leave minimal scarring, and the goal of the procedure was probably accomplished and won’t need revision. Basically it means there’s nothing about it that worries him, and you are healing as expected.

Stop gaslighting me. That is not ok. Why do you think the wounds are well approximated and everything appears to be in the correct anatomical positions?

You’re only 1 week post op, any and all surgical sites will look scary after such a short amount of time. As it heals the wounds will close and the swelling will dissipate and you will be SO much happier with what you see.

Mine didn&#39;t actually say beautiful but ....
</p>
<p>
At day 1 it &#34;looks good&#34;
</p>
<p>
Day 5 &#34;healing nicely&#34;
</p>
<p>
Seven weeks it was &#34;a nice looking vagina&#34;
</p>
<p>
He is probably just trying to make you feel a bit better.
</p>
<p>
I know it&#39;s crap recovering while having hormone withdrawal and being in constant pain or just uncomfortable. Even going to the toilet is stress. But hey, now you have a pussy and it will heal in time.
</p>
<p>
One day you might actually like it or enjoy it. Try to concentrate on the reasons you had it. Maybe it&#39;s because you didn&#39;t like the old parts or maybe it&#39;s because you can now wear tight clothes ? Whatever it is try to look at the positives, try not to get depressed.
</p>
<p>
You have been through possibly the worst week of your life and it will get better. Big hug xx

sorry you&#39;re not feeling well about how things went.
</p>
<p>
one week is... pretty early.  i do have things i&#39;m curious about from the pictures.  i&#39;d send the pictures (after taking another of the right side bottom part) and ask again his opinion about how he&#39;d expect it to heal and discuss again post-op care instructions.
</p>
<p>
my ex (who i still spend a lot of time with) has had a bunch of major surgeries and some of the post-op results were... kinda.... well, we called them Frankenstein after one bad looking cranial scar.  But they all (so far, they&#39;ll need more surgeries in future) came out okay.
</p>
<p>
The only surgery i had (throat) seemed like it was healing badly and the scar tissue adhered to the bone.  But its mostly resolved on its own already.
</p>
<p>
So it might be that in time all that will heal quite normally.  But I&#39;d still send pics to him.  And asking for post-surgical care instructions will put him into the mode of thinking about his craft, rather than reassuring a patient... so more likely to get useful feedback.

Bear in mind that the surgeons see it right after it’s done as they close you up, and some see you in the weeks after.
</p>
<p>
They are looking at what it should look like at that time. They are very familiar with stages of healing, and if the surgeon, (this one in particular, especially as their work is known to be good) says that. It’s because it’s healing exactly as it should and you’re going to be please with the outcome.

To my untrained eye, it looks like the main visual issues at the moment are swelling and the stitches, but both of these are temporary and to be expected after major reconstructive surgery.

Given it was yesterday, I&#39;m gonna guess that the doctor&#39;s idea of &#34;beautiful&#34; includes his experience. Like yeah, I don&#39;t think any reasonable person would call it beautiful, but he probably has an idea of how vaginas look the day after surgery and a year after surgery. Just give it some time, it&#39;ll be alright

I think all areas directly post op are unattractive in that they are swollen wounds / injuries. Whatever you want to describe it as. It’s not supposed to be pretty right now. It has to heal &amp; the stitches have to come out &amp; the swelling has to go down. It’s a process. It’s not a parts factory where you come out end result. It’s going to be pretty. It just needs to heal &amp; have some time right now.

Fuck Chettawut. He said the same gaslighty shit to me even when I was 3 years post op. I looked like a fucking sliced open pomelo and I had some fat mound on my crotch. And this fucker has the nerve to say to me,
<em>
&#34;bUt yOu LooK sO nAtuRaL AnD WoManLY&#34;
</em>
.

I do pray for you sister that with time, you will heal properly and you&#39;ll be happy. But if it&#39;s been years and you&#39;re still unsatisfied, then for the love of fucking god,
<strong>
do not return to Chettawut for a revision
</strong>
. That fucker cannot admit that he made a mistake and will just fiddle around then gaslight you. I have only 2 regrets in my entire life, and both of them are Chettawut. Fucker.

The docs see a lot of &#39;em, and in all stages of healing. He would know.
