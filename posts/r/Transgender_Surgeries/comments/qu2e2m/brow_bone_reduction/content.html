It is normal. Itâ€™s one of the downsides of a coronal incision. The hair will not grow back. Maybe you can change your hairstyle a bit to cover the missing hair. Or you can get hair transplants to fill it in.
</p>
<p>
A frontal hairline incision has its own separate set of downsides since the scar will be more easily viewed from the front. Those scars (if they donâ€™t disappear) may also need to be covered with hair transplants.
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s one of the downsides of FFS and surgery in general. Incisions from surgeries always create scars, and we should make plans to manage them.

Yeah I&#39;m planning on the frontal hairline when I do my ffs. I actually really want bangs myself so I think right before I go in I&#39;m going to go get bangs.

I&#39;m not aware of any evidence saying that the severity of the scar and its implications are any different between hairline and coronal.
</p>
<p>
Personally I figure if you&#39;re going to get one I&#39;d rather have it across the top.

Feeling scared. Have FFS scheduled in about 6 weeks, only now starting to think about the actual process and looking at during surgery photos. You are happy overall that you did it? Not looking forward to this large scar and hair loss.

Yes I had FFS and Iâ€™m very happy overall that I did it. My surgeon used a frontal hairline incision and fortunately for me the scar healed very well and is practically invisible. But I also had surgery from other surgeons on other parts of my body and the scars didnâ€™t heal so well there. Scar healing depends a lot on the surgeonâ€™s skill, your own body and how it heals from scars, the location on the body of the scar, the aftercare treatment for the scar, your age, and ethnicity. But even if my FFS scar was more visible, I would still be happy overall. FFS made the biggest positive impact in my life compared to all other surgeries.

Just confirmed that I will have the same incision. Happy to hear about your success in recovery - I could likely be slower to heal due to age (just guessing).

I am assuming they have to shave off a bit of your hair too?

I have a scar like that too, though one side of my skull looks like this and the other has a smaller scar.

I&#39;m confused. If this is for brow bone reduction then why is there a scar on top of the head? Isn&#39;t brow reduction done under the eyebrow?

The make an incision across the top of you head and peel the skin down to the eyebrows. I find its not to think about it too much.

I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen people with incisions underneath the eyebrows and I thought that was for the eyebrow bones. Why would they peel back your whole forehead to get to your brows? ðŸ¤¯
