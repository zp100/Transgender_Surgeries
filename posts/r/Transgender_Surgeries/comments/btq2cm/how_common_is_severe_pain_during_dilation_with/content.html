There is a big thread on asktransgender right now about a girl who has severe pain, that almost makes dilation impossible. I think there have been a few comments to similar sentiment over the last few weeks, and there wasn&#39;t much info on the wiki. Any idea how common such complications are? Is it something that is mostly limited to the Thai surgeons? I have my own coming up with dr. Bank and am low-key scared at the moment.

I had SRS with Dr Bank in mid January. The first month, in Thailand, was fine. The second and third months were fucking horrible. Month 4 was when things started to get easier again. I&#39;m now in month 5 and life is mostly back to normal.
</p>
<p>
The best advice I can give is this: make a good friend and talk to them about all of the troubles you are having. Having support makes it so much better!

I&#39;m not finished healing, so it&#39;s not completely in its final state yet. That may take a full year.
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;m very happy with it. My doctor is quite impressed too!

Months 2 and 3 are when most people are experiencing the worst of scar contraction. Although, many people get it for longer.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got a tiny bit of granulation that I&#39;ve been putting hydrocortisone cream on. It doesn&#39;t hurt or anything, just looks angry.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery until now? What made you choose Dr. Bank over suporn? Do you recommend Dr. Bank? And how do you conserve your results in terms of cosmetics, sensitivity and depth?

My recovery is going well! I&#39;m back to bike riding too! First 3 months were incredibly difficult, but things got a lot better.
</p>
<p>
I got a Dr Bank date by chance. I applied for any of about 30 dates. He&#39;s very good though. I absolutely recommend him.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetics are great, as is sensitivity although my left labia majora is a bit numb. Depth is 16cm.

I had SRS with Dr Chettawut. Dilation was painful in the first few months but got easier over time. I just used some lidocaine gel when it was too painful and that would alleviate whatever pain I had.

Yes. You can order it from the nurses that visit during your recovery. I found it useful for the first few weeks during a dilator size increase.

No problem at all. In the first month I&#39;d put a little bit down the sides of the dilator and at the tip before inserting it. After a few weeks or so I only really had pain along the stitches at the base of the vagina so I&#39;d put a little lidocaine gel around the vaginal opening before dilating.

I&#39;ve heard of it a few times with Suporn, but it doesn&#39;t seem common. What does seem to be common is a long recovery process, and its not much fun. Suporn says on his website its double penile inversion and it seems to be true.
</p>
<p>
You hear about bad problems of various from all surgeons, but with a few exceptions its not common enough to say with any certainty if they are better or worse. I&#39;ve been collecting stats on rectovaginal-fistual as a few surgeons publish them and I believe its related to the surgeons skill. Its also a really bad complication. Most surgeons seem to be around 1% with a few higher and Suporn 10 times lower. No numbers for Bank yet.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know why it is, but in the wiki notice that the number of links/photos for Suporn is really large compared to almost every other surgeon. I pay attention to Suporn, but not to the extent that it would make so much difference. His patients seem to be very vocal and I think thats&#39;s going to bias the number of negative reports towards Suporn.

That&#39;s Suporn&#39;s published stats on that but he has a lot of things that present as fistulas but aren&#39;t from what I&#39;ve seen in my research (there have been ~5 cases on the facebook group afaik, but eg they were from the blood tube vent used to circulate blood to the area becoming infected).
<br>
I think because Suporn is advertised (and in many spaces seen) as the best in a believable way, patients who go to him tend to be more selective which leads to more results being shown/etc. as people want to contribute to the literature (like the suporn PDF person - I actually rewrote the short pamphlet they give you while I was there also ...). He also has probably the highest number of completed surgeries, which adds numbers for sure.

I wish people would publish more in the open, especially negative experiences. I&#39;m sure its not on purpose, but hiding things away on Facebook doesn&#39;t help anyone else.

I&#39;d never thought of that, but its the most plausible explanation I&#39;ve heard.

<p>
The pamphlet you mentioned, is it online anywhere? Are they using it?

From what I&#39;ve seen most people having negative experiences just ... don&#39;t really know where to go, or they go to the support groups (which are private discord and facebook groups, and as such not super visible from the outside).
<br>
They aren&#39;t using the bits I rewrote - I just looked back at what I wrote (hadn&#39;t seen it since I was there ...) and specifically I rewrote the dilation instructions. They&#39;re really vague in the actual pamphlet. I gave it to them but they didn&#39;t seem too interested at the time (they were going over a little staff turnover afaik when I was there, and were dealing with other issues, and also they maybe just didn&#39;t think it was generally necessary). I&#39;m the type of person who needs to know exactly what to do, and if there is allowed imprecision, I need to know that also, so I just bothered the nurses (while not fully remembering their names, I&#39;m sort of terrible with names) until I got enough information. It&#39;s not online, I can post it on pastebin or something if you&#39;d like.
</p>
<p>
... A lot of what I&#39;ve seen seems to hint at Suporn coasting on reputation a little bit - I saw a few issues that other people had that made me very worried about some types of things and Suporn&#39;s ability to diagnose and help those things (specifically infections, but also just a general vibe). But ... I didn&#39;t have to use pain medication at all which makes me a rare case for sure, and my recovery has been relatively smooth so I don&#39;t really have personal complaints. I do have some odd observations about my vagina (it feels like it&#39;s a number of different overlapping canals in there almost - I didn&#39;t know anything about vaginas beforehand so it&#39;s still super weird to have one and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s &#39;weird&#39; and what&#39;s &#39;normal but I&#39;ve never had it before&#39;, lol).

I&#39;m going to edit it to handle dynamic dilation better and will post it, either on pastebin or somewhere else, I&#39;ll let you know. I wrote it before I actually started dynamic.

I&#39;ve seen hypergranulation mentioned several times. I wondered about this as well, since where I live there are long waiting times for gynecologists, and it&#39;s the GP that takes care of uhm issues of the feminine anatomy

I think severe pain is quite uncommon, but dilation will get gradually harder up until month 3-4 due to scar tissue forming around that period. After that it supposedly gets better. Haven&#39;t had SRS myself, but know many that do, and I&#39;ve read a lot. I think it&#39;s a very much YMMV thing overall, depends on how receptive you are to pain, and how well recovery goes.

Makes sense. At least I&#39;m mostly good with pain and a bit of a masochist so it should be surviveable.

from experience difficulty and pain can go very up and down (especially if you get random colds during the recovery period). It hurt a bit months 1/2 (I had a cold for the majority of that time), then basically stopped for a while, and now it hurts again (I caught another cold and didn&#39;t immediately realize I was sick but I 100% noticed the pain during dilation). The step down from 2x/day to 1x/day was more severe in terms of discomfort than I was expecting.
</p>
<p>
It really varies though. I don&#39;t think pain to that extent is super common, I would put it from what I&#39;ve seen at maybe 10%? There is a lot of pain though, and doing the work every single day gets extremely taxing.
