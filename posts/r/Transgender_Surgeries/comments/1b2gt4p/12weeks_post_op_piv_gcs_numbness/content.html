What is the longest anyone has gone before they regained sensation? Iâ€™m 12-weeks post op and am completely numb. I have no sensation in the clitoris or labia. I donâ€™t need to hear stories of how people had sensation immediately. Iâ€™m looking for some comfort and reason to have optimism during a horribly difficult time. Did anyone regain feeling after 3 months and how long was it?

Small amounts of sensation at 12 weeks, but nothing special. Didn&#39;t get sensation start to return properly until 6 months, Now at 13 months and have more sensation than I did 2 months ago.

<p>
Healing takes a long time, but if you are concerned do talk to surgeon/PCP

My surgeon wonâ€™t answer my questions because there were problems during surgery and they seem embarrassed. They wonâ€™t tell me why things went wrong or what happened because I donâ€™t believe they know. They avoid me and blatantly ignore specific questions. I feel like I am in this completely alone at this point. I talked to a psychologist who support my surgical team today and they said my case is unique and they donâ€™t know what way to proceed and that I should find another surgeon. Soooooooo, Iâ€™m horribly depressed and in this alone.

Your PCP should be able to request information from the surgeon as to what happened and what went wrong.

No one knows so I donâ€™t think there is any documentation to look up. No one knows. I was given 15cm of depth during surgery. They took out the packing and there was only 7cm of depth. Magically gone. No one knows.

Kinda normal to loose depth tbh. That is a lot though.

Yeah, 54% gone immediately. They are pretty closed mouth about what a revision looks like and how it can be fixed. They seem embarrassed or unsure of what went wrong so they donâ€™t tell me anything. Then they tried to tell me 7cm is more than enough for receptive sex. Iâ€™ve been extremely depressed

I can feel things. Iâ€™m 12 weeks. About 1.5 weeks ago my swelling reduced quite a bit and I got more sensation then. I still have undissolved stitches near my clitoris making touching it uncomfortable. Swelling can occur for 6 months, and thus affects sensation. Iâ€™m not worried about it, but my mind is increasingly more sexually frustrated. I was told to massage and explore myself. Itâ€™s supposed to kind of wake up the lazy nerves to get them to make the connections they need. Iâ€™d say to do a lot of that to see if that helps. Donâ€™t Panic darling, and donâ€™t get down on the posts about 3 week orgasms and largest dialator posts, those arenâ€™t most peopleâ€™s experiences especially for girls my age.

Thanks. Sounds like our surgeries were close together. Iâ€™m technically 11.5 weeks. Surgery was 12/12/23. I was told to explore a month ago, and still, just completely numb. I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m swollen or if thatâ€™s how things are going to be. My surgical team and I have bad communication.

My surgeon told me swelling could take up to 9months to resolve and that seems to hold true so far as I still got a good bit of it at 6months ðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping the swelling is what has been impacting my sensation as that makes sense
