Iâ€™m 13 days post-op from vaginoplasty and I had it done in Chicago at Rush. The surgery went well, and the doctor had to do skin grafting from the foldings between my legs but The only concern I have is that I have numbness on my left leg, and itâ€™s not going away. Iâ€™m starting to get scared. The doctors said that as I move more, it should start to feel better, but I don&#39;t feel any change, and I move a lot more now. Anyone else experienced this?

It&#39;s normal. I cant tell how long I had numbness but it faded away over a long time. In cold conditions it was worse

I had sudden perineal and vulvar numbness in the 4th month and it never returned to normal. It&#39;s been 29 months.
</p>
<p>
I had recovered ALL the sensation at 2-3 months,  and then.....suddenly lost it all at the 4th.  Totally UNEXPLAINED.
</p>
<p>
The body is full of nerves,  the Pudendal, the genitofemoral..... can be involved in SRS complications. Look for those, the are  graphic examples of motor and sensation neural pathways.  You could research,  but please DON&#39;T ASSUME anything that Google suggests.  It can get better with time.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll follow this post,  so keep us updated please ðŸ’œ

I had surgery on October 17 with a different surgeon and  have had numbness in my right thigh ever since. It has gotten better with time but is still numb and has occasional burning pain.

What has your surgeon said about it? That definitely sounds like a pinched nerve from them rotating your hip/leg during surgery

Surgeon has been a bit dismissive and said it should likely resolve with time. Not a lot can be done about nerve issues unfortunately. Iâ€™d recommend getting up as quickly as you can do so safely after surgery and making sure to get up out of bed a few times a day during recovery. I think my issues was most likely from being bed ridden due to complications for the first few days following surgery.

They had to do skin graft from the folding between my legs and pelvis on both sides.  My initial thought was that probably a leg nerve was touched  but the doctor said they didnâ€™t and that the numbness sometimes happens, but obviously Iâ€™m still concerned.

Can I ask how quickly you got back to physical activity. Lifting stuff like groceries, Hoovers, household items etc and did you get back to driving soon too? If you drive. Thanks in advance.

I had an infection early on in recovery, likely because I had to stop antibiotics in the hospital due to severe nausea, but even still I was up and doing things for myself within 2 weeks. Driving I did before I was supposed to because of the infection but that was in the third week (I felt okay doing so because I did not take any narcotics after leaving the hospital on day 8 post surgery so I had around 10 days of just Tylenol/Advil but I recommend following your surgeons advice unless necessary). Doing short trips for groceries or a few small household tasks wasnâ€™t too bad by the third week.

I lost sensation on the top of my head after ffs. It happens itâ€™s not the end of the world. You get used to it. Sometimes sensation can return very subtly.

Is the numbness in the spot they took the graft from, or somewhere else? I had a spot on my thigh that would sometimes be numb, and occasionally hurt like fire. It seemed totally random, but then I realized that I had been putting all my weight on that spot on the corner of my mattress whenever I would roll out of bed. I started avoiding that spot and it has gotten less frequent, so hopefully soon it will go away

The numbness is on the front part of the thigh.  The skin graft is in the folding between my legs and the pelvis.

Could be a nerve block, could be sciatica, or could just be funkiness.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how your surgery was done, but the same thing happened to me. It took a few weeks for the feeling to return

The could have had you in a strange position, probably used nerve blocks, and any number of other factors.
</p>
<p>
Still though; it should improve with time
