My urethral opening is more like a quarter sized coinslot than a pinhole like the surgeon&#39;s diagrams always show. At the very least this seems like the normal result for this particular surgeon (Bowers), but do most mtf surgeries produce pinhole urethras? Or at least urethras smaller than a dime? And is there any possibility of a revision to get my urethra looking like that of natal vaginas?

Mine looks the same as what you described. I went to Bowers too.
