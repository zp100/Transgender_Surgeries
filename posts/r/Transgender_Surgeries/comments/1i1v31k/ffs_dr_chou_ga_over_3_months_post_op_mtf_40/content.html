This looks good. I assume that you are happy with the results. I see the change in hair parting. Did you do any grafts?

Thanks! ☺️
</p>
<p>
I am very happy with the results. There are things I still don’t like but they are soft tissue/fat things and not anything specific to the surgery itself. I’m hoping between weight loss and HRT those will get addressed. If not Dr. is happy to help. Going to give it a year to settle and if there are still problems talk to the Dr in 2026.
</p>
<p>
For the hair, no, I didn’t do any grafts. That is all natural. The way he did the incision up there is apparently really good for hair regrowth through the scars and at my 3 months follow up he took pictures of the scars specifically to show students why he does it the way he does.

Recovery wasn’t bad, at least not as bad as I was expecting it to be. The first week was a little rough. I slept for most of it or maybe watched a little TV, but always made sure to stay elevated. Tried to stick to softer foods just because of the numbness making it harder to eat. I eat apples pretty frequently and it took me about 2 months before I could bite an apple again. By the second week though I was feeling alright and could do a lot more.
</p>
<p>
As noted, I didn’t need any pain meds past Tylenol. The majority of the swelling was mostly gone by the second month, same with most of the numbness. Coming up on 4 months the feeling on the top of my head has mostly returned, but that was the last thing to come back. The only thing left from the surgery that I feel anymore is the tightness inside my mouth near the bottom lip where the incision for all the jaw/chin work was. Not painful or anything, just tight, but not problematic.

One thing I forgot to note, this was all covered by insurance.

Looking at FFS (brow lift and brow contouring) with Dr. Chou in April. Debating on doing a Hairline advancement or not. Already did a tracheal shave and neck lift with him and very happy with the results.
</p>
<p>
What all procedures did he do for the upper part of your face? From other comments it didn&#39;t sound like you did a Hairline advancement?

Hey! I would be really interested in your results on the neck lift. That’s something I’m considering after loosing weight and giving hormones a little more time to work.
</p>
<p>
I did have hairline advancement in addition to frontal cranioplasty, orbital rim contouring and a browlift.

I have a post with my results after a few weeks and will be getting my 4 month pics soon!
</p>
<p>
The scar placement seems really good for the advancement (can&#39;t even see it on the pics) and that was a concern for me.

Yeah, the scar was really noticeable at first right after surgery but it has healed really well and the technique he uses has it actually in the hairline so when the hair starts growing back it helps to cover the scar.
</p>
<p>
Thanks I will take a look! In the vid I posted there are some pics right after surgery where you can prominently see the hairline incision.

Yes, thanks. I assume this is your surgeon?
