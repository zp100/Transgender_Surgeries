I&#39;m about 4.5 months post op with Schechter and my vaj is sensational! Things were very numb for quite awhile but sensation returned gradually and I&#39;m having a very exciting time of things!

Things started waking up at about 1.5 months and sensation increases daily with moderate maturation and dilation even still. I had my first orgasm recently and several since then. It&#39;s getting more pleasurable and easier to orgasm every day. There are still some numb spots but they are less so every day.

Pretty good.  He&#39;s kinda hands off during recovery, but the nurses are 10/10.

Agreed. I saw more of another surgeon in recovery, and the nurses were awesome.

I would go to him but I can&#39;t pay out of pocket for electrolysis and that&#39;s what he requires... insurance will cover it but where in the heck can I go in the state of IL with bcbsIL medicaid? I&#39;ve got all the letters and everything I&#39;ll ever need lol

Do you recall how long Dr. Schechter requires you get electrolysis for? Couldn&#39;t find that info on his website.

As far as time goes... he requires the hair to be removed. That&#39;s totally a ymmv situation depending on how much hair your have, how long of sessions you do. How effective they are as well. Theres variables no one can answer until you start. But general consensus for the particular area is between 6 to 10? Passes with laser. I&#39;m not sure what that equals out to in electrolysis

Thanks for the reply.
</p>
<p>
Its quite confusing to me because surgeon&#39;s website I&#39;ve seen that post the info for electrolysis state it as a number of months (I&#39;ve seen anywhere from 3 - 12), and I always wonder how many hours that it&#39;s based on. The electrolysists I&#39;ve talked to have given widely different answers ranging from 1 year to 3 years and hourly estimates ranging from 30 hours to 300 hours.
</p>
<p>
It may be that it&#39;s just really hard to estimate but yet for some reason surgeons websites seem to be giving much lower estimates so if Dr. Scheichter gave one I was curios what it was, one more piece of data.
</p>
<p>
I wish I could just do laser but 30% of the hair in my SRS prep area is grey and has to be zapped. I would that that lasering off the 70% would reduce the electrolysis time significantly there would be less hairs to zap but electrolysits don&#39;t seem to agree with that for unclear reasons.
</p>
<p>
Just venting a bit.

I&#39;m sorry your having issues with laser, but yes depending in how many follicles you have, would depend on the time. There was a clinic somewhere that sedated you and did a one full clear and then you came back and supposedly  could clear you in up to 4 sessions but I can&#39;t find them yet. Also, it&#39;s out of pocket and not exactly cheap but not super expensive either. So here is to good hope for you hon!

Thanks for the well wishes!

<a href="https://cirinespa.com/mtf-genital-electrolysis/" rel="nofollow">Cirine

in Chicago does the sedation clearing. I did a consult with them and for genital clearing for SRS prep it was around $10k. I wasn&#39;t super excited about the cost or how painful it sounded like it would be. The person I met said the anesthesia they give you is to help manage the pain of all the lidocane shots they give you to numb the area, and even with that she said the shots are very painful.

That&#39;s almost as expensive as going overseas and having it done for 12k full grs... jeeze... I didn&#39;t think it was that much.. that is disappointing..

Lidocaine injections don’t need to be painful. Using sedation instead of doing them properly is ridiculous.

You can do laser as long as your hair is dark enough and it removes it in the area. But yeah... I&#39;m going to work on getting reimbursed already ahead of time too. It&#39;s a thing..
