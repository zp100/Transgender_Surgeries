Had Vulvoplasty with Dr Whitehead through Northwell Health in NYC on July 13. I am beyond amazed with Whitehead as a surgeon and very happy with my results so I felt that I needed to share since I&#39;ve not seen much of his vulvo/vagino-plasty work on here.
</p>
<p>
For those who might ask, not for a moment since the surgery have I wished I did vaginoplasty, I&#39;m very happy with vulvoplasty (even as someone who plans to be intimate with penises in the future)

Observations and Advice:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Get lots of the recommended gauze. Buy extra and apply (with vigilance) the bacitracin. I went through like 5 tubes  Get comfortable underwear and pads
</li>
<li>
Take rest seriously. Even if it means more work from home or time off. Even if it means using a walking stick. Don&#39;t sit longer than your approved for.
</li>
<li>
Get a bullet vibe for when you are approved for it (listen to the doctor on the when)- I&#39;ve had some great experiences already and can&#39;t wait to see how things are once everything fully settles and reconnects. I had what I would believe is an orgasm, and it was incredible (even if it&#39;s hard work to get there).
</li>
<li>
Northwell was overall really great. Comfortable stay at Lenox Hill. My main headache has been my insurance being a pain in the ass after they told various offices that I didn&#39;t need pre-approval and now are asking for all sorts of approval.  I was in the hospital for three days. Bed rest for two.    (Also I brought a razor and makeup....it may have used all my energy each morning, but I wanted to look nice)
</li>
<li>
Ask for people&#39;s help, and have people to talk to; it makes it easier to make it through the long journey that is recovery.
</li>
<li>
By far the weirdest part of recovery was the &#34;perma-tuck&#34; phase where my brain was figuring out what nerves were doing, and it just felt like the tightest strangest tuck in the history of the world.  Overall, the brain figuring it all out has to be the most fascinating part of things.
</li>
<li>
Take pictures so you can appreciate how amazing it all is. (And maybe even find friends you can send pics to them to celebrate with.)
</li>
<li>
Phases of my healing:Week 1- &#34;Woah this is so weird.&#34;Week 2-3 slog of wishing it would get better quicker and thinking the low level pain and uncomfortability was worse than the initial big pain. Lots of nerves reconnecting.Week 4-5: Thinking you are better but then also &#34;why cant i be more active?&#34;Week 6: huh guess this is it for now...accepting low energy.Week 7: oh theres some energyand by week 8 I&#39;m really feeling mostly &#34;back to normal&#34;
</li>
<li>
The catheter pressure in the bladder really sucked the most of the early pain.
</li>
<li>
I&#39;ve got about 2 inches of &#34;depth&#34; obviously not a canal, but still great.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Open to questions, though have a busy work schedule so may take me a second to reply.

Additional points-
<br>
11) The first things that I remember happening when I woke up were asking &#34;why does it feel like i have to pee really badly&#34; then i went back out of it. Then the next time I asked if it was okay for me to fart. which they approved lol.
</p>
<p>
12) I honestly wouldn&#39;t say I had the worst genital dysphoria, and its amazing how much better i feel mentally on the other side of things.
