16 weeks post op SRS PIV with Ashley DeLeon @ The Crane Center @ Austin TX For a while I was feeling devastated of my results because of how everything looked early on. I can say after 16 weeks it’s looking soooo much better. Still got a lot of swelling and granulation tissue going on. No sex yet.

Yes it’s been such a huge difference! I truly believe I was botched for the first 2 and a half months but now that I’m 4 months I see the light. I tried having sex for the first time but it was but painful and my partner couldn’t get it in. A little disappointed from that.

I’m using the second dilator which is the blue one but I cannot insert it if I do not use the first dilator which is the purple one. It’s hard to get the granulation tissue dealt with cause Austin is a drive. Haven’t found a gynecologist that’s trans friendly to go to.

Really? Took 2 months to get it taken care. I have only done one treatment so far and that was a month ago. My surgeon is about 4 hours away so it’s so much harder to find someone to drive me down there. Thank you!

Yeah that will be hard to accomplish with the place being hours away. I have to do every month for silver nitrate. Maybe when I start working more I’ll be able to go easier since I’ll be financially more ready.

Yeah I&#39;ve had granulation tissue issues since month 3 still have sizable piece on my clit. I just travel 3-5 hours each way to my surgeon&#39;s office when I can. Lost my job in November making care even more difficult.

Yeah I have it around the canal entrance and has been a big issues since month 2. Started treatment last month and hoping to go back soon for another round. But it’s frustrating the back and forth and with no gynecologist that are trans friendly in the area makes it harder to visit one.

Same-ish. I keep  rescheduling with my wife&#39;s gyno cause w/o insurance just the initial starting cost is $300 and for $100 plus travel I can go see Parker although it hasn&#39;t been as effective as seeing Dr.Deleon. Also Parker hurts me keeps jamming that thing into space where my uretha is and I barely feel thing with her.
</p>
<p>
I need switch PC physicians cause my initial one pre-op has become obviously uncomfortable with my care post surgery.

Yes! Exactly! No one talks about how hard it can be to go back to your surgeon for minor or any complications when they aren’t close to me.

It is probably normal, white substances are fibrins or dead skin cells which are expected in the process of healing, and they disappear on its own in time. You should consult your surgeon anyway.

Yes I plan to do that. Do you think the white stuff would diminish overtime or be conceal with actual skin tissue?

I’m so beyond happy with my results and cannot wait to be even more healed and be able to finally use it for sex. It’s been a strain in my relationship cause we both want it but we both are being patient to enjoy it.

Ugh yes waiting is terrible. We have even thought going back to anal but don’t want to damage the vaginal canal or not sure if that’s even a great idea. But we are planning to wait cause it’ll be worth it.

Yes I am so beyond impress! I was not expecting to heal like this after all the complications I had and so much granulation tissue. Functioning works well. The only problem is it’s hard to stretch the skin on the entrance of the canal. Specially dilating with second blue dilator. And sex too. I tried to have sex with my partner for the first time yesterday and it took so long to get it in but once in it felt like he couldn’t get further in. It was painful an uncomfortable. We are planning to maybe wait another month or 2 to heal up more and allow that entrance to become more elastic to stretch the area easier.

Thank you! Granulation tissue is excess tissue growing from your skin healing over skin. It’s all the darker red around the entrance of my vaginal canal. It’s a very common thing that occurs in most vaginoplasty surgeries.

Yeah. It’s crazy because April 10th will be 6 months post op and that’s crazy to think about. It feels like I just had this surgery.

Also on the last picture it shows a lot of white below the granulation tissue and by the opening of the vaginal canal leading in. Is that normal for it to look like that? Was planning on emailing my surgeon regarding that information.

I had white stuff like that for months. They told me it was normal and would reduce over time before going away which it did. But do check with them.

Oh your result from her are amazing. I&#39;ve had issues and honestly even at 10 months mine done by her isn&#39;t that good. My canal seems like separate part from my vulva and I&#39;m not super happy about that. Not saying that&#39;s her fault every case is different.

Yes result very from aftercare, person to persona healing, fruits and juices, surgeon. She was my option number two due to Min Jun being sooooo long to get my surgeon done by him. Definitely beyond happy with my results. Maybe could benefit from a revision if your not all satisfied with your results.

Hi, I had tbis surgery about a year ago, I lost 4 inches and am still having to dilate to get it back. I only have a little over 2 and a half now, im not sure, I just know the dilator won’t go up to the first dot. I’m scared and desperate, can you tell me about your experience or link me to someone who can help me?

Tbh dilated has been a bitch. No other way to put it. I have tried Pelvic Floor Therapy and that has. Helped a little bit but unfortunately not a lot. I have stayed figurously on my dilation schedule and still have lost an inch. I would post your issue on the Reddit and see if someone has some better advice than I do. I’m looking into a Revision for PPT

No one has been really that helpful to me. I get the feeling that the surgeon I go to is a psychopath and doesn’t give a shit about my pain levels or outcomes past what gets him money. I’d like to keep in contact, this experience has been horrifying and extremely extremely isolating, no one treating me has any concept of what I’m going through because they’re ALL relatively vain cis people. I lost 4 abd a half inches initially and have been able to only get an inch and a half of that back. The people in the office kept telling me that’s normal. Ithwasnt. I was in pain all day y every day. It was and still is a nightmare and o feel very alone. The doctor I went to was in Nj. The surgeries he does look nice and work well, he just lies to you about the recovery and gives you bad dilation instructions and clearly doesn’t care whether you actually get better or not once he gets his damn money. I lost half my vagina because his staff didn’t give enough of a shit to take care of the issue while it was happening until it was far too bad. The physical therapist I ended up going to was the only one who actually gave a shit about my recovery and didn’t ignore the LITERAL 24/7 pelvic floor spasms I was experiencing that made dilation not only inseparably painful but also ineffective and caused even more spasms. The pain was 24/7 chronic for over two months. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t even walk. They told me it was normal at that fucking office.

I would suggest if having that many complications looking to a more well experienced surgeon to do a ti vision between 9 months to a year. I plan on having some cosmetic revisions and posible a whole new canal if my does not become more stretchier and if I loose more depth. Was thinking of going the PPT route.

Trust me I was not expecting these results from seeing how things were back then. I am so proud of my healing. Also thank my job for giving me 4 months off to be able to fully recover. Also make sure to everyone who gets this surgery to have plenty of water, tons of fruits, juices. I also recommend starting juven to help further heal and produce new collagen.

Ashley DeLeon is the best surgeon I have ever dealt with! Super happy with her. Her nursing staff is horrible and have a lot of miscommunication so I always just ask her to contact me for the information I need. I hope everyone can get a result like mine or even better. Wish I had better depth though.

Oh gosh your pussy looks better than mine and we went to the same surgeon! Lucky girl! I can relate to the early worry and results looking bad, glad we were able to heal up nicely. It’s been 21 weeks since my bottom surgery.

Yes I’ve been trying to get into pelvic floor therapy but there aren’t many specialist that are trans friendly in the DFW area. So it’s been hard. I’m hoping the more I research someone will pop up. Self conscious to go to just anyone.
