It took me a minute but I’m finally posting here (no pictures sorry, but hopefully this is helpful for someone). I got a brow and jaw reduction, scarless tracheal shave through the mouth, cheek implants, rhinoplasty, forehead reduction and brow lift, and orbital shave with Dr. Rahul Seth at Golden State Dermatology (SF) in November 2023 and I am incredibly happy with the results a year out.
</p>
<p>
I was referred to Dr. Seth through my personal champion at Cigna (a gender affirming care focused representative assigned to you that will help you with all the paperwork and give you any other information you need on how to find providers). I live out of state but was able to do a video consultation with no wait at all and then have my in-person pre-op appointment and surgery scheduled back to back for a little over 3 months out. Ultimately I was able to drive to and from Colorado and get an Airbnb for a month all fully covered by Cigna and had to pay about $4000 out of pocket for the surgery and the hospital room.
</p>
<p>
Notably in addition to my reference photos and the 3D scan of my face we also used pictures of my sister which she was happy to supply to keep the sibling resemblance as best as possible which I thought was cool! Dr. Seth is very relaxed, charismatic, and didn’t push for anything I didn’t want, so I went into everything feeling great about the procedure.
</p>
<p>
Overall fantastic experience at USCF’s Mt. Zion Hospital with consistent care. I also had a fairly easy recovery helped by quick communication from GSD. The worst parts of the experience were an excruciating 30 minutes where I couldn’t effectively communicate to the nurses that my catheter wasn’t working and I couldn’t go, almost passing out when getting my nose stents removed, and norco making me vomit all day the one time I took a half pill (I really didn’t need it for pain but I had hoped it would help me fall asleep which was an issue for a good week whether due to mild pain, blocked sinuses, or the constant tingling of nerves coming back to life in my face). For the norco issue, GSD quickly got me anti-nausea medication thankfully.
</p>
<p>
Other problems included only being able to breath through my mouth for a few days leaving it raw (cough drops were quite handy once I could open my mouth wide enough to fit them in a few days after surgery) and not being able to focus on anything or have any light in my eyes without excruciating pain due to the swelling around the eyes. Audio books really saved me here and I was able to go for a short walk around the block five days after surgery, but I always had to go out with an umbrella or super wide brimmed hat.
</p>
<p>
A little over a week after surgery my cheeks, nose, and chin were starting to peel like crazy as if I had a sunburn, but I was already quite happy with how I looked as the swelling started to go down! I could look at screens, but the eye strain made it impossible to focus on too many knickknacks or signs while I was out all day at this point going to museums and sightseeing (taking a couple days rest in between the big days).
</p>
<p>
Three weeks out and I was feeling fully recovered and ready to get back to my life, but I still had no feeling around my mouth and chin leading to food falling out of my mouth sometimes and staining my clothes. I felt like a baby for a good while, but at some point after around 7 or 8 months I finally got all the feeling back. At four weeks the swelling and bruising were no longer noticeable and once my hair grew in I never even thought about the incision along my hairline anymore. I attended a wedding six weeks out and no one could tell I had just had surgery outside of you know . . . that I looked very different from the last time they saw me! Later that night at a bar with extended family for the first time in my life had some man come up and tell me I’m the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen . . . got what I paid for I guess. Anyway, life is great! Highly recommend Dr. Seth.

Thank you so much for your write up! I live in San Diego, CA yet in my researching had not come across his name…between your review and the before and after he has become an immediate one for me to strongly consider! I’m also very impressed with even how thorough his website is with terminology and the face drawings of procedures! Sounds like I need to verify they are Cigna ppo in network for 2025 and go from there!

I&#39;m so glad you found it helpful! And yes his website and resume were quite reassuring to me as well.

I&#39;m glad to hear that! The scarless tracheal shave was definitely a high priority for me as well.
