UPDATE. Since initially posting this, I&#39;ve heard of and talked to probably 10-15 more women that have had results exactly like mine from the Kleinberger/Shih duo. I think at this point I&#39;d say it&#39;s an avoid if you can possibly help it situation. Keep in mind that Kleinberger and Shih are Kaiser&#39;s MOST experienced FFS doctors, so any of the Sacramento or SoCal doctors are possibly worse than they are. If you&#39;re considering them for surgery, look elsewhere If you can get other insurance and pick a more reputable surgeon by all means do it. Kaiser is a waste of time. Don&#39;t go through them for FFS!

</p>
<p>
Original post from June of 2020:
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve debated the necessity of posting something like this for a while, but I&#39;ve decided that even if it helps one person to advocate for themselves and explore what FFS options are out there and which surgeon really supports them best, then it&#39;s probably worth it. I don&#39;t mean to scare people away from KP (Kaiser Permanente) but if you opt for Kleinberger or Shih or any of the other people that they&#39;ve employed you should really know what you&#39;re getting into.
</p>
<p>
I had FFS surgery with Dr. Kleinberger and Dr. Shih almost 3 years ago and I&#39;ve been very dissatisfied with their work. The procedures they did and the details of them can be found in my original post about the surgery here:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/7aedo0/ffs_with_kleinberger_and_shih_at_kaiser_norcal/">https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/7aedo0/ffs_with_kleinberger_and_shih_at_kaiser_norcal/
</a>
</p>
<p>
You can see throughout the thread that over my 6 months of updates (as the painkillers wear off and the swelling goes down) I get increasingly dissatisfied with my results. (I actually liked how I looked better BEFORE the swelling went completely away, which was somewhere around the end of the first month) What you don&#39;t see is that I&#39;ve been going to 6-10 more visits over the course of the next 18 months with Dr. K and his staff and each time leaving in frustration as I try to explain my issues with the surgery. Every time I went to see him, I was shown my before and after pictures while he talked about what a dramatic difference he thought he made. I felt like I was being gaslighted, as all of the changes are so subtle. For instance, my nose is now a different shape, but the projection is still basically the same. He didn&#39;t eliminate my brow. My jaw looks ok, but the surgery caused some weird bunching on my chin that never went away. I eventually needed to pay out-of-pocket for a second opinion from Dr. Deschamps-Braly&#39;s office in SF. This is what he had to say taken directly from my consultation note. Keep in mind this is AFTER I&#39;ve already had one 7+ hour FFS:
</p>
<p>
<em>
&#34;Her hairline is still high at 71 mm all the way across. Her forehead is still overly projected at 14 mm. There is evidence of hardware in place in the forehead from previous frontal sinus osteotomy. The nose is a little bit large with a 34 mm tip projection. The dorsum is over projected as well. Her upper lip length is long at 18 mm. Her chin height remains tall at 48 mm. The width is appropriate. She has a bit of a bunching of the ball on the tip of her chin, likely would benefit from a submental chin ptosis or chin tuck procedure. Additionally, she would also benefit from a thyroid cartilage reduction as she still has a prominent thyroid cartilage and a little bit of submental fat.&#34;
</em>
</p>
<p>
So after putting myself through one major surgery, and several office visits, I&#39;m left to wonder &#34;why did I even bother? What did Dr. K accomplish AT ALL!?&#34; When I took these notes to his office, ONLY THEN did he admit that he can&#39;t do what I was asking him to do. I really wish he could have admitted that before hand, so that I could have dropped Kaiser and done more research or started saving for someone better. Having him operate on me will only make my revisions take more time and be more costly. I&#39;ve wasted 2 years of my life on this organization.
</p>
<p>
Now, it&#39;s mostly my own fault that this happened. I should have paid attention to the red flags that came up. His limited history, lack of patients, few result photos, the fact that his teacher was Speigal, etc. In hindsight there&#39;s so so many. But I was so excited that I could finally have an insurance company cover something that might help to relieve my dysphoria. I&#39;d never had a real health insurer, not to mention one that covered any trans care before. I was a DIY transitioner for years, so all of this seemed beyond anything that I thought was possible. I think I actually thought that KP had my best interests in mind. Now I feel like an idiot.
</p>
<p>
The story doesn&#39;t end there. In my attempts to get a revision, I was flat-out denied by Dr. K&#39;s office and his professional opinion was that the revisions I was seeking were purely cosmetic in nature. I needed to drive to Sacramento to see Dr. Alex Facque, yet another doctor in the KP FFS pool who no one has ever heard of (beginning to see a pattern here?) He at least confirmed Dr. DB&#39;s assessments and said that a revision would be reasonable and justified in his professional opinion. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be working with him. Fool me once, shame on you... In any case, I&#39;ve researched all of KP&#39;s FFS surgeons now, and I&#39;m sad to say that their credentials are beyond disappointing. None of them is certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties as a Plastic or Reconstructive Surgeon. None of them have crainofacial training. They&#39;re all ENTs with some inflated sense of ego and some minor training in plastic surgery. It&#39;s a joke really, and not a very funny one. KP makes such a big deal about having trans centric clinics and physicians but is essentially asking all of its trans FFS patients to go to unqualified surgeons.
</p>
<p>
In my research, and while struggling to figure out a way to have insurance cover Dr. DB. I&#39;ve made the realization that there are almost zero standards for FFS or trans care in general. It&#39;s such a niche area of surgery that we essentially all get misled and pulled in so many directions. There&#39;s no certification for FFS. There&#39;s no necessary training to do this, so just about any loser who&#39;s done any kind of facial surgery can claim to be able to do FFS. I&#39;m so lucky I got nothing out of this instead of being botched when I think of it. It could have been so much worse.
</p>
<p>
I suppose that the point that I&#39;m trying to make is that KP doesn&#39;t employ surgeons with the proper background to do this work. You may get an OK result with them if you begin with features that are already more feminine than most trans women. But keep in mind that they&#39;re not capable of doing the things that they say that they&#39;re able to do. Ultimately the decision is yours, and I understand that not everyone has many options. But, now you can&#39;t say that you didn&#39;t know. I really wish I had done my homework more thoroughly before I went to Dr. K.
</p>
<p>
Edit 6/4/2020: Updating this post to say that I&#39;ve now had a real consultation via video chat with Dr. Alex Facque at KP NorCal Sacramento. He seems more honest and also seems to genuinely think he can accomplish a better result for me. Nice sentiment and all, but still no result photos and little experience to speak of. I did find out that he plans to be ABMS certified in PS by the end of the year. So maybe he&#39;ll be better skilled than Dr. Kleinberger. But I&#39;m not going to take a chance. At this point in his career it seems like he&#39;s assisted with quite a few surgeries but has only completed around 10 FFS as the lead surgeon. He may end up being a good surgeon one day. But for now I think I&#39;m going to pass on this option and continue to look for someone with more experience. He also works with Dr. Kenneth Phillips who has some seemingly impressive PS credentials and DOES have ABMS certification. He&#39;s also the Head of Plastic Surgery at KP Sacramento. This may be a viable option for Kaiser&#39;s trans patients in the future. There is a post at Susan&#39;s by someone who is very happy with her results, but I&#39;d need more verification than that to continue.
</p>
<p>
Edit 8/25/2020: I&#39;ve recently heard through the grapevine that Dr. Alex Facque is leaving KP Sacramento. So much for having a possible good FFS option at Kaiser.

As someone whose FFS was botched I feel your pain. There are some things that my surgeon promised he could that he just didn&#39;t and other things that he really messed up that require revisions. It&#39;s buyer beware when it comes to FFS and plastic surgery in general. Plastic surgeons overpromise because there are no consequences for them not delivering. They always revert to saying &#34;results are not guaranteed.&#34; And in the end we end up signing our lives away just to get on the operating table because if we don&#39;t then no one will operate on us.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I want to challenge is your assertion that being trained by Spiegel is a red flag. In my opinion there are a few excellent surgeons practicing today that were trained by Spiegel including Rolfes, Keojampa and Mardirossian.

Rolfes has great aesthetics I think. I would have gone with him if I was in the US.

You have posted a message similar to this about Dr. Rolfes multiple times in different message strings.
</p>
<p>
He claims on his web site to be:
<br>
&#34;. . .  an expert in all things related to cosmetic surgical and non-surgical treatment options.&#34;
</p>
<p>
What does that really mean ?   Normally it means he is, as someone else said, a jack of all trades,  which is part of the problem the OP encountered.
</p>
<p>
In another promotion on his web site, Dr. Rolfes claims that he &#34;has done more FFS surgeries than any other surgeon in Minnesota.&#34;    That state is not really known to be a location where very many girls go to get FFS.  So far as I know there is not a single report of a surgery by him posted on Reddit.

I’m having a consultation with a Spiegel trained FFS surgeon—Dr. Kuperstock, but I don’t see any results or reviews about him online—his website or reddit. But yeah I also tend to think being trained by him can be a good thing

I suppose we just have a difference of opinion there. It&#39;s a red flag for me because I wanted someone more aggressive. I&#39;ve always thought that Speigal&#39;s results were &#34;meh&#34; most of the time as he&#39;s generally more conservative than other surgeons. Obviously being overly aggressive isn&#39;t good either though.

The sad truth is there are fewer than a dozen safe and experienced FFS surgeons in the United States. I&#39;m not a patient of Spiegel&#39;s nor am I promoting his work. I just think his students should be judged based on their own merits.

<p>
can you source this? Who are their surgeons? How did you find credentials and which credentials surgeons should have? Ditto for training.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a kaiser patient and waiting in line for bottom surgery which i&#39;ve heard lots of positive things about in LA. I haven&#39;t made up my mind with FFS but have told my therapist that I was interested it. I thought that when it came to it, I&#39;d meet the surgeons, ask questions, ask to see their results, and see how I feel.

At minimum these surgeons should be Board Certified Plastic/Reconstructive surgeons through ABMS which is the main credentialing body in the US. Some of them have this certification as ontolaryngologists, but that just means a doctor than specializes in head and neck surgery. There&#39;s usually little to no cosmetic training involved, but some have a vanity plastic surgery credential. None of them have undertaken a crainofacial fellowship like Dr. Deschamps-Braly for example so their work on your forehead will be a soft touch at best. You can search any doctor&#39;s name to check that credential here:
<a href="https://www.abms.org/verify-certification/certification-matters-service-for-patients-and-families/">https://www.abms.org/verify-certification/certification-matters-service-for-patients-and-families/
</a>
</p>
<p>
You can also find their CVs and experience online by googling their names. I won&#39;t link to them all. KP&#39;s &#39;My Doctor&#39; portal is a good place to start but it&#39;s vague as fuck.
</p>
<p>
The doctors I&#39;m talking about are at KP NorCal: Dr. Andrew Kleinberger, Dr. Charles Shih, and Dr. Kathleyn Brandstetter. I don&#39;t see any of these credentials listed for them. Doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re bad surgeons for the general population. But they don&#39;t have the proper skills for FFS.
</p>
<p>
Regarding SRS, I went with Dr. Ali Salim through KP. He&#39;s pretty good, but he&#39;s literally the head of plastic surgery at KP Norcal. I wouldn&#39;t have trusted any of the others. I&#39;m reasonably satisfied with the results.

As someone said above, CVs don&#39;t mean everything. But when picking a surgeon I want someone who&#39;s at least had to adhere to higher standards, and I want them to be trained in aesthetic reconstructions, not just utilitarian ones, you know?

A few of the top FFS surgeons out there (Keojampa, Mardirossian) were trained by Spiegel. I don&#39;t think that is inherently negative...

Atleast you didn&#39;t get botched. In my case, I&#39;d have preferred to look pretty much the same as before with subtle improvements. But not only was my jaw and chin obliterated to almost nothing he also gave me permanent discoloration, a bump under my chin, dimpling skin and an odd face shape. My chin looks like someone took a bite from the sides. This damn surgery made me in short ugly, numb and depressed.    And to know that he is an alcoholic even scares me more as I did oddly question in my head if he was drunk during my surgery to think I needed this much reduction.......

From the video made by some American transwoman Christine Christy. I posted the video in this sub. She said in the comments that he always had red nose cause he is a heavy drinker. I don&#39;t know if that has had an effect with his inconsistent results and botched jobs to date. I remember reading somewhere also mentioning he has some sort sickness. No idea if it is true or what it is but it&#39;s worrying and sort of makes you question, is that why he messes up so bad at times? It sort of makes sense somehow as much as I hate to admit it he did produce good results but why he fucks up so many times too compared to other surgeons is so odd. And with his arrogance it is almost impossible to reason with him when things go wrong.
