Was the no eating/drinking thing just cause it was colon or would it have been the same for any surgery? I&#39;m booked in with them for ppt next march and I&#39;m kinda nervous 😅
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s amazing how many positive reviews I see about Dr theerapong and amani though. And I can already agree about Saphira, she&#39;s been a huge help so far

Yeah it’s just for colon pretty sure. They don’t want you to poo I believe it wasn’t fun but it’s definitely doable ☺️ she’s great isn’t she

I’ve also heard the ppv recovery is kind of harder the dilations starts straight away where as I had a week of rest when I got home and dilated after 1 week. And it was so much easier than my first surgery. In theory dilating sounds like it’s an okay chore but it took up my life for so long with my first surgery.

I think I heard some girls with ppv were up and moving around comfortably after 5 weeks which was a factor in my decision. I dont like the idea of being debilitated, I was playing tennis less than 2 weeks after ffs 😅 (not advised)

I just don&#39;t wanna be out from football (soccer) for too long 🥲 were you able to see much of Bangkok while you were there? Worst part of ffs recovery was being in Brighton as a queer vegan and being stuck in my hotel room unable to eat anything bigger than a bean 😂

Yeah I saw a lot of Bangkok. Being up an about after a week you could probably go back to soccer when the month of recovery is over

I wish there was more information out in general. I think for the number of patients Dr. Theerapong sees their marketing could be kicked up a notch, but maybe he has more work than he wants just from basically work of mouth.

Honestly he has so many patients he does local girls half the week and foreigners the other half I have heard, I don’t think he really cares to promote himself anymore. Also the worst surgeons in Thailand like kamol and some other have such good marketing im always more suss on clinics that have amazing marketing….his TikTok has probably more videos u can watch and they’re translated.

I dont think he needs it, Saphira told me when she booked me in that she was struggling to find dates in February when she was booking them only a few months in advance before and it keeps getting busier. I think their reputation is gonna make it a lot harder to book with then soon. Or at least push up the waiting times.

I’m in for October. Last couple of appointments for hair removal (elected electrolysis) and getting tests done in a week or so for HIV and blood. Packed my case already, just need to pick to up and throw it in the car and I’m set.
</p>
<p>
I’m now working through the “this is big, keep it together!”

I don’t know currently. I arranged everything in 2023. Prices may have changed. Best to reach out to them for current pricing - they don’t bite.
