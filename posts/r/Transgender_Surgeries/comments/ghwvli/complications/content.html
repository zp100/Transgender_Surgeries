I have heard of people who had underlying genetic conditions that hurt healing (something/danvers syndrome) and could be an underlying factor.
</p>
<p>
Who was your surgeon and are they not being cooperative?

Were these all prior to the revision you had in June?
</p>
<p>
Not much advice I can offer, this is beyond my scope of experience with the same surgeon - I hope things come through quickly for you with Ting or BBL, I think that&#39;s the best move going forward.

Oh boy I’ve heard she had gone downhill in recent years but thats pretty ridiculous that she would do that to you. Its very obvious that there was an issue. I know early dehisions do heal up really well but yours clearly did not. Check out Dr Wittenberg (my surgeon) she does a lot of revisions since bottom surgery is the only thing she does. Her and her team are also really good with communication and she is very Very realistic about outcomes and expectations.

Totally. I had some separation, but very minor in comparison and it healed on its own. Did end up having a revision for another issue that isn&#39;t completely resolved though. With the exception of the staff, I found it easiest to coordinate with her over text - I can imagine the emailing dragging on.

Ehlers danlos is what you&#39;re thinking of I think? And yes it can effect healing quite a bit

Yes! There was a girl on the trans surgery sub that had that and it took her a very long time to recover

Omg thank you for sharing this.  Most of the time separation does go away on its own but to not even add a stitch or two under local anesthesia is insane. I can’t imagine what you had to go through in terms of pain. My sitz baths were bad enough. You got this

I have had experience with extremely painful dilations almost consistently since my surgery in September. Although through a short and light treatment of betamethasone, medihoney, and a barrage of silver nitrate treatments things were getting better. And then my parts got all angry again, due to what my surgeon suspected to be a yeast infection. We treated that with Monostat and it got better. And then it got worse again—the dilations still painful. It wasn’t until I started chucking all of my KY lube with fucking sorbitol that I had been using the entire time that my dilation pain started to ease.
</p>
<p>
Your situation, however, looks completely different and absolutely awful. EDS looks like a distinct possibility here. I’m surprised that Bowers wasn’t absolutely alarmed at those photos. Maybe she was and just didn’t say anything. There’s obviously something going on there...maybe she reacted the way she did because at that point in recovery there’s not a whole lot that can be done? I don’t know, I’m not a surgeon. I’m sorry you’re having to go through this. Dilation pain and continued complications that far out from the recovery cycle really isn’t something anyone should have to deal with.

You should try to contact more surgeons to gather more info about what can / should be done. Also it might be worth trying to contact Marcio Littleton in Brazil. He operates both in Brazil and Portugal and he&#39;s really famous with his corrective surgeries of SRS from other surgeons.

Do you have any links to Littleton that are not in the wiki? I’ve been able to find out very little about him.

Unfortunately I don&#39;t. I have had a consultation with him a few months ago and seen some really good results, but I couldn&#39;t have the images. Other than that, the Brazilian community is really skeptical with sharing their results (with Brazilian doctor or not), I really don&#39;t know why.

I’m sorry but I have to ask, do you have diabetes or any clinical conditions related to your immune system or blood flow? I want to understand why bowers was reluctant to do the revision.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of necrotic tissue in those photos too. She very likely was waiting to see how it healed / spread over time. From a medical standpoint the stitches would be the least of her concerns. It’s more of an issue of “do we need to remove the necrotic tissue or will it be fine”. If she did hypothetically stitch you back up and the necrotic tissue was ignored it could have been very bad.

I would start contacting more surgeons, and try to get a consensus of plan of action. Then go with the surgeon you feel the most comfortable with.
