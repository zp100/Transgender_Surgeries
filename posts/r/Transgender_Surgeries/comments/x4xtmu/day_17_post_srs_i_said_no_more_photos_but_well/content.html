It may be necrosis, but there have been a lot of people come through this sub with various levels of the same and things turned out fine. It sounds like your treatment team and your surgeon are communicating to get you the best result with the least intervention. Adding more surgery trauma to this may not be the best solution. Regardless, this isn&#39;t what you anticipated, nor is it pleasant, and that&#39;s the most difficult part of this kind of post-surgery experience -making the adjustments and simply not knowing what to expect. It&#39;s extremely difficult and emotional at a time when you&#39;re both physically and cognitively vulnerable.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll get through this. It sounds like you have quality healthcare and open communication with your surgeon. Give in to the healing process, and follow their instructions. There are a lot of phases to healing from SRS. It&#39;s a slow rollercoaster at best as your body adjusts to everything. You aren&#39;t in terrible shape for 2 1/2 weeks out.

Hey. It looks like the irritation is coming down a lot. It looks so much better than it did a few days ago. I know youve been through hell with this but stick in there! Its going to look and feel amazing once everything is healed up.
</p>
<p>
I hope the people around you are taking care of you. Youve got this &lt;3
