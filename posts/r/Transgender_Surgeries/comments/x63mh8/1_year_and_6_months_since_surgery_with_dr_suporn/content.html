Woooow just wow, your result is very good (one of the best results I have seen), you have what I would like to have after my SRS, for results like these I am considering having my SRS with Dr. Bank (and then having revision surgery)

I think the revision surgery made a huge difference for the final result!

I saw your result before the revision surgery (and it was pretty good), but you are right your result was much better with the revision surgery

Your results looks like some other planet level..

Would you mind me to ask you why do you decide to do this painful surgery again?🥺

I&#39;m not sure what you mean by other planet level. I did this surgery to feel comfortable in my body. I&#39;m very happy with my choice. Sex is also much better for me now.

Oh sorry I meant yours look like super another level of results i&#39;ve seen so far!!
</p>
<p>
I hope to have surgery from Dr Bank 😭😭
</p>
<p>
May i ask you a question? As people now looking PPV for it&#39;s somewhat convince lubricant texture or colon but the i heard that Dr Bank doesn&#39;t do the both.
</p>
<p>
I am wondering why people doesn&#39;t consider the skin graft while looking for PPV or colon..

It was abnormally fast because of covid. The clinic restarted doing surgeries and I was lucky to come from a country that was allowed to travel there at the time.

It is by far a very subjective matter, but I will give it a try:
</p>
<p>
Sensation: 5 Aesthetics: 4 Depth: 4
</p>
<p>
I have full sensation. I wish I didn&#39;t have scars and the visible difference between the types of skin. I had 19 cm depth, but dilating became so difficult I lost 3 cm, which I miss.
</p>
<p>
I also wish I pissed straighter!

I have had a lot of sexual experiences by now. PIV sex is very enjoyable. I did anal before and loved that, but to me vaginal sex feels better. It feels better suited for sex. I still enjoy anal tho.
</p>
<p>
I have yet to have an orgasm from vaginal penetration alone, but I have felt feelings there which I believe would make me orgasm if explored further.
</p>
<p>
Orgasms from clitoral stimulation are amazing. I can have as many as I want. It never stops being good. I&#39;ve had more than 10 in an hour. I also enjoy these orgasms more than any I had before and I get incredibly wet after.
</p>
<p>
The size of the penis matters a lot for my enjoyment. I am relatively tight even though I plan to dilate myself wider. At this time my diameter is 4 cm. This is often not enough where I live. Too big penises can be quite painful and requires a lot of time for me to fit them.
</p>
<p>
Receiving oral is good as long as they don&#39;t overstimulate my clit which makes it more sore and I lose enjoyment.
</p>
<p>
Sex feels very natural to me and I absolutely love it. It is infinitely better for me now than it ever was. It feels natural. However, I was extremely dysphoric and did not use the old equipment at all.

Nice result… seems to me that you and I probably had surgery around the same time. I am also a Suporn patient… one of the last. And had my surgery 2 1/2 years ago. Dr Bank did my revision

I don&#39;t know the current rates, but I paid about 23000 euro for the whole trip including everything. And another 3000 ish for the revision trip. I think it absolutely was worth it for me, but you have to make that decision for yourself.

I&#39;m down to a few times a month. I didn&#39;t dilate for a month after the revision and I didn&#39;t lose any depth.

Was this done under local or general anaesthesia? If local, was that painful?

The first operation was full general anesthesia lasting about 6 hours. The revision was local anesthesia lasting maybe one hour. It wasn&#39;t painful and I could have fallen asleep. Only once during the revision did I feel a bit of pain and then I just told them and they applied more anesthesia.

I&#39;m sorry for necroposting, but I&#39;m curious if inside the labia it looks natural? I&#39;ve seen some results with PIV where the urethra is quite large and the clitoral hood is less than satisfactory. I don&#39;t need pictures or anything, I&#39;m just curious what you think. Suporn would be my first choice given some of the technique, and this is the best revision I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m jealous.

I&#39;ll post something soon where I&#39;ll include the inside of the vulva. It looks a bit different. The urethra is a bit bigger, yes. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s as big as what you&#39;re thinking of, but it&#39;s bigger than natal. In addition, we have the Chonburi flap which will look very different from natal. Furthermore, the clitoral hood is different. Instead of there being a separate hood and the labia minoras coming from underneath the clitoris, the labia minoras work as both clitoral hood and labias. I will post a picture soon where all of this will be visible. Tbh, I would want as natal of a result as possible, and in those regards, I&#39;m not happy about my results. But having said that, the results are pretty amazing and my pussy functions amazing. I have had no complaints about it and partners think it looks and feels great, so there&#39;s no point of dwelling on it. It&#39;s still pretty amazing that it&#39;s possible to get to this point. All in all I&#39;m very happy about how things have turned out.

Thank you so much for your reply. I guess I feel shallow sometimes because aesthetics feel so important to me. I really, really appreciate your honest thoughts on it. Thank you again.

Looks like an excellent result, congrats!
</p>
<p>
I am hoping to have SRS with Dr. Banks. If you are up for a question, now that you are 2 years post-op have much has your dilation frequency reduced and has the time it takes to do them reduced?

I have basically stopped doing dilation. It doesn&#39;t seem to matter anymore for me. If I do dilate it doesn&#39;t take a long time. Sex feels great and I don&#39;t lose depth.

That&#39;s great to hear! I am happy for you and hope I get a similar result. I know it varies a lot but glad to know this outcome is possible.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s rare to talk to somebody 2 years post-op, I really appreciate you taking the time to reply. Thank you!

<p>
I have one more question if you have time - since Suporn Clinic is a out-of-pocket deal, I was wondering if you&#39;ve had any issues getting insurance back home to cover routine care with gynecologist etc.?

Of course! I&#39;m happy to help!
</p>
<p>
I live in a country with free health care, so insurance is not really a thing. I&#39;ve been to a gynecologist once and I was treated well. I don&#39;t know how things would be in other countries, but this seems to be the case in Europe - where I&#39;m from.

If you have time for one more, I have a question about recovery. From what I&#39;ve read some people&#39;s recovery is quite a bit more difficult than others. I was wondering if you noticed if it was older people who tended to be the ones with more difficulty? I am 47 years old and am trying to get a sense for how much of a factor this may be.

From what I could tell, age did not make it more or less difficult. Some young people were struggling a lot more than older people. I think it has more to do with luck than anything else. But I&#39;m not an expert, and the surgeon would be better suited to give an educated answer.
