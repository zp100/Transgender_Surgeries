I went to facial team about a year and a half ago.
</p>
<p>
In Australia, they do regular (yearly) visits to Sydney and Melbourne. They did a four hour information session where they talked about the surgery, the techniques they used, the research they were doing, and answers many questions from trans women. They then had fifteen or so minutes private consults after where you could get advice on your own face. One of the best things about this conference was seeing people who had recently had surgery and some who had had it years ago. I highly recommend going if there&#39;s one you can get to.
</p>
<p>
I went with FT for a few reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
They were the only surgeons I could find on Reddit with literally no negative stories about them
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They are actively doing research into improving the effectiveness of FFS and so are basically on the cutting edge
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They use a surgical team with their own specialisations meaning you get the best of everything and no tired surgeon mistakes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They sponsor some trans women in Spain every year to have FFS for free. I mean they make bulk but that&#39;s still pretty good.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In my private consult the surgeon told me some of the things I was thinking needed work didn&#39;t, even though I wouldn&#39;t have taken convincing and it was money in the bank for them.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I ended up getting nose, brow and forehead, and a tiny bit of chin and jaw done. Theres other minor things they did as well like around the eye and lip. Altogether with flights from Australia and semi-private accommodation and a few other things it was around 35K Australian which is around 26K US i think?
</p>
<p>
Pre surgery, consult was good, spoke to the surgeons directly over Skype, they were absolutely lovely, kind and patient. I was stunned having prior experience with surgeons being absolute arrogant wankers.
</p>
<p>
When I got there, had some final checkups and then it was happening pretty quick.
</p>
<p>
When I woke up the pain wasn&#39;t too bad, honestly the cannula was the worst part haha. There was one bad moment that was mostly my fault and could have been easily fixed if I just called a nurse.
</p>
<p>
All the staff were lovely and particularly some of the nursing/reception/patient liaison staff were funny and kind and helped me get through it.
</p>
<p>
Recovery wasn&#39;t too bad, I didn&#39;t get hair work though and I know the surgery and recovery is a bit tougher if you do so.
</p>
<p>
I was on the border of being able to deal with pain with paracetamol but ended up getting tramadol and took them for a few days and then didn&#39;t need them. Eating was awkward and sleep wasn&#39;t great for a few days. Pretty much just watched Steven universe haha.
</p>
<p>
I was well enough after three or four days to go to the shops and explore Marbella a bit, absolutely beautiful town.
</p>
<p>
Getting stitches out of my dome was probably the most painful part but it&#39;s just stitches and I&#39;m a baby!
</p>
<p>
I flew home about 8 days after, flight to Aus sucks but was bearable. On the flight home was the second time I male-failed in my life and though it was probably mostly due to swelling it was one of the best moments of my life.
</p>
<p>
Had to wear a fabric mask for a few weeks after, though could take it off for a bit after the first week and week three just at nights.
</p>
<p>
I had some bruising but probably three weeks post surgery could go to coffee without heaps of weird stares. Still swollen but not a monster haha.
</p>
<p>
Six weeks in I looked relatively normal and was passing a lot of the time (when I don&#39;t talk). I went back to work around then. Three months or so my face was probably 90% of what it looks like now.
</p>
<p>
A year an a half later and with some makeup practice I pass I&#39;d say 95%+ of the time when I don&#39;t talk and frequently people assume I&#39;m a cis woman with a weird ass voice. Presurgery when I presented female it was probably 50/50  There&#39;s things I&#39;m not happy with about my face but they definitely did the best that could be done and a most of it is related to just having a big skull which is impossible to fix unless you wanna lose some brain. Haha.
</p>
<p>
They followed up frequently and I had absolutely no complaints - I would recommend them very highly.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask any follow-ups and I hope things go out well for you! I&#39;m two years out from bottom surgery and I know how agonising it is to wait...

One of the things people often say about them is that they are conservative. You say you pass 95%, so do you think that&#39;s something that could be improved with a more aggressive surgery? Being conservative might reduce the risks of things going wrong, so thats a positive.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard a few complaints about them, probably all related to the nose. I suspect that&#39;s normal though, noses are apparently difficult.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m thinking of going with them myself. I&#39;ve meet heaps of women who&#39;ve been to hem.

Honestly I think it is an individual choice between conservatism and a &#39;natural&#39; looking face. I had heard a few people call them conservative and also heard that they had recently gotten more &#39;aggressive&#39; too.
</p>
<p>
For me I doubt I could get much higher than 95%, most of the problem is a big skull and they couldn&#39;t really do much more without making my skull too fragile. I also have a family of big, ski bump noses and asked them not to be too aggressive there because I didn&#39;t want to lose that connection to my sisters (even if that&#39;s dumb haha).
</p>
<p>
Their philosophy is that some FFS surgeons focus on making the same, idealised feminine feature eg nose on every face, where they try to make lots of little changes that add up to that feminine effect. They&#39;ve also done research into the &#39;gendering&#39; of faces and what causes a face to be read female.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t necessarily think one philosophy is bad or right but identified more with theirs than others.
</p>
<p>
I can DM before/afters if anyone&#39;s interested

I hope my head size I&#39;d not a problem. It&#39;s on the very large side. Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever noticed it as a gender thing.
</p>
<p>
Im more interested in passing and looking more attractive than I am in maintaining any connection to what I look like now. I never really understood that. Having said that, it&#39;s not why I&#39;m interested in them. They seem very reliable, few problems, excellent care, etc.
</p>
<p>
The women I&#39;ve seen go to Facial Team come back looking almost the same, and yet female. When you try to work out what&#39;s changed it can be quite puzzling, only they are unmistakably female rather than male.

They&#39;re the team in Spain aren&#39;t they? Charlie Martin had her procedures done with them - she has loads of videos on her YouTube channel which might be useful. And I&#39;m sure if you sent her a message on Twitter for instance she&#39;d give you more details. Xx
