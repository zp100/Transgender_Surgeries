I had a consult but was warned to stay away by like 30 people. Someone from his office saw my post on Facebook and sent me a completely unprofessional email.  It said that the girls warning me about him “will never be a real girl”

I had FFS with Zukowski in 2016, a BA with him in 2017 and a BBL done in 2018. I am overall very satisfied with his work.
</p>
<p>
I posted a detailed account of my FFS experience  a few years ago
<a href="https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php/topic,215448.0.html" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
.  I posted a lot of pics.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Z can be a real jerk at times, but most of the  time he&#39;s very nice.  I learned to take his moods in stride. I went to him for his surgical skills, not to be his buddy.  He&#39;s very good about follow-up appointments, and his front office is very good.  He gives you his personal cell phone number to call if there are any urgent problems.

I&#39;ve never been to him, but I have consulted with him twice and have friends who have been to him for FFS and BA. Both are happy.
</p>
<p>
He has never treated me badly, but as other have said, he can be a jerk. Most of the complaints you will hear about him are because of that. I have heard a story or two over the years. His staff though has always been polite and accommodating.
</p>
<p>
On the right person, his results can look stunning, but on the wrong person, I think that they can look kind of cartoonish. For example, he gives everyone the same pixie nose, cheek implants, and eyebrows, which are raised quite high sometimes... like 1930s Jean Harlow high. That doesn&#39;t always work for everyone. I questioned him about how high he places the eyebrows, that it seemed too high, and he seemed a bit annoyed said &#34;Well, you&#39;ve got to get them up there!&#34;
</p>
<p>
The last time I checked, he only shaves bone with his laproscopic burring tools and does not do Type 3 foreheads. He will try and steer you away from them with tales of sinus problems and has claimed in the past that he has had to fix problems other surgeons have caused doing Type 3, especially targeting Dr Ousterhout in San Francisco, who wound up suing for defamation.
</p>
<p>
If you like his aesthetic and want it for yourself, and you don&#39;t care much about bedside manner, then maybe Z is your guy.

Anecdotally, I’ll echo everyone saying his bedside manner does not seem great. This is from all the surgery/consult reports I’ve read over the past few years.
</p>
<p>
There was one post about a year back from a trans girl who had FFS with deschamps-Braly, and went to Dr Z for (I think) a breast augmentation. She said Dr Z was super critical of DBs work, said he could do better, etc etc. So if you’re at all self-conscious of any of your attributes, be warned that he isn’t going to make you feel any better.
</p>
<p>
His surgery results for both FFS and BA seem to be quite good. There are lots of girls I’ve seen who are extremely happy with their results, but consistently say that dealing with him was just something they had to deal with to get those results.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I was considering him for a long time, but decided to pick a surgeon that doesn’t treat people like shit.

The negatives I’m aware of are he doesn’t do type 3 foreheads and he’s not got the most congenial personality.

I have been to him back in 2012.. He will make a noticeable change.. but has a one size fits all type technique..   He only does a type one endoscopic brow shave. It is an aggressive type one but still not a true female shape.  I went to him back then because it was the best bargain and it did make an improvement, but there are better out there now.
</p>
<p>
He also does a hairline advance which somehow makes the hairline a bit off. He still uses his old techniques from what I  have heard.
</p>
<p>
Listen he will spew how his endoscopic technique is safer and better etc. etc.. and give a spiel but its not. I still have a front hairline scar.. but its not a huge deal but could have been done better.  Another thing is he doesn&#39;t do any x- rays.

A lot of the old guard surgeons are like this. Toby Mayer also insists that he can do better than a Type-III and/or most patients don&#39;t really need them and it&#39;s an &#39;up-sell,&#39; which is just total BS. His noses are great but, I really don&#39;t think you can get away doing proper FFS surgeries on people with masculine foreheads and a frontal sinus anymore without this technique in your skillset.
</p>
<p>
The funniest thing is that he was the most expensive surgeon that I consulted with. Ok sure,
<em>
they
</em>
were trying to up-sell me... riiiight... So why do you cost 65k when my quote from Dr. DB, with the type-III osteotomy was 40ish?

It is extremely important to get a head CT prior to FFS. Any surgeon that doesn&#39;t order imaging prior to determining what you need should automatically be removed from consideration.
</p>
<p>
One cannot determine the extend of forehead reconstruction you need without a proper head CT.

Zukowski doesn&#39;t do forehead reconstruction.  He only does contouring. He is adamantly opposed to opening up the sinus cavity.  If you need a type 3 surgery, you will need to find a different FFS surgeon.

Of course he&#39;s adamantly opposed to it. If he admitted it was the single most important facial feminization technique and that he can&#39;t perform it no one would go to him.

You make me think of that old Yogi Berra joke: &#34;No one goes to that restaurant anymore, it&#39;s too crowded.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Dr. Z has been doing FFS for 20 years. He has probably done a couple of thousand FFS procedures.  He has a lot of satisfied customers, including me. He tells you exactly what he thinks he can do, and Type 3 forehead reduction is not one of them.  If you have pronounced orbital ridges and need an osteotomy to reduce your glabella, then Dr. Z is not the surgeon for you.

VERY IMPORTANT. You want your surgeon to know what to expect before they cut you open, not just figure it out as they go. They need to take at least some imaging. Panoramic and cephalometric dental x-rays or CT scans are pretty common. I wouldn&#39;t trust a surgeon who didn&#39;t do them.

Weirdly, I actually just got large volume electrolysis at Zukowski&#39;s clinic last month and was coming here to do a write up on it. (If you have any questions about that feel free to ask)
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t speak to his surgical technique, but his bedside manner is...a lot. I&#39;ve had six or seven electro sessions at his clinic and his nurses and electrolysis techs are all wonderful. The entire clinic is very experienced at working with the trans population, and I&#39;ve never felt unwelcome or uncomfortable with his staff. From what I&#39;ve seen and heard about his surgeries, he is a very competent and compassionate surgeon but he specializes in a very specific &#34;look&#34;, and all of his &#34;Z Girls&#34; (His phrase 🙄) tend to look very similar because it it.
</p>
<p>
On the flip side, Zukowski has a very old school Madmen-esque attitude towards women, both cis and trans, and doesn&#39;t always treat his staff very well. If you haven&#39;t experienced that sort of chauvinistic attitude from men before, it can be a bit of a shock. My tech actually pulled me aside before I met him for the first time to warn me about his behavior. He&#39;s p much your standard issue cishet white upper class boomer guy. Lots of &#34;honey&#34;, &#34;darling&#34;, &#34;baby&#34;, &#34;good girl&#34; &#34;sweetheart&#34; comments. He always asks everyone the same &#34;joking&#34; question when he&#39;s dosing anasthesia. (Some variation of &#34;So sweetheart if I were to take you out to dinner, how many drinks would it take to get you...ya know?&#34;) If you&#39;re there for electro he&#39;ll give you the elevator pitch on cosmetic surgery, but he isn&#39;t too pushy about it. I would just always make sure there&#39;s a nurse or tech in the room with you and it should be fine.

I think that&#39;s a bit over the top.  I&#39;ve been to  Dr. Z three times for surgeries.  He has never acted inappropriately. He can be a jerk at times, but never creepy or inappropriate. His staff is great, BTW.

Funny how you&#39;re constantly on here promoting him every time his name is mentioned. Your comment history makes it pretty obvious.
</p>
<p>
Are you on his payroll or just getting free surgeries? At least make different accounts so it isn&#39;t obvious.

I add comments relating to my personal experience with Dr. Zukowski, nothing more.   I&#39;ve detailed the negative aspects aspects of him and given my opinion of my results in this thread.  I assumed that&#39;s what people reading this thread are interested in.

You, on the other hand, contribute nothing. Your comment history (2 posts) makes it plain what your agenda is.

It&#39;s just a good idea to always have another woman in the room when a male doctor is examining you, for both his peace of mind and yours.

Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not defending the man, I am just saying that even when a doctor isn&#39;t being creepy it&#39;s always a good idea to have a third person in the room, and most male doctors I know will insist on it for their peace of mind too.

I have to say, that Dr. Z is well-regarded by me and my husband.  He figured out that I am a diabetic (not borderline) and I ended up with a diabetes related rash and had to cancel a surgery date.  He charged me no fee, and in fact spoke with my PCP to be sure I was getting proper treatment.   He is a bit of a character, but he was an army surgeon bitd, and then with Dr. O was one of the first to offer FFS.  Him and most of the ffs surgeons are pretty competitive and I actually think that’s a good thing for us.  I’m debating going back for the large volume electrolysis as I still need to finish up after years of laser and electrolysis in spurts.  Anyhow, I’m not exactly neutral on Dr. Z, but I just wanted to counter all of the criticisms with a positive experience.

Zukowski has a very old school Madmen-esque attitude towards women, both cis and trans, and doesn&#39;t always treat his staff very well. If you haven&#39;t experienced that sort of chauvinistic attitude from men before, it can be a bit of a shock. My tech actually pulled me aside before I met him for the first time to warn me about his behavior. He&#39;s p much your standard issue cishet white upper class boomer guy. Lots of &#34;honey&#34;, &#34;darling&#34;, &#34;baby&#34;, &#34;good girl&#34; &#34;sweetheart&#34; comments.

<p>
Ha ha, this ^^^.  He is ex-Navy, and definitely all the things you describe.
</p>
<p>
I never minded the comments, but he can be an asshole sometimes. I&#39;ll never forget the time I  went to him for a hair transplant and BA in 2017. It was my second procedure with him (the first was
<em>
extensive
</em>
FFS a few months earlier). I was in the pre-op room with my friend. It&#39;s around 6:00 AM and I am tired from lack of sleep and worry and have the pre-op jitters.  He comes into the room with the anesthesiologist and the OR nurse. He starts explaining that they will do the hair graft  harvesting under &#34;twilight anesthesia&#34;.  I immediately objected, telling him I wanted to be completely out when they start slicing my head open.  I had &#34;twilight anesthesia&#34; before for a full genital clearing at his clinic, and while it was a nice high, I was fully aware of the very painful lidocaine injections in my genitals.
</p>
<p>
He looks at me and says &#34;I don&#39;t have time for this bullshit&#34;. I was stunned. My friend and I just kind of looked at each other in disbelief.  This
<em>
bullshit
</em>
?!! The nurse rolled her eyes. Dr. Z starts explaining they have to roll me over on the OR table to get the hair grafts and that could be dangerous while intubated or something, and then he marches out.  Now apparently he had just been dealing with some difficult patient in another exam room and wasn&#39;t happy, but still... that was shocking.  The anesthesiologist looked at me empathetically and said, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll put you out, no problem/&#34;
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later, he comes back into the room, and says cheerfully, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, hon, we can have you under while we take the hair grafts&#34;, like the previous exchange never happened.  That&#39;s Dr. Z. The hair transplant went fine. I&#39;m happy with the breast augmentation. He does good work, but like I said, he can be a real jerk sometimes.

You think think this is appropriate behavior for a doctor? Nothing about this is okay. Stop normalizing this behavior.

About the anesthesia, I don’t recall having heard it or I went under too quickly. Let’s not say “always” though.
