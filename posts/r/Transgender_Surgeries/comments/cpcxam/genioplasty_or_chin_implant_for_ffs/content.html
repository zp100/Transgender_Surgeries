I have been battling on my decisions whether or not I should go for Genioplasty or Chin Implants. I’ve been recommended by my surgeon that I should go for Chin Implant as it would make a nice V-Shape and create a nice projection on my chin. This will done together with Jaw Surgery.
</p>
<p>
But then I read  Dr Deschamps Braly opinion
</p>

</p>
<p>
Yet, Im not too sure if it would make my chin look more muscular, wider or bigger. Would I benefit from Chin Implant or Genioplasty?

I understand that both have their risk but which one do you favor the most? Chin Implant or Genioplasty?

I thought about having genioplasty but Dr. Cardenas has said that I do not need one. He suggested a chin implant instead. I have a very slight overbite so I don&#39;t need to fix that in any way. I want a very slight projection, a v shape to the chin and I want virtually no increase in width. Apparently this can be done by modelling the silicone implant before it goes in. But yes, I am terrified that I will end up with a bigger chin!
</p>
<p>
Maybe Dr. Cardenas will suggest something else when we meet face 2 face, so I am prepared that this might change.

My chin looks pretty similar to yours and for the reasons cited in the article, I’m going with sliding genioplasty.
</p>
<p>
I did consults with 5 different doctors, all well regarded and literally none suggested a chin implant. It was either “do nothing” or genioplasty.

Genioplasty 100%. I had a chin implant and hated it, had it removed. The genioplasty looks way more natural and feminine.

May I ask why you hated your chin implant? I am curious because it’s something I’ve been considering

In general, the masculine chin and jaw have more size/width than the feminine chin and jaw. So if you&#39;re trying to feminize a face, you should be subtracting mass, not adding it. I didn&#39;t hate the implant itself necessarily, I hated that I still had a masculine chin after FFS.

Who is your surgeon? I think most ffs surgeons do genioplasty, but have you looked in the wiki here?
