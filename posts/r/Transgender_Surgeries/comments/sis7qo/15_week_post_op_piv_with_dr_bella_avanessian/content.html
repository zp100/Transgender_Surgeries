Wow, that looks great! Makes me even more excited about my consultation with her (still 6 months away lol). How has your experience been?
</p>
<p>
ETA: just want to add, I‚Äôve looked at a LOT of vaginoplasty pics on here and yours is one of the very nicest I‚Äôve seen this early in recovery. Like, seriously, wow; top-notch work by Dr. Avanessian!

Shes very nice! I felt very comfortable with her the whole way, recovery this first week has been an absolute pain. Less so the site and moreso the bloating lol. The care team literally sent a nurse up the morning after the big snowstorm that happened this last weekend to check on a possible issue (ended up being nothing luckily!)
</p>
<p>
This is also minutes after removing the bandages packing and woudn vac so that make have an effect on its looks atm...stay tuned lol but they all seemed really happy with it, as am i!

I was gonna get her until circumstances forced me out of NYC. I see her results are great - hopefully I get back on that road since insurance covered it - congrats on the journey :-D üíú

Tricky question, will vary with surgeons. Its kinda gross but tbh this has been my biggest struggle so far with the surgery rather than the site itself.
</p>
<p>
So for my surgeon...youll be fitted with a catheter that comes out at the first appointment, and they said it would be hours until I pee which is proving to be true.
</p>
<p>
For #2 between the packing and the pain medication youll be pretty constipated. I can finally get up and move around on my own around the week mark and getting the wound vac and catheter out made it less painful. Expect to not have any real bowel movement for a week. And it will suck. And youll be very UNCOMFORTABLY bloated especially since you need to keep eating healthy throughout the week.

Ah i see. Thank you so much for your response. My biggest fear was having to go number two while still bed-ridden.
</p>
<p>
ik it‚Äôs so gross haha and i‚Äôm sorry to bring it up but i‚Äôd hate to go number two with the surgical site still somewhat sore and ‚Äòopen‚Äô with the pooping right next to it. Are your bowel movements back to normal now?

Its unlikely that you will have a bowel movement before the packing comes out....it kinds clogs you on top of being constipated. If your surgeon uses a wound vac then if you had an accident it likely wouldnt cause too much issue if you clean well since its sealed up pretty good.
</p>
<p>
I wouldnt say normal...after about 12 hours I was able to finally have a bowel movement it took until that I was uncloggee for me to figure out how to pee as well....holy crap I was so bloated....its like 3 AM and I just barely dont feel like im about to burst....miralax for the backend and some lube for the front end....I was desperate lol

Lack of swelling looks like a compression bandage has just been removed, texture on the skin ?

Don&#39;t be scared if you get swelling, it may blow up like a balloon but it will go down over the next few weeks / months. Mine looked flipping awful lol

She&#39;s absolutely amazing! Congrats girl!

<p>
On a side note, how did you reach out for Dr Avanessia? I&#39;m really wanting to get in the books to have mine done by her also. I know the wait time is going to be quite a while but I&#39;m planning on mid to late 2023. I just thinking I&#39;ve made up my mind that I want the right person to perform the surgery.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow best of luck with the recovery! That&#39;s always the fun part.

Thank you!
</p>
<p>
I literally just called the office and scheduled a pre op appointment. It was a few months after scheduling and about a year total from first contact to surgery and mainly to finish hair removal. They acrually had a cancellation and could have done it 3 months earlier but I was scheduled for FFS that month and I needed to finish hair removal so I decided to stick with the original timeline.
</p>
<p>
PS  Also contacting their office can be a pain in the ass sometimes so just be patient with them, you can tell they have a essentially a conveyor belt of trans people coming in for surgeries, and while that concept might sound sketch to some, to me it sounds that they are constantly in practice.

I went to her the result is similar.  Her work is excellent inside and out.  Everyones dilation situation differs but I got to green by week 4 and would recommend listening to your body.  It took some effort and multiple times of trying until i got it.   Some days early on I would skip green like I sometimes do now with orange if I&#39;m sore.

Looks amaizing! I&#39;m excited for my consultation in May. How long was it from your initial consultation to surgery?
</p>
<p>
Do you mind if I ask what you&#39;re doing for accommodations while you&#39;re in NYC? I&#39;m coming all the way from Pittsburgh so this is a detail I&#39;m nervous about.
</p>
<p>
Something I&#39;m still not clear on: does Avanessian also do FFS? I asked the office works on the phone but couldn&#39;t get a simple yes/no from them which was a little frustrating.

I went in the middle of covid and I think the shortest time they gave me was 6 months (I went at 12 months to complete hair removal), but the list could be increasing so probably at least that.
</p>
<p>
I rented an airbnb, you can find some decent places for around 2-3k a month...not super cheap but for essentially an all inclusive hotel  it works wonders!
</p>
<p>
Avanessian does do FFS as far as I know. Im pretty sure pang, ting and avanessian all do the same proecedures and consult each other about them.

You‚Äôre bottom surgery looks so üî•!
</p>
<p>
I had a friend who went to Bella, her vaginas looks amazing. I‚Äôve been torn between Bella Avanessian &amp; Bluebond Langner. The only difference is that Bluebond uses robotic assistance for depth which I feel like I‚Äôm gonna need ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Still Bella‚Äôs SRS just looks soooo good.
</p>
<p>
My friend is slowly scaring me out of doing bottom surgery with her. She said she only had complications with her. She had 2 top surgery and 2 rhinoplasty with her &amp; even tho it‚Äôs not the same surgery it‚Äôs the review that go me second guessing. The thing is everyone takes care of their bodies differently &amp; everyone has a different experience.
</p>
<p>
Tbh I‚Äôm still considering Bella Avanessian.

Congrats honey!!! How are you feeling now? I just did the first of the three appointments prior to scheduling the surgical consult. I was leaning towards Pang because of timeline, but I‚Äôm curious how you landed on Bella?

Im feeling much better! I went to mt sinai because insurance covers it and the hospital is well known. I saw pictures of bellas work and decided that was the way I wanted to go. A lot of my decisions were rather arbitrary, i figure all three doctors (pang ting and avanessian) are amszing at their job, but I figured a womam might have some sort of edge in designing my vagina, wherher or not that was a factor ill never know but that was my reasoning lol
