Thank you.  She feels amazing.  Even the scarring is insignificant.  And the sensitivity is awesome.  Also, self lubricates very well and dilating with the largest dilator is relatively easy already.  Just got the all clear for intercourse.  Now, being mainly lesbian, I just need to find a half interesting man to try her with.  Very happy I went to Ivan Manero and his team.  Very happy I chose colo-vaginoplasty.  Also, no problem with smell.  Just smells exactly as a vagina should smell.  Amazing result.  So happy.  Also, depth is fantastic.  At least 8 or 9&#34;.  Over 20cm.

I had one instance of dehisence after 3 weeks, where some of the sutures split open.. It was unpleasant and took about 4 to 5 weeks to fully resolve itself after asking the surgeons.  It happens, but is not serious in most instances.  Just alarming and uncomfortable for a while.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, smooth recovery...The first week was tough, of course, then it felt like it was slow, but was just me being impatient.  At 12 weeks I feel completely back to myself, but with a serious upgrade.  Love it.  After 8 weeks it was fine, but dilating felt slow to make progress.  At 12 weeks 1.2&#34; dilator is easy and looking for something a little larger now.

Prior to surgery and after adapting to feminising HRT they were changing.  I didn&#39;t have any erection at all for at least 18 months before surgery.  Not even a semi.  However, my orgasms were plentiful and a similar type to now, but only about 20% of the strength.  I literally have to scream to stop myself exploding.  The first time I apologized to my girlfriend for being so loud.  She laughed and said she loved it, but I may want to apologise to the neighbours.

With good foreplay it builds very well...Takes some time, but very good apart from that.

I think you are talking about the urethral tissue which produces lubrication When you are aroused. But how about the inside that colon part?

I am talking about all of it, my girlfriend was pleasantly shocked to find a very moist canal when she started exploring my new body.  She even described how she was surprised how it lubricated like hers and she smelled it and was slso surprised how it smelled the same as any healthy pussy.

Orgasming is completely different now.  I get to a point where I have little rippling climaxes easily.  I also have started to get these from certain types of food, weird, but fun.
</p>
<p>
If I am well turned on, and the right areas are stimulated, then these small climaxes build in waves until I am literally screaming.  Then my entire body just seems to rip the fabric of reality.  My entire vulva seems to vibrate like a buzzer for several minutes as I come down, but I am ready to continue straight away.  Like within a minute or so I am good to go.
</p>
<p>
It takes time, is not easy to get to that pinnacle, but, it&#39;s very powerful and persistent when it happens.  There is almost no comparison to a male orgasm.  It feels completely different.  The nerves respond differently, the sensations are entirely new, fascinating and very rewarding.  However, long, well honed foreplay is critical.

I almost came from your description!

Prior to your surgery, were your orgasms changing to this type, or more male-type?

Thank you so much.  I actually had a video call with the surgical team yesterday to talk about my progress.  It ended up as a virtual strip tease, and they said wanted to tweak my labia a little along with a little bit of scar removal.  To be honest I am completely thrilled with the result.  I have every confidence that you will walk away with a beautiful vagina that sings when she is aroused.  Good luck.
