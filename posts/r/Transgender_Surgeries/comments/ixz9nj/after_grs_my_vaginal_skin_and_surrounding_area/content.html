I had vaginoplasty 10+ years ago with Dr. Bowers. I&#39;d give anything to go back and pick another surgeon...I had so many issues with my vagina, not least of all an ugly overall appearance.
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;m struggling most with my skin being numb. Most of my labia, clitoral hood, mons pubis, and some inner thigh skin is anywhere from 80-100% numb.
</p>
<p>
My inner clit itself has sensation and I can feel pressure. And there are a couple small patches of sensate skin that feel &#34;almost normal.&#34; But the majority of surface skin itself is numb. Brushing over it or pinching strongly with fingers/tweezers and I feel nothing. I think a nerve or many were cut and didn&#39;t heal properly.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m wondering if anybody&#39;s dealt with this and if there&#39;s anything to do about it? Are there surgeons, procedures, or medicine that can repair the nerves or recover sensation?

Hi. I have no idea who this surgeon is. But what you&#39;re experiencing is nerve damage. I have this with an old back surgery to remove a lipoma. I have it in my hand where stitches left me with a node on some nerves (that one is from when I was five, so 30 years). And I have it all over my body in places from an accident I was in. In the last case I was treated by a fleet of experts and neurologists. Nerves can heal, at least the outer casing on the nerve. But after a year the potential for healing drops off. Obviously my experience is no substitute for a doctor&#39;s. I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s happened to you though!
</p>
<p>
I have not experienced nerve damage down there. But, the skin used from my &#34;t-bag&#34; was never sensitive. So my labia majora isn&#39;t very sensitive anyway.
</p>
<p>

I agree with the nerve damage.  Unfortunately once you have it, there is not much doctors can do to fix.  I have spinal nerve damage and once froma nerve burn where my butt cheek was numb.  Fortunately that healed.

FWIW, Dr. Bowers was no help, so I&#39;m not interested in reaching out to her. When I asked her about it years ago, she said essentially &#34;Well, that&#39;s impossible and doesn&#39;t make sense. You probably do have sensation you just don&#39;t know.&#34; After pressing the issue, she essentially said that female sexuality isn&#39;t about direct pleasure as much, so welcome to womanhood. Which is obviously and infuriatingly BS!

Yikers.  I&#39;m sorry you have had that experience.  I was 50-50 on trying to get her to do my surgery, but this isn&#39;t the first less then happy client story of hers I&#39;ve hear.  Client/patient, same diff.

Ya, I have a laundry list of issues with her and the results itself, unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m definitely not one of those people who&#39;s never satisfied (e.g. I&#39;m really happy with my FFS with Dr Spiegel)...it was just a bad decision/experience. I wish I&#39;d spent more time researching options.
