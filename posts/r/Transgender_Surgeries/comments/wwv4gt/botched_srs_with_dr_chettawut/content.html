I feel this so much! I had standard penile inversion with Dr Ashley DeLeon and have pretty much the same result you have. No joke, same complaints and aesthetic failures. I also got told “maximum results at about a year” only to still look un-natural. And when I expressed dissatisfaction I was scheduled for a consultation to talk about “next steps”. A consultation that they wanted me to pay for, which means they also wanted me to pay for revision. Considering she got over $120k put of my insurance and I for the surgery, I’m NOT paying her any more to correct what should have been done right the first time.
</p>
<p>
So things get even better… as I am a few months out from 2 yrs post op, and still look unnatural (again same results as you down to the huge clit) the Crane Center in San Fransisco emails me saying that due to my “amazing results” they wanted to use pics of me on the website. I emailed back and told them that they obviously hadn’t seen my results, sent them current pics, and said absolutely not.
</p>
<p>
I feel for you my friend. Some of us get screwed with no recourse and it sucks. Just know you are not alone

And that’s my issue. The surgeon got an obnoxious amount of money. The least she could do is a free revision

Don’t argue with them. Just report them so they can be banned. Rule 4.

TBH, not having a well developed clitoral hood or fourchette is pretty typical for the first surgery. It sounds like the issues you are having can all be addressed in a revision.
</p>
<p>
How long ago did you have the surgery? How is your depth? How is overall function/pain?

Have you raised your issues with him? What was his response? Do you have any thoughts on how you will approach revision?

Suporn always refused revisions for work by other surgeons, and I&#39;d guess Bank will be the same.
</p>
<p>
For what its worth, I&#39;ll add this post to the wiki here so others can find it.

This is true.  The procedure used to be routinely two-step.  That’s why Suporn offered the free revisions.  Also, not sure when you were done, but as the swelling goes down the looks generally improve.

Sounds about how I would have described mine which only went downhill the first 7 months. I know its demoralizing, disappointing and outright trauma inducing when this happens. It doesn’t matter who did it or where, it&#39;s a terrible feeling. Hopefully you can find the right revision surgeon. Overall, It doesn&#39;t sound like there&#39;s anything that can&#39;t be fixed. That&#39;s the good news. Even it takes some time you do have options.
