Hi all, I&#39;m just looking for people&#39;s opinion on the order of surgery&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
Im planning on getting both FFS and VFS at some point but something popped into my mind earlier that made me think about the order to get them.
</p>
<p>
The thing that made me think was that I get quite violent sneezing fits that I&#39;m pretty sure is due to a deviated septum, I say violent as its enough to make my dog jump out of her skin ðŸ˜‚.
</p>
<p>
Would this be enough to ruin the VFS recovery as I would be getting rhinoplasty as part of the FFS and having the septum repaired at the same time  So getting the FFS first would be the best option if sneezing would be bad for recovery.
</p>
<p>
I could make more progress with my voice training but I&#39;ve been trying for months with not a great deal of progress so not very optimistic on that front.
</p>

I&#39;d do FFS first. You can learn to change your voice; your face not so much

This was my logic. At first I wanted VFS first but I start voice therapy next week and Iâ€™ve seen good results even for people around my age (31). So my goal for this year is FFS and VFS if I can get them both. If not, VFS early next year.

1.25 month post yeson here
</p>
<p>
I had a cold and i was coughing and sneezing 10 days after surgery. 1 day before my 1 week follow up i choked on this stupid 100mg spiro and coughed like crazy. The check showed no sign of anything. Also everything seems to heal fine. I think the worst time to cough is the first 24hr but donf worry 1 cough is one vocal vibration, talking is 100 time worst.
</p>
<p>
I plan to get ffs even after i had vfs because i cant train my voice either because i am lazy or a just dont get it. But my voice was my biggest dysphoria. With good doctors from now on i will hope for no damage of yeson job from ffs with maybe a tracheal shave.
</p>
<p>
Dont fear the sneezing and coughing just dont talk. And for the order ffs is of course recommended before but either way can be done 6 month after or 6 month before.
</p>
<p>
Facial team and yeson teamed together to make a concensus. They are some of the most if not the best competent in each of their fields.

Pretty sure any good anesthesiologist with a child size tube can intubate me 100 times withtout messing anything. I think it happened once for a yeson patien and it was because a adult size tube was used.

I had FFS first and the surgeon who was going to be dealing with the VFS wrote to the FFS surgeon telling them specifically to drop the tracheal shave.
</p>
<p>
VFS surgeons prefer to do it at the same time as it can make things more difficult if it&#39;s already been done.

Yeah id already heard that some surgeons like to do the shave themselfs so they have full control.
</p>
<p>
Could I just ask who you went with and how happy you are with the results?

My surgeon was Gurpreet Sandhu at Charing Cross Hospital in London. Original surgery was March last year but it failed within a few weeks. They re-did it in October and I&#39;m very happy with it.
</p>
<p>
Had a follow up last week that confirmed all okay but still have a little granulation at 3 months that makes my voice a bit crackly but that will go as it heals.
</p>
<p>
When they measured, my resting pitch had moved from circa 110hz to 175 hz and my average range when talking is now 175-260 hz.
</p>
<p>
So far it&#39;s a very good result and the surgeon said one of the best he&#39;s had.

They only shave during a CTA type VFS and that include a visible scar.

That&#39;s not completely true - though I agree usually likely to be the case. I had web glottoplasty and they didn&#39;t want my FFS surgeon to do it as they were worried a non vocal surgeon might be too aggressive and damage my voice before I got to them.

Also i dont know to what extend it can fuck up with vfs, i think everyone is just highly conservative and i respect that. It means that surgeons care about us

If you don&#39;t mind either way, get FFS first - after VFS, every surgery where you are intubated is a risk (though much lower if they take proper precautions) that it will damage your voice and you&#39;ll have to redo the VFS.

Yeah someone in a previous comment also stated this and tbh it was something I&#39;d not even considered.
</p>
<p>
Think I&#39;ll just go right ahead for ffs 1st, I don&#39;t really wanna get FFS second and ruin the VFS and basically throw money down the toilet

I mean i wouldnt stress depending of the medical team intubation for them is no big deal. I guess it would depend on the country and the amount of skills in anesthesiologist

It is really important to understand the realities of VFS. I have seen and been advised that it has only a small impact on your voice and the greater majority of change comes from training. Go with FFS and do voice training. Good luck.

Not true i an 1.25 month post yeson and i have 40hz improvement and i have no clue how to even try to speak higher. I got the surgery for that reason. The training you have to do after the surgery is only to play the music instrument they have made not to make you speak higher than their results. For now i speak 40hz withtout trying. My laugh and my coughs are more feminine i wonder if that is even trainable

80-95% of people can get a voice thats passing if they work hard enough ime/imo.
</p>
<p>
Only a small fraction of those people end up with an effortless voice, where muscle memory kicks in and every sound is feminized without eating away at your energy.
</p>
<p>
Theres a large section of people that get great voices but still have to concentrate on it every day to varying degrees. This in of itself can cause dysphoria.

Please read doi: 10.1007/s00405-013-2511-3 (use lib gen if you dont have journal access)
</p>
<p>
It can and usually does have a large impact on voice especially pitch. In particular femlar with thyrohyoid seems to be hugely impactful.
</p>
<p>
Yesons technique is also really impressive but newer and has a different set of drawbacks.
</p>
<p>
These are both incredibly effective surgeries when they are performed on patients where they are indicated.
</p>
<p>
Yes they have risks and are expensive, but they are hardly ineffective.
