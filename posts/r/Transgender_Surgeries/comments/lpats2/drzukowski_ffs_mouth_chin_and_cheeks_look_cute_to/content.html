I think you look great. Give you nose more time to heal and for the swelling to go down.  I am sure it will look even better and you can always get a revision if needed.

You look gorgeous. Avoid sunlight exposure on your incisions so the scars heal without much hyperpigmentation. Sunscreen and face mask are great. :)

You look like a super cute Zukowski girl with a Zukowski nose. It just needs to settle. Right now you&#39;re recovering, so all you have to do is obsess over every detail of your face. Lol...so basically, you&#39;re like everyone else who&#39;s ever had FFS! There&#39;s always something.
</p>
<p>
Put a bag of frozen peas on your nose a few times a day and let it heal, you&#39;re going to look beyond marvelous before you know it. Then you&#39;ll start asking yourself what the fuss was all about. You&#39;re beautiful.

You know, I&#39;m here to lift her spirits when she needs it. I could care less about Zukowski. I have no idea how pretty she was as you say, I think she&#39;s  pretty now. If her nose falls off and she grows a unicorn horn, OK you got me. I&#39;ve seen a lot of FFS noses. I think it will improve.

It‚Äôs not an ffs nose it‚Äôs rhinoplasty. People rather have honesty then be placated. She didn‚Äôt post this to be told what a good job the surgeon did. Or how pretty she already looked before surgery. She posted this to show how poorly the surgeon did. All your doing is making the naive girls on here that are looking for surgeon reviews see these pics and think this is normal healing and and that what this surgeon did was right. The fact that I have to get my rhino revised because of a documented saddle bridge deformity Dr Z left me with and that there are multiple cases of his poor rhino results aside from hers. These things don‚Äôt need to be glazed over. His work has to get revised far to often for it to be constantly deemed acceptable.

No, actually I&#39;m not doing any of those things. Your projecting your own dislike of Dr. Z on to me and expecting me to see and feel what you do. I think we can both be right here. I was honest about what I wrote about her and the potential healing of her FFS nose. As of now, I&#39;m simply not prepared to throw her or her nose off the cliff a few weeks after surgery. It&#39;s too early to make that call. This is why I said get a bag of frozen peas to help the swelling.
</p>
<p>
This takes nothing away from your experience and disappointment with Dr. Z. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re feelings are equally valid. No one likes having bad work done. I kind of like your snarky complaint about my rhinoplasty euphemism. That was pretty funny.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s still pretty!

I guess the difference is. I know more about the situation then you do and already know that even doctor Z has recognized that some where down the line there is an issue that has made this surpass regularly rhinoplasty healing.

OK. It&#39;s not a contest Scooby Doo. I&#39;m super glad you got this case all bagged up and stuffed in the back of the Mystery Machine. And -- I&#39;m really sorry you got a bad Z nose before she did. I&#39;m totally serious. No one wants a bum nose, period.

It still doesn&#39;t change anything I said about Persimmon. HA!

Honestly I wouldn&#39;t have noticed anything awry about your nose if you hadn&#39;t mentioned it, especially if we had just met in passing. (lol I&#39;m hilarious) It&#39;s not an Instaface button nose but imo it looks very feminine and natural, especially in conjunction with the rest of your features.
</p>
<p>
How long ago was your surgery? I haven&#39;t had FFS myself yet but I&#39;ve heard it can take up to a year for the swelling to go down.

Thank you. I hope it improves I‚Äôm massaging and doing everything I can at home for a better outcome. Yeah the swelling is annoying but it‚Äôs part of the healing process, I‚Äôve dramatically reduced sodium and I‚Äôm taking arnica tablets still along with Ibuprofen for swelling. But yeah I like my other procedures so far I‚Äôm just hoping and praying that this improves enough that I‚Äôll be able to go out in 5-6 months ü•∫

I seriously think you could go out now, especially with a mask, and nobody would bat an eye. Obviously I can only see one angle but you look incredibly passable even with a swollen nose.

I honestly don&#39;t see anything wrong with your nose. I&#39;m not handing out a gratuitous compliment, I just don&#39;t see what you&#39;re worried about. It took reading other comments for me to tell that apparently it&#39;s swollen, which is normal after surgery, but even with swelling it doesn&#39;t strike me as bad.
</p>
<p>
I guess all I can contribute is to say: try not to let yourself obsess over it, maybe you look better than you think ;)

You still have 11 more months of finalization. The swelling should subside in 2-6 months, maybe sooner depending on your genetics

I think you look pretty and natural.  Give the nose time to heal because I can still see swelling.  It may even out.   Even so, you are a pretty girl and that is half the battle.üëç

Honey don‚Äôt worry. I can see that your nose is still swollen. It‚Äôs takes a long time for nose to take its final shape ( about a year i heard )

It can take up to a year for a nose but you will get at least 80% there at around 6 months. It‚Äôs going to keep changing. Mine kept changing up to 2 years! And I had a very slight bump nothing major but it annoyed me. I had it corrected!  I went to Facialteam btw.

I think the mistake here is you need to post these in the plastic surgery forum not the transgender surgery forum.

I wish that was the case with me. I had another consultation again with one of those trendy FFS surgeons and he confirmed my fears, that this isn‚Äôt going away and I was botched üòï

The good thing is that he believes he can fix it.  He said that too much cartilage was removed, but that it looks like I have enough cartilage left over for him to move somethings around without having to use a graft.. silver linings I guess
