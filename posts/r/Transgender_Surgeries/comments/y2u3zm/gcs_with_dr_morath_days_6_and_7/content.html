Hi all! Here another 2-day update with another interesting milestone: yesterday it was a week since surgery!
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 6
</em>
I wasn’t feeling so well, and I’m realising that ever since the surgery happened I always wake up with some morning sickness, but I slowly grow out of it as I go through my breakfast. It’s slightly annoying and hope it’ll start going away soon.
</p>
<p>
In any case, today is a big day! I’m getting the vaginal stent removed along with some stitches and I’ll get to see more of my results as well as to know more of how my vaginal canal is holding up. It happened early, around 10 in the morning. A nurse came pick me up and they took me to the exam room where I’m now supposed to be examined every day. I sat (with some difficulty, definitely need some practice!) in the gynaecological chair and a doctor started removing all the stitches around my vagina and gently took the stent out. I felt a big relief and a feeling I had never felt before but somewhat similar to when you’re constipated and you finally get to go to the toilet. The stent was huge and bloody and although I did feel it inside I would’ve never imagined how big it actually was.
</p>
<p>
Now, the doctor cleaned the vagina with saline and water and then took out an intimidatingly big speculum, which she used to take a look at the canal. She said it held nicely and it is alive and doing well (at least for now)! Now that part of the stitches are out I could also see the end of my labia as they were before tucked away. It all looks good (albeit swollen) and one of the labia minora is rather shorter than the other but I’d say it stays within normal variation. I left the exam room quite happy (and walking, even when still difficult, is a whole lot easier now!).
</p>
<p>
Dr. Morath came to see me in the afternoon and she examined everything herself. It seems that sensation is coming back properly and she authorised me to restart hormones and take showers tomorrow, and sleep on my side with a cushion in between my legs. Excited to restart all those three!
</p>
<p>
I also complained about my constipation, which had started to give me difficulties when walking and some abdominal pain. They gave me a slightly stronger laxative to unclog things while upping the one that makes your stool softer to twice a day. I could go to the toilet thrice in the rest of the day and felt so much better and unclogged! In one of my toilet visits I could also take a look at myself in the big bathroom mirror without so many bandages in the way and felt immensely happy and euphoric with what I saw :)
</p>
<p>
Not so many changes down there. Bleeding continues to be minimal and it usually doesn’t get through to the outer bandages, and pain is usually around 0-1/10. Swelling continues to go down really slowly.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 7
</em>
A week from surgery! I could sleep a lot better on my side although I still carry some morning sickness around. After breakfast and some rest, it went away and decided to finally take that long overdue shower. A nurse took all my bandages away and put some plastic around my IV so it wouldn’t get wet. And then there I went, I took a very refreshing shower and could nicely clean myself. I was a bit uncomfortable to go around with the catheter and the IV, but I still enjoyed it and, more importantly, I saw a body that fits me and that I already love! It was the best shower in years.
</p>
<p>
Problems however came when I was out of the shower and started drying myself. My body is still not used to making such efforts and while I was drying myself I started feeling dizzy. I sat on the toilet as quick as I could and called a nurse (there is a cord you can pull next to it to call them). I was starting to feel better again when the nurse arrived and we tried to get me back to bed, but at the first effort to stand up I fainted and hit my head in the process. I was still sitting on the toilet when I came back and nothing bad happened after the scare (apart from a small bump in the back of my head), but they decided to monitor me more closely for the next couple of hours. Once I could relax in bed I returned to how I was feeling before this incident. With all this I also forgot to restart hormones, but I will do that tomorrow instead.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon, I had another revision and went in the exam room. The doctors seemed to be in plenary, with the two ward doctors, Dr. Morath and, a bit later, also Dr. Schöll, maybe because of my fainting spell earlier in the day. They cleaned me, outside and inside, and then took a look inside. The fainting caused to damage whatsoever and everything continues to look good. Dr. Morath said my catheter may be coming out in some 3 days (so 10 days after surgery), as the meatus area is also healing quite well. These are good news! And according to that timetable I may be looking at being discharged from the hospital sometime in the first half of next week, starting dilations this weekend.
</p>
<p>
In the surgical area, everything continues looking good. My labia minora seem to be significantly less swollen but now bandages tend to get a bit dirtier, adding the vaginal discharge after stitches were taken away yesterday and the stent removed. I’m no longer taking oxycodon (now, all pain medication left is a ibuprofen-like pill taken with every meal, so thrice a day) and pain continues to be quite manageable, around 0-2/10. Sometimes it doesn’t feel particularly painful either, but only as a bruise that is still healing and has the skin particularly sensitive.

How long before the surgery did you have to stop taking hormones?
