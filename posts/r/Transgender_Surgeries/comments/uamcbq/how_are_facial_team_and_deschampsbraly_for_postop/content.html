<p>
Reading through one of Facial Team’s recent publications (
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32221232">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32221232
</a>
), I found a table of their postop meds. The only pain meds listed are 1 g acetaminophen, 600 mg ibuprofen and 50 mg of tramadol taken regularly, but no “real” opioids, not even morphine. What’s listed here for FT just seems grossly insufficient. What have been your experiences pain-wise with FT, and with Deschamps-Braly? They’re on my shortlist.
</p>
<p>
I had my SRS with Suporn about a decade ago as a medically-naive teenager, and had an absolutely brutal time pain-wise in the hospital. lIRC I apparently burned through my patient-controlled morphine allotment in a day when it was supposed to last at least twice that, yet was still in pain much of the time, and spent much of my first night crying through gritted teeth. I’m not aware of this being the case for anyone else, so future Suporn/Banks girls please don’t let my n=1 story worry you. That said, two major and two minor revisions later, a few years apart, and I can confidently say I’ve got the worst pain tolerance of anyone I’ve ever met, IRL or online. If anything, my pain tolerance has worsened after the pain exposure I had during my revisions. I don’t have any known medical conditions that could cause this, but I do know of some instances of very poor pain tolerance on one side of my family, so it’s probably genetic. I can’t even tolerate 5-vial blood draws anymore without prescription EMLA cream along with tramadol, ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
</p>
<p>
I feel like one of the quiet casualties of the war on opioids, where I really do need high doses of morphine or oxycodone to survive any kind of surgery, but “opioid addiction and withdrawal fear” seems to have grossly outstripped any concerns for uncontrolled-pain-induced trauma, or even just patient comfort. I’d have happily traded a few days of morphine withdrawal a decade ago for not having developed the medical PTSD I still face today.
</p>
<p>
Call me a weakling… I’m used to pain invalidation from nearly every doctor who’s ever encountered my excessively low pain tolerance. I’ll be doing an in-person consult with FT next month (hi FFS friends, would love to meet you if you’re up for it!) and I intend to ask about this, but any info you might have to put my mind at ease would really help. And if your pain control experience was anything less than stellar, please tell me (DM fine too) and I’ll make it front and center during my consult.
</p>
<p>
Love to y’all

Hi. I&#39;m about six weeks post op with DB. I&#39;ve posted comments elsewhere detailing my experience but the tl;dr summary is: 1st night was quite rough pain wise but well managed (was at 6, dropped to a 2-3 with meds), first week usual pain level was 3-4, around 1-2 swapping between ibu/aceto. Second week and onwards, mostly stopped using meds, level at 0-1. I would occasionally take an ibu if I had a headache spike.  My experience over all was that post operative pain was minimal and well managed with the medications I was given.

Thanks. Did you have PCA (patient controlled anesthesia) the first couple days? And on hospital discharge, were you prescribed opioids or acetaminophen/ibuprofen only? Last question: would you say your pain tolerance is “normal”, low or high?

The Suporn clinic was a big fan of valium, too, though all that does is sedate and make your memories of it after a little extra hazy. Do they do IV morphine instead of tramadol? Tramadol’s such a crap drug for post-surgery, it takes too long to fully kick in (like codeine) and it’s only a weak opioid agonist.

I have a terrible pain tolerance so I’m quite interested in this topic.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know about DB, but Facial Team use ultrasonic cutting tools resulting in far less pain than the traditional bone saws and whatever that cause lot of damage. These are very new in FFS and most surgeons still don’t use them, hence you’ll see lots of stories about bad pain and opiates. If memory serves, 96% of FT patients get by on acetaminophen/ibuprofen with the rest Tramadol. I know of one patient who got opiates with them, so it’s not impossible, just unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
With your SRS there have been others with the same problem. Morphine doesn’t work in some people and you need to change to other drugs that do. Hospitals have them, but it can sometimes be difficult getting them to try.
</p>
<p>
Once you’re out of hospital in Thailand it can be tricky. They seem quite willing to prescribe, but there’s a limited range of painkillers that are legal in Thailand and if they don’t work you’ve got problems. Tramadol is very popular, but many people can’t tolerate the side effects and it doesn’t work at all for some. In Europe/USA there’s more range, but you often hear that doctors won’t prescribe them.
</p>
<p>
Definitely tell your surgeons about your experiences with pain and drugs before surgery. Personally I’d probably change surgeons if they are not flexible.

I’d heard about the ultrasonic cutting tools, which is actually a big draw for me. Did you go to Facial Team?
</p>
<p>
Morphine/other opioid derivatives and tramadol all definitely do work on me, I just seemingly need 2x to 4x the “regular” dose to get pain reasonably under control. Blood draws, dilation, even just stubbing my toe hard have all been known to be excruciating experiences. My greatest fear is waking up from this surgery with my face on fire and begging for more morphine/etc and not getting enough (kinda happened with my SRS once the lidocaine started wearing off).

Facial Team are very popular in Australia and I know heaps of people who have been to them. Before covid they would visit once a year.

How do you get on with electrolysis? It’s the worst thing I’ve ever experienced.

I was very fortunate to get on hormones/blockers (albeit DIY) early enough to completely avoid electrolysis. It just wasn’t early enough to avoid some T damage to my face (especially my nose) and voice. I would’ve probably needed injected lidocaine + some opioids to deal with electrolysis, from what I hear.

Look through these posts about FT, and you’ll see pain is a non-issue. Regardless of the theory, this is the reality.

You’re lucky. It&#39;s a nightmare. However if you if you have injected lidocaine you don’t need anything else.

Yes, I’m very grateful. Every trans woman I’ve ever talked to about electrolysis has told me the same thing.

I had surgery with FacialTeam in December of 2021. Forehead and jaw reconstruction, lip lift, and simultaneous breast augmentation with Ocean Clinic.  Never experienced significant pain, I thought their pain management regimen was great.  It was primarily paracetamol.  I met a number of other patients while I was there and nobody was complaining about the pain that I heard.  Many moments were uncomfortable, but not painful!
</p>
<p>
I wrote this review of my FT experience:

Thanks… sort of terrifies me to hear they’d put someone on paracetamol alone, as far as surgery goes that may as well be sugar pills for me. Would you rate your pain tolerance as “normal”, though?
</p>
<p>
Also would you mind if I DM you about other FT things?

DM away!  I wouldn&#39;t let the pain management concerns be a reason not to choose FT is what I&#39;m getting at - the doctors and nurses at the HC in Marbella were second to none in terms of service, if I&#39;d experienced pain they would have responded.  It&#39;s also easy to talk to your coordinator and get questions answered ahead of time that way.

Yeah that’s always the issue, surgeons the world over felt the chill of “your patients will end up addicted to opioids, better take no risks professionally even if it harms your patients”. It’s so frustrating that of all human characteristics that fall along a distribution, pain tolerance is often just assumed to be about the same for everyone. Being an outlier means you get gaslit from every direction that “the pain can’t be that bad”.
</p>
<p>
I just don’t get why they don’t err towards dosing high versus dosing low. For me, opioid side effects pale in comparison to feeling surgical pain. There is no worse hell on this earth.

Curious what procedures you had, and roughly how old you are? I’m late 20s and sure hope I’ll bounce back as quickly as you. How did teeth brushing and pseudo-chewing work for you for those first few days? I think I’ll just live on meal replacement shakes for those couple days. I eat keto so most of the usual soft foods aren’t on the menu.
</p>
<p>
I’m also a side sleeper. How long was it before you could safely side-sleep again?

Thanks! Those are all the same procedures I’m considering, rhinoplasty especially. How was your voice after the trach shave? And how long before you could properly chew and/or open your mouth?
</p>
<p>
It definitely sounds like a very unpleasant few days. Prosciutto sounds like a perfect survival food for me though. I’m also planning to buy a bunch of my old standby, Keto Chow. Silly name but great product. Just a powder you mix with water and a fat source like heavy cream or avocado oil. Much easier to drink calories than to chew them. I’m also quite lean and can’t afford to under-eat.

Fellow low pain treshold person here!! Surgeries like FFS , and the thought of SRS is what terrifies me the most!! I literally have nightmares on how will i push through it, or if I can do it, even. It has come to the point where I wonder if i can do transition. Just depressed really, so thank you for this thread. Will follow closely, and please report back what FT said when you raised this concern with them.

Hi! I really feel you, having low pain tolerance feels like an invisible disability that very few believe or take seriously. Just as a point of reference, can you handle blood draws or is that sort of a no? Without my “protocol” I mentioned above of surgical numbing cream + bunch of painkillers, I’m crying through gritted teeth within three seconds of the needle entering my vein.
</p>
<p>
In case I forget, which I might, please poke me again in this thread or DM me and I’ll be sure to let you know what FT says in a month from now.

So true, even growing up people would always question it!! You know...&#34;he is exaggerating&#34; or you just get branded as really &#34;soft&#34;. But when  professional medical people like your own Dr. don&#39;t believe you, then it&#39;s next level hell.
</p>
<p>
Same, even with drawing blood, it&#39;s an ordeal. People like us have it even more difficult. But wow you got through SRS, and two revisions. Amazing!
</p>
<p>
Will do, defo stress to the FT team about your pain issues.

Yeah, all the bullying I got for being “afraid of the ball” in phys ed classes came down to being intolerant of the pain of having a ball smash into me. I’m probably an HSP (highly sensitive person) so it’s not just physical pain, emotions are also generally felt much more strongly, for better or worse.
</p>
<p>
Honestly I barely got through SRS and four total revisions (two were like 15min, the other two were about an hour each, all under local). I developed medical PTSD bad enough to precipitate an ugly panic attack just sitting in a doctor’s office. Since then my partner accompanies me to every single medically-related event; her presence is a PTSD buffer and she knows how to help re-ground me. At the consult I’ll definitely focus on the medical PTSD just as much as the pain issues that caused the medical PTSD in the first place. And my partner will be there beside me, helping make sure I don’t have a panic attack right then and there in front of the FT surgeons. I’m in trauma therapy now but the medical PTSD isn’t even close to the worst of my trauma, unfortunately. I’ve got it better under control these days but it just should have never happened in the first place.
</p>
<p>
I’ve put off FFS for years over my medical trauma (which didn’t exist at all prior to SRS), but the facial dysphoria’s become bad enough that I’m finally willing to subject myself to extensive surgery again. I don’t want to run away anymore; I just finally want to be fully content in my body.

DB does not like to give out opioids. tramadol is about the highest you get. not sure if you get anything in the hospital, I don&#39;t remember much. Like others have mentioned, its not fun one or two nights, but isn&#39;t that painful overall. more uncomfortable.

Hmm, that pretty deeply concerns me… did you or anyone else you met while there ask for more than tramadol, and get turned down?
</p>
<p>
How would you describe your pain tolerance though? That makes all the difference. Low-opioid works for some, but that then gets applied to outliers like me. Here I am with medical PTSD ten years later because “opioids are risky.”

im not the best, but i must have gotten better over time. When I had it done I handled it way better than I thought. my friend asked and was turned down. If you need stronger I&#39;d set it up with your pcp if that&#39;s a possibility.

I’ve definitely gotten much worse over time… extreme pain seems to have over-sensitized my nervous system, not desensitized it. Is it physically possible to swallow pills that first night if you get “the works” done? I’d think the pain control is all IV for the first day or two. How did your friend cope?

i had really bad reactions to anesthesia, so i stayed an extra day in the hospital, I wasn&#39;t able to stay awake, so I honestly don&#39;t know how the hospital stay was. i had jaw surgery recently with the same dr. and Whatever I was given at the hospital kept the pain low. I honestly didn&#39;t feel it much.
</p>
<p>
My friend did well at the hospital but honestly struggled for about three days after. it wasn&#39;t a constant pain, but she would have moments that were quite hard for her. Keep in mind it has a lot to do with what you have done. Forehead work is relatively painless, never met anyone who said otherwise. nose is a little worse, but jaw work really is the worst part.

That sounds rather scary… I was fine after my SRS years ago but it sounds like this will be a lot longer.
</p>
<p>
Good to know the forehead isn’t so bad, but I’ve got a really large nose with a big bump so I’m expecting that part of the recovery to be slow and unpleasant.
