Okay, today I discovered 2 things, about one in fifty girls (don&#39;t quote me on that...) gets the catheter blocked from the inside, most possibly from air bubbles. And aparently im that girl...
</p>
<p>
I started feeling very bloated, and realized way too late than the catheter bag was not filling up at all. I was too slow and ended up going to get urgent care to the clinic, as you might imagine today it was closed and it was quite a hassle to get there and a nurse.
</p>
<p>
Holy shit it did hurt, about 2 hours of pure agony. If i had known what was happening all of this would have been much easyer
</p>
<p>
Im okay now, in fact i feel great, but i have to warn you.
</p>
<p>
If you feel bloated, and the catheter seems to not be working. Thereis a part of the tube you can deatach, do it and hopefully you&#39;ll drain out. If it doesen&#39;t, go to the clinic. They&#39;ll try to push the catheter a little bit more, and if that doesen&#39;t work, they&#39;ll deatach the tube again and fill you with some saline solution to get any bubbles out, and then you&#39;ll became a water hose for like 2 minutes. After that, you&#39;ll feel a lot better. And they may change the catheter.
</p>
<p>
At first i thought i had an intestinal blockage and i tryed some other stuff and thats why i took so long. Don&#39;t be like me, if you see this happening to you. Act fast and most possibly you&#39;ll be done in no time...
