Soulsource has a new product called the milli.  It&#39;s basically all the dilators in one, and it expands one mm at a time (rechargeable battery). It might be a better investment than the traditional set of 4. Easier cleanup since there is only one. I&#39;m liking mine alot but it&#39;s only my 4th day with it.

Is that your only dilator? I read a bad review of it.
</p>
<p>
Could you post more about it later. There’s very little info avail on it.

I&#39;m curious what you read in the bad review? In what way was it bad?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve only had it since Wednesday. Before that I had all 6 of their hard dilators.
</p>
<p>
The milli was recommended specifically because I have a problem.woth my opening shrinking more than the inside (sometimes to the point where I can&#39;t even fit the tiny P1 dilator inside) this causes excessive dragging friction on that tissue which increased scar development and granulation tissue. Hopefully the milli will slip in and evenly put pressure outward to expand things without contributing that level of friction.
</p>
<p>
So far it&#39;s working we from me. I&#39;ll know a little more next Wednesday after my next appointment, and then I&#39;ll try to update you down the road.

Definitely working really well for me. Just had my 4 week post op visit and my Dr was finally able to fit two fingers inside which is good standard apparently. She wasn&#39;t able to reach the back with her finger either which is past the point of the average cervix. I think I technically lost a small amount of depth using the milli more often than the hard dilators since it is shorter. But I&#39;m not bothered by that and I could get it back over time if I work at it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a little disappointed in the battery life. It says two weeks, but the way I use it it lasts Maybe 6-8 dilations at most. I guess I use the motor more often than typical.
</p>
<p>
Overall though I&#39;m really happy with it.

Well a month later and it has catastrophically failed under normal use. It seems like one of the bars used to expand it partially snapped. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to try taking it apart to see if it can be repaired or try to contact customer service to probably fail at getting it replaced.
</p>
<p>
So I guess this is now one more negative review. Up until it broke it was wonderful tho.

Don’t try to repair it, you’ll invalidate the warranty and not be able to return it.

Surely that’s not legal.
</p>
<p>
Anyway try it and make an update here, especially if they refuse. I’ll add a link in the wiki so people can find it more easily.

This sounds amazing.  I just went and found it on their site... Theres only one issue with it for me.  Its usable length is only 4 inches, which is a good inch and a half too short for me :/  I was really looking forward to the idea of not having to clean off 4 dilators multiple times a day, oh well.  Still, cool find though.  Whats nice is it actually expands a bit larger than their largest plastic dilator (which is my next endeavor... to find some larger dilators because (unfortunately?) my boyfriend is huge)

You can always use the milli to expand the width and then occasionally use a different dilator for the depth. I&#39;m actually using the milli twice a day and then I use a plastic dilator once in the evening to apply a steroid cream my Dr prescribed to deal with scaring and granulation tissue inside and that maintains depth. So far anyway.

I don’t think there any other options unless you can make one yourself. Custom work is always expensive.

Some here, but the default unless if you need to buy one or have special requirements is soulsource.
