Hi everyone! After a lifetime of hoping, waiting, a lot of back &amp; forth I finally had my MTF GRS done this past October. Oh, and for good measure I only had B/A surgery at the same time. Having both surgeries done at the same time saved me a nice chunk of money. The surgeon I chose for all this is Dr. Rumer, and so far, I am very happy with my decision. Before deciding on a surgeon, I set up multiple appointments for consultations, but after meeting with Dr. Rumer I cancelled the other appointments and chose her. Sure, she is not the chattiest of doctors. But I was not looking for someone to tell my life’s story to; I already went through that with the shrinks &amp; therapists in the past. I wanted a skilled surgeon, not a BFF. Dr. Rumer was very professional and straight forward. She explained her procedures, the possibilities, limitations and likely outcomes. She showed my wife and I photographs of her work, and showed and explained things to us that went well beyond the scope of the consultation. In short, I was very happy with what I had seem and confident things would go smooth.
</p>
<p>
In the weeks and months leading up to the date of surgery Teri Rumer was my patient coordinator, and I could not have asked for a better one. I came up with new questions and worries a lot, and Teri answered them all for me, almost always within a couple of short hours.  (I prefer emails to phone calls, but on the occasions when I did call Teri answered the phone right away). Or she passed them on to Dr. Rumer, who called me back no later than the next day to answer my questions. Teri not only dealt with my medical insurance for me (United Healthcare, which the office accepted), she also made sure all the necessary documentation for my short-term disability insurance was taken care of. This ensured I could easily transition from working to disability status without missing a beat. The last thing you want to do is worry about how to pay your mortgage when you are going through recovery.
</p>
<p>
I am 3 weeks post-op now, and the recovery seems to be going well. Currently my only job is to sit at home, relax, and follow Doctor’s orders: Keep it clean, relax, and
<strong>
dilate
</strong>
. It is all very boring, and dilating is not fun at this stage. Not even a little! I am told it will be different down the road, but that’s still a little ways away. As for the functional and aesthetic results of both, the B/A &amp; the GRS surgeries, after three weeks all I can say is that it’s slowly healing. My crotch is starting to look less like it got into a fight with a tiger. The electric shocks and “phantom pains” tell me that my body is creating new nerves &amp; my brain is remapping the region.  From what Dr. Rumer, as well as some of my friends have told me, breast implants can and will take a few months to get into their final position. So here too, patience is required.
</p>
<p>
So, I am not sure where the bad press about Dr. Rumer, her work and her people is coming from, but my experiences have been nothing but positive.  I strongly recommend her and her team!

I feel kinda bad to instantly call BS, but this comes off suspiciously since your reddit account is 2 hours old, with 0 other activity.
</p>
<p>
Just sayin.

This post does have the appearance of a fake review. It would have more credibility if you weren&#39;t using a new account with nothing else in it.

I&#39;ve seen a number of fake reviews over the years. I feel like I kinda wish I&#39;d been archiving them, it seems important to keep a record of doctor&#39;s attempts to astroturf. Remember when there was a bunch of stuff for 2pass that was really fishy? Did you ever learn whether that stuff was actually fake?

I don&#39;t think too deeply about surgeons these days. My opinions have essentially settled down as to who I like so I tend to just put them in the wiki and forget about it.
</p>
<p>
Obviously I&#39;d never to Rumer, but there&#39;s something very off about 2pass and I&#39;d not go to them either. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s fake, but there&#39;s to much of it for my comfort.
