My labia are still fairly numb. The clitoral area still doesn’t feel good. I have no pleasurable sensation anywhere. I am not able to orgasm still. Depth and width are still lacking. I have revision surgery scheduled next month with Dr Remineni. My labia fixed over the clitoris, could this be why my clitoris mostly feels bad. It’s frustrating thinking I’ve lost the ability to orgasm forever. I don’t know what to do to try to orgasm, nothing feels good down there.

You are so early.  Have revision,  dilate. Give yourself another 18 months. When healed from revision begin self exploration.

I&#39;m very sorry to hear that you are currently dealing with this.

If you are open to the idea, you could always experiment with anal. There is plenty of pleasure to be found from that as well
