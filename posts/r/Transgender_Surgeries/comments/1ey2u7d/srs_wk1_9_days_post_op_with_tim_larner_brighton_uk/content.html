Thank you. Yes! That&#39;s right. But it really goes so quickly.  Hospital and all the staff are fabulous. They look after you like a family,  make you feel comfortable and welcomed.  Never in my entire life I&#39;ve meet so many true professionals with compassion and empathy to the patients.  You honestly have nothing to worry about. Keeping my fingers crossed for you and good luck on your journey.

Wow congratulations, thanks for sharing. I&#39;m happy to read how well your surgery went, I had my consultation with Tim, but have to wait to finish hair removal first.
