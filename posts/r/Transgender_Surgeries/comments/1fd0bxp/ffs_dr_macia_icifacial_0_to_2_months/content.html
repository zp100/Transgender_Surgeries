Your results are very impressive, congratulations!  I was wondering if you could please tell me where your surgeon is located, and what his FFS fees are for your procedures.  Does he do CT scan, and how well did your forehead scar heal. From your picture, it looks like it was a nice tidy incision. I am currently looking for similar procedures, so your information would be very helpful. Thank you so much for posting.

Thanks!

My surgeon is located in Madrid, he is well known for his rhinoplasties and that&#39;s what caught my eye. For the preop I had done profile scan of my skull, a scan of my jaw from front, and the usual cardiogram and blood analysis. Whole procedure was 20K. My scar is healing well but slowly (but that&#39;s on me, since I don&#39;t heal very well the scars).

Great results :) I&#39;m going to him in March
</p>
<p>
Can I ask what you had done to Chin? I don&#39;t see much of a difference but I guess if you had a reduction there could be some swelling left.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m having a chin reduction with him but I don&#39;t see so many before and afters from him.. nose jobs and forehead reductions amazing tho
