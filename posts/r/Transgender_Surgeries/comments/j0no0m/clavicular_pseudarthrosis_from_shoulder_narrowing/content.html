I&#39;m confused by both this post
<em>
and
</em>
your posting history. I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re AMAB who had shoulder
<em>
narrowing
</em>
surgery a year ago and complications, AFAB who had shoulder
<em>
widening
</em>
, or just complications from an
<em>
accidental
</em>
break in your clavicle.
</p>
<p>
Knowing what you&#39;re trying to achieve would be helpful, but you&#39;re probably going to have to depend on your surgical team (or a second opinion from another surgeon) to figure out where to go from here.

&#34;Fixing&#34; the shoulders and
<em>
intentionally
</em>
narrowing the shoulders are two different things and may be mutually exclusive at this point.
</p>
<p>
Your options are probably limited and the desired outcomes may not be possible. A second opinion is definitely called for here. Good luck.

I feel like we might have some misunderstanding here, but thank you! I already had said surgery and am now dealing with one of the possible complications. My left shoulder healed great, but my right one didn&#39;t do as well.
