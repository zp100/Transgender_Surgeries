Hello!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 23 &amp; mtf. I had FFS with Spiegel 14 months ago, started HRT 32 months ago. I was 20 or 21 when I made this decision, and more importantly I was early in transition. The &#39;rate of error&#39; or nitty gritty reputations of surgeons (spiegel&#39;s being for non-aggressive or subtle changes) was not so important to me. I just couldn&#39;t imagine my face being worse than it already was.
</p>
<p>
Spiegel did a marvelous job on my forehead and cheeks, truly. But when it comes to my jaw &amp; adam&#39;s apple, I was left desiring more. This is not to mention that, at that time, I hadn&#39;t asked for him to touch my nose or chin, which are two things I&#39;m interested in having done now. My questions are these:
</p>
<p>
With respect to FFS pt. 1:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
How likely is it that he did as much as he safely and responsibly could w/ respect to my jaw and adam&#39;s apple? I suppose showing updated CT scans to other surgeons is what this question calls for.
</li>
<li>
What are your thoughts on botox injected into the masseter? I suspect that my jaw problem is more due to muscle than bone structure. I&#39;ve read that unlike other botox applications, when injected into the masseter it actually helps alleviate the issue of jaw tightness, thereby decreasing the whole &#39;you have to do it every year for the rest of your life&#39; thing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
With respect to FFS pt. 2:
</p>
<p>
I pretty much pass at this point. This round of FFS is not entirely necessary toward that end. With that comes (perhaps fallaciously) the added fear of complications in the form of anything that will set me back from where I am now. This makes this round of FFS immensely difficult, as I can find horror stories on every highly reputed surgeon out there. So, with that being said, and knowing that my areas of interest are chin, nose, jaw, &amp; adam&#39;s apple,
</p>
<p>
3) Who would you recommend I consider? In other words, who do you see as being top-tier &amp; consistent &amp; trustworthy?
</p>
<p>
Thanks so so much in advance!

Is there any reason you aren&#39;t considering going back to Dr Spiegel for the areas that he didn&#39;t work on before, or to talk to him about the possibility of a revision on the jaw and adam&#39;s apple?
</p>
<p>
I had him do my ffs back in September and he did make a point when discussing the tracheal shave that he would do as much as he could, but wouldn&#39;t know for sure how much that would be until he was in there doing the work.
</p>
<p>
As an aside I&#39;m also very happy with the results. He worked magic on my nose, which was a revision of prior work from another surgeon that had developed a severe deviation.

No, honestly, I never considered it. He said the same to me about the tracheal shave. Do you take that to leave open the possibility that he didn’t do as much as he could’ve?  I’m going to reach back out to him, thanks so much for this suggestion lol. i dont know why i didn’t consider it

I think he did what he felt he safely could on the tracheal shave, no concerns from me there.
</p>
<p>
I also had a mandible reshaping and a little bit of a chin reduction and I&#39;m happy with the results. Everything blends nicely, and recovery has gone well so far.
</p>
<p>
I hope that things go smoothly for you and your thrilled with whatever you decide to get done.

Botox on the masseter works. My partner got it for  teeth grinding. It does wear off, and you should redo it every few years for awhile, but it was like $400 for them (so wayyy less than surgery). It does take time for the muscle to shrink, it’s not instant.

It’s been a long time, so I would ask the doctor you go to, but it was at least a few months. They didn’t get treated again, because they didn’t like the change to the jaw shape, and because they did things intentionally to exercise the masseter (chewing gum a lot, mewing), I can’t speak to the longevity of the effect.
