Today I had a fat transfer breast augmentation with cheek augmentation for facial feminization. Ask me questions you have and I’ll do my best to answer them. I will be adding updates on my recovery process for anyone curious about it.

How many CC did they inject ? Did your surgeon say what their typical retention rate is?

I was a little out of it post-surgery when he told me but what I think I remember him saying: 140cc per breast and 18cc per cheek.
</p>
<p>
He said the retention rate is about ~60%  - it is really hard to know bc you cannot go in and count the surviving cells the way you can measure the fat before it’s transplanted.
</p>
<p>
Right now (with the day of surgery swelling) I’m extremely happy with the results.

fabulous! I can say at 2 weeks post op my fat transfer they do shrink some :( but hopefully not too much. I do find that the shape for me at least and per my surgeon while a bit smaller than immediately post-op is dramatically improved.
</p>
<p>
I hope your healing goes swimmingly!
</p>
<p>
Are you considering multiple rounds? (I&#39;m doing a second round end of feb)

That’s great! I’m totally expecting the swelling to go down and for some fat cells to die, contributing to a change in the appearance. I think after a week whatever cells live, live and those that die, die. Trying to be soo gentle with areas where the fat was put so maximum cell survival happens.
</p>
<p>
Only planning on this one round because insurance covered this and I doubt they would cover another round.

So from my reading and also from my other fat grafting. Retainment is fairly settled after around 3 months. There is both the original swelling that has to go down and then the fat transferred has to vascularize with the surrounding tissue to ensure its survival - which is a longer process.

Totally! At 3 months the surviving fat cells go to sleep and wake up again 3-6 months after that. Pretty much what you’re saying I think.

PATIENCE is the mantra

Yay for you! :) he’s very talented! I decided on this method for a few reasons: -I do not  want “foreign objects” in my body  -The benefit of being able to feminize my cheeks and midsection as well -In my BA research and all my life I have not been a fan of the way implants look so when I found out about fat transfer I knew this could be what I wanted. -I wanted more control over how they could be shaped rather than their size increase  -Less complications and risks from what I understand  -Recovery time seems a bit easier -My new boobs will grow or shrink and change with my body over time

How is your result longer term? im currently looking into BA and fat transfer is my first choice for the reasons you stated
