Im afab, so i hope you get more knowledgeable responses from ppl who had this particular surgery, but from what i know from my kind of bottom surgery i would be concerned that this could be a fistula, a hole in the urethra that makes urine come out from a place it shouldnt, and may need surgical repair (some resolve on their own, but often with the use of a catheter in the meantime so the healing tissue isn‚Äôt being constantly irritated by urine). I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an ER-level thing, they can‚Äôt do much without your surgeon probably. But if they have an after-hours/emergency number I‚Äôd call and see if they have instructions until you can be seen.

Just got off the phone with the attending surgeon at my hospital. This isn‚Äôt anything to be worried about. This isn‚Äôt the best picture but it‚Äôs less of a hole or tunnel and more the top of my labia opening up, if that makes any sense. They told me nothing is wrong with my vagina and I look like I‚Äôm healing properly. Thank you for the tips!

I messaged my surgeon right away, but it might take her a few days to respond. Any info is helpful, thank you!

That actually happened to me. If it dosent clear up in a day or two contact your surgeon. Apparently its part of the healing process. It freaked me the fuck out when  it happened though
