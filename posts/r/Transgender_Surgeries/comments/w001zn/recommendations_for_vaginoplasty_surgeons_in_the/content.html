Hi! I&#39;m a trans girl living in the US and have been working on getting bottom surgery. I&#39;m mainly still trying to figure out which places and surgeons to look into for consultations. I&#39;ve been struggling to figure out where to go and am mostly worried about quality of care and results. I&#39;ve already had a few cases where I&#39;ve almost gone with a clinic before unearthing a bunch of negative stuff about it and feel a little lost in terms of where to go. Anyone who has or is going to get vaginoplasty, what are your recommendations?

To add to what others are saying, please avoid Kathy Rumer. You’ll probably find posts about why she’s bad but I have to mention it again.  Good luck with your search!

I had Nullification surgery 4.5 weeks ago by Dr Praful Ramenini with District Plastic surgery. He does a lot of vaginoplasties and I know 3 other people who had vaginoplasty with him. Though I wanted to be Nullified, I was coded under vaginoplasty with the hospital and insurance. My surgeon said it&#39;s the same surgery except for the things I didn&#39;t want like the labia and pocket for penetration. He even created a &#34;clit&#34; as he calls it. I tell people it&#39;s a button, because people associate a clit with a vagina. I&#39;ve had a a very good experience with him, he&#39;s very direct and easy to work with, and answers questions completely. He responded to email very quickly, even on his surgery days.  The people I know who have had the vaginoplasty are taking testosterone, and live as a male socially, as I continue to do, now with no genitals. The fact that this surgeon will help people transition MtF, those who want a &#34;mangina&#34; (their own term, not mine) and Male to Nullo shows he&#39;s very flexible. I highly recommend him. My own therapist retired during the pandemic, and my letters were too old for the insurance to accept, but he even recommended a therapist that works with him and it made things so easy. He&#39;s 3-1/2 hours drive from me, but he worked with me and understood I was out of town and was very responsive to telephone and email contact. It&#39;s been a very good experience

I think it’s a question that is personal and only you can decide. I would check out the trans wiki and see which results and techniques appeal to you.

Most will probably require electrolysis on the area so you might want to get ahead while you’re still looking for surgeons and get it as it takes a long time, In a lot of cases it’s covered by insurance. I’m getting it August 22 with Dr Min Jun in SF
