I had orchi at cosmetic concierge last Thursday, 2/13. Recovery has been very easy so far. Some observations:
</p>
<p>
The Bactrim antibiotic is kinda strong and makes me feel a bit sorta like I&#39;m drunk but without the high.
</p>
<p>
Ive had very minimal pain. Nothing that two advil didnt swiftly take care of.
</p>
<p>
The one thing that is unusual to me is the numbness where my scrotum used to be. It kinda goes thru the pins and needles sensation like when something goes to sleep and then wakes up again. Its not bad or anything, just unusual.
</p>
<p>
Today, I was finally able to take a shower again after having just washcloth wipe downs for 3 days. Felt so good!
</p>
<p>
Tried on leggings - hooray! Completely flat front. And no pain from tucking! So awesome!

<ul>
<li>
&#34;Was your surgeon Dr Hope Sherie? - Yes
</li>
<li>
Would you reccomend this surgeon? - Yes! The entire staff at her practice made the experience extremely stress-less.
</li>
<li>
How long was the wait list? - Consult was quick - within a month after I sent in the initial email. Surgery was two months after consult, based on my schedule (they had earlier dates available, but my schedule wouldnt pemit).
</li>
<li>
Did you need a psych letter? - You need one WPATH letter. Doesnt have to be from a psych. My endo wrote mine.
</li>
<li>
What did it cost? - Im not supposed to disclose.
</li>
</ul>
