25 year EMT here. I have also worked ER for 15 years. If you called for an ambulance and I saw this, I would be very concerned and rush you to the hospital. That is an advanced infection. That is not skin sloughing off it&#39;s purulent discharge. At 21 days postop, it shouldn&#39;t be that inflamed or swollen. I strongly urge you to get to a doctor immediately.
</p>
<p>
You can Google surgical incision purulent discharge
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a page I found with good info on colors of discharge.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bonesmart.org/wound-care-in-the-hospital/">https://bonesmart.org/wound-care-in-the-hospital/</a>
</p>
<p>
After you get it all sorted out, make sure to come back here and let us all know you&#39;re okay.

Perhaps the lighting in your photo changed the color of the discharge  - maybe that&#39;s the cause for the general alarm? To me, it looks distinctly green.

Good to know. It&#39;s always difficult to tell through a picture but here, the discharge definitely looks green which caused me to worry. I&#39;m super glad you&#39;re okay though!

Just saw your comment. I&#39;m concerned at how much you&#39;ve ripped open. You will need reconstruction of the labia at this point. When postop it&#39;s VERY important to severely limit your movement and to move as slowly as possible when getting out of bed.
</p>
<p>
You have so much swelling that your inner labial stitches are rotating outwards and stretching the urethral skin in which they&#39;re attached to.
</p>
<p>
And that white stuff definitely isn&#39;t skin sloughing off (unless you&#39;ve had a prolapse, in which case you need that dead skin cut out anyway). It&#39;s probably pus?
</p>
<p>
Looks like you also have tissue necrosis happening.
</p>
<p>
Are you keeping a hygienic routine? Wiping from front to back only and washing your hands and dilators often? Making sure others wash their hands before they touch you? Etc.
</p>

Don&#39;t worry darling, It&#39;s far from ruined. This is only temporary and the body has an amazing ability to heal.
</p>
<p>
The primary thing is you need to go back on antibiotics to eliminate the infection. Then the swelling will go down and you can go back later for a labial reconstruction.
</p>
<p>
Do not have your labia reconstruction today. You are there for antibiotic treatment.
</p>
<p>
When you get to the ER show them what it looked like immediately postop so they know what Dr. Hyer&#39;s work looked like initially.
</p>
<p>
In terms of reconstruction... I&#39;m sure Dr. Hyer can help you again. Things just need to be restitched. You&#39;re not alone in facing complications. For instance, I had about half the amount of wound separation that you have and also my body shed the outer layers of the scrotal graft that it didn&#39;t need and I had to go in and get that cut out. Once the scars are sealed in the next 2 months you can go in for laser treatment to minimize scarring. So don&#39;t you worry!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had this experience. Who was your surgeon, the one who decided to take a vacation with you in this state, the one who calls this ‚Äúnormal‚Äù?
</p>
<p>
Please seek some immediate medical attention. An outcome like this is specifically why my surgical team insisted on two weeks of close observation for rapid response to symptom onset.
</p>
<p>
Also, my fianc√©e has been concerned over my own surgical outcomes and healing process. May I share this image with him privately, anonymously? No hard feelings if not, I understand completely if you don‚Äôt want that to happen and will obviously respect your decision on the matter.

I also ripped open some sutures after surgery. It also looked kinda bad like yours but after it healed it  now looks not that bad anymore.
</p>
<p>
I too had white stuff but it wasnt puss. They told me puss smells Bad. mine didnt. I just had to wash it daily until it closed itself.
</p>
<p>
It might seem bad now but it will get better

I m glad you got it checked and you are feeling better. If you don&#39;t mind, please post and update later. The body heals very well and from what you said, you are already healing quite well. All the best.

Surgery recovery looks real gross and alarming sometimes, even when its going totally ok!

Had this process with some third degree burns which blew, you‚Äôre not alone.

You don&#39;t show any signs of infection, there&#39;s no redness, you don&#39;t have a fever, inflammation is there no matter what. It&#39;s likely major dehiscence, and it&#39;s possible to have that much tissue slough off.
</p>
<p>
The previous necrosis was worrisome.  That can occur from lack of blood flow, not necessarily an infection.
</p>
<p>
However, you can still heal.  You will likely want a revision.
</p>
<p>
I am very surprised your surgeon didn&#39;t call you in.

Funny bc t was downvoted and originally said everyone who called it an infection was wrong.

Glad to see your update!! Honestly even though there‚Äôs some issues surgery sites almost always look so much worse than it actually is. I wish you the best with the rest of your recovery!
