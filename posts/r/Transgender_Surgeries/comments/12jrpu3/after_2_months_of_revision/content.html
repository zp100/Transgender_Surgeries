May I ask what did he do in the revision? Do you have some labia minora?

Thank you for your question. On the outer labia were so called &#34;dogears&#34; overlapping skin from the first surgery. They have been removed. The inner labia was stripped a little bit. Also the vaginal canal on the entry point has been opened.
</p>
<p>
If you want to know more feel free to ask.

I am really curious to see more of the hidden parts like the labia minora. According to this picture, my kitty looks quite identical to yours which make me happy since there are not really comparable ones here from team Markovsky.

What do you mean by stripped? And also by ‚Äúopened‚Äù do you mean they widened the vaginal entrance?

Stripped means that they have wrapped a part and make it more tight. The vaginal entrance was been widened because of a stenosis.

I‚Äôm thinking about a revision for myself soon, opening the vaginal canal was painful? How soon after the surgery were you able to dilate again?

The revision was a little bit painful in general. I started dilation five days after surgery, right after the dressing materials were removed.

Not yet, I more than likely will within this year. My situation is a good deal different than what is &#34;normal&#34; for like 99% of trans people out there. I had genital birth defects that I&#39;ve had a lot of surgeries for and my urologist knows and is supportive of my wanting to transition. Only thing is the whole department is busy, so each appointment for consultation or otherwise is just a little slow right now.

I&#39;m so sorry to hear that. Do you need any support? Please let me know. At least I hope that you, even if it seems complicated, get a result with which you can arrange (please correct me  if I&#39;m wrong)

I appreciate it, though I think I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m almost 30 and been going through this my whole life so I&#39;d hope I&#39;m used to it by now lol. And yeah, despite my complications I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll just be happy to finally be &#34;less broken&#34; once everything is done. I just gotta wait now is all. :)

Hello. Thank you. I&#39;m also so happy with the results.  I waa also in the same hospital for the initial surgery. I got a vaginoplasty with full depth. Both labia has been created in the first session. I was 5 hours in sleep. Pain was moderate. I had no issues during the healing period (about 3 months).
</p>
<p>
I live in Germany and the costs are fully covered by health insurance. To get the coverage you have a lot of paperwork do and you need a lot of patience. After all it was worth the waiting.
</p>
<p>
Please let me know if you have further questions

Hello dear. Thank you for this really interesting question.  I wear pads a few weeks after the surgery because during the healing process my clotoris and the mucous membranes discharged a lot of wound secretion. Actually I only need some pads during my cycle (three days per month) because my prostate is very active during this time. I use cleaning wipes daily to clean my clotoris and also flush my vaginal canal twice a week.  Please let me know if you have further questions.
