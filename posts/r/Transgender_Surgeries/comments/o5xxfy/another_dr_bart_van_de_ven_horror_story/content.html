Please spread awareness:

Dr. Bart van de Ven needs his medical license removed asap and he needs to be locked the f up in my opinion. This is an extremely dangerous individual and he needs to never touch any womans face ever again. Check out this girl&#39;s post on Instagram to hear about her horrific experience. Trigger Warning tho, there is video evidence of Dr. Bart being verbally abusive and of him gaslighting his own patient so be warned.

‘You need treatment’
</p>
<p>
Well wtf, that’s what she sought and you botched her, what a cunt!
</p>
<p>
I was so desperate that I was gonna go to this man, so glad I’ve seen this, I remember reading about it on the U.K. sub. He needs to lose his job

You dodged a bullet honestly. I&#39;ve also been really close to going to him but I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t. Also the &#34;you need treatment&#34; thing is so fucking disrespectful i actually can&#39;t. She literally went to him for treatment for her Dysphoria and he has the audacity to say that???? What a fucking monster.

It seems like he expects us to he happy with anything cuz any result is an improvement in his mind. He obviously views transgender individuals as sick in the head. Also i can see a huuuuuuge ego in him like this mans ego is so unbelievably huge that he can&#39;t even admit to his own mistakes. Truly insane.

Yea the ego was what made me most sick. Most surgeons would admit when they fucked up but he was having non of it. He was trying to shut her down when she was trying to explain and there was absolutely no need to start swearing.

I just looked her results up and um... was she high off sumn or blackout drunk during her surgeries? These &#34;surgeons&#34; should be locked up. They&#39;re literally ruining lives.

The problem with this Dr. is it seems she gets a decent result every once in awhile.  This then encourages people who have insurance in PA and I think in most plans this doc is the only choice.

He has good results in people who have a big social media presence. Its always like that with him. If you have a following then that means you get a decent result, if you don&#39;t then he just doesen&#39;t care.

This guy has so many bad stories out there it’s a shame he still has a large clientele.  He is not the only one who seems to be having a lot of problematic results.  At some level, in our community, there needs to be oversight for Trans-Specialists.   There needs to be a better standard of training on trans specific procedures.  With the increasing importance of insurance, there should be less competition for patients and one would hope more professional camradery between practitioners.  Providers should also adopt a model more like that of Suporn offering long term care for patients, rather than a one shot and you are done approach.  I would also like to see an enviornment where if a particular surgeon “botches” a patient he refers that patient to someone who has the specialized skills to correct the problem.
</p>
<p>
All of that said, to be fair, we sometimes use the word “botch” too freely.  Sometimes outcomes may be less thanoptimal, but not actually botched.  We also need to be patient until enough time for proper healing has taken place.

I agree with you, though sometimes you can just tell right off the bat that you&#39;ve been botched. Yes swelling and healing process and all that are big factors but sometimes you just know right away.

I agree.  It’s such a difficult issue.  We just need a level and more cooperative playing field.  Most of the docs don’t want to get poor results-it’s bad for their practice.  The whole system is kind of dysfunctional because of the haphazard way doctors are trained, the recent introduction of insurance ($$$$) into our healthcare.  Etc.

All the surgeons who do gender affirming surgeries need to go through extra training and education in my opinion. It seems like many of them can just randomly operate on someone without fully being educated on what makes a face/body female or male.
