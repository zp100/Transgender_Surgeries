Looking good üëç.   I‚Äôm sure it takes a long time to fully settle down and for it to not show evidence of an operation.
</p>
<p>
Question for you, prior to the op did you have hair removal/electrolysis?    Was it only in the area of the vagina?
</p>
<p>
Am trying to understand the prework requirements before the actual op itself.   How long did it take etc, did the testicles skin require electrolysis?
</p>
<p>
Appreciate anything you can share

I think that photo was a little older, the scars are a little less noticable now. And personally I had laser first and did need to have electrolysis in most of the surrounding area, including testicles I believe. Different doctors have different requirements tho.

Nice - I think you have some nicely defined labia minora!  I think as things settle and finish healing and the swelling totally subsides, you are going to look amazing!
