This is what they told me. Seems like huge overkill since most over surgeons say 1-4 weeks before you should stop. Has anyone had any experience with doing hair removal less than 6 months before their surgery, or know why they ask for so much time to elapse between the last removal session and the surgery?

You’re probably best to follow his rule. His surgical technique is different and there’s not really enough info around to guide you in this. He’s got a big thing about aesthetics and skin condition. Recovery is harder with Suporn as well, so who knows if you could make that even worse.
</p>
<p>
The chance of there being hair inside if you don’t get rid of it seems relatively low, although I have heard of quite a few cases.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, to get rid of hair properly you should be leaving about a year once it’s fully cleared since to be sure it’s gone. Almost no one does that.

Thanks, yes I’ve combed the wiki a few times (thanks for your efforts btw, it’s helped me a lot over the years) and there’s not much consensus about the whole hair removal necessity for suporn. I’ve done 5 months electrolysis, will do another 3, and then I’ll do my 6 month wait. It’s not ideal for sure but I think it’s enough given the small (I think) risk of hair growing deep and inaccessible post surgery. and there’s no way I can wait a whole year from my last session. Unless it was critical.

I’d try to get it cleared as soon as possible, then keep it cleared. Just don’t risk skin damage by intense treatment.
</p>
<p>
I forget exactly, but it’s less than a year for genital hair. It’s in there somewhere.
</p>
<p>
You know it’s just a small patch?

Just the Perineum, I know, but I’ve found a few comments/posts that suggest that getting hair removed from the shaft, around the base is also a good idea. Basically I do one hour per week and clear anything on the perennial first and then just move onto other areas until the hour is up. I figure it’s better than nothing. But I only started doing this approach recently so when I stop (6 months before surgery) I’ll probably have about 7-8 months of keeping the perineum clear, and about 3 months of other areas. Ideally I’d do longer but the wait is taking its toll, and to a lesser extent the pain and cost of course

Because any hair that&#39;s left after his surgery is in the vestibule, it&#39;s all accessible to remove after the surgery as well. My guess is that the full six months isn&#39;t strictly necessary, but it&#39;s not a big deal to leave some hairs like it might be with a different surgical technique. Also you should make sure you get hair removed from the perineum only. Everything else is unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
Edit: this is all suporn specific advice.

Thank you, I’ve been doing the perineum plus other areas (to be safe) for about 5 months now, I plan to do another 3 months and then start my 6 month wait for surgery. It just seems like such a long wait, but I’ll do it of course, just want to understand why the 6 months extra

You don&#39;t need to do anything but the perineum for Suporn. I recommend saving your time and money instead.

I went with suporn and had no hair removal (at their guidance). I&#39;ve had no issues with hair as their process removed all.

This is reassuring. Congrats as well on 5 years recently! Hope it’s been mostly complication free

Their is a specific reason you are asked by Suporn clinic to wait longer. This is that electrolysis leaves micro scarring and micro scarring makes the Suporn process, at times significantly longer. So yes, by all means get the perineal area completed six months before, and remember Laser treatment isn&#39;t always successful or permanent.
</p>
<p>
And you should be aware that the Suporn clinic won&#39;t include any form of treatment for hair removal for offending hairs that may be impacting dilation around the Introitus during any revision that is claimed.

my fourth and last laser hair removal session was maybe 2 weeks before my surgery! mostly due to scheduling issues with the laser technician. everything went well though.

I’m getting a full depth vaginoplasty in late November. My surgeon said get as much hair removed with laser as I could before the surgery and he would take care of the rest during the surgery. I will have had 5 sessions before the surgery with the last being 2 weeks before surgery.

They say that on the website but once you get in touch they tell you that removing hair from the perineum is strongly advised. Surprised they didn’t mention this to you, it was literally in the very first email reply from them I received

My surgeon said to leave 1 month between final electrolysis session and surgery for healing purposes.
</p>
<p>
When you do electrolysis it’s important to let some time pass to see how much regrowth there is
