After a surgery when I had a catheter in, when the catheter was removed my prostate expanded. It caused a similar problem, urine trickling out. I went back to the doctor immediately and they put the catheter back in, until surgery a month later to trim the prostate. I was told that pressure can cause damage to the kidneys and that is serious. So my take is that this is a problem and a catheter should be in until resolved.

How long did your prostate take to expand? I had a catheter for 6 + 12 days (had to be reinserted as I had painful urination). I think I was peeing normally for a few weeks after it was taken out taken out.

I had no problems peeing pre catheter but when it was taken out the day after surgery it expanded to restrict urination and had to be surgically trimmed, about a month later, with the catheter reinserted to allow flow, reduce pressure.

Ah, how did they tell it was your prostate? Dr Bellringer, when he inspected me, only pulled my labia apart, but I never had a camera or anything to rule out the prostate being the issue.

This was at a urology practice in 2017. What I recall is that with the bladder filled they observed flow with ultrasound to find the stricture.

I went down today to try and get a catheter put in, but my urethra opening was too constricted, and wouldn&#39;t go in. Just one thing after another...

It is very fucking unreasonable. I don&#39;t give a dang what type  of dr it is. Stand your ground and demand to be seen.
