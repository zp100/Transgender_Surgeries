Yes I saw him in 2012. I had hairline advancement where my scalp was separated from my skull and pulled forward 1.5&#34;. Common side effects are numbness in the scalp for a while. Also had brow bone shave to feminize the area above the eyes. Rhinoplasty, which helped a bunch and improved my breathing too because I had a deviated septum that I didn&#39;t know about. Also had a upper lip lift and lip augmentation with fat removed from my tummy.
</p>
<p>
My main complication was a paralyzed left vocal cord. Luckily the nerve regained some function after 6 months. I saw 2 doctors after FFS about my loss of voice function. One said it was due to a blood clot during surgery that killed the nerve. The other said it was due the endotracheal tube being overinflated during the surgery which damaged the nerve. I tend to believe the 2nd one is what happened. Most likely due to an inexperienced anesthesiologist. Her name was Veronica.
</p>
<p>
Be aware folks that the an anesthesiologist can be just as important as the doctor you pick for the surgery. They literally hold your life in their hands and can mess you up if they don&#39;t know what they are doing.

Regular. It worked well for me but my forehead did not need much contouring.

I had type 3 forehead contouring  a few months ago with Dr. Cardenas. I think he did a pretty good job. I wasnâ€™t in too much pain and the recovery house is beautiful.
