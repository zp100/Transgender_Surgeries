I‚Äôm 4 weeks post op and wondering if anyone else has had this issue.  Unless my legs are spread, instead of being side to side my inner right labia will push on top of the left and sort of turn the whole thing to the left.  I‚Äôm not sure if this is just due to swelling or other factors as it has only been 4 weeks.
</p>
<p>
CW: Below I‚Äôll discuss a bit more in detail on swelling and wounds  I know in general my right labia has just a bit more swelling than the left.  The outer right labia seems to hang a bit compared to the left.  I did have wound separation along the perineum with the right side being more separated than the left, so I have noticed the vaginal opening is not as tight or sturdy on the right.
</p>
<p>
Is any of this a similar experience for anyone?  Is there any cause for alarm or is it just a case of ‚Äúsurgeries are weird and so are vaginas.‚Äù

4 weeks! Your body is still wondering what the bloody hell just happened.
</p>
<p>
With massive invasive trauma invariably comes swelling which can take months to settle down and things will take time to find their natural place, this is why revisions are often done long after the initial surgery.
</p>
<p>
Without photo&#39;s we can&#39;t obviously tell if you&#39;re worrying about nothing or not, but do go easy on yourself, it&#39;s a good year until you can be 100% sure of what you&#39;ve got and then judge the situation accordingly.

I&#39;ve no experience whatsoever in this, as I&#39;ve not had bottom surgery yet. But with all the posts, pics and information I&#39;ve educated myself on, it&#39;s going to be difficult to tell this early if it&#39;s an issue. There is so much swelling on inside and outside, putting pressure on soft tissue, what you see is more than likely not the finished picture yet. I&#39;m guessing more time will be needed. I bet others will respond that can be of more help than I before long. Congratulations on getting this done, I&#39;d love to be in your shoes. üòä

I‚Äôm eight weeks and still seeing things happen. Hang in there, it takes up to a year for everything to settle. Still can‚Äôt pee in a straight line.
