They are both very good, but have I think have different philosophies. FT seems to prefer preserving the basic feel of the face while bringing out its feminine aspect, they&#39;re probably good for &#34;you look like your sister.&#34; DB follows Dr O (worth reading his book) seems to aim more for mathematical beauty proportions with less concern for initial features.  Either way it&#39;s still &#34;you, but different&#34; at the end.
</p>
<p>
I went with DB due to being on same continent and a good consultation. Honestly my face was so different and injured I could barely stand it for like 3 months after. Now at 6 months it&#39;s great, I barely even recognize my old face; before I thought I passed ok-ish but looking back that face was so obviously trans compared to what I have now. So DB was a good decision for me but I think FT would have been good, too.
</p>
<p>
I think people tend to complain about both DB and FT&#39;s jaws, it&#39;s important to keep in mind there&#39;s lots of muscles and nerves down there so if they seem conservative in some area they&#39;re trying to avoid certain risks. Sliding genioplasty literally cuts your jaw apart and bolts it back together, not something you want to go wrong :P
</p>
<p>
Be sure to get the VFS offered by FT either way in my opinion. I didn&#39;t and afterwards wished I had a better idea what to expect from FFS -- DB just plays on his iPad for a couple minutes and it really doesn&#39;t give much of an idea what it will look like. I think mine turned out great in the end, but after surgery it was a hard couple months wondering if I would always look as awful as I did when I first got the bandages off :P
</p>
<p>
Tldr: I faced the same decision and went with DB, but honestly think you won&#39;t go wrong with either. Worth checking out a couple additional ones anyway just for more opinions, you&#39;ve only got one face :)

More change isn&#39;t necessarily more artificial. One big difference between the two is DB does aim for a narrower jaw while FT tends to keep a bit more of a strong jaw. Neither is &#34;wrong&#34; since both are within the range of what&#39;s common for women, they&#39;re just different. And we&#39;re talking aesthetics if left to their own decisions -- if you tell DB you want this but not that I&#39;m sure he can do it.
</p>
<p>
But in any case I think you should schedule consults with both, and be sure to bring up your preferences you mention here. That&#39;s going to be the best way to decide.

If forehead reconstruction is the primary goal you can’t go wrong with Facial Team, plus they’re way cheaper than DB. I’m not in love with what Facial Team did to my chin, but the forehead work couldn’t be better.

I&#39;m consulting for a revision on my jaw, not because they did a bad job (they did an amazing job) but because I want to see if it&#39;s possible to go further.

I can’t speak for people who have used the FT, but I can say that I’m delighted with the results I got from DB, including my jaw and chin. I had my forehead done too (also delighted), but I’m a rare type 4 so I might not be the best gauge in that area.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Ousterhout" rel="nofollow">Dr. Douglas Ousterhout
</a>
(who basically chose Dr Deschamps-Braly to be his successor) is considered to be one of the (if not THE) pioneers of FFS. He literally ‘wrote the book’ about FFS and described 4 basic types of foreheads. Types 2 and 4 need to be built up rather than have bone removed. Dr O said I was a 4, the rarest, Dr DB said I was a 2. I’m going with the guy who wrote the book but I have nothing but respect and gratitude for Dr DB.

I went with DB and I&#39;m happy with the results, the whole experience was positive. My results look natural, people recognize me but I look more feminine although tbh my face wasn&#39;t that masculine to start with. I guess a more masculine face would result in a more dramatic change.
</p>
<p>
I think DB is more aggressive than FT. DB has a nearby office perform a CT scan at the consultation so he knows exactly how much he can remove from the brow and orbital rims.
</p>
<p>
DB and FT have a different approach to hairline advancement, with DB he places the incision at the hairline and after about 6 months it can be covered with hair transplants if required. I felt the approach taken by DB is better.
</p>
<p>
DB places the incision for trachea shave under the chin, 2 months after my surgery its almost invisible. Not sure how FT do it but worth checking.

When I went in for the consultation and pre surgery meeting I told him he was free to do what he felt was needed but I wanted a natural look and that&#39;s exactly what he delivered. At the consultation he will show lots of photos so it&#39;s a good time to highlight anything you really like or dislike.

Also - unrelated - love your name. Was so close to choosing Charlie and sometimes still wish I had :)

Thanks:) when I started thinking about names it just clicked as being the one for me. Since then I&#39;ve been asked by so many people when am I going to change my name.... I had no idea how confusing it would be for people in some countries🤣
