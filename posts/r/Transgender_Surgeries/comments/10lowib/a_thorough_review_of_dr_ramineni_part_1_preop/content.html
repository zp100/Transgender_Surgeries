This little series of mine is going to be highlighting my experiences choosing Dr. Ramineni as my surgeon. My goal is to provide as much info as possible so that people can make an informed decision towards whether they would or wouldn&#39;t want him to be their surgeon. Especially since he does roughly 135 vaginoplasties a year, but not many people highlight their journeys from going with him. This part will be focusing on my consultation, how long from consultation to surgery, and issues with insurance.
</p>
<p>
I had my initial consultation with Dr. Ramineni on 10/20/22. I went in knowing that Dr. Ramineni tends to talk fast, but luckily I enjoy info dumps and asking questions during info dumps. I came into my consultation with 30ish questions that my therapist and I had helped build up. Dr. Ramineni was really good about being interrupted. If a question I had was relevant to something he just brought up I would raise my hand or say excuse me then insert my question into the relevant spot in our convo.
</p>
<p>
After he did his big breakdown and I got all my questions answered (he&#39;ll answer everything, but if you don&#39;t bring questions up he assumes you know or that you&#39;re all good) I asked how soon would I be able to get a surgery date. He then directed me to his right hand lady Katie who explained that since they were making the switch to prioritizing vaginoplasties over all other procedures that once I got my 2 letters in I could look to have a surgery date roughly 2-3 months after that point. I left that consultation feeling heard and happy knowing I just had to make the push for my letters asap.
</p>
<p>
Then came the rushing for both letters; Dr. R&#39;s team does hope to knock it down to just the 1 letter req soon thanks to WPATH&#39;S SoC v8. My first letter was easy with my main gender therapist. Then I had to call 16 different gender therapists that were on galap to find one that had availability (she was on maternity leave and took time to see me anyways ðŸ’—).
</p>
<p>
Once my letters were sent in I got offered 8 dates ranging from late Jan-early March. I chose 1/24/23 as my surgery date because it fit my work schedule/timeline. Then I got notification 3 weeks later that my insurance Aetna authorized the surgery after a peer to peer review with Dr. Ramineni (they were my previous insurance before the start of the year).
</p>
<p>
2 1/2 weeks before my surgery I got a call from Dr. R&#39;s team that my insurance had been terminated and asked if I could check into it. I came to find out my mom&#39;s work switched to BCBS. I contacted my new insurance gave all the relevant info to both my new insurance and Dr. Ramineni&#39;s team.
</p>
<p>
5 days before my surgery that was scheduled for Tuesday the 24th of Jan I had received a notification that my surgery time was scooting to the last possible slot in the day due to my new insurance dragging their feet. But 2 1/2 week before my insurance promised they would be working on my authorization ASAP even if my surgeon&#39;s office didnt put it in as an expedited request (which Dr. R&#39;s team did label it as).
</p>
<p>
Come to find out that my insurance wasn&#39;t processing it at all ðŸ™„. After several calls on Thursday the 19th I finally got in touch with someone at my insurance and they claimed my surgeon&#39;s office didn&#39;t put it as an expedited request (Lie #1). Then they told me that they would work as fast as possible getting it to the medical director but there was no possible way to contact them (Lie #2).
</p>
<p>
On the following Monday, a day before my surgery, I had enough and wanted to start talking to people with actual power to resolve things so I started asking for supervisors. I was promised that they would contact the medical director to make sure it gets processed since my surgery was the following morning.
</p>
<p>
At 5:45pm, 15 min after their call center closed I got told that they hadn&#39;t gotten any response yet (Lie #3). After pushing further the lady finally started clicking things and actually saw that the medical director denied my authorization (for an entirely bogus reason). I got told that there would be no time for them to fit in a peer to peer review and that my surgery would most likely be cancelled (Lies #4 and 5). I immediately start balling my eyes out feeling like I had fucked up somehow and should have done more. My mom and BFF where doing their best to calm me down. But having done bowel prep and not eating all day really fucked my energy lvls.
</p>
<p>
The juicy end to this nonsense will have to be saved for my next post, but a tldr is Dr. Ramineni fought hard for me and was able to get a new authorization 30 min before my scheduled surgery time. I&#39;m going to go back to resting up with my new pussy ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜³ðŸ¥³!!! See you peeps in my next post! ðŸ¥°ðŸ’—ðŸ’ž

Looking forward to your next chapter. I had Dr. Ramineni do my surgery over a year ago. She&#39;s been fantastic ever since. My problem was that I filled out all the hospital&#39;s documents and meet with a nurse but when it came to insurance - my company sent everything in to the hospital but they couldn&#39;t find my records - I was calling and calling to see whether they got them.  For a week they claimed the authorization had not come in. Then one day I got referred to a supervisor who looked and couldn&#39;t find anything, He then asked me my name and looked it up under my name rather than my DOB - it all suddenly popped up - some one had entered my DOB wrong and no body until I got that supervisor, looked up my actual name. ENJOY YOUR NEW PUSSY!!

Finished writing my post after waking up for a bit but Dilaudid ended up putting me back to sleep before I could respond to you! I&#39;m going to try my best to trickle these out as I have the energy to type them. Thank you for all the love tho and I am sooo happy to have my gal now! I got my first glimpse of her today and omg am I excited for how she looks! I didn&#39;t get a chance to look at her with a mirror yet but already she looks so cute from top down!
</p>

It&#39;s truly amazing to have this new equipment, going to be painful and annoying for a few weeks but after you heal is when the real fun starts.  Get your rest and live this experience - it&#39;s a fantastic journey. XOX

My company has Blue_Cross_Blue_Shield of SC. They covered my hormones up until the start of 2023, now I have to pay out of pocket for my Estradiol and Spironolactone and it makes me a little bit confused. If they won&#39;t cover my bottom surgery I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do.

I had surgery with Dr. Ramineni last April and recently had revision surgery with him. Iâ€™m so happy with my results, and he has been an amazing surgeon to work with. He is so responsive and kind. Every question I have gets answered, and every email I send with a question gets a response within 2 hours at most.

Hi! I&#39;ve just scheduled a consultation with him; this series is so so helpful! Thank you so much for doing this. I&#39;m curious; did he recommend any electrolysis or laser on the donor sites beforehand?
