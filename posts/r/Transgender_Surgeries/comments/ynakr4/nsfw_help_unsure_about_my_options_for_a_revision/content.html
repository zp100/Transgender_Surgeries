I personally would not go back the same doctor for revision. The good news is I think a better doctor can do a lot to make it better. It sounds like you have excess erectile tissue and excess skin. I would get second and third opinions elsewhere from people that have a lot of experience.

Why not? I&#39;m not sure about general aesthetics, but at least in Germany, most surgeons plan two surgeries and this would be normal stuff to solve during the second surgery.

Because the issues are not “normal” issues you’d solve in a second surgery. Excess erectile tissue isn’t a minor tidy-up, and I’m seeing several other things that I believe show a surgeon who is not skilled in modern up-to-date techniques. This isn’t a planned result, and it’s going to take somebody with experience to solve the issues.

I went to Dr. Ganor at Boston Children’s, i thought it looked alright but when i’m aroused it bulges out and looks strange, and theres a lot of skin covering the hole to give it a smaller appearance but it makes penetration difficult. Should i try to get a revision with him again? if not please give recommendations of who to see (and is covered by my connecticut insurance). Is there any way to make it look and function like a natal vagina at this point? I’m also worried that my clit and urethra are way too high up, is there anything that can be done for that?

Based on what you’re describing (not a doctor), it sounds like your two issues are excess erectile tissue and the skin webbing covering the vaginal opening. Those two issues are pretty common and should be relatively simple. What does Dr Ganor think? Has he brought up the idea of a revision to you?
</p>
<p>
If you want to go elsewhere for a revision, maybe check the NYC surgeons with shorter waits like Purohit or Ting

seconding Ting and Purohit, who are both extremely accomplished at revisions and can 100% make OP&#39;s vag look more &#34;natal&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Sorry I&#39;m not sure who would be on Connecticut insurance. Check the Wiki maybe?

Dr Ganor’s main things he does are FTM top surgery and FTM phalloplasty. I would not trust him to do a revision for you after this. There are vaginoplasty surgeons at boston medical center, mass general, and brigham and women’s if you’re interested in still trying to stay local to CT. I’m a trans man so i don’t have experience with vaginoplasty myself but people in the area speak highly of these 3 surgery teams. The MGH team that did my phallo also works with the MTF patients and they were wonderful.

I’m always advocating her because her results look great but I would look into Wittenberg for a revision if you got the money or insurance she takes.

Looks to me like there&#39;s excessive erectile tissue, and that&#39;s also probably pushing your clit and urethra up. So, I&#39;d see about reducing that. Also, you&#39;ve got nice labia minora, but I&#39;d see about freeing up the lower part and bringing them down to frame the vagina. That also would tend to bring the clit and urethra down a bit, especially if the hood was a little better defined. So, that too.

What CT insurance do you have? It may be possible to go outside of traditional network coverage if you can convince them there is no in-network provider up to the task.

I have the same issue at my fourchette that has healed too tight. It makes penetration painful even with the smallest dilator. I&#39;m having an episotomy to rectify / cut that part out along with some other stuff.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure about the other bits but the fourchett is a relatively quick easy fix.
