Edit: thanks to all the wonderful gals that helped me out. I feel like I&#39;ve learned so much and now I&#39;m anticipating the day even more c:
</p>
<p>
I am MtF and will start HRT soon. I know I&#39;m a long way from SRS since I&#39;m pretty broke right now but I had a lot of questions regarding what it&#39;s like to have a vagina.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
How much does the recovery suck?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What does it feel like to walk, sit in various positions or anything else post op? Assuming it would be just a bit different.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Does SRS increase lower body flexibility?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Did you have to change medication (HRT) Afterward since there are no more testicles to fight your hormone balance?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What does it feel like to touch it? Does it feel like it&#39;s always been there? If you were to run a finger from one side to the other, does it feel like your doing that or a tad bit different? Or does it take time to get used to the feeling of it being there?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Can you masterbate like you could pre-op? (Buildup and eventual orgasm) Did it take your body time to rewire your connection to your genitals sexually? Is it harder or easier to masterbate? Are orgasms different?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Are there any complications with sex? (He&#39;s too big, or you can&#39;t stretch enough, or you aren&#39;t deep enough?)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Are there any scary things you could do to accidentally hurt yourself after surgery?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How does it feel to where tight clothing post SRS compare to prior?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Is your clitoris more sensitive than your labia/inside?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Is it harder to hold your pee? (I heard it&#39;s harder for vagina havers, could be a myth, never researched it.)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thank you so much for helping me. I&#39;m extremely curious and also jealous lol. I really want to be able to imagine the day it finally happens. I haven&#39;t even started hormones yet D:

More annoying than painful. You&#39;ll have to stay in hospital for a time after (usually a week-ish) and the overall recovery time can be a little long (this changes depending on the surgeon). Plus dilating afterwards (decreasing the more you recover) can get annoying pretty quickly
</li>
<li>
The same? Obviously there&#39;s nothing in the way anymore between your legs anymore haha. Sitting in the weeks after surgery (while you&#39;re recovering) is awkward.
</li>
<li>
No?
</li>
<li>
No more T blockers :) My E stayed the same, some people go down in dose
</li>
<li>
It feels completely natural and like it was always meant to be there :)
</li>
<li>
Nope. You&#39;ll need to relearn from the ground up. For me it&#39;s no easier/harder, just different. It can take a few months for everything to feel &#34;settled&#34; enough to figure it out (YMMV)
</li>
<li>
Sometimes depth can be an issue if they&#39;re too big, especially if they&#39;re girthier. Cis girls tend to have these same experiences though :) Most trans girls have the same average/relative depth to cis girls, although trans vag&#39;s tend not to be as &#34;stretchy&#34; (from what I&#39;ve heard)
</li>
<li>
Just take it easy while you&#39;re recovering and don&#39;t have sex too soon
</li>
<li>
Amazing (Imagine never having to tuck again)
</li>
<li>
Yes, definitely
</li>
<li>
Not really? The urethra&#39;s shorter but the muscles that hold everything in shouldn&#39;t be affected
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These are my experiences so they will probably be different to many other girls. I had mine done 2ish years ago :)

I agree with everything but number 11. I&#39;ve had some incontinence issues ever since my op (2 years ago). I&#39;m unsure how to solve them tbh, I&#39;ve talked to a few doctors and nobody is really confident enough with my neo-vagina and have all scratched their heads and not really given me any advice.
</p>
<p>
I leak...a lot. I have to wear a pad every day (I use washable cloth pads).

I would say that this isn&#39;t Typical, but unfortunately is a common complication of GRS, and it sucks ass :(

Honestly it&#39;s a mixed bag. On one hand I didn&#39;t find it very painful at all or really bad in general...it was just boring sitting around for 2 weeks.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Much more comfortable. No more wondering if my crotch is notice is alone a huge comfort.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not as far as I&#39;m aware or noticed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
No more spiro, and my e has stayed the same but I&#39;m still working on getting my levels checked.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Once everything healed up and I could really touch it I noticed how quickly it felt completely natural. Like it was always there to begin with. Its also very soft!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It is a very, very different experience tbh. Pre-hrt, post-hrt and post-op are all very different feelings. It took a good amount of experimentation to figure out what my body responds to but I can tell you I sure love it now.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not there yet, but I can say that if you dilate on schedule it shouldn&#39;t be an issue. #4 dilator is huge for a reason. My vibe fits just fine.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Plenty during recovery. Follow ALL your doctors orders! Post recovery though just common sense shit. Don&#39;t try to force anything up there, never go back and forth during sex, they still need protection so you don&#39;t get stds etc. Same stuff as cis vaginas.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
So much nicer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Absolutely. Clit &gt;labia&gt;inside
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not noticbly for me but your mileage may very.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

The hardest thing for me was having to explain why you’re out of commission to friends and family for so long and then being out of normal life for so long.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Euphoric. Though it will change your life. No need to fear in changing rooms and bathrooms. There’s nothing to hide!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I’m not sure what you mean by this. I did enjoy going to yoga class more because there was nothing embarrassing that could fall out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yes, I no longer had to take T blockers and my liver and kidneys are thankful.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It fully becomes a part of who you are, like it’s always been there. But it stays exciting, like genitals probably are supposed to be like.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
This is the hardest part. It’s completely different and I’m still trying to understand it (and it’s been a few years).  Orgasms are different and more of an experience you plan for after some wine 😛
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There are complications with sex. My husband needs to lube up and go slow in the beginning. The depth bugs me more than the width. I feel embarrassed when he hits the end of my depth. But this happens in cis sex!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not myself. Just be careful.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Life changing, euphoric. I can go to yoga, hike, swim, everything now.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The question is kind of hard to understand in how it’s written, sorry.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It’s just different. A story I always tell is about how I was sad after GCS that I couldn’t pee standing up in the woods on hikes anymore. You can always carry around a women’s personal urinal device though, even for public bathrooms.

1 - It was mostly just annoying.
</p>
<p>
2 - Surprisingly similar, but somewhat more comfortable. Less junk getting in the way.
</p>
<p>
3 - Maybe a little yeah, I&#39;ve yet to get going again fully at the gym to find out.
</p>
<p>
4 - I just stopped taking Spiro (yay, I can now eat bananas again)
</p>
<p>
5 - It feels pretty natural, I did get a mild weirdness sensation at the very first, but it went away quickly.
</p>
<p>
6 - I can. It&#39;s a bit harder, but it takes a while to get used to the rewiring, and it also takes a while for everything to recover enough for it to be feasible/fun to mess around with. But, I can definitely orgasm.
</p>
<p>
7 - Haven&#39;t had those issues yet. But make sure you dilate dutifully. I did 3x45 minute sessions a day for the first 3 months, now I&#39;m at 1-2x 45 minute sessions a day, but I should probably try to keep it at 2x at least. I have a decent sized dildo I can use without issue.
</p>
<p>
8 - Probably. Don&#39;t mess with the sutures. Don&#39;t put weird stuff in there, make sure to dilate properly.
</p>
<p>
9 - A lot better
</p>
<p>
10 - Yes, the prime location to stimulate during masturbation seems to be the area between the clitoris and the vaginal opening. But your experience may vary
</p>
<p>
11 - No, surprisingly easy, except maybe the first couple of weeks.

With Dr Bank (Suporn’s trainee), 8 months post op -
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
For me personally, mostly just annoying, though I’d say a good quarter of Suporns patients I recovered with struggled significantly with dilation pain, so keep that in mind if considering him.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Honestly about the same 99% of the time.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Does not, sadly.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Personally did not, since just E+P was enough to suppress my T. If you’re on an androgen blocker then it almost certainly wont be needed anymore, and if it’s too low, you may need to TAKE a small amount of testosterone.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
This one’s kinda cool. Right out of the hospital, I still felt “phantom sensations” whenever I touched it (ie would feel sensation out where my dick used to be as if I still had it and was touching it). After a few months, my brain recalibrated, and it feels normal and natural, like touching any other part of the body. Hard to explain.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
MUCH harder. All the notorious difficulty some CIS girls endure learning to masturbate, except yours doesn’t work
<em>
quite
</em>
the same, so no one can help you. Just experiment though and see what feels good, and when you figure it out the first time it gets much easier from there.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I’m too small for most partners, though they all like the tight feel. My solution is to have sex after dilation when everything’s opened up the most, and let my partner control insertion so I don’t hurt them.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yes during initial recovery (varies based on technique so ask your surgeon), but after a few months you’re fine.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
MUCH better!! Honestly one of my main motivations for getting it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yea. I don’t know of any surgeon who fully constructs the clitoris, and Suporns technique doesn’t put any sensitive material inside the vagina, so the glans is the main sensate area.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yes... actually. I didn’t expect it but there was a significant difference.
</p>
</li>

Quick question Does penis size pre-op = depth post-op and if so is it based on flaccid size or erect size. Thanks x

Depends on the surgical technique. Since my surgeon made the vagina exclusively out of scrotal skin, depth had nothing to do with penis size. I’m not sure how it works with other surgeons, though I suspect it’s more complicated.

Every surgeon I know of only creates the glans (the external portion), not the internal structure.

Not the same, but Suporn keeps more than usual. His secondary sensate organ.

Just for context, I&#39;m 22 and had bottom surgery like 3 months ago.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Recovery wasn&#39;t too bad. The worst part BY FAR TIMES A THOUSAND were the five days of basically being bed ridden immediately after surgery. I have adhd and having to sit there in one position gave me a few panic attacks. I can imagine it being much more difficult for older women, though. I was also really fortunate to have the surgery at the time I did because I just graduated college and with quarantine and no real obligations, I have no restrictions when it comes to dilating. If I had to dilate 4x/day in the midst of a semester or a full-time job, it would have added a considerable amount of stress. Dilating hasn&#39;t been painful for me, but absolutely requires a good bit of conscientiousness and discipline. For instance, I&#39;ve gone on two trips since surgery and even though I was only doing 3x/day at that point, it felt odd isolating myself from most people for intervals throughout the day.
</li>
<li>
Immediately after surgery (up to three weeks) walking was very tiresome and had to be done mindfully. I walk for hours every day now and it feels similar; one difference is that I&#39;m not constantly worried about my tuck coming undone; another thing is that I still wear a pad constantly (I&#39;ve heard most people do for up to 6 months) and that can just add an obstacle for total freedom of leg movement. Sitting is normal, though I had to use a little cushion for about 3 weeks or lie on my back. TLDR: it&#39;s not much different.
</li>
<li>
I have a congenital joint disorder and I couldn&#39;t imagine being any more flexible. so i dont know.
</li>
<li>
Apart from stopping spironolactone, I didn&#39;t change my hormones; mainly because my levels were really shitty before surgery. I got my first lab results back last week and they&#39;re night and day different already. I&#39;m considering in the future adding a bit of testosterone, though, to help with libido, of which I have none. I&#39;m not going to make this call at least until my next blood lab (in three months or so/6 mos post-op), just to see if anything changes on its own. That being said, having little sex drive has probably been good in terms of my recovery lol
</li>
<li>
(a) it feels like touching a vagina, I guess? I understand this probably an oversimplified answer to your complex question, but it feels exactly what I knew it would feel like, if that makes sense? (b) Emotionally it feels like it&#39;s always been there but logically I&#39;m well aware that it hasn&#39;t. I had a really strong aversion to thinking about my pre-op parts - I almost never did. (c) The only thing that took adjustment time for me were certain muscle-memories I had picked up from having external genitals. For example, for about two weeks after surgery I&#39;d stand up from peeing and expect to have to put things in place to tuck away, only for there to be nothing to put away lmao
</li>
<li>
I absolutely cannot masturbate like I could pre-op. I&#39;ve only begun exploring this within the last three weeks or so. I feel a sexual response in my genitals, like when something arouses me things down there start to tingle and throb a bit and swell with warmth, so that part of the connection is absolutely there. I think the part that&#39;s missing isn&#39;t so much about rewiring as it is about psychological hangups, of which I have a lot. I&#39;ve always struggled to see myself as a sexual agent, or someone worthy of their own sexual pleasure; in a sort of counterintuitive way, this made pre-op orgasms easier to come by than they are now. My genitals now feel like they belong to me, but as such, I have a hard time using them for my own pleasure. This is surely a personal issue for me, and not to be taken as a general outcome of this surgery. Everyone carries a lot of pain and this just so happens to be where I keep mine.
</li>
<li>
At this point I couldn&#39;t handle an average sized man right off the bat. I probably could after I&#39;d dilated for five or ten minutes, or maybe after being fingered. At least with my surgeon, and I&#39;d presume others&#39;, after about 2 months things start to really tighten up. That being said, it&#39;s only tighter in the &#39;resting&#39; phase, if you will. I&#39;ve been able to accommodate more and more girth as time goes on. My vagina is deeper than most cis women&#39;s.
</li>
<li>
Yeah, probably, though I am generally a nervous person and tend to err on the side of caution. Shaving for the first time was really nerve-wracking. There were certain precautions I had to take immediately following surgery, all of which I was informed of by my surgeon; rolling into bed rather than falling or sitting into it normally, using the cushion when sitting upright, to name two.
</li>
<li>
gagaahhhhhhhhhh amazing!!! so free. I never could have imagined pre-op the full extent to which dealing with external parts weighed on me throughout the day. I got a pair of yoga pants and lots of cute panties to celebrate :-)
</li>
<li>
big yes. but the sensations are different! I can expand on this if you&#39;d like.
</li>
<li>
No it&#39;s not harder, if anything taking spironolactone made holding my pee the most difficult.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Feel free to DM me whenever and about whatever &lt;3

I am just shy of a year post op. To answer:  1: Recovery was not that bad. The catheter was unpleasant but I was up and walking the next day and had an overall issue-free experience. Dilating initially is very time consuming,  but not terrible.
</p>
<p>
2: Not really different. Maybe slightly more comfortable though without something hanging between your legs.
</p>
<p>
3: Nope.
</p>
<p>
4: No more Spiro, but I am on estradiol injections and had come off of that a year prior to GRS. I did drop injection frequency down to weekly instead of twice weekly just to allow my levels to taper a bit, but that is just because I feel better emotionally by doing so.
</p>
<p>
5: It feels nice. I have full sensation and it is very validating and empowering to know that I have her. There was some awkwardness at first but now I feel more at home in my skin than ever.
</p>
<p>
6: Orgasms are actually easier- far easier. While the clit might be too sensitive for direct simulation usually,  the neuro vascular bundle behind it (stimulated through the public area) is exceedingly effective and much more enjoyable than before.
</p>
<p>
7: No complications,  but dilating before does help make for a better experience.  I can self lubricate to an extent,  but lube does definitely help also.
</p>
<p>
8: Not really. Just be careful when dilating
</p>
<p>
9: Much more comfortable.
</p>
<p>
10: Most definitely!!!
</p>
<p>
11: Its not really harder to hold pee, but you do want to be situated before you open the floodgates because at first you have to get used to a shorter urethra- you will actually start peeing a half second or so before you expect to.
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps. Best wishes on your journey!!

Thank you! I forgot to post this as a question: what is the appearance? I have anxiety about it turning out meh astheticly. I know it&#39;s just paranoia as I&#39;ve already researched that part but I can&#39;t help it lol.

I&#39;m very happy with how mine turned out. My doctor is doing a labiaplasty later this month for free as it not uncommon to do the major plumbing work and then go back to fine tune how the vulva looks. Every doctor does things differently though of course.

Figure I’ll add my 2 cents
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Recovery is uncomfortable, but honestly it’s ok (for me electrolysis stands out more in my mind as a physically painful part of transition). That said, wearing pads constantly for &gt;2 years is starting to get a little old.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Maybe this is just me but while most of the time I’m not really conscious of it, sometimes I can feel that things are different down there (just like what I’m sitting on is a different shape.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lower body flexibility, not entirely? Being able to wear whatever I like is super nice and not having to tuck is amazing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I have stopped AA and just take my E now, one less drug!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
This is a weird one. I’m reaching the point now where I forget what it was ever like for things to be different. But somehow I can still feel and remember the trauma that was caused by my historical arrangement. I think the best I can say is that this just feels normal and I’ve felt that way since I woke up from the op
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yep, it’s a much more rewarding and intimate experience now, thanks to the changed anatomy and the resulting mental changes. It’s certainly more difficult now.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Just take it slow and relax. Be prepared with airlines (if you have to fly) knowing you will need a wheelchair. Listen to your body! If you are sore then take a break from whatever you are doing... other than dilation, that sucks, but it does force you to just stop each day (which has been good for me)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I actually wear it now and it’s amazing! Any time the stress comes up in my mind I remember that anyone looking at me and seeing a bulge is genuinely imagining things.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
For me the clit is 100% where its at, but I’ve not really explored this with someone else yet...
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I certainly make sure to go to the loo just before any period where I might be away from a toilet for any length of time now XD so I do find it a little more difficult...
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Hope this helps! Though there are plenty of great answers here already.
</p>
<p>
One more thing though; whatever happens know that you will get there! You are an incredibly strong person who has been through so much already and YOU CAN DO IT :)

<p>
How much does the recovery suck?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
YMMV. It can suck a lot, and it can suck a whole lot. The things you need to remember - it will take longer than you think, and it will be heavier than you think. And you need to be ready to really reduce your social life while you recover.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What does it feel like to walk, sit in various positions or anything else post op? Assuming it would be just a bit different.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It feels normal, except you dont have the dangly bits dangling, no fear of bulges or your tucking coming undone, it is quite liberating. And it is amazing how much natural it feels. Like I literally cant remember what things felt like before.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Does SRS increase lower body flexibility?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Did you have to change medication (HRT) Afterward since there are no more testicles to fight your hormone balance?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yeah, you drop the antiandrogens. Some women need to stay on them for a little while longer, while your body adjusts.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What does it feel like to touch it? Does it feel like it&#39;s always been there? If you were to run a finger from one side to the other, does it feel like your doing that or a tad bit different? Or does it take time to get used to the feeling of it being there?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It feels like its always been there. In the first couple of weeks your brain can be confused because things are relocated, but over time the brian remaps things.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Can you masterbate like you could pre-op? (Buildup and eventual orgasm) Did it take your body time to rewire your connection to your genitals sexually? Is it harder or easier to masterbate? Are orgasms different?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes and no. Obviously the geometry is different. It takes longer, and I am still figuring out the spots. The orgams are definitely different - more intense for me, but also more diffused, and less focused on one single spot.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Are there any complications with sex? (He&#39;s too big, or you can&#39;t stretch enough, or you aren&#39;t deep enough?)
</p>

<p>
Dont know. Havent tried yet. I do worry I might not be deep or wide enough, but from what I hear from others it shouldn&#39;t be a concern, but hey, brains sometimes kinda suck.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Are there any scary things you could do to accidentally hurt yourself after surgery?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oh yes. You can burst a bunch of stiches, have separation from too much activity, your clit can literally fall off if you try to masturbate too early. You need to take things slowly, patiently, and wait for things to heal. Embrace the temporary volcel :D
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How does it feel to where tight clothing post SRS compare to prior? Definitely fits better. Obviously no bulges, so no self-consciousness. If it is too tight its actually kinda really uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
Is your clitoris more sensitive than your labia/inside?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Kind of. Its kinda weird, cause I think I have a few spots where the neural connections didnt recover, or just the sensitivity works in a different way. So sensitivity to the touch is kind of the same, or a little more, but the response to the touch is different if that makes sense. The inside isnt really that sensitive past a certain depth. Still feels good.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is it harder to hold your pee? (I heard it&#39;s harder for vagina havers, could be a myth, never researched it.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think a little. I never paid attention to it.

</blockquote>
<p>
No it&#39;s way more psychologically dependent now. Don&#39;t get me wrong I didn&#39;t loose any sensation but something about it is just different. I can force it but it&#39;s always meh. I learned about multiple orgasms 4 years after surgery and I think it was the point when I really started to enjoy every bit of it. Penetration in particular took a long time before i really started to like it. Orgasms in general feel more distributed, more intense, longer and if you get like 3-4 in a row it has some pretty long lasting effects. I did 11 at some point and took the next day off because I couldn&#39;t move anymore.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It does stretch maybe an inch in depth and with the girth I start to have trouble around 5.25 inches. It adapts but more over time. Depth (6-7 inches) was never a problem. Girth on the other hand caused some pain until I got used to it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I scare others because I like it more on the rough side but nothing ever happened. I don&#39;t think so it&#39;s pretty resilient. Maybe don&#39;t do PIV without being wet enough. I guess that could cause some bleeding.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How does it feel to where tight clothing post SRS compare to prior?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Natural vs painful. I can only compare it to tucking because a bulge was unacceptable.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is. That being said I prefer indirect stimulation.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
Naa it isn&#39;t. But you will have to watch out for urinal tract infections cause the urethra is shorter which is the reason cis woman get it more often too.

1.) YMMV. It wasn&#39;t fun, but it honestly wasn&#39;t as bad as I had prepared myself for. It&#39;s more the first 6 months or year you have to put your life on hold for a bit.
</p>
<p>
2.) The same? Just less concern how you sit or look, you plop yourself down in a comfortable spot
</p>
<p>
3.) In the recovery house as we were all barely able to move a couple of us wondered if we could do the splits now.  Well yes you do gain a lot of flexibility but no I still can&#39;t do the splits cleanly :(
</p>
<p>
4.) Most people drop to only having to do Estrogen for the rest of their lives now. Some people do need to take some T cream if their T is too low now. Some people also start/continue progesterone as well.
</p>
<p>
5.)  The vulva feels natural like it&#39;s always been there and a bit sensitive. My brain says everything feels just the way it&#39;s always supposed to.
</p>
<p>
6.) Different experience and so much more powerful. Full body engulfing you.
</p>
<p>
7.) You&#39;re gonna want to keep a big bottle of lube handy.
</p>
<p>
8.) Don&#39;t force the dilators in no matter what. Keep the area clean.
</p>
<p>
9.) clothing fits proper now. I refused to wear preop anything that might accidentally even cause an illusion. Leggings are my friend. Shopping is fun now.
</p>
<p>
10.) Yes, its created using the underneath of the penile tissue
</p>
<p>
11.) It&#39;s easier now to pee but I swear my bladder is half the size as it used to be now!

Well yeah, I think she knows that 😂, but she is probably straight so all the penises going inside her will be a &#34;he&#34;.

Mmm, nope, I am not, trans men are MEN so in case they had srs it&#39;s still a &#34;he&#34; penis. If she is straight doesn&#39;t matter if they partner is cis or trans it is still gonna be a &#34;he&#34;(or a them, but ya know)
