Exactly what the title says, I got surgery from their team in Sept. Of 2019, I was sexually assaulted by a resident gynecologist during my stay and now suffer from vulvodynia and blood from my urethra when I defecate. Because meredith grey felt like she is unable to perform a revision to make my symptoms better she chose to drop me as a patient while I had one refill of my estradiol injection left.
</p>
<p>
She is now denying all requests for my hormones to be filled even though she did not offer another alternative for a doctor who will be able to help me with my prescriptions (as is required for it to not be malpractice to drop a patient who is in need of care)
</p>
<p>
My vagina has lost about an inch and a half of depth, I cannot go bigger than the second dilator in the surgery aftercare pack because of tightness and pain, and she doesnt care, she considered this &#34;a perfect surgery&#34; I dilate once a day for an hour and it&#39;s been a year and a half now. I feel like I&#39;ve been so cheated by that team.

I don’t understand why you’re getting hormones from a surgeon, or don’t try somewhere else?

Because they&#39;re the transgender clinic of Kansas city area, they pride themselves on being the only available clinic within 200 miles. I was going to a planned parenthood before surgery but that isn&#39;t a thing anymore.
</p>
<p>
They also told me before and after surgery that they would handle hormones because they have Medical Assisants and Nurses in their program who are not surgical care only.

That’s rather dangerous. No idea if it helps, but there’s a list of clinics here

Plume is a good resource for hormones. Check them out if you haven’t already. Sorry that happened to you.

No I have been very nervous about going to see any doctors since i tried to establish a PCP in my town (one over from Kansas City) and she told me she was just going to ask meredith grey for advice about how to treat me because I was her first post op patient.

Of course she will, I would imagine most PCP will. Why does that matter? She&#39;s making the effort to treat you, that sounds like a great Doc willing to learn.

Meredith grey dropped me as a patient because she is unwilling to offer a revision to me because she feels like she is not capable to fix my symptoms, so I dont think that a PcP going back to her is going to be beneficial.

Scheduled an appointment for me to come in and get a reasonable accomodation request for work from her nurse and when I got there she walked in the room and told me she was not able to offer a revision that would resolve my symptoms and that our patient doctor relationship was broken and thus she would not see me anymore.

I feel like you&#39;re giving us all the information excepts the points that matter.  What is so complex that she can&#39;t fix? Did she put the dismissal in writing? If so, what were the reasons she listed why the patient/physician relationsip was broken? You&#39;re correct about the continuity of care. She is required to provide a referral. Plus you usually have 30 days.
</p>
<p>
Now if you went back to your PCP, it&#39;s actually their job to find you a specialist who can address your problem. However you&#39;re sitution is complicated by having all your eggs in the one basket you got tossed out of. But fo the moment you seem to be worried about HRT. So that is something your PCP can prescribe based on you previous medical records. Just see her for that and get that out of the way so you can get that weight off your shoulders. She may have other resources in mind to help you. Give her a chance.

Whatever you do, don&#39;t fly off the handle and threaten to sue her. I cannot stress this enough. It triggers all kinds of consequences that will make things difficult for you.

She does not know why I am bleeding from my urethra thus she is unable to fix it. The bond was broken because... I&#39;m persistent that a revision would make it easier for me to dilate, would redirect my forward out of the bowl urine stream, and stop the bleeding? I will send you personally the exact quote that was given on my after-visit summary

It&#39;s all about risk assessment now. They&#39;ve already made that determination. Basically the wagons have circled. If your PCP can take care of your hormones tackle that first and then find another surgeon to fix it.

It might be an option to step outside trans specific care, a urologist or gynecologist may be able to assist you relatively close to home.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you&#39;re able to travel and finances/insurance allows it, there are a number of surgeons with good backgrounds who could probably help:
</p>
<p>
Dr. Wittenberg in San Francisco has a gynecology background and both Dr. Satterwhite  and Dr. Bowers have quite a lot of revision experience.
</p>
<p>
On the East coast, Dr. McGinn (lots of experience) and Dr. Bluebond-Langner (said to be quite good at revision work and works with a urologist) could be options.

That&#39;s awful to hear about your experience at KUMC. Thanks for sharing it, I hope you can find another doctor to help sort out the issues with the result.
</p>
<p>
Is your HRT regimen stable? Assuming you&#39;re not still adjusting your dose, any competent GP should be able to take over prescribing the same med at the same dose.

Downvoting this will only lead to more people thinking that her clinic is safe. I was told I was surgery #70 when in Pre-Op, in the recovery room I was told that I was the 34th person to go through their OR for bottom surgery. They should not be practicing on humans.
