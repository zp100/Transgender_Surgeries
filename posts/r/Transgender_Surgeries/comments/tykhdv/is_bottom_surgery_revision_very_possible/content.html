I think you&#39;d have good luck getting a consult with a good PPT surgeon. I might try someone who goes grafts over flap, sine they have more flexibility.
</p>
<p>
They can give more depth and maybe check if you have stricture causing tightness or pain in your canal.
</p>
<p>
They can also give you a good idea about can be done on the outside

Lots of options. Be warned, the wait time for name brand is significant. I&#39;d suggest studying results here to see whose styles you like before committing to a long consult. You&#39;ll probably have more luck with research hospital based surgeons- they have more access to robots.

I think if it comes to long term results like yours from Thailand, Dr Djedjovic in Belgrade has a reputation for fixing those - on the aesthetic and labia side of things i don&#39;t know how much they can do or what it will look like, but the canal can definitely be revised with Sigmoid or PPT

For widening
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/tlgf73/starfish_technique_for_neovaginal_opening_scar/">here
</a>
was a technique that could be discussed in case.
</p>
<p>
And a number of people said pelvic floor training was helpful.
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/u8tlqf/protip_for_difficult_vaginoplasty_recovery_see_a/">Here
</a>
may be more.
</p>
<p>
And concerning a revision it may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/">Here
</a>
may be more, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic">Djordjevic
</a>
may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://marcibowers.com/transfem/gav/post-op-care/">here
</a>
and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/surgeries/transfeminine/index#wiki_after_surgery">here
</a>
might be some additional resources. Talk it through with your med persons in case.
</p>
<p>
And looking for local med people who are experienced with trans people may also be recommendable. Asking at lgbt places or support groups for a referral may be a good idea.
