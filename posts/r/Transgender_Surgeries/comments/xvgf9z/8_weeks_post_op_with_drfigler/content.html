Congratulations!!! I had my surgery with him in February. I noticed a comment you made you ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt think it looked too great‚Äù give it time. I was swollen like crazy for almost 5 months and I had to have emergency hyper granulation tissue revision surgery but after antibiotics my swellings went down almost completely and she was gorgeous! So just give it time, she‚Äôs beautiful! We all heal differently üñ§

</p>
<p>

Thanks you so much for sharing!! My first consultation with him is in about a week. I&#39;ve heard lots of good things, but I believe this is the first time seeing any pictures. I&#39;m so glad you had such great results, and I&#39;m excited to work with him too!

Looks really really nice! I&#39;ve got my consult with him in May next year.

How was the experience with him/his team?

Good! They were very responsive and helpful, especially when I had a minor complication early on. I was actually worried it didn&#39;t look too great, but I&#39;m glad it does - I don&#39;t have a great metric for knowing if it looks good or not

Awesome. Thanks so much for sharing. I saw your earlier post just now. Sounds like a great experience considering it&#39;s a major surgery and all

My consult with Dr Figler is in June and I am just now looking around at results but from what I have seen so far that looks like gorgeous work and you seem to be healing well. I am even more excited now for mine :)

How was your experience with electrolysis and laser with him? I&#39;ve been going every other Saturday for an hour since June, my consult is in November and the lady on the phone told me the likely time I would be scheduled for is sometime around February. Do u think he&#39;ll be satisfied with my electrolysis
