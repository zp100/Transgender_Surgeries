Its hard to believe this question is being raised, but it is the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/q21ygf/is_dr_marci_bowers_transphobic/">question of the moment</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Three days ago, on 5 October, Abigail Shrier published an interview with Dr Marci Bowers on her website,
<a href="https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/top-trans-doctors-blow-the-whistle">Top Trans Doctors Blow the Whistle on ‘Sloppy’ Care</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Two says later Shrier published
<a href="https://abigailshrier.substack.com/p/why-marci-matters">Why Marci Matters: Dr. Marci Bowers’ and Dr. Erica Anderson’s Candor Could Help Thousands of Families</a>
</p>
<p>
Abigail Shrier is the anti-trans author the book “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters”

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The interview appeared immediately in the media and all over anti-trans hate groups – needless to say they love it.
</p>
<p>
Marci Bowers responded to the uproar on her Twitter account, acknowledging the interview, and notably not saying that it misrepresented her.
</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m not best person to analyze the implications of what’s happened here and since becoming a moderator I try to avoid commenting on surgeons. I’m mainly interested in the more medical aspects of transition, but this is a surgery sub, she’s a surgeon, and no one else has posted here about it here yet.
</p>
<p>
Even if the interview is a misrepresentation of her views, and it appears the time is past to say that, granting an interview to an anti-trans activist is incredibly damaging. No good can possibly come of it.
</p>
<p>
There’s a lot in the interview, but to pick a couple of bits out.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bowers told me she now finds early puberty blockade inadvisable. “I’m not a fan of blockade at Tanner Two anymore, I really am not,” she told me, using the clinical name of the moment when the first visible signs of puberty manifest.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bowers goes on to blame early puberty blockers for poor surgical results. Jazz Jennings (of the TV series) is a famous example as she has serious complications from surgery with Bowers (and Jess Ting). However, it should be noted that there are surgeons who have no difficulty working with these patients, producing excellent results.
</p>
<p>
Further, the 2020 paper
<a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/146/6/e20191411">Sexual Experiences of Young Transgender Persons During and After Gender-Affirmative Treatment</a>
published in Pediatrics, the
<a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/">Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics</a>
studied
<em>
&#34;Early gender-affirmative treatment (GAT) of adolescents may consist of puberty suppression, use of affirming hormones, and gender-affirmative surgeries&#34;
</em>
and concludes
<em>
&#34;Early GAT (including puberty suppression, affirmative hormones, and surgeries) may provide young transgender adults with the opportunity to increase their romantic and sexual experiences&#34;
</em>
. The paper is positive and makes no mention of the difficulties described by Bowers.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“As for this ROGD thing,” Bowers said, “I think there probably are people who are influenced. There is a little bit of ‘Yeah, that’s so cool. Yeah, I kind of want to do that too.’”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ROGD, or Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria is yet another damaging manufactured attack on the trans community. It&#39;s also been thoroughly discredited by experts in the field.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
If it were almost anyone else apart from Marci Bowers it wouldn’t be such a big deal. But like it or not Bowers has enormous influence. She&#39;s quite famous, appearing many times in the mainstream media, including the TV show
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Jazz">I am Jazz</a>
. She is also
<a href="https://www.wpath.org/about/EC-BOD">President Elect of WPATH</a>
, and will be the next president. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) sets the international standards
<em>
all of us have to follow to get HRT and surgery
</em>
, and it&#39;s the standards USA medical insurance uses. The President of WPATH is the most influential position in transgender medicine and has enormous power to influence our care and how we are seen in society. This has gone beyond medicine and into politics, and in politics the truth no longer matters. It&#39;s not only a danger to transgender youth, but to all of us. This is not the kind of leadership we need.
</p>

Edit: I&#39;ll post updates below
</em>
</p>

<p>
The other person interviewed alongside Marci Bowers is Dr Erica Anderson, a trans women and clinical psychologist. There&#39;s some background to her
<a href="https://www.transgendermap.com/medical/psychotherapy/usa/california/erica-anderson/">transgendermap</a>
, but this point on another recent interview probably sums it up
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Anderson was also a source for a 60 Minutes piece on “detransition” ...
</p>
<p>
... Her appearance has been cited in reporting critical of the transgender rights movement, including Fox News, The Daily Signal, The Federalist.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It should be noted that puberty blockers are reversible and puberty is resumed once stopped. They give time to make a choice rather than being forced to go though the damaging effects of puberty. There&#39;s nothing stopping someone who&#39;s started blockers early resuming puberty so they can get better surgical results - or they could go to a different surgeon&#39;s who is capable to getting good results; if they were advised of their options.  It is of questionable ethics for a surgeon to offer surgery they are not competent to perform when there&#39;s other surgeons who are.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc">WPATH Standards of Care</a>
, V7, page 18-19
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Fully Reversible Intervention
</p>
<p>
Adolescents may be eligible for puberty suppressing hormones as soon as pubertal changes have begun...
</p>
<p>
Two goals justify intervention with puberty suppressing hormones: (i) their use gives adolescents more  time  to  explore  their  gender  nonconformity  and  other  developmental  issues;  and  (ii)  their  use may facilitate transition by preventing the development of sex characteristics that are difficult or impossible to reverse if adolescents continue on to pursue sex reassignment. ... Puberty  suppression  may  continue  for  a  few  years,  at  which  time  a  decision  is  made  to  either  discontinue  all  hormone  therapy  or  transition  to  a  feminizing/masculinizing  hormone  regimen.  Pubertal suppression does not inevitably lead to social transition or to sex reassignment.***** I&#39;m not posting links to hate sites, and anti-trans news sites, there&#39;s far to many and its depressing reading. However a typical title would be &#34;Transgender doctors warn against sex changes for children&#34;.

<em>
&#34;A  recent Australian court decision sends a chilling message to parents who transgress the new gender orthodoxy: Refusing to validate a child’s “transgender” identity may be “emotional abuse” and put parents at risk of losing custody of their child.  ... The combination of gender ideology and financial gain has radicalized medicine, mental health, and social work — a fact that parents often discover too late. (Education has been radicalized too, as I’ve discussed here.) Although there is little evidence of benefit and growing evidence of irreversible damage, “establishment” medicine and mental-health groups remain powerful advocates of “gender-affirmative” medical interventions for “trans-identifying” adolescents. Gender docs engage in “happy talk” about the hormone therapy and “magnificent surgeries” they do on kids. There’s pressure to toe the “party line” on the benefits of “affirming” medical interventions, admits Dr. Marci Bowers, a leading transgender surgeon, leaving “no room for dissent.” However, Bowers and another gender specialist, Dr. Erica Anderson, admit that the gender-affirming model has resulted in “reckless” and “sloppy care,” including the “abject failure” of some gender therapists to properly evaluate the mental-health histories of troubled teens.&#34;

<em>
&#34;A new bill making its way through the Ohio House of Representatives would prohibit underage Ohioans from receiving transgender medications or undergoing procedures. HB 454, or the “Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE)” act, would ban puberty blockers, hormone treatments and gender-change surgery for Ohioans under 18 even with parental consent. Doctors who provide gender transition procedures to minors could have their licenses revoked.&#34;

<em>
&#34;Six months after I published Irreversible Damage in June of 2020, the High Court of Justice in England heard the testimony of doctors I had interviewed in my book and declared that a young woman, Keira Bell, had been subject to a hasty, reckless medical transition she began at age 16 with grossly inadequate medical oversight.&#34;

&#34;It also seems that even the lived experience of trans people is only considered valid if it fits the preferred narrative. As mentioned above, two prominent gender clinicians, Erica Anderson and Marci Bowers, have recently spoken out to express concerns about paediatric gender medicine. This included comments about the validity of the concept of social contagion, and their belief that adolescent onset gender dysphoria can be complicated by underlying mental health conditions.  These people are both trans women. Yet just days later  WPATH (World Professional Association of Transgender Health) released a statement condemning any discussion of these issue in the media. Coincidence? I think not.&#34;

&#34;First, and most egregious, is the entire adolescent chapter. This section legitimizes the debunked hypothesis of “social contagion” causing people to identify as trans (p4,) gives lip service to the entirely debunked junk science of “Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria,&#34; and advocates for extensive gatekeeping of any and all trans adolescents prior to beginning HRT (Statement 3 &amp; discussion) p11-12. This section also propagates a recently-coined euphemism for anti-trans conversion therapy: “gender exploratory therapy” (top of p15.) This term is used by numerous conversion therapists and by transphobic hate groups [1] [2] which refuse to affirm the identities of trans people &amp; oppose the ability of trans adolescents to access any kind of gender-affirming medical treatment (puberty blockers, HRT, and surgeries.) Statement 11 legitimizes unfounded “concerns” of transphobic parents regarding alleged social contagion &amp; perceived “very recent and/or sudden self-awareness of gender deiversity” (p20.) Statement 12B (p22-23) requires “several years” of well-documented “gender incongruence or gender diversity” prior to the initiation of HRT. Statement 12D (p24-26) advocates for further gatekeeping of autistic trans adolescents prior to initiation of HRT.&#34;

No, that&#39;s bad surgical technique combined with an unaware endo.  Per Dr. Powers a low T cream resolves that issue without systemic masculinization.  There are also techniques using the peritoneum.

iirc Bowers tried to get Jazz Jennings to use a topical T cream (which Jazz didn’t want to do) and per Bowers’ own website has also done vaginoplasty utilizing the tunica vaginalis system which is even less comprehensively documented than the peritoneum technique

There’s a difference between pointing to Reddit in court as evidence of standard of care, and taking ideas posted by physicians practicing on the fringes of evidenced based medicine and incorporating things into your own practice as you see fit.  When it comes to transgender care, much of it doesn’t have standards of care because being able to treat a transgender patient doesn’t seem to be standard among physicians yet.

I don’t think you understand what standards of care are. I think you’re referring to recommendations published by national and international organizations. I’m referring to the standard of care - ie what would a similarly trained physician do in a similar circumstance (what is frequently argued in the courtroom, hence my reference to court). Since I’d argue the vast majority of physicians in the country have little to no training or experience treating transgender patients, there essentially isn’t a standard of care. That’s what I was referring to.
</p>
<p>
Physicians regularly modify their practice habits based on things other than randomized clinical trials, because most of medicine either can’t or hasn’t yet been studied that way. Some read blogs and listen to podcasts, and take that knowledge into their next shift or patient encounter.

Lack of training isn&#39;t the same as standards not existing. There are standards, and while doctors have leeway they also have to be able to justify to their peers their thinking it something goes wrong. This is why a lot of doctors do consults, so that they have an idea of if they are going off the rails or not with their treatment ideas.

you are  absurd, wrong  and utterly clinically illiterate

<p>
clinicians routinely use social media to discuss  research and literature  -   and before social media  you used to  write letters  to  Journals,   discuss papers at grand rounds   and at  conferences

No, because they already know what is discussed on &#34;social media&#34; is a reference to actual research.

<p>
If you aren&#39;t aware of how to use Wikipedia and the like to find the relevant research ...

No, state boards govern them the same as any other doctor, and if there are no literal continuing ed hours for them -- there is still staying current enough to be competent.

There is also no research or perhaps little medical research on our community.  Everything we get new is a hand me down from elsewhere.  I wish when problems arise doctors would consult others and considering the current context those with more experience.

That&#39;s a good question. One of Dr. Bower&#39;s patients, Jazz, filmed her consultation with the Dr. Dr. Bowers proposes using a low T cream to develop Jazz&#39;s scrotum precisely because the puberty blockers that Jazz was taking resulted in her genitals having far less tissue to work with. Jazz was strictly against using T cream, so Dr. Bowers had to work around that. To do so, Jazz&#39;s neovagina was made with peritoneum.

Then A) not having much material to work with is a consequence of Jazz&#39;s decision most likely and B) Bowers had no known excuse for generically blaming puberty blockers for the poor initial outcome of Jazz&#39;s 1st surgery, no excuse for criticizing their use.

like the line ive heard most is &#34;if i knew this could happen i never would have had the surgery&#34;. Thats awful and means the patient truly didnt know what they were doing. its malpractice and im glad someone who cant be accused of transphobia is speaking up.
</p>
<p>
(lol or so i thought, clearly per the post title it doesnt matter who says it: diagnostic accuracy and due diligence is transphobic)

&#34;diagnostic accuracy and due diligence is&#34;   &lt;--  Not apparent in anything Dr. Bowers is reported to have said.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Thats awful and means the patient truly didnt know what they were doing. &#34;   &lt;--  Except of course as the satisfaction rate with these surgeries exceeds 98%, its simply not a thing that comes up much...

low T cream *CAN* resolve that issue, nothing promises to. We are still writing the instruction manual to the human body, and there are a lot of exceptions to the things we have learned. No, this does not work perfectly, and not for everyone.
</p>
<p>
Please dont take this as an attack on you, but this is a major problem with the mentality in many seeking surgery and other appearance altering treatments. NOTHING is promised aside from best efforts given the info we currently have. If youre one of the exceptions to what we know, you may get written about in a medical journal, but youre otherwise fucked.
</p>
<p>
I want a lot of things &#39;fixed&#39; but considering the rate of complications and the people i know who went from being &#39;insecure and depressed about a feature&#39; to being &#39;cripplingly depressed, suicidal, and regretful over their now permanently disfigured feature which is much worse than it initially was&#39;, i am rethinking things.
</p>
<p>
I am in med school, and it just isnt as straightforward as you say. Thats all Bowers meant. Its not fair to put a patient under that kind of risk if they dont 100% understand what could happen, and with the trans community especially, drs are hesitant to be 100% honest about the risks because it could come off unsupportive or critical. The pussyfooting is dangerous and recklessly endangering, and i really hate the fairytale illusion it has created.

There’s attempts around the world to ban all medical care for trans kids and Bowers has just handed them a huge stick to attack medical care with. They briefly succeeded in the uk this year before it was overturned. If she had legitimate concerns this is not the place to air them. It’s incredibly damaging.
</p>
<p>
And when she becomes president of WPATH just imagine how much worse it’s going to be.

where is the place to air them? physicians talk about this stuff privately to each other, nothing comes of it because positive change in this sense means challenging the greater narrative, and when you do that alone you just lose your own license and cant help anyone. So what do you think she should have done, how is the legitimate concern behind her message supposed to be addressed?

Yes and no, still working that out tbh, life is... confusing to say the least, really would prefer not to get into my personal/medical issues w strangers on the internet tho. Does that affect your answer to my question though? I may be in a weird position re: identity, but i do have empathy and critical thinking abilities. Ill hear whatever you have to say for what it is

&#34;No, this does not work perfectly, and not for everyone.&#34;   &lt;--  So what?   The implied idea only what is perfect should be undertaken is ridiculous.

If youre one of the exceptions to what we know, you may get written about in a medical journal, but youre otherwise fucked.&#34;   &lt;--  And?

</p>
<p>
&#34;I am in med school, and it just isnt as straightforward as you say. Thats all Bowers meant.&#34;    &lt;--   No, I believe that is not what she meant at all.  I believe she meant there was nothing she could possibly have done better for Jazz Jennings, and she lays all blame for any less than ideal outcome at the feet of the policy of using puberty blockers for transgender youth.
</p>
<p>
&#34; Its not fair to put a patient under that kind of risk if they dont 100% understand what could happen&#34;   &lt;--   I don&#34;t know exactly what was said to Mrs. Jennings by Dr. Bowers, I don&#34;t think you do either.  I am certain that if a T cream was used and it did not &#34;work&#34; that is close to being the only case of that I&#34;ve ever heard of, and if you know of more please do relate them.   I also am led to believe she was told a surface skin graft was her best bet, that that is all but certainly not the case.

Lmao I don&#39;t think we should be shocked that people who transitioned as adults are selling us out. I&#39;ve seen a lot of hurtful opinions/things said by adults who harbor jealously for not being able to transition young.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the idea that it was her (Bowers&#39;) fault that Jazz got a bad result is unpalatable to her, and it&#39;s a lot easier to simply blame the blockers. Any girl who starts at tanner two still has enough tissue to create the external structures combined with a PPT flap. The most criminal part of this is we&#39;ve known about PPT for decades, but no one bothered to apply it to us because no one gives a shit about us.

one question people  seem to skirt around with  Jennings is  was she the victim of infant genital mutilation - as this remains  all to common in AMAB  neonates in the US
</p>
<p>
certainly the UK  based surgeons   advise that the  anxiety around &#39; adequate donor material&#39; is much more of a US  issue , because so many of the  surgical candidates in the US  had third to a half of their  foreskin removed as a neonate

It wouldn’t matter anyways since we have PPT as a viable option. I mean ideally a foreskin provides more tissue, but with a peritoneal flap that issue really is irrelevant. It really just comes down to Bowers’ own laziness.

it does seem to be that a lot ofthe  problems Dr Bowers faces are down to  her own complacency , perhaps compounded by the difficulties that a  certain Psychologist and alsoa now retired  jack of all trades Dr  in the field in the UK   had  where  cis clinicians  feel less able to challenge their  pillockitude

The hate directed at trans women who transitioned in adulthood in this thread is really bizarre. Bowers is not every trans woman who transitioned after the age of 18, and pretending she is is gross and harmful.

There does seem to be a prominate pattern of post pubescent trans women that are against adolescent transitioning. It’s typical the same reasons and tbf a lot of it stems from body jealousy. Like if adult trans people had to suffer puberty so should every trans person.

I think it is less being against as it is being more cautious. I for one can understand and support trans youth getting access to appropriate care. However I also am seeing a narrative of trans kids thinking they will be &#34;ruined&#34; if they don&#39;t get blockers and hormones prior to 18.
</p>
<p>
That is the source of my discomfort on the topic. Not every kid is going to have the backing and resources to go on blockers and start hormones early. Then there is the fact that I see a disturbing trend of people treating transition as of it were clothing, and coaching kids how to get past therapists for getting on said treatments.
</p>
<p>
It isn&#39;t that older trans people want kids to suffer, it is because we know that putting everything on age is stupid and harmful in itself.

I’m 33 and probably starting hormones soon. From my perspective I’d just be concerned that kids make sure they’re making the proper choice; so many AFABs are looking to transition now, to the point that newer AFAB patients outnumber AMAB ones substantially. In so many of these cases girls are pursuing this course after sexual assault or other trauma, when understandably they’re searching for answers and for perceived safety. But if that decision is the wrong one then they’re in for a world of hurt a few years down the line. If a kid has been gender non-conforming since they were 4 or 5 and their choice is the culmination of a long road, that’s one thing. But if a 16-year-old with no prior history of this stuff just suddenly decides they’re trans after all then it’s worth asking questions.

No one is saying it’s not. Blanket policies tho is effect all minors and that’s the issue. Leave it to the professionals. They have psychiatrist and psychologist that specialize in this so let them do their job. I’m not willing to put real trans youth lives in jeopardy because of some confused 16 y/o cis girls.

I agree with that completely. All I’m saying is that those intermediary steps you’re describing should take place with young patients.

They are. Which is why we aren’t seeing afab detransitioners because in reality these girls aren’t even transitioning. Unfortunately, they are just extremely vocal. So vocal that they are silencing real trans peoples voices.

Seeing a subset of trans-identifying people want as much attention as humanly possible has been a really odd thing. For many of us it seems that the goal has long been to pass as seamlessly as we can.

Well the reality is they still have passing privilege. For us it’s about passing and blending in for ourselves but as well for safety. For them it’s a flip of the switch. They are only trans when it benefits them and only in some weird ideological gender deconstruction sense. Aside from that nothing about them screams anything less then edge lord attn seeking cis girl. They dont have to actually live in the same world we do. Though it’s also why I don’t really feel that I’m transgender. I’m Transexual because my trans-ness is far far deeper then gender. Esp. If gender isn’t real. I’m also extremely tired of “transgender” people telling me I don’t need to transition to fit societies expectations and that I need to just love the body I have. It’s literally a traphobic argument to make. I’m sure someone will read this and then I’ll be called a truscum transphobe and be banned. Though it’s what ever cause the only people saying that are literally the people appropriating my medical condition.

I&#39;m starting transitioning at 30. I&#39;m very envious of not being able to transition earlier. This is mostly due to where I live (Deep south, extreme homophobia), and my dad (Nazi-Catholic Hitler). Envious is the word though, not jealousy for me. I&#39;m so happy that younger people are getting the support they need because for me these past ~20 years or so has seemed like I was Atlas carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders along with everything else that&#39;s in that world. I wish I could&#39;ve had the courage to say something but I was afraid of my father, that it would cause a divorce because my mother is amazing (they did later divorce before I even came out), or that I&#39;d be left on the street or to stay at friend&#39;s houses (if i could).
</p>
<p>
To take that ability for young people to transition and not face a puberty they don&#39;t want is absolutely unethical and it makes me sad that there are that many actual trans people propagating this idea and is bitter misdirected jealousy. It makes me so happy that there are far less people that are experiencing the horrible youth and young adulthood that I did. The suicide attempt rate for transgender youth is 40-50% and roughly 20% succeed. The same rate of attempts and success is the same even after youth up to around age 30 (this is all the info regarding this i can recall at this moment).
</p>
<p>
Suffering the puberty I didn&#39;t want to. Not being able to say anything to my parents out of absolute fear of my father is something I would never want to put on another young transgender person. I had suicidal-ideation starting around 5th grade on-wards.
</p>
<p>
Like I said these people have misdirected their anger towards the type of puberty they experienced and resulting life because of it. Instead of getting mad at society and the way they treat us they focus on the younger people know and think of what could&#39;ve been and instead of what could be.
</p>
<p>
My father&#39;s side is extremely catholic and I remember multiple conversations where they assosciated gay/trans/etc people with pedophiles and the devil. This would also be coming out of the mouth of someone I loved as well (my grandmother) as she would be talking to my dad. This obviously made me extremely hesitant to even remotely think about saying anything.
</p>
<p>
I say that because there&#39;s no way in hell I&#39;d wish for young transgender people of today to experience what I&#39;ve had to. The fact that society is starting to come around has made me really happy and finally gave me enough courage to be me. To take one step forward like that then several steps back would be incredibly heartbreaking.
</p>
<p>
This would also lead to more people doing DIY hormone regiments that aren&#39;t monitored by a doctor if they try to ban helping transgender youth where otherwise if they didn&#39;t do that they could get help from a doctor and be monitored correctly (and hopefully optimally).

I would never be against childhood transition because I think I&#39;ve always felt like an outsider and always been uneasy about being close to people because of going through the wrong puberty. If the puberty development could have been corrected, even at the price of not being a sexual person, I would have been happier with that solution.

Internalized transphobia is definitely a thing. In addition she has &#34;made it&#34; and is now famous and influential. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. It&#39;s disgusting to hear her say these things and I&#39;ll definitely be crossing her off of my list of potential surgeons. She needs to be reality checked.

Yeah I&#39;m gonna throw my feather into this hat and add yes, she&#39;s transphobic because she transitioned as an adult, is jelly like another said, and is a shitlib who doesn&#39;t care about the poor. I called this bitch out for being a trans woman who charges for live necessity surgery years ago and got called insane for doing so. I told y&#39;all she&#39;s a sellout to our kind.

The sad thing is that PPV is actually a thing of the past.  It was first performed in 1974 but was only used for intersex women for a long time.  I feel like it should have been a standard of care for transgender women since at least the 90&#39;s when it is thought to have been &#34;perfected&#34; according to the literature.
</p>
<p>
A more pressing issue is coverage for FFS.   I think most women who have had both GRS and FFS would state that FFS had a more profound impact on their daily life, even if GRS had a more profound impact on their dysphoria.  It&#39;s simply criminal that this is considered elective for trans people by many organizations.
</p>
<p>
As far as WPATH goes, I think they mean well, but this is the cis-run clueless organization that used to want a year of &#34;lived experience&#34; prior to appropriate medical care.  I feel like the only way to reform it is to create a rule that only transpeople can be President and by reserving 60% of the seats on their board for trans physicians.

The PPV of today is not the same as 1974 or even what was done in the early 2000&#39;s. Nowadays it&#39;s done laparoscopically and is used to extend the amount of depth from a PIV vaginoplasty.

I mean.. I just paid €30.000 for FFS, and SRS is only €17.000 here... not to mention the €6000++ I&#39;ve paid for electrolysis on hair removal. I acknowledge that for some people SRS is a super important surgery but for most of us, it&#39;s everything else that causes the most dysphoria and undoing male puberty is incredibly taxing AND usually paid out of pocket.

I definitely want FFS cause of my face dysphoria, I decided to pursue bottom surgery because I work from home and my bottom dysphoria is sooooo bad right now.

Be carefull queen! It could get worse....I was out of work for 6 mo, and any &#34;fun&#34; I wanted to pursue when I was in the mood was off the table for 1.5 YEARS, on my worst days I regret it, on my best it is somthing freeing for ME but somthing I am self conscious about in front of others. I did it when I was 23 and I definetly would NOT reccomend it for anyone under 18

yes, i agree.
</p>
<p>
i&#39;m older and i&#39;m demiromantic/demisexual.  i want SRS but the actual results aren&#39;t so important as i may *never use it*
</p>
<p>
so maybe no one ever sees my vagina... no one ever knows if its deep enough that Bowers would be proud of her work.  But every day people see my face.  And despite that laser has done miracles, its still apparent that i have facial hair shadow.  people can notice the brow bone and other masculine features.
</p>
<p>
i&#39;ve trained my voice well, but i get tired pretty easy.  and i&#39;ve had phlegm problems two months, so it seems like my muscle memory is getting hazy... i can have setbacks.
</p>
<p>
i was lucky with low T and probably intersex condition (if i demand tests then they&#39;ll pause my timeline for surgery, so i&#39;m not talking to them about what i know, and they&#39;re too lazy to check despite obvious clues).  but still, i wish i hadn&#39;t gone through that mild male puberty.  i had a female puberty going on that i really didn&#39;t want interupted., ffs.  i wish i could have taken blockers.  and if that meant that Bowers did a 3 inch deep vag for me... should i really care?

The results of SRS are incredibly important even if no one sees it, dodgy surgeons can screw up your ability to pee properly for example.

well... for me depth may not be... how pretty the labia are and size... meh.  it does matter that its done competantly to reduce likelihood of complications... and yes... not everyone has penetrative sex, but everyone pees... so that&#39;s important. :)

Similar issues for me being intersex. Not so much that stuff would&#39;ve been paused for testing but I basically just got brushed off and told I was normal because I had XY chromosomes.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward until recently, it turns out I have PAIS. Which explains why I&#39;m 5&#39;2, 110lb, had a whole bunch of penile deformities (micropenis with hypospadias and penoscrotal transposition etc), totally half-assed facial hair, oh and probably it&#39;s why I identify as a straight woman as well.

I definitely think PPV would be better but as someone with IBS I don’t know if it would qualify or would be at higher rates of complications. I would like to get PPV if all possible.

I&#39;m sorry but... WHAT? Did she really claim she doesn&#39;t support puberty blockers for THAT?
</p>
<p>
Ask any cis woman (or trans for that matter) if they&#39;d go through a male puberty and take on all the effects, including permanent ones, that come with it, for the sake of a deeper vagina... Good luck finding someone who&#39;d make that trade fully understanding what it means.

Marci is notorious for neglecting patients post-op who call too often or whom she finds “difficult” (read: having anxieties wholly appropriate to the situation), and has also been regressive and judgmental about trans patients who are gay and/or t4t. She’s very old school in that way and I’m not at all surprised she feels this way, although announcing it in 2021 is awfully bold and very unfortunate.

Does it break my heart to say yes? Yes it does. But yes, I think she has become so. Or at least trans-harmful even if through inadvertence. If I were advising anyone on who to seek out not only for surgery but also support I would steer them elsewhere.

and for the benefit of all and any.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Clearly you don’t understand context.&#34;    &lt;--  The context is that puberty blockers have been in use for over 40 years worldwide, and for more the twenty for transgender youth.
</p>
<p>
&#34;We are not discussing puberty blockers in general. &#34;   &lt;--   I never said we were.
</p>
<p>
&#34;We are discussing puberty blockers specifically for  gender dysphoria in minors. So, no. They have not been widely used for transgender youth for two decades.&#34;  &lt;--   Nevertheless, they have that history of use.
</p>
<p>
&#34;They were not the “preferred” treatment for minors with gender dysphoria until recently. &#34;  &lt;--  That is a claim not in evidence, I have seen references to puberty blocker use for transgender youth for over 20 years.
</p>
<p>
&#34; Dr Bowers is a surgeon seeing first hand the aftermath of puberty blockers intransgender patients for GRS.&#34;   &lt;--   This is the &#34;aftermath&#34;:
<a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/3/e20153223">https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/3/e20153223</a>
</p>
<p>
&#34;I will not continue this discussion with you as you are out to fight, not to understand&#34;   &lt;-   I understand you want to have a point for free while being unable to defend it with facts.
</p>
<p>
Bowers botched Jazz Jennings without apparently being aware of how to approach the matter, and she&#39;s placing all transgender youth at risk of worse outcomes to cover for herself.

I had a pretty severe mental episode the week following grs. The short of which I was thankful for going through all the hoops. It was a reminder of how much I needed it, and a good net for those that are still working it out and maybe going to hard to fast.
</p>
<p>
Pacing seems rough, but when you&#39;re bloody, swollen, and in crippling pain you start to doubt whether you really needed it. Anyone rushing into this could find themselves at the end of a very painful realization.
</p>
<p>
(Some medical professionals DO use it as a gate keeping tool however. Don&#39;t want to ignore that fact.)

What is WPATH it if it&#39;s not specifically for gatekeeping? They set the criteria for medical transition care for most of the world, and everyone follows the WPATH standards. I&#39;d call them the mother of all gatekeepers. I&#39;m not suggesting it&#39;s not necessary in those respects, just clarifying.

sorry that you had a hard time.
</p>
<p>
the one part of gatekeeping that i unfortunately think is perhaps inevitable, is when they make darn sure that you have someone to take care of you post-op.  while some people post here about easier recoveries, it seems that for most (?) people, if they had no help or an ambivalent care-giver, things could have been really rough.
</p>
<p>
having someone at the hospital seems also sometimes to be almost essential.
</p>
<p>
that&#39;s kinda my weak point atm.  i pretty much have zero people who i know who would help me during recovery.  i didn&#39;t burn any bridges, but everyone else did for one reason or another.  can&#39;t imagine coming home on day 5 or 6 to this empty apartment...

Thank you♡  I was left to my thoughts and did some writing in my journal and some meditation. What looked scary and intimidating, turned into a blessing.   The Preecha Institute gave me great support by taking me to and from my appointments and to the grocery store as necessary. They were epic in every way and their help was always a phone call away. In retrospect I&#39;d have had it no other way

I&#39;m thankful I had my partner for my recovery. The thing is, I could not- 100%
<em>
not
</em>
have done it without her. Kudos to anyone that didn&#39;t have a challenging recovery, but I did. I am not even talking just physical help. She was essential to my mental health as well.
</p>
<p>
Having someone there seems like such a bother, but no one can predict your post op experience. It&#39;s an educated choice is all.

That’s odd for me to hear because it’s lead to me being able to receive official treatment I may not have ever been able to get in the past.

It works for some people, if they check all the right boxes and are fortunate enough to get accepting doctors and the right insurance (in the US).
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t have the above, you have to go other routes to get timely and appropriate care.

Okay. I&#39;m glad it all worked out for you.
</p>
<p>
If it wasn&#39;t a problem, there would be no need for Informed Consent by Planned Parenthood, or other means to get HRT outside of WPATH.

I am not sure how up-to-date you are but informed consent has been heavily encouraged by WPATH since 2012.
</p>
<p>
If a provider isn&#39;t offering informed consent, they are the ones outside of WPATH specs or are doing transgender HRT as a side hustle to their regular practice. I remember the swap over from 3 months of therapy minimum, plus identity persistence, the 200+ question test plus a therapist signing off you fit all the stereotypes.

Yeah, some (many) doctors say they do &#39;informed consent&#39;, but they put gates and roadblocks.  Real IC is what planned parenthood does: they ask you if you know what the effects of HRT are, and then they give you a prescription for HRT that very day.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s not what most doctors do, outside of Planned Parenthood.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s why trans folks are still desperate for HRT, and that&#39;s why PP as well as places like Folx and such do such a great business.

I get your annoyance, but WPATH is a political organization. Like any political body, they have their own goals and interests independent from ours.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not like detransitioners come from nowhere. It&#39;s not like the SRS regret rate is 0% (although it&#39;s low, somewhere around 2% iirc). If WPATH doesn&#39;t find a way to mitigate these occurrences, then there will be backlash against trans healthcare as a whole.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not a huge fan of them either, but they&#39;re literally the bulwark between trans people and anti-trans legislators.

You know how transphobes are. One (1) cis person getting a single minor transition procedure and regretting it/detransitioning is sufficient reason in their view to deny healthcare to the lot of us. One cis person having gender dysphoria is worth a hundred thousand trans people not having gender dysphoria to them.

Yes she is. I went to a conference where she gave speech and said that earliest examplea of trans people are eunuchs. It was southern comfort back in 2016.  My jaw dropped. Jazz&#39;s mum was there too as I guest speaker.

I’m pretty sure that Marci Bowers, a literal transgender woman who has literally helped thousands of trans women transition, is not transphobic. Like, at what point does that word just become completely meaningless?
</p>
<p>
It IS super concerning if someone spontaneously develops gender dysphoria at like 15 with no prior indication of gender non-conformity. You know how old I was when I first became aware of wanting to be female? Four or five. And adults around me noticed things even earlier than that.
</p>
<p>
My experience is very typical of trans people who grew up before the emergence of social media, which makes sense; being trans is neurological, and neurology is something you’re born with.
</p>
<p>
If not letting adolescents make life-altering choices without serious discernment and reflection is transphobic then I guess most people outside of online trans spaces must be transphobes.

But there is a LONG road between developing/recognizing gender dysphoria and getting hormones, surgery, etc. and many people involved.  People who suggest that GNC kids are quickly being shoved through instant transition are peddling disinformation and myths.  BTW my gender dysphoria didn’t consciously start manifesting until I was about 19-20 and I didn’t even think about transitioning until I was 39.  Not all Trans people have the same journey/path to transitioning and some don’t recognize it until later for various reasons.

I don&#39;t think doing an interview with Shrier was a great idea given the drum that she wants to beat, but what Bowers said about puberty blockers is pretty standard talk for a doctor wondering if treatment is appropriate. Her comments were with regards to her worrying that the outcomes for surgery are worse if the patient has used them. The ROGD stuff is a bit more troubling. Is there someone out there who&#39;s bandwagoning? Probably, but giving it traction is probably a more harm than good thing especially with someone like Shrier pushing it and can you say that this would be any different for any other diagnosis? There will be Munchhausen&#39;s out there who want to have something for the attention, that is not unique to GD and even the way she couched it, Shrier will blow it up to &#34;Prominent transgender surgeon says you&#39;re all faking it!&#34;. And based on the headline, it&#39;s obvious that Shrier has zero interest in &#34;getting the debate right&#34; as she claims.

And most doctors have no idea what they are talking about when it comes to blockers, neither does Bowers.   She&#39;s a surgeon, not an endo.

Yeah, I agree with this take. Also I think it&#39;s important to distinguish real medical concerns from the transphobes who spin those arguments to fit thier narrative. Based on the quotes OP posted I don&#39;t really see any issues with what Bowers said but do wish she did due diligence with whom she was talking to, if I have any issue with her is that she didn&#39;t check who was doing the interview.
</p>
<p>
That being said, transphobes are always going to find some out of context or fringe doctor to support thier views, so I am not sure how much blame for Bowers is warranted.

The problem is Bowers&#39; concerns about surgical results after blockers are unfounded because of the existence of PPV.
</p>
<p>
The reality is:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Bowers is not an endo
</li>
<li>
She f*cked up Jazz Jennings&#39; surgery and doesn&#39;t want admit it was her fault and that there is other technology out there that completely mitigates the difficulty Jazz had. Not to mention Jazz is still happier with her bad result as opposed to not ever going on blockers and being a boy.

I mean, we are welcome to belive that, but she is also welcome to belive what she believes based on her experience. It doesn&#39;t automatically make her comment transphobic even if its misguided or stright wrong. It seems like she might have a medical opinion, but its not necessarily because she does not want to give people the best care possible or thinks trans people are somehow lesser. At least that is how I read it.

&#34;I don&#39;t really see any issues with what Bowers said&#34;
</p>
<p>
I do!   She&#39;s apparently unaware difficulties reaching orgasm are (A) common to cis females with about at a 1 in 9 occurrence rate, they never claim to have  one at all, and (B)  unwaware it&#39;s no problem at all for FtM more than cis males which isn&#39;t often) and for MtF a low dose T gel produces no systemic masculinization and make orgasms easy if troubles are had (to the extent they are easy for cis females).
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s some obvious need for continuing education for Bowers in what she said.

&#34;No. She isn’t transphobic. She just has an opinion people don’t want to hear.&#34;   &lt;--  There are facts which directly contradict her opinion which all here should know of, apparently you don&#39;t want people here to hear them -- since you&#39;ve blocked my replies.
</p>
<p>
&#34;This quote in the article is indicative of how toxic the far left portion of the trans movement is becoming&#34;  &lt;--   Facts exist without being on the Left or Right, and I am certainly no one on the Left.
</p>
<p>
“But subjecting patients to a course of serious interventions that cannot be scrutinized — even by experts — without one risking being tarred as anti-trans seems unlikely to be in anyone’s best interest.”   &lt;--  Who has said they should not be scrutinized?  It is an apparent fact they have already been scrutinized, and Bowers didn&#39;t know it.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Medical professionals take an oath to do no harm.&#34;   &lt;--  And your false imputation is that Bowers is upholding her oath with her interview.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I think the longer “affirming” care goes on, the higher detransition &amp; poor surgical rates will become.&#34;   &lt;--   I know you have no basis for your opinion.  I know facts that contradict that opinion.

&#34;Transgender children showed no elevations in depression and slightly elevated anxiety relative to population averages. They did not differ from the control groups on depression symptoms and had only marginally higher anxiety symptoms.&#34;
</p>
<p>
The control group was cisgender. That is what affirmative care produces.
</p>
<p>
&#34;It appears some people haven’t even read the full article. The reason surgeons are starting to denounce puberty blockers is because gender affirming surgeries utilize most of the natal genitalia for the best results. The vagina was too shallow, so she had to use the stomach. That had poor results. Jazz never developed mature erotic sensation, and now she may never will.&#34;   &lt;--   None of which has relevance when the application of a low dose T cream apparently resolves that issue entirely in most cases without systemic virilization, and when for any reason there is not enough surface tissue for the procedure, the better approach than a skin graft is peritoneum.  It was Bowers&#39; unexplained choice to use a surface skin graft.
</p>
<p>
&#34;People having opinions you don’t like doesn’t mean they are evil.&#34;   &lt;-   What about people who want to stay deliberately ignorant of facts?  For example people who block replies they don&#39;t want to hear?
</p>
<p>
&#34;Dr Bowers clearly respects trans individuals. She is expressing her professional opinion after her experiences.&#34;   &lt;--   And she is revealing she needs a bit of continuing education in her experience, and in my opinion that she is willing to hurt transgender youth for the sake of covering for her mistakes.
</p>
<p>
&#34;We have got to stop taking everything so personally and stop vilifying people with different perspectives.&#34;   &lt;--   So a &#34;perspective&#34; not founded in reality must not be shown to be so?  Even when it has the potential to hurts millions desperately?

“If you can possibly stand a bit of puberty, the extra genital skin growth, likely orgasm and potential fertility may be attractive enough to consider the option. Early post-pubertal kids in their early teens still transition extremely well”….. Is she really saying for trans kids to undergo immense dysphoria because her antiquated methods and techniques can’t serve them while other surgeons do a great job with minimal tissue? LMFAOOO.

&#34;granting an interview to an anti-trans activist is incredibly damaging. No good can possibly come of it&#34;
</p>
<p>
I disagree with this entirely. We should talk to individuals with opposing viewpoints so we can try and learn from each other and come to a healthy &amp; peaceful understanding.  Just my opinion!

Exactly, same reasons why people hate Blaire, same reasons why I’ve been asked to remove myself from lgbt spaces. Because you either follow the entire narrative or begone. It’s sad. Belong to a community, but have a different mindset = ostracized by others. Only recourse is to smile and keep your mouth shut, or say what you want and don’t associate with them. Crazy girl

If someone is harming trans people they need to be removed so they don&#39;t harm more trans people. No idea what your deal is and I haven&#39;t looked into what&#39;s going on with Bowers but Blair is a straight up fascist and she&#39;d be a menace regardless of whether she was trans or not. Getting rid of someone like her is just a matter of keeping yourself safe. So yeah...

I read the article and it seemed like standard doctor talk about whether a particular protocol or set of procedures was medically effective. I didn&#39;t see a big bomb drop anywhere in the words. Of course much hay will be made by The Usual Suspects anyway to stigmatize and delegitimize

trans people no matter what they may feel about their own individual circumstances.

This honestly so troubling to hear. I feel for the trans youth who are under assault. Also if you’re a surgeon (who’s credible) and not knowledgeable on how to perform a surgery, why do it in the first place?
</p>
<p>
Did Marci &amp; Erica even quote any articles supporting their claims? Or is it just more anecdotal stories to fit anti trans narratives?
</p>
<p>
I also can’t help but wonder at the possibility of jealousy (that I’ve certainly encountered) from some older trans ppl who project their bitterness at not being able to transition earlier in life onto current trans youth.
</p>
<p>
Not only do we need to be focusing on maintaining the White House &amp; congress in America, we need to expand our numbers at state and local government. Science should be able to do the talking on this matter, not non specialist evangelicals.

Regardless of the merits of their views (none) its extremely irresponsible of them to talk to anti-trans activists and it will have lasting consequences on all of us. It&#39;s hard to imagine someone like that being the next president of WPATH and the disasters that could follow. I thought
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2021/05/01/caitlyn-jenner-turned-her-back-on-trans-kids-to-get-republican-votes/">Caitlyn Jenner was bad</a>
, but she&#39;s an amateur.

Caitlyn isn’t taken seriously by anyone. These two know their words would carry weight and be swept up by conservative media and actively used to harm our youth (and possibly the community as a whole). I hope the president’s of WPATH don’t have long tenures.

The fact that she gave A. Shrier the time of day suggests at a bare minimum subconscious transphobia.  Trans-accepting people don&#39;t give TERFs interviews to quotemine.  I think Dr. Bowers was probably traumatized by the J. Jennings spotlight on four revisions and needs therapy to deal with that.  I don&#39;t think she&#39;s fit to head WPATH given her comments in the interview.

she&#39;s definitely a quisling for the TERF crowd and therefore entirely untrustworthy, though her big fuss seemed initially to be based on personal reasons as the more trans teens getting colon or ppt vaginoplasty eats into her business bc she doesnt do those if i hear correctly

She should really step down from doing surgery. Her methods are becoming dated and just because she can’t performs srs on a trans woman who was on puberty blockers doesn’t mean other surgeons can’t. Tons of surgeons have successfully done srs on women with insufficient growth.
</p>
<p>
Also her recent reviews have been bad. So she apparently can’t do work on women with sufficient tissue either.

I’ve met Dr. Bowers.  She is not transphobic and I would trust a surgeon’s judgement on how difficult a surgery is or isn’t - especially one who has literally done hundreds if not thousands of this specific surgery.
</p>
<p>
Her concerns are legitimate - most of you aren’t aware that when she’s taking peritoneum or tunica vaginalis we are talking about MILLIMETERS of available tissue that is EXTREMELY delicate, even in a person who never had any puberty blockers.  If you want full-depth vaginoplasty and you want a depth comparable to a cis-vagina, tunica vaginalis and/or peritoneum WILL not add much, like may 1/2” to 3/4” of an inch y’all!  As well, every stitch is another weak point during the healing process - if she is stitching together three different tissues (scrotal, tunica vaginalis, and peritoneum) that means there is an increase in the number of potential complications during healing.
</p>
<p>
It’s important to remember too that those are tissues that can ONLY be used internally - you can’t use those tissues for things like outer or inner labia, they’re too fragile.  The biggest reason for a desire to increase available scrotal tissue is to ensure there is enough material for the vulva.
</p>
<p>
How do I know this?  My fiancée regularly works with Dr Bowers in the OR - she knows first hand just how difficult and delicate of a procedure this is, and just how much effort and hard work Marci puts into each and every patient.

Just because someone doesn’t agree with every single idea and ideology floating around the trans community doesn’t mean they are transphobic.

She refused to treat me. She said she doesn&#39;t do &#34;my kind of surgery&#34;...which was a mtf bottom surgery. But I&#39;m nonbinary. Mayne she doesn&#39;t believe we exist.

Marci bowers being anti trans would be so self destructive to both herself and her career.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not reading the article, but of the tweets I saw she seems to speak from a clinical sense. My memory is fuzzy, but she did work on Jazz, right? She would be
<em>
the
</em>
person to know best about the difficulties presented in that procedure. She basically reserves the PPT method for people with no elasticity/material- I would imagine in part because of how hard it is to work with material available with transgender people on puberty blockers.
</p>
<p>
The reason why you might talk to someone on the opposite side is the chance you open some eyes. The magazine author is going to write what they write. You just gotta hope that the few people looking for answers find something among the hate.
</p>
<p>
To summarise, no, she is likely no anti trans. She probably has some hard opinions based on her medical experience about the trans experience, but she also has first hand experience being as trans herself and issuing trans care.

It&#39;s obvious she&#39;s trying to cover her own ass though.
</p>
<p>
We have solutions for the surgical problems that come up as a result of blockers. PPT being one of them and testosterone cream being the other.
</p>
<p>
Bowers has been slipping lately on her surgical results because she&#39;s aging out and her methods are outdated.
</p>
<p>
She and Ting both have had issues and both botched her. Bowers knows that admitting this was her fault would hurt her ego.
</p>
<p>
Not to mention Bowers is not an endo anyways. Talking about this is out of her speciality, unless she&#39;s seen hundreds of trans kids I&#39;ve not heard of yet.

Colonic vaginoplasty creates an anastomosis of the colon and a new vaginal canal. If the colon connection breaks down you now have a patient in septic shock with an intra-abdominal catastrophe. This should never be a first line therapy. There are ways to raise flaps and techniques to give sufficient depth without doing this and without having someone delay GnRH blockade.

I agree with your sentiment here. She&#39;s an extremely skilled surgeon who&#39;s also trans. You just can&#39;t discount her depth of experience and leadership in providing both Trans-healthcare and training for other GRS surgeons over the two decades. I can&#39;t even imagine the array of patients and outcomes she&#39;s faced. It would be difficult to find someone to match her on that level.

Love that this was reposted to transgender_surgeries 😒 For those that didn&#39;t read the article, its a sensationalist piece that misconstrues almost every single quote given to the writer/interviewer. Here is my repost from yesterday. You probably won&#39;t read this either.
</p>
<p>
making any judgement based on this article isn&#39;t going to get you anywhere positive or practical.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bowers speaks from the objective standpoint of a Gynecologist and surgeon. She speaks mainly about worries concerning GRS in this article and the difficulties that shes witnessed. She centers her talk on puberty blockers when it comes to tissue availability, sexual function and intimacy
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bowers explains that it&#39;s not her recommendation to start blockers so early (at the very beginning of puberty) but never downright refuses it.
</p>
<p>
The article even shoots itself in the foot by directly quoting a doctor pointing out the only known negative being slightly lower than average bone density. Everything after that is pure writer conjecture.
</p>
<p>
As for ROGD, Dr. Bowers doesnt acknowledge it either as an actual diagnosis, instead pointing out that comorbid mental health disorders should be ruled out first which is the stance WPATH takes.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Marci Bowers is committed to women&#39;s health and has been performing GRS for years and as a trans woman herself, strives for the best for her patients.
</p>
<p>
Please keep away from sensationalism and learn to recognize when a heavily opinionated article is attempting to steer you towards biased thinking.

Do this google search for &#34;Dr Marci Bowers&#34; in the last week and see what she&#39;s stirred up.

</p>
<p>
And here in Australia its turned up in a major Australian anti-trans newspaper that&#39;s been waging a war against trans children over the last few years. Bowers has just given them all a ton of new ammunition.

The problem is her initial conjecture about not recommending blockers due to surgical results is due to her own ego preservation.
</p>
<p>
She famously botched Jazz and wants to blame it on anything else but her own techniques. She&#39;s been getting poor reviews recently and has been slipping because her techniques are starting to become outdated.
</p>
<p>
We have solutions to the tissue availability problem (PPT) and the arousal problem (topical testosterone cream). She, like many older physicians, is not innovative enough to try and advance her craft in this respect though.
</p>
<p>
She could have simply referred Jazz to another expert or pulled out the literature on PPT as its been done since the 70s. Just because she&#39;s an expert herself doesn&#39;t mean she doesn&#39;t have an obvious conflict of interest when speaking about this matter.
</p>
<p>
Not to mention she&#39;s making this conclusion as someone who&#39;s not an endo and hasn&#39;t done many procedures on trans youth...

This all is reductive at best. She did have PPT with Dr. Bowers and had a revision with Dr. Ting.

</p>
<p>
Both doctors speak of the difficulties encountered with her case in this article.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bowers speaks from experience as a surgeon and doesn&#39;t claim to speak from any other position. She speaks against blockers before the age of 11 (after the very initial stages of puberty.)

<p>
And that is not in fact the case.   The idea was supported by I think 1 study which compared youth still undergoing puberty, some of whom had been on blockers for the purpose of delaying puberty to those who had not.  The valid way to do it would be to compare those who had been on blockers for the purpose of delaying puberty to those who had not but only after puberty had thoroughly concluded for both groups.  That to my knowledge has not been done.

Not to mention reduced bone density is a justifiable tradeoff of the treatment if that&#39;s the case. Medicine is about triage, and everyone makes tradeoffs when undergoing any medical procedure or treatment.
</p>
<p>
Every medical treatment in existence has a downside, and its interesting that the downsides are only harped on when it comes to specifically trans healthcare, when ironically trans healthcare is one of the few medical fields that demonstrates high rates of positive outcomes.

There is  even any known reduced bone density in post pubertal people as differenced by their having been on puberty blockers for any particular time.  The research solely compared people at a much later stage of puberty to people at an earlier one.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Every medical treatment in existence has a downside&#34;   &lt;--   Many have very, very mild, even as yet statistically unnoticeable ones.  Puberty blockers appear to be in that rare latter category.

<p>
So very much a point I try to emphasize.
</p>
<p>
I doubt I&#39;ll ever see any reference to any work even purporting to prove there is any substantial failure rate of topical testosterone to drastically improve sexual response in undeveloped MtF transgender youth -- as this Redditor claimed was relevant

Even if it were true, with respect to Bowers complaints there is no evidence it was even tried in the case she talks about.

What a ridiculous question and bullshit hit piece.  Seems like your trolling trying to create more drama where there should be none.  I mean seriously, who’s next in this unending line of transphobic witch hunts?  So what, she talked to transphobic people and they are quoting her.  Transphobic people with agendas will turn everything anyone says into a negative story if they can and just because they can - we can’t speak, or have opinions?  Who are you helping with this?  Not trans people.  What purpose does this achieve?  Sure are making this get even more air time.  You are digging a pit for your neighbor and demanding purity to an ideology that not all trans people share. It’s crap like this, that demands every trans person should be ideological and political clones that fuel the dumpster fire our community has become in the eyes of the world.  For once can’t we stand together instead of look to score virtue signal points.  Nothing she said is transphobic.  Not even close.  Our time would be better spent engaged in building each other, and our community up, instead of tearing each other down.

I wouldn’t criticize her for this. I would criticize her on the lack of advancements. Even though I think her answer will be interesting. I would say saying this without the research behind it could be viewed as revolutionary for

I go to my surgeon for their competence as surgeons, not their political or social beliefs.

Look at WPATH v8 - shes doesn’t line up against it. I think she is misinformed and out of date and unfortunately is in a position of power. Her ideology undermines the decisions between people, especially young people, and their caregivers. It’s rubbish

Predictably, even guaranteed, to do so. Why would anyone help them?

<p>
There&#39;s ways to handle it if it&#39;s a legitimate concern, and this is not one of them.

That isn’t an issue with newer techniques like the peritoneal graft method. More surgeons are using it these days and the results are better than the old inversion/skin graft method.

I don&#39;t want to discuss it here, but be very careful choosing your surgeon and look for a track record of getting results. Don&#39;t just take their word for it. It is quite achievable.

I don’t think Bowers is transphobic.     She did show bad judgement by granting an interview to this Shrier.  There is no sense in giving people like Shrier the time of day or treating them like credible journalists.

I think the main issue we have here is that she&#39;s expressing her scientific opinion on blockers, not necessarily whether or not people are trans. She&#39;s decidedly pro-transition and pro-trans people, it&#39;s just a question of how she feels about the course of treatment and how it affects the viability of surgery down the road. It&#39;s a perfectly logical argument imo - and it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that her scientific opinion on how medical transition should proceed makes her transphobic. She just doesn&#39;t agree with present practices for managing transition.

FIFY

&#34;&#34;She just doesn&#39;t agree with present practices for managing transition.&#34;   &lt;--   She diagrees with current best practices producing this happy situation:

She&#39;s no endo or therapist and should not pretend she is.

There&#39;s a difference between having a scientific opinion and having a scientific argument. She&#39;s allowed to have the former, the latter requires rigor and your article supports it.
