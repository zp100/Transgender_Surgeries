So I‚Äôm 10 days post op, I‚Äôve been dilating for 4 days now, I got my catheter, foley and packing removed three days ago. And life has been a little easier.
</p>
<p>
Recovery so far has been ok I guess, lots of mixed feelings, I expected to have a lot of pain in the surgical area which so far has only been like 40% of my pain.
</p>
<p>
The rest being others like my collarbone area
</p>
<p>
(I was told it‚Äôs because of the gas pumped into the stomach to expand and make room for the surgery and somehow it makes it‚Äôs way up there)
</p>
<p>
I think that‚Äôs been the most intense pain so far, also the stomach issues have taken some of that percentage as well. Due to being inflated it feels as its shrinking down but it‚Äôs slowly and uncomfortably going back to normal. Sutures healing well, dilating hasn‚Äôt been hard or painful just lots of discharge and I‚Äôm able to do the purple dilator up the the thumb chin. Thinking of sizing up after my next app.
</p>
<p>
Everything has been extreme discomfort  everywhere lol nothing like I imagined.
</p>
<p>
Everything seemed to go fine until last night even though I haven‚Äôt had complications I broke down in the shower, i felt so much distress and disgust with the area while I was cleaning it I just couldn‚Äôt handle it, everything is healing well but the thought of actually and physically feeling my body in such state, seeing the dissolvable sutures sticking out, feeling the moist of my new parts, the sensation of healing was too overpowering it‚Äôs been a crazy ride. I feel like I‚Äôm really strong in some areas like pain tolerance but so weak in others. I have to mention thought I also have an amazing support system so they‚Äôre getting me through everything
</p>
<p>
That kinda opened a door and I‚Äôve been so sensitive after, the mental toll kinda accumulated along with the physical toll. It‚Äôs kinda getting to me. Also I caught a really bad cold I guess the change in temps from scorching hot SoCal to chill and humid SF weather did the trick. I‚Äôm other notes I‚Äôm happy with the results. I honestly think Dr Jun did an amazing job and his whole team deserve the credit as well.

You are in the worst of it now. I was in your exact position three months ago. Surgery is a huge deal and you are full of so many medications that have depressive qualities. Also, your brain is needing to catch up with things, and that takes time.
</p>
<p>
Please rely on your support system and ride it out as best as you can. Thing will improve every day.
</p>
<p>
Jun does such a thoughtful and methodical job. At three months you can hardly tell I had surgery. Probably hard to imagine now looking at your site, but you&#39;ll get there and the time will go fast!

You went to the finest surgeon right now performing srs/gcs pfv. Its hard the first two weeks. Like really hard.
</p>
<p>
It gets easierva month in. 1 and a half months youre almost back to normal. After 3 months the only thing is dialation. One day it just looks less angry overnight.
</p>
<p>
After this because his technique is more aggressive (enters your abdomen) and gives you natal results‚Ä¶no one can tell you sh1t. You have conquered through.
</p>
<p>
Year out already and I only wish Dr. Jun was practicing earlier. So I could have gotten his technique then. I love my body now. No more dysphoria in any shape way or form. True freedom

Thank you for your words, I regret nothing I truly am happy with everything in the process it‚Äôs just a lot to process lol I hope one day I no longer have dysphoria either. And literally can‚Äôt wait til all I have to worry about is dilating or better yet when I don‚Äôt have to worry about that either lol

Definitely a Crazy ride and I really can‚Äôt wait for the easier parts of it. I can‚Äôt stress enough how thankful I am for it though and that recovering with all its craziness hasn‚Äôt been terrible.  I‚Äôm sorry to hear yours hasn‚Äôt been as easy and sincerely hope it gets better. And I just sent a message on the post op channel lol feel free to say hi on there :)

That‚Äôs wonderful. May you fully heal and rest well. Good to know you‚Äôre in good care after surgery.
</p>
<p>
It can be a lot a first - emotions all over the place, just a reminder you‚Äôre not on hormones so this is possibly why. They take you off them so you don‚Äôt get blood clots during and after surgery. You should be able to go back on hormones in a few days or so. Ask at your next appointment. üòâüòç welcome to the new you Beautiful dear!!
