Thanks! Forehead reconstruction, brow lift, scalp advancement, rhinoplasty, genioplasty, jaw contouring and tracheal shave. It seems like a lot, but both Braly and Virtual FFS recommended the same procedures (except the tracheal shave), so I felt confidant about it.

Haha yeah mostly! Only big things he didn‚Äôt do were lip lift and check work of any kind. And yeah,  watching things take shape as the swelling dies down has been amazing!
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs hard to give details about my procedures. I mostly just trusted his own eye when deciding what to do, so I don‚Äôt really know what exactly he did. There are few things of note though! My hairline was WAY too far back (I had super early onset male-baldness), so he just moved it forward as much as he could. The M shape is still there, which sounds bad, but it actually just looks pretty androgynous now (that said, I see a hair transplant in my future). He removed my sinuses to do my forehead, not that it feels any different. The only special request I made was a flat chin (as opposed to pushing back and reshaping my forward chin), which he delivered on.
</p>
<p>
They offered me a consult 4 months out, then a tentative surgery date 2 months after that, with a decent selection of dates offered around that time. They did have to reschedule my surgery (I took an earlier date), so be aware that this can in fact happen!
</p>
<p>
Yes! It was all done as a single, six hour surgery. I felt like I‚Äôd just come out of the worst drug trip when it was done, but it was fucking worth it.
</p>
<p>
The consultation was 300 dollars (aka, the tip of the iceberg. They asked I not disclose the actual surgery price (I think something about not wanting people to expect a certain pricing). I will say though, given what I had done, I think it was about a 20-40% increase from most surgeons would charge, so be ready for that!

Thanks for posting, big improvement to the appearance of your eyes even with swelling. How did you feel the day after?
</p>
<p>
Im having surgery in about 6 weeks with Dr D and will need to check into my hotel once released from the hospital. I&#39;m having lip lift rather than chin and jaw but the rests the same.

Unfortunately I&#39;m going solo, a friend let me down at the last minute. Literally the day I was booking flights! Already pretty worried about not having anyone to help but can&#39;t do much about it.

Haha thanks. Apparently I had unusually low swelling, so that‚Äôd be why, although below my chin is still kinda a mess tbh.

No shortage of numbness! My chin feels like a blob of gelatin and some parts of my forehead are like rocks.
</p>
<p>
And not really once I was out of the hospital. While in the hospital though I did have some serious vertigo and a panic attack, which I was given some drug (a sedative I think) for. They also had to stick the cath back in when I couldn‚Äôt pee in time. And I mean yeah sure, medical emergency and all that, but please never again thx.

I hadn&#39;t thought about being catheterized. I guess it should be obvious for a long surgery. That sucks.
</p>
<p>
Btw, in the pics you posted, I&#39;m just amazed by how much more open and brighter your eyes look! I&#39;m hoping for similar results.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for posting!

I almost had a panic attack the first time I saw my bloated balloon-jaw (bandages were taken off it after about a week). It got significantly better over the next few days though and now it‚Äôs maybe not
<em>
attractive
</em>
yet, but it looks fine enough not to be self-conscious.
