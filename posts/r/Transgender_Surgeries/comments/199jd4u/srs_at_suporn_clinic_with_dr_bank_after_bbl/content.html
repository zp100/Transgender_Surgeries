Hey everyone. I’ve been working on scheduling a date with Dr. Bank and just submitted my client profile. Everything was accepted, but the clinic did attach this warning with my reply:
</p>
<p>
“Please note that after BBL surgery, your fat structure in your pelvic area may significantly change, which makes it increasingly difficult to create ‘deep’ vaginal canal. Your depth is likely to be less than 5 inches. From our experience with clients with prior BBL, creating vagina canal is difficult, skin-graft does not attach well to the vaginal wall and there is a high chance of skin necrosis after the surgery. You may also experience very difficult dilation. If you wish to proceed, please acknowledge this risk and potential consequences in advance.”
</p>
<p>
Has anyone had SRS with Dr Bank after a BBL? Did you have negative side effects from that? Does anyone have more information about this, like what exactly causes the issue?
</p>
<p>
My “bbl” wasn’t typical, it was lipo of my trunk area and fat injection to the sides of my butt along with butt implants. There was no fat removed from my mons pubis which I saw mentioned in a comment that could cause an issue.

I am waiting to hear on this topic too! I am about to be booked for with Suporn. My lipo was so minimal. Does that mean the depth will definitely be less than 5 for sure? Should I just go somewhere else?

Thank you! I did see that comment thread when I searched the wiki. I guess I was hoping for someone with direct experience. I’ll update this thread if/when I hear back from Dr. Bank :)
