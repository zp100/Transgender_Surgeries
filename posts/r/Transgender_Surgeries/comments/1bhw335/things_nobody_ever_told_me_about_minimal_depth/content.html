I am not aiming for minimal depth but I feel like most of what you&#39;ve written here also applies to other srs techniques. So thank you for sharing your experience. I&#39;m still scared shitless but this helped a bit

^^ This, for sure

I had full depth, and almost all of these are just as applicable.

Yeah, most of these sound familiar. Especially the pad thing - I was literally using a 20 pack daily the first few weeks, it felt pretty absurd. Every time I had to dilate or use the bathroom - change the pad. No way I&#39;m putting a messy, sticky pad back on lol.

Many congrats. I&#39;ve had my zero-depth for a year and can recommend.
</p>
<p>
Other things they might not tell you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For follow up appointments your surgeon/doctor will likely ask how dilations are going and you&#39;ll need to remind them that no dilations are needed for zero depth. My regular doc asked at 4 months and was shocked when I said I didn&#39;t do them.
</li>
<li>
Bits of &#34;stuff&#34; will fall out while in the bath during the first few months.
</li>
<li>
Some people in the community will treat you badly for having zero-depth. I was told that zero-depth meant that I was not a &#34;real trans girl&#34;.
</li>
<li>
When aroused, there is a little more depth that appears. Don&#39;t know where it comes from (or where it goes after).
</li>
</ul>

Those people are sad. It isn&#39;t a competition, and frankly none of their business how anyone else decides to express themselves in a way that feels authentic to them.

Absolutely.  The hypocrisy of fighting against society trying to define women by genitalia and then being prejudiced against someone for their genitalia is eye-watering. Our body, our identity, our choice.

I guess the first question would be the usual one. What made you opt for minimal depth over traditional methods?

I&#39;m 42, married to a cisgender pansexual woman for over 16 years with kids. Prior to surgery, I could orgasm four, five times in a row in succession with increasing intensity from clitoral vibrations alone, sometimes coupled with a little anal play. I&#39;m pansexual, but just barely, and for all intents and purposes I&#39;m a lesbian. Opting for minimal depth not only sped up the already very slow process (they got me in quicker) but I had no need for a new orifice that was 6 inches deep or more. I disliked the idea of having a new cavity so deep I couldn&#39;t see if it was clean or not and the less I have to smell the better. The idea of a neovaginal prolapse horrifies tf outta me not to mention the possibility of a perforation between the neovagina and colon (which are admittedly low risks). The risk of complication is lower. I just wanted something large enough to maybe put a tongue or a vibey bullet in. And, at the end of the day, I&#39;m still better off than I was without a penis.

First, congrats on your surgery, and yes, that constant anxiety in the first few weeks post surgery....
</p>
<p>
The main thing I discovered is that, aside from it not being essential to dilate/douche (although I chose to) and slightly lower complication risk, partial depth vaginoplasty is pretty much the same as full depth in terms of recovery and post operative care. This is not to be confused with zero depth vulvoplasty.

The other thing I would add is that the pain level is very much a case of YMMV. I had a LOT of pain - they gave me everything they had in Recovery, and I sucked my self-administered morphine pump dry in about 20 hours :;-) I&#39;m 2 and a bit months post surgery and still get woken by pain and discomfort at least once a night. A friend of mine 10 years my senior had full-depth, and was completely pain free by 5 weeks.

I am considering it as I only like women and I don&#39;t want the increased risk of complications and need to dilate with full depth. Did you feel your played a part in choosing to do zero depth?

Absolutely, though I did minimal dept and; depending on the surgeon there is a bit of a difference. Zero depth could mean absolutely none not even a 1.5 inch enclosure. But your reasons are spot on.

Your English is great! I still have my prostate but due to hormones I am very very unlikely to ever have issues with it. It is at the base of the minimal depth canal if I am guessing right and is great for a bit of pleasure. But the hormones keep that thing under wraps, and the lack of Testosterone from the surgery is a big part of that.

First of all; congrats on getting surgery! ☀️🍀😎❤️
</p>
<p>
I got full depth bottom surgery 6+ months ago and had my revision last month. I can’t overstate how much I relate to part 13!! It’s crazy how many mental breakdowns I’ve had, thinking to myself I might have an infection, or something terrible might be going on down there lol. The doctors gave me a basic summary of what to expect in terms of recovery, but it doesn’t prepare you for how easy it is to panic haha 😂.  -much love from Germany 😊

Only questions I have is will you post progression pics of your new vagina? I&#39;m pretty much decided on minimal depth. Most important is cosmetics/function of the clit for me. Like the other side, just enough &#34;hole&#34; to stick a tongue in or a small vibrator. I actually rather enjoy anal, no need for a second hole and complications that would bring (longer recovery, lots of dilation, life long dilation, much easier to keep clean).

Once I&#39;m fully healed (or about a year in) I plan on posting pics of how it turned out and compare it to the absolute mess it was in the very beginning. Just so people who are scared while healing can see that I probably had it worse. But I can PM you a nice angle if you want to get a general idea.

Congratulations.  I thought zero depth was like no depth at all.  When I get myself sorted I don’t want any depth, with a little labia I guess. Even then I could do without labia &amp; to be stitch closed all the way

<p>
You are correct - zero depth means just that - and the procedure is a vulvoplasty, not a vaginoplasty as all the external elements of a vulva are created, but no vaginal canal is constructed.
</p>
<p>
This is different to partial/minimal/shallow depth which is a vaginoplasty, as a vaginal canal of a few inches IS created, and this is the procedure to which OP is referring. The only real difference between partial/minimal/shallow-depth and full-depth is the shorter canal means there is no skin graft, the risk of bowel/rectal damage and recto-vaginal fistulae is lower, and no dilation regimen is required post-operatively.
</p>
<p>
Although quite different procedures, the two are often conflated and confused, which is unfortunate as this generates a lot of confusion and misinformation.

I had minimal depth about 8 months ago and although I’m pleased with my results aside from a few aesthetic things I’ll have to have a revision for, I wish I would have gone full depth. I feel like I was sold on minimal depth because I’m in a lesbian relationship and the thought of not having to dilate seemed appealing. Now looking back I had plenty of time to dilate during recovery which I was very nervous about. I work from home so I could even dilate in between work. I have absolutely no depth at all, I wish I had 1.5 inches like you shared. Although I love having my new parts I don’t feel “complete”. I feel like not having a vaginal canal has caused me more dysphoria in a sense. I talk to my cisgender friends about sex and it hurts to know I can’t experience penetrative intercourse. Also, I feel like after having bottom surgery I am more open to the idea of penetrative intercourse which makes it worse. I’m hoping to go for a revision later this year or early next for hopefully more depth and to fix a fusion of my labia.

I am not interested in zero depth. I am however interested in learning.  Thank you for your very well written up experiences and observations. I hope one day my insurance will cover my gender affirming surgeries. Congratz on getting yours. &lt;3

Not being critical or nit-picking - just to clarify, the OP is referring to partial depth, not zero depth - they are two different procedures (see my comment above).

Thank you for sharing. It&#39;s very helpful. I would like to know if you know if this surgery was cheaper than full depth at the same place or if the prices were roughly the same?

I had a minimal depth vaginoplasty done in February 2023, so I&#39;m 13 months post-op at this point.
</p>
<p>
I went in asking for a zero depth but was advised by my surgeon to go for a minimal depth for aesthetics. So I did. I describe it as &#34;all of the looks with none of the work&#34; 😀
</p>
<p>
In my case I&#39;m a (now) 65-year-old who identifies as lesbian. The only use I&#39;d make of my neovagina if I had a full-depth one would be the occasional dildo / vibrator and time on a One Bar Prison (it&#39;s a bondage thing if you don&#39;t know) and the neovagina would never be &#34;tough enough&#34; for that and a full-depth would make anal OBP usage dangerous with a risk of tearing into the neovagina.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d add that you should consider disposable waterproof bed pads (you probably were on them in the hospital). Ask for some to take home and then order inexpensive ones from somewhere like Amazon.
</p>
<p>
It makes the mess easier to clean up after dilation. Just fold up the pad and discard it.
</p>
<p>
Opioids - don&#39;t get me started. Governor Fatso got a bee in his bonnet and ruined it for everyone. I was on Vicodin for 10+ years for a spinal problem before finally getting spinal surgery. I keep a long-expired prescription that I never filled for 540 Vicodin (3/day for 30 days with 5 refills) and show it if I get the &#34;you&#39;re exhibiting drug-seeking behavior&#34; line from a doctor. I go &#34;if I was drug-seeking, don&#39;t you think I would have filled this?&#34; Results vary. But mostly their eyes bug out.😁
</p>
<p>
This means I have an incredible tolerance to opioids. I went to an emergency department 5 years ago for a broken forearm (both radius and ulna, with bones sticking out). I told them about my opioid tolerance but they didn&#39;t believe me at first. After 4 IV morphine and 8 IV Dilaudid I was still alert and coherently carrying on conversations. For the people who don&#39;t know, those doses would leave a horse on the floor in severe distress and at risk of sudden death without immediate intervention.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back to my surgery...
</p>
<p>
It took 14 months from making the initial appointment to walking out with a brand new hoo-ha. Since my surgeon was in NYC and I&#39;m just across the river, I got a surgical slot when an out-of-state patient canceled or postponed their surgery.
</p>
<p>
You have to keep calling them (at least in my case) because when they say &#34;we&#39;ll get back to you in 2-3 weeks&#34; after you have an appointment with them, they don&#39;t. I finally got my consult with my surgeon in October 2022. That was after they said &#34;she has an opening for consultation in spring 2023&#34;. I responded &#34;No, no, no - you&#39;ve had me on this treadmill since December 2021, not waiting&#34;. So they gave me the first consultation in early October 2022 and had a surgical date set for May 2023. I got a call from &#34;Unknown caller&#34; the weekend after Thanksgiving while I was recovering from Thanksgiving COVID. To this day, I don&#39;t know why I answered it - normally I let them go to voicemail. It was my surgeon&#39;s scheduling coordinator asking if a date in early February was of interest. I said something like &#34;Hell yeah&#34; and got the earlier date. If I didn&#39;t answer that call, she would have called the next patient on the list.
</p>
<p>
I had a consult with my surgeon&#39;s psychiatrist early on. I gave them the abbreviated story of my life since telling my parents I was a girl (at age 5 in 1964 - the Dark Ages) and he said &#34;yup, you&#39;re good to go&#34;. Insurance wanted letters from 2 psychiatrists, my primary care provider and my HRT prescriber. In my case, the last 2 were the same doctor. I used GALAP for my psych letters - they&#39;re a loosely-affiliated group of psychiatrists who believe in eliminating artificial gatekeeping barriers for trans people). They both had teleheath sessions with me (one multiple times, to follow up and see how I was doing).
</p>
<p>
I had wonderful insurance (at 65, I&#39;m now on mandatory Medicare insurance). The whole surgery ended up being a co-pay of US $200. The actual bill was something like $250,000 which insurance negotiated down to around $127,000. But all I had to pay was the $200 in-patient hospital stay co-pay.
</p>
<p>
I was in the hospital for 4 days total, with surgery starting at 7:30 AM on the first day. Then I was sent home with a wound-vac. Insurance covered visiting nurse service, initially every day and then down to once a week over time as my needs decreased. My first follow-up with my surgeon was a week after I got home from the hospital and the wound-vac was removed and I got to see my noo hoo-ha for the first time. She looked like she was on the losing end of a really bad bar brawl.
</p>
<p>
Over time the appearance got better and better. The areas I had lasered grew back a little, so I have a triangle-shaped bush over a mostly hairless vagina, which is perfect. I haven&#39;t felt the need/urge to shave down there, not even once.
</p>
<p>
I got something that was probably a yeast infection (white/yellow/grayish waxy substance, not water soluble) which resolved before my next scheduled appointment with either the visiting nurse or my surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I&#39;m rambling and it&#39;s 1:30 AM here. If anyone has any questions, ask here or DM me. I tell people I&#39;m a 24/7 AMA. Just be respectful if you want a reply. I probably don&#39;t need to say that in this sub, but I&#39;ve gotten things like unsolicited dick pics when posting this in other subs.

First of all congrats on your surgery!! I got my mine about three months ago and I do have one question—when did your “goopy phase” end? I am still in mine at 12 weeks and I am pretty tired of it lmao.

Great Q. Imma add it to the list if you don&#39;t mind. So I did five rounds of bikini laser with my favorite aesthetician then on my surgical consult the surgeon says &#34;oh you didn&#39;t have to do that.&#34; Which is great because hair is growing back in those areas. Which is also great because they are hiding the scars and making me look more natural. But I&#39;ve had no issues with hair on the inside.

You mean isn&#39;t, right?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, thanks a lot for the write-up! I&#39;m getting minimal depth surgery hopefully this summer, reading posts like this is a big help for getting prepared.

Nope I have hair in my pubic region and it looks like a normal cis vulva with a bit of hair. No hair inside the vulva or vaginal space. I am so glad it helped!

Opioids are a huge issue with a lot of people. You say you haven’t had a problem with them but, okay, it’s still a good thing that the industry is cautious with them. People died when they weren’t. Plus you said you didn’t have much pain so it’s really a non-issue. You didn’t need them.

This is an overreaction to corruption in medicine with over prescribing.

I&#39;m sorry about whatever pain opioids have caused you and your loved ones. However, it&#39;s a very good thing I didn&#39;t require them because had I a need for them I probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to get them. To this day they are still sitting at the pharmacy waiting for me... 6 hours round-trip a car drive away that I physically could not manage right now. Had I the inkling to abuse them for fun or sell them or whatever illicit purpose; I would just go despite the damage to myself, or pay to have someone drive me or find another means. They prevented nothing and gatekept and hurdled access to them by someone who very reasonably could have sorely needed them. That said, I understand your concern. Different worlds.
