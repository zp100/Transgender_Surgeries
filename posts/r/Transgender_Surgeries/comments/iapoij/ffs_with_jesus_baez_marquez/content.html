I  just want to share my disappointing surgery results with Dr jesus Baez marquez .
</p>
<p>
He did forehead reconstruction type 3 and rinioplasty and lip lift for me and the results is as disaterious as you can see in photos .
</p>
<p>
I sent the ct scan of my head to many well know surgeon to see if they can do any revision . I talked with Facial team , Dr Bart and MDM and nobody can fix the damage .
</p>
<p>
As you can see he set back the frontal sinus bone as much as possible ( Please look at the disattachment of the bones in the ct scan and the angle of the bone) without being able to align it with brow bone .
</p>
<p>
The result is a very ugly hole in the middle  and very prominent brow bones .
</p>
<p>
I was almost passing before FFS with him . I look more masculine since I did surgery with him and there is no chance that I pass again . He destroyed my life
</p>

You posted a year ago that you had surgery with Suporn with basically the same issues, and now its all about Dr Jesus Baez Marquez? I notice your posts on Facebook too and talking about the surgery mafia. It&#39;s all a bit questionable.

She killed herself, girl, after these posts and the responses she got. No doubt trolling from the community in comments like this played a part. I hope she’s at peace now. RIP Emily

No your activities here is questionable . Unfortuantley people are comming here or in  face book group to get correct inforamtion . it is questionable why many people and admin established their business here and they are fooling people to get money. Everything in my ct scan and photos are clear . I also attached some quotes from other surgeons that shows  the demage is issreverable and I need to live with this terrible face  by the rest of my life

You know, I’m surprised you wouldn’t be more supportive given your history of posting botched surgeries. Emily killed her self this week, after everyone started turning on her and telling her that what she was feeling wasn’t valid. Surely as trans women we understand the importance of validation. And now we have lost a sister. RIP Emily.

She was trying to share her feelings on her surgery and several people said she was lying or that this post should be removed. And it got to much for her. She killed her self this week.

No, I said you post about botched surgeries, literally all of your posts. They are not even your surgeries. Yet here you were gate keeping what can and can’t be posted. And now this young trans women is dead.

I’m glad I could clarify. You say you want to warn girls of butcher srs and ffs, but you were still saying this post should be deleted. It makes me sad (and I’m not singling you put because there are others) but this kind of gate-keeping contributes to the young girl who posted this to commit suicide. I just feel morally obliged to let you know Emily is dead. Killed herself and was found in her blanket. I hope in the future you reconsider what people should be allowed to post because we’re supposed to be sisters, you know? We should listen to each other.

The point is others don&#39;t trap by Dr Baez and other surgeons behind the FFS surgeries . There is no valid reason to remove it because paid people like you want it . if admins remove this topic , they show their dependency to the FFS mafia.

I&#39;m not paid by anyone. And I&#39;m not even sure many go to Dr Baez. Never heard of him until you mentioned him. You&#39;re making him more famous.

You are . it&#39;s not difficult for me to recognise you by your activities online . This post is for however who can possibly get fooled by the Baez team .he will not get famous . he did 3 FFS surgeries so far.The first one is on his service coordinator . The second one was on a girl that they claim that she did surgery with him(there is no sign of that girl in any place ). The thirth one was on me and it has terrible results as you can see in my photo and ct scan . i talked with Facial team for the revision and they said the extent of damage is not fixable

Its reported on Facebook that the OP, Emily Core, has committed suicide.
</p>
<p>
For the record, this post of hers was 22 days ago.
</p>
<p>
She made a public post on Facebook a few weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/emily.core.509/posts/747009702786264">https://www.facebook.com/emily.core.509/posts/747009702786264</a>
</p>
<p>
There’s some other Facebook posts by those who knew her and her full story, but they are not public. I will say that its not possible to understand her story from what&#39;s posted here. I&#39;m not comfortable repeating what others have said in private forums, nor am I comfortable deleting her posts, so I&#39;ll leave this this as is.
</p>
<p>
I’ve removed a few comments posted since she passed that are inappropriate and I’m locking this for the moment.
