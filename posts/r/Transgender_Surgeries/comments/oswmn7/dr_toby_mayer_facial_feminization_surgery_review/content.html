Well I’ve been dragging my feet on writing this for a while now, my excuse being that I want to be completely healed before I actually share my opinion. Nine months out and that line of thought is wearing thin, so without further ado…
</p>
<p>
My Facial Feminization Surgery with Dr Toby Mayer
</p>
<p>
What I had done: Hairline lowering, brow lift, orbital ridge recontouring, rhinoplasty, cheek implants, lip lift with fascia transfer, chin shave, and tracheal shave.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to answer any questions, but I find this less than compelling to write about (says the person that wrote 1000+ words) so I&#39;m probably going to be patient so that I can provide the lion&#39;s share of my answers in one go.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Good
</strong>
: For the most part I’ll try to let the photos speak for themselves:
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/zBvXZhW">https://imgur.com/a/zBvXZhW
</a>
. Everyone I talk to who’s seen my face has good things to say, ranging from surprise that I’ve had any work done to telling me I look gorgeous. I guess the closest thing I have to objective data on this is my dating profile blows up as soon as I turn incognito mode off – I’ve had people ask me if I was cis on Grindr, and that throws me for a loop.
</p>
<p>
In a general sense I feel a lot better about my appearance now. I’m more confident and feel less compulsion to put a bunch of work into my appearance. I’ll wear a mask and pajamas to the corner store as an example, but even then I’m getting gendered correctly without anyone having to hear my voice. Been a long time since I’ve gotten misgendered, even at work when I start slipping into guy voice around halfway through my day. Had a person be legitimately surprised to hear that I’m trans. I’m pretty open about my identity so I’ll never be closeted barring dangerous circumstances, but it’s nice to know that’s an option – and being the cis passing token trans woman helps people take me seriously when I get outspoken about trans equality.
</p>
<p>
Everyone at Dr Mayer&#39;s office was wonderful. I had my nosed bumped roughly 2 weeks post op and the nurse Frankie (sp?) got back to me almost immediately and was very reassuring and patient with me (it was a very light bump, I was being paranoid). Keely the surgical coordinator was both prompt and very nice through our entire interaction and all of our follow ups, I remember gossiping about her dogs a little bit and it was delightful. I found Dr Mayer himself amazing, he’s been doing this by his own admission for half a century now. You’d have no idea given how energetic he is, clearly he’s very much in love with the work he does. He’ll explain what he does and why he does it, though if you have any questions beforehand it’d be best to have them written down because it is easy to forget them with how the flow of his face to face appointments go. He is very proud of the work he does, and he makes that clear – never seen another surgeon do that, I wonder if it’s a plastics thing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Bad
</strong>
: So as a baseline I’ve only had a couple of other surgeries, and neither of them gender confirming, just a pilonidal cyst excision and a vasectomy (no, the absurdity isn’t lost on me). I’m going to be honest, the recovery for FFS
<em>
SUCKED
</em>
. Dr Mayer told me I could go back to work in a month without any weight lifting restrictions, but I was on 10 pound restriction for that first month if I recall correctly. Breakthrough pain was perfectly manageable on roughly 20mg of opiates the first day, tapering down from there. I took a total of 90mg (18 pills) of oxycodone + NSAID + the steroid (methylprednisolone IIRC), which was adequate to keep my pain sufficiently controlled. But you&#39;re still just dirt tired for weeks.
</p>
<p>
The worst of it was the cheek implants, you aren’t allowed to use a straw or do anything that generates oral suction for a good long time. I used a straw for the first time two months post-surgery (well outside the danger zone) without thinking about it and had a small panic attack after the first sip. And they just hurt, outside that. You have to shower a few times in the first week to wash JUST your hair, and that is really annoying with all of the considerations you have to put into it (taping a plastic covering over your face to keep it dray). Have to sleep with your head elevated for a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise be mentally prepared to both look and feel bad for a bit, that’s totally normal for any gender affirming procedure and it’s why trans people’s mental health typically dips immediately following an intervention like this. Whatever your self-care routine is, make sure it’s adjusted to the limitations you’ll have and make sure it’s low energy so you can still engage in it while you are wiped out by the healing process.
</p>
<p>
I wish the communication around some of the aftercare had been more prompt. While I was under the knife my care person was given some print outs pertaining to each procedure I had done with the relevant considerations and limitations on them. Dr Mayer’s office touched base with me 2 weeks prior about getting x rays sent over - they could have emailed the electronic copies of these print outs at the time and I think that would have made my recovery easier. Dr Mayer also stopped my pre existing scheduled medications due to clotting concerns, and I would have liked a heads up there – I can only discontinue one of those guys without risking some awful side effects, and I think that a patient with less medical literacy that me may have missed that (ie. the majority of patients).
</p>
<p>
I don’t have any complaints with my results. The tip of my nose is a bit asymmetrical, and I think that’s because I had to go back to wearing a mask while still healing. I got the masks with a substantial wire in them so I could shape them away from resting on the bridge of my nose, but I guess the tip wasn’t spared. It can only be seen from certain angles, and even then it’s subtle. Really doesn’t bother me one bit, perfection was never the goal, and I don’t think the Dr Mayer’s technique was at all the problem.
</p>
<p>
What I would tell myself if I had a time machine:
</p>
<p>
· Button up tops and elastic waist pants are going to be the entirety of your wardrobe for a while.
</p>
<p>
· Soft pasta, light soups, pudding, applesauce, and peanut butter are good sources of calories that are easy to eat while chewing is difficult.
</p>
<p>
· If you start feeling light headed while walking around it may be because your food intake is inadequate to retain enough water and drinking some chicken bouillon will offset that.
</p>
<p>
· I had no trouble drinking from glasses or cans.
</p>
<p>
· It is VERY easy to take for granted how much dead skin you remove from your lips by passively chewing on them through the day, and that isn’t an option while the worst of the swelling is around. 3-4 times a day, take a washcloth with lukewarm water and gently clean your lips.
</p>
<p>
· Make sure the place you are staying is ADA accessible, meaning ground floor accommodations or elevator. I had to take the stairs to my air BnB unit and it sucked.
</p>
<p>
· I tolerate opiate pain medication really well, and I still spent most of the first week just zonked out. Make sure you have some sort of passive entertainment around for your recovery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Ugly
</strong>
: Nothing. Look at the damn photos, I’m gorgeous.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
EDITS:
</p>
<p>
7/29: The healing around the cheek implants inside of my mouth were a bit asymmetric from one side to the other, and that did concern me. But after a few months out it was fine. If you are getting laser hair removal, you have to pause that for a bit after the implants are placed (2 months, I believe. Don&#39;t quote me.) I still don&#39;t let technicians remove hair directly over them because 1) I&#39;m paranoid, and 2) I had enough work done prior that the hair at that level is completely translucent, so it&#39;s a moot point.

I had a little bit of brow bossing prior to ffs, but it wasn&#39;t terribly appreciable. You can see in the last picture with the left eye hiding behind my nose that my eyes are still kind of recessed into my skull below the orbital ridge. Plenty of cis women have that, though I bet I wouldn&#39;t have nearly as much overhang - even with FFS - without having been put through my natal puberty. So it&#39;s noticable, but you have to know what to look for, and its more a curiosity than a detraction IMHO.
</p>
<p>
As for my sinuses, here&#39;s my x ray:
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/PkZQQbR">https://imgur.com/a/PkZQQbR
</a>
. You know what this means, right? Right? Seriously, please tell me what it means, I&#39;m at a bit of a loss.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve looked at and interpreted a small handful of cranial CTs and MRIs, but then I&#39;m always looking at the brain or assessing a skull fracture. I have no experience interpreting cranial radiographs, so uh... I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s a skull. Yep. Though that is a pretty clear view of the frontal sinus, I see why that&#39;s the view Dr Mayer orders. FWIW, I checked in the program and it told me the overlaying bone is .29 cm, but that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for you.
</p>
<p>
(Hey,
<a href="/u/DrTobyMayer">u/DrTobyMayer
</a>
sorry I missed your AMA, I was in the middle of a SUB I. But if you fire reddit up you can consider this permission to explain the imaging and its relevance to my case.)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got a follow up appointment with him soon, so I&#39;ll ask him the question and edit my comment to reflect his answer in the likely event that he doesn&#39;t spend much time on reddit.
</p>
<p>
And... yeah, I&#39;m right there with you. I&#39;ve tried to find literature speaking to outcomes based on forehead revisions and I came up empty. Quantifying cosmetic outcomes is difficult, and this is a niche surgery. Expert opinion is all we have to go on, and each one of those is highly unique.
</p>
<p>
Neck incision for the tracheal shave is fine, have to stand really close to a mirror with a light shining directly on it to appreciate it at all. You&#39;d probably be able to make it out in the fifth picture if my phone had a higher resolution camera and the lighting was different. Also have a bigger scar right underneath my chin that couldn&#39;t get tucked into a skin fold, so it&#39;s a bit more obvious but it&#39;s also an angle that I&#39;m rarely if ever actually seen from.

Thanks for sharing!  You look amazing!!  You mention you had orbital ridge contouring, did this include the orbital rims around your eyes?  You had large eyes to begin with but now they look ever larger.  Was that the result of shaving down the orbital rim also??

Nerd moment:
<a href="http://pressbooks-dev.oer.hawaii.edu/anatomyandphysiology/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/704_Skull-01.jpg">http://pressbooks-dev.oer.hawaii.edu/anatomyandphysiology/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/704_Skull-01.jpg
</a>
</p>
<p>
If you look at the diagram above you see the frontal bone (pink), and you can see that it makes up the entirety of the superior orbital ridge. It&#39;s been a while, so I have a bit of trouble remembering exactly which parts were tender, but I&#39;d say he shaved from the midline (labeled &#34;Glabella&#34; here) to about 75% of the way to the zygomatic bone (green, to the sides). There was more bone volume removed from the center than the sides.
</p>
<p>
Subjectively speaking and based on looking at a handful of results, Dr Mayer strikes me as being really talented at making his patients&#39; eyes look bigger. Given my blue eyes and black hair, it just happens to stand out that much more in my case.

A person without insurance coverage would pay 53k, IIRC.

Hi!!
</p>
<p>
Thank you SO much for posting about your Mayer experience. You look...so, so...so good.  I&#39;m looking to have a revison with him and my question is about insurance.  I saw your comment about an uninsured person paying 53K.
</p>
<p>
Did you use insurance? I&#39;m currently uninsured and looking for a provider.  I have called Mayer&#39;s office twice to ask about providers they&#39;ve worked with before.  Answers weren&#39;t clear.
</p>
<p>
If you used insurance,  can you tell me what provider. I just want to get someone who they&#39;ll accept. Thank you SO much for your time.

Your photos just reiterate what I&#39;ve seen from others. Dr Mayer is top notch for FFS. If/When I get a chance at FFS, I dont think I&#39;d go to anyone else. All of Dr Mayer&#39;s FFS patients have stunning results.

There is a very good chance any asymmetry of your nose will correct itself. I had uneven nostrils for several months post-FFS (surgeon was Dr. Zukowski), but it evened out eventually.. You look great!
