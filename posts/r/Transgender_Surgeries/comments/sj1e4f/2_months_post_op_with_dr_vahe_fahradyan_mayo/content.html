AMA!
</p>
<p>
Dr Fahradyan is Mayo Clinic&#39;s new hire, and I was one of his first patients. I was originally on the waiting list for Dr Martinez, but COVID extended his waiting list out to 2023. I age off of my parents&#39; insurance this year, so it was good luck that Dr Fahradyan came along. He was a gentleman and very responsive to my questions + concerns. Mayo staff made frequent mention of his unique method of dressing the area post-op, with a wound vacuum. I was essentially hooked up to a box that sucked the blood out of me. Some nurses told me that my swelling was greatly reduced compared to other girls immediately post-op, so that&#39;s something!
</p>
<p>
The redness along the bottom is from losing a good portion of my skin graft to necrosis in the first month. That sucked to deal with, but thankfully it remained contained, and subsided after the dead tissue fell out. Massaging the new skin is slowly returning color and sensation. Dilating hasn&#39;t hurt for about a month now. I&#39;m excited to see how i look after scar treatment :D

glad to see that his work is decent, I had my consult with him not that long ago and compared to sitting in on my SO&#39;s consult with Martinez... honestly made me terrified to get SRS and BA..... it was all bad news and no good, no solid reassuring and just left me scared to trust him with my body.... but looks great! just got my insurance approvals yesterday and glad to see some results from him where he had none for the consult.

Thank you! Dr Fahradyan had a very clinical tone, for sure. Mayo Clinic in general is very reluctant to give reassurance. It caused me a lot of anxiety, too. Big bureaucracies and all that. But it all went smoothly for me and I know it will for you!
</p>
<p>
It was concerning that I wasn&#39;t allowed to see anyone&#39;s results, so I felt it was important to have record of his work somewhere. It feels even better down there since posting the OP. Swelling and hypergranulation are almost gone, I don&#39;t need pads anymore, and I have started scar treatment. I will post another update at 3 months :3

Thanks for sharing and replying to your post.  I&#39;ve been following it closely because I&#39;m supposed to have him as my surgeon and I haven&#39;t heard much from others and mayo kinda kept pushing my consultation back when it was just dr Martinez. I had my surgery education video visit last week and I&#39;m both anxious and excited because my consult is next month but no scheduling yet.  Can I pm you for prep advice?

I cant message you so I cut what I was going to ask.
</p>
<p>
Hi thanks for taking the time to let me ask you about what to expect. So the video call I had she basically asked about what I knew and if I had questions or concerns which mostly she told me to ask the surgical team or reach out to others.  I&#39;ve been on the wait list almost 2 years so hopefully having surgery within 6 to 8 months.  What things should I expect and start preparing for?

I gave you permission to DM me, so you can ask your remaining questions there. Pre-op the hardest thing to deal with wasn&#39;t insurance (thought that was close) but anxiety. I was so worried about making sure it was going to happen and happen perfectly that I didn&#39;t really stop to breathe until it was done. Reassure yourself that it&#39;s gonna happen, and it&#39;s going to go great. You got this!
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re going to be in hospital for at least 5 days, and in Rochester for at least 3 weeks, so be sure to bring someone you trust because they&#39;ll be your lifeline. Your mobility is going to be somewhat limited, so you&#39;ll need someone who can keep their cool and treat you like a princess while you&#39;re incapacitated and bleeding.
</p>
<p>
Try not to go in the winter if you can help it. The snow made everything harder, especially getting groceries. Be sure to get everything on the pre-op shopping list they send you. I used diapers instead of pads for the first month because even big pads didn&#39;t contain the discharge, but you figure should figure out what works for you. Be sure do dispose of them properly, or your hotel room will smell.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s what I can think of off the top of my head. If you need anything else, let me know ‚ù§

I believe they said only Dr Fahradyan used a wound vac. The nurses were all in the process of learning how to work with it, and there was no mention of a wound vac in my consultation with Dr Martinez. I was told they are in the process of &#34;standardizing the experience&#34;

It hurt less than my car accident. If that was a 9, then my pain the first month was a 7 overall. The first night will be the most uncomfortable, but if you&#39;re like me you&#39;ll be too happy to care.
