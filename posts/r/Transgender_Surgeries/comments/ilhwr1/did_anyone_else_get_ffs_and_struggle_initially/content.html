Did anyone else get FFS and struggle initially with how different they looked?

Trans guy here, but for what it&#39;s worth, despite now loving my results, when they first took off my bandages and showed me my results with top surgery, I had a panic attack and almost passed out just because everything looked so
<em>
different
</em>
, and it was scary to see my body so beat up/stitched up.
</p>
<p>
Give it time, and let yourself adjust to your new body, and you&#39;ll feel better soon,  I promise

Yo, the same thing happened to me after top surgery. And my mom and the nurse there were so excited for me, telling me how good I looked, and I just almost collapsed.
</p>
<p>
It totally just takes some getting used to, especially for the swelling and scarring to clear up. Hang in there, OP!!

This is something I wrote at day 11 post FFS when someone asked me the question
</p>
<p>
&#34;How does it feel to look in the mirror&#34;
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
it&#39;s so many things. I&#39;ve described it as like a really intense haircut x 1000
</p>
<p>
There is a lot to integrate here. At times I feel like I&#39;ve created a new mask over a thing I didn&#39;t like. Other times I feel like I&#39;ve just peeled off a bunch of parts of my face that didn&#39;t quite fit. Other times it feels like I&#39;m looking at a stranger that I need to become. Sometimes I just look at my face and cry in happiness and sometimes I recoil.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get me wrong it&#39;s a huge net positive and I&#39;m super happy in a sense but it&#39;s imo impossible to really prepare for altering such a fundamental part of your internal and external self image with out a shit ton of processing
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The new face has fully integrated into me though and now I don&#39;t feel like that at all - it just feels like me and all the feelings of it being fake or not real or othering have fallen away and all that remains is me, a better me that has removed most of the things about my face that caused me anguish and everyday I look into my mirror and I smile so big I laugh.
</p>
<p>
So yeah it can take time to integrate a radical change in your appearance. Be kind to yourself. in the meantime. Think your thoughts. Work through them. Remember you have friends, you have community.

That is honestly what I am hoping for. Just complete integration after carving off the extra dysphoric bone mass that testosterone produced. It is like I can currently see my face, but it is buried under bone mass that shouldn&#39;t be there. Thank you for sharing that.

Took me a long time to feel good about myself. probably 6+ months. Words of advice. try listening to those around you, peers, friends, family, the random old lady on the street. If you&#39;re anything like me, we are our worst critics.

No, i still look like me.  I think when you’ve aged a bit you realize that there is no reified “me.”  People change over time naturally.

I had the exact opposite experience. I&#39;m angry that I still look the same.

I still hate it. I&#39;m 7 months postop and still unhappy. My surgery was botched and I changed for the worst. My face butcher for some odd reason did not have my best interest at heart and carried out my surgery negligently. I wish I can turn back time.
