Does anyone know anything about Pryia med for ffs surgery? I cant find their website but it seems theres a lot of marketing spent on their youtube channel. Theres only a facebook page that i found. Seems legit but would be more calm if there was some more before and after of surgeons work.

Probably because they get so blasted by the admins when they try to cover for their inadequacy and abhorrent behavior. I had full FFS and BA there back in 2017 and I would only say avoid at all costs.

They get blasted time and time again because she and her lackeys attempt to make excuses for Jane’s bad behavior.  She has got some serious mental issues and refuses to get them addressed.  She is only the medical tourism company owner. She isn’t a surgeon, although she claims to have invented the PPV procedure (need I say more about her deficiency in character).  Malignant narcissist and control freak come to mind immediately.
</p>
<p>
It’s not just me, there are so many others that have had bad experiences with her. At some point you realize that 30+ unrelated women with massive concerns about the owner of the outfit only all have a single common denominator- Jane.
</p>
<p>
I was one of the first clients, gave her plenty of warnings that she can’t treat people like shit and play ‘mean girls’ without serious consequences; especially over time as the word gets out.
</p>
<p>
Surgically I got a fantastic result and am very happy with my results; especially for an older woman.
</p>
<p>
This post was about the medical tourism company and Jane - and that is what I am willing to discuss.

You mentioned good results. If I wanted good results, do you think it would be worthwhile for me to approach the hospital directly or is that not an option that you&#39;re aware of?

Parag Telang has his clinic which Jane used initially
<a href="http://designerbodyz.in/" rel="nofollow">http://designerbodyz.in/
</a>
He is a master as far as I am concerned with my particular results. He is also able and willing at all times to consider a revision if necessary. (Lived experience)  I am certain that he would work with you on a treatment plan and likely for less cost than having someone in the middle brokering things.   I hope that this helps.

Thank you for your thoughtful response. As it happened, I did just that before your reply and am awaiting his contact. Yes, my thought was that he&#39;s an excellent surgeon. Thanks again for corroborating that.

They have a follow page on facebook and youtube channel? Seems pretty legit to me? Only thing thats weird is they dont have a website and they dont allow you to come with your loved ones but alone which i think its super weird

PriyaMed has pretty mixed (mostly negative) reviews of their work on the facebook group. I didn’t even know they did FFS and they’re not ever mentioned in the FFS facebook group either.

The most recent report of a girl who went to PriyaMed had a complete failure of her peritoneal graft, resulting in complete vaginal stenosis, and alleged that three others she met from her time there did as well. She provided photo evidence of the aftermath of her complications. She also had to have extensive revisions on her clitoris and vulva in general.
</p>
<p>
There isn’t many reviews in general though. I saw a recent review that spoke positively of them but she hadn’t gotten SRS yet (but now may be freshly post-op since her post was speaking about arriving in India). I recommend looking up ‘PriyaMed’ in the group’s search bar to get the full scope.

Hi there...
</p>
<p>
I just happen to be in India at PriyaMed&#39;s villa right now. And can vouch for them being legit.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t offer first hand testimony on FFS because I&#39;m here for peritoneal pull-through vaginoplasty. But I guess I may report on that afterwards if there is enough interest.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and Jane herself? I like her, and more importantly can vouch for her also being legit. Outspoken, yes. Definitely. Quite. But from everything I’ve seen she is that and strict because she truly cares.
</p>
<p>
The method the team of doctors PM works with can offer what I’ve seen no other achieve—but is *not* to be taken lightly.The surgeons&#39; work obviously only takes final form during the healing process.
<em>
And is for life.
</em>
</p>
<p>
Thus, one must be ready and willing to view instructions regarding post-operative care as
<em>
at the very least
</em>
as important as the surgery itself. And to follow them.
</p>
<p>
If unable to faithfully follow given instructions, please consider considering one of the traditional methods instead.
</p>

Thank you for writing.. i believe they are legit too now i think. The comments against seem more like a personal vendetta for whatever reason than actual bad results. But i guess i understand both sides; it is very emotional to go through something so big and especially if you go through it alone or if you think youre ready and maybe afterwards you realize you werent ready..

I checked in a Facebook FFs group many bad reviews. One girl who got super infected by a bug after the surgery and they denied any treatment. Almost all surgeries performed by them need revision. It seems a really bad company.

Umm no? In the earlier comment to another comment i wanted to know more because it didnt sound to me like results were bad. Just that the process wasnt as she imagined it to be. And she kinda confirmed it to me. And thats okay. With this infection thing its also from the list from the group and its all related to some grs/srs surgeries that im not even considering. To me their ffs work seem legit and like they produce incredible results
