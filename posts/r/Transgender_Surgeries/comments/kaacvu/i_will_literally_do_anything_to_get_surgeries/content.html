Nonstop misgendering and dysphoria have made it almost impossible to make it through a day of interacting with people doing the like. I seriously can&#39;t function anymore because of this. I can&#39;t hold down a job or a place. I wish I could just do what I need to but I can&#39;t. I&#39;ve tried. Therapy, in patient, out patient, meds. But it doesn&#39;t help. The only thing that will help at this point is getting those surgeries.  I would literally do almost anything to get those surgeries.  I&#39;d sell my soul. I&#39;d marry someone just for the money. I&#39;d sell my body. Anything, anything if it meant finally passing and fitting in.  I will never be happy until I get those surgeries. And I need them done yesterday

I have a few suggestions.  To get a job and tone it down a bit and just be andgrogynous until you ger yourself settled and cash for surgery.  As Tranz we have to strategic about picking and choosing our battles.  Going the androgynous route for a bit might help you cope in order to get a steady paycheck.
</p>
<p>
This next route is to enroll in a College fulltime.  Take out max student student loans,amd when then the refund comes use it for a crib of your own (share with some other lgbt). Or go to a state university and get in the dorms.  Start saving for surgeries.  You gotta keep up your grades to keep the money coming.
</p>
<p>
Sex work is always available.  There are a number of types.  Do your research. Best of luck.

Could you better describe &#34;going androgynous&#34; especially as a trans girl? Like I already feel pretty androgynous, at least in the ways I dress and wear my makeup, if I feel like wearing makeup. I&#39;ve had my hair SUPER long before too and I&#39;m growing it back out. Things like the length of one&#39;s hair and how that relates to people&#39;s perceptions of gender have never made much sense if any at all to me.  I have a super masculine phenotype. Mostly my height, build and the bone structure in my face.  I don&#39;t try to be a girly-girl or a tomboy. Things like that change with my mood. And I can sure be moody. I&#39;m just being me though.  I just dont want to be misgendered anymore. I want people to look at me and see a woman, no questions asked. I want to be stealth.

Maybe I should redefine anything. Reason I say that is I did work at Starbucks for that very reason. But interfacing with the public and the all day onslaught of being misgendered was more than I can take. It seriously made more dysphoric and with that depressed and even suicidal. Maybe there is no hope for me. Maybe I&#39;m just weak. I can&#39;t handle being misgendered. I can&#39;t function

I&#39;m planning on moving to a more accepting area very soon. I don&#39;t know anyone anywhere else but I don&#39;t really know a lot of people where I live now. I&#39;m already homeless so fuck it what else I got to lose

That&#39;s fucking fair ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I had to work retail when I started E and that was rough as shit  Like the other commenter said, amazon warehouse work will keep you away from customers but with good benefits. Or if you have any experience coding could try to find a job doing that, they usually have good insurance and you&#39;ll rarely have to interact with people. If neither if those works it honestly might be best to try and suffer through starbucks again (which yeah easier said than done) since you know it&#39;ll significantly improve your qol.

I think Amazon is the way to go. Work conditions are hard from what I&#39;ve heard, but at least you won&#39;t have to be in the public eye. Their insurance is excellent for trans people though. If I could go back in time I would have done that rather than taking out huge personal loans I&#39;ll be stuck with for a while, but I found out too late.
</p>
<p>
I work retail and it sucks but it is doable. People misgender me all day even though I&#39;ve had FFS and breast+butt aug (granted, these things are all hidden under mask+pharmacist lab coat). I think part of the reason is that I&#39;m still at the pharmacy I was at before social transition so most people probably think I&#39;m just gay/a feminine guy or something, even though my nametag name is different. People can be very oblivious.
</p>
<p>
When I work in stores other than my own, I usually get gendered correctly. Also when I&#39;m not at work I get gendered correctly unless I&#39;m presenting male or talking to them before they see me. I get misgendered on the phone 95% of the time, I&#39;m still working on voice training.

I feel so bad for you, I really do! But if there‚Äôs something you can try then it‚Äôs some kind of job that doesn‚Äôt make you have to interact with strangers. That‚Äôs the best I can come up with. I wish you all the luck!

I would highly recommend at starting at square one. Realizing people may misgender and that‚Äôs not their fault, we live in a society that is very black and white. And it‚Äôs ok, everyone fucks up. It‚Äôs our job as transgender to be sweet and polite and kindly let them know what we prefer to be called. If it‚Äôs just a customer it‚Äôs often best to not think twice and move on. You may be the first transgender person they‚Äôve ever met. I know it‚Äôs exhausting to always be polite. But let them remember their first trans interaction which is you, as the sweetest person they‚Äôve ever met. In the end we are all human we are all one. My second thought was, and I don‚Äôt mean to scare you. But most psychologist won‚Äôt sign off on any surgeries if you aren‚Äôt happy, stable and successful in your current state. Genitals don‚Äôt make us who we are. If you aren‚Äôt happy in your current state, you won‚Äôt be happy with new body parts either. The gender affirmation should just be that, an affirmation to what you‚Äôve always felt was right inside. I know what you are going through, life doesn‚Äôt feel normal, and it‚Äôs ok! Remind yourself nobody is normal, we are all just trying to figure shit out, we all have our own baggage. We are all on this rock flying through outer space just trying to survive and do our best. SO LONG STORY SHORT...start with a step you can do now, for instance, get a job, any job that has insurance that covers SRS. And with your first pay check buy one treatment of hair removal. It‚Äôs a step, and the very first step. Most insurance won‚Äôt cover hair removal and no surgeon will work on you unless you‚Äôve had 9-12 months of hair removal. So start small - make a step you can easily complete and complete it. Then you will feel accomplished, which will bring you confidence, which will bring you happiness, and one step closer to being the true you! Chin up, I know you got this! You are resilient!

Wait the college covered it? While you were still in school? I&#39;d live to go to school for video and audio recording, producing, and sound engineering.  You&#39;re telling me I could go to and not only have the surgery but that the college will cover it?

Well you can wear a face mask. So most likely the only thing clocking you to get missgendered is your voice. Work on that and passing gets a lot easier. Then re apply at Starbucks or move to CA and get medi-cal
