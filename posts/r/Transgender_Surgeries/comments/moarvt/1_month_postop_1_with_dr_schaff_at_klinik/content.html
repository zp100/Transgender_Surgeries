I had my first procedure with Dr Schaff a month ago, and this is how everything looks at the moment. I stayed in hospital for 15 nights altogether. The hospital were great, though I wasn&#39;t prepared for the trips to theatre for the dressing changes, washing and stitches out - these happen at about days 5-10, and can be quite painful - I&#39;d recommend some pain relief before going down if you can.  Not everyone spoke good English, but I speak enough bad German that we got through any rough spots, with an occasional resort to Google Translate!
</p>
<p>
Depth has been good, I&#39;m at about 18cm / 7in. I&#39;ve been able to work up to the largest of the 3 dilators I have, and can now start with the second one instead of the first. I&#39;ve been very pleased with my progress there!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still on Ibuprofen. When I was discharged I was on Novamin as well, but this is not available in the UK - so if this is an issue for you, let them know.  My UK doctor gave me codeine instead, but it wasn&#39;t as effective and made me sleepy and disorientated.  Everything is obviously still quite swollen, but compared to when I first saw everything, it&#39;s calmed down a lot already and is better every day.
</p>
<p>
I hope all this is useful, do ask me anything below, or privately if you&#39;d rather.

So is this the result of Stage one? It seems othere&#39;s have indicated that he does a 2-step procedure?
</p>
<p>
It looks great either way.

Yes, this is stage 1 of 2.  The stage 2 is more about aesthetics, and correcting any issues from stage 1.  In the first op, Dr Schaff preserves pretty much everything possible, even if this means some parts appear a bit oversized.  The second stage is usually 6 months or so later, when swelling has mostly gone down, everything has healed, and it&#39;s clearer exactly what needs to be done where, and what was just because of swelling and has since settled down!

Oh that&#39;s awesome, so far the best result I&#39;ve seen and very informative. Would you be so kind and maybe post of the end result after 6months or so? Because i always have such a bad feeling of surgery cause i have the fear of it looking really bad.

Of course!  I&#39;m planning to hopefully do updates monthly until everything&#39;s settled after the second surgery.  I&#39;m hoping this will be in September but haven&#39;t booked it in yet!

No problem. It is certainly expensive - I paid 22,000 € for the first operation, and will pay 11,000 € for the second in September or so.  The second procedure is normally done, but if you&#39;re happy enough after the first you don&#39;t

to do it!

The thing is my dilator, or bougie as they call them there. That one is the largest of the three I got width-wise, they&#39;re all about 8&#34;/20cm long.  Dr Schaff doesn&#39;t go for the hard plastic dilators most seem to end up with, these are made of a sturdy foam but have a little give in them.

So they stretch your vigina after surgery? I thought it was over after surgery, just wait abit and then you get to feel normal.

That isn&#39;t there all the time!  Pretty much all vaginoplasties will require you to dilate a few times a day for a few months, then occasionally (one or twice a week) thereafter.  The schedule depends on you and your surgeon and the method used.
</p>
<p>
In the beginning, you are working to make sure that the scarring that is caused by the surgery doesn&#39;t heal too tight, so it&#39;s frequent until the scars are pretty much healed.  After this, you&#39;re making sure that the vagina doesn&#39;t get too narrow over time but this isn&#39;t even nearly as intense, hence it can be far less often (or not at all if you have regular PIV sex or use a suitable dildo or vibrator).

I love that it&#39;s called Klinik Sanssouci. Who wouldn&#39;t want to get surgery at Clinic No Worries? Hakuna matata! (Yes, I know about the palace, but it&#39;s still fun.)

This is a month after the 1st operation of the 2-stage combined method vaginoplasty. Dr. Schaff and a couple of others in Germany have been offering the method for about 20 years now.
</p>
<p>
The method has many similarities with the Suporn method but has some differences as well... not least that it&#39;s in 2 parts!  This has the obvious disadvantage that you normally go to hospital twice, and pay for that, but the advantages are that dilation is usually easier, and the end results are normally really good. In the first stage, as much is preserved as possible, and some refinement is carried out in the second stage - this makes it easier to achieve a really good end result as everything is well calmed after stage 1 and the surgeon can see what they have to do much better.
</p>
<p>
Depth is normally good and the method also goes to some lengths to preserve as much sensation as possible. The method here differs from Suporn et al as well, where I believe they create a separate sensate area, whereas this method creates a larger, Y-shaped clitoris which is most present at the top but wraps around inside and down each side of the labia, more like a cis one.

No, the method is called the Combined Method. It uses penile and scrotal skin, but there is emphasis on removing stress where possible (part of the reason for doing it in 2 stages), and the scrotal skin it used at the end of the canal (so furthest inside) rather than at the back of the canal. The scrotal skin used  is removed, de-fatted and hair removed before use, which means no electrolysis is necessary on it first.

The urethra is also used along the canal. For many this mucosa gives moisture/lubrication.

Hi there! I was wondering if Dr. Schaff could speak in English? I can understand german but it’s not my mother language. I think it would be better for things to be explained to me in English especially with the consultation.

Dr Schaff does speak good English.  There were a couple of more complicated words in my consultation where we had to slow down, or look something up, but we understood each other well enough.  My German is really bad, if yours is any better than that you&#39;ll have no problem at all throughout- some staff at the Klinik aren&#39;t good English speakers, though most are either good, or learning and getting better.
</p>
<p>
Addendum:  Although most of the conversation can be done in English, a fair amount of the written documentation is still in German, particularly some of the consent forms and things.  I spent a bit of time translating these.

Thank you so much for your reply. I have been considering to go so the surgery with him. I’m still in the stage with my psychologist to get the OP Indikation. Hopefully once that’s sorted I’m able to get a consultation with him and hopefully get an approval with the insurance. Wishful thinking that the wait list for dr Schaff is not too long.
