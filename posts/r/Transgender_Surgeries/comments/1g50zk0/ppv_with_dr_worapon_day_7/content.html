I haven&#39;t seen many people posting about Dr Worapon as a vaginoplasty surgeon, so I thought I&#39;d add a write-up of my experience. It&#39;s currently in the evening of day 7 and I am in the middle of my first dilation.
</p>
<p>
I chose Dr Worapon for a few different reasons. I was definitely looking for a surgeon who did PPV and he was the only one I could find who use the peritoneum for the full length of the vagina, rather than in combination with a skin graft. I was already working with Saphira from Amani Thailand, and she spoke very highly of the surgeon’s skills. I also appreciated the effort he went to to keep his patients comfortable, like stopping bowel movements during recovery and using sedation for unpacking. Throughout the process he was flexible approach according to my needs.
</p>
<p>
You are admitted to hospital and do a standard bowel prep the day before. This was a lesser version of what I had before previous colonoscopies. He operates at around 1 pm so I was taken into the OR at this point. I didn&#39;t come out until close to midnight, as apparently the person operating the laparoscopic device took three hours in order to harvest the laparoscopic tissue I used. It may have also been longer because I&#39;m quite thin (the surgeon referred to me as malnourished and said he would have to be very careful not to perforate my bowel because everything is so close together.)
</p>
<p>
When I came out I was in 8/10 pain. It took awhile for the painkillers to kick in. I also had a level one pressure sore on my tailbone, probably because of the length of time I spent on the table. This meant I couldn&#39;t lay on my back until day four, which was quite limiting when I couldn&#39;t leave bed.
</p>
<p>
The following days blurred into each other. I was able to spend most of the days sleeping, especially the mornings. I paid an extra 1500 baht per day to have a morphine drip for the first three days, which was definitely worth it. I haven&#39;t had a big appetite but I&#39;ve been eating small meals, mostly just fish and eggs with a little bit of rice and vegetables. The hospital food wasn&#39;t bad at all, and you can also get delivery food from a wide radius. Dr Worapon gets his patients to take constipating medication so that we can eat without having a bowel movement and risking infection.
</p>
<p>
On the morning of day 4 I got out of bed for the first time. The nurses woke me up, gave me a sponge bath and then got me to walk to the bathroom to brush my teeth. It was pretty exhausting, although I think doing it before I had any food in my stomach might not have been ideal. I haven&#39;t been in a great deal of pain since the first night. Just a fairly constant ache and some burning pain every now and then. The biggest discomfort has been the catheter, which has made me feel like I am busting to pee at all times. There are plenty of pain relief options, which I appreciated. I even suggested at one point that we add gabapentin to my medications and he agreed.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon comes and visits me most days in the morning and has been super responsive to my needs. He really seems to care and wants me to have a positive experience.
</p>
<p>
This morning my packing, catheter and drains were all removed under IV sedation. I haven&#39;t heard of any other surgeons doing this but I think it&#39;s a great idea. That stuff was getting really uncomfortable and rubbing and I don&#39;t think I would&#39;ve loved the feeling of it coming out. I spent this evening on my first dilation and tomorrow I&#39;ll be getting out of hospital and heading to a rental apartment.
</p>
<p>
I won&#39;t be posting any pictures but there is a gallery on his website called the ‘MTF Showcase’, and mine looks pretty in line with the pictures on there.

If anyone has any questions feel free to reach out :)

Not that I&#39;m aware of. He said he was concerned about my low BMI but after my doctor wrote him a letter explaining that it wouldn&#39;t be an issue he was happy to go ahead. I didn&#39;t talk with him about upper limits, but I know that with some surgeons can also be which anaesthetist they use
