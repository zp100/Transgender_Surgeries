I felt so bad and guilty but the pain had diminished a little.

You were in pain and took what they gave you. There&#39;s nothing to feel guilty about.

Thank you for sharing this. I read your second half as well. Whitehead was on my short list and I even had a consult with him. I felt uneasy about him after the consult, and your story confirms I need to listen to those red flags. Iâ€™m sorry you are suffering, but also thank you for sharing it with others so that they may avoid it. It takes a lot of vulnerability to do that. I hope that you end up healing nicely or that revision finds its way into your path with ease.
