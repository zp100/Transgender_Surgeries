How did you navigate transitioning working in food service? I‚Äôm a bartender and brand new on HRT. Three weeks in. And congratulations on your surgery. Hope you heal wonderfully.

Well, I have insurance through my job, but I was just curious as to how you navigated working. You said jump around a lot. I guess that works. I‚Äôm thinking about just quitting where I‚Äôm at now and work another bar during the beginning stages(where no one knows me or my past) and then switch bars once I feel comfortable with presenting female full time. The only problem? Ive been at my bar for 18 years and it will be very difficult to leave everybody, but I‚Äôve got to do what i have to do to be happy.

Just to chime in, I transitioned while in food service and jumping around was what felt the most comfortable for me. I actually worked for a traveling food truck the summer I started hrt, and it took a huge weight off my shoulders not having to deal with scrutiny from cafe regulars or old coworkers. Once I started passing more, it also felt so good to settle down and get a fresh start in a new cafe job.
</p>
<p>
That being said, transitioning in food service is scary and uncomfortable! Customers can be so awful, if your co-workers have your back it may be worth it to stay in a supportive environment where people will stand up for you. Good luck whatever you decide ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thanks for sharing your experience, and I&#39;m super happy that it seems to have all gone well for you! I&#39;ve got a date with Dr. Bowers for next March, and I definitely appreciate you taking the time to share your experience, makes me feel a little more like I can handle it!

Hi ! We had surgery on the exact same day ! Have you progressed to wearing liners or are you still wearing pads ?
