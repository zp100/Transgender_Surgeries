it&#39;s really nothing like dilating. like sure, you can move the dilator in and out but (a) it&#39;s you that&#39;s doing the work and (b) a penis feels nothing like a dilator in obvious ways. Honestly, I think (a) is the bigger point of departure from dilating. like, the majority of sex I&#39;ve had since surgery has been in missionary and I found it really hot and beautiful, even, being under him, noticing the perfect correspondence between the movement of his hips and abs and the feeling he was giving me. Like, there&#39;s just More. and ya it&#39;s warmer too.
</p>
<p>
as far as tips go. Since it sounds like ur in a relationship or going to be with a guy who presumably likes you and whom you trust, communicate to him that you need him to be patient, and that it might take a little bit of unsexy logistical corrections to really figure out what&#39;s gonna work. Based on my first time: it won&#39;t start smoothly, you might need lube to get him in and you might need more lube once he&#39;s in. you may need to try different positions, or put a pillow under your pelvis. That being said, even the rockiest, least smooth post-op sex I&#39;ve had eventually got to the point where he could fuck me pretty good :P lol

That&#39;s encouraging, lol. I have heard a lot of people spend that time unbearably horny and unable to do anything about it, which is something I&#39;m dreading a bit and I hope doesn&#39;t happen to me

Itâ€™s more of a natural feeling with a guy because of their warmth and intimacy ( kissing , touching, rubbing), whereas the dilator can be used for pleasure but itâ€™s so hard in a not good way plus the angle of it is a bit uncomfortable and COLD!

Dilation uses a solid, rigid rod with a curve, it&#39;s meant to press things out of its way in order to stretch you open wider, and you use it by sliding it into place and applying pressure while you hold it there, in order to force your body to conform to its shape.
</p>
<p>
Sex with a warm, fleshy penis is different. There is a slight curve, that&#39;s similar, and the erection causes it to firm up, but it is still made of soft tissue that squeezes, compresses, and slightly bends inside a vagina. When it slides in and out while having sex, it is flesh on flesh, meaning that both parts will give a little bit and conform to each other. The rapid sliding in and out will be rougher than during dilation, and the penis will not be anywhere near as smooth as a dilator.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
hard cold dilator
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Run your dilator under warm (not super hot) water for a little bit before you dilate, it&#39;ll warm up. Alternatively, wrap it a thin towel to keep it clean and hold it close to your body so it warms up over the course of a minute or two off of your body heat. Starting with a warm dilator will feel a bit better than putting a cold one in and having it warm up over time inside of you.

I don&#39;t have intercourse with men, but I do have penetrative sex so I think I can answer. Obviously it&#39;s much more stimulating, not only because of the movement but also because of the non rigidity of most toys/all penises. That softness and texture really add to the experience, and all of the motion means that deeper tissues (including the g spot) are stimulated. Also, during sex there&#39;s increased blood flow to the area and so on which makes everything more sensitive.

The first period after surgery I&#39;m quite anxious and excited. How having sex will feel But when I really try to have the
<a href="https://feeling.Sex" rel="nofollow">feeling.Sex
</a>
with a warm, fleshy penis is different.  and the penis will not be anywhere near as smooth as a dilator.
</p>
<p>
Every day I can have orgasms and orgasm, but it takes a little longer than usual. Thanks to the surgeon Dr. Kanit who performed the operation for me. Until now I can feel like a real woman.
