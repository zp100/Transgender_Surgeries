Has anyone post orchi had pain that lasted for a very long time? It’s not a constant pain, but I still have pretty severe pain in that area after masturbating for any significant amount of time. And if I’m doing it every day it’s just kind of a constant pain there thats tender to the touch. It feels like the slight retraction of the testicles/spermatic cord during sex is still being triggered and pulling them up and that tension in the muscle is causing pain.
</p>
<p>
I was also wondering if anyone else had permanent sutures left on the spermatic cords? I was told they were in case I developed testicular cancer and the spermatic cord had to be pulled down and fully removed. I asked for them not to be left in but she said it was policy or something.

Well my sex drive went down before my orchi. Once my T was suppressed it was gone. But that’s because my E was not tuned right.
</p>
<p>
After my orchi I took the time to really focus on getting my E in check. I tried multiple different methods of administration, and finally found that patches worked the best for me. I’m currently on 3 patches every 3 days and my levels are between 180 and 250 pg/ml, and my T (without supplementing) is at ~15 ng/dl. And I have a consistent libido.
</p>
<p>
I literally just woke up this morning and started masturbating a little before I opened my phone and saw this. It’s been much better. I’m usually horny everyday.
</p>
<p>
Also I haven’t started progesterone yet. And I plan to later this year.

Wow that’s amazing!!! Sounds like a improvement then! Thank u for the response, I’m seriously on the fence even tho I want it badly, blockers kill me brain with fog…and Sorry for interrupting your daily masturbating tho! Continue…. 🤣 and lastly, do u always have to climax or do u just do it sometimes without needing to finish?

I actually usually don’t orgasm. But I think that’s just personal preference. I enjoy edging. Sometimes I feel so good from just masturbating I don’t feel like I need to orgasm. But that’s when they are feeling more full body. I’m still struggling to have a full body orgasm actually complete itself, so I usually opt to not have a normal penile one so that I can masturbate again that day and enjoy myself. I also often masturbate just by rubbing my nipples, they are super sensitive and if I know I’m not planning on having an orgasm then I sometimes don’t even touch my genitals.

Yeah I totally get it. I orgasm maybe 10% of the time. Maybe I climax like 1-2 times a month I guess. I agree I have more arogenous areas that feel better then my penis now, and I don’t have to orgasm either anymore it’s crazy but true. So I try to masturbate daily too. But ya 1 or 2 orgasm I’d say a month if I’m lucky.

What does your surgeon say about it, and would you mind saying who it was?
