Got a few questions for sure:
<br>
-Definitely interested in how the experience was in the hospital, will be going there for the same surgery during May.
</p>
<p>
-Regarding the &#34;have gotten stitched up if I had caught it sooner&#34; comment, did Dr.Ramineni give instructions that if it reaches a certain degree you should go back to restich the area? It definitely looks quite scary but it is good to see the body is able to fix itself pretty decently. Did you move a lot during the first few weeks?
</p>
<p>
-What are you doing to avoid infections in general?
</p>
<p>
-I assume you remain in contact with Dr.Ramineni, what did he say in general about this healing process? And did you stay around for the first month for him to check the healing progress?

Sure thing!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;ll be able to answer this more fully in a bigger post, which I might be able to write up later today when I&#39;m at a keyboard. The sort of TLDR is that people seem to have amazing experiences with GWU overall, but I had one day shift nurse for 2 days that seemed incredibly neglectful and often came too late with my pain medication. I had amazing night nurses though.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
He didn&#39;t give specific instructions ahead of time, but at a certain point in our back and forth emails, he told me that it would heal fine on its own, but if I had been local, he would have had me come in for some extra stitches. (I&#39;m up in New England, so traveling back down to DC for stitches when it can still heal fine, just slower, is a bit silly). A friend of my mother&#39;s is an OBGYN and she offered to put stitches in herself, but by the point we set that up, the healing had already started and the stitches wouldn&#39;t have helped. All in all, it&#39;ll heal all by itself and might just take a little longer - until then, I&#39;m slathering it in bacitracin after dilation and cleaning!
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I didn&#39;t do a lot of moving, no. Just a couple of little walks to keep energy up and avoid bed sores and such. I did fly back up to New England after a week and a half, but it sounds like most dehiscences just
<em>
happen
</em>
as part of healing. Everyone heals differently after all and it seems that this was just gonna be part of my healing journey!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
For infections, I&#39;m keeping bacitracin as part of my dilation routine and putting it on the dehisced areas after dilation and cleaning. I also am changing maxi pads regularly to make sure I&#39;m not &#34;sitting in&#34; any discharge. Every time I shower (~2 days, sensitive skin) I douche with water and unscented Dr. Bronners to help keep things clean in the canal. I
<em>
probably
</em>
got the UTI from when I accidentally put the douche nozzle into my urethra one time - everything is numb down there and it&#39;s hard to feel where things are going sometimes. So... I avoid doing that too! Lol
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dr. Ramineni and his team are absolutely WONDERFUL at communicating quickly, especially the doctor himself. I&#39;ve been trying not to bug him too much (social anxiety ftw), but I&#39;ve been sending pictures and describing issues or updates over the weeks. In fact, almost all the pictures above were partially taken to send to him. The latest email from him this morning even is that things are healing well, though there might be some granulation tissue there (this i suspected...)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I stayed in the area for about a week and a half with family local to DC. That let me have two followup appointments with him - the first was where packing was removed and dilation demonstrated, the second was more a &#34;how is everything&#34; checkin. I&#39;m consultation, he told me that most out of town patients stick around about a week, which he understands, but he also would prefer 2 weeks, so I tried to accommodate that as best I could.
</p>
<p>
I hope this all helps!

Thanks a lot for the info, regarding the sensation down there, is it back or is it still quite numb? How long did it take to get most of the sensation down there?
</p>
<p>
And how frequently do you douche? after every dilation or more often?

Everything is still quite numb for the most part, and from what I understand it will take quite some time for it all to come back online... At least a few months. My clitoris has been sensate pretty much the whole time, but those nerve bundles were preserved for sensation specifically.
</p>
<p>
I usually douche when I shower, which right now is every other day or so.

Amazing work, see you had some dehiscence which can happen but your body is healing it back amazingly! Cant wait to hear more of your healing process! How long does it take you to get to your entire depth during dilation session?

Thanks for the extra reminder! I was worried it got buried in there, haha!
</p>
<p>
I won&#39;t lie, it&#39;s been a mental journey‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and it&#39;s not been too easy. The dehiscence bothered me a lot and once that visibly started healing, I was hit with the UTI, so it&#39;s felt like one thing after the other. I was also dealing with low hormone levels until very recently thanks to a miscommunication glitch in my provider&#39;s messaging system. Now that I&#39;ve upped my dose of testosterone, I feel WAY better.
</p>
<p>
Dilation seems to take about an hour, when you include the prep, cleanup, and getting to depth. Depending on how impatient I am, I can get to depth very quickly using pelvic floor muscle relaxing techniques or I can take my time a bit and let pressure and time do the work. I&#39;d say just about 5 minutes if I&#39;m taking the slow way - a little longer for the blue (and I usually have to do some breathing and kegels to finish getting that to depth anyway!)

<p>
Regarding this, how soon after the surgery can you go on testosterone to avoid extremely low hormone effects? Did you notice any of those effects after a specific week?
</p>
<p>
Since you started weeks after the surgery due to that delay, I guess you went directly to injections?

So there&#39;s actually no issue with starting testosterone even the day after surgery (depending on your delivery method, ofc). The biggest problem for me was that I had my prescription already filled and would have needed to register it with the hospital for the nurses to administer. I decided it would be easier to start on my own after discharge. My surgery was on a Tuesday and I started testosterone on the Saturday after.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m actually on a testosterone gel pump daily! The doctor handling my hormones (not my PCP, not an endo, it&#39;s complicated, lol) started me on a standard 2 pump dose. It was hard to tell the difference between being tired post-op and being tired from low testosterone, but I was having pretty bad hot flashes at night. My PCP ordered my T levels checked and I came in quite low. There was some miscommunication with the NP doing my T and she only recently upped me to 3 pumps per day rather than 2! Huge difference already!

Do you happen to have the numbers for testosterone levels? How low where they exactly when you felt really tired post op.
</p>
<p>
Mainly cuz I am on the low end naturally based
<em>
(8.5 when norm is 10-35 nmol/l)
</em>
on previous test but dont rly feel any negative effects, so was it way lower than that or just a bit below the norm.
</p>
<p>
I guess it depends on what your pre op levels where if a sudden change was seen, but still curious about the levels.

Pre-op, my testosterone was 280-380 ng/dL (normal range of 250-1100 ng/dl). When I had my last test done post-op, it was 119 ng/dL, so definitely lower than I&#39;m used to.

<p>
Hey, regarding this, do you know when you need to register it and how?
</p>
<p>
Mainly because since I will be flying from Australia, i cant get testosterone in the US so I will be carrying a reandron 1000 injection with me along with my Australian doctor&#39;s prescription and it would be rly convenient if they could administer it sometime before I leave the hospital.

Hi there! Sorry for the delayed response, but I deleted Reddit off my phone. The feed was getting to be too much to deal with...
</p>
<p>
But specifically to your question - I&#39;d check with the hospital on all this! Through Ramineni&#39;s office, I was advised to call and pre-register with the hospital. This included setting up a phone appointment with a nurse to go over my medical history, including current medications. I imagine that the nursing staff would be the best to reach out to on this one!
</p>
<p>
Because Testosterone is a controlled substance in the US, I&#39;d be extra wary of traveling with the Reandron 1000 (1000mg/4mL). Our equivalent here in the States - Aveed - is a 750mg/3mL shot because I
<em>
believe
</em>
(don&#39;t quote me) any higher amount would cause legal problems for administering. That&#39;s not to say that you wouldn&#39;t be able to get it administered in the hospital or that it would be taken from you at customs, but it&#39;s a concern I&#39;d be aware of is all. The hospital staff might be able to help with all that!
</p>
<p>
The final part of my response would be that having low testosterone kinda sucks, but it&#39;s doable for a while. When I last posted, I had just upped my gel dosage, but I can now say that it didn&#39;t work and my levels actually dropped further through January. I didn&#39;t get some relief until about halfway through Jan, which was just about 3 months post-op.
</p>
<p>
So I wouldn&#39;t wait that long, but if you absolutely
<em>
have
</em>
to because of regulations or whatnot, you should be okay waiting a few weeks! Just take lots of naps! (Which is good for healing too!)

Yeah reandron is the type that requires a nurse to administer since it is only every 10-12 weeks, hence why i was asking, the doctor letter also includes that so I cant imagine there&#39;s an issue, I am more concerned about getting a syringe along with it so the hospital doesnt charge like 1000$ for it cuz im not American with insurance, US medical bills do have a bad rep lol.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Something else I kept forgetting to ask, once you wake up after the surgery, can you move your lower body/legs normally or does anesthesia affect that for a while until epidural is gone?

I found your other thread from a few days ago about traveling with the Reandron and want to echo one of the people there: to just be cautious about the testosterone prescription. You&#39;re bringing a controlled substance in through customs with amounts larger than what can legally be prescribed here in the United States. Prescriptions and doctors&#39; letters can only go so far, so I would just make sure by calling GWU hospital, Dr. R, and possibly even the DEA to make sure you won&#39;t have problems.
</p>
<p>
I could be being overly cautious and it wouldn&#39;t be a problem, but most who travel with testosterone aren&#39;t carrying amounts like you are (since most patients on undecanoate travel between doses and those who travel with testosterone tend to bring testosterone ethanate for weekly or biweekly self-injection). Best case scenario is that customs and the DEA have no issue and let you through. Less fun could be that they confiscate it. Worst case scenario is that they confiscate it and charge you with trafficking, which carries up to a 10 year prison sentence and/or $500,000 fine. Point being: just make sure you
<em>
know
</em>
before you get here and have to find out.
</p>
<p>
Needles in the US are not expensive, even without insurance. The hospital may upcharge you, but since you don&#39;t have an insurance company to negotiate prices for you, you can usually challenge the bill yourself. There&#39;s also a possibility that the nurses may refuse to use an outside needle - only way to know is to ask.
</p>
<p>
You can move your legs normally, but it is difficult. You&#39;ll be lying still for most of your time in the hospital anyway, but move only as you feel comfortable and keep in mind that you have a tube coming out of your lower back.

I&#39;m in a similar boat rn. The major difference is my hematoma remained mostly inside keeping the stitching together so far but causing extreme pain internally and essentially no ability to dilate anymore.

You are still very early on your healing journey and you will likely see a lot of healing over the next 2 months (it gets considerably slower after that - for me anyway).

This is true! It seems there a little plateau at about 3-4 weeks for a lot of people (myself included) and then again after the first 2 months or so. I&#39;m mostly just looking forward to having more of my life back, at this point! Even being able to sit in my computer chair to play games would be nice! Lol

Having done this the last few weeks, even if sometimes by accident, I can honestly it makes a huge difference mentally, you&#39;re right! I was so freaked out with the dehiscence at first, but a week later being able to see how much it has started healing was kinda huge.

Congrats. I hope for the best for you. I know for me the surgery has been a lot of energy but also a great mental relief.

Thank you! It has been for me too. I&#39;m very ready for my life to get back to &#39;normal,&#39; but it&#39;s already so noticeable how quiet my mind is for the first time in a long time &lt;3
</p>
<p>
Congrats on your surgery as well and hopefully your recovery continues to be smooth!

Yeah. Thanks. I did underestimate how long healing takes. I am now at 5 moths now but I&#39;m far from fully healed and doing really hard work for the first time since before my surgery so take it easy please.

Congrats!!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü§ó So happy for you, sorry the post journey has been so tough, but you&#39;re absolutely kicking ass!!!
</p>
<p>
It does look a lot better than it did week 3 that&#39;s for sure üòÖ
</p>
<p>
I was and sometimes still am crying over here regarding my dehiscence but comparatively it looks like I got off easy, it&#39;s just taking forever to fully close up ughhhh
</p>
<p>
Keep at it!
</p>
<p>
Also for granulated tissue, silver nitrate! Try to have a professional administer if possible.

Thank you!
</p>
<p>
Dehisences definitely take time, but I&#39;ve been repeatedly reassured by lots of people (my surgeon, my gynecologist [ha, that&#39;s euphoric to say...], and other postop friends) that they
<em>
will
</em>
heal and be okay. It&#39;s hardest to see when you&#39;re dealing with it, but I&#39;m holding out hope!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve thrown my PCP and email and reached out to my gynecologist friend as well. I&#39;m still staying with my parents, so trips to my PCP are quite long. Until I&#39;m back to driving/living on my own, I&#39;m trying to limit the number of times we have to drive down there (which is already once a week for allergy shots!)
</p>
<p>
Best of luck with your continued healing as well! :)

Your clitoris looks as if the stitching has come undone and it has blown out and left an empty cavity beneath it, especially in the last picture. What has your surgeon said about that? I&#39;m not criticising, just I&#39;d be worrying in your position and if it needs sorting then it needs to be addressed very soon.

I was told that the clitoris will shrink as swelling continues to go down. Since I specifically asked to make it larger, I&#39;m not too concerned yet. When I gently clean it or run ointment on it, it still feels pretty attached! I&#39;ve sent him all the pictures you see here and he doesn&#39;t seem concerned by it at all.

Unfortunately, you can&#39;t edit the title without deleting the post. Sorry about that, but it is also a very common complication and it is mentioned in the post itself. Looking at less than a few months post-op pictures, you&#39;ll be bound to see them.

I have a consultation in 13 days with him, do you know if you need hair removal first, wondering if I‚Äôll need to wait that extra year?

He does not require hair removal, since he uses a scrape and cauterize method during surgery. I&#39;ve not had any issues so far, and many of his patients dating back a few years don&#39;t report any issues either. Several other of his patients did recommend to me some laser or electrolysis ahead of time, especially as the hair can grow very close to the clitoris. But so far I&#39;m not finding that to be too much of an issue myself.
</p>
<p>
He will say that he doesn&#39;t require it, but some of his patients do it anyway! It&#39;s completely up to you!

Cool, probably won‚Äôt as I‚Äôm a lesbian and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôd it get that much in the way. Sadly I‚Äôm gonna have to wait at least a year (probably year and a half) as I forgot to factor in the hotel costs to the total. (4 weeks is a lot in dc!)

He/ him but went for SRS?? Why?

Also I hope the infection is getting better &amp; youre getting the help needed to heal!

<p>
SRS is not limited to transwomen, even the wpath 8 finally acknowledged that.
<br>
Genital dysphoria can exist without gender dysphoria, and Ramineni is know to have done the surgery on a lot of non binary and/or male presenting individuals who go on testosterone after.
</p>
<p>
Gonna include myself since I ve already scheduled the surgery with him coming May while gonna remain male and take testosterone post op.

I think it is quite rare in general, though US surgeons are a lot more updated on such matters, in Thailand most still follow outdated wpath 7 standards and require a year of hormones which isnt needed in this case, plus awfully low bmi requirements when Ramineni doesnt have any.
