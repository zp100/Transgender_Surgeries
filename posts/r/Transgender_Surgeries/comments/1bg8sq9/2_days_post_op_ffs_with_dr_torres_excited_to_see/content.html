Torres speaks English well, and so does the assistant at the office, Ive been using Google translate a lot to communicate with the nurses post op which has worked fine, I do recommend learning basic Spanish though I wish I had spent a bit of time learning more of the language haha.
</p>
<p>
I met up with 3 other girls who also got ffs here, we made an in depth video about the process.
</p>
<p>
I will be posting updates about all of it on this channel!

Wow this channel is really cool! I&#39;ll follow! You have quite similar face to me as well, so curious how it goes, rooting for you!
</p>
<p>
Does Torres do/accept CT Scans? I see it in your video, but I heard he doesn&#39;t, and it was one of my major gripes. If he does do/evaluate them, that&#39;s a huge plus for me!

Thanks! And yeah he does accept CT scans, others who&#39;ve gone to him have also had CT scans and their FFS planned using the scans, you do have to get them done in your country prior to surgery through, and then you can send him the files, afterwords he can plan the surgery, like in my videos you can see us discuss the procedures based on my scan.
</p>
<p>
I actually also gave him the 3D printed model of my skull from that scan when I arrived, he said it was incredibly useful for planning.
