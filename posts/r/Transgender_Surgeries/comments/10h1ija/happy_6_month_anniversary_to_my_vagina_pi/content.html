x2 on the Wow!  I’ve been looking at a LOT of vulvas lately in my search for reference photos to provide my surgeon, and I can say without reservation that you’ve achieved basically cis identical aesthetics. Congratulations!  How is everything else?  Oh! And thank you for posting video. It was somehow very helpful and more informative than stills.

Thank you so much!  I couldn&#39;t be happier with my results! I&#39;ve got about 7-8 inches of depth (depending on how you measure), I&#39;m able to have clitoral and vaginal orgasms, including really intense squirting vaginal orgasms, I&#39;m self-lubricating (up to a point), and everything
<em>
feels
</em>
&#34;right&#34;, inside and out.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, I prefer video because I think it&#39;s more honest/accurate about how the anatomy looks and feels and moves. I&#39;m glad you appreciate it!

This gives me sooooo much hope! I haven&#39;t seen many results online from that team and they&#39;re the ones who are going to be doing my surgery (hopefully this year!!) I was a bit cautious after an issue with my orchiectomy but your results are great. I&#39;ve been super happy with Kaiser overall. How was the experience during the week in the hospital??

I had my orchi with them in 2020, and it went very well, so ymmv, but I was really happy with how they handled recovery and the hospital stay in general. I don&#39;t live close to the hospital, so my wife and I got an Airbnb within 20 minutes of the hospital to stay in while I recovered for the first week. Immediately following surgery I spent two nights in the hospital, but was sent home on day three to recover for the rest of the week. At that point I still had surgical drains and a catheter, compression bandages, packing, and some temporary sutures that were holding my outer labia closed. On day 6 I went back to the gender clinic at Kaiser, and had those sutures removed, and the dressings, packing, catheter and drains removed. They also had me do my first dilation there. I was actually really surprised at how well it all went!

I had my orchi with them in 2020 as well! I was told the stay in the hospital lasts a week immediately after surgery, so it&#39;s interesting they discharged you sooner than that. Did they give you a reason? And how&#39;s the recovery been overall?

Yeah, they changed their policy during the pandemic. They needed the extra hospital beds, so they started discharging patients to recover at home for the first week. And they discovered that the patients really liked it, and were healing faster and better. Which makes sense: better food and better sleep than what you can get in the hospital means better healing outcomes. So they just made that the standard practice moving forward.

Interesting, I can understand that. Though I was looking forward to being monitored by health professionals during the first week since that&#39;s the most difficult time. And I live far from LA too so I&#39;d have to work out staying nearby, probably at an AirBNB as well. I&#39;ll reach out to them and discuss my options. I&#39;m glad the whole process has gone pretty smoothly for you!

Overall, recovery has been both easier and harder than I expected. I was prepared for things to be swollen and bloody and messy for a while, and so I was astonished at how clean everything looked, even at the start. I didn&#39;t have any complications aside from a small amount of granulation tissue inside the vagina that they cleaned up with a few drops of silver nitrate at a post-op appointment. I pushed myself pretty aggressively with the dilation, and overdid it, backslid, and had to learn to listen to my body as it healed. I think the hardest part was that it took about a month longer than I&#39;d expected to feel like my energy was back, and about the same amount of time to begin sitting upright comfortably. I&#39;d anticipated 12 weeks of recovery, and it was closer to 16 before I felt like I was coming out of the main recovery period. But, at 6 months I feel like I can do pretty much everything I could do before, except pee standing up. And I absolutely LOVE having a vagina! Clothes fit better, sex is better, orgasms are better, my overall dysphoria levels have dropped significantly... it&#39;s amazing!

Congratulations! I have heard from other women who have had theirs done by this team that this result is similar to theirs....in particular the clit construction is Dr. Poh&#39;s signature.

Wow, that looks amazing!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m tempted to consider going that route now, especially since I&#39;m going to be switching to Kaiser soon (April). But I was leaning toward PPV over PI.
</p>
<p>
PI depth is pretty dependent on whatever length you had before, right? 7 to 8 inches of depth would be amazing, but it sounds like not everyone can get that with PI.

<p>
There are a few factors that impact depth: genital length is not a huge factor, because the scrotal skin graft more than makes up for it. The bigger factor is how much pelvic space you have, which is harder to visualize.
</p>
<p>
Dr Poh&#39;s team has recently started doing PPT vaginoplasties in addition to PI.  It wasn&#39;t an option for me 6 months ago, but it is now.

I assume you mean your partner&#39;s dick? My sense is that length isn&#39;t a major problem...once they bottom out, they stop, and you will
<em>
both
</em>
know when they do... just take it slow untill you both get a feel for it.  The one pre op partner I&#39;ve been with since surgery isn&#39;t big enough to raise these concerns, but I also slept with my other girlfriend who is also  post-op, and the strap-on we used on each other was definitely longer than either of us could fully accommodate, and it didn&#39;t pose a problem.

Thank you for answering. I&#39;m in an open relationship and I like big D&#39;s so I am kinda hesitant about it what if it&#39;s bigger than what&#39;s expected will it wreck my black pink pussy or not? Hahaha. Yours are actually good it seems like it&#39;s made in Thailand from the way it&#39;s actually done as it&#39;s great. I have friends who had theirs done in Thailand

A year ago I was to go and see Dr. Poh at a Kaiser (LA) but my flight over never happened coming from Hawai’i . I had a vulvoplasty done on October 2019, just shy of the Covid pandemic starting. An with not knowing how my life would be afterwards with work and dilation daily, dilating at work was not an option for me.

Now I have more time to start/continue to do my would be dilations as my work place is doing much better now during the pandemic.
