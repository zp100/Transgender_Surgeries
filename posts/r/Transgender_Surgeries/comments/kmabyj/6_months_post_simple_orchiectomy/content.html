Have just gotten my bloods back for my first test post orchiectomy in late may. The only med change is I stopped taking cyproterone and between tests I had changed to 200mcg/24hr patches over 100‚Äôs after the prior blood test.
</p>
<p>
One year Prior to orchie I was at
</p>
<p>
0.7 nmol /L
</p>
<p>
&lt;60 pmol/L 17b estradiol (100mcg/24hr patch)
</p>
<p>
Now sitting at
</p>
<p>
0.7 nmol/L testosterone
</p>
<p>
1465 pmol/L 17b estradiol
</p>
<p>
Will be dropping patch dose and checking levels. My doctors didn‚Äôt want to take unnecessary blood tests as we had just come out of lockdown prior to my orchie so Taking reference levels the week prior was deemed unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
Physically all is well , did not opt for a scrotectomy so healing was fast and the only scarring is very slight from the stitches along the mid raphe.

I&#39;m in a similar boat, interesting to see how with the same dosages our bodies still react differently/show different blood levels. Is that 200mcg patch one you change twice weekly?

Hmm. Just for reference, with the same exact dosage (200mcg twice weekly) and route of administration (plus I&#39;m a couple months post-orchie as well) my levels were:
</p>
<p>
0,3 nmol/L for T 670 pmol/L for E2
</p>
<p>
I lowered E2 to 175mcg recently bc it made me sleep like shit tho. Bodies are weird ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Right? I am concerned that it may be high because it was on a patch- swap day after I applied the new one that morning so I may be able to justify a new test to confirm before messing with doses just yet.

It&#39;s pretty high, but I notice a lot of trans femmes use dosages to attain levels in that range. The first and foremost question is how you feel with these levels, physically/emotionally?
