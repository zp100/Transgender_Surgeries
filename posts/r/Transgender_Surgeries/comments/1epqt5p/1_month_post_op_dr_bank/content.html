Girl, your result is excellent, could I ask you some questions about your experience with Dr. Bank, please?

Here are my questions: What made you choose Dr. Bank over other doctors? What made you choose the Suporn technique over other techniques? (PI, PI with scrotal graft, peritoneum, jejunum, ileum, sigmoid colon, etc.), How were you able to get a date with the Suporn Clinic? How has your recovery been so far? Do you recommend Dr. Bank? How do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Did you ask for any specific type of aesthetic? How is he open to requests about aesthetics? Did you have circumcision or not? How is your vaginal depth currently? What was the dilation process like currently? Are you planning to have revision surgery? And if you haven&#39;t undergone one, what would improve your result with one? How was your stay in Thailand (Chon Buri)? What was the post-operative care like from Dr. Bank and the clinic staff in general? And by the way, congratulations on the surgery

Thankyou for your questions, so I’ll start off on why I chose him. I think his results seem to be very consistent and he likes to innovate his procedures with new techniques such as the tunica graft. He’s extremely driven towards researching and making his surgical technique better. The hospital is very clean and modern, and the nurses will continue to see you every morning after surgery until you leave. The clinic is highly regarded with a lot of reputation, and I can’t go without mentioning the hotel and the other patients you will meet there! It’s honestly the best trans space I’ve ever been to:) 2: Regarding to the scrotal graft technique, I think it’s less invasive than say a colon or peritoneal graft because it uses the testicular tissue/tunica vaginalis as the self lubrication method which would have been discarded anyway. Another perk of the technique is the Chonburi organ, which basically acts as another g spot in case the clitoris isn’t enough, however my clitoris is completely intact so that isn’t a worry. 3: I got my date first try! I don’t know how but I did? 4: I would recommend him, only if you are willing to travel that far and keep up with the dilation schedule though! 5: I think the cosmetics are very good, it’s still swollen so it may completely change in a couple months as for the labia minora which looks to be shrinking. It’s more of an improvement than his last technique due to the joining of the labia minora at the bottom, so it feels more enclosed and anatomically correct. Sensitivity is very much there, unfortunately I can’t have any sexy thoughts yet but oh my I could if I wanted to 😂6: I am not circumcised 7: My depth is sitting at 15cm (6 inches) 8: The dilation process is very rigorous, it requires you to dilate 3 times a day for 3 months, but after that it’s 2 times, then after 6 months it’s only once a day. It’s quite hard to get a normal sleep pattern due to having to wake up very tired after a short nap to then dilate again lol. I don’t expect to have a social life until it goes down to once or twice a day. There’s little pain when dilating but it didn’t really hurt to dilate at any point since surgery. 9: I will probably consider cosmetic revision due to a tiny bit of dog ear/raised stitch line at the top of the left labia majora and a tiny bit of separation at the bottom of the minora but that’s it really. It could look quite different in a few months so I’ll see how it plays out! 10: Id probably go back for a revision just because Chonburi was such a lovely experience! 😂 I mean it’s not quite Bangkok but there’s still lots to do and the other patients are lovely:) Patients usually spend every morning having breakfast with each other and dinner in the evening in the restaurant. It’s very hot and humid though so be prepared to wear elephant pants! Luckily the hotel and clinic has AC tho😁 The aftercare from Dr Bank is very good, if he spots any separation he will book you in the next day at the clinic for stitches to fix it. It is under local anaesthesia as he has a separate room upstairs for this very thing which is cool. The staff speak pretty good English and understand you quite well, they will check up on you and contact you through the LINE app for any concerns whilst there. Up until the moment you leave, you will be actively cared for! I know this is a bit long but just wanted to give you a good insight into it!

Looks absolutely amazing and your description of no pain dilating sounds incredible! Do you mind sharing roughly what the cost was? And the wait time from applying to confirming your date to surgery?

Thankyou! The cost was just over $14,000 for the surgery, $2,000 for a suite in the hotel and $900 for the flight tickets. So the total was roughly $16,900 but you could save a lot on the hotel but I went with my partner so I needed the double bed and a bit more room! The wait time is roughly just over a year from getting the date to surgery. I got my confirmation in may and got the surgery the next year in July, so 14 months between:)

Do they keep in touch after you fly back to check if there’s any issues and stuff?

Yeah, you can always email them, send images and they will recommend what to do. If there are any problems, it can usually be solved by a local doctor, if not or you plan on getting something cosmetically revised, you can fly back and Dr Bank will do a revision or fix your problem free of charge. However, the transport is not free and I heard the hospital fee may incur if it cannot be done in the clinic.

Thankyou! Over time it will look a lot different due to swelling and it can take at least a 3-9 months to get an idea of the final result:)

I do think that by joining the labia minora at the bottom, it does look more appealing. Or maybe it’s the fact that the penile skin wrinkles up to form the minora? I don’t really know lol. There are plenty of surgeons that do techniques differently but achieve realistic results like Littleton, min jun and bluebond though.

I&#39;m very surprised you have this kind of bush this early on. I thought you had to fully shave and they remove the hair during the surgery. This is pretty much my ideal look and I&#39;m very excited to see it&#39;s possible!

Maybe a Thailand surgeon can help? You have a sigmoid colon revision and aesthetic touch up for maybe £8000. The issue will be of course sensitivity will not come back. But it&#39;s still possible.

It’s pretty good tbh, you can keep pressing the morphine button after surgery or you can get the spinal block anaesthesia and you’re pretty much numb from the waist down for a while. The meds are tramadol and codeine for the weeks post op which seems to be sufficient:)

For Dr Bank, he scrapes the hair follicles off whilst in surgery so laser is not required. But it depends on the technique so I would ask your surgeon:)

If I didn&#39;t know any better I would truly believe you were born this way. Your surgeon did an absolutely amazing job. Best of luck during recovery.

Thankyouuu! Oh yes she is very sensitive! The Chonburi organ located above the entrance of the canal definitely adds more sensitivity 🩷

Also l, glad I’m seeing more post op results with people keeping their bush down there. I think it shows the results more realistically, at least for me.

Looks great! Congratulations!

If you are up for sharing, I am curious, how many times did you apply to the Suporn lottery before receiving a surgery date. I have tried three times with no luck and am just trying to get an idea of how long it has taken for others. Thanks much.

1 month? Dang! I&#39;m almost 6 weeks post op and I still don&#39;t look that good. Granted, I barely have labia minora, so it looks kinda awkward right now.
</p>
<p>
Seriously, I think this is fantastic as far as recovery progression goes. Thank you for sharing!

Thankyou! I think I’m fairly mobile, can walk around without pain for about 20 minutes before the pain sets in, but sitting down is pretty much pain free on the donut cushion now:)

Hey your result looks good!
</p>
<p>
Just wondering about scarring?
</p>
<p>
Do you have much? It is hard to see as I think possibly hidden under pubic hair?
