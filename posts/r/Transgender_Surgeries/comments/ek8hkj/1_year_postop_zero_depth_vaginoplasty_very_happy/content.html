Hi, since there isn&#39;t much info about this surgery I will describe my experience with it for those who want to know about it. Sorry if it&#39;s inappropriate to talk about it here.
</p>
<p>
I had GCS in November 18&#39; with Pierre Brassard at GRS Montréal. I recovered at centre Asclepiade.
</p>
<p>
I asked for a zero depth version because I was not really all that interested in vaginal penetration to begin with. I&#39;m bisexual. Didn&#39;t want to dilate. Wanted an easier recovery. Was scared to heal poorly.
</p>
<p>
My surgery took 90 minutes and was performed under general anesthesia.  I was up and walking the next morning.  I stayed in the hospital for 2 nights postoperatively and stayed at Asclepiade for 5 more nights.  The nurses were kind and helpful at Asclepiade.  Brassard was open and honest about the possible risks. He came over more like a businessman than like a surgeon working with human beings which I personally didn&#39;t like but he is very skilled so I took it as it was.
</p>
<p>
My pain level on a 1-10 scale was 2-3 for the first week and under 2 after the first week. By week 3 I didn&#39;t need my donut pillow anymore.  By week 4 I could drive long distances without having to stop every 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>
By week 10 I had my first full on orgasm with my new bits.
</p>
<p>
The surgery itself went without complications. They created a clitoris from the most sensitive part of the glans , a clitoral hood, labia minora with inner coating from leftovers from urethral tissue.  Labia majora were created with scrotal skin.  He created an indent of 1 inch in depth to give the impression that there is a vaginal opening.  The urethra was shortened and rerouted.
</p>
<p>
I recovered seemingly a lot quicker than the other girls at Asclepiade.
</p>
<p>
By week 5 I was back to swimming and by week 6 I was back to working full time.
</p>
<p>
My results look very natural now a year later.  It took 6 months before everything was healed in its final form.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in a relationship with a man currently. He was surprised how natural everything looks when he first got to see it.
</p>
<p>
I can wear what I want without being afraid of a bulge showing, I can undress without worrying etc.
</p>
<p>
10/10 would do it again. Still glad I didn&#39;t go with the full depth version. I just don&#39;t miss the depth. For me this surgery was perfect.
</p>
<p>
As far as insurance matters, my insurance paid everything.  They were billed 22000 Dollars Canadiens. This included my stay at Asclepiade, meals, the surgery, anesthesia, aftercare.
</p>
<p>
Any other questions?
</p>

If you don&#39;t mind me asking. How&#39;s your sexual relationship with men specifically your current BF? Like do you just rely on anal/oral since there&#39;s no vaginal cavity? If so does it feel the same since there&#39;s no vaginal cavity in the way? I often wonder how men would react to the fact that there&#39;s no vagina to penetrate but I suppose there&#39;s cis-women with those problems too.

I&#39;m bisexual. I have had more relationships with men than with women. My experience is that men won&#39;t be turned off. You still get outer genitalia that resemble those of a cis woman. There is a 1 inch opening. You have sensitive labia and a clitoris. My boyfriend goes down on me, I go down on him and he penetrates me anally or plays with my breasts. Sex is so much more than just PIV. If he likes you, you both can make it work despite having a zero depth SRS. Hope that answers your questions.

Hi, I have a 1 inch indent where the vagina would be. I can fit a finger tip up there. I also have a sensitive clitoris and sensitive labia. You definitely can have a lot of erogenous pleasure, even without the deep cavity. I for one am glad with my speedy recovery and minimal disruption that this surgery brought. I also am happy to not dilate. I have a busy life schedule. Hope that takes away some of your concerns.

That&#39;s wonderful! I want this myself haha
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not interested in penetration whatsoever, so it&#39;s good to hear from someone who has experience with this. Especially hearing that you have good sensitivity!
</p>
<p>
Does it look natural? That&#39;s one of the major things for me, I want to look like a cis girl, even if I don&#39;t have the depth.

It looks exactly the same as the SRS with depth. Brassard uses the same methods for cavity srs and no cavity srs. He just creates a 1 inch indent instead of a deep vagina in patients opting for zero depth SRS.  It looks natural, yes. You wouldn&#39;t be able to tell my genitalia weren&#39;t cis unless you came very close and started to inspect everything. Hope that helps.

Glad I could be of help to girls considering this surgery. Zero depth is an increasing request under GRS surgeons lately. About 10 to 20 percent of patients opt for zero depth GRS.
</p>
<p>
I think it&#39;s still a bit taboo to admit that your vagina doesn&#39;t have a deep cavity. Not many girls are willing to openly admit that they have an indent instead of a deep vagina.
</p>
<p>
We need to be more open about this surgery.  It&#39;s a surgery that comes with quicker recovery and is a great option for girls who don&#39;t need the full depth.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t want to have to dilate.  I&#39;m satisfied with my results.

No, my surgery was with Dr. Thomas in Brighton. All going well and healing nicely so far. Still pretty damn swollen though but only 4 weeks and I&#39;ve always had a tenancy to swell after surgery.

This is great information thank you for sharing. My wife wants this and I habe been trying to get as much information as possible about it.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask what the prep for the surgery was. How in depth was hair removal? Were there any other requirements for prep?
</p>
<p>
Thank you!!

Hi, my surgeon, Dr Brassard, does not require permanent hair removal on the genitalia. He cauterizes the hair follicles during surgery. With zero depth, barely any tissue is inverted so hair removal is optional but no necessity. I didn&#39;t have to drink the bottles of laxatives before surgery, like full depth girls would have to do. Zero depth srs can be done under spinal anesthesia but I opted for general anesthesia. You still need 2 letters from a PhD and a sexologist or psychologist who clears you for surgery. You also need to be on HRT for at least 1 year. Recovery is significantly quicker with zero depth because you don&#39;t have to dilate. My surgery took 90 minutes.  They give you a 1 inch indent instead of a deep vagina.  There is a sensitive clitoris and sensitive labia.. Cosmetically it looks the same as full depth GRS. Hope this helps.

You have to provide 2 letters from a PhD and a sexologist/psychologist. This is still irreversible SRS.  You need to be on HRT for at least 1 year before they will consider you for this surgery.  My surgeon, Brassard, doesn&#39;t require hair removal on the genitalia for SRS procedures. He cauterizes the hair follicles during surgery.

Sorry this is an older post... But I&#39;m specifically wondering how long you stayed in Montreal and how you eventually travelled home and how that was (I live just outside Toronto...)?
</p>
<p>
Also, did you opt to have any hair removal whatsoever before surgery?
</p>
<p>
I hope you are doing well!
