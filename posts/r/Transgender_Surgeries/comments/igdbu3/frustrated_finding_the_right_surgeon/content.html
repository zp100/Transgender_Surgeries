I am planning to have my surgery done properly in Thailand because of both my budget and the results they offer, but I am running into a super difficult situation, I love the result of dr. Thiti, and I read a paper regarding the peritoneal option with him as one of the author, however I am having difficulties reaching out to him, I’ve contacted my local intermediates about the surgery but they said Dr. Thiti  is facing a bottleneck thus he properly won’t be providing peritoneal SRS at the moment, I tried to ask the agent to reach out to dr. Thiti to see if by any chance he will perform the operation as I really want to take the peritoneal option, they just stop replying to my email at all....
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried to reach out via other channels, like through the hospital he is stationing at with no avail, not even a single reply saying yes or no, I don’t even know if the surgeon receives my email...
</p>
<p>
I’ve read kamol provides peritoneal pull thru as one of the option, but to my research, his result varies and doesn’t look like what I prefer.
</p>
<p>
I am loosing hope, I don’t know what I can do next, I’ve thought about taking revision surgery afterwards but I don’t know if I can afford two separate surgeries, it’s not cheap even doing it once. Why is it so difficult finding a surgeon who can satisfy both... :..(

Now is a difficult time for anyone at the planning stage of seeking their gender confirmation surgery. Due to the pandemic, certainly in Thailand due to their indefinite quarantine, all reputable surgeons have a significant backlog of previously booked patients who have had their surgeries delayed.
</p>
<p>
Clinics aren&#39;t even able to offer times and options for these already existing clients, and so are not really in a position to be taking on new patients and inquiries.
</p>
<p>
Definitely an understandably frustrating position; if GCS is an urgent need for you, I recommend restricting your search to regions which are not under quarantine as you would be at the back of the queue upon any re-opening of medical tourism to Thailand.

It is indeed, thought I am not planning to leave for surgery right away, but it’s a big decision that I want to plan ahead so everything can be done the way I choose to, finding a surgeon who does or did peritoneal vaginoplasty within my budget is hard enough, US based doctors are ridiculously expensive without insurance, but the reputable surgeons in Thailand tend not to try new methods to avoid ruining their record. It is about as frustrating as it can be and the whole pandemic thing is just adding on top of that.

Haha, I think it happens to many of us, when I was young I always think technology will advance and surgery option will get better, but after two decades, I am in my 30s still not much advance have been made so I am feeling like it’s now or never 😂😂

Can’t beat the Thai’s result, I just hope Suporn and his fellowships or other reputable Thai surgeons can provide the peritoneal option.
</p>
<p>
I remember reading it in a post the total cost of having the procedure done by Dr. Heidi Wittenberg adds up to 240k without insurance

Suporn invented his technique 20 years ago and let alone the standard penile inversion has been around forever, Ironically even the newish option I want to have is nothing new....
<em>
sigh
</em>
I just can’t stand myself still with a penis the time I turn 40, which in my eyes marks the half way point of my life, at least I’ve still got half my years to enjoy living in the right body lol

Where did you see Dr Thiti’s results? I can’t find out much about him.
</p>
<p>
Have a look here

<p>
There’s lots of photos for Thailand surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I suspect if you wait a few years there will be more peritoneal surgeries offered in Thailand.

A friend of mine have had her surgery done by him, she’s been in contact with quite a lot of Thiti’s patients, their results look good to me and is quite consistent, they concluded Suporn produce the best result both aesthetically and sensitivity wise, but with a higher chance of complications and need comparatively more post op care, chettawut is using similar techniques as suporn so should expect similar limitations. Thiti is using his improved version of PI, it is basically a combination of suporn’s technique with PI, the appearance of the openings to the vagina and urethra can be less natural comparing to suporn and Chet, but recovery time is shortened and need less dilations. Kamol uses his own version of PI too, he offers more choices and he provides laparoscopic colon or peritoneal surgery options, but the resulted appearance is less natural.

Do you still want to get surgery? I recommend another experienced doctor, you can try to find out more.

Google translate works really well. Use the chrome browser.

Also look in the wiki here.

Ciaooo cioaoo I am Michela and I am a post op mtf girl of only 15 years and my surgery was performed by Dr Ivan Manero in Barcelona, ​​I had a great time with him and he is truly a magnificent person as well as a great doctor and surgeon , on me the result of the SRS and BA surgery done on the same day is really satisfying and even my mom&#39;s gynecologist who followed me throughout the transition said that my vagina is perfectly identical to that of an organic girl and also its depth and that of a normal girl&#39;s vagina and besides it is really sensitive, I have never experienced such a beautiful feeling as when I made love for the first time with my boyfriend last September, I felt like jolts down my back and then absolutely magnificent orgasm a sensation never felt before, vaginal penetrative sex is the best so don&#39;t believe what you feel, for me Dr Manero was like a father for how he treated me and above all he is not a butcher ...... try to believe ciaoo
