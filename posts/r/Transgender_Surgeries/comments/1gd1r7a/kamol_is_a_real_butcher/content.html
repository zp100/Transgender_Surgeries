Kamol hospital ruined my life completely, is not true that this place is the best for gender reassignment surgery. I had my surgery in June 2023 and I have been botched twice and like me unfortunately there are a lot of girls who are constantly botched but nobody talks about. Kamol claims to perform all the gender reassignment surgery but this is completely false!!! Once you are sleeping in the surgery room under the anestesia there are a lot of young juniors doctors ready to practice with your body because secretly they are paying Kamol to teach them. Stay away from this place if you care for your health. Nobody talks about the fact that Kamol hospital has been repeatedly and consistently reported to the health ministry of Thailand but the law in Thailandia is a complete scam because they always want all the foreigners all around the world to go there and bring money into the country and they donâ€™t care at all if you are botched. Kamol , Madame , Nissa , Vanessa those are simply horrible people ready to destroy people life just for money. Once you paid they donâ€™t have any responsibility , check on Reddit and YouTube because finally people are speaking out the sad and horrible reality about this butcher place . Feel free to contact me to know more and receive the adeguate support with practical and real solutions , support and guidance to make the right choices for a restorative surgery and other types of support around this matter.

I very nearly considered Kamol, if not for the posts on forums like this and experiences of those that had. Dodged a bullet and lined up with Suporn instead

There is a transgirl website in my country that talks about Kamol, it doesn&#39;t say anything good or bad except for the cost and the results (which look good). It made me almost set my sights on that hospital if it wasn&#39;t for the complaints I read about it on Reddit. Even though I still can&#39;t afford the surgery, I&#39;ve eliminated it from my sights. Maybe they advertise it well.

I feel very sorry for you. It is been a while I discovered he is a scam, since a lot of girls started to share their stories and also their photo resultsâ€¦ If you seek a SRS restoration, I can advice you to consult Dr. Burin, from PAI clinic. I can share you my results in private

Dear Bella,
</p>
<p>
First of all, you are doing names of people who actually helped you in an incredible way, even though you were harassing all of us. You were hugging and caressing improperly Nissa during her working hours, you asked to come in the toilet with me and openly said that if I wasn&#39;t married you would have tried to hook up with me.
</p>
<p>
About the owner of the hospital, Madame, she offered you to come anytime to correct the surgery if you didn&#39;t like the outcome of it, we just asked you to wait for one year post-op. You never wanted to do so and threaten to come to the hospital after 3 months from your surgery with a lawyer. We were ok with that, but no surgery till after 1 year. You didn&#39;t come at the end...
</p>
<p>
Why don&#39;t you say the truth to the public and the people who are reading your post? Please tell everyone that you never wanted to stay at K garden, that you were smoking, not only cigarettes, immediately after the surgery, and smoking vape in the hospital room while you were still in bed.
</p>
<p>
It was asked you not to walk too much and we say always the same things over and over again to every patient. Move and walk but not too much.. We then find out you walked from our hospital to Pratunam while you still had your catheter on.
</p>
<p>
Tell also everyone that you had a fight at the hospital with another patient and that we had to stop you and one of our staff got hurt because of you. Also please tell that you had an argument with another patient who was gently sharing the accommodation with you in a close-by serviced apartment.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s not talk about the lies you wrote on the medical assessment form that we requested to have before accepting your case.
</p>
<p>
You are accusing Dr. Kamol of not doing SRS surgeries anymore, but that&#39;s all he does and the only person you met during consultation, and all the follow ups.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least you explicitly said you were happy about the death of our Darcy and this shows the person you are in deep.
</p>
<p>
I always told you not to get too angry, and hoped that one day you could&#39;ve found happiness in your life, but you came here unhappy from previous surgery results and you keep being unhappy about anything that surrounds you. I just wish you can find peace one day.
</p>

Vanessa you are a liar. How about you talk about preventing clients from meeting the doctor after his butcher surgery. In every other country you would face criminal charge and end up in jail.
</p>
<p>
While I was there girls were fleeing to other countries after their first surgeries has they were supposed to have multiple.
</p>
<p>
How about you talk about what you charge to different countries from the same procedure.
</p>
<p>
You know who I am and I know who you are so how about I call you out right here and force you to post my complete medical file will the real before and after and not the altered one?
</p>
<p>
Moderators get her profiles banned. She is a disgrace for the transgender community and a compulsive liar.

<p>
Thank you for this correction!
</p>
<p>
I personally went to Kamol Hospital in January 2024 for my SRS.
</p>
<p>
After my operation, I was amazed at how much people were attacked as soon as they spoke positively about Kamol Hospital.
</p>
<p>
For example, because of my positive statements about Kamol, I was repeatedly accused of having a benefit for my positive opinion of Kamol or that this was the so-called honeymoon effect for me.
</p>
<p>
And no - it was not a honeymoon effect!
</p>
<p>
I am still extremely satisfied with Kamol&#39;s work today!
</p>
<p>
So satisfied and with great trust in Kamol that I will be back at Kamol in a week and have a revision. But here too, it is not about possible dissatisfaction but about the fact that I have developed a so-called prolapse. By the way - a prolapse can have various causes - one of the most unlikely is that the doctor made a mistake.
</p>
<p>
So I trust Kamol&#39;s work again.
</p>
<p>
However, you can see that healing is always an individual matter for people! Smoking, drugs, alcohol, age, physical fitness, self-discipline, etc. are all factors that have a much greater influence on healing than the doctor&#39;s pure surgical work.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it seems to me as if this subreddit is only about putting down the work of some doctors and over-praising other doctors - what about the actually necessary principle of neutrality? If you want to have a place to help others, then you should be neutral and objective - I can&#39;t see that with all the insinuations and sometimes published untruths. Instead, the craziest stories are spread and many, in their uncertainty, believe this nonsense.
</p>
<p>
I would have liked to have written more about my experiences with Kamol in this Reddit and also shown pictures, but with this negative intimidation, it is no fun to then be accused of still being on your honeymoon or of receiving a benefit from Kamol.
</p>
<p>
Again - I still get ZERO in return from Kamol and pay the normal price for everything!
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, I can still recommend Kamol without reservation!

<p>
Kamol is certainly not the best option for every procedure in terms of price-performance.
</p>
<p>
But that&#39;s normal - very few clinics are able to offer any type of procedure with the best price-performance ratio.
</p>
<p>
An example of this is my last trip to Turkey for liposuction, BBL and BA.
</p>
<p>
While the BA in Turkey was really great and the doctor did an amazing job, she was a bit too defensive for me personally during my liposuction.
</p>
<p>
I will have another liposuction in Mexico because the best doctor for me is here at the moment.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, I would recommend my doctor in Turkey - both for BA and for Lipo and BBL, because she did a good job technically, which was subjectively just too cautious for me.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s what I understand by objectivity!
</p>
<p>
And everyone can do something with such fair descriptions.
</p>
<p>
With such untrue horror stories, some of which are spread here about Kamol, no one can form an objective picture.
</p>
<p>
So please be fair and leave your personal frustration out of the assessment of doctors and also describe any eventualities as to why it is like this for you.
</p>
<p>
There is no shame in saying, for example, that you did things during your recovery that may have damaged the healing process and it is definitely fairer to the people in your life who want to help you!
</p>
<p>
Something else about the employees!
</p>
<p>
Again - these are employees who cannot and do not want to look after just one person 24/7!
</p>
<p>
It is a job for them and they do it well!
</p>
<p>
If you need round-the-clock care, a hand-holder or some kind of physical closeness, bring a family member, a girlfriend or friend or book an escort!

<p>
What is your problem?
</p>
<p>
First and foremost, I wanted to get rid of a prolapse, which probably came about because I exercised too early and too much. A problem that can also occur in normal women if they lift too much weight in the gym.
</p>
<p>
The other reason was that I wanted my labia to be a little tighter.
</p>
<p>
I got all of this from Kamol during my touch up and I am satisfied.
</p>
<p>
I couldn&#39;t imagine a doctor where I feel better cared for than with Kamol.
</p>
<p>
However, there are also things where I go to other doctors (for example liposuction and bbl in Mexico or Colombia). But this is because the doctors there do exactly what I want visually.
</p>
<p>
For SRS, however, I would go back to Kamol at any time because he does what I want.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s what you call objectivity and honesty in the discussion!
</p>
<p>
I can post pictures with real results at any time and don&#39;t have to hide behind a pseudonym that doesn&#39;t mean anything and empty accusations.

Iâ€™m not even gonna reply to this horrendous and disgusting post full of lies. This post is just the proof of what Kamol hospital and their long term employees are , disgusting people who take profits to transgender people who are suffering, their main interest are simply money and living you with a botch surgery is even better to them cause they will charge extra after if you want to have a revision with them . Not only a lot of ex patients are speaking out but a lot of ex short term employees are telling the truth after living that place when realising all the botching surgeries their are making. That place is not an hospital made of real care , is a botcher fabric hell.

Maybe it&#39;s not just Kamol but the nature of his surgical techniques too. He should work on that too. And not let students perform the surgery.

ðŸ˜… yes is a very horrible and dangerous account . No absolutely I would never recommend any surgeon in Thailand because I really think that they are non very good there and they are butcher too, Iâ€™ve had 3 surgeries in total there. My support is based only and mainly in advices and finding solutions and we donâ€™t recommend directly any doctors or any specific actions to take , we only advise based on others experiences and other point of view. No I donâ€™t work for any surgeon ðŸ¤£ I get paid by my charity organisation who is funded mainly by councils and governments funds . Those who contact us knows that we are not sellers and we donâ€™t need to convince about anything. Our is a safe place where money are not important and not involved. The charity is called Mind and we the project is called Rainbow MIND , rainbow refer obviously to the LGBTq+ community but since thereâ€™s also MIND involved is aimed to support also those who are not part of the LGBTQ+ community.

Absolute nonsense!
</p>
<p>
Kamol does a good job!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m originally from Germany and know the situation in Germany, which is still a lot better from a social point of view than in other countries.
</p>
<p>
In Germany, only penis inversion is still performed - a method that is rarely performed in Thailand because there are more modern methods.
</p>
<p>
Look at the results from the Suporn Clinic or the results from Kamol. In my opinion, much better than what you get in Germany.
</p>
<p>
A friend from Germany is also traveling to Kamol soon because not a single doctor in Germany can offer her PPV or the sigmoid method, even though she is a private patient.
</p>
<p>
But you have to be fair and admit that there are now good surgeons in the USA too. The only question is at what price, because such procedures are many times more expensive than in Thailand.

You have no clue what you are talking about. Almost every case of ppv Kamol does closes. Every girls I talked to had issues and went back to get colon. This place is a trap. If youâ€™re happy good for you. Stop promoting a place that would be closed down in every other country.

Girls here share this post like the plague. Everything she says itâ€™s true. Madam controls all invoicing so that no one sees how there is inconsistencies into what people are paying because they will over charge, surcharge, for procedures left and right and she doesnâ€™t want anyone to see that. They closed their Facebook profile and reopened one because it was that bad. So many employees have complained about this place. And they were threatening them online. I am making a huge YouTube video on them will all info and videos. Â Vanessa is a compulsive whatever she claim and says here is completely false and simply trying to save the little base of people crazy enough to still go there. If we all start to voice ourselves and post everything. It will bring so much shame to Thailand that hopefully they will be force to take action to save their image on the international stage.
</p>
<p>
Thailand has super good surgeons Kamol is not one of them and if you donâ€™t want permanent damage on top of not being able to have answer or your file to explain to future surgeon what was done. Donâ€™t go there.
</p>
<p>
You will be left with having reparations surgeries blindly because you wonâ€™t be able to tell exactly what was done. Putting yourself even more at risk and being open again maybe for something the new surgeon canâ€™t repair once he see how bad it is. Scan have limitation they also need to know what was attempted and what was done.

You can literally have stealth sex , and your results doesnâ€™t even get clocked, so at least itâ€™s not completely butchered.

But still, visually her results are passable, Wich is a big statement knowing that most of us canâ€™t open our legs without being clocked because of the scars and the bad aesthetics, which is sometimes you canâ€™t fully fix even with surgery.

Rude. And even Dr therapong has prominent and obvious scars, letâ€™s be honest, maybe kamol is not consistent, but he does have good technique at least aesthetically.

You&#39;re right. Dr. Kamol has better stitch work than Dr. Theerapong.

I remember when I used to talk to you , you used to tell me that you are insecure about the scars specifically, so donâ€™t act as if you are better than everyone else.

Maybe they are among the lucky ones that got the surgery done by kamol himself. Many of the surgeries happening in that hospital nowadays is done by students and they are botching people ðŸ˜¥
