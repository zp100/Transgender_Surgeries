It&#39;s really confusing.
</p>
<p>
FFS only slightly feminised my appearance.  However that slight change has pushed me over the edge in to cis passing.  It&#39;s a huge internal struggle, because in the mirror, I can&#39;t see much of a difference.  Even my friends and family had to struggle hide how surprised they were at how little I&#39;d changed.  To them and to me, I still look like a trans woman.
</p>
<p>
Yet, to strangers, I don&#39;t.  I pass to people who didn&#39;t know me before.
</p>
<p>
Good luck measuring those results in a survey :)

My forehead work was quite a big change but oh my lord everything you said here I relate to so much! To anyone who didn’t know me prior to FFS I’m cis passing but to anyone who knew before the change didn’t do much to their perception of me, or my own for that matter.

You can’t look at the FFS price as the “price of passing”.
</p>
<p>
There’s no guarantee of passing, it’s very individual and those who pass are either fortunate or early transitioners. FFS can safely make a certain set of changes, but there are a lot of gender tells overall and not all of those can be changed. You have nerves, teeth, skin, etc, which can’t be completely changed. It also depends largely on the doctor and the techniques used.

I’ve met a lot of women who’ve had ffs and almost all of them pass as far as I can tell. There’s a few people around who are unusually good at picking up the signs, but it’s not normal. I know someone who always notices when cis women have had cosmetic surgery, I’ve no idea how.

FFS is the best thing you can do 100%. And the results can be dramatic, however some people won&#39;t pass even with FFS due to a very masculine starting point.
</p>
<p>
Other things help too. Permanent makeup, makeup skills, cosmetic dental surgery, massetter botox, hair transplants, body shaping treatments and surgeries, VFS/voice training, weight loss in general, etc. Slowly over time your body will feminize in subtle ways as well as long as you stay consistent with HRT and get rid of any testosterone.

My FFS was really subtle but the effects are really sublime. It pushed me from androgynous ‘kinda trans’ looking to looking cis in photos. I seem to pass better too?
</p>
<p>
In terms of passability I think these things can be hard to judge, subject to a lot of bias either way, and can be skewed by other things like voice or how trans aware people are. So that bit is hard to be objective on.
</p>
<p>
I can objectively say FFS helped massively with dysphoria and honestly that alone is worth the 30k. I no longer wince at the mirror or at photos taken of me.
<em>
That

is significant.

I had FFS 3 months ago. I seem to pass everywhere I go now, even without makeup. That&#39;s a plus. But I still think I look like a man when I look in the mirror.
</p>
<p>
I actually can&#39;t believe that I&#39;m passing to people. It feels like everyone is just patronizing me. I&#39;m still afraid of getting clocked.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t help that my hair is still growing out and is currently an uneven mess. Maybe hair transplants would help my self image. When I put on a wig I definitely see a bit difference compared to what I looked like before.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a real struggle to even put on makeup some days because I feel like what&#39;s the damn point?
</p>
<p>
Maybe I look &#34;more feminine&#34; but I don&#39;t think I look like a woman in an absolute sense. Maybe after a few more months I&#39;ll start to feel better about it but for now I&#39;m back to my pre-surgery coping mechanisms: avoiding selfies and mirrors and staying out of family pictures.

Statistics get thrown off by dysmorphia too.  There are people who look much improved, even passing, and complain omg I got botched I still look like a man.

It&#39;s hard to change your &#39;self image&#39; that you have in your brain. I look at myself in the mirror and go, &#34;I haven&#39;t really changed&#34;...but when I look at photos that&#39;s obviously false...and especially when I put on makeup or a wig, it&#39;s blatantly false.
</p>
<p>
But as others have mentioned, the impression that strangers have has completely changed.  I pass waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more often in public than I did before my FFS. And it was immediate (three times on the flight home).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d only passed once prior to FFS and it&#39;s to the point now that unless I&#39;m not shaving for a while because of electrolysis or I speak, I&#39;m usually getting gendered correctly.
</p>
<p>
Which is kinda of a mind fuck really. But it feels good.
</p>
<p>
Even then though...despite me going, &#34;Nope I don&#39;t see a woman in the mirror&#34; my dysphoria is much improved. I don&#39;t HATE what I see in the mirror anymore either. So SOMETHING has changed.
</p>
<p>
Brains are fucking weird.

I don&#39;t think a report or study is really going to help much in deciding whether you should have FFS. It&#39;s just such an individual thing depending on how much dysphoria (which maybe be unwarranted dysphoria) you have and how many masculine elements your face may or may not have.
</p>
<p>
I chose Di Maggio as I thought he was aggressive and was competent over Facial Team who I don&#39;t consider aggressive although they are competent and seem to treat their patients well. Now I already passed well prior to going to Argentina so the fact I wasted US $40000 on surgery that didn&#39;t do much is less distressing than if I didn&#39;t pass and was really relying on it. My ears being mutilated and the apparent dodginess of Di Maggio is something I only realised after the surgery, if I had my time over I&#39;d probably just go to Facial Team.
</p>
<p>
Obviously my surgery was messed up and I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s had a bad FFS, so really I would advise only having FFS if it&#39;s really going to make a difference and to be careful on who you chose to do it.
</p>
<p>
Now as I&#39;ve said I paid $40000 and really $50000 when you include flights, accommodation and a month off work in missing wages. But I took I think $44000 out of my pension to pay for the surgery, so that money was sitting there making money and if I&#39;d not taken it out in the 20 or so years I have left before I retire who knows how much that money might have grown to, maybe $200,000. So that&#39;s really what this failed FFS cost me ultimately and frankly I can&#39;t afford to lose that much money for nothing.

If you reread my post you&#39;ll see i took it from my pension fund. I don&#39;t have that kind of money in my savings as it&#39;d have taken years to save money to have VFS, FFS and SRS. Taking the money from my pension fund I managed all three ops in 8 months.

What&#39;s interesting to me is that patient satisfaction 1 month post op was nearly the same as at 6 months.
</p>
<p>
This suggests to me that if you don&#39;t like your results within the first month you&#39;re probably not going to like them later, either.

Honestly,  dysphoria is a bitch sometimes and even if you pass every day after FFS you still might personally think you look like a guy. I haven&#39;t been clocked or misgendered in about 6 months. Living my life pretty stealth. but even with all of this, I still feel like I look male in the mirror. We tend to be overly critical of our self&#39;s and that&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t go away right away after surgery

On point B, They are going to look like they had surgery because they only just had it with the last week or two. I’m not sure you can draw any conclusion about long term results.

I&#39;d guess you are quite observant. I&#39;ve seen quite a number from Facial Team and not been able to tell they have has surgery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen work from other surgeons where it is quite obvious they have had cosmetic surgery, but not in a way they I&#39;d think they were trans. What that means I&#39;m not sure. I guess I&#39;m not very good at picking it out.

I&#39;m sure most people are totally oblivious to trans people, just like I used to be. These days I keep studying peoples facial structures and have noticed a few other trans people around. I&#39;d never noticed a single one before. I keep seeing what I believe are cis-women who have quite strong masculine features as well. Its all very confusing.

I&#39;m kind of in the same position. I went to a ffs surgeon who has a lot of experience and it has been doing surgeries for years, and she said that I shouldn&#39;t get anything done that I have good bone structure and features. She said that there are a couple of things if I really wanted to rein it in I could do, but weren&#39;t absolutely necessary.
</p>
<p>
Now, I pass well, despite the fact I&#39;m 6&#39;2&#34;. But I don&#39;t pass all the time, so there&#39;s that little bit that if I use out, I think it could help me. And yes, I&#39;ve had to ask myself if it might be worth it for me to spend $12k for a couple of  small changes, but if they could make a difference, it
<em>
could
</em>
be worth it.
</p>
<p>
I think it&#39;s a tough call. A lot of money for what may make a small difference. But is it worth that money and the risk for it? TBH, for people like us, I think is a personal decision because we can&#39;t predict the results. GL with yours!

What is your head size and face shape?
</p>
<p>
FFS works on people with petite skulls and round faces. If you have a big head and a long face you wont pass afterwards as FFS can&#39;t change those things. Post some photos and I&#39;ll tell you if ffs would work on you or not.

This sounds really shitty but please don&#39;t listen to her. She posted this on various accounts and doesn&#39;t realize that her face is fine and it&#39;s not the end of the world to have a slightly longer face. Look at her post history
