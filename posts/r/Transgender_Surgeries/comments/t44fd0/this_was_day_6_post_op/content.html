this was yesterday im now on day 7. everything is out except the catheter which is giving me issues. im leaking pee around it so i can&#39;t really hold anything. they won&#39;t take it out just yet because of some bleeding left over. at this point tho im just ready to have this thing gone ðŸ˜”

well its great for the first few days when you have the pee bag attached. don&#39;t even feel when your&#34;peeing&#34; but once they put the valve on that&#39;s when it starts to feel uncomfortable. as long as you don&#39;t tung it and not drain your blatter completely you&#39;ll be fine. but when they take the stint out if they don&#39;t do the catheter at the same time then you might have some leakage around the catheter which i had. its normal but it burns like hell. hopefully that doesn&#39;t happen to you but if it does just be ready. your not going to be able to hold yourself back if it gets bad.
</p>
<p>
good luck to you ðŸ’—

the valve is to relieve yourself when you need to pee. and they usually both come out at the time, however i just have some bleeding so they didn&#39;t want to take it out till after it stopped

oh I got it, damn I would prefer they keep everything inside instead to have just something removed and something left but I guess they don&#39;t let you decide on this

Put a straw kinda in your cheek, and create a bit of a vacuum. Wiggle it around, it was a bit like that for me  UNTIL a nurse made me sit in a hard chair and it suddenly burned in my bladder... but that was the fault of the physical therapy staff, not the catheter. It generally wasn&#39;t painful or bothersome. Some people do feel the urge to &#34;pee it out&#34; and may experience a sensation of &#34;needing to pee/ burning pee&#34; for a few days after.

Sending thoughts of healing to you . . . Very sorry your experiencing this, after what youâ€™ve been through already. As to your care plan, what did the team tell you about when the catheter can be removed?

Did you have vaginoplasty or zero-depth? I&#39;m trying to find info on what I&#39;d experience, since I&#39;m considering zero-depth.
