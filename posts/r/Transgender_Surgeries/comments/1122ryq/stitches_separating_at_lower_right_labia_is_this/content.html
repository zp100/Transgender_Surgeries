Just as a little extra background info, I&#39;m 11 days post OP, got discharged from the hospital 2 days ago and my surgeons been really hard to get into contact with. I assume this happened when I went to sit on the toilet since Ive always been very violent about that. It doesnt really hurt or anything but the crust on it can be a bit uncomfortable.

Generally speaking swelling, movement, and dilation causing stitches to get funky is pretty normal. Especially if yours are dissolving ones. Your body will combine that stuff together no problem over time! A lot of gals talk about on here how even major dehiscence became just a minor wrinkle on their labias at like 6+ months. A more pressing concern is your surgeon not responding to you! Do you have a follow-up appointment planned with your surgeon now that your out of the hospital? Mine wanted to see me 1 week after release, then 2 weeks after that one, and now 6 weeks.

Thank you so much for the reassurance haha. Sadly my surgeon is a very busy person (like everyone else in the hospital I went to) so its a bit tough to get a hold of them. They were also off sick the day before I was released so Im not quite sure yet if she&#39;s in good health yet. But yeah I only have 1 follow up appointment in 6 weeks, so till then Im Sorta on me own.

Yeah I think that means it&#39;s healing normally.  You are not as swollen and that explains why it&#39;s looser than it was before.

I can understand that.  Fortunately, I had a 10 day follow-up with my surgeon, and he was already removing some of these stitches in the office visit.
