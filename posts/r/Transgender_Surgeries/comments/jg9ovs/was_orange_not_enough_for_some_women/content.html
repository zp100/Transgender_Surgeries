I can get to the orange dilator now fairly easily.  Most of my partners have been larger than that. I&#39;m curious for those who faced a similar challenge, did you need to dilate higher to accommodate those men, or could you just squeeze it in?

My boyfriend is much bigger than any of the dilators I&#39;ve seen. Combine that with the complications of my surgery and it&#39;s been 13 months and we still cant have PiV sex.

And you&#39;re on orange #4?
</p>
<p>
Is he able to go inside partially or fully, and it&#39;s just too painful or difficult to move in and out?  Or he can&#39;t get in at all?
</p>
<p>
This is concerning

<p>
Yes. He cannot get inside, it is also painful to try.
</p>
<p>
I can take, vaginal valium, amitriptyline, and Levsin. And he can take Viagra, but I am still so tight around the opening that a penis(because it is squishy even at its hardest) is not able to get in. Even if I remove the dilator and he tries immediately.
</p>
<p>
The opening feels and looks like half a rubber o-ring(around the bottom-near my perineum) that gets more tight the more aroused I am.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and my perineum swells extensively when I defecate. It&#39;s a magical life that my surgeons say I&#39;m perfectly fine living.

At 13 months? Omfg...
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s the hardness around the bottom of the vaginal opening from?  Have you seen another gynecologist about it?

Dr. Daniel Dugi said that the tightness in the opening is a result of how my surgeons at KU Medical performed the surgery. He said he was not able to see exactly what it was that they did because the surgical notes were the most minut he had ever seen. He said that when he started performing these surgeries he did it in a way that would frequently result in outcomes like mine, but when he figured out it was being caused by method he said he changed them.
</p>
<p>
Yes I was sent to what my surgeons call a &#34;vulva expert&#34; at the same hospital as my surgeons. She would (for obvious reasons) only call it a neovagina and explained that the pains are from Neuropathy as a result of poor pain management post-op. She put me on a medication called Nystatin that was supposed to increase the thickness of the skin down around my perineum so it wouldn&#39;t hurt as much.

Forgive my layman&#39;s terms, but that seems like a half assed treatment for you.  I&#39;m sorry, and I hope you eventually see improvement.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m at 3 months so I can&#39;t say much about mine.  Only that getting past my pubic bone is so hard, especially bc at times it&#39;s like there&#39;s a large hard bump on the other side.  No idea what that is.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m afraid mine will feel too hard to a partner. Nthe muscles down there are ridiculously tight.  Like I can wipe all my lube off just by flexing them and removing the dilator

Definitely feels like I&#39;ve been neglected by my doctors but no lawyers even want to begin the process of suing a hospital as big as KU Med.

If your partner is a cis guy, they are squishy even when erect. Dilators are not.

Have you had sex with them and it went ok?
</p>
<p>
Ugh, this is sorta embarrassing, but...
</p>
<p>
Using my mouth as a ruler, orange #4 is fairly easy to swallow, both getting my mouth over it and to the back.  About half my previous partners were too big for that.  The other half were close to the same feeling.
</p>
<p>
So I just worry that if I only dilate to orange, that they won&#39;t be able to penetrate.  One person said the squishy texture makes a penis easier, but it doesn&#39;t for oral, so I&#39;m less sure.

The last guy I was with I couldn&#39;t get my hand around it.  I was alarmed.  I&#39;m not worried about length very much but these kind of penises seem to come with the men I&#39;m attracted to.
