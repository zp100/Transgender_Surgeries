Hello all!  I just had a question for people who have had penile-preservation vaginoplasty (PPV) or who are well-informed on the topic, do you know if it would be possible to get PPV while leaving open the possibility of later deciding to have the penis reshaped into a clitoris for a typical, non-PPV vaginoplasty result?

There&#39;s only a handful of surgeons that do PPV, so I&#39;d recommend just sending an email to each and asking them directly.

Well if one does get PPV, and then later gets a revision to create a clitoris to replace the penis, that basically exactly the same as a regular vaginoplasty, but just split into two surgeries (and a lot of people end up having two surgeries anyways, for revisions, so I  don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too big of a deal to split it in two).  So if someone knows they want a vagina but is not sure if they want to get rid of their penis, wouldn‚Äôt this be a great option for them?  They can this way get a vagina but keep their penis, and see how that feels for them, and then finish their SRS later if they decide that‚Äôs what they want.

Quite expensive though if they didn&#39;t end up needing a secondary surgery.  Especially since some doctors will cover revisions if what they intended doesn&#39;t work out.

Perhaps with good trans-inclusive insurance they could both be covered, though?

I don&#39;t want to be Debbie downer, but the chances of that are quite low worldwide.  There are a few, but they are the outliers.

<p>
no it isn&#39;t. the scars and the placement of the tissue will all around be far worse. the skin of your penis is usually used for either labia or vagina, if the &#34;first step&#34; doesn&#39;t involve your penis, the skin obviously can&#39;t be used. &#34;reducing&#34; your penis to a clitoris in a &#34;second step&#34; would not lead to the same result as regular SRS.

here&#39;s pictures of PPV:

imagine those but with a tiny clit instead of a dick. that&#39;s something entirely different than the result of normal srs.

The last two have defined labia. Couldn&#39;t the neoclitoris just be moved down to the usual position between them?
</p>
<p>
I can imagine that you&#39;d end up with more scarring on the pubic mons, but other than that, I can&#39;t see it being too different, considering the variety of different results and surgical techniques out there.

I thought the methods used for PPV created zero depth and were basically cosmetic. My wife wants me to use PPV and that&#39;s from what I&#39;ve been reading..
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure a surgeon somewhere would take the job but may be best to talk to them individually. My friend is having trouble with her revision (a different one) and many surgeons are seeming reluctant to try.. I suspect it&#39;s to avoid being blamed for potential flaws caused be the first surgeon, etc

you can get PPV and still have depth. Obviously it just wouldn‚Äôt be through penile inversion. But they could still do peritoneal pull-through or colonvaginoplasty.

Using the colon is growingly seen as only a last resort source of material because of the dangers/risks involved. The standard for PPV is skin graft, though at least one surgeon currently offering PPV also offers PPV in combination with peritoneal pull-through as an option.

Oh ok gotcha! Yeah, what you said. Not gonna lie, that is an appealing option, PPV with peritoneal pull-through.

If you want zero depth that is an option that should be pursueable, but it is not the standard at all.
