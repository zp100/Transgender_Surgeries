<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/jtrthy/nsfw_8_days_post_op_from_lipoabdominoplasty_and/">You can see my first post on this procedure</a>
</p>
<p>
Today is my 3 month surgiversary and I thought I would post an update from my previous post.
</p>
<p>
To reiterate some. I had fat grafting for primary breast augmentation and lipoabdominoplasty (tummy tuck) on Nov 4th 2020. I had  250cc (L) 200cc (R) of fat injected into my breasts.
</p>
<p>
I had these procedures performed by
<a href="http://www.zeidlerplasticsurgery.com/">Dr Zeidler</a>
outside of San Jose, CA.
</p>
<p>
I decided on fat grafting because I wanted the most natural possible breast enhancement. I did not want to deal with having a medical device in me that could potentially reject and I also did not want to deal with eventually exchanging the implants later in life. I wrote more extensively about why I went with Dr Zeidler specifically and fat grafting breast augmentation generally in my first post.
</p>
<p>
Reflecting back on this whole process I can say that doing the abdominoplasty in conjunction with lipo and fat grafting BA was a very intense experience in many ways dominated by the abdominoplasty. Suturing your six pack (rectus abdominus) muscles I think created a very significant difference in the curvature of my figure but I&#39;ve had to be fairly careful about my activity, careful not to over exert my abs for about 3 months while the permanent sutures set ( as a nurse friend described it - this is kind of like getting a permanent internal corset ). I think that it also really improved the look of my stomach as the overhanging &#34;pannus&#34; of loose skin and extracellular matrix was removed. Currently my stomach I think looks much better and it&#39;s *still* experiencing some edema (swelling) that will decrease over the next several months.
</p>
<p>
I find that my fat retainment in my breasts seems quite good. I feel that the 200/250cc made a significant though not overwhelming difference in my breasts. The amount of fat removed was fairly low because we decided in advance to mostly only take fat from my stomach and a little from my flanks (lower back) rather than try and harvest as much fat as possible as I lacked a large amount of fat and by breaking up the fat grafting into two procedures we believed this would minimize the chance of any negative outcomes (such as cysts or nodes).
</p>
<p>
3 months later I&#39;m extremely pleased I chose Dr Zeidler to have my surgery with. From my first consult where I had a list of about 30~ questions that spanned the gamut of philosophical to highly technical through the pre-op and surgery I felt in extremely competent hands and felt very cared for. At one point, near my surgery but after my surgical pre-op I emailed her office as I was having a lot of anxiety about the shape and outcome of my boobs and she called me and we spoke for a solid 30-45 minutes going over again, what sort of boob aesthetic I wanted and her process in doing fat grafting. Afterwards she asked me to compile a look book of boobs I liked which I did - with significant explanation. I am subsequently extremely happy with the shape. I wanted very natural breasts with a fairly sloping upper pole (top) and a round lower pole (bottom of the breast), which I feel very strongly she achieved. My post-op experience was also very positive as well. With the abdominoplasty I had a lot of post-ops that all went very well and she even provided me with her phone number to txt her with following the surgery if I had any questions. I texted her a number of times about things and she was always extremely responsive.
</p>
<p>
Though Dr Zeidler is not a trans specific surgeon I felt extremely affirmed in my identity throughout this experience by all her staff and she has even posted a number of IG stories about my surgery (with my explicit written consent as well as repeated communication with me about how I wished my surgery to be portrayed). She and all her staff were extremely good about respecting my pronouns (they/them) as well as using the correct name (even though some aspects of our communication used my dead name) . Also she&#39;s in network with many insurance plans so if your plan covers procedures she performs the process is incredibly painless.
</p>
<p>
At this point I&#39;m now about 3 weeks away from my next surgery with her. In this surgery I plan to fully harvest the rest of my back fat as well as fat from my upper inner thighs and a small amount from my outer thighs. I will have a small amount of additional fat grafted to my temples and lips and then subsequently the majority grafted to my breasts and some grafted to my hip dips. Part of the reason to lipo my outer thighs is that this lipo in conjunction with the grafting to my hip dips will help smooth them out.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very pleased with my current results but I am extremely excited for my subsequent surgery as well and will be posting a follow up with that one as well.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to answer any questions anyone may have about my experience or about fat grafting BA or abdominoplasty in general

You look like the best friend from every Hallmark movie that the female protagonist is jealous of. The one that gets her saying, “Chelsea’s got the bod, the hubby, the house, why don’t I have that? Why can’t Brad just commit?”
</p>
<p>
You be that friend everyone envies. You be that friend.

I just had a consult with her this past week for breast reconstruction.  She was fantastic in the consult as was her staff.  I hope to start the actual progress soon.
