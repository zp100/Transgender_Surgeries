<p>
Dr. Billington reported experience with breast augmentation for transgender patients, including the anatomical differences between breast augmentation for people who were assigned male and female at birth. She was careful to ask about pronouns, and I didnâ€™t hear any misgendering.
</p>
<p>
She asked about gender-affirming goals, including gender nonconforming outcomes, instead of assuming that I wanted to pass as cis female. Implants and fat transfer were offered, with realistic expectations given for both. Dr. Billington follows WPATH guidelines, requires a letter from a mental health professional clearing you for breast augmentation, and requires a year or two of feminizing hormones to allow breast tissue to develop naturally before considering breast augmentation.
</p>
<p>
Overall the consult was a comfortable, gender-affirming experience, and I have no reason not to recommend her to any trans folks in East Tennessee looking for breast augmentation.
