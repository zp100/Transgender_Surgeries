Hey everyone, I’m having some pretty bad issues with dilation and need some help.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been able to get my size 2 dilator (30mm) in, and even able to get the blue soul source dilator in with some effort. But I feel like I’m at a brick wall.
</p>
<p>
The curve on the soul source dilator (especially size 3, the green one right under big orange) is excruciating, and it feels like it’s scraping my urethra no matter how much lube I add. I got a silicone dilator that’s kind of in between (1.3 inches compared to the 1.25 of the soul source 2), but nothing, and I mean NOTHING I do can get the green one in without awful pain. I feel like I’m at a roadblock.
</p>
<p>
I’m at 9 weeks so I feel like this size shouldn’t be an issue. Could the curve on the soul source one be the issue? Should I buy a THIRD set of dilators? My liaison says plenty of her girls use soul source with no problem but I feel like a failure.
</p>
<p>
Plus there’s the fact that the scar contraction that makes dilation harder at 3 months seems to be coming early, so I’m a bit of a mess.
</p>
<p>
Anyone have any advice? I really should’ve just gotten the regular PAI dilators instead of being bougie and going for the Soul Source ones….

Some people do seem to hate it.  It hasn&#39;t bothered me personally, and I even have to tip it up a bit father to go all in.  Our angles likely all differ, and are almost entirely dependent on the shape of our pelvises.   If you try a straighter one with the same diameter and it goes in easier, then you&#39;ll have your answer.   If it doesn&#39;t though, then you need to try other experiments.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile if the size down can go in all the way, be sure and keep using it and massaging around, then go as deep as you can with green.   I suspect that when you&#39;ve probed often enough with blue, and worked it well, then green will follow.  That is definitely how it worked for me.   I&#39;m 14 weeks out and had to go back down to green yesterday after using nothing but orange for 2 months.  But for some reason, it no go.  It went fine after 20 minutes with green.
