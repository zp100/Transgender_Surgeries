How long after silver nitrate treatment did you have the black/brown discharge? I had silver nitrate treatment on 24th May, and am still having a considerable amount of the horrible coloured discharge.

Do you douche?
</p>
<p>
I found that between douching and using my shower cassette to gently rinse the area had everything clear within a couple of days.

Personally, I had awful gray/brown discharge that lasted 2-3 days, with random residual discharge for a few weeks, but in tiny amounts. Hoping I never need silver nitrate treatment again.

I wonder too! Can your doctor/gyno/whoever did the granulation take a look and tell you? Hard to inspect by yourself and without a speculum.
</p>
<p>
Dilation was very painful for me after the silver nitrate treatment, so I wonder if the treatment itself could have caused a small wound?
</p>
<p>
Does the discharge show any signs of slowing down?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having to deal with this. Going from no discharge to awful ashen discharge is no fun

Sounds like it&#39;s been an exhausting ordeal. I wish I could offer insight, but mine is a brand new vagina so I don&#39;t have much experience.
</p>
<p>
I feel like August 19 is a while away, perhaps you could get in touch with the nurse again or even try to contact the surgeon directly? Also a Zoom consult will be great for discussing everything, but no good for actual inspection if it&#39;s needed.
</p>
<p>
I hope the fifth revision will be the last! And that the whole thing has been worth it despite the setbacks
