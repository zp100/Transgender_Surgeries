Definitely need to look into more hair removal around my labia, but nothing internal growing from what I or the doctors/nurses have seen. Thinking more electro between my labia minora and majora, and then get to work on lasering everything else into a nice bikini-esque shape. Then probably full body if I can afford it üòÖ

Full body is sooo worth it :) it&#39;s nice to feel smooth skin instead of stubble half a day after shaving. You can usually get package deals for laser which can help with the cost a fair bit

How was your hair removal going in? Did you have all hair cleared from the area they say to clear? I&#39;m getting my surgery in July and down to around 5% left.

I followed the map RB-L gave to the letter, but still had some very light hairs on the area that were scrapped during surgery. If I could do it all over again, I would probably go to the top of the base of the shaft rather than the bottom like she shows... Also further out into the genital crease and further down (e.g. - the whole perineum and bottom of my butt). I can DM some pictures of what it looked like before if that helps.

Your results look fantastic and give me hope‚ù£Ô∏è My turn at NYU is this April. I have over 72-hrs in genital electrolysis and am now dealing with some vellus hair. I‚Äôll have a few more sessions, making sure not to exceed three-wks to surgery. Q: Did you or the surgery team shave the genital hair the day of surgery?  I have other ???‚Äôs but don‚Äôt want to hijack this thread. May I DM you?

to pre-op hair removal pics for those interested. For the record, RB-L specifically states that she won&#39;t operate if hair removal isn&#39;t good enough, but again, should have probably done more in all directions to avoid post-op hair removal.

Thanks! I think it&#39;s healing pretty well, but definitely still swollen, and that&#39;s making my labia majora a bit lopsided. Odds are that&#39;ll even out with time though, and even if it doesn&#39;t, there&#39;s not one way for a vagina to look, plus a revision is always on the table too. That&#39;s definitely jumping the gun though lol üòÖ

How has the recovery been? I&#39;m scheduled right now with BBL/Z for December but they offered me a date in August. I really want to take it, but I just don&#39;t feel like I could take that much time off work at that time of year. I guess, right now, would you be capable of doing 8 hours of staring at a computer screen and doing work in between dilation sessions? I can work from home, but only if I can actually be productive. And I also kind of don&#39;t want to kill all of my vacation time being stuck in bed watching cartoons.

I would say a minimum of 3-4 weeks away from work, but YMMV... I kind of lucked out because my company has an annual shutdown around Christmas time to do inventory, so I got an extra week, albeit unpaid. Two weeks out, I can cook and move around, but bending over feels dicey, and sitting is doable, but uncomfortable for longer periods.

I&#39;m confused about the presence of so much hair. Did you not complete hair removal prior to surgery?

No, I did, and she cleared me for surgery. I sent multiple messages to RB-L via MyChart, and she told me multiple times that my hair removal was good. Honestly, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that bad, and it doesn&#39;t really bother me much if I have to go back and get things shaped up more with laser/electrolysis. Honestly, I prefer it that way because I&#39;ll have more control over how it looks, whereas if I got rid of all of it pre-op, I would have been guessing a bit on what to get rid of and how much.

I totally get wanting hair to conceal the scars and everything. I&#39;m confused though because RBBL is also my surgeon and sent me the template. I was cleared for surgery based on the amount of hair removal I had but I&#39;m continuing to get more to be safe. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine but I have a low tolerance for risk.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it&#39;s a great looking result and I hope you continue to post follow-ups as you heal. My surgery is later this year and seeing other people&#39;s results is very reassuring.

Definitely understand the caution, and thanks! I plan on posting progress pics every week up to the one-year mark. Then I&#39;ll probably come back annually to post updates for people interested in more long-term results. That&#39;ll include more hair removal in the area as time goes on too, finances permitting.

Just to be clear, your pre-op pics depict your hair removal progress at the time of surgery? Or, did you undergo more treatments after the pics were taken?

That was taken pre-op after I got the all-clear from RB-L to stop hair removal. I didn&#39;t undergo further treatment beyond that.

Not really sure what you mean here... You&#39;re saying that you needed revisions to fix your clit because it wasn&#39;t hooded correctly? Just confused.

Lack of proper hair removal led to ingrown and inflamed follicles. They ground into the clit for 2.5 years before I got it cut back, the skin redone, and rehooded. It was not a revision tied to the initial surgery but rather a lack of adequate hair removal.  FYI: I had 16 hours of genital electrolysis at E3K and also about 20 laser treatments there.  Sometimes it&#39;s not enough.  There were several hundred follicles involved and part of the clit had to be excised too. Yay me.
