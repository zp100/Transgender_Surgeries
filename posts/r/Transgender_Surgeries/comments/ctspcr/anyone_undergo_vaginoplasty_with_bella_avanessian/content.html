I know she&#39;s relatively new, but I&#39;m starting to seriously look into surgeons. My consult with bluebond-langner langner is in 2021 o.O, and I&#39;m thinking about alternatives. Also, I&#39;m not sure if I like BL&#39;s aesthetics...
</p>
<p>
I like Jess Tings work, and I have heard some good things about Bella Avanessian, but I am having a hard time finding results of her work.
</p>
<p>
Can anyone share their experiences/have any post op pictures they&#39;d be willing to share/know of any images somewhere I can&#39;t find?
</p>
<p>
Thanks.

I had surgery with Dr. Bella earlier this month and truly couldnâ€™t say enough great things.
</p>
<p>
Her care for her patients is great! She spends tike actually listening to the patients and has wonderful bedside manner. I am soo freaking happy with my results and know a few others that are very happy with their results as well.  I have had almost no pain during my recovery the last few weeks. At most Iâ€™ve had discomfort.
</p>
<p>
I would highly recommend Dr. Bella. My gut feeling is she will become a very sought after surgeon over the next few years. Message me if you have any questionsðŸ˜ƒ

Here&#39;s my
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/cms467/2_months_postop_grs_with_dr_avanessian_june_2019/content.html" rel="nofollow">post</a>
about having surgery with her recently.  I&#39;ll update more as time goes on, but weekly pics don&#39;t show much change at this point for me.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s really amazing and is easily the most trans-aware doctor I&#39;ve ever personally met. The rest of the staff at Mt. Sinai are incredible from my experiences as well.  I&#39;m extremely happy so far with my results and would definitely recommend her.

Your post is very helpful. Thank you for sharing!
</p>
<p>
It looks like your healing has gone very well, congratulations!
</p>
<p>
You mentioned having to tuck a bit before to maintain elasticity... I&#39;m considering an orchiectomy before bottom surgery in part because I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m prepared for all the recovery and not sure I&#39;ll get an appointment in the time that my graduate program (and thus healthcare) is over.
</p>
<p>
I know you didn&#39;t get an orchiectomy before, but did she mention any difficulties about getting an orchiectomy before/recommend, against it?

Thanks- glad it helped! I have known people that had an orchi before going to her. I don&#39;t think I remember any extra issues post-orchi besides maintaining elasticity, but still check in with her (even if just by email) to be sure.
