Dr. Purohit is such a wonderful surgeon and definitely at the top of his speciality in gender confirmation surgery. Dr. Purohit was my surgeon when I had male to female gender confirmation surgery on Aug 14 2020, and I had the best experience of my life. He demonstrated a level of expertise, as well as sensitivity and concern for my well being that went above and beyond my expectations. Throughout my transition process, he was always available to answer questions and talk through any concerns. Through his bedside manner and professionalism, he took away any anxieties I had and made me feel very safe. The results are amazing! I love my new body and I couldn’t be happier! the healing process was smooth, and he was always available for any post surgery concerns or questions. As his patient, it was made very clear to me that I was his primary concern. I can’t say enough good things about him and his practice. Dr. Purohit made my dreams come true, to feel at home in my own body, and I will forever be so grateful!

Do you have a description on what type of SRS you got? The healing, dilating?   I know he is a Urologist so is good with preserving nerve and urethra..
