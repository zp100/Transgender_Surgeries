Hi all!
</p>
<p>
Today starts my new journey at finding a surgeon in America to perform a second revision, which I hope will be the last one. Third time&#39;s a charm, they say.
</p>
<p>
For context, please refer to my original post

I&#39;ll be moving to the east coast for work and so I decided to look for doctors there. My top choices were Bella Avanessian and Rajveer Purohit.
</p>
<p>
After calling Mt Sinai to try to schedule an appointment with Dr Avanessian, i was told she does not do revisions. However, the lady on the phone recommended Dr Ting instead. Anybody had a revision with them and would mind sharing their experience?
</p>
<p>
For Dr Purohit, I was able to get an in-person visit scheduled for October 26th. More updates to come.
</p>
<p>
Any other surgeon you would recommend for revisions in the east coast?

Not from the east coast, but Dr. Christine McGinn does a very good job with SRS (especially the labia minora), she is known to fix Rumer&#39;s work
