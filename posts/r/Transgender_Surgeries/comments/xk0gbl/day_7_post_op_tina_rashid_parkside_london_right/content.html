After yesterdays extended stay in hospital due to UTI which needed IV antibiotics to fix, I escaped by evening to a hotel near the airport for flight home today. Getting to hotel room zonked me completely, and the Zonked feeling seems to come in waves. Just dilated in hotel room. Pix are right after dilation. Still extremely bruised and swollen, I think things will look alot better when this goes down. I believe I am healing pretty well. Minimal blood/gunk both on pad and post dilation. Still pretty numb down there and not done any exploring so far, will hold off until numbness goes. I assume the 2 bits of flesh each side of vagina entrance are granulation tissue. These bits hurt a little during dilation, also reaching depth it hurts a little feels like dilator is going to pop through butt hole from the inside!! All good though and pleased at this early stage. I have never managed to get dilator beyond last dot as I did on first dilation after pack removal, but I still get to the last dot. The blue dilator scares me, will try this during evening dilation once home. Not looking forward to flight home!

Mind if I ask where you live where you need to get a flight home? Northern Ireland? Or are you outside the UK?
