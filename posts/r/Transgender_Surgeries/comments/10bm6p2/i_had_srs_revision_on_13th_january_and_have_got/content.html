Fellow your surgeon&#39;s instructions for that.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I had a minor revision last fall and flew back the next day. It wasn&#39;t a problem. That said, &#34;revision&#34; could.mean a
<em>
very
</em>
wide range of things.

Personally, I think that’s pushing it. I had a revision surgery and was able to go home the next day, but that was years after my original surgery and “home” is a two hour drive away. If I had to fly a long distance away or there was a chance of needing more work, I would definitely have stayed much longer. If you can stay a few days more, I would.
