I am looking at the same surgery with Dr Theerapong so very interested in progress as swelling recedes. I know a month isn’t long. How was the flight back to the US? Did you take example photos of the results you were looking for?

The flight back was pretty rough due to the revision stitches.  I’m pretty sure I was a fluke.  My friend had the same surgery two weeks ahead of me with the same doctor and care team and and the flight for them back wasn’t as bad.  Same with the gal who had surgery 10 days after.

I flew back in business class so I could have the laydown seats.  They were awesome, but I couldn’t lay all the way back because I couldn’t keep my legs that close together due to the discomfort. I highly recommend getting wheelchair service when flying back home.  The airlines require a doctors note for it so make sure you keep it handy.

Business class is the way to go for sure. That’s what I’ll be doing. Wheel chair is a good idea, and thanks for the tip on the doctors note. I’m also planning on leaving a good amount of time between connections.
</p>
<p>
Just a logistics question. Most of the flights I have made are domestic and when I’ve done international it’s either direct or with carry on.  I’m assuming you checked a bag, did you have to manually transfer that on connections as you’re passing through different countries or was every thing check once and collect at destination?

The airline took care of my bag transfer and am pretty sure the service is included with business class. I did my best to keep my overlays to about an hour and a half.  I personally didn’t want to be in the airport any longer than I had to be.

Definitely another great result that reinforces my decision to go with Theerapong for surgery. Do you mind my asking how long the process took from first reaching out to flying over there?

I think my original wait time was something like three months.  The doctor had a last-minute opening though so I really only waited three weeks.

Becky and Cherry from Siam Transformative, Thailand.
</p>
<p>
*Trigger Warning: Racism, Transphobia, Body Shaming and Theft.
</p>
<p>
Theerapong girl here, 2.5 years post-op after having the open sigmoid-colon technique, please see my review and pictures posted some time ago. Whilst some girls may have had positive experiences under Becky and Cherry&#39;s care, I am alarmed and gravely concerned that they are both still working with us, trans and intersex women, a misunderstood and vulnerable community.
</p>
<p>
The start of my experience was pleasant, however, I noticed red flags early on in my five-week stay and recovery in Bangkok. Becky’s ignorance towards women of trans-experience is antiquated and damaging. For instance, when I was undergoing my pre-operative psychological evaluation, the psychiatrist enquired about my intimate life and Becky retorted, &#34;She has sex like a lady-boy.&#34; Yes, I am aware these terms are culturally relative, however, for Becky, a American from Texas, it&#39;s embarrassing that she would use this word, a slur in the Western world and a potential gender-dysphoria trigger.
</p>
<p>
Several girls have discovered that Becky, the driver and interpreter for Siam Transformative, would grossly inflate surgeries, pocketing this for herself without the Interplast Clinic&#39;s or Dr. Theerapong’s knowledge. She and Cherry also house clients in Nawamin which, one day, took over 2 hours just to go one way to the clinic (downtown Bangkok) for a follow up appointment with Dr. Theerapong. They do this because “Cherry” (nurse) lives there and it’s convenient for her to visit clients close to her home, completely disregarding the safety implications of being so far away from your surgeon and also sitting in a car for 4+ hours in one day after having surgery just to see your surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I originally planned to do the Sigmoid-Colon Laparoscopic Technique (580,000 Thai baht) but Dr Theerapong suggested the Sigmoid-Colon Open Technique (380,000 Thai baht) due to greater benefits. I had already paid for the Sigmoid-Colon Laparoscopic Technique and given that the Sigmoid-Colon Open Technique was lower in cost, meaning $6,000 was owed to me. Becky remained quiet about money owed to me, hoping I would remain silent, compliant and overwhelmed by everything that happened. It was only once I asserted myself twice and then returned to the West did Becky returned my money.
</p>
<p>
Becky&#39;s transphobia and views on trans people were evident from the outset, I recall both her and “Cherry” (nurse) remarking I was the &#39;prettiest one they&#39;ve had..so far,&#39; out of their clients, objectifying me like I was a Pokemon. The comparisons did not cease there, both Becky and Cherry felt comfortable telling me how previous clients behaved and reduced their womanhood to nothingness, pointing out their masculine features, stating &#39;a lot of them&#39; smelled and acted like &#39;sloppy,&#39; men and &#39;they will never be women&#39; despite all the surgeries. Perhaps Becky felt comfortable around me enough to reveal herself as a bigot, on one occasion, a Filipina trans woman, residing in Norway was due to have surgery after mine, this client was early in transition and both Becky and Cherry had no reservations in joking she looked like a man! They later made fun of her “man underwear” having holes in it and decided to gift her women’s panties so she could “act like a lady for once”. They had nicknames for all her clients and I later recall how degrading she was about a vulnerable, young client from Cyprus, whom she regarded as a nuisance. I learned later that this woman was struggling with anxiety after surgery.
</p>
<p>
I am pretty thick-skinned, however, I became privy to Becky thinking it was amusing that I felt dysphoric about showing Dr Theerapong or her, my previous genitalia during our consultation and proceeded to gossip about this. I became aware of Becky informing Cherry and other staff about my &#39;massive&#39; pre-op genitalia, again objectifying me. It was after this consultation and reluctantly showing the doctor my genitalia, that Becky&#39;s manner changed towards me and on a few occasions she misgendered me, correcting herself, thinking I did not hear. Passing is a relative and sensitive topic in the trans/intersex fem community, however, my ability to pass whether in rough parts of London or my father&#39;s native Spanish Harlem, New York has never been up for question, I have been able to navigate the cis-gendered world as an attractive and cultured, female in a long-term heterosexual relationship. I can only assume Becky&#39;s behaviour towards me changed after seeing my pre-op genitalia and her bigotry increased.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m unsure if Becky&#39;s Texan background influenced how she engages with people of colour, particularly those of African descent! On discovering my partner was black, Becky&#39;s staff informed me both she and Cherry made jokes insinuating my partner was my pimp and referring to me as a N
<strong>
<em>
er lover. Unfortunately, Cherry also outed this worker’s HIV status to me as well. I can’t even begin to unpack this until this day. As an ambiguous-looking, mixed-race woman post-George Floyd, being called a N
</em>
</strong>
er lover was disappointing and exhausting, Cherry expressed disgust at the texture of my long, thick hair, something I inherited from my Afro-Cuban father. My hair and Latin features aside, Cherry could also not make sense of how fair/&#39;white&#39; my skin was, speculating if I &#39;bleached&#39; my skin, a phenomenon in her native, complexion-obsessed Philippines. Other clients have since expressed concerns about Cherry and her projection that she is being mistreated or patronised on the premise of her being Filipina, again, as another woman of colour, this is untrue.
</p>
<p>
My resilience allowed me to recover and complete my stay in Bangkok, however, upon my return and having complications, Becky, in true form, did not disappoint! I recall messaging her team, telling her I was experiencing loss of blood, Becky responded sarcastically, snarking, I was “having my first period”, completely dismissing my medical crisis and fragile emotional state. It was after this interaction, that I ensured it would be our last. In closing, Becky and Cherry are not safe people for anyone to be around, let alone trans people.
</p>
<p>
I want to reiterate that, while some people may have had positive experiences with Becky and Cherry (interpreter/driver and nurse) from previous company Siam Transformative (now guised as “Siam Transformation”?), please don’t invalidate those who had negative experiences in the hands of Becky and Cherry.
</p>

I doubt the validity of your post due to not only my own experience with Becky and Cherry but that of my other two friends who used their services. Their care team use to include Saphira but she wanted a bigger cut of Cherries pay.  This didn’t sit well with Becky and Cherry since Cherry was doing all the after care work and Saphira was only doing part time office work.  Saphira then went and locked them out of the website and took the client list. Since then Saphira has been throwing all sorts of accusations around on Reddit.  The age and posting history of your account makes me suspicious that this is more of that.  I am truly sorry if that was your honest experience and I’m incorrect.

I was in Bangkok for a total 30 days.  I spent the first three days going to various appointments and treating myself since I knew the days we’re gonna get harder.  I was in the hospital 8 days post op.
<br>
Renee with Siam Transformative was with me the whole time I was in the hospital.  She was amazing and would rub my legs and would get a nurse every time I need my pain meds or something came up.  Having her there for emotional support really helped keep the sad away. I spent the rest of the time recovering in a condo.  Cherry with Siam came twice a day to help with my aftercare.  She has a bunch of methods to help the with healing process.  I definitely recommend paying for the extended aftercare.

Mine were under the muscle and I opted to have the incision under my breast because I juggle fire and was worried it could mess with my technique. I feel like having my BA at the same time lengthened my recovery a little.  I definitely lost more blood because of it.  Felt like my new breasts were causing me more pain than the bottom surgery some of the time. My BA didn’t make dilating any more difficult

okay thank you so much! i have one more question: since you had ppt, is your abdomen swollen from the procedure? i’m asking bc i plan to get the colon procedure but i also want to get a bbl 4-6 months after SRS &amp; was wondering if there could be a possibility i’d have to wait longer between surgeries so the swelling can go down so there’s not danger of injury during my bbl surgery.

it’s hard to say.  The incisions for the laparoscopic surgery definitely reduced my mobility.  I gained 20 pounds post op and contribute that to why my stomach swelled lol

Particularly for laparoscopic surgery, body fat makes the surgery progressively more complex and difficult, and higher body fat % is associated with worse wound healing, and therefore fewer complications. It sucks, but this is the answer. Best wishes 🩷🩵

I wouldn&#39;t say &#34;progressively more complex&#34; Ramineni did me in the same time as his other patients, about 1.5hrs and my BMI at the point of surgery was 53
</p>
<p>
My healing is a Lil slower but the dehiscence didn&#39;t help.
</p>
<p>
I was however able to take care of myself from the moment I was discharged (I had no assistance) and not many people can say that.

There are plenty of fat girls with phenomenal results. It really is more a question of the surgeons expertise and clinical practice (as in how many surgeries), which is true of any variable. Fat does not automatically mean someone will have a bad result. Surgeons like to blame patient characteristics rather than their lack of skill. If they can’t call you delusional, they’ll call you fat, or tell you that you didn’t ‘do as you are told’.

Hi, yes you&#39;re correct, there are loads of fat girls with phenomenal results. And yes, surgeon skill is probably the #1 factor in a good result. But body fat does affect wound healing, and many surgeons will decide the risk is too great as a result. I&#39;m not giving my opinion of whether this is right or wrong, I&#39;m trying to explain why surgeons do this. I understand this BMI cutoff point is completely arbitrary, and yes it still sucks, but the above is why.

I know why surgeons do it, no issues there, and I know you&#39;re not endorsing that position. I&#39;m just using this as an opportunity to draw attention to medicalised fatphobia and to remind people to maintain a healthy critique of fatphobia. There is a good study I found: Post-surgical wound outcomes in fat/overweight/obese people appear to be more influenced by metabolic syndromes that cascade into inflammatory responses, rather than adipose percentage (not every fat person has a metabolic syndrome or inflammatory condition). But far more research is needed. What hasn&#39;t been accounted for? I&#39;m just trying to emphasise the need for nuanced conversation that is conscious of our internalised fatphobia. If we ignore this, healthcare for the fat patient population will never improve. Similar issues exist(ed) for racialised communities. (

So true, it’s exhausting! The fatty acids that make up adipose tissue have an essential role to play in our health, there is nothing wrong with it. Fat produces hormones, converts UV energy to Vitamin D, insulates against the cold, protects the body from trauma, provides energy during glycogen and protein depletion, and gives us trans girls a more feminine shape. I’m so OVER fatphobia. If someone’s bloods are good and they have an active lifestyle, they are healthy, fat or not! ❤️💅🏼

Yeah, it was always put across to me that they go around or below the waist. Something about having them close to the breast area contributing to a higher risk of breast issues.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s why mine are always just around my belly button. Though most will have them on their thighs. Might also have something to do with fat in those areas.
</p>
<p>
To anyone else, if I&#39;m wrong please correct me. Don&#39;t want to spread scary misinformation.

Your result looks very good, when you are completely recovered it will look excellent, I have a question: How is your vaginal depth?
