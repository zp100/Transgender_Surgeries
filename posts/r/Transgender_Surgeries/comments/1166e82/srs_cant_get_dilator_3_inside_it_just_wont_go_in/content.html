Are you having any difficulty with #2? Keep using that for now. My surgeon told me that the first three months you can still size up. I suggest you try contacting a pelvic floor physical therapist to help with sizing up.

2 goes in without difficulty when I had started #2 it took me half an hour and a lot of struggle and pain for it to go inside. Now it goes in without much difficulty.

O.k. why woud you even think that there is a hard line until you &#39;can go up&#39;.
</p>
<p>
I know im not at all on topic here. But you can always work on on going uo in size. A neo vaginal canal doesnt suddenly become a brick that cant strech. Itd all muscle

Yes and no, scar tissue will harden if not stretched and massaged properly early in healing. Sometimes these scar rings require surgical revision if they aren‚Äôt dilated properly or don‚Äôt heal well.
</p>
<p>
A lot of it is dependent on surgical technique. My surgeon‚Äôs technique results in a scar ring close to the introitus, so dynamic dilation (stirring the dilator) is recommended to soften it up.

See? Thats a great answer!
</p>
<p>
Id wish people here woud more often think about that different techniques have different outcomes. I also had a small scar ring, but i coud just push trough that and never had problems since.

That‚Äôs the problem. The entrance of the vaginal canal isn‚Äôt stretching which I‚Äôm trying to size. The tip of the dilator just won‚Äôt go in.

I kinda had the sameISH thing.
</p>
<p>
Went to a checkup. Turns out i just had a small &#39;circle&#39; that was kinda not stretchy. The doctor showed me (he was frankly beeing auite rough). It did bleed a TINY bit but afterwards i havent had problems at all anymore.
</p>
<p>
Can you feel arround with your fingers? If yes, you coud maybe figure out if its also just a bit of tightend skin/muscle

Positioning is important. Are your knees supported? If not that can cause your pelvic floor musculature to tighten up making insertion difficult. Try making a nest with pillows. With your knees bent, wedge the pillows under your knees from the outside. It&#39;ll take all the weight off and help you relax everything.

Takes me about 4 minutes to get blue to max depth. Once I do that, I switch to green for 6 minutes and finish with orange for 9 minutes. Later sessions I just do green and orange, working up to 12 minute hold on orange by the end of the day.

Do exactly what your doctor told you. An add a lot more. Vaginas are suppose to be wet and because you‚Äôre is man made, it doesn‚Äôt have that kinda wetness is needed to dilate. It‚Äôs why when I was told I had to buy a stock pile worth, I just went to the vulvoplasty instead.

This is what worked for me, and I still use the same method now, 5 months on with the larger orange soul source.

Tried dynamic dilation? Bit by bit, and not necessary to make it the 1st week.
</p>
<p>
One week it&#39;ll be just few cms in, next maybe 2 cms more, next maybe the same, and then the next it can be that your almost there. I reached the whole depth with my larger dilator this way.
</p>
<p>
Just open the entrance slowly.
