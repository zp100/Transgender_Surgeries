Lovely staff, the worst part honestly was getting the drip in and feeling seasick after the drugs wore off. Still feels like I’ve been uppercut in the abdomen tho.

Honestly just be there for her, the worst part for me was getting the drip in because my veins were being evasive so I was glad my bf was there for that.
</p>
<p>
Help guide her around after surgery. I basically felt (still do I only left a couple hours ago) like I was seasick because of the drugs. She’ll also be very hungry and thirsty after so stuff that’s easy to stomach will go down a treat.

Congratulations.
</p>
<p>
I’ve got almost nothing in the wiki on New Zealand, so I’ve a few questions. Who was the surgeon? How much did it cost? How long was the wait list? Did you need psych letters?

Umm I had Dr Omid Yassai. It’s publicly funded so I paid nothing. I was signed up last October, and found out 1 week ago haha. And no psych letter needed.

Is his name spelled correctly, and do you have a link for him?
</p>
<p>
I found Dr Omid Yassaie who&#39;s in urology, and I&#39;d guess his full name is Omid Seyed Yassaie.
</p>
<p>
Is this the hospital?

Look I’m not sure, our medical system isn’t like pick and choose or shop around unless you’re going private. That’s just where my district health board does a lot of surgeries. Not sure if someone else underwent the same surgery in my DHB they’d have him or someone else since it’s such a straightforward outpatient procedure.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have my letter with his name on within reach right now to double check spelling sorry.
