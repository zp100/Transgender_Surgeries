Fair warning, I need to go into graphic detail ahead, you have been warned.
</p>
<p>
So, this is going to be a doozy and an emotional roller coaster for me, so please be kind. I had my vaginoplasty done in April of 2023. Dr Bradley Erickson left me with what amounts to a meat canyon with vaguely vagina features at the bottom. No joke my outer lips are nearly 3 inches deep before you get to what barely passes as inner labia. I had infections which he ignored for 9 months before I finally fired him from my care team. I brought up my infection in 7 different appointments with him. I went to obgyn 2 weeks later. By then the infection was so bad that when I expressed that I had an infection, the obgyn doctor told me she didn‚Äôt need me to tell her that, as she could smell it across the room. She told me this to reassure me that my concern was valid and that Dr Bradley Erickson was in fact wrong to ignore my infection. I can‚Äôt even pee right because this imbecile put my urethra underneath my inner labia, which he also fucked up, my inner labia is just a tight o ring of flesh. The fuck up with the urethra is so bad, that as a woman with a vagina, I pee on the floor while sitting on the toilet. I have to pee folded over with my belly touching the toilet seat to avoid peeing on the floor. It‚Äôs that bad, and no, none of this is an exaggeration. This is all genuinely this bad.
</p>
<p>
I need to know, can I seek recompense for his fuck up and negligence? Can I seek to have my insurance pay for reconstruction of the vagina due how horrendously hideous it is, and that it looks nothing like a vagina? Does anyone know a lawyer that might take my case? My insurance has already told me they will pay to have the urine issue fixed as well as the cause of the infections fixed. Thankfully I finally know what is causing the infections and can manage it until a more permanent resolution can be reached.
</p>
<p>
A last note to any trans women in Iowa, I know Dr Bradley Erickson is the only surgeon in Iowa that performs vaginoplasty. It‚Äôs not worth it. Go somewhere else. Do NOT let him do to you what he did to me. It‚Äôs not worth the pain, the mental trauma, the misery, and embarrassment. No matter how much longer it takes to go somewhere else, do so. Don‚Äôt let him do this to you.

Thanks for the heads up Hun so sorry for what you have gone through üôèüôèüôè I too live in Iowa and I had a bad dream about him botching my vagina so I think I&#39;m sticking with the Thai doctors.

You could sue him for malpractice and negligence. Talk to a lawyer, you honestly might win yourself a big settlement

You could absolutely sue and you definitely should, there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind you‚Äôd win. hell, if I were you I‚Äôd also report him to the board of surgeons in your state (or whatever the regulating body is‚Äîi‚Äôm not american, sorry) because issues of the construction aside (which you could sue for alone and still likely win), he ignored your infection long enough that you‚Äôre honestly very lucky it didn‚Äôt cause sepsis. He didn‚Äôt just neglect your needs, he endangered your life by doing that. That‚Äôs very real grounds for him to lose his license. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you.

Former paralegal who is also trans. The folks here talking about suing are oversimplifying.
</p>
<p>
Med mal is super specific to fact pattern and jurisdiction. Lawyers will often consult for free since these cases work on commission. Be emotionally prepared since very few MM cases actually get accepted because of how hard they are to prove themselves and in court and how expensive they are. Definitely start moving forward with your insurance and a new surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I hope you reach out to handful and they think there‚Äôs an actionable case. I‚Äôm so sorry for what you‚Äôve endured.
