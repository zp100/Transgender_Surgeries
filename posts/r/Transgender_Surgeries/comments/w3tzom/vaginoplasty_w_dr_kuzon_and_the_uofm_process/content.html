Hello “Alphabet Mafia” Redditors,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m documenting my journey through transitioning at UofM &amp; will be using this &amp; future posts to give a more recent log of what it is like. As an initial note for this post, I&#39;ll try my best to update it as things progress with my recovery.
</p>
<p>
Most of what is written below was the week or two leading up to my surgery &amp; I&#39;m adding things as the day goes on. I&#39;m posting this now to answer AMA questions while I&#39;m still pre-op &amp; have free time before surgery tomorrow (7/21/220) &amp; I&#39;ll do my best to do some main post edits to consolidate info &amp; questions prior to going under. I&#39;m currently working on compiling images, but I at least wanted to get this out there for people to read &amp; ask questions as I&#39;m working on the photo album/timelines. Ultimately, I hope this helps the LGBTQ community somehow, whether that is within Michigan or abroad. So if after reading through the post &amp; you have questions, leave a comment &amp; I&#39;ll answer it as best I can. I hope to have another post-op journey post &amp; AMA for any initial post-op questions &amp; my commentary on the process.

This IS A GHOST/BURNER account. Meaning I may not answer questions as quickly as
<strong>
YOU
</strong>
may like, but will answer them as quickly as I can, as well as edit this post to add the answers to frequent/common questions down the line.
</li>
<li>
I wish for this to also function as an “
<strong>
Ask Me Anything
</strong>
” (AMA) thread while I&#39;m Pre-Op still. I&#39;ll edit this post with links to my future (&amp; separate) posts which would relate to anything post-op to make it easier to navigate back &amp; forth from segments of documentation, &amp; post-op “Check-in AMAs” (i.e. 3 month check-in, 6 month, 1 year, 1.5 years, etc.). I want to try my best to give a “live” &amp; more recent testimony &amp; documentation regarding the journey &amp; my experience with Dr. Kuzon. Especially since there is little information I was able to find about his work (i.e. recent photos, testimonies, AMAs, etc.).
</li>
<li>
I want to have a
<strong>
full recent &amp; documented record of my experiences
</strong>
<strong>
within the Michigan transition process
</strong>
. The cities of the medical facilities I used will be more vague (mainly mental health facilities, since UofM information is fairly easy to find), as to not have those offices bombarded with contact requests where it is not necessary or appropriate. Seeing your SPECIFIC professionals is the best route as they already know your history &amp; would be better to build off of, rather than switch providers entirely &amp; start from square one. Not to mention availability of the facilities &amp; personnel that I particularly went through.
</li>
<li>
I want to
<strong>
provide a photo album
</strong>
account/link (something) as a reference point to my entire journey (body changes, hair removal, &amp; healing post-op). At the time of researching Dr. Kuzon of UofM, there was not many photos of his work out there. Many other doctors across the world, as they are easily found on reddit
<strong>
.
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
I found there are
<strong>
very few photos of Dr. Kuzons work (&amp; yes, including the TransSurgeriesWiki Page
</strong>
. Yes, there is a transgender resource link that DOES link to Dr. Kuzon info, but from when I checked it today, there was not much info. Not to mention recent thorough entries of the experience (rather than questions). At the time of looking for those photos, through reddit &amp; Google search criteria looking for his name &amp; state information as requirements, there were only a handful of photos. 3 or 4 from a one user which the reddit posts were deleted (which I found those on archival websites) &amp; one other regarding a surgery that seemed to &#34;go south&#34;. I have my own opinions on the matter, but ultimately I&#39;m happy that they are seeking out/found the surgery that will work for their revisions
</li>
<li>
Those photos were 1.5 years old when I originally saw them. At the time of writing this, they are now about 2 years old (they were originally posted January 2020). The last photo posted, was at 6 months post-op recovery. That put it by now at a 2 year old surgery healing, &amp; there is no new photos. So, I want to provide a more recent, consistent, &amp; thorough account of the experience with comments to each point of the recovery process &amp; to not “fall off the face of the earth” for providing new healing photos/updates.

That said, I wanted a more thorough documentation of the experience, surgery, recovery, hair removal, &amp; more for the greater trans community to see &amp; use as a resource.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I want to provide more up-to-date
<strong>
first h&amp; experiences of in-person interactions
</strong>
&amp; experiences with Dr.Kuzon, the UofM facilities, other medical staff, &amp; hurdles I had experienced. To provide these stories &amp; insight to help other transgendered people navigate &amp; prepare for their journey within the Michigan system/UofM processes or to adapt them to their own journey throughout the US or abroad.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Provide copies of my resources &amp; information documents
</strong>
to HOPEFULLY help current &amp; future patients. I have mild experience in Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets. So I made my own recovery spreadsheets to help track things such as:

<li>
Dilation schedule
</li>
<li>
Friend visitation sign-up &amp; more
</li>

The intention when I developed it was to be a one-stop-shop for any of my friends/family who wanted to learn about my transition, being non-binary, &amp; what it all entailed

. I have provided a BLANK version of that document to be modified, improved, &amp; used by others in their transition journey

This spreadsheet can be used to consolidate information specific to your journey, family, friends, &amp; others to help in your support network (your “Care Team”). With that out of the way:

Initial Journey; “How’d you know you needed to transition?!”:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Since most ask this question, I want to provide this context. I wanted to add this testimonial since everyone has a different experience to when they found out who/what they are (or how they are supposed to be). Non-Binary identities are something I have found from talking with others not in the LGBTQ community to be something that is harder to comprehend, &amp; may this can help some future person in their understanding.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m Non-Binary. I use They/Them pronouns. I came out in 2019 to friends, but knew I was “something else” in 2015 (more detailed story below). In 2019 I started my journey, 2020 was “Day 1” of HRT (split up the medications, more details below), April 2021 was when I received my final letter for referral to surgery (You need 2 in Michigan), &amp; surgery is happening in Mid-July 2022. The hang-up for the 1 year “delay” from the referral letters to when I would get my surgery, I needed the “all-clear” from the laser hair removal tech that treatments were done.
</p>
<p>
I don’t want to go into TOO much detail, so as to not clog up this post from more important information, so I&#39;ll do “key event” summaries/stories.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
2013-2015 - I started dabbling into the “spicy” side of my sex life &amp; discovering more of who I was, what I liked, &amp; my identity. As a kid, I was raised in a religious household where being outside the “cishet norm&#34; I was raised &amp; guided to be was shunned &amp; hated upon. Having this religious upbringing &amp; environment indoctrinated me to have certain points of view, behaviors, &amp; beliefs that caused further mental &amp; behavioral issues later in life (that I&#39;m actively managing). Being transgender was NOWHERE in my life while I was young, nor was I really “aware” of these options/community prior to this timeframe of self discover when I was 21-23 y/o in college. When I was in college &amp; I started discovering my interests &amp; pleasures (physically &amp; mentally) were more aligned with what would be considered typically female &amp; started looking inward to my own issues &amp; insecurities. I struggled with my own self &amp; body immensely. As a result (it coming from an unhealthy standpoint) I got SUPER-FIT. “Cut &amp; Trim” as the gym-folk would say. However, despite working out 2-3hrs a day &amp; 7 days/week. I still was not happy or comfortable with my own self or my body. I still hated it. Hated my gender/genitals, &amp; actually didn’t like using my original plumbing while intimate with my partner at that time &amp; even had a hard time finishing during sex. I started looking at MtF bottom surgery during this relationship, but it terrified me for some reason. At the time, I didn’t want to do it, but I kept finding myself drawn to it &amp; researching it. I wasn’t sure “what I was”, &amp; didn’t have something to identify with, identify as, or even a proper descriptor. I was “ok” with everything from the waist up, but hated from my hips down.
</li>
<li>
2015 - Moved to Michigan. I got involved in the kink communities. I learned this next part of myself from an educational course hosted by this “spicy” organization here. It was in that class that I discovered that there were things OUTSIDE of the binary (*disclaimer below). It was when an artistic cartoon-style example of “Cboi’s/CuntBoy&#39;s” popped up that I had my epiphany. In my head screaming, “YES! THAT! That is me! That is who I&#39;m inside, who I want to be!”. That was when I discovered Genderfluid &amp; Non-Binary identities. When I met my new girlfriend in 2017 (we have since separated), she helped me explore that side of me more. I knew that I was not Genderfluid as by the examples, testimonies, definitions I found; I was not fluctuating between presentations. I knew who I was inside, but not necessarily HOW I presented. I was still learning more details. However, since I knew I wasn’t “fluctuating” between presentations (or saw myself doing so in the future), Non-Binary seemed the better fit for me. * Regarding Cboi’s, friends within the LGBTQ circles enlightened me to the history of the term back then. Previously, it was used as a derogatory term to trans-masc &amp; FtM people. To some I have spoken with, it is still a touchy subject/term. I have also found there is a growing group of people who love the term &amp; own it. To me, I own the term &amp; I see this group of people &amp; this term being in a current state of evolvement, similar to the term “gay” about 10 years ago (in a sense). Gay used to be a slur/insult back in high school &amp; college for my area. The term has since been reclaimed by the LGBTQ community. For me, I see that “Cboi” may be in a similar state. I like the term Cboi, but I have also heard other alternatives as well. Just a quick clarification (also, reddit post relating to the term here:

</li>
<li>
2017 - Met the new GF &amp; she helped me explore more. Tried on her sports bras, some of her panties, went shopping for my own, &amp; some more stuff. I was finding that the sports-bras were actually very gender affirming &amp; I felt more comfortable shirtless &amp; wearing a sports bra, as opposed to not wearing one while shirtless (still pre-HRT). I liked how female underwear looked/felt, but hated that I still had my original plumbing.
</li>
<li>
2018 - A FWB I made in the LGBTQ circles was helping me explore. I was finding myself going back &amp; forth again, researching MTF surgery. I didn’t want to fully transition, as my issue was my original plumbing from the waist down. However, no doctor seemed to be open to the idea of doing such a surgery if you were not presenting female full-time. I knew I was not female, I was non-binary. It was discouraging to have the things I wanted to make myself happy in life essentially “not be possible”. I did DEEP research on femboy alternative HRT &amp; presentations: supplements, workouts, micro-dosing meds, consent based HRT doctors, etc. Dr. Powers is known in the LGBTQ community &amp; is in Michigan using the “Informed Consent” model, &amp; I wanted to navigate the possibility of alternate HRT to get the bottom surgery I potentially wanted, but keep the male-born chest I had. By the time I got through to Dr. Powers for appointments, there was about a 6-9 month waiting line just for a consultation. I got in the queue &amp; kept looking for other avenues. I found my psych/therapist office, they signed on for me to get HRT. My psych signed on 4 months later (she was swamped with other job tasks) which caused a delay &amp; thereby my possible surgery date. By the time I got these letters, Dr. Powers contacted me to set an appointment, but I was already further along than if I went to Dr. Powers by this point &amp; declined. I had been looking at endocrinologists who could take me ASAP that were local, problem was none were educated on the “alternate-gender” presentations (I use that loosely to cover Non-Binary peeps &amp; other post-op alternatives). The ones I found initially could not comprehend that, &amp; constantly kept trying to throw me on a higher estrogen dose for a full female transition, which is not what I wanted.
</li>
<li>
2019 - Found an endocrinologist with UofM &amp; with the help of that FWB, we determined that there actually may be an alternative method to HRT, at least in terms of dosing. My BIGGEST fear was chest/breast development. I didn’t want that. All other “side effects” of estrogen were totally ok with me. My friend worked me through it. My worries were surrounding things like swimming, where I didn’t want to wear a female swimsuit. My friend asked if wearing a t-shirt to cover my chest would be a problem. “No… i guess not”, &amp; my fears were quenched. I finally my appointment &amp; started on JUST a T-blocker (Spiro; 100mg 2x/day. 1 morning. 1 night). The reason? If I didn’t like the changes, I could stop &amp; my body would still be as it was before I started the HRT. When I woke up on day 3 while taking the T-blockers &amp; did not have morning wood; my reaction was, “HELL YES!”
</li>
<li>
3 months later, the endo check-up appointment happened &amp; I asked about “the smallest estrogen dose I could possibly have”. To essentially test run it. They said, depending on how early I stopped, no chest development would occur (or at least barely noticeable). I went with it. 2mg 1/day. The first week was terrifying as my chest started to “bud”. It was nerve racking. I was getting in my own head &amp; seriously debating whether to stop. I had to lean on my friends to work through the terror. After that 1st week, &amp; seeing photos of myself (documenting changes over time at 1 month), I was actually OK with the changes, but kept monitoring. As I knew &amp; came to term for myself that if a certain level of development occurred (around a C-cup), I would do a top surgery removal. After 3 months on Estrogen, I was actually OK &amp; fairly happy with the chest changes. The skin &amp; body odor changes were noticeable after 1 week. Touching &amp; feeling normal everyday things thinking, “WTF is this sensation!? That’s new!”.
</li>
<li>
2020 - 2021 - Further personal experimentation occurred. With the dosing of the HRT I had, I tried other things (still steady w/ 100mg spiro; 2x/day, 2mg estrogen; 1x/day). I did tucking &amp; liked the look. I knew hair removal was a long process so I got started in October of 2020 as soon as I had indications that surgery MAY be the right decision. At the same time I started cutting &amp; styling my hair in different fashions. If for some reason I didn&#39;t do surgery or that it wasn’t right, I still didn’t want pubic hair. So it was still a win/win for me. This was all another step for me to find myself. I went further &amp; did a compression panty in December 2020. This particular one had padding to give the illusion of being AFAB. When I looked down, that was when I had the first real indication that surgery might ACTUALLY be the right step for me. I was with the right therapist &amp; kept my mental health professionals in the loop the entire way. It also provides a paper trail for me to use later on if needed.
</li>
<li>
In April of 2021, I tried a compression bandage, made by “Unclockable” (
<a href="https://unclockable.com/">https://unclockable.com/
</a>
). The first time using it was at an LGBTQ campground among some mutual friends. This campground demographic tended to be HEAVILY gay males. This place was the first time I felt comfortable enough to wear more femme clothes &amp; try on female bathing suits. I took a leap of faith in trying out those items &amp; more visible presentations of being androgynous with a slight female lean. Think butch female who had top surgery, that was my goal. While in the tent &amp; setting up the bandage for the first time while laying down, once it was set in place &amp; I let it set for 30 minutes (as I planned on swimming); I knelt in the tent &amp; looked down. Seeing a more compressed &amp; smooth version of myself. The closest I EVER got to see my lower body as if I were AFAB, I had a wave of happiness hit me. For about 10 seconds before the realization that I knew &amp; felt my original plumbing was still there, when a bigger wave of sadness hit me BECAUSE I knew it was still there. I knew at that moment, surgery was what I needed. Another point of joy was when I went to go swimming. I entered with friends as support &amp; when I walked in, I noticed (&amp; so did my friends) that a majority of the males went quiet &amp; looked over. I knew this because normal chatter with the music DJ playing suspiciously got quiet for bit. It was funny &amp; very gender affirming, because it accomplished my goal. I want people to look at me from a short distance &amp; just go, “Question Mark?!?”. During the summer, I also got in on the REQUIRED Zoom call with other prospective transgender surgery patients, Dr. Kuzon, other staff, &amp; the hair removal technician that Dr. Kuzon typically refers to get the “all-clear” that hair removal is done.
</li>
<li>
2022- Here things REALLY picked up, the main hair removal tech said I would need a few more hair removal sessions &amp; be good to go, “likely ready for April”. Keep in mind that I did NOT go through this technician from day 1 (
<strong>
**Note Below
</strong>
). April came, got the “All-Clear”. May turned around with the call from the surgery scheduler with UofM &amp; confirmed the dates. I wanted a trachea shave at the same time &amp; noted that in an initial call with the scheduler in November of 2021. Somehow the note never made it to my file. However, due to scheduling issues &amp; that note not making it in my file, the schedulers could not coordinate that, they did not have the C.T. scan of my throat, &amp; the consultation for that was scheduled in February of 2023 (***
<strong>
Disclaimer/Note Below)
</strong>
. I finally had the dates, but leading up to this I was working on my previously mentioned spreadsheets to help me track information. So it was time to release the info to trusted friends to be able to help with recovery.
<br>
<strong>
** My advice on hair remova
</strong>
l, if you have indications of wanting bottom surgery… get in with ANY hair removal tech that will treat transgender patients to start. This way the ball is rolling &amp; cutting down on possible delays in getting the surgery. I found a good chunk in the metro Detroit area do not treat AMAB or transgender people, so you may need to make a fair amount of calls to find the right facilities. UofM has a resource sheet with hair removal facilities, but it is not up-to-date last I checked. So 2x check &amp; make the calls.  Also keep in mind that not all laser removal is made the same. The machine that the hair removal technician used for me (the same tech present in the required Zoom call for MI), is the “Candela GentleMax Pro”. If you&#39;re a good candidate, this machine works well, in my experience
<br>
<strong>
*** My advice for any &amp; all surgeries you want
</strong>
, don’t make my mistake. Verify EARLY that all notes on file are correct &amp; reflect your desired surgeries, that way you aren’t needing a 2nd surgery for something that can be done at the same time.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Some Other Specific Information:
</h1>
<p>
<strong>
Hair Removal:
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Best way I can describe the sensation is “like a small pack of bees stinging the area all at once”. The removal is done in bursts: Zap, move, zap, move, repeat. The head of the laser that zaps the hair is about the size of a quarter, &amp; they move it to treat the entire area. Sample Youtube Video:
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/pvucnjx4">https://tinyurl.com/pvucnjx4
</a>
</li>
<li>
Make sure you follow the directions &amp; advice of the hair removal tech. Avoid the sun. Do not tan. Avoid certain skin/hair treatments. They will provide specifics when you start removal sessions.
</li>
<li>
From my research, avoid &#34;Ideal Image&#34; facilities. The areas I wanted to hit were the face/neck, underarms, &amp; full Brazilian. They quoted (iirc) around 12k USD. Which is high for my liking &amp; from other testimonials online (trans or otherwise) was super high for the services you got. Yes, they have a lifetime warranty for the treatments, but further digging into the operations &amp; customer reviews, a lot of former customers were not happy with the staff or the results. This was across general searches for the company/facilities as well as other searches on LGBTQ/Trans related subreddits. Furthermore, if laser hair removal was not enough &amp; electrolysis HAD to be done in order to have permanent hair removal for the surgery to take place...a lifetime warranty wouldn&#39;t be needed. At least that is my logic, because if it is &#34;permanent enough&#34; for the medical professional industry to not have to worry about hair re-growth in the vaginal canal... than it is &#34;permanent enough&#34; that a lifetime warranty should not be necessary. Unless they are using a sub-par laser or sub-par techniques to remove the hair.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
Hormones:
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you have an endo that is not understanding of your identity or body/identity goals, try to inform them or find a different one. I went to a few different endos before I ended up with UofM. The other endos didn’t understand my Non-Binary identity, &amp; what I was looking for. I was not about to get medical care from someone like that. Your PCP may not need to be changed, but your Endo 100% (imho) needs to understand. Bring images, articles, anything you can to help educate them if needed. Some call it overboard, I call it preparing &amp; being willing to educate them before having to hop to a new one (not to mention wait lists &amp; scheduling)
</li>
<li>
There is no “One True Way” for transitioning or HRT dosing. I started on JUST a T-Blocker before going on an estrogen dose. Even then, it was a low dose of estrogen &amp; I&#39;m happy I went at MY pace. This is not a race. It&#39;s a journey. Go at the pace you need in order to be comfortable with the changes. Do not push/force yourself harder than what you&#39;re comfortable or ready for.
</li>
<li>
Yes, if you do masturbate/self-pleasure (not kink shaming as I&#39;m kinky myself) you&#39;ll have to re-learn how to do so (in a sense) &amp; how to orgasm. Since the sensations &amp; physical changes to your body will affect what USED to work for you. Also, yes…the intensity &amp; sensations of your finish will be different than what you&#39;re used to
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Various Medical Professional Experiences/Notes:
</h1>
<p>
In order to NOT give too many specifics on the professionals I used, I&#39;ll give some general information &amp; more specifics where it is appropriate
</p>
<ul>
<li>
All my medical professionals (non-UofM. Such as mental health, laser removal, etc.) were within the Metro/Suburban Detroit area &amp; scattered across different cities; Rochester Hills, Livonia, Northville, &amp; a few others. This was due to MANY apartment changes over the time of my transition as a result of jobs &amp; the pandemic. Your medical professionals don’t all have to be under the same roof or city for treatments to occur. Does it help with gas &amp; travel? Yes, but having the right medical professionals to help you along &amp; that are “in your corner” is more important (imho)
</li>
<li>
In my research across Google &amp; Reddit regarding Dr. Kuzon, one of the things I saw (semi-consistently) were complaints about him/staff. These testimonies &amp; comments were several years old, but I wanted to know details. Unfortunately, the complaints were vague online. I did get to question Dr. Kuzon &amp; the others in the Zoom call about these. The staff response was that Dr. Kuzon’s bedside manners are very blunt &amp; come off as cold. All other transgender patients on the call (current &amp; former surgery patients) of Dr. Kuzon could corroborate that &amp; agree that he can come off somewhat abrasive. Keep in mind, his services in doing these surgeries is a HIGH DEM&amp; thing. So he is a busy man &amp; it makes sense that he may come off this way as he is likely extremely busy with a high volume of patients &amp; needing to make all the appointments. After having met with him in person, I can also corroborate he does not have the best bedside manners. However, I don’t blame him &amp; I fully understand
</li>
<li>
In regards to recent surgeries, there is a REQUIRED Zoom call you have to take in order to get on the wait-list/&#34;in the system&#34; for surgery at UofM. If you&#39;re considering Dr.Kuzon, get into this meeting ASAP. In my meeting I had some older &amp; more recent post-op patients of his. All were able to comment first h&amp; OR second h&amp; to people they knew who have had surgeries by Dr. Kuzon. All of them commented they were happy with the results both in function &amp; appearance. 3 first h&amp; accounts &amp; 2 second h&amp; accounts were noted for the call I was on. UofM medical staff on the call noted that MtF full depth bottom surgery is “his bread &amp; butter”. He does 1 or 2 bottom surgeries a week &amp; has been a part of the UofM transgender care services program since 1995. So he is extremely experienced &amp; skilled as he has been doing this surgery for decades
</li>
<li>
Dr. Kuzon also has minimal to no photos of his surgeries online. I mentioned this earlier in the post that there is only 2 people on Reddit (logged in the TransSurgeriesWiki) with photos. Since there is minimal photos of his surgeries, this becomes something that
<strong>
MANY
</strong>
in the transgender community (&amp; subreddits) are concerned/hesitant to possibly go through him. However, of the photos I could find (a more recent one is provided in the required Zoom call presentation). I was happy with what I saw. I unfortunately cannot find the screenshot of that particular example to provide here. He also stated that aesthetics for the neo-vagina will vary from person to person, &amp; that there is an infinite number of variations of even normal AFAB genitals out in the wild. So you may want the “ideal” look seen in various spicy media, but your results are still likely to be within the realm of normal to what is naturally out there
</li>
<li>
Furthermore, on the photo references, Dr. Kuzon stated that he does not take or post photos of his surgeries. For two main reasons
<ul>
<li>
1st; even if the patient gives written consent, he refuses to take them from a moral/ethical standpoint
</li>

2nd; by taking the photos, he would control of them &amp; what gets posted online. He could theoretically take the best looking ones &amp; post them online, skewing public perception of his work &amp; attract more patients. He avoids this entirely by not posting anything, &amp; results of post-op patients will vary due to each person&#39;s genitals/reconstruction &amp; how their body heals (i.e. not everyone is circumcised or is “well-endowed”). He obviously cannot stop those who wish to post their results, but that of course is their prerogative
</li>

<li>
Since I&#39;m someone who plans on taking bigger toys (as I have zero interest in AMABs), I asked if there is
<strong>
ANYTHING
</strong>
that can be done while still pre-op that would help this desired outcome. Such as stretching the penis/skin, Viagra, or something I was not aware of. Dr. Kuzon stated that the human body is very flexible in modifications &amp; he used the examples of ear lobe stretching or head lengthening through compression of the sides (which I had no idea was a thing), but that nothing can be done pre-op that would help facilitate this (
<strong>
****Author Comment Below)
</strong>
. **** That said, it does bring the question that when you&#39;re POST-OP, since you don’t have tissue that could be “holding you back” such as a urethra, erectile tissue, etc. It would suggest that post-op, with frequent dilating &amp; slow stretching, that this MAY be feasible, but I cannot say anything about this, couldn’t find anything credible online, nor would I endorse it; since there is no solid answer I have to provide or medical professional comments about it that would support that idea.
</li>
<li>
Dr. Kuzon did clarify the types of bottom surgery including the pull through method, vulvaplasty, zero depth, gastro-vaginoplasty, full depth vaginoplasty; &amp; the related healing, complications, &amp; traits of each one. He prefers the full depth penile inversion as it “makes like become like&#39;&#39; &amp; is the most commonly used
</li>
<li>
From things I dug up online &amp; from transgender comments across social media, there are a few counts where the soul source dilators needed for post-op ARE NOT provided by a clinic or the surgeon. I confirmed that Dr. Kuzon DOES provide them. However, there is one caveat. He provides them one-at-a-time. The first one is provided on the first clinic visit. On your second visit, an inspection is made, &amp; then if deemed appropriate (based on your progress of dilating &amp; healing) he gives you the next one. This is repeated until you eventually have the full set. This way you aren’t pushing yourself harder than what your body is ready for &amp; prevents damage or complications in healing
<ul>
<li>
During your first clinic visit, you&#39;ll be provided the first dilator AS WELL AS the cleansing supplies needed for post-op surgery care. Through my initial paperwork, there did not seem to be any indication that the cleansing supplies were provided, so I bought a kit &amp; prepped for it. I wanted to clarify this bit of information for any potential/future patients of Dr. Kuzon.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Dr. Kuzon can provide written referral for physical therapy after surgery so insurance can cover it. He advises going to physical therapy &amp; will also provide the “return to work” papers when they deem you&#39;re ready
</li>
<li>
When speaking with my friend (AFAB), she has a Nexplanon Implant for birth control through hormone release. Which posed the question, is there such an option for an estrogen implant for post-op patients? Thereby saving the hassle of missed pills or shots (for those that are needle phobic)
<ul>
<li>
Unfortunately, according to endo, there is no such option &amp; the Nexplanon implant is using a different hormone &amp; that would not substitute for a post-op transition.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Colon cleanse supplies are bought over the counter. The clinic provides you the list for the supplies, mixing ratio, &amp; steps to do it during one of your office visits. This cleanse process is to be done the day before surgery, so request that day off work as a part of your medical leave/absence.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
General Notes during the Pre-Op process (anything prior to surgery):
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
I&#39;m working on an album of body changes &amp; hair removal results. This is to help show the timeframe of the hair removal, how my body reacted, &amp; to give the scope of what you MIGHT see as you go through your hair removal journey &amp; physical changes you may see.
<ul>
<li>
Slight disclaimer to the photos, these photos are also during a time where I was battling my eating disorder, heavily working out (2 hours a day, 7 days a week), while ALSO working a very physical job 70+ hours a week &amp; doing an overnight job just to make bills &amp; keep on top of my transition.
<ul>
<li>
Not uploaded as of the original post. Should be up later, check the end of the post for the link as it will be added there.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
When coming off your HRT, you&#39;ll likely be tossing &amp; turning in bed. you&#39;re
<strong>
required
</strong>
by UofM surgery staff to be off of HRT for a MINIMUM of 21 days prior to surgery. When you go off them, you go through ESTROGEN WITHDRAWAL and there are side effects (no resources were transgender specific, but hormones are hormones regardless of the body). The ones that affected me were paranoia, anxiety (which I already managed pre-transition), depression (which I already managed pre-transition), &amp; some psychosis. On day 3, I could have sworn I was hearing some things. I felt on-edge &amp; slept terribly. I debated cancelling surgery, panicking over what my reaction would be in the hospital &amp; more thoughts &amp; terror regarding the surgery. This lasted for about 1.5 days, but then it all went away. So if you&#39;re going through this process when prepping, give yourself time. Rest. Reach out to friends to vent your thoughts &amp; feelings. Having this support helped IMMENSELY. I got past it, still going through with surgery, &amp; am still on track.
</li>
<li>
When coming off the HRT, you&#39;ll likely have atrophy &amp; shrinkage with your original plumbing, and you&#39;ll start to regain normal male functions. Remember that pesky morning wood before HRT? Guess what, that will come back within a week &amp; your skin is not as pliable as it once was. So you MAY be woken up in the middle of the night from pain &lt;insert cowboy accent&gt; “
<em>
in them their nether regions
</em>
”. This is from your skin “stretching” essentially because you were not having that morning wood like you used to. Just a note to be aware of that. Your body will eventually readjust to it prior to surgery, but know that you may not have the best of sleep in the first 1-1.5 weeks when coming off HRT.
</li>
<li>
Going through the UofM process, you DO NOT need to wait for hair removal to be done in order to get the prior authorization letter from your insurance. Some people advise to wait so that MAYBE the hair removal facility will take insurance, which requires a note from the surgeon as the hair removal becomes a medical necessity to do the surgery. Which should cause the insurance to cover it (even partially). If you can handle it, start the hair removal process as soon as you can &amp; continue on schedule for the sessions as they need to be done at particular intervals.
</li>
<li>
I would ask your insurance &amp; your surgeon&#39;s office to put the prior authorization inquiry through when you&#39;re on your last or second to last hair removal session. Some of those prior authorizations have an “expiration date” &amp; you don’t want to run into those issues of coverage AFTER your surgery. I did mine earlier so the notice technically “expired” but I still have the paper trail to cover myself.
</li>
<li>
Keep all paper records. Even if you later scan them &amp; save them in a hard drive, the hard drive can get corrupted.
</li>
<li>
Get the ball rolling on Short Term Disability coverage NOW. My employer does not provide it (nor are they required to) because I&#39;m “contract/temporary”. I tried the private market &amp; everyone said EITHER “they don’t provide it on an individual/private basis” or “we cannot extend you an offer due to your pre-existing condition” (which for me was depression &amp; anxiety). So i got completely screwed &amp; will be out of work with ZERO supplementary income &amp; am going to be scrapping by.
</li>
<li>
If you&#39;re thinking that you can cheat the system by SAYING you have done the laser hair removal when you actually have not, don’t bother. Dr. Kuzon does an inspection of the surgery site, hernia check, &amp; full physical about 30 days prior to the surgery date. He can tell if you have gone through hair removal or not. No matter your shaving capabilities or use of waxing. He made vocal notations of these during my inspection (as he had an intern &amp; surgery personnel with him during the exam) for record keeping. You cannot cheat this. Nor is it in your best interest as it can cause complications &amp; issues in your neo-vagina if you SOMEHOW cheat that system
</li>
</ul>

Notes about the coordination spreadsheet I made/used:
</h1>
<p>
This document was formatted in a way that only the main author can edit the entire sheet. Any cells that did not need editing by friends/family were protected. That way no accidental deletions or edits could be done to the file &amp; mess things up accidentally
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I used a Google Spreadsheet since it is easily accessible online for your trusted group of friends (my “Care Team” as I called it)
</li>
<li>
As a part of my notes to those I trusted with this spreadsheet, I kept it to a select group of people since I would be vulnerable (mentally/emotionally/physically). However, I encouraged them to put in their name (minimally) &amp; their contact information. This way, if something happened &amp; something fell through, people can call each other to make sure it is covered
</li>
<li>
Additionally, not everyone needs to see my new genitals. So the doc was restricted, so i approved everyone due to sensitive info like locations, clinic info, contact info, etc. It helped build the trust with my “Care Team” to put their info in. The version in this post is free-to-view to copy/edit for your own google drive
</li>
<li>
Each section was color coded. The donation &amp; cash app was something I included so were options for friends/family to help financially or by helping get supplies. Some of these resource links will be kept in as a reference point for other people out there who are looking at the UofM system.
</li>

Notes about the Post-Op Care Supply List:
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
There is an initial supply guide provided by UofM in the PDF link provided at the bottom of that spreadsheet (also linked to at the bottom of this post). HOWEVER, there are additional items that I acquired that were NOT on the list provided. These were things I found during my Google &amp; LGBTQ subreddit searches as well as conversations with other post-op transgender people I know. The idea being, “UofM may recommend these, but these are probably the basics. There are likely other things that would be helpful that may not be on the list”. I cannot speak to some these yet but I&#39;m listing what I found online trans testimonials and conversations I had with post-op patients &amp; what they wish they had. Link to a Google Document below.

Again, I hope this post helped or helps the LGBTQ community at large. Please remember this is also an AMA too, so ask questions &amp; I&#39;ll answer it as best I can &amp; as quickly as I can. I go in for surgery on 7/21 (tomorrow), so I&#39;ll be silent for a while once I&#39;m post-op, but will open another AMA for initial post-op questions &amp; my commentary on the process.
</p>
<p>
Edits (as they come; dated for ease):
</p>
<p>
7/21 @ 630a: arrived at the hospital. I will keep comments open until I discharge to allow more time for people to ask questions.
</p>
<p>
7/26 @8:30a: confirmed discharge for 7/27. All healing is going well. I will do the updates of my personal photos, additional info I got from UofM personnel, and the body/hair edits I promised.
</p>

I will be doing a 1 month post-op discharge update/AMA. Thank you all for letting me contribute

Also, this is an amazing post. Kudos for pulling it all together. (I&#39;m not nor ever going to be a UMich patient but it will be a great resource for those folks.)

As a point of disambiguition, you may want to clarify/distinguish Michigan as the &#34;M&#34; in UofM because there are a lot of M states which use the same formulation. (Like, for example, Minnesota, to name one.)

Never heard of them, I will need to forward over the information to my endo and see what she says. I imagine that I would stay on my pills for a while to see how my body handles being &#34;testi-less&#34;. But I GREATLY appreciate the info. I can add that input to my Post-Op Check-in.

I&#39;m not sure biote are any good. You want the largest size pellets you can get and they don&#39;t say. 50mg is currently the largest in the USA, but Dr Will Powers is looking at getting larger ones made - they will probably be really good compared to whats currently on the market.

This post is kind of a godsend tbh, I&#39;m going to be getting my surgery through dr. Kuzon, and I was right about to make a post asking for any other trans people&#39;s experience with him as a surgeon. I respect him not showing his results on those ethical reasons, but I really appreciate you taking the time to give a first-hand account. One question I do have, last I saw the waitlist was about a year to get surgery from him, how long were you on the waitlist for? Is it still that long?

So the google spreadsheet info of the dates of completion ARE actually MY dates of completion. When I got the go ahead from the hair removal tech (as I noted in this post) that was when they put my on the waitlist to get the call and schedule the appointments. In this particular case, the reason that happened was because EVERYTHING ELSE was done. I had already done the pre-approval, hair removal (or at least was WAY ahead of it to minimize delays), HRT, etc. So my wait was closer to 2/3 months from the time of being put on the waitlist.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind this eta will (for the most part) always be fluctuating because of real-life stuff. For example, because of the pandemic in 2020, people who probably had their surgery originally slotted for that probably were pushed back due to medical personnel having to pivot duties and hospital beds for the pandemic. Granted, things with the pandemic are more steady and handled with the vaccine development, there will always be that slight unknown.
</p>
<p>
By best advice, any and everything you can do to get ahead of possible delays (i.e. hrt, hair removal, insurance pre-authorization, etc)... do it. The hair tech kuzon primarily refers to states it usually takes about 1.5 years for full hair removal. But there is going g to be some variation due to skin types, hair types, etc. Some pre-authorization letters are only valid for a certain time, mine were only valid for 5 months, so try and time it as close as you can for when your potential one call for scheduling will come through. The office will put one through anyways, but the fact you have one ahead of time minimizes any concerns or worry for them about insurance coverage.

Of course, it&#39;s because if this &#34;flying blind&#34; thing that I stuck with it. Because what you see online with him is not exactly going to be 100% the reflection due to him not posting pics because of his moral policy. Which again, I heavily respect.
</p>
<p>
But I see the lack of stuff (and the few negative review) online similar to reviews for stores online. You don&#39;t always see the 4 or 4 star stuff BECAUSE they are happy. Or in this case, there is the factor of &#34;I don&#39;t wanna show my hooha to the world&#34;.
</p>
<p>
But negative ones are more likely to be present because you are furious and want to warn people. So I am doing a thorough documentation of EVERYTHING for this. ❤️

Now that I am not AS bed ridden and sensitive to sitting, I&#39;ll be able to make more updates. I am working on compiling and editing photos that I have to make proper timelines. Along with commentary. I hope to have this all done while still at home recovering, but definitely done by the time a &#34;1 Month Post-Op QnA/Update occurs&#34;.

My deepest apologies for the delay in a reply. I am working on a 11 month(ish) update.
</p>
<p>
Broadly speaking:
</p>
<p>
- 5  months: I was able to orgasm
</p>
<p>
- 6 months: i was on the Large Orange Dilator (#4, i believe it is referred to).
</p>
<p>
- 10-11 months: I am starting to get some sensation in the public bone above the surgery site. Orgasms are much easier to acquire.
</p>
<p>
I should have the presentation file updated this week with a relevant post.

Sorry if there is confusion moderators, i originally had a messaged that shortened URLs were not allowed, so I edited to fix that. But it would save because is &#34;wasn&#39;t under 40,000 characters&#34;, but I verified that it was. SO I made a second post, that apparently was taken down due to a duplicate. So sorry for any issues/confusion mods.

They are not mine, inside the TransgenderSurgeriesWiki, they link to these photos on Reddit, but the photos/posts were deleted. But I knew they were there and wanted to have those and provide my own recent photos over the next few years.
</p>
<p>
I just added a image cache on the google drive link to those images too.

Thank you for this. I&#39;m currently in the preoperative hair removal stage, but have had a video consultstion with Dr. Kuzon, and am grateful for your experience. I&#39;ll look forward to seeing what you have to share after your date, and wish you nothing but the best of luck.

I can&#39;t speak on the FFS side of things as I never had FFS. But if it is bottom surgery related, I&#39;m happy to provide insight.
