I posted a flurry of dumb questions in the leadup to my FFS last year, so I should probably give something back in the form of a quick account of my experience at the 2pass clinic with the sometimes-controversial Dr. Bart van de Ven. This isn&#39;t going to be one of their weird hyper-glowing reviews that they supposedly encourage people to give in for discounts or something (though I didn&#39;t get offered that at all, so who knows) or an outright scare story, so take from it what you will.
</p>
<p>
I went to 2pass for full facial feminization surgery minus jaw work. The lead up to my surgery was a bit disorganized, with some confusion surrounding blood tests and a cancellation of their airport shuttle service close to the date, and relatively slow response times from the clinic - though I understand that&#39;s not super abnormal. Despite the name &#34;2pass clinic,&#34; it&#39;s confusing labelled something entirely different on the actual sign on the building, though what exactly it was has already escaped me.
</p>
<p>
The clinic itself is a nice environment, with a clean, modern vibe; the only questionable choice is a kinda weird giant world map they have in the middle of the guest room area where patients are encouraged, sort of aggressively, to stick pins in the location of their hometowns. The rooms, even the small ones, are spacious, and they have a TV service with programs from multiple streaming services, relatively new movies, and channels from all over the planet. I was able to watch Japanese TV, which was very comfortable to me.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bart was 15 minutes late to my initial appointment with him, and he came across as kind of rushed and harried, an impression that would persist for the remainder of my time there. He also has kind of a disaffected air, though I might put this down to cultural difference. We discussed my procedures and the specifics of what I wanted (I had some kind of particular requests) and he took some pictures of me before running them through a computer program a few times until it looked how I wanted. He printed out some documents for me with information on when my surgery would be happening and some pre and post op instructions, and that was it.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t see him until the next morning when it was time for the surgery. This also happened 15 minutes late. I was led down to the operating room where I reiterated my instructions to him, and then was put under.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t see much of the recovery area because my face was covered, but the immediate post-op care was fine. A nurse was nearby at all times and offered me ice cream, and the pain was manageable. Dr. Bart stopped by very briefly to ask how I was feeling but once again seemed disengaged and in a hurry. After this, I was taken up to my room, where I was closely taken care of (painkillers given, cold compress on face replaced, face cleaned) for the first night by the staff and nurses. I have basically nothing bad to say about the experience of staying in the clinic itself except that the food, while healthy, is not very varied or good, and that the in-house carer, Petra, is aggressively helpful about everything. While this is good in the sense that you always have someone there to help with even very awkward problems (I was having a lot of trouble getting the blood out of my hair with everything completely numb, so she went as far as helping me in the shower) it can also be difficult to get time to yourself. Regardless, it&#39;s infinitely better than staying in a hotel.
</p>
<p>
I met Dr. Bart two more times, once for a very short checkup a few days in, and later for my final review. On both occasions, he once again seemed preoccupied and in a bit of a hurry. At one stage, I experienced a minor scare with my health, during which an attempt was made to contact him, but he was apparently unavailable and simply instructed the nurse to give me medicine to calm my nerves without further thought. It turned out fine, but it seemed like kind of a dubious response. I also later heard that my surgery had been a bit rushed, having been done in about 2/3rds of the operation time, and that my forehead incision, which is meant to be stapled closed, was only sutured. While this was a relief when I heard it, since the process of getting the staples removed is presumably not great, it did strike me as kind of dangerous, since the wound can easily open in the first few days following the surgery if something goes wrong.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I am happy with my result, and felt that he listened to my requests instead of just doing what he felt was &#34;best&#34; like a lot of cosmetic surgeons will when you actually get to the table. A later CT scan also confirmed nothing was weird; he&#39;s obviously a very talented surgeon on a purely technical level. However, I can&#39;t shake the impression that if anything had gone wrong, he might have cut a few more corners rather than giving me the close attention I needed. I later learned he performs multiple significant operations, FFS and otherwise, every single day. With a schedule like that, his behavior became less surprising to me-- Although this could be normal, and I could just be ignorant of standard practice.
</p>
<p>
His prices are also a lot lower than something like Facial Team, so if you want good-quality, aggressive surgery by a western surgeon and don&#39;t mind taking a slight risk, you could do worse.
</p>
<p>
TLDR; Office somewhat disorganized, clinic good, result good, surgeon skilled and attentive, but brusque and probably stretching his time a bit.

Yep. Screws. If I push against the skin, I can also feel a very, very slight disturbance in the surface that lines up with the location of one of them.

I did hear the horror story about the type 4. If it&#39;s true, it doesn&#39;t seem impossible to me that he might&#39;ve been in a hurry or messed something up a little bit and decided he didn&#39;t have time to fix it properly and, in his (questionable?) opinion, that it wouldn&#39;t make a difference. That&#39;s only based on my impression of him, though, and I guess you have to take accounts like that with a grain of salt.

Yeah, that&#39;s why I was asking and thanks for letting people know that it doesn&#39;t always happen.

Yeah, I was actually surprised to find out that Dr. Rossi only does 1-2 FFS surgeries a week (which does make sense because otherwise I don&#39;t know how Amanda wouldn&#39;t go crazy with dealing with more than 2-3 patients at a time :-)

Dr. Rossi does seem like a better deal if you can deal with the stress of a hotel and getting to Argentina, although my impression is that he&#39;s more conservative with his bone work, somewhat. I ended up choosing Bart because he&#39;s close and the clinic takes care of everything so well more than strictly his virtues as a surgeon.

Are the sutures/staples on a visible incision? I thought staples left more scarring.

I couldn&#39;t speak to that either way, and I do believe they use staples as standard practice, and just didn&#39;t in my case for unexplained reasons. Regardless I do have a visible scar under my hairline, and left over stiches having been slowly falling out along it since my surgery. I tend to scar worse than most for my age, though.

Staples are generally easier to use, require less skill and are quick. They do however more often than not leave a larger scar, although as always YMMV A
