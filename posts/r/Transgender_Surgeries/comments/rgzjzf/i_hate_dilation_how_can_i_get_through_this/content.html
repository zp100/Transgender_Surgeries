Use pads for easy cleanup, I would just put on a pad and not even wipe or anything.
</p>
<p>
Watch movies/TED talks/TV, etc, you will eventually learn how to dilate while sitting in a chair and or using your foot to hold in the dilator. Laying down with your phone is the move in the mean time.
</p>
<p>
It does get easier.

Use pads for easy cleanup and try and pass the time with things like YouTube and Netflix.  Perhaps even talk with someone on the phone while you do it.  I would LINE chat with my grandmother in Taiwan sometimes when I dilated.  3 times a day dilating and douching is a pain however you kind of just have to endure it.  Rest assured, it does get easier.

The first couple of months are the hardest, when you will be able to go down to 2/day it will feel like you are finally getting your life back. At 1/day you will feel amazing, but it&#39;s a long and hard journey.  In the meantime, look after your MH, these initial weeks, at least for me, were really quite hard.  But it really does get way better!

I put together a guide to dilating with a ton of tips, hopefully, one or more of them would work for you.

I can&#39;t promise you anything but there&#39;s a fairly high chance it&#39;ll get better, it&#39;s super scary early on and you&#39;re in pain, that should get better with time. Focus on the fact that it&#39;ll get better, that&#39;ll make it easier to deal with.

First of all congratulations on your surgery. I had my surgery at Parkside too (with Mr Bellringer, I think you were with Miss Rashid?) 23 weeks ago. So to level with you, the first eight weeks up until your follow up appointment can be tough going, not only the punishing three times a day dilation routine but you need to keep a watch on your mental well-being too, aka the oft reported &#39;post op blues&#39;. These hit me towards the end of week four and hung around like an unwanted guest at a party for nearly two weeks. That said as I had been warned about them, I was prepared and could recognise them for what they were which helped immensely. As my energy levels started to rise (the anaesthesia really takes it out of you) so the blues faded away to be replaced by satisfaction and happiness that at long last I had the right anatomy.
</p>
<p>
As for the dilation, I found that sticking to a routine really helped. My first session depended somewhat on when I woke up but I always tried to have it done by 10AM, my second was at 4PM and my final one 10PM. As I am still married (she&#39;s amazing btw). I set myself up in a spare bedroom to give me privacy and set up a hi-fi, TV and DVD player. I used the time as &#39;me time&#39; to relax and to get to know my new body. It was also an excuse to listen to the music I wanted to listen to, watch rubbishy TV or work my way through my DVD collection of box sets. It helped that I never found the dilation particularly uncomfortable and it got more comfortable as time went on. I also found that by crossing my legs I could hold the dilator in place with my thighs, freeing my hands for other things such as a bit of surfing and social media on my phone or tablet (I even called my bank once). As for the clean up I dilated lying on a bed with a puppy training pad underneath me (You can buy packs of 100 from Pets At Home for ¬£12.99) after I had done my dilation it was an easy matter to dispose of the soiled pad in the bin.  I would then douche lying in the bath, wipe myself down with a damp face cloth I used especially for this and dry myself with a dedicated towel too. I used to allow an hour for each session, so I never put myself under any pressure.  It does get easier and now at 23 weeks I&#39;m down to once a day using the blue to start and then the largest (Orange) dilator for the full 20 minutes. If I can though I very often still dilate twice a day. I take the view that you can&#39;t really over dilate but you definitely can under dilate. As an older transitioner I&#39;ve waited nearly all my life for my vagina and I&#39;m determined that it&#39;s going to be the best that it can be. Good luck and best wishes with it all. My DM&#39;s are open if you want to chat or ask anything more - I&#39;m happy to help xxxx

tysm ü§ç and yeah i was with Tina the anaesthetic has finally worn off me (finally) im able to sleep again &amp; its alot easier to dilate now i dont feel dread anytime im about to do it i‚Äôve accepted it mentally the only thing i hate is how uncomfortable it gets after 15 mins of keeping it in
</p>
<p>
definitely i feel so much better seeing what i have now i‚Äôm not so depressed as i was before i can finally be happy and feel normal again
</p>
<p>
ty for the thing about the pads! i was using regular bed ones but the puppy ones are so much easier to buy and find ‚ò∫Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
hope things keep going well for you take care ü§çü§çü§ç

Yes. It is annoying and a little painful at times but it‚Äôs essential. What color are you using? I‚Äôm a little over 3 weeks since GCS and I‚Äôm alternating between the blue twice a day and green once.
</p>
<p>
My way of taking my mind off of the dilation is either a book (in my case a Kindle) or the TV. Pads help and I go through them a lot. I keep focusing on the endgame. It will be better soon-ish. Till then make it as less bothersome as you can. Not a great answer I‚Äôm afraid but practical for me.

Think of it as a time to relax and enjoy listening to music, audio books, podcasts, or watching Netflix or YouTube while dilating. Relaxing will make it easier on your muscles to dilate. And you may look forward to continuing to listen or watch your favorite programs for your next dilation session.

It definitely sucks at first, but eventually it just becomes part of your daily routine. McGinn actually has her patients do 4x a day for 6 weeks then do 3x a day for 6 months which I&#39;m just getting over now! Finally, getting to bump down is truly amazing and makes it all worth it.

it‚Äôs not really painful for me just a bit stinging when the lube falls down over my stitches the worst thing is how long it takes having to get the dilator in at full depth then waiting 20 minutes holding it in place then running to the bathroom to douche and clean my dilator it‚Äôs so annoying for me personally 2 days in im so annoyed by it
