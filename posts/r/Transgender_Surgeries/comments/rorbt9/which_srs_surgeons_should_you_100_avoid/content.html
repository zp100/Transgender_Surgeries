Don’t know the situation with Dr Ramineni but just had bottom surgery with him and my result has been absolutely beautiful and his office staff was excellent in making sure everything was done right for my insurance company.

The problem is not the results when things go well, but how he handles when things go horribly.

In regards to the Ramineni situation, the person having the issues presented what appeared to be the early signs of a fistula to him and it didn&#39;t seem to he addressed. The person then went home multiple states away when it became clear that she had a fistula very clearly. Speaking again to him he suggested not dilating for a week and seemed unconcerned. Being so far away getting proper post op trans care was not an option and the person has a visit with Dr ramineni on Monday and surgery to happen shortly there after.
</p>
<p>
The worry is huge about something having gone wrong and him being neglected towards it. Concern when considering if you have complications but generally barring major complications it seems his results are incredibly positive and well received. Pros and cons to consider

I went to Bluebond-Langner &amp; Zhao in June and have nothing but good things to say about my experience and results with them. Their support staff at the hospital were great, all friendly staff, supportive, and helpful. The room was nice and private, with control of the lights, curtains, TV, meal ordering, etc through a tablet. I’m not particularly very fond of NYC but there are worse places to be. The results are amazing, nice depth, appearance, and considering its still healing it’ll only get better. Orgasms I thought were going to be an issue but it takes a little time for the mind and body to readjust. Once you become familiar with the change and … I guess become one with that change, they are wonderful! Aside from the two week stay at a hotel in NYC, and the remainder of my deductible, my insurance (MVP/Cigna), covered the cost. Surprisingly though, the payments I made to NYU were refunded to me.

One of the benefits of their team is Zhao uses a robot for the internal work, so its less intrusive in the body cavity, which helps with healing and recovery. There is a video of the robot in action, I believe on YouTube, and you can see it perform the actual stitching. The robot does leave a little scar around the belly button, since they anchor it in place at that point. Its slowly fading and isn’t too obvious. Bluebond does the pretty outside girly parts. 😊 Pain was minimum except for day 2, I could not get comfortable enough to sleep and the nurse said I was maxed out on pain meds. She stuffed a couple of pillows under my knees and that did the trick, took the pressure off that area and I was able to sleep. Every 4 hours someone came in check on me, take my vitals, give me meds, etc. It didn’t really disturb my sleep much since it didn’t take me long to fall asleep again. I had to restart a few movies several times because I kept falling asleep. They have you get up to walk pretty quickly, first over to a chair, to the bathroom, around the room, and finally down the hallway. When you start roaming the hallway you know you are on the home stretch. Oh, one other thing, since you have your own room, you do not have to wear a mask while in your room.

What&#39;s the issue with Crane?
</p>
<p>
I had penile preservation peritoneal pull through with Wittenberg and she&#39;s been great. Curious about Crane because he&#39;s one of only a couple of other surgeons who does penile preservation, and would like to know if people need to be warned away.

I think a lot of the cases against Crane were FTM phalloplasty related.

In Montréal there&#39;s Belanger who&#39;s probably 2nd choice... not much about her either way... and Brassard who&#39;ve I&#39;ve heard is very talented... I&#39;m supposed to have Brassard on January 10th, I can always post updates if that&#39;s something people are interested in.

I feel the same, but I actually don&#39;t have more than the 2 options as far as coverage is concerned... and I&#39;ve heard more less-than-favorable accounts about Belanger overall...

A friend of mine recently had her surgery with Belanger and from what I can tell she is very happy with the results.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious about the unfavorable reviews you&#39;ve heard. I&#39;m in a similar position where Montreal is my only covered option and based on what I&#39;ve heard I&#39;m inclined to choose Belanger.

He has been doing it since the 1990s, so him and Meltzer are the most experienced.  Brassard and his mentor Menard really pioneered the one step surgery.   Meltzer was the hot ticket, circa 2005;  but he may have fallen off according to recent reports.  Plus he does a two step procedure that many women only went thru part one which leaves a very basic structure.  Today that is not as acceptable with so many other options.

I&#39;ve read enough research papers to know surgery length generally decreases with experience. Most of the more experienced surgeons have shorter operating times. So it&#39;s not as alarming as it sounds.

I was just pointing out it&#39;s not necessarily a red flag if the surgeon is experienced because they tend to get faster at it over time. I might be worried if it was someone that was new to the field. I wasn&#39;t even saying it was a good thing it&#39;s just kind of normal

There’s lots of other very experienced surgeons around and he’s still half their time.

I know a lady that went to Brassard and she was extremely pleased with his work and highly recommended him to me. My insurance doesn’t cover Drs in Montreal, so he ended up not being on my list of possibilities.

Regardless of what surgeon you choose you need to have an aftercare plan. I keep seeing people having surgeries many miles from their home and when things go wrong they lack the ability to immediately return to where they had the surgery to get help. If you live in Texas and your surgeon is in Russia you should consult with your primary care physician in Texas to establish an aftercare plan I.S.F. (incase shit fails: wound care specialist, urologist, plastic surgeon, gastroenterologist). You do not want to seek these people out after the fact. You need to meet with a care team beforehand.
</p>
<p>
Unpopular Opinion: it might just be me but there appears to be a ton of people having this surgery who were on the free lunch program. Y&#39;all I&#39;ll be trying to run your ass back to work after 6 weeks because you don&#39;t have enough money/savings/support/stability to sit your ass down and properly heal. My grandma would say &#34;baby you still WIDE OPEN&#34;. Y&#39;all women need to s-i-t d-o-w-n and heal fully before trying to work and have sex.

She&#39;s been investigated and somehow hasn&#39;t lost her license yet. Jezebel.com investigated her. I personally have reported her to the PA Dept of Health for HIPAA violations. Thanks for other people&#39;s medical records.

My wife recently got her SRS there and I just hope everything turns out okay.  I read a lot of bad things but we kept her cause she was able to see us this year when we met the out of pocket maximum so it was fully covered.

I personally would not have SRS in USA IMO(Don&#39;t have to agree/disagree but that&#39;s just me) that&#39;s why I prefer Thai doctors like Dr. Suporn/Bank(Which is now my official choice and been my choice since high school lol)

Not my results, but since you list surgeons to consider, Dr. del Corral was the Dr in a very positive post recently. First time I have ever thought &#34; yes, me, me!&#34; When looking at this sub.
