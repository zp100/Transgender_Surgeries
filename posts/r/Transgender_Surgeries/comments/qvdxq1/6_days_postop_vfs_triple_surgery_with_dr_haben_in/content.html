Hi all! So as the title says I&#39;m 6 days post-op from the &#34;Triple&#34; voice feminization surgery with Dr Michael Haben in Rochester, NY. Details here:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://professionalvoice.org/feminization.aspx">https://professionalvoice.org/feminization.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
Wanted to make this post to share my experience so far and try my best to answer any questions anyone has. Obviously I don&#39;t know my results in terms of my new voice yet (and won&#39;t for several weeks) but I&#39;ll post an update once I&#39;m cleared to start speaking again.
</p>
<p>
During my consultation he did the standard voice analysis, and determined (as I had guessed) that my natural voice fell just a bit below the average male range. Based on my exam and my natural range and where my voice breaks he said he expected to be able to get me the full octave of increase, somewhere around 185hz is where he said he was aiming for which is the low end of the cis female range.
</p>
<p>
Here is a recording of me reading the first part of the rainbow passage in my relaxed &#34;male&#34; voice:
<a href="https://voca.ro/1knoKU3LMR3Y">https://voca.ro/1knoKU3LMR3Y</a>
</p>
<p>
I think that&#39;s about all for now. I&#39;ll post anything else if I think of it and answer any questions as I have the energy to do so, still sleeping a lot :)

Will you keep us updated on results when you can start using your voice again? This is something I have a very deep curiosity about.

I absolutely will! I&#39;m cleared to start speaking, in a limited capacity, on December 10th so I plan to post an update then, but the voice I have at that date won&#39;t be the final product, so as best as I can I&#39;ll post updates every month or so as healing finishes and things settle

Physically I&#39;m back to about 75% as of today, just restricted from living heavy things until day 8 when the stitch comes out. I also don&#39;t heal fast due to my own medical history so I&#39;m taking it slow. Biggest part of the recovery is the voice rest, 30 days without a single sound out of my lips.

He does 3 procedures, and you can choose to have just one, or two, or all three of them. I chose to do all three, hence I got the &#34;Triple&#34;:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Feminization Laryngoplasty (Basically uses a laser and some sutures to shorten up the length of the vocal folds/cords thereby increasing pitch). This is also referred to by some surgeons as a web glottoplasty or Wendler glottoplasty.
</li>
<li>
Crico-Thyroid Approximation, which permanently tightens the muscles in the larynx that AMAB folx voluntarily tighten to get their voices up into falsetto range, thereby eliminating the ability to access the lower &#34;male&#34; range.
</li>
<li>
Thyroid Chondroplasty, AKA trachea shave or adam&#39;s apple shave, this is for cosmetic purposes and doesn&#39;t impact the voice.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first is done endoscopically via the throat, the other 2 are done via a 2 inch incision in the neck.

I had the same with Haben last year.  Sadly the results were that I ended up with my normal &#34;man voice&#34; but hoarse.  A really bad result, but still worth rolling the dice on VFS.  No regrets.  He&#39;s a good surgeon and I just got unlucky.

I am so sorry to hear that!! Do you think the stitch broke? I&#39;m horrendously terrified and paranoid I&#39;m going to do something to break it, I&#39;m being SO careful but I&#39;m literally like keeping count of how many times I let a cough get through lol

Oh gosh I&#39;m sorry to hear that was your experience! Mine was quite the opposite fortunately, he was very warm and pleasant to deal with, answered all my questions and I felt very well taken care of. I had some issues with more bleeding than was expected so I had to stay in town a few extra days and he booked me in for a 2nd post-op appointment just to make sure everything was solid before flying home. I did have some issues with getting mis-gendered by the hospital staff at Unity but they were great about correcting once it was brought to their attention.

Update day 8, the stitch came out today and my doctor at home said the incision is looking good! I don&#39;t know why Reddit doesn&#39;t allow photos in the comments...

It&#39;s certainly the largest one I&#39;ve ever had! It doesn&#39;t look that big in person, and over the course of the next year should fade to become pretty much completely invisible. As to why it has to be that long I&#39;m not sure! But I was told to expect 2-3 inches, and your comment got me curious so I whipped out my measuring tape just now, and mine is 2.5 inches so spot on in that range. In general I assume surgeons don&#39;t make any larger of an incision than is absolutely necessary to do the work they need to do since smaller ones heal better.
