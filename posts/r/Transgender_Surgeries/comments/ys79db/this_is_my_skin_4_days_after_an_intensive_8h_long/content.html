RIGHT NOW you NEED to get either Vaseline or Aquaphor gel and cover the whole scabbed area thickly with the ointment.  Keep it covered like this 24/7 for at least a week.  This is the #1 way to prevent scaring during the first week/two.  It would have been better if you started this immediately.  But DO this NOW.

So I had an 8 hour session on Monday. The clinic told me that my skin would look normal 3 days after the procedure. As it is now I think it will take 2 weeks or more. Does anyone here have similar experiences? My body and skin always react strongly to procedures. I am used to it. However, I am afraid of scars.

Looks like the are just using the heat mode and not blend. I had a place like that and it damaged my skin. Go somewhere else that uses blend.

And your skin looked like that afterwards? What happened in the long term? I haven&#39;t read anywhere that the blend method is gentler on the skin.

Yes, and it became pitted. it&#39;s still healing, but looked way better than it did. My experience is that blend it way better. Thermolysis can damage the collagen if they treat two hairs that are too close together. It&#39;s too much for the skin. Not usually an issue with other parts of the body.

They are using too high a setting and you are getting too many hours at once. I was seeing a person who refused to turn the setting down and it left me with oozing pox marks 5 days later. Find someone else.

They protect a surgeon who would pretty much let&#39;s screws through people&#39;s jaw in random angles and because of that the skin wouldn&#39;t reattach and the bone plus skin could easily get infected

I heard bad experience with electrolysis in this clinic. Take care. If you have any doubt about skin healing, send me a message.

Oh sorry to scare you! I was just asking because I recognise you from chatting on Instagram and there’s not many places that do long electrolysis in Europe.
</p>
<p>
I’m considering going to them! I get terrible skin resections even from just 1 hour of electro even if I go to someone really skilled. I’m so sensitive to it and have looked similar to this before and my skin didn’t scar

That is a lot to get done in one go but not unheard of. I can go about 4 hours on diathermy/ heat but I get it spread over a wider area. I also use TKTX numbing cream as I find it extremely painful on my face.
</p>
<p>
I occasionally have similar scabbing to you but normally only a small area at the sides of my lips. I use Wichazel gel the first day then Aloe gel for a week after. Stay out of the sun completely until it&#39;s healed ! Or at least use an spf 50 to prevent the scars from turning a darker shade than the rest of the skin. Most of it healed within a week but sometimes takes two to completely disappear.
</p>
<p>
Everyone is different but personally I find diathermy fine. It takes around 6 to 10 seconds per hair for my electrolygist to treat me. The alternative blend mode takes at least 20 to 30 seconds per hair. Galvanic is more like 30 seconds plus per hair and has a lower regrowth rate but is more prone to scarring.
</p>
<p>
I leave my face to the professional but have done my own arms and bikini line myself with a Carlton professional ultrablend. Tried Diathermy, blend, galvanic and galvanic with preheat and IMHO simple diathermy/ heat works the best for the majority of my hair. It&#39;s only the really stubborn thick ones that I use galvanic on, leave for 30 seconds to let the lye work and they come out a great.
</p>
<p>
Again, everyone is different and these are my own experiences.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure you will heal fine if you look after it as I said above.
</p>
<p>
Good luck x

I&#39;ve seen a few clients after some heavy thermolysis clear-cutting, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like this. I don&#39;t think you should go back to this practitioner.

Oh my dear that looks uncomfortable and must be stressful. I think it’ll be ok but you need to get it lathered in lotion to help it heal.
</p>
<p>
My advice.  - use galvanic multi probe electrolysis only. Thermolysis and even  blend is literally burning the follicle and can your skin. Over time I feel this risky for scaring even with an experienced tech  - make sure to keep sessions shorter. I know you want it all gone but don’t push your skin further than it can go. The damage if any will be on you.  - cleanse it with a non oil cleansing solution as oil will dissolve scabs needed for healing.  - use witch hazel for disinfecting healing.  - use aloevera for moisturiser  - make sure nothing above has alcohol in it!!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Drink loads of water pre and post treatment
</li>
<li>
don’t pick the scabs
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
- shave with electric razor if going over the treated area
</h2>

I used to go to a clinic that had three techs. One of them did that kind of job on me a couple of times and I stopped scheduling with her. The other two techs were a night/day difference in results. I have scars and bleached skin from the first lady I saw and after some drama, she was sent packing anyway.
</p>
<p>
Let them know that your skin did not work with their methods and you feel like you need a different approach, so you are seeing someone else. At least you can be reasonably assured that you won&#39;t see those hairs again! lol

Aloe vera gel or arnica will help with the healing and swelling. After every session, you need to apply a topical solution. Heat bad need to have blend. Don&#39;t freak out. everything is okay. You will heal, and no worse for wear. Just don&#39;t use heat like that.

I do ten hours in a weekend.  6 hours first day, 4 hours the next.  It never looks pretty, but it&#39;s never scarred, either.  Usually clears up in 3-4 days.  Although it is irritated for longer but nothing visible.

I do 2 hours sessions of thermo over the whole face and my skin is fine. It doesn’t get that damaged though.  I put ice, Aloex and vitamin E after the treatment.

A curious side question, do you all get knocked out for this? I do a one hour session with lidocaine and I can&#39;t tolerate much more. I can&#39;t imagine sitting for eight hours

How did you handle 8 hours? I struggle with even just laser for 10 minutes. You’re a machine! Keep it up

I want to get that done, I’ve been putting it off while I pay off my FFS.  It’s really unfair those of us with light colored hair can’t do electrolysis!
