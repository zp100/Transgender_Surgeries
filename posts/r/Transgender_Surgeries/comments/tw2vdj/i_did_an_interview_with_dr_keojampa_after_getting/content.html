Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed and will be reviewed by the moderators. A review will typically occur within 24 hours. This is because its a link post to YouTube and is commonly in violation of
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/about/rules/" rel="nofollow">Rule 4
</a>
. You can still find your post in your history, but it will not be visible in the sub unless its approved by a moderator. You can avoid automatic removal by making a text post and putting the YouTube link in the text of the post (please delete this post if you do so). The post will be manually reviewed (later) and must comply with rule 4, so please explain the what the video is about and encourage discussion.
