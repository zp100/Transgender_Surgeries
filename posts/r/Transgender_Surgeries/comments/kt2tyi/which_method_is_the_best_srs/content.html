I don’t really think there is an objective best technique to be honest. The best thing you should do is look at the things each SRS method (and surgeon!) can give you and compare that to what you ultimately want and see what SRS method and surgeon matches that the best.

I would (will) ask my surgeon to employ as much penile tissue as possible including all of it in the homologous tissue structures of my (future) vulva, and that if I have 1&#34; depth equivalent form penile skin and the rest peritoneal tissue, that&#39;s ok.  If that is 3&#34; ~4&#34; instead of 1&#34;, that&#39;s okay.  I want no surface penile tissue discarded if that can be helped, and I do not want it to be as stretched/stress as I have seen some.
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, even most of those turned out okay, but from the three-way mutually contradictory goals of appearance, sensation, and depth, for my preference all depth is to come from peritoneal tissue after the compromise between the first two is arrived at in the use of penile/scrotal surface skin.

No.  I used the words &#34;would&#34; and &#34;will&#34; and &#34;future&#34; to show I have not yet.  What I am certain of is I have read obsessively on the topic in trans biographies and surgeon&#39;s descriptions of their procedures for almost 40 years.
</p>
<p>
I was in fact first dissuaded from even considering transitioning by the description by one (then) well respected surgeon that he used the glans penis to create a cervix, because it looked kind of like one and the only purpose of the surgery in the first place
<em>
was so the trans woman had an aperture with which to please men
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
Things have gotten a lot better since that was written 50 years ago.  (And I mean I read it over a decade after it was written.)

It definitely does not produce more lubrication lol. It can sometimes produce more discharge (not lubrication) than average and require panty liners every day. But that&#39;s not uncommon for cis women to have to deal with, and imo is a lot more understandable of a risk than being completely dry all the time.

Not always no, but it&#39;s a risk of the procedure and there&#39;s never any guarantee that it will have moisture.
</p>
<p>
The only real con to the surgery is that it&#39;s more risky and that having to use panty libers every day (which again happens to plenty of cis women) is mildly inconvenient.

Depending on how much tissue they ripped off, a method that uses less tissue internally could give a better external appearance.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that it won&#39;t make much difference; your clit should get noticably more sensitive regardless of method (unless something goes really badly wrong), but you can&#39;t get back the extremely sensitive tissue that isn&#39;t there anymore.

How many needed to use lube?

When you get PPT you dispose of scrotal, penile and urethral tissue that can be used to create the vagina

<p>
False.  That is not a requirement, on top of which urethral tissue should firstly be placed between the labia minor up towards the clit.  If a surgeon believes that is necessarily true--that they must dispose of scrotal, penile and urethral tissue that can be used to create the vagina--then they need an emergency recto-craniectomy.

<p>
And yet many people who have PPT say they do not need lube, or only quite minimal lube.  I believe them.
</p>
<blockquote>

They use much of that tissue to create the vulva. What I am saying is  that you don&#39;t have the option of using that tissue for a later revision  graft if you experience vaginal complications
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And if you have used that for your vulva, you only have it available for a vagina graft if you are willing to immensely scar up and mutilate your vulva.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Most surgeons won&#39;t graft from peritoneum twice.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So what?  The  odds of needing it twice are already minuscule, and if for some reason the peritoneal tissue doesn&#39;t take there is always a duodenal flap.

In my anecdotal experience, vaginal wetness post op depends on the person. I did NI with Dr Suporn and I basically never use lube. I get extremely wet upon arousal. If I didn&#39;t, I&#39;d just use lube. It&#39;s not a big deal.
</p>
<p>
Regarding vaginal canal sensation.. I often feel mine is too sensitive. I almost wish it was less so, as sex and dilation would be so much easier if I wasn&#39;t so.. sensate inside. At the same time, I get vaginal orgasms from penetrative sex, so I wouldn&#39;t trade it, I guess. But PPT might honestly have easier recovery/sex life because of the insensitivity.

Cis vaginas have very few internal nerves and  non-pressure based sensation stops very soon inside. Having fewer nerves insides could be a downside if you don&#39;t care about being as close to cis sensations as possible, but it&#39;s the same as a cis canal.
</p>
<p>
Ppt also gives significantly more tissue to work with the actual vulva and lets surgeons use the tissue that would go inside of you in PI as part of your labia (although i do believe some NI surgeons do this too), which is what it&#39;s actually analogous too. They dont just yeet off all the tissue that would be used inside for PI, is repurposed as other tissue which can be more accurate aesthetically and sensationwise.
</p>
<p>
So yeah the only real downsides are slightly higher risk and not as good of a back up plan.

That’s very interesting that you say PPV is a benefit for people with CD.. I felt like my only option was PI.
