SRS update: Everything looked okay until today. My inner labia turned yellow and is swollen. Should I be worried or wait for things to heal? I am back in my country from Thailand

Looks like it’s healing. Do you have any new odor? Is the discharge changing with strong scent. My doctor always says infection when the smells change drastically.

I would say it’s just healing. The colors change so much down there during the healing process. Yesterday I freaked seeing some new colors when I was in my docs office. And they were like it’s totally normal. If it starts smelling or it starts to have an unusual amount of discharge I’d look into seeing your primary care doctor. Happy healing sis. Welcome to the recovery team. It’s a long road but so worth it. I’m at week 8 and still freak out over things.

Hi. Did you arrange for your after care before leaving for Thailand? From all the research ive done, it seems to me the doctors and surgeons in thailand arent big on aftercare, not even wanting to be bothered unless the whole surgery is just about come undone. And girls that go overseas, alot of doctors stateside either refuse to treat, or at the very least, dont want to treat girls when they return from srs unless they were notified pre-surgery. Judging from the pic you posted it looks really good. The yellowing could just be brusing of sorts Im not a medical professional but i would just keep doing what the doctor and nurses informed you to do for aftercare, keeping an ever diligent eye on it and keeping notes as to any worsening conditions such as bleeding, pus, foul smells, pain when you urinate and any loss of feeling or sensation of the affected area. Basically, anything that would signal an infection. Also, id be on the horn first thing in the morning and trying to find a doctor or even a nurse that specializes in after surgical care snd try to retain them for the next couple weeks, just in case. If you have to go to the emergency room, theyre probably not gonna be able to do much but keep you from dying. Sorry if i sound gloom.

You should do some more research, because that’s not true at all.
