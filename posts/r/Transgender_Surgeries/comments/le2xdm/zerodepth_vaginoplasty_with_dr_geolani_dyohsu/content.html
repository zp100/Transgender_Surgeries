I’m hoping to have  a consultation with her soon (waiting on one letter which was sent 2/1). I am interested in having a vaginoplasty. I saw what I think is your results and I think they&#39;re quite nice. If anybody has any experience with a vaginoplasty with Dr. Dy I would really appreciate hearing from them!

Good luck with your consultation!

You haven’t seen my results, just FYI.  I haven’t posted any images of mine online yet, and won’t until things are healed a bit better and I can show a slightly more long-term progression.

My apologies. Someone posted a four week old Vulvaplasty a little while ago. That’s literally the only picture I have of her work. Thank you for posting about your experience!

Thank you so much for your wonderful story.  I too have been thinking about this, and you described many of the things I was concerned about. This made me much more confident about doing it. Best, Christine
