Congratulations. Looks good. She is quite consistent based on comparing your result (and others) against mine. Expect the fourchette area to get a wee bit sore soon! Were you NHS or private?

thank you! went private yeah. fourchette is already a little sore and stingy, and in the photo you can see a little bit of dehiscence maybe? not the end of the world tho. everything is a bit sore and stingy right now but i’m so happy with it aesthetically.
</p>

and went private :)

Mine looked much the same at that stage, you look to be healing well. I thought I was going to get dehiscence but it healed fine apart from some stubborn granulation. Hope this gets addressed with Silver Nitrate at followup. Did you sneak in at the old price £15K? Several folks asking here of late re current cost.

yeah i have some this morning, bit of bleeding down towards the fourchette. just being gentle with it now :) i’ve otherwise been pretty mobile and going for some gentle walks!
</p>
<p>
my work insurance is picking up the bill so not sure. anaesthetist alone is charging £2.5k so i doubt it lol

oh fair! i *might* be on the insurance costing rather than the one you get when paying yourself, so i imagine it’ll be very hard to compare. i “booked” in august after a consultation in april so who knows…

Your GP should be able to give you some pain relief that works. Tell them what you have had done and they will probably give you whatever you want 😁
</p>
<p>
Cool packs helped me a bit when it felt like it was burning up down there.
</p>
<p>
Congratulations again and thank you for posting, I&#39;m back there soon so Tina can fix me and every post I see of her work gives me confidence that she can improve my result.
</p>
<p>
Huge hugs 🤗🎉🥳

tbh it’s nothing unbearable and paracetamol seems to be doing the job, so gonna keep on going. i’m a baby 😄 i’m allergic(?) to ibuprofen so they gave me parecoxib in hospital, so no anti inflammatory for me!
</p>
<p>
cold packs have been indeed fantastic. and thank you! ms rashid did a really fantastic job and i appreciate how tidy the suturing is, even if i have some dehiscence this morning lol 😅
</p>
<p>
best of luck!!

Ditto here. Proper panicking I was, but the process through to the actual op is very streamlined and my anethetist was great at creating calm patients. My HR was 56 while I was being canularised just 4bpm above my resting HR, that was down to the skill of the anethetist getting me relaxed.

oh wow! mine was running at a cool 125bpm. scared as hell but i kept talking to the nurse and anaesthetist about why i was doing this and what i was looking forward to. we bantered back and forth until he popped the fentanyl in and i was chilled out as anything :)

Funny, when he put me to sleep, I was like ner, it&#39;s no working, I&#39;m wide awake, then my hearing went funny, then next thing I knew I was on ma bed lights going past overhead.  Heard someone say that op had gone very well, then I was in my room. I was on my phone telling folks I was post op within 15 mins of getting back to my room and lived on pure undiluted elation for the rest of that day!! It did feel like I had only been out of my room for like 15 mins total though but the clock was telling me 4.5 hours had passed!!
</p>
<p>
I work in medical electronics (software/firmware) - different brand to what they use at Parkside, but still interesting for me to see it in use. I was likely going on about diagnostic cardiology. He was prob glad once I was sleeping!!

Wow I had so much more swelling at 1 week that&#39;s amazing! Looking impressively healed.
</p>
<p>
Definitely keep an eye on the fourcette I struggled as did many others. Dehiscence isn&#39;t the end of the world but it&#39;s super annoying!

Welcome to the club :)
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t do what I did and stick a dilator in because you were oblivious! It took a good bit of time and two rounds of silver nitrate for mine to heal properly but got there in the end.
</p>
<p>
If you watch out for hypergranulation and think it might be happening, I found manuka honey helped loads and might be worth asking the team about.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re welcome to send me a DM if you&#39;ve got any questions, but hope you heal quickly in any case x

haha yeah, i’m being a lot more gentle with my dilations and the bleeding has at least stemmed :) we’ll see. long way to go until my follow ups so maybe it’ll resolve itself without the silver nitrate! but i’m not bothered either way.
</p>
<p>
and yeah. what i’ve done is dilated, douched, washed with the shower head, dried thoroughly, then applied manuka honey followed by some barrier cream. now leaving it the fuck alone :)

Good luck! I found the hypergranulation tissue much more painful and annoying than the dehiscence itself but it sounds like you&#39;re on top of it. Despite the minor complications it&#39;s been an amazing experience for me and I hope for you too x

Hello… good morning! Hope life has now settled for you and everything is fine. I have surgery with Miss Rashid in April and was wondering if you could update me on your recovery and results so far?
</p>
<p>
Starting to feel a little anxious but still on a really good mindset and overall excitement for the next chapter of my life.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, hope life is feeling wonderful for you! Xx
