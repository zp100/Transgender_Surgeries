I had FFS with Dr. Keojampa on February 22nd and it was a great experience. He performed type 3 brow bone reduction, orbital rim contouring, rhinoplasty, sliding genioplasty, jaw contouring, and neck lipo. I am very happy with my results even with the swelling still in my lower face.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m happy to answer any questions anyone has about my experience.

Hi, pretty before and after, but I just wanted to ask if you requested subtle/natural results? (like on the jawline, maintaining gonial angle, etc.) Because I may be booking with Dr. Keojampa and getting subtle results is a big fear of mine

Umm I didnâ€™t specifically ask for subtle results, I was explicit in my desire for feminization though. I donâ€™t really know how much of a say you have in whether or not results are subtle or not, a lot of it just depends on your face and what can be safely done.

Hi!! Thanks for posting! Did he give you a cost for each procedure? Like for example, how much was the jaw contouring alone? Iâ€™m looking to have jaw reduction with him and canâ€™t get a straight answer from the secretary as to even a range of the price of that procedure alone, so I was wondering if you could help me ðŸ˜“

Hi I canâ€™t give an exact cost since itâ€™s constantly changing, but I think you can expect to pay 12 to 15k.

Please keep in mind that this doesnâ€™t include facility and anesthesia costs which are separate.

Unfortunately it depends on the facilities costs and how long you need to be under for anesthesia so I couldnâ€™t really make sense of the rates. I would definitely recommend doing consultations though, they give you an itemized quote with info for whatever is recommended for you. Itâ€™s also not a bad idea to have multiple consultations if possible just to make sure youâ€™re on the same page as the surgeon.
