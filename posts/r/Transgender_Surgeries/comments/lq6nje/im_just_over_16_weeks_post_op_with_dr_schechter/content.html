If you don&#39;t mind me asking, how are sensations? Like one of my biggest worries about that surgery are if I&#39;ll be able to feel a lot of pleasure post surgery. Sorry if it&#39;s a weirdly personal question. You absolutely don&#39;t have to answer it.

Nope, I&#39;m totally happy to answer that, I worried about the same thing before I went under.
</p>
<p>
The short answer is, masturbation and sex feel freaking phenomenal. He takes the whole nerve damage thing super seriously, literally the first question I remember him asking me when he came by after my operation was &#34;can you feel this?&#34; while he poked my clit with a q tip lol. He repeated this exam with every subsequent time I saw him, up until my most recent (and final) post op exam at around 14 weeks.
</p>
<p>
I was cleared to self pleasure at around 8 weeks after my sutures healed, and I was cleared for sex around week 12. It took a few tries for me to have an orgasm during masturbation, and some more experimentation to make it a regular thing. Even when I don&#39;t cum it still feels astoundingly good though.
</p>
<p>
I personally find that I need some stimulation on both my clit and my G spot in order to easily cum. I can cum just from clit stim but it isn&#39;t as easy. My boyfriend bought me a fancy rabbit vibe from Lelo that I&#39;ve been using and that does the trick really nicely.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve yet to cum during PiV sex with him but I think that&#39;s more of a mental thing since I have no trouble doing it on my own. We&#39;re still figuring out angles and positions that will allow me to stimulate my clit while he fucks me, but sex still feels astonishingly wonderful even without a full O.
</p>
<p>
I was warned that I might need to dilate prior to sex for the first month or so but I haven&#39;t had that issue. In fact, my first time sort of happened by accident. My boyfriend and I were just kind of grinding naked against each other. I wasn&#39;t sure if I felt ready to actually have PiV but I was so wet that he just kind of accidentally slipped in lol. Oh, and on that subject, there definitely is a decent amount of self lubrication but I still use lots of lube when I have sex to prevent chafing and friction.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m super freaking happy with how it turned out. I would absolutely recommend Schechter to anyone who asked. Hopefully that wasn&#39;t too wordy haha, I kinda got carried away ðŸ˜…

Oh wow I&#39;m so happy for you! Omg and this is so reassuring for me. I already have a really hard time with dysphoria so I was worries orgasming would be nearly impossible. Thank you so much for this info! Can you get to the g spot vaginally after the surgery? Also, do you still cum? Like from what I understand the urethra completely stays together along with all the stuff connected to it so I assume all that would still happen?

Do you mean do I still ejaculate? No, I don&#39;t. Or at least, if I do it&#39;s such a miniscule amount that I can&#39;t tell it apart from just regular lubrication.
</p>
<p>
I can reach my G spot with my fingers, if that&#39;s what you mean? I know that&#39;s not a thing everyone can do though, it all depends on your depth and hand/finger size. That&#39;s true of both cis and trans women.

That makes sense. So it is self lubricating? I guess that&#39;s also a thing that&#39;s concerned me because I&#39;m really self conscious about keeping myself clean down there. Is cleaning hard? And thank you for being so nice and letting me ask tons of dumb questions

No need to apologize. So, Schechter&#39;s team has you douche starting at about 2 weeks post op. For the first like, month I think he had me do a daily betadine douche followed by just plain water to flush it out. At some point I was told to go down to every other day, and after my incisions were pretty much healed and the sutures had all fallen out, they switched me to an every other day probiotic douche. It really helps with the smell and overall cleanliness. At this point she just smells like any other vagina. According to my bf it tastes just like any other vagina too, which I was totally worried about as well.
</p>
<p>
Depending on how often you&#39;re planning to have bareback PiV sex, eventually Schechter has you go down to probiotic douches once every few days (so like M-Th-Sun instead of M-W-F-Sun, for example). If your partner is finishing in you regularly, than you&#39;ll need to stick with the every other day, at least for the first few times you douche after. We don&#39;t use condoms so I&#39;ve stayed with the every other day schedule, but I was told they&#39;ll reevaluate in a few months. Apparently after a while, the flora introduced by the probiotoc becomes hardier and so douching becomes even less necessary.
</p>
<p>
As for lubrication, there definitely is a good amount of self lubrication. Not enough for me to comfortably have PiV without extra lube, but enough that I can get fingered just fine. They said the lubrication amount could increase as I heal further, but honestly at this point I&#39;m perfectly happy with it the way it is.

That sounds great. I&#39;m so so happy for you and you&#39;ve given me tons of confidence about possibly doing this in the future. Of course I still want to do a ton more research and (somehow) get the money for it, but you&#39;ve really helped me relax about some of the fears I&#39;ve had.

number one, it&#39;s gorgeous! number two - what technique did you go with and why, if you don&#39;t mind me asking? I&#39;m researching but it&#39;s kind of overwhelming, and tbh at this point I&#39;d be happy with anything so long as it wasn&#39;t the bait and tackle i currently have.

Thank you! This is a little embarassing but I don&#39;t actually know the name of the technique. He explained his process to me at my consultation but I&#39;ve since forgotten the name. He ended up having to take a skin graft from my hip, (I remember he was on the fence about whether he&#39;d have to) but he didn&#39;t use any colon tissue so it wasn&#39;t that technique. I can ask him at my next appointment what the proper name is if you&#39;d like.

I am lucky enough to have really good insurance, so the actual operation, hospital stay and care facility stay only cost me about $2000 dollars, the rest was covered by my insurance. According to my EOBs though the total amount billed was over 30 grand.
</p>
<p>
The pre op stuff cost way more tbh. I spent about 5k on genital electrolysis for that area, plus another hundred or so in co-pays to get my psychiatrist letters, plus probably another thousand or so on stocking up on all the post op supplies I&#39;d need. I was off work for 9 weeks too.

I won&#39;t lie to you, the post op pain was literally the most excruciating pain I&#39;ve ever felt in my life. I don&#39;t remember most of my time in the hospital post op wing but according to my mom I spent a lot of time begging the staff to kill me lol
</p>
<p>
The good news is that that horrific pain only lasts for the first few days and they keep you really drugged up during that time. After about day four it becomes much more manageable, and after about a week I was managing with just extra strength tylenol and ice packs. My sutures healed completely by week 7, which is about the time that the pain ceased completely for me.
</p>
<p>
My doctor said I exceeded pretty much every benchmark they had for healing timelines. I&#39;m about a decade older than you, so even if you don&#39;t have bottom surgery for another couple of years you&#39;ll likely heal even faster than I did.

Its not required, but it&#39;s very very expensive to get bottom surgery without it.

Hey there!  I have a consultation w/ Dr. Schecter soon, so I&#39;m very happy to see your results!
</p>
<p>
1 question: I already went thru 1 clearing of electrolysis, but recently found that laser is more effective &amp; less painful.  Their office said yes, you have to clear the area, but weren&#39;t too specific.  Any recommendations of cheapest way of getting this part done?  Thanks.
