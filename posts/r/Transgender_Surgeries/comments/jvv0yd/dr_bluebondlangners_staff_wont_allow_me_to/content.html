Is this common? Especially since I had my initial consult with her back in Oct, they said they were scheduling into 2021 and it took some time to get all my letters but I finally submitted them and now they say they want me to be more sure which doctor I want to go with. They‚Äôre now scheduling into 2022 but want me to wait until after my next consultation in February to schedule with them since I think I‚Äôm leaning pretty heavily towards her.
</p>
<p>
I feel like that is unreasonable? Well be midway through 2022 scheduling by the time I can call and actually schedule my surgery.

They want you to be sure you want the date.  Otherwise you&#39;re just taking it from someone else on the chance that maybe you&#39;ll stick with it.  It does seem a tad unfair, this being such a big surgery, but...I can understand why they&#39;d ask that of you.

Honestly that seems entirely reasonable to me. If you&#39;re scheduling a surgery you&#39;re at the commitment stage.

I didn&#39;t actually mention at my first consult that I had others.  I only ended up doing two, and did switch.  Some surgeons (e.g., McGinn) have a rather substantial deposit required, which helps make sure that you&#39;re sure.
</p>
<p>
It is unreasonable, but at the same time it&#39;s not likely you&#39;ll get them to change their mind.

Yeah. I guess I wish I‚Äôd known not to mention it. I hope this post can be a helpful tip for those in the future

IMHO, you did the correct thing revealing your second consult. This means you are evaluating your options and haven‚Äôt committed to a specific surgeon. By doing so, you‚Äôve allowed the opportunity for another woman to receive a sooner surgery date.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps look at it from their view, they only want to spend valuable time on patients who have made their decisions about their surgery. The good thing about RBbL‚Äôs surgery schedule is once you receive your date and have all paperwork and hair removal in order, you can ask to be placed on their surgery cancellation list to be considered for an earlier surgery date. I‚Äôm the beneficiary of that process and have received a four-month, three-week bump up from my original date‚ù£Ô∏è Best wishes for your journey! ü§ós

The issue is it delays this further. They‚Äôre already 14 months in the future. If I wait 3 months they could be 17+ months in the future for surgeries. It just feels sort of gatekeep-y to me. I would almost consider canceling my other consult because I really liked BBL
