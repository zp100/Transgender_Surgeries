Hey! I had my consultation with Dr. Witten today, I haven&#39;t seen too too many write-ups about him here, especially really recent ones, so I figured I&#39;d add to the pile.
</p>
<p>
First off, he&#39;s booked out really far. I called in January, they were booked out until July, so I had an appointment made for July 29th. I was expecting this, just the write-ups I had seen sounded like others got in within a couple months. Yesterday I called the office to ask some questions, I also asked if there were any openings that were sooner. They had a cancellation for the next day, so I got in way sooner!
</p>
<p>
The appointment. I arrive like 30 minutes early because I was terrified of being late. I give the front desk person my ID &amp; insurance and she gives me this form to fill out my preferred name, pronouns, signature, and date. The form basically said some information that I soon found out to be outdated, but it basically said he required 2 letters, 12 months of HRT, I believe 12 months of being confident in your gender identity, and something else I forget. I&#39;ve only been on HRT for about 6 months so my heart kinda sank but I figured this was just a consultation so worst case I gotta wait a little longer to get surgery scheduled.
</p>
<p>
This made me extremely nervous, but once I was called back it went away, no idea why. They seemed to be running on time that day, I was only called back about 5 minutes after my scheduled appointment time. I was asked some basic questions to make sure my chart was up to date, then I was put in a room.
</p>
<p>
Like 10-20 seconds later, Dr. Witten walks in with what I believe is a scribe and someone else, probably a med student or resident there. First thing he states is he sees his transgender patients at the end of the day so he can give them as much time as possible, which is great. Mine was scheduled for 3:45, so this tracks.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Witten has amazing bedside manner, like I&#39;ve never seen a doctor this nice, caring, and approachable. The main thing he asked is what the main reason I came for today was, basically what I wanted. Currently I would like an orchiectomy, I&#39;m a college student and taking off 3 months for a vaginoplasty isn&#39;t on the table right now but I would like it in the future. He said he sees a lot of younger people come in with this exact same desire, didn&#39;t realize it was this common.
</p>
<p>
I was going to ask about this, but he said he gets asked a lot on if an orchiectomy could affect someone&#39;s ability to get a vaginoplasty. Apparently his former colleagues back in Oregon did a study on this and found that there was very little to no affect on this, which was good to hear. Nothing to worry about with atrophy.
</p>
<p>
He walked me a bit through how the surgery is done as well as risks, asked if I had any questions. I had a really big kidney stone (15mm) when I was 17 (I&#39;m 18 now), where I had to get a surgery with a camera and laser put up my urethra. I asked if vaginoplasty would have any affect on the ability to have this done in the future if I have to get this done again. He said there wouldn&#39;t be any change in the options they&#39;d have in that scenario when I were to pursue a vaginoplasty, which was great to hear. That was the only question I really had.
</p>
<p>
He asked alcohol and drug questions. He mentioned that weed gummies are fine, but any sort of smoking he wants you to stop several weeks before surgery, fine with me because I don&#39;t smoke. He asked if I&#39;m on any hormones and how long, I said 6 months. He said perfect, so I assume he knows about the current WPATH guidelines being 6 months if applicable. He currently requires 1 letter for surgery, which is so much easier to get than 2 letters. Once I get that letter sorted I can get the surgery scheduled. He gave me a scheduling information sheet, as well as a vaginoplasty information primer as I was interested in that in the future. He said they still say 2 letters are required but currently he only requires 1. I assume they haven&#39;t gotten around to updating all the paperwork for the current guidelines. I can attach pictures of the handouts I got if anyone wants them.
</p>
<p>
Overall the consultation went a million times better than I thought it would. Dr. Witten is REALLY nice, didn&#39;t make me feel rushed at all. Made sure I got any questions I had answered. I plan on making another write up after surgery (hopefully in august, with pictures!), as well as when I get my vaginoplasty in a few years.
</p>

Thank you for your write up!! I am scheduled to see Dr Witten in May so this is extremely helpful, especially the part about length of hormones since I will be on 6 months of hormones in May as well.
