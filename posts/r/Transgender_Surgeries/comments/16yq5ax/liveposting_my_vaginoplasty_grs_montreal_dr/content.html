In case you missed it, I&#39;m keeping a diary of my time at GRS Montreal and sharing it here for you lovely folks to read. I&#39;ll answer any comments or questions I get. Otherwise, just enjoy the show.
</p>

<p>
Today&#39;s the day! I figured I&#39;d do a little pre-surgery post in case I&#39;m too out of it later. I&#39;m just chilling in my room waiting while Dr Brassard does his first surgery for the day, then it&#39;s my turn!
</p>
<p>
Any nerves I had have just evaporated at this point. I was mostly worried about messing up on my end, but now I&#39;ve done everything I need to and it&#39;s all up to the professionals. I also had the epiphany last night: they aren&#39;t going to cancel my surgery just because I missed a few hairs with the Nair, or didn&#39;t use the enamas perfectly. They want this surgery to happen as much as I do (okay maybe not that much). I joked a few days ago &#34;is it too much to ask that everything go perfectly?&#34; But it won&#39;t go perfectly and it doesn&#39;t have to. Just stay calm, do your best and you&#39;ll be fine.
</p>
<p>
Admission went smoothly, I had to sign about a dozen documents on my way in. The staff I&#39;ve talked to so far have all been lovely. I saw Dr Brassard before he went off. He was super nice; at this point I didn&#39;t have any questions to ask so it was just &#34;see you in two hours&#34;. He even tied my dressing gown for me (unprompted) which was adorable.
</p>
<p>
Now I just sit here and wait until it&#39;s my turn. See you on the other side!
</p>

I made it! And I have a vagina now! Or maybe I should say, I have a crotch full of bandages and I&#39;m told there&#39;s a vagina underneath xD
</p>
<p>
So after the last update, I was in the room for maybe 90 minutes. I met Dr Rosseau, the anesthesiologist for my surgery. Then they came to bring me up, kissed my wife goodbye, and they brought me to a small waiting room. There were other rooms with other people waiting but I thought it might be weird to go say hi. I don&#39;t know if it was the cocktail of meds or the 4am wakeups but all I wanted to do then was sleep.
</p>
<p>
Then it was surgery. The operating room is pretty intense; there&#39;s about 10 people all running around doing things and chatting in French. They tell you to do things, move this way, lean forward, or they just grab you and do it themselves. I was feeling a little out of it already so I just did what they told me and focused on my breathing.
</p>
<p>
And then I woke up in the ward. I remember dreaming that I was in the Stardew Valley hospital. I remember talking a lot, but that might have been a dream too. I was pretty lucid right away, so I was talking to my nurse as she worked away. I stayed there for about an hour after, but the time just flew by. Maybe I wasn&#39;t as lucid as I thought.
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;m back in my room. I slept a lot right away, and I probably will again after writing this. I slowly got feeling and movement back in my lower half, but then I also started feeling the pain. I&#39;d say 4 or 5/10 right now. I&#39;m not sure how bad it should be before I ask for more painkillers ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I&#39;m also a little hungry, they said if everything stays okay I can have a snack later on. Meanwhile my wife eats her snacks right next to me üôÉ
</p>
<p>
Right as I&#39;m typing this, two nurses came and helped me stand up. That went perfectly, so I think walking later will be no problem.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m a very happy girl!!
