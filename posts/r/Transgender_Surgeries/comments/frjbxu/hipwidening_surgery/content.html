a few months ago, i read an
<a href="https://genderanalysis.net/2018/02/a-new-plastic-surgery-technique-for-hip-widening/">article
</a>
about a new plastic surgery technique that could actually widen your pelvic bone.
</p>
<p>
so my question is basically just: is this a real thing ?

I signed up for their mailing list like 2 years ago. Apparently they are just now accepting people to be put on their waiting list for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
Basically it&#39;s in clinical trials right now, but I wouldn&#39;t be too optimistic about it. It only widens the top of the pelvis bone so it may give you a curvier mid section but wont help where your hips actually are.
</p>
<p>
As far as I know, no one&#39;s done it yet so we don&#39;t hav before/after photos.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not terribly confident it&#39;s going to be a great success the first time around, but it may open the door for some cool stuff in the future!
</p>
<p>
I have terrible hip dysphoria and currently I think the best option is fat transfers to the hips. I&#39;ve even seen some good results from a silicone implant on the hip too

yes, the surgery is real, and there are surgeons in the U.S. that can perform this procedure. basically, an implant is placed on each side of the pelvic bone to widen the hips. the surgery isn&#39;t that great, imo, because with every implant the chance of rejection is possible, and in some cases the implant becomes visible and then you end up with two ugly protrusions on your hips.

a brazilian buttlift is leagues better.

They usually use titanium.  It&#39;s a graft - sterile - that goes on your bone.  The body reacts to it like any breast implant and forms a capsule around it.  I would consider it but I feel like a  BBL will give me what I need.

I think right now the only explored option was silicone and custom 3-D printed titanium implant.

Very much looking for people who can speak as to the overall usefulness of these images in assessing this concept.

You get downvotes because that’s the way reddit works. Either people people don’t like your comment or you’re getting random downvotes.
</p>
<p>
Don’t make pointless comments just so you can find this post again. It clutters up the discussion for everyone else. There’s a save button that allows you to save posts for later - use that instead.

Implants are real, they are not a hallucination.  BBL is soft tissue solely, it can not move with the skeleton as something as rigid as the skeleton and fixed to it does.  I&#39;ve also seen here the risk of death with BBL is 1 in 3000, it&#39;s hardly as risk free as Botox.
</p>
<p>
The actual shape of the pelvis is generally not visible from outside the body, it is almost entirely covered by thick musculature.  Where it is actually palpable close to the surface is where this proposed implant is going, so this could certainly have the intended effect of making the projection of the pelvis outwards more noticeable.  It is plausible to me it would also have to accompanied by fat injection or silicone implants as well, because the soft tissue just down from there is also far thicker/more fatty.
</p>
<p>
Other than those MtF young and lucky enough to have blockers and hormone replacement afford them a feminine puberty, all most all MtF persons will need substantial medical intervention to appear as feminine as they are likely to wish, and there are no &#34;safe&#34; medical interventions.

Assuming it works I’d guess they are still in the early trials and they can only do a limited number of surgeries. May as well charge whatever they can as there’s always a few people for whom this kind on money is nothing.
</p>
<p>
I doubt the implant itself costs some ridiculous price.
</p>
<p>
Once the potential volume goes up the price would severely limit the number of patients and they would be better off dropping it right down and letting other surgeons use the technology. They should be able to make way more money through volume.
</p>
<p>
The alternative is they could be really bad at business, but that seems unlikely.
</p>
<p>
Personally I’m interested, but I wouldn’t do it right now if they paid me. Too risky.

Actually they said $17k if done in South Korea, at the time it was first publicized.

Are you referring to an old price or one that to your knowledge is still available? Sounds like a price you knew of from a few years back but that’s a difference that could make this viable for me so I wanna be clear.
</p>
<p>
Also any idea how to get in touch with anyone about this other than Osty Medtech?

Okay hear this out, but you will probably think I&#39;m crazy or stupid. I think the power of belief is huge. Maybe I&#39;m crazy but I believe in subliminals. I was already kinda rectangular shaped, hips and shoulders same width, but now I&#39;m more pear shaped, and I had already been on mones for about 6 years when I listened to those.
