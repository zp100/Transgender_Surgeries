Because he was cheap lol, it went okay tbh so I do feel that his bad reputation for srs isn’t really fair

Could you give me review please. There’s almost nothing about Picet online.
</p>
<p>
How much did it cost? How long was the wait list? What depth did you get? How’s the aesthetics?

I waited about a month after contacting him, paid 14,000 aud because the exchange rate screwed me sooo bad converting to USD! I’m right on 5 inches give or take cause I can best describe the skin graft as like a trampoline
</p>
<p>
The aesthetics are okay but nothing too designer, I’ve been told it’s pretty close to that of a cis vagina by a few people and have had sex with a few guys since having it and the last two have been able to reach the end which is a big deal.

His skills are okay, the clinic is just very old which is my main issue cause I think they just need to maybe invest in modernising it and increasing comfort

I had him too. He left a lot of erectile tissue behind and it was a very unnatural result aesthetically and to the naked eye.
</p>
<p>
Nothing too difficult to revise, so not catastrophically bad, but still not a good result by any means.
</p>
<p>
The part he did ok was the vag. Surprisingly you&#39;d think that would be the part a cheap doc would screw up but it was fine, if on the smaller side.
