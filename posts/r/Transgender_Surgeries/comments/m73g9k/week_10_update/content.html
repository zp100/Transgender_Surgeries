So at 10 weeks, I&#39;m having random vaginal bleeds. I don&#39;t know why. I bend wrong, bleed. I poop too hard... bleed. Apparently, it&#39;s an issue with the area that rejected the graft? But it&#39;s healing. It just is gonna bleed a bit. :/
</p>
<p>
Dilating is starting to feel... good. Almost too good XD I can&#39;t wait till I&#39;m green lit to explore that further.
</p>
<p>
I have had 2 orgasms now, neither one intentional,  but doc says that means I can have them intentionally in future. One was in shower, as mentioned in an earlier post. The other woke me up from sleep XD. Let me tell you, waking up with her jumping for joy while my whole clit tingled was kinda amazing. And then my bladder leaked and ruined it, but what can ya do? Still having issues with that, doc says it&#39;s not uncommon, it&#39;s the unconcious movement of the pelvic floor muscles relearning themselves.
</p>
<p>
My clit feels GOOD. I touch her, gently, as was suggested for neuropathy and general nerve retraining, and she&#39;ll tingle pleasantly for several seconds to a minute after.
</p>
<p>
My vagina is still at a good depth. Marked my dilator last night, forgot to take a picture, but I&#39;m still around 5 1/2 inches... which is almost from her to my hips...
</p>
<p>
I think I&#39;ll keep doing these weekly updates for another couple weeks, then maybe make them a monthly thing, 3 months is supposed to be an even keel.
</p>
<p>
Began douching last week, that feels... interesting. Stings a little in graft rejection site, but then actually feels a bit better. (Reccomended receipe, 1 cap white vinegar, 1 or 2 good drops summer&#39;s eve unscented,  dilute with 300 ml warm water. Rinse with clear water after, to remove soap)
</p>
<p>
UTI cleared up, thankfully. No more burning pee!
</p>
<p>
TLDR I LOVE MY PUSSY

Looks pretty good. You have some granulation there, but as long as it doesn&#39;t become too painful to dilate, you&#39;re on your way.

I&#39;m not a dr but that bright red, sugar grain tissue looks like it could be hyper granulation, especially if it bleeds easily. Can be treated with silver nitrate, very common.

The blood is coming from healing fistula and graft rejection site that&#39;s a bit raw, and may take a couple weeks more to heal properly.

Doc says it&#39;s healing ok. Red is normal. Thanks though. It&#39;s actually slowly turning pink.
