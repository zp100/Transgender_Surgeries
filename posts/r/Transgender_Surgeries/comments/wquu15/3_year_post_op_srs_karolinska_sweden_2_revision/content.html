<p>
I used to have a lot of issues post op and my posts went viral and also spread a lot of misinformation that I even read on here. This post is mostly made to address those.
</p>
<p>
My two biggest complaints used to be hair on the inside and pain. Thanks to the revisions I no longer have any hair on the inside and it is possible to do diathermy hair removal on the inside. In Sweden its paid for via the healthcare system and done at Södersjukhuset. And its also possible to remove the hairs during revision surgeries which is how the hair inside me was removed.
</p>
<p>
The nerve pain only lasted for 2.5 years and was most intense 6 months - 2 years post op period.
</p>
<p>
I used to have issues with dilating and couldn’t dilate at all for 1.5 years and I still have 11 cm depth without dilating, but I did do it religiously the first 9 or so months. And can still regain some depth if I dilate regularly again. The opening is very narrow but is easy to make wider with regular dilating.
</p>
<p>
Reason I had to stop was due to intense pain and nerve pain that made it impossible to dilate. That pain started coming during dilation sessions when I was about 8 months post op.
</p>
<p>
Needing revision surgeries with SRS is very common and normal. A lot of issues also go away with time by themselves, especially pain. Maybe I was just unlucky and an outlier? But odds are someone reading this will be like me and have pain for years after the surgery like I had. And I just want to say, just because you have had pain for this long doesn’t mean it has to be for the rest of your life. People online told me it would be for the rest of my life and I believed them. Even the medical staff were unsure if it would ever go away but it did.
</p>
<p>
Now that its all over, I am very happy with the results and happy that I had the surgery. Even if the last 3 years were among the hardest of my life and the first months of being post op was a living hell worse than my nightmares. If I could go back in time and choose to do the surgery or not, I would do it all over again.

Thank you for sharing. It&#39;s so rare for people to followup this far after and hearing that problems you experienced early on were not permanent helps so much.

Hey stupidstories,
</p>
<p>
We&#39;ve talked before.
</p>
<p>
I am the user that made collections of images from your post op fall out to be shared on image boards. I&#39;ve apologized many times in the past and come out myself (10 months now.) I am very happy for you and hope that you live your best life. I think the hate people throw at you has actually made you a very strong person and your maturity or wisdom makes you inspiring.
</p>
<p>
:)

They got them during the revision surgery so didn&#39;t need to. But if I still had hair it would have been through anova. Not sure if they help you if you did it privately? Sometimes they can be stupid like that but it cant hurt to ask them.

Its not so much missing the hairs, sometimes the body makes new follicles during the healing process of skin.

Please, could you tell how was that doctors found that surgery was the only solution for inside hairs? I have a bunch of them and I&#39;m sick of being hugboxed by surgeons in my country (arg). They don&#39;t care,  and answers are ambiguous, avoidant, etc.
</p>
<p>
Could I write DM if you don&#39;t mind?

Not sure exactly, didn&#39;t ask them any specifics. But when i felt with my fingers it felt the hairs started midway in and was going all the way to the depth. And it felt like there were a lot of them, hard to say exactly but enough to make it feel like it was covered in hair. Now I can&#39;t feel a single hair.

Thank you for this write up. You are giving me hope that my dilation and neuropathic pain will eventually subside.
</p>
<p>
What exactly did the revisions involve for you ?
</p>
<p>
I have extra skin that has healed over the entrance and it needs to be removed as it collects urine. I also have painful scars that itch and have lumps under them that I hope can be cut out. Did you experience anything similar ?
</p>
<p>
Did your ability to enjoy your vagina suffer during the course of your recovery ? Did clitoral and internal sensation improve after you revisions and when the pain went away ?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 9 months post op and trying to find any positives at the moment, I&#39;m really struggling with it especially as I cannot climax and taking lots of pain medication :/
</p>
<p>
Thank you again and congratulations x

There were lots of small minor during first revision, fixes like excess skin and two hard nodes of scar tissue that was giving me pain during. Also they fixed my urethra because I had issues peeing. And removed erectile tissue that wasn&#39;t needed.
</p>
<p>
Second revision was a very minor surgery. They removed another node of scar tissue that was painful and some erectile tissue.
</p>
<p>
They might have done more stuff but thats what I can remember from ontop of my head. So yea I had similar issues.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t really masturbate because I was digusted by myself. So in that way it affected me but not sensation as far as I know.

Again, thank you so much for this.
</p>
<p>
I know it&#39;s a delicate subject but feel disgusted by myself as well. Its really making it difficult to try and enjoy it and a viscous circle of hate and Depression.
</p>
<p>
I have a consultation soon with a different surgeon to hopefully remove the excess tissue and scars that I think are causing my physical and mental issues. Once it&#39;s not painful and looks less like a horror movie prop I&#39;m sure I can learn to love it and move on with my life.
</p>
<p>
I admire your strength and honesty x

Sorry if this is too personal. I’m still learning what the new anatomy is and the graphics that surgeons show aren’t “realistic” enough for me as i am a visual person. Can you give me a little anatomy lesson? haha. Is the bottom hole the vagina?

Beautiful results, the first pic gives me profound hope and optimism that the first try doesn&#39;t have to be perfect. Thanks for sharing and congratulations!

The Finnish one did all 3 surgeries. I rather not post his name because of how some people that follow me act.

Hey I see you live in Sweden. I’m sure you have done your research. Do you happen to know the top places in Sweden to go for plastic surgery? Not reassignment surgery per say, but just the best of the best in plastic surgery in general. Thanks ❤️

Time. Hair grows in cycles. So after you&#39;ve completely eradicated all the current hairs, you need to wait to see if others will come back.

Congratulations first of all! A few questions: 1. Do you remember what it was like before or is it as if you had had a vagina since you can remember? I know the latter is common. 2. Any issues going to the toilet? Did you easily get used to sitting all the time? Some girls have told me it can be a bit messy in the beginning. 3. Is dilation painful or it gets better with time? Thanks!

Your vulva looks fine! I get that you had complications post-op, but unfortunately that is pretty common in most types of SRS, but honestly it’s not as bad as you made it out to be in the past. Honestly, it kinda looks like a cis pussy! I don’t understand why you’d regret having such a perfect body, you look amazing, both from your SRS and from getting BA tbh. If you want to get FFS, that’s fine, but you don’t really need it. You honestly pass as cis to almost everyone on here and on other subreddits, so stop beating yourself up!

I know I&#39;m a little late but ur results are incredible and I had a few questions please describe in detail if it&#39;s not rude to ask  1. Kinda weird but what does it feel like to pee now I can&#39;t find an answer and I&#39;m really curious 2. Do you feel more confident and if so how so 3. Another kinda weird one but what walk around with one in clothes and without I can&#39;t seem to properly picture it 4. How does sex/masturbation feel with it is it better or worse if that&#39;s even possible 5. How was recovery
