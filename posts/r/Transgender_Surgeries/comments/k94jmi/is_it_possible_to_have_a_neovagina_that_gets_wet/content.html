Is it possible to have a neo-vagina that gets wet when you&#39;re sexually aroused?

I know certain methods allow it to self lubricate, but everything I&#39;ve seen online suggests that it doesn&#39;t increase with arousal. I&#39;m hoping this isn&#39;t true because it&#39;s something I really want. I wanted to know if any of y&#39;all have experiences that confirm or deny this, thanks!

I had standard vaginoplasty and I can get fairly wet. I’m only 6 months so its wildly inconsistent but it can get pretty moist down there and I have been able to dilate without lube before. As time goes on its getting a little more keyed to arousal. Its never quite enough for any major penetration but its nice. And don’t feel bad at all, lots of cis girls have their own personal crotch desert and have to use lube so theres nothing wrong with that.

Yes, depending on the surgical technique. A past girlfriend of mine would get as wet as any natal vagina.

This is not true. Despite the popular opinion, sufficient lubrication is the norm from PI, not the exception.
</p>
<p>
It also varies tremendously by technique. Sigmoid colon SRS is essentially a guarantee, to the extent that any surgery can be a guarantee (patients have issues with too much), and PPT provides a greatly increased chance of lubrication.
</p>
<p>
OP, reddit is good about some things, but it is wrong about this one. Over and over and over.

Source? I had PI. No lubrication whatsoever. I&#39;ve talked to several women in the same boat, and I read that this is the norm both on Reddit and other internet forums.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon even told me not to expect it to be enough for sex, even if I did lubricate so I&#39;m interested in where you&#39;re getting this information.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it&#39;s &#39;damp&#39; in there if you put your finger inside. But it&#39;s not tied to arousal, nor is it enough for penetrative sex or dilation. The only time I get sufficiently &#39;wet&#39; is usually after orgasm, and it&#39;s not coming from inside the vagina.

After about 30 minutes looking for a study that directly addressed my claim (the vast majority of research appears to focus on complication rates, and groups all factors related to patient satisfaction into a single metric, rather than breaking it down), I found &#34;Aesthetic and Functional Outcomes of Neovaginoplasty Using Penile Skin in Male-to-Female Transsexuals&#34;, Buncamper 2015.
</p>
<p>
Of the sexually active participants (13 of the 49 participants were not sexually active), patients gave their lubrication during intercourse an average score of 3.9/6 with a standard deviation of 1.9, for the lubrication subscale on the Female Sexual Function Index.
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t a full answer, since the study doesn&#39;t provide the participant&#39;s answers to specific questions, but it&#39;s a pretty strong indication (reading the questions on the FSFI) that the majority of participants are likely able to have sexual intercourse without additional lubrication.
</p>
<p>
So... I tried.
</p>
<p>
Mostly, I&#39;m speaking from my consultations on that one - every surgeon I consulted with told me that sufficient lubrication for sex was a likely outcome.

IDK... seems like the jury is still out on this to me. Certainly there&#39;s not enough data to suggest that sufficient lubrication for sex is the norm.. I also don&#39;t know who your surgical consultations were with, but all the docs I talked to told me that it was possible but unlikely, unless that was just an undersell or something...
</p>
<p>
49 isn&#39;t exactly a big sample size. All of those participants could have had the same surgeon for all we know.  I&#39;m not completely sold on the FSFI either as a strong indicator. For instance the lubrication section of that questionnaire has 4 questions...so which is the 3.9 in relation to? Some women could have had a strong answer to one or two but not all. Not to mention all the other issues with that model...
</p>
<p>
Thanks for digging it up though!

The FSFI is a reliable standard.

</a>
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re misreading the scoring - each of the four questions could be answered between 1 and 6. The average participant in the study answered &#34;most times&#34; for most questions, which includes &#34;Over the past 4 weeks, how often did you become lubricated (&#34;wet&#34;) during sexual activity or intercourse?&#34; and &#34;how often did you maintain your lubrication (&#34;wetness&#34;) until completion of sexual activity or intercourse?&#34;
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s a positive result. Could always use a larger study, of course.

Ok then for PI it is not but for sigmoid and for non PI like suporn method, it usually happens. PI method is usually done in US and some places of europe and it sucks compared to others

Sucks? it&#39;s been the medical standard for years do to a lower complication rate and a less taxing recovery. There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s been practiced. The Thai method is more invasive and stressful, and PPT is pretty new.

Definitely YMMV but remember that even cis girls can&#39;t always get wet enough for penetrative sex. My ex was like this and we had to use lube even if she was wet and super-horny. Don&#39;t let stupid societal norms that are wrong define your happiness.

Mostly yes. My V is always wet and when I&#39;m aroused it&#39;s extra wet. I still use lube when dilating or for sexytimes with guys. For fingers and toys, usually my self lube is enough.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. Suporn over Dr. Bank? Do you recommend Dr. Suporn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Do you plan to have any revision surgery (unless you already have one)? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in Thailand(Chon Buri)? How was Dr. Suporn&#39;s aftercare? Have you tried the dilators of the soul? And if you used them, is there any advantage? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

I&#39;m not the greatest person to ask about recovery. I haven&#39;t had a great time tbh.
</p>
<p>
I chose Suporn back in 2007 and I wanted it to be done by him, I feel like I was lucky to go to him before he retired, especially because I had been waiting 11 years.
</p>
<p>
Suporn is a good surgeon but I feel like in general he is too blasé about things and he doesn&#39;t take you seriously when you tell him about stuff.
</p>
<p>
Cosmetically it&#39;s okay I guess, it&#39;s not the nicest of his results, I also have some extra scarring because of getting an infection after the anterior commissure revision.
</p>
<p>
Sensation is good, I don&#39;t find it too hard to orgasm, there&#39;s a part that I would call the g spot where rubbing it definitely increases pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Depth started at 17cm but I&#39;m now Town to something like 13cm. This is mainly because of two reasons. The first is that I was hospitalised twice early on in the first year for a virus and then an infection, so skipping dilation during that time had a negative impact. The second is that I have had infections since month 3, I just hit my 2 yr anniversary last month and I&#39;m still constantly getting infections, I have been on antibiotics, in fact I was on 11 courses of antibiotics last year including one administered by drip while I was in hospital. The infection will go away while I&#39;m on them and will come back a day few days after I&#39;m done. I do think I have a small fistula, that&#39;s my only explanation anyway.
</p>
<p>
When I told him this he just blew it off and told me to douche more. Which actually makes it worse. I hate having had the surgery because of this.
</p>
<p>
I never used any of the other dilators, only the Suporn ones.
</p>
<p>
Aftercare is awesome, the clinic staff take care of you well, I loved being there both times and am planning on going for a second revision next year hopefully. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had as good a time as the times I was in chonburi.
</p>
<p>
Just know that I have friends who had none of these issues at all, a lot of people are happy with what they get, I&#39;m just unlucky.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if I missed anything.

Yes, to a degree. It&#39;s very YMMV from person to person.

I’m about 4 months post op and definitely get wet when aroused, even enough for sex however I still use lube because it is more comfortable, less chance of pain, and I can “warm up” faster to be able to take an average penis completely compared to without. It’s technically possible now though. I think this is an unusual result. Worth noting I also am probably more moist than average when not aroused as well. Standard penile inversion Kaiser NorCal

This differs on how much your prostate goes into girl mode from HRT getting very active (not an official thing but mine did) and it depends on your surgery technique. One of the techniques promising this is the combined method by Dr Schaff. I think the Thai surgeons also claim such features as part of their techniques. I suggest reading the wiki.

That&#39;s honestly one thing I&#39;m dreading... It&#39;s sooo important to me to get wet when aroused that if I happen to be one of those that can&#39;t--- hoooo boy, that&#39;s gonna be another can of dysphoria there. I&#39;m still - I think - quite far away from have GRS in any case, but that&#39;s one question that weighs heavily on my mind.

Do keep in mind that there may be better grs-options by the time you are going to have grs.

Idk at least I tell myself that &#34;Every day I&#39;m stuck in gatekeeping purgatory is a day that a breakthrough might happen...&#34; to cope with waiting for hrt better...

Unfortunately not for me. There&#39;s only one place in the whole country who does GRS at all, and even then we don&#39;t get to choose our surgeons. It may not even be the same guy who does the consultation than the one actually performing the surgery.

<p>
It&#39;s what it is, we get that one thing and that&#39;s it.

Same. Vagina has a measure of baseline moisture, but when aroused I notice an increase more around my clitoris than the vaginal canal itself.

I had minimal depth that ended up giving me 5-8 cm or about 2-3 inches.  When I&#39;m aroused, I definitely get &#34;wet&#34; and it does add a
<em>
lot
</em>
of lube to my vulva and the portion of vaginal canal that I have.  But I think it&#39;s essentially &#34;pre-cum&#34; that gets moved around. I do
<em>
not
</em>
think that my &#34; [formerly penile] skin within my &#34;vagina&#34; secretes.  And I don&#39;t know how it would translate to &#34;making me wet&#34; inside the full depth.  More surface area, same lube...might not go as far.  I&#39;m tentatively planning to have PPT next summer.  We&#39;ll see.

Doesn&#39;t the Perineum Pull-Through method make it somewhat self-lubricating?

Yes it&#39;s possible and not too difficult. Easier to get wet with supplements like pygeum
