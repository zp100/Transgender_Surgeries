I&#39;ve seen 2pass is still in business after the death of Dr Bart. Is the new surgeon their any good? Is it worth now considering 2pass since surgery will not be performed by Dr Bart who was known for botching people? I want to go to them because they are condiserably less expensive than facialteam but I don&#39;t wanna risk the probability of getting botched if its still the same

Dr Oelbrandt and Dr Van Der Dussen are heading up their FFS now.
</p>
<p>
I had a consult recently with Dr Oelbrandt, he is well mannered, more affordable, seemingly more conservative and was very aware of safety, in fact it seemed a priority when discussing surgical possibilities, being mindful of nerves etc.
