Hello, on November 6th I had an SRS operation at the Hospital Universitario La Paz in Madrid. I can tell you a little about my experience.
</p>
<p>
I was operated on by 3 surgeons: Dr. Shirin Zarbakhsh Etemadi, Maite Serrano Alonso and Dr. Jorge Bonastre Juli√°, since before they gave me anesthesia they spoke to me in the operating room.
<br>
The operation lasted 4 hours and 28 minutes. I went into the operating room at 8 in the morning and woke up in the intensive care unit at 2 in the afternoon, crying with joy. I was in bed all weekend. On Monday the 11th, they took off my &#34;diaper&#34;, put me in a bathtub and disconnected the catheter from my urine but leaving the catheter towards my urethra still in place. It was somewhat painful although they gave me pain relief. I saw my vagina for the first time. I cried with joy (and with pain during the first vaginal examination with a speculum). I could now &#34;walk&#34; but it was difficult. In my case, I have a low pain threshold and I was taking daily painkillers. On November 13th, they performed my first dilation, which was not difficult and they inserted one of the Vagiwell dilators (the purple one) halfway inside my vagina. They discharged me shortly after, sending me home with heparin (having problems and trauma with the needles, a bad idea). On the morning of the 14th I had to go to the emergency room because of pain (the painkillers weren&#39;t working, they gave me more painkillers and sent me home) and I still couldn&#39;t dilate. On the 15th I had to go to the emergency room and they put a finger inside my neovagina to check if it had closed. They recommended that I wait until Thursday the 21st when I have an appointment with Dr. Serrano so she can see me and tell me how to perform the dilations properly.
<br>
For the moment I will update my evolution.

Thanks, I&#39;ll add this to the wiki here.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve not heard of any of these surgeons before.
