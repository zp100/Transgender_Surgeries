Thought I&#39;d post this as a resource for those who might need it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m about 10 months post op and have been experiencing some deep internal hyper granulation. I had three silver nitrate treatments (which I personally found very uncomfortable, though many do pretty okay with them). To my dismay, the three treatments did not have any positive effect - in fact, a speculum exam after the third revealed my issue had actually gotten worse over the course of the treatments.
</p>
<p>
I was offered the option of a medicated ointment called
<a href="https://www.medbroadcast.com/drug/getdrug/viaderm-kc">Viaderm KC
</a>
which is bascially a corticosteroid plus an anti bacterial and anti fungal. I was instructed to apply it with an applicator (like the kind for yeast infection creams, etc) once a day for four days, wait seven days, and then repeat this cycle two more times. Much to my delight, my next follow up showed a significant reduction in the hypergranulation tissue. I was beyond relieved! I have gotten the go-ahead to repeat the viaderm treatment again to take care of the remainder.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully this is something that can be useful to others dealing with persistent or silver nitrate-resistant hypergranulation. At the very least its something one could discuss with their doctor. For reference, this is a technique used by the surgeon at the new gender surgery program in Vancouver, Canada.

I apologize I have no idea what hypergranulation is but I do want to thank you for taking the time to talk about your experience. Its a good chance Iâ€™ll probably need this info when I have my surgery. Im just starting transitioning so it wont be for a while but im glad I know now rather than it being later and me not having any idea what to do.

Awesome. I think it&#39;s a great idea you&#39;re thinking ahead. In my early days I definitely saved posts and tucked things away for later too. We have to be as informed as possible ourselves because, professionally speaking, our health is a pretty under-studied field.

it&#39;s when you wind up with way too many blood vessels in an area, so it&#39;s sensitive, prone to bleeding and infection, etc.. it&#39;s normally treated by cauterizing the visible spot with silver nitrate - but usually only after careful care, antibiotic creams, etc., have failed to calm the tissue down.

This a great solution to add to the granulation remedies.

<p>
Thanks!
