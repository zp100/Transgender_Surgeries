Hey!
</p>
<p>
I had surgery 15 years ago with Dr Suporn (it was great!) but lost some depth in the last 5 years due to some unfortunate events. I&#39;m considering a PPT revision. Had my heart set on Bluebond-Langer, but then I saw the price (I&#39;m based outside the US, so no possibility for insurance coverage). I have a consultation with her booked for next month, but unless the price drops by more than half of what I saw, I won&#39;t be able to afford her.
</p>
<p>
Trying not to fall into complete despair at the moment. I&#39;ve heard Dr Jesus Lago in Madrid is doing PPT, and so is Dr Miro Djordjevic in Belgrade. Both of them seem reasonable price-wise, but I know very little about them. Does anyone here have a sense of how good they are/what the complication rate is? And also what the scarring is like from the laproscopic aspect of the surgery?
</p>
<p>
Any information on Lago or Djordjevic would be helpful!
</p>
<p>
Thanks you x

An update, in case anyone ever finds themselves in a similar situation:
</p>
<p>
I had a consultation with Dr Miro Djordjevic yesterday. It went really well! As everyone says, he&#39;s really friendly. We discussed the potential of doing a depth revision through PPT, and he said I was a good candidate for it. And if for whatever reason it doesn&#39;t work out, there&#39;s always the option to try sygmoid colon in the future (personally, I don&#39;t want that at all if I can avoid it!). He has done follow ups on 52 patients who have had this same PPT technique used for revision, and only one had a major complication (I&#39;m not a math genius, but that&#39;s a very, very low complication rate!). He has subsequently done several recently, so I think his overall number of PPT depth revisions is about 60 at of November 2021, and considerably more if you factor in the primary PPT vaginoplasties he&#39;s done. He&#39;s been doing PPT for at least five years, and obviously is quite famous for his work doing metas for the boys, so I feel like I&#39;d be in safe hands. The surgery will cost just a little more than €15k (£13k), and should only take 3.5 hrs to perform. Two to three nights in hospital, and I&#39;d need to stay in Serbia for 2 weeks total. All in all, it was really reassuring! He books out about 4 months in advance, depending on where he will be (he also performs surgeries at Mt Sinai Hospital in New York, though I expect total cost would be a lot more there due to the American healthcare system).
</p>
<p>
Also finally heard back from Dr Lago&#39;s office in Madrid, but they can&#39;t book me for a consultation until January because he only does consults on Tuesdays. I told them to let me know when there&#39;s a consult date available, but we&#39;ll see.

Thanks! Can I ask what you had done with him? And did you have any major complications?

PPT SRS, I have partial vaginal stenosis as my only noteworthy complication, my vagina collapsed around the bit where the two types of tissues meet. Why it happened is a bit complex but I don&#39;t believe it was because they did a bad job, just some unfortunate events that lead to this problem. I might need a revision surgery to fix that after a year of being post op. I am quite satisfied anyhow though, I had a good experience.

Currently? 8cm, so basically 90-95% of the penile tissue section. Once I get it fixed it will be 5-6&#34;, wasn&#39;t given my exact measurements prior to the partial stenosis but 5-6&#34; was what I was promised. Keep in mind that it is not supposed to go wrong though, I had some unfortunate events come together and cause this. What matters more than my complication is that they&#39;re aware of the mistake and have acted in an acceptable manner, which they did. They wanna see if I can fix it through dilation first, if not then I need to go back for additional treatment at some point.

Can I ask, was the mistake on the part of the surgeon or something that happened after surgery? I&#39;m having a consultation with Miro on Saturday.

After I think, the surgery itself was done appropriately as far as I can tell.
