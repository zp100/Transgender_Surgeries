I&#39;ve had two consultations with him so far and will have a third on Friday to hopefully nail down a surgery date in June. He&#39;s very friendly and those I know who have had surgery with him say he has an excellent bedside manner. He is a reconstructive urologist who specializes in these types of complicated surgeries. I feel very good about going with him. Let me know if you have any other questions. I know there&#39;s not a lot of info about him out there yet so I plan to write up a full report once I&#39;m all done.
