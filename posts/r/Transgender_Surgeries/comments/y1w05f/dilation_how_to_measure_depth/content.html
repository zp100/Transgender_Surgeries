Hello, I have the soulsource rigid dilators p1-2 and #1-4) along with the soulsource silicone dilators #1-8. I’m currently using the green Rigid #3 and the violet silicone #7. My question is, the rigid green #7 goes in to the second dot (that’s good for me-there’s a reason for that I know) and the violet #7 silicone goes in 2/3 of the way. When I use the silicone orange #6 I can get it completely inside. How do I measure my depth? The orange silicone is 13cm and that goes completely in, the green hard Dilator goes to the second dot which is 11cm (measured with a straight ruler across the bend) and will go no further. Am I 11cm or 13cm deep?

It doesn’t really matter how you measure it, just so long as it’s done the same way each time and you don’t start losing depth.
