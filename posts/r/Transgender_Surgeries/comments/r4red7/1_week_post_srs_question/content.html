Hi, I got surgery ( srs mtf) in Belgium last week but the Dilatation programs the hospital gave me is way way way shorter than anything I find on the internet.
</p>
<p>
1st week : 4 times 1hour a day and all night
</p>
<p>
2 week : 3 times 1 hour a day and all night
</p>
<p>
3rd week we stop having the prosthetic in all night
</p>
<p>
After a month 3 times a day for 30minutes
</p>
<p>
After 3 month, 2 time a day for 10 minutes
</p>
<p>
It seems very short compared to what I see only, what do you think? Maybe it&#39;s a different technique or something?

Hi, I also live in Belgium and have my srs sheduled for April next year. Where did you have your surgery? I will have mine in Aalst. I noticed also, checking the internet, that the after care varies a lot.

What kind of dilator are you using that stays in all night ?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m on 20 minutes 3x a day for about 8 weeks then maybe down to twice a day. Soul source dilators.

It&#39;s not the dilatator but the base prosthetic I need to keep in all night.

It seems unusual from what I have seen. Quite a lot of time at first and ramping down quickly. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard of anyone being told to leave a dilator in overnight (I have to apply pressure on mine to keep it in), or so long each time.
</p>
<p>
Variations can be due to different techniques, the surgeon just having tried something that gave good results and sticking with it without questioning if all of it was necessary, and of course due to your own anatomy.
</p>
<p>
For example, when I got discharged about a month and a half ago, the pre-printed aftercare instructions I was given, said to dilate three times each morning and three each evening, 20 minutes at a time, but the surgeon told me I only needed to do once in the morning and once in the evening, and also skipped the small dilator. We will discuss a lower frequency when I go in for stage 2.
</p>
<p>
What you will be doing after one and three months is not too different from what I do, so I wouldn&#39;t worry about that. You can always check with your surgeon if you feel dilation gets harder.
</p>
<p>
The beginning does seem like more than most people do, but if you can put up with it, it can&#39;t be too much. The only thing that concerns me a bit is leaving a dilator in overnight and trying to get it out after the lube has dried. How is that working out for you? Or is it not a dilator that you leave in at night?

Tbh it&#39;s going out very easily in the morning! But it&#39;s not a hard dilator like u see online, it&#39;s softer and straight

I&#39;m curious to see what that prosthetic looks like.
</p>
<p>
The dilators I use (for now) are also soft and straight, made of silicone.
