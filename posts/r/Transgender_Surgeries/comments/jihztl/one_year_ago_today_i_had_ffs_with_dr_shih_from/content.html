Brow lift, forehead reduction/hairline lowered, Jaw contouring, nose uh... stuff (forget the technical term)
</p>
<p>
Recovery was shockingly not very painful, the only 2 nights that I had issues with were when we got a little behind on my meds. Mostly it was due to drying out since I was unable to breathe through my nose due to swelling. I was up and moving around within a couple days, though it was a solid 2-3 weeks before I was back at work etc. again

When searching for FFS surgeons what criteria should I pay attention to? Where is a good place to find info besides the wiki?
</p>
<p>
I know what I don&#39;t like about my face but I&#39;ve changed drastically in only 6 months, how long after starting HRT is good to wait before seriously considering FFS? In addition, I know what I don&#39;t like but I don&#39;t know what a realistic change is or how to select someone best to accomplish those changes.
</p>
<p>
Are you fully happy with your results and did it require any revisions?
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

Ok in order :)
</p>
<p>
- I would look at their experience and consult with them (most of the time Before and After pics are hard to come by online cause privacy but you can often see them in person). Beyond that, check with your health insurance! Mine was covered by Kaiser which limited the surgeons available, but looking into their experience showed that they knew their stuff. (Dr. Shih was my primary and has a ton of exp, and Dr. Kleinberger who does every surgery with him fellowed under Dr. Speigel who is very well known.
</p>
<p>
- I&#39;m a weird case... I can only go on T-Blockers, not Estrogen cause of major breast cancer risk issues (genetic) so I&#39;m not the best to speak to how long to wait.... I&#39;d recommend chatting with a couple other folks who have more experience
</p>
<p>
- I&#39;m very happy with my results... no revisions. I&#39;m def me, but a femme me and the face in the mirror makes me smile :). BIG note: the jaw takes a LONG LONG LONG time to heal, and its super normal to think they didn&#39;t do enough. My swelling is basically only now fully healed - and every month or so it got noticeably smaller. Its SUPER easy to get concerned/worried/depressed that there wasn&#39;t enough. (I was all of those at different points). I&#39;d recommend being patient and giving it time and ice! Some want to get revisions and that&#39;s totally fine - but make sure you&#39;re fully healed before you make that call (IMO - I&#39;m not a doctor, obv listen to them)
</p>
<p>
Of course! This type of stuff was super helpful for me - just trying to return the favor :)
