I swear I&#39;m not trying to monopolize the sub, but I feel like updating and sharing this experience is important, due to Dr. Freet&#39;s lack of online results. I&#39;ll put a TLDR at the bottom too.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s start with the beginning.
</p>
<p>
My first surgeon I looked at was Allen Dulan. He felt very impersonal and disinterested to me. He also treats this surgery as out patient... which terrifies me. But, if he&#39;s your choice, don&#39;t let me discourage you.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, I had a surgery date with Dr. Richard Santucci. He gave me his email for questions about the surgery, but once my insurance fell through, he basically said stop bothering him. Again, don&#39;t let me discourage you, you only have my take on a situation.
</p>
<p>
My insurance then directs me to Dr. Freet. I can find very little about him or his results. But,  I decide to make a consultation appointment. During the appointment he&#39;s warm, genuine, and willing to share his results. He explained his history with the surgery, and with surgery as a whole. He gave me his personal phone number,  and his nurse line number, and told me to ask questions. Another thing to note, he has no BMI cutoff. Which was something Dr. Santucci had told me, and then later changed, but again, pick who works for you.
</p>
<p>
I was offered a date within 3 weeks of the consultation. And one on January 8th. I took the one on the 8th. Between the consultation and the surgery, I must have asked about a million questions, all of which were answered with patience and warmth.
</p>
<p>
I had another consultation in person on the 6th, and knew I was in good hands. A couple days later, I was in the hospital, his staff were respectful to a T. I never once questioned if I made the right choice. I was wheeled into the OR as they were finishing prep. Dr. Freet was already there, teasing me slightly. Saying things like &#34;I was so looking forward to this, I even washed my hands first.&#34;
</p>
<p>
After the surgery, I remember waking up in my room with Dr. Freet standing there, he asked how I was doing and if I needed anything. He even, himself, got me a warm blanket and extra pillow.
</p>
<p>
Every day, he would show up in my room, and talk for a bit. When he finally released me, I was scared. I texted him with some concerns the first night, and he answered as soon as he could. He even called me while driving home one night because I was really scared I had an infection.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been 3 weeks. He still answers texts, and I have a few more follow ups with him. He&#39;s always patient, never talks down to me, and is very kind.
</p>
<p>
Folx, I want to share my results with you so people don&#39;t shy away from an amazing surgeon. When I first saw my pussy, I was expecting her to look bruised and raw... instead,  she looked ordinary. Partially due to his long experience as a reconstructive surgeon.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: Dr. Freet is warm and kind, attentive, and has great results. If you give him a chance, you&#39;ll be in good hands. Feel free to ask me questions.

Additionally, he expects you to use the largest dilator 30 min 3x daily as soon as you start dilation. If, like me, your body rejects this notion, talk to him and work out a schedule that includes part time with the smaller one, and part time with the largest.

I have recently had my consultation with Dr. Freet in Houston I do live in the Houston area all my paperwork has been turned in and I am currently waiting to be put on schedule most likely in October and the reason there’s not a lot of online pictures is he works for the University of Texas they will not allow this to happen if someone like you post them that is fine I have seen a few things a few of his pictures of his work I have read a lot of compliments I do agree he seems to have a very nice bedside manner very nice person to speak to I hope his results are as phenomenal as some of the other people I have seen my insurance makes it very limited on who I can pick from but I am feeling confident through posts and pictures that he will be the right choice for myself also and thank you for sharing  your pictures

Thank you for such a detailed review! I&#39;m considering Dr. Freet myself but there isn&#39;t much information out there. I know he works for the university and they might have rules about him showing pictures online or whatever, but did you get to see pictures at your in-person consultation? And, if you&#39;re not from the area, how long did you have to stay in Houston? How long did you stay in the hospital? If you&#39;re comfortable sharing, where did you stay while you were there after you left the hospital? Thank you!

I did get to see pictures. Plan to stay around 15 days in Houston. We stayed at the residence inn, by Mariott on westpark. It&#39;s affordable AND the handicap room is great for post surgery. I was in the hospital 4 or 5 days. You want to arrive 3 days before your surgery day. And yes, in person you will see pictures. You can also see my pics here, or I can DM you.

Honestly Dr Freet is great. I had my top surgery with him in 2020 and there was unfortunately some extra tissue that had to be removed a year later, he had no issues going back in and he has always been very responsive in my healing journey. I just had a bottom surgery consultation with him and he was as friendly as ever, making jokes and making sure I don’t feel uncomfortable. Asked a million questions and got an answer to all of them. He’s a great doctor that’s under a lot of hospital red tape.

Probably, get a consultation with him if you&#39;re interested. My results are largely due to the fact I&#39;m fat.

Thank you for posting this. I&#39;m nervous and he&#39;s my surgeon. I do like him, but it&#39;s great to see others do too.

i initial looked in dr.freet finding his farming lifestyle interesting. due to insurance issues, his office, from what i was told they didn&#39;t accept insurance. me evening taking my time to make a visit to his office, at that time with anti-trans law and people. im pretty sure people were on their toes. so hopefully they are more open with dealing with health insurance, rather private or Medicaid. someone has to get paid. so agin i reach ouot to insurance carrier and he does accept. just wondering if a women physician would be better with surgery considering. so just to get the ball rooling, tense within lgbtq community is relax. hopefully more people, surgeons are open to people in differnt situation. my popular opinion.
