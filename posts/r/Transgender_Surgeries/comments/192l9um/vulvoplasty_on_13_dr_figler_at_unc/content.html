Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t been around in a while but found this community immensely helpful when I was researching and planning my bottom surgery. Well it is finally done and I got to see my results yesterday when my bolster dressing and catheter were removed. I am completely thrilled with the results and with everything about this procedure. Dr Figler and his staff are top notch and the nursing staff at UNC Hospital in Hillsborough was amazing. So far I have had zero pain. Here&#39;s a couple of pics of the results just 5 days post surgery

Thanks, I don&#39;t know why they aren&#39;t posting. I have tried twice
</p>
<p>
Mine was minimal depth so actually neither PI or PPT. As far as I know he doesn&#39;t do PPT but his PI is supped to be very good. I am also local. About an hour from his office

Figler does the Graft-Only vaginoplasty and I believe they also offer a peritoneal flap vaginoplasty (but that one has to be done at UNC Chapel Hill with a co-surgeon).

Hey! Im Vanessa! Im 23 and have been transitioning for 10 years! I was wondering What does PPT and PI mean? I have a consultation with Dr. Figler in November! This is my first major surgery regarding my transition! It‚Äôs a lot of information and I‚Äôm a little overwhelmed but so excited! Also would you know if Cigna is a good insurance to cover surgery?
