in and out sleeping all night. the room has a huge tv, so watched detective Pikachu. a wild movie, like wtf plot.
</p>
<p>
gas pain and nausea increased today, but little nerve or lik pussy pain. im basically taking oxy every once in awhile. it helps sleeping, but def doesnt feel good after.
</p>
<p>
farting is honestly a gift from god.

be sure to get your food order setup. like they kind of messed up when id go on a solid diet, which meant i didn&#39;t really pick my breakfast and lunch today. make sure you make it clear from the get go if ur a vegetarian.

<p>
tried to get up and move to the chair, but i got dizzy and nauseous, which is common for me post any surgery. i had to lie back down, but theyll probably make me try again ü•≤.
</p>
<p>
mostly sleep, somesolid food, and tiktoks. id advise you to bring your own snacks to munch on throughout the day. Ripple protein shakes are really good for getting some calories easily.

Tks for the update. üëçüèªon the food order tip. Is this something I or perhaps my wife should try to do when I/we get up to 11 on Day 0? Hang in there. It will get better every day.

ya i think so. you usually order from the ipad in the room, but initially it wont have all your options. also i got a little ambitious about what i could eat. my nasuea and cramping has really limited my diet. hopefully better today
