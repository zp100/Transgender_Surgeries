Some people get lucky and have good results (I know few), but the amount of horror stories, makes it seem like something is wrong
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been there with a friend who had surgery, and the facilities look... idk... not the worst, but not the same as a big hospital
</p>
<p>
The way kamol is driven by money, and makes do many promises, with so many surgeries at the same time, makes it obvious he isn&#39;t in all of them
</p>
<p>
My guess is that it is based on how much you pay, and that if you pay well, and your situation is normal and nothing out if the ordinary, you are probably going to be fine, and have even good results
</p>
<p>
But if you pay less, he&#39;ll agree bit probably let someone else get experience by performing your surgery...
</p>
<p>
I have no way to prove it, it is mostly a feeling based on the fact that everyone who I know had good luck there and also paid a lot...
</p>
<p>
I would still never go there, just because I don&#39;t want to risk it...

The problem is not the good examples, the problems is how complications are treated, and the frequency of complications.
</p>
<p>
Vulva- + Vaginoplasty is such major surgery, even the most skilled surgeons will never be able to guarantee that all goes well, but a good surgeon, will own up to their mistakes, at least in the first few weeks, will be there in a matter of hours, if anything goes real sideways. Also, trust-worthy surgeons are doing the whole surgery they claim they do, which is one of the major criticisms Kamol is facing - apparently he tends to leave the OR once patient&#39;s are asleep, and often leaves the majority of the surgery to a lot less experienced student&#39;s of his.

That&#39;s not evidence for me.
</p>
<p>
The whining of individual people is also irrelevant to me. On the one hand, because influencers generally exaggerate in order to generate more reach (tears work best) - on the other hand, because the expectations of some individuals are extremely high, so that they often wouldn&#39;t even meet the expectations of an ordinary woman.
</p>
<p>
Apart from that, I wanted to make sure that every doctor has their not so good results. No matter whether Kamol, Supon - but here you always have to differentiate what the specific problem is.
</p>
<p>
In the healing process, for example, your own discipline and personal lifestyle are crucial. Alcohol and nicotine, for example, are a very poor basis for good wound healing. And yes - dilating is annoying, but it is extremely important.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we have to mention all the many patients who have no problems after their operation and the individual cases who are not happy and are now loudly saying on the Internet that Kamol is not good. At the same time, don&#39;t show any pictures, just talk badly. Maybe this is also due to the fact that Kamol doesn&#39;t do free revisions after a year (which I personally understand).

By the way - I had my gender reassignment surgery at Kamol at the beginning of January 2024 and I&#39;m still super satisfied.

Ι don&#39;t know if I can trust her considering how she keeps posting nsfw stuff despite claiming she was completely butchered and has no drive due to it as well as liking comments with generalizations about SRS made by transphobes.

You should never trust a single individual on these matters. That’s why it’s so important to choose from surgeons with many independent reviews and post-op photos. Luckily there’s tons for Dr Kamol.

I too can only say good things about Kamol.
</p>
<p>
By the way - Kamol is a single doctor, but he has a complete clinic with many operating rooms. If I counted correctly, there are 5 or 6.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I don&#39;t care at all whether Kamol operates himself or one of his &#34;students&#34; (who are always fully trained surgeons).
</p>
<p>
If complications arise during your stay with Kamol, they will be resolved.
</p>
<p>
But a lot of the healing process depends on the patient herself...
</p>
<p>
Does she carry out the dilation regularly?
</p>
<p>
Is the patient living healthily so that healing can continue to progress?
</p>
<p>
Even if wounds are closed on the outside, a body still needs a long time to complete the healing process.
</p>
<p>
So if complications arise because, for example, the patient does not dilate regularly, why should Kamol do free corrective surgery to eliminate problems?
</p>
<p>
And during the consultation about the surgery, Dr. Kamol explains things very well. It&#39;s just that good surgeons are generally not great storytellers. They answer questions and if you don&#39;t have any, the conversation isn&#39;t very long.
</p>
<p>
I am extremely satisfied with my result from Kamol, even after the so-called Honeymoon time!
