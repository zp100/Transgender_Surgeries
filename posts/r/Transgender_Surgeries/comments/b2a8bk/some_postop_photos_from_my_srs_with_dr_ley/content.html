Hey everyone,
</p>
<p>
I wanted to document for the community Dr. Ley&#39;s practice of SRS. If you don&#39;t know who she is, she&#39;s a trans female doctor who&#39;s partnered with Dr. Meltzer, and will eventually take over full practice of the Meltzer clinic. I chose her because of hers and Dr. Meltzer&#39;s reputation and locality (I&#39;m in California, they&#39;re in Arizona) as well as the fact she was in network and could work on my timeline (I started HRT in July 2017, FFS I in January 2018, BA in April 2018, SRS in October 2018, labiaplasty in February 2019, and doing FFS II this month).
</p>

I&#39;ve attached two photos from an open view - one 4 months post SRS (February 2019) but before labiaplasty [the second photo] and one 4 weeks post labiaplasty (aka now). IMO, I&#39;m happy with the results, and have some issues with granulation inside my vaginal vault (but getting treated ATM) and had urinary issues pre-labiaplasty (and was catheterized in total between the surgeries for 3 weeks and 3 days, which was awful). All in all I&#39;m also happy functionally (not 100% sure if I self-lubricate, but I definitely produce pre-cum and ejaculate on orgasm, and both my vagina and clitoris are fully orgasmic).

Here&#39;s the photos:
