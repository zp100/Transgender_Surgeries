It’s been a crazy 3 weeks. Hoping to continue recovery. Few questions.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Wound dehiscence, how long did yours take to heal? I have one that occurred right near my vaginal canal over this past weekend. Extremely uncomfortable wish relief soon
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Discharge, still a large amount of discharge daily. When did you start seeing that slow down? Currently more than before but all same color.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dilation, when did that become easier? Which week?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Any ideas on emotional guidance. This surgery is a doozy and I’m emotionally effing exhausted. I dunno how to get more out of the funk.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Any guidance is appreciated.

I had some slight dehiscence near the introitus. I kept putting Aquacel as directed and it healed in a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
As for the emotional stuff, I was a wreck for the first 3 to 4 weeks. Vaginoplasty was like nothing else I’ve ever experienced. Now at around week 5 I feel much better about it but it was hard for awhile. A good therapist is helpful for navigating your emotions during this period.

Whatever you do, don’t stop dilating!
