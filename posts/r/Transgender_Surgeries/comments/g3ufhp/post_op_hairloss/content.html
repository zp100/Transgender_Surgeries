It was listed as a possible risk to ffs, but like 15-25% chances.  If true, it got me.
</p>
<p>
I lost as much as 20-30% of my hair.  Allover, but especially on top and even more near the incisions for the scalp advance.
</p>
<p>
Anyone who would like to share their experience with this or who has an idea on the time frame for regrowth, I&#39;m interested in what you have to say.
</p>
<p>
Thanks

So I had ffs almost 4 months ago, and I experienced a LOT of shock hair loss along the hairline incision, and then just lots of shedding.
</p>
<p>
What my surgeon said is it takes about 3-6 months for those hairs to start poking through again, but I noticed them around 1.5 months.
</p>
<p>
It definitely sucks but you just have to be patient and let your body heal! This is a great time for hats or bangs haha.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully everything starts growing back in for you!!

2020 is just the fucking worst :(
</p>
<p>
Thanks.  It&#39;s basically what I expected but I&#39;m heartbroken. Bangs will be coming when my transplants come in.  Guessing the same time? We&#39;ll see.

I had a non trans surgery and had a ton of hair loss. Like half my hair was shoulder length and half was in the awkward growing out stage. It sucks but it passes.

So it&#39;s possible that srs is round 2? Yay ðŸ˜’
</p>
<p>
About how long after surgery did you feel like it was ok again?  Maybe not completely regrown, but not as bad as it was right after?
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

Yeah I think its a possible side effect of any surgery. Mine was removing a tumor from my leg. It was about 6 months. I went to a stylist and she helped it a lot. She described it as having 2 different haircuts at once.

I just lost so much density.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a mess in the back where they had to shave a strip.  I&#39;m half tempted to chop it off ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜­

I couldn&#39;t bring myself to cut it off. I had spent 3.5 years growing it out. Good luck! It gets better!

Woah, what? You can get shock hair loss on your head from surgery thatâ€™s not on your head?

My doctor told me it was from the anaesthesia. It throws hormone levels off, specifically cortisol levels in the body.

My shock hair loss was mostly along the hairline incision. I didn&#39;t even notice how much I lost until it started growing back. I also had some hairloss that I noticed in other places but not to the point where anyone would notice it. I would just notice hairs falling out when I&#39;d wash my hair.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately hair loss is common with any procedures involving general anesthesia.

Damn, it&#39;s going to happen again then :(
</p>
<p>
Along the incision is the worst.  But the first shower I could have, which was after over three weeks, omg... Kept coming out and out and was so hard on me.
</p>
<p>
Lost more over the next few weeks, but I think it peaked.  High price for passing
