listen I know this is a really long post but this place has helped to keep my sanity in this bonkers process so I promised myself I would post my experience too for others- When I was researching I could not get enough of the details so, I am scheduled for the end of october and wanted to recap everything up to now.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
In February 2021 I requested a consultation at Mount Sinai - I did want to see Dr. Avenessian but she had a wait that was sooo much longer than Dr. Pang. I decided that they went through the same fellowship program, and I hadn&#39;t heard anything bad about Pang from anyone before so I went with that.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I did schedule two other consultations, one with Dr. Bluebond-Langner at NYU Langone, that I guess in theory I&#39;m still waiting for for June 21, 2022. I&#39;m 32 years old and I have okay insurance, but who knows what my situation is by next summer? and the other consult was with Dr. McGinn at the Papillon center. Not as long of a wait but a couple big things. She doesn&#39;t take insurance. My insurance doesn&#39;t do the out-of-network thing, and also, even if it did, I can&#39;t front that much cash. Also I already live in NYC and like I know this is a big deal and I would travel if necessary but like, there are already some of the world&#39;s best right here! It dramatically cuts costs on literally everything from lodging to a caretaker to travel etc.
</p>
</li>

I decided pretty early on that I was going to go with Dr. Pang at Mount Sinai. I know that not everyone shares this sentiment, but I actually think that Mount Sinai provides a relatively high level of support throughout the whole process. I feel taken care of there and like I&#39;m not falling through the cracks. The folks who work in the offices of McGinn and BBL both at times were curt and I felt like I was somehow bothering them with questions or for more information....like I know that this is your entire life but hi this is the biggest most important decision of my life can you take me seriously? I haven&#39;t felt that way about Mount Sinai.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So In February 2021 I started the process, and from there, all patients are required to be cleared by the mental health and social work team. On February 5th, the social worker contacted me and asked me why I wanted to do this and what questions I had. Shortly after, my mental and physical pre-surgical consults were scheduled. That was a little more waiting- March 31st. Still, only about 2 months. I felt like the other doctors offices left these responsibilities on me. It felt as if Mount Sinai was saying, &#34;this is complicated and we will do it ourselves&#34; which I really appreciated.
</p>
<p>
The mental and physical health screenings were relatively straightforward.  After they cleared me following pre-consults (this meant blood work had to come back, and I needed to get my PCP and mental health letters to them), they called me to schedule the consultation.  My consultation was June 29, 2021.  So February to June, 4 months between contacting and making contact with the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
At the consultation, I met with the PA, Jasmine, who is wonderful, and then with Dr. Pang, who is also wonderful and I felt like I could fully trust. I always thought that I would prefer a woman to do this, but I appreciate a gay man too ha. Like...he understands the queer experience and the feeling of having someone not completely cishet repping is of value for me.  At the end of the somewhat brief consultation, my surgery date was scheduled- October 25, 2021.  So! Pretty darn fast, I feel: February 1 - October 25, 2021. 9 months.
</p>
<p>
And frankly, I don&#39;t know how it could be shorter than that for me. Psychically it was a lot. Not that I wasn&#39;t fully decided, I was...but just, processing the end of life with a dick and starting life with a WAP...It&#39;s a lot I think! Also I needed to make lots of arrangements with my Caretaker (read: sort of new boyfriend), time away from work....all that boring stuff. ALSO, and this is a big one:  Mount Sinai can do the hair removal there! Besides feeling like I don&#39;t have to worry about doing it correctly because they are doing it for me, my insurance covers hair removal for the purpose of surgery. and the hospital&#39;s machine is way way better than the salon&#39;s (have been doing my face and legs for forever). So those are all the reasons this has been a pretty good experience so far.. BUT, there have been some hiccups and stuff to look out for. The worst part of all this is the bureaucracy and dealing with multiple people. They bill stuff wrong sometimes and I haven&#39;t had to fight with my insurance so much as I have had to discuss a lot of stuff with the mount sinai billing department. kind of annoying and have been sent into a panic a couple times over a false alarm billing error.
</p>
<p>
ok so I‚Äôm a month out and I&#39;m feeling terrified but confident. I have a FFS consult also with Dr. Pang in January - because once you get in the system with him scheduling other stuff becomes a lot easier.  I will make a post after surgery prob‚Ä¶I am staying in a ground floor airbnb in my neighborhood for the first 3 weeks because I have 3 flights of stairs. I&#39;m sad not to be home with my cat while I heal at first but I&#39;m trying really really hard to keep the healing process front and center.  So, premature post, but to write this all down somewhere was helpful ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
</p>
<p>
A couple of Q‚Äôs seeking A‚Äôs:
</p>
<p>
How long should my boyfriend take off work to be with me all day?
</p>
<p>
The idea of not being able to sit upright is kind of unsettling. Any insight? How long did that stage last for you?
</p>
<p>
Ok I think that‚Äôs it! This has of course been just MY experience and like‚Ä¶the most important part hasn‚Äôt arrived yet so jury is still v much out. So‚Ä¶far from an endorsement.

Thanks for writing this. I&#39;ve been railroaded into using Mt. Sinai by my insurance and finding info/reviews about them has been hard. This really helped.

Hey! Thanks so much for writing all this up! I just scheduled a consult with Bluebond-Lagner but it&#39;s in 2023 and my insurance covers her and the surgery right now but I&#39;m like A) I might  be working a different job and have different insurance and B) 2 goddamn years for just the consult!! And I honestly want the consult largely because I&#39;m dealing with peyronie&#39;s and want to hear a surgeon&#39;s opinion/start doing what I can to prepare.
</p>
<p>
So it&#39;s really nice to hear that there&#39;s other options in NYC and I will definitely think about scheduling with Dr. Pang if he takes my insurance.
</p>
<p>
Just a heads up, if you&#39;re for sure not going to go with Bluebond-Lagner, it would be really cool if you canceled your appointment. I was on the phone with them today and they basically said there&#39;s no wait-list so if someone cancels they can fill that spot but they won&#39;t automatically bump the next person up.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;d be doing a favor to the next person that calls that office :)
