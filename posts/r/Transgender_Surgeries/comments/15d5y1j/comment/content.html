Just curious. I know it gives more depth and better aesthetics than penile inversion (sounds good, right?) but not so many women are interested in this particular type of gender confirmation surgery. There isn&#39;t much information about this procedure either. Why is that? Thanks.

I think there&#39;s plenty of misinformation, but also the prospect of having a part of your large intestine resected. At the outset, it seems like signing up for long term complications associated with the GI tract, not to mention it sounds pretty invasive.

Yep, I didn’t want my guts messed with. It’s not hard to understand really.

PI is absolutely fine. I have great aesthetics, depth and sensation.

The primary reason why it’s rarely used is because it was replaced by PPT for patients who are not good candidates for PI. The additional depth and better aesthetics over PI that you talk about only apply if you have insufficient tissue for PI. If you don’t have sufficient tissue, you can get those same benefits from PPT as you can colon, but PPT has fewer risks. Notably, colon has risks to the digestive system not present with PPT like increased risks of intestinal blockage from scar tissue in the resected areas, risk of diversion colitis in the vagina, risk of bowel leakage, and risk of long term changes in bowel movements in the direction of looser/more watery bowels. These risks are lower or do not apply to PPT.
</p>
<p>
As a result, the medical community went from preferring PI as the primary treatment with colon as secondary for patients who were not good candidates for PI or for PI patients in need of a revision. With the growth and development of PPT, PPT replaced colon as secondary and colon was moved to tertiary for in the event that a prior PPT failed. There are a small number of surgeons who offer a variant of PPT as primary nowadays, but there isn’t a strong argument (or clear research) that colon is superior to PPT when it carries additional risks

What about doctor&#39;s who still actively practice colovaginalplasty? That&#39;s what I&#39;m leaning towards and the doctor I&#39;m looking at does specialize in it

I had my colo-vaginoplasty a few years ago.  No significant complications, no odor, great result.  Very happy with the outcome.  No bowel issues and dilating is not much of a chore anymore.  Once or twice a month when I get around to it, normally as part of a relaxing self pleasuring session.  Got mine done in Spain, barcelona.  IM Gender clinic.  Great surgical team.  They did FFS in the same session.  Recovery from both at the same time was a little rough, but manageable.  After two weeks quite mobile.  After two months back to 90% normal and working a physical job.

Not at all.  I have pleasant but not excessive moisture and some self-lubrication.  I do need to add a little more for penetrative sex.

And how much did the vaginoplasty portion cost?

Really?  How’d you get there?  No.  It’s probably because prior to the surgery there is a strict diet for a week, and it’s hard to stick to.  I think some women end up with some bacteria from their bowels in the neovagina as a result, causing a residual odour that can take many months or longer to dissipate.

Sigmoid Colon girl here, actually the walls and structure of the flap used are very stretchy and durable and a lot less likely to tear than PPT, my surgeon recommends it over any other method.

I&#39;m a Dr. Chett girl myself. Almost 2 months from my surgery. There is still a tiny smell, but it has really come down from the first couple weeks. It is not at all as bad as people make it out to be

Yeah! When I went to Dr. chett, he was raving about it a lot. He convinced me, and from talking to other Dr. chett girls, they were also convinced. He recommends this a lot.

He convinced me to with points like it more durable for rough S*x and a puss that cleans itself was also very important to me. But i had complications since. Had 2 revisions and im laying on bed now searching the web for colovaginal fistula&#39;s because the discharge in my pantyliner is brown and smells foul or very acidic and i had occasional belly cramps since a few days.
</p>
<p>
I thought i was slowly getting better after 8 months and then this happens. Stil waiting for a reply from Chett and got an GP appointment but i fear for the worst :( Suffering from Pelvic Floor Dysfunction doesnt help either. I&#39;m so super tight i haven&#39;t been able to have intercoarse yet :(

I really hope it&#39;s not too bad. I know my discharge was brown for the first 6-7 months. Then it stopped all of a sudden. I thought brown was normal for the longest time.

Thanks i didnt know people had brown discharge for so many month&#39;s after.
</p>
<p>
There is also air/gas coming out of my vag. I&#39;m not sure if discharge or bacteria up there can cause gas because i don&#39;t often douche my vag. And other symptoms wich are related to a colovaginal fistula. I hope to god i am wrong and i have a bad infection but that doesn&#39;t explain the pain and farty noises i sometimes hear inside my vag.

I&#39;d def get an answer from Dr chett but when dilating air sometimes does go inside. And I think he instructs people to never douche. The funny part is I remember nurses mentioning douching after 8 months.

Im not sure actually lol. I finally got into contact with a trans ladyfriend who told me from experience that i shouldnt dilate incase i have a colovaginal fistula and should await my GP appointment. She told me she had to get a Ileostomy to fix it and that i have a rough time ahead. I hope its fixed soon

Will you always have excessive discharge where you’ll always have to have panty liners on?

I think it&#39;s different for everyone. If you dialate 2-3 times a day and douche, then you need a pantyliner for anything that might come out later. Then again i have very high muscle tension so my pelvic floor muscles might prevent goo from coming out easy. If i dialate once and dont douche i can go without pantyliner tho. But when i drink alcohol or take stimulant drugs then i have this yellowish boogerlike discharge in the morning
</p>
<p>
It really puts my lifestyl into perspective for me. If you have a healthy lifestyle, excersize and eat/drink healthy then you&#39;ll have a healthy vag 😉✌️ hope this helped

I will say there are a fair few risks with PPT tho, I&#39;m 9 months post op and my canal has slowly been closing shut despite how many specialists I see or the fact I e been dilating daily for at least 2 hours since my day  of surgery, I now have my doctor (Dr. Powers) recommending colon vaginoplasty to help fix my depth issue as I&#39;m now down from 5.5 in to about 3.5

Is the issue specifically PPT though or is it your surgeon? For example, I know several people who have been to say Wittenberg for PPT and had complications like stenosis or fistulas, but I’ve heard very little about that from Bluebond-Langner/Zhao
</p>
<p>
Daily dilation for 2 hours seems off to me too. For example, my surgeon recommends 30 min dilations 3x/day and stressed that frequency of dilation matters more than duration

I was doing 3 times a day for the first 4 months then 2 a day for 6 the reason why it took so long is that I wasn&#39;t able to get to full depth until about an hour into dilation  (mind you I had a pelvic floor PT so I learned all the tricks it was just v tight). I will say I did go to Wittenbergs clinic (it was Dr. Bonnington) so that does track lol I&#39;m very happy with the aesthetics but yea I wasn&#39;t really told about Stenosis and I had to find out that&#39;s what was happening like 3-4 months After the fact by doing online research and having PT confirm lol

Hello,
</p>
<p>
At a point in my life I had to undergo a gut surgery and recovery was very painful, long and horrible. I also known someone who had a part remove a part of it.
</p>
<p>
For those reason, I&#39;m not confident with getting colon. The researches I&#39;ve done also revealed to me they would take half of this part of the colon, it seems a lot. Recovery is harder, a lower bmi is required and I&#39;m getting in my 40&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
These are my personal reasons. Also I am 95% attracted to women and I assume I will never have sexual intercourse with men. If it happens one day and the dudes isn&#39;t happy with my vagina, well good bye. I do things for myself first.

I had sigmoid colon in June 15th so a little over a month ago at kaiser.in SF. The surgery itself went really well and I had a hematoma on my right labia but that is a complication that can happen either any of them.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had much smell once I took probiotics and was douching regularly. I think my discharge has definitely gone down quite a bit and haven&#39;t been wearing pads the last few days.
</p>
<p>
My scars are healing and given a year probably will be negligible.
</p>
<p>
I am super happy so far with everything and got cleared for exercise and swimming on Thursday!

Thank you for your response. I am amazed to discover that there is a surgeon who performs this specific procedure in the Bay Area especially at Kaiser. I had been researching surgeons who specialize in this and couldn&#39;t find any. I have a consultation scheduled with Dr. Maurice Garcia. Initially, I had believed no surgeon in the Bay Area performed this type of graft, so I had made an appointment with Dr. Garcia in Los Angeles.

I had suporn technique and now after more than a year I’ve had zero complications, Buuuuut, I’m pretty dry when I’m not aroused and even when aroused it takes like pretty long into the sex until my canal starts lubricating (I don’t know where it comes from &amp; I’m not sure if it lubricates at all, buuut I know for sure that sex becomes way easier and he can thrust faster without us reaching for lube during the entire sex, so I guess that’s lubrication?
</p>
<p>
The only reason to why I’d prefer colon or ppt is the lubrication but that’s also not guaranteed.
</p>
<p>
Also, I’m not ok with the idea of my colon (with all its bacterial cultures and stuff) become my vaginal canal. Also too invasive

You do realize thos &#34;bacterial cultures and stuff&#34; goes away right? They produce this particular colon smell. And after surgery you get antibiotics and kill them and the smell off.

I had my surgery on September 8 2022. Colon vaginoplasty. I read a few here that mentioned the scars, but there&#39;s a new technique atleast with Dr chett that&#39;s laproscopic colon technique, it only left me with 3 dots.  One below my belly, and the other two lower belly area ig.  They just blend it after a while.
</p>
<p>
The smell isn&#39;t too bad in my experience. It def has a smell, but I wouldn&#39;t describe it as bad, and it&#39;s not strong either.  (Edit: my boyfriend saw this and agreed)
</p>
<p>
I do discharge a fair amount where I don&#39;t require pads, but I do use them to keep my undies clean for longer, I .
</p>
<p>
I think I covered a few cons here. Feel free to ask any questions below.

This is a tough question to answer honestly. Everyone is different due to genetics and diet I think. And it&#39;s hard for me to compare because because it&#39;s been a long time I&#39;ve dated a cis girl. But going back 4 years from my memory, I&#39;d say almost the same if not slightly less?  I wouldn&#39;t take this answer too seriously lol.

Thanks for chiming in on this. There have been gobs of people, like you, who have had Colon and I have yet to hear them complain about all the complications that are always being thrown around. As best as I can tell from feedback, the smell issue seems to be a bit overblown at this point. This isn&#39;t a new technique, so there has been plenty of time for complications to unfold and come to light.

Originally it was possible smell for ever for me and and it’s a myth , the new environment as a vaginal canal does not have feces going through it so this clears up in a short time and changes .
</p>
<p>
I started out with Scrotal PI 2019 because of the thinking above and ended up back in Bangkok Nov. 2022  redoing the whole canal except the entrance obviously to attach it to and get it fixed once and for all to  be truly functional without this lifetime hard core dilation that never ends with PI really !
</p>
<p>
Sigmoid or jejunum is a major surgery ! unlike going from taking an outside PI skin  going inside Vaginoplasty , it’s easier for the surgeon .
</p>
<p>
Sigmoid and jejunum is the Rolls Royce of vaginoplasty’s compared to PI , I’m biased on PPT because the tissue is so thin it could tear dilating or rough sex !
</p>
<p>
If you want the minora proper aesthetics , clitoris aesthetics etc. your limited with PI quite frankly and will never have a breather with dilation for a life time .
</p>
<p>
I have post op Sigmoid 2022 with a tough stretchy canal , minimal dilation , no smell 9 months later , 7 and a bit inches using the large Orange Soul Source dilator every 3 days for a couple of hours , the fix was Sigmoid for me and the way to go - Why have a vagina if it is always going to be a problem keeping it stretched to stupidity for a life time is my thoughts - choose well getting revisions is very difficult finding a new surgeon to fix fk’d up surgeries post op - been there did it and my last is to fix minora that could have been done right originally if I went with Sigmoid or Jejunum .
</p>
<p>
I’m biased now I admit - PI should be abolished , a waste of time playing around with it and it’s only done because it’s simple to do for the surgeon !

For me, I am going to go with peritoneal pull thru. In my research, I have settled on this. It suits me better.

I&#39;m extremely happy with my results from PPT. Colon wasn&#39;t really something I wanted to consider after a history of complications from undiagnosed Celiac when I was younger.

Neither colon or ppv are going to have sensation inside the vaginal canal (other than a sense of fullness/tightness). But that&#39;s also true of cis women.

There is some sensation inside, but not much. Some nerves were transferred inside on the surgery that I had.

There are no erogenous zones inside natal vaginas, so don&#39;t expect anything from neo vaginas. Just an FYI
</p>
<p>
You should feel stuff, yes, it just isn&#39;t going to be erogenous.

Well that G spot is not a part of the vagina itself. That is a glan out side of the vagina that has sensation just like the prostate.
</p>
<p>
The way I have always taken it when I read &#34;there is no erogenous feeling&#34; inside is just that. The skin itself doesn&#39;t have the nerves to build up enough pleasure to reach orgasm levels.
</p>
<p>
I have been playing with my wife&#39;s vagina for 30 years. She can sense pressure and fullness but just rubbing the inside without making contact with the glands (clitoris or g) it just feels like rubbing the back of the hand.

1.) erogenous is subjective. Feeling “pressure and fullness” can be sexually stimulating, and it cannot be. The most significant aspect of what makes a sensation sexually stimulating is what is happening in someone’s head when the stimulation is occurring.  Literally every fetish in the world proves this (eg. feet sucking, tickling, breath play, etc.)
</p>
<p>
2.) while I understand that the actual physical structure of the G spot is anatomically distinct from the vaginal walls, that’s like saying the sugar in a cake is physically distinct from the eggs and flour.  It’s like saying the glans isn’t really the penis, cuz the penis is
<em>
actually
</em>
mostly the corpus cavernosa.  I feel confident we are, for the most part, not surgeons on this subreddit.  I’m not using the word “vagina” to mean a precise tissue or singular organ and treating my use of the word as such is pedantic and disingenuous.
</p>
<p>
3.) I cannot stress this enough, but ANY information ANY of us provide on here is anecdotal.  None of us have performed rigorous, reproducible scientific experiments.  The difference is that I’ve provided one piece of anecdotal evidence that clearly disproves the argument “there are no erogenous zones” in vaginas and that is all I need.  Even if you had a document written and signed by every person you’ve ever had sex with saying they had no erogenous zones in their vaginas, that STILL wouldn’t prove such a blanket statement.  The existence of just one, single woman saying she has erogenous zones in her vagina disproves the original argument.  Or have we internalized misogyny so succinctly on this thread that we’ll now just be gaslighting any women who don’t agree with such an absurdly idiotic and overreaching premise?
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps.
</p>
<p>
P.S. to the person who came on a transgender surgery subreddit and called a trans woman “hostile” just because I’m not interested in playing respectability politics: please go read a book or two.  I suggest googling “transgender respectability” and just play “pin the tail” with your cursor, m’kay?? ☺️

There ARE erogenous zones inside of both natal and neo vaginas.  Erogenous means “sensitive to sexual stimulation.”  What is and isn’t erogenous is specific to each person and each sexual interaction.

I wish I knew, because I&#39;m considering depth revision and don&#39;t quite understand why I shouldn&#39;t be considering colon.

Some people claim the smell thing is a myth, others say it&#39;s very very real. In general the differences between different techniques always seems hard to really track down with confidence...

Thank you for the data point! :)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m more inclined to believe it&#39;s not really an issue, but the problem is that I have basically zero sense of smell (like, I don&#39;t even know what feces smells like, much less being able to detect it), so I think I would be very self conscious and paranoid, not being able to know for sure.

Colon is way more invasive, and it screws with your GI track, which is something I see as a major risk. Not only am I including my genitals in this now, I&#39;m including my intestines? No thanks. Like, dang, they&#39;re literally taking a bunch of your colon. It just doesn&#39;t sound &#34;low risk&#34; to me.
</p>
<p>
The possibility of the smell being way off is just not great. On this sub I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s true and that it&#39;s bullshit. I&#39;m not sure what to believe, but I&#39;ve mostly seen that the smell is very much a factor, so I&#39;ll play it safe.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also hardly performed, from my research. Many surgeons just opt for the PPT route already, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s for good reason.
</p>
<p>
And the PPT and colon methods have similar end results, but one is much more invasive. So from that stand point I can&#39;t imagine taking the risks for something I could already have gotten with less hassle.
</p>
<p>
The thing about the PPT method, is that the peritoneum is actually really good at growing back, and it&#39;s just your stomach lining, as opposed to a pretty snazzy organ that your body heavily relies on.
</p>
<p>
To each their own, but yeah, even surgeons go for PPT more often these days, so I think it&#39;s worth it to really consider why.

Thanks for the reply, this all makes a lot of sense! I still feel like I&#39;d like more hard data / facts to guide my decision, but you are convincing
</p>
<p>
Also, like you said, there&#39;s just a lot more PPT surgeons than sigmoid ones, so unless I feel strongly about sigmoid, might as well just go with what&#39;s most common

I will say I posted a little further up but I&#39;m almost 10 months post PPT and my canal has been slowly shrinking despite me dilating 2-3 hours daily ;-;. I went with Dr. Bonnington at MoZaic and they don&#39;t really know what I&#39;ve lost so much depth and so far the amount of specialists I&#39;ve seen can only speculate&gt;_&lt; going to see another this week on referral from Dr. Powers and hoping with this Ultrasound she can figure out wtf is going on.
</p>
<p>
Essentially don&#39;t believe the myth that PPT doesn&#39;t have a fair amount of complications as I&#39;m seeing a few other gals in my discord go through similar situations post op

Hey I completely understand! And for what its worth I regret nothing just the alleviation of the dysphoria has been so wild Im still having a hard time putting it into words. I just wanna give as much heads up and warning to anyone going into it bc one thing I do regret is not doing more research from other Transwomen recovering from PPT as no offense to some of the surgeons instructions butits seeming some of them may be cause for some of the aftercare complications and I wish I would&#39;ve gotten second and third opinions right after surgery a lot sooner than I di if ya feel me.

Just a few here, GET A GYNECOLOGIST APPOINTMENT AND PELVIC FLOOR THERAPIST APPOINTMENT SCHEDULED BEFORE YOUR SURGERY lol some surgeons may lightly recommend this but a lot are more lax on it but they are absolute necessities.  Second Dilate more than they tell you to. Lol that&#39;s all for now

They actually require a pelvic floor therapist visit for the surgeon I&#39;m going to, so that makes me feel better.

Me and a friend of mine did our surgery at the same date.. she did PPT and I did Colon we had our reasons for it and some of them are listed here.
</p>
<p>
But I want to talk about the recovery. The recovery was almost identical.. we both had to stop eating certain food for certain time and we both got up and going the same time. We were talking about our feelings about the recovery and we conclude we just been through the same recovery pretty much.
</p>
<p>
I was instructed to douche with sodium butyrate or coconut oil in specific way for colon to prevent smell, and she was just told to douche normally with PPT

The risk of necrosis of the skin and ending up with nothing but a scar.
</p>
<p>
If you have “little to nothing” to work with Colon vaginoplasty is an option.
</p>
<p>
I had penile inversion and only ended up with 3.5 inches of depth. And I have to dilate twice a day to hopefully keep that.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon Dr Hanna is wanting to put me off two years to revise my depth.
</p>
<p>
I have severe post surgery ptsd.
</p>
<p>
Ive had sex twice, did/could not orgasm. And the tinder date was trying to pound me. It hurt so bad.
</p>
<p>
Also my “clit” is/has prolapsed.
</p>
<p>
My vagina is unusable! Do research on results.
</p>
<p>
The results I’ve seen were alway Necrosis of the skin, pieces of skin out of place etc the list goes on.

I consulted with Dr. Hanna because I had 4 inches depth (now 3.5) remaining after surgery with RBL/Zhao. He didn&#39;t have a clue about colon methods, and acted like I had enough depth and shouldn&#39;t seek revision at all. &#34;The rules of biology don&#39;t change,&#34; he said. His tone was more like &#34;Sorry, you&#39;re SOL&#34;. I think what he told me is irresponsible of him, because a good colon revision could save me.
</p>
<p>
Maybe he&#39;s right about waiting two years, idk, but you could go ahead and start consulting with other surgeons in the meantime to chip away at possible wait lists.

From what I’ve been able to figure out so far, some of the reasons are: it’s much more invasive and leaves you with visible abdominal scarring. I haven’t read anything about a smell, but there is apparently the chance for a discharge, which I’m guessing could include a smell. This usually lightens after the first three months I guess. It also has a heightened chance for complications, especially abdominal blockages, though just how heightened I haven’t been able to find out.

<p>
There is now a newer more modern technique - PPV (peritoneal pull-down vaginoplasty) that had the advantages of sigmoid colon in regards to depth without the disadvantages in regards to intestinal recovery and also smell.
</p>
<p>
External appearance doesn’t depend on which surgical technique is used for the neo vagina unless there’s not enough skin in a penile inversion and the surgeon makes depth a priority over appearance.
</p>
<p>
You should always tell your surgeon how you rank the following: depth, sensation, and appearance as there are trade offs between the three.

Technically the various techniques of each surgeon are slightly different from each other, but the basic idea is the same.
</p>
<p>
In Thailand they usually do the first part of the vagina with an equivalent penile inversion since the technique for making the aesthetics this way is well developed, and the rest of the depth using PPV.

Well you can get very good depth with good surgeon doing PIV with scrotal graft technique- I have 7.5 inches and that ar my grand age ( over 59 years plus ) and no FFS lol Also there IS known cancer risk with colon technique as well as offensive smells etc these ARE well documented  So if you can afford newer technique PPV or with banks / suporn  Otherwise go for Dr Sutin  who can obtain depth by his altered PIV method

I had SRS-PPV with Dr Kamol as this seemed the best technique to get as close to a cis vagina as possible, and I am very happy with it.  However, I was given the option of PPV skin graft or Colon, and each has advantages and disadvantages. My understanding is that the advantages of Colon are less dilation, and it is very hard to damage it when healed with rough sex. The disadvantages are that if it fails, there are fewer options remaining, possible smell, possible excess discharge, possible bowel issues, and longer recovery due to the bowel trauma. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages. Good luck with whatever you chose! X

I just had a pertineal pull through revision from a penile inversion in which my vagina closed up in me. I love my results. There isn&#39;t a foul smell...I&#39;m lazy with dilation but even still if I dilate twice a week my depth is still there (peritoneal pull through gives you more depth and doesn&#39;t close as easily.)..and I actually have a muscosa...with the penial inversion I had no mucosa, and barely any depth. Definitely would NOT recommend P.I. technique as it&#39;s becoming old and outdated.

Main reasons I have seen are: Discharge can be heavy up to and including briefs, scarring, complications such as fissures with the intestines, GI complications, and sometimes a strong odor from the mucus.

Ummm i want mine fixed with colon. Its the surgeons in the UK that are scared of it and protecting their profit margins as urologists and just doing the PI.
</p>
<p>
PI works for a lot of girls but I&#39;m one of many that it didn&#39;t,  it&#39;s just painful and i cannot use it. My only requirements were that it looked passable and i could fit a lovense lush in it. It fails spectacularly on both accounts.

I know patients who unexpectedly had colon issues fixed because of a colon vaginoplasty. So it&#39;s a two way street. Where there are possible risks, there are also possible rewards.

If your are circumcised or smaller, the aesthetics don&#39;t come into play if the surgeons uses scrotal tissue or a skin graft from elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Colovag is the most invasive so that&#39;s a big reason, but it is more proven and studied in trans women when compared to peritoneal methods. It also is more robust and elastic compared to peritonial. But the excess wetness and small chance of colon cancer can be too much to comprehend for some.
</p>
<p>
All methods have ups and downs.

Doesn&#39;t leave you in a good position if you have complications or need a revision, compared to other SRS techniques that are more easily revised and less invasive.

<li>
PPT gives most of the same depth / aesthetic benefits if you want that.

<li>
PI is fine if you don&#39;t care about extra depth.

I&#39;m opposed to it because surgery to your digestive tract can cause serious chronic gastric issues.  I had to have surgery to repair my stomach valve and spent the next 18 months sequestered at home vacillating daily between impaction and explosive diarrhea.  I never left the house for longer than 60 minutes.  Obviously it effects everyone differently but I know how it affects me, so no colon graft, no jejune.  I wouldn&#39;t have my GI tract cut into again for anything less than cancer.  If I didn&#39;t have a work from home job I would have been in serious trouble.

Hi I&#39;m almost 6 months post op from dr theerapong (sigmoid SRS) I&#39;m 1000000% satisfied with everything depth/orgasm/wetness not at all bad smell. I think people just afraid of it and if some of surgeries have gone wrong because after all it&#39;s human body and doctor&#39;s also have their limits they ain&#39;t God&#39;s, so people then spread wrong information. In my opinion sigmoid SRS if one and only superior srs procedures that is exists, don&#39;t forget it was invented for cis females!

Foul smell is mostly a myth. It is only present during the first three months and goes away.

That&#39;s what I want. I&#39;m not 100% decided to get srs. But if I do, I want an ascending colon one. It&#39;s the only variety to creat a self cleaning vagina.

Agreed with some others. It seems like a good option but, I&#39;d do tilapia option over that. The colon option does have much more recover, complication rates and as stated more invasive. Plus you really do alter your gi tract and have issues there. So for me this was a no brainer on the one I didn&#39;t want.

No there aren&#39;t many doing the tilapia skin option at all. I know one in Brazil. I know when I read on it, sounded similar to the peritoneal method.

Fish skin grafts are making way in the US. Kerecis is a standardized graft material from cod which I believe Dr. Gupta in Ohio and Dr. Del Corral in Maryland have experimented with, among others.

One question though. Is it covered by insurance? Seems like my insurance (Aetna) considers Kerecis fish skin graft experimental and would not cover it.

Personally, it was because I already have GI problems and my doctor suggested against it.  Compared to inversion, the potential complications are ghastly.

If I remember correctly there’s some diet stuff that you have to adjust to because of it, it involves other internal organs, it’s a longer recovery time, has more risk, etc. So I guess that’s why. If I get srs I will not get colon vaginoplasty although I do think it has some great results. I just think it seems a bit much considering I can have a penile inversjon instead. If I remember correctly you need about 12 cm stretched penile tissue to be able to have the surgery. So colon vaginoplasty is usually the go-to procedure if the patient doesn’t have sufficient penile tissue. That is not to say that I can’t understand why some people who do have enough tissue get the colon procedure

Well I&#39;ve heard that using a part of the colon caused a bad odor.  I  myself would use whatever was needed to make it work the best.

I would have gone that route as well, more depth and extra tissue for esthetics.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m large, so I had slim pickings. Luckily, I could at least get the surgery through Ramineni, who is a true ally!
</p>
<p>
If I can&#39;t manage to gain depth through dilation I&#39;m gonna look into a depth revision and like hope I can make a case for myself even though I&#39;m of high BMI (serious to goodness I&#39;m healthy as hell). If I can&#39;t, then I will certainly be grateful I was at least able to get PIV initially.

There are serious side effects that many doctors (In the USA at least) traditionally hid or didn&#39;t know about (because the study data was fudged.) For example, the tissue is prone to infection and there&#39;s a real risk of continued mucus and blood discharge, especially after beginning penetrative sexual activity. These side effects can be long lasting and debilitating, and they don&#39;t tell you that.

I think it&#39;s because they&#39;re told B.S. , there is a lot of misinformation out there.  I&#39;m scheduled to get the Intestinal Vaginoplasty next Thursday at Cedars-Sinai in Beverly Hills, with an amazing surgeon who is also the head of the Transgender Clinic at Cedars-Sinai. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned from him.. I asked him about many of the things I&#39;d heard of about the Sigmoid Vaginoplasty/Intestinal Vaginoplasty, whatever name you know it by. The smell,  I&#39;ve heard about this one for as long as I&#39;ve been alive, and I&#39;m 60, lol.. Well, there can be an odor for 6 months or less, that&#39;s it. Then everything adjusts. He said some of his patients never have any smell at all. The lubrication,  yes, that one&#39;s true too but like before, again, not like we&#39;ve heard. It&#39;s also it more 6 months or less, then it adjusts, you have to wear a panty liner big deal, so do millions of cis women.
<br>
You also have to douchè a lot in the beginning to stay clean from lube and all, but who doesn&#39;t want to stay clean. Depth 8 inches plus. Goodbye to 3-5 inches from the Vaginoplasty. Can&#39;t think of any others. I&#39;m sure there are more, lol I&#39;m very much looking forward to it, I&#39;ve had the regular one for a few years, and it hurts to dilate, and it&#39;s shallow. Wish I would have gotten it in the beginning..  I wish everyone much luck and happiness with whatever they choose.  Hugs Daph
