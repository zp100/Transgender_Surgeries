i guess im lucky in this regard, i dont have alot of odor, it can occur if i had a physicaly exhausting day but I don&#39;t feel that the odor is stronger than by a natal vagina.

I read so many bad things about him. I was thinking of doing my BA with him, but the experiences scare me. Yours on the other hand sounds good!

</p>
<p>
One were he did a BA with the SRS, but she only wanted the SRS, where he then got fired from the hospital (zurich, switzerland)
</p>

i heard that story too but ive spoken to his assistant about this. apparently, the patient changed their mind the evening before surgery and the surgery was scheduled in the morning she wrote an email but fakin and his team didn&#39;t receive the mail. So they did as they had have scheduled it. Idk what is true and I don&#39;t want take sides here. Anyway I also have a friend she did sea before me with him and is also very happy.

I was actually thinking of kind of a similar scenario. I couldnt fathom how else it could have happened. That needed to be an administrative error or the patients fault.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for telling me their side!
</p>
<p>

</p>
