Honestly? Screw him, you posted your real surgery experience for others to learn from and his concern seems to be more with his reputation than his patient being taken care of! I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had to go through this.. :/ that&#39;s not how a medical professional should be acting, you did nothing wrong and you deserved better, no one is perfect of course but messaging that to a patient after they give their honest experience is just unprofessional

My surgeon has said specifically she does not look at what her patients post since she wants them to feel like they can discuss freely. I&#39;m surprised yours felt differently!

What’s funny too is I don’t know any successful surgeon with a waitlist who’s on here trolling and stalking their patients. If they’re really as good as they say they are they’d be too busy to be up here on Reddit sifting through reviews about themselves.

I disagree - surgeons absolutely should read reviews of themselves! That&#39;s how they can learn to better improve the care that they deliver.

Maybe but that doesn’t excuse the passive aggressive and unprofessional response. Let’s not distract from the real issue at hand

Monitoring Internet reputation as a plastic surgeon is just part of doing business. They may hire internal staff to do it, an attorney or a reputable service to do it.  Regardless, no surgeon with an Internet presence is ignoring online content impacting their reputation. The Physician may spend zero time on the issue unless something is red-flagged for their attention.

And is this how a reputable, professional surgeon should respond to a patient who had a negative experience? Me thinks no lmao. It’s not constructive, it’s cowardly and it stinks of someone who is not secure with the work they do. An acceptable approach would have been to address it directly or to move on. The grade school passive aggressive behavior just says what type of person he is. If that’s not the takeaway from this idk what is

I think you are under the impression that I condone this behaviour or that I&#39;m making excuses for anyone who feels threatened by his communication. This is not the point I am making at all. I&#39;m not disagreeing with that that we as patients shouldn&#39;t be faced with passive aggressive threats or treated poorly regardless of their circumstances or provider.
</p>
<p>
What I&#39;ve offered are some explanations as to why these situations often unfold and why.

It might be useful to post what happened to you, and what your negative experience was with this guy.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea why you see the doc&#39;s response to be passive aggressive and why it constitutes stalking. It looks like a lot of posts I get from my docs and nurses all the time--pretty neutral--unless there&#39;s a back story.
</p>
<p>
Which I don t have here.
</p>
<p>
I am absolutely sensitive to any issues you had with your vaginoplasty, as I am recovering from mine, and other than the surgery itself and the recovery process, mine was not positive either.
</p>
<p>
So please: some background....

I&#39;m so sad for you. I paid nothing for my GAS through Kaiser in SSF and got wonderful, affirming care. Talk about a bunch of jerks who apparently don&#39;t have any empathetic bones in their lizard bodies.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so sorry and sad. Now I get why you have no patience for this MF.

Get better. be safe. Many blessings!!!!

There’s also a lot of doctors and surgeons on reddit for the same reason as everyone else. While important to us, it’s just a job and they are people to. The medicine sub alone has 400k members.

I imagine their marketing/patient support staff let them know about the post. You&#39;re probably right that it&#39;s unlikely they were looking themselves.

I think this might be a generational communication problem thing. I honestly don&#39;t get the problem. He said thank you. Unless the review was negative, isn&#39;t that appropriate?

I just read your other posts. This sounds like a literal nightmare, and I’m so sorry you went through all that. Speaking as someone who’s trying to work as a liaison between my fellow trans people and our doctors, they should have been so much better to you.

Thank you. I do feel affirmed by listening to other people’s experiences on this and now knowing that the complications I was having were not my fault. I hope that more people speak out about poor treatment from their providers and require them to be held to a higher standard.

I’ve had doctors either yell or laugh at me for fainting during blood draws, which I’m supposed to get regularly now. Doctors can sometimes be C-students.

In my experience, constipation is more common than urinary retention, so this surprises me. BTW, NAC is a good idea during opiod use (protects the liver) and is very inexpensive.

It’s not worth it to go after them for that to me at least. But I will use my free speech to share my experience so other people hopefully will speak up if they feel they’re being mistreated. I didn’t feel empowered enough to speak out about it, but I’m glad I am now. Who knows maybe they’ll better themselves too

Just checked your post history and I want to say I am so sorry. I know what it&#39;s like to deal with unsympathetic surgeons who will fuck around with your health, although I haven&#39;t experienced anything as bad as you have experienced. I really hope that revisions can offer you some relief, and I hope you have a good support system around you who can help you through things emotionally.
</p>
<p>
Also,
<em>
please
</em>
do not blame yourself. You have done absolutely nothing wrong. I know what it&#39;s like to blame yourself for surgeons treating you like shit but it is not your fault in the slightest. You have been a good patient and followed doctors&#39; advice, and they have fucked you over. Honestly things are hardly ever patients&#39; fault; doctors have responsibility for their patients&#39; wellbeing, and even if the patient &#34;does something wrong&#34;, doctors should know that patients are only human and can make mistakes (not that you&#39;ve made any!). Just try and remember that. I wish I could do more to help you but I hope at least you know that reddit strangers want you to be well.

I don’t even want to go through the trouble of doing, I just want people to know my experience so they know what decision is best for them. I think it’s important for us to know what these providers are like both pre and post surgery.

LOL oh yes the typical passive aggressive intimidation tactic used by a “entitled” doctor who doesn’t take responsibility for his mistakes. Wow I’m just so surprised (not)
</p>
<p>
Like I seen someone on here say, “if he was such a good doctor and had a waitlist the size he says he does, 1. He wouldn’t be on here just browsing through hoping to read stuff on himself or maybe he does so bad that he already assumes that people are talking about them sharing their bad experience.
</p>
<p>
If he was such a good surgeon he wouldn’t be pressed by what you posted because his results and positive reviews outnumber the bad/speak for themselves. I’m sorry you you went thru that. Stay up, wishing you the best💕

I&#39;m thankful for this subreddit because I almost went through Rumer until I heard some of the horror stories. My surgeon is less known, because there&#39;s no internet fame, but part of a really good program and the few reviews I can find are solid.

This whole experience you’ve had blows my mind. And I was so close to going to them. That Reddit statement is just over the top after everything else. I would expect the gay and trans surgeons to be more compassionate and understanding, but they’re not. It makes me sad and angry that as humans this is the best we’re willing to offer one another anymore. From a gay or trans surgeon especially, we should only be hearing stories like “I was so well cared for”, “I felt safe and loved the whole time”, or “even when things did not go as planned, they made sure I was informed. I felt heard and cared about”. It is not hard to do. The surgeons whose egos prevent them from creating these experiences need to be avoided at all cost. Thank you again for sharing your story with everyone.

I read through your posts and the entire experience just sounds awful. SRS is terrifying enough to commit to on its own and your posts characterize alot of weaponized shame and guilt just for trying to live your life. This is one of the things that has scared me off from even trying to contact their offices again.
</p>
<p>
I had a much less intensive surgery- an orchiectomy/scrotectomy with them not too long ago. I&#39;m having some post-surgical complications that haven&#39;t been healing to expectation, namely still having a gaping hole after over a month and the left side of my penis having a large lump. They were truly wonderful and caring while I was there, but the line of communication prior to surgery was awful, which I didn&#39;t feel would bode well for post-surgical communication. Seems I was correct. The trip to Miami itself was horrible enough that I wouldn&#39;t consider going back for a revision even if it was an option and as a result I&#39;ve had been looking for a local urologist that can take a look at it. I was considering contacting their offices for a referral, but now I think I might just go through my primary physician for one.

I’m so sorry you’re having to go through that. Honestly in my experience once I was home, the communication kind of trailed off. I think they’d benefit from a care team where we could be in contact with a nurse or other doc for questions and to guide us through healing. Who knows maybe they’ll do that in the future, but the care they offer now was mediocre in my experience. I hope you can get everything resolved with a new doc and wish you the best in your healing journey beautiful 💖

In case everyone needs a reminder. Surgeons, nurses and other providers read this sub. You should assume they will read, comments, images and posts that you author related to them --good or bad. There is nothing new about this, it&#39;s the same as it has always been. You are free to speak your mind and voice your opinion about your experience within the rules of the Sub.

Which is what was done. Let’s not distract from the real issue which is this surgeon’s lack of professionalism. All surgeons that have the ability to read reviews about themselves have the chance to rectify a bad experience. But instead this surgeon didn’t do that.

This is correct. Nevertheless, It&#39;s unusual for providers to offer much in capitualation despite their desire. It&#39;s a matter of risk management. This is why they are more likely to stop talking to youl the moment disappointment or complaints start to escalate or move to an online public forum.
