Hi Everyone, I’m wondering if anyone who has done or researched BA has any insight into the relationship between rice test sizing and actual results. I’ve seen some suggestion that the results tend to appear slightly smaller / less “busty” for lack of a better word, than the rice test. Does anyone have any experience with this?
</p>
<p>
I’m currently deciding between two sizes, both fairly close (280cc and 300cc low profile plus silicone) and if they’re going to appear slightly smaller want to go with the 300 I think. The online conversion lists put the quantity of rice that give me results I like at the 280 equivalent, however when I actually measure the inserts I’m using the size actually matches the given dims of the 300cc implant model id be getting.
</p>
<p>
It kinda seems like the rice test calculators are more aimed to model medium profile implants as those seem more common. The difference between the two sizes I’m looking at is mostly in width, and my main concern is erring too small, so I’m leaning 300cc right now. Anyone have any thoughts?
</p>

Make sure you get the base width right when you try it on. I wrote about this
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/i3g2q0/should_i_search_for_a_surgeon_with_experience/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
. Also what&#39;s your bra band measurement? Unless it&#39;s very small you aren&#39;t going to get a very big change with 300cc. When you actually get the implant it&#39;s going to be shaped by the tissue around it, so if your surgeon is any good your results will be like the rice test but in a more natural distribution.

I’ll give this a read. My band measurement is 34.5 inches (36 in bra size I guess, I just wear s/m/l style bralettes mostly.) The measurements I took with the rice test in put me at a 36C (right now I’m a 36 barely A).
</p>
<p>
The measurements I took of the rice testers had them at about 12.75 cm x 3.3-3.4cm, which is a low profile plus 300cc on the manufacturers specs, but 1.2ish cups of rice which most calculators put at a 280cc, so I’m getting a bit confused. The doctor ordered both I believe so I’ll probably just see if I can bring the testers in and have them see what’ll be closer to the look I like.

If it helps, my underbust is 35.5, and I was an A cup before my augmentation. I have 405 cc high profile implants, and am now a 36E/F according to abrathatfits at one month post.

That is helpful actually, I feel like there’s an annoyingly sparse amount of actual body measurements around regarding BA, especially for trans women. Thanks!

300cc is definitely going to result in a noticeable change mod someone&#39;s frame and is iirc among the most common size used in breast augmentation generally. Speaking from one consult I had with sizers 300 was certainly a noticeable increase and I had kind of landed on 350cc if I had decided at that time to pursue implants ,(for context I am 6&#39; 1&#34; with 17&#34; shoulders to give some dimensionality )

I said very large and you said noticeable. IMO if you have an underbust measurement of 34.5 inches like op 300cc is going to look more like a touch-up than a complete change. Noticeable? Yes. Worthwhile? Possibly. But very large change? No.

That&#39;s also going to depend on the amount of breast tissue currently there.

You should discuss sizes with your surgeon who should take measurements and use that to determine size. I have a narrow chest and I just had 300cc high profile smooth silicone gel implants placed yesterday. I&#39;m still wrapped up, but from what I can tell, it&#39;s a big improvement from the flat chest I had even after almost 3 years HRT.  I just wanted enough to look proportional to my body and create a nice silhouette.

The sizes I’m trying were what my surgeon recommended I try. I originally had asked about going a little smaller then reconsidered. The size / profile recs were based on my goals combined with the measurements he took, and said I should try out the equivalent rice sized to see how I feel about them. The actual size of the two implants is only 2.5mm difference it seems but the feeling of fullness in the rice test feels like a noticeable jump, but I feel like the actual implant will sit differently than rice.
</p>
<p>
Do you mind sharing your band size?

Thanks for your input

I see. From what my surgeon told me, the difference between 25ccs is only a couple tablespoons. We had discussed 325cc moderate plus profile, but they&#39;d be a little wide for my chest. Definitely the implant will look different than rice of even holding implants externally to your chest wall, especially if you get them under the muscle. Trying on different implant sizes under a sports bra, I could barely tell the difference from 300 to 350, but 380 looked too big and 250 too small. I doubt you&#39;ll be able to tell much difference between 20ccs once they&#39;re in. My band size is about 33.5-34&#34;. Not sure of my cup size yet as I&#39;m still wrapped up in an ace bandage for 5 more days, but it is a substantial improvement and I think will push me to at least a B if not a C cup. I never actually tried the rice test, but hope that&#39;s helpful.

Thanks, that actually helps a lot. We’re pretty close in band size.

I&#39;m curious to know this too... I&#39;ve just started playing around with the &#39;rice testers.&#39;  In the surgeon&#39;s office during my consult, I thought that 275cc looked about perfect for the results that I wanted when I was trying on the little silicone thingies, but with the rice it didn&#39;t look the same and I liked 300cc better.
</p>
<p>
My tight under bust measurement is 33in and I&#39;m like a 32B.5 or 34A.5 -ish... I don&#39;t want a drastic size increase, just need to fill out more so I can wear clothes without a bra and not look super flat. I feel like I look fine with a push-up bra, but without it I think my boobs look disproportionately small for my body size.
</p>
<p>
At my surgeon&#39;s request I&#39;ve started sending her pics of the type of results that I&#39;m looking for. My main concerns are that they don&#39;t end up looking widely spaced out and that they fit my frame well. I may end up going up to 325cc or 350cc based on what my surgeon&#39;s advice is but I think thats about my hard limit. I REALLY don&#39;t want super big boobs.

Not sure if I’ve said this before, but look into fat transfer. It sounds good for you.

I&#39;ve looked into it. It seems more involved (as well as more expensive) and I don&#39;t know if I have enough fat to transfer in my midsection (which is the best donation area) to make it worth it. The surgeon that I consulted with said that she could likely do a transfer in addition to a silicone implant to help things look more natural, but I probably didn&#39;t have enough for my desired outcome without taking from my butt too, which I don&#39;t want to do. You generally have to take more than what you think will be needed because there&#39;s usually a good amount of die-off, or whatever you call it, and not all the fat cells survive the transfer. Often, you have to do it more than once for a good outcome. Honestly, I think I&#39;d rather just do silicone and be finished.

Have a look at Dr Bednar, and especially in his Facebook patient group. He seems to be one of the best around and gets some amazing results. It will show you what&#39;s possible, even when you don&#39;t have much fat.

I think he&#39;s around US$11k.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s another Facebook Fat transfer group with other surgeons if you&#39;re interested after that.
</p>
<p>
It appears to be very skill dependant surgery and very few are good at it. Unfortunately for me none of them are in Australia.

His results look great. I&#39;d probably do it if I had more financial resources but he&#39;s also in MD, which is the complete opposite side of the US from me. $11k is also more that I&#39;m really comfortable with spending. That&#39;s almost $4k more expensive than the excellent, and pretty expensive, surgeon that I settled on out here in CA.

He’s just an example. There may be others more suitable.
</p>
<p>
The total lifetime cost of implants is likely higher if that matters. They will need replacing at some point, possibly multiple times.

That&#39;s a problem for future me to solve. Who knows where I&#39;ll be then? Maybe dead? :-P I&#39;m 34. If they last til I&#39;m 50, great! I&#39;ll get a replacement then, after that.... I probably won&#39;t care so much anyway when I&#39;m older.
