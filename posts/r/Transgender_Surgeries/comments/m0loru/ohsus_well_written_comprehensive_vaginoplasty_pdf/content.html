Great plan. Has anyone actually sought care from OHSU?  I‚Äôd be fascinated to hear positive experiences. I will be sure to share my own when  (if?) I actually meet one of the surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I have found it extraordinarily difficult to schedule even the most basic appointments with OHSU. It took me 9 months to get an appointment for hair removal. üôÑ
</p>
<p>
I am sincerely interested in how many surgeries they actually perform.

I received my orchi there and it was very smooth and easy. Great team. It took me about 3 months from start to finish.

Getting my appointment for consult. I need to revise and say it was longer, idk an estimate because I had messed up some paperwork. I imagine it could be done in 3-4 months if you had all your ducks in s row.

I have both therapist letters and have had consults with three other practices. I believe my ducks are in a row. :) If they need anything else, OHSU has yet to tell me.
</p>
<p>
My *consult* just to discuss options is scheduled for 9/14 - 6 months from now.  However, they had all the information required to schedule in November.

It was originally to discuss choices, including orchi, zero-depth, vaginoplasty. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Ah ok, what&#39;s the surgeons name? Is it doogi? If you&#39;re just doing the orchi, I think it is far faster.

Dugi, yes. And it was to discuss more than orchi, so you‚Äôre probably right. It‚Äôs still an excessive delay, IMHO...

There are that many people in line ahead of you. Though I do think schedulers and office personnel could do a better job of things. Ime they&#39;re all way too understaffed.
