I am currently 8 months post-op from colon SRS. Aside from my horrific post-op complications, I am extremely unsatisfied with the aesthetics. My vagina also isn’t anatomically correct and I cannot orgasm… I’m looking to have a revision done and would like some recommendations. I’ve contacted Dr. Littleton; he is my number 1 choice but I don’t think I’ll be able to afford him. I live in Montreal, Canada and the only option in my home town is GRS Montreal and I don’t like their work. Any other options (no USA)?

I would recommend looking into Thailand. There’s a handful of great surgeons and the prices for surgery and air bnb/housing is fairly cheap compared to a US surgeon. I had my primary in Thailand and have been very happy.

I went to the same surgeon as you and had no complications. Still waiting for everything to settle before I have a full appreciation of what I have but I’m not unhappy with it. Labia could maybe doing with a bit slimmer, but I’m sure it’s something I could get used to and there are girls out there who might appreciate that - or not care.

Having another woman see them for the first time will be nerve racking I expect.

Was almost 2 years before achieving an orgasm. It can take time.
