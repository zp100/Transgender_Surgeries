Hello again! It’s been a little while and thought it was time for an update as quite a bit has changed😬 some of it good, some great, some not good.
</p>
<p>
To start with the bad - thankfully it’s mostly nothing serious.
</p>
<p>
First, had a bit of dilation trouble with an unexpectedly big bleed a week ago. I was using my smallest dilator for the first 5 minutes, look down, and see my puppy pad soaked with dark red blood. Cleaned up, contacted Dr Hart and he got back by that afternoon and said it was likely traumatisation of some granulation that caused the blood. He’s not currently concerned, advised to keep an eye out that it doesn’t bleed continuously or happen often, and so far apart from a smaller version the next day it hasn’t.
</p>
<p>
Further to the granulation, there’s some that’s mildly painful beside my clit. Dr Hart says the both the granulation in the canal and by the clit should heal themselves over the next 4 weeks, if not by then we will pursue treatments (steroid cream, silver nitrate, etc)
</p>
<p>
Very common issue, most surgeons say almost all bottom surgeries result in some granulation, this is very much on the low end by all estimations but worth noting as if anyone experienced it it could be shoving and frightening.
</p>
<p>
Second, the wound separation down the bottom persists, nothing that needs attention right now but still worth keeping an eye on.
</p>
<p>
The bigger issue is it looks like I’ll be needing a revision in a couple months. This is for my urethra, as I’m urinating more forward and sprayed out than I should, Dr Hart suspects it’s just a little tissue that healed wrong and is either pressing on or blocking the exit of the urethra slightly. A fairly common and minor complication that requires a minor surgery to adjust the angle of the urethra and remove the over healed tissue. Either day surgery or one night stay I think.
</p>
<p>
He says he won’t do it till past the 3 month mark, so just keeping an eye on it till then. There is a small chance he says it could still be some swelling and fix itself but to get back in touch in a month to arrange a revision if it doesn’t, which he suspects will be the case.
</p>
<p>
Slightly annoying but 10-20% of cases need some sort of revision, it’s very much on the minor end.
</p>
<p>
The good;
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I’m allowed to shave the area (carefully)
</li>
<li>
I can swim
</li>
<li>
I can move down to 2x dilation a day
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Healing on the whole has been good. I’m dilating with minimal pain mostly with some moderate spikes every few days. I’m out and about seeing friends, I’m having fun again🥰
</p>
<p>
Still got a ways to go but all in all I’m on a good track.
</p>
<p>
Now for the great stuff💖  - I can start trying sexy times when I feel comfortable!
</p>
<p>
My girlfriends are all excited to start and my god so am I! Probably will give it another week or 2 before I start trying but I’m ready to go real soon and have the clear.
</p>
<p>
Now the biggest one for me…
</p>
<p>
I HAD MY FIRST ORGASM! And omg it’s good, really good! Took like 2 hours but it’s exactly the toe curling, mind bending, body shaking, experience people described hahaha
</p>
<p>
Won’t be too graphic but I’m just very glad it happened and it can happen because I was worried I would somehow be unlucky and lose that ability.
</p>
<p>
Well I’ve rambled enough, any questions as usual please feel free to ask in the comments or DM me if you wanna keep it private ✨

Thank you for your share. Nice to hear about your honest results. I worried about having an orgasm. I’ve always been attracted to women, but after 12 months HRT, and becoming much more feminine, I think about being with a man. I know this is very personal, and you clearly don’t have to answer, but just courious Sarah  ❤️
