my girlfriend had her orchiectomy with dr. douglass (we both loved her) and she is on the fence about vaginoplasty (not sure if she is committed to dilation).

I am 3 months past vulvoplasty with Drs Douglass and Hamidian and am very happy with my experience and results. The labia looks very natural, the scars are minimal, and I can achieve orgasm when i get in the right head space.

I&#39;m happy to talk about my dilation experience in more detail, but in short it&#39;s been super manageable and minimally uncomfortable.

it is the fact that she has to do it every day. she is not committed to that. my best friend and &#34;other&#34; girlfriend dilate every night. she is also sensory and worries about the smell.
</p>
<p>
I have had a lot of posty pussy and there are post-ops in our circle of friends, so we both know what is involved. my gf does not have that commitment.
