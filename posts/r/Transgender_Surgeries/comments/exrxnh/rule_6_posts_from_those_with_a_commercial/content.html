<p>
There&#39;s been the occasional post in this by people who have a commercial interest in the decisions of this subs members. This sub operates in the interests of the members, and it’s not fair to be subject to marketing that unduly influence our decisions. On the other hand, it is helpful to be better informed about surgery and our choices, and who better than surgeons and their representatives, medical travel operators, etc.
</p>
<p>
I prefer to moderate as transparently as possible, so I&#39;m adding a new rule covering the matter. Hopefully we can strike the right balance that encourages input from these professionals without crossing the line.
</p>
<p>
This includes surgeons, surgeons representatives, people who work in medical tourism, etc. It’s not intended to cover those of us who are trans and happen to work in medicine, but don&#39;t have any commercial interest. There&#39;s a few that are not entirely clear, but I&#39;d like to leave that to a case by case basis.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen Facebook groups where a member asks for advice and a surgeons representative always pops and says something like I recommend Dr ..., he&#39;s the best. Let’s not do that.
</p>
<p>
The rule as it stands at the moment is
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Moderators assign user flair to disclose that the user either has or could be perceived to have a commercial interest. Flair is the text next to your username when you post -
<del>
you can see mine on this post saying &#34;
<a href="/r/TransSurgeriesWiki">/r/TransSurgeriesWiki</a>
&#34; with a light-blue background
</del>
. The flair might simply be the name of a surgeon, or the business name. For some it might disclose the kind of work they do without identifying them, eg &#34;Works in Medical Tourism&#34;. This can be discussed on a case by case basis. Using flair means that the posters don&#39;t have to worry about remembering to disclose every time (and a chance to advertise a bit). Note that members cannot currently add their on flair on this sub.
</li>
<li>
The affected users must not make posts without moderator approval. Replies to posts and comments are fine.
</li>
<li>
Posts and comments should be informative and useful, and related to questions members have asked, not simply calls to contact a surgeon, send a PM for further information, or links to the poster’s website. Nor a high volume of comments - let’s start off gently and see how it goes (given there&#39;s very few of these comments here at moment it shouldn&#39;t be a problem). As per Rule 5, make it of clear benefit to the community here.
</li>
<li>
People who are or may be covered by this rule can contact me or the other mods to get user flair assigned. If I see anyone posting who hasn’t done this I’ll initiate contact with them.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
While somewhat limiting I&#39;d hope this allows these professionals to find it worth the time to be here and at the same time allows members to judge for themselves what is being said.
</p>
<p>
Any feedback is welcome, especially from those professionals who may have an interest in posting here.

</p>
<p>
These are the accounts with user flair to identify them. They have not in general been verified as being owned by the people they say they are. I would strongly suggest that when it comes to privacy or money you
<em>
always
</em>
go through their official websites and communication channels -
<em>
do not trust
</em>
what anything they have told you on reddit. Even if/when these accounts are in some way verified there&#39;s always the possibility they have been hacked (or mine has).

Seems good, but I&#39;d also add to the rule that people who don&#39;t add a flair after being contacted by the mods will be banned.

Worst case yes, but I can&#39;t imagine it will come to that. However the way the sub is configured at the moment only mods can add flairs and I&#39;d like to reach a mutual agreement on what the flair will say.

This seems a possible double edged sword. On one side, I can see the advantage of receiving straight information from the professional and with the flair, clearly understand where the information is coming from. But, on the other side what protects members from being taken advantage of by those who would be sly, devious, cunning and bear watching at all times?

I don’t understand. What protects people now? At least you’ll know who’s posting, and it’s not like people on reddit are shy on calling out bs.
</p>
<p>
We can always adjust the rules as necessary if it’s not working out.

My apology. I was not and did not intend to come across as critical. This Rule is a good thing and I see it helping our community. In my day job, I&#39;m always on alert for those who choose to flaunt the rules and take advantage of the unsuspecting. It is a concern I sometimes find hard to put down.

Hi! I just saw your message concerning this new rule, and I think that&#39;s a very good idea. Because medical professionals and people representing them, have an incredible amount of useful information for the community. But transparency is key. Let us show &#39;our faces&#39; as people connected to these surgeons/clinics/...

Yes that sounds like a great idea - I totally approve that.
</p>
<p>
Although the commercial interest I have is coaching people before surgery so that they go into surgery with as little life issues as possible - which from my point of view and experience reduces the possible complications - or should they happen - the way a person deals with it.
</p>
<p>
Since I never recommend only one surgeon there will always be a choice for the person looking for an appropriate surgeon to solve their issue/s. That&#39;s why I always have a list of surgeons I recommend -  but there will always be new surgeons coming up - so this list is an evolving one adapting to the experiences I make and the info I can collect speaking to surgeons and evaluating their work from my point of view.
