This little series of mine is going to be highlighting my experiences choosing Dr. Ramineni as my surgeon. My goal is to provide as much info as possible so that people can make an informed decision towards whether they would or wouldn&#39;t want him to be their surgeon. Especially since he does roughly 135 vaginoplasties a year, but not many people highlight their journeys from going with him. This part will be focusing on my first 2 full days of being home, dealing with hip pain, attempting to poop, managing discomforts caused by catheter and packing! This will be a bit longer of a post since I&#39;m squishing both days into one since overall I had to deal with the same stuff each day.

</p>
<p>
Saturday: My pain levels were a lot harder to manage on my first full day of being home. My BFF and mom were doing so much to take care of me throughout the day. Eventually my legs started to get really stiff from lying flat on my back (I even had dreams where I was stretching my legs in them it was that bad üòÇ). So I started to do short walks around my place every time my catheter bag was emptied. This still wasn&#39;t enough so I attempted to do some other things throughout the day that I&#39;ll get too.
</p>
<p>
About midday I attempted something I never really hear people bring up about recovery idk if it&#39;s because it&#39;s TMI or unladylike. But I never hear people talk about their trouble pooping, positions, or techniques around pooping during recovery. It&#39;s obviously a big part of what our abdomen and pelvic floor muscles have to relearn how to do yet I don&#39;t ever hear much about it. My pelvic floor PT recommended elevated knees to help get a better position. So I had my BFF help get me seated on the toilet and then help raise my legs up onto little feet boosters my mom bought for me (my leg stiffness really made movement like this difficult). I then started breathing through my diaphragm and blowing out as my way to &#34;push without pushing&#34;. I wasn&#39;t too successful my first try but I did get a lil bit out which I thought was good enough! (Side note blood leaks down your cheaks and into the toilet in such an uncomfortable way üòñ)
</p>
<p>
Like I said as the day went on my stiff legs (especially my hips) got so much worse. Sitting in my computer chair with 2 donut pillows and my little feet boosters was nice at trying to bend my hips up more. But I was progressively experiencing more and more pain from my hip joints. When it came time for bed I just couldn&#39;t be comfortable lying flat on my back without soooo much pain from my hips. My mom (who has had hip pain in the past) chimed in to use like 6 different pillows to make me stable enough to lay on my side with my legs separated by 2 pillows. This was finally the position that brought me relief! üòÆ‚Äçüí®
</p>
<p>
I absolutely didn&#39;t think I could make it to my packing and catheter removal without this trick. I was just writhing in pain laying flat on my back. I was finally able to fall asleep with only small interruptions to my empty catheter bag and take meds. Otherwise it was finally some more comfortable sleep.
</p>
<p>
Sunday: Everything about this day made it a pretty challenging day. I had to deal with hip pain still, POOOPING (ü•≥), having my catheter bag swapped, and an unforseen cause of uncontrollable pain!
</p>
<p>
I woke up pretty early with more hip pain even with laying on my side. Throughout the night the pain would migrate to the hip that was holding all my weight. We attempted switching which leg my catheter bag was on so that I could try laying on my other side. Unfortunately the angle wasn&#39;t right and my pee wouldn&#39;t drain in that position for whatever reason. So I had to consistently switch between short walks around my space, sitting up in chair or bed, and laying on my right side.
</p>
<p>
I was making it through the day by reminding myself that I was x hours away from my follow-up appointment and that soon all my main sources of discomfort will be over. Late afternoon came around and I finally attempted pooping again! It took a long time of consistently doing breathing techniques (cus you aren&#39;t allowed to push). Then once I started pooping I just focused on my breathing and holding onto that &#34;I&#39;m pooping feeling&#34;. TMI but surprisingly I was finally able to get so much out of me! This helped alleviate so much pressure off my bladder and pelvic floor muscles. üòÆ‚Äçüí®
</p>
<p>
Around this time my old catheter bag just gave up at draining my pee properly and I felt the most uncomfortable pressure/tingling. I had my mom go run out and get cranberry pills to avoid a UTI and my BFF helped swap my bags out. Idk why this happened or was necessary, but after cranberry pills and new bag my urethra stopped tingling.
</p>
<p>
Then came the uncontrollable pain... I&#39;m naturally a giggly girl and I&#39;ve discovered if I get into a giggle fit I can&#39;t stop my muscles from clenching down on my packing. Which for obvious reasons hurts like a fucking bitch! It was like 10 min straight of giggling while sobbing because the pain was so bad. My BFF finally calmed me down. I took my night pain meds + cranberry pills and got into my side sleeping position. But ever since the giggles my gal is a lot more sore and painful even like 6hrs after the event. üò≠
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be stopping here for today because at the time of writing this I&#39;m only a few hours away from my follow-up appointment! I&#39;m so excited to have these sources of pain and discomfort to be removed from my body. And I&#39;m a lil excited to start the dilation process. Ik it&#39;ll eventually become a major chore and a drag, but I have some pretty ambitious depth and girth goals so I&#39;m excited to get to work on them! I&#39;ll talk to you cuties tomorrow night and update you on how my appointment goes! Wish me luck! üíñüíóüíûü•≥üéâüéä
