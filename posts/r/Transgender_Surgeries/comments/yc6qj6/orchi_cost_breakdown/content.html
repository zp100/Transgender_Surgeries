Total out of pocket for surgery $2339.63
</p>
<p>
The surgeon bill was initially denied for gender mismatch with procedure, they sent a letter saying they need more info. I called the insurance company and the rep noted the gender discrepancy and had it sent back to the dept that does the approvals (I forgot the name) and it all was approved shortly after.
</p>
<p>
The Anesthesia was initially denied for gender mismatch for procedure, letter saying they need more info. I called insurance just like with surgeon bill, This time they denied it again. Then I put in a request online for it to be reviewed That I am AMAB, it was denied. Then Anesthesia submitted a new claim which they denied. Then I put in a request online for the claim to be reviewed, noting the gender discrepancy just like I did on the phone, and online before. And it was approved.
</p>
<p>
Hospital Bill, They approved everything except the OR. Same Story, received a letter, gender mismatch, they need more info, please call.
<br>
So I called, I verified myself and the Claim info with the rep, Informed her that the mismatch is because I am an AMAB Trans Woman, and I did in fact have testicles to remove, its not a fraudulent charge, and to please correct the claim, or note this and send it back to whoever does the approvals. This woman said that I needed to have all my documents changed to male and have my employer code me as male. That its impossible to bill this procedure for a female(note surgeon and anesthesia is already approved and paid). She sounded like a bitch, I hung up on her.
<br>
Then she called me, she said &#34;did you just hang up on me?&#34;, and I said &#34;yep, go fuck yourself&#34;, and I hung up again. Then I did the online contact thing to provide info on the gender mismatch for that claim and request it be run again.
<br>
That was denied.
<br>
The hospital submitted a new claim, it was denied, same letter, gender mismatch, need more info.
<br>
I didn&#39;t bother calling this time, just did the online form.
<br>
It was denied.
<br>
I then submitted a formal appeal, This was denied, This time not for &#34;gender mismatch&#34; but instead because they don&#39;t have the requisite psych letters and medical records on file as required by the transgender surgery policy. They actually sent me a copy of this policy document with the denial. The denial also stated if I can produce the required records dated prior to surgery, then they&#39;ll approve it.
<br>
I cant produce the records, I never saw a mental health professional.
<br>
Then the hospital just deleted the OR portion of the bill, so, k.
