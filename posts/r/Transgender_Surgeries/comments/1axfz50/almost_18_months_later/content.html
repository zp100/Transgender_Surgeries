I had bottom surgery with the Suporn Clinic almost 18 months ago and wow what an experience. Please note this is all for my own experience and I can&#39;t speak for anyone else. Surgery went brilliantly and honestly recovery was a wash of ups and downs. Dilation was honestly awful for me for the first 6 months I hated the routine and the pain and everything. Sex was intresting and honestly since there no manual it&#39;s just been wild figuring out everything. I get wet and it all works honestly still freaking suprised. Post op and during my recovery I am 6.5inch internally but let me tell you she alot more forgiving then I realised and size has never been an issue no matter what way you size up. Everyday am still learning but mostly as it stand am only dilatingaybe every 2 weeks and I am having 0 issues. I feel I might go for revision in a few years depending on my financial situation and stuff but honestly there almost nothing I&#39;d change other then a urethral shorting but we shall see what Dr Bank says. As for hygiene douching was easy and simple but I rarely do it now I keep clean of course and I clean myself. I should say by regularly douching I don&#39;t routinely do it as much as I did during recovery and I find in terms of smell and everything she always on point. My pee did seem to smell different after surgery but that honestly could just be my mind playing tricks on me. Am I glad I healed yes would I go through that again properly but honestly it was a rough road. Hard to think i did it. Yes my body changed i lost weight put on weight, put on more weight, lost some again ppstly all through work and life style but yer its been wild. If you got any questions just ask.

Going to Banks is my dream!  Everyone who went says how awful dilating by their schedule is, kinda makes me scared. But you saying it was all worth it, makes me hopeful.
</p>
<p>
Tell me how was their pain managment right after the surgery, did you feel well taken cared of? And please tell me how was the trip home? That part also scares me.

Is you getting wet esp. a response to sexual stimuli or is it more a regular discharge? Would you know what tissue was used for this to happen? Thank you :)

Of course while there is some natural discharge that happens time to time. I also get wet when aroused and sexuallky stimulated it varies on my mood and arousal like anyone else tbh as for what was used I am unsure off the top off my head I&#39;d have to look at my booklet but I had the suporn method

Thank you so much for answering! Do you happen to know the differences between the Suporn method and other methods?

What do you mean by urethral shortening? How do you know its shortened? Do you feel any discomfort, pain or  some sort of &#34;urinary incontinence&#34; related to it?

It&#39;s shorter because they cut away alot of it to make the new urethra but they leave it a little long incase of any complications it&#39;s not overly long but since I had no complications they can easily shorten it some more and it is something I&#39;d like. But no there no pain or discomfort or incontinence just they leave it a little longer incase of any complications

Omg sorry I missunderstood your quote up there, I thought he gave you a shorter urethra then the usual and I was like &#34;how come? Hows he gonna make it longer again?&#34; Haha now longer urethra happens to most results but didnt know he&#39;d opt for safety mesures. Also (now going on the right direction) do you feel like it gets bigger/bulgier when in arousal?

If you are up for sharing, I am curious, how many times did you apply to the Suporn lottery before receiving a surgery date. I have tried three times with no luck and am just trying to get an idea of how long it has taken for others. Thanks much.

I&#39;ve been looking at banks for a couple years now and I feel like I have asked every question I can possibly ask. So how about this, what&#39;s something who has done their research might still forget to think about? Preparation for trip? Help/supplies once back home? Etc?

Of course we&#39;ll I&#39;d say  Take one suitcase empty to bring stuff back, before you leave for Thailand start stocking up on dilation supplies condoms, lube and so on. Whatever you think you need for recovery maybe double it and then some.

Thanks very much for posting your experience! I&#39;m also from the UK and seeing Dr. Bank in September. Just wondering how did you find the flight(s) back? Did you go in economy class or higher so you could lie back? Did you notice any immediate effects on your healing/recovery after travelling?
