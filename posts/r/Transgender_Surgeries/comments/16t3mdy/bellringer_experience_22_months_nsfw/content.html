Your vulva is so cute, I think you’re results look really nice! I was originally referred to Bellringer and was happy with my choice but they recently changed mine to Rashid in a fast track waiting list which I’m also happy with :D

Thankyou. Rashid is lovely and think she probably the best UK option now. Her aesthetics I think is marginally better from what Ive seen. I did have a lot of fear going in and thought if something was wrong he was most experienced to fix it. So that also formed my decision.

This could go with some better formatting, iirc two spaces will create a new line.
</p>
<p>
From the images you have a great case result from Bellringer. Part of me has to wonder how much of that is because you&#39;re a private patient.
</p>
<p>
Puffy vulva is an entirely aesthetic choice he chooses for his patients too. As you say the natural fit the vulva comes from the scrotum so the texture is unavoidable, but the thickness is something he should be avoiding.
</p>
<p>
You didn&#39;t touch too much on aftercare aside from direct pain relief and bedside manner.  Did you not have a nurse help you get out of bed the first few times, was walking assistance not provided?  It&#39;s awful that you were able/allowed to collapse when getting out of bed.

I wrote this on my mobile. I never knew you had to double space and there was no option to edit my post on the app for some reason.
<br>
Bit annoying. All his work is private. Just the NHS is paying the cost in most cases. There are no NHS gender surgeons. It&#39;s misunderstood .
<br>
I never knew about puffy vulva as all results I had seen to that point were quite small. I think some of it is the material. My position in the pic makes it look worse than is, it&#39;s surprisingly hard to take a decent pic of your genitals.
<br>
So Bellringer came, took the bandage off the next day and said later today to get out of bed.
<br>
I did have a couple of nurses try and help me but my legs just gave way. It&#39;s not a normal situation as I seemed fully capable to that point The moment I stood in aided my blood pressure plummeted.  It was put down to a reaction to the morphine. The nurses were lovely. I can&#39;t fault them. Though the 2nd time I tried, they just said don&#39;t get up but instead just sit on the side of bed. This was 24 hours later after being on oxygen. But this time I waited 25min and then did it by myself with no one present but that was my choice. Everyone&#39;s healing is different. I was so swollen and only could shuffle.
<br>
Meanwhile another patient who had surgery the same day was walking really well and left hospital grounds and going for walks by day 3. Our bodies are more the determining factor.

I&#39;d personally argue that the nurses should be trained for that specific situation. I know his staff rotated out in its entirety sometime last year so it&#39;s possible you got less experienced nurses, but still.
</p>
<p>
For comparison I had 4 or 5 nurses help me out of bed with a walker waiting. They were supporting me throughout my first 3 attempts at standing.
</p>
<p>
My guess is Bellringer has you out of bed sooner to prevent blood clots forming, though it&#39;s likely to allow you to use the toilet sooner since he doesn&#39;t have you do a bowel cleanse.
</p>
<p>
I was in bed until 2 days post op, and then only stood once for 5 minutes before trying again the next day. The hospital I went to has you wear leg cuffs that inflate regularly to prevent clots forming so you can stay on bed rest.

He does get you out to prevent blood clots but also thinks it promotes healing. Reality is was to soon for me but by day 4 I was wondering about and spending time with other women there to.
<br>
I had full bowel cleanse before.

Thanks for this post, I&#39;m post op with Miss Rashid anyway but it&#39;s definitely nice to see positive experiences with Bellringer too.
