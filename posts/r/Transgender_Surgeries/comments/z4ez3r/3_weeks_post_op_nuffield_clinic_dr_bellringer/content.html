Looks beautiful and clean, healing very well! Results similar to mine (also Bellringer)... Personally I hope the vulvas will get bit smaller and also so far can&#39;t find my clitoris (can feel her though) as well as my labias are non existent 5 weeks in.

I have read off others that Dr bellringer has a bit of a habit of &#34;burying&#34; clitoris&#39;s but that they are normally fully functioning, I&#39;m assuming as my swelling reduces that I&#39;ll be able to find stuff abit better and hopefully have some abit more shaping in my labia etc.

I had my surgery with Mr Bellringer nearly 17 months ago and the appearance of mine at 3 weeks was very similar to yours. As the swelling goes down your outer labia will reduce in size but remember that it takes about 12 months for it to achieve its final appearance. It also seems that slightly fat outer labia are somewhat of a Bellringer &#39;trademark&#39; but none the worse for that imho. My inner labia are rather well hidden and don&#39;t protrude which is fine by me too. My cis wife has protruding inner labia, she hates them and thinks they&#39;re ugly which is interesting as many trans girls seem to want protruding inner labia for some reason ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My clitoris is well hidden too but I&#39;m happy to say it definitely works, oh girl it works!!üòÅ As for dilation, the initial three times a day routine is very punishing, especially as you&#39;re recovering from major surgery but it does get easier in time as the frequency drops. Whilst I&#39;m told I only need to dilate once a week now. I tend to do it once every 3 to 4 days using the largest orange dilator. I work on the theory that you can&#39;t really over dilate but you certainly can under dilate! Happy to help if you have any more questions and you can ask me anything and I mean anything. Hope your recovery goes well and remember, be kind to yourself, you&#39;ve put your body through a lot recently xx

She looks great. I‚Äôll bet you‚Äôre going to be so happy with her once the swelling goes down. As they‚Äôve told us all along it‚Äôs a marathon not a sprint. Best of luck to you!!

Honestly I&#39;m already happy with her now, she&#39;s not particularly sore or anything atm, just gotta be careful how I sit and make sure I&#39;m taking good care of her.

So I got like the full ostorectomy, penile inversion, vaginoplasty, I&#39;m about 3 weeks out, was a little rough at first but the hosptial staff where great and super supportive.
</p>
<p>
honestly at this point other than days I go out and move about a little to much, it&#39;s not to bad at this point. I&#39;m down to taking paracetamol and ibuprofen as and when I feel I need them, the only annoying thing is having to work mu plans around dilating 3 times a day, which can feel like a bit of a chore sometimes. But I&#39;ve taken to watching a movie or show, but only playing it when I&#39;m dilating (so 20mins at a time) and it normally keeps me entertained enough.
</p>
<p>
I had abit of a cold the last couple days which was not fun but I&#39;m feeling waaay better today.
