</a>
. Not going to bring up issues from that time period (like some of the shitty experiences in the hospital during the week-long recovery there).
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a bit over half a year figured I&#39;d give an update. Not going to post any pictures right now (resisting the urge to delete the old pics is hard enough, but trying to keep them up for resource&#39;s sake).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Good
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Things healed up great. By about 2 months I felt pretty much back to normal. Not 100% but very close. Peeing is fine. Getting off has been fine/great (via fingering can take a really long time, but with toys or whatever it&#39;s pretty great. No complaints).
</p>
<p>
Dilation is okay. My partner and I use that time to unwind and watch sitcoms at night. Dr. Roth&#39;s schedule had me dilating twice a day for the entire first year, but this point I feel fine doing it once a day. I get about 3.5 dots deep on the large orange one. I upsized a lot since the 3 month mark. One of my only recovery regrets was not dilating more aggressively at the start.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Bad
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Penetrative sex isn&#39;t the easiest. We&#39;ve been able to do it a couple times, but the angles are awkward and the process of figuring out angles and such usually results in my tightening up. It&#39;s getting better but slow.
</p>
<p>
Not an issue now, but despite feeling recovered about 2 months in, riding a bike was too much for a while. Took close to 5 months before that felt doable without regretting it.
</p>
<p>
Around the 3 month mark I had some issues with peeing myself. Usually while in the process of walking to the bathroom. I messaged one of the NPs about it, and she gave some advice. It seems to have worked out (leakage still happens a little occasionally, as is normal for vaginas, but very rare compared to multiple times a week needing to change).
</p>
<p>
I still don&#39;t
<em>
love
</em>
the appearance, but I&#39;ve come to acceptance with it. I think it looks like a cis vagina just not the &#34;platonic ideal&#34; or whatever. One minor issue is hair growing just barely inside the entrance. Not the end of the world and easy to remove but might have been worth getting some hair removal down there. This also might be an issue with my weight (I&#39;m on the heavier side and I&#39;ve always had a
<em>
very
</em>
large mons pubis).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Follow-Up Appointments
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not an issue with care, but because of the screwed up networks around here, the follow-ups happen at Eskenazi. This is not part of my tier 1 network. I&#39;ve tried to work with my insurance (ironically, working with coworkers), to get it treated as Tier 1, since there&#39;s no other options really and it&#39;s a continuance of care from an IUH surgery. Unfortunately, no dice. So I&#39;ve made the decision to not have any more follow-ups as they were costing me about $800 out of pocket per, and that&#39;s more than I can justify for what I&#39;m getting.
</p>
<p>
The follow-ups themselves were fine. They don&#39;t tell you ahead of time to come with a full bladder, so do that or they&#39;ll make you chug water basically. The follow-ups themselves were
<em>
fine
</em>
. Amanda Townsend is the assigned doctor/NP. She answers my questions well enough. Both visits she examined my canal (which is a weird feeling). My only issue is the follow-ups felt more like a consultation. My advice would be come with any questions you might have or anything you might have noticed, it seems more on the patient to bring up issues.
</p>
<p>
I have not seen or heard from Dr. Roth himself, since leaving the hospital. But that might be because I haven&#39;t really had any issues.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll note,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/11mw8kv/one_year_4_months_later_giving_up_on_dr_roth/">another user
</a>
recently has been citing some pretty bad experiences (both with results and follow-ups). The experiences do not entirely mirror my own, but I think it&#39;s good people go into things with as much info as possible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Summary
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
I&#39;m very happy with my surgery.
</strong>
The results are not
<em>
perfect
</em>
but they&#39;re quite fine. Recovery went well. I have 0 regrets around doing it, and I don&#39;t regret using Dr. Roth (I&#39;m sure enough surgeon could have given even better results but everyone can&#39;t use the exact best surgeon). If I had to do it over again, I would, and I likely wouldn&#39;t change much.

That&#39;s seem pretty consistent from what I&#39;ve heard from boots on the ground. I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re happy with everything. You mentioned Eskenazi isn&#39;t in your Tier 1 network. Are they in level 2? It seems weird, they booted you to some place your insurance doesn&#39;t cover for aftercare.

They&#39;re in my tier 2, but it&#39;s the only service I get at tier 2, so I&#39;m functionally paying the full bill just at the negotiated rate (but no cost-sharing).
</p>
<p>
Eskenazi and IUH did a joint venture to build a gender clinic in Eskenazi. The surgery &amp; recovery happens at IUH because that&#39;s where the robot they use for the PPT is. But the follow-ups happen at the gender clinic. Despite the fact they built it together, they just use it for better discounts but for my IUH insurance Eskenazi is still tier 2. It&#39;s all VERY stupid.

Yeah the &#34;link&#34; between Eskenazi and IUH is really weird and kinda useless imo. Like, I went to my consultation with IUH insurance because that&#39;s where I worked at the time. They told me that they &#34;technically&#34; don&#39;t take IUH insurance but that they had worked out some sort of deal with the insurance company. Ended up getting charged over $1200 for an ultrasound, still haven&#39;t paid it off. To compare, I went for BA at IUH about 6 months ago with my IUH insurance and pretty much the whole thing was covered.

Yeah it&#39;s crap. I canceled my 9 month and 1 year follow up because it&#39;s just not worth like $800 for basic biometrics, and a pee stream check, and effectively a Q&amp;A session with a doctor.

I am a bit late to your post. I was supposed to have surgeon with Dr. McClung out of Columbus OH, but my fu*$ing insurance wouldn&#39;t grant an exception in order for the surgery to proceed and Dr. McClung&#39;s office ghosted me like a Grindr date! SO I am back to square one, and I just recently discovered that Dr. Roth is in my &#34;network&#34;. My question is, how soon after the referral letter is faxed does Dr. Roth&#39;s office get back to you? I have waited 3 weeks and still nothing. My anxiety is getting so high, especially seeing how I was about to have THE DANG surgery on August 7th of this year!!! Ugh Please help, any info will be greatly appreciated, thank you.

Hey I’m sorry that’s happening, it sounds like hell. My surgery also had hang ups and delays due to Covid so I understand the heartache.
</p>
<p>
I really can’t answer on response time. Both because their busy-level has probably changed a lot, but also I didn’t do things properly at all. Like I just messaged them in a health portal (because I didn’t know at the time the proper method) but, as result, they didn’t get back to me for like 3 months. But that probably wasn’t even their fault (given the irregular contact method)

No worries, I know I have to wait again. It just breaks me into two having to start all over... I was so dang close! Anyways, thank you for replying to your old post! Means a bunch! Which... means, you&#39;re in the same city as me?! Least near it! I am glad that this area isn&#39;t completely void of an opportunity to be complete. Thanks again!
