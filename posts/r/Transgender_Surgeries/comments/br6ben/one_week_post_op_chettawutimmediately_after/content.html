Maybe not thattt but but put it this way, I can understand now why people say they are so uncomfortable!
</p>
<p>
Why does it look like it’s coming out from the vagina rather than the urethra? 🤔

Swelling has made everything super puffy so it changes the angles and dimensions of everything thus making it look like it’s in the vagina hole but I can tell that it is above it :)

I was really anxious because my painkillers were not on a high enough dosage so it felt like my vag was ripped open but no, it was just normal post op pain. There isn’t that much swelling or bruising and I think she is absolutely beautiful. I couldn’t be any happier. She is 6.75” at full depth.

Is it okay if I ask some questions about the skin/area they had to start with, etc.? Hoping to be post-op someday.

Here&#39;s some things I&#39;d like to know...
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Were you cut or uncut? If cut, was it &#34;high and tight&#34; American style (where they remove like, everything) or just the tip?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
About how long were you, roughly?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Did they need to use a skin graph? Were there any concerns about length or size?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What about hair? Any electrolysis or anything around that area?
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please only answer if you&#39;re comfortable and thank you.

• Uncut 🙂
</p>
<p>
• I was really small when soft but 7” hard.
</p>
<p>
• They did use the skin graft. I honestly don’t  think he would’ve needed it if he looked around long enough but all he really did was take a quick pic and that was it. But then again what do I know? Regardless I’m super happy with my depth and my lips.
</p>
<p>
• I’ve never really been hairy and my pubes only really went out 2” beyond the base of my dick and didn’t reach my hips. I had almost no scrotum hair and it was thin and blonde. My perineum and bootyhole were naturally hairless. I got pretty lucky in this regard. So I did not do electrolysis. Which still is not recommended by Chettawut regardless.

It somehow appeared on my front page almost immediately after you posted it, and at that point it definitely wasn’t. Thanks regardless, though.

Yay good luck on your journey! All I can say is it is very mentally emotionally and physically taxing. And you will need longer than two weeks to really mentally prepare. 😅 take it from me. It didn’t really hit me until now, when i got to touch my own vagina. (Never has an experience with a vagina before this... It’s so squishy lol) And in that moment, all doubt and fear and dysphoria melted away. My body is finally mine. No words to describe the feeling. ☺️
</p>
<p>
Also I way overpacked my clothes. All you really need is one cute outfit for consultation day and two shirts and two skirts. And the rest of the necessary supplies. But really don’t bring too many clothes you’ll regret not having the packing space. Because you will come back with half a suitcase more of dilation supplies.... sigh.I haven’t left my hotel except to buy groceries once, and I’ve been naked in my hotel all by myself since lol. I came here alone; it’s painful, but doable. That’s all I have to say. It’s a journey of a lifetime tho ❤️

Very brave of you to go alone too! I definitely hibernated for safety reasons. I’m honestly stand out from the crowd, am blonde, and I just look clueless haha so I knew it wouldn’t really be smart for me to go out and look touristy... might want to take that into consideration. That’s why I don’t really suggest going out or bringing many clothes.
</p>
<p>
I’m at the Novotel. The bed is not comfy at all and my ass is sore (def not as sore as my vagina though haha) but the quality of everything is good and I definitely feel cared for. Although there are not many trans girls here (3, the other two leave in a few days) so I feel pretty alone. But definitely worth cutting down on the cost in my opinion. The longer drive is honestly barely any distance, even on the ride back from the hospital.

So they supplied 1 package of docaine and 6 of the qc lube. I have already used one tube of docaine after 5 dilations so you do fly through it. Each package is about the size of a box of toothpaste.

Hahahah ;) and thanks!! From my personal experience, I don’t really swell much. I didn’t swell for my wisdom teeth removal and for some reason I knew I wouldn’t really swell much for this. Albeit there is definitely swelling but it doesn’t look like it’s about to pop from swelling pressure haha. I guess I’m just trying to say that initial results really are just based on genetics and how your body naturally reacts to getting cut open haha.
