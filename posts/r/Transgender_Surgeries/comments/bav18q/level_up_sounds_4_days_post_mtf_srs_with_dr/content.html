I just took the outer dressings off, leaving a thin, clear dressing over the protective gauze. Still have the wound-vac and catheter in. It&#39;s bloody, bruised, and swollen, but definitely vaginish!
</p>
<p>
(heads up, this is pretty graphic and bloody)

Feel free to ask any questions! I&#39;ll be sure to post more pics as things heal, since there aren&#39;t a lot of examples of her work online.

<h1>
4/3, Day 1 Pre Op
</h1>
<p>
My wife and I took the train down to NYC, stayed in a cheap (relative to midtown Manhattan) hotel. Got the call saying to be at the hospital at 6AM Thursday morning. Got some delicious pho.
</p>
<h1>
4/4, V-Day
</h1>
<p>
Show up at hospital around 5AM (couldn&#39;t sleep any more). They take me back around 6:15 to change into a gown and do initial vital checks, meet with my surgeons and anesthesiologist, and wait for the OR to open up. At 7:30 I&#39;m wheeled into the OR (which is freezing!), where 12-15 doctors and nurses are shuffling around getting everything ready. Rachel&#39;s assistant verifies my identity and makes me comfortable on the operating table. The anesthesiologist puts in the IV and in his very calming, relaxing voice talks me through the process of going to sleep. The mask eventually goes on, I take a few deep breaths, and then....wake up in a recovery room around 11AM! It takes me a while to process what&#39;s happened and that I&#39;m awake. I ask for water, and the nursing staff is lovely. I don&#39;t have on makeup and my hair is a mess, but my main nurse CJ never once slips up with pronouns. I get some painkillers, pillows, and blankets. I can&#39;t sit up, the worst pain is soreness in my abdomen and the gas from the robot working its way through my system. I&#39;m beyond exhausted, and try to sleep. It took a long time for us to get a room, and around 11PM I finally get moved into my room where I&#39;ll live for the next 6 days.
</p>
<h1>
4/5, Day 1 Post Op
</h1>
<p>
Didn&#39;t sleep much, but I&#39;m not really that awake, either. Gas pain is unbearable and painkillers don&#39;t help. Rolling from side to side is recommended to help the gas dissipate, but it hurts too much. I notice that my belly button has an incision all around it
<a href="https://imgur.com/IMd2kEX">(pic)</a>
-- I find out later that they actually cut it out (leaving it on it&#39;s &#34;stalk&#34;) so that the robot can get in to do the internal stitching. What a world we live in. They bring food 3x/day, and while I get to choose my meals, none of it is all that great. They start me on stool softeners (to help with constipation from the oxy and anesth) and start doing heparin shots to prevent blood clots. Residents from both Dr. Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Zhao&#39;s teams stop by a couple of times per day to check things out. Dr. Bluebond stops by herself a few times during the coming week, and is excited for me!
</p>
<h1>
4/6 Day 2 Post Op
</h1>
<p>
Still recovering, though mobility is a bit better. Gas is starting to work its way out, the abdomen pain starts going away a little, though still very sore from the robot incision. A PT arrives to help me move to a reclining chair for a few hours and enjoy the view. I manage to make it to the bathroom unassisted, though it creates a lot of pain. Turns out the laxatives were too much, blegh. Be careful with them! Diarrhea at this point in recovery is a bit of a nightmare. Standing up causes the gas to rise through the torso and into the shoulders, where it seems to settle into the joints, making my shoulders super achy. I&#39;m told this is normal, take my painkillers, and lay back down. Amusingly, they start giving me viagra -- even though I have no erectile tissue, it&#39;s still great at increasing blood flow in the genital region and helps everything heal faster. The increased blood flow makes my clit start to hurt a bit, but it just feels like the head of my penis is chaffing. My brain still needs to remap what sensations go where.
</p>
<h1>
4/7 Day 3 Post Op
</h1>
<p>
Starting to feel a bit closer to normal. Gas pain is becoming bearable, and isn&#39;t always present. I walk around the hospital for a bit, with a PT carrying my cath bag and wound vac. The Kimmel Pavilion is a beautiful facility, and I catch some awesome views of the east river. I walk for a total of maybe 5 minutes before sitting back down. Continue the cycle of eating, sleeping, taking pills, having my IV replaced, etc. Manage to sit up and play a little Stardew Valley on my laptop, but spend most of my time watching Netflix.
</p>
<h1>
4/8 Day 4 Post Op
</h1>
<p>
Feeling significantly better, got a lot of sleep overnight. Diarrhea is finally over. Residents tell me to start peeling off the outer bandages during their rounds, which I do, leading to the above picture. My first glimpse of her -- She&#39;s swollen, but she&#39;s definitely a vulva and not a penis now! Kevin (the LGBTQ liason, who is wonderful and amazing) should stop by with a bag of goodies for me soon -- dilators, pads, all that fun stuff. I&#39;m gonna go for another walk once I get my afternoon pain killers.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow, Drs. Bluebond and Zhao will come by in the morning to take off the final dressings, remove the catheter, pull out the packing, clean things up, and do my first dilation. After that, I have to shower, douche, dilate myself (with Kevin and Ginger&#39;s help -- Ginger is a fantastically feisty woman whom I already adore),  shower and douche again, pee twice, and if everything looks good, I&#39;ll be discharged in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
A couple of suggestions: Bring a neck pillow. It&#39;s life saver during bedrest. A heating pad for your shoulders is also nice when the gas pain gets up there. I brought some baby wipes, and these were so helpful since my bowels weren&#39;t happy after waking up. I highly recommend packing some.
</p>
<p>
If there&#39;s anything else anyone wants to know, I&#39;m an open book! &lt;3

If I may ask, what kind of surgery did you get? I know the peritoneal pull-through is the hot new thing on Reddit and Dr. Bluebond does that, my wife&#39;s pretty interested in the technique.

The technical term on all of the paperwork is &#34;robotic penile inversion vaginoplasty&#34;, but she does use peritoneal tissue. It&#39;s not like Ting, who AIUI has used the peritoneum to construct the majority of the canal. Instead, she uses it to augment the penile inversion technique in sort of a hybrid method. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the &#34;pull through&#34; method you refer to, but maybe?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to be asking her a million questions about this in the morning, I&#39;ll share what I find out!

So it turns out that I didn&#39;t get a chance to ask as many questions as I would have liked during the packing removal session -- holy mother of god things move quickly on discharge day! I&#39;ll see if I can get more info during a followup appt.
</p>
<p>
One of the really nice perks of this approach is that I ended up with around 7&#34; of depth (งツ)ว

Thank you for sharing your experience. Were you required to have genital hair removed prior to surgery? If so, how did you go about that?

I did. BBL does scrape the follicles, but I&#39;ve heard so many people say that scraping alone is not enough, and I had a decent amount of hair to worry about. I had about 25 hours of electrolysis (out of pocket cost is ~$1500) to prepare. We didn&#39;t get it all with electro, but hopefully enough that the stragglers will be caught by the scrape.

I&#39;m out of the hospital and doing the airbnb recovery thing! I&#39;ll make another post next week and put in some more diary entries and do more AMA (though feel free to keep asking questions on this one!).
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, here are some more pics, without the dressings tamping everything down. It&#39;s swollen and bruised, but I love it and think it&#39;ll be so pretty once the swelling goes down. So far, I&#39;m very happy with my result from this team!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/GTY0ZCw">6 days post op</a>
Bruised and swollen, but she&#39;s going to be beautiful once healed!
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/wfdccGp">dilating</a>
It looks so painful, doesn&#39;t it? But it doesn&#39;t hurt at all, just use a lot of lube and be patient! I&#39;m mainly sharing this because I&#39;m super happy with the depth. Kevin said this is about 7&#34;! If it was any deeper, I&#39;d need a longer dilator xD I was pretty average sized beforehand, maybe 6&#34;, but BBL uses peritoneal tissue to augment the penile inversion, so she gets pretty amazing depth for the amount of material. They also started me on the second-to-largest dilator, and it&#39;s a snug fit, but it works :)
</li>

Just for fun. There was a part of me that wanted to treat this like a vacation. I was wrong, lol.

That&#39;s a hell of a schedule! How long do you have to stay on the 4x a day dilation schedule? If you don&#39;t mind providing details like how long it takes, can you do other stuff, etc.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m nervous about the dilation because it seems really intense.

IIRC, it goes something like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Month 1: 4x/day
</li>
<li>
Month 2: 3x/day
</li>
<li>
Month 3-6: 2x/day
</li>
<li>
Month 6-12: 1x/day
</li>
<li>
Month 12+: 1-3x/week
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each dilation is for 15 minutes, and takes an additional 5 minutes to set up and 10-15 minutes to clean up. I usually just start a timer and watch netflix or something. I stay on my back on a puppy pad, since the lube and usually a bit of blood comes out when the dilator is removed and can be quite messy.
</p>
<p>
It is extremely intense, this is basically my life for the next two months. I hear that in month 3, dropping down to 2x/day lets life start to feel somewhat normal, but until then...it&#39;s a marathon. Make sure you have support in place, it can be really depressing and exhausting without someone to break up the monotony with.

Thanks! Even though this month is probably the hardest part, it&#39;s good to be &#34;on the other side&#34; at last :) I&#39;m definitely looking forward to reducing my dilations!

these might be more interesting pics for the wiki than what&#39;s up there now. I plan to do these posts every week or so during the recovery, but eventually I&#39;ll just make a summary/index post so you can just link to that and keep things simple.
</p>
<p>
BTW, thanks for the awesome work you do on the wiki! It&#39;s a monumental amount of effort to maintain something like that, but it&#39;s so valuable for our community.

Thanks. I&#39;ll probably add all the photo&#39;s as I think the more the better. I think it would help if you could add a caption to the photo&#39;s themselves on imgur with the year, surgeon, days/weeks/etc post-op, and any interesting points about the photo.
</p>
<p>
It is very helpful to cross link these kinds of posts, backwards and forwards, as it can be difficult to find them all after a a few years if someone makes a lot of posts. Also some people don&#39;t know how to use reddit and won&#39;t find them if the links are not right in front of them.
</p>
<p>
I might make add a section on how to research and how to make easier to search posts.

Sounds good. I will definitely crosslink them and start putting photos into albums with captions. Once there are enough, I&#39;ll make a separate post to index them with direct links to the albums.

How&#39;s the recovery? I think if I do get GRS I&#39;ll do it with your surgeon, I saw that she does a procedure that is less invasive (via laparoscopy or sth?). I&#39;m terrified about the pain tbh :(

The pain from the actual surgery isn&#39;t that bad, honestly. I feel a slight stinging around my clit and urethra, but other than that, the new vagina doesn&#39;t really hurt. My abdomen was extremely sore from the belly-button incision -- it felt like when you get the flu and throw up a lot leaving your tummy sore.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, the absolute worst pain is from the robot gas. It&#39;s not a laproscopic surgery, but similar -- they insert a small robot through your belly button that does the internal work, like securing the vaginal canal. They pump your tum full of gas to give the robot room to work/see, and while they suck most of it out before closing the wound, they can&#39;t get it all. And it HURTS while it works its way out (eventually you&#39;ll pass it all out as flatulence). It took about three days for me to stop hurting from it, but now I feel pretty much zero pain on day four, and I haven&#39;t had narcotics since early this morning.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I edited the OP with some more details about the first few days if you&#39;d like more info. Feel free to ask anything else! I&#39;ll link to a picture of my belly button incision soon. It&#39;s pretty nasty looking lol.

Well, specifically compared to Thai surgeons, the big reason is that my insurance covered her. I live in NY, and the state mandates that insurance companies must cover SRS with US surgeons, and I really am glad I don&#39;t have to do a long flight a couple weeks after surgery.
</p>
<p>
With my insurance, I had to choose between Bowers and BBL. Bowers has a 4 year waiting list and is on the other side of the country (boo long flights), and while I do admire Bowers greatly, BBL also does fantastic work and deserves a lot more reputation than she currently has. Kevin -- her amazing, wonderful nurse -- is doing a ton of work to make the process at NYU as smooth and easy as possible, including offering pre-op classes to prepare for the surgery. I highly recommend attending these, I felt so well prepared for this after going.

Pretty great, honestly! I was in a good place when I started, my wife is with me, and I&#39;ve been super open about this whole process with friends so I&#39;ve got a ton of support and people checking in on me. I highly recommend building out a large support network and having someone you trust come with you! It makes all of the difference.

It looks like things are going great! So great for you! ♥️

<p>
I have my consultation with Drs. Bluebond and Zhou in July. I will be using all your diaries to prepare and help me through. I&#39;m very excited.
</p>
<p>
How long was your surgery date after your consultantion? I want to prepare and time the rest of grad school around the recovery.

Awesome! They are a great team and they do awesome work. I&#39;m swollen and bruised right now, but I can tell that it&#39;ll be SO PRETTY once it heals! I can&#39;t wait :)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad my ramblings are useful! I love reading these sorts of diaries when preparing for something like this, so I&#39;m glad others are finding them useful, too.
</p>
<p>
I was just discharged Tuesday, and the couple of days afterwards were a whirlwind, but I&#39;ll try to make weekly posts updating my condition, showing the healing process, and opening up to answer questions. So keep an eye out :)
</p>
<p>
For me, I had six months wait to get a consult, and another 14 months for the surgery. I think she&#39;s currently booked out for surgeries through the end of 2020. She&#39;s a very busy woman...a couple days after my SRS she was doing 5 top surgeries for some trans dudes in one day O.o I&#39;m sure if you mention a prefered time of year they can work with you, though you might end up waiting a little longer -- but I definitely recommend allowing 2-3 months to recover.

14mo after consultation would be rough timing for me. But we&#39;ll see what she says after the consultation!

YES! This really has been wonderful every step of the way. It sucks to do the recovery, but it would anywhere, and NYU has an awesome thing going.

I&#39;m not sure, but I imagine so as it&#39;s some sort of surgical dressing and not just tape :-) it&#39;ll come off tomorrow when my surgeon comes in to clean everything up and do my first dilation.

You&#39;re welcome! Her team, the hospital, and the staff here at NYU Langone are all fantastic. I highly recommend this place!

It&#39;s still super early, but I want to share as much as possible, since I know how important this information is when selecting a surgeon. If you have any questions about the experience I&#39;ve had here feel free to ask!

I&#39;m from Albany. They make you stay somewhere within an hour of the hospital for 2 weeks after discharge, so be sure to plan for this! I got an airbnb in Astoria for about $2k. So in total, that&#39;s 6 days in the hospital, and another two weeks nearby, then at least another month recovering at home.

It pulled about 500 mL of fluid out of the vaginal canal while it healed. I believe its main purpose is to keep stagnant blood etc from sitting in the canal, and/or seeping out from around the bandages into the bed.

By the time I was discharged, it pulled out about a liter of fluid in total. I also wanted to add that with the penile inversion technique, the canal opening is not a wound, so there&#39;s no worry of having it close up. The vac just keeps the stitches from being soaked so that they can heal faster.

I&#39;ll know that by tomorrow, though right now everything is so swollen that peeing is going to be ... weird. And spray-ie.

I think the weirdest part of this for me is not having to tuck anymore. I&#39;ll probably still try xD But hey, no more gaffs, yay!

Okay, as someone who is just starting out, the idea of not having to tuck makes me super jealous. Every time I have to squish my penis I just want to get vaginoplasty more. So when I get to your point I&#39;m probably going to sign paperwork for the surgery faster than I ever signed anything before.

So I&#39;m out of the hospital and doing the whole airbnb recovery thing now. Showering is very precise and careful cleaning of all the swollen nooks and crannies right now. Peeing kinda sucks. I have no idea where the pee comes out, I just feel a tickling down there and then is starts dripping off of a butt cheek. Fun. Once the swelling goes down it&#39;ll be easier to tell. I&#39;ll post more pics soon so folks can get an idea of how the swelling looks this early.
