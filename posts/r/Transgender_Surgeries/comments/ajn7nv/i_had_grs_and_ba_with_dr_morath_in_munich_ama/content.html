I had GRS with vaginoplasty &amp; labiaplasty about 1.5 years ago. Then half a year ago I she performed the second stage together with breast augmentation/top surgery. I know a lot of trans folks are searching for information on her &amp; Dr schaffs results. So I thought I would give something back to the community. Maybe I&#39;m gonna upload photos too, but haven&#39;t done any close ups since the second surgery. Ask me anything

Congratulations on your surgery! For your breast augmentation, did you get textured or smooth implants? Under the muscle placement or over the muscle? And how many cc?

Thanks! I got textured teardrop implants under the muscle. 210cc I think. I really like them. They are still quite small, but just right for my shape. Although I have to say, that the scars are still quite noticeable and some areas are still numb, hope that&#39;s gonna get better

Recovery took quite long for me after the first surgery. I had really strong vaginal bleeding three weeks after it and had ton go to er in another town. Guess to the blood loss I was quite weak for a while. Dilation really sucked in the beginning and it took a while until things looked good. About 3 months until I was back on my feet, sort of. Recovery from the second surgery was quite easy, although the breast implants are really uncomfy in the beginning and I had ingrown hair right at one incision on my labia majora. Also post op depression was a problem for me and made recovery harder

Congrats on your surgery. What types of things do you recommend for overcoming post-op depression? It seems to be a relatively common issue.

For me, knowing that my state of mind, is post op depression, made it a lot more bareable. A supportive social networks helps. Benzos &amp; masturbation also did their job.

I think most people normally upload it to an image-hosting website like imgur, and then copy the link that the site creates, or is that not what you mean ?

Hi. I have an appointment with dr. Schaff on 1st of March. I hope I will have one with her as well. What was the waiting period for the surgery? How long were you hospitalized? How was the pain and the pain management? I hope you can answer if you want the question - I know that it&#39;s private stuff. Thaank youu 😊

I just found it a lot easier to trust her, but I also just really dislike old men and found it easier to talk about woman stuff with her.
</p>
<p>
About waiting time, i think I just waited few months after I sent them my kostenbewilligung und paid the 3000€ bonus. Nothing like years, but their waiting times are super random. They range from 3 months to 4 years.
</p>
<p>
First time I was 2.5 weeks in hospital I think, second time 5 days
</p>
<p>
The pain was.... Intense. But I&#39;ll just forget about it. Pain management was OK, depends on the nurses. Some of them give u really good pain killers, but others just stay with the ibu &amp; novalgin. When ure still in pain, just tell them
</p>
<p>
Totally alright to ask stuff, that&#39;s why I&#39;m doing the ama

Hmm, so in terms of result she has about the same as Schaff. 2.5 weeks in Hospital? 😵 I was thinking I might get back to my sedentary desk job in 4 weeks 😖. I will try to talk to her also. Many thanks for the reply 😊

Also had friends that were in hospital for 4 weeks. I definitely wasn&#39;t able to work after 4 weeks. Take ur time with healing if possible. Also if u just take the date that they give u, u don&#39;t have influence on who&#39;s performing the surgery, but I guess the results aren&#39;t really different.

Hey! Have been desperately researching any and all information about them, and would love it if you could answer a couple of questions (although given their nature you are extremely welcome to avoid any that are too personal or invasive ._.) -
</p>
<p>
I have seen some claims that Schaff (and presumably then Morath by extension) favours a &#39;smaller, more shaped clitoris&#39;, with the adjoining claim that that meant it might be less sensitive - any idea of whether this is true or not either from them or from your now personal experience?
</p>
<p>
Did you hear anything from them about the likelihood of complications from their operations/what those complications are?
</p>
<p>
Do you know how important the size of your genitals are to depth with them, or similar to the Thai doctors is there a certain amount that is more or less guaranteed?
</p>
<p>
And how is the self-lubrication? Do you personally have any/enough/satisfactory amounts, and is it something that is expected with their technique/ that they are confident about?
</p>

<p>
So, about their clits, or better said my clit: I personally find my clit a bit too big and its one of the few things I&#39;m a bit unsure about, cause I can kind of still see what it was made out of (frenulum+glans if u want medical terms, I don&#39;t really like them, but I guess they are useful here). My clit is definitely not smaller or more shaped. I guess I could have had sth done there in the second surgery, but I was too afraid of loosing feeling there. I also heard of people that had their clit really deep buried in their labia minora and hood, but that&#39;s definitely not the case for me. Its definitely really sensitive, no problems at all with that. You just have to get used to touch it in a different way, than before surgery.
</p>
<p>
Complications... That&#39;s definitely a thing. I think in every case I have seen, there was some sort of complication. I guess that&#39;s kind of normal. Most of them are really small and easy to handle. I had really strong bleeding after I came back home and had to go to er (where they actually didn&#39;t do anything). Their method definitely has downsides cause its a bit more complicated than standard pi, but in my opinion its definitely worth it.
</p>
<p>
They use scotum skin for extra depth, but I guess most doctors do that now. I think the size of your genitals definitely influences the depth of the vagina. I lost a lot of depht, cause of my complications. I&#39;m still ca 14cm, which is enough for me. Also they use the skin from your urethra which makes the vagina a lot more flexible, at least for me
</p>
<p>
The technique they use (with the urethra skin) makes self lubrication a lot more possible. I don&#39;t have problems with it, I&#39;m always a bit wet and things get quite slippery when I get horny. When I come everything&#39;s slimy. But it also depends, some days I&#39;m just dryer and in need of lube/spit/other peoples slime. I have talked to friends that also had surgery with them and not all of them get that wet and morath also doesn&#39;t guarantee self lubrication. Its still quite likely
</p>
<p>
Its also important to know, that always something can go wrong. Some of my sisters also had bad experiences with Dr morath. Still she(&amp;schaff) are a really good choice in germany and most of their pussies look really good. You also get free labia plasty if you want it to look differently.

Hey so, I&#39;d love to ask some questions. First - congratulations on your surgery, I actually followed the AMA from picture link and I have to say that I&#39;d kill for results like those :D
</p>
<p>
First, is Dr Morath generally any kind of Germany exclusive? If I wanted to do the OP being from another EU country, would there be any communication problems if I don&#39;t understand german?
</p>
<p>
What was the price for OP, and what was the second stage OP about? Some visual corrections or another procedure (and if yes, and I can ask - what procedure?)
</p>
<p>
Would you recommend Dr Morath over Thai surgeons? Do you know anyone who isn&#39;t really happy about the outcome and would decide another way if taken back in time?
</p>
<p>
Sorry for asking such intrusive questions but I am really split about who I should go to. Thanks for answering and have good day. ♥

Dr. Morath is definitely not German exclusive. There are people from other countries coming to her. She also assisted Marci bowers so she has international contacts. She&#39;s a quite modern doctor, so I don&#39;t think there should be problems with talking to her in english. I always spoke to her in german, so I don&#39;t really know for sure. Theres another ama from someone from UK (I think) somewhere, u could ask there
</p>
<p>
The price was 3000 for me and my insurance paid the rest. I heard somewhere that its 19000 for people that pay themselves, but I don&#39;t know for sure.
</p>
<p>
It totally depends on your results what they do in the second stage op. I only did a small labia plasty on my outer labia ( I had what they call &#34;dog ears&#34; ) and had my clit moved a bit more in. Now everythings really symmetrical. Actually I didn&#39;t really need it, but it was still really nice. Also I find it easier to come after the second stage, but maybe that&#39;s just random... I talked to a lot of other people and many had something done on their bulbus, which is erectile stuff connected to the vaginal wall and behind the clit (I think?!). Some others also had problems with scarring on the inside, or wanted to have it deeper. It really depends on what u need and want
</p>
<p>
Actually I don&#39;t know if I would recommend her over Thai surgeons. I really like how I&#39;m able to get wet and stuff and I honestly can&#39;t complain, but to be really honest, I went to her, cause she was, in my eyes, the best choice for me personally. I knew that I would never have the money to go to supporn, or Marci bowers. My insurance paid most of it, so I went there. I&#39;m happy with my results, but I guess with more financial resources I would have gone to Marci bowers.  From all the people I have met, that had surgery with her, one person said that she wasn&#39;t sure if would do it again. But I don&#39;t think that has to do with Dr morath, but more with GRS in general.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t worry about asking, I did the ama for that. I know that its really hard to get information. Hope that helps you 🌮❤
