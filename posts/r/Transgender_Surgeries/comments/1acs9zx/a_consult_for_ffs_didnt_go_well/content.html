if what you say is true then thank god, you just saved yourself from some mishap… don’t worry there are very good surgeons in the world who are ready to help.
</p>
<p>
when it comes to FFS everyone including doctors forget that it’s not if anyone passes already or doesn’t at all, it’s a preference to be better version of my current self and the degree to what it is and how i wanna be is my own choice.
</p>
<p>
a doctor or a friend can warn us of going overboard but they don’t get to set the limits, especially my limits

“I do my makeup in lowlight because my masculine features make me uncomfortable”
</p>
<p>
I swear to god that hit hard af for me because that was me for years before FFS.
</p>
<p>
YOU are a perfect candidate for FFS with dysphoria like that. Don’t give up. Schedule another consult!

What do you mean with you don&#39;t know if he&#39;s horrible? If he reacts like that in a phone call, he proved that he&#39;s horrible. You&#39;ll definitely find a better one!

That’s wildly unprofessional. Makes no sense at all hon. Find another surgeon I’m so sorry. Also maybe find one that will do an in person consult if it’s possible

Don&#39;t go to a general plastic surgeon for FFS...go to a specialist.

I really don&#39;t get why people are up in arms about this. He may have done OP a favor by denying service because he didn&#39;t see any need for surgery.
</p>
<p>
You
<strong>
want
</strong>
a surgeon that calls you on unnecessary BS rather than just doing surgery because you want it and doing your exact wants.
</p>
<p>
The doctor spent a good part, if not greater, of a decade learning their craft and know what will look good on people. Few people want to admit that BDD is a kissing cousin of GID. If you look at many plastic surgeons&#39; reviews, you&#39;ll read stories very similar to OP: &#34;I wanted &lt;x&gt;, Dr. WhatsIt said that wouldn&#39;t look good and could result in bad outcomes. WHAT A HACK&#34;
</p>
<p>
And then all the doctors who take these patients get the other side of the story, &#34;I wanted &lt;x&gt;, Dr. WhoseIt said that would be no problem but I had a bad outcome and now I have to go to Dr. WhereEms to fix this hackjob&#34;
</p>
<p>
Then you just continue down this rabbithole and in 8 years, this person&#39;s nose barely functions and looks like a needlepin on their face.
</p>
<p>
Listen to your fucking doctors. Yes, get a second or third opinion but if one or two have said &#34;No, I won&#39;t do that&#34;, ask the doctor who agrees to it why they made that choice.

Frequently it’s because they don’t think they’ll be able to make the patient happy if they seem too overly critical of themselves.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like she wants to change her entire face and you need to be in a really good place mentally to have that many procedures together.
</p>
<p>
Recovery is also brutal and swelling takes a while to see the result. If the pt is already very sensitive, the surgeon isn’t going to want to be the one operating or talking them through that recovery.
</p>
<p>
Plastic surgeons are hesitant with patients who they perceive as having unrealistic expectations of surgery or who might struggle with their appearance during the recovery (swelling lasts for months).

I can only think of 2 explanations for his behaviour, and they&#39;re both about reputation.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Thinks you&#39;re so dysphoric that you won&#39;t like the result of his surgery and will tell people.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Thinks that to feel that way in the mirror you must look so male that his surgery could look unsuccessful. Ie. doesn&#39;t understand what GD is at all.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Either way he sounds no good.

No, it&#39;s not about what you said or saying the wrong thing. It&#39;s about the person on the other side of the line being ignorant and forgetting why they took the Hippocratic oath

Woah fuck that, very negative interaction and wouldn&#39;t trust someone like that with a knife near my face
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also never had an FFS consult ask me what I want first, it&#39;s always been me sending in pictures and them recommending what I need and then answering any questions I have from there.
