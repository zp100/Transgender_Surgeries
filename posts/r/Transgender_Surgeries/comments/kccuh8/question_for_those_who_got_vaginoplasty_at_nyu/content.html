9 months post op with RBL at NYU. I have great depth (last dot on orange and also large penises) and sex is amazing. Sheâ€™s absolutely incredible :-)

Yes, that&#39;s rbl. Rbl generally does combo pi-ppt as default from what I understand.

Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s PPT but itâ€™s a peritoneal graft I think. They also go through your belly button with a robot ðŸ¤–ðŸ˜Š

I had a peritoneal graft vaginoplasty revision with Drs. Rachel Bluebond-Langner and Lee Zhao in June of this year, and I got very good results. Plus that Kimmel Pavilion Hospital is amazing and the staff is great.  Highly recommend RBL and Zhao.
</p>
<p>
In the hospital I was able to get past the last dot on the green dilator on the first supervised post-surgery attempt (compared to the first dot on the blue dilator before surgery), but I did eventually  lose some depth after a couple of months, which was pretty much my fault. I was almost three years post-op from my original vaginoplasty, and I could not get my head into dilating multiple times a day after a couple of years doing it once a week.
</p>
<p>
I can get to the second to the last dot on the orange dilator now.  I just had my six-month follow-up with RBL last week and she says I can get some depth back if I start being more diligent with dilations, so I will try to do that.
</p>
<p>
Overall I am pretty happy with the results. For some reason I can get gushy wet now when aroused, whereas before I got very little self-lubrication, and I went from virtually zero on the orgasm scale to panting-inducing orgasms that curl my toes now.

Thank you so much for sharing your experience! This is so reassuring. What was the recovery like for the revision vs your original vaginoplasty? Was it just as invasive of a procedure to recover from?

The recovery was less painful than the original SRS for the most part.  I had a lot of bladder pain, but that was due to the adhesions around my bladder that needed to be dissected away,  which is why I needed a revision in the first place because it led to vaginal stenosis.
</p>
<p>
They use a laproscopic robotic microsurgery technique that required only two small incisions less than an inch long. One was near my belly button and the other one was in my lower left abdomen near my bikini line.  I didn&#39;t even have trouble sitting up after surgery.  I was pleasantly surprised.

RBL did my surgery 6 months ago. I would recommend her and her team to anyone. Excellent results. No complications in my case, even with a full depth canal without prior hair removal. Dilation schedule is more rigorous than from other surgeons, 2x/d 15-20mins for the first year. I was the teamâ€™s third surgery of the day back in June. Theyâ€™re great at what they do. Aftercare has been incredible from the entire team. AMA, here or DM.

hey! this is my first time hearing about a negative experience with Jess Ting and I have a consult with him this week. Do you know it&#39;s something that he and his team fucked up on or a complication of the healing that he&#39;s been unhelpful with fixing?

Hey! He fucked up on it. I went to him soon into the start of his practice and I just trusted the referral from Marci Bowers and her team. However, I wish I&#39;d have waited, because I began working in trans healthcare and have since heard a lot of issues with him from other patients of his. At this point, in trans healthcare in nyc, its known he&#39;s sloppy with his work. He&#39;s even had lawsuits and the initial director of the trans program at mount sinai left due to not wanting to be affiliated with him. I&#39;d be careful. I hear much better things about RBL at NYU

From what i&#39;ve heard, his students are better in most everyway. Avanessian primarily, Pang is a bit too new to form a consensus or opinion on. Especially in bedside manner and follow-up department. Pretty much every Avenessian result i&#39;ve seen has been cosmetically superior to Ting. I think he&#39;s just extremely overworked and his results are suffering hugely from overextending himself. He has to goto one person to the next, production line approach.
</p>

The bureaucracy of Mt Sinai is the other facet of this, heard terrible terrible things, especially just talking about the clustertruck that is scheduling, but I imagine complaints and follow-up would fall under that too.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Pang was my second choice actually, decided on Wittenberg though, I live in AZ so much closer and longer track record.

thank you so much and i&#39;m so sorry to hear about your experience! i really don&#39;t know how i missed the negative experiences in my research (they may have seemed like outliers when originally looking), but I wonder if it&#39;s why Dr. Pang paused when I told him I planned on seeing Dr. Ting for GCS and suggested he do both my surgeries himself (I&#39;m scheduled for FFS with Pang.) Mount Sinai as a hospital has been pretty garbage in terms of scheduling but I was kinda of chalking that up to it being a pandemic right now :/ I&#39;ll look into RBL and I think I&#39;ll reconsider Pang&#39;s offer to do GCS too.
