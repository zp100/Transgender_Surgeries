Hi cuties~
</p>
<p>
My surgery was in February of 2021. The surgery went great with no complications. My surgeon used the peritoneal pull-through technique and the surgery was robot-assisted. You can see more details by reading my previous two posts about my surgery:
</p>

I&#39;m here with a 1-year update on how everything has healed! And also to answer questions :).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I healed in record time, smashing the surgeon&#39;s expectations.
</li>
<li>
My depth has gone down to 9cm. It&#39;s a pretty big change, the theory is that my body is an aggressive healer and while that was great for the surgery in general, it reduced my depth much more than expected.
</li>
<li>
Orgasms are very, very achievable and they are AMAZING. I&#39;m still experiencing changes even now, as the nerves still have more work to do. My surgeon says it will only get better :)
</li>
<li>
I love how my vulva looks, I have well-defined labia minora and an excellent hood.
</li>
<li>
Constant discharge is still happening, its expected to continue forever. I wear reusable pads whenever I go out, and when at home I change underwear more often.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I&#39;m scheduled for a revision in a few months to address some possible strictures or tight muscle in the vaginal canal, and to remove some excess tissue on my fourchette that is making it difficult to have PIV sex.
</p>
<p>
Please ask me anything that you might want to know! Only rule is no pictures.

Hi, thanks so much for sharing!!! I&#39;ve had a consult with both Wittenberg and Bonnigton and am likely going to go with them :)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How did you plan for recovery? Did you have someone you knew there to take care of you? Where&#39;d you stay?
</li>
<li>
What do you wish you would have known beforehand, or done differently, to make things go easier?
</li>
<li>
How do you feel about your body as a whole now? What I guess I mean is, when you look in the mirror, how has having a vagina changed your body image?
</li>
</ul>

I rented an AirBnB in the city where my surgery was done. I stayed there for four weeks. My girlfriend was with me as my support person :). I would have no chance of doing anything by myself.
</li>
<li>
Honestly I felt my recovery was super smooth and there were no issues that could have been made easier by preparation.
</li>
<li>
My body is awesome!! That&#39;s how I feel haha. I look in the mirror and I just see myself. There are no nagging thoughts of things I wish were different. I get to finally forget about being trans :)

Thanks so much! &lt;3 I still have to figure out the support person stuff, no supportive parents or a partner. How awkward would it be to have a platonic friend there for it? And do you think it would have been feasible to hire a home nurse instead?

If you have a close friend it will be alright! They&#39;ll have to be okay with washing your body for you bc bending down will be mostly impossible for a few weeks. That&#39;s as much as it has to be. Dilation and stuff can be in private.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never thought about a home nurse, if they can also do things like make food and stuff it might work.

Bunch of people lose depth after ppt.  Don&#39;t feel bad about it.  It is relatively new technique people are excited about without no long term studies.

This is exactly the post topic i want to publish. Those, who had a full depth ppt lose it a lot.i already talked to more then 5 girls here with same problem. Also it&#39;s very tight … too tight for piv sometimes.

She Also went with doctor kamol same as me. kamol only perfoms combined method but never a full depth ppt. So igot combined, too. 9cm is skin and 5-6 is peritoneal flap. It works better then full ppt in terms of depth. So i wonder why she got this problem. Btw, how did you know that?

Not with my vagina! Lube is needed every time. The self-lubrication is nice but it&#39;s not enough for PIV.

That’s so great to hear ! Are you feeling more the ‘You’ … feeling of becoming unto yourself … glad to hear the procedure is a success and best wishes for the revision to tidy up the last details … do u have to pay extra for the revision procedure as well just curious

Oh so much of that feeling. My body is finally mine, exactly how I want it to be. &#34;This is who you are&#34; type feelings. It&#39;s wonderful :)
</p>
<p>
The revision procedure will try to go through insurance but that&#39;s still pending. If it can&#39;t be covered, I&#39;ll have to decide if I&#39;m still getting it once I know how much the out of pocket will be.

The immediate post op was very different than what it is now. It was much more swollen early on, the swelling was all gone after three months. So by then it was in its final form.

My daughter had the partial Peritoneal pull thru with doctor Jun. with the partial is it less likely to tighten up over time? She only uses the purple dilator, it’s been a month post-op. She is very tight and dilation is always painful. Perhaps she an aggressive healer as well. I wonder if gradually going up on the dilators will Help. Also discharge constantly forever? Is that specific to the full Peritoneal canal? Thanks!

I&#39;m not sure about the long term expectations of each method. There still aren&#39;t any long-term studies on the normal peritoneal pull-through method. My specific result doesn&#39;t speak for the entire population.
</p>
<p>
I do recommend going up on the dilator size slowly. Your surgeon will have a specific guide, but the general method is use the smallest dilator first in each session, getting to max depth and holding it there. Then at the end of the session going up in size and going as far in as it can go. Over time it will go further and further in until it reaches the same max depth as the smaller one.
</p>
<p>
My dilation is also very painful, and I haven&#39;t been able to get past the small orange one even after one year.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m guessing the discharge will be less with a partial peritoneal lining.

It would be better to see the original surgeon, but it’s not always feasible.
</p>
<p>
He has also talked about using a testosterone cream to help with difficult dilation. I don’t recall the details, but I think it’s this one

Thanks for being open to an AMA. I&#39;ll let it loose, I&#39;m new to this community and have been searching for these answers for a long time.
</p>
<p>
Surgical Stuff:
<br>
1. Did you choose a certain &#34;look&#34; to you new parts, or did you just let the surgeon do their work?
<br>
2. Did you take other procedures at the same time?
<br>
3. Do you know the cause of the discharges you&#39;re experiencing?
<br>
4. Do you have any specific regrets during your planning or recovery phase you wished you&#39;d done differently?
<br>
5. How/why did you choose for the robot-assisted peritoneal pull-through technique? From my own casual research with other women, it seems like there is a higher proportion of positive results.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Sexual Stuff:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What was the evolution of your sexual experience post-op?
</li>
<li>
Where are the new areas of sensation? External, internal?
</li>
<li>
Where are the areas that feel the best with masturbation?
</li>
<li>
Do you mechanically feel orgasms the same way you did before, (ie. AMAB style ejaculation) or differently? This is hard for me to grasp.
</li>
<li>
What is the cleaning like before/after sex?  Is there other mechanical prep-work?
</li>
<li>
Is lubrication super necessary for pleasure on both ends?
</li>
<li>
Are the physical sensations greater, less or the same as pre-op, not accounting for the aspect of the sexual experience that is mentally fulfilled.
</li>
</ol>

You&#39;re very welcome! It&#39;s fun to answer questions and share my experiences :)
</p>
<p>
Surgical answers:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I influenced the final look! I didn&#39;t have a &#34;create-your-vulva&#34; session, but I did ask for my inner labia to be as large as possible. And my surgeon delivered!
</li>
<li>
Just the vaginoplasty, vulvoplasty, penectomy and scrotectomy. So, standard bottom surgery only. No breast augments, no face or voice changes, etc.
</li>
<li>
The peritoneal lining is a mucosal membrane, so it&#39;s constantly producing fluid. It unfortunately isn&#39;t regulated like a natal vagina is, it is always &#34;wet&#34; and making fluid.
</li>
<li>
No regrets about surgery or recovery! My one regret is that I got pretty grumpy towards my partner with all the pain. I wish I controlled it better.
</li>
<li>
I chose peritoneal pull-through for two reasons - I wanted a mucosal membrane for my vagina, and I wanted extra material to make the vulva. Because none of my penile skin was used for the vagina, it all got used on the vulva to make my inner labia.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Sexual answers:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
An open-ended question for sure! I&#39;ll answer it in two parts. One for physical sensations and one for the mental experience. For the first three months, I was forbidden from trying anything sexual. No masturbation, not even purposefully trying to become horny because it would worsen the swelling and cause pain.
<br>
1a. Once I could finally try, it started out mostly numb. My first sexual encounter after surgery was my girlfriend eating me out on the train ride back from my three-month check-in. I experienced very little sensation, although it was still amazing. I finally started feeling substantial stimulation at 6 months. This included both clitoral and penetrative sensations. I could start using vibrators, and fingering myself. Penetrative sex felt good, the sensations came from the muscle around my vagina. That was super fun! I had my first small orgasms around this time. At 9 months, my orgasms finally came in full and I had the body-shaking climaxes I was hoping for. After that, it&#39;s still slowly been getting stronger and it&#39;s soo fun.
<br>
1b. I always wanted to be submissive, but I never achieved the full potential of that headspace until I finished my surgery and had PIV sex for the first time. Feeling my lover inside me in the missionary position was so fulfilling to me, I cried the first few times. To me it was the full experience of what I wanted out of being woman finally in my hands. My overall sexual demeanor changed to fully embrace that feeling. I became more forward with my sexual requests, and whenever I felt horny it was so much more intense than it&#39;s ever been. I love it and I&#39;ll never go back!
</li>
<li>
Clitoris, clitoral hood, labia for direct sensation. Vaginal canal for sensation from adjacent muscle.
</li>
<li>
Definitely the clit and the hood. My whole vulva swells up when I&#39;m aroused, and it makes a perfect bundle of flesh at the top to stimulate with my fingers or a vibrator.
</li>
<li>
It&#39;s slightly different but it has the same base. I feel a build-up of tension, increased sensation, and a drive to &#34;keep going&#34; with whatever I&#39;m doing. During climax, I do feel the same feeling of parts of my body &#34;collecting&#34; all of my sexual energy into one place, but instead of my penis it&#39;s my clit and my vaginal canal. It&#39;s mostly the vagina that gets all of it. I have the same muscle contractions that one has when ejaculating, through the muscles around my vagina. It &#34;twitches&#34; for a bit just like my penis did.
</li>
<li>
Before any sex, I shower. If it&#39;s penetrative, sometimes I will prep with a smaller dildo first to ensure everything is loose and stretched out. After sex, I&#39;ll either clean up with a towel or shower depending on how messy it got.
</li>
<li>
Yes. I use lube for penetrative sex every time. Oral is the only exception, that one doesn&#39;t need lube and it usually doesn&#39;t taste great for the tongue.
</li>
<li>
The sensations are greater overall! My climax is in an absolute sense less sensate than my climax before, but it lasts longer and the before/after are more sensate so overall it&#39;s a win.
</li>
</ol>

thank you! I&#39;m a few weeks postop so it&#39;s wonderful to read about the nice things i get to look forward to. my daily life is consumed by dilation, discharge, dehiscence 😅
</p>
<p>
i really relate to what you say about submissiveness; it&#39;s always been a big part of my own feminine expression.

Did your insurance Cover it.

<p>
I&#39;m hoping to get it done because its the only one that sounds good to me because I would rather not have them take a chunk of my skin lol Plus with the fact that it is the closest to a natal vagina is an extra plus

The amount of discharge is quite a lot yes. But the smell is not any more intense than a natal vagina. It does smell more due to the increased discharge, but that will happen to any vagina that discharges a lot. The specific smell I have also isn&#39;t bad, and it changes over time due to new seasons or new diets.

That’s interesting and thank you for being so open about this and everything. I’m scheduled for robot assisted peritoneal vaginoplasty in October 2024 at Crane Center. It’s not full pull through where I’m going but they form part of the canal with the peritoneal tissue.
</p>
<p>
Do they know if the amount of your discharge is expected for your procedure?
</p>
<p>
Congrats on your procedure so amazing to think of people living with their body 🤗 And awesome about the orgasms!

I’ve been considering ppt for some time now. I’ve seen some pictures of it, and I’m worried that even one year post op I’ll have too much scarring for my liking. Do you still have scars from it, or has it healed enough to look normal?

When my hair is grown out around my vulva, the scars are not noticeable. If I shave, it&#39;s definitely still noticeable. The scars are faded and not bright, but its still obvious. However, the location is right in the crease between the leg and the labia majora so it is rarely visible unless my legs are fully spread. From behind or while standing they do not surface and aren&#39;t noticed. Hope this helps!

Could you say a little more about how it affects you? Or how you judged the pros and cons? Is it just like, k I gotta wear a pad every day but it&#39;s not a big deal?

Sure!
</p>
<p>
Pros: * I don&#39;t have to worry about dryness causing problems like irritation / inflammation. * I can enjoy less intense sex acts without any lube. Things like fingering or using a vibe. * It feels nice, everything down there slides around &amp; if I&#39;m aroused I can feel changes and more natural lubrication.
</p>
<p>
Cons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have to wear a pad or go fully commando. I didn&#39;t find out at first, but if I just wear a skirt and nothing else it keeps itself in check so that&#39;s perfect for around my home.
</li>
<li>
It has a strong smell due to the moisture. It&#39;s not a bad smell but it does smell &amp; often intensely. Not noticeable by anyone when wearing clothes but enough for myself &amp; my partner to notice.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Overall it doesn&#39;t affect my daily life much. I bought some reusable pads &amp; they just go on whenever I put on my underwear. I shower a bit more than I might otherwise. And that&#39;s it!

Thank you!! Your answers to the other comments are already very helpful, but I was wondering if you could speak about how you made the decision to go with Dr. Wittenberg? Did you go to consults with other surgeons? I’m frankly a little concerned about major complications such as fistula because their rate seems a bit higher than the other top surgeons

I knew I wanted the newest Peritoneal Pull-Through technique so I researched and compiled a list of all the surgeons in the US that offered it. I looked at each one&#39;s reviews and pricing and location and I set up appointments with each one, ordered by my initial preference. Wittenberg was my 2nd appointment and I liked her so much I just went with her and didn&#39;t keep my appointments with the remaining ones.
</p>
<p>
I did ask her about complication rate and I was ok with the increased risk as she had a lot of other positives that were better than the other options.

I see! Can I ask what are the most important things that made you decide to go with her?

Location. She was the 2nd closest to my residence.
</li>
<li>
Cosmetic outcome. The vulva she makes looked really good to me at the time. (Mine also looks great now).
</li>
<li>
Waiting time. I had to wait only six months.
</li>
<li>
She was a lot more forward in explaining the whole procedure and the details and satisfying my curiosity.

Did you have to lose any weight prior to surgery?

Nope! I weighed at ~180lbs. I&#39;m not sure if there is a maximum, it wasn&#39;t brought up at all.
