Back again with another update. Checkout my previous post to get updated on where I started!

In the time I was gone, the healing process was a lil bumpy at times but was pretty straight forward. The pain was completely gone around month 3-4, I had used heating pads during some of the worst pains but nothing I couldnt handle. Overall it sucked but I had planned for that and the end result was worth it.
</p>
<p>
Results. Results are... Amazing. It looks feminine, it feels feminine, it is feminine... Gosh I am happy to be alive, They just speak for themselves.

All taken July 6, 2022. So yeah, it looks gorgeous to me at least. Give it about a year or so and those scars will fade away and blend in.
</p>
<p>
When you make your appointment, dont brush off the pelvic floor therapist I happened to get delayed entry so hop on it ASAP and I mean it, the wait times are long. Why goto the pf therapist? They give you stretches to be more limber and stretch out all the areas inside and out to feel more natural. Hamstrings, lowerback flexing and rotation. Pelvic floor stuff to strengthin your ability to relax etc etc. She also can stretch the scar tissue on the vagina. She does work on the two V scars as well as I believe the labia or just vaginal hole. V scars are quite nice for aestetics, it makes the skin over and part of the scars be more wrinkly, which makes it not stand out and bulge so much. Quite nice for aestetics. Internally, not sure what the stretching on the inner bits do, maybe make the labia more labia like and not so tight? Who knows but still worth a shot.
</p>
<p>
Another great thing is Orgasms! Yes, I was quite scared going in about loosing that but I managed to do it pretty quickly. I havent had any intercourse yet but with all the fun you have with toys, I&#39;m satisfied for now. Both my clitorus as well as internally work great, I&#39;d say enjoy it if you can! So yeah, I have as much feeling as anyone could get. I have full sensation :)
</p>
<p>
Dilation has gotten easier but still takes about 10-20 minutes to get it at full depth, and I dilate with the last dot on the soul source orange #4 for 30 minutes. I still use a bedpad as I use alot of lube. It feels tight but not painful. You should use the Dilation Diary papers Dr. Roth gives you. It really helps build the habbit of dilation which you should try to never miss. I filled out the whole thing then kinda stopped filling it and that was that.
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
I still flush every 1-2 weeks with lightly soapy water, its whatever. Nothing special, but just to keep clean. I use hypoalergenic liquid dove soap.
</p>
<p>
I do have a sore-ish area where the scar tissue tore around april, as far as I know it is healing fine. It does bleed occasionally, while dilating or any other activity. there is no telling when it will but the frequency has gotten less since that area tore. Dr roth says that it is perfectly normal and will heal as intended. He cant stress dilation enough as he wants it to be stretched each time to build elastic like scar tissue. Small amounts of blood is fine.
</p>
<p>
BE SURE TO USE PETROLEUM JELLY!!! It keeps your skin clean and dry while it repeats the process of trauma from dilation and healing over the day. It is important and I do it twice daily after dilating to be safe.
</p>

Thats that. If I forgot any thing like I know I defenetly will, I will add a edit with timestamps. Please ask questions as it doesnt just help you, it helps everyone who comes after you &lt;3
</p>
<p>
I hope you give Dr. Josh Roth a chance. We need more surgeons doing good trans surgeries and he may be the one for you. I know I certianly love my new vagina!

I&#39;m in Indiana as well so I get super excited every time I see a new result from Dr. Roth. I think k I&#39;m convinced he will be a great choice when I&#39;m ready for SRS in a couple years!

Peeing can be hit or miss, doesnt bother me which. Usually its a spray all over, but if I spread stuff more its a stream. I believe its just my labia in the way causing the spray.
</p>
<p>
As for sitting, I did use a donut pillow for the first few months. It sucked sitting on but it beat sitting on something flat. Current day I can sit perfectly fine and have no issues.

Should I add timeline pictures? Closer to the bottom of my vagina with the part where it connects, where the labia and perineum come together, I did have some skin kinda seperate for a bit after surgery and secondary healing over 4 months fixed it.  You can tell the skin looks more pink and shiny, its very loose scar tissue and looks unnoticible.  The pics do look kinda eh like the ones I posted a few days after surgery, but it gives some potential examples of how it healed.
</p>
<p>
I would say my labia looks alot more shy because of it but other than that Im not bothered by it and it only gets better over time.

He does most types of SRS for all people.
</p>
<p>
MtF he does Orchiectomies and Zero depth, Penile Inversion, Colonoplasty and Peritoneal Pull-Thru vaginoplastys.
<br>
FtM he does Top Surgery and Mullo/Phallo-plasties.
</p>
<p>
Im amazed he covers such broad areas.

Thanks for that information.  What&#39;s the general consensus about him?  I&#39;ve heard mixed stories.  One of my FB has had a rough time with her PPT but I&#39;ve heard other stories with better outcomes.

I have my consult with Dr. Roth in February, and I was wondering if you might be able to answer a few questions?
</p>
<p>
How much of your vanginal lining was he able to make mucosal, i.e.  peritoneal tissue? I&#39;ve seen only a couple diagrams and they show a lot of the lining is still skin, but then some post ppt gals talk like theirs is mucosal all the way up to the opening. Any reports from the trenches, lol?
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to be a trigger, and you may not know - as we&#39;re all different, but, what was your before and after sensation like. For example,  I&#39;m circumcised and the top/most of the glads aren&#39;t super sensitive and since being on hrt, I&#39;ve almost exclusively orgasmed through stimulation of the frenulum area, but videos show that that area gets cut and the internal bits removed. Does whatever he does in constructing the clitoris cause the gland tissue to be come more sensitive/ less kernelized? I&#39;m pretty set on the surgery regardless.
</p>
<p>
Did he only use abdominal peritoneal tissue, or does he also make use of the tunica vaginalis around the testes and scrotal sac?

This may be stupid, but for the uroflow test he has you do, were you able to sit and pee or do the make you stand? (Haven&#39;t stood in almost 2 years and dread the thought of it, lol)

And btw, I&#39;m so happy for you. Your results look so good. And you, a couple others and the staff at Eskenazi&#39;s gender clinic all seem to like Dr Roth and his work. I had FFS with Dr. Vernon through there, and he is absolutely amazing. Having round 2 of ffs in the spring for my forehead.

There’s more on his surgeon in the wiki here, but you must use a web browser to view it. Do not use a reddit app, or you will not see all of it.
