I&#39;m posting this here on this account for posterity because I&#39;m rather deep stealth on the rest of my social media and I think it&#39;s something that people who are hesitating or who are anxious may find comforting.
</p>
<p>
I started transitioning in 2018 after spending 2 years in mandatory conscription trying not to kill myself. I remember very little of my life before transitioning but the moment I most clearly remember is loading my service rifle one night while on base sentry duty, charging it, and placing it in my mouth and resting my finger on the trigger. It&#39;s a moment that sticks with me because it&#39;s a pivotal changing point in my life when I decided that I needed to do this.
</p>
<p>
For the past 4 years I&#39;ve lived a life I&#39;ve never lived before. Most people would probably never be able to imagine what it&#39;s like to live a life like ours, something I realized especially once I started passing well enough to go deep stealth in college. All the things that just come perhaps not easily, but definitely a great deal more naturally for most people - friends, family, love, career opportunities, not being the butt of a bad joke every so often - I quickly learned I wouldn&#39;t get any of those things so easily. Of course, I was prepared for this when I did the calculation in my head in those long minutes deciding whether or not to pull the trigger. But I never realized how heavily all these things weighed on me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m currently sitting in Chet&#39;s new hospital; I had my SRS on the 23rd of May. Up to that day, I was filled with anxieties; even moreso afterwards, because a couple if stitches popped earlynon the 24th that caused me to bleed a lot and had Chet call his anesthesiologist back at 8.30pm to put me under GA a second time do a quick emergency revision (if you can call it that) to fix up whatever burst earlier that day.
</p>
<p>
Throughout my time here in this hospital I have been surrounded by loving friends who I broke my stealth to. I just went through an ordeal as the nurse team removed the vaginal packing that so restricted my movement for the past few days. But more than anything when Sri removed the packing and I got Chet&#39;s trademark Hello Kitty mirror and I finally managed to see what is there now instead of what was there, I don&#39;t know how to describe the feeling that washed over me. Sure, it looks like shit now, slightly mangled and stitched and with the outside having sensation returning slowly to me, but... For the first time in a very long time, I feel at peace. I feel even more at peace than when I tried lorazepam for a short period of time. I&#39;ve been so worried for a long time that this might be the wrong decision, that it would be a botch job, or any other worry that you can think of. As I sit here eating the cold pasta bolognese the team prepared for me to celebrate removing my packing, even though there&#39;s still a long road of recovery to go and I&#39;ll be maintaining this hole for the rest of my life, and having this surgery will not fix every single problem in my life, for I think the first time in my life my shoulders no longer carry that immense weight I&#39;ve been used to for so long.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who are still doubting and anxious, I understand. It&#39;s a massive gamble that you take, it&#39;s a massive expense (for me at least, broke-ass college undergraduate who bankrupted myself to get Chet) it doesn&#39;t fix everything in your life. But, y&#39;know, it&#39;s something. We never truly know the outcome of every single choice we make, but we live regardless. I hope my ramblings help your choice-making a little easier.

I found myself in similar circumstances. Army engineer, Staff Sgt I think is the American equivelant. Found myself a few years back, staring down the barrell of a loaded 762x39. It would be a few years after that I sat up from the side of my girlfriends bed at 2am after failing to satisfy her because my mind was throwing inadequacies. I had an appifiny &#34;I need help. I can&#39;t do this alone anymore&#34;. 2 years with a therapist and I start hrt. I still struggle. I still make mistakes. But I see a goal and I hit milestones. It makes me happy.

Reading this means so much to me, thank you for sharing. I was just about that close to the edge of the abyss. After a trip to the hospital when my attempt to end it all failed, I made a deal with myself…try transitioning, if it didn’t work I could always end it later.
</p>
<p>
Now almost 3 years later after fighting for myself, instead of against myself, I am 2 weeks away from GRS, with FFS scheduled for the end of the year. While I have the whole gambit of emotions running through me right now, I am very much looking forward to the calm you have found.
</p>
<p>
I know that such a big surgery carries quite a bit of risk, but I am willing to take it, to bet on myself. No amount of second guessing or intrusive thinking can take that away now.
</p>
<p>
Growing up I never though I would live to 30. Here I am, past that point and planning on many more decades to come. I am so much healthier and happier than I have ever been, and I even met the love of my life, I plan to marry her when I am recovered enough from the bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
So thank you, for helping me see the other side of my two week wait, I think I am finally ready to meet it head on!

I love how Chet still gives out Hello Kitty mirrors after all these years. I have lots of fond memories of my time there.

The funniest part of last evening was when the nurses couldn&#39;t get the packing out so they called in the expert (who I later found out was the legendary Sri) who put on a goddamn headlamp to go pussy-spelunking. When I was screaming so much from the wild-ass sensation of having wads of gauze yanked out of you for the first time she was like &#34;No scream like that! When have sex with boyfriend you scream like that he run away!&#34; I see why Sri is so beloved by Chet girls hehe

Congratulations!  The best is yet to come. My surgery finally allowed me to accept myself as a woman, like any other. I still strive to be a better person emotionally, but I know that I have the rest of my life ahead of me and I’m grateful that.

This was so beautiful 💕 thank you for sharing this with us. As a girl who is having SRS in September, I still have random moments of doubt and nervousness. Sending you a big hug!

It&#39;s natural to have doubt and be nervous!! Funny thing is, the Thai psych who teleconferenced me to clear me for the procedure said that he believed having mild anxiety is the best mental state because you&#39;re very aware of all the risks and dangers of a decision you make, but not to the extent you don&#39;t know how to make a decision. That you&#39;re having doubts and nervousness is natural and good, but (for you, I hope) nothing will compare to how you feel when you pull through everything. Fight on! 💞

Ah yes, Calm. I completely get that. You expect it to be a more dramatic feeling. After such a build up and such strife. Huh. Yeah, this is correct.  ☺️ I&#39;m 2 months post op, and it&#39;s still healing and sore but feels much more normal than what I had before.

On the 22nd of June! I made sure my recovery here is a full month cos when I get home I really have to start looking for jobs and the most likely position I&#39;m aiming for is quite intensive time-wise so I figured a full month of recovery before leaving would give me alot of peace of mind when I returned.
