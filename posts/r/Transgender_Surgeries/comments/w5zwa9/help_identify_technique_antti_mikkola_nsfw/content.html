Hello. I appear to have misinformed last time, can someone help me identify what technique was used on me? I really don&#39;t know where to research and if it&#39;s a simple search, perhaps I shouldn&#39;t upload anything at all. So far it&#39;s penile inversion, not thai method as claimed? The pics here shows it&#39;s 5 months post OP.
</p>
<p>
At least I have sensitivity in clitoris area, so he promised this much. Some pointed out it appears to be penile inversion, not SRS, yet I see places mentioning such or just merely misunderstood.
</p>
<p>
I personally feel rather betrayed by the Swedish healthcare, but at least I should correctly just get the right info done for folks having difficulty finding info like I did. My main  objective was to get rid of the penis and testicles anyway and hopefully I&#39;m fortunate to get anything fixed in the future to some extent, there&#39;s some skin hanging about. I will have to see what options I&#39;ve lost and what can be fixed, money is something I won&#39;t be able to fix anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
As for results? I wish Swedish healthcare just show other peoples results than just hiding them, surely there are other patients wanting to show their results, but they insist so much on not showing, geez. Am I happy with the results? Not fully, but I am happy to wear clothing and I get to keep some sensitivity at least. Just a bit boring that much won&#39;t be felt on the inside, all such things they reveal afterwards for some reason. Welp, not much to be done about it at this point. The red spot will be looked at, as it feels being pulled from the inside.
</p>
<p>
To reach this doctor, you need to go through Swedish transcare system, likely with Swedish citizenship. No, information is scarce and there are almost no direct pages to direct you to the responsible doctor.
</p>
<p>
Just drop comments below and share your thoughts, just so we can solve this. Hopefully people can google this thread up when other people seeks information about this doctor.
</p>
<p>
This post will be updated with time. I wonder if I should share some information from 1177, hiding my person number and name, of course.

Thank you for the reply, I&#39;ve re-added the first post in a link, I just want things to be cleared up somehow. Regardless, people googling after Antti Mikkola will at least get to see pictures, that&#39;s the important part, so they get an idea of what they&#39;re getting themselves into.

I don&#39;t know Antti (or maybe I do, maybe it was with him that I had a consultation years ago), but I had SRS in Sweden (I decided to go to Link√∂ping, with Gunnar Kratz).
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a couple of things that may need to be clarified. You say some say you got penile inversion, not SRS. Penile inversion is one of several techniques for SRS. SRS is just making an innie out of an outie or viceversa.
</p>
<p>
Penile inversion is either the only method or at least the most common method for MtF SRS in Sweden, and when I had that consultation at Karolinska, Antti or whoever the surgeon I met was, told me that is the method they do there. It was a few years ago, so maybe they are doing some other method now, I don&#39;t know.
</p>
<p>
But to know for sure what kind of surgery was done on you, you have the information on your journal at
<a href="https://1177.se">1177.se
</a>
. Log in there and you will have access to all your medical records (at least since you changed your personnummer). There would be notes from your surgeon describing (in quite a bit of detail) the procedure that was done.

Oh gosh, everything is in Swedish and I got to translate all that together with anatomical words? Yikes, that will be really tricky to show people what that really means. Maybe when I have time, I&#39;ll reply with original text somewhere in the previous thread and translate from there.

If I had to guess, I would say it looks like penile inversion, but it would be best to ask your surgeon what type of tissue was used to line the vaginal canal. There may have been a scrotal graft involved, but usually penile inversion with a scrotal graft is still called a penile inversion (most PI surgeons incorporate a scrotal graft where needed).
</p>
<p>
I agree with HiddenStill, there really is no one &#34;Thai method&#34;, although usually what people mean when they say it is a vaginal canal constructed entirely with scrotal or groin skin grafts, with no inversion of penile skin. This is what I had done with Dr. Bank, but again individual surgeons use different techniques for constructing the vulva and vagina. Many Thai surgeons use elements of penile inversion as well.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry you aren&#39;t happy with your results, and I hope a revision can address any issues you&#39;re having! If it makes you feel better, I went to a Thai surgeon, and while I&#39;m happy with my results, I&#39;m potentially planning on having a revision as well to improve them.

Replying here to your reply to my comment, because I only see it if I go to your profile, it&#39;s not visible here (maybe because you don&#39;t have enough karma? I don&#39;t know).
</p>
<p>
If you feel comfortable with it, you can paste the Swedish text here, I can help you translate and parse it.
