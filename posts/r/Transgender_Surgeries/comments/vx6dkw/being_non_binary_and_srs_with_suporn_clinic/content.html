Nice thank you. That makes me anxious cause I’m so used to present fully as a women to be validate by the medical field

I&#39;m NB, and I&#39;m in Chon Buri right now for surgery.  I was very upfront with the clinic that I&#39;m NB.  The clinic advised me via email that I present feminine while here in order to either not upset the other girls or make sure the staff psychologist signs off on the surgery (the reason varied based on who was telling me).  I&#39;m complying (I don&#39;t mind dressing up and wearing makeup even though I&#39;m more comfortable otherwise), but the other girls and western staff think it&#39;s a silly requirement.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d recommend being upfront about being NB.  Hormones are not required if they aren&#39;t a part of your personal journey nor is a year of living as a woman (per WPATH), and since the clinic follows WPATH, they should accept you.

Thanks!  Having talked with Dr. Bank about it yesterday, it seems like the biggest issue is the hospital psychiatrist and the culture here.  Dr. Bank said that NB is very new in Thailand, and it seems like many people don&#39;t understand it.  The culture is pretty conservative, and it is very binary.  I mean, it&#39;s really new in the US - I hadn&#39;t even heard of it until a few years ago, at which point I could finally say, &#34;ah, that&#39;s what I am!&#34;
</p>
<p>
I just had my interview with the hospital psychiatrist, and he had a few questions for me about being nonbinary that either indicated that he was curious about this new thing or that he was testing what I thought I was, though it felt like this was something new to him.  Dr. Bank advised that I appear very feminine for him, which I tried (insofar as one can &#34;dress up&#34; in scrubs).  I maybe should have just pretended to have lived for a year as a woman and that I was on hormones, but I was honest (which led to more questions).  He did sign the paper, which is all that matters.

Final thoughts:  I was concerned that I was going to have to pass as a woman when I came here, and that gave me a lot of anxiety leading up to the trip.  This ended up being a nonissue.
</p>
<p>
No one cares about hair length.  I was concerned that I would have to wear a wig, so I tried to grow my hair out for the last 6 months (with a high undercut, which maybe gave me 4-6&#34; of total length), but there are one or two girls here with shorter hair than mine.  I saw a photo of one girl who was heading to Thailand for surgery with a shaved head.
</p>
<p>
Re: makeup, I lased my facial hair for 6 months, but it still shows in the goatee area.  It doesn&#39;t matter because everyone is wearing masks all the time in Thailand.  The only makeup I&#39;m wearing is eyeliner.
</p>
<p>
I tried voice coaching because I was concerned they would reject me because I have a guy voice, but during the first session my coach told me that my voice is pretty nonbinary as it is, so I don&#39;t adjust my voice much, and no one has commented.
</p>
<p>
My passport photo is 25 lbs heavier with a full beard, and that hasn&#39;t been an issue at all either.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend using a name that&#39;s at least somewhat androgynous.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d say to be conscious of presenting in a feminized manner, but that doesn&#39;t mean that you have to pass.
