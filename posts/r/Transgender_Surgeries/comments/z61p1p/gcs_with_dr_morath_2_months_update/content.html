Hi all! As promised, an update on how things have been going on since coming back home and now that I&#39;m about to hit the two months after surgery.
</p>
<p>
Coming back home was lovely although quite intimidating at first. I had to take a flight back just barely two weeks out of surgery but in the end all went surprisingly well. It was really tiring and arrived home exhausted but I found that I could handle myself pretty well with the donut cushion and someone to keep me company and distract me. The couple of painkillers that I took for the way back home also helped, although I didn&#39;t need any afterwards and haven&#39;t taken them ever since. As I said elsewhere, the last couple of days at the hospital were rather good and I even made a friend who I&#39;ll see again in December (we planned our follow-ups together!).
</p>
<p>
The first few days back were calm and slow, as I got tired with any level of activity. I have now recovered a big part of my stamina and I believe it&#39;ll be back to pre-surgery levels in a couple of weeks from now. Nevertheless, I was already quite independent in my first few days back and could do groceries and my own meals (I love cooking, so that was a good way to pass the time!). I also had many happy moments with my new parts and could finally buy myself pretty lingerie (had been promising myself this for a while) and enjoy my showers and clothes without needing to take care of hiding that damned bulge. I came back to work three weeks after coming back home and I&#39;m allowed to work from home full time until January 2023. I&#39;ve been working part time since then and slowly built up to full time work, to which I&#39;m coming back next week. It&#39;s nice to be back at work (I really like my job!) and I&#39;ve even managed to go to the office a couple of times. They also set me up a private room where I can do my dilations if necessary.
</p>
<p>
Regarding aftercare, the first two weeks back were rough. Not so much for dilations, which were easy (definitely not comfortable though!) but because of it being so time-consuming in the beginning. I had to clean everything up with antiseptic every time I had to go to the toilet and change dressings a few times every day. That was exhausting and I was really happy to be able to give that up two weeks after being discharged. Other than that, I&#39;ve never had a problems with dilations and they&#39;re less time consuming that I had imagined - I can start it and once the dilator is in I can get distracted with my phone or a book. My vagina is still quite tight (although slowly loosening up) and the insertion of the dilator itself is uncomfortable, but once in it is all fine. I started out using the small dilator and upgraded to using a combination of the small one and the medium one (10 minutes each every session) some two weeks and a half after coming back home. A week ago I completely upgraded to the medium one (I use only that one for the entire session without a problem) and plan to move up to the biggest size some time before my December follow-up with Dr. Morath, all things permitting (if I have any problems with it I want to know so I can discuss it with her!). Discharge is also a lot better now and switched from pads to panty liners two weeks ago. A couple of time now I have had no discharge at all in between dilation sessions.
</p>
<p>
As to aesthetics and sensation, everything is healing well. I had a bit of wound dehiscence in one of my labia minora but it healed in the span of a couple of weeks. Swelling went down significantly by the end of October but it was quite uneven for a while. My swelling was pretty much limited to my labia minora and the one affected by wound dehiscence took a few weeks more to go down. Now, almost all swelling is gone except for a bit of swelling and tightness in the initial part of my labia minora and clitoris, but that is also going down. My labia minora even go around nicely around my introitus despite my initial fear that it would rip off during dilations (the tissue there looked quite fragile!). Pain was never an issue and haven&#39;t needed painkillers since the day I took the flight back home from Munich. It&#39;s still uncomfortable at time, mostly by the end of days in which I&#39;m more active than usual, but it has been completely manageable. Sensation is still quite limited but that doesn&#39;t worry me as I&#39;m quite early in my recovery and I see it taking steps towards the right direction. I&#39;ve been able to orgasm once (quite a nice a unique sensation, even if faint) but I haven&#39;t really been in the mood, which also counts towards it. My sexual hormones turned out to be quite low and I&#39;m temporarily off progesterone, which led to some menopause-like symptoms (mostly headaches, bad sleep and hot flashes), but I have an appointment with my end next week and hopefully I&#39;ll be able to have all that sorted out.
</p>
<p>
The only outstanding (potential) problem is that I have a bit of a &#34;bulbous&#34; around the entrance of my vagina but it doesn&#39;t seem to be big enough to hinder function, but I&#39;ll have to discuss it with Dr. Morath and see if it warrants to go through with the second surgery. Apart form that, I haven&#39;t seen anything that may need revision.
</p>
<p>
Oh! An I also could sort out my knot problem! I wasn&#39;t able to take them out on my own so I had to make a lengthy visit to my hairdresser. A lot of hair had to be cut and I lost quite a bit of length. However, I really like my new haircut and I think I&#39;m going to start wearing it shorter.
</p>
<p>
In any case, this is a broad summary of these two months. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll update again, if I do any further updates. Perhaps after my follow-up appointment in December or by my second surgery, if I need it! Other than that, feel free to ask any questions and I&#39;ll answer in the comments as I go :)

hi, may I ask, how long after the surgery does one have to wait to be able to have sex?

Hi! Sure. I wasnâ€™t given a particular timeline nor did I ask for one in relation to sex as my interest in it tends to be rather minimal. Now, if I had to take a guess, I think I would have been healed enough for sex by month 4 or so after surgery, and possibly by month 2 for gentle touching.
