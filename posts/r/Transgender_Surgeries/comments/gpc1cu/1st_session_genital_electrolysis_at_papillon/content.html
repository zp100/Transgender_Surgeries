Wed: 5/13/20: Expected length of maneuvers for genital electrolysis ‚Äì 6-hours.

</a>
is a link to my 2nd session. Thank you for following my story‚ù£Ô∏èü§ós
</p>
<p>
My intent here is to debrief you concerning my experiences with my first genital electrolysis session at Dr. Christine McGinn‚Äôs Papillon Center located in New Hope, PA. I‚Äôve attempted to inject (no pun intended, well, maybe a little . . .) a little humor in my saga to educate and inform any who follow. Warning: this is a bit lengthy, but I felt detail for the Community education is important.
</p>
<p>
Please, AMA  . . .
</p>
<p>
<strong>
NOTE:
</strong>
<strong>
<em>
COVID-19 Requirement: Wearing a mask at Papillon Center is mandatory! You are required to bring your own mask!
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Arrived in the parking lot for the Center (4 Gazebo Place, New Hope) at 0930 hrs (appointment scheduled for 1000 hrs). As previously instructed, I called and let Lori know I was in the parking lot. She informed me that once Ramona (the esthetician) arrived and was ready, I would get the call to enter the premises. A few minutes before 1000, I got the call to come in. Kissed my wife goodbye (visitors not allowed in the building during the COVID crises) and she left, headed back to the
<a href="http://gaiaguesthouse.com"><strong>
<em>
GAIA Guest House
</em>
</strong>
</a>
(owned and operated by Dr. Christine McGinn for the primary benefit of her patients). I went inside. The facility, as indicated in the week-before phone call, had undergone a top-to-bottom field day and is inspection ready, clean and neat as a pin.
</p>
<p>
Lori greeted me and has a small bit of paperwork to fill out, then directed me back to the treatment room, where I met Ramona. Ramona greeted me, introduced herself and handed me a clipboard with several intake and authorization forms, warnings about possible electrolysis scarring and the side affects of the anesthetic injections. Administrative details out of the way, Ramona and I chit-chatted a couple minutes to get to know one another, then she asked me to step behind a privacy screen, remove all clothing from the waist down, lay down on the treatment table and cover myself with a paper drape. I brought a nice thick pair of comfortable socks to keep my feet warm for the duration and asked if it was okay to wear them. Permission granted, she stepped out and closed the door while I carried out the instructed disrobing maneuvers.
</p>
<p>
Downside: I suspect as a response to the COVID crises that all extra furnishings and stuff were removed from the room to eliminate/reduce cleaning surfaces. There was no chair to lay, or hooks to hang my clothes on.
<em>
This is not a show stopper!
</em>
Following standard military protocol, I improvised, adapted, and overcame the obstacle by removing the requisite clothing, underwear last (and carefully folding/hiding them inside my jeans), then piled neatly on top of my shoes, on the floor. Assumed the supine position on the table and deployed the paper drape.
</p>
<p>
Door opens and in comes Ramona and Kristal (the PA). Kristal is to administer the lidocaine injections. Kristal informs me of the potential side effects and asks for verbal approval to proceed. Now, at this point, I ain‚Äôt gonna lie. All those stories I‚Äôve read here in this sub and researched online about lidocaine injections for electrolysis, particularly genital electrolysis, has me
<strong>
<em>
completely spooked
</em>
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
Hmmm, Kristal has her back turned to me, trying to keep me from seeing the syringe/needle while she loads it and answers my questions.
</p>
<p>
¬∑ Q: Is the lidocaine buffered?
</p>
<p>
¬∑ Ans: No. They found out that the injections are not as effective if they are buffered, so they do not do that anymore. Great, I think. This is really gonna suck. Bigtime . . . (Kristal seems being secretive . . .)
</p>
<p>
¬∑ Q: Do lidocaine injections hurt?
</p>
<p>
¬∑ Ans: YMMV, but yes, for a few minutes until the anesthetic takes effect. (Just what I needed to hear.
<strong>
<em>
By now, I‚Äôm wishing I hadn‚Äôt read those stories about it feeling like being injected with HOT LAVA . . .
</em>
</strong>
)
</p>
<p>
Hmmm, Kristal is
<em>
really
</em>
being secretive in her movements . . . I get a glimpse of the syringe.
<strong>
<em>
HOLY S\
</em>
*T
</strong>
<em>
, the damned thing has a barrel that looks big-around as the size of a standard military *
</em>
<em>
MK V signal flare
</em>
<strong>
, ***AND THE FREAKING NEEDLE IS At LEAST 8‚Äù LONG!!!!
</strong>
*
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
Timeout:
</em>
</strong>
Now, in any successful marriage, there has to be an Admiral and someone‚Äôs a Chief of Staff. This morning, the Admiral and I had a conversation about not being a Drama Queen. With this in mind, I tell Kristal I‚Äôm ready and don‚Äôt look . . .
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
It didn‚Äôt hurt.
</em>
</strong>
Other than a couple small stings when she injected the perineum,
<strong>
<em>
it didn‚Äôt hurt!
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
Okay, back to the debrief . . .
</em>
</strong>
Ramona is super cool and knows her business. Easy to talk with and I sensed her passion for helping people in the community in their journey to living their Truth. When visiting the necessity was needed on my part, we took a short break, took care of business, and went right back at it.
<em>
**(
</em>
<em>
Edit
</em>
* Urinating via a completely numb appendage is/was a whole new experience!)*** She works diligently with no fooling around. Toward the end of the session, she asked me to assume a laying down yoga Tree Pose with my right leg so she could work on the perineum area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
I ain‚Äôt gonna lie.
</em>
</strong>
The injections began to wear off about the 4.5 hour mark in the session. Kristal had left the premises for the day and no further injections were available. For the next 1.5 hours, my discomfort grew exponentially, and Ramona kept apologizing and asking if I wanted to stop. I asked
<em>
her
</em>
to stop apologizing. I let her know that I would roll with her, just do what she needed to do. The last 45 minutes were rough, to the point of involuntary muscle spasms every time Ramona hit the switch, three times for each follicle. I began apologizing to Ramona because I was having trouble laying still when feeling the jolt of electricity and was afraid, I was messing her up. She kept telling me no, she was good. We stopped at the 6-hour mark.
</p>
<p>
Ramona cleaned the areas where she worked and applied a salve to keep things moist. She advised me to use Witch Hazel for cleaning the areas and Neosporin to help healing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
Lessons Learned:
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
¬∑ Super hydrating with water before the session is a must.
</em>
</strong>
It makes the hair follicles easier to work with and increases the potential for successfully clearing the follicles. I did hydrate and my recovery went much quicker as a result.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
¬∑ Exfoliate the area prior to the session.
</em>
</strong>
This allows easier finding the follicle opening and inserting the probe into the follicle.
</p>
<p>
¬∑ I bought Witch Hazel wipes and Pain/Itch/Scar Neosporin. I used these products for one week after treatment. As of today, approximately 90% of the scabs are gone and the skin is well healed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
¬∑
</em>
</strong>
<strong>
<em>
Papillon Center Staff are a super caring group of people to work with.
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
¬∑ Yesterday, I received an email from the Center with a detailed receipt attached. The receipt is ‚Äúinsurance ready‚Äù with all required medical information to submit to my insurance for reimbursement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
¬∑ Staying at GAIA Guest House is the best deal going for Dr. McG‚Äôs patients.
</em>
</strong>
If you are going to receive treatment at the Center and need a place to stay overnight, make sure you call the Host/Caretaker, Bill, and discuss a stay with him. It just so happened that we were the first guests to stay since the COVID shutdown, and we had the place to ourselves. The place is historic, super nice, comfortable, and breakfast is included.
</p>
<p>
We will be staying there overnight for my next three appointments.
</p>
<p>
<em>
I wish you all Peace and Kindness!

Update: 6/2/2020 - Had my second appointment yesterday. Kristal, once again provided the injections. For reasons medically related as a very young teenager, I‚Äôm extremely sensitive about receiving injections. I‚Äôm expecting this to hurt. Truth is (and again ymmv) I did feel the slight sting/stick of the needle with each injection and other than momentary discomfort, I did not feel pain from the lidocaine medication.

Thank you for the kind compliment. Please see my response below. I actually wrote my reply as soon as I read your question, but it was late night and I fell asleep before hitting the REPLY. I woke up sometime later and when I tapped the icon, the order of answers became scrambled. Lesson learned, don‚Äôt try to answer inquiries late at night . . . ü§ós

<p>
Buffering works just fine. I&#39;ve had it multiple times with and without, and its a standard technique.
</p>

<p>
That&#39;s a long time for lidocaine. Assuming there&#39;s some truth to buffering not being as effective, I can only imagine it refers to the length of time it works, and they want to reduce the number of times they have to do it.

I went back and looked at some notes I made just after the session and remembered the lidocaine began wearing down in a couple areas at about the 2.5 hr mark. At that point, it was not uncomfortable at all, simply that I felt something when Ramona applied the treatment. Up to that point, and for quite a while after, I didn‚Äôt even feel her touching me in the area as she worked.
</p>
<p>
I will share that urinating while completely numb was a very unique experience!

Do you know any more about it? Did it have adrenaline/ephedrine, and what concentration?
</p>
<p>
The one thing that bothers me about your experience is the staff going home early. If I were to travel for electrolysis I‚Äôd be very upset about that.

: 6/1/2020: Headed home after a 4-hr session today. I specifically asked your questions: Compound: Lidocaine and 1% ephedrine. The ephedrine acts as a constrictor to keep the lidocaine where/in the area it is injected, which adds effective working time to the anesthetic.
</p>
<p>
Needle: Spinal 25ga.
</p>
<p>
I wasn‚Äôt kidding about the size of the syringe barrel.
</p>
<p>
Received a second set of injections in the perineum to allow Ramona to work down to the anus area.

Couldn‚Äôt look the first couple sessions bc the PA lowered the head of the table. I was told it allowed better access to the genital area to administer the injections. (Although that may be true, I think the real reason was to prevent me from seeing what was going to happen and possibly freaking out, not that I would but I‚Äôm sure plenty before me have).
</p>
<p>
Have to admit, it‚Äôs pretty damned disconcerting to see someone coming at your genitals with a rig like that. Bc I behaved and didn‚Äôt move or make a fuss, the head of the table wasn‚Äôt lowered during my last three sessions and particularly on the last session I was able to see some of the process.
</p>
<p>
The PA is extremely skilled and kept the number of punctures down bc she maneuvered the needle where she needed it to go in close areas through a single stick. She actually only re-injected when she needed to move to a new area. She took full advantage of the needle flexibility. Dr. Christine McGinn walked in on my next-to-last session and watched and joked while the PA performed the injections. Good times‚ù£Ô∏è

I don‚Äôt know about the compounding of the anesthetic, now that you ask. I did not have that kind of information in the background to inquire. My next appointment is in a week and I will ask and report back.
</p>
<p>
As to the PA leaving, I did not know she left until the 4.5 hr mark when I asked for additional injections. I remember being disappointed to find out further pain relief was not available at the time, but I know I have to go through this to to get on that GRS surgery cancellation list and damnit, I made up my mind there wouldn‚Äôt be any whining and crying over what has to be done.
</p>
<p>
In reflection because of your comment, I‚Äôm not upset because I didn‚Äôt know? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Before, this whole process at this facility was unknown to me and now I know. Which is the reason I post here, to remove the unknown for others. Thanks to you, I will ask about their anesthesia policy for future reference. Hopefully, by simply reading these comments other women seeking understanding of the same process will know to ask about the anesthesia policy at their facility. So, thank you for saying something‚ù£Ô∏èI do know from the billing, I was not charged for the anesthetic over the whole session. ü§ós

If you live in the area cutting short the injections is a small matter, its easy enough to go again. But what if its an overnight trip or you have to fly to get there. There&#39;s no one who does this injections in Australia, so I&#39;d have to travel a long way to get it done anywhere. Its a bit of an issue for me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d also be interested in knowing what gauge needles they use.

Well Ms.
<a href="/u/HiddenStill" rel="nofollow">u/HiddenStill
</a>
, with these comments and sharing you‚Äôve just crystallized exactly what this sub is for‚ù£Ô∏è The benefit of knowing and understanding for all who come here. In a few words, you provide a window into a whole different aspect of what you face and the obstacles you have to overcome on your journey. I can certainly empathize with your challenges and perspectives. Which, is why I üíï this sub and defend it!
</p>
<p>
I will specifically ask about the gauge of the needle and report back. I recall it was exceedingly thin and appeared flexible. Stand by for further details . . .

You are welcome. Remember, ymmv. I have three 4-hr appointments lined up and I‚Äôm thinking that if my body‚Äôs reaction to the injections are the same this next appointment, then I can stop worrying about them.

Thank you. Actually, yes, I‚Äôve given a great deal of thought to documenting my journey and this post represents a part of the experience. I came to Reddit through a suggestion by my therapist because this forum is somewhat like a group form of help. I‚Äôve learned from many other women here, who willingly shared their experiences. Thanks to them, I‚Äôve found information, support and comfort that helped me find my way forward. Because of what they have done for me, I want to give back to this community in as much detail as possible to help other women who want to know so to figure out their own path.

When you know what is ahead of you, the journey forward can be more clear, and a hellova lot less scary‚ù£Ô∏è ü§ós

If you are getting Electrolysis. I suggest trying it with out injections. It‚Äôs not that bad. I did all my electrolysis sessions without injections or anything. With Dr. McGinns office. You will save $30 an hour that way.

Well Hun, as I stated, YMMV. After experiencing uncontrollable muscle spasms and a pretty good jolt of pain each time the treatment was applied the last 45 minutes of the session, This Girl will take the anesthetic every time. Like I told Ramona and Kristal at the beginning of the session, I wouldn‚Äôt mind pain, if it didn‚Äôt hurt so much!
