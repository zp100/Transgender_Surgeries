These statements contradict each other.  Lots of cis women have a small adams apple.  Was it the combination of your AA and other things as well as your self-confidence?

<p>
You can get a surgery where they go in from the mouth and there is no scar.  Also if they do the cut on a fold in your neck after 18 months it is pretty much invisible unless you are looking for it in many cases.

I’ve heard that the mouth approach is pretty traumatic. They have to detach a lot of skin to get there and the recovery is much harder than just getting an incision under your chin.

I am very curious since I am in the same situation. One doctor said it was such an easy and small procedure and another one really stressed the risk of infection and bad scarring. Also that the skin wouldn’t move as well when one swallow.

There is a risk of adhesion if the incision is made on the AA itself. I would chose a surgeon that does the incision much higher.  The best place in my opinion is in the fold when you look straight in front of you. Even is there is a visible scar, that position means that nobody will ever see it unless they really look carefully while you are looking up. Because it&#39;s close to the vocal.folds, there is a small risk the surgeon will remove too much material and therefore altering your voice, again, a good surgeon knows when to stop and the risk is almost non existent in good hands. As for any surgery, it is important to do research and evaluate the surgeon and their approach before going for it. Hope this helps

I had a huge adams apple so not really the case you are looking for buty scar was also pretty bad, stretched, hypotrophic and a little too low on my neck. but i managed to get this fixed by scar revision surgery. So even if you end up with a badly healed scar that&#39;s nothing which can&#39;t be fixed

I have a huge adams apple. It&#39;s my biggest physical source of dysphoria (aside from the human horn). I was wondering how the results were aside from the scarring. Are you happy with how everything turned out?

Keojampa does scar-less thyroid cartilage reduction through a transoral route. Why don&#39;t you post a picture?

Except that one of his recent patients posted pictures on Real Self of her scar from her surgery with Keojampa.  Directly across the thyroid cartilage!   And really ugly.  Worse,  in the video, it had adhered to the underlying tissue so that every time she spoke or swallowed - - it moved and called attention to the scar.   Why would he have ever done that ?
</p>
<p>
As to trying to do the intra-oral route.  That comes under the heading of  &#34;... just because you can do something . . . does not mean you should do that &#34;something&#34;.    In this case,  putting the scar in the preferred location, well up the neck and under and just behind the chin in the existing natural crease is the optimal location.   The surgeon can maintain a completely sterile &#34;field&#34; for the surgery.  If you try to go in through the mouth then the surgeon has a badly contaminated (with bacteria) surgical field to start with.  In addition,  there are significant risks of injuries to important collateral structures that are not at risk by the sub-mental incision.  There are multiple nerves that often are located in slightly different locations from one patient to another that have to be protected using the mouth as the starting point for the incision.  It is easy to damage or sever one of those by going through the mouth.  The risk is totally unnecessary and avoidable.

I had a scarless trachea shave and I got exactly what I wanted: no scar whatsoever. Recovery was uneventful. Are you saying I was actually at extraordinary risk?

It seems like you&#39;re waging some sort of crusade against Keojampa and his trans-oral route. Every time someone comments about it you leave this same whiny comment. So tell me, I went on his realself page and didn&#39;t find this review you&#39;re talking about. Do you have a link or are you just making it up?
</p>
<p>
Also about the dirty mouth thing, have you heard about the entire field of oral surgery? Or about that other FFS component, the genioplasty? I got 8 teeth and two chunks of my chin removed all through the mouth and never had any issues. This is all very well studied, and the infection risks are low. Also can you name the nerves that supposedly are located behind the thyroid cartilage? If you cannot I will conclude that this is yet another example of fearmongering.

I prefer to let things remain and allow people to make comments on it - like yours for example. Otherwise I&#39;ll end of censoring something I shouldn&#39;t. People can make their own judgements, rather than having mine forced on them. Either way it can go wrong and mistakes will be made, but I think this is the better of the two.
</p>
<p>
Just so long as people stick to the rules and are polite about it.

It&#39;s extremely tiresome to keep correcting the same misinformation from the same person who obviously has a vested interest. It is also in the interest of the people who use this sub to have accurate information, which this user is really detrimental to.

Mine is small enough that I don&#39;t really think about it.  Someone would have to be really studying me for it to out me.  I&#39;m not stealth to anyone I know personally, so it&#39;s not really needed/worth it.  fwiw, I don&#39;t tuck either, though I&#39;m solving that problem in 7 months.

I just had a tracheal shave.  My Adams Apple wasn&#39;t very large, but I did feel self conscious about it, especially when I would tilt my head back or turn my head - then it would be obvious, even if it wasn&#39;t at other times.  Now I can make any motion with my head without worrying about it/feeling dysphoric.
</p>
<p>
Even at 3 weeks out, the incision is fairly small and not very noticeable for me.  It&#39;s under the chin, so no one would see it unless they&#39;re up very close to me and looking under my chin for some reason?

If your looking for reasons not to go ahead it&#39;s worth considering there is a small risk/chance of damage to the pitch and quality of your voice. I really don&#39;t think this happens much but I have read people&#39;s accounts of it.
</p>
<p>
Also, if you ever plan on getting voice surgery it&#39;s not recommended to get a tracheal shave in advance of that and best to have them at the same time. I&#39;d have to dig out my VFS surgeon&#39;s letter if you want the specifics.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t bother with a trachea shave in the end as mine is really tiny and smaller than some of the afters I&#39;ve seen in results photos.

I&#39;m planning on pursuing a trachea shave next year. I&#39;d trade a scar for a noticeable Adam&#39;s apple in a heart beat. I&#39;ve hated it since puberty. While my face isn&#39;t totally passable as female, my small size helps me pass. But this birth defect on my throat I&#39;m sure gets me clocked.

My AA was pretty unnoticeable and usually too high in my throat to be seen. I was getting the works of FFS, covered by insurance, so I figured it couldn’t hurt.
</p>
<p>
I’m still wondering if there’s a big difference from before. I can still see something there if I move it, but I think it is (and was) in female range.
</p>
<p>
The scar isn’t so bad. It’s still a little pink after 7 months (I’m white) but it’s in a spot my mask covers. If you do go through with your shave, be sure to keep the sun off of it for the scar to blend back in.
