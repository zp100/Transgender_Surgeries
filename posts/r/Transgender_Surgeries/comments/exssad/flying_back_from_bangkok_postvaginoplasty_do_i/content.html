Dunno if you&#39;re aware of this but toilets to some degree shotgun microscopic particles out upon flushing. I wouldn&#39;t personally trust a bathroom. But it worked for you, and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe.

I suspect it&#39;s the sort of thing that sounds like a good idea before surgery, but is inadvisable unless the hotel is airside and the layover is already long enough to warrant it. Clearing immigration twice, checking in, doing all the prep, and checking out while partially mobile and in danger of missing your flight sounds much scarier and prone to mishaps than taking an extra painkiller and spending another hour getting to depth at home. I&#39;ve had much worse dilations than the one after returning.

The layover is 19 hours and spans the course of a night, so it would probably be a necessity. I may look at re-booking on a flight with a shorter layover...

So I did something similar to what you&#39;re doing when I flew back from Thailand, except I landed in Texas from Tokyo and then that&#39;s where I got a hotel.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s something to do with planes, but you will not hit your full depth that first dilation session off the plane, don&#39;t worry about it just get close. Then you&#39;ll dilate again in the morning get on another plane and fly home, then it might take you a few days to get back to your full depth, don&#39;t sweat it.

A day without dialation will be no big deal, even this early on. it will be a little tight your first one afterwards but other than that there will be no lasting effects, as long as you dont make a habbit of it.
</p>
<p>
I had a long travel/drive day and it was at least 20 hours between mine with no issues, that was at 2 weeks post op.
</p>
<p>
i did 36 hours at 6 weeks when i had to make the trip back to my surgeon. Also had no issues. Little snug the first one back, but got right back into it.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t fret too much about this one, you will be fine, people travel after this surgery all the time, and if skipping a dilation or two was a major issue it would be talked about more.

If you can afford it book a sleeper bed. A number of girls were able to dilate whist flying with the extra room and a blanket.

Can you afford business/first class tickets? I flew home business and had the privacy to be able to dilate comfortably

I had same question for myself about making a connection in Dubai. I decided to make a stop in Dubai for 3 nights, had a chance to explore city.
</p>
<p>
Also I was ordering a wheelchair in airports for first weeks because it was too painful for me to stand/walk. A wheelchair is provided for free by your airline, just call them a day or two in advance. They give a wheelchair and an attendant at checkin desk and move you straight to gates. So there is no need to stand in lines at passport controls and security check. Was super useful for me

I&#39;d never travel through the middle-east especally after surgery. You may be carrying drugs which are illegal there and they are not known for being forgiving.

My surgeon (Burin) advised me not to dialate the day of departure until the day after I got home.  48 hours in total.  I was fine.  Also be sure to book business class.  You’ll thank me for the adjustable seat.

I flew from Bangkok for layover in Dubai for 8 hours then to Europe home. Dr kamol said it was ok for me to skip dilation until I got home. I was flying home only 13 days after surgery.

If you can&#39;t go two days without dilating then your problems are more extensive than any dilating can help. This thread is kind of creating an issue that&#39;s nonexistent.

Sorry, I don&#39;t mean to create an issue where there isn&#39;t one. I know that dilations can be painful if you wait longer between dilations. I had the option to book a quick flight back with no time for dilation or a longer trip with an overnight stay that would allow for dilation. I know that I could
<em>
survive
</em>
either way, but I&#39;m trying to avoid as much pain as possible in the process.
</p>
<p>
Of course, I&#39;ve never had a vaginoplasty so maybe it&#39;s not as painful as I&#39;ve made it out to be in my head!! Thank you for your reply.

You should be staying long enough for any unforseen issues to be evident and present themselves. I stayed three weeks. I did not want to make an unscheduled return trip. My hotel was 30 dollars a a day. If you do that, you should be able to get home without dilating and settled in with no issue. Good luck, hon. It really isn&#39;t nearly as bad as you might imagine.

Your right. In my last visit with the doctor I asked him. He said I&#39;d be fine until I was home. Its common since to ask before you leave to find out your situation.
