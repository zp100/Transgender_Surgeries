</p>
<p>
Prices are currently out of date. I paid $10,500 USD for &#34;Cosmetic SRS&#34;. I also had about $10,000 worth of plastic surgery on my face at the same time (Rhinoplasty, neck lift, face lift, lip lift, buccal pad removal but no brow shave and no jaw reduction).
</p>
<p>
I wrote this in a separate editor and am copy/pasting here:
</p>
<p>
This is a longer post about my experience with SRS and FFS with the Mexico Transgender Center in Guadalajara, Mexico in 2022. There are two primary surgeons, Dr. Ivan Aguilar (Dr. Ivan) and Dr. Carlos Menendez Miranda (Dr. Carlos).
</p>
<p>
For bottom surgery, I opted for “Cosmetic SRS” which is also known as zero-depth or limited depth.. I am 52 years old and asexual. I don’t see much need for myself to have a vaginal canal. I originally contacted Dr. Ivan about just an orchiectomy but was “upsold” to the Cosmetic SRS option. I also got “upsold” on some FFS work. I was an easy mark. There was almost no effort made on Dr. Ivan&#39;s part. I already convinced myself that I wanted the Cosmetic SRS rather than just an Orchi and the facial work was more of &#34;what else can you do while I am under?&#34;
</p>
<p>
For FFS, I did not have my skull shaved. Instead, I got a nose job, buccal pad removal, lip lift, face lift, neck lift. Initially Dr. Ivan wasn’t going to do the lip lift or face lift but I guess when Dr. Carlos saw me, he decided the face lift and lip lift should be done. I didn’t meet with Dr. Carlos before the surgery day. This was a mistake because I was being asked what kind of nose I wanted while being wheeled into the OR. I was NOT charged more for the additional surgeries.
</p>
<p>
They (Dr. Carlos and Dr. Ivan) do a lot of plastic surgery, not just for transgender people, so I trusted their sensibilitity. I had doubts about having any FFS work done at all.I’m older, I’ll never pass for a 20- or 30-something woman but passing as a 50-something woman is much easier (menopause tends to make cis-women look more masculine, so the playing field is leveled for me).
</p>
<p>
But I was going to Guadalajara and going under the knife, so I asked for everything they could do. They probably would have done BA at the same time but I’m really, really unsure about BA. I want to see what I grow on my own without testes to make testosterone.
</p>
<p>
I did ask about BBL, but was told they won’t do BBL at the same time as SRS. So maybe on a future trip?
</p>
<p>
“Cosmetic SRS” was $10500 in 2022. I think it’s about $13,000 in 2023. I also got about $10,000 worth of work done on my face. The neck lift being the most expensive at $4800. These are 2022 prices and there is a planned price hike in 2023 (about 25%).  Other costs included $1100 in airfare (I bought a ticket for a friend who couldn&#39;t use it). And $2800 for 21 days at the Numi Recovery House (room and 3 meals a day, 24/7 nursing care). I also had about $100 worth of blood work done the day before and spent probably another $200 on various medications and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (which Dr. Carlos recommended). I also was required to buy medical tourism insurance which was another $1200. Altogether, I spent about $35,000 cash, out of pocket. No insurance. I&#39;m wondering if I can get a tax write off?
</p>
<p>
Dr. Ivan also does Penile inversion and Sigmoid Colon Vaginoplasty. Those are about 60% more in cost. They also offer the chance to have a vaginal canal added in the future with Cosmetic SRS.
</p>
<p>
My consultation with Dr. Ivan was free and easy. The hardest part was installing WhatsApp. We had a scheduling mixup and he initially called an hour sooner than I was expecting. He apologized and called back at the appropriate time. The consultation went well, Dr. Ivan speaks excellent English and the discussion went well. Overall, Dr. Ivan projects a little Machismo but not as much as I would expect from a US Surgeon). He was very courteous. I felt more like I was speaking with an equal. At the time of my consultation, he had done over 230 SRS surgeries with only two complications, both times the complications had to do with dilating. He had zero complications with the cosmetic SRS option.
</p>
<p>
I initially planned to stay at an AirBNB with a friend. But that friend had passport problems, so I asked my mother to go. She didn’t want to go but wanted to make sure I was taken care of, so she gave me the money to pay to stay at the Numi Recovery House. That turned out to be the best possible option.
</p>
<p>
I slept my entire flight from Denver to GDL. Volaris is a bargain airline based in GDL, definitely check their rates. Just beware that they charge extra for almost everything. Because I was asleep, I never got my customs forms filled out and was dropped into the airport. I followed the group to immigration and got my passport stamped. I then asked where to go for customs and was pointed toward a maze of rope lines but no one was there. I walked over and found a customs form which I completed. It asked about declaring cash, I had about $20K in cash on me and I was supposed to declare amounts over $10K. The form I had mentioned another for, so I took the form I had up to a person and tried to ask for the other form, he pointed to a big button and told me to press it. I did, a green light came on that the customs officer pointed out the door and I was through customs just like that!
</p>
<p>
I arrived in Mexico two days before my surgery. I was picked up at the airport by Leo, one of the drivers associated with the Transgender Center. We coordinated our meeting over WhatsApp. I was taken to the Recovery House and shown my room (private room with en suite bathroom). I was fed dinner and settled in for the night.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, Yuni, Dr. Ivan’s head nurse who runs the recovery house, took me to a clinic for blood draws for lab work and an EKG. I didn’t know I was going to get an EKG and told Yuni that things were about to get exciting. I have an abnormal EKG, so the machines always say I just had a heart attack. Fortunately, I have a baseline EKG that I shared with Yuni and that satisfied everyone. My baseline was from 2017 and was identical to the EKG from the morning. I was able to learn some Spanish terms (infarcto=heart attack) because the outputs were so similar.And… the lab was late getting results but fortunately, I just had labs done as part of a physical about a month prior (I went to my Primary Care Physician for an annual checkup and a green light for surgery).
</p>
<p>
I got back to the house and was fed again. I had to avoid food and water after 8pm, so I got to eat early. The next morning, Yuni took me to the hospital at a little before 7am. I was shown to a room that was very, very small where I changed into my hospital gown and got into the bed. The nurses started an IV (which they found challenging which I found interesting because I’ve had phlebotomists in the US compliment me on how easy I am to work with). I suspect I got a new nurse and this was one of their first times putting in an IV line.
</p>
<p>
I eventually was transferred to a gurney to go to the OR. I had to get out of bed and walk to the gurney. I was unsure what my future would be like. I was wheeled around  deeper and deeper into the hospital. I was taken by how the hospital wasn’t maintained to US standards. Paint was sloppy, trim wasn’t fit well, stains, etc, etc. But they used sterile practices so I chalked this up to cultural differences.
</p>
<p>
Soon after I met the plastic surgeons for the first time. There was the primary (Dr. Carlos) and a female surgeon working with him. I never met the anesthesiologist (which is common practice in the US). Dr. Carlos asked me what kind of nose I wanted. I just said “something more feminine”. This turned out to be both the worst and best thing I did the entire process. I wish I had more time to consider my nose but by giving the doctor “free reign” he was able to give me a better nose in many ways (I can breathe easier now because he was able to remove some excess cartilage that was obstructing my breathing, and he was able to use the cartilage in the rest of my nose to provide better structure, so my healing has been a lot faster and I didn’t need to wear a splint on my nose as long, so two wins, one loss. I won’t know the final product for another six months but the change is very subtle). And he did a lip lift which wasn’t part of the plan but I think he was feeling generous because I gave him room to do his best work.
</p>
<p>
Back to the story… I woke up in a OR recovery area around 7pm. I had my watch on (which is a fitbit, it will be interesting to go back over the data). Eventually they wheeled me to a transfer area and I think they realized then that I couldn’t go back to my original room (there was no way I was going to be able to walk and climb into the bed) So they found a proper sized room for me, and wheeled me in then transferred me to the bed that would be my home for the next 15 (miserable) hours.
</p>
<p>
I say “miserable” because the anxiety kicked in almost immediately. I couldn’t get cool enough no matter how many blankets I kicked off or how low I set the AC. The buttons on the AC remote were worn off, so I had to google the AC model and look at a picture of the remote to be able to operate the AC. Thankfully my phone was nearby and fully charged (I plugged it in when I first arrived at the hospital). The splint on my nose made it hard to focus on my phone, so I didn’t get to pass time staring at the screen. I turned on the TV and found Netflix and configured it for Ingles (everything was in Spanish). I tried watching some of my favorite shows, Stranger Things and DIsenchantment but both ended up making my anxiety worse. So I tried to sleep. I was fed dinner but wasn’t given a straw. I was drinking as much water as I could get in me, which wasn’t a lot. Fortunately, I had a catheter in, so I didn’t have to get out of bed to go pee. I also didn’t consume any solids (and hadn’t since 7pm the night before) so BMs were not an issue. The nurses kept checking my temperature because I was too hot. But my temp was fine. I also didn’t realize the Guadalajara is at about 5100 ft elevation. The reason I moved from Colorado to Florida is that my body doesn’t handle elevation well. Eventually the nurses checked my SpO2 and it was low. The lowest I saw was 77% but it was running about 85% “regularly’ (should be 95%+). Eventually they gave me oxygen and I was able to sleep. But they kept coming and checking my SpO2 and removing the oxygen. Then I’d spiral back into anxiety.
</p>
<p>
The next morning around 10am, Yuni came in to take me back to the recovery house. My bottom was sore from the bed but I was afraid to lay the bed flat, I didn’t want swelling to suffocate me. The nurse came in to drain the catheter bag and kept massaging my abdomen thinking that I must have been holding it. No, I was just dehydrated.
</p>
<p>
I was so happy to get out of the hospital. In my room at the recovery house, I settled into the electric recliner and Yuni made sure I had my phone, remotes and water in reach. I think I may have gotten out of the recliner to eat some dinner that night but I just ate the broth from the soup. I just did broth the next day and tried solid foods the day after. Yuni gave me a stool softener because I hadn’t had a BM in several days. I don’t think it was necessary, once I was eating solid foods and having a little coffee, things started moving on their own. I was still struggling with anxiety but being able to see out the window and have control over my room (and the ability to get up and walk around if I wanted) was great.
</p>
<p>
The next morning I was discussing my anxiety with another person staying at the recovery house, she mentioned that it might have been hot flashes from being off estrogen. That made immediate sense. The following Monday (surgery was on Wednesday) was the first really good day I had since the surgery. I saw Dr. Carlos who removed the mesh stitches on my neck and a few other stitches. I had a big hematoma on my neck from the neck lift. Dr. Carlos complained about my bleeding too much, he scolded me for taking blood thinners (I hadn’t but later found out that bleeding a lot in surgery is a family trait).
</p>
<p>
Wednesday, one week after surgery,  was the watershed day for me. I saw Dr. Carlos again. He drained the hematoma and prescribed some anti-bruising meds (not used in the US) and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (not commonly used in the US) to accelerate the healing process. I also was able to take my estrogen again. Also the splint had fallen off my nose and one of the drains in my vulva had come out on it’s own. Evidently this was normal. I also got the catheter removed. Which meant I didn’t need to carry the bag around with me but I had to manage my own bladder needs.I went to the recovery house feeling almost normal. Later that day, I even walked down the street and back just to feel what it is like to move around. I was euphoric when I had to pick up my pace crossing a busy street, not having body parts between my legs was amazing!
</p>
<p>
Details over the next week are sketchy and unimportant. I am glad I stayed as long as I had planned (today is day 12 post-op and I could be cleared to fly home but I am staying until Monday).

<p>
are you just getting an orchiectomy?
</p>
<p>
Guadalajara is a very typical Latin American city. I think it&#39;s actually safer than the presence of bars on windows and barbed fencing would warrant. But I&#39;m not from here.
</p>
<p>
Start practicing DuoLingo now. Get as much Spanish in your brain as you can. Many people (doctors and some of the nurses) speak English but you will encounter some people who don&#39;t at all. Everyone uses WhatsApp to communicate and you can use Google Translate to translate what you want to say and copy/paste. Many times the nurses and I communicate by typing on our phones and showing each other the translation. Yuni, who runs the Recovery House, speaks fluent English.
</p>
<p>
Even if you don&#39;t stay at the Numi Recovery House, Yuni will be coordinating your transportation to and from the airport and your post-op nursing care.

I found the accent in Guadalajara is harder to follow. I&#39;ve lived in Texas and Colorado (and now Florida) and am around a lot of Spanish speakers. A woman who was here the first week of my stay works as a Spanish translator and didn&#39;t feel confident in the local dialect (TBH I think she struggled with self-confidence in general). Another woman who is in the hospital tonight, had been doing DuoLingo for a while and has been able to interact more easily with the staff. I&#39;ve been playing catch-up since I got here but I can tell you that just spending 15 minutes a day for two weeks has improved my understanding and helped with communication with the staff.
</p>
<p>
Zero Depth is a great option if it works for you. No dilation. Recovery time is measured in weeks instead of months. If I hadn&#39;t had work done on my face, I could have easily gone home at the 12 day post-op point as Dr. Ivan said. I&#39;ve stayed 15 days post-op because day 12 fell on a Thursday, so I decided to stay the weekend. I&#39;m glad I did. I feel ready to go back home.

I think Dr. Ivan&#39;s 12 days for flying is conservative. If you are just getting zero depth and nothing else, you&#39;ll be moving around after a week (when the drains and catheter come out).
