This is the picture she took immediately Post-Op FYI. I won&#39;t be seeing it till 1week after when the packing and catheter come out. And this was done with her new labia method with her using shaft skin to create them as opposed to sutures.

Yeah, dilations from what I know start at 3 times a day for 10 minutes for 3 months, then you start dialing back on the schedule. Wittenberg likes to focus just one week at a time though, so shell teach/tell me all that stuff at the 1st post op.

I would caution against coming to the US for bottom surgery as most us surgeons would not take another countries healthcare. Generally they just take private us insurance provided by an employer. I don&#39;t even know if she would take cash payments. Because she uses a robot at the hospital it can drastically raise the cost of the surgery to I assume at least 50000 in cash if not more. Even with insurance I had an out of pocket maximum of 4,000 USD which I had to pay completely for the surgery. Along with 5000 us dollars for an airbnb for a month, bc San Francisco is comically ridiculous in housing prices. From what I know there are people outside the US that are much cheaper that are doing ppv  I think Dr. kamol is one and I&#39;m sure there are other non us ppv surgeons, but I have no idea kamols bedside manner, costs, or aesthetic.

That&#39;s awesome! Though honestly I have zero clue on the cost. I know for other peritoneal pull through surgeons they require a second surgeon experienced with the robot which can double costs to 100000 or so out of pocket. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard about Dr. Ting PPT costs at least. Really 50000 was just a wild guess on my part. But pretty decent guess as most US SRS surgeons tend to charge 20-40k in cash for standard penile inversion SRS and ppt should be more.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, ive heard similar things about Thailand, I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable going there either. Kamols just the only non US surgeon I&#39;ve heard is doing PPT but I&#39;m probably wrong.

Oh I don&#39;t know about that hospital, Cleveland or anything. I stayed for 3 days at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco. Its a grwaf hospital fyi. The nurses were amazing. She uses that hospital for their robot for the laparoscopic part of Peritoneal Pull Through. Just got discharged to my airbnb with my mom yesterday.

Decent amount, pain caught up with me only once at the hospital, then they gave me dilaudid, but otherwise was given Tylenol, gabapentin, and  oxys at regular intervals. No extreme pain yet though. Lots of the &#34;pain&#34; comes from gas pain BC of it being a laparoscopic procedure. Been taking gasx and walking around to help the gas come out. I did have nausea from time to time, threw up once after eating BC I refused nausea meds one time.

Yes, I could aleep, but for safety and to keep up on your pain management, they usually come in at least every 2 hours to check vital signs, and ask your pain levels, then give you more pain meds as needed. I had noise cancelling earbuds which were an absolute lifesaver in terms of being able to sleep/nap, but you&#39;re definitely not getting 8 hours uninterrupted sleep.

Yes, but they do give you a hair removal guide and encourage you to remove all hair from the penis shaft, a little around the shaft base, and remove hair around the perineum (area between butthole and end of scrotum) but technically not required. Peritoneal tissue lines the majority of the vagina so 0 risk of hair inside. Their might just maybe be hair on the labia or the first inch of the vagina, so if that happened it&#39;d be easier to remove.

Oh my gosh that makes me so happy you said this. Hopefully the labia heal well, she said using the penile skin was a bit more risky cuz she hasn&#39;t been doing that this long, but the normal way she did it before was with sutures and I think she said she had 60% of patients getting labia retraction. So here&#39;s hoping it stays pretty.

What a nice idea to make a picture for you. I had the first glimpse of mine 9 days after surgery, once the bandages (and everything else) came off.

I love the idea you&#39;re having this picture already. So neat!

Yeah I was super surprised when I saw the email with the picture. Was sent to me literally the day of surgery. And my surgery was apparently effortless with no inital complications, it didn&#39;t even take her the full 5 hours, it was apparently done in 4.

More chance for lubrication, at least some, maybe enough for sex, who knows? Also peritoneal tissue seems to establish a more cis-like vaginal flora. Probably the biggest one for me was less electrolysis needed. Even though I did far less of an area, it still took me 8 months of extremely painful genital electrolysis. Oh, and more guaranteed length, especially being a little less endowed.

Nope no laser, as theres no guarantee its permanent and big one, laser doesn&#39;t work on me, my hair is too blondish. Paid 800 dollars to try on my face awhile back and had zero effect. Didn&#39;t even bother trying again for genitals. I did have to get lidocaine injections to handle the pain. Actually I would consider the pain of genital electrolysis more than any pain I&#39;ve felt in the first 4 days post op. Genital electrolysis was HORRIBLE. But of course YMMV.
