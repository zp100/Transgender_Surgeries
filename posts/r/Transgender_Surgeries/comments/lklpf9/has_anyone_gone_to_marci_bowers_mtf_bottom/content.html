I’m trying to see if anyone has gone to her and not had electrolysis done beforehand to hear what kind of results could be expected. I’m already scheduled with her but as time has gone on I’ve found that I don’t have the money, mental fortitude, or pain tolerance to deal with genital electrolysis. My understanding is that she scrapes the follicles so it’s mostly fine but to expect a few stragglers. Is this true? Can you feel them when dilating/piv? Is it something that’s really that noticeable?

Just get electrolysis. The mental pain of having hair in you is forever, electrolysis is short term. If you don&#39;t get some kind of hair removal, expect hair. That&#39;s why they recommend it so heavily

If you can’t deal with the pain go with one of the places who give you twilight sedation.

There are plenty of cases where people have discussed the pain (emotional, mental and physical) experienced from having hair inside their vagina. Read posts and comments. Deeply.
</p>
<p>
You do not want to skip electrolysis when you are going to a surgeon who specifically recommends it... It can haunt you for a long time afterwards. Hair in the vagina can be uncomfortable for both yourself and, potentially, sexual partners too. Ingrown hairs can lead to infections which can then lead to other complications. It can be extremely challenging to deal with later and in some cases isn&#39;t an option.
</p>
<p>
Not all surgeons use the same technique so it&#39;s important that you follow instructions given by the surgeon that  you&#39;re seeing.
</p>
<p>
Its also advisable to complete hair removal 6 months or more before surgery.

Get electrolysis. After your final clearance, wait several months to see if anything grows back. I have a friend who had her electrolysis done poorly, and Dr. Bowers did the follicular scrape. She&#39;s got hair in the vaginal canal, and she is devastated.

If hair does end up in the vaginal canal, is there a way to remove it?

If it&#39;s near the entrance, it&#39;s not difficult to remove. If it&#39;s inside, it can be removed, but it requires a speculum, a curved probe, and a lot of patience. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll easily find an electrologist who&#39;ll be willing to do this work, and in some places, it may be considered &#34;practicing medicine&#34;, as it&#39;s invasive. I&#39;ve heard stories of some doctors using laser inside, but I don&#39;t personally know of this ever happening.
</p>
<p>
Another solution is to revise with an intestinal vaginoplasty or a peritoneal pullthrough vaginoplasty.

Please get hair removal!! I didn&#39;t and I regret it so much. Dr. Bowers did the follicle scrape but I had no idea I would still end up with internal hair. She should&#39;ve been more upfront about it.

Marci Bowers is very deceitful!  She will leave you with a lot worse issues than just hair inside the vagina. I am assuming she was left numb down there with the old school procedure, and now deliberately makes girls less sensitive down there. Marci Bowers bowers messed up my sex life.   You might not think this is a big issue until you start having partner issues  because of your inability to arouse and realize that this even affects your ability to fall in love like a normal adult because sexually she left you like a kid again. To not go into much details, let&#39;s just say she overly reduced the size of my clitoris  against my will...  the only reason I&#39;ve not sued her is because the whole thing is humiliating to me and I don&#39;t want the negative publicity on this surgery as I don&#39;t regret the surgery, what I deeply regret the surgeon!!!!!!!
<br>
She has left me a nasty reminder of her betrayal that will probably last for life! Don&#39;t trust this surgeon at all!!!

If you can get it done, get it done. I went to Marci without getting it done. As long as I keep my vaginal ph between 4.5 and 3.5, my vaginal tissue can&#39;t grow hairs.

Vaginal application of acetic acid. The brand names are Acid Jelly, Acidic Vaginal Jelly, Aci-Jel, Bidette, Fem pH, Feminique, Massengill Douche and Relagard.
</p>
<p>
Keep the ph between 3.5 and 4.5 until the microbiome maintains it without assistance. Hair follicles need a ph between 4.5 and 5.0 to grow hair.

Mental fortitude and pain tolerance can be dealt with.  Money is more difficult.

It really doesn&#39;t. That is again untrue, spreading misinformation, and no surgeon will ever tell you this is a 100% effective method and if they do they&#39;re trying to sell you a dream. And as someone who got cauterization (not just scraping I mean full cauterization) done in my own procedure, I still ended up with internal hair. One heat zap doesn&#39;t kill the follicle entirely. Roll your dice I guess 🤷

LOL. I remember just trusting the surgeon too and that turned out so well. My surgeon is actually one of the most positively talked about surgeons on the sub hence why I haven&#39;t name dropped them. Also internal hair complications don&#39;t just happen to bad surgeons, they happen to literally every surgeon who performs these surgeries.  I&#39;ve seen/heard of decent and bad outcomes from all surgeons.

Further if you look it up 1 intense heat zap as you put it can and will permanently kill a follicle, just as burn victims.

<p>
Look, I&#39;m not going to argue with you this is NOT true and my direct experience contradicts this &#34;fact&#34;. You realize the heat zap in cauterization is more comparable to the power of zap in laser hair removal right? Have no idea where you got the whole &#34;burn victim&#34; level burn (which would surely damage the tissue and affect sensation), guess your surgeon is selling you something good.

I said it was more comparable to the zap in laser hair removal, not that it is laser hair removal in itself. They don&#39;t use a laser to cauterize the hairs, but that still doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a permanent solution in many cases.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t obviously change your mind, and that&#39;s not my intention with these comments, it&#39;s to call out what you&#39;re saying because it&#39;s scientifically inaccurate and spreading misinformation. Your surgeon may be telling you one thing, but surgeons aren&#39;t experts in hair removal either. Do what you want, just stop spreading false info.

I suggest you do a lot more research into hair removal, and why surgeons recommend it. If you don&#39;t believe me or the downvotes you&#39;ve received, feel free to reach out to other surgeon&#39;s offices and see what they say. And for &#34;anecdotal&#34; experiences there sure seems to be a lot in this sub, every surgeon experiences this issue.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not an expert, however I have talked to hair removal experts about my situation. They all recommend the same thing. Your &#34;medical&#34; advice is misleading you, and as someone who followed that same medical advice all I can say is good luck lmao
