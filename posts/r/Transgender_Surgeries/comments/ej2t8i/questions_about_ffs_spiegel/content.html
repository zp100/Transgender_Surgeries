I&#39;ve met him in person, he came across as self assured and a salesman, i watched someone sign a form expressly stating that he and he alone would do 100% of the procedure (I stood next to them in his office). Then, a week later, found out from him and his understudy his understudy did some of the proceedure, that part failed and resulted in a 1cm hole in the patient&#39;s scalp was done by the understudy. He nor the understudy were willing to correct the issue, a local hospital back home with a top notch wound clinic stepped up. I think you can guess my opinion of him.

If it was me, I&#39;d have sued, and it sounds like you would too. I dont disagree with you there. I&#39;ll offer a common example from a different field tho, a lot of people dont report or prosecute abuse, because the shame and mental anguish outweighs the financial or legal benifit of a legal settlement, it&#39;s not &#34;logical&#34;, but neither are most people especially when faced with extreme dysphoria.

He is extremely conservative with this work, if you are looking for big changes he probably wont satisfy you

He botched my hairline and I think it’s because he has an outdated suturing technique. Look at Gigis video on YouTube about her scar from him. Mine looks worse and I didn’t have a bad hairline to begin with

Facial Team have been around for quite a while now and there’s been very few complaints. I’ve seen a few for rhinoplasty.

Hello, I used Dr Meyer in California.  He and his staff were amazing. I was back to work in a week, the incisions were hardly noticeable. The results were great, immediately I got more Ma’am’s and Ms without makeup.
