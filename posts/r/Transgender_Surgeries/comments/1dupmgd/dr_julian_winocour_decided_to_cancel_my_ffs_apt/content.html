File a grievance right away and demand service. In 30 days, file a DMHC demand for independent review
</p>
<p>
Sorry you&#39;re going through this! I&#39;m in the middle of the grievance process with them too.

OMFG, this is horrible. I‚Äôm angry and heartbroken for you. I live in San Francisco. I grew up here, it did not used to be like this. There seems to be this attitude here these days of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy, people want me and I make a small fortune, f*ck them I‚Äôll do as I please.‚Äù  And they do it w impunity.
</p>
<p>
I will be sure to always pass on this story to anyone considering Winocour, to avoid him so they don‚Äôt have to suffer the emotional turmoil.
</p>
<p>
Im so very sorry for you.
</p>
<p>
Please do file a grievance. I think a journalist would be happy getting their teeth into this too. Transitioning is hard enough psychologically, then add this bs from the people who are supposed to be our advocates and caregivers, makes it unbearable.

Hi Alyssa,
</p>
<p>
Thanks! I should clarify the OP is Colorado I think, I&#39;m California (SF). I&#39;m in the grievance process with Kaiser Norcal. They&#39;ll be in process with Kaiser Colorado.
</p>
<p>
I moved out of SF 25 years ago, swearing to never return. First I went for half an FFS, and now I&#39;m spending two months there to care for a friend who&#39;s having SRS.
</p>
<p>
SF used to be a place to live. Now I get hives just thinking about it. [shiver].
<br>
But that might also just be because I&#39;m old and crotchety.

Oops, I inferred from the reference to UC and Kaiser that the bad behavior happened here, lol.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still upset and angry it happened to the OP.  Such a long stressful wait and anticipation, and then they take it away.  Horrible.
</p>
<p>
In defense of SF (I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m defending it after the past fifteen years of it becoming unbearable), I am falling in love with it again as a beautiful place to live.  There is a residue of crappiness, though, leftover from the tech tsunami of ravenous young piranha-people, but a lot of them have left and we have a higher concentration of lovely decent people.  It&#39;s just not the simple small city/town I grew up in anymore, it&#39;s forever changed.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m old and crotchety too, but I&#39;m hopeful it will become a fun, livable, and artistic place again.

I think as long as it costs $2M to live in a cardboard box in the Mission or around Brannon - there&#39;s not going to be fun and artistic people. And a city devoid of its fun and artistic people is soulless.
</p>
<p>
And its unhoused issues need to be dealt with.
</p>
<p>
I was in the medical field (in fact, my graduate nursing degree came from UCSF) which is only how I knew UCHealth was Colorado rather than SF or Davis. ;)  It&#39;s confusing.
</p>
<p>
But Kaiser Norcal sucks too. I&#39;m months into fighting them and will be months more.

Yes. This happens for sure. Think about scheduling consultations with several surgeons.

Kaiser only covers UC health for FFS :-(. This seriously messed up my year and I‚Äôve been so depressed since then

I think UChealth has a HORRIBLE overbooking problem. They want to make sure they don‚Äôt miss a surgery day and sometimes they will double book because people will drop out. I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you ü´Ç I had my rhinoplasty with Dr Yu and it came out great. I totally understand if you were set on Dr. Winocour  and obviously it was sooner.
