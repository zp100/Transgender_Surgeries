I had black areas and the doc I had said it was common with urethral tissue.  Hopefully your friends return.  It is hard to feel so weak and alone.  Reach out to me one of your sisters if you need to. Charlie

You‚Äôve just come out the other side of an extremely invasive surgery that you elected to have so you could be your true self. You did that despite knowing that there would be pain, stress, and struggle and you did all that even while enduring everything else us trans girls face every day.
</p>
<p>
You are not weak.
</p>
<p>
You are so so strong, and an inspiration.
</p>
<p>
Keep going, hon. You got this ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Please, see a doctor. There might be black necrosis, that needs to be managed! You also need to see a psychiatrist! You not seem to be emotionally stable enough to get through this right now.

The revision I got 2 days after going out of the hospital, the doctor told me that that&#39;s not important. That the black thing will fell off.

I had a surgery where they cut my nuts open to staple them to the side (bilateral orchidopexy; torsion correction, but it turned out to be cancer). There was a huge nasty black gash down the sack afterwards. It fell off and healed up fine. If I wasn&#39;t missing a ball, you&#39;d never notice.
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s not very painful and swollen, give it time; this absolutely does happen with that skin and it can heal.

The only thing that really &#34;hurts&#34; it&#39;s more uncomfortable it&#39;s the catheter. Just 3 more days and it&#39;s out... Hope when it&#39;s out everything goes back to normal.

Ok, but if it gets wet and there is a strange smell caused by this area, see a doctor. Do you have antiseptic wound spray? What did they give you to keep the wound clean? I hope you come through this tough time!! Take careüôèüèª

We have been through this, with all suffering and even suicidal thoughts. Just think about it, it&#39;s temporary and will get better. The clots will fall. You were very brave to do this surgery, don&#39;t forget that. And those people, they don&#39;t reserve to be called friends. Forget about them and find real friends.

You can get through this !
</p>
<p>
I know it&#39;s hard but it will get better eventually, you are having it quite bad at the moment and honestly I think the best place for you is back in hospital x
</p>
<p>
Please tell me your surgeon has seen it like this ?
</p>
<p>
If they haven&#39;t I would seriously think about contacting them or the nurse today and not waiting until tomorrow. If you cannot get hold of them I would go to A&amp;E or the hospital you had the operation or revision in.
</p>
<p>
It could be nothing but that black part should be looked at ASAP.
</p>
<p>
You will get through this x

Stay strong and brave. When one door closes the are so many more waiting for you to open. Just take each day one at a time and a year from now you&#39;ll be absolutely amazed at how far you&#39;ve come.

I had a very similar look post surgery. I promise you, give it time it will heal beautifully. I had the big black scab and it indeed falls off with time. Likely another 3 or 4 weeks. Do not pick or pull until told to if it doesn&#39;t come off on its own

Don&#39;t worry. I will never do something that my doc didn&#39;t tell me. Just cleaning it with soap and my hands so I don&#39;t make any damage to the skin. And just little touches with the towel.

Look at my post. I had a large black scab too, and the general look was not good either. It was really really swollen. It will improve over time. If you still don‚Äôt like it after a year, you can get a revision, but don‚Äôt judge as if your result now is final.
</p>
<p>
But as I commented on your post earlier, I am most worried about your catheter. It doesn‚Äôt matter who planned to leave it in you for 16 days total (if I recall correctly), make sure you are taking antibiotics prescribed by your doctor and carefully watching for UTI.

So I was very freaked out about something similar when I had srs. I was completely convinced that my clit was going to fall off. Turns out it was a clot that was just hanging out. Just remember that pain and recovery will play tricks on you. Be careful which thoughts you dwell on because they likely aren&#39;t based on anything other than not feeling well and not having much in the way of creative outlet. Call a friend or watch a new show.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re ok. Trust your body. It knows how to heal and that&#39;s your only job right now.

Thank you for asking for help and letting us in a little bit. You deserve good friends and I am sorry your old ones deserted you. There is some good discord servers lying around that you can access and start to get more plugged in. DM if you want.

<p>
Hope for a speedy recovery and saying a prayer for you. Good luck! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Why suicidal? What‚Äôa wrong? That‚Äôs a long time to have a catheter in. Who is your surgeon and what are they saying? Please call a friend or family member or your doctor immediately if you are seriously having thoughts of harming yourself.

And the suicidal thoughts are because I lost all my presencial friends. They didn&#39;t ask how the surgery went and if I&#39;m ok. So I just got mad and told them everything. They just blocked me or got mad and told me that our friendship will never be the same. Then the pain, my low movement, tiredness, anxiety, depression... Everything went at the same time and the time I have to think alone, just got my suicidal thoughts come again. But don&#39;t worry, I already contacted a therapist üòä

Well they thought that just watching my Instagram histories where sufficient and didn&#39;t need to ask. Never asked if I was alive or the month earlier to the surgery, never asked about my anxiety or if I was prepared. When we went out to have fun they never asked me something about the surgery or trying to put me into the conversation. So I was just looking at my phone.

I&#39;m glad to hear that you contacted a therapist. With enough time, you&#39;ll realize that you&#39;re better off without people like that. You&#39;ll find new friends that actually love and accept you for who you are

They will remove my catheter in 5 days they told me that my urethra and clitoris where very swallowed so if they take it off the might put it in again soy they preferred to let it a week more. And they told me that the black thing will just fell off and it&#39;s nothing important. But don&#39;t worry. Tomorrow I will call the doctor and ask him if it&#39;s really nothing. Thanks for the worries hugs üòä‚ù§Ô∏è

Don‚Äôt panic girl! U were strong enough to face all your life with dysphoria, you‚Äôll get trough this! The blackness it‚Äôs normal since there‚Äôs a lot of stitches, dry blood and everything, it will come off‚Ä¶ just talk to your surgeon. Unfortunately bad thoughts are common since you‚Äôre weak from the surgery, u can‚Äôt get up and do the things u were used to do. But think in the long term, once your healing it‚Äôs over u will have a much better life feeling more complete! I promise u it‚Äôs just a question of time, don‚Äôt forget that! I wish u all the best and a quick recovery, princess! üíï

Like others have said, don&#39;t panic about your result.
</p>
<p>
Post surgery is stressful at the best of times. I know I had one day where I went a little crazy.
</p>
<p>
The human body is amazing though. Shit&#39;s a little weird right now, but with care and supervision of doctors to make sure you don&#39;t need more help, your body has got this.

The black stuff is old skin sloughing off, had that with mine and it smelled so awful as well. You just went through extensive surgery and had the t factory disabled and are probably still off estrogen at this point. Post op depression is a thing. Now‚Äôs the time to call in your support system.
