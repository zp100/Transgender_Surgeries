I had a revision with Ellie Zara Ley and she fixed me up for the most part. She can either take some of your majora OR she can get it from your hip

Same here! She took part of my majora, which was made far too large by Min Jun.

Hey, do you mind if I ask you what your opinion of Min Jun is?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been heavily considering him as a backup in case I can&#39;t go out of country for my primary choice, and I&#39;ve seen some pretty stellar results, but I was wondering if you had any general insight/opinions you could share?

I don’t think it’s giving tucked in penis, and they’re not the worst results but there’s definitely better surgeons out there for aesthetics (well a couple. And most in Thailand).

Does he offer revisions? I know that (for example) Dr. Banks has a similar “issue”, and offers a courtesy revision to construct the posterior comissure. For whatever reason, it seems like no one is able to nail that consistently in a single surgery and requires revisions — even among the “best of the best.”

There are definitely many cis women I have met where their labia minora become far less prominent around their vaginal canal.  I totally understand it not being the esthetics someone wants, but it doesn&#39;t make them look less cis.

It feels like it should be criminal to continue to operate with such consistently poor results/ and or aftercare as Brassard.  NVM the fact that in many provinces, he is the ONLY surgeon they will fund…

The sad fact of the matter is that if you think GRS Montreal is awful you simply have not grappled fully with how bad trans healthcare is in virtually every corner of the world.
</p>
<p>
GRS Montreal is a solidly mid or somewhat above average GRS provider. I get why people are upset with the results sometimes. Many of those reasons are valid. But it&#39;s the reality that, relatively speaking, they&#39;re providing better services than many and most patients are happy.
</p>
<p>
If you go to most places with a robust public health system good luck getting processed with anywhere near the speed of GRS Montreal. Many places the wait lists are like a decade or have absurdly high bureaucracy gatekeeping them. This routinely kills trans people in those countries.
</p>
<p>
If you go to the US you likely cannot afford vaginoplasty better than what Brassard offers unless you are rich or have very good insurance. Most either can&#39;t afford anything or have to go to whichever local state doctor or budget foreign option is out there who probably does about the same level of work, but could also routinely botch people with no consequences. If you are lucky you can afford a top US or Thai surgeon but most can&#39;t. Again, this routinely kills trans people in the US.
</p>
<p>
If you go to Australia you&#39;ll be paying about the same out of pocket as going to Thailand. And you&#39;ll probably get worse care than GRS Montreal. More dead trans people.
</p>
<p>
Truthfully I am not entirely sure about most places in Asia, Africa, and South America. But overall I think there is less access to surgery let alone high quality surgeries with some notable exceptions. I think we can reliably infer by now the effect this has on those trans people.
</p>
<p>
For all of its flaws GRS Montreal does an amazing job at maximizing access to a life saving surgery for many. This comes with certain costs worthy of criticism, I won&#39;t deny that and it&#39;s always important to demand better from our healthcare systems.
</p>
<p>
But it should also be understood how much privilege is involved in having access to even what GRS Montreal offers to begin with. It&#39;s a bit tone deaf to speak in such a way about GRS Montreal when Rumer and Kamol are right there...

As it should be. Brassard is nowhere near as bad as either of them. He does far more surgeries, even his worst results still generally function like a vagina, and he doesn&#39;t come for people like OP legally or deny medical care the way Rumer does when patients post online about their dissatisfaction.

yeah, I&#39;m also in western canada and it&#39;s so annoying because they do surgeries in BC! I can&#39;t find it, but I&#39;m pretty sure they have surgeons that do combined peretoneal pull through/penile inversion. they&#39;re like, so much closer than ontario and you can only go if you&#39;re from BC. it&#39;s bullshit.

There are plenty of people who have had amazing experiences and results from Brassard, a handful of non-ideal results compared to the hundreds of great results and happy patients doesn&#39;t make a surgeon a hack. Especially with the volume of procedures that Brassard performs in a year.
</p>
<p>
And I will agree that OPs results aren&#39;t ideal, and I wouldn&#39;t exactly be thrilled to have these results when I go there next year, but as others have mentioned and OP agrees, people who are closer to the minimum weight than the maximum weight tend to have nicer aesthetic results.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also important to clearly communicate your aesthetic preferences to Brassard or else he&#39;ll give you his default &#34;innie&#34; style which many people don&#39;t prefer.
</p>
<p>
GRS Montreal is the only option for the majority of trans people in Canada, so it would be nice if people thought for a second before saying Brassard is a hack or a butcher, and how insulting that is to the majority of his patients who haven&#39;t had any issues with his work.
</p>
<p>
People like OP should be allowed to voice their dissatisfaction without people like you trying to use their experience to tarnish a legitimate surgeon&#39;s reputation.

I made the exact same post a long time ago, after I had mine at GrS and was like: that barely visible wrinkle is the labia minora? Dr. Laungani (he works there and uses the Brassard technique) explained to me the flaps are very risky, and most surgeons who are risk averse won’t do it.
</p>
<p>
I did feel like the level of attention from GrS was indeed “going through an assembly line”, and some nurses from Asclepiade were either skilled and knowledgeable while others were woefully unprepared. Of the two who answer emails, one was excellent (Sandy) while the other (Ruben) was a shitshow. I legit timed my emails to try and get Sandy to reply to them.

I did manage a follow-up visit 8 months afterwards because I happened to be in Montreal, and Dr. Laungani was again fantastic and attentive. The team and staffing clearly don’t reflect the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Look for a “house tour” post I made on a deleted account. You’ll see him being very thorough explaining what’s what.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck!

Omg that&#39;s such an awful experience to have had!! I&#39;m so sorry for you that you&#39;ve been treated so appallingly.  Wow ! I feel so lucky that my experience was s 14 night stay and constant supervision and help and support. I was even allowed in the sea (Phuket) 16 days after discharge. And no painkillers.  I cant comprehend the experience you&#39;ve described!

Yeah, GRS Montreal doesn’t create the labia minora for what ever reason. I knew that going in. It doesn’t really change much for function wise. There have been complaints about this in the past and nothing has been done.

I have exactly the same result. My surgery was at GRS Montreal with Dr. Belanger. I developed an access 2 weeks after surgery and had pain for 6 months until a GYN noticed the open scar and for more than a year I am going to treat granulation tissue. About labia minor, I have exactly the same appearance as yours.

The granulation tissue has been furious with the treatments!!! Going weekly for me means no time to heal. By the time it doesn’t hurt I have to go back to get another

Hart in Australia doesn’t construct labia minora stating that it is due to high risk of it failing through necrosis. I am investigating the option a revision with a gynaecologist who specialises in reconstructive surgery for women who have been victims of genital mutilation. Although I have oversized labia majora (seems to be Harts preferred aesthetic) I also been researching (and have started to practice) labia pulling to give me more material to work with. I’m pulling from the very inside of the outer lips which is starting ro create little flaps of smoother skin. It is going to take years but I think this is an option. I’m aware that labia pulling is common in some African cultures and believe it is a patriarchal driven practice used to create over-sized labia which appears to be a preference by men in certain cultural groups. I’m opposed to the practice in that context, but once I became aware of it I wanted to try a modified version of it as a technique to grow my own labia minora. Discovered it was a thing after I remembered researching at one point the process of regrowing foreskin through stretching, and wondered if there was a female equivalent. Google didn’t disappoint

So I looked on the old wiki for Brassards results and some are amazing and others disappointing. It’s a bit of a gamble with more chance to have a good result I believe.

I think it&#39;s not outdated so much that GRS Montreal has been forced to adapt in recent years to a large spike in patients far faster than new surgeons can be trained.
</p>
<p>
At the same time the public healthcare system in general is under a lot of strain. Cracks are showing in every corner of the medical system and trans healthcare is not protected from that either.
</p>
<p>
What is the ethical choice for a trans healthcare provider to do in such a situation? They too are stuck in a healthcare system that is not completely within their control, and they are the primary provider of life saving transgender surgeries in Canada.
</p>
<p>
GRS Montreal have kept their wait times low in the face of such constraints, which is a choice that saves lives but also comes at a cost. When I look at results from Brassard 10-20 years ago I think he did better work back then, for example.

personally I don&#39;t think it&#39;s relevant if some cis women don&#39;t have them. Sure, maybe this is within the range of natural human genetic expression. BUT That&#39;s not what we&#39;re dealing with here. We&#39;re dealing with plastic surgery where they&#39;re literally constructing something that didn&#39;t exist.
</p>
<p>
If they set the expectation that they would construct labia minora for you, then you should have labia minora. I agree with you assessment that you do not. The person who said some cis women don&#39;t seems to also with this assessment as well.
</p>
<p>
Yes, they are 100% gaslighting you. Maybe they&#39;re ass-holes, maybe they&#39;re just trying to avoid legal complications or having to pay for doing surgery to fix it (not that I&#39;d ever go back to them after that experience if I were you).
</p>
<p>
Can you force them to fix it through legal means? Maybe... 🤷‍♀️ BUT even if you could would you really want them touching you again? Personally I wouldn&#39;t try even for financial compensation to have someone else fix it unless you can find a lawyer willing to take their fees out of the proceeds of the case, because it&#39;d be possibly years of legal costs otherwise.

Being within cis variation is a very different question from whether it looks typical. Cis women sometimes lack minora but it is definitely not the normative standard.
</p>
<p>
Personally I think the average cis woman without minora is far less likely than a trans woman to be put in danger if their vulva looks a bit &#34;odd&#34;.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Looks odd&#34; -&gt; more scrutiny -&gt; higher risk of being clocked especially if you have some other trans features -&gt; higher average risk of violence for those who are trans compared to those who are cis.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, &#34;looks odd&#34; -&gt; stealth sex is less safe -&gt; importance of disclosing one&#39;s trans status before being intimate is higher -&gt; more likely to be targeted for all types of abuse once trans status is disclosed, if the trans person is otherwise passing
</p>
<p>
I think you have a point worth making here. Body positivity is good and vaginas come in all shapes and sizes. But there are limits to how far an individual can push that safely, especially if they are trans.
</p>
<p>
In B4 &#34;you should always disclose for ones safety&#34; — that&#39;s victim blaming. People will engage in stealth sex regardless &amp; vaginal aesthetics can be a form of harm reduction. Beyond this, for those who pass 100% in bed or close to it the risk of violence by disclosing is often higher than the risk of getting clocked.

I&#39;m sorry but Brassard&#39;s work does look a bit odd most of the time. Yeah, cis women have something similar sometimes.
</p>
<p>
But those cis women face additional scrutiny many trans women do not want if they can all help it. And a trans woman in the same position is simply not as safe.
</p>
<p>
If you look at the gyno diversity or great wall of vulva for example you will see that, if you can find Brassard&#39;s aesthetics in there are all (debatable and it depends on which result/angle we&#39;re talking about), that type of aesthetics are one of the least common at best.
</p>
<p>
And those are resources specifically designed to dispel myths about what the typical vulva looks like. And yet it&#39;s hard not to reach the conclusion that a cis vulva with the typical Brassard aesthetic is pretty damn rare.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Avoiding (predominantly men&#39;s) unrealistic conceptions of what vulvas look like is not a fight that can be reliably won by having any given type of vulva. Nor should surgeons be held to such standards. It sounds like OP&#39;s surgeon claimed that they could, which is fucked up, but as a community we have to wrap our heads around the reality that no surgeon can guarantee any particular aesthetic for all patients. Our bodies are too diverse for that to be possible. We shouldn&#39;t go into surgery thinking it will look a particular way. Like cis women, we get what we get.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry but I have to ask—do you have any plans whatsoever to be intimate with cishet men casually while stealth?
</p>
<p>
If not, you&#39;re speaking from a position of unacknowledged privilege here and should probably get off your soap box about body standards that fundamentally will never harm you in the same way.
</p>
<p>
No surgeon can guarantee they will meet such standards. But some surgeons meet them far more reliably than others that&#39;s just how it goes.
</p>
<p>
Even if you are a stakeholder, don&#39;t cis women and body diversity away tangible risks of violence. Not everybody is comfortable with the same level of risk you are.
