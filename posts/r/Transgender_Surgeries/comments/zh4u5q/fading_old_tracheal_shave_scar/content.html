I had a tracheal shave in March 2021 and the surgeon unfortunately made the incision right on the front of my neck, and the scar is still somewhat visible 21 months later. See pics here:

I did massage, scar gel, sunscreen for the first year post op, and I know it&#39;s not
<em>
that
</em>
noticeable but it does bother me. Is there anything I can do to make it less visible?

Hey there! Honestly it looks really good. Well at least compared to mine. Who was your Doctor?

Thanks! I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s not that noticeable but I really notice it. It was done by Mark Courey at Mt Sinai in nyc, good experience on the whole but I wish I&#39;d known to ask for the incision to be under my chin so no one could see it.

I hope you&#39;re not tall, because in that case everyone will see it anyway, except you in the mirror.
</p>
<p>
Think about whether you&#39;re trying to hide it from yourself or others more.  Might help with how you feel about it.
</p>
<p>
I bottomed out in a lane pool and split the front of my chin.  A few stitches.  Had that scar visible for 10 years or so.  It&#39;s gone now.    ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è scars happen.  People generally don&#39;t care.  Mostly it&#39;s just us.

I wish mine would heal like yours in the same time span. I&#39;m sure it will keep getting better. Did you use scar treatment?

How far post op are you? It really continued to fade for almost a year and a half (and maybe is still fading, hard to say). I did use biocorneum scar gel, which has sunscreen in it because sun can really darken scars. That and massaging it helped, just look up scar massage, although thats sort of hard because its a delicate area.

My scars are opposite - they don&#39;t tan.  I think the point of sunscreen is to reduce difference between scar and surrounding tissue when tanning.  Scars look more like skin when both are unaffected by sun.

I&#39;m about 1 year 3 months post surgery. I will try that massage treatment. Maybe helps a little bit. Thank you for sharing.

You might try V-beam for lingering redness and Fraxel for texture. I had a combo of both for my SRS scars and some old surgical scars and the results were fantastic. I also had medical grade micropigmentation on the FFS scar at my hairline, which had gone all white and visible. This was also a big success at blending it in. Either or both might help but both need to be done by experts and neither will totally remove the scar, only make it less visible. Good luck!

Hey so no one really answered:
</p>
<p>
I had voice surgery + shave at Dr Lance Maron in South Africa. He is most know for fixing hollywood celebraties voice but he also does trans surgeries. He also sadly likes to use the fold in your neck, and I pigment to all my scars.
</p>
<p>
The &#34;fix&#34; for me has been microneedling (not roller but proper FSA approved pen) + TCA 5%-15% peels alternating once a month. Had amazing results.

Nope paid a professional. You can cause real damage if you don&#39;t do it right. I did, microneedling 1 month, next month C02 laser + 5% peel and repeated till scar was almost gone. When from dark dark brown to my my more olive colour :) Also did wonders for newer stretch marks I got.
