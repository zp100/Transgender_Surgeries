I hope you have a speedy recovery... All I can recommend for the granulation and necrotic tissue is a cream called Activon 100% pharmaceutical medical honey.
</p>
<p>
It is amazing stuff.
</p>
<p>
I am 7 weeks post op myself and suffered a fair bit of dehiscence but has healed up nicely with the Activon cream. Now just using bio oil to improve the scarring.

Is this standard results for Dr. Ramineni?

Not to my knowledge. Mine seems a bit uglier than most others I’ve seen.

You’ll heal fine. Look into topical medical honey (manuka honey), if you dont have prior allergies to bees. It really helps heal the outer dehiscence! Be patient.

I think your the second to recommend this here. Maybe I’ll check into getting some. No bee allergies here. My wife is a keeper so we have them around on purpose.

I have a follow up on April 25th. All was looking good at the last appointment. I had some separation along the right labia and necrotic flesh in the same area. After that lifted it was smooth sailing until recently.
</p>
<p>
I feel like some granulation is forming around the vaginal opening and possibly up closer to my clit as well. I’m a little concerned at how ugly she looks still. Shouldn’t all of that in the middle have started to go back inside with swelling going down?
</p>
<p>
Also it seems my body didn’t care for the dissolvable stitches because it’s excruciating as it’s decided to push some of them out

What does Dr. Ramineni or Katie say about the dehiscence?  Do you think you will need a labial revision?

He wasn’t super concerned during the last office visit. Since the necrotic tips had lifted he said it would heal from the inside on its own. I haven’t asked what he thinks in terms of revisions yet. Planning on it at my appointment on the 25th.

What were you doing when the dehiscense happened?  How long after surgery did this occur?  Just curious because I have my own surgery in a few weeks.

The dehiscence happened sometime during the week after packing was removed. I wasn’t doing anything super strenuous or anything, mostly laying in bed, getting up to go to the bathroom or get food as needed. My bed is a bit high off the ground so getting in bed could have cause some of it.

Put aquacell ag on the yellow fibrinous exudate. Cut it Into small pieces and replace as needed. Put medihoney paste on the granulation tissue. You will heal just fine. If anything you can always have the granulation taken care of if the medihoney does work. It worked for me on the outside of my vagina. But I’m get the granulation inside curreted in a month:

Red color means good, black and  greenish yellow brown would mean bad. Yellow means exudate. Manage that with aquacell so it’s doesn’t cause maceration to the surrounding tissue. You’re early healing still so be kind to yourself and just know that it will look amazing once swelling goes down.

Hi.  Are you healing well?  Is the swelling going down?  Any improvement?  How is the pain.  I will follow in your footsteps in 3 weeks. Bridget

Hi! Yes, I’m healing pretty well. Swelling is going down, but swelling takes a while (think months) to go fully down from most any surgery. Pain is still there as a dull throb at times and occasionally I get a sharp pain that feels like lightning shooting down my labia, but otherwise it is decreasing too.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with your surgery, you’ll do great!
