I wrote this up a while ago and figured I should post it before I forget. Here&#39;s how I was 5 weeks post-op with PPT with Dr. Theerapong! Links to my other posts are below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Wounds
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
My inner labia are huge! Swelling has started to go down, but there’s a long ways to go. I was told it’ll take 3 months for most of it to go away (and up to a year for final form). One side is much bigger than the other one and aches more. Swelling has started to go down from the bottom up - the ends are less swollen ka
</li>
<li>
Bleeding has stopped, although the area around my urethra is red and bleeds if poked
</li>
<li>
All the external wounds have healed and don’t have scabs anymore. I’ve started to take warm sitz baths in a basin every few days and wash with some gentle post-pregnancy soap from the pharmacy
</li>
<li>
I apply a silicone cream (hiruscar silicone pro, 295 Baht) to reduce scars
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
Dilating
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I need less lube than I first realized - just a few cm of QC gel is more than enough. Sometimes on the second size I don’t put any on or only a little. Reducing that has subsequently reduced how much drips out of me later.
</li>
<li>
Some days are very easy, others are hard. Not really sure why. I cry sometimes because I&#39;m sick of doing it. Usually doesn&#39;t hurt much, but the last inch or two hurts more, have to go really slow
</li>
<li>
Sometimes I leave it in for an extra 5-10 minutes each size because I don&#39;t have anything else to do
</li>
<li>
I put in the 35mm dilator for the first time.  Felt very tight, but doable. Probably won&#39;t start doing it regularly yet, but cool that it fits in me
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
Going to the bathroom
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Peeing is easy. It can go any direction, but really likes to do a fan sprinkler spray or just down
</li>
<li>
Pooping is miserable. I have to go several times a day and it hurts every time. Lots of water and fiber in the world hasn’t helped - I’m sore down there and it’s hard to relax.
</li>
<li>
Finally done with all the antibiotics. Not done with having gas and indigestion from killing all my gut bacteria though
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
Daily activities
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I can get up and do things, but standing and walking for more than 10-15 minutes at a time is uncomfortable, which really limits how much I can do
</li>
<li>
I can sit cross legged on the floor to do make-up again! Can’t be too slow about it because I can&#39;t sit for very long, but it’s awesome to do that
</li>
<li>
I can ride in the car for hours as long as I have my donut cushion and recline more than usual
</li>
<li>
I think I cannot work yet, even work from home. I am slow doing everything, and I get tired easily. Even working on a computer from bed all day would be too much. I could work part time, but I&#39;m going to wait until I&#39;m ready to go back to normal - probably in 1-3 weeks
</li>
</ul>
<p>

I&#39;m very curious how your new vagina is once healed. I&#39;m very interested in PPT because of the mucous membrane you have in there.
</p>
<p>
I saw one video by a Dr in San Diego who said it&#39;s kind of self cleaning eventually. The discharge carries bacteria out.

Me too! I am very hopeful about long term results. I think it is easier to get good bacteria with PPV. If nothing else, it feels pretty much the same as natal vagina inside, so that&#39;s cool.

I don&#39;t know how self cleaning it is for sure, but it&#39;s going pretty well now.

Yes, I did a lot of research. I like the style he does, everything is clearly there. Some doctors don&#39;t make much labia, which I don&#39;t prefer. He has fairly consistently results for first time surgery, has done some miracles for people with bad results from elsewhere. Combine that with preferring PPV and it wasn&#39;t too hard to decide.

I know this is an old post, but how much was the cost?
