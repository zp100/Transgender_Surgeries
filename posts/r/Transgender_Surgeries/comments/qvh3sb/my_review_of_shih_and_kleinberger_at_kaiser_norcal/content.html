I wanted to wait six months after surgery and then post, but I&#39;m probably going to delete my account and never return to this hellsite. I&#39;m honestly tired of it and the immense drama that it brings. Nevertheless.... onto my review.
</p>
<p>
TL;DR - I am presently happy with my results and would do it again.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m about 2.5 months out of surgery at this point.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>
Bedside Manner
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Shih, Kleinberger, and their staff were all super nice and helpful. Responded to my messages and questions pretty fast pre- and post-operation. Shih called me the day after I left the hospital to make sure everything was going okay.
</p>
<p>
I received prompt responses to my post-surgery concerns (and there were a lot of them, I&#39;ve never been more nervous about fucking something up).
</p>
<p>
Follow-up appointment went well
</p>
<p>
So as far as bedside manner is concerned A+.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>
Overall Results
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still a little swollen, but the majority of it is gone and I&#39;m feeling great. I&#39;m already much happier with my face than I was pre-surgery. I had a fairly prominent brow, orbitals, and nose - those have all been corrected to a pretty satisfactory level. I now have a very nice forehead shape with no humps, and practically no shadowing on my eyes. My jaw has also been tapered, but that one is a bit harder to tell as my jaw is definitely the most swollen part of my face, and ongoing electrolysis certainly doesn&#39;t help hah. My nose is the only part I wish they went a little harder on, but it&#39;s still definitely feminine - and to be honest I told them I didn&#39;t want a huge amount of work done on it, so that&#39;s on me.
</p>

<strong>
Incisions
</strong>
</p>
<p>
All my incisions have been healing without complications, and fairly rapidly IMO. I guess you could take that as a merit toward their sewing skills. At this point they&#39;re all healed to the degree they won&#39;t reopen, and have flattened out considerably. There&#39;s still a little pigment, but over time that should diminish.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Numbness
</strong>
</p>
<p>
So far, I&#39;ve gotten a lot of feeling back in my surgical areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Top portion of my scalp is still numb
</li>
<li>
Lower regions of scalp currently regaining feeling
</li>
<li>
Forehead is almost to 100%, the new nerve endings in some areas are a little too sensitive, should dull over time
</li>
<li>
Nose area at 100%
</li>
<li>
Jaw is maybe around half way there, chin is still kinda numb
</li>
</ul>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
A couple recovery tips:
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Eat. A lot. You might feel sick to your stomach from the opioids, but the more you eat the faster you heal. Pureed soups and protein drinks are great for this.
</li>
<li>
Try not to take the opioids. They&#39;ve been shown to slow healing, make you queasy, and have well-documented addiction problems. Outside of maybe the first day out of the hospital, my pain was easily managed with the acetaminophen they gave me. In fact I would say I was basically rocking 0/10 pain
</li>
<li>
They give you an inverse spirometer to use and tell you how to use it. Definitely do that, it will help with your breathing and honestly, anxiety.
</li>
<li>
Be very diligent with icing, I&#39;m positive the reason I didn&#39;t get major swelling is due in part to following the icing instructions to the letter. They&#39;ll give you a lot of ice packs and some handy slings for them - if they don&#39;t, be sure to request them when they come in the next morning to show you how to swap your bandages
</li>
<li>
I found taking anti-swelling supplements (may have) helped a lot. I was taking Turmeric, Bromelain, and Arnica. I think the arnica helped the most, as I missed a few doses at one point and my swelling was more noticeable. As always, check with your doctor to see if this is a good idea for you.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<strong>
Things I didn&#39;t expect, which had nothing to do with the surgery:
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
That first overnight in the hospital was horrible! Wake up from anesthesia all fucked up, can&#39;t breathe through your nose, you&#39;re all bandaged up and then the swelling starts and it gets super claustrophobic and and and... Because of COVID you can&#39;t have visitors, and as this was my first major surgery I admit I was pretty scared effectively being alone. The nurses were all wonderful though and very attentive.
</li>
<li>
I read about people having post-surgery regrets a week out, like a buyer&#39;s remorse kind of thing. I definitely wasn&#39;t prepared for just how rough that was. It hit me on Saturday, about four days out of the hospital. It was definitely a combination of having to be off my hormones for two weeks (I do injections so I couldn&#39;t just stop a few days before), my mom having to head back home, and just being overwhelmed. That was a very hard night.
</li>
<li>
When they say you need a helper those first few days, you NEED a helper. It would have been immensely more challenging if I had to get through that myself.
</li>
<li>
Your hair is going to be disgusting, you&#39;re going to have a ton of ointment and aquaphor in it. Get a nice cleansing shampoo
</li>
<li>
THE ITCHING. As your scalp et al begin to heal, the nerves will itch. A lot. And there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. You can&#39;t itch it because it&#39;s numb. Best I found was just applying
<strong>
gentle
</strong>
pressure to the itching areas - just lightly place your palm on the area.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Shopping List?
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Food
<ul>
<li>
Protein Drinks (I had about four a day to make sure I was getting enough protein)
</li>
<li>
Electrolyte drinks
</li>
<li>
Soft foods, even soups may be too thick to chew and swallow however.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Medications/Supplements (Ask Dr.)
<ul>
<li>
Arnica cream and tablets
</li>
<li>
Bromelain
</li>
<li>
Extra tube or two of Bacitracin.
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
NOT
</strong>
Neosporin, that can cause dermatitis if used repeatedly and you will be using it repeatedly
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
They recommend getting extra elastic bandages and gauze. To be honest they gave me so much I never even got through everything they provided me with, let alone my extras
</li>
<li>
Aquaphor
</li>
<li>
Multivitamin
<ul>
<li>
Your diet is gonna be fucked and you won&#39;t get proper nutrition for a couple weeks
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
BCAAs
<ul>
<li>
As above, amino acids are extremely beneficial in muscle and tissue repair. You won&#39;t be getting enough from your diet.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Supplies
<ul>
<li>
Straws
</li>
<li>
Blender
</li>
<li>
A wedge pillow for sleeping, much easier than stacking four pillows
</li>
<li>
Humidifier - The extra moisture helps the nose recover faster
</li>
<li>
Headphones?
<ul>
<li>
Your ears are going to be constantly covered by bandages, so there&#39;s no getting earbuds in or out.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Shirts you can easily put on and take off. Your head is gonna be swollen so plan accordingly
<ul>
<li>
I used cheap loose buttons ups
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Children&#39;s size toothbrush
<ul>
<li>
Once you can brush your teeth again, it&#39;s still going to be pretty swollen and tender. The smaller the head the better
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Cotton swabs
<ul>
<li>
For application of ointment to various places
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Tissues
<ul>
<li>
NOT FOR BLOWING NOSE only dab
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Sensitive Baby wipes
<ul>
<li>
For cleaning gunk off your face because you otherwise can&#39;t really wash it
</li>
<li>
Don&#39;t underestimate the psychological benefits of feeling clean
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
A puppy
<ul>
<li>
Okay don&#39;t like, go get a dog
</li>
<li>
But mine is very cute and comforting
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Patience
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I hope this helps. I hope things go well for you. I hope you&#39;re happy.
