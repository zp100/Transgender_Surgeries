I had internal hairs catharized after my SRS. Its only been a few months but It feels like I may need to have a second round.

Can I ask you how that went?
</p>
<p>
Did you have to visit a gynecologist, PCP, or urologist to get it done?
</p>
<p>
Did you have deeper internal hairs, or was it more at the front?
</p>
<p>
I believe my doctor mentioned she could refer me to someone who does that in case the silver nitrate doesn’t work, but idk much about the process. Sorry to ask so many questions, thanks for your insight. I hope that even though you may need a second round it’s solved some of the issue.

No worries happy to help. I had hairs deep within as well as front area. I was referred to a gyno by my GP. It definitely feels a whole lot better and happy to have had it done.

I updated the wiki on this. I was looking into it recently and I&#39;m not convinced anyone has actually managed to permanently remove hair with silver nitrate. Do be sure you&#39;d need to wait at least a year to find out, and I don&#39;t think even one person has reported that.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that hair follicles are quite deep and I think silver nitrate only works at the surface of the skin.

<p>
Electrolysis doesn&#39;t work past a certain depth because you can&#39;t angle the probe properly to reach the follicle. In theory you could get or make a special probe, but I don&#39;t know anyone has done it.
</p>
<p>
Or perhaps you could use an electrolysis machine to basically dig a hole a hole where the hair is. They are capable of burning off skin tags and doing other skin treatment and you&#39;d not need to worry about getting the right angle. I expect that would get it, but then you&#39;d have quite a bit of damage. It&#39;s probably what a surgeon or doctor might do with an electrocautery machine, but I doubt many electrologists would want to try. And then what about the risk of infection?

<p>
Yeah, I think you’re right on that /: I guess I’ll report back and see how the process goes for myself but I doubt it’ll be a permanent fix.

Exactly my thoughts on it.

<p>
Yeah, that’s exactly the predicament the few electrologists I did meet with brought up. I don’t know much about the intricacies of electrolysis, I’d imagine they’d use a different probe for internal hair but I’m not sure. I know the probe no matter the size has some risk of burning the sensitive skin of the neovagina so I could imagine a probe used for skin tags doing that tenfold, probably why there’s limited amounts of electrologists able to do this in the first place. What you mention about surgical cautery could potentially help.
</p>
<p>
I guess we’ll see how I solve this.

<p>
there&#39;s no different probe. There are different probes for skin tags, etc.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s some good info about electrolysis and what you can use it for here

What do you mean there’s no different probe but there is for skin tags and such? Wouldn’t that mean there is? Sorry I may be misunderstanding

There&#39;s different probes even just for hairs.
</p>

</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen one for skin tags and its more like a nail.
</p>
<p>
And for internal hairs you sometimes need to angle the probe backwards as it needs to go in along the hair to the follicle inside. And no one makes those.

Oh what I meant by different probe is they likely wouldn’t use a probe for skin tags on internal hair, not that there’s a specific probe for internal hair… though that’d be nice.
</p>
<p>
I’m pretty sure the only internal hair that’s treatable by electrolysis is what’s physically reachable and visible at the front, which is why it isn’t an option for me. At least not with anyone I’ve found across the US.

Yeah, of course. Can&#39;t guarantee that I&#39;ll be able to kill it, and I&#39;ll need a heads up, but I know it can be done. The only people I know who have done this sort of work are retired, and I believe it&#39;d be too physically demanding.
