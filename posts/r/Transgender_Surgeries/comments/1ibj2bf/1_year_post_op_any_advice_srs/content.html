Have a look at a few different surgeons and make contact with them. The other comments seem to be saying nothing but theerapong, and well, I&#39;m fairly sure they are just advertising accounts for his service.
</p>
<p>
Check out the wiki. it&#39;s only available on PC only, unfortunately, but it has a lot of good information to help find some good surgeons.

The pictures here that i share are from my gf. She had her srs in Februari 2024.
<br>
At first she had a hard time sitting down but we thought that would change.
<br>
It just didnt... her clit remained sitting outside of her vagina. So she got a revision in September.
<br>
As you can see on the pictures. It still doesnt look good. She still has a hard time sitting down. It&#39;s painfull. Her urethra hurts to.
<br>
Any advice for her? Is it smart to do another revision? Or should we look for a different doctor?
<br>
We live in Belgium and honestly the doctor who did the operation has a good reputation but... I guess she&#39;s not that lucky? Any advice is much apreciated!

certainly a different doctor. i think thailand is one option but that can be a bit of cultish support and they get their same bad reviews as many others. most notably is not getting a ton of facetime with the surgeon before surgery.
</p>
<p>
i would want to find a doctor with a good reputation who can see you for a consult before you commit, and then can see you for presurg. i‚Äôm so sorry she‚Äôs in pain that sucks so much, and yeah, it‚Äôs hard to be satisfied with results like that. it might be a long journey but with medicine where it is now, there is certainly a path for her to live pain free‚Äî hopefully with the sexual function she desires as well.

I can give you his name I guess but I had a good result. So did a friend of us... This is the first bad result that we are aware of. And I think that&#39;s important to. His name is Dr. Houtmeyers. I&#39;ll take some pictures from my result to and post those cause I kinda feel somewhat bad for him üòÖ

Yes and it feels kinda shitty cause I advised him having a good result myself and she... Did not... It&#39;s not easy to feel attracted to a vagina that looks like a battlefield üòû luckily the first revision did a lot already

I have seen vaginas on cis women that look like this. Battlefield is quite a cruel way to put it. I understand this isn‚Äôt the ideal result you were both hoping for, but just be mindful of your words.

I&#39;d find someone else, and make sure you look at lots of post-op photo results first. Dr Theerapong in Thailand is quite popular lately and lots of info in the sub and its wiki.
</p>
<p>
Would you mind naming your surgeon?
