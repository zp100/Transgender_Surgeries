I noticed today in the dr Suporn&#39;s Facebook group that they started doing FFS surgeries again . it seems that his ancestor dr Bank started experiencing on people&#39;s face .
<br>
I hoped , that they were learning after botching my face in July that they are not qulified for this job . He destroyed my face and I will never forgive him for what he did to me . I can not even look at my face in the mirror now .These are some details about my surgery .
</p>
<p>
These are some problems that I had with Sopron’s surgery . I discuss my concerns with some well know FFS surgeons that they all approved the poor result of my first surgery.
<br>
1-I still have bossing forehead and brows . There are something like holes on my forehead (I need x-ray to see what he did over there. The is an imbalance in my forehead. Left and right have significant differences. He shaved my orbital rims to look like Asians (it looks awful on my face ) . he did not lift up eyebrows enough . They are still under the orbital rims . His scalp advanced had zero result. his hair transplant is inconsistent . When I discussed my concerns with Sophie and asked about the technique that he used, she told me that dr Suporn has a different technique and he did not do forehead type 3(I am sure that he did not because forehead reconstruction cannot have such a poor result). My scalp is still numb after one year and it did not get better . it means there was a nerve damage
<br>
2-I cannot breath with my nose. My month is always open because I have nose blockage and I need to breath from my month. it has a stupid/unnatural shape after the surgery(I missed my nose before the surgery) . There is a big difference between left and right .
<br>
3- My lip lift was also awful. it looks unnatural and ugly .
<br>
4-I was lucky that he cannot do jaw surgery and it is the only place in my face that he did not destroy. My chin is still too width. it is numb or there was a damage to muscles . I don’t have control on my month when I am eating. My month looks always open. Muscles cannot control it
<br>
5-Overall result is awful. I am not passable after the surgery. Majority of people(99% of people) misgender me. When I discussed my concerns after the surgery he told me that it was not possible to do a better job and I need to do too much makeup .

I think she killed herself weeks after the Baez post. I think she was generally mentally unwell so who knows
