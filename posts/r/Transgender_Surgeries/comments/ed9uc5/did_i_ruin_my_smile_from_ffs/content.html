At 1 week post op, you are still pretty massively swollen, and I wouldn&#39;t rush to judgment about your smile yet.

Great if that&#39;s the case! I&#39;m concerned because I scanned through other folks&#39; recovery timelines and it seems like their facial characteristics returned more quickly than mine. Maybe I should post again in a couple weeks if the issue persists?

While I would definitely discuss it with your surgeon to make sure, anecdotally it took me several weeks to regain normal upper lip mobility.

I was so swollen at one week I literally couldn&#39;t smile, and even now at two weeks, it&#39;s imperfect...  Swelling is a thing...

Did you notice a significant change in movement to your upper lip between one and two weeks&#39; recovery? Mine feels frozen, even though my lower lip seems normal.

Brow ridge reduction, rhinoplasty, fat-injection to cheeks and lips. My doctor was uncomfortable with me being under anesthesia for a significant time (mine ended up being ~10 hours) so we agreed to save potential jaw and chin surgery for a second stage. That&#39;s fine by me, because I am/was hoping that less work will still be enough to pass.

Hmmm...if you&#39;d had jaw or chin work, I could comment since my smile has been weird since i had FFS about 3 months ago. It&#39;s getting better as the feeling comes back and my jaw becomes more flexible.
</p>
<p>
But I didn&#39;t have any fat injections so I don&#39;t know how those would affect things.

Considering you&#39;re at one week, I think you&#39;re engaging in some catastrophizing. It&#39;s understandable; our face is incredibly important.
</p>
<p>
For me, it took about 3 weeks or so for my smile to start to feel okay again. I had a lip lift, rhino, and chin/jaw work. There is a lot of swelling and healing to do. Now at post 3 months my face feels the same as before; in fact my smile is way cuter thanks to the lip lift.

I might be somewhat panicking, yeah. My face certainly looked different everyday, ranging from starvation victim to chipmunk. I acknowledge that my smile could return after a few weeks, as you and others here have verified.
</p>
<p>
I couldn&#39;t find a toothy smile from your profile, but I absolutely agree your whole result (from your pics) is super cute

Holy cow you look way better than I do after a week. I’m like a balloon about to pop I’m so swollen. I’m 8 days out right now.

Oh hey, I remember admiring your earlier self-post to
<a href="/r/transgender_surgeries" rel="nofollow">/r/transgender_surgeries

. Hope the swelling goes down for you soon!
