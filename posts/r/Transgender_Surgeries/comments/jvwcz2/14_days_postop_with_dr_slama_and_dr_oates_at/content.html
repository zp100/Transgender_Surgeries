Hi all!
</p>
<p>
Just wanted to give an update on my last post (
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/jpyl4i/4_days_bottom_surgery_postop_with_oates_and_slama/">here
</a>
). I survived 14 days post-op! Here are a few things I am observing:
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I would say my pain is a 3-4 on a scale of 10. Still hurts to move around, but I am generally functional.
</li>
<li>
My swelling has gone down tremendously and peeing over the last few days has been significantly less messy.
</li>
<li>
I have moved onto the second size dilator, which is a bit more painful to use than the first size. I usually do the first small one for 5 minutes, then move onto the second bigger one for the other 15 minutes. I dilated 3-4 times daily.
</li>
<li>
I had some stitches pop yesterday. UGH. My left labia has a gnarly gash from the stitches popping.  It&#39;s probably a 1x1 inchish wound that opened up. Luckily I had a post-op appointment and Dr. Slama was unconcerned. He mentioned this is pretty common, especially with general physical activity after surgery. I think it happened while dialating, I noticed a bunch of fluid came out after one session. I guess I had a bunch of fluid built up too which contributed to that. I would be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t anxious about it, but from what I know I just need to give it time to heal before anything else needs to happen (if anything).
</li>
<li>
I got prescribed antibiotics yesterday, but I don&#39;t really have evidence for infection. Mostly this was a precautionary measure, especially as some of the stitches opened up. Again, Dr. Slama wasn&#39;t too concerned, but he was err-ing on the safer side just in case.
</li>
<li>
It&#39;s still messy, but things are coming together more. I am overall happy with the results so far.
</li>
<li>
I am actually back at work! I am in tech though, so I mostly just sit on my butt all day long in front of a computer. Not a whole lot of physical labor. Regardless, I am still taking it a bit easy and easing back into things.
</li>
<li>
The care team has been great so far, I actually really like the PA I work with frequently (Caroline Luce). She&#39;s awesome, and has really helped allay my anxiety over recovery.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Happy to continue answering any questions! Overall I am happy, not too concerned with how everything looks. It all looks fine, and I have clitoral sensation, which is important to me. I know things won&#39;t be perfect (whatever that means), and always have an option for revisions down the road. The most important thing to me was to have the right anatomy and have things generally trend in the right direction, which everything is so far!

The anti-biotics are a good move. The urine (accidental exposure to suture/cut lines, &#39;splash&#39;) and the popped stiches both are separate vectors that heighten the risk of infection.
</p>
<p>
Glad to know your healing up well. Thanks for the update. :)

What sort of electrolysis did you have to go through before hand?

I did about 6-7 sessions of laser. I&#39;m lucky because I generally have little body hair and have light skin with jet black hair.

I‚Äôm going in for GCS in SF with Dr. Salim in a couple weeks and I am so. Freaking. Nervous!! Mostly about the time in the hospital (I‚Äôll be there for a week since I live a couple hours away).
</p>
<p>
Any insights into how I can best pass the time alone there? Am I going to be totally out of it the first few days? Is there anything you wish you‚Äôd brought with you that would‚Äôve made the time pass quicker?
</p>
<p>
What was it like getting the packing removed? I imagine that day being a really really good day. Was it amazing to look down and see your new form?? üòÅ

Wishing you the best! I was pretty nervous too, but that&#39;s normal!
</p>
<p>
Tbh, I brought my switch and ipad, but didn&#39;t have the wear with all to play any games, much less concentrate on anything else. My surgery was during election week so I&#39;d occasionally check in. But honestly I was so drugged up and tired that it was hard to do anything. The nurses would come in every few hours to take my vitals or change an IV (including in the middle of the night). Sufficed to say I didn&#39;t get a ton of good sleep either.
</p>
<p>
Getting my packing removed was a huge relief, mostly for the pain. It was nice seeing my new vag, but it was a bit of a trainwreck. It was swollen and there  was lots of bodily liquids oozing out. I wish I could say things were prettier. Even today, things are a bit swollen and groady (esp with my popped stitches) but things are shaping up to how I would expect, and that makes me happy!

I live in the greater Boston Area and I&#39;m in line for genital remodeling with Oates and Slama in about 6 months. Anything I should be aware of?

Yeah, this set looks painfully familiar.
</p>
<p>
So now you do just blue? Or just purple and then blue?

Are you using metrogel as antibiotics? Apparently it seems everyone has to do that. Which I think they should tell u bc I felt like I got infection over a weekend and was so stressed out. Then I found out both of my friends had to be on it, too.
</p>
<p>
Everytime ive been Slama is like oh this is fine no problems here ‚Äî when I went for infection I literally packed a bag bc I thought I‚Äôd have to be readmitted! I‚Äôm 6 weeks today ‚Äî using 2nd dilator for 5 min then the 3rd one after that. And down to twice a day dilating. I feel like I should be further along for dilatorwise but I‚Äôm further than both of my friends who had surgery like a month and like 2 weeks before me

I have the metrogel and an oral antibiotic. Dr Slama and the PA (Caroline Luce) basically told me 50% of cases generally get an infection, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I did down the road. I&#39;ve been changing pads rather frequently and wipe down my area with baby wipes after every BM. I also make it a point to shower and douche daily.
</p>
<p>
I think it&#39;s stressful because I don&#39;t know what to expect. Dr. slama has continued to tell me I&#39;m doing fine...so I guess I will just have to believe him!

Also make sure u have the vaginal metrogel ‚Äî the doctor who was with dr Slama gave me the wrong one that I used for 2 weeks which was irritating.
