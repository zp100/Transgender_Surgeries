I wanted to share my experience with getting my psych evals in Thailand before my SRS as well as getting SRS while self-medicating, I don&#39;t think this will be too helpful but I was really nervous and figured it could be helpful. Full disclosure I had SRS at PAI through a concierge service called Estetica Thailandia, I chose to do this because I was young and going alone and felt it would be useful to have someone in my corner. My consultant Charee was with me during a lot of stressful moments and while I most definitely could have experienced them alone it was nice not to.
</p>
<p>
Anyway back to the psych eval, here is some important context: I wore a dress to the evaluation like we are normally told to do but not much makeup (literally just mascara), my voice and face generally pass but we had to wear masks. I did have a short and masculine haircut and I had one letter from a therapist that was like a year old. Charee was in the evaluations with me to help with the language barrier. I was over Thailand&#39;s age of majority (20) but not by much, I&#39;m not sure if my age helped or hurt me. Also, I can&#39;t remember if they asked about my sexual orientation but I only like men.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, it was mostly just an interview, the first psychologist was very clinical she asked me about how long I’d been transitioning, how long I’d been on hormones, if I had ever had a relationship, how long I’d “known,” if I planned on getting other surgeries, I honestly don’t remember much of her questions but they were very trans 101. She did ask about my hair but I had told Charee this big thing about how it was a spiritual cut (like after a breakup) and she kindly explained it to the psychiatrist. She asked why I hadn’t changed my passport marker and I told her I couldn’t change it without surgery where I was (I’m not sure if this is actually true or not but she didn’t check).
</p>
<p>
The 2nd psychiatrist was much more casual, he was mostly reassuring me that I’d be in good hands having surgery here in Thailand and wishing me luck. He did ask me if I had an endocrinologist and I said that I did*, there was no double-checking. He noted that I looked and sounded like a woman (I think &#34;like a woman&#34; in this context just means feminine) and then asked me if I planned to have any other surgeries, I told him no. After he wished me good luck one more time we went off to receive the letters and pay.
</p>
<p>
Expanding on the self-medicating part,  I really didn&#39;t have any issues, my surgeon Dr. Burin asked me during the consultation if I had an endocrinologist which caught me off guard so I worryingly said &#34;Not right now&#34; and he just asked me about what I took and then took the time to explain what I wouldn&#39;t need to take after surgery, I&#39;m very sensitive to conflict so in my mind, it was a tense situation but to most, it likely wasn&#39;t, I&#39;m pretty sure I had paid them by that point and hormones and endocrinologists were not brought up again.
</p>
<p>
All in all, things were not as stressful as I was anticipating which was nice but I can&#39;t say whether or not it was due to Charee&#39;s presence, my ability to pass, or even my age. Which is one of the reasons I&#39;m not sure if this is helpful. In my own personal opinion, the gatekeeping from the psychiatrists isn&#39;t too bad if you&#39;re a &#34;binary&#34; trans woman who is willing to present feminine for the evaluation, put up with some questions, and has common sense. At least for the psychiatrists, you see for PAI, they didn&#39;t run me through the wringer or ask about my sex practices. That being said if you cannot bring a letter from a psychologist like me, I&#39;d really recommend bringing some form of a letter mine was very simple and I got it from a therapist/social worker. The only other thing I&#39;d say is if you&#39;ve been transitioning for a while choose between dates and years when answering questions and stick to it (I started transitioning in 2014 vs I started transitioning 8 years ago) I used both interchangeably and started to get things mixed up, luckily it didn&#39;t cause any issues but still the stress I felt wasn&#39;t nice!
</p>

*I am not endorsing or encouraging lying during your psych eval or self-medicating up to/beyond SRS in fact I discourage it but to those who are doing it for whatever reason I see you.

Thank you for sharing. How did you come to use a concierge service in the first place?
