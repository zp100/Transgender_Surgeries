Hi,
</p>
<p>
Just feeling a little depressed at the moment and don&#39;t know if I&#39;m just being paranoid. I deal with social anxiety at the best of times.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a few days post OP GRS with Dr Bank of Suporn Clinic and still in the hospital on bed rest, but has anyone who&#39;s been here recently found some of the nurses bedside manner to be lacking?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s making me afraid to ask for any assistance or pain relief.
</p>
<p>
Some of the nurses who&#39;ve checked in on me have been lovely, but others have been quite rude. This evening when doing my blood pressure and temperature the nurse told me I had a fever and then just...walked out. Is that not something that should be followed up on?
</p>
<p>
There have been another few little annoying things like moving my bedside table and drink away from me despite being here on my own and not being able to move so I&#39;m not really drinking much. Afraid to speak out because I don&#39;t want them to treat me worse..
</p>
<p>
Can&#39;t fault the Suporn staff themselves but yeah, the hospital nurses aren&#39;t making me feel great...
</p>
<p>
Am I be paranoid? Have I upset the nurses somehow (despite not asking for anything!!!!)? Dunno...
</p>

I had really good experiences with them so this seems really odd, that was 3 years ago though. Honestly, just ask for what you want and need unapologetically, they are literally there to look after you and meet your needs.

Never bitch out your nurse. If something isn&#39;t feeling right, tell them, if they don&#39;t remember something, remind them, or ask them questions if something isn&#39;t clear.
</p>
<p>
Being nice or at least respectful to your nurses will go a looong way. But express yourself don&#39;t bottle it up. You deal with social anxiety and feeling overwhealmed with some of the unknowns in your care? Tell them. Nurses literally are there to help you help yourself.
</p>
<p>
I guess I&#39;m saying that if you aren&#39;t having a need met, speak up. But don&#39;t act defensive with your caregiver if it&#39;s just a misunderstanding. Some nurses are more attentive than others but you still have to advocate for yourself. Don&#39;t assume your nurse knows how you are feeling.

When the nurse tells you Fever, it is simply an indication of over range for temperature. This then written on your med card and reported for Dr. visit in the morning ( rounds).
</p>
<p>
Some staff suffer with very little english and are embarrassed about it. I will speak to staff about moving table too far away this morning, or you could ring them by pressing buzzer to nurses&#39;s station and indicate you want moved closer.

I had a similar experience at Samitivej. When taking off my pressure bandages post FFS the nurses ripped alot of my hair out and caused me to almost faint. It was pretty upsetting as i was literally yelling at them to stop due to the pain. They ended up sedating me (im assuming with valium?) with no verbal communication given. Was unsure what to think but maybe its just a cultural difference. I didnt say anything and the rest of my recovery was drama free.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes on your recovery and hope you enjoy the rest of your stay!

I had some trouble at first because one narky older nurse wasn&#39;t happy about last minute change booking to the Hospital 6 days earlier than planned. Dr Suporn wanted to limit my COVID risk by minimizing my pre-op days at the Rattanachol, plus he wanted even more heart tests. This upset my plans as I couldn&#39;t get needed supplies and meet some people I&#39;d arranged at the the Rat. I was really miserable, I expect it may have been the prolonged stress of so many cancelled operations over the last 2 years all coming to a head.
</p>
<p>
But later I met Dr Suporn, he was so kind and friendly with such a loving touch. Then Dr Dilaka, possibly one of the most friendly persons I&#39;ve ever met, it was like we were old friends chatting away and joking after after about 1 minute. PIus so experienced and competent, really made me me feel so much more confident about the procedure. I explained I may have a bit of a tolerance to oxycodone so whatever she&#39;s been giving me is the ant&#39;s pants.
</p>
<p>
Haven&#39;t had any pain at all since operation on Thursday.Whenever I ask the nusrses now about what I&#39;m getting they say it&#39;s morphine. Although earlier they gave me another one which is a strong non opioid one.
</p>
<p>
I gave the nurses and cleaning staff little choccies before my op ,  they&#39;ve been really sweet although the language barrier is too often  frustratiing.
</p>
<p>
I had  temperature this evening: &#34;You have fever&#34;, so I started singing Donna Summe Hot Love. They got all excited and said we would go to Pattaya and dance the 3 of us. Their confidence about how quickly I could recover seems  super exaggerated but the thought was nice.Didn&#39;t seem like concerned at all  about my age  althhough I think I&#39;d give the the drug du jour a miss. A friend I went to  school with who was a doctor used to give me thse liitle Captagon pills, they were good for dancing.
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s really getting to you, reach out to the Suporn Clinic on the Line app and explain your concerns. I did that when I was very miserable on the first day and everything was very much better after that. I believe they have a fair amount of rapport and influence with the Hospital.

Your paying a really large amount of money, If a nurse was slightly rude to me I&#39;d go full Karen on their asses.

If you do that in Thailand youâ€™d seriously regret it.

I&#39;m a nursing student and I can tell you that I forget things all the time. Like moving a bed side table back in reach of a pt escapes my mind almost every time I leave a room. Some of those nurses might just be kinda spacey (like me! lol) so don&#39;t be afraid to speak up for yourself.
</p>
<p>
But, you also know what it feels like to interact with them and if they are being rude otherwise, I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having to deal with that. You deserve compassionate care from your health care team.
