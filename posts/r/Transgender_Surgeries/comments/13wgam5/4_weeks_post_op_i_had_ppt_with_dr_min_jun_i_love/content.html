It did not hurt, was more so a bit of stomach discomfort. They go into my stomach with a laparoscopic robot and get the peritoneal lining of my stomach to line the vaginal canal, instead of just penile skin with Penile Inversion.

Wow, she looks so amazing! For such a short time postop I don&#39;t think you couldn&#39;t ask for a better result. All the essential bits seem to be so well done. Excellent asthetics. Congratulations!! üíúüíõ‚ù§Ô∏èüíöü©µü§éüñ§ü©∂ü§ç

That is a stellar result. I love the attention to detail that he uses to define the labia. The swelling is relatively low at this point. The stiches are just an annoyance because the incisions look like they healed well. You should feel pretty darn good about this result.

I hope I can schedule out farther though because I&#39;ve not even started electrolysis. The job I&#39;m in is the first that I not just tolerate but enjoy that has insurance coverage for GAS.

Don‚Äôt pay to much attention to those opinions. There is some people on here based off what I‚Äôve been told that have been spreading misinformation about how he is as a surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I am on a discord with a lot of other patients of his, that are scheduled for surgery and have had surgery with him.
</p>
<p>
Since my initial zoom consult with him he has been very professional, knowledgeable and has made me feel comfortable with moving forward with him.
</p>
<p>
I had a in person consult with him as well and his demeanor was the exact same, he moves quickly so you‚Äôll want to pay attention. It has nothing to do with not caring and feeling rushed, he is a busy surgeon, just need to relax, listen and take what he has to say in, and he asks if you have questions so be prepared to know what you want to ask, he knows what he is doing and I felt very at ease knowing that and from the amount of research I‚Äôve done on him.
</p>
<p>
I have not had any issues with him, he has cracked a few jokes with me and my partner as well. People need to remember he is a surgeon, he has a job to do and is professional. I do not regret anything. I am extremely happy with him, his PA Alex and everyone at the crane center. If you have any other questions you can DM me.

Ok, as unrealistic as it may seem to you. I know the experience I went through, do you need the confirmation from my surgeon? Lol. I had no pain from the surgery, only minor discomfort in my stomach from the gas due to the robot that was used, my pain was managed very well. Everyone‚Äôs body and pain tolerance is different. üëåüèºüëçüèº

Definitely not self soothing misinformation. I wouldn‚Äôt be lying to others who are interested in having this procedure especially with this surgeon. This was my experience with this surgery and how my recovery has been.

I don‚Äôt really pay much attention to what I‚Äôve read on here by others who have said different things than what I‚Äôve experienced with him, and I‚Äôm on a discord with other patients of his who have had the same experience I have had. He‚Äôs professional and cares for his patients and he‚Äôs an amazing surgeon. You have to be a bit naive to think one persons experience is going to be the same for everyone, a lot of people need to understand that everyone‚Äôs healing and pain tolerance is different, but your surgeon also plays a big role in that and that‚Äôs why choosing a great surgeon should be a top priority. I highly recommend him for this surgery.

I had nearly no pain and didn‚Äôt need much pain medication from day 1. Only 2400mg Ibuprofen/advil a day. So not unrealistic at all.

Sorry for scrolling through your profile but I saw your recent post and noticed that it looked like your surgeon used a very similar technique to my surgeon, but it looked amazing without the swelling. I‚Äôm about 4 or 5 weeks post-op so I wanted to see if we looked similar and sure enough, we do! Makes me really exited for my healing.
