I had vaginoplasty with a peritoneal graft in July of last year and the healing process has been a nightmare. I&#39;ve lost confidence in my surgeon to correct these issues, and I&#39;m looking for surgeon recommendations.
</p>
<p>
Functional problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Vaginal depth is extremely shallow at maybe 3 inches. The peritoneal graft tore from the scrotal graft early in the healing process, and dilation became unbearably painful and scary. Granulation tissue formed at the area (which thankfully my surgeon did treat). Unfortunately, I&#39;m left with a barely functional canal. The peritoneal graft is still there, but it atrophied and I haven&#39;t been able to regain the added depth. My surgeon is afraid of tearing and causing a rectal fistula if she dilates it under anesthesia. As I said, I&#39;ve lost confidence in her, and would honestly rather someone else fix it anyway.
</li>
<li>
Urethra opening points forward (towards clitoris) instead of out. This combined with the meatus issue, mentioned below, causes the stream to either spray on the toilet seat or run all over my butt with my legs close together and leaning forward. There&#39;s no steady stream. It&#39;s a mess and demoralizing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Cosmetic problems (in order):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Labia minora terminates above the vaginal opening instead of below
</li>
<li>
Labia minora begins above the clitoris instead of branching from below the glans
</li>
<li>
No discernable clitoral hooding
</li>
<li>
There&#39;s little to no labia minora in general
</li>
<li>
Meatus of the urethral opening is overly pronounced or &#34;puffy&#34;
</li>
<li>
Clitoris just looks weird imo. It&#39;s large as looks like the tip of a penis instead of a button
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Most days I wish I&#39;d never gone through with the surgery. I honestly regret it. I wish I&#39;d waited and paid out of pocket for a more experienced surgeon, but I&#39;m hoping I can find a surgeon to fix it and change my mind. It doesn&#39;t look anything like a cis vulva. The only redeeming factors are I no longer have old bits and it is sensate (thankfully). I don&#39;t blame or resent my surgeon. She&#39;s fairly new and there were many factors at play. Also, it&#39;s not the worst surgical result I&#39;ve ever seen. So, please, if anyone can give me a good recommendation, I would greatly appreciate it.

Dr. Ng. Don&#39;t get me wrong, she is a fantastic doctor. The problems are due to bad luck and very limited donor material. I just don&#39;t think she has the level of experience I&#39;d like for the revision.

might be a few hints and Wittenberg may be another possibility. She has also experience with peritoneal techniques and to my knowledge also with revisions.

i&#39;m so sorry to read of your experience. i wish you all of the best.
</p>
<p>
of the six issues you recounted, i brought every one as a what if to Dr Ng&#39;s attention &amp; also expressed my concerns with spraying in a meeting prior to my vulvoplasty. in our second and in the third meeting by phone,i asked about appearance, clitoral hood and for a second time, what i referred to as a &#34;dimple&#34; - i&#39;ve been anxious to rid myself of my antediluvian appendage and wanted no semblance of it to remain; and most importantly, the possibility of necessary revisions and she said, as i recall, the labia might be an issue and to wait at least six months. apparently unlike dr garcia at Cedars, she appeared willing to dig in and was confident and seemed to be able to produce what i anticipated and desired. my surgery btw had been postponed once by Leo who fucked up the scheduling and three other times because i didn&#39;t have a &#34;support group&#34; in place. like you, i still trust her ability as a surgeon. the photos of her work that i&#39;ve seen were better than most and one was just encouraging and delightful. Very Best of luck getting what you need.  Safe journeys. Take good care.

Yes, her bedside manner and attention to my concerns are what sold me. Aesthetically, I don&#39;t know if any other surgeon would have been able to do better. I just didn&#39;t have much to work with. She was the first to bring up the peritoneal graft. I may ask her if she&#39;s willing to reattempt the graft. It only closed, like I said, because the stitch tore and became painful to dilate. The depth I have currently just isn&#39;t acceptable, and I can&#39;t imagine that would happen again. Besides, if she won&#39;t do it, I&#39;ll just go to Wittenberg some time down the road.

I didn&#39;t like Dr. Garcia&#39;s bedside manner but to each their own.

To be honest, compared to other surgeons&#39; results I&#39;ve seen, mine actually looks a lot better than most. I just want to be very careful with the revision since I don&#39;t have much material to work with. I want to find the best surgeon possible if that makes sense. I&#39;m picky and would probably feel the same no matter who I went to. I would honestly recommend Dr. Ng to anyone considering GRS.
</p>
<p>
I guess I want a cis vagina, and that will never happen. I&#39;m also not happy with my breast surgery. I realize I&#39;m a perfectionist. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve decided to hold off on the revision surgery and do a lot more research. I&#39;ll probably go back to Dr. Ng for the urinary issue, but nothing cosmetic.

For the sake of plausible deniability, I&#39;ll never confirm it, but you may or may not be able to find a photo if you search

Hi Sojourney
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Normally a wound needs time for full recovery healing (1-3months). If you have big granulation, I recommend excise it,
</li>
</ol>
<p>
2.For cosmetic revision genitalia surgery I recommend wait more than 6 months

Hi Dr Kanit,
</p>
<p>
You are welcome to post here - just please try to be helpful and don&#39;t try to sell your services too much (it would probably cause a bad reaction). I put your full name in your flair (the yellow background text) so people always know who you are.
</p>
<p>
You could comment on this post if you like - it is a surgery you did.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/g1oni4/i_could_really_see_my_penis_is_officially_gone/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/g1oni4/i_could_really_see_my_penis_is_officially_gone/
</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you like you could make an AMA post. On reddit AMA means Ask Me Anything, and it invites people to ask you questions about anything. You can see some examples here
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/">https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/
</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is an example that a patient made about her surgery
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fd2uzf/6_days_postop_with_dr_bluebondlangner_peritoneal/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fd2uzf/6_days_postop_with_dr_bluebondlangner_peritoneal/
</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But do not post it in that sub, post it here in this sub.
</p>
<p>
I recommend if you do an AMA post that you visit the sub regularly over 2 days to answer questions. Its not very busy here so you won&#39;t get many questions per hour. Also let me know if/when you plan to do this so that I can be here to make sure everything goes ok. Sometimes people break the rules of this sub - so if you see anything very rude/offensive please ignore it and I will fix it. Please also expect that people may ask you questions about other surgeons in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
A good title for an AMA post would be &#34;I am Thai surgeon Dr Kanit Wittayanichai. AMA&#34;. Without the quotes.
</p>
<p>
By the way, I don&#39;t think many people here would know what 55 means. Its a very Thai expression.
