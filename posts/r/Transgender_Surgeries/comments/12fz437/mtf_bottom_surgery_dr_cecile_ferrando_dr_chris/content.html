6 mo post PPT with Dr Gupta here.  Very happy with my results.  He typically works with Dr Rachel Pope on bottom surgery, she does the aesthetics and he does the internals.
</p>
<p>
McClung and Ferrando only offer PI afaik.  And McClung recently left OSU to start his own practice I think?  Not entirely certain, I recall hearing he&#39;s still in the process of setting up with insurance.

Dr. Ferrando was absolutely amazing with my procedure, and everything leading up to it.  I&#39;m six weeks this Thursday.

As a follow-up!

If there&#39;s any complications then they leave you out to dry.

I believe her current take on my concerns are that my &#34;communication methods are too harsh&#34; and I need to fix my attitude

Consultation? Like a month.
</p>
<p>
Actual surgery? A good bit longer than that...

Like 6 months? A year? I&#39;m in a predicament because there is a possibility though admittedly slim that my insurance won&#39;t be available as an option next year. I won&#39;t be at a BMI low enough until around 6 months however. Come to think of it she probably requires hair removal which takes longer than 6 months :(

McClung does PI only. He just started a private practice. Itâ€™s super nice and easy to navigate. Itâ€™s in the short north in Columbus.

hiiii ðŸ‘‹. I&#39;ve been in the process of getting a consultation with Dr. Ferrando and I&#39;ve posted about what the exact requirements are here recently. I&#39;ve consulted with Dr. Gupta and his team are pretty great and I think anyone would be in good hands with him. However I&#39;m really picky on the aesthetic side of things and I&#39;m trying to weigh Dr. Ferrando vs Dr. Pope&#39;s aesthetics. I&#39;m in the same position as you with preferring my surgeon to be a woman, but Dr. Gupta is not at all an asshole or hard to deal with from what I&#39;ve heard and my impression of meeting him so I wouldn&#39;t rule him out because of that lol. you can find some videos he&#39;s posted here
<a href="https://youtu.be/h2kIPgdbaZ4" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/h2kIPgdbaZ4</a>
Will also mention that Gupta&#39;s waiting list is prettyyy short for surgery and consult so it&#39;s definitely worth a shot meeting with him. And unlike Dr. Ferrando he does not extraneous requirements for getting a consult
</p>
<p>
Edit: Gupta told me he does the canal around 80 percent with peritoneum. Ferrando is gonna be usual PIV.

Afaik Dr. McClung only does PIV surgery. I also think the only way to see his results is a with a consultation. I was VERY overweight when I tried to get a consult and of course it went no where (as it should be) but he was very friendly and personable. I&#39;m in Columbus so it was close. Unfortunately he&#39;s not on my Medical Mutual insurance which is crazy because Dr. Bowers is lol. I had a consult with Dr. Hanna in Texas yesterday and can get scheduled for the end of August but I still have some things I need to work out. He has a fairly short wait (3-4 months, but I need to lose about 40 lbs). I imagine he takes your insurance but don&#39;t take my word for it *Reading Rainbow Sound* :D
</p>
<p>
A good friend of mine had her surgery done with Dr. Ferrando and she&#39;s seems to be very happy with the results. She ALSO isn&#39;t on my insurance lol. I hope that this helps a little.
</p>
<p>
Update: Dr. Ferrando IS on my insurance! I called today and left a message to schedule a consultation.

My work just switched to UHC for our health insurance so Iâ€™m happy to hear this surgeon is in network for me for at least another year.
