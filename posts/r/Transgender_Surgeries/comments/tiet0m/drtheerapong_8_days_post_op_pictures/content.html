So Cherry comes twice a day and remove stitches day by day, some are ready to be removed some other are still gluing with my skin, it doesn&#39;t hurt as Cherry is amazing. It is just a tiring process with a bit of sensitive issue but I am confident with her workflow
</p>
<p>
tonight I have manage to poo a bit and now I am just doing good with paracetamol 💪💪

Siamtransformative is a private clinic that works with Dr.Theerapong, you just have to message then on Facebook and that&#39;s it. they will bring you to doctor consultation, they will provide you everything and take by car whenever you need. Cherry is the wound specialist, Becky is the logistic boss and driver and she take cares of bureaucracy and Shapira is the psychological support
</p>
<p>
for PPT I&#39;ve spent about 16,500€ care package includes colon cost less

Thank you sis you saved my budget 😭😭😭❤❤❤ Thank you so much!!

<p>
I really appreciate you wrote this in bed..😭😭
</p>
<p>
Have had very enough time for surgery consultants before you get into surgery?
</p>
<p>
As Eg isn&#39;t my main may i ask you what means &#34; colon cost less&#34;...?
</p>
<p>
16500 is quite reasonable prices, is there any thing you need to pay extra fee like if they pick you up to drive to someplace..?

16.500€ includes all the pre-during-after care package driver and everything, but that&#39;s for PPT, colon sigmoid is cheaper

I was about to not choosing him since many  friends told me that they haven&#39;t had opportunities for discussing the overall procedure of Srs or the aesthetic preferences of the vulva shap they wanted with Dr. Theerapong even the day before the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if you had enough time to talk with him for your surgery

whaaat? my consultation lasted about 1 hour and doctor talked to me for very looooooong time. you can provide him pictures from thesexchange.org and tell what combination you prefer, he will told you what he can do based on your tissue. also his technique is not just bout aesthetic but there are precise functional and healing too.
</p>
<p>
he also came the night before surgery to draw me what he expected to obtain and once more right before surgery. he loves to speak so idk what your friends told you 😔😑

Hi, I have some questions about your experience with Dr. Teerapong (well, there are a lot of them, sorry for that), could you please help me? I plan go with him (for PPT): What made you choose Dr. Teerapong over other doctors? Do you recommend him? What technique did you have for your SRS and why? (Penile Skin Inversion with scrotal graft, scrotal graft, Sigmoid Colon or PPT) Did you have circumcision before your SRS? How do you consider your results in terms of aesthetics and sensitivity so far? What is your vaginal depth? How is the process of dilations? They are painful? Are you planning to have revision surgery? (You have very little time since your SRS and it looks great, when you are fully healed it will look perfect), and if so.. What would you improve your result with one? How was your stay in Thailand? How was the aftercare of Dr. Teerapong and the clinic staff in general? That&#39;s all for now, and by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.
</p>

I got PPT with him because his technique that may looks too big is just meant for reduce pain and having a faster recovery, I am out of painkillers on day 8, just paracetamol I was not circumcised and I have 7 inches of depth. Dilatation are not painful just a bit weird it feels like you have to poo, sometimes stitches removal stings like facial hairs. I booked via SIAMTRANSFORMATIVE so the aftercare is not the one you would have from the clinic but much much better. Hospital stay was the most painful part and not for surgery pain but due back spine pain (6 days in the same position). Thailand is not bad but we have to do 10 days quarantine and eat lot of shitty food

I am giving the top priority for aesthetic vulva shaping rather than anything elses and that&#39;s reason for choosing sigmoid colon as laparoscopy.. I would put more importance for the designing it as typical appearance of what cis gender girl has.
</p>
<p>
Would you recommend Theerapong than other docs regarding with aesthetic appearance ?

the bigger=the easier to recover and dilatate, the you can trim up later in your country if you want (it&#39;s a very cheap procedure)
</p>
<p>
doctor says better to have more and trim it later than having too few and then you can not add nothing later

oh no no insurance for me

I don&#39;t think its a good idea because the original surgeon is knows the anatomy of what they created. Other surgeons don&#39;t. Perhaps its not a problem, but since there&#39;s approximately zero posts about this do you want to take the risk?
</p>
<p>
Note also that cis women get botched sometimes doing this surgery, so you need to be really careful anyway.

Ah I see. Not really have an appointment fir that on 25th. Currently a nurse does wound care at the hotel but under the week I will go to clinic for that too. Then maybe they&#39;ll remove some before that too.

Cherry told me that the more you took out the better, as with time they could glue on your skin, maybe you can ask your nurse

Thank you so much for sharing, wow, 8 days and look how good that looks, you also don&#39;t hear much about him so sharing this is appreciated.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m surprised he doesnt use disssovable stitches. So Siam has been good? Were you alone there?

yeah he uses dissolvable but cherry says it&#39;s better to take them out all of them as dissolvable may lead to a dull area and it will increase swelling time

it depends on stitches, if they are left inside scarring will be bad, but Siamtransformative manage to remove them before anything could happens

idk as I don&#39;t have the full sensation back but  compared to my idea of vagina is lower, I mean I always thought penetration occurs way upper so first time I was &#34;oh wow so it&#39;s so low&#34; it feels like very close to bowel etc

<p>
That&#39;s because the dilator is rubbing against the wall of the bowel. The neo-vagina obviously has to take into account the internal male anatomy but as said, with some surgeries the entrance to the vagina often looks to be very low. Aesthetically this doesn&#39;t look very nice, making it less &#34;female&#34; than one would like IMO.

people are concerned to have too high some other to having too down, I can confirm that boys will never notice the difference ehehehe

Yes true but there must be a good compromise. I think that even for a CIS an empty bowel would always be more comfortable and for those of an adventurous nature it might be essential. Enjoy!

consider that I never had an empty bowel since discharge as I can&#39;t push to poo everything out

<p>
well I think that you body is gonna be used to it and adjust itself, it&#39;s amazing what a body can do, really you will surprises, these days I have felt that my bodies are more prone to shapeshifting that we can imagine (Spinoza told this to us centuries ago now I can confirm that ahahahah)

eiii, you can find more updates on my profile, the last one I made 9months postop is pretty much the same as now, expected I manage to lubricate a bit more and I have less red area. Would definitely recommend doctor thee
