Her portfolio really seems good, very subtle but substantial changes in features. I also like how she describes her method, she does CT scans (skin, veins, nerves) and makes a model of your skull and practices on it beforehand both 3d and real (idk maybe everybody does this actually lol?). And the prices are just amazing!
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t like how at first their site was down, then their email address turned out not to be in order, then she didn&#39;t reply for a while on Instagram, then on WhatsApp she didn&#39;t answer 90% of my questions, and her English is kind of bad... So idk... But I talked to one girl that has a YouTube video talking about ffs that she did in this clinic, she says it was all great.

This is the clinic&#39;s website

Oh I&#39;ve seen some voice before/after on Instagram, impressive! Where did you stay while in Moscow, and how long did you stay?

I was in Moscow approx. 1 week. I stayed in a hotel most of the time and just one night in a hospital after surgery. If you will fly there do not forget to ask for invitation at the clinic because foreigners are not allowed to came into russia now because of covid(only if you have work visa, residence card or medical invitation)

How much did you pay for the hotel stay? Did you travel by taxi or public transportation? Thanks for the advice :)

I don&#39;t remember exactly but something like 500-550 usd in total including breakfast for one week.
</p>
<p>
I used taxi and subway. It is not very expensive. Like 1-2 usd per trip and taxi to airport is ~15-20 usd

Hey, I was wondering if you could share your experiences with them after a longer period of time, I&#39;ve read some other comments in a deleted thread that it didn&#39;t help much or something? I&#39;m thinking about that surgeon too, mainly for FFS, but them offering Femlar also caught my attention, but it seems there&#39;s not much info when looking around Reddit for results, so could you share some more info about your experience? Thank you üôè

Hi. I do not think that I have a lot of information to share. The surgery itself was almost three years ago. I was sick approx. two weeks after surgery and I think that this negatively influenced the surgery result. At the beginning of this year I started to work with a logopedist and this improved my voice quality.

Hows the end result? Do you like it, was it worth? Did it all come out fine once you worked on it now? Also did you have any more checkups with surgeon after the surgery in following days or someone else took care of it? Sorry for so many questions again, but thanks for information üòä
</p>
<p>
It seems like it&#39;s quite a complex surgery. So on one hand I&#39;d love a more feminine voice, especially at a price I could afford since it doesn&#39;t seem that expensive there, but I&#39;m wondering if they took care of it after OP too, I think I&#39;ve read online that when they do that surgery in US they check up on you in following days a lot for signs of infections do something.

No, I did not have any checkups after I left them. It was tricky to go to ruzzia during Covid times and then they decided to start the war and I do not want to come there anymore. I know that she is moved to Armenia but I have other, more important things that I need to do right now. I&#39;m still working with a logopedist, so I can&#39;t say anything about the final results, sorry. Right now my voice is better than it was before the surgery and right after.

Tbh you couldn&#39;t pay me to go to Russia. If the media is anything to believed they take homo/transphobia to a whole other level.

Well my country (Serbia) also has a very bad reputation for being conservative and nationalistic and homophibic and I&#39;ve never had a problem being a little feminine boy although I do keep a low profile in public and maybe pass for straight guy on the street and not dress or act too flamboyant... So in that sense, for me I think Moscow should be fine, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to wave a pride flag on the Red square... (if I were visibly trans then I would be afraid anywhere except Northern Europe )  Moscow is a huge huge metropolis, I am more afraid of getting robbed and lost.

Granted you have much more experience with that culture. I spent a brief time in Russia and while I was not an out transgender tourist, I found most people I met to be quite warm and welcoming.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, I was followed repeatedly. Mostly muggers looking for an opportunity, I think. Russia was interesting, but it was always hard to detect what was under the surface. It&#39;s not the kind of place I would recommend to anyone who cannot travel inconspicuously.

That&#39;s exactly what I kinda expect, friendly locals who find foreigners interesting, and ofc as you go further away from the center, some petty criminals who might wanna rob you. As anywhere else, right?! I mean I&#39;ve heard many more dangerous stories from friends who went on Work &amp; travel program to the US (gunfires at the gas station, motorbike stolen from their yard, being chased by a psycho with a metal pole, missing people on billboards). But it would definitely be a good idea to connect with an LGBT local on couchsurfing to get some insider tips and tricks and to show me around maybe.

Definitely find a local. I had known local guides in Moscow and Novosibirsk and it made all of the difference in the world.

I&#39;m her patient, in my opinion she&#39;s one of the best, feel free to check my ig @missxronix. She did my forehead, my nose, replaced my wanky cheek implants, did my breasts, have plans to do some more work with her, but am awaiting for another procedure so will have a green light to continue with her. Totally recommend her!

It&#39;s nice to know that this doctor is legit. I think her before/afters are really amazing and it&#39;s great to know that someone is helping trans women in that part of the world. I was seriously a little worried that this was just some kind of bait to get trans people to come to Russia so they could be robbed, murdered or put in jail or something as I&#39;ve heard rumors of similar scams. But I guess that fear was unfounded this time
