Long time listener, first time caller.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been on HRT for 13 years, I&#39;m in my early 30s, medically insignificant otherwise (in good health and active), and recently was discharged from Henry Ford in Detroit after having PPT vaginoplasty with Dr. Tepper and Dr. Shakir. I had also previously gotten BA with Dr. Tepper in February of this year. I&#39;m posting this because there seems to be little to no information about this program on this subreddit.
</p>
<p>
Recovery consisted of 6 days in the hospital, and the first two were the worst days of my life. Pain, discomfort, loneliness, fatigue - mostly the pain. Day three a nurse helped me bathe, I finally got to eating, and woke up my digestive system.
</p>
<p>
From then on, it was a breeze. Kept up, moving, eating, watched a couple movies. Dilation has been easy except for a piece of raw skin just above my canal that is stopping me from sizing up, but I&#39;m putting Neosporin on it to encourage it to heal so I can. Speaking of, the team is incredibly responsive when you have questions - they&#39;ve never taken more than a few hours to get back to me.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t plan on posting pictures out of interest of my own privacy, but I will say that they were miracle workers. Aesthetically, I couldn&#39;t be happier. It&#39;s like they read my mind when I imagined it.
</p>
<p>
I have seen a few posts about the doctors listed not being the ones who perform the procedure. There was a whole team in the OR. I can confirm that Dr. Tepper and Dr. Shakir were the only surgeons working on me. I read the notes in their entirety.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m only just now a week after the surgery, so I&#39;ve got plenty of recovery to go, but the fact that all bruised and swollen and full of stitches it still looks amazing, I can&#39;t wait to see what I look like three months from now.
</p>
<p>
PS - Briar is the GOAT, I know you can&#39;t acknowledge me but I do hope you see this.

Hi! Thanks for sharing your experience :D
</p>
<p>
I was looking to go with Henry Ford as well. If I may ask,  how long did it take from initial consult to surgery date?

2 years 2 months. Do not take my case as usual in that regard - they weren&#39;t offering dates yet at the time of my initial consult, and of course, dates became first come first serve (those who had previous consults obviously got in before me).
</p>
<p>
Also there was a cancellation, I was originally scheduled for October but was bumped up.
</p>
<p>
I had not even started hair removal either, so I had to go through that first.

Thanks for sharing! May I ask, did you do electrolysis before? Is that linked to your surgeon and coverage in any way?

No. Laser. They recommend Kim Jarzembowski and I couldn&#39;t agree with their recommendation more. Insurance covered it but I had to submit detailed receipts for reimbursement (I didn&#39;t actually get any money back but it applied to my deductible. I have one of those &#34;we cover nothing until you hit deductible&#34; plans).

I see, so did you consult with the surgeon first and then get a referral? I’m just not really sure how to go about the process of getting electrolysis/laser done before srs of any kind
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the recommendation and info btw!

Congrats! Thanks for saying this, the docs at harbortown have been helping me with HRT and primary care since about a month ago. Would be really nice to see results, not asking for yours - but I want to check in, did you see any before you opted to go with them? If it&#39;s anything like B-L&#39;s work, I&#39;ll be super relieved I won&#39;t have to leave the city!
</p>
<p>
Also the other post in here got me very worried about HF and vaginoplasty so I&#39;m happy to hear someone has had good results!

I would be interested in your results also if you don’t mind. I’m getting my HRT through Henry Ford and would love to stay in the system.

I&#39;m so relieved to hear your success story about Dr. Shakir and Dr. Tepper. I have surgery scheduled with them in June after having to postpone a year, and I can&#39;t wait!
</p>
<p>
I had BA with Dr.Tepper a couple years ago. I had some complications, nothing due to her, but she was amazing at dealing with it all and put me and my family at ease at every turn.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve dealt with Briar a few times and they have been awesome!
