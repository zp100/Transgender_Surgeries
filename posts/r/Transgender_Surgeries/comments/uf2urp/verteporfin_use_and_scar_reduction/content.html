I&#39;ve been reading how trials for Verteporfin have been useful to reduce scar reduction after surgery. Has anyone used this for this purpose? If so how did you know what dosage to use and what was your method of use? Any help for this would be great because I have moderate scarring issues, they&#39;re often raised.

I think I was already a part of that group for a minute when I realized that there was only two people in there that did it and nobody seemed to know anything about DIY.

That’s because verteporfin was only recently discovered to have these anti fibrotic properties and strong evidence supporting scarless healing and hair follicle neogenesis. We are currently experimenting, you can’t expect anyone to have a perfect protocol when human trials aren’t yet completed, and verteporfin is a prescription only medication. I don’t mean to come off like a dickhead, I’m just saying you can’t expect a perfect DIY protocol yet when people are also experimenting solely for hair regrowth, not scarring. We have 178 people talking together every single day to establish a working protocol, and we are even working with medical professionals that I won’t talk too much about here. Please reconsider joining our group. Again, I don’t mean to come off rude in any way.

No it wasn&#39;t rude at all, but I had no idea what anybody was talking about at any point really. I&#39;m just a patient, not a chemist, so i felt lost

When I joined, I didn’t know much at all either. Feel free to join and ask any question, even the ones you may think are dumb questions. Very nice people in the group, from all over the world. I joined back in January when there were only 30 people. Took me a while to understand the basics, and that’s about as far as my knowledge goes with it lol. But it won’t take as long as it did for me to learn the basics, because we now have 148 more people and a lot of questions have been, and are still being answered.

We do have someone who tested it but you have to get all the materials including vert. All of that information is available in the group. Everything you would need. You just have to buy everything. But also please keep in mind it would be completely experimental because no one has tried our new protocol yet.

You&#39;ll definitely find guidance in that group. It&#39;ll also link you to other groups with more practical information on Verteporfin

That doesn&#39;t really help me. I was seeing if anybody has any first-hand experience with diy.
