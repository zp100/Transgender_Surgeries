I&#39;m at the one place you said is good. And they are definitely good!!! FT is the antithesis of that hack. Thank you for your candour. Snake oil salesman are everywhere, parasitic behavior is as rampant in transgender surgery as any other self-esteem industry. Be safe and glad you are better.

Honestly he just sounds like a complete sociopathic  narcissist who found a niche to easily manipulate into letting him take money and f**k around doing whatever he wants. What a parasitic monster.

He is scary. Interacting with him it is hard not to feel that he is an evil person

Dr Rumer is the same way too.  Neither of them should ever be allowed to talk to a trans person let alone perform surgery

sorry about your experience.
</p>
<p>
even if you did good research, sites like
<a href="https://realself.com">realself.com</a>
exist to provide propaganda and fake reviews to trick people... so its still possible that you&#39;d have though that VdV was safe.  (i think its only on reddit that i come across his negative reviews... way too many of them to not permanently take him off the list of surgeons i would ever use or recommend.)
</p>
<p>
pretty sure that your post here doesn&#39;t have enough information or meet the requirements to have any relevance for the paper you signed (which most courts wouldn&#39;t uphold to begin with anyway).

Im worried for you! He made you sign that and even tjo you wrote this, girl, you are so brave, but i do not want you to get in legal issues, you are a sweetheart and deserve to keep on living as nice as you can, trust me, legal problems take away happyness for some time, at least talk to a lawyer just in case please ❤.
</p>
<p>
On the second hand, thank you so much for this review, even tho stories like this have been rising, it is always important to add more, god bless you and Im so happy that you are doing great right now

It is totally possible. Or what do you think, that if you do something to someone else in a different country they would not be able to sue you or what?

International civil suits happen all the time.
</p>
<p>
Granted they are usually between corporations or between wealthy people (due to the costs to launch) but they are still civil suits, following the same court rules nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
The doctor doesn’t have to file the suit in Belgium but has the option (at extra cost) of filing in the US (and would do so do to the differences &amp; difficulties in enforcing a successful judgement had he filed in Belgium).

I saw seen him do this to a patient on Realself after he left a hole in someone&#39;s forehead --according to the patient posting, she had the images and her complaint seemed legit. All of that was overshadowed by his threatening post. They are in every way as bad as what you are describing. All I could see was a bully trying to threaten and scare someone from talking.
</p>
<p>
The bottom line is don&#39;t talk shit or lie about your Dr. or Providers. If what you say is true, or you believe it to be true, you have nothing to worry about. You are free to tell your story as you experienced it.

This is what I have been saying since Bart Van de Ven botched me and ruined my future. He is incompetent. He doesn&#39;t see us as humans but freaks to extort money from. Makes me wanna puke when others defend him just because they got lucky.
