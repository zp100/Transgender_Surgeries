I‚Äôm sorry you are going through that OP.  My surgeon is Heidi Wittenberg and I have the same issue. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my surgeons fault. Honestly, she did a really good job but anytime I‚Äôm having uti issues they can‚Äôt really do anything they‚Äôre like go see a urologist so that‚Äôs kind of lame. I‚Äôve already been through 5 courses of antibiotics in the last eight months.  My PCP is doing a whole culture and testing now and is gonna refer me to a urologist. What kind of lube do you use for dilation?  Make sure it‚Äôs not sugar based. I use surgilube since it‚Äôs bacteriostatic and prevents bacteria.  Also, I‚Äôve noticed when my sugar intake is high or if I‚Äôm just eating sugar, I tend to get infections a lot easier.  My surgeon recommended using the hydrogen peroxide mixed with water to spray after peeing and pat dry.  I feel like having a vagina is a huge learning curve that I‚Äôm still trying to figure out.

I&#39;m I was a CNA here in Indiana and Tennessee as for lube I highly suggest you use either a surgical lube (surgilube) or a water base lube now for the UTI  anything is possible when I start seeing the plastic surgeon for my Gender affirming surgery I will be asking the Urologist bunch of questions like I did with my plastic surgeon when I first meet her

This sounds common sense - but you‚Äôre wiping yourself correctly after using the bathroom?
</p>
<p>
Not trying to infantilize you or anything. E Coli is found in human feces. Could you be reaching too far back when you wipe (pat) your vulva after peeing? Or are you wiping frontwards after passing stool? (I had a girl who was doing this)
</p>
<p>
I assume a rupture in your colon would have been found by now, so that‚Äôs out.

Jesus love, I‚Äôm sorry. That sounds a bit rough.
</p>
<p>
But the diarrhea could explain the consistent E. coli infections. Especially if diarrhea is a natural state
</p>
<p>
Have you had the prolapse checked since discovery? Also. Just. Off the top of my head - have you tried one of those step stools that put your body in a more ‚Äúergonomic‚Äù position while using the toilet? I don‚Äôt use one - but I have a friend that swears it stopped her UTI‚Äôs. I assume it had something to do with how it slightly changes your position on the toilet.

I‚Äôm just a random uneducated Redditer so take this with a grain of salt but I believe that the vagina is supposed to have a natural microbiome that‚Äôs self cleaning and fights off some harmful infections. Cis woman are born with this so unless they douche it isn‚Äôt an issue for them but for trans woman we don‚Äôt have that, thus leaving a warm, wet pocket for bad microbes to flourish. I believe there‚Äôs a suppository you can get to kickstart a healthy microbiome.
</p>
<p>
Also, if anyone has more info, please add it. I am, again, just some random uneducated pre-op Redditer.

Yeah, you can &#34;seed&#34; the neo vagina. At least from what I have seen  from the experience of others. You can use the ph balancing suppositories to get that good lactobacillus in there and the bad bacteria out, just like cis vaginas. Some techniques seem to take to it easier than others, but ... ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through this.  I&#39;m in the same boat.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s more likely that your infections are self-sourced, either through fecal, oral, or vaginal cross-contamination.  In particular, it&#39;s possible your colovaginal mucosa is a reservoir for the uropathogenic bacteria that&#39;s giving you UTIs.  Standard urine cultures are qualitative, not genetic analyses, so it&#39;s also possible they could mistake another pathogen for E. coli.  Doing a high-quality vaginal microbiome genetic analysis could help elucidate that (and/or analyzing the DNA in your urine).
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t be too alarmed if you find &#34;unusual&#34; results; the colon is normally host to many commensals that can cause problems in other contexts (like infectious endocarditis), and due to the relatively high normal range of pH (5.5-7), it&#39;s unlikely lactic acid bacteria can establish &amp; sustain themselves in a colovagina.
</p>
<p>
I have Escherichia (0.53%) and Prevotella species, among Gemella (47%), Aggregatibacter, Granulicatella, Haemophilus, and others.  Juno.bio and Evva are two options I know of.  The former is 16S rRNA and the latter is shotgun metagenomics.  If you decide to do such an analysis, please share your results with the community.
</p>
<p>
Are you douching as well?  Douching adds a few potential vectors for infection/cross-contamination as I see it: introduction of exogenous fluid and mobilization of intravaginal pathogens towards the urethra.  Is it possible you could douche less often?  I have a discharge buildup issue, but I find that I can get away with doing it about once per week.
</p>
<p>
Peeing after douching and being more diligent about keeping yourself dry as the residual water is absorbed by your mucosa could help.  Make sure everything you use down there (including your hands) is clean and sanitary.  Douche with distilled water instead of tap water.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have much more for you.  Please reach out if you want to brainstorm. üíú

Mmhm!  Mind that, given the complete lack of robust data in colovaginas, we don&#39;t know what&#39;s &#34;normal&#34; and a microbiome like mine might actually be problematic (and just based on how the major species can behave, could definitely be in immunocompromised people, or if the opportunity presents itself for a systemic infection).  We&#39;re basically collective patient zero for figuring this stuff out.

It&#39;s a carbohydrate.  E. coli, which causes most UTIs, latches onto little mannosylated proteins that line the bladder, and they thus have a very similar shape to mannose.  The theory is that if you take mannose, some of the E. coli will latch onto it in your urine instead and help you flush it out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
EDIT:
</strong>
Minor PSA that some sources of mannose can annoyingly cause symptoms similar to UTIs, like retention and poor flow.

I don&#39;t understand why this is always said. If a cis woman loses her canal or it didn&#39;t form in the womb correctly, the same surgery is used for them too. There has to be more data somewhere.

You can go looking, but the data is not very thorough.  And in trans women, the limited data that actually examines neovaginas is generally bad news (e.g.,
<a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)02089-0/fulltext" rel="nofollow">diversion neovaginitis ‚Äî Wouter B. van der Sluis, et al</a>
).  No one unfortunately has done microbiome analysis in a robust way (to species abundance levels), but I suspect variance here is the major factor.  Bacterial neovaginitis if you will.
</p>
<p>
A trial is being conducted by Dr. McGinn for PI, using Good Clean Love&#39;s intravaginal products and Juno.bio for 16S rRNA sequencing, so maybe we&#39;ll get lucky for someone to fund basic microbiome research for everyone else.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, you&#39;re correct that it is often done for vaginal hypoplasia.  The distinction in that population is that there is often
<em>
some
</em>
part of the vaginal canal to which a colon segment is grafted, and there tends to be more space in the pelvis which I suspect reduces pressure on the neovaginal canal.  (I haven&#39;t looked at data specifically in complete vaginal atresia.)
</p>
<p>
All of the prolapse cases I&#39;ve seen lack a transition tissue to the colon graft ‚Äî the anastomosis sits directly at the introitus.  There&#39;s also interesting theory to explore, but it&#39;s largely matching to essentially-equivalent pathologies like diversion colitis, or going a bit more foundational to, e.g., the oxygen hypothesis (chronic inflammation and dysbiosis triggered by low levels of intraluminal oxygen breaking homeostatic functions).
</p>
<p>
In addition, with a whole-canal lining of full-thickness colonic tissue, it appears to retain all of its usual functions (varying as to the exact region that&#39;s used), including water absorption and secretion of potassium and bicarbonate, which buffer acidity, thus (on paper and anecdatally) presents a hurdle for lactic acid bacteria becoming dominant.  Where some natal vaginal mucosa is present, the glycogen from cell turnover might be enough to maintain a LAB-dominant microbiome and thus more acidic pH from lactic acid, but it&#39;s complicated and understudied (a key component in the oxygen hypothesis / lack of oxygen consumption by fatty acid oxidation in colonocytes is a switch to lactic acid metabolism).
</p>
<p>
Because the data is so scant, I can&#39;t tell you precisely why people with vaginal hypoplasia/atresia seem to have a better time.  It could be similarly underreported that they&#39;re having a bad time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
EDIT
</strong>
(afterthought): We do have evidence of diversion colitis in cis children with hypoplasia/atresia who are treated with colovaginoplasty, where it seems to have a higher rate of occurrence.  Interestingly, we also know in very early adolescence the GI microbiome goes through a sequence of changes with selective dominance of different species and profiles until microbiome maturity, and it also differs dramatically between C section and vaginal births, which based on my research is very likely to impact colovaginoplasty outcomes as the leading implication for diversion colitis (the principal longterm illness of concern) is essentially dysbiosis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
EDIT
</strong>
: I figured I&#39;d add two more refs to Wouter B. van der Sluis, since they have been putting out a lot of work and are a prominent Dutch gender-affirming surgeon.  These are supportive papers (both paywalled) for their exploration of diversion neovaginitis (functionally equivalent to diversion colitis, commonly of the sigmoid).
</p>
<p>
van der Sluis uses the sigmoid for colovaginoplasty, and so focuses on these cases in their research.  I recall an unrelated paper (which I don&#39;t have on hand atm) showing the colon&#39;s dependence on butyric acid for local energy use increases distally, so it&#39;s possible ascending colon- or transverse colon-derived neovaginas might be less susceptible to this pathology.  Butyric acid and mesalamine (an anti-inflammatory) are well-known ameliorative approaches to both diversion colitis and in this presentation of neovaginitis, though it doesn&#39;t work as well, or at all, in advanced cases.
</p>
<p>
Basically, it&#39;s bad news, but it doesn&#39;t appear in all cases, and we don&#39;t have a complete explanation as to why.  It does tend to develop with time, same as with diversion colitis.  This underexplored territory represents a ticking time bomb in my opinion.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Results:¬†Bacterial samples were obtained from 28 patients who underwent sigmoid vaginoplasty. By principal coordinate analysis, microbial profiles of samples from the sigmoid-derived neovagina were distinctively different from rectal samples. Partial least squares discriminant analysis showed that the most discriminative species derived from the phylum Bacteroidetes. The abundance and diversity of Bacteroidetes species were reduced following fecal stream diversion compared with rectal samples (median Shannon diversity index of 2.76 vs. 2.18, P&lt;0.01). Similar abundance of Phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria was observed.

I&#39;ll have to read and research a bit. I didn&#39;t mean anything bad including cis women, just that it&#39;s obviously not just trans people and should have a bigger population that has not just colovaginoplasty but PPV to to test from.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;d think they&#39;d do ongoing research (from more than one researcher) on this type of thing. I feel scientific research should be looked at from many sides and ways to &#34;treat&#34;, ect. That&#39;s why science always advances. It seems that everyone does reference the same studies but because, like you said, it isn&#39;t researched as well as it should..
</p>
<p>
There is a bunch of products that &#34;seed&#34; good bacteria. I find if the pH isnt balanced the good bacteria can&#39;t stick. Just like cis women get chronic bacterial vaginosis (BV). It&#39;s a chronic excess of bad bacteria. You&#39;re more likely to get an STI and other infections if you have bacterial vaginosis. This may be because it reduces your natural defences against infection. Pretty much anything that treats BV should treat anything that&#39;s &#34;off&#34; with a colo neo vagina, in theory.
</p>
<p>
Also, I don&#39;t want any of this to dissuade anyone from doing colo as some don&#39;t have any other choice and it works for a lot of people with no issue. If that is because there is more room in the pelvis, better colon health, idk. I agree that it depends on the surgeon, where they take the piece of colon and how far back they suture the entrance of the colon. I see plenty of girls with colo that are perfectly fine and have great function.

What I&#39;m getting at is the colon has utterly different function and mucosal structure compared to natal vaginas.  No one to date has done robust microbiome analysis on the patients who are healthy and without apparent problems, so we don&#39;t know what is &#34;normal&#34; (healthy) in colovaginas, not even enough to know what bacteria to throw at it to improve neovaginitis.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned, the purposeful, constant buffering of acidity in the colon presents a hurdle to LAB establishing themselves on an environmental level, and it&#39;s even a stretch to say they would have the nutrients they need to self-sustain.  Intravaginal probiotics designed for natal vaginas are thus not necessarily going to work for colovaginas.

Totally get it, but again it works for people. I&#39;d have to search for the post, not sure if I saved it, but it was someone who had bottom surgery decades ago and she was able to get a normal ph balance for vaginas and proper flora. I have also heard about taking probiotics for colon health transfers to the neo vagina, but again there isnt much research.
</p>
<p>
Obviously this is all theoretical at this point. Just like breast cancer studies in trans women (especially those who start HRT later in life). Back in the day they used to say mammograms probably weren&#39;t needed, now I read/was told by a doctor that you should get them 5-10 years after starting HRT if starting in late 20s/early 30s or at 30 (like high risk cis women).
</p>
<p>
I just don&#39;t like seeing doom and gloom over this type of surgery. Sure it&#39;s a different world because of where the tissue came from, but it isn&#39;t the worst thing ever. If you have scar tissue in your abdomen from an accident or surgery or impact sports, PPV is harder to accomplish too. Unless a surgeon does exploratory surgery or scans, they don&#39;t know what they have to work with until they get in there. You can still have prolapse with PPV and PI. It&#39;s a risk all of them carry, just some more than others. It really depends on the status of the pelvic floor and the way the surgeon stitches/anchors the canal. I think all surgeons should require pelvic floor therapy before and after. If you go to pelvic floor therapy and find out yours is weak they can help you build it up so that you have a lower risk of complications.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;d love some surgeons to do research in their office and share amongst each other to help further. Collaboration helps the world, haha. It wouldn&#39;t be hard to do swabs for samples at follow ups. Those who travel for surgeries put a hitch in it, but still.

Why the colonovaginas approach is not recommended?
