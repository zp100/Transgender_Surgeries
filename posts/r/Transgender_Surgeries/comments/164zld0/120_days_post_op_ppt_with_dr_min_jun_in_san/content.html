Thank you. I have good depth, I can get all 5 dots in on the soul source dilators. I haven’t lost any depth since surgery, sensitivity is great especially clitoral and can orgasm, there is feeling in the canal and I have been able to orgasm from penetration, still taking things slow especially with penetration since I just barely passed 3 months and was given the ok from my surgeon.

Oh my 🤭 well thank you so much. I am very happy with my results. I couldn’t have asked for a better surgeon or healing/recovery process.

What was your hair removal prep like if you don’t mind me asking? I’d love to have a result similar to this but can’t fathom the endless hours of electrolysis I’m envisioning is needed to proceed with bottom surgery.

I had a few laser sessions and about 30-40 hours of electrolysis, and my surgeon also does a follicle scrape.

How was Dr Min Jun with you? I&#39;ve read posts in the past describing rudeness and short temper at very earliest at a consultation.

I’ve never experienced anything bad with him. I’m on a discord with other patients of his, haven’t heard of one bad thing from them. I’ve seen the posts on here by a few, and I know of some being misinformation because of one patient being mentally unstable and just a difficult person. But from my consultation to surgery to my last post op appointment he’s been kind, funny and very knowledgeable, he moves quickly and just gets straight to the point, but otherwise has been great from my experience. I highly recommend him, to me a great surgeons skills wins me over bedside manner, go in knowing what you want, understand the risks. You only deal with him a few times and you’re done. I would rather have a great result than go to a surgeon who has to much of a good bedside manner and subpar results just to have them make you feel good and tell you what you want to hear. It’s a life changing surgery and i knew he would give me what I want without the possibility of a revision or complications, and my recovery has been great and no complications.

It’s nice to hear good things about bbl, ive got a consult in under two months with the two of them but i hear very little on this sub about their results. Just general good things begin said all the time.

Yup! I see a lot of jun’s work on here and it’s always so good, so i feel like im in decently good hands, since they designed this together. I just don’t actually see much of bbl’s work directly, which is what I meant to say

Please just make sure that if you have any previous surgery history that could impact your PPT, don&#39;t just leave it in your chart and hope he reads it.
</p>
<p>
Hammer home your medical history and make sure he hears it ,reads it, writes it on his hand as a cheats sheet, whatever, so you don&#39;t  waste a couple grand flying across the country for him to turn you away at your pre-op appointment the day before surgery after being on his waitlist for 2 years
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, he seemed like a lovely person himself. Hopefully once he&#39;s established in his own practice, things like our oops won&#39;t happen again. Also his office staff leave...a bit to be desired. Like they&#39;re the office workers in a comedy skit that do everything but their job. We had to walk back into the office to find them sitting 20 feet away I guess just hoping we would??? Go away? Help ourselves??

Do you know where Dr. Jun is going after October?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m envious! I had a consult for September with him, but it was cancelled as he&#39;s leaving Crane CTS in October. I still want him but I don&#39;t know when he&#39;ll start new consults again.

Nobody knows yet. My wife is in a similar boat in that she had a scheduled surgery with him next year that got canceled. I am hopeful to maybe ask Dr Jun directly when I see him soon, but I am unsure of he will be able to give any more info.

Thank you so much, it was the hybrid method, back half of the canal is ppt, and recovery was not that bad actually, I’ve been fortunate with my healing process.

Please could you drop the dr name and operation type? This is probably the best result I have ever seen (better than who I used to think was one of the best: Dr Chettawut)

Dr min jun, hybrid ppt.
</p>
<p>
It really is a wonderful result isn’t it! He completed his training under bbl and zhao(who ill be meeting with in a few months) but from what i can tell he’s surpassed even them. If it weren’t next to impossible for me to travel to SF to have him do it i might’ve waited for it, but BBL is under my insurance and certainly not a bad surgeon herself if this sub is any indication.

I recently had surgery with RBL and Zhao, they recently made some changes in their aesthetics that almost mimics Jun aesthetics, I have virtually no scaring from the surgery from RBL/Zhao and my Labia minoras are the most defined it’s been because of their suture technique they got from Jun; essentially Jun is teaching them now 😂

Do you know where Dr. Jun is going after October?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m envious! I had a consult for September with him, but it was cancelled as he&#39;s leaving Crane CTS in October. I still want him but I don&#39;t know when he&#39;ll start new consults again.

I honestly thought this was a troll post of a cis vagina. Then I looked through your previous posts. I really can&#39;t get over how amazing it looks. If only we could all hope for such an amazing result. Are the small incisions in your abdomen from the same surgery or another surgery like appendectomy or something?

Thank you for sharing. Great result. If it’s ok, was this the hybrid ppt-PI technique?

Woah you look so good. Forgive me as coming across as dense, but are the tiny incisions on your abdomen from the surgery too?

Part of the hybrid ppt procedure I believe, it’s where they harvest the back half of the canal from, which gives the surgeons more flexibility with regards to what tissues they put where. (Im not op though so I could be wrong)

She looks PERFECT! I&#39;m a little jealous. Dr. Jun was my go-to until I found my surgeon, but he&#39;s out of network and out of my price range.

Ahhhh, such fantastic results! How was it going about getting PPT? I know it&#39;s what I&#39;d prefer to get as far as method goes, but I&#39;ve heard mixed things about it being an only option as opposed to the classic method of inversion.

Hi - thank you for sharing these photos !  I had srs with chettawut and i am so happy but i have to admit that dr min jun has a couple techniques which really give a better final result.  Can i ask how much was the cost for the surgery ?  I had non penile inversion technique srs and the surgery alone was 11,000euros and around 4,000 in other unavoidable related costs.  I am often being asked about srs and where i went so i would like to be able to give some info about dr min jun if i can.
