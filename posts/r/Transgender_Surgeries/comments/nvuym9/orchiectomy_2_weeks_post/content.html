Hi everyone!
</p>
<p>
I had and orchiectomy in Barcelona, Spain, with the surgeon Jorge Saenz de Cabez√≥n, and everything has gone great! The pain has been very small all along (I didn&#39;t need any medication or anything), and after like 1 week I was able to walk normally, without going very far of course. And the post-op care is minimal, just to clean the area 2 times a day.
</p>
<p>
So totally worth it :) I feel very calm knowing that I don&#39;t need a T blocker anymore. If you have any questions don&#39;t hesitate üòÅ

Congratulations!! I am 2 years post, and have loved every single day since I made one of my best decisions I‚Äôve made to date. I was also fortunate to have an easy surgery, and recovery.  Best wishes for your Journey!!

Congratulations. I am just 2.5 weeks after my third &#34;orchiectomy&#34;. I had a hematoma after the first surgery (the true orchiectomy) that was still so large 8 weeks after surgery (the volume of the scrotum was larger than before surgery) that it had to be surgically removed. 3 days after clearing up the hematoma, the scrotum had to be opened again because it was so swollen that the skin tore in some places. So the third time to the operating room.
</p>
<p>
And that was 2.5 weeks ago. My testicle is still &#34;there&#34;. So the scrotum is still filled. With ... No idea what. Blood, swelling... I do not know. The volume is the same as before the first surgery, just hard, not flexible. I hope you understand what I mean.
</p>
<p>
What does it look like for you? Do I have wrong expectations? I thought that after the orchiectomy I would have nothing below the penis. Just a little loose skin. But no volume at all.

That sounds like a nightmare. I know there‚Äôs some stuff that may remain after the surgery, plus swelling. I hope you are able to have your complication addressed if you haven‚Äôt already.

Ufff :( I&#39;m so sorry that you had complications, I hope everything is alright now. I also have two small &#34;balls&#34; which I don&#39;t know when they will disappear, so don&#39;t worry it&#39;s normal.

I also noticed this a few days after the procedure. But now they are very tiny. It&#39;s was probably due to swelling

Nope, nothing. Just the money money xD. In fact, here in Catalonia it is forbidden for them to ask for this type of documents.

do you feel he did a good job at making small incisions with likely minimal scarring?

I still can&#39;t say for sure, it&#39;s a single incision in the middle line, about 1/3 of the scrotum lenght I think. I went to this surgeon because I he has over 20 years of experience with vaginoplasties, so he knows what he&#39;s doing.

They say it can help in some cases. In mine I&#39;m pretty sure it will, because my T was very stubborn and still far from cis women levels.

Please don&#39;t do what I did, but I didn&#39;t stop the treatment one single day, I was too paranoic about testosterone coming back, and I decided to take the risk. Nothing happened luckily (my E is very low though, around 70 pg/ml). In theory you have to stop for 3 weeks.

Some people need T supplements if their levels are too low, but normally the body still produces just enough, the testicles aren&#39;t the only producers of testosterone.
</p>
<p>
And still no extra breast development xD two weeks are nothing, I&#39;ll tell you in 6 months. I don&#39;t think this procedure can help much in this area, but in my case my T levels were still pretty high although I was on cyproterone, so I have hope.

Hey Pancake-san sorry to bother you 2 months later, how are you healing?
</p>
<p>
Did you have to wait a long for the surgery date?
</p>
<p>
Satisfied / Any comments?

<p>
Interested in going to Jorge myself.

Hi!!!
</p>
<p>
The healing is totally complete, and there is almost no scar tissue. So very satisfied :) it really seems that there was never anything down there.
</p>
<p>
I only had to wait like 3 weeks, once I delivered the money it was all super quick (the price is around 3000 euros + medical tests. This tests were covered by the insurance).
</p>
<p>
PD: after the surgery the area will be swollen for several weeks, in which I mean that it seems that the testicles are still there. I just leave this note because it was a thing I didn&#39;t expect.

Thanks for your reply! Glad you&#39;re satisfied.
</p>
<p>
I think that settles it for me where I&#39;m going. Quite a bit cheaper than going to Wales (I was quoted 4k GBP with Seipp, which at current rates would be 4700 eur) and less risky than choosing unknown surgeons from Eastern Europe in terms of potential scars.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t have expected it to seem like testes are still there for weeks, good to know.

Good luck!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

Yeah it&#39;s so strange, they are definitely a lot smaller than the testes, but it really seems there&#39;s still something in there. I hate to recognize that I was a little bit paranoic thinking &#34;what if the surgeon hasn&#39;t removed all the parts?&#34; XDD

How did you find your doctor? Did you choose any urologist or did you have standards?
</p>
<p>
I live in barcelona too and need a surgeon for exactly this.

Hii, I first went to a random urologist, to just ask some questions, and then he derived me to  the doctor who did my procedure. I trusted him because he also knows how to do vaginoplasties.

I haven&#39;t had a tracheal shave, but I&#39;d recommend to look for doctors who are specialised in the laringe and voice department, so they&#39;ll really know whay they&#39;re doing
