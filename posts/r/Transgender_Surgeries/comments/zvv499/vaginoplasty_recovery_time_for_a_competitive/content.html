Hey y&#39;all, hope you&#39;re having a fantastic holiday. I&#39;ve got a question for you that I doubt comes through here very often.
</p>
<p>
Basically, I&#39;m a competitive curler on my provincial junior tour, in fact as far as I know the only trans competitive curler in my country and the only currently active one in the world. Curling has been my life for the last decade and I honestly don&#39;t know where I&#39;d be without the sport. It&#39;s my happy place, you know?
</p>
<p>
But of course, being an athlete is all about being in tune with your body, and while the steps I&#39;ve taken in transition thus far have made a world of difference, SRS is necessary for me ASAP. I have been told I should have no problem getting a surgery date immediately after the 2023-24 school year (i.e. mid 2024), so that&#39;s the current plan.
</p>
<p>
To this point, I&#39;ve been under the assumption that getting SRS will take me out for a curling season. After all, there&#39;s a long, difficult recovery with plenty of upkeep that makes it inconvenient to play, let alone travel on a tour schedule. However, I&#39;ve been seeing remarkably quick recovery results from some of the ladies on here and other trans spaces, and I&#39;m wondering exactly when I will be able to get back to playing.
</p>
<p>
I recognize as well that the answer may change depending on procedure. My province covers a trip to the Montreal clinic, where I assume I&#39;ll have a conventional penile inversion unless they recommend I do otherwise.
</p>
<p>
While I am a slider sweeper and that requires a significant amount of core strength (google a photo of Ben Hebert for context), my main concern is my throwing motion. My play style means that my biggest benefit to a team is my up-weight hitting ability, so in order to be competitively useful I need to be able to throw hard and accurately.

</a>
, while slightly outdated, should give you an idea of what I need to be able to do. I also need to be able to do that with about three times the power shown there, so I need both my leg drive and balance to be fully ready to play. Curling tournaments are long, often involving as many as 5-6 2-hour games in the span of 48 hours, so endurance and resistance to repetitive motion are also crucial; in those 10 hours of play, I&#39;ll throw 80 rocks and sweep another 240 as a front end player.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to risk any permanent damage to my results (though pain is not a problem, as I have played through many things I probably should not have), but if I am able to get back on the ice within 6-7 months or so, I could take a position as an alternate for a team and still get ice time at important qualifying events. As this will be my last year of junior eligibility, I would like to make that happen if at all possible. However, my safety and quality of recovery both come first.
</p>
<p>
Thank you in advance for your wisdom (and apologies for the text wall)! I don&#39;t expect I&#39;ll like the answer I get, but it&#39;s nice to be informed. And of course, enjoy your holidays if that&#39;s your jam :)

Oh my god I’m a competitive curler too (in America)!!! This is wild!
</p>
<p>
I just had vaginoplasty in June, and was cleared for curling at the 8 week mark. I kept reading 3 months for exercise, and that may be true depending on your doctor’s orders. But I was surprised to hear that it was fine to curl at the 8 week mark.
</p>
<p>
Anytime after the external wounds have completed healing should be okay. You should see skin everywhere, no incision remaining.
</p>
<p>
And FYI when I got back to curling I was able to go pretty much to full performance immediately — sliding, standing up, sweeping my own rocks, etc as I had before surgery.
</p>
<p>
Pm me if you have questions!

So I do a little bit of curling myself, and I&#39;m just about 6 months out (penile inversion with robotically assisted peritoneal flaps). In addition to curling, I lift and climb. I&#39;ll start off by saying that I haven&#39;t been back to curling since before surgery, and that I&#39;m nowhere near at your level. Based on my personal experience, the recovery from surgery itself wasn&#39;t too bad. What was difficult was getting back into things. I lost 90lbs on my deadlift (315lbs to 225 lbs), and I am not climbing quite at the level I was before. I also should have reduced the amount of weight in my dumbbell lunges, which ended up with me having a muscle strain...
</p>
<p>
That said, everyone heals differently, and, considering you do this comparatively, you are probably in a good place. You are likely gonna be good to go, even if not at quite the same level. It&#39;s just... Be kind to yourself and to your body during

Have you searched for stories by athletes in other sports?

Honestly, I haven&#39;t found much pertaining specifically to athletic experiences. There don&#39;t seem to be very many of us, especially those who continue after transition. If you know about any good places to talk to other trans athletes, I&#39;m all ears.

I see them posting occasionally, but no special places or anything. You’d have to try searching. Look on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter as well and you might be able to contact someone.
</p>
<p>
I recall this YouTube channel from years ago, she was into roller derby. I don’t recall any details though, too long ago.

After surgery it would help others if you could come back and write about it.

I am not a high performance athlete but I rejoined my soccer team after four months and, other than some chafing, have had no issues.  I am assuming that you are in AB or SK, perhaps there is someone else locally who curls and can help you understand what to expect even if they aren’t curling at your level?
</p>
<p>
The only obstacle I can see in your timeline is any potential complications like dehiscence or infection.
</p>
<p>
Good luck, looking forward to seeing you play in the Scottie’s and more.  🇨🇦
