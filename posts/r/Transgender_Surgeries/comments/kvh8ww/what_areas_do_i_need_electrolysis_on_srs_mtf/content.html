For Penile inversion srs what areas will need to have hair removed. I&#39;m planning to start getting laser hair removal and electrolysis. Should I leave some pubic hairs or is it okay to just remove most of it?

It will vary between surgeons.  But the shaft and scrotum are the most important.  Some of the perineum, and a bit of the base above the whole works.

Check with your surgeon about their requirements. It does vary from surgeon to surgeon. For example,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/i14rv2/drs_bluebondlangnor_zhao_nyulangone_mtf_grs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
is a link to my post for a genital hair removal template for Dr. RBbL at NYU Langone. It also depends on the surgery you are having. For my surgery, I was directed not to worry about the shaft (Edit: the surgery team will scrape the follicles during the surgery). Instead, I was to concentrate on the scrotum and perineum between the groin creases down to the top of the anus.

Some surgeon&#39;s don&#39;t even require electrolysis or laser
<em>
at all
</em>
. I&#39;m in Canada, and if you go to Dr Brassard in Montr√©al he just cauterizes all the hairs while you are under. So many international patients come here for that, but something to think about if you want to save money, time, pain, and stress. Even if you are elsewhere, surgeon&#39;s may have the same option where you are.
</p>
<p>
...otherwise, I&#39;d assume getting all of it must be really important, especially the penis and scrotum.

OMG, wow... this might&#39;ve saved me a grave mistake... Only issue is, there aren&#39;t skilled electrologists anywhere in the vicinity. T_T This might literally mean I can&#39;t get SRS for most of my life if at all... that&#39;s how significant it is....

You&#39;re not guaranteed to get hair, its just a risk. You may also find there&#39;s ways to get it - perhaps someone will start up close to you, or you can learn how to do it yourself with a friend.

Actually
<a href="/u/hiddenstill">/u/hiddenstill</a>
is correct. If there really is no one competent in your area, and finacially ( and availability wise) electrolysis is not accessible, then the last option, is to DIY. I actually DIY&#39;ed my entire face back in the day and I still support a healthy number of folks doing DIY over on
<a href="https://hairtell.com">hairtell.com</a>
forums. If you&#39;ve ever thought &#34; how hard could it be to insert a needle and press a peddle&#34; then you could be a good candidate. There are resources readily available that you can actually LEARN how to do electrolysis on your own. I&#39;d personally start  with a book by Michael Bono ( one of my many mentors over the years by the way)  called, The Blend Method. Killing hairs in blend on my own face  while i sent my kid to school 4 hours a day because i HAD THE TIME and no money for electrolysis, is how I first learned  and a very accomlishable goal, even during the middle of a worldwide pandemic when everything including electrologists, are shut down.Disclaimer, I&#39;ve been a member of hairtell for 18 + years and  am one of the moderation team.

Read whats in the wiki on electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
It is possible get a cheap machine and learn how to do electrolysis on yourself. A few people have done it. Only I guess genitals would be hard to reach, so you&#39;d need some help.

Basically you may have a few options ... some people travel a bit. There are places that do marathon sessions with numbing in surgery strength.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/presentation/index#wiki_laser_or_electrolysis_hair_removal" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
it was discussed. So only a few sessions may be necessary.
</p>
<p>
And some people get a refurbished or even new professional device. It was also discussed at the bottom there. With a reputable seller, those should be tested and working.

Good morning ladies. I&#39;m afraid I have some work to do this morning both at home and have to go take care of some maintenance at the office after a 12:00 session so my time is limited, but perhaps I can help.
<a href="/u/Hiddenstill" rel="nofollow">/u/Hiddenstill</a>
is correct, I have consulted with many of the patients from Brossards clinic after GRS and unfortunately the answer is the same,for labia hair and accessible hair, yes we can remove it with electrolysis  post surgically, but  for hair in  the vaginal cavity that is formed from degloved penile skin tissue, the physics are just not in our favour. For all other hair, you can safely wait until post - surgically . The hair on the shaft and at the base of the penile member is the hair I personally stress most about as this ends up inside the vaginal anal is is difficult to impossible to remove post surgically. I&#39;d also like to address your comment about &#34;10% kill rate) amoung your local electrologists. Sorry but there is no possiblility this is accurate. See my comments in the linked post about this in transontario.There are many more cycles of hair growth  and many more hair, than you see at any given point in time. Essentially, you arent giving enough credit to the scope of the job. This is the reason why it takes 18 months at MINIMUM to get through all the cycles of hair growth. Still if you have no confidence whatsoever in electrologists in your area, perhaps I might know someone competent in your area. I dont know someone in all laces, but I do know quite a few . I would recommend a clear and advance strategy on the area at the base of the shaft and the area surrounding it. Essentially you kill ALL the visible hair and then advance into new areas each session after you have recleared any regrowth since the last time. Hoestly by concentrating on the most difficult hair to remove post surgically you can mae astounding progress because it&#39;s not such a large area It&#39;s very possible to clear it. 20 minute sessions though, wont cut
<a href="https://it.It" rel="nofollow">it.It</a>
&#39;s a bigger job than that.

not really because I only ever get to see a very small percentage of the results.I can only tell you that calls and emails from post -surgical clients is a pretty regular event around my office. Unfortunately for many the answer is it&#39;s too long/difficult or downright impossible to remove vaginal cavity hair and at that point, its too late for us to do anything about it.

If you only have 12 months before GRS then it&#39;s clear, you need to follow the advice of your surgeonThe skin healing process post electrolysis takes place over a period of 12-18 months after the last treatment. This makes the skin less elastic, and less suitable for use in constructing the vaginal cavity. As an electrologist, I wont tell you to ignore your surgeons advice, indeed they could refuse to operate. If there&#39;s hair that needs to be destroyed at 12 months unfortunately it&#39;s too late for us to start on it.  I get calls and emails from people in this situation all the time, and unfortunately the answer is always, not without your surgeons consent.

I believe everything else you&#39;re saying, but on this I truly disagree. The area that proved this was my fingers. There were only so many hairs, and I can see all the follicles. I could swear she was pushing the needle in wrong and everything. Straight down instead of following the follicle, sometimes through it instead causing bleeding before she even shocked it.

We&#39;re pretty small here, that&#39;s why. If I told you where I live though, I&#39;d practically be telling you who I am (without exaggeration), so any conversation would have to be in PM.

<p>
No, I&#39;m aware it will take much longer, judging from them doing my brows and fingers. Literally 20 mins might have done between my brows at best, not even the whole job there. We spent over 30 mins per session on just my fingers from 1st knuckle to second knuckle. As is now, after multiple sessions I gave up and went to a laser clinic on
<em>
her own recommendation
</em>
. It has been like massively different and I found it a lot more worthwhile - 2/3rds the cost per session and much more effective... but I worry a lot about laser - besides the fact that it hurts a hell of a lot more than electrolysis. I&#39;m worried that it&#39;ll leave &#34;almost-destroyed&#34; hairs after. Is it okay if super thin (but coarse) hairs we didn&#39;t know about come back later post-op?

From this description, and knowledge you&#39;ve mentioned eastern Ontario, and I could almost SWEAR you saw Barb Willoughby at either Personal Pampering in smith falls or Time for You here in Ottawa.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve worked directly with Barb, and yes she is pretty horrible despite having something like 28 years experience . Her eyesight was extremely poor. Inaccurate and poor insertions which are genuinely painful . I got 3 comments consistently from my clients who saw her: &#34; Seana, it was painful slow and you do more hair in 5 minutes than she does in an hour. Never Again! &#34;
</p>
<p>
I couldnt agree more. Avoid her.

No, but I can&#39;t help you figure out who I am either, lol. Also, if someone else had the same thing happen, maybe that&#39;s a sign various electrologists suck? lol

Some of them, really really do suck. They tend to be the folks in smaller places that  never update on their training their entire 30 years or whatever and only get to do maybe 10 minutes of electrolysis every month or so. But there are some really good electrologists out there as well. As for the choice between blend and Thermolysis. Honestly for anything DIY, your insertions suck worse than Barbs. You arent practiced enough to get the sweet spot in the follicle or accurate insertions. As a result, outward pressure can occur on the follicle wall and when this is combined with  high intensity thermolysis currents the results can be disastrous. High frequency thermolysis is a form of electrocautery and does have the ability to cut sin. So for DIY work, I recommend blend. BOth  blend and Thermolysis  are effective at killing hair, but thermolysis is much more skill dependant and blend tends to have a higher kill rate . To add more considerations, blend taes considerably longer per hair, but gives absolutely beautiful results. I did my entire face using blend, and its all i recommend DIY&#39;ers  attempt on themselves.
