First 2 pictures- different angles at three weeks.
</p>
<p>
3rd picture- Achieving past 6&#34; with blue.
</p>
<p>
4th picture- Two weeks and 3 days post op.
</p>
<p>
5th picture- Two weeks post op.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, healing is going very well. During week three, the redness and swelling reduced considerably.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is going well. Some pain, no blood. Discharge is fairly minimal.
</p>
<p>
I can sleep on my side starting today.
</p>
<p>
Energy levels are slowly increasing and appetite is slowing down.
</p>
<p>
Overall I am soo excited with how my recovery is progressing ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞

I have that lump. So do a few other girls I know. How long ago was your surgery? Being so recently post op, most of us are hoping it will go down with other swelling

That&#39;s awful. Im really sorry ‚ù§Ô∏è Really so, so sorry üòû
</p>
<p>
I have not seen this side of her at all. And I know of others with complaints that have had resolution.
</p>
<p>
The hospital staff did suck though. That I experienced too, but obviously in lesser degree to yourself.

You will be able to start exercising gently at 6 weeks. You will likely miss one season unless you can plan the date well.  But whats one season of softball gone vs not getting affirmation? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

It‚Äôs not that, this has been my escape from ptsd and can be very detrimental to leave me to my own thoughts.  I‚Äôm a veteran and its a daily battle.  This has given me camaraderie that ive missed for a long time.  Plus I‚Äôm in tip top shape‚Ä¶ I dont want to lose everything I‚Äôve gained but dont want to not get the surgery as well.  It‚Äôs been rough just to get this far..

I understand that. I dont think you will lose all your progress if you plan it well. Its not just the surgery and recovery, but possibly and adjustment to your HRT as well. I have a friend who plays on a sports team who got the surgery. She is probably going to miss playing in one season. But she is able to go to practice and games to watch after a few weeks. And is hoping to be in shape by the end of the season but expects to be sitting out due to lack of practice. This being said, she still gets to interact with the team so the camaraderie is there ‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
Obviously in the end you will have to figure out whats best for you. But I hope this helps!!

That was kind of the idea i had and why I choose the timing as well.  Winter ball sucks because its so cold and if I recover quickly by March/April I hope to be playing again.  My womens team games start in the beginning of March so if I get my surgery mid January I will have minimum of 6 weeks already recovered.  These girls mean a lot to me and they support me incredibly‚Ä¶. I play shortstop for them and I don‚Äôt like letting them down.  Thank you for your words, they‚Äôre meant a lot and show perspective.  I truly appreciate it.

That&#39;s how I feel about it, but with motorcycles instead of softball. The struggle is real, but the reward is worth missing out temporarily.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: How was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors (It&#39;s on my short list and I have doubts who to go with)? Do you recommend Dr. McGinn? Did you have circumcision before your SRS? How do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? What is your vaginal depth? How is the process of dilations? They are painful? Are you planning to undergo any revision surgery or medical tattoos (is a very good result, and you still don&#39;t heal completely)? And if you opt for revision surgery or medical tattooing... What elements of your vulva would you like to improve?, How was the stay in New Hope? How was Dr. McGinn&#39;s aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

How was your recovery so far?  Great! Very little pain, no complications. But it is exhausting.
</p>
<p>
What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors? The consult is what sold me. I just knew she was the one. Some contributing factors are that Ive seen consistently good results and little or no complaints.
</p>
<p>
Do you recommend Dr. McGinn?  Yes
</p>
<p>
Did you have circumcision before your SRS?  No
</p>
<p>
How do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity?  Cosmetics 9/10 Sensitivity too soon to tell. Its all numb this early.
</p>
<p>
What is your vaginal depth?  6.5&#34;
</p>
<p>
How is the process of dilations? They are painful?  Time consuming. Painful at first. Uncomfortable after that. This varies a lot by person. Being in a positive mood goes a long way to making a session comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Are you planning to undergo any revision surgery or medical tattoos? And if you opt for revision surgery or medical tattooing... What elements of your vulva would you like to improve? Dont know, not concerned overly if I scar much. I have a dedicated partner for life so I dont need to date and be stealth. I may consider revision if I have too much skin once all the swelling is gone.
</p>
<p>
How was the stay in New Hope?  Great! Stay at Gaia after the hospital, Bill is great and knows what you need ‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
How was Dr. McGinn&#39;s aftercare? Its been three weeks. Her team is amazing, but Ive hardly the need to see them so far with how well my recovery is going
