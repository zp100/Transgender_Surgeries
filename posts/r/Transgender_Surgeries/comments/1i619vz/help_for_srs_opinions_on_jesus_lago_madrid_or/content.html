Hi everyone,
<br>
I&#39;m Luna, I&#39;m 22 and I live in Milan. Since I started taking hormones at 18 I have wanted to get srs but I have always postponed it since I wanted to complete my studies. Now I finished university and I&#39;m starting a master&#39;s degree and I think it&#39;s my last chance: I will have 1 month and a half of summer holidays in July to have the surgery before working the rest of my life basically. In September I&#39;m supposed to go to work for a stage and I can&#39;t miss this opportunity since they can hire me full time. Will I be able to do that quite comfortably after a moth and a half?
<br>
I&#39;m quite sure I want to get a PPT mainly because of the dilatation that can be stopped after a year (by the way, is that true?). Since I live in Europe, I would prefer to stay nearby, so my endocrinologist recommended two surgeons: Dr. Manero and Dr. Lago, both in Spain.
<br>
I know Manero don&#39;t do PPT while Lago is one of the few people in Europe who does this technique: do you have any other names or recommendations? Has anyone done the surgery with these two?
<br>
One of the things I&#39;m most scared of is the regrowth of hair, I know that Lago doesn&#39;t require laser (also I&#39;m very sceptic about the efficiency of laser in the long run where you can&#39;t redo it) because he takes care of the problem but has anyone had problems? Also from other clinics?

Ivan Manero is notorious as a butcher. Lago can be hit or miss. if I were you I’d go with Miroslav in Serbia, he’s not the best in terms of aesthetics but he’s one of the best surgeons that does PPT and Sigmoid Colon.

I had my surgery with Dr Lago in September, and got peritoneal vaginoplasty combined with a breast augmentation.
</p>
<p>
(I definitely underestimated the impact of having both done at once, but money issues meant it was either now or never.)
</p>
<p>
I love the results I got for both bits, no regrets from the medical side. The aesthetics are much better than I could have ever imagined and I got full depth (just over the last dot on the orange soulsource dilator) and sensation.
</p>
<p>
Five stars, and I can say &#34;Jesus created my vagina&#34; 😜
</p>
<p>
My recovery was tough and long due to my high pain sensitivity and my body&#39;s great ability to metabolise and neutralise painkillers, but that&#39;s something that happens with every surgery of mine.
</p>
<p>
My local doctors here all commented on the good surgical craftsmanship during checkups, so that was definitely a vote of confidence from them.
</p>
<p>
You will definitely need somebody with you for recovery. I had my brother with me for the first two weeks after the surgery and definitely couldn&#39;t have managed without him.
</p>
<p>
The only regrets I have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
not making sure I got to Madrid earlier, because after surgery tourists stuff isn&#39;t fun.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not checking the hotel properly. Mine had a &#34;wonderful&#34; night club next door and bad sound proofing. Every Friday and Saturday night was hell. The hotel also didn&#39;t allow me to receive packages, so no Amazon to buy supplies.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

Thank you so much for sharing! &#34;Jesus created my vagina&#34; nearly choked me hahah.
<br>
I will go with my parents and we can squeeze in a day or two visits to the city.
<br>
How long did it take you to walk comfortably and start re-living your life quite normally again?
<br>
How long would you recommend staying in Madrid? Is there a fixed number of day or?
<br>
Again, thank you so much!

Dr Lago recommends that you stay for 4 weeks after the surgery to ensure that everything is healing okay. After those 4 weeks the chance of complications is extremely low.
</p>
<p>
You need to get there around 3 days before the day of surgery for the pre-surgery tests.
</p>
<p>
You will be in hospital for 5 days, and for the first couple of days after you will have a catheter in that will limit what you can do easily. But in all likelihood you will be exhausted anyway, so time flies.
</p>
<p>
I was able to move around enough to go food shopping at the 2 week mark. It gradually gets better and by the 4 week flying back was okay (but still exhausting).
</p>
<p>
As a standard you will get a sick note for the 8 weeks from the date of the surgery and that could be extended to up to 6 months if needed.
</p>
<p>
You definitely need the extra 4 weeks off at home to do the dilation and let your body heal. Don&#39;t be shy to ask for the extension, it&#39;s better to take your time to fully rest up and recover than to be stressed out and suffering.
</p>
<p>
Edit: given you are from Italy the EU rules make it do that the Spanish sick note should be enough to give you the same time off as if it was written by an Italian doctor.
</p>
<p>
If you technically (regardless of barriers or waiting time) could have been offered vaginoplasty for gender dysphoria on the local healthcare system and they consider it as medically necessary and thus give paid sick leave, then you should be able to get the same for your Spanish surgery.
</p>
<p>
The EU common market rules around healthcare mandate that EU countries recognise each other&#39;s equivalent medical decisions.
</p>
<p>
(That&#39;s why I combined the breast surgery with the bottom surgery, as it means that all the recovery time is covered by the sick pay as I recover from both surgeries at the same time.)

Girlie thank you so so much! It was so helpful.
<br>
Does Lago require laser removal?
<br>
For the stage, i can ask to start two weeks after so i can have my full 8 weeks chill.
<br>
How often do you do dilatation? I heard the first year should usually be three times a day. Is that right?
<br>
I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m bombarding you with questions, but I&#39;ve also sent an email for them to call me, but they&#39;ve never answered.
<br>
Still thank you so much a feel much better having heard someone that did that!

Laser:
</p>
<p>
No, but it&#39;s something I would recommend. For peritoneal vaginoplasty you won&#39;t suffer from hair deep inside the vagina, but you can still end up with hairs at the vaginal entrance.
</p>
<p>
If you can get it done before, I&#39;d recommend it to at least reduce the amount of hair there.
</p>
<p>
Dilation:
</p>
<p>
First: I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the dilator set given after the surgery. It&#39;s not bad, but its cone shape made it just awkward. I got soulsource dilators as my weapon of choice and their shape was just a lot nicer.
</p>
<p>
I dilated 3 times a day until very recently. The goal is to get up to a diameter of 3.5 cm and full depth within the first couple of months.
</p>
<p>
Dr Vasquez, who does the aftercare, gave me a rough target of getting there at the 2 months mark as a guide. But she also said that getting there at 3 months is totally fine too, and to listen to my body.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s much more concerned about maintaining the depth. For that you get a thin dilatior which you are expected to use until you can use any of the other dilators to get to the same depth.
</p>
<p>
After 3 months, trying to increase the width can be a bit more painful as the scars tend to get harder around that time and breaking that hardening down tends to get more difficult.
</p>
<p>
But if you take longer than 3 months to get to the target size it&#39;s not a catastrophy. Its still possible to go up more after that point.
</p>
<p>
As said, my recovery was a more painful ride as my body loves to make me suffer. My scars always take a long time to heal, I only really got to a pain free state in the last few weeks.
</p>
<p>
I did 3 times per day until the last few weeks. To quote Dr Lago: if you notice that it gets more difficult, do it more often. Not too much fun to hear early on in the recovery, but definitely true.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m now down to twice a day (morning and evening) and it finally feels easier and not like I constantly start from scratch. I think I finally reached the stage where my scars stopped trying to contract so quickly. I definitely have a body with a sense for drama 😀
</p>
<p>
If everything keeps going well, I think I will try to go down to once a day, as I no longer need to constantly work on getting back to full depth. It seems my body finally accepted that it can&#39;t win against my superior skills.
</p>
<p>
Again: Dr Vasquez doesn&#39;t give hard rules beyond the basic guidelines and tells you to listen to what your body tells you in that regard.
</p>
<p>
Sick notes snd time off for recovery
</p>
<p>
As for the sick note: don&#39;t hesitate to just ask for more time. Dr Vasquez said it&#39;s fairly common for people to just need more time to heal or get their strength back after such major surgery.
</p>
<p>
They don&#39;t gatekeep the time off, you take as much as you need.
</p>
<p>
The 6 month limit seems to be more a Spanish rule about signing off people without seeing them in person and not some &#34;get back to work&#34; mentality on their part.

Thank you so much!
<br>
I&#39;m afraid to take more time off because it&#39;s really important for me to do the stage as well as I can since they could potentially hire me later. I hope I can find the right balance!
<br>
For laser, I&#39;ll follow your advice but I&#39;m still not convinced since I had it done two years ago on my face and they are quite back again. Should I look into electrolysis maybe?

Electrolysis is a slow process, but guaranteed to have permanent effects.
</p>
<p>
You could also try to use a different laser type, as not all laser machines are equally effective for each hair type and skin colour shade.

Hi girlie! May I ask you how frequent you had to dilate? And how often you dilate now?

Do not go to Lago. Nearly died due to his negligence. He also does not make anatomically correct vaginas.
