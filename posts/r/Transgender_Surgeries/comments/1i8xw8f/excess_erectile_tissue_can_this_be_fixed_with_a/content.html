Excess erectile tissue. Can this be fixed with a superficial intervention instead of having to have a full-on revision and going under general anesthesia?

I had a similar issue. It will require anesthesia. The amount they can reduce will vary. Modifying runs the risk of nerve damage in the clitoris. I&#39;d definitely get a consult to discuss. If there&#39;s another surgery you want like breast aug, maybe they can do both at same time.

exactly this. i also have some excess erectile tissue and i had my consult with my surgeon for a revision and it’ll be outpatient under general anesthesia. i decided to also do a mini FFS revision at the same time (for sure a lip lift, maybe a few other more minor procedures). so i booked a consult with the face surgeon who works with my bottom surgeon and then i’ll schedule a combined date once that happens. that way i only have to deal with one recovery period.

Ya :( do you have insurance? If so, if you spray when you pee that then becomes covered :)
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, the person seeing these private parts of you will either accept it, or not. If they don&#39;t accept, not worth your time.
</p>
<p>
Have you spoken to your surgeon? A lot of surgeons will cover revisions except anesthesia.

This was covered by public Healthcare. I&#39;ve asked and so far they&#39;re denying me the possibility of a revision because they say, and I quote, &#34;it would be for esthetic purposes only&#34;, as if that wasn&#39;t the whole point of the surgery to begin with. Idk I&#39;m thinking of either taking a pair of scissors and doing something gnarly so they have to operate on me or suing. Either way,  I can&#39;t believe I waited 5 years and this is what I got. I can&#39;t afford anything else because I&#39;m literally a student and I have no income yet.
</p>
<p>
Also, they&#39;re telling me they can&#39;t tell how it&#39;s going to turn out until a year has passed from the initial surgery. They think I&#39;m dumb or something

There&#39;s one type where the stream goes in weird directions, and one where a lot of pressure is needed. At least in the US, both warrant insurance coverage.

Are there in person trans support groups in your area? Might want to try asking people near you that have went through the process. Honestly, most SRS requires a revision :(

Just had this sort of revision in December. It was a somewhat intensive recovery, 4 weeks of restrictions. It&#39;s not just a simple fix.

I had a very, very, very similar revision done. This is what will happen.
</p>
<p>
general anesthesia, and your surgeon will tell you that they will be able to get some of it, but the closer to the canal entrance they get, the less they will be able to excise because it is too close to the structures that make the walls of your vaginal canal.
</p>
<p>
You will see a slight improvement, but not as much as you’re hoping.
</p>
<p>
Having had this done, I still have a little extra tissue, but it is far, far better than it was previously

I’m curious to know because if I run into this issue in the future I want to know what to expect, but how painful was dilating after your revision? How long roughly did it take for you to return to full mobility? Hope all is well.

Revision was an absolute breeze. It’s NOTHING like the first time. I was told to “take a day or two off dilating” and then I did. I was back in the gym like 2 weeks post revision?

I hear that you’re having a lot of anxiety about a revision but what you suggested will 100% not help how “it feels” during penetration (if you like that)
</p>
<p>
For me. The extra tissue caused mild dysphoria and I know for many others too

Your surgeon does not know how to do this surgery  the right way, the anatomy is not correct, definitely gonna need a revision.

My instinct says you&#39;ll need a general for this, but the only way to know for sure would be to ask a surgeon?
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want anyone chopping down there unless I was thoroughly unconscious anyway!
</p>
<p>
I am wondering whether it&#39;s possible to Botox the nerve that causes the tissue to get engorged without any loss of sensation, but it&#39;s not something I&#39;d trust anyone without a lot of knowledge and experience to attempt, as the consequences could be a complete loss of sensation and/or permanent engorgement... I have no idea who to even ask?
</p>
<p>
As usual, not a doctor! I would be curious about the answer to the Botox question though? It could be an easy way to minimise things down there without major surgery...
</p>
<p>
FWIW I don&#39;t think she looks bad 💕

I wanted to second this. If u find something function related you’ll have a better chance of getting them to approve a revision.

Sorry if I am asking a really dumb question. Where are the erectile tissues? I just had my bottom surgery a few months ago and I had some tissues at the entrance of my canal. I always have to push it up with my dilator to go in. My surgeon said it’s pelvic muscles. I am glad you are able to orgasm because I haven’t been able to.

Some surgeons may be willing to do it with a spinal block. Maybe with or without sedation.

You may be able to get an epidural where you won’t feel anything below the waist. That’s what I had for my GCS. They also gave me something to sleep during the procedure but it wasn’t General bc the epidural took care of it all. May be worth an ask when you’re talking to surgeons. Here’s hoping! :)

To be fair there&#39;s almost no representation of cis vaginas near orgasm on the internet. Like those galleries tend not to show any sort of arousal. And unfortunately porn usually doesn&#39;t either.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen similar amounts of erectile tissue in some squirting videos. Which is basically the only reliable representation of a female orgasm I&#39;ve managed to find online.

This exactly. The vast majority of porn is on some level of faking it. Also sadly the a very large number of cis porn stars get labiaplasty to meet a certain look..... And as a sign of how F-ed up our &#34;society&#34; is... That &#34;certain look&#34; is disturbingly close to prepubescent.....just.... Ugh..

Personality I hope to have a significant labia minora when &amp; if im able to get bottom surgery

I agree. But I thought you were talking specifically about the erectile tissue.

Definitely not. This looks nothing like Suporn, Bank, or Prae.

It’s in her post history, and it’s not from Suporn Clinic.

The clinic can&#39;t even write their post op manuals without them being very clearly full of Thai grammatical errors. The idea that the clinic has bots to &#34;defend&#34; them is hilarious.

Trust me, you&#39;d know lmfao

Probably because you can’t tell one surgeon from another.

There&#39;s 0% chance that pussy came out of the Suporn Clinic even without checking her profile to see where it did come from.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s clearly not even the same technique. They do

not

do the introitus that way.
