At this stage I&#39;m planning on seeing Cardenas in Mexico for FFS after months researching different surgeons, facial team was my first pick for a while though the price difference is quite substantial.
</p>
<p>
I received my quote from Cardenas for: - Type 3 forehead reconstruction  - w/hairline advancement/brow lift - rhinoplasty  - upper lip lift - jaw &amp; chin contouring  With accomodation, hospital bills, anesthesia, transport included for  a total of $17,800 USD.
</p>
<p>
Right now my total budget was around $25,000 AUD (close to 18k USD)  He does seem to be amongst the most experienced FFS surgeons within this price range,  There&#39;s a lot of positive reviews from other girls that have seen him and the quality of his results seem pretty consistent.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m interested to hear from others that have seen/thought about seeing him and there thoughts/experience compared to other surgeons.

Well I am pretty happy with my choice having gone to him (I got everything done, minus the lip lift). I will say that if you&#39;re staying at the recovery house they will make sure everything goes smoothly before and after the surgery. The consultation that j had with him the day before the surgery I will say was surprisingly brief considering I was getting 6 different things done. I believe it&#39;s due to this brief nature that I have seen various posts about him being rude. I personally had a great time talking to him where both he and I were making jokes back and forth Everytime I saw him. I think a part of that was my trust in him and me telling him I trusted his professional experience more than my impossible wants. This joking and sweet nature extends to his entire staff.
</p>
<p>
I know there is the notion for many that hospital/Mexico can be a scary place for surgery or general procedures but I assure you that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. The hospital (which feels more like a spa than anything else to be honest) was cleaner than any hospital I&#39;ve been to here in the US. For the recovery house (which I would tottay recommend) was in hindsight the best decision about the trip. Is it expensive? Yup. Is it worth it. Absolutely. Sonia, Marie, the cleaning ladies were essentially my loving mother&#39;s for the 2 weeks I was there. I had excessive swelling and couldn&#39;t really function for the first week and they were BEYOND caring, feeding me for the first few days, and even helped me bathe/shower. Also the constant food is a plus (granted I couldn&#39;t really open my mouth after the surgery).
</p>
<p>
I will say the only regret I have about it is maybe clarifying how aggressive I wanted him to be with my chin in particular. But he did great work and I&#39;m super happy I went :)

Same! I definitely echo that sentiment. Sonia and Mari were amazing. Same with Dr. Cardenas and everyone at the hospital. Love my results and could not have had a better experience.

Great to hear this, your results are amazing! The recovery house in particular is a huge plus imo.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard a few people say that as well about his bedside manner etc over kinda small things that are pretty irrelevant to me, he can speak English and is experienced performing the surgeries which is the main thing.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be sure to pick his brains during the consultation though,  were you given any indication to what your face would look like after the surgery? Nose shape, new jaw line etc?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d probably be more scared having surgery in Thailand compared to Mexico tbh, normal for people to be concerned with there safety but if you try and evaluate the risk logically the only time something could really happen would between arriving at the airport and getting straight into the drivers car etc if you&#39;re not there to go sightseeing, plus the hospital / facilitates there seem a bit nicer imo.

Thank you, the FFS has totally helped me with my confidence. I will say it was so beyond bizarre waking up and seeing a different face.... Even till today, 2 months out. It&#39;s interesting to say the least!
</p>
<p>
Honestly like I said I thought he was really sweet and funny. I think the people who perceived him negatively probably were just being a bit too idealistic or snooty....who knows. I think he really just returns the vibe that you give out is what I imagine. I even saw him at the very end of his work day so I&#39;m sure he was exhausted but was still super polite. And like you said, even if he was the biggest A hole, he is good at what he does and has a ton of experience.
</p>
<p>
Honestly I think maybe why he was polite with me to is because I literally told him &#34;fix this in whatever way you see fit&#34; he asked did I want x &#34;ehh a bit it&#39;s not a huge concern&#34; do you want Y? &#34;Yeah it&#39;s my biggest concern&#34;  I figured I had my hopes and we went over those things briefly (he was relatively quick all things considered, I think it&#39;s funny that to trans women this is a life changing surgery that affects us in Wonderful ways ... To him it was a Tuesday evening at 7pm). I had my hopes, but I also figured the surgeon who has been doing it for decades knew just slightly more than my Snapchat desires and fantasies :)
</p>
<p>
If you use the recovery house you literally walk out of customs, and have someone to deliver you all over the city to your appointments so it removes all sense of being lost or scared. Like the doors from customs opened.... Then wham! Got greeted, had a lovely conversation then went to hospital directly from the airport. Nothing at all worrisome. I think as Americans we always have a TAKEN movie fear :)

Oh. I would say he is more conservative. But I feel when you have conservative subtle changes all over the face it feels like it was aggressive overall. I&#39;m really pleased with how he went about everything and the extent to which he did.

I&#39;m nearly 2 years post FFS with Dr. Cardenas. I had type III forehead and lip lift only at the time, though I may eventually go back to him for jaw and chin.
</p>
<p>
The only negative from my experience was they moved my surgery a day early right after I arrived. It&#39;s only negative because it did cause some anxiety, but overall I was glad to get it all done quicker instead of a day of worrying.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very happy with the results and, as others say, it&#39;s very very much worth it to stay in the recovery house.
</p>
<p>
FFS was definitely life changing for me.

I’m three months post with Dr Lazaro Cardenas and quite happy with how things have healed.
</p>
<p>
I highly recommend the recovery house. I’m not sure what my partner and I would of done that first week without it.
