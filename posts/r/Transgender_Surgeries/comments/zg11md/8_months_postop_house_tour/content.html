I don&#39;t know why Reddit didn&#39;t allow me to post the explanation with the video, so here it goes:
</p>
<p>
This was my first in-person appoint with Dr. Laungani (GrS Montreal) after the surgery, 8 months after the fact. I live in another Province, so my previous follow-ups with him were remote.
</p>
<p>
I asked him to explain what was what and have my partner record it, because I wasn&#39;t super sure (labia minora, anyone? XD). So he went around explaining. I had also told him I wasn&#39;t being able to get aroused by touch, and I was worried sensitivity was an issue. So he touched me ever-so- slightly... and my partner made us all laugh out loud! XD
</p>
<p>
Hopefully you&#39;ll see how the final product looks for the GrS Montreal surgeons, if you&#39;re wondering!
</p>
<p>
P.S.: I had a zero depth vaginoplasty, and without dilating, a small skin bridge formed on the back of the inner walls of my labia. Dr. Laungani and I had already talked about it, and I preferred to let it be, as it is not being a hassle. I also had *major* dehiscence shortly after the surgery, and it seems like it didn&#39;t affect the end result much. Still 4 months to go before it&#39;s fully, fully healed, though.

I saw a few comments regarding hair that went to my e-mail but I can&#39;t see to find them here.
</p>
<p>
For those who don&#39;t know, the technique they use in GrS Montreal doesn&#39;t require any prior hair removal. You just need to use a depilatory cream the night before the surgery. Not shaving - it has to be a depilatory cream so they can see the follicles well. By what Dr. Laungani told me, he cuts the skin layer, turns the skin around, and cauterizes the hair follicles through the underside. I think only GrS and some other hospital use this technique, as far as I know?
</p>
<p>
Also, I asked him if it could be done on the face and neck and he said no, destroying my hopes, hahaha!

Re: &#34;you&#39;re doing better than I did&#34;: Try two-handed if you haven&#39;t already. One hand to just sort of pull everything upwards, and then have at with the other hand.

<p>
All looks good, too.

Oh, good idea! I realized that trying to stay around the hood like it seems to work for people born with clitorises doesn&#39;t work for me. I didn&#39;t manage to get an orgasm yet, but during this visit the doctor said we could really go at it, there&#39;s no more risk of &#34;breaking&#34; anything. So I gave it a try last night and it was muuuuuch better. No orgasm yet, but I
<em>
almost
</em>
got there.

There’s no need because it’s your problem, not theirs. Women have had post-op hair there before.

Oh ok thank you I wasn&#39;t aware.  I was just told by my HRT Dr. To start later hair removal so I did. Plus I have read about it that it was a mandatory requirement for bottom surgery that&#39;s why I asked.  It&#39;s not like I haven&#39;t shaved it my hole life now anyway and I gotta say I don&#39;t miss doing that. Thanks 😊

Some doctors require it!! This specific case does not require it. Ask your surgeon please, laser may be required.

I liked him. My only recommendation is to ask questions. He&#39;s knowledgeable and has very good bedside manners. But he&#39;ll not provide much information if you don&#39;t ask, he&#39;ll assume you&#39;re literate on the subject. That was an obstacle to me in the sense that I thought I was educated on it, but I so wasn&#39;t. Recovery took me by surprise.

You mean about struggling to orgasm? That has really been bothering me, honestly. Despite me getting almost there last night, it was still such a blue ball sensation, a feeling of... I don&#39;t know, impatience? I&#39;m trying not to think too much about it, but it&#39;s hard.
</p>
<p>
Do you know if it gets easier over time? Or is it always going to be super difficult?

No. The little piece of what he called “debris.” The colloquial term is “dingleberry.” Not unusual to have a little bit of paper left when we wipe.
</p>
<p>
As for reaching climax, I didn’t even try until I was about three months post. After that, it took about another month for me to figure out how it all worked.
</p>
<p>
I learned that while before I could have a boygasm with almost no effort, my girlgasms took considerably more focus. I had to clear my mind and be undisturbed and absolutely patient with my body, because these climaxes are total body experiences. And what an experience! Light years better than anything I experienced before. When I finally had sex, it was the most amazing thing I have ever known.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure you’ll get there. Getting out of your own head and relaxing is the most important part.
</p>
<p>
I wish you all the best!

Hahahaha! I didn&#39;t know there was slang for stray pieces of toilet paper! Looooove it! Hahahah!
</p>
<p>
In all honesty, I only started trying sporadically 3 months ago. I was afraid of hurting things, because it seems like my healing was a bit more complicated. It took him telling me that &#34;nothing would break&#34; for me to be brave enough to go deeper, and it paid off. As I said, not orgasm, but light years better than anything I had achieved before that.
</p>
<p>
Also, it was during this visit that I learned the urethra is actually below the labia minora (on the introitus side), so I don&#39;t need to wipe the clitoris! Hopefully no more dingleberries, hahahaha!

Babywipes (non-scented) are a gal’s best friend.   I prefer that over toilet paper but if out and about and only TP is on hand-  pat dry after urinating!!Wiping isn’t necessary and you’ll avoid pieces of Tp getting shredded and stuck.

“Goodbye To Dingleberries” sounds like the title to an awful novel. 😂😂😂
</p>
<p>
I was the same way. My swelling seemed to abate more slowly than most and my libido also took awhile to come back online as the nerve bundle reconfigured itself to a feminine purpose.
</p>
<p>
I got really frustrated for awhile, scared I wouldn’t be able to orgasm. Like you, I would get really close and then . . . oh well.
</p>
<p>
I likened it to Dorothy falling asleep in the poppy field in sight of the Emerald City.
</p>
<p>
When I finally did, I told my bestie, “Dorothy made it all the way through the door to the Emerald City!”
</p>

My surgery was done by public health in Canada. So we don’t have an actual written limit on follow-ups.
</p>
<p>
But the reason I was seen at eight months were a few: First, I thought I had sensitivity issues, and the surgeon wanted to see if everything was OK.
</p>
<p>
Second, I live out of Quebec, so I took the opportunity that I was visiting Montreal to be seen in person. It was the first in-person follow-up after the surgery.
</p>
<p>
So, it’s not like 8 months is a special milestone. It was just my first time back in the city, and I took the chance to be seen in person.
