Ok I understand, you add /embed?pub=true after that and it works!
</p>
<p>
We both have the same thing I noticed on all Chett and Suporn: the chonburi organ, the blue tissue under the clit, is uh blue. I wish they hald told me about the looks. I&#39;d have opted out bc normal esthetic matter most.
</p>
<p>
Everything else is fine - just this and the lack of hood (the fourchette is a free revision)

I may see about adding something to the sub to do this this automatically, and flag NSFW while I&#39;m at it.

IMHO the absolute best esthetic results are given by Chett. And I say that as someone who didn&#39;t go to Chett.
</p>
<p>
But he has too much variance, so on average Suporn looks better. I didn&#39;t want to roll the dice and depend on Chett having a good day.
</p>
<p>
So I played it safe lol

I consider asking Chett to do the hood. It&#39;s just a matter of sewing the labia around the clit nicely.

The best I’ve ever seen is by Suporn with revisions, but it’s not public. Unfortunately there few photos published post revision.

You mean on the &#34;secret&#34; fb?
</p>
<p>
Got my revision and I&#39;m not thrilled. I&#39;d like the hood done in a normal way, with the clit properly hooded at the top instead of 1/3 of a inch below and not really hooded.
</p>
<p>
If you still have that pic, would you care to share by PM a crop of just the clit hood? Was it Bang or Suporn??

It was Suporn and not perfect by any means, just

good. It’s not public anywhere and I can’t share it.
</p>
<p>
You went to Suporn? You should have access to the Facebook group and discord if you want. I assume there’s some revision photos in those.

If there&#39;s somewhere a convincing pic of the hood make by Bang, or if Chett things it&#39;s fixable I may go back.
</p>
<p>
But I took down all my social media and I want it to stay that way. I don&#39;t want to do discord - I don&#39;t want to be tracked.

<p>
Sorry I&#39;m a privacy freak lol.

BTW could you post or PM a imgur link for this post that works without the nsfw login? I&#39;m not gonna create a imgur login - I think I&#39;m not alone there

Hi! I&#39;m in the process of reading all of the wiki posts for Dr. Chettawut (I previously read all the posts for Dr. Bank)
</p>
<p>
I have a question on this
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/f78czk/i_am_a_little_self_conscious_when_i_have_sex/" rel="nofollow">reply
</a>
you made on a Dr. Chettawut post 4 years ago.

<p>
It&#39;s kind of hard to make out the context because it was a reply to a post that is now deleted, but if I read &#34;between the lines&#34; it sounds like you are saying that Suporn Clinic does not permit you to post pictures of revisions. Is that true? If so, any idea why that is? (especially since posting pictures of primary op seems to be permitted)
</p>
<p>
If that is true it is kind of startling to me because it&#39;s the sort of thing I&#39;d expect from surgeons who don&#39;t do very good work, which certainly is not the reputation of the Suporn Clinic that I&#39;ve seen.
</p>
<p>
Thanks much if you remember anything about what the context was. And thanks again for your work on the WIKI, I&#39;d be lost without it.

Suporn Clinic doesn’t care what you post.
</p>
<p>
I restored some of the deleted comments.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen results that are not posted publicly and many of those that have been posted and now deleted, and a number in person. I’ll update my opinion though, the best I’ve seen are now Dr Bank.

Can you explain what you mean by &#34;instead of 1/3 of an inch below&#34;? I&#39;m super interested in Chonburi and especially what they can do with revisions but having trouble picturing what you mean

The minor labia are like ()
</p>
<p>
The clit is a dot between (.) about 1/3 inches below the top of the parenthesis instead of being at the top of the parenthesis, and inbetween folds of skin on either side (^)
</p>
<p>
Being inbetween defines the hood. Imagine a hoodie. When the hood is on your head, your head had clothes all around, that &#34;meet&#34; at the chin level
</p>
<p>
The problem with Suporn is that it&#39;s more of a Jedi robe that a hoodie, so it doesn&#39;t meet at the chin level. And not just that, but the cape is like floating a little above your head.
</p>
<p>
I hope that clears it bc That&#39;s the best I can do with words.

Thanks! That was a great description once I looked at some female anatomy diagrams. You did sort of lose me on the hoodie vs robe thing, in particular the chin part (the clitoral hood just goes over the top of the clitoris, no?) but I understand what you mean about the hooding not being snug enough and also the different placement of the clit (I guess there&#39;s only so much you can do with SRS, I&#39;ve not seen anyone&#39;s post-op photos regardless of surgeon where their clit is at the point where the labia minora meet).
</p>
<p>
Thanks again!
</p>
<p>
btw would you say your result at least passes fairly well? Your description sounds like something people like us might notice under scrutiny but it still sounds really cis-like to me.
</p>
<p>
also did you see bank or suporn yourself?
