I am truly amazed and grateful for the healing capability of our bodies. I was on an emotional rollercoaster between weeks 3 &amp; 5 because of suture pain/discomfort, aesthetics, and anxiety. But since then, further healing has now alleviated my worries and concerns that things weren’t going well for me. I half write this for myself as a future reminder when things may not be going as I envisioned and also for any peers who may be anxiety ridden in early post op weeks after confirmation surgery. I now have more optimism that my body may heal the labia minora retraction I’ve experienced in a way that I may accept and not want a revision surgery. Time will tell!!

Congrats! I think you must have had yours done a week before me (also with Wittenberg). I hope you continue to see many improvements and healing!

So happy for you! What is the biggest surprise of the recovery and what is something you wished you prepared more before surgery?

Okay so, these may sound silly but I’m speaking very candidly. The biggest surprises of recovery that I’ve encountered are that the recovery process does not monotonically get easier and easier. I foolishly thought as time progressed healing would just keep getting simpler but in actuality, I’ve had set backs arise along the way. Making healing more of an up and down. With that said, despite my mental preparation, I’ve also realized that recovery is a mental marathon and not a sprint.
</p>
<p>
As far as what I wish I prepared more before surgery would be 1) reading even more personal accounts in this sub that detailed complications/difficulties during recovery to have better prepared me for their possibility, how to mentally and emotionally handle them, and researched how they’ve healed &amp; 2) working out more and eating better in the 2 months leading up to surgery as the sedimentary recovery has decreased healthy muscle mass and I’m still not cleared to resume working out.

Absolutely. This needs to said over and over in terms of non-linear improvement during recovery. You have to be both diligent and flexible as to potential problems and setbacks that can send you into a spiral of worry and pain. Not that it always happens, it doesn&#39;t. Just don&#39;t be embarrassed or let depression and fear keep you from seeking support.

Exactly. My pride was the biggest reason for my sad emotion through accepting my unexpected healing. Lean on each other and accept that it may not always go “perfectly.” Regardless, don’t be embarrassed

Thank you. I was just spiraling about things that could go wrong with surgery. It’s nice to see that things can go right.

Don’t get me wrong, things can certainly go wrong in recovery and I highly recommend researching and making yourself prepared for those possibilities. Ahead of my surgery, I consciously chose to avoid reading about this sort of thing because I would tend to obsess and worry but then not informing myself caused w lack of preparation which increases one’s anxiety. Make yourself ready for anything! I’m glad my post has helped because I really wanted to highlight that things have unexpectedly “gone wrong” but in just 1-2 weeks time they’ve improved. Be patient!

Congrats!! I&#39;m currently 2.5 weeks out and was in the midst of freaking out about how things are healing, it&#39;s really reassuring to hear how much better things got for you :)

Congratulations as well! Rest assured you’ll likely be impressed with how much changing will take place in the next few weeks. You’ve totally got this! ❤️
