I used Dr. Spiegel in Boston.  He and his team were fantastic.  Reddit has a group that is anti “Spiegel”, but I found him very capable, diligent, and trustworthy.  I don’t regret my decision at all.
</p>
<p>
I do wish my nose was more feminine, but it does have quite a bit of swelling still, along with the jaw, but I am pleased with the results at this point in time.  I have had typical post op depression, but it is getting better day by day.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, as others have said changes will continue to occur for weeks to months post op regarding FFS surgery?!?!  I’d appreciate others comments on this for my own sanity.
</p>
<p>
I read your post about FFS and children.  I have two children, ages 7 and 9.  I was gone for about a week and came back and they were fine.  I gave them some forewarning that I would look rough and FaceTimed with them a few times while gone/recovering…they haven’t seemed perturbed or upset about the facial changes at all.  I don’t think anyone is as critical as yourself.

Yeah you’re going to be fine re: changes. There this funny thing that happens (especially with jaw and nose) where bone is taken away (or cartilage) and that has a massive effect, but then swelling make it seem like very little was done because the swelling replaces that lost volume and shape. It’s completely normal for people to feel weird about their results/underestimate how much was done in the first weeks and months of healing. Typically for jaw and nose you’re looking at like minimum 3-6 months to start seeing what it will eventually look like and there are people who still have changes at a year. The key now is patience and knowing that those feelings about it are normal.

Thank you so much for this! I think I’m more concerned about their mom making into a traumatic event for them rather than their actual real response to it. Your survey results look really great.

I’m very early in the process of arranging FFS. How long would you say it took to get your consultation and then have the surgery?
</p>
<p>
You look beautiful, by the way. Congratulations!

I made my surgical deposit May 2022, surgery was Dec 2022.  So I’d say between 7-9 months. I can’t remember how long I had to wait for the consult in May (a few months?).

Thank you! I believe I heard that Spiegel is more conservative in his approach than others. Is that correct? He seems to have done excellent work here.
