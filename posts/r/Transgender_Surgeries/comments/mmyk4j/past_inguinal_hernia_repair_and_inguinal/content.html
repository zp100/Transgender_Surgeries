I had an inguinal hernia repair (with mesh) about three years before my full vaginoplasty (inc. orchiectomy). I mentioned the hernia repair to my GRS surgeon, but they didn&#39;t see any issue or have any concern with it. X

I would ask Dr Raphael. It would depend on what kind of inguinal hernia and how it was done: direct v indirect and was mesh or wires used. Regardless there is scarring. Some prefer inguinal as more complete spermatic cord removal and no scrotal scar and maybe less scrotal swelling. I believe most do vertical midline incision through scrotum since scar not an issue and if not a cancer operation.

I know someone who had an inguinal hernia repair with mesh so the doctor decided on scrotal path orchiectomy instead of dealing with the mesh.  It depends on the surgeons preference so it&#39;s worth asking them.

I&#39;m having a planned inguinal orchi soon-ish (surgery date keeps being pushed &gt;_&gt;), and I had an inguinal hernia repair when I was a child. I don&#39;t have a mesh in.
<br>
My surgeon said that it depends on the scar tissue, as if it has stuck the tissue layers together too much, it might not be possible to get into the inguinal canals to do the surgery. He also mentioned there being a large risk of hernias developing due to this.
<br>
I was told that in the worst case where he wouldn&#39;t be able to unstick the tissue, he&#39;s go for the scrotal midline incision method.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m assuming with a mesh it&#39;s a no-go to have it done that way.
