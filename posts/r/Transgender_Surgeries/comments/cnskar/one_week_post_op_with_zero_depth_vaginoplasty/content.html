Iâ€™m one week post op with Dr. Gallagher. On my week check up the nurse took out my catheter, and I anticipated the packing that I thought was sticking out of my vagina. The nurse proceeds to tell me that I have no packing and the bloody bubble that is protruding is actually my clit. I almost threw up all over the room. I chose this operation for its less invasiveness, however Iâ€™m left scared to death with what my results are going to be. I contacted the office on my way home after my appointment with the nurse asking if I could speak to Gallagher. They want me to come in tomorrow however Iâ€™m three hours away and I donâ€™t have anyone to take me. So I sent in a picture and when they called me today (who again wasnâ€™t the doctor) they said Gallagher told them in an email that everything is fine, itâ€™s just very swollen. Lay up and ice it from time to time. Which I believe her I really do, I just want to hear it come from her directly that this isnâ€™t some oddity that has never happened. Iâ€™ll attach a photo in this thread because I want other girls to let me know what they think. It doesnt hurt but when I say itâ€™s sticking out I mean Iâ€™ve literally never seen anything like this before. It scares me that itâ€™s just going to fall off. So please please girls give me your transparency and your thoughts. I hope you can ease my mind because right now Iâ€™m in so much shock and I havenâ€™t stopped crying. Again itâ€™s only been a week but I never imagined this would have been my reality.

If you are only a week out, I would try to relax. Itâ€™s going to take awhile for everything to settle down.

It will reduce in size. Itâ€™s just gone through a lot of trauma and needs time to recover. Everything will change week by week or quite a few months, even with the zero depth option.

I am sorry you are going through that. I wonder what kind of technique your surgeon uses. I had SRS about 6 weeks ago and I only saw my clitoris once, because it is buried below the still somewhat swollen labia minora that I am not allowed to spread.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I don&#39;t know yours look like, but hopefully it will heal up into a regular-sized clitoris after some time. All kinds of complications can happen. I hope your surgeon helps you instead of just saying &#34;it is normal&#34; every time you are worried about something, especially something that to you seems abnormal (I happen to be going through a similar thing with my surgeon).

You could try right clicking the photo and select &#34;copy image link&#34; then paste that.

I mean, my vulva never looked terrifying. It was swollen, yes, full of stitches, yes, but I would also feel scared and worried if I was in OP&#39;s shoes.

Hi there, I also just had a vaginoplasty with Dr. Gallagher on the 29th (pull-through peritoneal, not zero-depth) and my clit results seem to be basically the same as yours at the moment. I&#39;m mildly concerned about it, but hearing that you are going through the same thing has ironically made me feel somewhat better. At the followup they also told me that it was super swollen and that I should just wait until it fully heals.
</p>
<p>
In particular, in my case there is what appears to be a pinkish-reddish layer of squishy clotted blood covering the lower part of the clitoris (at first I thought it was actual tissue from somewhere, but that seems unlikely now). The upper part is covered in a black layer of hardened blood, basically a large scab. Several sutures protrude from the upper part, and are slowly falling out or getting dissolved.
</p>
<p>
The sutures have caused quite a bit of discomfort, since they tend to poke into the surrounding areas when I move, but I&#39;ve found that I can tape a small piece of gauze over the area and it largely resolves the problem.
</p>
<p>
The clit itself is not very sensitive to touch right now (presumably in part because it&#39;s covered in blood), but I have noticed that I can actually achieve a small orgasm by using a pillow to stimulate the vulva as a whole and put pressure on the internal erectile tissue. I just have to be careful, since the prickly sutures can make it painful.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m reasonably certain that we&#39;ll both be fine, although I definitely sympathize with the frustration and worry that comes with not being able to see your actual clit for a while. Outside of this, my results have been satisfactory.
</p>
