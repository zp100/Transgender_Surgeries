I had a look, but I can&#39;t work out what you&#39;re referring to.
</p>
<p>
Would you mind saying who her surgeon was?

I&#39;ve basically no idea, but it sounds like it&#39;s not causing an immediate problem, apart from being worrying. Assuming she needs a revision and can get a surgeon to do it, the usual thing is to continue dilating and wait a year.
</p>
<p>
I guess you know this, but the fix for depth is usually colovaginoplasty. There&#39;s a surgeon in Serbia who is known for fixing problems.

Peritoneal is something we have been looking into... but she can&#39;t wait years for revision and afaik there is only one place in India (we&#39;re never going there, we&#39;ve heard some nasty stories) and Dr ting which has been swamped.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The technique is called Davydov Procedure and a number of surgeons use it worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Surgeons who offer Peritoneal Vaginoplasty ( there are more, those are some well known ones):
</p>
<p>
Dr. Heidi Wittenberg – San Francisco
<br>
Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner – New York City
<br>
Dr. Jess Ting – New York City
<br>
Dr. Miroslav Djordjevic – Belgrade, Serbia (genitalsurgerybelgrade)
<br>
Dr. Parag Telang - Mumbai, India
</p>
<p>
It may be an option to make a few photos and send it to a few surgeons, and ask what their opinion would be. Many surgeons do revisions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://phuket-plasticsurgery.com/fees.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
is an example from Thailand
</p>
<p>
-&gt; Post GRS procedures
</p>
<p>
And many surgeons recommend to regularly eat unsweetened yoghurt after surgery. It can help repopulate the digestve tract after antibiotics with beneficial bacteria, and also a neovagina.
</p>
<p>
And it may be a good idea to keep levels of estrogen well in the female range. A neovagina can react to estrogen like a cis vagina and there can be dryness and even some atrophy otherwise, like in menopausal people. Some people additionally dilate with estrogen cream from time to time.
</p>
<p>
And some people go down with frequency of dilation a bit in case. Dilation can put strain on the tissue and one option could be going down a bit with frequency ( just a bit ).
</p>
<p>
Talk it all through with your med persons in case, like if she should not eat milk products together with antibiotics, if she uses any.

You&#39;re welcome.
</p>
<p>
As said taking a few photos and emailing a number of surgeons may be a good idea. Many surgeons do revisons and surgeons that have some kind of reputation for revisons are for example genitalsurgerybelgrade and Bluebond-Lagner. Making a few photos and asking them for advice asap about what could be done now may be a good idea. They may know a few things that could help even before having a revision.
</p>
<p>
It may be possible to indicate in the headline or the text it would be urgent and that you would really like some advice concerning what could be done now.
</p>
<p>
Some people for example have used a small dilator to dilate at least for depth. And there is a lube called surgilube which contains antibiotics. It may be necessary to discuss if it would help using it for a few days.
</p>
<p>
Some people dilate with estrogen cream because it can help softening the tissue . Etc.
</p>
<p>
And the frequency of dilation may also have an influence .. if a few short sessions may be better, or fewer and longer sessions.
</p>
<p>
In general asking experienced surgeons for advice imo may be a good idea.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
she believes the Davydov Procedure is not tested enough on trans women
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well there are a number of surgeons who have some experience, which may be a big factor imo.

Fly her to Germany, that&#39;s the best advice I can give you. People in Denmark haven&#39;t got a clue about what they&#39;re doing and horror stories are not uncommon.

Amnesty International had a campaign with an extensive report about the way things were in dk about 3, 4 years ago. Talk to the local community, it probably won&#39;t be difficult to find.

Just my first instinct, but could it just be granulation tissue? I know that’s a common complication that I

think

looks and acts like that?

Granulation is usually far more red and bumpy. This looks a lot more like a vaginal prolapse. I would say mild but honestly I don&#39;t know how that normally looks in trans women and I&#39;m sure there is a lot of variability based on technique.

That is incredibly frustrating :/
</p>
<p>
Any medical doctor should be able to diagnose a prolapse. It&#39;s a physical thing. It&#39;s something you can determine through physical examination. It&#39;s not some mystical transgender thing.

Does the “thingy” protrude out of the entrance to the vagina? It’s hard to tell with the camera angle.
</p>
<p>
It looks like the top of the vaginal canal to me, or it could also be the urethral meatus. I wouldn’t worry about it.

Do you think it’s just the bottom of the vaginal lining? In some positions the canal can curve upward.
</p>
<p>
The only other explanation is that maybe it’s another growth? You said she had one before

I&#39;m really saddened by what your partner is going through, especially the part about her urinary situation. Is she able to urinate ok? How is her urethra today? Does she have difficulties voiding?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m one and a year post op and I had a very similar experience where I was unable urinate after they took out my catheter. I ended flying home and going into the Emergency Room where the urologist on duty that evening had to poke holes into me just to find my urethra. Thank GOD he was able to find my urethra and I ended up with the catheter again for a week and a half. I&#39;m still traumatized by that experience until this day. We girls go through so much with our bodies and  I hope she&#39;s able to get her situation resolved. Stay Strong and God Bless You!
