I am three days post op after a tracheal shave and apart from a little tightness, I have no discomfort. My throat was perfect when I woke up after the surgery. The &#34;result&#34; was soft and flat. But since yesterday, the bump has returned and it‚Äôs hard. Just swollen? Anyone have experience?

I&#39;m ftm and didn&#39;t have a trachaeal shave, but I&#39;d like to add that with almost every surgery it is very common for things to be smooth out of surgery and then to become more swollen for a few days before it goes down again. That&#39;s part of the healing process. Hopefully someone else with that specific surgery can give you a more reassuring answer, but maybe that&#39;s already helpful to hear. I wish you a good recovery!

He who is responsible for the vast majority of gender-confirming surgerys at the largest hospital in Sweden, so he should not be bad. Do you have experience with Tracheal shave? Would like answers about the swelling/bump I have, whether it is common, nothing else pls

I dont know how it is in sweden, but here in the netherlands it might be a problem that gender confirmation surgery surgeons also do ffs and such, because generally they are not taught for it resulting in complications. About this case, other people have answered already, and i dont know, but should be good.

Hi üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I&#39;m one month post op voice feminization and trachea shave. In a visual aspect I don&#39;t see any bump or trachea in frontal view but when I see from side views it might appear a little bit But not like same as trachea it might appear like swollen esophagus. Yours I think too seems like that! My doc said your body needs at least 3 months to get heal properly so be patientü§ç.

Thank you thank youü§ç So you would guess that the bump I&#39;ve got now is simply a swelling? It&#39;s reassuring in that case, because I was a little panicked when I woke up with a wonderful neck and a few days later I got a bump/adams apple back ü•∫

Swelling is worst 48 hours after surgery. I had the same result. It‚Äôs surprising the doctor didn‚Äôt mention that to you.
</p>
<p>
Nothing to worry about, it should go down noticeably within the first week, I was pretty much fine in 2-4 weeks

It‚Äôs hard to say what is specifically related to the surgery and what is just due to the vocal training I‚Äôve done. I didn‚Äôt notice anything so concerning that I thought it related to my surgery if that helps.
</p>
<p>
Overall I‚Äôm really happy I did it even though it wasn‚Äôt as much of a reduction as I hoped

Imidiate appearance are not final results, as the swelling subsides the cartilage in the larynx will be more visable than it was when it was postoperatively swollen. The larynx wont be as defined as it was preop, but it will probably end up a little more visable than it was during the first few days postop. That was my experience with my own surgery, it is also my experience with post operative swelling in patients in general. The inflamatory stage of a cut this size should be about a week, during that time it will be the most swollen. How long you will be swollen is hard to tell, but in about a month you will probabaly have a good idea about the final results. That said. It looks really good!

So as it looked right after the surgery is not an approximate appearance that the result will be? Or what do you mean? Thank you for taking the time to respond!ü§çü§ç But then you think that what stands out now is swelling? Because it did not stand out like that for the first two days, but it came afterwards. Sorry if I seem sluggish or so hahah, but I&#39;m worried

Not really. Not much can be said from fresh cuts except like. The quality of the stitches and if you got bruised alot or not. You might have swolllen, you usually swell a bit more the first day or so as you say. But depending on your body, you might be swollen already when you wake up. It is very hard to evaluate results from day one appearance.  Ill use myself as exemple. I was swollen when I woke up, but being given a shitfuck of cortisone the swelling subsided within hours, as the cortisone wore of, it swelled up a bit again the day after. Im now like 1.5 years post and it looks really good, but does not look much like day one, nor day two or fourteen. It takes time to heal. Focus on healing and give it a week or two before you worry about final aesthetics, because Im pretty sure it&#39;ll turn out good!

Ok. Looking at pictures again, I think it might be swelling we are seeing tho. I am not really sure as I cant poke it. Drink water, stay calm. I think and hope this will heal up satisfactory!

I can not properly discribe the tactile feeling of swollen soft tissue in english, but post operative swelling is as a rule not hard. Is more like. Dense?  Give it a few weeks. As it heals and unswells we will know.  You should probably not poke it to much tho

The swelling has subsided and it looks much better now. From the front, however, you can still see some contours of the Adam&#39;s apple, but from the sides it looks nice. The thing is that I am quite skinny, so I hope it is even less visible when I have managed to gain a little weight.

Hey. I‚Äôm glad the swelling went down and that your Adam‚Äôs apple is less visible. Keep in mind that cis women have Adam‚Äôs apples too and some even quite visible ones so if yours is just a little visible that‚Äôs probably no problem passing wise.

<p>
May I ask if you had any problems with your voice after you had the surgery?

The swelling has subsided and it looks much better now. From the front, however, you can still see some contours of the Adam&#39;s apple, but from the sides it looks nice. The thing is that I am quite skinny, so I hope it is even less visible when I have managed to gain a little weight :)
