Healing very well, upped a dialator size at my 2.5 week follow-up to blue from purple. Recovery continues to go easy with minimal pain. Left labia tissue still has stiffness, but right has softened totally, but still a little swollen.
</p>
<p>
Sitting up is getting easier all the time, but still uncomfortable.

Congrat my dear!!! In a few sort months... all of the early struggles will feel like a nightmare, and that kitty will feel like she&#39;s always been there!!!!

Honestly, I&#39;ve had a pretty easy time to date; mostly just discomfort and an annoying interruption to my regular life.
</p>
<p>
Would be nice if I weren&#39;t so horny with no ability to resolve that issue.

Yeah,  it&#39;s really not THAT bad.... but looking back, the &#34;hard part&#34; seems far off... almost surreal....
</p>
<p>
My pelvic floor physical therapist and my surgeon both gave me green light for stimulation at about 2 or 3 weeks... part of the literature recommended a &#34;
<em>
massager
</em>
&#34; to help retrain nerves... I used it on scar lines often, really helped stop pain and train them to have normal sensation... and one day near the mons... it felt REALLY good, bit I didn&#39;t know if I should continue... and contacted my care team. Once I was cleared, I spent a little more time there and finally had some long awaited release.... I couldn&#39;t put in near actual clitoris or anything... but at that point... I didn&#39;t even need to...
