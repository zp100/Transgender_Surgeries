I had vaginoplasty with Dr. John Pang at Mount Sinai here in NYC last week on Monday, August 12th. Pang is a sweetheart and by all accounts the proceedure was a rousing success with no complications. I had my first follow-up appointment this Tuesday, August 20th and was told everything looked great. Next Tuesday is my second follow-up during which he said he&#39;d schedule my FFS. (!!!! Like 3 months from now !!!)
</p>
<p>
The experience has been surprisingly nearly pain free. At most I&#39;ll take a few Tylenol. Physically, at any rate.
</p>
<p>
This event is the most important thing to happen to me and I&#39;m over the moon happy to have finally been rid of what I considered a birth defect. However it&#39;s very importantance is what&#39;s been driving me crazy. I try my best to do everything right, like dilate on time and stay in bed but I&#39;m terrified I&#39;m not doing things right. That I&#39;m not dilating hard enough, that I walk too much, etc. I think I might be hurting myself by pushing too hard. Not being able to sleep on my side has destroyed my sanity and I often have to break this rule. Could someone please just tell me everything is going to be okay?

You&#39;re gone be fine. Don&#39;t push harder than the Dr said though. Definitely don&#39;t want to risk damaging your healing. Xoxo ðŸ’‹

Worrying about everything is normal (and will fade over time), but do take it easy. You might ask if you can sleep on your side with a pillow between your legs, I was told that was okay and it was the most relieving thing in the world.

Things look good. There was never any discoloration.

I know he at least also offers FFS, but other than that I&#39;m not sure. He&#39;s part of Sinai&#39;s Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, so I would assume his focus is in that area.
</p>
<p>
At my first dilation the nurse measured 5.5 - 6&#34; but I think it&#39;s closer to 5.5 because I might have been overzealous with the pressure I was applying.
</p>
<p>
I started the process on July 17th, 2018, consultation acquired in January for a June 6th, 2019 consultation, original surgery date of August 22nd, bumped up to August 12th.
</p>
<p>
By the way Pang&#39;s plan includes laser hair removal at Sinai offices. And their laser machine is pretty awesome.

Hi! This is random but how much of the area do they laser prior to surgery?

I asked the technician to do the whole bikini area and he said no problem. 4 -6 sessions, a short and painless 5 minutes each time.

I want to second that the laser machine is really amazing. I was shocked. I didn&#39;t feel any pain at all. It had to pay attention really hard to feel anything but a little cold. They are using a properly trained laser technician now, and I tried to ask for the whole bikini area of her, and she was confused. So hopefully that gets the conversation in her mind and she asked the folks around her if it was ok.

Thanks for your post, I have an FFS consult with him next week and Iâ€™ve been trying to find more info on him. Glad to hear youâ€™ve had a good experience with him and mt Sinai. I just had my orchi there on Wednesday and I was very happy with the treatment.
</p>
<p>
I can definitely commiserate on how much surgery and recovery can be stressful, and Iâ€™m also a frustrated side sleeper. Just try to stay in good spirits and follow after care instructions the bust you can, in time weâ€™ll all get through it.
