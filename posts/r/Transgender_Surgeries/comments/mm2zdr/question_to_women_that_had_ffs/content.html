Hey, I&#39;m lining up a consult with a surgeon for FFS (and GRS) soon, and have something rolling around in my head that google and the wiki haven&#39;t been able to address.
</p>
<p>
What did you do when you returned to work to conceal you had surgery?
</p>
<p>
I pass pretty well as is. My work place doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m trans. I anticipate taking 3 to 4 weeks off for ffs/grs recovery. But other than make up, I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;m going to explain any bruising, scars, or swelling.
</p>
<p>
Thanks ahead of time to those that want to share their experiences. I will of course continue researching and ask this question of my surgeon when I get my consult.

I didn&#39;t even try to conceal it. I just came back and owned it. It was obvious to everyone anyway.

Not to speak for the OP but for me the change was pretty drastic. I had a few coworkers be visibly surprised when they saw me on camera again.

How long after your surgery did you go back?

My face was black and blue and my hairline incision was still fresh and oozing blood on occasion. And the swelling, so much swelling.

It really depends how well you’ve healed up by the time you return to work. Most of my major swelling and bruising went away by the time I returned to work, but of course everyone’s different. It also depends the kind of incisions/scars you have (coronal vs hairline) since some are easier to hide than others.
</p>
<p>
If you already pass it’s likely that make-up plus wearing a facial mask won’t cause much issues. Everyone’s miles varies I would say.

I truly wonder if we&#39;ll all still be wearing masks by then. Chances are my surgery will be q4 2021.

People are definitely gonna be wearing masks till the end of this year at least. It’s possible that it might not be mandatory by the end of the year but there’s definitely gonna be people (me included) who are still going to keep wearing their masks for that extra protection, or we just like wearing and have become accustomed to em.

I am stealth too. I was a little concerned, but I told people I had some facial cosmetic surgery and so far everyone accepted it.

I work nights, so I do have more flexibility than most. Also fewer people. But it&#39;s a gossipy bunch.

I sent a long email to my entire company (~350 people) telling them what ffs was, why trans people need it, how hard it is to get and what exact procedures I was getting.
</p>
<p>
If the issue is ffs and you don&#39;t want to be outed, you could just say you&#39;re getting cosmetic surgery?
</p>
<p>
Ffs is often extremely substantial though so it&#39;s pretty hard to just cover it up.
