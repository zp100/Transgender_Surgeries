I&#39;m expecting silver nitrate sticks in the mail to deal with my granulation tissue. I&#39;m 2 months post op, and I&#39;ve been experiencing a lot of bleeding and discomfort, and I don&#39;t know how much

pain/discomfort I&#39;m going to be in during treatment.
</p>
<p>
Can anyone tell me their experiences? I&#39;d like to make a choice to apply before or after my work week.

Quick, painless and simple.
</p>
<p>
I had some external treatment which was a doddle, and some internal treatment which involved a speculum but again pretty quick and easy.
</p>
<p>
Before my silver nitrate I was very uncomfortable, after was so much better.
</p>
<p>
The dead tissue looks pretty gross right after, just have a good douche/wash to clean up later. X

It&#39;s basically instantaneous. I had severe granulation and was more comfortable with the hour, dilation the next day was a totally different and far better experience. X

Carful not to get it on your urethra and it can (and has) cause it to heal closed, then it’s a trip to emergency. Also not on the clit as that’s bad.

Use sparingly, it cauterises nerves too, so you could loose some sensation where you use it. X

Hi, how do you apply it? It isn&#39;t supposed to be done by a doctor?
