As someone with anxiety and who is 31 days post op, I know what it‚Äôs like to hyper scrutinize all of the healing spots to keep looking over worrying areas.  But the the thing that stuck out to me when I looked at this photo is my first thought was ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs wonderful for her, it‚Äôs already looking so much better than before.‚Äù  So while I know this has to be incredibly stressful darling, as someone outside of this situation who isn‚Äôt seeing it every moment of every day, I am seeing some progress.
</p>
<p>
Doesn‚Äôt make it any less scary but I‚Äôm so proud that you‚Äôre staying on the path to healing.  Catheters suck and dilating can be scary and uncomfortable but you‚Äôre doing amazing!

Yeah... Everytime I see something strange or new I get scared so easily and ask my surgeon if it&#39;s normal. The catheter sucks... But I already learned to live with it... And dilatation is easy... I mean its uncomfortable but it goes in pretty easy. And with music I can handle that bit of pain.

Exactly! This exactly!  Like am I aware that there is to be a bit of discharge and even spotting of blood on the dilator? Yes.  Does it still scare the heck out of because it is discharge and blood? Also yes.  It‚Äôs hard to remove the separation between ‚Äúthis scary body thing is happening‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am healing from a major surgery.‚Äù  At least the more time that passes the less likely there will be for things to worry about üòä

Is the catheter standard to have that far post op for most surgeries or is it only specific to your situation/surgery?

This is not standard unless severe complications. In OP‚Äôs case they suffered necrosis to the clitoris, labia minora and urethra‚Ä¶..if you take a look at their immediately post op photo you see what surgeon was trying to accomplish‚Ä¶.they will one day heal but whatever affect from necrosis willl not grow back and needs revision if they decide to go that route‚Ä¶..

Have they brought in another doctor for a second opinion? I know you will prevail, but this is going to be a long haul recovery and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve told you this is going to take more surgery to repair. I hope you‚Äôre being very closely monitored and are getting adequate support from mental health professionals and possibly a urologist to deal with any issues that may from that long-term catheter use. We are all sending you our best wishes for a fast recovery.

There is no reason to downvote Bunny here.  Believe it or not the doctor here isn&#39;t being negligent.  If you&#39;ve followed Bunny&#39;s full story here, she has been back to the hospital with the tissue examined.  The reason the tissue isn&#39;t just magically removed is because of how SRS surgery works and the final flapped tissue extends (and is fed) by the body.
</p>
<p>
While its terrifying SRS surgery specifically creates flaps of tissue.  If the blood vessels close off or do not work properly the extending tissue will become necrotic and effectively die up to where bloodflow starts.  This is a rather common SRS complication.  And from experience many surgeons have observed that the necrosis in these specific external spots will essentially act as scabs over the recovering wound.  Making it less useful to remove the tissue than traditional necrosis of healthy functioning tissue.
</p>
<p>
Typical Necrosis in other surgeries occurs to normal functioning areas damaged (not extending out from the body) There is no guarantee the blood supply cut off is the reason for the necrosis (and often isn&#39;t) and consequently the necrosis can back track down healthy blood vessels and spread to surrounding tissue. Resulting in infection, spreading necrosis and serious danger to the person.

Thank you for saying it. I really don&#39;t know why the downvotes... I told many times what the doctor told me and what nurses told me. But when there&#39;s a complication on a serious surgery people always says, the fault of the surgeon. I mean u probably didn&#39;t have the surgery so why do you think this is not something that can happen? And my surgeon is following my case and when I contact him he always answers afap.
</p>
<p>
And they downvote me just for asking the reason of why he is being negligent... I mean if u say someone is not doing their job right then say why. Not just say ooooh... That suregon shouldn&#39;t touch any transgender. I literally saw the vagina of a girl who got the surgery one day before me with the same surgeon, no complications and a perfect and beautiful vagina.

I think its literally because of fear that this kind of thing can happen.  And surely someone must be to blame?  But reality is human bodies are VERY complicated.  It is extraordinarily difficult for the same surgeon to repeat the same reconstructive surgery 20 times... and have every nerve, blood vessel and bit of tissue line up and fully survive the surgery perfectly every time.  It doesn&#39;t happen, our bodies are not that standard, and do NOT cooperate that nicely.
</p>
<p>
What makes a good surgeon is communication and ability to respond correctly to normal complications (as scary as they can be) and your surgeon seams to be doing that.  Which I&#39;m glad, your situation is scary.  But you are going to be fine.  It just won&#39;t look perfect after the first go here.  Fortunately vulvas rarely look perfect and are beautiful in their inperfections!

Huge hugs Bunny!

Huggles Bunny hang in there!  Its looking a bit better each day.  Your black spots definitely have become isolated from your healthy tissue, so its just a matter of time before they start to peal away.  Just be really gentle in everything you do!

Because if they do the surgery they might take healthy skin when removing the necrosis. So they prefere to wait and see if the necrosis fall off alone and doesn&#39;t affect the healthy skin under it.
