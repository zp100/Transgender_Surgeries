Hi so quick question before i pass out,, um ive been extremely doomer about my chances of ever getting SRS because i have crohn&#39;s disease. I developed crohns 3 years ago and its been in almost total remission the whole time thanks to Humira. But still ive read about the possible compilations with SRS and how surgeons will just refuse to perform surgery on trans women with IBD. If i cant get this surgery, i think i would
<em>
have
</em>
to kill myself, i don&#39;t want to but it feels so hopeless. I don&#39;t know what to do. Is it possible to just lie about your medical history and deal with any possible complications after you&#39;ve already had the surgery? Cis women can have crohns and develop fistulas, but they dont have to get their fucking vaginas removed so why cant i have a vagina and just deal with the consequences?? And zero-depth isnt something i would consider. That&#39;s worse than just keeping my dick honestly. Am i screwed? ðŸ˜­
</p>
<p>
Plz help, im very scared D:
</p>
<p>
thanks
</p>
<p>
edit: having thought about it, i fucking hate my dick and probably would go for zero/minimal depth srs. Better than nothing i guessðŸ˜•

If you develop a colon to vagina fistula then youâ€™ll end up with a colostomy and depending on how the vagina heals you may lose it anyway. Thatâ€™s basically your trade off. Youâ€™ll have to consult individual surgeons to see if you can find anyone who would do the surgery. And the humira will have to be held for surgery.

I have Celiac, so my surgeon (Dr Mcginn) screened for Chronn&#39;s just to be safe. She said it wouldn&#39;t prevent me from getting the surgery, but she&#39;d need to take precautions if I had it.
</p>
<p>
So at least that&#39;s one surgeon who&#39;s willing to work with you and thinks the risks are manageable.

Surgery was 18 months ago. It was about as good as I could have possibly hoped for! The aesthetics are fantastic-- to the point that even medical professionals can&#39;t tell I wasn&#39;t born with it. I have excellent sensation, self lubrication during arousal, and about 6&#34; of depth.
</p>
<p>
I did have some minor issues. I&#39;m hopefully finally done dealing with granulation tissue, but we&#39;ll see in the coming months if that&#39;s true. That&#39;s so common though it hardly counts as a complication. I also just had a very minor revision to correct two issues. I had a vein in my inner labia that puffed up a little oddly when aroused. I also had a flap of skin that partially covered my vaginal entrance that would chafe or stretch a bit painfully during penetration. Both of those should now be resolved, but I just had that procedure a few days ago so I&#39;m still waiting to see.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m absolutely delighted with how my body is now. Daily living is so much easier! Also, sex is just incredible. It finally makes sense!
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer any other questions you may have ðŸ˜ƒ

I have no experience with this, but I think that PPT may have less of a risk with fistulas.

I can&#39;t imagine it would be worth it to go through this expensive, invasive, and painful surgery just to have something that looks like a vagina but is completely useless sexually. Like, looking at my dick is weird and gross and id rather not have it, but its nothing compared to the pain of not having a (semi)functional vagina. I can live with the discomfort of having a penis, thats not going to kill me.
</p>
<p>
Anal sex is already sometimes inconvenient because of my crohns, and depending on how my disease progresses it might become very difficult or impossible for long periods of time. Maybe i&#39;ll feel different about zero-depth srs in a couple years but oh my god i feel like a worthless freak.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t understand the fistula concern, like is it a bigger concern for me than for cis women? If a cis woman with crohns develops a RV fistula it&#39;ll be fixed with surgery and a temporary colostomy. Why would i have to
<em>
lose
</em>
my vagina???
</p>
<p>
i really havent read into this too much so im sorry if i sound totally clueless. Thank you for responding ðŸ˜¥

Fuck im so sorry girl ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥ at least surgery isnt totally out of the question just yet? I really hope your condition improves. The idea that i may never be able to have a vagina or a normal sex life is so terrifying. i feel like my life is already over before it even had a chance to begin lol. At least we arent alone ðŸ’œ
