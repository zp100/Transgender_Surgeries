I didn&#39;t see a lot of posts here about Dr. Bradley Figler in North Carolina, so in the interest of helping other girls who are looking for info, here&#39;s my experience and a timeline so far.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
I did my research first:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I decided to seek a consult with Dr. Figler specifically for several reasons. Geographically, he is one of the closer surgeons to where I live. Also, my parents live only 10-15 minutes from the hospital where the surgery is performed, making my immediate post-surgical recovery in a supportive environment easy. Dr. Figler&#39;s technique (scrotal/total graft vaginoplasty) seemed better for me than a traditional Penile Inversion. He also has many years behind him as a urology and reconstructive genital surgeon. I couldn&#39;t find any horror stories about him, either. The aesthetics of the few results of his I could find online were good.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Consult and Pre-op:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
When I first started this process, the time between initial contact and my consult with Dr. Figler was around 6 months. The consult itself was pretty relaxed. I met with one of his nurses who asked (and answered) a slew of questions. After this, I met Dr. Figler himself. He answered the few questions I had remaining and described his technique and what surgery and post-surgery would probably be like. I could tell his &#34;bedside manner&#34; would be less emotional or sweet than some other doctors, but he seemed confident and very, very intelligent. A nice enough guy, though.
</p>
<p>
Pre-op was simple. I had to submit updated letters of support, and then I had an office visit 1 month before my surgery where the Dr. checked my hair removal and the length of my anatomy to make sure everything was going to be good for surgery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surgery and Hospital Stay:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The day of surgery I was a bundle of nerves but I had so much support, which made it easier. The check-in process was a breeze, and before I knew it I was laying on a hospital bed and wearing a gown and a stupid bouffant hairnet. Everyone on the surgical team came and greeted me, asked pertinent questions, got consents signed, etc. Dr. Figler came in and spoke to me and reassured me that things would be great. Then I was whisked away, pumped full of feel-good drugs, and knocked out for a 6 hour long surgery.
</p>
<p>
I woke up and the pain was not too bad. Mostly just soreness- not acute, sharp pain. They used a local nerve block during surgery which makes it better for a few days until it wears off. Dr. Figler arrived not long after I was awake and alert and told me that everything went &#34;perfectly&#34;. He anticipated no major complications.
</p>
<p>
The staff at the hospital was awesome. Every single person I talked to seemed to genuinely enjoy their job. And I work in healthcare myself in a clinical capacity, so I
<em>
know
</em>
when people are slacking or unhappy or understaffed. Anytime I needed something a nurse or CNA was there to help within a minute or two at most.
</p>
<p>
Having the catheter kind of sucked. It was just mostly uncomfortable when I&#39;d move around but otherwise I barely knew it was there. I found myself mostly laying on my back, with my head slightly tilted up. Any other position was untenable for long, especially sitting straight up. The sensation of the bolster dressing was like having a large metal Stanley water bottle lodged inside me, demanding that I do not bend at the waist. It was...uncomfortable. Even farting hurt. However, I will say that my pain was pretty well controlled with meds.
</p>
<p>
The food was actually pretty damn good. UNC Hillsborough has a menu and you call and place your order. Within 1 hour, your food arrives. The only bad thing was the coffee - ugh! If you can, have someone bring you a latte or whatever from outside.
</p>
<p>
The nurses had me up and walking by day 2. Just short walks at first. They never tried to push me too hard. My recovery in-hospital was good enough that I could have been discharged if I wanted on Day 3, but I elected to stay another day to be safe.
</p>
<p>
On the last day I finally pooped...about 5 minutes before I was to be wheeled out and discharged. That, plus the ride in the car home and the nerve block wearing off made Day 4 the worst day for me. I was in so much pain. I couldn&#39;t get comfortable at home at all even after popping a couple of oxy and some tylenol. After bearing through it for a few hours though, thankfully the pain abated and was able to relax.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Days 4, 5, and 6 totally SUCKED. I was so uncomfortable. I maxed out on my pain meds and honestly...IMO they didn&#39;t send me home with enough. Five little pills of oxycodone is a joke after a major surgery like this. Someone should really look into bumping that up by at least double or maybe even triple!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Day 7 couldn&#39;t come soon enough - that was when they removed the outside gauze, the urinary catheter, a bunch of stitches, and the bolster dressing. The relief was almost immediate afterwards. Dr. Figler stopped in to check on everything. Again, his comment was &#34;every thing looks perfect&#34;. After that, I was instructed to go home and try to pee. If I wasn&#39;t able to pee within 4-6 hours I&#39;d have to go back and have the catheter put back in. Luckily, I peed on my first try as soon as I got home. Peeing was a very different experience than before, lol. I&#39;d squeeze like normal and then the pee just sort of...dumped out of me and sprayed all over the gd place. I&#39;d get that faint tingling sensation around what used to be the &#34;tip&#34; of my penis too even though nothing was coming out there. That sensation passed pretty quickly, btw.
</p>
<p>
Expect to spend the next few weeks mostly laying around. I was able to get around by myself fine, but having support people around to take care of basic stuff for me and provide some social contact was pretty nice.
</p>
<p>
Around Day 21 was my first dilation training. It was weird, but the staff was great as always. Basically, I laid down, put my feet in stirrups, and Dr. Figler&#39;s PA slowly guided the small orange dilator inside me. She got it up to the very last dot without much resistance, and then it was my turn to do it myself while she helped. It was pretty easy. I was told to try to always return to that same depth every time I dilate from now on. My dilation schedule is 2x per day, 30 minutes each time. Some days I do 3 dilations just to make the one at night easier. I&#39;m supposed to douche with distilled water once a day but I only do it maybe every 3 days.
</p>
<p>
After that, it&#39;s all incremental improvement. Each day things have gotten a little better. Each day I&#39;m a little less sore and I can do a little more activity without discomfort.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Where I&#39;m at now and final thoughts:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
8 weeks post op currently. I&#39;m currently dilating with the blue dilator and I can get the green one all the way in to the last dot, so I&#39;ll be moving up as soon. I may purchase the big orange one and see about that eventually.
</p>
<p>
I have no issues at all with urination or incontinence. I keep myself very clean and always shower and urinate after every dilation session and drink lots of water, so no UTIs so far.
</p>
<p>
I no longer need pads. I do use pantyliners and imagine I will probably continue to do so as long as I&#39;m having to dilate so often. I do still occasionally bleed, though never more than a drop or two after dilating.
</p>
<p>
There is no bad smell. At most there is a faint smell that I&#39;d consider &#34;normal vagina&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I do have some natural lubrication. This is due to the surgical technique which uses the tunica vaginalus to form part of the inner lining of the vagina. This is peritoneal tissue, and as such, secretes a thin, watery mucous which is pretty much the same in my experience to what natal females produce. There isn&#39;t enough natural lubrication to facilitate intercourse by itself.
</p>
<p>
The surgical area is a mixture of numbness, sensation (both regular and pleasurable), and hypersensitivity (mostly right on the scars, around the mons area, and on the very tip of the clit). I still have plenty of swelling but it is much better than it was. When I stand up after sitting for too long or if I&#39;m having a really active day I get a surge of swelling as blood seems to rush to the area surrounding my clitoris. It feels vaguely similar to having an erection but having that erection trapped in a pair of very tight pants. This feeling passes after a minute or two. It is sort of uncomfortable but not painful really. I initially took off 2 months from work but added an additional 4 weeks to maximize healing. My job is very physically demanding.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of sensation, I had my first clitoral orgasm around 8 weeks post op. Today, actually. :) It took longer to reach and I had to work harder to get it, but it was so worth it. I&#39;d say it was much different than before. HRT never changed my orgasms all that much.
</p>
<p>
Prostate sensation is very good. Better than before.
</p>
<p>
The aesthetics are fine. It&#39;s not a porn star pussy but it&#39;s mine, it is within the realm of &#34;passability&#34; or will be once the scars and swelling fade a bit more, and most of all I like it and my gf REALLY likes it.
</p>
<p>
The dysphoria I experienced before is completely gone. I no longer have to think about or worry about having the wrong parts ever again. Wearing yoga pants and swimsuits with no bulge is fucking awesome. That thing will never again be in the way or uncomfortably tucked.
</p>
<p>
So do I miss what I had before? This was something I worried about like crazy building up to my surgery. The fear of regret was REAL for me. I didn&#39;t have crippling dysphoria over my parts like other people do. However, I&#39;m happy to say that this was absolutely the right call for me and I do not miss my old parts. Sure, life was simpler before in some ways (no dilating, no discomfort, orgasms were easy to get) but as time goes on and I recover, those things become less and less of an issue. Eventually I&#39;ll just have what I&#39;m supposed to have and I won&#39;t have to dilate much to maintain it. In all, I&#39;m very happy with my outcome and can&#39;t wait for further improvement and healing.

thank you so much for sharing your experience! i&#39;ve been wondering if he&#39;d be worth pursuing for my zero depth and you made him seem like the ideal candidate 🤔

much luck and love on your continued recovery!

I have an orchie with Figler coming up this month and am on the waitlist for the full bottom surgery so thank you for your write up.  The process sounds about what I’m expecting and luckily no complications or unwanted results happened with you and his surgical technique.  I was told 3 months ahead of surgery to have hair removal but the process is going far slower than I would like.  What laser interval were you on and did you have to resort to electrolysis to meet that deadline?  I’m at 6 sessions so far and I can’t tell a difference yet.

I had 7 or 8 sessions of laser at a local dermatology spa place. After that was around 15 hours of electrolysis. I was considered clear after that. I never had much hair down there though so YMMV.

Thank you SO MUCH for writing this! It answers every question I could&#39;ve thought of asking and covers the entire experience wonderfully.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so glad you had great results! Both for you and for me, since I&#39;m having bottom surgery with him in 2 months and was pretty nervous until I read your review, which put me at ease a little bit. I&#39;m interested to see the results, as the aesthetics are something I&#39;ve had concerns about with him, but I know he&#39;s an excellent urologist so that helps with functionality and sensation.
</p>
<p>
Does he accept reference pics as a suggestion for what you&#39;re going for? Or would that not help? I&#39;m hoping he does a good job on my labia and it&#39;s somewhat close to expectations.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck with further recovery and enjoy, girl! 😁

I don&#39;t know if he will do anything with reference pics or not. I can say that the other 3 vaginas I&#39;ve seen that he&#39;s done all look very similar to mine. But I&#39;m also still healing and it will continue to change over the next 6 or so months. I want to say dr figler will prioritize function and chances for a positive outcome over aesthetics. He likely has a way of doing things that works well and there might not be much room for making changes now- maybe a revision later if aesthetics are extremely important to you. How he did it was fine by me- I just wanted what I had gone and I didn&#39;t want any future problems urinating or having orgasms. I&#39;d say he did pretty well there.

Thank you all for posting this, I just contacted his office today and I am getting a referral to them for bottom surgery. They take my insurance so that&#39;s a huge plus and I can&#39;t wait to talk to him!

I had surgery with Dr Figler back on 10/8. I&#39;d say generally similar experiences? He made me feel so comfortable and his staff was just lovely. My pain management was weird. I also wasn&#39;t able to poop until the dressing came out, so I was dealing with a lot of gas pain and constipation by that point. So much relief when the dressing came out, though.

Thank you so much for this much detail about your recovery! I have my initial consult with him in 4 months, and this is is exactly the info I was looking for.
