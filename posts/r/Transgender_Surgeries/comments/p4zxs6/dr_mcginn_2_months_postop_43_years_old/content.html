Today I&#39;m 2 months out from having PI vaginoplasty with
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_christine_mcginn">Dr. McGinn</a>
.  Had minor granulation that was burned off at 7 weeks, but no other significant issues.  The interior photo can be a bit rough to see, but I have a pretty well-formed clit and hood, and majora, not so much the minora as far as I can tell.  Started using
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YJ7R19N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">scar tape</a>
at 7 weeks, and have already had a decent amount of scar reduction.  Back on E patches, and a T topical cream (very low dose).  Will restart P in a few months.
</p>
<p>
Currently dilating 3 times a day, 35 minutes each, have no issues getting to full depth on the largest size.  Dilation has long since been routine and only slightly uncomfortable.  Have had little pain, during dilation or otherwise, since I was discharged from the hospital at 3 days post-op.  Was cleared at 7 weeks for most activities, except for some forms of swimming.  Have been doing some indoor rock climbing with no issues, want to re-start running, but having unrelated knee issues.
</p>
<p>
I posted my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/jlio53/dr_mcginn_consult_writeup_and_why_im_planning_on/">consult</a>
last year, and my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/nhwt44/how_to_get_your_us_insurance_to_cover_gcs_in/">insurance fun</a>
a few months ago.  Restarted work this past week, working from home (office job), with no issues.
</p>
<p>
Edit on December 1st:
</p>
<p>
I just had a follow-up appointment at 5.5 months.  Some internal scar tissue, I got hydrocortisone cream to use for the next few weeks while dilating.  A couple spots of internal granulation that they treated with silver nitrate.
</p>
<p>
Other than that things look good.  Decent minora definition, plump majora, clit looks good, and my urethra is &#34;perfect&#34; per McGinn&#39;s PA (I don&#39;t know what that means).  6.1 inches of depth, I&#39;ve been using the orange dilator for 4 months now.  The scars on the sides of the exterior are fading and no longer red and irritated, so I can stop using silicone scar tape.

Never too late!  If you have your letters and hair removal in order, you can get a slot within a couple of months.  I&#39;ve seen it happen recently.

Thanks for sharing! It looks like it&#39;ll heal nicely, and have that &#34;natural pink vulva&#34; look (idk if that makes sense) like a lot of her results. Do you happen to know if she&#39;s doing or still doing free revisions/labiaplasties? I think it&#39;s too early to judge your own labial definition (sometimes more folds develop as the swelling goes down), but would you consider doing a second stage with McGinn if you had any cosmetic complaints? And do you happen to know what McGinn offers in terms of revisions/labiaplasties (if that was discussed in a consultation or otherwise)?

Revisions aren&#39;t free, but they&#39;re not hardly as expensive as the original surgery.  I know someone who had one with McGinn, I&#39;ll ask her, but I believe it was outpatient and cost a few thousand.  Revisions were not discussed much at previous meetings, but it would seem to be more often a topic for the 6-month follow-up I have scheduled in late November, since as you note it&#39;s still too early to judge the final aesthetic results.  I&#39;m rather unlikely to have a revision, personally, though.

Revisions/labiaplasty are free.  Only time you‚Äôll have to pay is if you have to go under. So you have to pay anesthesia and fees.  But she does labiaplasty for free. I‚Äôve had the talk with McGinn numerous times. I may get labiaplasty to do a fat transfer just to make it more puffy. And that costs about 4-5k. But other revisions don‚Äôt usually require going under.

It is a very good result, you could do an update to see how your recovery progressed

I just added an update to my original comment.
</p>
<p>
There didn&#39;t seem to be a lot of interest in my 3-month follow-up so I wasn&#39;t going to post at 6 months.  Maybe at a year.  Was there something in particular you were interested in?
