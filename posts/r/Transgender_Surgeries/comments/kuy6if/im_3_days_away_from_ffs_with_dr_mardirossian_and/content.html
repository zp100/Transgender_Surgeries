I&#39;m 3 days away from FFS with Dr. Mardirossian, and put together a quick vlog about it. Any thoughts or advice?

It was really down to feeling on which surgeon felt right to me.  I did a number of consults and I felt he understood what I wanted the best, and I vibed with his personality.  He seemed really honest and straightforward.  Also, he was about half the cost of most west coast surgeons which definitely helped. ðŸ˜Ž
</p>
<p>
I also really really liked his before/afters (both on his site/Instagram and what others have posted) for what I&#39;m getting done.  His foreheads look flawless to me, and I really like his noses, although some are a little too skislope for me (but that&#39;s fine and he understands that).  His scars also really look excellent and he seems to take pride in minimal scarring.
</p>
<p>
His FFS patients all seem to give glowing reviews, except one reddit poster but they were pretty vague about why they were unhappy.

Hi! Iâ€™m considering Dr. Mardirossian and Iâ€™m wondering how your surgery went? Hope everything has been going well!
