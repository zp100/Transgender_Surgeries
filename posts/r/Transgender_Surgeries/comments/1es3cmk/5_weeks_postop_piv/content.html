I am at 9 weeks postop, and have also had some granulation at the entrance.   My surgeon was quite attentive and did a couple of treatments with silver nitrate…that helps a lot.   If you do have granulation throughout the entire vaginal canal, you should definitely reach out.     I couldn’t even imagine dilating with complete granulation of the canal.   It looks like you have some dehiscence happening on the right side labia majora.   Also, make sure you are using enough lube while dilating.

Dilation is a little uncomfortable sometimes but not bad, so I’m not exactly sure how bad it might be inside or how to tell. The dehiscence was quite scary at one point, but now just waiting for it to close up. Using lots of lube!

No pain thankfully! He did tell me to get some silver nitrate, but I have to figure out how to go about it.

You shouldn’t be apply that yourself, at least not without being being told how to do it.

I&#39;ve seen so many post surgery images where the labia Majora gets &#34;detached&#34; from the skin. Also here I can see the wound opening. I&#39;ve never seen this on results from surgeons in my area. They all just do PI.
</p>
<p>
Why does this happen?
