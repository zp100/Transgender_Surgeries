FFS with Dr Garland at UW Hospital in Madison on Monday, Oct 31, 2022 (Halloween! üéÉ). All covered by my partners quartz insurance.
</p>
<p>
Photos:

</a>
</p>
<p>
Specific procedures:  Frontal cranioplasty (type 3) Hairline lowering Fat grafting to temples, cheeks Tracheal shave
</p>
<p>
All fully covered by insurance. Dr Garlands team was surprised that fat grafting was covered.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m feeling good and pain is controlled with only Tylenol. I&#39;m religious about taking my dose every 3 hours or I get a little grumpy.
</p>
<p>
My tummy is a little sore where the incision to take a bit of fat was as well as in the center where the fat was taken from. The team told me my body will resorb about half the fat they inject.
</p>
<p>
I have a significant amount of numbness on my forehead above my eyebrows which is expected, and should resolve in the next few weeks (or maybe a few months) and in the center of my head between the staple lines that will hopefully resolve in the next year.
</p>
<p>
The swelling is still going down but I&#39;m very pleased with the results already. Dr Garlands team was kind and easy to work with, and quick to respond to follow ups.
</p>
<p>
My only reservation is on Quartz, they were supposed to give me a financial estimate a few weeks before surgery day (which is already way way late) and didn&#39;t. I still don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll be billed after insurance.
</p>
<p>
Ask me anything!

Yes, that&#39;s correct. I&#39;m happy for these pics to be hosted or shared publicly, and can provide updates as insurance and any complications are sorted over time.

How long did it take for you to get a surgery date? I had a type 1 forehead reconstruction with dr chaiet but I‚Äôm hoping to have chin / jaw work with her next year.

Good question! A little over a year from initial reaching out to surgery date. Much of this is waiting for insurance, and then slotting into a 6-9 month wait for Dr. Garland&#39;s surgical calendar.
</p>
<p>
Timeline:
</p>
<p>
I reached out to the UW plastic surgery team around September 2022.
</p>
<p>
UW Health and Quartz doesn&#39;t require a Letter of Readiness from a therapist for FFS (they require 2 for bottom surgery), but I was told I&#39;d get more leniency from insurance approvals with one, so I worked with a therapist to get the letter ready. That was submitted late October 2021.
</p>
<p>
I met with Dr. Garland November 2021. She took some high quality photos (not shared with me unfortunately) and made a list of procedures she&#39;d ask insurance for approval for. Dr. Garland finalized the list of procedures and submitted them to insurance in Q1 2022. Insurance approved most of them (eyebrow lift was not approved, but hairline advancement naturally pulls eyebrows up) late April 2022.
</p>
<p>
The team took about a month after insurance approval to reach out about a date. October 31 (halloween in the USA) was offered. I didn&#39;t love that date, but the next date was early December 2022, and I didn&#39;t want to delay that long, so I accepted it.
</p>
<p>
In the months leading up to FFS I did a high-quality facial CT to decide if type 1 or type 3 forehead reduction was required. In the week leading up to the surgery I met with Dr. Garland and her chief RN, Clare. They were both thoughtful and informative to talk to. I also did a covid test in the few days before surgery. Thank goodness, negative.

How do you feel with your tracheal shave pain wise on top of the rest of your surgery?

Internal pain in my throat, only a little. It feels like a scratchy cold or something. I&#39;m told that&#39;s because they put the scope into your throat a few times to make sure they&#39;re not close to injuring your voice box (the part of the bone they shave sits on your voice box).
</p>
<p>
External pain, not a lot. 8 days on, I&#39;m still taking Tylenol every 3-4 hours so it might hurt more but I don&#39;t notice. It is a bit swollen - my partner said it&#39;s the same size as before, but instead of bone it&#39;s swelling and it&#39;ll go down soon, I hope in the next few weeks.
</p>
<p>
I was worried I couldn&#39;t speak for a while, but I was assured I could speak right after, and that&#39;s what happened. No hoarseness or volume changes or anything.
</p>
<p>
I also got some fat grafting for my temples, and they took the fat from my belly, and that hurts an odd amount given there&#39;s no bruising and only two little entry cuts to get some sort of sucker in there to harvest the fat. I have to wear a silly binder too to help shape the healing tummy fat haha

Hi, I just now came across your post. Your results look fantastic. Congratulations can you please tell me how you decided on something as major as a facial surgeon? I have really good insurance with the new job that covers almost every related FFS surgery as long as they‚Äôre in network with CIGNA, but it‚Äôs really hard for me to Decide because every face is different of course. I‚Äôm not really sure how to narrow things down and I don‚Äôt want to be wasting time as I still need to do a consultation and hopefully surgery sometime this year if possible with somebody. At the same time, I don‚Äôt want to make a rash decision about something so important.

Hey! These are great questions. I&#39;m among the least educated on this topic. My insurance covered FFS and I live in a town with a renowned FFS surgeon, and I&#39;m even like a 5 minute drive from the hospital. I asked for photos examples and was told they don&#39;t provide them. So I kinda just had to go on faith.
</p>
<p>
I do have a friend that shopped around for different surgeons and paid out of pocket, and she&#39;s happy with her results, but it was $20k out of pocket, and I think the results are nearly the same.
</p>
<p>
I think talking to your doctor about what you want and what you should expect from the surgeon is a great idea, and all you can reasonable due since as you noted, all faces are different.
</p>
<p>
Oh also, I have posted more recent pictures since this post, check my profile.

Thank you for the response in such a prompt one at that lol. Does your Dr by chance have before and after photos in the gallery or something to get a general idea? One thing that seemed odd to me in what I read on the website is, I didn‚Äôt even see FFS mentioned and yet your results look so good! I‚Äôve googled Doctors for California, where I live, and of course there‚Äôs no shortage, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that the best one for me is necessarily here. In fact, I‚Äôm considering one in Massachusetts. I‚Äôve heard good things about, but I don‚Äôt know if his approach is too conservative for how bad my dysphoria has been and has gotten worse since I started transitioning over seven months ago my first choice would‚Äôve been dechamps braly that reportedly he‚Äôs not working with any insurance whatsoever so that‚Äôs out of the question for me

Hey! Apparently they used to publish them but some politicians started attacking the folks used as examples. I volunteered they could share my pictures anyway, but they said it&#39;s too risky so they don&#39;t any more. You can apparently request the photos shared privately from them and I might be in there, I consented to that also.
</p>
<p>
I think Dr. Gast no longer does FFS? The UW Madison team seems to rotate different surgeries around them, I&#39;m not clear why.

Ok! Tysm for your reply. I just want to keep moving forward with how awful last year was with a narcissistic ex and I have this opportunity in front of me which is probably my first and last opportunity to get FFS so I think I just need to bite the bullet and pick one or two people to do consultations with. Again, congratulations you look great and I can only imagine how wonderful you feel.
