Hello, I had my SRS in France 3 years ago but it was completely failed.. I had 2 revisions but it&#39;s not enough. I want to do a revision with Dr. Theerapong for overall aesthetics and to remove excess erectile tissue from the urethra and clitoris. My question is is there a good surgeon to repair excess erectile tissue? Has anyone had a revision with him? What is the procedure to follow? And things to know? Should I plan certain things in advance?
</p>
<p>
I would love to speak with people who have had their SRS or SRS revision with him…

Would you mind saying who your surgeon was for the original surgery and revisions?

Yes it&#39;s Dr Soulier Victor for the original surgery and Dr Plainard Xavier for revisions.
</p>
<p>
I strongly advise against the dr Soulier who completely failed my surgery (I am not the only one, many girls were failed by him..) but dr Plainard is very good he did what he could to improve the result
