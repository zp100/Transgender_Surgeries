Yay, finally without catheter ðŸ¥° Thanks for the update. It&#39;s looking better and better every day! I can&#39;t wait to see what it looks like in a couple months from now. I bet it&#39;s gonna be an amazing result. The stitches look great. He&#39;s truly skilled and did an awesome job at those for sure. Swelling also looks pretty darn good for just 10 days.
</p>
<p>
One question tho: is that swollen part on the inner left side your labia minora or your clitoris? ðŸ¤” It was already visible on the 3 day pic and there I thought it might actually be the clitoris being out in the open, but now I am not sure anymore. Does Taskov add clitoral hood on the first surgery?

I&#39;ve asked him some days ago and he said it&#39;s the labia minora. He said my clitoris is covered but I can&#39;t tell for sure. Time will tell.

Well, from the very few results I&#39;ve seen the minora seems to be rather big and easily visible on Taskov&#39;, like a curtain if you so wish. Which is exactly what I personally love about his work and why he&#39;s my favourite. So yeah, I am sure he&#39;s right and it&#39;s the minora. Once swelling goes  down it&#39;ll look beautiful for sure ðŸ¥° (not that it doesn&#39;t already, because it surely does, esp. for day 10!)

i would probably go to the hospital, it looks like part of the clit might be necrosed? (it might just be clotted blood though, can&#39;t tell with the lighting)

Clotted blood most likely. I am actually in the hospital since surgery. I have to stay for three weeks in total. Even if it&#39;s a bit of necrosis which I doubt, it isn&#39;t too much. The picture was taken with the camera flash to make more details visible.

Pretty sure that&#39;s just a blot clot. It doesn&#39;t look like necrosis to me and I am sure the doc would&#39;ve noticed if it was. Stop scaring her.

The outer labia remind me of myself. Best wishes for upcoming recovery looks promising!

Seems u had a massive drop in swelling over day 6 to day 10. Gives me some peace of mind. Iâ€™m on day 8 and everything is still HUGE.
