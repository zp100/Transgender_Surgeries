Hello!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I currently have a video appointment scheduled for a FFS consultation with Pomerantz coming up very soon, and I&#39;m scrambling to do a bit of research in regards to what he may offer. Unfortunately, all I&#39;ve been able to dig up so far is practically nothing. Some positive reviews, but all of them in relation to his pediatric work, or the like.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The lack of information is leaving me nervous. Unless the consultation really reassures me, I will probably seek a different surgeon covered by my insurance (currently, my only means of paying.) That said, I had a very positive experience getting my orchi with Dr. Butler at UCSF, and it could take quite a while to arrange things with another surgeon.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
So, I figured I&#39;d ask if anyone in the community has any experience with him at all?  Or, even heard anything about him in relation to him performing FFS?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Thank you all!
</p>

I would also be interested in this info, and I also had a good experience with Dr. Butler.

Hey there! I’m curious. Have you gotten anything done by Dr Pomerantz yet? I had a terrible experience with him. I could go into detail about it if you’d like to hear my experience.

I had FFS with him three years ago, back in 2019. He was terrible about explaining procedures or methods or anything like that. I went in for the consultation and he explained nothing. He literally told me -“What do you want done, and said I needed nothing done” his exact words. The consult was express, literally less than five minutes. He took a little more time asking for the procedures I wanted done the very morning of the surgery as I was already hooked up to the IV and everything, and even then it was only a five minute thing. The student surgeons actually took more time asking questions, and seemed to care a bit more. There was a team of about three surgeons, the anesthesiologist was awesome, about five nurses etc.. the procedure was done at UCSF. What blows my mind is that he had me in the OR for 14hrs!! I literally came out dead, and almost needed a blood transfusion, which I refused. I lost sight and couldn’t see for two days. All this ordeal to leave me extremely fucked up!! My hairline is all fucked and crooked, literally straight with no natural shape, he created recessions on the sides where I didn’t have them before, a lot of ppl often ask if I’m wearing a wig since I have very long hair, which is always extremely upsetting! My nose is fucked and crooked as well, with no real shape he basically just thinned out the sides, my nostrils are uneven, one is bigger than the other. My lip lift looks like he didn’t even lift anything, he just created a terrible scar under my nose. My left orbital feels like it has a hole, it feels hollow and uneven, where the right one doesn’t feel like that. The only decent procedures he did was lipo on my chin and my tracheal shave. I never found out the procedures he actually did especially on my forehead, etc. the follow up appointments were with nurses who had no idea of the work he did on me and couldn’t give me answers. I still don’t know if he took my sinuses out, if I have a metal plate, screws or anything on my forehead. Never saw him again, then COVID hit! I was seeking a revision last year and he didn’t want to approve it or refer me to a different surgeon, his office was pressuring me into coming in for an appointment with him otherwise they wouldn’t approve a referral or a revision. I have moved to SoCal since, and I’m currently seeking a revision down here. He is very conservative with his work, and people always say i look very natural and that it doesn’t look like I had work done, so I’ll give him that idk if it’s a good thing or a bad thing. I would advice you to proceed with caution and ask questions and write everything down so there’s no lack of communication. If you are seeking FFS through UCSF I would recommend Dr Rahul Seth, but he is in high demand. Good Luck, Girlies! &lt;3
</p>
<p>
Also, he performs general surgery at SF General Hospital.. where he’ll do any type of surgery. First time I went in for a consultation i could hear he was talking to a patient about foot/leg surgery in the room next to mine, so I really don’t understand how one relates to the other especially on the face (facial/reconstructive surgery).

Thank you so much for your comprehensive reply!  Goodness it sounds like you&#39;ve been through it. I&#39;m so sorry you had such a poor experience, and I hope beyond hope you&#39;ll have a chance for a good revision that will treat you better.
</p>

Where do you get your good impression of Dr. Seth from, if you don&#39;t mind my asking? I&#39;m definitely interested in learning more about him, as well. UCSF is my best bet at FFS in any timely fashion, so if there&#39;s another doctor there that I can work with, that would be great.

I have not, although I recently got my CT scan down to him and was planning on traveling down there soon for a face to face--transportation issues and school have slowed down my attempts at moving forward. I was planning to see how the face to face went and if it seemed alright at that point, to go forward with it.

I would *very much* appreciate any information you could share in relation to him, since I&#39;ve still not been able to find anything about him in regards to FFS.

This youtube channel has some recovery vids for the first surgery of a two-part FFS plan with Pomerantz:

Thank you for this!  Unfortunately she does not appear to have updated in quite some time, but that&#39;s still more in terms of visual results than I was able to find about Pomerantz&#39;s work previously.

Sorry! I only just realised you had replied to me here.  I found him quite brusque in the video consultation, though he did answer the questions I had. I was planning to ask more detailed questions in the upcoming face to face consultation and determine if I was going to continue forward with him from there.
