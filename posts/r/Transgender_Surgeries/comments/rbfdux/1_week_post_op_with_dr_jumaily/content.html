The first day was the worst day of my life but 1 week later and things are surprisingly manageable and I‚Äôm feeling like I can start getting back to some back day to day tasks.
</p>
<p>
The swelling is still crazy but I absolutely love the changes I am seeing.
</p>
<p>
I got type 3 forehead, hair advancement and brow lift, rhinoplasty, lip lift, sliding genioplasty, jaw contouring, and a deep plane face/neck lift.

Thank you for sharing! I have my ffs at the end of May and posts like this really help to figure out what to actually expect. I do love all the changes and in my consult it was I think all the same procedures haha. They even said it was like the mtf formula.

That‚Äôs a lot of work. How long was your operation? The reason I asked is because my consultations have told me that adding a face lift to the FFS would make the procedure too long. Like 10+ hours.

I was under for a long time, I think it was over 12 hours.  I do not remember much of the coming home process AT ALL, but we came in to the office at 6am, I think I was out by 7am, and then they called my wife around 7pm, she heard them waking me up around 8pm, and then I wasn‚Äôt able to physically leave because of how long it took me to come to it enough until like 10pm.  It was a long day.

That makes total sense. I am asking for a very similar group of procedures and two docs told me that would take 8 hours minimum. When inquiring about adding a face lift they said it would push them beyond their comfort level on time. Ehh‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
You look great btw! I‚Äôm sure the ffs will only make it better!!

I was booked with Dr Rolfes before Dr Jumaily and it seemed like he had a limit as well, but I think it was more at the surgery center they used, I forget‚Ä¶that was a long time ago.
</p>
<p>
I definitely was excited about the facelift.  I‚Äôve had loose skin since I lost a bunch of weight and I knew if I had FFS that it would only be worse‚Ä¶so it was kind of a requirement for me in my head.  I actually have neck definition‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had that.  Kind of amazing.

It‚Äôs really hard to say because there is still so much swelling but so far it‚Äôs looking good and is a big improvement over what I had already.

did you have to pay anything after you paid the full quote prior to your appointment the day before surgery?

Even if you are wearing glasses in the first pic, I can see he opened your eyes so much!! Light enters your eyes. I would just add fillers or fat graft to your lips. Although you are still very swollen, you 100% pass as cis woman. Congrats
