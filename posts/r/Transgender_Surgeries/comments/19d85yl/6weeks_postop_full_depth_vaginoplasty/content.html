I just had my 6-week post visit today. They measured my vaginal depth at 8cm. During surgery they were able to give me 14cm which we never saw. The first time I dilated the physical therapist struggled to get the dilator to the first dot. I‚Äôve been vigorously dilating more than 20 minutes 3-times a day. I‚Äôm at 8cm. I would say I am fucked but that‚Äôs not possible with 8cm. This has been a really difficult experience and it‚Äôs just crushing to be at 8cm. It sucks to be the random surgery that doesn‚Äôt work out. I basically got a really deep zero-depth surgery.
</p>
<p>
What do I do with 8cm? What are your thoughts? I‚Äôm still so numb. My surgery feels like a failure. But keep on healing and wait and see what happens. It‚Äôs only possible to lose depth from this point. Rough day.

‚ÄúMore than 20 minutes?‚Äù My sessions were more than 30-45 and I had colon vaginoplasty. It‚Äôs possible you‚Äôre just not giving yourself enough time to relax. It can really, really be time consuming at first.

I was measured by the PT , NP, and Surgeon the first time I dilated to be at the first dot. 20 minutes is after full depth is achieved.

Thanks for clearing that up. I can‚Äôt imagine why you never saw the full depth they gave you during surgery. I hope things work out, definitely check with your surgeon and another pelvic floor therapist maybe. There are definitely revision options out there.

It‚Äôs been measured many times by many people and I can feel where it‚Äôs at dilating. It‚Äôs 8cm. It‚Äôs crushing to think of another surgery because this one has been so difficult. It‚Äôs destroyed my mental health. 8cm is a failure right?

your feelings and concerns about your depth and being able to accommodate an average size penis is valid  but your surgery wasn‚Äôt a failure! it‚Äôs another step towards alignment of your body and brain. this is you embarking a new journey reclaiming your body and identity. you will experience euphoria everytime you put on a pair of panties or yoga pants or when you wear bikini in the summer. there are many ways you can enjoy sex and orgasm that is not straight up intercourse.

For sure. We will eliminate penetration now. Feeling in the area and nerve connecting still isn‚Äôt a guarantee either. There is still the possibility of being numb and losing sensation permanently in the area. I had a horrible relationship with sex before and thought maybe I could be someone that has a happy-fulfilling normal sex life. It‚Äôs depressing to spend multiple hours a day dilating to keep my 8cm.

I&#39;m sorry to hear that üòî ü´Ç It&#39;s something that can be fixed with a revision so don&#39;t lose hope. In the meantime your responsibility is to make sure everything else heals.

Dilate, dilate, dilate after inversion surgery.  At least 60 minutes a day is essential in the weeks after surgery.  Crushingly boring, I watched TV soaps and quiz shows.

I‚Äôve dilated for at least 60 minutes at full-depth every day since I started dilating. It sucks but I‚Äôve stuck to it. All that dilation time is time for me to stare at and think about the depth that I don‚Äôt have.

Girl, the average depth of a vagina is 5-13 cm, I haven&#39;t started HRT yet or came out as trans so I know jack shit, but I&#39;m pretty sure 8cm is actually pretty good and totally serviceable for sex. With the average pp being around 14cm, I think you&#39;re more than well off.

A cis-vagina elongates during arousal. A neovagina does not. I can‚Äôt accommodate my long finger. I can‚Äôt accommodate half of the average penis. 50% of penis‚Äô are longer than the average penis.

girl‚Ä¶ women who born without vaginas and get the Mcindoe technique (where they use skin from the tights to make the vagina) mostly get between 8 and 10 cm and not more‚Ä¶ u can have a normal sex life with that, if i was you i would relax more and focus on the width more than the depth for sex

Width is fine. Haven‚Äôt had a problem with width. I‚Äôm disappointed that I am starting out with the ability to accommodate a maximum of 3‚Äù.  I can only lose depth over time, I won‚Äôt gain depth over the years.

If you are doing your dilation as you should why would you lose more depth? always make sure u are pressuring the end of the canal though
