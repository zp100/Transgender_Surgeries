Just wanted to share my 3rd month postop update!
</p>
<p>
Not as much to add this time, things have been going about as expected. Dilation has definitely been getting tougher towards the end of the 3rd month - the clinic warns that this is the hardest time when it comes to dilation. Everything is a lot more tender and sore down there as nerves reconnect, and on top of that the scars which were previously more fresh and pliable are now starting to become tough which makes it more difficult. It&#39;s not terrible but also apparently I have somewhat high pain tolerance. The constant post-OP ache that I had has died down and I&#39;m not on any painkillers anymore. There&#39;s a lot more zapping nerve pains and also itching now though which is kind of annoying.
</p>
<p>
3 months is where the clinic advises that you can have gentle sex, but it&#39;s way too sore for me to want to try anything. Fingers do feel nice inside, I&#39;d describe it as a vague sense of fullness. My clit area is still a bit hypersensitive/sore with a lot of nerves tingling as things continue to heal.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve still got some ongoing light bleeding, and a little granulation but it&#39;s getting better. A decent amount of ongoing discharge, which is continuing to improve. Discharge immediately post OP was very heavy, maybe going through 5 pads a day, now I&#39;m down to changing panty liners maybe 5 times a day (mostly because I find it uncomfortable rather than it actually getting soaked), and using one maxi pad every night (I actually find pads designed for incontinence work better, they&#39;re cheaper and stay dryer).
</p>
<p>
Otherwise no complications, depth about the same (I&#39;ve &#34;lost&#39; 1cm, but I think that&#39;s just from the swelling going down). Aesthetics are great, things continue to look better as the swelling goes down.
</p>
<p>
Will probably post a 6 month update if I don&#39;t forget.

Congratulations on your surgery!
</p>
<p>
If you are up for sharing, I am curious, how many times did you apply to the Suporn lottery before receiving a surgery date. I have tried three times with no luck and am just trying to get an idea of how long it has taken for others. Thanks much.

I had a date from pre-COVID which was cancelled so can&#39;t answer that.
