Yeah I thought so. The hospital fee is 3-4k. It adds so much but yeah.

Yes. It&#39;s very close to the roots of my teeth. I need to go for some vitality testing and examination of dental pulps. I want them removed regardless but most likely next year. The surgeon did not want to put implants to my chin and jaw as he feels the results may not be pleasing and because of my exposed nerve on the right jaw the implant will impinge on the exposed nerve and canal or what is left of it. Thinking about it I think it seems like the right price cause hiring the private hospital will be the same regardless of what surgery you&#39;ll get. I just need time to recover from all of this physically and mentally.

Doesn&#39;t sound totally outrageous, I ended up paying more because I also got a nerve graft done to repair a damaged nerve at the same time -- mental nerve was cut on one side and the screw on the other just barely missed.
</p>
<p>
Hardware removal was totally worth it, still waiting to see if nerve graft worked...

Yeah I agree. I plan on seeing him again next year and hopefully, he&#39;ll still remember all the details. I can have it now but I worry about repeated trauma to my face.

I think like 6-18 months later is typical for hardware removal, mine was towards the end of that range. Waiting longer risks bone growth getting in the way from my understanding. Recovery was much, much easier than FFS -- like only a week for the worst swelling to go down and totally normal appearing about a month out. Also, because the surgeon was actually a professional oral surgeon he was also able to fix things like gum webbing etc left by the first surgeon.

I&#39;m also worried about webbing. Hopefully, I won&#39;t get them. Who did your primary surgery?

Deschanps-Braly? Why didn&#39;t you just go to him to get them removed? And can&#39;t believe he put screws close to your teeth roots too ðŸ˜±

Yeah he really messed up the screws as well as cutting the nerve, but his team denied it when I presented the evidence from other people I talked to. I wanted the nerve graft done at the same time and wanted someone who specialized in that and who I trusted more by that point.  Cost a lot unfortunately.

Oh do nerve grafts work? I heard some mixed things about it. There are 2 plastic surgeons here in London who do them. Are you overall happy with your ffs or did you develop various issues. I&#39;m not brave enough to have multiple surgeries on the same area. I saw on RS a lady who had surgery on her chin 3 times and now her face is crooked. One of the reasons, I wanna give my face time.

It seems to depend a lot on the type of nerve damage, sensory nerves (like mine) are more promising than motor nerves. I&#39;m about 3 months out and I get the electric shocks sometimes but overall left lower lip is still numb.
</p>
</li>

<p>
I have mixed opinions about my FFS -- overall the results are aesthetically very good however I wish D-B was better about exploring what patient explicitly wants, or that I was more vocal about what I wanted because there are some things I would have wanted to do differently -- however as a client things can be hard to put into words. I had various temporary issues after surgery but the only lasting one is loss of left lower lip sensation and damage to lower left front teeth requiring root canals.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had anything redone for aesthetic reasons, but had considered it for the first year. At around 20 months out from FFS the things I was initially disappointed in have either healed -- nose was crooked for like a year before it reset properly, vestiges of jaw swelling took over a year to go away; or, are just part of my face now, that I&#39;m used to, and aren&#39;t negative passing-wise, they are just &#34;different&#34; than what I had and what I expected.  I do expect I&#39;ll get some hair grafts to temple area though.

Hi I was hoping you could update about your experience with Dr Braly, did anything get resolved?
