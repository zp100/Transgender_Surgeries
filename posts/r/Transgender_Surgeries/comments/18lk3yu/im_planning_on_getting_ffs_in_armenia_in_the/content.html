I&#39;m planning on getting ffs in Armenia in the future with Anna Sluzky from Facemaker. Apparently I can only pay in cash, but I can&#39;t withdraw that amount of money from an atm. How would I withdraw the money in US dollars when I&#39;m there? (I&#39;m from the UK) Thanks in advance for any help.

Also however I withdraw the money will telling my bank ahead of time that I&#39;ll be withdrawing a large amount of money in Armenia be enough for them not to block it?
</p>
<p>
Also it seems like paying in cash is the only option, I asked about this but there is a language barrier so I&#39;m not sure if that is the case? Thanks in advance for any advice.

You can order cash at your bank and take it with you physically. Don&#39;t forget to declare it when entering Armenia. You might have to pay a bribe, although Armenia is one of the not very corrupt ex-soviet states.

When I had my sex reassignment surgery I withdrew the cash at home and carried it with me. I&#39;ve never heard of it being illegal to do so anywhere, although some countries require one to declare it at customs.
</p>
<p>
Be careful, though... at least in the USA police have the right to confiscate any money they find on anyone under &#34;
<a href="https://ij.org/report/frustrating-corrupt-unfair/" rel="nofollow">civil forfeiture
</a>
&#34; even if the owner is not charged with or personally suspected of any crime—and once that happens there&#39;s no way to get it back other than to prove in court that you&#39;re not guilty.
</p>
<p>
That can be pretty hard to do...

Thanks for the advice, do you know if there&#39;s anything like civil forfeiture in the UK or Armenia? I&#39;ll be leaving from the UK to have the surgery done in Armenia.

I have no information, but doubt it. It&#39;s part of the &#34;war on drugs&#34; program, and since it enables the police and prosecutors  to pocket the money/cars/houses/whatever for their own profit, that&#39;s what some districts have used it for.
</p>
<p>
I took a taxi from the airport to where I needed to go, and deposited the cash with the surgical team on arrival.

It&#39;s because of sanctions on Russia I think... She operates in Armenia because of that too from what I remember

Hi love, I’m about to fly out with British pounds in my bag. If you’d like to ask me anything, even though I’m a little apprehensive myself, please feel free to do so.

Hi girl! How’d it go flying with Pounds in your bag? Did they ask you to declare it in Armenia? Were you able to see Ana?

Hi love. It’s going good. I’ve had the procedure and got back home only a couple days ago from Armenia. Results are good, recovery gone very well minus one little stress reaction from the skin on my head that’s recovering.
</p>
<p>
I will make a post on everything and try to answer all the questions but have been busy.
</p>
<p>
On the payment: she only takes cash. I paid in UK pounds, but I think she takes any and all currencies (euro, dollar, gbp). I had zero issue travelling with money. Anything under £10’000 doesn’t need to be declared so I just had it in my bag in £50 notes to reduce amount of notes. Nobody ever questioned it or asked a question about it. I had £9600. I went via Turkey, so three airports and no issue. I didn’t have to convert anything and just paid Anna on the day. Her prices are listed in dollars, so the morning of the procedure I added up what I’m having in dollars, converted it to pounds on the days exchange rate and paid her that amount, around £8050 I think, cheaper than I expected when I travelled.
</p>
<p>
Would you like an invite into the Telegram group hosted by her assistant Sveta? There’s around 50 of us now in there with old and prospective patients all asking and answering questions. Very friendly, active and helpful.
</p>
<p>
Let me know.
</p>
<p>
All the best love.

I think I remember hearing a while ago she was looking at Tel Aviv and I never asked but yes she’s still in Armenia, and seems comfortable there.

My current estimate for what I&#39;m planning on getting is about £16,000. That includes the hospital stay. But I&#39;ll need to budget for the hotel, flight, and travel insurance on top of that. Also I&#39;ll need to get a scan of my head to send to Anna, if I remember correctly this costs about £300 to £700 in the UK.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had a consultation with Anna yet, this is just my own estimate based on the prices listed on her website, linked below.

Also if you&#39;re wondering as well, I&#39;ve found out after posting this question that just withdrawing the money in cash in the UK then declaring it when I take it through customs isn&#39;t that big of a deal.
