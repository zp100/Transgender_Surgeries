Are you using silicone gel or tape on the scars?

Tbh before I had my BA a few weeks ago, I remember when i saw one of your other posts for your BA and I was thinking to myself “goodness i hope mine dont turn out looking like that maybe its a trans thing i will be so disappointed”. That was my initial thought. Looking at your breasts now I am amazed and am so happy they dropped and fluffed real nice for you. You have pretty boobies now. Funny thing is now im going through the Frankenboob stage you went through lol. So you give me hope mine will drop and fluff nicely too

Yeh - I was scared to post them initially!  I was so worried I didn&#39;t get the right things or the surgeon, despite reassurances....  but as she predicted, they&#39;d fall I to place lovely!  She told me that at 6 months I&#39;ll be happy, but not as happy as I&#39;ll be at 12 months!
</p>
<p>
Just be patient, follow your care plan, and don&#39;t force anything!  I was told NOT to wear the thing around your body that forces them down and I to place. Others said you need to, but if your surgeon said don&#39;t then definetly don&#39;t!  Also - wear your compression/sports bra 23x7 for the first 6 weeks (to bed, to work, to play).  Keep them pushed up so to speak so the tissues can heal before you let them start to drop.
</p>
<p>
Mine were rock solid - super hard and uncomfortable for weeks!  This too remarkably changes!  They are soooo soft and squishy now.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

Thanks so much. My surgeon also didnt say anything about a strap to push my boobs down. Tbh though, when i asked him could i do breast massage he gave like a half yes and said just to kind of massage at the top but ive been doing other massages such as pushing the breasts in and out up and down and squeezing. I just dont want capsular contraction and want a good result. Im just a little over two weeks

They told me to refrain from that for the first 6 weeks. They didn&#39;t want me moving them at all - they needed to stay high until that point. At that point she cleared me for whatever (sleeping on my side, massages, regular bras (without underwire) etc.

Oh yeah, and make you second guess what you&#39;ve been told...your surgeon knows best from their experience.

Thanks!  Under the muscle - and I was against this initially...my surgeon only does it this way and she convinced me to go for it...I highly recommend it!  They feel so much like my cis wife&#39;s!  No weird lines at edges of implants, no rippling, and they just feel natural!
