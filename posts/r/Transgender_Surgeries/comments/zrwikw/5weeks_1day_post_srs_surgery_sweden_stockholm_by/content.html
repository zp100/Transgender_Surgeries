<p>
after 4 weeks my dilition changed frequency from 3x 30 min to 2x 20 min and then I also noticed a significant improvement in healing.
</p>
<p>
The situation for today is that the pain has generally left me, the only exception when it hurts is when I want to pee. I don&#39;t know if you have that too?
</p>
<p>
the depth has not decreased, the only difference is in the warm-up which is perhaps a bit heavier but starting from the smallest dildo to the largest no problem and no pain.
</p>
<p>
I feel better and more stable after 5 weeks I see a significant improvement. Well done !
