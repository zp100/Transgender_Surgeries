Looks great! I was so curious why the tape on the nipple since I seen the ones for the bottom incision. Thanks for the info and they look amazing! I hope for a fast and speedy recovery for you!

Of course! I am hoping that that tape has a positive impact on my areolas. Definitely will provide an update once they come off

Honestly I have no idea! My nipples have always been massive though. I started taking progesterone pretty early on, maybe about 5 months in. From there, I took it mostly orally but tried taking it rectally about 10% of the time.
</p>
<p>
Something that may have had a bigger effect is my (accidental) cycling of progesterone. Once I stopped taking pills and moved to injections at around the 16 month mark, I was really bad at forgetting to take progesterone at nighttime. I probably only took it 60-70% of the time.

I (finally) had breast Aug after 5 years on hrt! I went to Dr Jessica Hsu in Michigan, and had 450 round moderate plus silicone implants under the muscle with a boob crease incision. I am so incredibly happy with them!
</p>
<p>
Couple notes. I had a pretty hefty complication following the immediate surgery. About 15 minutes into my drive home once being cleared for recovery, I noticed one boob was much more full at the top (near my armpit) than the other, and it also hurt a immensely more. Fast forward 30 minutes when we finally got home, and the pain and swelling were worse. We called the on call surgeon, and they had us come in immediately due to a hematoma. After driving to the ER (another 45 minute drive), I was feeling incredibly lightheaded, was pale, and had intense pain in my left boob. I had blood work done and met with the plastic surgeon on call who then explained what the surgery plan was. They were planning to perform a revision surgery in the ER as soon as possible. They also kept throwing around &#34;blood transfusion&#34; since I had lost a considerable amount of blood to the hematoma by this point. By this time, it was around 6 hours since the start of the previous surgery. Sadly, in recovery I had 4 saltine crackers, and as such I wasn&#39;t able to go back under due to anesthesia concerns. So I had to wait another 6 hours in the ER. Luckily, I got a room with a bed, and the bed was absurdly comfortable. Also the ER nurse was really friendly.
</p>
<p>
The revision surgery went without a hitch, starting around 12 hours after the initial surgery began. Following waking up, I was feeling immensely better and my pain level fell from an 8 to a 2 or 3 for the many hours following that.
</p>
<p>
This entire surgery process happened across a two day stretch, Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning. The last 4 days have been incredibly smooth, recovery has been a lot easier than the initial surgical complications, and I am so happy to have my girlfriend supporting me through all of this. The only real issues have been sitting up in the first couple days since my chest muscle was cut up. I&#39;ve had to heavily rely on my legs and abs to get me up.
</p>
<p>
Having larger boobs is so gender affirming, it&#39;s honestly really hard to describe. As I&#39;m typing this, my arms are gently resting on my new boobs and their weight and size is a constant reminder that this was the best decision. It feels like this part of my body finally lines up with what I&#39;ve always wanted. Also, they look so good!! They are still pretty firm and my skin is pretty taught, but that will fix with time.
</p>
<p>
One question I did have was about my areolas. During operating, my surgeon noted that my areolas, which has always had a bit of outward protrusion (looking like mini mountain slopes with my nipples being the mountain peak), actually had more protrusion once the implant was inserted. She put steri strips on them to keep them down in hopes of having them stretch with the skin. She had mentioned that a revision surgery could be an option if I didn&#39;t like the protrusion, and that some of the areola skin could be removed so that they were more flush to the rest of my breast. I&#39;m not really sure what to do about this yet, and was wondering if anyone had a similar thing happen to them.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, that was my experience. Overall, definitely stressful but immensely worth it! I had complete trust in my surgeon and her team throughout this entire process, and I believe she did a phenomenal job. Also, I might be a 34DDD after this!! Which is absolutely incredible and very unexpected since I started as a 34A/B
</p>
<p>
Thanks y&#39;all!

They look great. I also had augmentation two weeks ago I ended up 32DDD (425 cc, mentor). Though they freaked me out when I woke up cause they were massive (and I had pretty good tissue already). They have dropped now and look much better but they are still not as soft as I want them to be. Have a great recovery!

Thanks for sharing your experience! I actually had a similar reaction when I first woke up and was aware of their size. For me, the weight on my chest was the biggest shock, but that quickly ended up turning into the biggest area of euphoria.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s so exciting that after just 2 weeks yours have already dropped! I have heard the softening up takes several months, so fingers crossed for both of us.

It was pretty scary. I really thought I was going to need a blood transfusion for a good 4 hours while I was there. But luckily, I had a great care team and my girlfriend was incredibly supportive and at my side through all of it

This might be a strange question, but did you have to pay more money as a result of the emergency revision surgery? I worry about planning and saving up for a surgery, then something unplanned like that happens, and doubles the cost. (I&#39;m hoping it didn&#39;t double the cost?)

So I am not entirely sure yet as I haven&#39;t gotten the bill back from my provider or from my insurance company. I will definitely let you know when I find out.
</p>
<p>
The billing department did say that my surgery was lumped as one event, so it may be combined? I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m kinda worried about it myself tbh
