My voice felt so weak and strained when I was allowed to speak again. However, what it didn&#39;t sound like was a guy&#39;s voice, and it didn&#39;t feel wrong or unnatural, just hilariously terrible. At about the 6 week mark, it felt a lot better, but still weak and easy to tire (right before I got a sore throat and then bronchitis).

I&#39;d give some thought to how you&#39;re going to communicate while on voice rest and reduced voice use in advance. I used a TTS app on my phone along with a bluetooth keyboard, and a tablet with digital pen, and for the most part it worked pretty well.

Honestly, its going to be lots of typing messages on my phone and showing people, pens and paper and probably a lot of pointing. Lol. Idk what else i could do. I dont have a tablet
</p>
<p>
If there is an app, id love to try it out. Can you recommend an app to use

I&#39;ve got an Android phone and used Sirene, which was free. It&#39;s pretty simple, you can create pre-saved phrases (eg, Thank you), or go free-form text entry and it&#39;ll faithfully translate it into speech. Not sure what other options are out there, especially for iPhone. As mentioned, I picked up a bluetooth keyboard that fit in my bag to help carry on conversations since I can type much more quickly on a QWERTY keyboard than I can on my phone&#39;s screen.
</p>
<p>
I pretty much used my tablet like pen and paper, but it had the advantage of never running out of paper. :)

Maybe i need a tablet. And an Android. Lol. I wish something like Sirene was available for Iphone, it sounds like a great tool.
</p>
<p>
I agree, i can type much faster then i can “text”. Maybe i will pick up a bluetooth kb.

(I wrote Sirene!)

<p>
Ugh, the irony is, Sirene actually fucking
<em>
works
</em>
on iOS already, I just cannot for the life of me get the fucking App Store submission to work, because working on the iOS platform is absolute misery. At some point I&#39;m gonna have another go at it because I know so many people use iOS
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Sirene is compatible with even older Android tablets / phones (5.1 Lollipop and above), there are lots of cheap Android devices on Craigslist

No guarantee how well it works, but a quick search turned up:
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/text-to-speech/id712104788" rel="nofollow">https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/text-to-speech/id712104788
</a>
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re thinking tablet, I understand that some of the recent iPads support the Apple Pencil. I wouldn&#39;t call it necessary for recovery, it was just a tool that I already had, and found it useful. The low-budget option could be a boogie board.

Like others said, there isn&#39;t really that &#34;Blind person can see&#34; kind of moment, your voice is janky and comes back gradually. I&#39;m 9mo out from VFS with Dr. Thomas and I&#39;m super happy with how it turned out

...I tend to paroxysmally sneeze, would this be a complication factor? But the idea of sneezing and coughing in a girly way is ... very appealing. If I can get there with voice training I’d be happy

That moment never really happened. When I could speak I was hoarse with a weird voice. It settled down over a while and I had my new voice, but as a result, there was no real &#34;first moment&#34;

So it is just a gradual change from the time you are done with vocal rest until your new voice settles into place?

Yep. My voice was clearly different, but it was like I was recovering from laryngitis or something, so it was a while before I know what the final result sounded like

Thank you so much. This is my first trans related surgery, and the one I prioritized the most for those exact reasons you mentioned. I expect this to be the most important surgery ill have. I cannot wait.
</p>
<p>
I really will. I am taking 8 weeks leave from work to fully recover and follow his rest schedule to a T. And i just looked up the BB tablet, its only $20! Im buying one right now and having it shipped to my airbnb. Thank you!!

I considered all options when i decided i wanted VFS. I originally thought i was going to
<a href="mailto:Kim@Yeson">Kim@Yeson
</a>
. Then i considered Haben. But after hearing and seeing about Thomas and his different technique, i knew he was the one.
</p>
<p>
Jody from his office said the same thing. That it could take up to a year for my voice to finally “fall into place”. So i am a little anxious and still a little worried about what happens if i have a poor result. But i really believe everything will work out great.

Yes. My surgery for a Feminization Laryngoplasty and Thyrohyoid Elevation was just over $11K

So with Dr Thomas, he actually includes a trach shave for free when getting FemLar. So mine is included already. But if you are not going with Dr Thomas, ive read a trach shave can mess up your results, so to do a trach shave before vocal surgery.

If you&#39;re considering a trach shave, make sure to ask your potential surgeons how they protect the vocal cords. If they don&#39;t have a good answer, consider giving them a pass for that. As
<a href="/u/Girl-UnSure" rel="nofollow">/u/Girl-UnSure
</a>
mentioned, Dr. Thomas&#39;s procedure incorporates a very comprehensive trach shave, and other voice surgeons are usually able to offer them too.

I&#39;m almost 3 months post op from Dr Thomas. As others have said, first time speaking is jarring. I sounded like a smoker with laryngitis for a while. By this point it doesn&#39;t &#34;feel&#34; like my voice is any different than before because I am used to it, but comparing a before and after is like night and day... Huge improvement. I&#39;m definitely very happy with it. I just wish my scar want quite so visible, but it doesn&#39;t bother me that much. Hopefully it clears up more over the coming months. Honestly the hardest part of the whole process was the emotional toil from not behind able to speak. I could communicate by texting or tts, but it was so slow that it usually wasn&#39;t worth it. I felt really disconnected from my friends and family during that time.

I didnt even think about that. Hopefully they will have patience with me. The scar also worried me, but everyone says it is small, like an inch at most. Im hoping both of ours are not very visible, and just kind of fades into a hidden part of my neck.
</p>
<p>
Jody did say ill have some laryngitis type effects for a few months. Which will suck, but if the after is worth it, im ready for the winter.
</p>
<p>
The change is what i am so excited for. I really hope i come out of this sounding cis. Bright, vibrant, airy. No booming resonance. At the very least, like a April Ludgate/Aubrey Plaza type voice.
</p>
<p>
Id love to be able to do a typical horror movie scream, or even a “Woo” like many girls do at concerts, but i may have missed the puberty boat on that. Im keeping my fingers crossed though.

It&#39;s more than an inch, mine is at least 2&#34; - you really need to seriously take care of it, go buy

and put it on twice a day after the incision is healed (i.e. once it&#39;s sealed and isn&#39;t open), and also go hard on sunscreen
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t give any fucks about it and I live in California, and now my zombie chic look might be permanent (though faded)

So i first contacted them in January 2019, decided fully i wanted to do it in March 2019. They told me i couldnt start paying them until i had a definitive date, which would take a while. They said id have a date somewhere in the Spring/Summer of 2020.
</p>
<p>
In May 2019 (two months later) Jody called me and said they had a cancellation and can get me in for a date in Nov 19. (This tuesday the 12th) and that i can start paying. So for my situation, i made first contact in Jan 2019, committed in March 2019, offered a date in May 2019 and will have surgery in Nov 2019. So less than a year for me.

So ive been on vocal rest for three days now, which hasnt been tooooooo difficult. Sometimes it has gotten annoying, but its fine. Ive been swollen, so that stinks. It definitely feels like having strep throat or laryngitis, but without the pain. So just some annoyance when swallowing. I wont have any idea how things are going for at least a few weeks, but probably more. So i have just been enjoying my time in Portland. I leave tomorrow, so hopefully there are no complications.
</p>
<p>
The scar is larger than i thought it would be, but he said it may be the best he has ever done. But everything overall looks normal and is healing as expected.
