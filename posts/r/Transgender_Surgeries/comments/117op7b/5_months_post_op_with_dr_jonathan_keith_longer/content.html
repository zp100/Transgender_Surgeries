so i don’t use reddit much but it was a helpful resource for me in researching surgeons so i wanted to contribute. i’ll be around answering questions on this post for probably a couple days.
</p>
<p>
i’m just over 5 months post op peritoneal graft vaginoplasty with dr. jonathan keith (plastic surgeon) and dr. nitrin patel (urologist). the headline is that i’m generally quite happy with my results and very happy with my post-op care through dr. keith’s team. i’ll do a quick recap of my experience and then discuss specific things i think are worth noting.
</p>
<p>
recap: i first reached out to dr. keith’s office in february of 22 and was given an initial consult date in feb 23. however, sometime spring of 22 i got a call saying they’d had a cancellation and could schedule my consult for june 22. at my consult dr keith began by asking what i wanted from surgery (to me this was a green flag) and when i said just wanted the standard vaginoplasty, he explained the procedure to me in detail and did a brief inspection of my junk. afterwords, i was sent for a consult with dr. patel who did another examination and helped answer some questions i’d had since my initial consult. then, dr keith’s office reached out with a surgey date in september 22. so all in all about a 7 month turnaround from initial contact to surgery. i had a brief check in with dr keith a week prior to surgery and then it was surgery day!
</p>
<p>
the procedure: dr. keith uses a peritoneal graft method, which differs slightly from the peritoneal pull through. using a robot, dr. patel makes five incisions in the belly and  takes a graft of the peritoneum. additionally, the robot is used to close up the peritoneum and to attach the neovaginal canal to the peritoneum from the inside. this also allows the vaginal canal to be stitched on the sides to pelvic floor muscles, which helps support the canal. more on this later. most of the vaginal canal is constructed from the peritoneal graft, meaning that available genital tissue is generally not a constraint (this was something i worried about, as i wasn’t well endowed to start and i had a lot of atrophy on E). from what dr. patel told me, depth is more a factor of height, which i have plenty of. the external genetalia is just your standard srs with the perk that dr. keith doesn’t require hair removal.
</p>
<p>
my results: in terms of external stuff, i honestly wasn’t that concerned about the aesthetic cuz the range of natal vulvas is already so broad. my friend had gotten surgery with dr keith and hers looked great so look was the least of my worries. as it is, im very happy with my results aesthetically, especially given that things still have a lot of settling to do in terms of swelling
</p>
<p>
clit function so far is good. have been able to orgasm from oral and getting fingered, and both feel great. i’m still able to have both of the two types orgasm i had before surgery which for lack of better terms i think of as boy orgasms (more genital focused, usually comes with ejaculation, albeit the kind you’d associate with 5+ years of estrogen— i can still do this post op which is so sick) and girl orgasms (full body, muscles get really tense, then relax). i actually find that the boy orgasms feel much much better than they did pre-op but post-estrogen.
</p>
<p>
haven’t done much with my canal so far aside from getting fingered a couple times, which felt neutral to good. i still have some pain which is very normal and at this point i think is much more about muscle tightness and nerve weirdness than anything else. to be honest, right now the idea of anything penetrative is pretty unappealing to me, so i’m trying not to rush things. from talking to people who had penile inversion, i believe this may be related to the more invasive nature of a peritoneal graft.
</p>
<p>
as far as self-lubrication, i’m still wearing a pad every day not for blood but because my pussy is just that wet lol. i sleep without one and when i wake up my underwear are soaked thru. i trust that this will decrease with time, but i’m certainly feeling optimistic on the self-lubrication front. every time i’ve been fingered i haven’t needed any lube. i also have seen some evidence that the lubrication is related to arousal, but i can’t be sure yet.
</p>
<p>
post-op experiences: dr keith does surgery at two different hospitals. mine was at robert wood johnson in somerville and i generally had a good stay there. the nurses and orderlies were all very kind and in general we’re not weird about my transness. shout out to regina, who was an absolute blessing. however, the time in the hospital sucked HARD. i was in bed pretty much 24/7 for a week, getting up a few times every day to walk around the floor. in the meantime, i had an iv, a catheter, and two drains in my pubic area, which made moving around a pain in the ass. that week was probably the hardest part. after a week, i went into the OR again to have the drains and catheter removed and once i was able to pee on my own (took a couple hours before i needed to go) they sent me home.
</p>
<p>
after i was home for a couple weeks, i had a dehiscence one evening as i was getting ready to dilate, which is when a stitch bursts. i just started bleeding dark, dark blood from my vagina and pretty much freaked out. i had my mom call the paramedics and then i called dr keith’s office. this was after 9 on a saturday night so i wasn’t expecting to reach anyone, but i got through to dr keith. he was great and helped me calm down a lot. the paramedics confirmed that everything looked fine and then dr keith’s office got me in on monday to double check. this happened a couple more times during my recovery, but each time it was mentally easier. if it had any effect on my physical healing, i can’t see it. mentally though it was really tough. i was scared to move too much from fear of springing a leak again, and i’m still mentally working through some of the after effects.
</p>
<p>
my experience with dr. keith and his office staff has been phenomenal. they’re all incredibly professional and well organized, easy to reach, and empathetic. in particular, kate, the physician’s assistant who does most of the post op checkups after the first couple months, helped me so much to feel safe after all the bleeding. in addition, the office will handle insurance for you. dr keith was out of network for me, but the office was able to get me out of network coverage and so far i haven’t paid a cent. especially compared to stories i’ve heard about other surgeon’s offices, i can’t recommend their team highly enough.

forgot to follow up on the thing about the internal stitching. dilating has been hard for me i believe because of my early experiences post-op. my pelvic floor pt just told be to bump up to orange, and i can just barely get that to 4 dots showing. however, i have a lot of depth, enough that no one (me or the doctor) can hit the end of my canal with a finger. i believe that if it wasn’t for the stitching that’s possible with the robot, i probably would have lost depth by now. as it stands, i don’t believe that i’ve lost much, if any depth or width.

Dr. Keith’s staff is really amazing. I just saw Kate yesterday for my six month post op. I had my surgery September 7th. My surgery was at Cooperman Barnabas I Livingston. The nurses and staff there were likewise amazing. I’ve been really impressed with how often they’ve seen me for post op care. My next appointment is in three months.

Great summary. Will be getting a consult with Dr Kieth soon. Had an orchi with Dr Patel last August. He was wonderful.
