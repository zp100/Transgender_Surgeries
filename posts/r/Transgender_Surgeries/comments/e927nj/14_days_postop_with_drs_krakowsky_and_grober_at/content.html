Another relatively uneventful day, but that&#39;s kind of a good thing in a way. Nothing went horribly off the rails. I&#39;ve felt a bit low energy, but not particularly wiped out. And the one time I was really in any major pain was when I let myself hit trough on all 3 pain meds at the same time (tylenol, ibuprofen, oxy).
</p>
<p>
Still not getting uninterrupted sleep at night, sadly, but I am getting back to sleep better, and I am getting enough sleep so that I&#39;m feeling rested in the morning. Still looking very forward to being able to sleep on my side again. I spoke with the nurse practitioner at ARC about my bowel movements and hemorrhoids (having developed an external one since surgery, probably during the epic first bowel movement the first weekend I was here.) She recommended a stronger laxative to try to further soften my stools to avoid further aggravating my hemorrhoids, and to wait until after things normalize before looking at intervention to remove them.
</p>
<p>
I also asked her to take a quick look at my vulva to get her take on the wound separation and the brownish stuff in my vestibule. Her take on the wound separation is that it is still present, but looks minor, and that there isn&#39;t a ton of brownish stuff left at this point, and that it could be crusting from the oozing I&#39;ve had in the area. Otherwise, for 2 weeks post op, it looks pretty good.
</p>
<p>
I pooped twice this morning after speaking with the NP, my bowels are still messed up from the opioids, and I&#39;ve been taking laxatives to counteract. I&#39;ll be very happy to get back to regular bowel movements after I come off the pain killers.
</p>
<p>
Nominally, today would have been the day to start going up in dilator size, however I have had some wound separation at the posterior end, so Emery would like me to wait at least until I see them again on Thursday to make an informed decision.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, today has been a pretty good day, we went out for lunch, and I didn&#39;t feel wiped out afterwards. I haven&#39;t seen blood on my dilator at all today, and I&#39;m definitely in a better emotional space than I was on Friday. Though I still feel pieced together. Baby steps.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m finding less urgency in writing these updates, so I&#39;ll probably taper off and mainly update when something significant happens (like a follow up milestone, for example.)
