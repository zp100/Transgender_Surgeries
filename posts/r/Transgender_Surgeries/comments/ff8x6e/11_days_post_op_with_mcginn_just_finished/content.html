I posted this mostly because I have been blown away at how quickly I have been healing.
</p>
<p>
It is now 12 days post op for me, and my life is pretty back to normal. I had simultaneous GCS and BA.
</p>
<p>
I was cleared to go home on day 10 and told I can resume most light activities (except working out and sex) as I feel comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Iâ€™ve taken one little step after another into life and Iâ€™m feeling great! Iâ€™m driving for short drives. Ive been shopping. Iâ€™ve gone out to eat. I can sit for about a half hour with a donut cushion.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon instructed me to take daily walks, and Iâ€™m going out for a mile at a time.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m already caught up on my work email, and on Monday, I plan to return to the office for 2-3 hours a day. Fortunately I have a sit-stand desk both in my office and at home. This allows me to vary my position and stay productive with minimal discomfort.
</p>
<p>
Yes, you read that right. Iâ€™m returning to work 13 days after gender confirmation surgery.
</p>
<p>
Please note, no one can count on a speedy recovery like this. However, Iâ€™m sharing as an example of whatâ€™s possible in one extreme. We wonâ€™t all need 6 weeks off work.
</p>
<p>
I got lucky, but I was also prepared. Iâ€™m in excellent shape and eat very healthy. I spent extra time getting everything ready before surgery. I also have a history of recovering quickly. I was back at work 9 days after FFS with no issues.

Oh her website is awful. Please donâ€™t judge her skills as a surgeon based on that.
</p>
<p>
I recommend just scheduling a consultation if youâ€™re interested. Are there any questions I might be able to help with?

All of these McGinn results Iâ€™m seeing have me favoring her as the surgeon I choose, not that itâ€™ll be anytime soon ðŸ˜ž but your results are amazing!

We didnâ€™t discuss incision placement at all. She just did what she thought was best.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors? Do you recommend Dr. McGinn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in New Hope? How was Dr. McGinn aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

Recover has been great and very quick! Read my other comment.
</p>
<p>
I looked into some other surgeons, but Dr. McGinn was my first choice for several reasons: mostly because she has been putting out consistent quality results for years, she is pretty close to where I live, she could me my desired timeline for surgery, and she offered simultaneous breast augmentation as an option. After I had my in-person consultation, I knew she was the one.
</p>
<p>
I had a great experience and would definitely recommend.
</p>
<p>
In terms of cosmetics and sensitivity, itâ€™s too soon to tell for either, but it think that the speed of my recovery is a good sign for each. I like what I can see for now. Iâ€™m getting the electric shock sensation, which is a sign of the nerves recovering.
</p>
<p>
Depth is holding steady at 6 inches.
</p>
<p>
New Hope is beautiful. I found a spacious and affordable Airbnb.
</p>
<p>
Aftercare has been good. Routine stuff is handled by her physicians assistant Kristal, and sheâ€™s awesome. If everything is going well and complication free, you donâ€™t actually see McGinn that much after surgery. McGinn just came in to take a look and ask me if I have any questions.

She normally uses a scrotal skin graft for anyone who doesnâ€™t have enough penile tissue. As I understand this is virtually all of her patients who are circumcised. She did this on me.
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s my understanding that your internal anatomy that determines depth, rather than the amount of skin: how much room do you have inside for the surgeon to safely make the cavity.
</p>
<p>
In regards to one vs two stage. Im pretty sure that her second stage is purely cosmetic to refine the labia and it is optional. Itâ€™s included in her price, but most of her patients are satisfied with the single stage and do not schedule a second stage. At this point, I doubt I will.
