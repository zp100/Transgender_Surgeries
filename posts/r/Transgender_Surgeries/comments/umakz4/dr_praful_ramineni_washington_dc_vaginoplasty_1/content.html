Looks great.  How has your experience been overall?  Why did you need a revision?   My own surgery is in a few hours from now. Between the bowel prep, excitement, and nerves thrown in I will get no sleep until anesthesia.

It’s been really great. Dr Ramineni is excellent in terms of bedside manner and attentiveness.
</p>
<p>
The first 2-4 weeks were the worst in terms of recovery. Sitting comfortably took a cpl months.
</p>
<p>
Had sex for the first time at my three month mark, it was ok but a bit uncomfortable. For safety reasons I don’t recommend it but I hooked up without disclosing (I am stealth) successfully by about my 4 month mark (pre revision)
</p>
<p>
Revision wise, it was for three main reasons. 1) my clitoris was a bit over exposed 2) labia majora was a little spread and didn’t quite go all the way down to cover the canal opening which sorta made me look gaping. 3) My urethra didn’t heal quite perfectly and was a bit asymmetrical and was spraying when i peed.
</p>
<p>
Insurance covered both for the most part. But paid about 2k out of pocket total.
</p>
<p>
Dilation was the most inconvenient thing by a very large margin especially the first 4 months being 3x per day. I then did 2x a day until about 10 months post op then recently I’ve done once a day. I think I’ll try every other day by about my 1.5 year mark.
</p>
<p>
For what is worth, i got up to the big dilator (orange) by my 4 month mark. A cpl other ladies that got bottom surgery the same day with me didn’t move through the sizes as quickly.

<p>
This is a personal question so feel free not to answer, but have you ever had an unsuccessful stealth hookup? And have you had to do anything differently or mindfully to avoid getting clocked during sex (like avoiding oral, pre-inserting lube, etc)?

Nope. Overall, I&#39;ve hooked up 6 maybe 7 times total. Maybe about half did go down on me without issue. For lube early on I just used it, it&#39;s not totally unusual for cis women to need help. At this point, a modest amount of saliva is generally sufficient.

Hi Julie! Did you continue dilation right after the revision? Was is painful or harder? I’m also having a labia majora revision at 8 months marks and I’m a little worried that I will lose progress in the dilation scheme.

My surgeon had me stop for 3 days before resuming. By that time I was already on orange but did go back down to blue when i restarted but was back to orange after a couple of weeks.
</p>
<p>
For what it’s worth, I currently do final dot on orange and only dilate every two days without issue

Hmmm ok, so you did not dilate for 3 days straight at the 6 months mark after SRS and you didn’t lose depth, right? That’s very reassuring. Maybe in my case it will be even less time because my revision will only involve the labia majora.

That’s correct, yes. My revision was to tighten up the labia majora, fix up my urethra a bit, and pretty up the clitoris area, no depth revision

I had surgery with him today.  He told me he leaves the dome of the vaginal graft open and basically plastered against the peritoneum.  It becomes the dome and with dilationthe peritoneal part can be expanded. It usually provides some self lubrication.

Full depth. Dilation wise I can get the last dot of the orange dilator (the largest soul source one) right to the entrance of the canal. I wasn&#39;t big, maybe 4.5/5 inches erect (pre HRT, it was basically impossible to get an erection once on E)

Great results. May I ask what is the wait time scheduling a consultation to surgery with Dr Ramineni?
