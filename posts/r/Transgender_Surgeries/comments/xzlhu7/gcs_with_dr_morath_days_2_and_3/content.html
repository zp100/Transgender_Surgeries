Hi lovelies! Iâ€™m back with a new update. I have also decided that Iâ€™ll start doing them every 2-3 days, so thereâ€™s enough to tell you about, and possibly less down the line as things become less eventful. Letâ€™s do it!
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 2
</em>
All continued to go by the book. I could sleep over 10 hours and woke up with little pain, which is easily manageable with oral analgesia (today, in fact, was the first day I could go through without IV analgesia): 3 ibuprofen-like tablets with every meal and a small dose of something stronger in the morning and in the night. Pain today ranged between 2 and 3, and rapidly went away with the oral analgesia.
</p>
<p>
I keep having nausea but it seems we found out the source! I noticed that I always felt nausea and dizziness right after they administered one of the antibiotics. I mentioned it, looked it up, and yes, itâ€™s a rather common side effect of it. Now Iâ€™m always prepared when it comes and if the feeling doesnâ€™t go in some 15-20 minutes they always give me some meds against nausea and dizziness, which make them disappear within minutes.
</p>
<p>
I also had problems with gases in my tummy but that was because of the water they offered here: thereâ€™s only with gas and with less gas. I kept trying the less gassy one but continued to have problems. They gave me tablets to take with every meal if I had them again and told me I could safely drink two water. I asked some relatives that regularly visit to bring me some new water bottles and I started refilling them from the tap. Gases gone!
</p>
<p>
Down there everything continues in its place. A bit more swollen, but still not enough to need ice packs, and with a few hematomas, but advancing in the right direction. Thereâ€™s some bleeding but nothing significant (bandages now change around 3 times a day). Iâ€™m starting to recover sensitivity and can notice almost everything when they clean (and certainly on the new clitoris, ouch!). When they clean the area I always try to take a look with a small mirror while they do it and it feels it helps my brain to remap where everything is. I can also more or less feel where everything was before surgery as they clean and cure the area.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 3
</em>
After a night of not so restful sleep (I really canâ€™t get used to sleeping on my back!), I wake up without barely any pain and, as yesterday, the little I have goes away with the oral painkillers with breakfast. After I take them there are even moments in which I feel like nothing has really happened and my body feels completely normal (as long as I donâ€™t try to move, of course).
</p>
<p>
There was also a significant advance today, and as it happens I could walk without help and without getting dizzy! Quite the advance, as yesterday I couldnâ€™t walk more than a couple of steps before feeling like fainting, but today I could walk around the room twice and go to the bathroom to brush my teeth and empty the urine bag. The stent is though quite uncomfortable in between my legs and I have to walk almost like a penguin.
</p>
<p>
Today, Iâ€™m also back in a normal diet and they start giving me some powder in the mornings so when the moment comes my stool isnâ€™t too hard (youâ€™re not supposed to push!). I can feel the moment approaching and it sort of feels scary, but weâ€™ll deal with that when the moments comes.
</p>
<p>
Down there, everything, and particularly my labia minora, continue to be minimally swollen. Hematomas seem to start to be reabsorbed and I can see the colour of my skin slightly (very slightly) coming back in some areas. Sensitivity continues to come back slowly (and, as yesterday, mostly on my clit - although I can tell you that whatever sensation it has is not pleasurable! Neither painful though, just feels unknown while at the same time familiar, and weird).
</p>
