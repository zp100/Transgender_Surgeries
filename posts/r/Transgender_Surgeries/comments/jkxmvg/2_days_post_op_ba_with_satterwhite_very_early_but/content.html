Looks great! I talked to him before and feel that he is a very kindhearted and caring person.

He has a gentle demeanor and he understands trans people really well.  I also think he enjoys surgery and the aesthetics that go with the type of work he does.

Wait and you also had FFS simultaneously? What’s that on your chin? Also what size?

I had a revision for my jaw.  It was mostly untouched after my full ffs.  So I had v-line done.
</p>
<p>
I have 590cc medium plus, sub muscular, imframmamory incision.
</p>
<p>
I think those numbers scare people, bc on women who are 5&#39;3 that is a ridiculous size.  But much of that volume is width too, which give a nice fullness to the entire chest.
</p>
<p>
I expect to have fairly natural looking DD breasts in the end.

Yep, I got 600cc&#39;s. They&#39;re big, but it&#39;s not like I stand out ridiculously. My full bust measurement right now is 40 inches.

I was already 41&#34; with a 36 band.  Now I&#39;m a bit scared what my bust is, lol.  I want it to be believable.

I&#39;m really happy for you to have hit your goal :) Did you buy a swimsuit or bikini yet?

No, it&#39;s going to take awhile for them to drop, and I&#39;m working 6 days a week, twelve hours a day. I&#39;ve tried to do some shopping but with so many fitting rooms closed I haven&#39;t gotten to it. I &#34;inherited&#34; a fair amount of casual clothes from my ex, so I&#39;m just putting my head down and working my ass off through Christmas to save up SRS money.

You’re looking great already! I had mine done Wednesday as well, but my instructions are to keep em bandaged for a week, and I’m so impatient to see them. Hope they come out as good as yours!

Looks pretty good! Enjoy the sensations returning!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 5.5 weeks post-op and last night I was touching my nipples. I couldn&#39;t actually feel the nipples themselves, at all... but I still had an orgasm. Like, seriously? Sorry if TMI

Not tmi to discuss sensations, it&#39;s part of the process.
</p>
<p>
So is it weird mine have full sensitivity already?  At least on the surface?

OMG what?! That&#39;s so amazing!!!!! My breasts are probably my fave sex organ on me, and losing that would be pretty sad for me. I hadn&#39;t seriously considered BA because of that. I&#39;m still gonna wait a couple years, because things are getting better, and my sister took about five years to develop while mid way through year three.
</p>
<p>
Definitely food for thought though. Thanks!

Just avoid nipple incisions.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard BA makes your breasts more sensitive, and even though I&#39;ve only got about maybe 33% of feeling back, it&#39;s very true for me.

Was it a normal orgasm that you would have had doing the same thing pre surgery? Also that’s probably a good sign that you will regain feeling once they’ve healed enough. A month and a half is no time when it comes to body healing.
</p>
<p>
I have to say that’s also really interesting in terms of how orgasms are trigger via breast stimulation. Was there any other signs you were about to orgasm or was it just all of the sudden?
</p>
<p>
Sorry I’m so curious I’m just very into breast stimulation and have yet to have had an orgasm via that alone.

There wasn&#39;t any apparent connection to my genitals, it was a full-body orgasm that made my legs shake. It was just so weird that I couldn&#39;t feel my fingers but my whole body was responding and it was pure ecstasy. I was shaking all over when I stopped, and I didn&#39;t stop because I wanted to, I stopped because my brain was trying to go into autopilot and just keep going for who knows how long.
</p>
<p>
I saw my surgeon last week, she actually told me that I would take a long time to fully heal (which runs contrary to every previous healing experience) not because of anything bad, but because my skin is ridiculously healthy. So I know I&#39;m in for a ways. Thankfully work has me so busy that it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if I get to Christmas/New Years without putting any worry into my healing rate.
</p>
<p>
Also, prior to HRT I had zero breast/nipple sensation, and even on HRT I haven&#39;t enjoyed breast stimulation as much prior to my BA as I did the other day. I&#39;ve been told by others that patients tend to come out of BA&#39;s with more sensitivity than less (presuming they didn&#39;t get a nipple incision).

Insurance.  I was devastated that it might not happen but it did the day before surgery and I couldn&#39;t be more grateful.
</p>
<p>
He did my jaw too as a revision.  Will take longer to see and I haven&#39;t gotten the strap off.  I&#39;m rather nervous about it, lol

The process was hell.  They fight hard for their patients though.  I wouldn&#39;t have made it if my endo and pcp didn&#39;t love me and respond in an hour like they always do.

I was on blue shield ppo.  Requires 2 years hrt, and photos of before.

I had one. I live in the Central Valley so traveling a few hours wasn’t feasible. I did email his office to let them know that and the nurse said a phone call post op was just as fine. If there isn’t any unusual and unexpected things happening that’s abnormal then you should be fine.

I just get pain when I stand up as fluids move.  And when I twist I feel my incisions.
</p>
<p>
But this has been a surprisingly easy recovery
</p>
<p>
Edit: the breasts are.  Jaw is more difficult but I knew it would be

Two years.
</p>
<p>
I had really strong initial growth, but then it stopped.  I might have gotten another cup size over the next three years, but even then it&#39;s not the look I wanted.
</p>
<p>
Large, round breasts really balance out the upper body and I&#39;m very happy with them.
