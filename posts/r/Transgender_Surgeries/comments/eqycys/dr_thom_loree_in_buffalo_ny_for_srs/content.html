Hello i just got back a few days ago from a consultation with Dr Thom Loree and had some questions. It was a long wait to finally get to talk to him appointment was at 2 and i did not see him until around 6:15. When i did finally see him he seemed very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions, the entire conversation took only 30 mins. He said i did not need electrolysis because he would be forming the neo vagina from a part of the skin that did not have hair, but since i already started electrolysis he said itâ€™s okay to finish that up. He also mentioned 90% of his patients receive revision surgeryâ€™s in the future, he explained how he did not see anything wrong with needing this and said i want to make you happy with what you have so approximately 6 month after surgery he would schedule another revision surgery(covered by insurance) to fix any little things. we made an appointment for next month to schedule a surgery date and in the meantime they would submit my letters and information to insurance. I received the call from insurance today regarding the surgery and they accepted the surgery!!!
</p>
<p>
Dr Loree is the only surgeon in network with my insurance (blue cross blue shield of western NY) so in a way iâ€™m kinda stuck. I have tried getting an out of network referral because i was interested in jess ting in NY city but the  referral requires far to much documentation and honesty buffalo is 1 hour away from me and i would rather get this surgery done close to home if the surgeon is competent and does a good job. Everything so far seems to good to be true in a way.
</p>
<p>
So i apologize for all that back story. Iâ€™m just curious if anyone had Dr Loree for SRS and were happy with the results? Does it make sense for a surgeon to say he finds nothing wrong with revisions? No electrolysis necessary?
</p>

I collect information on surgeons and I&#39;ve never heard of him before. He&#39;s probably quite inexperienced.

Lots of surgeons say you don&#39;t need electrolysis, and lots of patients get internal hair.

Thanks for the reply, yes he was completely honest with me and told me his background. He started doing transgender bottom surgeryâ€™s with jess ting in new york city during the mid 90â€™s. He has done approximately 40 surgeryâ€™s, he said all of his patients were very happy with the end results but of course i assume thatâ€™s after the revisions. Beyond this iâ€™m unsure but again i donâ€™t have many options at this point. The one thing i liked is that he worked with jess ting and still is in contact with him.
</p>
<p>
He also said not one of his patients (out of his 40) had any trouble with hair in the vagina so thatâ€™s reassuring but maybe exaggerated? iâ€™m not the greatest at reading people. So i just thought i would ask some questions here.
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much for the information you provided. I know heâ€™s a bit inexperienced. Iâ€™m just so worried that i may not have much of a choice through my insurance.
</p>
<p>
Hugs to you friend: )
</p>
<p>
And if anyone has first hand experience i would love to hear from you please. Thanks so much

Yes i did, the surgery went great. No problems whatsoever and it looks great no regrets. I can provide more detail if you like feel free to DM me. I did have a friend that also used this surgeon and she had some complications and is still dealing with some of them today, however she is getting revision done from another surgeon soon.
