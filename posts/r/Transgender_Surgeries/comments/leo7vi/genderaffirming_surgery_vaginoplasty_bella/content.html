Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
This subreddit was so helpful for me when choosing surgery I dictated some of my thoughts and experience into a note and I hope this is helpful for others I will try to respond to messages as I can.
</p>
<h2>
</h2>
<p>
Day 1 - arrived at the hospital at 5:45 a.m., sat through some paperwork with financial planning. Following that was escorted up onto the second floor in the pack you where my partner was not allowed. This was during the coronavirus pandemic. We said our goodbyes and then I spent about an hour in the PACU as I met various nurses, changed into gowns, and met with the anesthesiology team, a surgical resident, and finally Bella herself. It was around winter and she had a fabulous Christmas sweater on. She was very kind and answered all questions I had. Soon after I met back with the nurses and I got off my cot and walked down to the OR. The OR was somewhat small and I was a little anxious because it looked dank. Also I was walking there. Luckily, the whole team was very friendly and I was ribbing them and making jokes back and forth. The surgical resident was particularly fun to joke with. Soon after they gave me some versed through an IV and I then popped a mask on and within about 20 seconds I was out. I woke back up in the PACU and  didn&#39;t have any nausea or vomiting. They brought me back up to the 7th floor where I got a private room and had access to all my belongings. The hospital is pretty interesting and that it serves both outpatient and impatient care. The 7th floor is a sort of catch-all medical surgical unit. There was great view of the Empire State building and the Chrysler building and my boyfriend visited soon after around 4:00. According to my boyfriend, Bella called during surgery, when wrapping up, and he was assuaged by this, this was around 2:00 p.m. As of writing this I&#39;m feeling good, maybe 3 out of 10 pain, and Bella informed my partner that the results were very symmetrical and deep. He is only able to visit from 4 - 6. We both had to wear a mask the entire time. I was pretty out of it as the night came. Went to sleep around 12 pm.  Great day overall!
</p>
<p>
Day 2 - Woke up at around 6:40, I was sleeping intermittently throughout the night. I don&#39;t know how much I slept because I didn&#39;t have my sleep tracker watch on. Was only woken up a couple times for Heparin injections toradol. I still am in shock that I have I have vagina, etc. The nurses and PCAs have all been so nice. I ate breakfast around 7:00 and was able to eat the whole thing. The nurse unhooked my IV and everything was by mouth today. I then tried standing with the nurse&#39;s help around 9:00 and they told me I did well but I did get orthostatic and needed to lie back down. I did also experience some sharp pains near my rectum/perineal area. Lots of gas and a good amount of urine and blood draining. overall today was pretty uneventful except for the fact that I was able to get up and do what they called &#34;a diva walk&#34; which was just getting on my feet and staying on my feet. I was woken a couple times during the night to be given meds but overall I slept around 5 hours.
</p>
<p>
Day 3 - Woke up around 6:00. I slept about 5 hours. Still off my IV, constantly drinking cups of water. still have to wear a mask inside because of cornavirus even though I got in a negative test.  The constant injections of toradol and Tylenol really helps to bring down inflammation stay pain free. It&#39;s still been difficult being without my boyfriend or any visitors but I&#39;ve been talking on the phone a lot.  I felt very good throughout the day, was able to stand up twice and use the restroom, with healthy bowel movements! I also continued to drink lots of water and binge some Netflix. Overall an easy day and was well prepared to be discharged the following day.
</p>
<p>
Day 4 - All is still good. Occasionally having some spikes of energy in the morning and been feeling more exhausted in the afternoon and evening. It is so important to pace yourself. So important. The attending give me the go ahead and leave today. The social worker met with me and ensured that there was a visiting nurse service that was in coordination with me. I had to speak with them to confirm. They will visit me tomorrow in my apartment. The nurses have been fabulous and well prepared for discharge and discharge teaching. I was discharged around 1:30 after the nurse taught me and my boyfriend had to empty the catheter and take care of the wound vac (which shouldn&#39;t need any maintenance or disposal). I was rolled out of my room and the hospital and was so excited to return back to my apartment. When I got back to the apartment it was pretty difficult to adjust. I would recommend having a grabber to help reach things, also the bed was not as comfortable because it&#39;s on a medical bed so I would advise getting something like a wedge or asking a visiting nurse for one. Make sure that you write your med sounds specifically or use a med app, I use Medisafe and that helped me remember meds. Having someone with you is also really helpful. I wasn&#39;t able to get to sleep till late and I would recommend having some sleep aides with you, like melatonin. I would also recommend having some chuck pads to put under you in case you accidentally use the restroom in the bed, and some wipes on hand. A thermometer and pulse ox would also be good if you want to be extra cautious.
</p>
<p>
Day 5 - today&#39;s recovery has generally been the same as yesterday. Perhaps a little easier. I bought a little tray to eat food off of in bed. I also spent the entire day on the couch instead of bed to change things up. I continued to drink lots of fluids and set up a visit with the visiting nurses tomorrow. I did watch some comedy, watch out, if you laugh too hard it can hurt near the incisions! Overall generally good day.
</p>
<p>
Day 6 and 7 - Recovery has generally been good, no real problems. I visited Dr. Avanessian for a weekly follow-up. She said everything was healing nicely and that I had good depth. I was taught to dilate during the appointment and overall it was not a difficult process, I just think a lot of anticipatory anxiety got to me. The worst part of it all was having the tape ripped off my skin, but they were so explanatory in this that I knew what was coming. Overall the pain was very temporary and the excitement and happiness of seeing my new vagina vastly outweighed any pain. I had a little anatomy lesson from Jim the physician assistant and then I was on my way!
</p>
<p>
Week 2 - Generally pretty nonchalant. I did have some bleeding here and there but overall I felt very good. I found it difficult to keep my steps down because I was so restless. I also like to have a beer every once in awhile so I tried out some non-alcoholic beers which was a fun little celebration. there was a lot of binge watching of Netflix and other movies. Occasionally there was a little bit of pain though that really went down with any pain meds. There is a big misconception out there that dilating can be painful. I was told by Dr Avenessian&#39;s staff that about 99% of people do not experience pain with dilation. I was one of those people. I actually found dilation to be a nice time for self care. I put on some music or podcast twice a day during this week and got to just experience my body. I cannot even put into words the normalcy of euphoria that I felt especially when beginning. It still hasn&#39;t felt like a chore at all. It just felt like time that I&#39;ve got the carve out for myself and just be with myself. One thing to note, after dilating make sure you have a couple of towels underneath you and some paper towels or toilet paper near you because the combination of the lube and metronidazole with a little bit of blood can leak a bit. I generally would shower after this in the mornings just to make a routine of it. Damn did it feel good to shower.
</p>
<p>
Week 3 - Nothing hugely remarkable at week three I did have one small instance of bleeding when dilating but took care of that with some gauze. I eventually got to go home which was really nice.
</p>
<p>
Week 4 - Generally less pain. Feeling good overall. Dilating three times a day actually it&#39;s a great opportunity for some self-care and time alone.

<p>
That is a shock I&#39;m looking forward to in a big way. Congratulations! Glad you&#39;re having such a good time dilating. So many people describe it like it&#39;s a nightmare, but then other people barely mention it, so we end up hearing mostly from the people who think of it as a nightmare. Thanks for sharing your perspective.

I didn&#39;t even look but if you are comfy putting pics up at some point, I look forward to seeing more of her results. Especially since someone here said she recently made a technical change to better the appearance of the vulva.

Thank you for sharing your experiences! So glad you’re recovery has been going generally well for you!
</p>
<p>
Can I ask if you got the full PPT w/ Dr. Avanessian or did you get a hybrid of PI and PPT?
</p>
<p>
I’m sure there’s still a lot of swelling, but how do you feel about her aesthetic abilities?
</p>
<p>
Debating whether I should book a consult w/ her in addition to Dr. Bluebond-Langner.
</p>
<p>
Thanks I’m advance for answering!

I went through PI. Underwent a method using the tunica vaginalis for supposed mucosal lubrication (though the jury is out).
</p>
<p>
I think her aesthetic abilities are amazing! Am just so impressed, I have a vagina that looks very symmetrical, has good depth, and retained all sensation. Lots of swelling still.
</p>
<p>
Either surgeon will be great - I went with Bella in the end but you really can&#39;t go wrong between the two.

Thank you so much for responding!
</p>
<p>
What is the tunica vaginalis? I hope it ends up working successfully for you!
</p>
<p>
So good to hear about her aesthetic and surgical capabilities! I bet your final results are going to be amazing! I can’t wait to be able to put on any clothes I want and not have to worry about tucking (but a part of me also feels like that’s a selfish/non vital reason for getting GCS).
</p>
<p>
It sounds like it would definitely be a good idea to meet with both of them.

I would meet with both for sure. What&#39;s the harm there? Shop around.
</p>
<p>
Tunica is when they use part of the scrotum to create a more lubricated environment. Unsure if it works. Also unsure if peritoneal method really works. Both are the same tissue structure. Bella goes with tunica to not add another whole organ system to the surgical mix. I agree with her, why go with a GI surgery if you don&#39;t need it?

Thanks for the info! I’ll go ahead and book a consultation w/ Bella as well so I can see which iteration will be the best for me. It’s good to hear the tunica has the same benefits as the peritoneum w/o the need to have GI surgery as well.

Reading posts like this are really encouraging, and are reassuring that Dr. Avanessian is the right choice.  I have a consult this summer.  Would you mind if I DM you about  your experience leading up to your surgery date?

Your timing of this post couldn&#39;t be better. I have my surgery with her in just 2 weeks, unless it ends up getting cancelled due to a complication from a previous surgery... I&#39;m trying my damnedest to save it. But if I do get to proceed, this is super useful information!
</p>
<p>
When you were in the hospital, did they make you wear a mask 24/7, or just when you had a visitor?

Congratulations!!! They did want me to wear a mask a lot of the time but were a little inconsistent especially given the fact that everyone is tested prior. I kept a mask with me a lot of the time.

Congrats! I just had mine with Dr Pang on the 1st. Everyone at Mt Sinai has been so sweet and kind. Like I&#39;ve never met such nice nurses and staff in my life. So I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do great! Best of luck &lt;3

I&#39;m going to be having surgery there coming up here, and have a couple questions if you don&#39;t mind.  You mentioned financial paperwork before surgery - what sort?  I&#39;m pretty (seemingly irrationally) anxious about insurance surprises so I&#39;m just curious how all that&#39;s handled.  Also, what is mobility like getting to your non-hospital room on day 4? - seems so early to be moving around!  thanks for any info

Mobility then was not too bad. I was definitely difficult to get around due to the wound VAC but I may do I could not carry anything and just moved very slowly but I did not need a wheelchair or a cane or walker when I was at the actual hotel.

As for the financial paperwork, I don&#39;t really recall what it was about but it seemed to be more applicable to in-state residents and name changes than anything. I think it was just a verification of some insurance documents but that should happen long before by there social workers and financial coordinators. If you have any questions about finances prior to the surgery and are already waiting for it just email Karen. You will get her number and email the day you get your surgical appointment and meet with her.
