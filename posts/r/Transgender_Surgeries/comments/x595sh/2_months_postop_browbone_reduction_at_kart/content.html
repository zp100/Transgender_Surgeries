It costed 7k usd and the surgeon is Dr. Kim Nam-bok. I believe he is the only surgeon at K-art. He does also offer more FFS options other than just browbone, but I only got browbone reduction from him.

Here is a
<a href="https://www.k-artps.com/en/" rel="nofollow">link.</a>
I used KakaoTalk to contact them.
</p>
<p>
For me, I didn&#39;t wait too long, we started talking in May and I had a surgery date by June. I have heard that he might be more busy lately, I remember that he said that the next open date might be in October?
</p>
<p>
Yes there is an English translator on site, but the nurses can understand basic English as well. Also the doctor speaks English really well, so there isn&#39;t a need for a translator when consulting with him in person.

How did you find them, and what other surgeons did you look at?

I believe I found them on Purseforum? I don&#39;t remember specifically where though.
</p>
<p>
I also looked at facial team, and id hospital.

Hey everyone, first post here. I got browbone reduction on July 4. And its about 2 months since then and I wanted to share this update on the progress so far.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s some additional info:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I was only under local anesthesia for the majority of the surgery (You do go under for a bit during the beginning of the surgery). He does offer the option of full anesthesia I believe, but it would cost extra.
</li>
<li>
I had a large-ish sinus cavity so he had fractured the bone and shaped it and set it back.
</li>
<li>
The surgery was done using an endoscope so there is less scaring in general, as most other browbone reduction surgeries have a long incision in the hairline, while the endoscopic incisions are 5 small incisions in the hairline.
</li>
<li>
There is an onsite translator and also she is very kind as well. Dr. Kim also can speak English well, so there is no need to hire a translator or anything.
</li>
<li>
Surgery was done in one day and I was driven back to my hotel by the doctor himself later that day.
</li>
<li>
Follow up care has been really good, they are very responsive and quick to answer any questions I had.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
</p>

No, they donâ€™t do type 3. They use rasping to make the frontal sinus bone as thin as paper and then press inward to create a fracture, similar to an eggshell. Not sure about the safety of this procedure.
