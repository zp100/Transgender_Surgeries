I&#39;ve come to the realization I&#39;m not super happy with my surgery with Dr Z. My nostrils are irregular shaped with my septum poking out of one of side. He gave me the 80s pixy nose which just doesnt fit my face and I still have noticeable scars around my nose as well. My hairline may be lowered but its irregularly sharp. If my hair is up is a dead giveaway therefore I never put my hair up which sucks. My chin looked good after surgery but eventually healed so that it now blends in with my jaw making my lower face just as masculine as before. My cheek fat grafts completely dissapeared. Literally 100% it did nothing in the long run so my face looks really long and gaunt. I have cheek implants that I&#39;m okay with but without fat grafts it just bugs me so much. My lip lift didnt do much after healing either. Maybe it made a difference but I cant tell anymore. I have this weird patch of swollen material under my jaw that looks like fat but I can tell it&#39;s not. I&#39;m 14 months post op btw. I feel like Dr Z does a generic all in one package that was absolutely not tailored to my face at all and I&#39;m eventually going back to get 1 revision for free (out of the 5 I need) and some free fat grafts. I&#39;ll be doing this hopefully within the next year and then I&#39;ll eventually have another surgeon with more precision fix everything else.
</p>
<p>
I pass 100% of the time. I have long hair. Im 5&#39;10&#34;. I dress like a boy because I just dont have anything resembling a decent wardrobe after transitioning for nearly 3 years so I wear my old boy stuff. My shoulders are broader, I&#39;m a 36B most likely going be a C cup if they keep growing. I dont have a ton of factors in my favor for passability but I have a great voice and my face passes enough that people never question. I also never wear makeup.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not humblebragging or anything I&#39;m just painting a picture to show he helped me consistently pass but I&#39;m still in this weird territory of scars, masculinity, and passability. I honestly hate my face a bit but it&#39;s better than before. I&#39;ve been in contact with him multiple times about my weird healing and concerns and he just keeps brushing me off. Telling me I look like a goddess and he sees nothing wrong while I clearly have a fucked up nose, visible scars, and consistent swelling a year post op. He told me to wait until 16months post op but I think hes gonna brush me off when that time comes. I just have a feeling.
</p>
<p>
Anybody know a good surgeon that has a better attention to detail per the individual and wont just give me &#34;the works&#34;? Facial team maybe? I&#39;m at a loss.

Oof. I&#39;m so sorry. I made the mistake of assuming he was one of the best and I&#39;m pretty disappointed by it.   Like I said I&#39;m 14 months post op but he thinks another 4 months will make a big difference and I just dont believe it. I&#39;m gonna have him fix my chin and have a specialist redo my nose. Not only is my septum highly visible on one side but I started randomly leaking a clear watery substance all the time so I&#39;m always sniffling. How bad is the BA? I&#39;m worried because I was actually considering going to him for BA.

Yeah I’m redoing my chin, nose and forhead. Chin implant isn’t tea. My face looks longer then it was before. My forehead looks more noticeable then it was cause he set my nose back behind my forehead. I gave him pictures of my nose and initially it looked real great but then the tip wasn’t supported enough and I have a beak deformity. he said he doesn’t no how to fix it. Actually what he said was no doctor can fix it. I found a doctor the doctor was confused on why Dr.Z didn’t uses cartliedge to support my nose tip after seeing it in the first place. Don’t get me start on my boobs he completely f’d me up. I’m 4 months. Like I can tell the general issues pretty easily. time isn’t going to change much. Waiting isn’t going to fix symmastia or make my chin shorter.

The problem is he isn’t skilled enough to do complicated revisions and his methods are a lot older then what is used currently so if he makes a mistake your f’d and will have to pay a completely new doctor to fix. In that standard alone he’s not a good doctor and I wish I’d known that before going to him.

The ba is bad I’m overly depressed and just want the implants out. he pressured me into going to big even after requesting I wanted stalling because I’ve been told of what issues happen going to big to soon. pretty much every issue that’s on the internet about what happens when you go to big is happening to me. My breast implants all like pinballs bouncing around my chest. It’s terrible and I have a lot of physical pain because of it.

The other frustrating thing is that I can feel the cheek implants like the edge of them poking off my cheek bone

I&#39;d prefer not to risk it until after I get my free revision and fat grafts. Maybe I&#39;ll set up an imgur and block out my face later. Well see.

How would posting a pic of your face affect revision? You didnt have revision yet post FFS?

Sorry you had a bad experience.  I went to him and am happy with what he has done.  My fat grafting lasted well.  In fact quite a bit better than fillers which my face seems to just eat.  But then I’m middle aged and that is part of the equation for us Gen X folks.

Yea my fat grafts reabsorbed within 6 months. I want the Japanese method done where they inject stem cells that apparently helps the grafts stick. And he made me pass finally.. but the scars, hairline, grafts, nose, and chin/jaw all need revised. I&#39;ll find someone else to do the nose and chin/jaw and just start saving for hair transplants Nd laser for my scars. I&#39;m not broken, just need some expensive maintenance.

I kind of look at it as a lifestyle, so I’ll need more maintainence down the line.   Probably the only thing I’ll do is another face lift down the line (my family tends to jowel) and I need to redo my implants I suppose at some point.  They are 17 now,lol.

No facelift. Check out profound RF and thank me later lol. Also Dr z does his neck left during the jaw swelling period which is apparently not good.

If you&#39;d like people to find this review in the future you should put the doctors name in it somewhere. I don&#39;t think google is going to give a good result like this.

Totally feel what you’re going through and I know prospective people that are looking for surgeons will be scrutinizing every word in this thread. Personally I was happy with my result and I think it’s so important to stress that you need to go into a consultation having some sort of idea what you’re looking for. A surgeon might not be so good at recommending things for your face, so if you don’t want to end up in a situation where you think something you had done didn’t match, it’s also your responsibility to make that assessment before the surgery because as the patient you have a degree of latitude with respect to what things you want done, to what extent, and like what. Find pictures of people with similar face shapes, zero in on specific things you want.
</p>
<p>
Again, full sympathy to OP and I hope you find a solution.

Idk. It&#39;s pretty hard for me, a non professional, to know what will look good on my face. He gave me a list of things he&#39;d do but theres no way of knowing how it would look on me me. I&#39;m mostly over it and recognize I still have more to do and to be patient. I&#39;ll find someone to correct it later.

Aww, I&#39;m sorry this was your experience. I had my nose and cheeks done by Dr. Z 3 years ago and I think he did pretty good work. I will tell you that I hated my nose for the first 6 months because the swelling made it look idiotic...
