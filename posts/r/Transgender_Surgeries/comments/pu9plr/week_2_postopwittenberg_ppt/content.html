Hi guys! Sorry I haven&#39;t made a post since my first post, have been kindve out of it mentally. But I&#39;m off the pain meds and feeling productive again :).
</p>
<p>
Just had my second post op yesterday, and Wittenberg talked to me and told me I&#39;m doing AMAZING. Very little swelling, zero bruising and zero separation apparently (could still happen in the next week, I&#39;m worried about that swollen side of the labia) so FREAKIN AWESOME.
</p>
<p>
Quick recap, recovery has been easy from a genital pain perspective, but terrible from both gas pain from the laparoscopic robot and extreme discomfort from crappy airbnb pillows in concert with having an icepack in between my legs 24/7 which makes it impossible to sleep on my side how I prefer. First week was horrible with the gas plus the pain meds, so constipated, when I first started dilating, I would start crapping reflexively when I got in dilation position, it was awful.
</p>
<p>
1st postop was absolutely horrible, getting packing out was one of the most painful and harrowing things that&#39;s ever happened to me. It feels like a string is being pulled out of you. Except the string is tearing out your insides on the way out. Then RIGHT after that they pumped my bladder full of saline and pulled the catheter which HURRRT. But I was in shock from the packing removal so meh. I was able to pee immediately which was great!
</p>
<p>
Dilating at first was horrible, it was painful for me for the first week due to extreme anxiety and my mom helping me as opposed to me doing it on my own. Thought I wouldn&#39;t be able to keep doing it, thought I&#39;d just drop the dilations cause I mentally couldnt handle it. But I was able to, now I am following the dilations schedule to a T and I&#39;m much more comfortable dilating now at the second week. Much less blood too.
</p>
<p>
Feel great. :). Can&#39;t wait to go home next Wednesday.

I wouldn&#39;t just be concerned about the swollen labia minora but both. The swelling alone isn&#39;t an issue but you should ask him about the necrosis that is occuring there.

I don&#39;t think its necrosis or my surgeon would&#39;ve pointed it out, just had a post op yesterday with her, she inspected it inside and out? She said the labia should return to normal color within the  next few weeks. But I&#39;ll ask to make doubly sure over their messaging app tomorrow. And doesn&#39;t necrosis have a bad smell? And other signs?

It is black because the blood flow isn&#39;t there and leads to tissue death. It is necrosis and she kinda confirmed it. It can be on the surface only in which case it wouldn&#39;t be a big deal. If you are lucky it returns to normal color, if you&#39;re slightly less lucky just the skin will shed and regrow. If it&#39;s bad (It does not look super bad) parts of it could fall off.

Oh okay, I assume that means she thinks its just surface necrosis or minor necrosis? And at least from what I&#39;ve seen, how black it gets matters? As of right now its not black black, but more of a brownish blackish light blackish. When I&#39;ve seen examples in the past they seem a bit more BLACK BLACK. Idk. Thank u for pointing it out anyway, I will def double check w surgeon and see what to watch out for and if theres anything I can do to help it. She probably just didn&#39;t use the word necrosis but made note of it. Lol, now I have anxiety for really bad necrosis :(, GOTTA HAVE HAPPY THOUGHTS!!!

I am sorry for that anxiety but I don&#39;t like to pretty paint stuff. Yes from how it reads that is what she thinks. It sure is no major necrosis.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t drink, don&#39;t smoke and don&#39;t sit on it directly too much. That is all rather general advice.

Yeah, so I asked and they said its hard to tell at this point, there may be a BIT of necrosis, it may regain color, and/or some may slough off, but all I can do is wait. Doesn&#39;t change anything I&#39;m supposed to do recovery wise.
</p>
<p>
EDIT:Wittenberg herself responded a little later and said it is NOT currently necrosis, but it is the surface layer of skin sloughing off due to swelling, akin to skinning your knee after falling off a bike. Not actual necrotic tissue apparently.
