Well, I had my first &#34;marathon&#34; mass clearance GRS prep electrolysis session there yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Does it hurt? You have no idea. First of all, let me say that I&#39;m the biggest wuss with the lowest pain threshold on the planet, so take that into major consideration with my experience... I was cussing, crying, levitating my body up into the air via pure telekinesis, brainwaves, &#34;Use The Force, Luke&#34; whatever. It hurt. A lot. I almost want to compare it to sticking my dick into a deep fryer set at proper temperature for onion rings.
</p>
<p>
And that was just getting the lidocaine injections. Lidocaine being injected into your junk just subdermally feels like Liquid Plumber mixed with 100 octane gasoline, that&#39;s already ignited, and mixed with napalm, and the liquid mixture was just freshly drained from the core of a nuclear reactor where it was being used as coolant. I&#39;m understating this so I won&#39;t frighten those of you who might be a little squeamish about pain..... lol! Oh my God it hurt, but after a little while things do go numb, but lidocaine is very short acting, it starts wearing off in about 35-40 minutes, And then you need to get re-injected.
</p>
<p>
The electrolysis down there does hurt, and without the lidocaine injections I don&#39;t think I could&#39;ve handled it. I did zero preparation before showing up for my appointment, such as using a topical lidocaine appliction beforehand and wrapping with plastic film /saran wrap, etc. I learned my lesson, Next time I&#39;m definitely going to &#34;pre-numb&#34; the area prior to the appointment to lessen the impact of the lidocaine injections.
</p>
<p>
Now about the electrolysis itself. My electrologist was amazing. I&#39;m a newbie, beginner electrologist myself so I&#39;m a little familiar with the process too. She was about 10,000 times faster than me. I was astounded with her speed and proficiency..... and tolerance and understanding of my crybaby fits and outbursts. If I was her, I would&#39;ve slapped me silly and told me to shut up and quit overreacting.
</p>
<p>
I was able to drive the 2 hours back home no problem, but yes I was hurting and swollen by the time I got home. Thankfully I had some 4%lidocaine and aloe + vitamin E gel &#34;burn gel&#34; stuff at home, plus was sent away with some zinc oxide ointment with my after care instructions. I had a small hematoma at one of the lidocaine injection sites on side of the shaft. Now 24 hours later, I&#39;m doing fine, virtually no swelling or irritation left at all. Kinda amazed at how much hair is now gone. It&#39;s quite astonishing how much was removed, but I&#39;m also a mutant neandertal werewolf sasquatch too so there&#39;s still plenty left to go, and I&#39;ll be getting monthly sessions for the next 6-7 months then we&#39;ll see if that is going to suffice for my GRS surgeon who will still be doing a follicle scrape anyway, but the more hair removed via electrolysis means the follicle scrape can be less intensive and less brutal, which will undoubtedly be conducive to faster healing since scraped skin tissue definitely adds to what has to heal up after surgery.
</p>
<p>
Am I looking forward to my next electrolysis session at E3K? I sheepishly answer &#34;Yes&#34; but I&#39;m definitely gonna pre-numb first before the 2 hour drive to Dallas. I learned my lesson, lol!
</p>
<p>
Is E3K worth the money? OMG Yes! The speed and proficiency of my electrologist was amazing. I was blown away by her dexterity and proficiency. I hope someday I can be at least 25% as good of an electrologist as her before I get so old my hands shake too badly and my eyesight goes completely to hell in a handbasket.
</p>
<p>
I highly recommend E3K but if you&#39;re a low pain threshold crybaby like me, then be forewarned and do your homework and prepare yourself best you can before showing up, because like it or not.... electrolysis hurts, and getting it done to your junk.... well the word &#34;hurts&#34; is very misleading. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a word in the English language that accurately describes it sufficiently. I&#39;m going to record my facial expressions and screams/crying/etc next time with my phone. I wish I would&#39;ve done it yesterday, it&#39;d be funny as hell to watch and show to friends afterwards while drinking. Lol!

I got two full face clearings there. honestly was worth is. but I will say, it was some of the most pain ive ever experienced. The electrolysis wasnt bad, but god damn those lidocane shots, which you get quite a lot during a 7 hour session, were absolutely agonizing. Hard to explain. feels like someone injecting lava into your face pushing the needle in and out as it fills a large area. not for the faint of heart. Girl be proud of your self, that shit hurts lol ;)

Lava. That&#39;s very descriptive indeed. Now imagine lava being injected into your shaft, nutsack, and worst of all, taint just in front of your anus. The latter is what causes spontaneous telekinesis where your whole body rises up into the air of the table just from the  pain alone .... reminiscent of like Luke Skywalker trying to use brainwaves/TheForce to lift his spacecraft up out of the swamp where he first met Yoda.

What might be your opinion about applying Aspercreme/Lidocaine and taking Tylenol just prior to my genital electrolysis appointment?

Topical salicylates would be a
<em>
very bad idea
</em>
. Topical lidocaine is a very good idea, in fact there are a lot of brands of topical lidocaine gels and creams marketed especially for use prior to electrolysis and/or tattooing. You might want to ask your electrologist beforehand if they recommend one type or brand, or just Google for that info, there&#39;s a ton of info available out on the web.

Awe come on... try it, you&#39;ll like it. Next thing you know, you&#39;ll be buying lots of leather outfits, spiked chokers and bracelets, stiletto heel shoes, scary sex toys, getting lots of tattoos, making an account and hanging out on the FetLife website forums, etc.
</p>
<p>
Hahaha! just kidding... I don&#39;t have a single tattoo, own zero scary sex toys, own one spikey black leather punk rock choker bought from Amazon, don&#39;t own a single pair of stiletto heels, and I plead the 5th about having a FetLife logon account (ok, I&#39;ve got an alter-ego on Fetlife... and Twitter, and attended TEA2018 and TEA2019, only because I have friends who are stars in the trans porn biz).

Wow my electrologist won’t allow any numbing cream etc as she wants me to tell her if it’s painful!!! It’s fine, I think I could experience childbirth (wishful thinking) 🤪😷

The lidocaine that E3K uses also has epinephrine in it. So it gives you a kick of adrenaline and kind of sets off a fight or flight response. Whenever I get my first shots of a session, I usually can&#39;t keep my eyes closed very well. They twitch for about 10-15 minutes.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s true. They told me it&#39;s common people can&#39;t sit still after injections because of it.

Did you get a full clearing? How many hours did it take?
</p>
<p>
I have had a few facial clearings at E3K and want to start going for bottom stuff too, but I know for sure I won’t be able to handle face and crotch at the same time. Plus I fly to Dallas for it...so the less time I spend there, the cheaper.

There&#39;s no such thing really as a &#34;full clearing&#34;. I got a mass clearance which was a large number of follicles but by no means &#34;full&#34; as it&#39;s going to take many of these sessions. I guess I was there for about 3 hours. That&#39;s all she wanted to do for my very first session. She didn&#39;t want to totally kill me the first time or leave me crippled alterwards since I had a 2 hour drive to get home and my car is a stick shift so I still have to be able to work the clutch pedal.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;d stay for a couple days, you could do face one day and crotch the next. Even as much of a wuss as I am, I could probably handle that just fine.

A full clearing is when they zap all the hairs in the area you’re getting done. They can run out. Your first session almost always takes the longest.

i HIGHLY recommend asking for &#34;blend&#34; electrolysis. it hurts a lot less overall because the pain is spread out over 10 seconds, and pulling the hairs isn&#39;t so bad. You can also ask them to adjust the intensity. I use topical lidocaine (5%) and 3 ibuprofen and yeah some spots hurt but mostly I can take 3 hours. Usually by the end the ibuprofen is wearing off. Halfway through we stop to re-apply lidocaine. My Electrologist is another trans-woman who has been through the surgery and is really cognizant to my pain.

Not gonna risk taking any ibuprofen with this darn coronavirus thing going on right now. Ibuprofen increases the number of ACE-2 receptors on the surfaces of cell membranes, especially lung tissue cells, and the primary way this virus invades cells to hijack it for use as a replication host is via exploiting the ACE-2 receptors as portals of entry. So it&#39;s probably a bad idea to be tossing out extra &#34;welcome mats&#34; for COVID-19, I&#39;d think.
</p>
<p>
The machine she uses does employ blend... and she adjusted it for my skin/follicles and the speed she wanted to work at. The zapped hairs pulled easily from the follicles, indicated the follicles had been cooked just the right amount. 24 hours later, I had no problems with soreness, inflammation, &#34;overcooked&#34; follicles, etc. Just a couple small hematomas from the lidocaine injection spots. I think my electrologist knows exactly what she was doing and I&#39;m not gonna interfere with her technique at all, except for one slight thing... I don&#39;t particularly care for the brand of injection needles she used, and didn&#39;t install a fresh injecting needle after drawing the lido thru the rubber vial cap (used a fresh needle at the beginning of the session) and poking the needle thru the cap really buggers up the sharpness of the tip... and a dull, messed up needle tip hurts a lot more because it kinda tears the skin going in, whereas a fresh new needle tip slides right into the skin with much less trauma and pain. If you look at the before/after of a hypodermic needle with a microscope after poking it thru the rubber vial cap to draw the liquid into the syringe, you&#39;ll easily see how that formerly perfect angled slice of a new needle tip gets all janked up badly and looks like a ragged, jagged torture instrument afterwards that&#39;s meant to shred flesh for max damage. So, since she was using the same 27 gauge x 1.25&#34; needles as I use for injecting my hormones and have a large supply on hand.... I&#39;m going to bring her a bunch of my new NiPro brand premium needles of the same size, and i also have a whole box full of really super smooth operating Covidien Monoject 3ml luer-lock syringes that I ordered by mistake, and I&#39;ll give her some of those too for use on me  since the brand of syringe she used is another one that I happen to have a bunch of also, and it&#39;s not a premium brand... it&#39;s kinda notorious for being &#34;herky-jerky&#34; to operate smoothly and I noticed she had to press really hard on the plunger to get it moving, and it would suddenly inject a big burst of lidocaine at the very beginning, which I could really feel intensely.

I read that to about ibuprofen on
<a href="/r/medicine" rel="nofollow">/r/medicine</a>
or
<a href="/r/Coronavirus" rel="nofollow">/r/Coronavirus</a>
but it’s uncomfirmed and the cdc still recommends treating COVID19 fevers with over the counter medicine. But you do you.

This thread covers a lot of the debate over the ace 2 receptor-

Yeah, the jury&#39;s still out about whether ibuprofen may exacerbate this virus, but the theory is plausible and there&#39;s been enough anecdotal reports associating ibuprofen use early in the infection stages leading to worse pneumonia and longer, more difficult recovery time... and some deaths too. Acetaminophen doesn&#39;t aggrivate this virus and that&#39;s been shown to hold true , again by a lot of anecdotal reports, but until a peer reviewed double blind study establishes one way or the other, I&#39;d rather err on the side of abundant caution WRT ibuprofen or other NSAIDs.

I got 5% from Mexico. Which part hurts? Pulling the hair out or the zap? If that zap hurts but the hair comes out easily, have them lower the power a bit. If it’s vice versa, have them increase the strength of the zap. The blend version is not a quick zap. It’s a slow burn then a pluck and I feel spreads out the pain so it’s less but lasts longer.

The last zap is too tough handle.  It&#39;s more like increased pulses with the last one being the worst.   Electrologist says if she reduces below a level 6, it will take 20-40 years.  It is a blend Apilus ..
</p>
<p>
Maybe I will have to go lower or put the 4%lidocaine on 20 minutes before and took two Ibuprofen an hour before too. Or try another Electrologist.

you can put the lidocaine on and then wrap your junk in seran wrap. The longer it stays wet/most and doesn&#39;t get soaked up in your clothes, the better. I dunno how long you go for, but my electrologist let&#39;s me re-apply after an hour or so. She&#39;s also transgender herself and has been through this whole process including the surgery. So she gets it.

I see.  That&#39;s good. My Electrologist I think does more laser, so I may have to switch. Thanks 😊

By far, hands down, the best descriptive account of genital electrolysis I’ve read. You, Ma’am, are without doubt a past-master of the written word❣️ I have 3-hour appointments scheduled with the Papillon Center (unfortunately but understandably, was called last week and notified that they cancelled all their April appointments) and understand Dr. McGinn administers the lidocaine injections. I’ve read all the comments here and will formulate/initiate defensive countermeasures in anticipation of the onslaught of uncontrollable nerve stimulation. Based on your clearly articulated account I’ve determined I need to be a quick study of the Vulcan Mind Meld technique to handle the mental aspects of what I’m about to willfully submit myself to. God help me . . . ❣️ 🤗’s and Thanks for the smile from reading this, OMG . . .

Am also a [studying (put on hold bc of covid)] electrologist. When you say crotch hair, are you talking about just on the balls/shaft, or do you also mean bikini line area and a bit surrounding?

Everywhere that&#39;s outside that will become inside needs the hair removed as much as is feasibly possible. Having hair growing inside your brand new hoo-haw is supposedly a whole new kind of hell, to avoid at all costs. Here&#39;s a template from Dr. Crane&#39;s website. Other surgeons use a very similar template.

I.. I was considering electrolysis for a hot minute, even with a &#34;I will Faint&#34; fear of needles, as it is supposed to be better for long term results than laser and I&#39;m also a hairy Sheepsquatch/wolf-human hybrid thing, but now I&#39;m like, very second guessing it.

No pain, no gain. I was a bigger needlephobe than you... now I self inject my hormones. It&#39;s not really that big of a deal to do I.M. injections into your own upper buttock/hip for dorsal gluteus shots, pain is comparable to a mosquito bite... BUT, the injections of lidocaine into the &#34;junk&#34; area redefines the word pain a wee tiny bit. But it&#39;s temporary, that pain does go away. The pain of dysphoria doesn&#39;t go away, it&#39;ll last a lifetime and no amount of alcohol, drugs, unhealthy behaviors.... except proper transitioning meds/hormones/treatments fix it. I waited literally a half a freakin&#39; century to properly address my issues and now that I am doing this, it&#39;s a game changer. Wish I could go back in time and kick my younger self in the ass to have started this much younger and earlier, but that&#39;s another story.
</p>
<p>
Laser will only reduce hair temporarily. It might kill off some of the follicles, but 2 years of laser on my facial hair is all but negated a year after my last laser treatment.
</p>
<p>
For GRS, since skin that&#39;s outside now will become inside afterwards, removing the pubes is mandatory. The last thing in the world you want is hair growing inside your new hoo-haw. Even though the surgeons will do a &#34;follicle scrape&#34; on that skin at surgery time, the less they have to do, the faster and less painful the healing will be, thus this is a mandatory part of the process.... just have to deal with it. So, if you want the results that all of us do, just toughen up and do it. Believe me you can. And just just 3 days later, I&#39;m really liking the results of just that first session. All my pain is gone, there&#39;s just a little dark spot left from the hematoma on the side of the tubular unit, and the amount of hairs now gone is boggling my mind.
</p>
<p>
Do it.

OMG..... I was there on Monday and Tuesday. I had a full face and South Pole clearing. I heard screaming in the other room. That might have been you?  The shots were tough but then it was a breeze. My face was so swollen I didn’t recognize myself. Happy I did it though.

Late in the afternoon until closing time on Monday.... screaming including the seven words George Carlin said you can&#39;t say on television?????
</p>
<p>
Sheepishly raising my hand. That would&#39;ve been me, exhibiting my finest bravery and stoicism, lol!
</p>
<p>
I learned my lesson about not doing anything to pre-numb before getting there... had a bunch of disruptions before my drive down to the metroplex including harassment by an new transphobic pharmacy employee when I went to pick up my HRT refill, getting my car stuck in axle-deep mud in my driveway despite being an AWD Audi Quattro and realizing I&#39;d left my phone at the Walmart pharmacy and fortunately my neighbor pulled my car out of the mud with his pickup, so it was almost 4pm before I got to E3K, driving waaaaaay above the speed limit and thought I was gonna get pulled over by DPS trooper who turned around and followed me closely for over a mile before suddenly U-turning and going after somebody else on going the other way on 287..... I was probably going close to 105 when I first got his attention, and fortunately he probably didn&#39;t get a good lock on my speed with his moving radar and by the time he was behind me I was driving like a good little girl. So by the time I got to Lewisville my nerves were kinda frazzled anyway and it probably didn&#39;t help that I caved into the urge and smoked a cigarette in my car driving down I35 just before turning off the exit in Lewisville.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, after the shots, the electrolysis itself wasn&#39;t too terrible, but like the earlier reference to the shots being like getting Lava injected, that&#39;s a damn good descriptive analogy.
</p>
<p>
Next day, the inflammation was pretty intense but tolerable. I stayed in bed all day though.
</p>
<p>
So, what was going thru your mind hearing me screaming? That had to be quite entertaining. I wish now I would&#39;ve recorded myself with my phone. It&#39;d be funny as hell to hear now, and play back to my friends while drinking. I&#39;ve got a warped sense of humor sometimes, but it helps me cope. Lol!
</p>
<p>
Next clearing session, I&#39;m definitely gonna do some pre-numbing, and I may or may not have some hydrocodones left over from my boob job surgery.

Honestly, I was laughing because I knew what you were going through. Me and the other girls were giggling and were feeling for you. I’m not a screamer but I did squirm a bit on the South Pole clearing. They save the best for last. I had to sit there knowing that the needle was get closer to the hot spot. Horrible anxiety. Now I can’t wait for my next appointment.....lol.

Ask your doctor to prescribe you EMLA cream. It’s lidocaine/prilocaine combination. If you apply this to your genitals and cover with plastic wrap about an hour before your appointment you won’t feel anything during the lidocaine injections. The numbness lasts for about 30 min to an hour after the cream is wiped off.

There are better topical preparations than EMLA that are even available without a prescription. EMLA is typically 2.5% Lidocaine and 2.5% Prilocaine (which starts slower and lasts longer than Lidocaine).
</p>
<p>
Numbskin Plus is just Lidocaine, but it&#39;s 10.5%. That&#39;s twice the US limit for OTC Lidocaine (and 4X what EMLA has). I&#39;m not sure how they get around the 5% limit, but it&#39;s made in South Korea. There are several compounding pharmacies will sell you &#34;BLT&#34; cream which is Benzocaine 25%, Lidocaine 5%, and Tetracaine 2%. That lasts much longer than Lidocaine alone.

There are a few &#34;bootleg&#34; sources to get over 5% lidocaine numbing gel. I actually have some 8% and some 10% purchased off a gray market website, likely made in China. The hazard is getting too much lidocaine absorbed systemically and ending up with toxic lidocaine overdose symptoms. The 8% is slightly better performing than OTC 5% and I can&#39;t really tell much difference between the 10% and the 8%. Touching a very very tiny bit of it to the tip of your tongue to see if you can detect a difference between 5, 8, and 10% you can really tell there is a difference since the tongue numbing effect makes a very sensitive improvised &#34;test instrument&#34;. Don&#39;t try that with more than a pinpoint spec of the gel or you&#39;ll be sorry for about the next 45-60 minutes. I&#39;m tempted to mix the 10% stuff I have in 50/50 with some 5% and end up with a supply of approx 7.5% gel. probably won&#39;t buy any more of it wither, it was kinda pricey. I haven&#39;t been able to find the 8% stuff anymore.
</p>
<p>
Next appointment I definitely want to glom on at least some 5% and wrap it up with saran wrap. Logistics problem is that I have a 2 hour drive from my home to Dallas (Lewisville actually) and you&#39;re supposed to pre-apply numbing cream/gel only about an hour before the appointment. I dunno if I, visibly trans, really want to pull into a parking lot anywhere near Decatur, TX and sit in my car in broad daylight filling my panties up with lido gel/cream and wrapping my junk with plastic wrap..... might attract the kind of audience I&#39;d rather not be attracting, lol!

See if your electrologist will let you arrive an hour early and apply in their restroom. That&#39;s what I do.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve tried mixing my BLT with the Numbskin Plus, but I really don&#39;t see much difference.
</p>
<p>
My problem isn&#39;t initial numbing, it&#39;s the fact that I
<strong>
clear
</strong>
it from my system fast. I&#39;m to the point where I&#39;m covered in 3 or 4 pieces of saran wrap and have my tech pull off a piece at a time. I look like a mummy (and it&#39;s all over my face, neck, and chest so it&#39;s pretty visible).

Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I might try that BLT.  I can barely stand 15 min. I took 2 Advils and 4% lidocaine, but it hurt just as bad as my first session with blend Apilus ..may there is better equipment out there.....any advice would be great.

Hello, fellow DFWer, thanks for sharing your experience. I&#39;ll probably get electrolysis at least on the face in the somewhat near future.  It&#39;s nice to know that you&#39;ve found a good place for the procedure!

E3K has a steller reputation in the electrolysis business... especially renowned for doing large-scale work on a clientele base with a large percentage of transfeminine clients, in fact they cater especially to us... we probably make up 50% or more of their business. I&#39;m a rank beginner newbie electrologist in training myself, and have done some work on myself.... arms, eyebrows and face. The latter is not easy to do on yourself, even with a good, large magnifying mirror and a day when you&#39;ve got especially steady hands. The flinch reflex is difficult to overcome, so I&#39;ll probably be getting some of that work done at E3K as well. I thought I might have been able to get to see how watching a pro do it on me, that I might learn thru &#34;osmosis&#34; something to help my technique improve a little faster too, but quickly forgot all about that... She was so good, proficient, and blazingly fast that the little I could observe just kinda boggled my mind. I&#39;m still glacially slow with my electrolysis skills this early in my training, then ai also had to spend a great deal of the session&#39;s time with my eyes closed, wincing from the pain and not even wanting to look at the pinpoint sources where that pain was traumatically originating at... lol! Yeah I&#39;m laughing about it and at myself now, but I was the most pathetic crybaby when it was happening. Oh, and BTW, I&#39;m actually not in the DFW metroplex itself... I&#39;m about 125 miles northwest in W.Falls. I lived and worked in the north Dallas, Richardson, Plano, Addison, Carrolton, Coppell, Lewisville area for a few years back in the 1990s though.

You provided also a lot of info about electrolysis itself as you gave very descriptive particulars - great for someone like me who didn&#39;t know more than just the very basics of what electrolysis is.

When I had my electrolysis for GCS (not at E3K) the lidocaine injections would last at least three hours...
</p>
<p>
And yeah they are the worst thing ever. Truly the most acute pain I have ever felt.

Sounds like perhaps mepivacaine or bupivacaine was used and not classic lidocaine if the numbing lasted 3 hours. Those burn even worse than lidocaine when injected just under the surface of the skin, and they cost a lot more money too. They are in short supply nationwide right now too, and inventories are needed for epidurals and dental and orthopedic surgeries

Actually E3K is in Lewisville.... Denton County, which was not yet under any kind of lockdown of medical treatment clinics all day Monday. E3K is qualified as a medical treatment clinic since licensed healthcare professionals are employed there (the lido injections require being done at minimum by a licensed nurse under the supervision of a licensed physician.)
