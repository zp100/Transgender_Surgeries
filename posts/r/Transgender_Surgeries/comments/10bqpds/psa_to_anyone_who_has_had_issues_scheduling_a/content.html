Starting roughly 11 months ago, Maple Grove Hospital in Minnesota changed policies causing Dr Bryan Rolfes to lose work privileges there. This resulted in him not being able to schedule longer surgeries or surgeries with patients with certain medical conditions. He still has his practice that deals with most of his patients though.
</p>
<p>
As of yesterday these problems have been resolved and they can begin scheduling these surgeries! I was second in line (March 2022) to get surgery at MGH when this began and it has been such a long wait!!
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately their FFS surgery coordinator is out of office all next week... So if you&#39;ve already had a consult and are looking to reach out again, you may want to wait until the following Monday.

That’s great for you, but is she ever in the office? She is definitely frustrating to deal with.

She&#39;s absolutely terrible to deal with. Two months ago I started sending her weekly emails asking for stuff, and she&#39;d answer half of the questions half of the time. The pestering slowly squeezed answers out of her, rather than most of stuff being ignored forever. Working with her has been as bad as the delays themselves.
</p>
<p>
She did recently start setting up auto-replies for her clinic days, which makes it easier to know when she&#39;s busy vs when she&#39;s just ignoring me (still mostly seems like the latter tbh)
</p>
<p>
I look forward to this process being over so I can stop worrying about her ignoring all my damn questions. She&#39;s lucky that Rolfes is an awesome surgeon or she would have pushed me to go elsewhere

I totally agree. You’d think that spending 40k plus would get you a response without having to email someone else to compel her to respond. It’s a lot of money, plus a life changing, nerve racking thing to have to deal with to begin with. I wonder if the Dr is aware of how bad she is.

You also email the front desk to get her to respond to emails lol? Yeah it&#39;s so frustrating! Part of me isn&#39;t sure if she&#39;s simply terrible, or if it&#39;s that she&#39;s overworked? She&#39;s their only coordinator for FFS and pretty sure other stuff too.
</p>
<p>
Either way I intend to make the problems known after I have surgery.
