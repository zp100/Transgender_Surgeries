I finally have some time to make an update of my results. Everything continues to be good with my results. My scars continue to be steadily healing and are mostly flat and pale now. Depth is still at least 6 inches on the orange dilator with no noticeable loss in depth. Sensation is really good. The only minor issue is that part of my labia minora is fused together close to the bottom as a result of how I healed. I am planning to get that fixed as part of a revision with my original surgeon. I also plan on getting the aesthetics touched up to make thing look even better. Feel free to ask me anything. Edit: Forgot to add that I stopped douching against the directions of the surgeon along with probiotics and it helped improve my issues with bacteria. Hope this is of help to anybody post-op who is struggling with bacteria issues.

Thanks for posting!
</p>
<p>
Is your clit buried under your hood?
</p>
<p>
What other aesthetic concerns are you hoping to have addressed in the revision?

Yes, the clit is under the hood. I have to spread the labia minora to get a good look at it. I&#39;m happy it&#39;s like that since my clit is very sensitive.
</p>
<p>
Additional aesthetic concerns I want addressed is not finalized but I have following currently. I would like a better defined clit hood and I would like to improve the appearance of the labia minora around the entrance of the vagina.

hey so i just got my surgery date and its on the 22nd. my surgery is with Bélanger and i was wondering how your experience was? i made a post about GRS Montreal and like a few people been saying that they suck and have had bad experiences with them. lastly I&#39;ve heard that i &#34;NEED&#34; electrolysis before i get this surgery. but OHIP doesn&#39;t cover it and im to broke to even front the bill myself.
