First, I have to say I absolutely love Dr Hanna and his team. They‚Äôre incredibly kind and really seem to know what they‚Äôre doing.
</p>
<p>
I choose to have zero depth vaginoplasty (well, more like an inch or so ‚Äúdimple‚Äù)
</p>
<p>
Here is a pic of my new vulva at about 5 weeks. The white stuff has gone down but is still weird to look at lol. Pain has been decent the last couple of weeks until today.
</p>
<p>
The area near my clit feels super tender. If I move funny or sit on my donut pillow, I get a sharp stinging pain. Hoping this is just temporary as part of the healing process and is maybe a stitch that‚Äôs coming out now.
</p>
<p>
Please feel free to drop any questions and I‚Äôll try and get to them.

I totally agree. I‚Äôve never had a doctor quite like him and so glad he‚Äôs in this field. I feel like a shill but this is something to seriously take into consideration as well, in addition to the results.

Yeah my clit apparently worked from when he removed the packing and I thought it would only work after like 6 months. I‚Äôm 4 weeks but I have sensation down there.

Can confirm! My clitoris has been fully sensational from the jump. He did a fantastic job. Literally love this man. My clitoris is still white as well and he did mention that necrotic tissue is not uncommon but I‚Äôm holding out hope based on what I‚Äôve seen from other girls that it‚Äôs just part of the healing process. When he pressed on it yesterday I had plenty of feeling. The tiny bit of ‚Äúwound separation‚Äù I have, which he said he wouldn‚Äôt quite call it that‚Ä¶. Is taking forever to heal. I think that‚Äôs been the most frustrating. I haven‚Äôt had much pain‚Ä¶ the stitching it‚Äôs OBNOXIOUS ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm obviously loving everything about this journey‚ù§Ô∏è

Good news! The pain seems to subsided for the most part. I‚Äôm pretty sure I just overdid it as I started feeling a bit more ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
For anyone else that is about to go through this, please, please, please take it easy üòÖ

May I ask if that reduced costs/complications/recovery?

Cost would most likely be the same. Less complications though and no dilation is quite nice.
