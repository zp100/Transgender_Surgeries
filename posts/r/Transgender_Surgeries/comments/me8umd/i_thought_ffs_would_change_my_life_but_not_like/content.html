After about 2 years of waiting, I finally got medi-cal to cover FFS and they referred me to someone I&#39;d never heard of and couldn&#39;t find much information about online, Dr. Alex Kim in Beverly Hills. I walked in to California Hospital in downtown LA the morning of the procedure feeling hopeful for my new future, then afterward spent a long night in a recovery room begging the nurses to loosen my head bandages because they were so tight under my chin that I couldn&#39;t swallow or speak without pain and felt I couldn&#39;t breathe properly.The nurses pretty much told me to stop complaining, that my blood oxygen was normal so I was breathing fine. One of them said &#34;you need to calm down, you just had a major surgery, if it was easy everyone would do it.&#34; Another told me I had already lost a lot of blood and if they loosen the bandages I might bleed out and since I&#39;d already had a transfusion they wouldn&#39;t be able to give me another. Another noticed my left arm was limp, which I thought was just due to laying on it weird. They said I may be having a stroke and I need to calm down if I didn&#39;t want to end up in the ICU. The next morning I was discharged, my brother drove me home but once I got inside was having trouble breathing because I was swallowing too much blood and couldn&#39;t spit it out into the trashcan fast enough. I told my brother to call 911 so they could hopefully open my airway. Paramedics arrived and noticed my limp left arm and suspected I may be having a stroke, then they drove me back to California Hospital ER which transferred me to Keck USC hospital which ultimately saved my life. Doctors there preformed an emergency tracheotomy to allow me to breathe again despite the severe swelling in my neck and did imaging to confirm that I had indeed sufferred a stroke in my right frontal lobe, after which a neurosurgeon put in a stent to clear the clot. When I awoke I could not even open my eyes, all I could do was listen to the medical staff all around me commenting on how 30 is so young to have a stroke and how much of a shame it was for all this to happen to me for cosmetic surgery. I couldn&#39;t speak either to explain to them that this was
<em>
not
</em>
a cosmetic procedure but was medically necessary.
</p>
<p>
Turns out that during the mandible reduction, something went wrong and caused severe trauma to my carotid artery resulting in significant bleeding, all of which resulted in a stroke and brain damage. Now I can&#39;t use my left arm. I can&#39;t play games or type or work or tie my own shoelaces. My eyes are also different sizes now, with one dilated more than the other and I have some difficulty focusing or looking at bright light. I&#39;ll need to take blood thinners for the rest of my life to ward off a second stroke. I feel like my life is ruined. I don&#39;t know how to process all of this, I feel such regret. It&#39;s so hard knowing that if I could have just accepted the way I looked or if I had enough money to choose my own surgeon that I might still have a future now.

I can&#39;t speak on the surgery aspect, but as someone whose family member has had a stroke, I encourage you to reach out to communities of stroke survivors to help in your recovery and acceptance of it. There are small exercises that you can do on your own to help you regain function, even if not as much as the therapy itself, and may be worth asking those people with experiencing recovering from events like these for recommendations. The
<a href="/r/stroke">r/stroke
</a>
subreddit is pretty active.

Yes I&#39;ve found that subreddit to be a great resource so far, thank you for the thoughts. Acceptance is definitely the hard part. Hard to believe that just a month ago I had a whole world of possibilities in front of me..

Seconding this. The brain is an amazing organ and has an incredible capacity to rewire itself. Through consistent stimulus of the affected areas, you may be able to regain partial or in some cases even full mobility, and seeing as you are still young, you&#39;re going to recover quicker. Its a tough road ahead of you and I don&#39;t envy you, but hopefully you have people who can support you and help you gain back what youve lost and without too much financial strain (I&#39;m guessing your in the US and you have to pay for dedicated therapy). I also hope that the actual surgery atleast ends up looking good, and that they didnt fuck that up too. And lastly, I hope that you can sue those fucking ass shithole dickheads into the ground for malpractice, &#39;cuz what they did to you was super duper ultra shady and just fucking wrong.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I kinda know how you feel, I used to work at a Casino and they had ridiculously bright lighting that caused me to pass out several times and get stroke like symptoms. Turns out its a rare form of migraine that mimics a stroke and doubles my chance of having a real stroke. I never sued them, but fuck i wish I could, it really messed with my brain, I cant be in bright white lighting without feeling like Im about to pass out and puke everywhere.

Have you thought about contacting Lambda Legal or the ACLU for some kind of malpractice based legal action? Idk what you signed or how that works, but I wonder if it’s worth looking into. Because it’s specifically trans related you might be able to get help for free.

I currently have a referral to some random malpractice lawyer, but I may have to look into lambda.

Goes without saying to vet your lawyer with care as best you/your family can as well especially since that one was a random referral. Some people just make money off of referrals and don&#39;t really do the legal stuff for representing the client beyond taking in money and providing advice to pass the bare minimum.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s an attorney in Michigan (Joumana Kayrouz) who&#39;s basically under investigation from the FBI as her business model took this to an extreme and started referring her clients to get mri scans from a machine that she owned. I&#39;m not saying that will happen elsewhere but the point is that there are also predatory and crooked law firms out there that literally just pass money around under the label of medical malpractice law etc. so it&#39;s worth giving some deliberation to the process.
</p>
<p>
There should be a super lawyer directory in your region, and possibly the bar may have its own reviews too.
</p>
<p>
Wishing you the best in your path for healing and justice.

How exactly do I go about vetting a lawyer? I looked around and couldn&#39;t seem to find a &#34;Yelp&#34;-like site for law firms that looked reputable. The guy I was referred to is named Greg A. Meyer based in Sacramento

<p>
Here&#39;s my thought process in the following order: 1) Check for advice from others who might be more seasoned with working with lawyers/as lawyers by making a
<a href="/r/legaladvice">r/legaladvice
</a>
post a request on how to find/vet a good lawyer-- it may also be worth cross posting or posting a version of your story above there as a separate post toobut for now I think you&#39;ll get more reliable guidance about what to look for in a lawyer and how to filter out the bad ones as the replies their don&#39;t always come from lawyers who know the specific field of interest.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not the best person to ask as I&#39;ve only worked along side lawyers rather than as a client but I&#39;ll do my best to share the rest of my thought process.
</p>
<p>
2) This is the website of super lawyerswhich probably ranks them into searchable lists as I mentioned earlier. I *think it is kind of a yelp for lawyers:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://attorneys.superlawyers.com/california-southern">https://attorneys.superlawyers.com/california-southern
</a>
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll need to make it appropriate to your needs as I just pulled up the first result that came up for California. Note that you don&#39;t need to restrict yourself to just what&#39;s near your city, anywhere in your state (technically anyone licensed to practice law by the California Bar Association) can potentially do the job so long as they can work well with you at a distance. Though having someone closer by that can get the paperwork or meet in person when needed certainly has advantages too.
</p>
<p>
A lot of lawyers may have a 20min-45min or 1 hr free consultation. While it&#39;s partially an opportunity to get the key information across to see what they&#39;d do, also pay attention to how they respond and respect you, whether they&#39;re willing to educate, listen attentively, etc  along the way and how they formulate a plan for next steps. Treat it a bit like an interview where you are entitled (not the way people try to gaslight society into thinking entitled = spoiled, entitled in the sense that it is your right to know) to learning if they&#39;re going to be a fit for working with you and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
Plus find out what their record of successes/results and impacts are, what was unique, qualifications in terms of whether they&#39;ve worked on similar cases before.
</p>
<p>
3) I&#39;d also check with the National Lawyer&#39;s guild. Here you&#39;re more likely to find folks who are for the cause (representing low income people, gender equity+justice, movement lawyers etc.; Possibly on sliding scale or with some pro bono representation). However, because pro bono and lots of injustice to people who are already on the hard side of life and society is in high demand, the risk of their attention being stretched thin by not hiring a well paid attorney is very high. This I&#39;ve seen happen for a major federal disabilities justice case and it was really disappointing.
</p>
<p>
So instead, I&#39;d use the super lawyer site list to find the top folks, check/get their free advice and see what can be made financially feasible, and then cross-check with the National Lawyers Guild.
</p>
<p>
There may be more resource hubs and societies out there too. Like maybe LGBTQ+ lawyer networks.
</p>
<p>
But again, your real focus should be :
</p>
<p>
1) Do they get results/win for the client?
</p>
<p>
2) Do they respect me and my story as I share it?
</p>
<p>
3) Do they have gas in the tank to be a champion for my cause now? (Like someone could be top ranked but come across as disinterested or avoidant about your cause, and give a half-hearted effort despite the money being there)
</p>
<p>
4) How can
<em>
we
</em>
make the finances work?
<em>
We
</em>
because it&#39;s not just about you having money, maybe there are ways they can come up with financing or a plan that makes it affordable/taken care of even with a partial win. Or maybe you find an LGBTQ+ legal fund/advocacy group that they&#39;re willing to work with as well and it helps fundraise or just awards funding to boost your effort.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps!

Also fighting any case is always a tough battle.  In your case I suspect you and your lawyer will want to focus on the negligence that happened during and after the surgery.  A very simple argument for example would be establishing it was clear your vitals were not properly stable during/immediately-after your plastic surgery and they should have been able to recognize your breathing problems and react to a suspected stroke.  They should have never sent you home, they should have recognized the problems and sent you to the ICU.
</p>
<p>
Along with finding a good lawyer I would also try to get all information you can in paper/email from Keck USC hospital and California Hospital ER documenting what they observed and had to do in order to save your life.
</p>
<p>
Having that information up front should make it easier for your lawyer to dive in and make a strong case quickly.

That&#39;s a great set of suggestions. I&#39;ll add that part of why the vetting process is so important is because once it&#39;s time to put together evidence and your case, you+those close to you will probably want to, within what&#39;s feasible and reasonable, learn how to self-advocate and work with the lawyer+their staff to put together a cohesive case.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a good chance OP and family/friends may be an expert on the case simply from having been there and knowing what happened and who did what when. But also as you start reading into more about similar case history etc. There may be perspectives on how various cases, evidence, laws, and legal strategies may have worked or can work that the staff might not be looking at at the same time. So ideally you&#39;ll have a dynamic where it may be accepted as additional information to support your case, or gently put into perspective in a way that preserves mutual respect for each other&#39;s efforts.

Your life is not over. You can&#39;t do those things the same way you did them before but you may still be able to do them. It&#39;s not because of your desire to look better or anything you could have controlled, bad things happen and that sucks but is true.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll grieve your loss and eventually you will feel better. But it&#39;s completely unfair to do that alone. Do you have any friends or family that are willing to be by your side?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not your fault, you deserve compensation from the surgeon, and things will get better.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through this

I&#39;m not a stroke doctor but I think you might have a better prognosis than you think. Are you medically healthy other than having had a stroke and this surgery? Some young people in their 20s and 30s have been getting strokes from Corona but most of them have a good chance at fully recovering or getting nearly there because they are otherwise young and healthy. It&#39;s not the same cause but I thought you might like to hear. Medical accidents sometimes happen but those nurses should be fired for recognizing stroke like symptoms but instead punishing you for who knows what. You where in a hospital surrounded by doctors and nurses and they did not give you the help you needed nor the care you deserved which is totally against the doctor code of conduct.

I am so, soo sorry.  A  lawyer as other&#39;s have said is your best protection for you financially.  Obviously nothing can change what has happened and for that all I can tell you is huge hugs.  I hope you recover far more than your doctors can predict and live a happy, though likely different life.
</p>
<p>
For everyone.  Jaw surgery is DANGEROUS.  Far more dangerous than surgeons want you to know.  It requires work on and around critical nerves/veins which are fundamentally different in each person.  Some nerves/veins are located in places surgeons don&#39;t expect and react differently between one person and another if the surgeon tries to resection them.  Reality is very few plastic surgeons should do this type of work, and this story highlights these dangers.
</p>
<p>
Thanks virtualady for being brave enough to share this story.  Again huge hugs.

For everyone.  Jaw surgery is DANGEROUS.  Far more dangerous than surgeons want you to know.  It requires work on and around critical nerves/veins which are fundamentally different in each person.  Some nerves/veins are located in places surgeons don&#39;t expect and react differently between one person and another if the surgeon tries to resection them.  Reality is very few plastic surgeons should do this type of work, and this story highlights these dangers.

Wiah I could have read this months ago. But who knows if I would have even listened, I was so desperate to get the misgendering to stop I might have rolled the dice anyway.

Yes I wish people were more aware of the dangers of Jaw, Nasal and body contouring surgeries.  The challenge is some types of Jaw/Nasal surgeries are much lower risk and the complications are typically recoverable.  While other types where the jaw/nose is re-sectioned have much higher rates of serious complication including severed nerves, serious blood vessel damage, bone damage and problems with screws holding the aggressively re-sectioned bone in place.
</p>
<p>
I think there is a place for re-sectioning surgeries for deformities which seriously impact your quality of life where ones nose or jaw is so deformed you have daily problems with breathing and eating.
</p>
<p>
But Nose/Jaw work for your average plastic surgeon and average person (transgendered or otherwise) should really stick to methodologies for shaving and reshaping the bone.  Risks for severe nerve/blood vessel complications is far lower.
</p>
<p>
Surgery is something many transgendered need or want to do, but our surgeons should do a much better job of informing risks and pursue surgery styles which are less likely to jeopardize someone&#39;s livelihood.

Isn’t jaw surgery shaving? What type of surgery are you talking about that’s dangerous?

Jaw surgeries vary quite a bit.  For example v-line surgery which is widely popular in Korea often only mentions/shows the shaving from the sides of the jaw.  But many v-line surgeries also include  changes to the major muscle we use for chewing:
</p>
<p>
Clear v-line explain straight from a New York based surgery place:
</p>
<p>
<code>
&#34;After the jawbone has been expertly shaped, your surgeon will address the masseter muscle, and may make it smaller with a precise debulking technique. The masseter muscle, which runs along the cheek from the ear to the chin, is responsible for aiding in the chewing process. Reducing the size of this muscle slims the sides of the face below the cheekbones. &#34;
</code>
</p>
<p>
So even in the &#34;simple&#34; v-line jaw surgery your major jaw muscle is cut up to debulk, the bottom of your jaw is shaved or sliced off, and the chin is partially resectioned.  Which means every blood vessel and nerve wrapping around the jaw and masseter muscle is at risk for complications.
</p>
<p>
And if you&#39;re getting a more complicated jaw resection (where your jawbone is completely cut through to remove a full section and shorten the jaw) these surgical interactions become even more frighteningly invasive and dangerous.
</p>
<p>
The end result is every year people around the world suffer from nerve, blood vessel and bone damage from jaw surgeries intended to enhance beauty or conform to the female form.

Reviving this to ask about how this (resectioning risks) apply to Nasal work/Rhinoplasty. I’ll be skipping all jaw work after reading this much.

I can&#39;t believe someone is so fuckin incompetent at their job. You should have been immediately moved to another department and tested for stroke then, especially if they knew what was going to happen. It&#39;s absolutely irresponsible and they all should get fired immediately.
</p>
<p>
Also what the hell, were they trying to say that a stroke will just go away if you calm down?

Yeah that part and the comment about how everyone would do it if it were easy have really stuck with me for being so insensitive and unlike anything that should come out of a medical professional&#39;s mouth. It was very difficult to try to speak with the bandage squeezing my throat and I really wanted to tell those ladies off, like why don&#39;t you try relaxing when it feels like you&#39;re being strangled. At one point I resorted to banging my knuckles on the side of the hospital bed and trying my best to yell for help to get anyone&#39;s attention and one lady stuck her head in and said &#34;is that you making all that racket?&#34; Infuriating.

When they discharged you when they thought you were having a stroke, they basically just handed you their asses. That&#39;s a lawsuit you will win. You never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever discharge a patient you suspect is or just had a stroke. This is the most outrageous, ridiculous malpractice. you had a stroke and it wasn&#39;t addressed immediately. It could have been treated differently, earlier. These people made your stroke worse than it needed by discharging you. I wonder how many other patients they&#39;ve almost killed or actually killed.

Yes. Exactly this. If a medical professional suspects a stroke, it has to be escalated and addressed right away. This is the most basic simple like I can&#39;t even imagine I just I can&#39;t I&#39;m blown away wow words I can&#39;t do them and I&#39;m going to go to bed now wow just f****** wow

Yeah, there&#39;s definitely an issue with how hospitals trwat trans people on medi-cal. I could have died from internal bleeding because Dr. Ray at Cedars-Sinai didn&#39;t seem to care about stopping that before closing me up and even the hospitals I went to afterwards mistreated me, and I had to go BACK to Dr. Ray to get it fixed. I didn&#39;t have the energy to start up a lawsuit, but there&#39;s a disturbing pattern I think I&#39;m seeing here and I don&#39;t like it one bit.

I mean, I had internal bleeding that needed to be fixed or I could die and nobody was able to do so at the other places I went so I didn&#39;t have a choice. I did turn them down when they offered revision for really minor dogears and I made it VERY clear why. Can&#39;t even really see them much at this point anyway.

I wish there were something that could be done about this &#34;disturbing pattern&#34; as you put it, but if it&#39;s intentional and systemic I wonder where to even begin pulling on threads through discovery if I could find a lawyer who wanted to help investigate? I wonder if there&#39;s a department at medi-cal that specifically handles transgender care that needs better oversight. How would you even prove that they&#39;re skimping on providers to cut expenses?

It sounds like we need to organize the community to share experiences. If there&#39;s a pattern, there needs to be a class action lawsuit against Medi-Cal. if this is really something that is happening because they&#39;re skimping on providers, they&#39;re responsible for the outcomes you guys are experiencing out there. You deserve restitution for that and they need to face consequences in a way that makes them realize they can never allow this to happen again.

I&#39;ve had many surgeries and while none of them are related to transidentity, I&#39;ve never been treated in a Bad way in any hospital and I&#39;m out and transitoned. I think it depends on the country since where I live, in France I&#39;ve never Heard of such things...

I made a post about it
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/9bz9ou/tits_on_top_the_bewebening_my_experience_with_mtf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">two years ago
</a>
</p>
<p>
Tl-dr Dr. Kim took out the drain too early. I developed a hematoma which required surgery to remove, he didn’t put a drain in. Developed another hematoma which required a drain. He was going on vacation that day so he didn’t wait for a radiologist. He opened up the whole damn incision to put in the drain in a non-sterile room. Got pseudomonas A. Which colonized the implant and nearly worked its way to my heart. Ended up going to the ER for emergency surgery.

The insurance company assigned me to him after I complained about two others. First was a bariatric surgeon and the second one insisted on male pronouns.

Money? Since a lot of people&#39;s trans surgeries are out of pocket because insurance doesn&#39;t deem it necessary.... ( Like teachers who hate kids at private schools )

Having been through the shitter with surgery and left with permanent damage, my heart goes out to you. I can only imagine the long difficult road you face no matter what path you take moving forward. I would call Lambda for some legal references, but you shouldn’t have to pay anything for a malpractice attorney they almost always work on a contingency basis. What you need to have is the documentation and medical records to present to them so they have a clear understanding of what happened. If you have a solid documented case, attorneys are far more likely to take your case. It’s important that you not make any legal threats. The moment you do, it will trigger all kinds of processes designed to protect the the Hospital, the surgeon and the nursing staff and make things far more difficult for you to access the medical information you need.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, what you haven’t mentioned and no one has asked is, what has the surgeon’s reaction been to everything that has happened post-dismissal? Have they reached out to you? Are they still offering you any level of care? There should have been at least some kind of follow up by them or someone in your care team of primary care. Someone needs to be involved with managing your care and getting you the aftercare you need. Typically that would fall back to your primary care doctor.

If it&#39;s only been a month, don&#39;t despair. Sue their fucking pants off, get rich, and I imagine you&#39;ll make a solid recovery with PT and hard work. It&#39;s fucked up that this happened to you solely because of their poor care practices it sounds like. You had no way to know this would happen and it ISN&#39;T YOUR FAULT. You made the decision you thought was best at the time and that is okay and the rest is not your fault. But how the rest goes is up to you.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re still very young and the eye thing could be kinda cool if you can rock it like Bowie did. Also, 30 is in fact super young to have a stroke. That sucks, but on the plus side you have a much greater neuroplasticity and you&#39;re far more likely than an oldster to gain back your functionality and quality of life. Thank you for sharing this. Also if you are angry or lonely and need someone to vent to, feel free to holler and I can be a friend.

I&#39;m so sad this happened to you, thank you for sharing. I hate to think how much difference it could have made if you had gone to ICU rather than being discharged.

Good luck with the legal proceedings, I hope you are able to pursue this. It could make your life easier but also help protect others.

Nope besides estradiol. The doctors at keck seemed to think it was definitely caused by surgical trauma to the artery though and not due to hrt.

I am so so sorry for you. I was botched by surgeon bryan rolfes. Hes a praised superstar surgeon here but he destroyed my face. I was already so scared of ffs surgery i prayed it would be a 1 time deal for me only to end up botched. But the worst part for me was During my brutal recovery when i called bryan rolfes omni team and chaudry answered the phone as he was the only one on call at the time and he accused me of being some type of self medicating addict because i was in so much pain begging for painkillers to relieve it. I think many of these doctors look at us transwomen as experiments and Dont care wheter we live or die. I have to get revision surgery elsewhere and I&#39;m genuinely petrified to trust another surgeron.

That really sucks, sorry that happened to you. I experienced some hesitancy to administer pain meds in the hospital like you described as well. Like, what kind of angle do they think we&#39;re trying to play like yeah I&#39;ll just fake an entire hormonal and social gender transition and have my face bones shaved down with a grinder just to scam some gullible doctors out of a few pills...

Sue the everloving FUCK out of that surgeon and hospital. That&#39;s a hell of a lot of malpractice, and they even dismissed you and told you to get over it when you tried to bring their attention to it
<em>
while you were still under their care
</em>
</p>
<p>
Not only did they damage you, insult you, discharge you before you were stable, and cause immense damage... You could have died. They basically left you to die because they were too fucking lazy to check or care. This is everything wrong with medicine right now, lazy doctors and prices too high for patients to choose their own physicians.
</p>
<p>
Give them hell. Hell, pm me and I&#39;ll help you give them hell. There is nothing on this planet that infuriates me more than shit like this, you didn&#39;t deserve this at all and I&#39;m so so sorry you&#39;re having this happen.

You do still have a future. My surgery went wrong too (but it didn&#39;t change my ability to do things) and I&#39;m lopsided now too. It sucks a lot. I was depressed a long time. I wish I&#39;d done things differently but I know it was just bad luck. I didn&#39;t bring it on myself and you didn&#39;t bring this on yourself. We were seeking care for a medical problem. I still think about what I would do definitely. I think one day that will stop.
</p>
<p>
You have a future because we have technology that can help you adapt and laws to make your employer allow supports. You have a future because even lopsided people have friends and lovers and families. You have a future because you&#39;re still here. If I met you, I would not see just the things that happened from your complications, I would see virtualady. You do not have to be beautiful or typical looking to be worth something. There are people out there who will see you and accept all of you. Life is hard and tragic. It&#39;s also got those special moments and wonderful people. You will have those too.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t speak directly to the experience of losing your arm function. I have had some problems with using my hands and have learned a lot about how to adapt. It was very frustrating and I tried to adapt on my own without getting any help. That was stupid. You should be able to get some good ideas and access to some assistive technologies from an occupational therapist. If you can&#39;t afford it because your health insurance doesn&#39;t cover it, I would talk to the hospital and tell them about how this is affecting you and see if they have any grants or a payment plan. I hope you get some things in your life to help you with everyday tasks sooner rather than later. It&#39;s very easy to let the dispair take over and not look after the rest of your health or seek out resources. You have to recognize that your life can still be good and you still matter, so you deserve as much help as you need right now making your life the best it can be.
</p>
<p>
When something like this happens in your life, it can affect you so deeply, it can help to talk to a therapist or go to a support group for people who have similar experiences. Have you ever thought of going to a support group for stroke survivors? People who have strokes experience something so life-changing. I&#39;ve been to one, and I think it could be very helpful. If you feel like you&#39;re getting really depressed, there are also support groups for that. My point is, life is always harder when you try to go by the loan and you don&#39;t need to reinvent the wheel here on coping with this emotionally and how to adapt while you&#39;re already facing so much change. Also, you should know that depression is incredibly common after a brain injury, so please reach out for help if you think your emotional state is persistently staying low. You don&#39;t have to live with that and instead you can treat it.

Hi. I&#39;ve been having some problems typing for a long time and I&#39;m wondering if I need to buy this product. I&#39;m worried that it won&#39;t be very good because we bought it maybe a decade ago and it was s***. We didn&#39;t use it. I don&#39;t want to spend even $100 on something that&#39;s not going to work. Could you tell me what your experience is like?

It&#39;s really cool what they do in England at your work. I&#39;m in America and I don&#39;t have a job right now. I think my employer might have to provide something like that if I had documentation of the disability. I&#39;m not sure. I am having trouble hitting the right keys. I have to get testing done but the neurologist I went to wanted to talk more about my genitals than anything else so I&#39;m kind of putting it off.

Wow, makes one do a double take on if FFS is worth it. I know for some people it is necessary, but this really makes me re-think if its medically necessary for me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d have mine done at Kaiser SF, so I have a good feeling I&#39;d be in good hands, even if there were complications. That doesn&#39;t remove the risk of something going terribly wrong though and ending up disabled like you have. Surgery is inherently dangerous, so one should really weigh the pro&#39;s vs possible complications.
</p>
<p>
This is not making any excuse for the way you were treated or that had you gone to a better surgeon that this could of been avoided. It just personally makes me re-think what surgeries are medically necessary for myself and what surgeries I can live the rest of my life without. FFS and Vaginoplasty might be two of those surgeries I skip after reading this horrible outcome. I&#39;m trans fem, but also somewhat non-binary, so its like I probably could live a happy life just with taking estrogen and having an orchi (I&#39;ll have to wait to see if a BA will be necessary, but females in my family have larger breasts, so I have a good chance for some C/D cups, I already have small B cups 6 months in).
</p>
<p>
I hope you can find some fulfillment in life after becoming disabled due to to an incompetent surgeon and staff.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully you can get some money to at least allow you to focus on getting better and living out your life with fulfillment due to your disability now.
</p>
<p>
Many programming IDE&#39;s have auto fill functions, so learning how to optimize using these functions could help in you still being able to be a CS student and a programmer.
</p>
<p>
It will take some training, but maybe a one handed keyboard would help you still be able to program? Just a quick search found these:

This is horrifying. I can&#39;t believe the nurse would say &#34;if it was easy everyone would do it&#34; to a scared and hurting patient. You didn&#39;t deserve any of this, my heart breaks for you. I hope you are able to regain use of your left arm, and despite all this, that your FFS results were good.

Definitely get a good malpractice firm/lawyer. This is awful and that surgeon should not get to just walk away having ruined your life like this. In thr UK you would receive compensation to cover all the costs, including emotional, that this has caused you. And in your case it&#39;s lifelong so that will amount to a lot. I can only imagine that it&#39;s similar in the US where you are. Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. But I am a doctor.

I am so sorry this happened to you. Like holy shit I am so sorry. It seems like you are already thinking like this but please do not blame yourself. It is the world we live in where trans operations are &#34;optional&#34; or &#34;cosmetic&#34; instead of being viewed as life saving (which they are). Wish I could give advice or anything but seems like many are helping.
</p>
<p>
But never blame yourself. Something I did far too much of (and still working on it). The only thing you did was try to find your happy. Never stop doing that!

This sounds like someone who needs to be stopped before they continue to hurt other people for negligence. I really wonder how many other people experienced something similar from this same doctor.

Please file malpractice and there&#39;s gotta be something you can do to fuck over insurance so this doesn&#39;t happen to anyone else. I am so, so sorry that &#34;insurance&#34; did this to you. Someone mentioned Lambda Legal. Please get in contact with them. Cases like this are their specialty. Hope they take yours pro bono.

There are a lot of risks that you take with FFS.  You should never work with a doctor that you don&#39;t feel comfortable working with.  I am so sorry you have had the experience you have had.  This is something all of us worry about when going to get FFS.   Unfortunately FFS does not fix everything.

I feel so incredibly sorry for you this is so unfair. My heart goes out to you. I am so close to crying because of what happened to you. I feel for you and you are not alone. I immediately went on google and rated the surgeon one star. If there is any way to help you or donate money to you, please let me know i will gladly donate. Stay strong. I am sending all my love your way.

Hello, firstly I am so sorry.  I want to direct you to Exulansic’s new video which was done directly on your post and published two days ago.  I am so sorry this has all happened to you.  You can find it here:

Yaaaay! Being repeatedly referred to as a man by some stranger on the internet pretending to care so deeply for my future as they monetize my personal tragedy for content... exactly what I needed today. Thanks for sharing, lol.
</p>
<p>
... All that talk of self-awareness yet they still fail to realize that their insatiable urge to exclude trans women from womanhood is
<em>
exactly
</em>
what made my procedure medically necessary. My career was dead in the water before I ever even acquired a disability entirely because of attitudes like this one. Bigoted attitudes have for all intents and purposes made being visibly trans into a disability.
</p>
<p>
Yes, surgery is the &#34;escape&#34; and the &#34;easy way out&#34;... Because changing society to be more inclusive is hard, bordering on impossible. Largely because of views such as those expressed in the linked video. And accepting oneself becomes similarly impossible when people like that love going out of their way to remind you of how mentally ill and abnormal you are at every possible opportunity. Especially when they&#39;re positioning themselves as a medical authority.
</p>
<p>
If they want trans women to stop having unnecessary procedures... then maybe they should stop denying our womanhood until we are able to acquire them. The hypocrisy and doublespeak is absolutely insane.

Who is that person btw? Just some random terf? Or do they have a fan base who I need to worry about that may dox me from my support post?

<p>
Considering deleting the OP now.
</p>
<p>
I wanted my story to be out there to help other trans people weigh all the risks, not to bolster some reactionary narrative about how we&#39;re mentally ill and how cis people need to start denying our trans-affirming care more often. Ridiculous. That creator should be ashamed. Especially if they&#39;re in medicine.

I wouldn’t recommend deleting the OP.  It’s a lesson for others to learn from.  But Exulansic does indeed have a fanbase.  She was just featured on Triggernometry last week.  Her old channel had nearly 15,000 subscribers.  She’s not quite a detransitioned FTM as she never started testosterone HRT; she just took part a lot in such circles for some years and considered transitioning while loosely identifying for some time as trans masculine.  It’s worth having this opportunity for harsh dialogue, because it allows for your position to win out.  We cannot let them win in their own corner.  We cannot win either in isolated safety.  Unfortunately we have to be bold and brave to keep our rights safe and sacred.

First I&#39;ve heard of her, but she seems to be a detransitioned FTM, quiet active online and got banned from YouTube for hate speech. She&#39;s verging on the incomprehensible and its hard to work out what she&#39;s on about. From a quick look there seems to be something very wrong with her.

That makes a lot of sense.
</p>
<p>
No wonder they&#39;re so invested. They
<em>
need
</em>
trans people to be seen as mentally ill in order for their own self narrative to remain cohesive, otherwise it indicates a flaw in their own judgement.
</p>
<p>
Also they could not have possibly been more wrong about my sibling lol. TFW you&#39;re trying so hard to invalidate trans women that you accidentally invalidate enbies too as collateral damage 🤦‍♀️

...That&#39;s what happens when you try to politicize every situation into &#34;cis women are the real victims here&#34;.  Absolutely absurd. These people are unhinged.

Isn&#39;t carotoid artery all the back? Did the surgeon try to cut the jaw angle? I can&#39;t believe it. You should sue him and the hospital for not listening to you.

Hmmmm okay. I&#39;m sorry to hear. I looked him up on Realself and he has botched surgery complaints and a lot of people seemed to have been treated badly by the same hospital staff where you were operated on.  These types of surgeons are a threat to people&#39;s lives.

It&#39;s what happens when only those who desire prestige and money are encouraged to become surgeons and doctors. No care for the patient after the money comes in.

Imo it sounds like they may have deliberately messed up OP&#39;s surgery, but that&#39;s an assumption.

Imagine rewriting your post but re: SRS or hormones instead of FFS. Some of us need it to reduce crippling dysphoria. Have some compassion.

FFS was a vehicle towards me having self acceptance and inner peace. It and SRS were the two things that made me move beyond having dysphoria. It also, frankly, had nothing to do with beauty standards, because I had relatively subtle FFS (brow reduction, extremely minimal chin work, no jaw work, and a trachea shave), and I’m not a particularly attractive woman as a result, but I do have a face that looks, to me, like a woman’s face. Don’t judge people for the paths they need to take towards ending dysphoria.

Call the bar association and get some referrals for lawyers who specialize in malpractice. I don’t know if you have a case against the surgeon (bad outcomes doesn’t necessarily mean malpractice), but from your statement, you may have one against Dignity Health and even against the nurses who observed you.
</p>
<p>
Again, you’ll need to talk to a lawyer. If you are permanently disabled, you need to be compensated for the rest of your life.

I don&#39;t mean this question to be insensitive, but...did they at least do a decent job on the FFS? I would imagine if they didn&#39;t that it would be a double whammy. I&#39;m so sorry this has happened to you.

Im so so sorry this has happened to you. There&#39;s no words that can describe how horrible this is. My only advice is that I strongly encourage you to look into sueing for malpractice - not just for your sake, but for the sake of any trans individual who may go to Dr. Alex Kim in the future. This shit should never happen.

You might have already done this, but make sure to write down everything you remember now while it&#39;s fresh in your mind. Names, times, statements, etc. As many details as possible.

I don&#39;t know if this will help, but [ratemds.com](ratemds.com) might offer some information about the doctors who operated on you that might help your legal case.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so sorry to hear about how much you&#39;re suffering. Please take good care of yourself.

For the love of god fucking sue the shit out of them. I want you to take everything they have, this is such gross negligence and for everyone else’s sake he needs to be made an example of. You will have lawyers piling up to take this case, don’t be down, get to it right away. He’s a rich beveryhills surgeon, plenty of money for the lawyers and for you.  Please please please post an update, I want to see you talking with a lawyer seriously in a week. A good lawyer too, a law firm more accurate actually.

I tried but no lawyer will take the case on contingency because MICRA stacks the legal environment for medical malpractice in California in favor of the insurance companies. The attorneys can&#39;t make enough of a profit off of helping me to justify taking all the financial risk of building the case and hiring the expert witnesses which would be required to prove and quantify the economic damage done to my career. Pain and suffering damages are limited to 250k and the lawyer&#39;s percentage of that would be pocket change to them.
</p>
<p>
I think I&#39;m just fucked for life now. I&#39;m trying not to have hope that I will ever be compensated and just accept that this is my existence now and I&#39;m always going to be a broke disabled person in a low wage job.
</p>
<p>
But at least my jawline doesn&#39;t bother me as much now, and I&#39;m getting gendered correctly more often at least, though I&#39;m still getting Sir pretty frequently.

i know you might hear this a lot... but i am soo incredibly sorry for what happened to you. i know nothing i can do or say will really ever change it... and honestly that makes me so upset because you never deserved this. no one does. just know i and the rest of us here are sending you all the good vibes and healing thoughts. i know it might seem hard or impossible to hope but hope is a powerful thing. and i hope that one day you are able to live life again and to get justice for what those fuckers did. again super very sorry, my heart aches in pain that this happened 😢
