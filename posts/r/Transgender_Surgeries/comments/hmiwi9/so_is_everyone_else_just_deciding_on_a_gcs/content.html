So is everyone else just deciding on a GCS surgeon before they even book a consultation?

I just called and booked a consultation with BBL but it&#39;s more than a year away. It seems unrealistic to think that someone could do multiple consultations for GCS the way we have to for other surgeries. I don&#39;t even know if BBL will offer me PPT which is what I want, and I have to wait a year before I can even ask her questions about it.
</p>
<p>
So it seems like I&#39;m expected to figure out up front what surgeon I want to go to. In that case the consultation is more of a formality than anything else. It would be nice if we could at least have a Skype call with the surgeon to ask basic questions and figure out if we want to move forward with a formal consultation.

I‚Äôm seeing Dr. RBbL next week for the second half (actual physical exam) of my consult. Due to COVID-19 restrictions the first part was by Video. My lesson learned in working toward this with her office is that until you complete your surgery package and return it, you are simply a name on a long list of wannabes (perhaps a bit harsh, but completing your package shows you‚Äôre serious about the path you are on and separates you from the crowd)! That package is key to setting the wheels in motion.
</p>
<p>
Once your package is accepted, you can call and ask to be put on the consultation cancellation list. Then, you start calling every Wednesday afternoon, at about 3:00 and ask if there are any cancellation slots available. The first break I got shaved 77-days off my original February 2021, consultation date. I continued to catch a break to get me where I am in the queue now. Btw, the appointment staff answering the phones encourage you to call them as many times as you like. They are there to help you find a sooner availability.
</p>
<p>
When you want to be a patient of one of the world‚Äôs best, you have to be prepared to wait. However, there are things you can do to help yourself in the meantime. 1. Do the work and get your package done/returned. 2. Get on the cancellation list/start making calls. 3. Start your genital electrolysis now!

I‚Äôd be interested in hearing how the physical exam goes ‚Äî I have mine a week after yours.

And I second everything you say about how to get things in motion with them.

Deal. I intend to share as a means of giving back to this community. When one knows what is ahead, one can plan and the journey is a little less scary.

Because that was what the staff told me to do. In this case, I didn‚Äôt look a gift horse in the mouth. I did as suggested and it paid off. I had to make the calls and got lucky.

is the link to my video portion of the consult. I asked Dr. Jun that specific question. All penile, scrotal, perineum-down to the anus needs to be removed.
</p>
<p>
I already had electrolysis appointments scheduled at Papillon Center and after the consult, I sent an email to NYU Langone, asked, and they sent me a diagram that further clarified (imagine a ‚ÄúV‚Äù shape) from
<strong>

</strong>
penis/scrotum (where the base of the penis meets the top of the scrotum) down to the anus, where the width (sides) of the ‚ÄúV‚Äù run down the ‚Äúgroin crease‚Äù on both sides. In addition to described above, all hair within the ‚ÄúV‚Äù has to go.
</p>
<p>
Btw, I‚Äôm 13 hrs into electrolysis appointments at Papillon Center. That is another whole chapter, however, I

recommend going there for this treatment if you can.

Do you have a rough estimate of the total number of hours needed?  I should be at full clear on my face in a couple weeks, and was going to start on removal for GCS .

YMMV. I am fortunate in that I didn‚Äôt have a lot of hair to start with. I had my consult with Dr.‚Äôs RBbL and Zhao this past Tuesday. I made it a point not to shave since before my last electrolysis session so they could see exactly where I am in the process. I was told to finish clearing the perineum and I would be good to go.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm thinking by the end of my next two 4-hour sessions, I will be set for surgery. That would reflect a total of 21-hours electrolysis.

You can and should do multiple consultations. The big names with the long waiting lists are the hardest and I think people usually do go ahead and pick on of those and hopes they aren‚Äôt too much of an ass.  I have also seen multiple friends change surgeons after finding certain ones difficult to work with.

It really depends on the surgeon. If you wanted to get consults from smaller surgeons, this is much more feasible.

Yeah, it&#39;s just that I really can&#39;t find any smaller surgeons that are all that reputable. One botched surgery is enough for me.

Where are you located?  I found one close to home in Ohio - he doesnt post results but will show you plenty once you are established. I&#39;m very satisfied with my orchiectomy he performed and hes one of the nicest people I think I&#39;ve ever met!

I was told that she requires that you get clearance from her psychiatrist in addition to having your own WPATH letters. I don&#39;t live near NYC and the inconvenience of having to travel back and forth to get permission for GCS isn&#39;t worth it when I can go elsewhere and avoid that hassle.

I&#39;ve already decided on Ferrando, she&#39;s close to my dad&#39;s house, she has extremely good reviews, and what I&#39;ve seen of her work is amazing. Haven&#39;t booked a consultation yet (and probably won&#39;t until I can get back to my laser place). I had booked a consultation with Avanessian at one point (that would have happened this September) but I cancelled when I realized Ferrando was accepted by my insurance.

Ftm so my experience may differ.
</p>

Surgeons all have different techniques. For me, picking a surgeon came down to two consults. Other surgeons were either too far or didn‚Äôt do the techniques I wanted. There are a lot of practical considerations you need to make. Where can you afford to stay? What do you want your surgeons personality to be? Who does your insurance cover? Who can travel with you to take care of you and how far can they go? Etc.
</p>
<p>
In my consult, my surgeon went over the procedure I wanted, explained why he prefers to do it the way he does and talked about how other people do it.
</p>
<p>
He also told me that he‚Äôd be happy to have me as a patient but wouldn‚Äôt be offended if I picked someone else.  Just because you have a consult with someone doesn‚Äôt mean you need to sign up for surgery with them.

You can get in with McGinn MUCH faster than the other top surgeons because she does not accept insurance. That‚Äôs what I did. (I was able to get reimbursed by my insurance in the end.)
</p>
<p>
Much like you, I scheduled a consult with BBL but was unsatisfied with how far out it was. (Ting never got back to me.)
</p>
<p>
So, I also scheduled a consult with McGinn, which I could get just a couple months out. After that consult I felt great about her, and I scheduled my surgery. That was about a year ago. I had my surgery four months ago. I‚Äôd still be 18 months out for surgery if I had gone with BBL.
</p>
<p>
McGinn doesn‚Äôt do PPV, but she is consistently excellent at what she does. I am very happy with my results and experience. A big factor in that was getting it done when I did rather than waiting for years.

Admittedly that&#39;s a huge appeal of McGinn for me too. I&#39;ve been in contact with her office and discussed the option of paying cash with her secretary. It&#39;s nice that they have a flat fee that they tell you up front. I&#39;ve been a big fan of McGinn since I started researching vaginoplasty options, it&#39;s just that the peritoneal method seems more appealing to me. I&#39;ve heard Wittenberg is a lot faster than BBL in terms of initial consultation so I plan to give her a shot too.

Do not all surgerons doing it offer PPT to all their patients? That would be a huge bummer.

Yeah, not all surgeons can do this technique and of the ones that can not all will offer it unless it&#39;s a revision or you don&#39;t have enough graft material.

I don&#39;t know about BBL but all you have to do with Dr. Wittenberg is ask for it (despite what her website says)

While Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s website states the following at the top of the page for PPT:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
*Because of the unknown long-term outcomes, Dr Wittenberg currently offers Peritoneal Pull Through Vaginoplasty (PPTV) for those patients that need vaginal depth revision, who do not have enough skin for grafting, whose hair follicles have been resistant to hair removal treatments, and patients who are willing to be followed for results and outcomes of this procedure.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
at the bottom of the page, this is stated:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Patients requesting this as an initial vaginoplasty are warned that this carries potentially higher risk than penile inversion vaginoplasty with unknown long-term results.
</p>
</blockquote>

Yep. I had PPT with her in February, and I did not have any of those prerequisites. All I did was ask, and she said, &#34;you&#39;re a bit of a guinea pig, is that okay?&#34; Then I said Yes and it was a done deal

Oh that will be a huge bummer. I‚Äôve wanted to do PPT through BBL or Wittenberg but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd just wanted a regular inversion. That sucks, but I appreciate your answer.

I wish I could be more specific. If you think you want surgery in the next 3 years I&#39;d start booking consults now because it takes so long to get appointments.
