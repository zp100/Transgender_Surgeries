I&#39;ve not heard of this surgeon before. Could you tell us more about your experience? There&#39;s a list of questions people would find interesting here

He also was my surgeon for my second stage procedure (clitoroplasty and labiaplasty) with urethral revision. Amazing doctor! Did you have the surgery already with Dr. Purohit?

Dr. Meltzer. He also did an amazing job aesthetically. He does it in two stages.
</p>
<p>
But I wanted to get someone local here  for my second stage just in case I experienced any complications and/or if I needed any sort of follow up.

Who did your initial surgery and did you encounter any complications or setbacks?

Chettawut. My urethra was misplaced. I posted about it here recently. Other than that I just want construction of the posterior fourchette and some cosmetic work on the majora. Going on a consult with McGinn in a few weeks and then will decide between her and Djordjevic. Dr. Purohit was in my consult with Djordjevic and was the one who did the cystoscopy on me. I would imagine he&#39;d assist with the surgery for his own education and I would request it as well because I&#39;d rather have them both there. I still feel like McGinn would be better cosmetically, but have to ask her about her experience with urethroplasty.

Can I ask you what does it feel like when  your urethra is misplaced? Does it feel like an obstruction and its hard for you too pee? Does it take longer for you to begin urination or start your stream?  Funny you mentioned Dr. Purohit and Dr. Djordjevic because I recently had my second stage procedure at Mount Sinai with the both of them this past June. I&#39;m happy with my results that I had gotten with them(clitiroplasty and labiaplasty) but peeing is still problematic for me. It just feels that I&#39;m not completely emptying my bladder and that it feels obstructed. I&#39;ve had a couple of cystoscopy done this year and there wasn&#39;t a sign of stricture based on his findings. So that is why i wanted to ask you what symptoms you are getting from a misplaced urethra. And honestly, both Dr. Purohit and Dr. Djordjevic specializes in urology, so it made sense for me to go with them.

I&#39;m so sorry and saddened by you are going through. Can I ask if it feels constricted when you pee? Can you empty your bladder  completely or do you have to go again after you urinate?

Exactly. It feels constricted and I don’t always manage to clear my bladder leading to bladder infections.

How have you managed to urinate and empty your bladder?  For me at times, I have to &#34;air it out&#34; by self-intermittent catheterizing myself.

That’s very true! He’s a wonderful doctor and a wonderful human being. I’m very pleased with my male to female transgender bottom surgery. He’s one of the surgeons in the Mount Sinai program for transgender medicine and surgery. I’m happy you also had successful surgery and pleased with the results.❤️
