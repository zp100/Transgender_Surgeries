Definitely not normal. I had this happen to me 3 times already. Just had my 4th revision. Labia will be detached. I advise to be as still as possible. I had to learn the hard and expensive way

You don&#39;t. It will heal as long as it doesn&#39;t get infected.
</p>
<p>
2 x 20min salt baths a day minimum. Read my other comment. I had similar perineal tearing, I saw Hart 6 weeks ago. It all healed after about another week or two.

Hi, what do you mean by &#34;the hard way&#34;? How long did you stay in bed and did not move after surgery?

Bed rest for 2 weeks if you have to get a revision. I would suggest getting a catheter if possible that way you only need to get up to poop.

You may possibly be allergic to dissolvable stitches. Looks like your stitches are dissolving too fast because I can tell the other side looks like it‚Äôs wanting to open up.

I‚Äôm the same way. My doctor had to put real stitches in my labia because my body was eating the dissolvable way too fast. That finally worked

I‚Äôm told wound dehiscence in that spot occurs in 60% of gender confirmation surgeries. When I had mine I FLIPPED out on my doctor. I was so worried. Mine was a bit painful during urination as it would run along that area. Urine is sterile so there wasn‚Äôt a cause of alarm, just some meds to help with nerve pain. After about 3 months it was healed. Check back with doctor in about 3 weeks to see if silver nitrate treatments are recommended.

Just FYI urine isn&#39;t sterile and you want to avoid getting it in the separation.

This!  In a perfect world, urine is sterile- but only in the bladder, and not even always then.  And once it reaches the outside of the body, bacteria LOVE to grow in it so if you let urine sit on your incisions and surrounding areas without cleaning that&#39;s just begging for infection, not to mention urine scald.

this looks like it could possibly be the start of dehiscence, would be a good idea to see a doctor in person, the original surgeon should be available for examination and treatment

It&#39;s super common. That area has a lot of tension in it, hence wound separation.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s only an issue if it gets infected. It is at high risk of infection if you don&#39;t take very good care of it.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise though, it will heal totally normally by secondary intention.

This is completely normal. I had it. It&#39;s all healed totally fine.
</p>
<p>
Talk to your surgeon about it, not Reddit.
</p>
<p>
I went with Hart also.
</p>
<p>
IT&#39;S FINE STOP LISTENING TO PEOPLE ON REDDIT WHO AREN&#39;T MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND TALK TO YOUR SURGEON.
</p>
<p>
Edit:
</p>
<p>
Probably should have mentioned.
</p>
<p>
Salt bath the area 2 x 20min every day for at least two weeks. Whether a sitz bath or full bath. I found sitz baths annoying as fuck but required whilst I was away from home and have been having proper baths since I&#39;m back.
</p>
<p>
Use a decent amount of salt with tepid water.
</p>
<p>
Edit 2:
</p>
<p>
A cup of salt for a sitz bath.
</p>
<p>
Also, rinse it LIGHTLY every time you urinate or dilate with just water. Do not touch the area where possible.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you wash thoroughly after a bowel movement and don&#39;t accidentally get any flecks of fecal matter near this area.
</p>
<p>
DO NOT STICK A DILATOR IN THIS ACCIDENTALLY.
</p>
<p>
Hair dry the area completely after every time you rinse it or every sitz bath etc.
</p>
<p>
If it starts looking red, angry, etc. Contact a medical professional. If you&#39;re still in Canberra, the hospital. You may need either topical or oral / IV antibiotics.
</p>
<p>
This is all fine, but you do NOT want it to get infected, which is the major risk with separation like this. It will heal fine as long as it doesn&#39;t get infected.
