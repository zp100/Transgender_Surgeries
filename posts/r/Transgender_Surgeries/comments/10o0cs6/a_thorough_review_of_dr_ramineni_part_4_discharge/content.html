This little series of mine is going to be highlighting my experiences choosing Dr. Ramineni as my surgeon. My goal is to provide as much info as possible so that people can make an informed decision towards whether they would or wouldn&#39;t want him to be their surgeon. Especially since he does roughly 135 vaginoplasties a year, but not many people highlight their journeys from going with him. This part will be focusing on my meeting with Dr. Ramineni one last time before heading home, meeting with a pelvic floor PT, and having my catheter bag switched, the drive home, and my first night back home!

</p>

Like I brought up in my previous post sleeping through the night was a lot more of a challenge without the epidural in anymore.  So I really had to rely on the nurses to cycle me through my pain meds on rotation so that I could sleep.
</p>
<p>
I met with Dr. Ramineni around 8am and he wanted to check in one last time before I got discharged. We talked about what I should do the next couple days while home before my follow-up appointment. Then we chatted about what all to expect during the follow-up. Once again Dr. Ramineni just had such a way of making me feel relieved. He knew I was in a lot more pain without my epidural. So we just talked pain management at home and reassured me that this is the peak of my discomfort and that it will be subsiding. Ik some people feel like he rushs talks. He may talk fast, but he always makes sure to talk me through anything I bring up and he never seemed offended if I interrupted him to bring something else up. He made a joke about not feeling rushed to leave something like &#34;and this isn&#39;t a hotel or anything; there is no check out time! Whenever you feel like you are ready to leave and your ride is here just let the nurses know&#34; then he giggled and said his goodbyes.
</p>
<p>
After our meeting I met with my nurse and we talked about all the things for my discharge. She was a little confused on whether my catheter was being removed or if it was just the bag changing. But once that cleared up she took some time getting the discharge papers in order. Because she didn&#39;t know when I was leaving she kept being hesitant towards giving me strong pain meds. I wish I had been able to get Dilaudid after my meeting with Dr.R cus my pain was starting to increase. She gave me a low does of Oxy around 6 am, but I wasn&#39;t released until like 3pm. It was the first time I had to really sit in my pain for a while.
</p>
<p>
I had my meeting with the pelvic floor physical therapist an hour or so after my meeting with Dr. Ramineni. She gave a lot of great tips for how to work on my pelvic floor muscles and how to poop since I hadn&#39;t yet. She showed me some yoga positions to try and stretch and relax my pelvic floor. She also had me get into the butterfly position which I&#39;ll be using for dilation. This shit was hard AF since I hadn&#39;t really bent or stretched my legs too much.
</p>
<p>
It took my mom a few hours to be ready for me to head out of the hospital because of a zoom meeting she forgot about. But once I was ready to leave the nurses gave me sooo many supplies to take home with me. I had become good gal pals with one of the nurses and she just gave me soooo much shit and helped show my BFF how to drain my catheter leg bag. Then I got dressed and into the wheelchair to get scooted to the main entrance.
</p>
<p>
I slowly got into my mom&#39;s car; you have to be careful on how you get into the car after SRS so it took me a few minutes. The nurse, my mom, and my BFF all were helping support my weight at different points as I slowly got into the front seat. I sat on a rolled up blanket that was shaped into a U at the request of my pelvic floor PT. I had to lean back the chair a good bit and stretch out my legs then I braced my arms against the center console and the door so I wouldn&#39;t wiggle while the car was moving.
</p>
<p>
Then began the uncomfy ride back home. I luckily only live 25-40min from the hospital (25min that day thank God). My mom was trying her hardest to avoid pot holes, but if the car ever bounced it was
<strong>
AWFUL
</strong>
. Bracing myself stopped from wiggling and shifting pressure so that helped a lot. Once we got home they already had my bed set up so I just needed help slowly getting out of the car.
</p>
<p>
Then I shuffled to my door and took the 3 steps down to my side of the house. After which I had them empty my pee bag and set up pillows in a comfy way. Then I laid onto a pad and a doggy pad they had placed on the bed for any leaking blood. It was so nice to finally lay on a comfy bed and also to get pain meds again finally. I ate 2 delicious servings of stuffed tortellini my mom made before falling asleep.
</p>
<p>
My mom and BFF woke me up occasionally to empty my pee bag and to take more meds. My mom also went out and got a ton more pillows (for future dilation sessions) and a stool (to help pooping on the toilet). I was able to get some good sleep finally!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be stopping here for this post. I&#39;m contemplating whether I&#39;ll be squishing Sat and Sun into one post since they both will just be pretty much the same things. All leading up to my follow-up appointment on Monday. If for whatever reason one of the days is more eventful and I end up writing too much I&#39;ll split them but otherwise I&#39;ll probably just squish them together! As always I appreciate everyone that&#39;s been following along so far! And I hope everyone has a wonderful day; MUCH LOVE! üíñüíûüåàüåà

Although appreciating you probably don&#39;t feel like doing anything else and writing focuses the mind on one subject, I want to thank you from me for taking the time to write and share.  To live thru the processes vicariously via writings such as yours is so invaluable for me!  Thank You, Thank You for sharing.  And may I say I really enjoyed your writing style.

I appreciate you appreciating me! ü•πüíñ

It definitely helps provide direction to my day! Either before bed or in the early morning when I wake up I just blurb all the things about that day into my notes app. Then I take some time setting up the post talking about the previous day/days! It&#39;s been really fun being able to just get it all out. Especially during the times where I am experiencing so much pain it&#39;s nice to know I&#39;ll be able to look back at them during times I feel better. And that really helps me get through the tough points! üòä
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad you think my writing style is fun! My mom and I are big over explainers. I just end up feeling like I have to tell every detail possible and I&#39;ve definitely had people who didn&#39;t like all my tangents! üòÖ

Thank you! I&#39;m always surprised to see people like how I write things! I always feel like I go into way too much detail! üòÖ

I remember reading your posts back when I was deciding between surgeons! Your post and other people&#39;s are what drove me to pick Dr. Ramineni! That&#39;s why I&#39;m hoping I can provide detailed info for more gals and pals that are looking to go with him! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíñ
