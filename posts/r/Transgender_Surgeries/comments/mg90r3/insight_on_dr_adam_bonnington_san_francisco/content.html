Does anyone have any input and information on   Dr. Adam Bonnington work, more specifically his work with Peritoneal Pull Through, he is a doctor who is near by (near enough to travel without having to make a year of savings to pay for planes and stuff.) but i am having issues finding either examples of surgeries he has done, or reviews and i was wondering if anyone had any insight on the dr.

I consulted with him a few weeks ago. He told me he&#39;s been doing surgeries for two years, participated in around 80 vaginoplasties and and conducted 20 start to finish; of them, he&#39;s seen 30 PPTs, actively participated in 15, and conducted 5 start to finish.
</p>
<p>
From my layman&#39;s point of view he was friendly and well informed, but I personally felt I would be more comfortable going to a surgeon with more experience. His advantage, of course, is that his waitlist is extremely short at 2-3 months, as opposed to 10 for inversion or 12-14 for PPT with his mentor Wittenberg.

I believe her waitlist has exploded as of late given the increased interest in peritoneal procedures and her position as one of the most experienced people in that procedure in the States.

Yeah that makes sense, the ppt waitlist was 9 months for me (scheduled end of april now) but i thought they were seperate queues

I have surgery with him in May. I&#39;ve seen a lot of his revision work, and the parties all seem really happy. And Dr. Wittenburg is staking her reputation on him being up to snuff to her standards. So that&#39;s gotten me to feeling like I don&#39;t need to worry.

Can you schedule a meeting with him?  He may have examples he can only show in private.
