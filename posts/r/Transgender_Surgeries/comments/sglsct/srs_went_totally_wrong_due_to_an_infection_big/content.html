SRS went totally wrong due to an infection. Big clitoris looking like penis head, no hood, almost zero depth, labia majora asymmetry, too much skin everywhere, problem with pissing. 2 years after SRS, 2 revisions. I am waiting for third revision but I have lost all hope already.

U need a pair of fresh eyes on it. A new dr who will do a more drastic revision. It needs a lot of work. This is what scares me about getting mine done. But your right it‚Äôs very good that u can orgasm that‚Äôs very positive outcome.

Thank you very much. My sexulogist told me that if the skin will be modeled corectlly it will look fine and it is not a lost case. He also recommended not to reduce size of clitoris although it is bigger than usually because there is a risk of nerve damage and lose of orgasm which would be pretty shame. But he also doesn&#39;t get it why it is still so messy even after a second revision. Maybe the surgeon wants fix everything step by step DUNNO (he is not very share full) but I am already sick of urinal catheter and general anesthesia

Yes it is fascinating how each vagina (cis or trans) is unique. I am gonna keep the big clit, because bigger clitoris means bigger erotogenous zone and also I don&#39;t want to risk I will loose sensation, but it really needs to be more hidden maybe by hood or tucked more inside because sometimes the clit gets rubbed, turned red and swelled...I stopped waering jeans and started to wear softer and more quality underwear and this helps...some vaginal cream is also good

Yeah maybe just get the clit surgically tucked in more so it‚Äôs hidden better without reducing the size at all. And yes it‚Äôs still way messy for a revision, but I can see it looking amazing because u have a lot to work with which is a good thing. I do think a new dr who‚Äôs 5 stars with revisions is best choice, but u do what u feel is right.‚ù§Ô∏è

You have right with the skin. When I try stretch the skin many ways it starts to look pretty like real vulva...the tucking clitoris inside could be more risky than recreation of clit hood, I think, but I will see what options I will have when I visit different surgeons

could be because you had an infection once they want to go slowly, not srs related but my gran needed a bunch of op&#39;s but she had an infection on the first one so they changed the whole plan after and made some OP&#39;s less invasive.
</p>
<p>
just a guess.
</p>
<p>
either way tbh it looks like there&#39;s plenty to work with still for revisions and such, it&#39;s not as far off as you think, bit of nip and tuck and will look fine.

Yes I think you are right, some doctor told me the same...So maybe the surgeon is careful now, but he did not say anything like that...I was promised that clitoris will be hidden after second revision and when I asked him why my clitoris is still naked he told me &#39;I did not do anything with that&#39;. When he told me I was speechless. Communication with some doctors is pain in the ass

There are definitely vulvas that have this much skin on the labia, but if she is not happy with it, she should have labia that she is happy with. This much skin on the labia can be annoying, or downright painful, when it gets pinched by your underwear elastic or gets sweaty and rubs together causing chafing. If cis women can get labia surgery, so can she.
</p>
<p>
Asymmetry is totally normal, though, and it would look more like surgically created if she opts to get them as symmetrical as possible. And if that&#39;s the look she&#39;s going for, cool. Again, lots of women have cosmetic labia surgery, so no shame in it

Normally I would agree but this does not look like any typical variation of vulva, it is clearly poor work on the surgeon&#39;s part.

There is also a possibility of filling labia majora by fat or hyaluronic acid because the labias are empty.

Yes that‚Äôs a good idea for sure. Less saggy. I wanted to ask, How do your orgasms feel compared to prior to surgery? I‚Äôm very curious on that. Is it less intense since most of the prior organ is gone? Where do u feel the pleasure exactly during orgasm?

Well, after HRT my libido and orgasm got less intense. After surgery the intension of orgasm has not changed but I like it more this way than before...more relaxed. Clitoris is my only one erotogenous zone...second one is prostate but my vagina depth does not allow me to feel it. Clit is very sensitive so I get horny very fast when touching it. The pleasure during orgasm is hard to explain where exactly I feel it...it is like whole area and inside...not just the clitoris if it makes sense :D I think that I feel pleasure from rests of erectal tissues ...they also get bigger during it

Ok that makes a lot of sense actually. Thank u for the explanation! My dr is ready to do my vagina now, but I‚Äôm scared of things like botches, And never ever being able to experience an orgasm again for the rest of my life‚Ä¶.  Know it‚Äôs like 75-80 % can orgasm but I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be the 25% that won‚Äôt. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

If the same dr did the revisions I would go somewhere else hun! Go to someone who is a master at revisions, who will fix this once and for all! That dr already had 2 chances and still failed. Go somewhere else where they r better!

Must be the surgeon who can do the revision specialized in geneder-affirming procedures or may I seek some aesthetic plastic surgery clinic? Because it only needs some aesthetic corrections.

I honestly recommend Dr. Ivan Manero in Barcelona at IM Gender Clinic.  He is known as an expert on repairing situations much worse than yours.  It seems like most of your issue is cosmetic.
</p>
<p>
He did my colo-vaginoplasty two months ago and it was a great experience and outcome.

Sometimes I have regret thoughts that I should go somewhere else and I had also cca 1 year post surgery depression. But when I think about it all I am happy that I had this chance to underwent this surgery.

Before SRS I was facing everyday humiliation due to fact that I had &#39;M&#39; letter in my pappers and from this period I have got PTSD - this surgery or sterilization is condition for official sex change and name change   and lots of MTF and FTM surgeries were cancelled because of covid19 restriction...
</p>
<p>
I was telling myself that I need SRS ASAP for my name change assuming that the result could went wrong. Now I know how it was desperate and I was just attracting negative thoughts - maybe it was the reason why the surgery was fail because I was not mentally prepared yet.
</p>
<p>
My girlfriend told me that she loves me for who I am and not for what I have between legs and I do not need vagina to be a woman.
</p>
<p>
I still have orgasm and I am sexually active although I will never have that experience which cis women or some trans women can have. I love my dream name and thanks to official sex change I have no longer problem with finding a job or being in society in general.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I am very sad and hopeless by the result but I am happier now than before :)

It&#39;s awful to be coerced into surgery by the state. That needs to change.

During the surgery I have lost a lots of blood. I had very big swelling which pulled skin out. After first dilatation I have got e coli infection which could not be healed for long time and it caused tissue  dehinescence and necrosis. I spent whole month in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
First revision should fix clitoris, which was dislocated (dehinescence affected clitoris too), but after that revision my vagina has shrank (skin inside vagina fused together) and because of covid 19 I had to wait 1 year to second revision.
</p>
<p>
After second revision depth in my vagina was restored but not much. I have cca 3-4 cm depth. Next problem has occurred - when I pee, urine flows in weird angle and sometimes it flows on my left leg.
</p>
<p>
Soon I will have third surgery, which may fix the urinal problem, remove redundancy skin, and create clitorial hood from it.
</p>
<p>
But I am scared that it still will not look good and I do not know how many revision I will have to undergo. Should I considered another surgeon maybe in abroad?
</p>
<p>
Surgery was done by Jiri Vesely in Brno (Czech republic)
</p>
<p>
PS: I can have orgasm which is only one positive aspect
</p>
<p>
PPS: sorry for bad english

I think you should look at surgeons for revision outside of Czech Republic, and possibly outside of Europe.
</p>
<p>
Have you seen the other results for your surgeon? This is the only photo I&#39;ve seen.

I was considering Germany or Austria. Of course Thailand would be best but I would have to wait many years to earn money for it.
</p>
<p>
It is quite paradox but there is very little information about SRS in Czechia. There are some (archaic) articles of people who underwent SRS, yes, but no photos from Brno. Some photos from Prague looks good but I have heard really tragedic stories about people who got organ damage or their whole vagina fell apart. It is said that the method which is used in Prague is very outdated.

If it is at all possible, I would look at one of the doctors around Berlin/Potsdam, like Dr. Schaff. I‚Äôm not 100% sure exactly how it‚Äôll work between EU countries on whether or not you‚Äôd have to pay, but I would look into it

It is not a very pleasing aesthetically or an accurate neovagina, but whoever did that at least got you healed (from what we can see) and left a lot of excess tissue that can help on a proper reconstruction.

Yes I guess the healing was more important then anything else and it is good bacuse the necrosis could do more damage.

You and I must live in parallel universes, because I&#39;ve written almost the same exact things about my experience. I don&#39;t have significant depth issues, but everything else you mention is baked into my experience --even the 3 revisions. I even see similarities in our outcomes.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I&#39;m sorry you suffered, and you have every right to feel traumatized after your experience. I would imagine finding trust in a surgeon will be half the battle for you. It sure was for me.
</p>
<p>
Have you reached out to the gender program in Ghent, Belgum? I know they do a lot of fellowships for gender surgical training for doctors all over the world.
</p>
<p>
Here are some conference websites from 2021 conferences listing surgeons and resources, including the surgeons at Ghent. You might find what you&#39;re looking for. These are good examples of the kind of education and training that are happening in Transgender Healthcare. Sometimes we get so focused on the handful of surgeons or medical resources in front of us that we lose sight of all the people working towards a better understanding of our needs and access to care.

Wow thank you very much for the links. Before SRS it did not even occur to me to searching different resources from abroad...the only two available surgeons in my country are merly in retirement age...so I thought they will have a lots of experience and I was determined for one of them. I think some older generation doctors believe they are best in what they are doing so they do not participate in such events to improve their methods... I guess

I&#39;m coming up on my second revision, and listen, this can look bad but its really fixable!  some srs results include much wider majora with much more stretched out skin, and theres not much you can do about that. yours is just a matter of finding a good surgeon who can remove skin, and define labia minora. Clitoris could be a bit of an aesthetic issue, especially if you&#39;re not willing to reposition or reduce it due to risk of sensation. I don&#39;t know much about European surgeons, but Dr Blueblond in nyc and dr satterwhite in california are known to be good at revisions

Thank you for giving some hope :) I have checked the both doctors - they are transgender plastic surgeons and now I am also curious if I can visit someone who is specialized in aesthetic plastic surgery only because it looks like this is just a cosmetics problem. Is it a good idea?

no, thats not a good idea. I thought that once too. plastic surgeons who aren&#39;t trans specialists don&#39;t know how to work with this material, and the nerves are in different places in tw, and the structures different. Yes, maybe there exists a cis person with similar issues, but even then, the skin material is different, the structures different, and the bloodvessels and nerves are in different places too. you really need a trans specialist who knows how to work with that, and a trans specialist is also more familiar with the issues you have (large prominent clit, large undefined labia) that are more common for trans women, but very rare for cis people.

I am so sorry to see This happen to women. I hope you find a good surgeon to give you a better asthsic your happy with. Just remember your not alone many cis women even have asthic vaginoplasty because their born like that. The skin looks to be healthy now witch is a good sign that it can be fixed.
