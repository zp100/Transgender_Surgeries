<p>
Has anyone in Australia had any experience with Dr Gideon Blecher, either in Australia or overseas?  My Urology dr/surgeon suggested to me today during an appointment that Dr Gideon is one of the surgeons who is actually performing GRS here in Melbourne Australia, but I&#39;ve not seen his name appear in the subreddit wiki.
</p>
<p>
A quick google shows his name was mentioned in a paper dating May 2020 which discusses GRS, but that&#39;s it.
</p>
<p>
I was wondering if anyone has used him yet, and if so, if they have any photos of the results that they might like to share?
</p>
<p>
Thanks

I was informed by his rooms of the same, that he&#39;s planning on doing vaginoplasty but not started yet and was planning for later this year or into next year before he started looking at it.

So just an update.
</p>
<p>
I received an email reply from Dr Gideon..   (
<a href="https://drblecher.com" rel="nofollow">drblecher.com
</a>
)
</p>
<p>
As of 14th Sept 2020, he has not yet performed bottom surgery on any patients, however he is currently being mentored in vaginoplasty/labioplasty by another surgeon in Melbourne.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m guessing at some point, he will be performing the surgery, but as it stands at the moment, he has not yet..

I added him to the wiki, but basically couldn&#39;t find anything on him. I&#39;d say he has very little experience with this.

Thanks! Yeah I&#39;ve not been able to find much either, but I&#39;ve reached out to his office via email. I&#39;ll post some updates when I hear back.

Can you update this post with whatever you find out. I’ve linked it already in the wiki so people will see whatever you write.
</p>
<p>
There’s no way he has much experience and even if he did there’s no reviews of him. Kind of risky. Why are you interested vs other surgeons?

Will do.
</p>
<p>
I was just enquiring whether anyone had used him as another surgeon who I was seeing about a urology issue advised that this Dr Gideon was doing the operations in Melbourne now but had studied and worked overseas for some time previously.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve kinda had my thoughts on a surgeon overseas as I wasn&#39;t impressed with Dr Ives&#39; work locally and if there was a surgeon who was as good as some of the Thailand surgeons and i could have it done locally rather than going to Thailand, this would be worth looking into. So I figured I&#39;d see if I could find out more. I guess they need to start somewhere too. Not saying I would go with him without knowing more info though either....

If he’d done much overseas there would be should be mentions of his name. He probably mention it himself. He may have done some, but bear in mind the thai surgeons you’re probably thinking of have done a lot. Suporn’s retiring at about 3000.
</p>
<p>
I’d think Andy Ives is fairy typical on penile inversion.

Yeah this is true too.

I&#39;ll be honest, i&#39;ve seen some of Andy Ives&#39; work, I don&#39;t think i&#39;d personally be happy with the results..  But of course, that&#39;s just me..  I&#39;m sure others have been super happy with his work..

Its easy enough to go to Thailand and you can be pretty certain  of what you&#39;re getting there. There&#39;s heaps in the wiki on Thai surgeons.

Yep, I have already made a decision on a Thai surgeon if I decide to go to Thailand for bottom surgery.  :)
</p>
<p>
But of course, I want to do my due diligence and check on surgeons in Australia first.  :)  My preference would be to have it done here if the work meets my visual requirements, just as its easier for touch-ups or fixes afterwards if there are any issues.

He must be learning from Andy Ives, so that’s what you’d get, only without much experience. Who are you looking at in Thailand?
