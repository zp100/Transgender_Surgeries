The surgeon isn‚Äôt going to care if your like 1 or 2 over the BMI requirement but if you way over it then they‚Äôll fully refuse you

Just had a look at your pics- you&#39;re absolutely gorgeous! Saw your pre-FFS pic too and you honestly didn&#39;t look your BMI was above 35!
</p>
<p>
You probably did calculate it right, but did you? Finding it incredibly hard to believe! :) I&#39;d have placed you around 30 at the very most!

True. The reason surgeons require lower BMI is to increase an easier recovery. If skin is under too much tension, it will often result in dehiscence or necrosis. Those are never fun, especially with dialating. Try exercising and building endurance, you will need it through your surgery. And eat nutritious. I recommend something like an anti-inflammatory diet. You‚Äôll want to give your body the easiest bounce back. And remember, you got this!

My BMI was over 35 with Stiller and he didn‚Äôt say a thing to me about it.  It probably played some part in how my recovery went but I am 6-months on and doing fine.

I am going for surgery with Dr. Stiller soon. They just sent paperwork for surgery prep and it mentions BMI. It says you need a preop check up with you GP. If your BMI is over 35 they  say the surgery will be rescheduled. If you are just getting you consult you have time though. I had my consultation in July of last year and my surgery is in April.

Just had mine a week ago with Dr.Ramineni in DC. 5&#39;5 340lbs I&#39;ll let you run the calculator üòÅ
</p>
<p>
Most of the doctors in this field aren&#39;t real allies, and others aren&#39;t as confident in their skills as they would seem.
</p>
<p>
Ramineni had me in and out in a little over two 2 hours, and my energy levels far exceed my thinner peers. Oh, and I&#39;m completely caring for myself by myself post-operative.
</p>
<p>
If you want to lose weight for you, then get it, but the BMI requirement on its face isn&#39;t based on anything of merit. And I&#39;m definitely fucking proof of that.
