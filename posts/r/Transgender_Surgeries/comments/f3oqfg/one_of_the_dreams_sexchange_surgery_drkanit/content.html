My story in this letter. A review and show of pride. One of the dreams, a dream in a boy&#39;s life. No prior knowledge, no experience with surgery, but I am a person who loves being beautiful and show love since childhood. Knowing from childhood that &#34;how I am is to be a woman&#34;. Although on the outside, I have to wear pants. But inside I knew myself that I liked playing with girls things. I wanted to wear a skirt or dress. When I grow up, I think that I will give my life to my good fortune. At home, I understand what I am.
</p>
<p>
I Have thinking that I intend, before the age of 25, I must change sex from male to female. So,I began studying how to get started with sex change. Along time passed since I started dressing up as a woman, eating hormones, etc. Until the day I decided to change sex completely.
</p>
<p>
I am Filipino. I have researched information about the process of having a sex change procedure from male to female. What i wanted was not just the cutting off of the penis, but I want to have the appearance and experience complete sexual feelings. I researched many Thai doctors. But I have decided to choose Dr Kanit, a plastic surgeon in Thailand. I began correspondence and finally I got an email to make an appointment with Dr. Kanit to perform the surgery. So I traveled to Bangkok to get an operation with Dr. Kanit. This was my first trip to Thailand. I arrived 2 days before the operation day. I made an appointment to visit the clinic to consult. I listened to Doctor Kanit, speaking briefly about how it would be done. The doctor was kind and slowly explained everything. I repeatedly asked questions, he was happy to answer all of them. After talking with Dr. Kanit I was excited and waiting for the day to change to becoming a female. I became even more excited when I had to prepare to
</p>
<p>
have a certificate from the mental health doctor which proved whether to be ready to be a woman. I have 1 certificate ready to come from my country and 1 more certificate from Thailand. Dr. Kanit suggested to me to ask in Thailand. Which the clinic helped coordinate and took me to see a psychiatric doctor to request a medical certificate. The request process is not very complicated.
</p>
<p>
Now, the day of waiting had arrived. I was excited and secretly slightly scared. In preparation the clinic staff recommended that I prepare the digestive system by eating soft food, so I could empty my bodies waste, and 2 days before the surgery day have laxatives to clear the intestines. Meaning that I had to run to the bathroom very often. When it&#39;s time to enter the operating room, it&#39;s even more exciting to see all the tools and equipment. Then the doctor asked me to inhale the anesthetic and talked to suggest that I could go to sleep in a shot time. I was unconscious until the surgery was complete. I was conscious at almost midnight with a saline solution, blood line and a urethra No pain, because of the pain medication. I then fell asleep until the morning. I request to show the important image !!! And I couldn‚Äôt pee.
</p>
<p>
The 2nd day after the sex reassignment surgery, I didn&#39;t have to do much. Lie on the bed, just watch TV, read all the books. On the next day, the 3rd day, I started to sit and sit beside the bed. The 4th day was the day that I waited for, because they would take out the padding stuffed in the artificial vagina and have the urine come out naturally. My knowing is it will be ok is what they say. In truth, it will be painful.
</p>
<p>
The other moment that I had endure is the insert the vagina device to keep it open. It has to be put it in to keep the right shape. It hurt a lot, I had tears but it soon passed. It went well but felt sore. After a while, I can go home after taking out the vaginal dilator and try to urinate. After getting the ok I then returned to the hotel. Which is not far from the clinic at all. So, everything seems like no problem, but after going home on the 1st day, I can urinate normally, but on the second day, I cannot urinate, so call the Maxi clinic to ask what to do.
</p>
<p>
The doctor advised me to put ice compress on the belly, but after a while, I still cannot urinate. So I called the clinic again and asked what to do? I started to get more pain and then received the advice to go back to the clinic and the clinic&#39;s car came to pick me up. I was very worried, why it was like this! but I received a good explanation. As far as I can remember, there may be swelling around the urethra. Fix by putting the urethra back in for 3-5 days and taking the urine bag back to the hotel. Until the day of the follow up at the clinic.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
Then I began to take care of myself. I had to insert the dilator 4 times a day, morning, afternoon, evening and before bed each time for 20-30 minutes. Also had to clean the outside wounds, I could only use baby soap to clean the outside. There is no smell inside, I just used water mixed with Dettol and used a squirter device to clean the inside, just in the mornings and evenings. After a month, the doctor asked me to add from dilator size S to size M. A little pain came again. However, there is a small trick, so use number S first and then number M every time.

</a>
</p>
<p>
Throughout the period after surgery Everything went very well. Will have only the first part of the urethra, but now I can pee normally. I had spent 25 days in Thailand and then I returned to the Philippines. Go back to take care of myself at my home.
</p>
<p>
Now, over the past 1 year, I have actually used it and the feeling is true. I myself do not know how to say that it is a dream. The feeling of a man who wants to be a full woman now complete. I was not disappointed.
</p>
<p>
In return, the effort and the fact that I had to be diligent, made it possible to obtain both internal knowledge and shape through the outside and the care from the clinic staff as well because after the surgery there are many questions. I had my concerns for the first period after surgery. My mental condition was a bit of a worry.  But now that I am happy knowing everything is what I wanted and done the way I wanted.
</p>
<p>
It is therefore I would like to share my experiences for my friends to read.

Giving me second thoughts about having the surgery.  Your vagina looks great.  How is the sex if you don&#39;t mind me asking.  Is it pleasurable?

It&#39;s amazing how natural you look, now you&#39;re outside matches your soul as it should be. Good luck and may your life be full of happiness and love.I am pretty much just asking about others experiences with Thailand surgeons why you went where you did or didn&#39;t go to a certain surgeon.

I have searched for a surgeon in Thailand. It took 2 years to study and search for information before making a decision. And I chose Dr. Kanit because she is a plastic surgeon in Thailand. And the price is not very expensive And I saw a review on Reddit that there was a feeling Complete composition And I made the wrong decision. His staff takes care. Answer my question very well.

I have a plan to go to Thailand for surgery with Dr.Kanit in the coming May as well. But I have to postpone my surgery first Because of the corona virus situation during this time, I&#39;m quite sorry. But I will definitely go to sex reassignment surgery with Dr. Kanit Thailand Because I saw your review.
