Looks like he has changed his suture technique for the better ?
</p>
<p>
The angle of the cut is a lot less diagonal / unnatural on yours and will look a lot more like labia majora than mine do.
</p>
<p>
Also the stitches are very smooth on yours and a nice clean line. Mine and others that I have seen have left bulging tissue between stitches and awfull scars that are completely unnatural.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask what day of the week this was ? Were you first in surgery or a later one ? Private or NHS ?
</p>
<p>
Congratulations, yours looks great.

Hmm I was wondering about this too. I‚Äôve been chatting with someone who had it on the same day as me and they said they have his more typical PI suture scars. So I‚Äôm honestly not sure? I think I‚Äôm just quite lucky in how they‚Äôve healed. Also I think some of the swelling is hiding the scars a bit in the photo but still.
</p>
<p>
I do feel for you, I‚Äôve seen your posts before and I hope you‚Äôre alright. Do you have any revisions in the pipeline? Regardless I hope everything works out for you, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had to suffer so much ‚ù§Ô∏è

It was Thursday the 28th of July, and I was last, at 5pm I believe. I paid privately

Thanks. I&#39;m seeing Ms Rashid next month and really hoping she will help me. I just can&#39;t stand seeing what he left there knowing that he touched it without making an effort like he obviously did for you.
</p>
<p>
Good luck on your recovery x

Once a week at 16 weeks ?
</p>
<p>
I still have to do it every day at 9 months or it takes half hour to get the bloody thing in and it&#39;s seriously painful üò≠

I think I‚Äôm definitely at the luckier end of the scale.
</p>
<p>
I was very active from day 2-3 post-op and I think that‚Äôs relevant. Most people aren‚Äôt mobile and taking walks outside Parkside at that point but I was going stir crazy in bed and had visitors who would encourage me and want to take me out.

Only cause they say to go down to two dilations a day around 3 months/when it is easy to put in.. but it‚Äôs already quite easy for me, it takes 5 minutes to put it in and I have no pain or anything. I‚Äôve emailed parkside to check it‚Äôs okay to go down to 2 this early but I‚Äôve not had anything back yet

If it takes 5 minutes to put your dialator in, well in my experience i got my 5 minutes down to less than 1 minute, maybe you might work on that?

Hey obviously I&#39;m not a gender nurse but I did have my surgery about 3.5 months ago with Tina Rashid. Please be careful you don&#39;t lose depth, keep a good eye on it as time goes on. I can only speak for myself but I generally consider less than 2 minutes to insert as fairly easy, and was generally around a minute for the first month.
</p>
<p>
I started on the green dilator a few weeks ago and that was taking 5 minutes or so at the beginning and I felt that was quite a long time.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;re awful at replying to emails it&#39;s definitely worth giving them a reminder! I suspect they&#39;ll be ok as long as you&#39;re not losing depth. I take photos of my depth at the end of each dilation so I can spot any loss easily. Maybe worth considering? For what it&#39;s worth I gained an inch or so of depth so more dilating might be worth it if depth is valuable to you x
