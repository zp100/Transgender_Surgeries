Haven&#39;t had surgery yet but that&#39;s reported here often. People report it calming down eventually. I have read experiences up to a year before its really, fully healed. And people are usually surprised because I don&#39;t think anyone really thought healing could take a year.

If you have a clitoral Hood it can help a lot to rub on that instead of directly on the clitoris. Mine was super sensitive for like 8 months, it&#39;s calmed down a bit but often times I&#39;ll have to stimulate with no chance of orgasm to desensitize it then come back to try again after a short break.

I absolutely love how sensitive my clit is. I had my surgery almost six years ago (March 2017) with Rachel and Dr Zhao at NYU Langone Hospital and I have had no issues with clitoral or penetrative orgasms.
