Mind if I ask what type of incision you had? I’m trying to figure out the safest all around incision because I don’t know what type of vaginoplasty I intend to have yet.

What does that mean? I was more curious about it in terms of location. Like midline on the scrotum or inguinal.

There&#39;s two different kinds, simple and a more invasive one where they clear out everything. There&#39;s no advantages to the latter, only extra risk and complications for trans women, even if you get GRS later

I had mine in 2010?  2011 maybe?
</p>
<p>
The skin will shrink over time.  My surgeon knew I was thinking about SRS and so he left it, but he offered to take it if I had wanted him too.  Tell your doc what you want.
</p>
<p>
I went out to breakfast at a family style restaurant after my orchi.  For real.  I hadn’t had breakfast before we went in and I was hungry.  Then back to my hotel room, I had a nap, then went for Chinese food, then went to my mother-in-laws house and fixed a light switch.
</p>
<p>
The following day I stopped taking pain pills, and rode in the car about 6 hours home (my wife drove).  I was fine.
</p>
<p>
The second day after I was painting my living room.
</p>
<p>
You will be bruised BADLY - but that is about the worst of the pain.  There is a bit of pain changing the dressing and the first shower is a bit of a chore, but you will be fine.
</p>
<p>
I was back to work (standing all day at a retail gig) after a week.
</p>
<p>
There will be quite a bit of swelling - don’t be dismayed that nothing seems smaller right away.  The swelling, like the bruising will take some time to go away completely.
</p>
<p>
It really is a walk in the park.

can I ask what the rough timeframe was for your scrotal skin to shrink? I really wish my surgeon had gotten rid of mine but he said he just doesn&#39;t do that procedure in case anyone wants GRS later, even though I told everyone who would listen I don&#39;t. hoping that one day i&#39;ll be smooth but it&#39;s been 9 months with little to no change and I&#39;m worrying.

I can’t really tell you - but it isn’t over night.  It probably depends partly on age.  I imagine if you are younger it happens faster.
</p>
<p>
I certainly didn’t see it happen quickly, but one day I just realized it had happened.  But we are talking about years - not days or weeks.  Maybe 3 years?

I agree with what Michellealyssa has to say. The cut was right down the seam. No problems, up and around the next day. Back to work 4 days later. I will say this tho, don’t touch it or try to feel where the orbs of agony (to quote another poster) were at. Leave it alone until it has healed up. As to the extra skin, you could do what I thought of later and have the surgeon cut it off and give it to you, send it out to a tanner and have a nice coin purse or wallet made out of it!! It wouldn’t do for a cell phone cover because phone sizes are always changing.

Omgosh grooossss 😂😂 imagine explaining your wallet to someone who&#39;s like, &#34;that&#39;s an interesting leather wallet, where&#39;d you get it?&#34; 😝
</p>
<p>
On a serious note, it&#39;s good to know the recovery is short - when you say not to touch it, how soon do think I can have a shower afterwards? A day or two?

Congratulations on getting a date. It is one of the best things I have done in my transition.
</p>
<p>
I had my orchiectomy over a year ago. I had a simple orchiectomy with a small incision in the scrotum. The surgeon left all the skin and closed the incision with a few stitches that dissolved after a couple weeks. My skin is not a bother now and I can tuck much better now than before.
</p>
<p>
I had my my surgery on a Wednesday and I was walking pretty well the same day. I was off pain meds by Friday and back at work on Monday.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with your surgery and let me know if I can answer any other questions.

I had my orchiectomy with Dr.Dulin in texas about 3 weeks ago. Mine was with the cost of a simple bilateral one but done through the method of an inaugural one, with the incisions about an inch above the groin area and one to the left and right.
</p>
<p>
I was told by the doctor and all the nurses that the pain and recovery is either a kick in the stomach and overall kinda rough or its a breeze. I guess it just depends on your pain tolerance and how your body reacts to the procedure. For me personally, the first day was pretty rough. I had a later surgery time around 3 pm so when I got home around 5 I went right to bed and felt a little better whenever I woke up. Around the 3 days was probably the worst since that is when I stop taking my pain meds. However I was up and around for the entirety of my recovery time. Unless your recovery time is SUPER bad you shouldn&#39;t need to be in bed for maybe a day or 2. I was off of hormones for 2 weeks before and 1 week after.
</p>
<p>
If you want GRS down the line you need to make sure your surgeon is on the same page as you for that. It would be terrible to wake up and have no useable skin down there because the doctor thought you wanted something you didn&#39;t.

That sounds like another type of GCS. Like zero depth vaginoplasty.

Congratulations! Just a heads up: swelling generally goes down quickly but not always. Just be prepared that it could take upwards of a few months to completely subside if you develop a hemotoma.

I didn&#39;t have much pain past day two, just like mild soreness. But the swelling, was very visible, there was also a lot of bruising. It basically felt like one got left behind by accident, it was more distressing then anything else. But from I&#39;ve heard this is not common most women have a much quicker recovery. Compression underwear was helpful as tucking was not tolerable for several weeks but afterward was easier then ever.

Congratulations on your surgery date. I posted some lessons learned from my orchie,

. Aside from the complications due to being the first transgender patient they operated on, I’ve never looked back. The surgery was a mid-line incision. I needed only a few days off work and healed in about two weeks. Make sure you discuss with your surgeon about sectioning the cords as high as possible so they retreat back up into the inguinal canals during the healing process. Once they retreat, you won’t have to worry about them again ❣️ You got this! 🤗s

I had an orchiectomy via midline incision 1.5 years ago. I took two weeks off work. The first 2-3 days were pretty sore. I had a manageable throb of pain which I managed with basic acetaminophen. Pain in my lower stomach made me walk doubled over. I spent about 3 days in bed walking around my apartment only when I needed to and sleeping whenever I got tired. Taking my compression garment made it much better! By day 6-7 I was able to walk a little more than a mile every morning to get a breakfast sandwich and coffee. The second week I worked from home, but definitely could have gone into the office. I worried about dried blood sticking everything together down there. I put antibiotic gel on the incision site until it was neat.
</p>
<p>
Now I think I still have all the same amount of skin, it just hangs higher. I can find my scar, but I don’t think anyone else could without knowing to look for it.

Unless you specifically request a scrotectomy they leave the material alone. Make sure you get a radical orchiectomy. Definitely mention that you want vaginoplasty later on. You will be able to walk but it will be like a waddle. Sleep a lot, drink water, and take your painkillers!

That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard of a &#39;radical&#39; orchi, how does that differ from a simple bilateral one? I tried to google it and I think it&#39;s just another name for the standard procedure?

Radical meaning root, they take everything out instead of just the testicles. Also you are left with two little scars on your mons pubis instead of a scar on the scrotum.

Good to know, I don&#39;t thiiiink I can ask for a radical operation but I think a high-cut simple should be good. It sounds like I&#39;ll have to deal with the skin, oh well. 🤷‍♀️

&#34;What happens to the excess skin afterward?&#34;
</p>
<p>
It will still be there. Eventually it will shrink. The surgeons wont &#34;tuck&#34; it or anything, the body will do that on its own.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Will I be able to walk&#34; - I walked out of the doctors office. A little bit of dull achy pain but nothing tylenol/motrin couldnt handle. Key is: make sure to rest the day of. :)

I had my orchi on a Thursday, flew back to my hometown on Friday, was at work on Monday.

I had a bilateral orchiectomy in 2007. If you plan on GRS in the future, you
<em>
NEED
</em>
to have your scrotal skin saved. In most cases, it&#39;s used to help the formation of the labia. After the orchie, it&#39;s basically like an empty bag. After an orchie, tucking is just as easy, if not easier. It took about a month to recover well enough to work again. Full healed within 2 or 3 months, but I still took it easy for a while. I highly and specifically recommend a
<em>
bilateral
</em>
orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
Compared to GRS, an orchiectomy is a walk in the park. Trust me, been through it all. Old n trans :P

I got my orchie through internet and a skilled hobbycutter without surgical background helped me because i didnt wanne wait 3 years and keep taking those toxic pills Cyproteronacetaat. I could walk tiny distances the first week but was mostly in bed, and the second week wasnt any better.  After are hmm, everytime i peed i put toiletpaper between my ladydick and the wound so the incision wound wouldnt touch my penis and run the risk to get abit moist or get infected. I think that helped alot as i didnt have any puss and only had a few drops of blood om day 1 and 2 because i  also put gauze on the wound wich caused the blood to dry up into the gauze and everytime i had to pee and pull the gauze off i ripped the wound open.  My best tip is to keep toiletpaper between the incision wound and your dick so the wound stays dry.
</p>
<p>
I Planned to be sick from work 2 weeks but ended up taking 3 and having a 4th week on a function that didnt walk much. After 1-2 months things improved rapidly. After 2 months i walked 10-20km straight. According to my 64 eunuch friend it takes a long time for your sack to shrink. It took him a year, and whenever i take a hot shower my sack becomes a soft wet hanging flap of meat. But if you dont want your sack to shrink just pull on it with your thumb when your mastrubate for example. Best of luck, hugs and kisses 🤗😘🌹

I think I waited 4 days. I seem to remember the surgeon saying wait that long. The coin purse I think is the better option. You can always carry a couple of marbles in it for fun.

If you&#39;re planning on getting additional bottom surgery as you mentioned down the line, they will leave your entire scrotum intact. There is no tucking, they won&#39;t remove any of it, it&#39;ll just be there. Essentially you will have a little mud flap.
</p>
<p>
This will shrink somewhat, but mostly it won&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
I went with a orchiectomy and scrotectomy, which means they removed both the testicles and the scrotum.
</p>
<p>
Yes, tell your surgeons everything you have planned for down there so they can do the right sort of incision.
</p>
<p>
Typically if you plan on getting full bottom surgery, you would want to make sure they do a midline incision right down the middle of your scrotum.
</p>
<p>
Some places do some laparoscopic techniques and can pull your testicles out closer to your belly button, although that leaves more obvious of a scar.

Awesome, I&#39;ll ask for a centre incision, thanks! Not terribly keen on the &#39;mud flap&#39; (also gross) but I think I can manage 💜
