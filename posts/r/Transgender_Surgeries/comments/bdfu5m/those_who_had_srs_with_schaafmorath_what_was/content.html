Asking because I&#39;m unsure on whether to go to PSC or to Suporn, and for  the latter there seem to be some fraction of women who end up with very  difficult, very painful dilation. Is this inherent to non-inversion  techniques or might it be easier with the Schaaf/Morath &#34;combined  method&#34;?

The Schaff method is very painfree. Hurts for a month until you worked your way up on the dilator size and then it&#39;s just tiresome.

This is good to hear. Actually, can I ask - I read in places that there is a &#34;placeholder&#34; you should keep inside for some time when not dilating. Is this true, and if, so, how does it work?
</p>
<p>
What I hear on dilation from Thai non-inversion surgery patients is that there is a final 2-3 cm that is the real challenge, where one has to push hard, often painfully, to be able to reach all the way in. People seem to take anywhere near 15 minutes to several hours to be able to get to full depth. Regardless of the pain aspect, is this something also in place with respect to the Schaff combined method?
</p>
<p>
Last on dilation, how often are you supposed to do it with this method, and how long does it usually take each time from start to finish?

The placeholder is a condom filled with a bandage that is put inside the neovagina inbetween dilation sessions. So whenever you are not dilating you have to wear the placeholder. That goes for 6 months.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t get problems with the last 2-3cm. For me it took like 5mins with each dilator to reach full depth. In the beginning when it is still quite painful (because of the abdominal muscles blocking the way) all you need is concentrate and relax and you keep slowly pushing it in. Took me 5mins each, like I said.
</p>
<p>
You do it 3 times a day. For a total duration of 6 months. 10mins for each dilator size. So in the beginning when you can&#39;t handle every girth yet it takes 10+10+10=30mins per day. And later on once you can fit all 3 dilators in 90mins.

Thank you, this is super useful information! And very interesting to contrast with other recovery techniques!

The placeholder is a stent. They are rare outside Europe. Search for it here

There&#39;s a bit of info on Schaff in the wiki
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_jurgen_schaff" rel="nofollow">https://old.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_jurgen_schaff
</a>
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think you can get a good answer to this question. Suporn&#39;s website says his recovery is double penile inversion, so you expect it to be more difficult and I&#39;m quite sure it is. Its one of the downsides to his technique. The worry is where its
<em>
really
</em>
bad and that appears to be a small percentage, but you can&#39;t compare that to Schaff because there&#39;s almost nothing posted about him. He could be 10 times worse and you&#39;d still never hear about it. I think I read somewhere that Schaff has only done around 300 SRS in total.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve no idea if there&#39;s something special about surgical technique that makes this happen or its common to SRS in general.
</p>
<p>
I tried to collect some information on complications, but its a bit lacking
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
Clearly there&#39;s some risk in SRS, but it can be very difficult to compare surgeons given the lack of real information.

Thank you for being helpful as always! One surreal aspect of the already-surreal trans life is how
<em>
all
</em>
our care is obscure and hard to find anything about.
</p>
<p>
I think the risk of serious issues is low in each of these cases, and the successful results all very good. It&#39;s true I can&#39;&#39;t find out reliable risk numbers well. Leaving me mostly with the options of trying to ensure I have a plan if things do go wrong.

I&#39;ve tried a couple of times looking looking up information about other types of non-trans surgery and it was actually far worse than what we face. Quite surprising really.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough information to say Schaff is good or bad. For what its worth he does have a good reputation. On the other hand I believe there are a fair number of Germans going to Thailand.
</p>
<p>
Personally I think you just have to accept some level of risk or never get anything done. I&#39;d just like to minimize it. I don&#39;t think I can take the risk of not doing anything because I know where that leads. Been there and not doing that again.

Once more, thank you! And I will definitely do something, and the processing of deciding where to go won&#39;t delay how fast the final choice will be carried out either. As it now stands, I&#39;ll meet with Schaaf and then decide whether to go there instead or stick with my Bank date, but the clock is ticking either way.

So, different people tell me opposing things about both surgeons.

Would you be willing to introduce me to these groups so I also can check? German language would work OK too. Thank you so much for answering!
