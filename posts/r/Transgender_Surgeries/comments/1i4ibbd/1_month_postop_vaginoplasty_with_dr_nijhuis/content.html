I actually like being able to see the results of the surgery a month after the operation. It looks like you‚Äôve healed pretty well in this time. I also wanted to ask how it feels after a month. Do you still hurt in that area? And aside from that, what is it like recently having something different down there now?

Of course! I am medical myself so I don&#39;t mind posting pictures when it&#39;s still this early. I felt like there wasnt a lot of material from Dutch/European surgeons especially not this early so hey, I&#39;ll be the change I want to see in the world.
</p>
<p>
I have healed pretty well! The PA at the hospital said it was quicker than average at the 3 week mark. Although that also meant I was too enthusiastic in picking back up my activities. I was walking 5k steps a day by the 3 week mark and she said that was too much and moreso reserved for 6 weeks...
</p>
<p>
Theres a little hurt when I sit down wrong or bend over, thats still hard. The biggest issue right now is a shitty pain near the front (mons pubis) and around clitoris. Which I suspect is nerve pain from the clit nerves rewiring. But I am also regaining feeling around there so yay!!

For a month out you look great. Hope your discomfort eases up soon. I‚Äôm curious, it looks like at the bottom there near your canal there is a little wound separation? If that‚Äôs what that is, I‚Äôm curious if it is painful at all or if it is bothersome. I‚Äôm just about 2 weeks post op and also had the penile inversion technique in America, and I think I may have the beginnings of some wound separation and am just curious what I could possibly encounter with it based off of other people‚Äôs experiences.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck on your healing journey and congratulations.

Yes there is some wound separation but from what I understand it is VERY common (not in the least part due to dilating putting stress on the wounds/stitches especially near the bottom where they all meet). It was way worse but I can&#39;t put a picture in the comments I think, if you want I could put it on my profile somewhere. They advised me to not move through dilators too soon to not stress the wounds too much, and to wash it clean after every toilet use.
</p>
<p>
Good luck healing!

When you stand straight up (2nd picture) everything looks fine. On the other pictures you can see that some healing is yet to happen, but I trust everything will be alright in the end. I have some questions... Would you allow me to send a pm?

Thanks so much for sharing! My girlfriend had vaginoplasty with Dr Nijhuis this week, so I&#39;m very excited to share your pictures with her tomorrow. If she looks like this in just a few weeks, I think we&#39;ll both be completely over the moon!

Best of wishes in her recovery! Nijhuis does very well and I found the nursing staff to be excellent. I hope she&#39;ll have good results in recovery too.
