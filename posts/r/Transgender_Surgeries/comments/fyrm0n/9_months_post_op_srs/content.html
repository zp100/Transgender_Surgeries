Hi all,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been super insecure about how my vagina looks, smells, and the depth. My surgeon and his team kept reassuring me that it looks okay except the clitoral hood needs to be revised (it unzipped open during recovery). BUT I KNOW THIS DOES NOT LOOK RIGHT. I feel like there&#39;s minimal inner labia and the weird urethra poking out makes it look like i have 2 tiny penises and also the vaginal opening seems to be kinda misplaced.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Am I tripping?? can I please have some comments and concerns I should bring up to the surgeon? I was supposed to have revision surgery but it got cancelled bc of covid19. And does anyone have advice for getting rid of the smell? Every-time i dilate in the room my roommate notices a &#34;smell&#34;.
</p>

It does appear to ‚Äúfold‚Äù in oddly, almost like two openings. At first glance I couldn‚Äôt tell where the penis would be inserted during sex. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything all too problematic as long as intercourse is normal.

If I may, it may be helpful if you edit the title of you post by adding a hyphen and your doctor‚Äôs name. People are going to ask and you can head-off having to spend time answering.
</p>
<p>
I won‚Äôt diminish your concerns, but tell you that you look beautiful to me‚ù£Ô∏èAll women are different and unique in the appearance of their vulvas. No two are ever the same. This link to show that may help with you anxiety:

</a>
</p>
<p>
Start making a list of your questions and concerns to take with you to your next appointment so you make sure to cover everything. At the heat of the moment when your anxiety is it at height during your appointment, it is easy to forget what all you want/meant to ask when relying on memory alone. Plus, it shows the Dr. you were prepared and serious about your concerns. I wish you the Best. ü§ó‚Äôs üíï

As far as I&#39;ve read, you could also look for a trans-experienced gynaecologist and ask them if everything looks fine or if you should look for another surgeon to do a revision.

thats what he did to me! totally not a corect vagina. he covers up the urethra so when you pee it goes everywhere including in your vagina AND he literally makes it to where your vaginal canal is mostly covered by what he calls &#34;outter labia&#34; making dialating SUPER HARD AND PAINFUL and sex impossible. He will look you in your eyes and tell you everything is normal. smh. he is the WORST. now i ahev to have more surgery to fis it. People need to STOP GOING TO HIM. HE DOESNT KNOW WHAT HES DOING. I am so sorry.
