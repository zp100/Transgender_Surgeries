I&#39;m still saving and am a few years away from actually having FFS. I live in the UK and was considering Facial Team, however are there better options out there?

There isn&#39;t a &#34;best&#34; doc or team. It&#39;s about what you want/like. For example done people want to look like they have had work done. It&#39;s a measure of status and they like the aesthetic. The west cost of the US is great for this look and surgeons in LA can give you a great outcome if this is your goal. If you&#39;re looking for something more natural/less aggressive Dr. Spiegel in Boston is a fantastic surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Being that you&#39;re across the pond, facial team in Spain does incredible work and they have some results that completely change how people look, and some results that are just feminized versions of the before pic.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s all about what you want.

Well, to be frank, I just want to be beautiful ðŸ˜‚. I want my forehead contouring, my jawline changing, a tracheal shave and possibly hairline lowering. I don&#39;t want to look like I&#39;ve had work done, but I do feel I need to look quite a bit different for me to be happy with my appearance.

You mentioned Facial Team, based in your location and goals, I see literally no reason you shouldn&#39;t plan on them, unless you&#39;ve seen someone else with results you like. They are obviously considered top tier, so it&#39;s a good plan to get a consultation with them to see how much you should plan to spend.

I&#39;ve only seen good results from them, but to be fair that doesn&#39;t mean anything really. Not to mention I didn&#39;t consider them myself because I&#39;m US based and wanted to see someone closer.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I also only needed forehead work so I didn&#39;t really pay attention to much else.

I&#39;ve booked FT for both mandible work and rhino, should I cancel that and go to someone else?

Thanks for your reply.
</p>
<p>
I found some people saying the same as you do about FT and their jaw &amp; soft work only after already having booked a date. This has gotten me worried.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t really go outside of Europe for this and FT looks like the best bet in here. The reddit before/after posts look better than the results on their own website imo.
</p>
<p>
I probably don&#39;t need to completely transform as I like how I look in the mirror except for the brow and jaw, and sometimes nose. So I guess I have kind of realistic expectations?

Well I haven&#39;t seen many results pics, so I&#39;m going to have a good look through the results on this sub&#39;s wiki. There&#39;s a surgeon in Beverly Hills which I&#39;ve seen amazing results from, however I&#39;m not made of money lol and it&#39;s going to take me years to save up for SRS and FFS.
</p>
<p>
My friends and family have said that I don&#39;t need FFS (pics on my profile if you&#39;re curious what I look like), so perhaps FT might not actually suggest I have much done, which would keep costs down. Of course my family and friends could be sugar coating... But regardless, I&#39;ll be insisting on having my forehead and trachea done.

Ok I ONLY had my brow and forehead done with Dr. Spiegel in Boston. And he does the best forehead IMO. Your face is super fem and you could easily just get away with just brow and trachea and be 100% passable. He&#39;s also a lot cheaper than most. DM me if you want to see some pictures.

All your photos seem to be from the front, and you look pretty good. Side photo&#39;s show different things though.
</p>
<p>
You could get SRS first, its heaps cheaper, especially in Thailand.

Yeah, I really don&#39;t like my profile, especially my forehead. I will indeed be going to Thailand :) - hopefully Dr Bank as long as he proves himself after Suporn retires.

From the photos I&#39;ve seen so far Bank is at least as good as Suporn and possibly better. Unfortunately they keep getting deleted. No doubt there will be heaps of them over the next few years.

This is true. When I saw him he was training a fellow Dr. Laura Garcia-Rodriguez. I&#39;m pretty shure she did most of the work and it turned out amazing whether or not she did it or he did.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Spiegel is heavily published and extremely well respected. Whoever is working under him is going to good and he&#39;s going to be carefully supervising.

Afik, there are two FFS surgeons in the Portland area: Dr Jens Berli at OHSU and Dr Tien Ngyuen at Lake Oswego Plastic Surgery. Iâ€™ve had consults with both of them.
</p>
<p>
Dr Berli is very on the ball and quite knowledgable. He does fewer FFS surgeries than folks who specialize in it, but is very devoted to helping trans people, clearly skilled and well qualified.
</p>
<p>
Dr Ngyuen is more of a general plastic surgeon and trans people are a minority of his practice. Some of his recommendations were very outside of the ones given by other doctors Iâ€™ve talked to and on the whole seemed like moderately bad advice.

I&#39;m not sure who exactly you&#39;re talking about. I didn&#39;t do much west coast research because I live closer to the east coast so I looked at surgeons closer to me.

I don&#39;t know who&#39;s best, but if you look in the wiki you can probably get an idea of who people go to. There&#39;s a lot of posts about Facial Team and it&#39;s not because they are cheap.
</p>
<p>
Deschamps-Braly in the USA has a big reputation, but I&#39;ve no idea how to tell if he deserves it. He is probably the most expensive FFS surgeon in the world.
