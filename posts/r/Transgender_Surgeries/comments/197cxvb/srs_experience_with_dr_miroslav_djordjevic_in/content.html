Hey sisters. I&#39;ve seen so much of you are interested in doctor Miroslav Djordjevic here. My friend had sigmoid colon vaginoplasty  surgery month ago and filmed a video about her experience (in Serbian but u have translation) , hospital experience , how nurses are and doctor who explained each method. You can see him in video too, he is so caring and nice,  also he answers mails very fast. He did amazing job, 6 inches depth (that can stretch even more) , good aesthetic, she can normally pee, has sensitivity and feeling down there, dilatations are good without pain, a little bit of pain after surgery , no complications at all . He is not abnormally expensive, his prices are around 20k for sigmoid colon but if u want correct info contact her via email @

</a>
where u can feel free to ask any questions u want, she will respond. Nurses and staff are so careful, they also speak English.

I know this post is old, but I hope you will reply to me. I have to have a revision with a sigmoid colon, since I had a first operation which however had the complication of vaginal stenosis, I only have 10 cm of depth and the vagina is so narrow as to prevent sexual intercourse. I&#39;m scared reading your review.... I hope I can make it and not die
