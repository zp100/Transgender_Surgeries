I&#39;m FTM, with long-standing MS. A lot of what you end up dealing with with &#34;effects of MS on X&#34; isn&#39;t the problems it causes directly but indirectly. Meaning, for anesthesia/surgery/recovery, there are few direct MS problems; the stress of the experience could trigger a relapse or a pseudo-relapse, but that&#39;s about it unless you&#39;re already having trouble with your ADLs or mobility.
</p>
<p>
Indirectly, though, usually means working around whatever disease modifying drug (DMD) you&#39;re on. For example, when I had top surgery last year, I was on a DMD that is a form of chemotherapy given twice a year that creates a targeted type of immunocompromise. So, it could leave me open to more infections, and make me take longer to heal. My neuro recommended having it before my surgery instead of after, so that&#39;s what I did, and it worked fine. My surgeon just wanted a short letter saying that was the plan, so everybody&#39;s ass was covered.
</p>
<p>
The good news is, IF you have MS (and it sounds like that&#39;s still a big IF, since it&#39;s a diagnosis of exlusion), you&#39;ll have a neuro who can advise you about your specific situation. Find a specialist. They know that MS is a chronic illness, not a terminal one, and they&#39;ll help you find the ways to live your life in spite of the disease instead of in fear of it.

Perhaps

You are too kind hiddenstill....
</p>
<p>
I’m so sorry to hear about your troubles. I think the right answer is to get a complete picture of exactly what’s happening with you. First establish (or deny) your MS diagnosis. Next, figure out if you do or do not have a brain tumor (!) and what treatments might be required for that.
</p>
<p>
MS is a funny thing. There are fast acting and incredibly slow acting forms. It would be important for your own decision making whether you were healthy enough to have surgery, once you know more.
</p>
<p>
They also might want to start you on medication, even something as well-established as corticosteroids, and that would definitely interfere with your surgery.
</p>
<p>
SRS can be safely performed in lots of patients with lots of different well-controlled medical problems. This does not at all mean you can “never have surgery” but it sounds like we are awaiting a lot of important information before that decision can be made.
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps…
