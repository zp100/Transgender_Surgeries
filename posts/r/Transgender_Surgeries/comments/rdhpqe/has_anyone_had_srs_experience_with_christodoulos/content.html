So far, just initial consult.  I am just about done with my required hair removal, so should be back in for my follow-up consult/readiness check - and hopefully surgery scheduling) in January or February.
</p>
<p>
My impression of both doctors right now is that they are quite knowledgeable, but fairly recent to SRS.  Training was done with Bluebond-Langner in New York using the hybrid PIV/Peritoneal technique.  Dr. K seemed a bit more dry, though still easy to talk with.  Dr H. was fantastic - he not only answered my early questions (and subsequently did some additional checks due to concerns about potential urethral scarring I might have had - all turned out fine ^.^), but during my initial visit with him we spent quite some time just generally getting to know each other which made me feel incredibly at ease.
</p>
<p>
There are others who have been through surgery with them who may or may not comment here.  But based on my conversations I am personally quite comfortable with my choice to go with the UCH team.  I hope to see some results at my next consult, but that really isn&#39;t a huge determining factor for me as I: a) recognize that everyone has different anatomy going in, so will have different results based on that, and b) am less concerned with how it looks than how it works afterward, which a bunch of pictures isn&#39;t going to give you much if any insight into.
</p>
<p>
For reference, I drive 6 hours up to Denver for a majority of my healthcare at UCH, and have been quite happy to do so - though I must admit I am almost happier about the fact that my electrolysis is almost over because it means I don&#39;t have to make that drive every week than because it means surgery is near. :D
</p>
<p>
Feel free to reach out to me with any other questions I might be able to answer about my journey up to this point. üíúüíúüíú

I am not sure how many... I actually never thought of asking that.  I know that surgeons typically observe for a number of procedures, then they perform them under the guidance of the lead surgeon until they both feel it is appropriate to solo.
</p>
<p>
I will add that to my list of things to ask him though when I see him again.üòÅ
