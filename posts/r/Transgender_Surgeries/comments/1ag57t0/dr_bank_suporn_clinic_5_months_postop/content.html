UPDATE: I did figure out a more transferable way to squirt. Well, basically looked it up at
<a href="https://omgyes.com" rel="nofollow">omgyes.com</a>
and it worked for me. Basically, you need way more intense clit stimulation than is usually comfortable, putting your fingers in and pressing on the top wall (g-spot/urethral sponge/skene gland/prostate region) also does a good job. Then you&#39;ll be getting a feeling like you might want to pee, that&#39;s exactly what you need, just push through towards it and you are done. Squirt is not pee, but you may want to pee before trying so that you feel more comfortable and less stressed when that feeling comes.

Recovery is wonderful, I am really lucky. I&#39;m at 8 months now and I can dilate once a week or less, it looks pretty, everything feels good. I might post latest pictures if I won&#39;t forget.

Normal waiting time is about a year, but occasionally they also have last-minute dates when someone cancels, they are also published on the calendar page. As far as I remember they mentioned that they update those dates on Mondays. You need to have a client profile with the clinic before you will be able to apply for dates, so it makes sense to fill it in and send even when there is nothing available in the calendar. You may mention to them if last-minute dates could work for you, so they might reach out directly without advertising the date. I was super lucky - 3 weeks after submitting the profile they asked if I could make it in 2 months, which I immediately agreed to. Keep in mind that you&#39;ll need to pay the deposit IMMEDIATELY for the date to be yours, and you&#39;ll obviously need to pay the entire cost before the surgery.

Wow I find that absolutely crazy, I‚Äôve applied 4 times now and haven‚Äôt got a spot after trying for over a year. I‚Äôm on the ‚Äúshort term waiting list‚Äù too. Never once have I even been contacted for it. No hate to you, but why did they choose you after only 3 weeks when I see so many people on this sub trying to hard to get a date? All the posts I see of people getting dates seem to get it first try too, and I know someone personally that got it in one go. What is Suporn doing?

Honestly, after &#34;losing&#34; the lottery twice, I just moved on. I&#39;m set for surgery in April with Dr. Sutin at PAI. Regardless of how good Dr. Bank is, playing a lottery for access to healthcare made me feel gross.

How much is the deposit to book for the surgery date? I will probably have enough money for surgery + everything in late 2025, but I figure if I start booking only when I have the full amount, my surgery date is likely in 2027.

The deposit is 20%, 119 000 THB in my case (full amount in 2023 for Dr Bank surgery was 595 000 THB). Prices are updated regularly, and when I was applying they mentioned the price for Dr Bank in 2024 to be 620 000 THB. Team surgeries are cheaper (there was no price for 2024 available, but for 2023 it was 520 000 THB). You will also need to pay for the Rattanachol hotel stay (at the very least 3 weeks) - approximately 1300 THB per night for a standard room for 1 or 2 people, breakfast included.

Estrogel, officially I was on 3 pumps a day, now I am actually on 4. But I was also using scrotal application sometimes, not more than 1 pump, as it&#39;s equivalent to 10 pumps due to the scrotal area providing 10 times the absorption rate compared to applying it normally on the stomach area. I don&#39;t like needles, and gel provides the most control over the dose, with no potential issues of oral estrogen

Looks great! Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
If you are up for sharing, I am curious, how many times did you apply to the Suporn lottery before receiving a surgery date. I have tried three times with no luck and am just trying to get an idea of how long it has taken for others. Thanks much.

I was EXTREMELY lucky - the first time I wrote to them was mid-May and I had my surgery mid-August, exactly 3 months later. I wrote to them just to create a profile (it was after the application window, so just for that), explained why I am a perfect candidate (perfectly passing, well-adjusted, 32y.o., living full-time with all updated documents, good support network, remote work, stash of money from previous big tech job stock, never on antiandrogens (estrogen-only (+progesterone) for 1.5 years at the time), with fully working not circumcised reasonably sized source material, perfect health, no diet restrictions, and with signs of dysphoria from young age to present), mentioned that I can travel on short notice and told them I will be monitoring last-minute dates on their website. They got back to me, sent the profile form, and also let me know that they update last-minute dates on Mondays (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still the case), so there&#39;s no need to check every day. I filled and sent the form, they accepted it and then I went back to my life. 3 weeks later they reached out and said they can give me a date in 2 months in place of someone who couldn&#39;t come, before the date was announced publicly, and I agreed to it. Hardest part was to get a referral letter from a psychiatrist in Sydney on such a short notice, as waiting lists for them are over a month even as private patients - luckily another trans girl knew a psychiatrist who was able to help, so it all went well.

Thanks for sharing your story! I can imagine what a fire drill that would have been to get the referral letter that quickly. Congrats on completing your surgery!

The process is basically &#34;take a small douche, fill it with water, disassemble a probiotic capsule and put its content into the douche, cover the douche with a finger or something and shake to mix probiotics with water, douche&#34;. PH testing I was usually doing in the morning before peeing, so that when I do a swab it would not be affected by any kind of urine leftovers or anything. My full recovery diary is on Astra, and I also posted a link to this post in MMH, so you should be able to find my discord account from there and reach out directly if you want. Here&#39;s the list that contains exact probiotics, douche, pH testing strips and lots of other things I used during recovery with my comments and instructions:

. Most things are probably less relevant for you at 8 months, but the Slippery Stuff lube I can&#39;t recommend highly enough

Thanks very much for posting your results! I&#39;m seeing Bank in September so would be very interested to read your full recovery diary. Idk what Astra or MMH is though, I looked through your comment history and couldn&#39;t see anything like that. I might have missed it though. Do you mind directing me to it?

Both are¬†discord servers for Suporn Clinic patients with a confirmed date. Astra is the main/current one. MMH is older and is rarely used nowadays. They are successors to the Suporn clinic patients facebook group (I think it was called Suporn Butterflies or something)

My BMI is 25.1 - I&#39;m 173cm tall and weigh 75kg. I think when I was applying it was a little bit higher, but not by much
