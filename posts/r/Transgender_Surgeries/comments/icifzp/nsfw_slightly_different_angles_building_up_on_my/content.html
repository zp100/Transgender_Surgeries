From what’s visible it looks like have a successful revision. Have you asked any surgeons?

I&#39;m trying to coordinate with Bella Avenessian but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to work. I live in NC. I have to travel there in person to get a consultation and it&#39;s in the middle of downtown Manhattan. So getting there and back just for a consult during covid is going to be difficult and there&#39;s a possibility that I won&#39;t be able to afford it once they tell me how much it will be

Honestly I can see why you’re unhappy and I know me saying it’s not the worst I’ve ever seen will not help your situation. However I will say I think you have the makings of a really great result with a slight revision to tidy and even out the labia. I’d suggest looking into a labiaplasty or revision because you have lots of material there to work with.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say all cis vaginas are different blah blah I know that doesn’t help us trans girls much (thanks dysphoria) but just hang in there because you’re so close to the result you want!
</p>
<p>
Also please don’t take this the wrong way but I usually find that shaving really alleviates some of my dysphoria and I think it would help with the appearance in your case too.
</p>
<p>
All my love xx

I understand, I’m a big ‘no hair anywhere’ freak when it comes to my own body so I feel like i project that. And I do think tidying the hair up would make it look way better but if it helps with your insecurity then that’s ok too x

Dilation is probably the only good thing about my surgery. I have had little pain. I do have what feels like a tucked penis running underneath the skin that is erectile tissue and if I&#39;m aroused it swells and blocks the vagina, it becomes very difficult to insert anything.

I&#39;ve seen many ginas in my early years.  Understandably, you may not find it &#34;perfect.&#34;  However, it does look fine... don&#39;t put to pussy on a pedestal. Cis women are often self conscious about the same things you are upset about down there.  You had a good surgery.  If you are worried... a revision looks like it could be in your future.  Don&#39;t expect too much, or you will never find happiness. Best of luck to you.

Honestly the only thing that looks like it might need a revision is the right labia minora because it looks wider than the left hand side. But even with that said, it&#39;s a minor issue (and I only noticed it in one of the three photos you&#39;ve shown) and I think your results are actually on the better side of MacPhee&#39;s work. What has she said regarding revisions?

If I&#39;m the best then Macphee needs to lose her license. She played ignorant with me, claiming not to see any problems. I also have a lot of erectile tissue that she won&#39;t remove.

My results are fairly similar to yours and I&#39;m very happy with my results 🤷‍♀️ Is there a specific part of your result that you have a problem with?
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t attribute her misunderstanding to malice; like I said, I think your result (compared to her gallery on her website) is on the better side in terms of realistic results. I can understand why she&#39;s confused

The surface area of the labia is too large, way too many folds/wrinkles on the outside of where the labia should end. Underneath this area it&#39;s very soft and looks gutted from certain angles like there&#39;s no tissue underneath, just think purple skin and bone. The clitoris is way too high up, not to mention it has almost no sensation. The area below the uerethra isn&#39;t mucosa but is essentially what was penile skin. On top of that there is still erectile tissue that flares up and makes this look even worse. Lastly there&#39;s a ton of hair inside.

I have a similar problem with my labia majora being fairly wrinkly. I told her I&#39;d like that to possibly be fixed during a revision, but she didn&#39;t really say one way or another if that would be possible, she just kind of acknowledged it and that was it
</p>
<p>
Is it possible the actual problem with the clitoris is a lack of defined hood? That was another thing I brought up with her. I think if we both had a more defined hood, things would look more anatomically correct. That and the folding of my majora are the two things that stick out to me and make me feel kinda poopoo about the way things look, but it&#39;s also way better than the alternative
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what to say re: the erectile tissue, clitoral sensation and internal hairs. I&#39;ve found one or two hairs inside myself, and she did scraping. They end up coming out as I&#39;m dilating when I use coconut oil, because there&#39;s a good amount of friction when using it vs. using lube. They&#39;ve come out, root and all, when I pull my largest dilator out post-dilation. Might be worth trying?

I had one revision with her in March actually and I don&#39;t think it helped much. If you look at results on here from Ting for example they look a lot nicer, cleaner. I would be fine even if the labia itself were just the fucked up part but what really bothers me is the area outside the labia is so wrinkled. It looks like I have a 89 year olds genital region and I&#39;m 31. I also live in the triangle and I&#39;ve come to find out that Macphee has botched a lot of other people and she&#39;s only been practicing SRS for 4 years. She totes that she studied under Marci Bowers but if you go to Bowers recommendations for alternate surgeons she isn&#39;t listed. She&#39;s just very shady all around.

The fact that you&#39;ve already had a revision with her is probably why she&#39;s against doing any further revisions. I would imagine she&#39;s afraid you&#39;re going to continue asking for them at this point
</p>
<p>
I would just talk to another surgeon and see what they&#39;re able to offer you
