I&#39;m from FL and I fell in love with the work and skillship of Dr.Avanessian and I was wondering on how you initiated your first consult and how do you start the conversation for surgery?
</p>
<p>
I also wanted to know how soon you were able to have surgery from the initial consult and if they offer Medical Credit (medical loan) options for GRS?
</p>
<p>
Please any information would help, I&#39;ve been on HRT for a while and I completely don&#39;t know how to take my final step in transitioning ðŸ˜”

<p>
Call Dr. Ting + Dr. Avanessian&#39;s office. Press the option to book an appointment on your dial pad.
</p>
<p>
Ask whoever you&#39;re talking to at the front desk to transfer you to Elsa or Alicia, the care coordinators. And then once you&#39;re transferred to either of them, ask them what they need from you to begin the patient intake process.
</p>
<p>
They will need the documents I list below to be emailed to them.
</p>
<p>
<em>
GET ALL THIS STUFF READY AHEAD OF TIME BEFORE YOU CALL
</em>
</p>
<p>
Prepare a drafted email ahead of time to submit to them
<em>
WHILE
</em>
you are on the call so they can review it
<em>
DURING
</em>
the same call. This way you&#39;re not put in email limbo after you hang up. Always ask them what the next step is for you to complete before you hang up. Take notes if you need to (:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
state ID card
</li>
<li>
insurance ID card
</li>
<li>
any letters of support you may have.
</li>
<li>
the documents from your latest physical within the past 3-6 months
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As for letters they will usually need a psych letter, a social work letter, and general doctor&#39;s letter to book a consult with Avanessian.
</p>
<p>
Or you won&#39;t make any scheduling progress at all.
</p>
<p>
Then you wait for your insurance documents to process, and you&#39;ll get a consult appointment date.
</p>
<p>
After you meet with Avanessian for your consult, you will be told your surgery date on that same day.
</p>
<p>
In the future your letters must be re-written and re-submitted within 3 months of your surgery date so that they are current.
</p>
<p>
Good luck! Avanessian is a young master for sure (:
</p>
<p>
She has a much shorter waitlist than Dr. Ting. My wait times for Ting was like 4 months for a consult and 9 months until surgery, but don&#39;t quote me on that.

My primary care doc worked for mount sinai so she just emailed them for me to get things rolling, but you can just call them to set up an appointment.  Make sure you tell them which surgeon you are interested in as there are several there now and even more in training.  It took me just over a year to go from making appointments to having surgery, but she went on maternity leave last winter so I would have had surgery sooner if it wasn&#39;t for that.

You send an email. Duh. Then you do as they say in the email. And you go from there.
