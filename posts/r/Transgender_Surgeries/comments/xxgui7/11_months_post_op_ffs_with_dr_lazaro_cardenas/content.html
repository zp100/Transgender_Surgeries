It was my first time having surgery and i was super nervous lol luckily my aunt came to Guadalajara and stayed with me for the 10 day package deal! The rides to my appointments were all provided for (Luis was my driver, really cool guy), and the food they make is amazing (try their chicken soup ❤). The first day I arrived and settled in to the apartment, met up with my aunt and the next day I went to see Dr. Cardenas and he did a thorough look at my forehead, proportions and said I would need a type 3 reconstruction and lower my hairline a little and raise my brows. The day of surgery was most nerve wrecking lol I got to the hospital put on a gown and laid down on a stretcher table thing with wheels. They roll me into the surgery room and the anesthesiologist gives me an IV then I blackout and wake up in a recovery ward feeling bandages around my head, kinda numb too cause the surgery obv lol. I felt no pain just woozy from anesthesia and they took my bandages off gently the next day and the nursing staff helped me.shower and show me how to gently wash my hair. My aunt got a handheld mirror and i was shocked at how different my upper third of my face looked. All in all, I went from looking like the GEICO caveman to looking like Dua Lipa lol 😆 ❤ recovery the next few days was smooth, pain was at 3/10 just discomfort and pressure. Food was nutritious and tasty and helped me recover my energies soon. The day of departure, they take my staples out and give me aftercare instructions and to use a scar gel on my hairline for 6 months I think. My experience was def 10/10 👌

I just had Forehead work! And 3 meals a day for 10 days was pretty good for me, I did venture to the corner store to get a pizza and snacks a few times lol and i used grubhub too, was interesting seeing my grubhub in Spanish mode lol TV channels are fine, I mostly watched reality shows with my aunt on the couch. Wifi was available for sure and i just spent time on reddit and buying cute makeup online since I was gonna have a new and pretty face canvas

i swear everyone indepth review about the whole stay is always wonderful like this! rly builds the confidence to hear, thanjs so much for sharing! it’ll be my first too so its still just a lil nerve wracking regardless haha so it was just the forehead type 3 and hairline lowering with brow lift? i have a ten day stay as well but also rhino, lip lift and chin contour being done… did u feel the ten days was more then sufficient time to be there? on your flight back how presentable did u feel at that point? i imagine i may still look a wreck when i come home 😅
