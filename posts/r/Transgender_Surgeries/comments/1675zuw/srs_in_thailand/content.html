Hi. Looking for advice please! Has anyone here used, or have an opinion, of SRS at the Kamol Hospital in Thailand?

If you already happy to make Me the effort to Thailand why don’t make the effort to the best reputation option - suporn clinic??

That’s exactly the point about this post! It’s a starting point for research and open discussion. Since posting, I’ve looked more and more at the Kamol hospital and have found so many unhappy stories. For sure I’ll extend research to the Suporn Clinic! Nothing is being dismissed out of hand. All advice is welcome :)

🩷🩷 suporn bank girl here. Back there a few months ago. I give 10 out of 10 ding ding. They are the modest expensive one in Thailand, but for a life time result, so worth it. Hope you will find the peace soon too :)

I had GCS with Dr. Suporn himself in 2013. Everything went well. The hospital was clean, the hotel in Chon Buri was terrific (morning buffet is included with the room), transportation to and from the Bangkok Airport, and the staff of the Suporn Clinic is top notch.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been over a decade since my GCS and my cis lesbian wife and couldn&#39;t be happier!! And my VA gynecologist was impressed, too.

So pleased that it has worked out so well for you! I’m starting to hear increasingly positive reports around Dr Suporn and on balance there has been very little negative around his clinic.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing!!

So, wait, is the transportation segment assisted? That&#39;s the part I&#39;m most nervous about ironically

The Suporn Clinic provides transportation to and from the Bangkok Airport to the hotel. And the transportation to and from the hospital for your surgery and the tests before the surgery

When the initial appointment is made there is  partial deposit. And I believe the total amount has to be paid prior to the actual surgery. I mean, my GCS was 10.5 years ago. Plus, things may have changed....

I mean, good to know about transportation. I can save up money, no problem, like it will probably be around 8 years, but if that&#39;s the least of my worries, I&#39;d say the future looks pretty bright.
</p>
<p>
For reference, after I realized the cost of everything in January of this year, I started saving up so far I have around 5.5k saved. Mind you, I made some bad choices and purchases when trying to expirement with clothes and makeup.
</p>
<p>
At this point, though, while I like buying clothes here and there, I&#39;m pretty happy with the start of my wardrobe, and after next month, I will have mostly all the makeup products and accessories I need.
</p>
<p>
Prob will focus on voice therapy, body morphing, and ffs while I wait, wish me luck!

I was with a friend who had a revision with kamol. The vibes this place gave me were not good.
</p>
<p>
The fact that it is a small private hospital, and not a big private international one... the way they handled things... the amount of unknown was crazy. And kamol didn&#39;t really seem to care at all, he looked like he just wanted to get money. He had like 3-4 surgeries at the same time... and I know everyone does this for the money, but usually they care more.
</p>
<p>
And since it is a small hospital, the rooms are just bad. They don&#39;t even have a bed for guests, I was sleeping on a non opening couch with towels as blankets...
</p>
<p>
Overall, it is just not something I can recommend anyone... combine that with the amount of complaints about the results themselves... I can&#39;t see a reason to go there
</p>
<p>
If you want fast and &#34;cheap&#34; (relatively), you can go with PAI or theerapong, if you have the money and don&#39;t mind waiting, the suporn clinic is likely your best shot (at least with Bank, not sure about the other one there).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m personally going with Dr Sutin at PAI, the wait time and uncertainty with suporn is not something I can deal with, and I like the results of sutin a little more sometimes (more my personal taste I guess)...

I’m surprised no one talk about Yanhee. I had my SRS there 13 yrs ago with Dr. Greechart. He was the best SRS doctor there at the time. I had an amazing 7 inches depth and I didn’t experience any dilation pain like everyone stated.

The marketing is totally fake because they do discount if you accept to do video with them for youtube publicity.kamol hospital  care just about money they dont care about you after surgery so if you want to be botched and depress and pay again to have revision to fixe that go to kamol .we are alot of girls loose deep and cant have sex and struggle because kamol

OMG I’m so sorry to hear this. It makes me wonder if they want to incentivise you towards a good surgery by forcing a public showing of their work on YouTube, else they don’t care about the results. I don’t want to be slanderous in my thoughts, but it sounds like your personal experience has been awful 😢

I had SRS-PPV at Kamol Hospital and had an amazing experience. They were a little disorganised prior to surgery, but once it happened, everything ran like clockwork  I have had no issues and am 6 months post op  I went with a friend and she had SRS with skin graft and also no issues. I met lots of other trans women and one trans guy while out there and as far as I am aware there were no major issues  The nurses were great, accomplished was fab and the surgery looks amazing. I can orgasm and have great depth. For me personally I would recommend Jamol hospital 🤗 Good luck what ever you decide on.

Thank you for sharing your experience! So interesting to hear another perspective and I’m so pleased to hear that you had a such a positive experience.
</p>
<p>
It’s made things more complicated of course! There’s also the human factor that everyone, including surgeons, have good days and bad days.
</p>
<p>
I’m starting to wonder if there is an element of chance on top of the planning 🧐

One of them went to a butcher in the USA, the another butcher to get fixed up. I don’t think she’d have regretted it if she had chosen a different surgeon.

Yeah it’s my opinion too I think they don’t research enough about the surgeon, method and everything

It&#39;s possible to regret SRS even with a good result so just make sure you have absolutely no doubts before surgery.

Most of their complaint is about dilation  I’ve heard with sigmoid colon method after one year you don’t need to dilate is that true? And even it’s easier to dilate because of the self lubrication

I can only imagine that post-operative care, especially dilation, can be extremely challenging. There’s still so much to learn.

I don&#39;t know as I didn&#39;t have that method. But to be honest I think that dilation is always important with SRS no matter who you choose.

Another incredibly sensible comment! Thank you.  There’s certainly no going back from such a major procedure! Luckily for me, it’s not a difficult decision and the hardest part is finding the best way to do it……which surgeon, which technique.

Agreed, research is everything. There will always be risks, but we must never go into a life changing situation blind!

Exactly research is everything and about kamol there aren’t good reviews  There are better doctors like Dr bank (too expensive) Dr Sutin, Dr burin

Sigmoid colon with Dr. Sutin is an excellent option, he does an excellent job with aesthetics and is very experienced with this technique

Is that true that you don’t need to dilate after one year with this method ?

I’m a bit worried about discharges and odor or bad smell that everyone is talking about and the surgical incision as well

The smell is just a false myth, since during the surgery a special washing and preparation of the colon is done so that it adapts to its new function, I have also talked to many girls who had this technique and they say that the smell is false, the &#34;smell&#34; (that does not smell like poop) is only during recovery, after that the smell is very similar to that of the natal vagina (at which point the new pH is established)

Good  What about discharges? Should we use panty liner for the rest of our life? And I would be so happy if you give me any information about dilation after one year with this method some says this method doesn’t need dilation after one year

I had FFS done at Kamol last summer and made friends with a few of the ladies undergoing SRS there. They are now complaining of a lost of depth to the point that vaginal intercourse is not possible. There are several of them with this same issue.

Thanks for this. The marketing of Kamol is quite amazing. However real life stories are throwing up serious concerns. Thanks for sharing your experience. I hope the ladies you made friends with are doing better.

No problem, I am not sure why a few people on here bad mouth Kamol hospital.  There is an element of risk with any surgery, and everyone&#39;s bodies respond differently. Who and where ever you chose I hope all goes well! X
