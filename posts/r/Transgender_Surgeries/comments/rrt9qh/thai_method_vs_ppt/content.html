I just wanna give my perspective as someone born with a &#34;meatier&#34; vagina- Theerapong&#39;s aesthetics look very similar to my natal vagina. I have big lips and actually see myself in a lot of his work. However, a transfem person should give you advice on the sensation and revovery aspects. Just wanted to say the aesthetic side isn&#39;t too bad.

Hey, I’m 2 months post-op with Dr Thee and I can attest that my vagina is very sensate, had my first clitoral orgasm yesterday and felt amazing. Externally my cis female relatives and friends alike are stunned by result, it’s juicy but neat, I’m so happy with it.
</p>
<p>
My only word of warning would be to go via Siam Transformative and not directly through Interplast. Siam Transformative offer an excellent aftercare package, speak fluent Thai and English on the contrary nurses at the hospital speak very limited English and you may probably feel very alone. Siam Transformative also took care of all my practical needs e.g transport to and from pre/post op appointments, logistical planning, companionship at the hospital and after. Finally, the success of my result was due to their specialised nurse, Cherry who is lovely and has nearly 10 years SRS wound care experience.
</p>
<p>
DM if any further questions

Thank you so much! I think I&#39;ve actually already chatted to you in DMs in the past haha. I&#39;ve already been talking with Siam Transformative, and if I go with Dr Thee (which I&#39;m currently leaning towards) I would definitely go with them, they&#39;ve already been super helpful.
</p>
<p>
So happy you&#39;ve had a good result!! I think his aesthetics are just so different to every other surgeon I&#39;ve seen that I&#39;m still coming to terms with what I want, esp in terms of, like, overall size? If that makes sense. But he&#39;s obviously super skilled

I recall there was some issue with this website and its authenticity. But either way if those are accurate he does an outstanding job on the clitoral structure and it appears like there would be a secondary sensation organ as well. Further below it is very messy however. Sure is partially to blame on recovery issues.
</p>
<p>
For the aesthetics just pick what you like more. Just make sure those are legit and actually from him.
</p>
<p>
I went to Suporn and sensation is amazing. I tried hard to find differences in how things feel like by asking as many cis people who were open to that discussion as I could. Strangers on reddit, my gf, a couple swingerclub experiences. I made sure to tell first to reduce bias. I was surprised to hear they knew exactly what I was talking about even with things I was uncertain about them being normal. In fact I haven&#39;t yet had an experience when someone cis told me: &#34;Nope that does very much feel different for me.&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I really hope they were honest and not biased by a need to comfort me. It came over as genuine though.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t compare mine to other srs results though. Transwomen have the tendency to be irrationally euphoric about their results which creates bias. It needs someone who doesn&#39;t give a damn.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t tell more about the sensation than it is good and it seems very accurate.
</p>
<p>
I do have my issues with the secondary sensation organ though. It isn&#39;t naturally there, it is visible when you look close and you certainly feel it. I&#39;d prefer to not have it.
</p>
<p>
In terms of the vaginal lining I would agree that PPT probably has more potential. The only downside I came across was that some said it wasn&#39;t as resilient as it should be and that they don&#39;t feel much inside at all. But it will heal faster and may lubricate better.
</p>
<p>
Mine is still pink inside, I have decent sensation inside (not extreme, not nothing, it feels good), I do have enough lubrication for sex without lube, I do have some discharge in my panties indicating it does self clean to some degree (not perfect), enough depth, literally I have zero complains about that part. I don&#39;t feel jealous about PPT now being available and I&#39;m not sure if I would pick it over what I have. It turned out good. Though compared to the average 3 months recovery times, my recovery was hell for 9 months.

Thank you!! That’s super helpful.

Yeah I don’t think I’d choose PPT over Suporn’s method purely for outcome, though all else being equal I like the balance of pros/cons in its favour. But the easier recovery and especially ongoing dilation requirements are a huge deal for me. I’m not sure I could emotionally handle the year after a Chett/Suporn procedure tbh
</p>
<p>
Oh! And as for that website I’m 99% sure it’s legit from the looking into Theerapong I’ve done, but I’ll keep digging. I think I remember the controversy you’re talking about, and iirc it was someone shilling for Kamol who showed examples that looked 100% cis (as in no scarring or discolouration even). But that’s all just in my head, could be totally wrong. As for this website, if nothing else these are all at least quite evidently SRS results

Yea we might remember the same thing with that site and I don&#39;t really know who is behind it either. As long as you can get in touch with some who went there and see their results it should be all good.
</p>
<p>
My recovery seemed worse than what I have heard from others who went to Suporn. There sure were cases where they worked again after 3 months. Personally I spent 6 months almost exclusively in bed and another 6 just working 50%.
</p>
<p>
The worst part wasn&#39;t the pain but the dilation. The way Suporn specifically (idk about Chett) threats the graft causes a ton of micro scars and those contract naturally. The epidermis is removed (ig that causes the pink color),  the hair follicles removed and he does make a lot of cuts into it so it isn&#39;t rejected by the body due to bruising and blood building up in between.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is supposed to be 30 minutes 3x/day for 3 months, 2x/day for another 3 months, 1x/day for another 3 months going down to once a week. In practice especially around the 3rd month it will effectively take you 2-3 hours in agony per session. It can break you mentally. It drains all your life energy. A lot of patients I talked with neglected it and have issues with having sex now.
</p>
<p>
At least I can throw some positivity into the pot. After 4 years I stopped dilating (or using toys) entirely for 6 months to see if I would loose any depth. I lost none. I don&#39;t dilate anymore since then but resumed normal sexual activity cause I like. I never lost depth and have no issues with sex.
</p>
<p>
Long story short: People are not kidding when they say going to him makes for one of the worst recoveries. If you go there expect hell and don&#39;t give up while healing.

Thank you so much for this, I think it’s important to be honest about what you’re getting into when going to him. I imagine if you weren’t prepared it’d be a recipe for bad post-op depression.
</p>
<p>
There’s no way in hell I could ever take 6 or even 3 months off work, or still be spending half a day every day dilating by month X. That alone probably rules him out for me, though I might ask around if people that have had it recently have been through the same ordeal. I don’t know how you did it.
</p>
<p>
So happy to hear it was worth it in the end though! Dilating for the rest of my life was one of the thing that really scared me at first, and even made me consider zero depth for a quite a while, but from everything I’ve heard it’s not that big a deal in the long run. And as my therapist put it, I spend a looot more time than once a week or month worrying about my current anatomy now so it’s a good trade haha

That is Very interesting.
</p>
<p>
The few old original studies I&#39;ve found that state skin grafts used to reconstruct vaginas come to resemble mucosa also mention that the thinner ones more readily take on the characteristics of the tissue at the target location.
</p>
<p>
From your description Suporn&#39;s method sounds like it might result in similar conditions... and results. Which could possibly account for the self-lubrication his patients report.
</p>
<p>
I had peritoneal pull-through, and my instructions included applying estrogen topically to promote metaplasia. Did Suporn also suggest that during the recovery period?

Naa he did not and I don&#39;t exactly see how topical estrogen would promote metaplasia. Medically speaking that makes no sense to me without any additional transparent studies. I got antibiotics to prevent infection, blood thinner against cloths from sitting around, betadine for disinfecting and silver sulfadiazine cream to prevent or keep granulation at bay.
</p>
<p>
The self lubrication supposedly comes from the urethra tissue that is added at the end of the graft and the tunica vaginalis that can be added around the first few inches per request.
</p>
<p>
I am a little suspicious about where it is coming from because it isn&#39;t just from the urethra but from the inside as well during arousal. If metaplasia is a thing there (I&#39;m skeptical), Then it might be possible that it is filtered blood plasma which would be one of the sources naturally. It almost has to be. I&#39;m not aware that the mucosa from the transplanted part of the urethra would react to arousal.
</p>
<p>
There is also the fact that he preserves the skenes gland but I am not sure how the cable management is done exactly. If I&#39;m not mistaken with what I see then that duct is right above the urethra. So it isn&#39;t that either.
</p>
<p>
I never had a look inside when I was still healing but I had later and there are also pics in my post history with deep insight. If I wouldn&#39;t know better I would say metaplasia was at work. Part of me thinks that is just irrational wishful thinking.

Thank you... it&#39;s interesting.
</p>
<p>
From what I understand the peritoneum metaplases in order to survive on exposure to oxygen, the differentiation of the mesenchymal cells to mucosa being triggered by estradiol.
</p>
<p>
It just might be that since skin also contains them the thinning of the dermis required to remove follicles, combined with removal of the epidermis might trigger a similar reaction.

Hi, I&#39;m also at the early stages of research, and still deciding which method to go with (leaning toward PPT),  do you mind explaining this bit to me? What exactly is the secondary sensation organ, honestly never came across it before, so my apologies if I sound extra ignorant.

Suporn calls it the chon organ but he is not the only one who does it. Just the exact technique below the skin differs which shouldn&#39;t be a big concern.
</p>
<p>
So the glans is bigger than the clitoris. The nerves are distributed over a larger area. If you would make just a realistic sized clitoris out of the glans you would kill 80% of the nerves for sure.
</p>
<p>
In earlier stages surgeons have put it partially below the skin to make it appear small in cases where they preserved most of the sensation. Later some started splitting it up and putting it into not too obvious places. That is essentially it.
</p>
<p>
Suporn/Bank place 2 slices left and right below the clitoris on the vestibule. It is partially below the skin and how visible it is varies. I had mine done 9 years ago. Either cause of that or because it somehow fused mine are left and right on the inner side of the labia minora below the clit and above the urethra. You can tell by color and the surface there not being even. It&#39;s not super obvious but visible.
</p>
<p>
Now sensation wise it feels great but in my opinion also awkward. This tissue is just like the clit highly sensitive to direct touch. The labia minora feel  more like the prepuce or the upper part of the shaft. That would be the anatomical equivalent. I can ignore it because it is relatively close to the clit and I don&#39;t perceive it as off unless I focus on it. Neither do cis peeps notice it cause you would just hit that part by accident as well as the clit and the subjective feel is the same. But it is off. I know and it bothers me to some degree.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t help that the secondary sensation organ has more surface than the clit and therefore is more sensitive. I frequently have to tell some people I do things with to go a bit lower.
</p>
<p>
The alternate is just less nerves. I&#39;d personally be fine with that. Orgasms in particular post op are much more dependent on the mental state. Even 10% would have been enough for me.

Whoa, thanks a million for this explenation. I have to say my mind is blown even just at the idea of it. It sounds great to have extra sensation, but then in your experience you say it does bother you in some way, which I will do my best to see if others (who have it) would also be ok with less sensation.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, deciding on suregons &amp; mehtods is so overwhelming! I&#39;m grateful we have so many options, but it is scary to make that final decision. I feel like recovery time is important to me, and you also mentioned how brutal yours was, so that is a big factor to consider, as well.

How did you get your surgery with Suporn?

You pay the deposit, pick a free day and you have the surgery appointment reserved. They may still reject you for various reasons. HIV, obesity, failing their small &#34;are you sane?&#34; test, failing to pay everything a month prior, missing documents, etc.
</p>
<p>
I knew I wanted to go to him and reserved a date around the time I started medically 4 years before I turned 18. I got a surgery appointment one month after my 18th birthday and expected to have a diagnosis and all requirements fulfilled by then.
</p>
<p>
Waiting times are long. Anywhere in between 1-3 years. It varies from time to time.
</p>
<p>
You just need to know early enough and manage to pay the appointment deposit. Otherwise you&#39;re gonna wait a long time.
