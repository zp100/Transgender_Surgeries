Hi everyone, I got SRS with Dr. Esmonde of the Meltzer clinic on April 4, and things have been going well/healing pretty well, but now about 3 weeks later I&#39;m experiencing intense and painful muscle spasms/tightness in my vulva, my labia, around my vagina. It gets way worse when I walk, and has been making standing/moving around more and more difficult. It feels like it&#39;s getting worse. Have others experienced this? Is this normal? I&#39;ve been having trouble finding any accounts that sound like what I&#39;m going through and I&#39;m wondering what you all think. I&#39;m going to post a longer write up soon but for now would be so grateful for any thoughts from everyone about these muscle spasms. Thanks!
</p>

*to clarify, the muscle spasms are not happening in the vaginal canal, this is the bulbous spongiosum/muscles around the vulva as far as i can tell.

Do you keep your pelvic floor muscles tight habitually? I had some spasms there while things were healing up but nothing painful.

they are usually tight/tight before surgery -- i have a harder time relaxing them than i do tensing them. but not usually painful like this.

i did on saturday! she was great. she gave me some trigger point work and didn&#39;t seem too worried about the muscle spasms. but theyve gotten a little worse since then, i&#39;m def gonna keep going back though.
