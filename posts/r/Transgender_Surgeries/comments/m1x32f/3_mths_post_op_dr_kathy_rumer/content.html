your results turned out a lot better than mine did...hard to believe we have the same surgeon. It seems like you lucked out, and I hope you are adjusting well to your new anatomy. :)

3 mths post opp
</p>
<p>
EXTREMELY HAPPY TO HAVE MY SRS
</p>
<p>
THE ONLY BUMPS IN THE ROAD I FACED ARE
</p>
<p>
-Three (3) fistulas (all closed on their own)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
An abscess that grew on my right labia around (week 4-6) that took several weeks to drain (week 10)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have a HIGH TONED PELVIC FLOOR  which made dialation a lil difficult but able to be done
</p>
<p>
WOULD I RECOMMEND DR RUMER
</p>
<p>
AGIAN ONLY IF YOU DO RESEARCH ON YOUR SURGERY BECAUSE SHE IS NOT A HAND HOLDING SURGEON SO RESEARCH ON YOUR PROCEDURE A STRONG SUPPORT TEAM An A STRONG MENTAL HEALTH (because this surgery will have you emotionally everywhere)
</p>
<p>
LIKE LAST TIME Iâ€™LL BE DELETING THIS APP CUZ YALL RUMER BASHERS OOOOOUUUUU CHILDDDDDDD  Yâ€™ALL NEED TOO JUST HAVE SEVERAL SEATS
</p>
<p>
BUT ILL POST UPDATES SOON

I&#39;ve been on this sub for a long time and I&#39;ve seen a lot of her, less than ideal, results. She has earned her reputation all by herself. It&#39;s great that she has patients with good outcomes, but when you aren&#39;t one of those, the victim blaming starts and problems seem to escalate for the patient quickly and harshly. We&#39;ve seen this over and over, far too many times. This is the manner in which she has addressed serious problems and I would seriously consider her history of negative patient interactions before choosing her.
</p>
<p>
The OP, has a good outcome here, but 3 fistulas? This is about the worst complication you can have with a vaginoplasty and they are fairly rare across the GRS surgical field. These are not complications that anyone should have 1 of, much less 3. That&#39;s more fistulas in one person than some surgeons claim over 100 surgerys.

I question whether we are really talking about the OP having multiple fistulas. It sounds like there might have been 1 which might have coincided with the abscess. The others were probably small perforations along an incision. Those typically heal on their own.
</p>
<p>
In general, the danger of a fistulas in GRS or Vaginoplasty tears through the vaginal wall into the colon allowing contents from the colon to leak into vaginal canal or the blood stream. This is where an abscess can develop which increases the possibility of sepsis, which is a serious complication. These don&#39;t heal on their own, it takes intervention and treatment. It&#39;s also why they are rare. Most surgeons make every effort to avoid puncturing the colon when tying in the lining of the vagina.

I&#39;ve met one of her victims in a support group. It&#39;s horrible what she went though. It&#39;s really not a laughing matter. Some of her patients are left out to dry with no responsibility of fault from her. Results like that with the added process of having to get approved for more steps and pay more just to get it fixed can destroy people. I&#39;m glad not everyone has had the same experience at least.
