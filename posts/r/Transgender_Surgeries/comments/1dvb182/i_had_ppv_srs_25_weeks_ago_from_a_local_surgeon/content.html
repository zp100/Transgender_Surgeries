yours and
<a href="/u/Mayra_JaneMED" rel="nofollow">/u/Mayra_JaneMED
</a>
â€™s comments seem oddly similar and a tad strange honestly. Why would you NEVER work with this surgeon, would you care to elaborate?

Janemed has many specialized surgeons to work on almost all domains like they have different surgeons for colon , PPV, cosmetic , hybrid PPV , jejunum or so on.
</p>
<p>
And they do hunt best to best surgeons all over india and collaborate with them .
</p>
<p>
And TOP ON THAT THEY HAVE A LARGE TEAM TO DO ON GROUND REALITY CHECK OF THE SURGEON LIKE THEIR DEGREES , EXPERIENCE, PATIENTS REVIEWS , SURGERY COMPLICATIONS , THEIR SPECIALIZATION , COLLAGES , INTERNSHIP AND SO ON.
</p>
<p>
I am not sure why he has taken our name . Janemed&#39;s Team will reach out to him very soon.

Aesthetically I&#39;d say you&#39;re looking good, but you do have some wound dehiscence around your entrance that I would get checked in due course. I assume everything smells OK? If so, that can wait for your follow up appointment. If she smells funky, particularly if there&#39;s a rotten smell, get yourself checked ASAP.

Period smell is probably OK, as that&#39;s mostly blood and sloughing skin, which is similar to what&#39;s happening to your body right now.
</p>
<p>
Infection generally smells like rotting meat, faeces, or occasionally rotting fish. A slightly fishy odour isn&#39;t anything to worry about though.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m much more concerned about the acidity and vomiting? Is your temperature OK? How long has that been going on? Are you on any antibiotics? Have you discussed that with your surgical team?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s probably best to discuss dilation/depth with your surgeon.

Janemed never worked with Kothari..and priyamed also stopped working with him because of his butcher work. I wish you successful surgery.
