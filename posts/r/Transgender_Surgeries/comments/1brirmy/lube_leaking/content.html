Hiya,
</p>
<p>
Ok, I‚Äôve heard the saying you can never have enough lube, but‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
When I walk around etc, I get leakage after dilating, and I‚Äôm thinking‚Ä¶ is this my life now?
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm 3 weeks post, and have been told to dilate twice daily, and douching after each one, but it‚Äôs obviously not cleaning everything out as I end up with sticky thighs‚Ä¶
</p>

Discharge will reduce with time. For me it took quite a lot of time due to other complications, but now I have virtually none. I&#39;d recommend douching in the shower. This will become much easier when you&#39;re down to once a day, and even easier when you&#39;re weekly. I&#39;ve found the best solution is dilating before going to sleep, taking a shower (douche during) and then sleeping on a incontinence pad without undies (buy a few incontinence pads you can throw in the washing machine). What little is left will drain out onto the pad overnight. Get up, go urinate/defecate, and clean up with a baby wipe. This will get progressively better as you heal. If you have hypergranulated tissue, it&#39;ll get worse temporarily until that is resolved. I&#39;d recommend wearing pads until you&#39;re healed and stable.

Do you have period pads? I‚Äôm dilating 4x a day and it‚Äôs exhausting, and douche at the end of the day after the last one. I spot a little all day but period pads (panty liners) help catch everything. It‚Äôs not forever, as you progress through the healing process and need to dilate less, you will stop leaking as much. Eventually as you go down to twice a week, the leaking will basically be just a few times a week. I try to think of it as bringing me closer to a menstruating woman‚Äôs experience üëç

At three weeks,  you&#39;re still going to be dealing with postop discharge. I started wearing pads only at night at about 4 weeks and didn&#39;t completely stop wearing pads until about 4 weeks ago (I&#39;m 12 weeks postop)
</p>
<p>
Vaginal discharge will always be a part of your life now. But that&#39;s a person with a vagina problem, some days will be light, some will be heavy.

This will totally go away, though when fully healed you&#39;ll still have occassional days of discharge (varies between people). This is just due to dilating SO much right now. If you don&#39;t have enough to require period pads, I highly recommend liners for more confort/lower profile (just don&#39;t cheap out and get scratchy ones lol). Keep it up, this is normal and will end (plus you&#39;ve still got stuff from tissue healing which will go away entirely).

1/ you really don&#39;t need much lube. I use one line along the length of first dilator, then no additional for seconds (bigger) dilator.  2/ i recommend a bidet attachment for your toilet for cleaning after dilation and toilet use.

Yes douche‚Ä¶but just with warm water. I‚Äôm assuming you might not be douching deep enough and some trapped lube is still deeper in the canal. If that‚Äôs not the issue then maybe you just need to go a couple rounds before you get it all. I use to douche 3 times in the shower with just warm water after a dilation session.

Still too early to say. But the douching after each dilation is to much. I only douched daily once with plain water and then Castile soap water mix the next day and alternating.
</p>
<p>
I also would put a rolled up tissue inside to get some of the lube out afterwards.

Do NOT recommend putting a rolled up tissue inside yourself.  Tissue dissolves and shreds -  you‚Äôll have little paper residue inside you.  And you don‚Äôt want to push them further up inside you upon dilation, or sex when you begin having it.  Go for a dedicated clean washcloth for that purpose instead and rinse it and keep it clean.
