Sorry you had a bad experience. I went to Dr McGinn a few years back for my ftm top surgery and she was nothing but delightful and my results are fantastic.

It’s alright, I’m actually glad it happened because I discovered my current surgeon through persisting research.  I’m happy to hear your results turned out well and that your experience was more positive! :)

i booked a consult almost a year in advance, and when the time came i drove two hours in a snow storm to meet with Dr. Mcginn for a srs/breast augmentation consultation. i had cash for both surgeries at the time.. i had had a breast explantation by dr. leis because of capsular contracture on one side so i wanted to get SRS and a BA at the same time. no big deal. rather common. Mcginn took one look at Leis&#39;s work (huge scars) on my chest and said &#34;wow... thats messed up&#34; she was disinterested in me, kept looking at her phone, and i found her to be really cocky and defensive as i just asked normal questions about srs... i had been curious about a minimal depth procedure that i had heard was common in england and europe and she basically told me i would def regret not being able to let anyone have sex with my vagina. i talked to her for less than ten minutes total. it was really upsetting, and then i had to drive three hours home in a snow storm feeling shaken and a little teary. i found her to be awful to communicate with...

I find it odd that you say she doesn’t work with insurance since I know she definitely works with the Ontario government insurance, and I know at least one person in the US who had surgery there under their insurance... ?

Her office works with insurance for filling for reimbursement, but they do not accept payment from insurance companies. My understanding of Canadian healthcare is that surgery performed in the US for Canadians, most of the cost can be deducted from taxes at the end of the year and that McGinn&#39;s office provides the necessary paperwork for this to occur.

As a Canadian, that’s not accurate.  The Ontario health plan pays McGinn directly per an agreement they reached - much like she has with certain other companies, unless this has changed in the past year since I looked into it.
</p>
<p>
There were some aftercare housing and treatment that was not covered - which is why I ended up going elsewhere, but her office made it very clear that they would do what they can to work with insurance... I’m sorry you had a different experience.

I was originally planning on going to McGinn (really wanted a Thai surgeon, but I can&#39;t afford it and insurance likely wouldn&#39;t cover that). I didn&#39;t know she didn&#39;t accept insurance :/. Also three letters? That&#39;s crazy!
</p>
<p>
What surgeon did you end up going with? Also if you don&#39;t mind (and if you&#39;re allowed to say, not really familiar with insurance rules) what insurance do you have in that it was completely covered, holy crap?!

There’s many techniques widely available across the world. While many Thai surgeons are quite talented and do indeed produce beautiful, natal looking results, I’ve also seen many Thai results that are less natal-looking looking than my own results.  I think it’s important to remember all results vary between all surgeons, no matter where it is.  It’s an inaccurate statement to say that Thai surgeons are the one and only surgeons capable of producing natal looking and functioning results.

I just had mine done a couple weeks ago and I’m still in Thailand. I’m 31 and I’ve been doing research since I was 23. I’m very very happy with my results from my Thai surgeon, everything is healing well and it looks completely like a cis females does. I think if these doctors in the US stopped gatekeeping then they might try to get better results. I’m happy to hear though someone in NY is doing good work, cause all the other US surgeons I’ve seen are getting people sick and or they don’t have feeling below. I personally know 4 people who don’t and they wished they could’ve gone to Thailand. I’m sorry op that happened, but happy to hear you found a great surgeon 🙂🌈

I’m so happy to hear that your experience in Thailand went so well! A big congratulations on the beautiful results; and that’s amazing how much effort you put into your research! :)
</p>
<p>
I do agree completely that there is an alarming amount of USA based surgeons who produce inadequate results that they try pass off as acceptable. I’m so sorry to hear about your friends situations, that’s truly so sad and I can’t imagine the pain they must be in. I feel so incredibly lucky to have found my surgeon! I could’ve easily chosen a less than adequate doctor if I wasn’t careful with my research.

I like the aestitics of that method the most. Plus it&#39;s more analagous towards where the parts would be if born cis so the sensations would be more similar (also it has a higher chance of allowing the person to get wet). Not to say that any other method is less valid, it&#39;s just that I would have preferred that method if I had much of a choice.

Yes, Thai method is clearly superior. But you have to pay out of pocket of course. If you can afford to, it’s better to go there.

Lol imagine if they were that gatekeepy. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a surgeon was like that though.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Your therapist used &#34;it&#39;s&#34; instead of &#34;its&#34; in this sentence, I can&#39;t schedule a consultation until its fixed!&#34;

I just don&#39;t get the reason behind proving how trans we are.  If I&#39;m willing to pay someone 50k to do the unthinkable from the cis point of view, don&#39;t you believe I&#39;m not playing around?

Honestly the details they were scrutinizing in my letters were close to being that ridiculous.
</p>
<p>
“Oh you need to make sure your therapist documents the exact day you came out!” Like how the hell would I know that? It was a long process without a definitive date, and when I was much younger.  However, I always complied with their requests even if I had to BS it a bit.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, that was pretty much the kinds of details they found wrong.

WTF? Even if they went by strict WPATH guidelines, that&#39;s still really weird and unnecessary. One of the reasons I always had McGinn in mind is because she&#39;s trans herself and would understand what her patients are going through. But that&#39;s just really fucking bizarre that they&#39;d be
<em>
that
</em>
anal about little details like that.
</p>
<p>
When I had my orchi consult, the urologist said, &#34;I need two therapist letters.&#34; Which was weird, since WPATH requires one each from a therapist and med provider. I sent him the WPATH SoC v7 guidelines, and he said, &#34;Oh, you&#39;re right. I must&#39;ve been thinking of older guidelines or something. That&#39;s cool then, just get one from your therapist and one from your med provider,&#34; and that was that.
<em>
That&#39;s
</em>
the way it should be, and I don&#39;t understand why McGinn&#39;s office would be so nitpicky.

I’m sorry you have such a negative experience with McGinn. I had surgery with her earlier this year. The consult through the surgery went smoothly, and I was impressed with my level of care. I think, and my husband enthusiastically agrees, that the aesthetics are superb (I don’t think those on her site are very impressive, but others highly of their results). She does set a pretty high entry bar for surgery from requiring a BMI that is lower than other surgeons do and asking for very detailed letters. I got the impression that she is working really hard to prevent dissatisfaction. But I could see how others might find it annoying. BTW, I needed only one letter before the consult. I wonder if they have changed policies. Best wishes!!

Thanks for sharing your experience! That’s really interesting you were only required one letter. I guess perhaps their policy did change.

Hi, I actually required two letters, but only one before the consult. There was a second letter that did not need to be as thorough as the one by my primary therapist. Here’s to our surgeries and to our recoveries!!!

Sorry you had a bad experience. I went to Dr McGinn a few years back for my ftm top surgery and she was nothing but delightful and my results are fantastic.

I nursed a friend who went to McGinn, she’s very happy, and yes I believe she had to get reimbursed through her insurance. I think McGinn’s office was helpful in facilitating it.
</p>
<p>
I went to Meltzer in AZ...ugh. I’m not very happy with how it looks, I have no labia minora, my “clit hood” is just labia majora sewn together above my clit. It doesn’t pass at all :(
</p>
<p>
I’m very disappointed, I really really regret not going to Thailand. I wanted to use my insurance, I should have figured out how to pay out of pocket and made it happen.
</p>
<p>
I’m glad you’re happy with your result!

Thank you so much! &lt;3 I’m happy to hear your friends experience was positive (: that’s awesome.  I’m glad the staff helped facilitate the reimbursement, however I still find not working with insurance off the bat a bit ridiculous. That’s just me though!
</p>
<p>
I’m so incredibly sorry to hear about your experience with Meltzer. /: You’re unfortunately one of a handful of patients I’ve encountered that’s unhappy with the aesthetics of their procedure.  I considered him, and Dr. Ley, however wasn’t impressed with their post-op results at all.  Did you undergo his second-step labiaplasty yet?
</p>
<p>
If so, have you considered a revision for the aesthetics? What he did to you sounds extremely unacceptable. /: I have a very defined inner labia and clitoral hood structure that looks natural, which was done in a one step procedure.

Yes, I’m a year post op, I’ve had both stages. I trusted the 3 friends I know who’d gone to him and are happy. I just don’t get it, the technique he used on me at least could never yield a natal looking result. All he does is connect the tissue above the clit, that’s what he calls a “clitoris hood”, then for some kind of labia minora all he does is sort of pinch the labia majora edge. There’s is no attempt at constructing an inner labia/clit hood. I just don’t see how anything could be passable using that technique. I’ve seen a result from Dr Ley which looks much better, I’m currently trying to find out, based on that pic, if they can give me something similar. I’m also consulting with the in house SoCal Kaiser team of Dr Poh/Dr Rayblatt.
</p>
<p>
I do have sensation, I can orgasm, I can pee although it’s still shooting too far forward. So I’m thankful for all that, I’m still happy with having bottom surgery but I was stupid, I wanted to use my insurance which is Kaiser SoCal. Dr Poh/Rayblatt had just started doing surgeries when I was already in the surgery pipeline at Kaiser for 2 years. I played it safe. I also didn’t look at his outcomes, I actually just wanted to trust all the people I’d spoken with. It’s all my fault, I don’t really know why I wanted to specifically not see his outcomes, I’m usually not like that. So everyday I kick myself for not pushing to see his outcomes, you have to do it in person or via Skype, he doesn’t post results on his website, other websites like here have some.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, so I’m not very hopeful anything substantial can be done at this point in terms of having a labia minora and decent looking clit hood. Even the work he did during the labiaplasty has pretty much disappeared so what I’m left with is just the skin over my clit sewn together so at least it’s not exposed. I think that’s his only criteria, there’s no attempt at creating something pretty, it’s strictly for function.
</p>
<p>
Bleh, it gets me depressed writing about it but hopefully it might help someone else, please look at the results, ask specific questions.

Thank you for sharing your experience. You definitely highlighted some valuable insight, it’s definitely important to ask specific questions about aesthetic and function beforehand and to always view post-operative results from potential surgeons.  Always address your concerns with potential surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I’m so incredibly sorry to hear about your experience with Meltzer though :( I can’t imagine everything you’re going through. How he proceeded with your surgery is totally unacceptable.  He should’ve been using separate tissue for your clitoral hood and labia minora, I also don’t quite understand why he still does a two-step procedure when most modern techniques focus on aesthetic and function in one operation.
</p>
<p>
I really hope Dr. Ley or the team at Kaiser can help you further.
</p>
<p>
Have you considered possibly consulting with Dr. Jess Ting and Dr. Bella Avanessian at Mount Sinai or Dr. Rachael Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Lee Zhao at NYU? They’re NYC based but pretty renown for performing revisions to improve aesthetics. Best of luck with everything going forward. &lt;3
