Had my boob job done Tuesday Nov 5th. Dr. Alnaif ended up doing the whole procedure himself without any direct involvement by Dr. Obaid.... I think. They videoed the entire surgery and put a copy on a USB thumb drive and gave it to me in recovery, which was an unexpected and pleasant surprise. Dr. Alnaif ended up

using the Sientra implants at all. I&#39;d originally thought I&#39;d limit the size to 500-550cc but at 2nd consultation changed my mind and said to get as close to 600cc or larger that I would have enough skin to cover satisfactorily, so when The date of surgery arrived the surgeon decided that the 600 cc range of the Sientras  would just look too hoky on me and probably end up with my nipples pointed outward and just didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be satisfied with the looks and it wouldn&#39;t be natural so he decided to switch Mentor MemoryShape implants which is also a gummy bear available in a teardrop shape profile that&#39;s taller with better inward cleavage and a large amount of forward projection for the CCs and was able to put 610cc implants of this brand in me and I&#39;d have just enough skin to stretch well, and move my underboob crease which there really wasn&#39;t much if, upward where it became part of the main underboobs themselves and created brand new infra mammary creases since I had plenty of skin below my boobs that could be pulled upwards. I lost over 50 lbs of weight, mostly belly fat, 3 years ago before ever starting HRT and all that skin is still quite loose. My body has a lot of bilateral asymmetry  to it anyway and he was afraid of my boobs looking too left/right positionally lopsided but was able to balance the appearance so well that it looks like m new boobs and uneven clavicle lengths and heights are all actually totally level when you look at me straight even though if you&#39;d actually measure everything you&#39;d see how lopsided my body naturally it, but this surgeon is an artist and made even a lopsided potato of a body like mine look pretty darned good, even better than I truly look if you knew all my physical flaws. I&#39;m more than satisfied with the results so far. I know I still have a lot Of swelling but technically I measure a 36DDD even bigger than I thought I was going to end up now I&#39;m sure as soon as the swelling goes down to normal and I am more healed they&#39;ll probably just be the DD cups but I&#39;m really impressed with the looks overall, this surgeon has got magic hands, he&#39;s an artist and gave me an awesome rack that even my pornstar friends are envious of. I didn&#39;t press him for the answer but I think I was his very first MtF transgender patient to perform breast augmentation upon and he knew exactly what subtle differences needed to be done to make my German barrel of a ribcage look more slender and feminine than I actually am... he seems to be a master at creating the aesthetic illusions that&#39;ll fool everyone who&#39;s not a highly trained expert like himself, which is kinda what you want and need in a plastic surgeon when you&#39;ve got a naturally flawed and lopsided body that wasn&#39;t improved much by busting it up in a couple of motorcycle wrecks on top of plenty of natural flaws too..... right?

Now for the bad part. The two surgical nurses who prepped me for surgery (Actually one did all the work, the other was a trainee who was shadowing her senior nurse) sucked badly. The older one continuously misgendered me, and when it came to to stick the IV needle and port into my arm, I&#39;ve never encountered a more incompetent idiot trying to stick a damn needle into one of my veins. I swear she must&#39;ve blunted the damn needle with a rusty file or something, but poked me all over the inner crook of my elbow and the top of my right hand a least a half dozen times trying to get a stupid 20 gauge needle into me, and kept going thru both sides of whatever blood vessel she was trying for. I&#39;m not even sure she could tell the difference between a vein and an artery. She hurt me, several times, to the point where I was crying out in pain. Finally the nurse anesthetist (a CRNA) came into the room and took the IV equipment away from the old biddy who was torturing me, and got a fresh new needle and IV port assembly and stuck it into the top of my hand himself. He was visibly pissed at the old woman&#39;s incompetence and how she had hurt me repeatedly, I thought he was going to tell her to get lost and take over training the new girl himself and even though he was not a direct employee of the clinic, just a contract CRNA on rotation assignment there that day. I&#39;m pretty sure he must&#39;ve had some choice words with the head surgeon who owns the business afterwards, so that was the worst of it. As soon as they wheeled me into the actual operating room and hooked up the monitors and IV bag with the fentanyl, propofol r whatever else anesthesia drugs The CRNA had me do the usual count backwards from 100 and I got to 98 and the next thing I was aware of was waking up in the recovery room where I was already bandaged up, dressed with the special postop compression bra and my niece was helping me put my street clothes back on, and the surgeon thanked me for the opportunity to have met and operated  on me, and they handed me a folder full of my postop aftercare instructions, the USB thumb drive of the video, helped me into a wheelchair, rolled me out to the car and sent me home.

Healing up has been a little more painful than I thought. The skin was stretched very tight over the implants, and the pocket cut into the muscle stings a lot when I first wake up in the mornings, after all, I didn&#39;t have much muscle there at all and 610cc is a big-ass size of implant to shove into such a tight place. The surgeon did prescribe me a metric s-ton of hydrocodone pills for the pain along with diazepam as the muscle relaxer since valium works so much better than the classic Flexeril prescribed by most doctors. I was told to separate at least 2-3 hours between taking a hydrocodone and a valium, but I have to admit... both together sure feels mighty groovy and if I don&#39;t doze off right away, I feel like Superwoman, ready to take on the whole world, lol!  That is until the hydrocodone wears off then I&#39;m a crybaby again. The surgeon even offered to call in refills for both if I still need them when the original quantities dispensed run out, and this day and age getting a refill on any opioid pain meds is damn near impossible,  this surgeon was adamant that the last thing he wants is for me to be in pain since with implants this big in someone my physical size, there&#39;s an awful lot of pressure being exerted on some raw nerve endings inside there. And he wants good reviews if I choose to post any, plus this clinic is wanting to attract more transgender women patients&#39; business. They do not even mention transgender anywhere on their website yet, and I mentioned to the lady who maintains their web content that they should add a simple section saying that they welcome all patients equally regardless of whether they are cisgender, transgender, non-binary, none of the above, all of the above, anything in between, or whatever identity or presentation they desire. All patients are to be respected and any adverse treatment or discrimination toward any prospective new patient is strictly prohibited at this surgical clinic.  Se liked that and wants to include such verbiage on their website to let transfolk know they can seek plastic surgery there without worrying about anti-trans hassles. Already their photo gallery  of before/after pics of breast augmentation procedures simply lists all the patients as women, with no deliberate &#34;outing&#34; the MtF transgender patients they&#39;ve worked on. If you browse thru the pics, it&#39;s usually fairly obvious which of their patients in that gallery are MtF. Everyone&#39;s faces are not shown, only their torsos.... pretty soon my own before/after pics will join them and the only identifiable text will likely say something along the lines of 50-60 year old , 140lb 5&#39;6&#34; woman with 36A cup asymmetrical breasts, implanted with 610cc Mentor &#34;MemoryShape&#34; high cohesive gel silicone implants, now 36DD or something to that effect. Look for the lumpy, oddly tilted left clavicle, and that would be me. The new bewbs themselves look pretty freakin&#39; awesome and you might not even notice the Franken-clavicle unless you intentionally look for it, lol!

Taking benzos and opiates together is

very dangerous
</em>
, you should very much not do this, especially near when you&#39;re about to go to sleep! Both of these drugs are addictive and getting off them is

really

miserable (especially benzos).  Seriously, don&#39;t take that refill if you can at all help it

A person with a significant tolerance due to chronic pain is a completely different situation than OP. Please don&#39;t encourage known risky drug combinations because it happens to work for you.
