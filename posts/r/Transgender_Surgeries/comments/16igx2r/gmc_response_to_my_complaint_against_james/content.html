Holy crap thank you for this info, he was currently one of my choices, but now that i&#39;ve seen this, absolutely not.
</p>
<p>
But now i question who else i should go with. The best answer would be just got to Thailand, but haven&#39;t got that kinda spare money

Do not go with Bellringer.
</p>
<p>
I was there during a heatwave, the room had no AC and it was impossible to even point the fan at my body.
</p>
<p>
I told them of my food intolerances and restrictions, they did not account for this. I had to order food online as nothing they could provide me contained protein which wouldn&#39;t make me sick or give me bowl issues.
</p>
<p>
They insisted I had plenty of depth and girth, and that I wasn&#39;t relaxing enough as they forced the dilator in me. After being discharged I had to buy smaller ones. I still struggle with the blue one they provided, and I can only get to the first dot. My vagina is completely unusable for penetrative sex outside of small toys.
</p>
<p>
They claimed I&#39;d only need to dilate 3 times a day for 20 minutes. I&#39;m 13 weeks out and it takes me a full hour to get the blue dilator to the upper most dot, and I&#39;m still doing it 3 times a day.
</p>
<p>
The  so called labia majora he gave me is ridiculously over sized. Compared to friends who are on a similar timeline to me with recovery my result is absolutely the worst looking.
</p>
<p>
I have no pleasant sensation down there, I&#39;m hoping that will change but I&#39;m not holding out hope. Discomfort still wakes me up at night.
</p>
<p>
I am so dissatisfied I actually regret having surgery.
</p>
<p>
His post care is an absolute joke.
</p>
<p>
My friend went with McGinn in the US as she was able to afford it. The post care, hospital care, and end result are like night and day. She got morphine for a week and some good pain relief after. she was instructed how to get out of bed, how to sit down, etc without ripping stitches (by some physiotherapists apparently). I got morphine for 24 hours then just 2 ibuprofen 3 times a day and had no such help (and I ripped my external stitches by just sitting on the toilet).
</p>
<p>
Oh, and Bellringer is very abrasive. This may be fine pre-op but trust me his attitude is nothing short of infuriating post-op, especially how he dismisses criticism and complements his own work.
</p>
<p>
I absolutely hate him and I regret that I went with him.

Quick clarification- did your friend go to McGill or McGinn? McGinn is a well known surgeon, it’s possible there’s a McGill out there, but I’ve never heard of them.

I&#39;m said friend, I went with McGinn. She&#39;s expensive purely because I had to travel abroad to see her, but in terms of purely surgical costs she&#39;s actually a fair bit cheaper than Bellringer ($22k vs £24k).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m vaguely planning on making a proper post here about my experience with her as I feel she&#39;s by far and away better than anything anyone else in the UK offers.

In my honest opinion Thailand is the better option and wish i had gone there. As it is im looking at £30k plus to fix what he left me with or if i travel to Thailand closer to £20k excluding flights and hotels. Im years away from affording it so probably just going to use what savings i have to get the pain issues sorted out. I have seen someone else and they think its something wrong with my illioinguinal canal / nerve, it was either damaged while doing the orchidectomy or a suture has been placed incorrectly and caused scar tissue to form arounf the nerve. Another option was that the spermatic chord was not cut correctly but i will not know until someone goes in there to have a look. Either way it shouldnt have happened and Parkside are denying all resposnsibility for it happening and will not investigate. Ms Rashid has also refused to fix my issues with the canal until my pain issues are resolved leaving me the only option to pay privately for investigstive surgery.
</p>
<p>
You only get one change at getting this done, dont make the same mistake i made and go for the easy / free option. If you have to get it done in the UK then anyone seems a better option than Bellringer, though he will check on you even if you are a patient of Tina at Parkside.

I’m currently recovering in Thailand, I had surgery with Dr Chettawut at WIH. It seems absolutely night and day the difference in quality of results, aftercare and general competence. I’m so sorry you’ve had to deal with everything that comes with Bellringer; my friend had surgery with Tina Rashid at Parkside and loves her outcome - although she was also not positive about the environment or aftercare in general. She also said that on the few occasions that she was checked by Bellringer he was rude and abrasive.
</p>
<p>
To give you a real world example - my entire trip, made up of SRS &amp; lip lift, 30 nights accommodation in the hospital, flights, etc. has come to around ~£13.5k all in.
</p>
<p>
I’m amazed by the quality of my results so far, (surgery was on the 7th), and I’ve had very little pain, along with full instruction on how to move, clean, etc. I started dilation properly yesterday, fully nurse-led for the first few days and I have a very detailed dilation schedule all the way out to three months. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Dr Chettawut to anyone considering Thailand.
</p>
<p>
I really hope you can get things to a point where you’re comfortable, and I really hope something can be done about Bellringer.
</p>
<p>
Edited to add: I’ve just seen your post about it taking 75 minutes, that’s absolutely ridiculous; I was under for 6.5 hours 😮 and that’s just SRS, my lip lift was done separately a few days before under sedation.

I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up. Seriously just wish ii had the guts to go through with it and KMS. I just can&#39;t take this crap any more.

I&#39;ve had friends go to both Bellringer and Rashid, of those two I&#39;d suggest Rashid.
</p>
<p>
She uses the same/similar techniques as Bellringer because she trained under him but the general feel I&#39;ve gotten from friends is she&#39;s just better at it than he is. The aftercare will be broadly similar given they both operate out of parkside though.
</p>
<p>
If you can afford it I&#39;d recommend the Suporn Clinic, or McGinn in the US. Suporn was £16-18k, and McGinn was $22k if I remember costs correctly (I went with the latter and have no complaints).

<p>
Thank you for taking the time to contact the General Medical Council with your concerns.
</p>
<p>
I know it may be difficult to tell us about your experience. An Assistant Registrar, a senior decision maker at the GMC, has reviewed your complaint and received advice from a medically qualified colleague, and has decided that the concerns you have raised would not require us to restrict or remove the doctor’s registration at this time. However, we will be sharing your concerns directly with the doctor’s Responsible Officer so that they can consider the matter at a local level.
</p>
<p>
The role of the Responsible Officer
</p>
<p>
The Responsible Officer is a senior doctor who is responsible for monitoring the performance of doctors locally, and making sure doctors keep their skills and knowledge up to date. They are involved in the doctor’s revalidation and annual appraisal, which is the process all licensed doctors are required to take part in to demonstrate their ongoing fitness to practise medicine. They make recommendations to the GMC about whether doctors should be revalidated, and they are duty bound to disclose any serious concerns about a doctor’s practise.
</p>
<p>
Reasons for our decision
</p>
<p>
The Assistant Registrar (AR) has carefully considered all the information you provided in addition to other relevant information held by the GMC.
</p>
<p>
The AR obtained advice from a medically trained colleague about the complaint. The adviser commented on the concerns regarding the two incidents where Mr Bellringer examined or tried to examine you. The adviser said they did not have serious concerns about Mr Bellringer’s fitness to practice in this respect and felt that the issues represented concerns regarding communication and bedside manner.
</p>
<p>
The adviser did not feel that from the information regarding your concerns there was evidence of abuse. The adviser notes the hospital complaint response indicates that Mr Bellringer was not aware before the second incident that you did not wish to see him again, and that this was due to communication issues on the ward, which the hospital detailed in their response.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Their lack of communication caused me to have a meltdown after my revision by Rashid. I told them on multiple occasions that he was not allowed anywhere near me only for him to enter my room just after a nurse had removed the PCA and checked my catheter and leg bag was empty for the trip home. My partner witnessed his actions and was just as frozen in fear as i was.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The adviser did not have any concerns regarding Mr Bellringer in relation to the pain relief you received after the surgery. The adviser noted that you had a morphine patient-controlled analgesia system and other pain relief available. The adviser said that if the patient had found this was insufficient then there would be an expectation that a ward doctor or nurse would assess if further medication was required and seek further advice if required. The adviser did not feel that it was an issue that primarily relates to Mr Bellringer.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The PCA lasted less than 24 hours and had run out before he ripped my dressing off while i was in serious pain. I had no effective pain relief at that point. I ended up screaming at a nurse at 3am because they kepy writing on my records that my pain level was 0. The on call doctor came to see me half hour later, looked at my medications chart and said &#34;i cant givve you anything for the pain&#34; at which point he prescribed me Zopiclone to sedate me and make me somebody else&#39;s problem in the morning.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The adviser said that your dissatisfaction with the surgical outcome of Mr Bellringer’s surgery does not necessarily indicate that the surgery was deficient. The adviser said he could not identify objective evidence suggesting that there are serious concerns about the standard of the operation.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dissatisfacton is a bit of an understatement and they still had concerns, just not serious ones.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The AR has carefully considered the advice and accepted it.
</p>
<p>
The AR commented that in relation to the two incidents which were the basis of the original complaint, it is their view that these are concerns relating to communication, bedside manner and having respect for the patient. The AR appreciates that you have concerns that Mr Bellringer’s action represent something much more serious and that it had a significant impact on you. The AR does not feel that from the information within the complaint there is anything that would give rise to serious concerns relating to Mr Bellringer’s conduct during the examination but there are concerns which should be shared with Mr Bellringer and his Responsible Officer (RO).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
He had no right to touch me. The fact that he just gets away with sexually assaultng me is infuriating and the main reason for my mental health issues including diagnosed PTSD, clinical depression and anxiety. He caused it and just gets away with it because he is a surgeon.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The AR considers that these concerns relate to his communication (or lack thereof) and his manner in relation to you. The RO should discuss with Mr Bellinger the importance of ensuring that patients have been told, and understand, what the doctor is going to do (e.g. Removing coverings / dressings)
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Hopefully nodody else has to be alone in a room with him again.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The AR appreciates that you have concerns regarding the standard of the surgery and the complications you suffered. They commented that all surgery has risks and outcomes are not guaranteed, including the aesthetic outcome. From the information provided and after considering the advice, the AR is of the view that there is no evidence that suggests the standard of care was so poor that it might raise serious concerns about Mr Bellringer’s fitness to practice.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Again, it was poor but not poor enough to be punishable.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You raised a concern with the GMC in the response to our request for further information. The AR commented that it does not appear to have been raised locally. You complained that Mr Bellringer had made the following comment “what do you want to do, fuck a horse.” This would appear to be a very offensive comment to make to any patient but, even more so to a patient who had undergone genital surgery and would be very vulnerable. The AR considers that this would be categorised as extreme rudeness rather than something more serious like discrimination.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I had asked about difficulty using the purple dilator after starting on the small orange pre-dilator. His reply was exactly as detailed above.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is the AR’s decision that the concerns you have raised are not so serious to require investigation into Mr Bellringer’s fitness to practice but they should be shared with Mr Bellringer and his Responsible Officer so that he can reflect on them and consider how he approached interactions with patients in future.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m sure he will reflect for all of 3 seconds before just carrying on as before.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What happens next?
</p>
<p>
We will write to the doctor to share your complaint. The doctor will be aware who has made the complaint, but we will not disclose your contact details to them. We will also send your concerns to the doctor’s Responsible Officer and ask them to address your complaint directly with the doctor as part of their appraisal. We may take further action if they tell us about any serious concerns, either in relation to your complaint or more  enerally.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If anyone else has concerns please for the good of anyone else he ever operates on complain to the hospital at a minumum. If enough complaints happen about his behaviour then something will have to be done so that he improves or is monitored more closely.

i am so, so sorry op. he did not have any right to touch you, and it’s disgusting the way establishments such as the one you went to make every effort to defend the providers (who already have more power in these dynamics) over patients. them being polite doesn’t mean it’s not still being dismissive and invalidating as fuck, again i’m just so sorry you’re going though all this. wishing you the best recovery from what they put you through, it was not right or fair or justified and you deserve so much better than the treatment you received

I will upload my full complaint to Parkside but it includes multuple images of other patients genitals when compared to mine that i do not have permission to share. I respect their privacy and it will take me time to edit but i can only do so when i feel up to looking at it again.
</p>
<p>
The complaints sent to the GMC and PHSO were web based so i do not have a complete accurate record. Multiple web forms and emails are hard to condense down to a readable reddit post unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
The PHSO complaint is still ongoing but i will of course post their reply on here and a link to the decision if it doesnt contain any PII. Looking at other complaints to them they all include PII even if the decision is to take no action, so im guessing they will out me sooner or later against my wishes.

I&#39;ve heard so very little good about Bellringer, it&#39;s scary to think I was going to go with him.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so thankful that people like yourself post to Reddit about your experiences. I had a consultation with him and he came across as incredibly dismissive of poor results others have shown here which really put me off him.

I just hope more people are aware of him and complain as you have.

If his responsible officer hears of any other complaints then they can refuse to renew his license to practice.
</p>
<p>
After my complaint to the hospital regarding his behaviour he is no longer allowed into patients rooms alone. I have confirmed this with other girls that have been to Parkside in the last few months, he has always been accompanied.
</p>
<p>
It will not do anything to stop him rushing surgery and leaving horiffic results and in my case 18 months later i still have serious pain issues that are effecting my daily life.
</p>
<p>
The worst mistake i have made was trusting him. He also lied to my face more than once post saying the surgery was two hours long, that my pain would subside and that i had a &#34;nice result&#34;. Absolute piece of trash human being. No wonder Charring Cross didnt want to work with him any more.

Thank god you complained because I have had a similar experience. I had a great outcome, but had some extremely bad experience where he more or less assaulted me during plug removal. The man is a monster.
