Probably his students performed the surgery instead of him. Consider a revision for aesthetic purposes.

I am so sorry that this happened to you sister. Personally, I have never liked Dr Kamol aesthetics at all. I hear everyone who’s interested in colon goes to him through.

To me it look like they could stretch it down more to both appear longer labia minora and avoid that tucked look.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a real financial crisis if I want labiaplasty now since insurance won&#39;t cover it, and the surgeon doesn&#39;t care unless it&#39;s a medical problem.

<p>
For clarification:
</p>
<p>
The surgeon was Dr.Kamol
</p>
<p>
The surgery was done 4 months ago
</p>
<p>
I had very very small genital to work with, and was circumcised
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Complaints:
</p>
<p>
Hairs in the small bit of the canal entrance (before the colon graft) had 12 sessions of laser prior and paid for electrolysis during the surgery
</p>
<p>
Dysphoric aesthetic (look like tucked male genital) hopefully it can change with time?
</p>
<p>
Labia minora stick together
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The good:
</p>
<p>
7.5 inch depth (I can swallow the whole dilator given by the hospital if I wanted)
</p>
<p>
Can orgasm and have great feelings!
</p>
<p>
Little to no complications (Had small granulation tissue taken out)
</p>
<p>
Hospital care was very good and the entire experience overall there was great
</p>

Probably still fairly swollen. Looks somewhat unusual, but I’d expect a revision later on could make a signifiant difference.

I’ve been trying for 4 years fixing my supposed surgery mess done by Kamol back in 2019 - had to redo my whole Scrotal PI with Theerapong having Sigmoid colon and finally that works with 7 and bit inches using the Large Soul Source Orange Dilator that actually works now , Damn this guy Kamol - I’m still trying to have aesthetics fixed post-op Kamol - I know what I really need is to re-open up the whole structure pull everything into place would fix it post Kamol - it’s not easy even Theerapong basically tried external stitches trying to give Minora to Majora distinction and it didn’t really work 2022 Nov. - you have to convince a surgeon to open all this up externally like a 1st time surgery and re suture everything all over again moving skin into position etc,  and they really don’t want to do this for fear they get blamed for bad surgery revision and your still not happy - mine still looks like a second Butt hole quite frankly but at least I’m still orgasmic and it works - I admit I’m a little jealous not choosing a different surgeon originally but I didn’t know about Reddit to make a better decision who I went to originally - Kamol’s web site images are a farce because he’s not doing SRS totally himself obviously anymore , he’s letting inexperienced interns get there scalpel wet and learning - that’s not what I paid for originally and my second time there they damaged my right vocal cord permanently with an intubation tube so voice fem became almost impossible - Yah ! I’ve had some fk’d up surgeries around the world in the last 4 plus years !

Yes, but I been told it&#39;ll be fixed with proper douching and coconut oil and eventually it&#39;ll be normal. But not sure if just colon has that.

A very short time post op I can tell you from experience having Sigmoid  Colon revision   done by Theerapong Nov.2022  , the segment post-op does not have feces going through it anymore and the smelly bacteria disappears in it’s new environment - Post op 8 months it’s just fine but when  using some water lube for dilation douche it out in the shower post dilation gentle water jet works great and you won’t have any smell - it’s basic  girl maintenance Hee ! Hee ! All is good really , it’s a myth of smell unless you don’t do your basic girl maintenance needed part of being female !

Look great to me! Actually very in line with the photos on Dr.Kamol website. Looks like you have some protection for you clit and it is not buried either. I would be more than happy with those results but if I was going for a revision I would ask to trim some of the labia and fuse the top to make more of a hood… I may actually be able to get coverage for Dr.Kamol as he is one of the only surgeons that Ontario Canada works with as far as I know for colon technique and this is making me want to go there even more besides what you said about the sensation and function of the vaginal canal. I am jealous

I’m going after the Vancouver gender clinic with the BC Human rights to pay up for my surgery cost to Theerapong who fixed the canal with an 11 hour surgery in Bangkok ( there stupider than stupid here in BC doing SRS ) and Genoway for not signing out of Country to have Sigmoid , all Genoway wanted was to go to a bloody pelvic floor specialist , idiot thinking that was going to correct depth and girth and the one who actually does PI here in Vancouver Kavanaugh I was never allowed to talk to him and I didn’t like the thought of an Ex Electrical Engineer who spent some years in that profession jumped ship became a GP then Sex reassignment surgeon doing PI trained by Curtis Crane in Texas - Bottom line revisions are very hard to get post op original 1 st time SRS with a different surgeon !!

ok so i had an in-person consult w Theerapon. He said he would be open to working with OHIP (Ontario) but it seems the hospital he works out of doesn&#39;t want to provide itemization of surgical costs and accept payment AFTER the surgery has been completed. His clerical staff seem a little clueless and only know how to talk about money.

Yea, I agree with your opinion about the aesthetic revision trim and fuse the hood which is my main complaint.
</p>
<p>
I went with Dr. Kamol for 2 reasons. One is the insurance, like you mentioned and the other is the colon technique.
</p>
<p>
Everything is great really aside from dysphoric aesthetics
