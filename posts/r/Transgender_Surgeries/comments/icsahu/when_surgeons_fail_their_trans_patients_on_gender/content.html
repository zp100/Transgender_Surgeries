My &#34;oh fuck&#34; meter hit 110% when I saw Dr. Rumer&#39;s name at the end of the first paragraph.  Don&#39;t go to her, seriously.

The article talks to SRS surgeon
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_jess_ting">Dr Jess Ting
</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
‚ÄúAs a surgeon I can tell you every surgeon has bad outcomes,‚Äù Dr. Ting tells Jezebel. ‚ÄúWe all have complications, things don‚Äôt always come out the way we want them to. When you see a pattern of outcomes that suggests that maybe a surgeon isn‚Äôt meeting standards of care, then you feel obliged to speak up.‚Äù
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He&#39;s more than spoken  up, there&#39;s a lawsuit
<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/7820076/22/thompson-v-rumer/">THOMPSON v. RUMER
</a>
filed Feb 1, 2020 against Dr Kathy Rumer, in which the Plaintiff&#39;s counsel (on the trans patient&#39;s side). SRS surgeon
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_maurice_m._garcia">Maurice Garcia

Thank You!  I had, already tossed out Dr. Christine McGinn due to non responsiveness. Dr. Rumer was interested in a consultation, her secretary wanted to schedule me for a consult. I am grateful.

I didn‚Äôt like them either. I‚Äôm on the list for Dr Douglass at Temple but I‚Äôm reconsidering and thinking of going to Mt Sinai in NYC.  I called Rumer once.. but I didn‚Äôt like the attitude.

She has an extremely bad reputation.  Just look through the wiki here.  Don&#39;t go to her unless she&#39;s the only option your insurance allows.  Even then, really think about it.  Some people definitely have acceptable results from her.  But a lot don&#39;t.

Even if the people having problems are outliers, her response to them has disqualified her in my consideration. That&#39;s simply not how I want to be treated if I end up being an outlier, too.

That‚Äôs actually terrifying. When I was looking for surgeons to do top surgery on insurance she was very seriously considered. Glad I went with Dr. Joseph Serletti with Penn.  When I was looking into her I couldn‚Äôt find any of this information.

You can add Laura Garcia-Rodriguez from Henry Ford in Michigan and the whole Transgender services program to this list!! Personal experience from a failed FFS. I get misgendered consistently. My friends that have had no confirmation surgeries get gendered correctly more than me!!!

Gods, I hope so. My insurance has her as one of the only options I have for top surgery and now that I ran her name again and saw that some dude went to her for phalloplasty, I know I&#39;m a dead man if she&#39;s my only choice when that day comes if things don&#39;t change and I don&#39;t have to sue my provider.

It‚Äôs worth bearing that in mind for those who think there‚Äôs a measure of safety having surgery at home rather than
<del>
over ease
</del>
overseas because you can always sue. As has happened many times, and in other countries, it‚Äôs not as simple as that.

All we can do is write about our experiences and people will come across our stories and hopefully they&#39;ll make those decisions for themselves. Some will have excellent experience while others went through a difficult time through the same doctor. The stuff are people too, and in costumer service you can&#39;t keep everyone happy.

I have seen some of Dr. Rumor‚Äôs work on the Wiki and in my humble opinion even the best of her work doesn‚Äôt look like a vulva.  I know some folks have bad  dysphoria and want surgery asap, but really we only get one shot.   From what I‚Äôve seen of her work, I wouldn‚Äôt trust Dr. Rumer to give me a botox injection, let alone srs.
</p>
<p>
With some surgeons, they do not have a lot of training, but I think others just don‚Äôt have any talent.   This leads to a lot of outcomes with significant complications that the doctors don‚Äôt know how to repair.  Any surgery has the risk of poor or unwanted outcomes, but as the article points out we have no way of knowing which doctor is more likely to have complications and the extent and effectiveness of follow-up care.

I hate to judge someone this way, but if it&#39;s because she&#39;s available on insurance where others aren&#39;t, this is a clear indication of a doctor in it for the money, not to help anyone.

That wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all. I think I heard about her trying to get a patient to commit insurance fraud back in 2009-2011 or so. That was enough to turn on all my sirens and I&#39;m beyond floored that she&#39;s still getting recommended to people.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how to ask this without it being super dark, but has she ever killed a patient before given everything she&#39;s done at this point?

I had an experience with a plastic surgeon who demanded that I submit to psychiatric gatekeeping for a plastic surgery routinely provided to cisgender people and that even the WPATH SoC v7 specifically mention should not require psychiatric clearance.
</p>
<p>
I filed a complaint against him.  His office responded that I was neurotic, violent, and didn&#39;t understand the limitations of the surgery.
</p>
<p>
My complaint was dismissed in a way that I felt as if I wasn&#39;t even taken seriously.

The problem is that the community does not stand together. As I stated previously post Brassard in Montreal make us sign a a non picture disclosure form 30 minutes prior to surgery, then go on to perform a a low quality SRS technique based on speed and quantity and not quality and result.
</p>
<p>
The guy has 5 reviews on realself. Do your research and you will find multiple claim of people claiming they have been not been operated by him or Maude Belanger. I personally know for a fact Bensimon does SRS. Yes the FFS doctor there.
</p>
<p>
Instead of supporting each other. The community rather lie to each other to make themselves feel better.
</p>
<p>
My SRS was done 1 hour 36 minute and it looks like crap. I will not and will never recommend people to go to Montreal.
</p>
<p>
Low quality SRS. Huge monopoly since they got pretty much ( some exceptions) all the surgeries in Canada and it‚Äôs covered in all provinces. ( big lobbying).
</p>
<p>
I can‚Äôt speak for Phalo and stuff but as far as vagina‚Äôs????
</p>
<p>
Worst place... final... Whoever says the contrary.
</p>
<p>
Prove it. I know I‚Äôm trying too. Help me so that it‚Äôs mandatory to share to results.

You have my sympathies. I went to Brassard in 2013 because my therapist was invested in participating in my choice and limited me to him or a then-unknown in Europe. I spent so many therapy sessions asking for a letter to go to Suporn, Bowers, McGinn... and every time I got a sales pitch for those to that &#34;they are at least as good, if not better, and far cheaper.&#34;
</p>
<p>
As it turned out, with the USD:CAD exchange rate in late 2012 and early 2013, Brassard was one of the most expensive choices I could have made.
</p>
<p>
A year before surgery, and 6 months before I scheduled, I began asking for a copy of the information packet so that I could make an informed decision. This began a many months run of doing so once or twice a week and being assured by his office that they&#39;d have it in the mail in a couple days but then never. They only thing they did send me was the medical form they needed returned ASAP to schedule (I was under pressure from my HRT Drs to stick to a 2 year have-have-surgery-or-we-stop-prescribing-HRT deadline.) Only after my final payment cleared did they send me the packet I had requested nearly a year prior - after the the deadline for most refunds.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t blame him for the lack of sensation I had because that was why I wanted Suporn - his technique would have worked better with my pre-SRS anatomy - but I definitely fault him for refusing to support me when I had a complication with penetration 1 year after surgery that was not an issue with granulation. All he would tell me was &#34;you need to use more lube and get more relaxed and there is nothing that surgery can do to resolve this.&#34; After 6 months of various treatments that did little to nothing (pelvic physical therapy was the only one that had any effect) I gave up and abandoned dilation as I couldn&#39;t deal with the increasing pain.

Omg I‚Äôm so sorry to hear your story. Did you end up seeing another surgeon to help improve the penetration?
</p>
<p>
And I agree with you. Once you have been operated it‚Äôs goodbye. It‚Äôs still like that right now.
</p>
<p>
Bunch of girls have reached out because of post I did on various social media. And tons of them have horrible stories. So this is not something I‚Äôll let go.
</p>
<p>
There is too much impact on the life of someone once you get discarded or botched by a surgeon . And in his case he seems to be worst and have manage to protect himself by lobbying and controlling everything.

That my therapist had &#34;scrubbed in&#34; on surgery with him (observed, basically; my therapist was licensed as a psych nurse) and she lobbied so hard for her clients to go to him was a red flag for me at the time and I even tried to cancel a month before my surgery date but I was in an abusive marriage where I faced a threat to severely escalate the abuse if I canceled and did not get a 100% refund (my first wife had a fixation on money because she felt that both her and my salary were rightfully her money - she even argued at various points that my contributions to my employer&#39;s 401k plan were stealing from her.)
</p>
<p>
As that last bit probably hints the money was never there for me to get care anywhere else. In particular it had to be covered by insurance or I couldn&#39;t do it, and this was after she had demanded the year prior that I not take any jobs that would have offered inclusive insurance and promising that &#34;money won&#39;t be a problem if you stay with your current employer like I&#39;m asking you to do.&#34; This is also why I never had BA or FFS, both of which I wanted. I&#39;m a few years out of that marriage now and nearing a position where I can have the money to do it so made a post asking for experiences with revision by surgeons who didn&#39;t do the original surgery.

I interested to see what others are saying.

I know one girls that mentioned to Brassard she was going somewhere else and he then offered to redo hers.  In my case it‚Äôs a little more complicate I think he g me up so bad that there is limitation to what someone else can do.

A year or two after that refusal I had I did have a rather fascinating conversation with another patient of his that included something interesting: apparently a number of things like that just get routinely denied in his front office even when they involve very specific medical questions that only the surgeon should be answering.
</p>
<p>
By the way, did you get the fun of the front office losing any of your documents? A few weeks before my surgery they discovered that they did not have on file one of my letters, which was required to even book the surgery in the first place, and And we&#39;re also graciously giving me two weeks to have a new copy and I would lose my surgery date.
</p>
<p>
I definitely disliked the way a whole bunch of information about our ongoing care instructions after we left was given orally by one of the nurses as we were rushing to depart, and when I requested a pen and paper so I could write it down I was told I didn&#39;t need to because it was in the packet, and when I got home I found that one of the few bits I remembered definitely wasn&#39;t in there so I don&#39;t know how much I forgot and had no way to just look up

Yep,that is common. The place has multiple flaws that fails the deontology code of doctors in Quebec.
</p>
<p>
The reason why this place is still running is because he has his hands everywhere to control complaints and legal action.
</p>
<p>
Bensimon which works there was and maybe still the president of plastic surgeon in Quebec and the vice- president in Canada.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs a trap, a rip off place and I will focus my life in exposing them and making  my sure that there is ‚Äúquality‚Äù surgeries offered in Canada.

It happens in every country. They&#39;re like a mafia. This needs to be talked more and more, we can&#39;t live being coerced and nothing is done to expose this business. I&#39;m 6 weeks after srs and my surgeon mistreated me in the worst ways. I couldn&#39;t defend myself because they have such power.  I&#39;m facing complications (happened in surgical act) and he blames to me for it (claiming mental illness), or doesn&#39;t answer my questions. It&#39;s a hell now and hope to recover well but I&#39;m too debilitated to fight right now.

You mean the asclepiad side or not? I would say some of the nurses were wonderful but one of them wouldn&#39;t even look in a small complication I had and would never go in my room (I&#39;ll come back in 10 min then comes back am hour later during my scheduled dilation as a reason to not check...)

Me too and a lot of it was on how to survive if you get bleeding from the vaginal canal which is scary (put the thickest one inside til u stop bleeding and if you gotta go to the ER you need the doctor to be in contact with the surgeon or they can&#39;t touch you.

The Ascl√©piade side was fine for me though I readily acknowledge that undoubtedly had everything to do with who was the nursing staff and is subject to change with turnover.
</p>
<p>
My issue was when I would call or e-mail about an issue after being discharged. Due to actions of my first wife deciding to file away the materials I was given, including the card with the post-surgery contact informatio, and not tell me I was stuck dealing with the front office just as I had when I initially contacted about scheduling years earlier. I only terse responses which insisted &#34;surgery cannot help that problem&#34; even for issues where it actually can.

Wow I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you :( , the form right before surgery sounds fucking scummy. It really sucks that he seems to have pretty much cornered the Canadian GRS market.

If you mean after you were administered anaesthetic drugs then there‚Äôs no consent. Sounds illegal.

As of last month atleast the NDA clearly states it&#39;s in the CMC surgical center and asclepiad and it&#39;s the nurses documents and other patients. Not you or vulva

If you¬¥re going to Thailand for surgery whatever goes wrong, you¬¥ll have to go back and very few surgeons want to do revision surgeries. I know one who does: IM Clinic in Spain. Try to contact and see what he says...

I love my result with Dr. Brassard. He treated me very well. Although I do think his technique is somewhat antiquated, I have a functioning vulva and vagina. He gave me exactly the request I asked for on my labia and clitoris. When I went for my revision on a skin tag, they treated me well. He is very nice. We had a meeting as well.. my only complaint goes back to the complication I had where I almost died during my SRS, and they woke me up to tell me I was loosing a lot of blood and needed a transfusion but that the result was great.. my eyes were barley open. Then they shot me with morphine and I was out for 2 days. The next thing I know I was at the convalescent center. The Nurses at the actual hospital were rude. One stole my cash during surgery.
</p>
<p>
The food was below average.. and I didn‚Äôt like how they treated one of the girls that was staying at the healing center at the same time. She wasn‚Äôt having a smooth recovery whatsoever.. they were blaming her for her pain.. and inability to dilate.. but with me.. they were very attentive.. I didn‚Äôt particularly like the fact that I received zero information on what they did with the testicles. They asked me if I would give consent to donate them for research I declined those forms, however they could‚Äôve still sold them off to an elite or to a 3rd party lab that clones them. And does creepy stuff off planet or underground. Who knows. But in all seriousness I feel bad for everyone that has had a bad experience with Dr. Brassard.. I remember  asking them before surgery if the other Dr. Was going to operate. I repeated to him that I only wanted him to do it. How important it was for me and he basically consoled me and told me not to worry. I got really bad vibes from the Belanger lady. Or whenever the other surgeons are.. I needed Brassards reassurance and I think he suspected that I picked up on some body language and funny business. I can‚Äôt stand surgeons or nurses that laugh and giggle in another language. It puts a bad taste in my mouth. And that‚Äôs what I got from that other surgeon. So I think Brassard took me seriously and he said he was going to make sure to do his best work.. I paid cash. Not sure if that made a difference.
</p>
<p>
He did warn me beforehand at my labia minors would be small, but I requested that. He gave me realistic expectations regarding orgasm and sensation. And although I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with the internal result initially. I always knew there wouldn‚Äôt be any mucosa membrane inside he vagina as it was PI technique. I loved the vulva from the start. So for me it met my expectations. In most ways. And 7 years later after seeing other results and other neo vaginas, I seem to love mine more and more‚Ä¶ it took a little while to adjust and learn her and explore her, but yeah.. I would recommend him compared to a lot of what I‚Äôm seeing posted in photos. However, I am also seeing amazing results like from Dr. Bank and one more doctor in particular that I would prob go to for PPI, over P.I.
</p>
<p>
When I did my SRS I didn‚Äôt have much info on PPI. And the  Colon technique didn‚Äôt resonate with me intuitively. I was too scared to fly to Thailand, getting money wired there seemed more risky. So Brassard was my best choice. I didn‚Äôt like any of the work I was seeing from US surgeons. I have a very neat, clean and juicy result. My vagina does get wet when aroused, but that didn‚Äôt start until year 5.. I was shocked when it started.. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coming from deep inside the vagina per say maybe more so the vulva, but it‚Äôs enough to naturally lube me up inside when aroused. Once I orgasm and cum I get ever more wet. I have clitoral orgasms and then in my sleep I have what I call fully body orgasms where it feels like it comes from deep inside my vagina/belly and it‚Äôs fully body.. amazing. That‚Äôs only started after srs..
</p>
<p>
So yeah..
</p>
<p>
Would I go to Montreal and give Dr. Brassard a hug? Yes.
</p>
<p>
Does hearing about other girls experience anger me. Of course.. I wonder if somethings changed from then till now.
</p>
<p>
Now I will say when I first arrived and everything I felt like I had to people please and be extra nice to everyone and play.. a game almost, because I kept getting weird vibes from staff. They all had bad attitudes, and it felt like had I not been extra nice they would‚Äôve been mean. So that was a little unfortunate.

I also had a very positive experience at GRS montreal.  I&#39;m 5 weeks post op. Brassard said Dr. Pancho would he looking in on the surgery. I have some hyper granulation but like its what it is. I am very happy with my results. Before I was under the knife I met with Dr Brassard briefly and I just got this vibe of kindness and compassion and like I was going to be well taken care of. The anestologist explained everything to me and assured me. The hospital stay was very nice but I chalk that up having a really good roommate and we talked and joked the entire time.
</p>
<p>
The nurses were awesome. The food was great there&#39;s a few meals I forced myself to eat because of intolerance but for the most part it was really good. At Asclepediade they really try to get you to be independent. They show you how to do everything. I was on Lyreca because my leg was numb and had a bit of brainfog and could have used a little bit more monitoring. I was doing my aftercare wrong like to many sits bath not enough showers but that was for like 3 days and I fixed it by rereading the booklet they give. The booklet has like all the information you could need but I kinda wish they had pictures for complications to reference.
</p>
<p>
At one point I was in distress and the night nurse took time to comfort me and check on me. I really appreciated that from him. The house has a beautiful garden in the summer and I found my stay to be exceptional. They went on vacation right after I was discharged but id say they were prompt in replying to my emails. Average 2 days after when on vacation and same day when back.
</p>
<p>
I have read a lot of bad experiences from GRS montreal but I want to share my positive experiences so that people have a more accurate picture.

The problem is that the community does not stand together. As I stated previously post Brassard in Montreal make us sign a a non picture disclosure form 30 minutes prior to surgery, then go on to perform a a low quality SRS technique based on speed and quantity and not quality and result.
</p>

<p>
The NDA pictures was for the other patients and crew working there not yourself. Maybe the English paper is written in broken English but a nurse even took my own phone to take a picture for me (she asked me)

It‚Äôs good if you post the photos and name the surgeon. It helps other people who are considering the same surgeon make an informed choice. It might save someone else going through the same problems you have.

You can post photos without lashing out. A photo and surgeons name is a fact, not an opinion. Its up to others how they interpret it.

I hope you&#39;re seeing a therapist/psych over all this.

It‚Äôs so sad and frustrating. Almost all of us are broke and desperate, so as soon as the stars align, we rush to the only surgeon possible.

I used another popular surgeon for ffs, who got into a heated argument with me immediately prior to surgery, and at the moment of being walked into OR, a paper was handed to me to sign threatening legal action if I revealed to anyone who performed the surgery.  Needless to say, I look as if nothing was done! Desperation, being a long ways from home, and wearing only a surgery robe at that moment kept me from walking away which I should have. They know .

The bill to my insurance was $118,000,  it was daylight when I went into surgery and  around 3pm when I was fully coherent and settling into my room after. So maybe 5 hours was all I was in the OR for complete ffs! Not very long .

I was extremely mistreated  by dr Javier Belinky in Argentina. He belongs to the wpath but that isn&#39;t a guarantee of humanity or decency. He&#39;s very aggressive and will dismiss ANY complication you have,  even when they&#39;re usual ones, but belinky wil blame YOU for it.
</p>
<p>
It happens in every country. They&#39;re like a mafia. This needs to be talked more and more, we can&#39;t live being coerced and nothing is done to expose this business. I&#39;m 6 weeks srs and my surgeon mistreated me in the worst ways (blaming on health, disobeying his guidelines, etc etc etc). I couldn&#39;t defend myself because they have such power and know we are vulnerable.  I&#39;m facing complications and he blames to me for it, or doesn&#39;t answer my questions. Life It&#39;s a hell now and hope to recover well but I&#39;m too weak to fight right now. I have recorded phonecalls with his aggressive words and accusations.  They know that blaming us for their bad praxis and unethic inhuman behavior is what works best.
</p>
<p>
Just want to say that he maybe (not sure but possibly was him) sent to me a psychiatrist that to my surprise, was a gay guy...and they share lawyers and credibility. Exactly a mafia. The could make me go suicidal if they want, then blame my &#34;mental health x etc etc&#34;..
</p>
<p>
This needs to be exposed! I&#39;m on tears for the girls and boys that have ruined lives after going to monsters of a surgeon!

If it&#39;s from his Team, I imagine who can be, maybe A.H.? That&#39;s another sickfuck, I have talked with lots of Buenos Aires&#39;s transmen that were in the same group back in 2011, and they all told me the horrible verbal abusive things that psychiatrist said to them in the interviews at the GAPET. He even was selling the DNI in the black market,
<strong>
completely illegal activity
</strong>
...they&#39;re just a bunch of twisted psychopaths.
</p>
<p>
And Belinky (JdM), sure, he behaves like he cares, on IG and in TV interviews, conferences, seminars, because he knows exactly what people expect him to show, and gain our trust.
</p>
<p>
He looks &#39;&#39;adorable &amp; sweet&#39;&#39; on Instagram/Facebook, i&#39;ts SHAMEFUL, but let me tell you that&#39;s a sickfuck of a person, a lier, a psychopath. It&#39;s difficult to believe but no one will erase the horrible experience I had with him. I can forgive normal errors, being in burnout and having a bad day, but why verbally aggressive?
</p>
<p>
I have recordings (phonecalls and audio from the clinic, and all the texts) showing his real personality disorder, his hatred toward transgender women, he often talks with other colleagues/surgeons and refers to us in manners and ways that are absolutely dehumanizing and disgusting.
<br>
<strong>
These surgeons do NOT like him, I swear you.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
He chooses some patients and treat them amazingly well (it&#39;s a masquerade) because he uses them later for marketing convenience, and that&#39;s exactly WHY I ended up in his hands: trusting his other patients.
</p>
<p>
I did NOTHING to receive his hate, his sick mistreatments, I was mindfucked once and again for no reason, I barely stabilized myself, and then he came back with gaslighting and destabilizing me again, and immediately
<em>
blaming me for being destabilized!
</em>
He couldn&#39;t see me recover and happy for a fuckin minute....what a sickfuck!
</p>
<p>
I will be telling this truth all my life and beyond, he can sue me and do anything, I will be exposing him,
<strong>
forever
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
Where are you from?
<br>
I recommend you two Teams: Dr Fidalgo (La Plata), and Dr Lizzi - Manavella (Rosario), they&#39;re not in the wpath business, and helped and supported me all the post-op stage with kindness and humanity.

Thank you for posting this and shedding light!!! Surgeons that work in transgender care need to be more held accountable when they don‚Äôt reach the patients needs. I feel that a lot of surgeons in trans care half ass the surgeries who are paid for by insurance which is ridiculous. I understand mistakes can happen but some surgeons have ghosted their patients after botching them once they got paid. For example Dr Ting

Traveling overseas for any surgery is a scary experience, even more so when the surgery is unavailable in ones own country.
</p>
<p>
After less than positive initial interactions with several Thai clinics I contacted IM Gender clinic in Spain and the response was efficient and professional, and before I agreed to anything I had a video consult with the surgeon who would actually perform the work, talked about my fears and needs, and agreed on the proceedure required.
</p>
<p>
The clinic experience itself was very good, all the staff caring and professional, and after care - both in Spain and by video/email since my return - undertaken by the surgeon herself, with all fears and questions attended to.  Now at 10 weeks, I am happy with the results, and slowly returning to my normally very physical life.
</p>
<p>
With the cost being comparable to the more popular Thai surgeons, IM Gender is well worth considering.

oh omg i know this situation all too well unfortunately with my own orchiectomy below last year i should have realized something was wrong when the surgeon was all to eager to say he could help me he helped me alright into 9 months of agonizing pain and a second surgery to fix what ever he did to me in the first surgery. it was not good now i fear moving forward with breast surgery and facial surgery cause i do not know what will happen to me in those additional surgeries in life?

I was told, and I&#39;ll let you know in Nov,  but sitting long term was something I was told would be out for a while.  Movies tend to be several hours!  Seems like a bad idea to me

I probably could have if there wasn&#39;t the covid-19 concern. Though I don&#39;t like movie theaters in general so I probably wouldn&#39;t.

I know someone who had a catastrophic failure from her clinic. Whole canal graf failed. It&#39;s rare and was the first and probably still only time that has happened for her practice. Anyways they took care of them l. It took a year of healing before going back in to try again to create the canal. Second time took and now they look good and have everything as it should be as far as they told me.
</p>
<p>
I also know another friend who was worked on by Dr. Ley directly. She&#39;s having a lot of complications around healing and depth. The fact that getting to Dr. Ley requires a plane trip is not helping. It&#39;s a complicated story that hasn&#39;t ended yet. None the less, Dr. Ley and her clinic is not abandoning her and is doing everything to help.
</p>
<p>
Not to scare you that she doesn&#39;t do good work, obviously she does amazing work. However if things do go wrong she doesn&#39;t seem to be the type to abandon. Instead she helps fix it. Heck I might of considered her if she offered the techniques that my circumstances required.

I also want to put up here that Dr. Joseph Pariser in the state of Minnesota is someone you DO NOT want to go to. I needed revision surgery but I could not afford to fly back to Thailand, so I went to Joseph Pariser and he promised to do fix my left labia minora which was mostly gone. The only parts that I had left was the clitoral hood and a tiny piece of fleshy tissue just below the clitoral hood. What he did was made an incision down near the vaginal entrance, then took out some of the excess tissue/flesh and sewed me back together and called it good. Didn&#39;t even try to reconstruct my left labia minora and did NOT even do as I asked to match the left labia minora to the right one which he said he would try to do but just half assed it. Now I am trying to get the money up to fly back to Thailand and the money to pay my Thai doctor to fix what was messed up.
</p>
<p>
So trust me when I say DO NOT go to Joseph Pariser if you can avoid it. He and his nurse consider the labia minora to not only be the labia lip but the folds between the labia minora and the labia majora. This falls under medical negligence and now I am healing up and wondering if my surgeon in Thailand can even fix what this doctor did.

I had a surgery with Dr Ji≈ô√≠ Vesel√Ω in Brno, Czech Republic on the 7th of November 2022. The result is terrible. Very ugly, very asymetric, a lot of excess skin hanging around, still painful, some parts are not sensitive, huge clitoris which is essentially a penis head left almost as it was. Depth is max 7 cm. It&#39;s all still a bit swollen after one year. I have incontinence. I looked at a bunch of granny&#39;s vaginas to see if I can compare and accept the look of mine but I could never find something so ugly. It basically looks like the one of the first attempts of a moderately experienced surgeon who learnt how to do these surgeries on YouTube.
</p>
<p>
I tried to sue him but apparently the forensic doctor thinks the result is not so terrible so he told me I will lose the lawsuit if I go for it and I better use my money for a revision abroad if I am not happy with how it&#39;s done here.
</p>
<p>
As far as I know, Dr Vesel√Ω&#39;s results are considered amongst the best here in Czech Republic so I don&#39;t even want to imagine what are the worst...
</p>
<p>
I went for all this unforeseen ordeal just because it was covered by my healthcare insurance and I didn&#39;t expect such an outcome. If I knew, I would never go for that.
</p>
<p>
So, from that perspective, if you&#39;re in Czechia and want a surgery, look abroad.

i reached out to rumer on simple release, and unlike cranects her response was prompt. i didnt take her up on it because i didnt want to find out how she could mess up even simple release. unfortunately, she&#39;s currently the only surgeon who would do simple release that is covered by my insurance. :T so i&#39;m trying to save up for out-of-pocket costs.

SRS is investing in your health so I would go oversees,  but never to Thailand. I&#39;d go to a safer place in Europe with a surgeon with plenty of experience and if there&#39;s something I do not like, he can fix it. No out of pocket surprises as you can experience in the U.S.

Unfortunately I can confirm everything this article says about what can happen with Rumer SRS. It wasn‚Äôt me but rather someone close to me who was her patient, but I was there for the appointments, saw the results, heard her minimizing all the problems etc. Both the complications described and her attitude towards patients who have problems is exactly as reported here.

The same can be said for Garcia-Rodriguez from Henry Ford in Michigan, I had a sub par FFS in December that I consistently get misgendered due to the practitioner (I will not use Dr. or anything relating to a professional) and her STUDENT doing the least amount of work in regards to the procedures that were done to say it was a completed surgery. Her definition of a lip lift still has my philtrum at a measurement of 15.5 mm which is considered the longest a male philtrum should be. A female philtrum should be between 11-13mm!!! On top of that my brows are now back on my brow bone where they were pre surgery and not above like 90-95% of females and I still have a considerable brow bone due to her half ass type 3 reduction. Her solution to not have the protrusion above my nose was to put bone paste there to smooth out the transition instead of removing the bone. So add mass to create a more masculine face than to remove to create a feminine face?!?!? What a special type of practitioner she is!!!

I think all doctors should have a report card that shows how many surgeries they have performed and how many have failed. And there should be a WHO portal created so that ordinary people like us can know which doctor is good at what and which is bad. And doctors will also do good work for their reputation. What do you think, am I wrong?

I couldn&#39;t get very far into that because it was already too disgusting and heartbreaking how the doctor was mistreating their patient.

Don‚Äôt go to Gupta either. He‚Äôs the one that gave me the approval and then backed out of it and never showed up. If my doctor now did the surgery with no problem so could he have. I will never recommend him.still thinking of going after him now.
