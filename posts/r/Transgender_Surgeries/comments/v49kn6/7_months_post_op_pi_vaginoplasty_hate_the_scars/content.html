Virtually no feeling for the clitoris. What poor attempt was made to construct labia just looks like testicular skin hanging there.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is still painful and the granulation at the base of the v healed too tight.
</p>
<p>
Wish I hadn&#39;t bothered, if I knew it would this bloody obvious I would never had it done. What&#39;s the bloody point if every time I see it I just reminds me I&#39;m not CIS ?
</p>
<p>
If it wasn&#39;t for the scarring I could probably live with the lack of sensation but now it looks crap as well as not working
</p>

It doesn&#39;t look as bad as you think, and while the scars are obvious, the anatomy itself looks good by eye. The scars can be fixed in a simple revision, probably by excision, but you should see a surgeon for a consultation. I highly recommend seeing another surgeon for the revision.
</p>
<p>
Return of sensation can take a long time, and I&#39;ve heard of it taking a year. Give your body time to heal, and if after a year there are still problems, you should absolutely see a surgeon for a revision both with respect to function and to take care of the external scars.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s gonna be okay; hang in there and be persistent &lt;3

Thank you for seeing the issue as I do. I can&#39;t face seeing him again anyway and have requested for someone else to fix it.
</p>
<p>
I have just had enough, I can&#39;t take it any more and just want to be like any other girl. Also not helping that I found out I have COVID this morning and feel absolutely crap ðŸ˜¢

Sustain SRS pain ? well no I wasn&#39;t and that&#39;s why I&#39;m such  a mess emotionally. Worst pain of my life and they wouldn&#39;t give me anything that worked. Probably made the scarring worse by being in so much pain and constantly crying :/

I got told I would require a genital examination by HIM. What&#39;s the bloody point ? If he couldn&#39;t be arsed to make  it look tidy the first time what would be different if he had another go.
</p>
<p>
This whole thing is a fucking disaster and I wish I had died rather than &#34;lived&#34; thorough the last seven months.

I actually really like your vulva and how neat the labia are. The scarring definitely needs work for sure and possibly resuturing but everything is definitely fixable

You can use silicone gel to reduce the scar appearance, in case you were unsure. I&#39;ve looked up a lot of the research and it does seem to actually work.
</p>
<p>
â€‹
</p>
<p>
As for the esthetics, honestly it looks pretty all right to me; there&#39;s a LOT of variation among appearance both for cis and trans women; you do of course have the option of getting an esthetic revision that&#39;d cost less and be faster recovery.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Hope things get to a better point for you.

Microneedling and dermabrasion can be used to reduce the appearance of scars. Iâ€™ve done it before on my own surgical scars, although the procedures were done on my abdomen. The genital area is obviously much more sensitive, so Iâ€™m not sure if those procedures are viable there, but you can visit a local med spa for a consultation and see what they recommend.

I have just tried so hard making the rest of me as good as I possibly can, like really hard. Everything I have done over the last four years, stopping smoking, giving up alcohol, going through all the social transition crap, losing most of my friends, my partner and my job. After all that I actually look, sound ok and pass easily most of the time... Until I look in the mirror and that huge ugly unnatural purple / red scar pointing at the useless, painful hole that I still have to dilate once a day.
</p>
<p>
All he had to do was take his time doing some bloody stitches, I wasn&#39;t even worth his time spending an extra few minutes doing a tidy job.
</p>
<p>
Look on here for what Tina and Larner can do in the UK. Then look at mine. Most of their work looks better at 7 weeks than mine does at seven months. It doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to figure out who my surgeon was, does it.

I&#39;m on medication for PTSD and depression because of the pain I was left in and because looking at the mess I have been left with every day for the last seven months had driven me to attempt suicide.  I&#39;m not comparing mine to anyone elses so I have no idea where you get the idea misogyny or transphobia is involved ?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m pisssed off my useless fucking crotch looks like crap and doesn&#39;t work. FFS I&#39;m having to wear a pad 24 / 7 because of urine being stuck where the bottom of the V healed too tight and it feels like I wet myself when it comes out.

I am very sorry for the physical symptoms you&#39;re experiencing and the poor visual results. You deserved better treatment from your surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen almost nothing but people outright denying your experiencing and glossing over the physical pain you&#39;re experiencing and the difficulty in your healing process, in favor of reassuring you about the appearance of your vulva.
</p>
<p>
The stitches did not look well done or properly placed to me. The distribution of the fat in the labia shifts a lot when you are in certain positions, in a way I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere. I think it is entirely justified to be dissatisfied with those results.
</p>
<p>
However, I also want you to know that this doesn&#39;t change your worth and value as a person, as a partner, as a woman. The cosmetic results are not going to be unsightly to everyone who is attracted to you, partners might think it&#39;s odd or different but this will not stop people from loving and desiring you and finding your body
<em>
and
</em>
vulva attractive. It does not make you less of a woman or less legitimate either, even if it might feel that way.
</p>
<p>
You deserve to have your pain and complications acknowledged and hopefully, revised by a proper surgeon. You also deserve to be reassured earnestly that you are not somehow ruined because of this.
</p>
<p>
If you find my comment unhelpful, please feel free to disregard it. I hope you find a solution.

Things are really awful right now but I believe that you will be okay. You will heal with time and you will likely be able to find a competent surgeon that can revise this to a better result. You deserve love and compassion as you are and as you will be. ðŸ«‚

I must say thanks again for this. I have started using the silicone scar strips again and I am more optimistic.
</p>
<p>
Failing that I will probably go for a butterfly tattoo to cover it up. I don&#39;t like the hairy look ha ha.

The colour may fade but I will still have a 1cm wide V with that shiny texture that is different from normal skin. Hair will not grow on the scar so unless I grow a huge Bush (not happening) it&#39;s always going to be there.

He could have avoided by stitching it together better. It was an absolute mess the first time I seen it and if anything is has been getting bigger.
</p>
<p>
Honestly I have considered cutting it out myself and just letting anyone with half a clue in A&amp;E stitch it back together. I very much doubt they could do a worse job than he did.

You can improve it a lot with medical tattooing. Its used for this kind of thing.

Honestly my first thought when I saw this photo was that the results look amazing. Personally I donâ€™t find the scars to be an issue but I understand why they would upset you

It upsets me because they are very bloody obvious and could have been avoided if he gave a crap and tried to do a good job.

Thereâ€™s plenty of bad surgeons around and the only thing we can really do about it is avoid them. Post results, names, and encourage others to research and do the same. Help those who follow you.
