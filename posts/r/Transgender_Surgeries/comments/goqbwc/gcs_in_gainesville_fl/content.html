My GCS surgery was done at UF/Shands on 7 Feb 2019. There were two lead surgeons (Dr Bruce Mast from Plastics, and Dr Laurence Yeung from Urology). Based on the number of others present in surgical prep, there well may have been a small group of 2nd tier docs there also.
</p>
<p>
I almost did not get my surgery, and for the most arcane reason. About a year before my surgery, Dr Mast got a big promotion. He got promoted to head of surgery at UF/Shands. That increased his admin workload to the point where he stopped accepting appointments from GCS patients. It was only by the oddest sequence of referrals, plus a back-channel call from Dr Yeung to Dr Mast, that he decided to &#39;do one more&#39;. I may well have been his last, out of roughly 15.
</p>
<p>
But that may not be the end of the story, as UF/Shands is a teaching hospital. I know of at least one other candidate who has been interviewed by Plastics, about 6 months ago. So the situation there seems to be fluid. I know they were looking to hire a surgeon with MtF experience, so maybe they are working one in here or there, using staff that had been present (and learning) from the 15 or so that were done on site.
</p>
<p>
They treated me very well, and I would recommend them highly, assuming they&#39;re still doing procedures. It was incredibly handy to have my surgery done only 35 miles from my home, and 20 miles from where I was staying at the time. I know one or two of the previous MtF done there, whom I spoke with prior to my surgery via my own connections. Different people had different outcomes, one barely wanted to discuss it, other than it went OK.

Ftm here, had my surgeries at UF Gainesville...top surgery with Dr Mast in 2016 and this past feb 6th of 2020 had RFF bottom surgery with Dr Chim. Bottom surgery was supposed to be a 2 week stay but turned into 2 months when i refused to stay another day. Dr Chim was great but the nurses caring for me were NEW or students the entire time I was in there. Most of the ICU nurses were very inexperienced and as a result I got an infection that could never seem to be resolved. It was a complete nightmare of an experience. My results are questionable as I am still healing. I just want to say that anyone who has to go there should be highly aware of everything going on and question everything...you have to advocate for yourself strongly.

Agreed, and mostly because they have not done enough procedures to know
<strong>
all
</strong>
the ins and outs. Someone who had MtF surgery there before I did, remarked &#34;they did not give great aftercare instructions&#34;. I will second that. I really think they have a great team, but still understanding atypical things that can happen.

When I called in roughly January they gave me the impression that UFâ€™s trans care is on pause.

Yes, that is what they have been telling people since (roughly) late 2017. I&#39;m not sure what the dynamic is behind the scenes, other than what I wrote above. My view is that I came in thru  a side door, by pure luck, but there may be a different explanation.

Yes. Also note (on the Dr Mast page) a Dr Harvey Chim. He is (or was, maybe still is) doing the FtM procedures. Both of those doctors have my extreme gratitude for giving me something I might not have otherwise been able to achieve.
</p>
<p>
Also, this doctor at Endocrinology. Note the last sentence in his bio. I don&#39;t think he specializes in trans medicine, but he is well aware of the guidelines and appropriate endo care.
