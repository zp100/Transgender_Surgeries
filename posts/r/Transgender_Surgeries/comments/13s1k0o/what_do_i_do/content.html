Before I start I just want to say please do not comment saying ‚Äúdid you not have electrolysis etc before surgery‚Äù, yes I did, I had a lot of sessions and a follicular scrape but still have some regrowth inside me
</p>
<p>
I had my grs in December last year and I‚Äôve unfortunately had hair regrowth inside my vagina despite having multiple electrolysis sessions and my surgeon telling me she would do a follicular scrape, it isn‚Äôt a lot of hair but again there is hair there, I‚Äôm just wondering what the best thing for me to do is? I havnt had any problems with the hair regrowth inside the vaginal canal, but I do want to sort this all out whilst I‚Äôm still young and so I won‚Äôt have to worry about this for the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
I had an appointment with my surgeons lead nurse (last time I saw my surgeon was 5 days after my surgery in the hospital before I went home) I‚Äôve since had 2 appointments at the clinic for checkups and again not seen my surgeon only her head nurse, but in my appointment nearly 2 weeks ago now I asked about my hair regrowth inside and the nurse said to put hair removal cream on my dilator and put it inside of me? I thought she was joking as it would obviously burn my insides? She then said I could just pluck the hairs out of their instead? But I don‚Äôt want to be dealing with that for the rest of my life? And also would like to add which I found a bit unprofessional on her end, after I suggested the colon revision she was against the colon revision and said a lot of surgeons don‚Äôt like doing that surgery and also asked me directly would I really want to walk around with a vagina to smell like poo? I thought that was very innapropriate and unprofessional on her end.
</p>
<p>
I had my GRS funded by the NHS here in the UK and I asked about a potential revision and the nurse said the GRDNN won‚Äôt fund a revision surgery for me? But yet they have funded one of my friends revision surgery for her scars, but yet won‚Äôt fund a revision surgery for me to redo my vaginal canal which to me is more of a actual threat? I felt a bit took back when the nurse told me that, as I pay a lot of tax every single year and the way I look at it as my tax goes towards the nhs I would‚Äôve been funding myself?
</p>
<p>
Idk I just don‚Äôt know what to do so any advice is appreciated
</p>
<p>
Long story short: I have hair regrowth inside my vagina, yes I‚Äôve had electrolysis etc but still have Regrowth. Nurse told me I can‚Äôt have a revision on the nhs and to dilate with hair removal cream, what do I do as I want to get this sorted whilst I‚Äôm young :)

What insane advice! Hair is regrowing there since not all hair follicles were eradicated. Hair grows in several cycles including when they are dormant. That is why total removal can take many passes.
</p>
<p>
Nair cream nor plucking will never eradicate the growth. To even conteplate using Nair cream at the Introitus is medically wrong and potentially harmful. Plucking is somwhat more effective but may well not be permant and it hurts.
</p>
<p>
There is only one permanent fix and that is Blend Elecrolysis on the offending hair. Not an easy task to find anyone sufficiently skilled in this process.
</p>
<p>
The longer term approach is to get it done properly the first time

Unfortunately the only permanent solution would be revision surgery to replace the skin graft. Sigmoid colon is a perfectly valid option and doesn&#39;t smell. That&#39;s just nonsense.
</p>
<p>
But it is a major procedure and you will likely have to fight to get it funded.
</p>
<p>
Plucking every now and then might be something you could eventually get comfortable with, but it&#39;s up to you, of course.
</p>
<p>
May I ask who your surgeon was?
