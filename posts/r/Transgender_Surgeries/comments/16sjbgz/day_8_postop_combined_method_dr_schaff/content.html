You don&#39;t have to stop hormones. Just stop taking anti-androgens 2 weeks ahead, as they can cause complications with amnesthesia. The aftercare was pretty good from the doctors, although a few of the nurses had a really hard time dealing with the fact that I had autism. But generally, it was pretty nice staying there, only the last few days were hard because of PTSD/anxiety disorder related issues that I got in a clinic when I was young. I give the stay a 4/5.

No. All I was required to do is not shave down there for the 3 weeks before surgery, so to make sure they have long enough hair to remove them. The day before the surgery I was given CitraFleet to make sure my intestines were empty - this is done in order to make sure that, in case they do accidentally cut into my intestines, there wasn&#39;t any concerns about infections. If that happens, they just clean it, sew it, and then you&#39;re on IV food for a few days, but it generally never happens according to their disclosed statistics.
</p>
<p>
They also tell you exactly what to do in the surgery confirmation email anyways.

heh that&#39;s the case his secretary forgot to send me the email, and I&#39;m having the surgery in two weeks, so I&#39;m not really sure if I should prepare in any way
</p>
<p>
(I asked the clinic, they confirmed I don&#39;t have to stop hormones, so did my endo)
</p>
<p>
thank you for the reply

hi, it went well, I&#39;m recovering
</p>
<p>
everything is healing well, I feel better and better with every day. The doctor told me that the surgery was even easier than usual
</p>
<p>
can&#39;t really say anything about the outcomes yet - it&#39;s all bandaged up
