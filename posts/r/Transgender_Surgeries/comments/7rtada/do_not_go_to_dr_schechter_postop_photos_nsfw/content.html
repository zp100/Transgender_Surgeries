Thanks for sharing! I&#39;m really sorry that you&#39;re not happy with your results. Have you explored the possibility of revision surgery?

I&#39;d like to yet I will need some proof of how viable a revision would be. Schechter does NOT post his photos publically on his website and I don&#39;t really know what my options are, I&#39;d rather not go to him unless he was observing with bowers with the knife and he&#39;d be fronting the total expenses.
</p>
<p>
More so, I was hoping maybe this post could point me to a surgeon that has experience with such a situation and I could confirm it via connecting with the individual that got the similar revision related to the corpus sponge.

Yep, the strange thing is that there&#39;s no follow-up photo of the labiaplasty or the vaginal depth procedure, which also includes a labiaplasty.

Not yet. I am not willing and don&#39;t have insurance that covers a revision, the funds, or a support system necessary for a revision, which would also include a deepening of the vaginal canal.

What is the opening facing upwards? Is it the urethral opening?  I don&#39;t see a urethral opening elsewhere, so I guess so. But if it&#39;s the case, then it&#39;s a bit strange because it looks your pee would shoot in front instead of directly down the toilet.

Yeah, it&#39;s a bit strange. The urethra is situated next clit pointing up and too close.  I&#39;ve peed on myself even with great care and patience in some cases too. The sad thing is that he has a book and is &#39;trusted&#39; in the medical community. Every trans woman I&#39;ve met has had a labia tear complication and my doctor&#39;s other patients have gone to him because he takes a county health care. They&#39;ve also were not getting the desired results and not much depth either. I&#39;d be happy to answer any more questions!  I&#39;ve been really struggling with my outcomes and the consequence it&#39;s had on my mental health and my confidence in many parts of my life. Thanks for asking, it&#39;s nice to get it out there after a couple years.

Thank YOU! It takes a lot of courage to overcome the feelings such as shame to post your own picture in order to warn others.
</p>
<p>
Your condition looks like hyperspadia, though it was surgically introduced instead of congenital.  (In case you don&#39;t know what it is, watch the video in this page:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypospadias">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypospadias
</a>
)
</p>
<p>
In addition, it looks obvious that there is a lot of erectile tissue remaining. If you feel uncomfortable when aroused, have you considered another surgery to remove the remaining erectile tissue? The urethral opening might be adjusted more backwards (i.e. lower) during the same surgery.

Thank for the perspective. Do you have any trans-specific documented timelines of such a surgical situation you propose? I only ask because this is part of the rubric of feeling I can consider a revision.

Probably you can have a check here.

</a>
Images 3, 4 and 7 look similar to your condition.  It&#39;s only a proof of principle that such surgeries can be done. It&#39;s just an example which comes to my mind. There could be other examples but I couldn&#39;t recall at the moment. I&#39;m neither recommending to you nor warning you against any surgeon.  You have to contact a few surgeons yourselves and make your own decision. Cheer you up!

<strong>
Hypospadias
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Hypospadias is a congenital disorder of the urethra where the urinary opening is not at the usual location on the head of the penis. It is the second-most common birth abnormality of the male reproductive system, affecting about one of every 250 males at birth. In roughly 90% of cases, the opening (meatus) is on or near the head of the penis (glans), referred to as distal hypospadias, while the remainder have proximal hypospadias with a meatus near or within the scrotum. Shiny tissue seen extending from the meatus to the tip of the glans, which would have made the urinary channel, is referred to as the urethral plate.

The top one is one month and the rest are two years. The problem is that my corpus sponge is too enlarged then engorge, this was consistent through the whole healing process, as I have observed for myself first hand. I almost wonder if the tissue could go on the outer labia

My surgery outcomes have devastated my confidence in regards to my romantic and platonic relationships. I am a bit happier yet dysphoria has shifted to the many cosmetic, and practical problems.
</p>
<p>
I do like how I look in a bathing suit but I would not have gotten surgery with Schechter if I knew that my dysphoria would just be shifted to new types of dysphoria and mental health challenges particular to what I have stated, which is not a total description, as this is pretty hard to talk about for the first time publically on the internet.

I&#39;m so sorry. What an awful situation. It must have felt like a lonely situation and it&#39;s really brave to share. Hopefully you speaking up will help others.

<p>
I suspect your trust levels  for surgeons is low right now, but have thought about asking another doctor to do a revision? I suspect that a lot could be done to help you.

What if you fix the plumbing problem first? That could be done by a urologist. I guess there are more urologists than sex-change surgeons. I don&#39;t know what your insurance plan is, but I guess if you fix it because you experience problems when peeing, then it probably would not be considered cosmetic surgery, as urinating is a basic human body function. Yeah, just guessing. You need to ask and find out more information. But if you really go this way, then you may have to undergo surgery again if you decide to do labiaplasty and/or deepening.
