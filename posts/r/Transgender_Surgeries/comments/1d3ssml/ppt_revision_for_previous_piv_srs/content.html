Yeah this is exactly why PPT should primarily be a revision option. You still have the ability to have it for depth extension, which you wouldn’t if you had done it first and lost depth. Dr. Pang is a good option if you want to go that route in SF. That said Ley may provide an alternative option to this, she dislikes peritoneal tissue for these surgeries (for good reason from experience).

Thanks for your input; I’ll look into Pang also when I’m consulting with the others in SF this year

I know ppt revision is possible for canal recovery.  It&#39;s a very nice option.  As for a tissue replacement due to regrowth, I have no idea.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard of such a thing.  Given that it was 5 years ago, it seems like it would be pretty anchored to you.  It&#39;s good that you&#39;re planning to see several surgeons.  Dr Bowers probably isn&#39;t going to be much help.  It sounds uncomfortable to me.  I hate uncomfortable consults.  Curious why Dr Jun isn&#39;t on your list.  He worked on me and I found him to be very painstaking.  He literally was in me for 9 hours.  Dr RBL is a fine option but a very long list.  Dr Wittenberg is quicker but cash only and not inexpensive.  I don&#39;t know much about Dr Ley.
</p>
<p>
edit:  my bad.  Dr Wittenberg does accept a few select few insurance plans but limited.  They&#39;re on the website.

Thank you for taking time to write this! Min Jun is on my list, but when I reached out to his office, I was told he is not taking any revision consultations at this time :/ … so I won’t be able to see him for the time being. I’ve been told by gynos that basically they think I have to live with it, try electrolysis (but too far to reach in the back of the canal) or have it surgically cauterized or removed. So I’m hoping with a depth revision using PPT hybrid type method, the scrotal graft could be replaced with peritoneal tissue, but I guess my consults will let me know what my options are. Yes, this is very embarrassing and uncomfortable. Thankfully I have a long time partner who doesn’t care, but if I was single and dating I would be so embarrassed and discouraged that suitors would feel the hair. Meeting with Bowers I think may help me to get some closure, as she left me with this issue, based on her poor advice. If anyone takes anything away from this, if you are getting PIV or SRS overall, make sure electrolysis is fully completed on the skin that will be inside of the vagina, unless you are prepared for the possibility of having long hairs grow deep in your vagina…

Oh I didn&#39;t know that.  He may be trying to clear a backlog of patients, and I know he&#39;s working overtime to get his insurance billing set up.

I agree, and would stress electro over laser.  It&#39;s got a longer track record of permanency.  It&#39;s expensive, painful, and time consuming, but it&#39;s better than having hair return.  Best of luck getting it resolved!

this makes so much sense now why you were trolling on my Weinfeld post, you’re yet another of the bizarre Jun cult, you people just need to leave it alone, at some point you’re just hurting people
