that I was thinking of switching, and got several replies and PMs.  I&#39;ll talk about why I&#39;m switching at the end of this write-up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
McGinn Consult
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had an in-person consult with Dr. McGinn where I talked to her for over an hour, briefly talked to an RN of hers, and also talked to her insurance/scheduling person.  There was also a brief (&lt;2 minutes) physical examination.  She first went through her spiel - which I also received a written summary of - and then we did Q&amp;A.  I&#39;ll try to summarize her speech:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
PI with scrotal graft; she emphasized that, other than the scrotum, the rest is a flap, not a graft.  Takes 2-3 hours, Typically get 6 inches depth, note that it is typically less stretchy or girthy than a cis vagina
</li>
<li>
Will have some lubrication in the labia area, especially during arousal, but not in the vagina itself.  The labia minora is pink, like in many cis women.
</li>
<li>
Covid-free hospital, must be tested in advance.  Recommend to
<strong>
drive
</strong>
for the surgery, get the test on Monday morning, and have surgery on Tuesday.  If Covid+, reschedule for two weeks later.
</li>
<li>
Surgery takes 2-3 hours, on bedrest for 48 hours after.  Will be in the the area (New Hope, PA) for 2 weeks total, have 2 follow-up appointments the week after surgery.  In the hospital for 3 days after surgery, then stay in the local area.  There is a B&amp;B along the Delaware River (
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/GAIA+Guest+House/@40.3568486,-74.9511163,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!3m7!1s0x89c3ff46b41efc7d:0x51362fb79e668d99!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d40.3568486!4d-74.9489276">Gaia House</a>
), ~1-2 miles from her
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/4+Gazebo+Pl,+New+Hope,+PA+18938/@40.3582203,-74.9772935,213m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c400a3042b017d:0xfd27d07eb3214ea6!8m2!3d40.35822!4d-74.976746">office (approximate location)</a>
, that she recommends for patients, though there are other options as well.  A &#34;surgical buddy&#34; can stay with you at the hospital, unless they test positive for Covid.
</li>
<li>
Must be off HRT for 2 weeks beforehand and 1 week after; I didn&#39;t ask what this means for injections, but will, though I assume that the 2 weeks starts at the end of your previous injection cycle.  Stop P a month before, restart P after 6 months.
</li>
<li>
Can work after 6 weeks, though full recovery takes 6 months.  Can run for exercise after 6 weeks.
</li>
<li>
Hair removal is not required, but highly recommended.  5-6 months of full clear on the penis, scrotum, a bit above the penis, and a tiny amount of the perineum.  A set of photos for hair removal is provided.  She does do follicle scraping for a few stragglers, but really recommends hair removal to get as much as possible.
</li>
<li>
BMI of 18-28 is required.
</li>
<li>
Two later follow-ups, at 6-8 weeks, and at 6 months.
</li>
<li>
Iron supplements are required for 2 months prior to surgery.  Low-dose T is recommended after.  She has developed a cream that can mix E, T, and P per patient needs, this could be an alternative to other forms of HRT post-op.
</li>
<li>
Her write-up says that they schedule 6 months in advance, but her office told me that it&#39;s usually more like 3-4.  They work with all insurance, but are not in-network for any of them.  For my insurance (Aetna), her office did say that they could/would file a &#34;GAP exception&#34; to have Dr. McGinn treated as in-network for me; apparently this is pretty standard, for Aetna at least.
</li>
<li>
A $3500 deposit is required to schedule.
</li>
<li>
Typically does 150/year, been doing this since 2007, does do some other surgeries for trans people.
</li>
<li>
0.6% of patients have a blood clot, and 0.6% have a fistula, usually due to a previous condition.  The latter you&#39;ll need a colostomy bag for, though it will typically heal on its own after 6 months.
</li>
<li>
Bloodwork, a physical, and an X-ray are needed beforehand.
</li>
<li>
Dilation starts at 4/day and ends at 1/week, will adjust based on individual patient needs.
</li>
<li>
Douching is not required, it&#39;s a matter of preference.  Don&#39;t need to after 6 months.  Can counteract the different pH (vs. a cis vagina) with a vaginal moisturizer and vitamins
</li>
<li>
I asked her quite a bit about PI vs. PPT.  Not surprisingly, she&#39;s not really sold on PPT.  I won&#39;t go into the details here (PM me if desired), but for PI I did ask about the rumor I&#39;ve seen on here that the lining somehow becomes identical to that of a cis vagina, and she said that&#39;s not the case.
</li>
<li>
Three letters are required per WPATH - two mental health and one endo.
</li>
<li>
I wasn&#39;t shown any photos, but didn&#39;t ask.  To be honest, I&#39;ve really only seen one cis vulva up-close in my life, and I never really studied that part of my ex&#39;s body.  They also vary a lot between various women.  I don&#39;t think I can really judge results based on pictures, and I&#39;m more concerned about complications, revisions, depth, and lubrication.  Based on what I&#39;ve read from other people, I trust an experienced surgeon like Dr. McGinn to be able to assemble a good-looking vulva.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I had an in-person consult, so I don&#39;t know how her video consults would go.  When I had a video consult with Dr. Wittenberg she did ask to look at my genitals, which I complied with, though I&#39;m not sure how much information that really gives her.  I do think it was nice/important to have an in-person consult with Dr. McGinn; I had the opportunity to talk to an RN and to her office staff, I got a feel for the area (running along the Delaware River is great way to start the day), and of course conversations are a lot easier in person; I&#39;d definitely recommend at least video consults with surgeons, I can&#39;t imagine just doing a consult over the phone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Changing Surgeons
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I currently have PPT scheduled with Dr. Wittenberg for May.  I haven&#39;t yet changed anything, but I&#39;ve basically decided that I&#39;m going to go with Dr. McGinn instead, probably for May or June.  This isn&#39;t to disparage Dr. Wittenberg or PPT, and there&#39;s lot of people who are very happy with their results from her.  But factors in my decision are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Depth.  Dr. Wittenberg
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/i9ct83/dr_wittenberg_vaginoplasty_consult_warning_long/content.html">says</a>
that her patients tend to get 15-16 cm (6 inches) post-op, but that later this tends to end up at 12-13 cm (5 inches).  Dr. McGinn says that her patients pretty routinely get 6 inches.
</li>
<li>
Lubrication.  PI won&#39;t give you much/any vaginal lubrication, but will have arousal-based lubrication for the labia.  Dr. Wittenberg was careful not to oversell the potential benefits of PPT re: lubrication, though there are definitely several people on Reddit who are convinced it provides a ton of lubrication.  That can be its own problem though - e.g., having to wear panty liners all the time because lubrication is not arousal-based.  I&#39;d rather have a bit of my own lubrication for foreplay etc, and have to use lube if penetration is happening.  This could be a personal preference though, and some people have apparently had very good lubrication results from PPT.
</li>
<li>
Complications.  Dr. Wittenberg had 4 of her first 100 patients get a fistula, 2 of her next 100, and 0 of the rest (130 or so).  Dr. McGinnhas a fistula rate of 0.6%, and low complication rates for other issues as well, and as mentioned above does 150/year of these, and has for over a decade.
</li>
<li>
Recovery.  The recovery from PI is much easier.  Talking to a friend who is a nursing professor, she was also concerned about the 8-9 hours of anesthesia needed for PPT; PI is a 2-3 hour surgery, by contrast.
</li>
<li>
Logistics.  This isn&#39;t as important, but should be mentioned.  For PPT I&#39;d be in San Francisco for a month, for PI I will be in a small town in PA for two weeks.  I also live near the East Coast, so I can drive to Philly in a few hours, while San Francisco is a 5-hour plane ride.  Overall, McGinn is a lot more convenient and less expensive for me.
</li>
<li>
Hair removal.  One downside of switching to PI is that I do have to have hair removed on the scrotum, which I didn&#39;t need for PPT.  Genital electrolysis hurts, and the scrotum and shaft can be the worst IMO.  I don&#39;t have a ton of hair there, though, and in two weeks (2 hours/week on the genitals) we&#39;re already making good progress on the scrotum while keeping the shaft, and base clear (we haven&#39;t done much on the perineum yet, though the area to be cleared there for PI is tiny).
</li>
<li>
Reputation.  I&#39;ve never seen any bad reviews of Dr. McGinn, either
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/wiki/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa/content.md#christine-mcginn">here in the wiki</a>
or elsewhere.  Not to say they don&#39;t exist.  I have seen a
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/jit80j/a_word_of_warning_about_wittenberg/content.html">couple</a>
of
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/iw3wih/girls_whove_had_botched_srs_how_much_did_it/">posts</a>
here recently that have given me pause about Dr. Wittenberg, though most that I&#39;ve read about her have been glowing reviews.  When people talk about Dr. McGinn, the main/only negative they mention is that her bedside manner is less than stellar, which I can deal with if needed.
</li>
<li>
Miscellaneous.  If I&#39;m not satisfied with my PI results, there are several surgeons who do PPT as a revision.  If I get PPT as an initial surgery and I&#39;m not satisfied, I&#39;m basically looking at a colon graft, which I don&#39;t really want to do.
<strong>
Edit:
</strong>
I forgot to mention that long-term outcomes for transfeminine people getting PPT are unknown, since it&#39;s such a new surgery.  Both Dr. Wittenberg and Dr. McGinn emphasized this point.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
Summary
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was originally planning consultations with Dr. Avanessian and Dr. Bluebond-Langner as well.  My BBL consult, which I made in early August, was for August 2021.  I cancelled it after my consultation with Dr. Wittenberg in August; I wasn&#39;t really sure what Dr. BBL could tell me a year later that would make me switch from one PPT surgeon to another (granted, different techniques).  Dr. Avanessian&#39;s office is impossible to work with, so I gave up after a while.  Dr. McGinn I had the mid-October consult scheduled since early August, and kept it as a backup even after scheduling PPT with Dr. Witterberg.
</p>
<p>
I always had Dr. McGinn as my backup surgeon for PI in case I wasn&#39;t satisfied with PPT for any reason.  I think I&#39;ve reached that point for the above reasons.  This isn&#39;t to say this is the right choice for everyone, and to be sure I&#39;ve already had someone ask for my surgery date with Dr. Wittenberg.  I still need to talk to Dr. McGinn&#39;s office about a couple of things, not least the $3500 deposit and how that interacts with insurance.  I&#39;m planning on doing that in the next week or so, but I&#39;m fairly confident that I can get a surgery date with Dr. McGinn in late May or early June, which is what I&#39;m aiming for.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll do my best to answer any questions.  Thanks for reading!

Some info for you re: McGinn
</p>
<p>
Labia minora are not necessarily pink. There&#39;s no magic trick to make them pink. What color is the donor skin? That will be the color of your labia. If you&#39;ve got a circumcision scar, you know that dark ring?, then part of your labia will be that shade
</p>
<p>
You can also end up with labial numbness. 18 months post op and my labia are pretty numb and they said that&#39;s normal. That doesn&#39;t make sense to me because the penile skin is used for labia and it&#39;s not as if it were removed from my body and grafted elsewhere like the scrotum was. Anyway, they say it&#39;s normal. It doesn&#39;t
<em>
feel
</em>
normal to have part of your body completely numb, I&#39;ll tell you that.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, I don&#39;t have any complaints really. The fact that the surgery exists and that she does it so well are both amazing.
</p>
<p>
I guess my only other gripe is that as well established as she is, she should take insurance. Yes that means she will get paid less, but I&#39;m pretty sure the practice has served her quite well over the years financially so not sure why she still doesn&#39;t take insurance. That&#39;s a huge barrier to entry for a lot of people and even though I had the money, I wish I still had the money rather than having to fork over a small fortune.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s great. I don&#39;t know what people complain about as far as bedside manner. She&#39;s a surgeon. If you&#39;ve ever had surgery with anybody else you know you don&#39;t see the surgeon much. You deal mostly with the staff for aftercare and her staff is also top notch.

Understood on the labia minora.  I was circumcised, but that ring, while darker/different that then surrounding skin, is still pretty pink for me.  Cis womens&#39; coloration there does vary, and does apparently darken after pregnancy/childbirth.
</p>
<p>
I would agree that labial numbness is not/should not be normal.  I take it you&#39;ve talked to other doctors about that?  You&#39;re correct that the only graft is the scrotum for the back of the vaginal cavity, everything else is a flap, so persistent numbness should not occur.
</p>
<p>
For insurance, for myself at least, it sounds like I can get her in-network, though really for me, the cost would be about the same for out-of-network - my out-of-pocket max is similar for both, and I do have recurring expenses in both buckets.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for sharing!

Hello!! I had surgery with McGinn in February. I think she’s great and I’m overall happy with my experience and results.

She works as a team with her physicians assistant Krystal. I think they compliment each other well. Most of the follow-up has been the PA.
</p>
<p>
I stayed in an Airbnb and that worked out well for me.
</p>
<p>
Recovery went really smoothly. I was working part time at home in less than 2 weeks. In the office part time before 3. By the time I was cleared to run at 6 weeks, I could already walk 5 miles at a time.

Sex has been enjoyable, and I’ve never been clocked by my vagina.

Thanks - that helps a lot!  I&#39;m on a biweekly injection cycle, and would love to have the last injection two weeks before surgery!  I&#39;ll have to ask Dr. McGinn or Krystal about that.
</p>
<p>
I started hair removal in early August, and have been doing 2 hours/week on my genitals, minus three weeks while out of town in September.  It&#39;s in pretty good shape and I hope that the scrotum will be fully cleared by the end of November.  It sounds like that, plus continued clearing after, will be sufficient.
</p>
<p>
I ran right behind the Gaia House, on the Delaware Towpath, the morning I was there, and agree, it&#39;s a lovely area.  I didn&#39;t get to explore the town because my appointment was moved to 10:30am instead of 12:45.  I&#39;m looking forward to it though.

I second every single bullet point above. I may have left New Hope before your arrived.
</p>
<p>
I was told not to stop hormones (patches) and that helped a lot.
</p>
<p>
Hair removal during the first COVID-19 shutdown was indeed a challenge. I had to drive 5 hours one way to get it done.

Hi, I’d recommend against McGinn, my wife had surgery with her and it was a very traumatic experience for both of us
</p>
<ul>
<li>
she puts a stitch from one side of your thigh to the other to “keep your legs closed”, she failed to inform my wife or me about this and it caused her a bunch of pain
</li>
<li>
my wife’s pain was at an 11 most of the hospital stay and our requests for help were met with “well its a painful surgery”
</li>
<li>
she was only kept in 3 nights and was discharged regardless of her terribly controlled pain
</li>
<li>
she screamed allllll the way to the airbnb and a lot of the next few days were her screaming and crying
</li>
<li>
only had 3.5inches depth, at no point did McGinn really offer an alternative or mention the material was inadequate, even though now i know she very obviously did not have enough after years of HRT
</li>
<li>
McGinn is an ex navy doctor and holy crap is that made clear by her bedside manner
</li>
<li>
the catheter was not attached anywhere properly and as a result spent the entire hospital stay slumped over on her labia, the labia started to dir on the final hospital day in the exact pattern that the catheter was laying on it as it was disrupting the fragile blood supply nobody seemed to notice or care besides me and i told myself they knew better than me so i ignored it too (ouch) My wife has PTSD we think amplified her pain a bit but it was still a fucking awful experience, and if i could do it again I’d make sure to get her a longer stay in the hospital no matter the cost or objections from the surgeon/nurses.  OHSU the hospital near me, keeps people 7 nights after vaginoplasty which seems vastly more reasonable. I think McGinn only did 3 as a cost cutting measure as back then no insurance really covered it. If she’s still only doing 3 nights i have to assume its just the whole army doctor attitude of “suck it up pal, its only a little discomfort”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Anyway i doubt you’ll have as bad an experience but that was ours. Watch for that catheter!!
</p>
<p>
I just had vulvaplasty with Dr Geolani Dy at OHSU and the experience has been a dream. They were very very helpful with pain levels and the catheter was properly taped up! Also no mystery stitch betwen my legs that I wasn’t informed about! I was able to stay an extra day in the hospital no problem, because of my anxiety (caused by my previous experience) and slightly high pain. She’s been wonderful the entire time, its been shocking compared to McGinn and really showed me that surgery recovery doesn’t have to be a nightmare
</p>
<p>
———  One last thing, the pre-op and post-op “handbook” from McGinn was very sparse and disorganized (what felt like random bits of paper) and felt like it was missing a lot. The one from Dr Dy is a several dozen page binder that is exceptionally well put together and contains almost everything I’d want to mnow, seriously its the best piece of information ive ever been give pre-surgery. Small detail and I understand Dr McGinn does not have nearly the level of resources that a large hospital does but still it was super nice to get that binder compared what McGinn gives.
</p>
<p>
Seriously like her stuff had what look like napskin sketches of the procedure from McGinn, binder had extremely professionally drawn diagrams

Wow, understood!  Talking to Dr. Wittenberg, even for PPT, which is a much more invasive surgery, she also keeps patients only three days.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s standard for other surgeries.  I will definitely watch the catheter placement!
</p>
<p>
For the depth, from various others I&#39;ve talked to it sounds like your wife is an outlier.  Outliers do happen, and I&#39;m sorry that happened to her.  I think that&#39;s part of my reason for PI in general though - I might consider peritoneal methods as a second surgery then.  I realize that not everyone is up for having major surgery a second time though.

She may have been an outlier yeah but McGinn never really mentioned it when it should have been obvious. Although the only other option at the time (2014) was colon graft which I understand her reluctance to suggest. I edited a bit more info in btw if you wanna re-read the bottom.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with everything, I’m sure you’ll do ok. My wife is perfectly happy with her result, but take that with a grain of salt as her anxiety means shes never really even looked at it post surgery, and she definitively has never seen a cis vagina lol. Im much pickier and think her result is ok cosmetically but not 100%. Given another chance we both agree she’d be better with a zero depth vulvaplasty especially as she’s asexual!

I held off on thinking about GCS for my first year on HRT because I wasn&#39;t sure if I was Ace or not.  I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not, though at the same time my libido has been set to &#34;off&#34; for at least the last month again.  But I&#39;d rather have the option of penetration, so I&#39;m not going for zero depth.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad things worked out for her with the revision at OHSU!  I was just there in September - not at the hospital itself, but in Portland - and one of my friends is there in an unrelated capacity (child psychology).  I think I&#39;ve learned through transition that I need to advocate for myself, and will be sure to do so through the surgical process.

I had surgery, no revision for her! Vulvaplasty is just what they call zero depth, and i like it better. 12 days into recovery.

The thing that sucks is you need to be able to strongly self advocate while being in your most vulnerable least able to advocate state. A partner helps a lot, and hospitals have patient advocates you can contact

My impression was that McGinn just outright refused to bill insurance, they&#39;d only give you the paperwork to get reimbursed yourself. Has that changed? Has anyone been able to get a GAP exception through Blue Cross?

Yikes. That sounds kind of terrible, having to produce that amount of cash on hand even though your insurance is paying. Imagine having to get a loan and pay interest on it just because of a month long gap.

Based on the full cost or the &#34;covered amount?&#34; I&#39;ve seen people say BC decided the amount they&#39;d cover would be only ~$3000 (not a typo), but they won&#39;t tell you the number until after the surgery...

They covered 100% of  they thought the surgery &#34;should cost&#34;, which for some reason was about $1K less than Dr. McGinn&#39;s fee of (then) $14,750.   I thought this was bizarre since Aetna declared Dr. McGinn to be in-network because of a &#34;network deficiency&#34; in comparable services. Well if there was no surgeon in their network to compare her fees against, how did they decide it should have been $1K less?  Anyway, in my case they did cover 100% of OR fees, hospital charges, and the anesthesiologist.

Wait, your consult is 4.5 months out?  I was able to get mine in about 2.5 months after I asked for it in early August.  Like 90% of what she&#39;ll discuss is included above, so you can figure out before then if there&#39;s any other questions you have.  Good luck!

We just had PI with Dr. McGinn (3 weeks ago Tuesday) and I have to say, we were treated beautifully, recovery has been smooth, and the results already look really good. We enjoyed her bedside manner also.  If you’d like to hear our audio journal, it’s at

I really agree with your reasons for PI over PPT.  People are rushing to a technique that isn&#39;t more like a cis vagina.

Curious, if Wittenberg were logistically easier, would you just have had PI with her?

No.  So many people really rave about Dr. McGinn, so I never really considered a different PI surgeon.  Even PI with Dr. Wittenberg is like 6-7 hours, which is still fairly long.  I think I vaguely considered Dr. Bowers or Dr. Meltzer, but didn&#39;t really pursue them further, since Dr. McGinn is already in my backyard essentially.
</p>
<p>
I hope you&#39;re doing a bit better than the last time we talked, or that you posted.  When is your 3-month?

? My PI with her was 4 hours.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s Wednesday.  I&#39;ll probably have an update after that goes over the things I&#39;m unhappy with.  I think I will be ok after a revision but that still delays my life by a whole year, and probably cancels some activities permanently and I&#39;ll never have another chance.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve somewhat dealt with that mentally.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really curious if she did the majority of the surgery, or let someone else.  I wish I knew, but it&#39;s not something I feel comfortable asking.  If she&#39;s not the one there for my post op appointment I&#39;ll be more than upset.

Huh.  At my consult, Dr. Wittenberg said that PI was 6-7 hours for her.  Maybe she was talking about worst-case scenarios.
</p>
<p>
Understood about your status, I&#39;d be interested in hearing about the follow-up and I&#39;m sure others would too.  I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had such a tough time with this; thanks for sharing so much of your experiences, even though I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been hard for you to relive and examine those experiences with others.

I really hope it all works out.  I really do like Wittenberg.  And I know I need a revision, but I hope my posts will show how even if it&#39;s terrible, eventually it gets better.

We usually only see perfect results.  I&#39;m done showing a less than average one.

So you just had surgery, and you are already convinced you need a revision?  Can you explain why?  A few days after my surgery with Dr. McGinn, I had a Frankenpussy, and some tissue necrosis as well.  It healed up very well in time.
</p>
<p>
If there are complications or least than desirable results, please know that Dr. McGinn very much stands by her work and will do revisions she thinks are medically justified.

I&#39;m at 3 months, there are parts that are healing incorrectly, and parts that are done and screwed up.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been reviewed by my gyno, another surgeon, and my electrolysis esthetician.  They&#39;ve all seen hundreds of vaginas.  They are all disappointed with my results.
</p>
<p>
Also, I&#39;m sick of people second guessing me.  Comments like the one you made are on par with gas lighting and very unwelcomed.

And I didn&#39;t mean to come down hard on you, so if I did, I&#39;m sorry.  But it happens often here so I tend to go to that level instantly.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a few days post op from v-line and ba.  Almost three months post op from srs with Wittenberg

I have never heard of anyone working with McGinn for surgeries.  You shouldn&#39;t feel uncomfortable asking (other than the fact that some people - me, for instance - can find her very intimidating at first).
</p>
<p>
Unless something has changed, she will definitely be there for your first post-op appointment.  She is the one that sticks that first dilator in you and shows you how to dilate.

Thank you so so much for this info. I have a consult coming up with Avanessian and Mcginn a few weeks after. I was leaning towards PPT with Avanessian but because of this post and someone I talked to yday I&#39;m strongly reconsidering McGinn for PI 2 stage.
</p>
<p>
In other news...I just learned today BlueBond-Langner is BBL for short. That&#39;s some cool accidental marketing, Dr. BBL. I&#39;m currently recovering from a BBL so I got confused for a second why OP started mentioning their BBL consult near the end.

Sorry about that!  Some people also refer to her as RBL, using her first initial.

On hair removal, you mention she says you need a bit above the penis.  In her paperwork the line goes directly across the top and the line above the penis has been smugged out.  Emailing the office they say the photo is correct and it used to be above, but after your notes honestly, I am not sure...

Her office sent photos to me.  On the top it&#39;s a horizontal line around a half-inch above the penis.  Everything below that needs to be removed.  Not including the scrotum and the shaft, the rest of the area is basically an isosceles triangle, with that horizontal line as the top.  If you PM me your email I can send it to you, or you can ask Lori at Dr. McGinn&#39;s office.

Having seen the result, it totally makes sense, as her hair is growing in, it’s in exactly the right places and not missing anywhere it looks like it should be.  –Gem

Dr. McGinn is a good choice. I had my surgery in June. Would do it again if I could.
</p>
<p>
I got a good lubrication even when not aroused. I do need to douch once in a while to wash out lubricant from dilation.

Hi! I can take a look. I can&#39;t see it either, but I can feel it and I believe it&#39;s a good thing since it&#39;s not going to rub my undies and lose sensitivity. Also, the clitoris size may vary depending on how much T you hsve.

I think surgeons that do PPT as a revision are just extending the depth using peritoneal tissue.  Based on what Jane at PryaMED said, once the inverted penile tissue is in place, it&#39;s difficult or impossible to remove.  So you won&#39;t get the same type of skin down the whole vaginal canal with a revision, which means less lubrication and a different look and feel towards the vaginal entrance.
</p>
<p>
Regarding overlubrication, PPT skin is more likely to convert to skin that is indistinguishable from cis-female vaginal mucosa.  This skin allows clear fluid called transudate to seep through which provides lubrication.  I&#39;ve read conflicting things about whether more transudate seeps through during arousal for trans patients, but it does in cis female anatomy.  Read more about transudate
<a href="https://covenantsextherapy.com/vaginal-lubrication-vs-discharge/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve done dozens of hours of research and reports of over-lubrication due to PPT are rare.  PPT has been used for cis-females born without vaginal canals for 123 years, so there is quite a body of evidence to look at.  To think that results would be significantly different for trans patients seems unlikely to me, but doctors still have to say there&#39;s no long term results because we aren&#39;t identical.

I had a consult with McGinn as well and can second almost everything in the comments.
</p>
<p>
Positive: I came away believing she was completely knowledgeable and if I chose SRS she would have been the best option for me on the East Coast US.
</p>
<p>
Negative: He bed side manner was terrible even in the consultation. Given — I don’t really give a crap about her personality but holy moly. I’m hiring her to do a deed, I only care about my long term health and the results...  but I didn’t expect to feel like I was on trial and for her to disrespect my wife was silly IMO. I’ll share details in private if someone is curious.
</p>
<p>
Other notes: She takes no insurance so payment up front is needed. Her rate is less than many other surgeons rate that is reimbursed by insurance so anyone who this this is to the advantage of her pocket book is silly. She does this too keep prices low. Hospital fees are all covered by insurance so you are only paying surgical fees up front. The invoice you then give to your insurance company and they reimburse you directly. Her staff works with your insurance company to make sure they get the info they need. Problem is you need the cash up front...

I have insurance, and Dr. Wittenberg was out of network.  I almost definitely would have hit the out-of-pocket maximum, so the actual cost was irrelevant after a while.    There was no deposit required when I scheduled with her.

Dr. McGinn has a $3500 deposit and charges $18000 total, which she will provide paperwork for me to have much of that reimbursed by insurance afterwards.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how much other surgeons charge, sorry.  I did respond to your other comment about Dr. Wittenberg on my other post.  Those are the only two surgeons I had consultations with.
