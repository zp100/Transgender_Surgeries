i&#39;ve seen this offered by DB and keojampa as well as heard mention of it being a thing in korea. but i&#39;ve never seen any before and after images. I don&#39;t have a gummy smile but I do have quite a long and narrow face, which is probably the SINGLE thing that prevents me from passing more than anything else. I&#39;ve posted pics before if you&#39;re curious; don&#39;t feel like posting more.
</p>
<p>
Short of actually approaching a surgeon for a consultation, I&#39;d really love to get any info I can about this procedure - how much it can shave off, how much of a difference it makes, and if it&#39;s even possible without the whole gummy smile thing. deschamps&#39; website seems to indicate that it&#39;s a simple and routine procedure - but it would, cause he&#39;s trying to sell it lol. it mentions gummy smile as a possible symptom of &#34;long face syndrome&#34; but doesn&#39;t say that you need to have that for the surgery to be possible which i suppose is a good sign?
</p>
<p>
Thanks

I had a LeFort 1 with DB. I had a slight to moderate gummy smile but not a lot of vertical maxillary excess. A long mid face was my problem as well. I was getting obsessed with it early last year, looking at all the LeFort procedures, box osteotomies, etc.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m putting a warning here for you, because if I knew what I was in for ahead of time, I may not have gone through with it. And I&#39;m someone who has been called a masochist on many occasions. Having said that, am I glad I had it done? Yes. Am I happy with the results? Yes. Read on if you want to know what to expect. :)
</p>
<p>
If you have to pay out of pocket, it&#39;s the most expensive procedure out of any procedure I&#39;ve had done. You&#39;ll also need surgical braces placed a month or two ahead of time, which is an additional cost.
</p>
<p>
DB isn&#39;t going to try and sell it during the consultation. He has enough backlog of patients that he&#39;ll recommend what he thinks will be best and then ask about what you personally like or don&#39;t like about your face. I had FFS with both Dr. K and DB and neither mentioned the LeFort. I brought it up during my consult with DB and he said I didn&#39;t need it so much to correct vertical maxillary excess but it would correct my slight underbite and jaw rotation. I&#39;ll mention more about this later.
</p>
<p>
On to the details...
</p>
<p>
I initially asked if I could get 1cm+ reduction in my midface, not knowing the technical details of the surgery and only reading about it online. He paused for a bit and said that he could move the upper jaw up an excessive amount, even more than 1cm, but there&#39;s drawbacks to it. Apparently, when you move the upper jaw up too much it causes the skin in the midface to compress with folding and wrinkling and there really isn&#39;t a good way to correct this. In my case he said 5-6mm would be preferred.
</p>
<p>
Facelifts can correct loose skin along the jawline, browlifts can address laxity in the forehead, but I don&#39;t think anyone would want to make an incision through the midface to remove skin there for obvious aesthetic reasons. I did read about the &#34;vertical face lift&#34; pioneered by Andrew Jacono but I&#39;m not sold on it yet.
</p>
<p>
So, the surgery plan was for a 5-6mm midface reduction with the LeFort and a 5 mm lip lift bringing my philtrum from 20mm to 15mm. A genioplasty was also most likely needed for me, since the lower jaw is a hinge, and closing the mouth with an upper jaw positioned higher would result in the lower teeth projecting more forward when closing my mouth. Since they need to intubate through the nose when performing a LeFort, you can&#39;t combine that with a rhinoplasty. Nothing really changed from the consult to the day before surgery visit, with regard to the Lefort or lip lift.
</p>
<p>
The surgical braces are not fun imo. They&#39;re more heavy duty and bulky compared to regular braces. And there are a bunch of hooks that are affixed to the wires that will be used in conjunction with elastic bands to hold your jaw together after surgery. DB uses elastic bands for double jaw surgery, rather than wiring the mouth shut, which is a positive. I&#39;ve read about people who disregarded the elastic bands and had to have a second surgery because their jaw healed incorrectly. If you have any porcelain in your mouth, like veneers or crowns, the braces will have a hard time adhering to the teeth. Some will fall off and you&#39;ll have to go back and fix them. They also use an acidic bonding material for porcelain, meaning you might need to get the veneers replaced after the braces come off. My braces were on for about 4 months after surgery, which is an exception. My orthodontist said that DB did a phenomenal job and my Ortho expected the braces to be on much longer.
</p>
<p>
After surgery you will be swollen beyond belief, as expected, but since everything in the jaw is numb for a few months, most of the pain will be an intense throbbing sensation. Use your prescription pain medication at night so you can sleep. The few days after surgery were a bit scary because, with both the upper and lower jaw swollen, I had a very narrow airway in my mouth to breathe through. I highly recommend having someone stay with you during recovery because of this.
</p>
<p>
It will be difficult to brush your teeth and 100% impossible to floss for a while with the combination of swelling, surgical braces and elastic bands. I had these laugh/cry moments about how rediculous it was to try and clean my teeth and thoughts of all my teeth rotting.  You won&#39;t know about about any tooth pain until many months later when you get feeling back. I have an anecdote about that, but I&#39;ll spare you those details because it was just bad luck. I will just say, limit your sugar intake or anything else that may negatively affect your teeth!
</p>
<p>
Be prepared in your hotel room before surgery. Make sure you have a refrigerator. You will be on a liquid diet for two weeks. An electric hot pot is good for heating up soup and making tea. I found one at a grocery store a couple days before surgery. Stock up on any non sugary liquids you can find.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s my take on the results after the swelling had gone down. The lip lift was great, my teeth align perfectly, no gummy smile. (lip filler helps with this too imo) Upper lip forward projection is better and my front teeth don&#39;t clash together from an underbite. The mid face length reduction is mild, but noticeable. I don&#39;t know if that has more to do with the LeFort or lip lift. My nasal folds are a bit more noticeable, which may be due to the LeFort and/or lip lift. I&#39;m hoping fillers will address that. I&#39;m probably going back for a revision of a previous rhinoplasty. The jaw rotation of the LeFort seems to have exacerbated my deviated septum. This is a common side effect of the Lefort if you look it up and there&#39;s many rhinoplasty case studies detailing it.
</p>
<p>
For post op measurements, DB measured the Lefort to be 7mm, 2mm more than anticipated, and the lip lift to be 5mm.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re on a limited budget, fat transfers will do more to feminize your face at 1/10th the price, even for someone with a long mid face. I would recommend getting fat grafts during a separate procedure if you go ahead with the LeFort. I lost 10lbs from the liquid diet and you need to &#39;feed&#39; the fat transfers post op so they &#39;stick&#39; and become permanent.
</p>
<p>
If you want to see pictures DM me. I wouldn&#39;t call myself aesthetically pretty at all but I typically pass now, which is saying something for someone who had the skull dimensions of someone like Jeff Daniels to start off with a few years ago. I will probably be going back for a face lift, since I had so much upper and lower jaw removed, and revision rhino.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with whatever you decide!

I read somewhere that it is not a good idea to do this when not having a gummy smile. This would end with burrying the upper teeth under the lip, which seems logical to me to have a negative effect on the appearance. So having a gummy smile would be required basically, at least it should be considered. I am as well interested in every option to balance the mid third proportions of a face, but I too don&#39;t have a gummy smile myself.

A lip lift would counteract this I believe as it is a shortening of the space between the nose and the philtrum. If you do a lip lift it can in fact cause a gummy smile ( I have a slightly gummy smile so, for instance, deschamps-braly found that a lip lift was contraindicated for me )
</p>
<p>
If you could do enough of a lip lift to counterbalance how much maxillary width you wish to remove is obviously going to be surgeon specific.

No, this incorrect.
</p>
<p>
I also had a consult for a Lefort with a different doctor. If you don&#39;t start with a gummy smile a Lefort 1 impaction will bury your teeth in your mouth. Imagine smiling without any of your teeth showing. A lip lift is needed so that the teeth are visible again. Plus women generally show more teeth when their mouths are in a neutral position compared to men.

Very late to the party, but for posterity; it&#39;s complicated.
</p>
<p>
A lip lift takes skin only from the outside of the lip, so the bottom edge of the lip is only raised by about 1/2 of the amount. That is, a 5mm lip lift raises the bottom edge of the lip by 2-3mm.
</p>
<p>
In other words, getting a 5mm Maxillary Intrusion, you would need an 8-10mm lip lift to get the lip back up to where it was (but the elevation isn&#39;t uniform, and changes the shape of the lip. 8-10mm is insane and not an option for most people even ignoring tooths show).
</p>
<p>
If you are not a candidate for a lip lift due to excessive tooth show, then the lip can come back up less, so this is okay. You either get a significant intrusion and a sane lip lift, or a smaller intrusion is still significant because it lets you have a lip lift in the first place.
</p>
<p>
But if you are a candidate for a lip lift, then your lip already rests lower, so it has to come up more after the intrusion. Therefore a significant intrusion may need a HUGE lip lift to show enough of the teeth, while a smaller intrusion won&#39;t add much when you can have a lip lift already.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s all case by case, and this isn&#39;t definitive, but in general this is something that&#39;s usually only worth thinking about if (1) you&#39;re having DJS anyway, or (2) you want a lip lift but can&#39;t have one because of a gummy smile.

Answering both replies at once.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t always need a lip lift, but it depends on how much tooth show you have now, combined with how much the maxilla will be moved by. It&#39;s something you need to discuss in the consult, because it depends on why you&#39;re having the surgery and what your goals are.
</p>
<p>
If you already have a scar, then potentially a lip lift could help with that by debulking/excising some of the scar tissue, or it could make it worse by creating more scar tissue on top. It depends on your scarring, and how your body scars, not to mention that scarring can be quite unpredictable. Again, that&#39;s something you&#39;d need to discuss with your surgeon.
