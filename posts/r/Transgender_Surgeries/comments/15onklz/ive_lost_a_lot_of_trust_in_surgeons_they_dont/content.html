Thank you for sharing so others can see evidence of that surgeon&#39;s work.

I&#39;m not in anywhere near the same boat, but I agree.
</p>
<p>
I traveled all the way to San Rafael, CA for surgery from Florida, after spending 2 years on his wait-list, spent thousands in air travel, Airbnb, etc to be talked out of it on my pre-op appointment the day before because the doctor had a &#34;change in philosophy&#34; regarding a potential complication.
</p>
<p>
He should have read my chart before having me travel across the country. He said I should go to a larger institution. Why wasn&#39;t this brought up beforehand??
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I&#39;m so frustrated at doctors because like you said, they don&#39;t listen.

I’ve had No facial surgery and I’ve experienced this before despite being on HRT for almost 5 years  , bottom line I don’t and never will have True Passibility or acceptance socially if I’m honest with myself , I’m legit Trans female but the world is not fare , I don’t think he’s Transphobic and it’s how he makes his money but ? - Dr. theerapong it appears he’s used to having 130 maybe 150 lb Trans gals ( not 240 lb football player sized like myself ) he deals with - being from North America I’m not small and facially look man like so it’ll always be against me no matter what but I am legit true born Trans female mind wise  - it’s what it is and I get it not really fitting in society if I’m honest with myself ?  , I don’t have the passing grade needed - my right vocal cord was damaged ( paralyzed )  by Kamol with an intubation tube 2 nd time going there trusting that guy 2 nd time there back in 2019 having BA - so I don’t have the facial looks and basically a fk’d voice that can’t be fixed now to come close to sounding female let alone facial looks - treatment/acceptance becomes almost impossible for me at any hospital around the world and is very different for me compared to many who transition  , most younger Transwomen don’t have this issue and not deal with the crap I’ve put up with the last 4 plus years - I don’t pass bottom line !

Indeed, Thailand can be a mess unless you go to Suporn Clinic. Hopefully, Dr. Kunaporn will fix the aesthetics.

Revisions can only go so far if the surgeon had nothing to work with because a prior surgeon removed a lot of external tissue then thats expected. Its not the surgeons who did the revision fault.
</p>
<p>
Theerapong uses homologus tissues to reposition them and create the vulva.
</p>
<p>
Labia minora from penile skin and labia majora from scrotal if most of these structures were gone due to previous surgery then the surgeon during the revision is not gonna magically create lost tissues.
