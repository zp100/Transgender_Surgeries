<p>
So I&#39;m 33 days post op of a bilateral orchiectomy with a midline incision on my scrotum. During the early stages of my recovery I had an abnormal amount of swelling in the inguinal region on my right side. I saw the surgeon 1 week after and she said that it wasn&#39;t common, but within the bounds of normalcy. Then at 3 weeks after my surgery at the normally scheduled post-op appointment everything was looking better in terms of bruising and swelling, so she was happy with the way things were healing. Now a week or so after that I&#39;m starting to really worry.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been feeling around down there a lot more since the pain has started to subside and checking to see what parts of my hematoma might still be there, but I&#39;ve felt something that&#39;s really troubling. I can feel a dense cordlike structure extending from my incision all of the way up into my inguinal canal that goes almost past my pubic area, and touching it too much feels like getting kicked in the balls. I&#39;ve also noticed that if I pull my scrotum to the left the incision gets sucked in like it&#39;s connected to something internal, but if I pull it to the right, (the side with the cord thing) it just moves all together.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m almost certain this is my spermatic cord that has been fused to my incision somehow and I&#39;m really worried that I might have to go in and get it cut apart/cut shorter. Which would mean more scarring and more healing time.
</p>
<p>
Has this happened to anyone else before? Did the cord end up releasing and retracting on its own? I&#39;m going to schedule an appointment with my surgeon as soon as the office opens tomorrow morning, but it will probably still be a week or so before I see them and find out what&#39;s going on.
</p>
<p>
I also want to add that this surgery is common for her. She&#39;s young, LGBT+ herself, and we live in a very liberal area. She&#39;s done this for many trans women before and the ones I&#39;ve spoken with said everything went great. Also, I specifically brought up post op cord length and she said she would (and always does) cut them as short as she can.

I experienced ‚Äútethering‚Äù (actual medical term) on both cords after my orchie due to the inexperienced surgical staff with regard to treating Transgender patients. In my case, the cords were not sectioned as high as possible so they would retreat back up into the inguinal canals during the healing process. The right cord became swollen much like a small testicle about the size of my thumbnail and adhered itself in the upper scrotal area, causing it to be constantly under pressure from the upper right thigh. I couldn‚Äôt push the ends back up in the canals and couldn‚Äôt properly tuck and was in constant agony.
</p>
<p>
I found Dr. Karen E. Boyle of Chesapeake Urology (now recently retired) who performed a resection on the right cord. Turns out by the time she did the surgery, the left cord had become untethered and retreated up into the canal to the point she could not locate it during the operation. Dr. Boyle removed almost two inches of excess cord from the right side. I have not had any problems since.
</p>
<p>
In addition, she led me to Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langnor at NYU-Langone, (they were once a team performing GRS in Baltimore). During my GRS consult with Dr. RBb-L last month, she told me that Dr. Boyle had me in good shape and the previous surgeries would have no bearing on my upcoming GRS.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps. AMA‚ù£Ô∏èü§ós

Dr. Karen E. Boyle is one of my Earthbound Angels. I will never, forget how she helped me. I received a letter from her (apparently sent to all her patients) the first week of this past June saying that due to the affects of COVID she was retiring June 30. I simply cannot say enough good about her‚ù£Ô∏èüíï

Thank you for sharing. That makes me feel a little bit better knowing that it&#39;s possible to for this resolve on its own. I am really confused by how long it seems to be, although it does feel very stretched, even just standing there my scrotum is pulled in a tiny bit where the incision was.
</p>
<p>
When you went for the resection was is under full anesthesia again? Or just local? Also, good to hear it&#39;s not going to affect GRS. I do plan on that in the future.

Mine was under general anesthesia. Here is the thing, the pain I described in my experience is known as ganglia. I could feel like something was pulling on the cords when I moved and the pain traveled all the way up the cords. Just before the resection surgery, the left cord apparently became untethered and and the pain on that side reduced significantly.
</p>
<p>
For a reference of time, I had issues/suffered for nine months almost to the day between the orchie and resection surgeries. Partly because I refused to let the bastards who did the original surgery ever touch me again, (they didn‚Äôt believe I was in pain and told me over several appointments that it would go away on its own) and partly because it took me time to find Dr. Boyle and arrange for the resection.

<p>
This is your path forward. Nothing else you
<em>
can
</em>
do (except worry which isn&#39;t going to help).
</p>
<p>
While it&#39;s not
<em>
impossible
</em>
that your spermatic cord has &#34;fused&#34; to the incision point, it&#39;s not likely. OTOH, there are other kinds of complications that bear investigation.
</p>
<p>
If you
<em>
do
</em>
have to go back in for a revision, don&#39;t put it off. It&#39;s not the end of the world. I had &#34;issues&#34; and minimized them for six months. It was six months of unneeded mess and bother.

Hematoma, incision re-opening, infection, necrotic tissue. Nothing serious (usually).

I had the same feeling/issue. Now 6 months later that feeling is gone.

I know this is 4 years old, But I&#39;m dealing with a situation that&#39;s kind of similar where I&#39;m fairly certain either its a hematoma or the cords feel fused/healed to the suture.
</p>
<p>
did this ever resolve for you? or did you just leave it be with grs in mind?

Honestly, it‚Äôs gotten a lot better. But I‚Äôm still not sure what the problem was in the first place. I still haven‚Äôt had bottom surgery, so nothing has been surgically changed, and I still feel a slight tug that feels off when I pull down on my scrotum, but for the most part I don‚Äôt think about it anymore. I can‚Äôt feel anything that feels off (like inspecting with my fingers) and it never bothers me as long as I‚Äôm not tugging down on it and even then it‚Äôs not much.
</p>
<p>
How recently did you have surgery?

Yeah I think there‚Äôs just some scar tissue that shows up or something, but it does go away with time.
</p>
<p>
If the pain is low enough I think gently massaging the area can help. Breaks up scar tissue.

She looked at it, didn‚Äôt really know what it was, maybe just scar tissue she said. It‚Äôs still like that. But it doesn‚Äôt really hurt. Feels weird if you pull on the scrotum though.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm getting SRS at some point so I assume that will solve it then. I might ask someone else in the meantime though.
