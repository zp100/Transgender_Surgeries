Ah, memories
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s normal for two weeks.  You&#39;ll heal in 3-6 months more than likely.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not granulation, it&#39;s wound separation from the swelling.  Just follow your care instructions, you&#39;ll be fine.
</p>
<p>
Keep the area clean and dry.  How did your dr say to clean yourself?
</p>
<p>
Stay on whatever antiinflammatories you&#39;re allowed, keep icing the area but never on open skin.
</p>
<p>
Rest.  Do not do too much

How are you keeping the water and instruments sterile?  What do you use to dry with?
</p>
<p>
Why do you wear pads and underwear?
</p>
<p>
What do you need to move around for? Do you have any assistance?

The dilator and the douch I clean it as what I was told with water and soap , I dry the area with toilet paper but trying to avoid the wounds and more around it ,  I have liquid discharge from the wounds that why I wear the lady pants (lady diapers) but also try to be naked as much as possible
</p>
<p>
Moving around now basically to go to the wc or getting ready for dilation and cleaning bit after myself or cook ( did it once )
</p>
<p>
I have kinda of assistant to cook for me and help me when I feel dizzy the rest I do it myself
</p>
<p>
I have not tried to ice the area yet .
</p>
<p>
Any suggestions or advices ? :)

I only wear underwear or bottom clothing if I have to leave the house.  I wear a robe when I leave my room.  The more clothing that touches the wound, the more pain I would feel and I believe the healing to slow.
</p>
<p>
Discharge is normal, I had old towels and sheets under me.
</p>
<p>
I bought gauze to dry the area with.  Toilet paper can work but I would keep a separate roll in a cupboard or away from the toilet.
</p>
<p>
My doctor had me use a spray bottle to administer a solution of a tbsp of hydrogen peroxide, to one cup of water.  You could ask your doctor for their thoughts on this.
</p>
<p>
You look good for not icing.  Have you noticed the swelling going down or staying the same?  Bc maybe ice isn&#39;t going to improve anything at this point.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll need to walk around some.  Like 5-10 minutes, 3x a day.  I tried to do mine after already getting up to use the bathroom or something.  It was difficult, I was tired too.

6 weeks is close.  I&#39;m at 4 and I just can&#39;t lift things that are heavy or on the ground.  Energy is back enough to care for myself

It doesnâ€™t look right to me.  Some one on another sub was talking about granulation.  I asked what it looked like and was told redness and possible bleeding...... their doctor prescribed silver nitrate.  Personally I havenâ€™t got a clue, but suggest you speak to your doctor.  Good luck. Xx

It&#39;s not granulation, that doesn&#39;t happen right away.  It&#39;s dehiscence

</p>
<p>

I like threads like this where people are so helpful.  Iâ€™ve never used ice and no pain killers but I do have swelling, obviously.  When I douche or shower I use a hair dryer. Otherwise I use toilet tissue.  When I pee it goes down and some trickles backwards.  Reading this thread I wonder if I should start using ice and the pain killer ibrufen to reduce swelling or just let things take their natural course.  Iâ€™m 28;days post surgery. Xx
