Don&#39;t use the Asian cosmetic clinic, I did, promise a sigmoid 3 when I woke and the surgeon came the next day I asked about depth and dilation. He said it&#39;s just cosmetic no depth. He then walked out no explination I had pressure sores only one follow up to take stitches out. Not a happy customer. Just saying

What‚Äôs the surgeons name, and why did you pick them?
</p>
<p>
When did you have surgery?
</p>
<p>
Was there any explanation as to what happened?
</p>
<p>
Have they offered anything to fix it?
</p>
<p>
Have you filed any official complaints or taken legal action?
</p>

Dr Tanongsak Panyawirunroj, I had the operation of last October 2019. I complained but nothing was done, I looked at feed back over about 2 years but due to my age, 65 and previous heart attack this was the only option. When I arrived even though I had provided health reports including a cardiology report from my consultant, 2 psychiatric reports, Gp referral, full blood report, I had to have two days of checks including chest xray, and a full cardiology exam, all came back clear and the cardiology report suggested my heart was in a better condition than a person 15 years younger than I am. Regarding legal action no I haven&#39;t, ass the money would be better spent on a revision surgery.

I‚Äôm confused... when‚Äôd they tell you it was the only option? If they told you prior to surgery, then the only basis for a complaint is if there was no reasonable way to cancel the surgery. If they told you after, then when? What‚Äôd the exchange look like? You make it sound like they just changed the procedure mid-surgery and walked away, which I mean... benefit of the doubt and all, but you gotta walk us through it. What happened?

The ‚Äòonly option‚Äô could be referring to the choice of doctor rather than the type of surgery. It‚Äôs not overly clear.

I find this hard to believe
</p>
<p>
You asked no questions before hand? The doc the casually strolls in and tells you ‚Äúzero depth‚Äù and walks away? This sounds sketchy

<p>
due to my age and heart this was my only option

<p>
Okay so why are you complaining?

I&#39;m skeptical. OP&#39;s account is only 21 hours old, and they&#39;ve made an identical post in a couple subs with little or no interaction or follow-ups.

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt believe that this happened, it‚Äôs just that the story seems like it has more holes in it than a block of Swiss cheese and the entire post is useless without backstory.

It reads more like a Yelp review. I can kind of believe they&#39;re new to Reddit but yeah, holy.

There‚Äôs a comment higher up that says this person in well known in the community on other websites, so they probably created a reddit account solely to spread the warning about this surgeon.

I care about the post on the thread that‚Äôs it. Siding with the abusive user I responded to is truly a supremely crappy move. It‚Äôs stuff like this that makes it impossible for me to take it seriously when people say there‚Äôs a ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù amongst trans people. Y‚Äôall just want abusers using silver tongues to get their way. A+++

Prior to the surgery all was good, I had to provide reports and a biography including bloods scans and cardiology report plus two psychological reports, when I arrived I had to have everything done again. I went into the theatre and again discussed the operation and confirmed the op was a sigmoid 3. When he came to see me afterwards he just turned around and left. Over the next 3 weeks I tried to talk to him about what happened but didn&#39;t get any response. The after care was the nurse took photos and sent them to him. I had no contact with him, I was issued a flight clearance from the clinic and sent on my way. I have sent a number of emails to the clinic but no reply. They are happy to take the money the feed back is all positive but from experience don&#39;t go to the Asian cosmetic clinic.

I had SRS approx 7 weeks ago in Asia cosmetic clinic and have never had as much care in my life and would have no hesitation recommending this Doctor. He is one of the nicest people I‚Äôve ever met and delighted with my surgery. The staff are amazing and couldn‚Äôt do enough and since I‚Äôve been home they have been the ones who have kept in touch . Many thanks again Dr tonasak to you and your wonderful staff .

I seen 2 posts about this surgery and each said &#34;flew over from scotland&#34; two diff accounts.

Seems suspicious that you two said exactly the same thing.

Now 4 months post op from Asia cosmetic clinic and all going nicely. I don‚Äôt know why the previous poster wasn‚Äôt happy but I‚Äôd recommend Dr Tonangsak in an instance. Such a delightful man and hope to pay them a visit to say hello in march when I visit Bangkok. I‚Äôm going to say I would trust Dr Tanongsak with my life .
