According to my hospital records the time between me getting sedated and transferred to recovery was 75 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Is this a normal time for the operation ? I was told it normally takes around two hours.

I had that kind of surgery and I was don ine a little over 6h. The surgeon said that less that 6h is not enough time to do everything. The PPT version of the surgery was around 9h.

Thanks Luna. Your result looks a lot better than mine even before your revision.
</p>
<p>
I have the same issue you had with it looking like testicles but my scarring is horrific in comparison. Huge purple V at 6 months it&#39;s disgusting.
</p>
<p>
I can remember going under just before 9:30 and seeing the clock in recovery at 10:50.  From what you said it looks like mine was just rushed. I&#39;m not surprised it looks crap ðŸ˜¥

Might be rushed
</p>
<p>
For revision i got told the surgery duration is 1-3 hours but for me it would most likely be 3-4 hours due to having more to do
</p>
<p>
ðŸ«‚ Maybe they can change stuff in revision if you wanna do it
</p>
<p>
What helped me with scarring was maybe also using E3 creme there which is the default for dilation and scarring from the surgeon team i was with

Tbh I&#39;m scared of letting him lose on me again and terrified that I will end up in the same pain as the first time. Had quite a traumatic time while there :(
</p>
<p>
I have asked the hospital if someone else can fix it but not had anything official back yet. Not even sure if I could physically walk into the hospital again let alone walk to the anesthetist area, lay on that bed and ... Nope I&#39;m crying again just thinking about it.

Don&#39;t judge how it looks for 6 to 12 months. There is a lot of swelling and healing which will take place.

Do you realize that when you have surgery they create surgeons note that document and timestamp the everything. Some patient portals will make these available by default and others withhold them as part of your medical record.
</p>
<p>
These notes will contain a step by step accounting of the  surgery from Anesthesia and innovation to every single medication they used along the way.  It should contains verbal description of what the surgeon did and observed and if any unexpected issues hoped up and how they were handled.
</p>
<p>
I suggest you check your online medical account for these documents. If they aren&#39;t there you can file a request for these records. When you make the request make sure you are specific about what records you want.
</p>
<p>
Now, I don&#39;t know what your state of mind is on the outcome you describe, but you should be aware that in most surgery releases, there are clauses that are triggered that allow the provider to withhold records if you give them any reason to believe the request is for litigation purposes. It&#39;s best to remain cool calm and collected when seeking your medical records in general.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, all this is pretty standard record keeping.

I have the (almost) complete records clearly stating the time into and out of surgery and the anesthetist logs ect. Plus about 200 pages of other stuff involving my time there. It&#39;s a legal right to all this information in my country.

Is there any thing that looks odd in the documentation other than the overall time?  I agree that 70 minutes sounds more like a vulvaplasty. My grs was over 6 hours, but I was only the surgeon&#39;s 6th or 7th practice victim, so the surgery time didn&#39;t surprise me.

Nothing that I can see but the writing is difficult to understand as I don&#39;t know the names of the drugs or abbreviations etc.
</p>
<p>
Heart rate was 130 when I went under then about 100 all through apart from half way in where it dropped and they administered something starting with f.
</p>
<p>
Think it says I was given adrenalin in recovery but I could be misreading it. What I do know is that I was wide awake at 1050 talking to the recovery nurse the whole time including when I was pushed back to my room. I was with it enough to use my phone and ask my partner to come in. I thought I would have been completely out of it for longer. (Had a nerve block so was paralyzed and couldn&#39;t feel anything below the waist so not in any pain at that point).

I&#39;m certainly not qualified to comment on any of that, but it does provide you with something to work with if you could find another physician or surgeon to review.

I haven&#39;t got rid of mine. Resigned to either looking disfigured for the rest of my life or keeping fighting to get it fixed. Either way my mental health is as a very low point and there is little hope in sight.

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever heard of such a short time. Itâ€™s remarkably fast. What day of the week was it?

If you could name your surgeon Iâ€™d like to add this post to the surgery wiki.

It was on a Saturday. Bellringer had already done in the anesthetist words &#39;a quick one&#39; then it was me. He done at least one more that afternoon and possibly two.

Thought it might be something like that. You&#39;d hope it makes no difference, but looks like surgeons got better things to do.

It would seem to fit with what I experienced. 75 minutes seems very quick to me and much shorter than I was expecting. He also lied to me when I asked at my checkup and said it was two hours, He had the paperwork in front of him so there is no excuse.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also not sure how common it is to get injected with adrenaline in recovery, I really could have done without being that awake and alert so quickly as well. Most other girls I seen through my open door were completely out of it getting wheeled back to their rooms while I can vividly remember the lively conversation I was having with Neil the recovery nurse.
</p>
<p>
It all just seems like a lack of care, rushing everything to get away as fast as they could with no respect for the fact it&#39;s given me a poor result. I&#39;m so disappointed ðŸ¥º

I don&#39;t know where you had it done. I had mine Montreal by Dr laungany and I was waking up less than two hours later. I don&#39;t remember how long exactly it lasted but it was less than 90 minutes. I remember getting in the surgery room around 11 and I was awake a little before 1

Dr Gurjala did mine. It took about 5.5 hours. I love the results.

75 minutes!  Wow.  That is really quick!  I had my SRS with Dr Chettawut and the surgery was 4-5 hours.  He has done thousands of SRS surgeries over many years, but he still takes his time to meticulously craft a natural looking vagina with distinct labia.  A good looking result takes time, and I don&#39;t feel that is possible in 75 minutes.  I&#39;m sorry to hear of your bad result. :(

<em>
[she shared with me her private post-op photos and once again asked that I post my response publicly after initially sharing my remarks with her.  I wrote:]
</em>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Thank you for sharing. Yes, I agree the scars are really bad. It should be much better than that after 6 months post-op.
</p>
<p>
And looking at the one week post op picture, the stitches were done in a very sloppy way that ensured a poor result with scarring. Definitely looks like the surgeon did not take his time to produce a good result. So sorry :(
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery with Dr Chettawut 5 years ago, and while I wasn&#39;t fully healed after 6 months, the scars were much better healed than that (and I am traditionally a slow healer after surgeries)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;ll also add that the scar is in an ugly V-shape as she describes in her other comments.  It really stands out from the rest of her skin.  And the surgeon didn&#39;t create much of any labia at all.  I guess this is what happens when a surgeon tries to do everything in 75 minutes... sad.

About 1h30m here. Very happy with the results. I would add that the time taken for surgery is not a direct indication of the end result nor it means it was rushed, especially because certain surgeons are known to do it faster than others.
</p>
<p>
Having said that, I&#39;m sorry you are not very happy with your results.
