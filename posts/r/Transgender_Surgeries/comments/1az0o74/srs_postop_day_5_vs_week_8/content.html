It is recommended but I believe they will let you get by with just Laser if you can&#39;t find an Electrolysis provider. They do also do a follicle scrape for any hair that might have been missed or difficult

I&#39;m so sorry to hear your result was less than desirable. I obviously can not begin to understand what you&#39;re going through, All I can say is that every surgeon has good and bad results. It is truly tragic that this is the case.  You have to know you&#39;re not alone, and I feel a majority of girls that post here typically share your experience because they are looking for the validation that their result is as bad as they think it is.  And because of this I feel like you rarely see the good outcomes.  My point is while you had a poor result, that isn&#39;t necessarily they typical result of a particular surgeon
