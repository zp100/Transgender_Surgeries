My thoughts on recovery after surgery.
</p>
<p>
Pain is something I still struggle with, it is due to a urinary tract infection and not the procedure itself. at least I believe it is, I have been on antibiotics for 2 days now and every time I go to pee I feel a huge relief from pain and discomfort. I&#39;m hoping this will resolve itself once the infection is eradicated.
</p>
<p>
The second thought concerns painkillers which I take less and less but I also feel very bad that I took the maximum dose for so long after the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I certainly lacked knowledge and experience in what it&#39;s like to have urinary tract infections and I thought it was &#34;aaa minor infection probably doesn&#39;t even hurt&#34; It hurts like hell and it&#39;s even worse than after the surgery itself.
</p>
<p>
I wish I had asked for more advice from my nurse.  But well, that&#39;s who I am. Satisfied but not satisfied with the pain.

Congrats!!
</p>
<p>
I’ll just focus in on your comment about needing high doses of painkillers for a while after the surgery. I also once internalized the implicit message that “taking lots of painkillers after a surgery is a moral failing” when it’s just that you might fall on the low end of the pain tolerance bell curve, like me. I hear this so often it’s like whack-a-mole. I think the actual problem is more that the world is globally shifting towards going lighter on painkiller dosing, using weaker (and often insufficiently effective) painkillers, and all for a shorter time. For some with high pain tolerance, it makes no difference. For others, it’s trauma-inducing. SRS concerns the most nerve-dense part of your body, of course it’s going to hurt without painkillers. If you know you need them,
<em>
especially
</em>
to handle dilation, then use them without shame.
</p>
<p>
And yes, UTIs can be excruciating. UTI pain is often wildly understated and can require opioids for the first couple days especially before the antibiotics do their job.
</p>
<p>
Wishing you a speedy recovery and much less pain in the very near future. &lt;3
