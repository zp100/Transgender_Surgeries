I had FFS with Dr. Baez in Guadalajara Mexico a few months ago and just wanted to give a recommendation.
</p>
<p>
I had type 3 forehead, nose, liplift, sliding genioplasty and minor jaw shave. It cost around 14k USD for the surgery side, I think.
</p>
<p>
In surgery:

.
</p>
<p>
I chose Dr. Baez for the consistency and aesthetic result of his nose work and from seeing his forehead work. The results are dramatic in my opinion - I was worried because of my very large sinus structure was going to be an issue. I couldn&#39;t imagine a better result. Another surgeon, recommended by Dr. Baez, did the jaw and chin work at the same time. Sadly CT scans I had taken prior showed the nerve in my jaw would prevent a full jaw shave. The chin has been thinned and the jaw shaved a little which I think has helped. I am pleased with the result. I wanted to get fat transfer to the face but Dr. Baez does not do this surgery. I feel I will need to do this in the future.
</p>
<p>
Recovery was in a recovery house for 2 weeks. It was very comfortable but it was difficult to communicate at times. Initial healing was fine and pain was minimal. I was pretty dependent on the nurses at the recovery house for the first week. I could have managed on my own in the second week, but long plane travel would have been a nightmare. I had an infection at the mouth sutures a few weeks after returning home which was treated with antibiotics just fine. The lip lift wound is still healing a little - I have always seemed to heal slow. There has been little random sensations/pains as the nerves heal in the head/forehead. The nose and jaw have had no pain. Overall, getting through the first week was kind of rough getting over the trauma of the surgery, and after that it has been fine.
</p>
<p>
I had contact with the doctor through email and video consults as needed before surgery. This has continued after surgery. He is very accessible and polite.
</p>
<p>
I am very pleased and think the results are ideal for what was done and very aesthetically pleasing. I am no longer disturbed by my own appearance. Sadly I don&#39;t seem to pass still (at all) and will have to work on this somehow, including having adam&#39;s apple reduced soon as part of VFS.

Hi. Thank you for sharing your surgery experience. Beautiful! Sadly, there is very little info on him. How did you decide? Hugs.

I looked for surgeons in other countries since no one really does FFS here. I couldn&#39;t afford the most recommended like facial team and US surgeons, so I was then looking for who I could afford who would offer the best results.
</p>
<p>
A friend of a friend was working in his office and another had had surgery with him. There was also a patient coordinator who was working with him that was available to talk on reddit. That was enough to at least set up consults with him and from speaking with him at length and making sure that everything he said made sense to me I started the process. I had doubts a bit later and talked with him again.
</p>
<p>
There is no real hard justification I can point at, because in the end it is just reputation and the small evidence we can gather that lets us determine who to go with.
</p>
<p>
edit: Oh, and I was super concerned with if anything could be done with my brow given the sinus structure and the pretty bad configuration. I have seen people go to surgeons looking like me and coming back with less than good results. There was also the fact that some surgeons will destroy the sinus lining and seal it up as matter of course, where papers from surgeons indicate this is not required and maybe not optimal. That allowed me to at least eliminate a number of possibilities.

This was so helpful to read as I&#39;m preparing for a consult with Dr. Baez next week. Can you share which recovery house you went with?

It is comparatively expensive, but fine. No english. They didn&#39;t really understand the kinds of foods I needed to be eating after surgery since I couldn&#39;t chew. They did simple medical things - cleaning wounds, giving medications. Took me to get the medications I needed. Took me to appointments and such. Food was good. Buy bottled water for everything (drinking, brushing teeth). Don&#39;t drink dairy.
</p>
<p>
I was there for two weeks. I could have left after a week. If you are in US then maybe leaving earlier is easier.

In terms of the visual results, the forehead is still amazing to me. The nose is exactly as expected. Scarring around the lip lift is still kind of bad compared to other people, but this is normal for me.
</p>
<p>
Jaw is not great, with feeling of movement/weakness and an obvious bump where there is both a mismatch of the joins and then how the flesh/bone has healed around it. It doesn&#39;t really bother me.
</p>
<p>
Healing was a long time for me. Swelling took basically 2 years to completely resolve, as there was some left around the upper eyes for a long time. I think it is just a me thing.
</p>
<p>
I believe the bone plates on my forehead are not completely good, with some weakness on them and holes to the underlying sinus. This has given some headaches and maybe causing ear issues sometimes. I should probably get some scans done to assess how that is all gone.
</p>
<p>
I feel the thing that was missed, though I have no idea if anything was possible, is the ridges on the sides of my forehead are quite prominent and kind of masc and I want to do something about it.
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/aOGcSa2.png" rel="nofollow">Random google image</a>
, note the sharp angle that catches the shadow. Maybe some of that could have been reduced or maybe I need to do filler or something?
</p>
<p>
I am very pleased with my FFS and would recommend Dr Baez for all the work he does. I would not recommend the jaw surgeon he uses.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
I am vaguely looking at doing fat transfers and/or cheek implants, and for someone to look at the jaw and chin again to see if anything could be done. But it&#39;s all a bit much at the moment and I wouldn&#39;t know where I would go for any of this given my budget.

Personally I just want to have: feminizing rhinoplasty, type 3 frontoplasty and orbital remodeling, eyebrow lift, feminization of the chin, cheekbone implants and lipo on the neck, Do you think Dr. Báez is a good choice for this?

Unless something has changed since, he does not personally do the jaw/chin stuff and no cheek implants or lipo.
</p>
<p>
I think you need to look at his noses since they are basically all the same. Will this suit your face?

As for the forehead and nose, I love what he does and that doesn&#39;t worry me much (luckily I have a face with some passing), I&#39;m more worried about the other procedures,  cheekbones, chin and neck lipo, I want to have good results.

I researched and kind of concluded maybe facial team is good idea generally. Otherwise not sure.
