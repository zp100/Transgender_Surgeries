<div class="post-body">
<div class="md">
<p>
(Pictures below)
<br>
I had surgery with Dr Javier Luis Rossi in Buenos Aires earlier this year, I trusted him with my long awaited FFS, and he turned my hopes in to a living nightmare.
</p>
<p>
I contacted his clinic &#34;T-change&#34; about 6 months before the surgery and talked to the coordinator named Amanda.
</p>
<p>
I sent in photos etc and me and her decided over email that I was going to do forehead type 3, rhinoplasty, as well as jaw and chin surgery. A lip lift was included free of charge if Dr Rossi deemed it necessary. The total price for FFS was about $15 000.
</p>
<p>
I had no contact with the surgeon until the in-person consultation right before the surgery date. This should have set off alarm bells, but after waiting for so long, I just wanted the surgery to finally move forward with my life. Since he seemed to have decent reviews, I didn&#39;t overthink it at the time.
</p>
<p>
Arriving in Buenos Aires, I was met by Amanda and taken to my Airbnb, where preparations began with standard blood work and an X-ray. Dr. Rossi had decided against doing a CT scan, calling it unnecessary. At this point canceling would have meant losing my payment entirely, so I decided to keep going despite my growing concerns.
</p>
<p>
We then got to the in person consultation with Dr Rossi and this is where it started getting obvious that he&#39;s not someone who cares about his craft or the patients he performs surgery on.
</p>
<p>
The consultation lasted about 5 minutes. He apologized for being 30 minutes late and for forgetting his laptop so he couldn&#39;t show me his 3d virtual surgery simulation using some software.
</p>
<p>
Dr Rossi has the personality of a sleazy car salesman. He didn&#39;t give any real info on what he was going to do, he instead repeatedly just said that &#34;it&#39;s going to be wonderful darling&#34;. He showed no pictures of former patients and told me to not be worried. Again, alarm bells!!!
</p>
<p>
He mentioned the free lip lift and said that he doesn&#39;t like doing the bullhorn method and that he prefers the &#34;direct&#34; lip lift method. Another name for it is apparently gullwing lip lift.
</p>
<p>
I had never heard of this method but he insisted on that this is the best way to do it and that I was going to &#34;look wonderful darling!&#34;
</p>
<p>
I was stupid enough to trust him on this and it cost me dearly.
</p>
<p>
After waking up from the surgery I stayed one night at the hospital and was then taken back to the Airbnb.
</p>
<p>
The aftercare was rather lackluster, I got no pain meds or anything, just some anti inflammatory and antibiotics. Nothing for pain.
</p>
<p>
My concerns started growing when I saw the shape of my upper lip. He had completely removed the cupids bow and the incision had slanted off the edge of my lip and went about half an inch off straight to the side. While i obviously had a lot of swelling it was clear that this wasn&#39;t done very well. I mentioned this to Amanda and she pretended not to see it at first, and told me that I&#39;m swollen and shouldn&#39;t worry so much.
</p>
<p>
At a meeting post op with Dr Rossi and Amanda the lip lift result was brought up again and Dr Rossi just dismissed it and said it was done perfectly and that &#34;it looks wonderful!!&#34;
</p>
<p>
I brought it up again with Amanda right before leaving for the airport and she again pretended not to see it, until she finally caved in and said yes but it&#39;ll heal just right.
</p>
<p>
I gave it time for swelling etc to go down and I can now say that he&#39;s wronged me on more things than just botching my upper lip.
</p>
<p>
Brow bone: There is a little difference, but not a whole lot. my left orbital is kind of &#34;sticking out&#34; quite a bit and i can feel a gap in my skull if i run my finger over my left orbital. The right orbital is flatter and doesnt have the issues the left one does, so it is very uneven looking.
</p>
<p>
The browbone above the nose area still sticks out quite a bit, it&#39;s as if he&#39;s left a little too much. It&#39;s far from &#34;the amazing forehead results&#34; I hear people say about his forehead work on this very subreddit. And as mentioned my left orbital isn&#39;t shaved down properly and i can feel a gap in my skull.
</p>
<p>
nose: No major complaints, i think it looks good in side profile, a little wonky from the front but again not great, not terrible.
</p>
<p>
Chin and jaw: He didn&#39;t touch the actual angle of the mandible, but instead did a very conservative shave of one side of the jaw, it looks the same in before and after pictures.
</p>
<p>
On the other side however he was way more aggressive with the shave, and since he didn&#39;t touch the angle of the jaw this time either, I now have a deep indent in my jaw (see picture)
</p>
<p>
So now I have an indent in my jaw and then the mandibular angle still sticking out!
</p>
<p>
As for the chin, the sliding genioplasty was also very conservative, but even then he still managed to make it uneven, if you look closely you can see that one side of my chin sits a little lower than the other, it&#39;s not a massive imperfection but still further proof that his work was very sloppy.
</p>
<p>
The biggest problem is clearly my lip, he not only performed the lip lift incorrectly, as the so called direct method should follow the edges of the entire lips, to keep the M shaped cupids bow, and lift the lip evenly like with the bullhorn method, and not just make a line in the middle like he did. As mentioned earlier he also slanted the knife off by about half an inch making my scars look even worse.
</p>
<p>
Even if the scars would have turned out fine, the shape of the lips are ruined as the M shape is completely removed, now it looks like my upper lip is a lower lip turned upside down.
</p>
<p>
I contacted them and they refuse to understand where I&#39;m coming from and think everything went great. I guess from their perspective it is true, they got my money and to them that&#39;s all that matters.
</p>
<p>
They said that the scar is unfortunate but that the lip lift was otherwise successful (EXCUSE ME WHAT?!?!?!?!). I feel lied to and deeply betrayed by two people i decided to put my trust in to.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve consulted with several surgeons regarding my lip and they all said that it&#39;s extremely unfortunate that he did this, that it was unprofessional and extremely poorly performed, and that it is sadly going to be borderline impossible to fix.
</p>
<p>
Today, I’m left not just with disappointing results and an empty wallet, but with a lasting reminder of how badly this experience has affected my confidence. Trusting Dr. Rossi was the biggest mistake of my life, and I suffer daily from the choices he made with my face.
</p>
<p>
I will not show pictures of my entire face due to todays political climate but I&#39;ve provided pictures of my complaints made in this post.

Thank you for sharing this. It&#39;s very hard to find testimonies from people who aren&#39;t satisfied with Dr. Rossi, and the testimonies you
<em>
can
</em>
find on here seem to disappear for some reason or another. That lip lift is actually kind of shocking. Hard to see how an experienced surgeon can even mess up that bad.

Send me a DM. I was also botched by Rossi 2 years ago. I kind of feel guilty for not speaking up about it.

SabrinaSaturn, this is Amanda. Unfortunately working with flesh and bones is not as predictable as working with clay or wood. Without mentioning details of what didn’t go well with your surgery, you have been offered a revision to fix it free of medical fees long ago, both via email and video consult. We are still waiting for you to come. You are always welcome.

As I said I’m not familiar with Argentinian law but in Swedish law a waiver isn’t really that much of a shield against malpractice. It’s more to protect against potential complications which the person getting into the agreement has been informed of.
</p>
<p>
I can’t begin to understand how you must feel right now but I’d still contact a lawyer or legal professional, especially since a dispute usually has to be filed in a specific time frame.

Talk to a medical malpractice lawyer, getting your face fixed can be included as part of the settlement fee + emotional damage + lawyer fees. That how it works in the US, Argentina might be different but iirc its a fairly rich/advanced area.

I don’t know the law of Argentina, can not stress that enough. But I still think you should talk to a legal professional, even if it seems hopeless. If for anything, for justice and maybe some money to get at least some help with your ffs with another surgeon.

This is absolutely criminal; and I&#39;m wondering if it was really Dr. Rossi, or if he sent one of his cousins in to cover for him and practice his own craft.  None of your surgeries are impressive, and even with a waiver, I believe that there&#39;s an overwhelming body of evidence that this is pure negligence and malpractice.  The waiver is likely just saying that results may vary from patient to patient, and that they aren&#39;t promising to make you look like Barbie.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m with the others.  Consult with an attorney.   You have too much on the line, and this is a blemish that would go viral against all medical travel to Argentina.

I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s really horrible. Rossi didn&#39;t leave me with any outrageous negatives but everything you said about your experience resonates with me. Rossi being chronically late (virtual consult, in person consults and surgery). His personality being very jarring. Amanda refusing to see obvious visual problems (in my case a lot of swelling that went away but her refusal to acknowledge was what visually obvious was horrible).
</p>
<p>
My results weren&#39;t the worst but weren&#39;t good. Very conservative overall and now that swelling has disappeared (over a year post) there&#39;s some obvious chin asymmetry (I didn&#39;t have the sliding genioplasty but your description of the outcome matches mine). Also I pulled a four inch long piece of black thread from my forehead four months after (I thought it was a weird zit until taking some tweezers to it and was very surprised). And his description of the incision being inside the hairline was misleading, I have a prominent hairline scar I&#39;m very self conscious of. He didn&#39;t touch anything below the middle bridge of the nose (his website mentions &#39;light upward curve&#39; but there was no attempt) and I have a lump in the middle of my nose like there&#39;s unshaved bone, visible and light shines off it even in pictures. Also if I touch the wrong part of my eyebrow I get an electric shock sensation through the forehead even over a year later.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend Rossi to anyone, I would actively dissuade anyone looking at him. I shouldn&#39;t have rushed to him honestly, after seeing the results on the website and feeling that none of them were very transformative but he had availability when I did. For a cheap SA option I wish I&#39;d tried Cardenas instead (and have since met one of his patients who had great results).

I&#39;m so sorry for your experience. I thought about going to him because there aren&#39;t many FFS options in Europe besides FacialTeam whose results are mixed bag but now I decided against Dr. Rossi. Thank you for sharing.

I am very sorry for what happened to you, I had surgery with Dr Rossi at least two years ago, although I can say that his approach was conservative and I could have obtained better results, I do not consider that they were bad at all.
</p>
<p>
I agree with you regarding his personality, I hope they can give you an answer.

Thank you for sharing this. Sorry it happened to you, but reading the post....THIS makes me a bit at ease. See I paid for my FFS, arrived in BA, Amanda was rude &amp; off putting, and it was all just awful. Same with Dr.Rossi, in person consult was cancelled. Anyway few days before my surgery I get a serious case of pneumonia, thought I was gonna die, Amanda blamed me for not wearing a mask on the plane. These are seriously vile people! I went home to recover, and told them I won&#39;t come back since this was my 1 shot, i am taking care of a loved one who is dying. They refuse to refund me 17.000 dollars that I paid. Rossi said it went for materials, and his team. Just awful all around, I even considered going back, but wasn&#39;t able to. 5 years it took me to save that money, so I was seriously depressed over it, especially with my situation at home. But reading this I maybe dodged a bullet at a huge expense!!  I plan to take legal action, can I DM you?

Miss_Emi. This is Amanda. The day of your surgery you had an infection of the respiratory system with fever. For your safety and according to the medical protocols for general anesthesia, your surgery couldn’t be carried out. We proposed you to postpone the surgery for the next week. You only needed to extend your stay one week and change your flight tickets. Instead of that, you changed your flight ticket for the next day and returned to your country 2 days after the failed surgery. You said the original date was a -once-in-a-lifetime date and no other date would work (and refused to say why). We offered you to come back in another trip for the same price you had paid, even if inflation in Argentina has been extremely high and our pricelist had been updated. You said no, later on you said yes, then you said no again.

If someone has a genuine medical illness which causes a cancellation then they should be refunded. They are not obliged to reschedule if this time doesn’t suit them and they certainly are not obliged to provide an explanation for why a certain alternate date may not suit. Your post also breaches this persons medical confidentiality…

I’m sorry this man did this to you. He belongs in prison. You’re so brave for sharing your story to warn others.
</p>
<p>
I’d like to advise all my sisters to steer clear of the Argentinian surgeons. More specifically DiMaggio and Rossi. They even worked as a team ages ago.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen quite some horror stories first hand from patients that had surgery with them.
</p>
<p>
These two when they’re good, they’re good. But when they mess up be prepared for utter negligence and zero accountability.

Dr. Rossi and Dr. Di Maggio never worked together. They are not even friends. They have different backgrounds, different ages and got trained in different hospitals. They have very different personalities as well, and they use different techniques. I can tell from very first hand because I worked with both of them (not at the same time, but in different periods).
</p>
<p>
How can you say so lightly that Dr. Rossi belongs to prison? He has operated about a thousand of trans patients in the last 13 years and thousands of patients overall during 25 years, and he has made the vast majority of them very happy and improved their lives. He knows how to “disassemble” and “reassemble” a whole face. He can fix a face after a car crash and leave it prettier than before. The scar of one upper lip lift (the smallest procedure in an FFS) became hypertrophic. Lynching him, or wishing him prison just because of that is totally unfair. He didn’t invent the lip lift technique. It has been used for decades and he has seen it coming back into trend in surgical conferences.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen patients who were unhappy with FFS performed in every country in the world, including the United States, Mexico, Belgium, Thailand, India and Spain, etc. I don’t know what country you are from, but advising your sisters to steer clear of the Argentinian surgeons sounds xenophobic and absurd, to say the least. The OP was offered solutions: triamcinolone injections at an earlier stage of the scarring, and surgery in second term. She didn’t accept them. Her answer so far was sending us to burn in hell.

if you&#39;re going to try to do damage control then at least stick to the truth, because this is just a bad look for you. As I said in the original post and as per my emails, the scar on the lip is not the only issue. The lip lift was performed incorrectly. It is clearly obvious that Dr Rossi just did a straight incision over my lip, killing the cupids bow and only lifting the middle part of my upper lip. Here is an image of how the direct lip lift technique should  be performed:
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/cms/10.1177/07488068231215114/asset/images/large/10.1177_07488068231215114-fig2.jpeg">https://journals.sagepub.com/cms/10.1177/07488068231215114/asset/images/large/10.1177_07488068231215114-fig2.jpeg
</a>
</p>
<p>
Do you see how it keeps the shape of the lip and goes over the entire lip, keeping its original shape, but changing the proportion? The surgeon you&#39;re working with clearly did not do this and did an incredibly sloppy job with it. You calling me a liar doesn&#39;t help because we can all see for ourselves. In our emails you said that the only issue with the lip lfit was the scar, nothing else. that it looked good and feminine, that is insane to be quite honest with you.
</p>
<p>
You also kept telling me how none of my other issues are real and said I suffer from mental illnesses causing me to be delusional. How is it then that people in real life can feel a gap in my skull? How is it that I have an uneven jaw with a deep indentation in it?
</p>
<p>
You coming in here and lying only further damages your brand. I didn&#39;t want to have to make an update to this post but you&#39;re forcing my hand. I&#39;m so very sad and disappointed with how both you and Rossi have treated me and that you keep insisting on taking zero accountability. Shame.

No, they did not work together at any point. There have been 3 surgeons working at what today is T-Change (originally named GenderWays): Dr. Ciechomski (in 2006), Dr. Di Maggio (from 2007 to the beginning of 2013) and Dr. Rossi (from the end of 2013 to present). There was no overlapping in their working periods and each of them worked with their own surgical team (their own anesthesiologist, their own assistants, their own surgical technician). The only thing in common is having worked with me.

I’m so sorry love, I usually don’t comment on posts like this but I 100% agree with you and how you feel with the results, something went wrong with the lip lift. I sadly don’t have a solution for that as of now but I give you all my love and support.

It seems really strange that he&#39;ll do a bullhorn lip lift for some, and push others away from a bullhorn. Makes me wonder if it was someone else doing OP&#39;s surgery and this surgeon didn&#39;t actually know how to do a bullhorn.

Girl, I am sorry 😔 I hope T change and Amanda will treat you with dignity, and offer you a free revision (it&#39;s worth their reputation). I had surgery with T change this year, and was happy with everything Rossi did, including the lip lift. I had surgery, and met 4 other women getting similar surgeries, and they including me were happy with what Dr Rossi could do for their faces. They should accept the poor lip lift happened, in addition to issues in other areas, and help you achieve the results you were expecting. I respect owning up to mistakes and fixing things; that is what is right in this situation. Not your fault for picking Dr Rossi because I have seen so many good results, and there are good reviews.

I know what you are talking about with the rushed consultation. I was basically told I was asking too many questions. I found Dr Rossi was very Macho and self-assured, but not gonna lie, that is the kind of behaviour I needed to reassure me at the time since it was my life savings. You do not deserve the treatment you have received, and just know it isn&#39;t right. Even if legally they do not have to provide a revision, it is the right thing for them to do.

I really don’t think it’s advisable to have this surgical team do a revision. Free or otherwise

Oh wow I’m sorry for your experience.  I read so many wonderful accounts of Dr Rossi on this and other threads to the point where I was like if all else fails in the US I might go to him.  So crazy!
