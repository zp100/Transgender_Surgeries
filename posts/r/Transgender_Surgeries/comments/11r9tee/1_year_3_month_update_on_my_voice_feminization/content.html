Hey Reddit world, it&#39;s been a minute. Life got crazy there for awhile. I&#39;ve made posts here and there around my surgery and the progression of my recovery, and wanted to post another update.
</p>
<p>
So, my original surgery was in November 2021. I had what Dr Haben refers to as the &#34;Triple&#34; procedure. This consists of a Wendler Glottoplasty (my vocal folds were shortened about 40%, I asked him to be aggressive as he usually goes closer to 30%), a CTA / cricothyroid approximation, and a  chondrolaryngoplasty (Tracheal Shave). The cost was about $9k, not including travel expenses.
</p>
<p>
My recovery went well, you can see my past posts for details around that. Just past the 6 month mark, I started noticing some pitch decrease. I went in for a consult with Dr Haben in Aug 2022, and he did a physical examination. He found that there was about a 10% increase in range of motion of the cricothyroid joint, and said I would likely be a good candidate for a revision of the CTA. I opted to do this, at a cost of about $6k not including travel expenses (he doesn&#39;t charge for revisions on his own patients but the hospital charges for the use of their facilities). I had this done in November 2022.
</p>
<p>
As I write this, I am at 1 year 3 months post op from my original surgery, and just over 3 months from my revision. I consider the revision to be successful, as it restored me to where I was at about the 6 month mark after my initial surgery, before the pitch drop started. I won&#39;t be considered fully healed from the revision until November of 2023, so another pitch drop is possible, but unlikely.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m extremely glad I had this procedure. It was my first gender affirming surgery, I had the initial surgery just 4 months after my egg cracked. It has changed my life. I have not once been misgendered due to my voice since the surgery. It helps me feel much, much less self conscious in women&#39;s spaces, and most importantly, it just sounds like me. I have also done a total of about 6 months worth of speech therapy consisting of about 8-10 sessions, which was done between the 3 and 9 month mark after my original surgery.
</p>
<p>
Voice sample provided here. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions anyone has :)

It sounds absolutely cis to me, albeit a little stuffy. This procedure really interests me.

Impressive shift, you sound great.
</p>
<p>
The recovery period is my biggest issue with doing this myself. Can I ask how long you had to remain silent for after, and also what is your overall range like around your new pitch? Thnx

Oh shit yeah I should&#39;ve mentioned that. 30 days of voice rest for both surgeries. That means not a sound. No whispering, sighing, laughing, literally anything that produces sound. It was definitely challenging from a logistical perspective in terms of work but I didn&#39;t really mind it that much

Oh gosh yeah I imagine so with that job! It takes some accommodations but it&#39;s kind of peaceful, honestly. My experience was that everyone I interacted with in person assumed I was deaf and was VERY nice to me

Oh I didn&#39;t answer the 2nd part of your question. I have about an octave of useable range. It&#39;s definitely on the small side, and it does cause problems for me sometimes. I also can&#39;t really sing anymore. These are both due to the CTA. But I knew this going in, and for me it&#39;s worth the trade-off.

Your result is awesome, I&#39;m myself thinking to so it in future, only my question is, is there some app which can be precise about how would your voice sounds when feminize it!??

Not that I know of, even if there was I doubt it would be very accurate, there are so many variables.

Who are you going with? He&#39;s a wonderful human, he truly cares about his patients and the post surgery care I received from him, even from the other side of the country, was amazing. Definitely recommend him.

I am going with Katherine Yung. Since I live in idaho. I was reading his page after you posted, and he requires an in person consultation? Flying to new york would be hard to do for a mere consult.

Ah I&#39;m not familiar with her. Yes he does require an in person consult, but you don&#39;t have to do it as a separate trip, I didn&#39;t. I flew into Rochester on a Monday, had my consult with him Tuesday, surgery on Wednesday, post op consult on Thu, and then flew home on Fri.

How long it takes to recover from this type of surgery? I&#39;m considering doing it in the future but i heard it can take months for you to be able to speak normally.

Yes, the recovery is intense. 30 days of absolutely no speaking. The next 1-2 months after that you are highly encouraged to speak only quietly and as little as possible, and you&#39;ll sound a bit like a cartoon character. No yelling for 6 months. Considered fully healed at 12 months. It&#39;s a commitment for sure.

Can you sing? What about yelling? Are there any aspects of your voice that you lost other than lower pitch?
