Heyo,
</p>
<p>
Figured I give a small update. Today they took the wound vac out and changed wound dressing. Still have the catheter in. Bowel movements have been getting closer to pre-opt normal. I have more or less full mobility--walking around my room, getting in and out of bed/chairs, going to the bathroom on my own.
</p>
<p>
Been a bit paranoid about changing dressings after a bowel movement, just don&#39;t want to chance anything. The nurses here have been really reassuring and helpful with this.
</p>
<p>
Been spending plenty of time on VCs with friends and my parents have been stopping by.
</p>
<p>
Not at all related to the surgery but had some good laughs with the nurses over dumb jokes and small talk.
</p>
<p>
Still haven&#39;t processed that I have a vagina now or that I don&#39;t have a penis/balls. I&#39;m sure once the dressings are off and I start dilating, this will change.
</p>
<p>
Thanks y&#39;all for the support on the other posts (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠)
</p>

things didnt really hit me until a few days after i had everything off, right as i was about to leave the clinic to head home. i was a crying, teary mess (joyful tears) when things settled and i actually realized what happened. wouldnt change it for the world - 11 days post op:)

I am definitely going to be such a teary mess once this all settles. Wanted this since I was a little girl. Glad it finally happened. It&#39;s reassuring to hear that it all fell into place for you

i think the first bit is very scary and full of anxiety, once you have time to breathe things will hit and it feels so good:) and never force a bowel movement!!

Thank you. I&#39;ll keep that in mind. Oh my, I could not imagine forcing a bowel movement ATM. My core strength is completely gone and it hurts to even just sneeze
