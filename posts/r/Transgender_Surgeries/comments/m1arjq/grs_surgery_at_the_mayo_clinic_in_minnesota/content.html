I have it behind me!
<br>
I had GRS about 6 weeks ago at the mayo clinic in Rochester Minnesota.  My surgeon was Dr.  Jorys Martinez-Jorge.  I am very happy with the outcome, and a few female friends insured me it looks like any natal vulva/vagina they have seen.  I felt very well taken care of in the mayo clinic Methodist Hospital, and probably had the best nursing staff one could think of.
<br>
Dr. Martinez-Jorge has very good bedside manners, and the entire surgical team is great.  Postop care and communication is great, and his assistant  Anna C Lin is outstanding.I am glad that I went to the Mayo for my surgery, and can only recommend them

So very happy for you. If I may, one personal question: Was electrolysis required? Of all things, once I have insurance coverage for surgery, which my employer is working on, this is what is causing me  the most concern. I don&#39;t think I can face that.

Is electrolysis expensive where you are?  Here it&#39;s roughly $1 a minute which while not cheap, seems reasonable.  Painful yes but, some things are unavoidable and, at least for most I&#39;d imagine, worth it.  Can&#39;t think of many worse things than hair growing inside me.

It&#39;s about $170 an hour. I had my face done and just don&#39;t think I can deal with getting it done down below for three reasons: Cost, Pain, EXTREME dysphoria about my genitals.

That is expensive.  And I&#39;m definitely not looking forward to the pain.  Thinking worse than just under the nose and that sucked.  Dysphoria on the other hand, while it totally sucks, after so many hours with my electrologist I&#39;ve decided I just have to accept where I am to get where I want to be.

No, they do it with cauterizing on the prep table where they prep the ski flaps

Thank you for responding back. Mayo may be on my list of hope then.

The hospital is an experience by itself. an entire floor seems to be dedicated to LGBTQI+  patients, and the nursing staff is rather young and seems to be specifically trained to deal with people like us.  They all have the LBGBTQI+ flag pins on their name tags.
<br>
You have a single bed room there, and all meals are ordered a la card  everyday, and are delivered to your bed about 45 minutes after ordering.  It almost felt to me like a nice hotel, and not like a hospital.  Because of some bowl movement problems, I stayed there for 7 days, they normally let you go after 4 to 5 days. I can recommend the Mayo fully.
</p>
<p>
And my neo female parts look like those of most natal women, the surgeon did a very fine job, there, too.

I am not a very hairy person, and I was told to not touch any hair.  They remove hair that needs to be gone with cauterization when they prep the skin flap on the prepping table, and they wanted the other hair to cover the scars that are caused from the creation of the pelvic mount.  It seems that this pelvic mount creation is a special of the Mayo  that makes the bottom to look even more female.  My pubic hair is growing back nicely and starts to cover the scars well.  I cannot see or feel any trace of hair growth on the labia minora or in the vaginal canal.

This is awesome to hear, im on the waiting list and still waiting to see the plastics team. I changed doctors over to mayo almost a year ago and they have treated me so much better than my previous doctors in texas.

Who are you seeing currently at the Mayo.  I used to work in research with the Mayo, and i liked it so much, I became a patient there, that was about 30 years ago.
</p>
<p>
I am a medical doctor myself, and hardly trust any of my peers as well as I trust the docs at the Mayo!

I think they are the best.  Over the years I dabbled around with different endos, and most of them knew less than I did (I am a medical doctor myself, but not an endo).  I feel well provided for my needs at the Mayo

Congrats! Glad it went well for you.   I have a question - did you need to pay for this totally out of pocket or do you have insurance that covered/helped cover the cost of this?  I am 32 and just recently coming to terms with possibly being trans and I&#39;m a little terrified that these surgeries might not be covered... :/

I am a little older lady, who did not want to have GRS  initially.  I had an orchi many years ago, and thought that was enough for me.  But anyway, I have Medicare, and did an extra insurance a so called plan F from Humana, and I have not seen a single bill yet,  I think you have to search around for the proper insurance, the plan F thing works with Medicare only.  I hired an insurance broker to find this for me, you might want to contact a broker, too.  You do not pay the broker, the insurance will, it is similar to a realtor.

I have Medicare and a supplemental plan F, and they seemed to have paid everything.   At least I have not seen any billing yet, and at about 6 weeks later, I think I would have been billed.
