I’m sorry what?! That’s an option! Holy shit! That is really encouraging to me as a trans woman without dysphoria from my penis.

This is EXACTLY why I want to be more open and share my experiences and results. There are so many people who want this but didn&#39;t know it was even an option! There&#39;s nothing that says you can&#39;t have a vagina and a dick. If you&#39;re not dysphoric about your penis but also really want a vagina, why not both?

Like idk, it’s doing something weird for my brain and I like it.  I have some fucked up attachment to taking something away for my own mental well being. That’s tied to some sense of everyone hates their body why do I think I can be the exception. Yet I soooo am willing to if that’s what a vaginoasty means. Or at the least, it lets me feel like I don’t need to think about it rn

I am so very glad you did, I have been thinking about a phallo preserving vaginoplasty and it is nice to actually see what one looks like.

In a purely joking context,  I&#39;m pretty sure why some of us shouldn&#39;t have both 😅 including a friend of mine 😅.
</p>
<p>
Very impressive and everything looks nice and in order really neat.
<br>
Hope you hurry up and get fully recovered so you get to enjoy the full potential.

Hahaha you just caused a lot of daydreaming to take place 🤣

How does it feel inside your vagina now after 7 months of this post? Does it still hurt? Is there any pleasure?

The pain is thankfully gone and I&#39;ve had penetrative sex a few times. I&#39;m still incredibly tight and I&#39;m still dilating pretty aggressively to help with that but overall, I&#39;m doing rather well!

That subreddit has improved greatly in the past year, but there was a time when rampant discrimination was taking place there against anyone who preferred the title hermaphrodite over salmacian. They claimed it was invalidating of intersex people. No one was calling them herms! I knew enough to know.they didn&#39;t like it, so I didn&#39;t do it.in fact no one did. But it pushed a lot of us trans women out of that subreddit because of a single word choice.

That is a very specific issue which I do not feel qualified to comment on. I&#39;m glad most of the tension around it seems to have dissipated, though. ^^&#39;

Yes it is. We&#39;re all fighting for this (and coverage for it all over north america right now). Check out
<a href="/r/salmacian" rel="nofollow">r/salmacian</a>
for all the details. I&#39;m currently in court over funding for it actually in Ontario.  Most people who have achieved this with coverage were in the USA so far though.

!!!!!! Fellow wishful transfem for Canada here. I&#39;m currently doing research to potentially go to court over having this covered in Quebec. I&#39;d love to discuss your process. Can we talk ?

I like to think of the butthole as a vagina, but just with less...everything lol. Its so close to the but which already gives incredible pleasure from the prostate so thats a tough call.
</p>
<p>
I would&#39;ve thought the anus would be used instead, since there&#39;s already an opening and the prostate acts similar to a woman&#39;s G spot. Is there another procedure where thats done?

Some of these comments are wack, that looks great, though, and may be my choice also. I have wanted bottom surgery forever, but over time have gotten pretty comfortable with my current genitals but still want to be penetrated other than anal. So this option is looking better and better to me! And I am sure others.

That&#39;s amazing! I have so many questions! I&#39;m planning to have a similar procedure, but they&#39;ll be using a piece of colon tissue for the canal. Not sound weird, but how do your clothes fit after? Lol, I know it sounds like a bizarre question, but it&#39;s one I&#39;ve pondered alot lol. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy with your results thus far!

It&#39;s not weird at all. I love the way clothing fits after the procedure. I do a technique I like to call the &#34;forbidden tuck&#34; where I basically put myself in myself and then throw on a pair of panties and we&#39;re good to go. No need for tight garments, no gaffs, just a little reposition and we&#39;re ready to go. It even works for bathing suits!

That is awesome. I am still not sure what I want but the bulge is a huge reason for wanting bottom surgery.

I have a disability that includes incontinence and altered sensation, and I was very concerned how I would manage if I had a typical gender reaffirming surgery giving me a clitoris and vagina. I was nervous about additional loss of sensation, possibly leaving me with no orgasms and also managing my lack of control over my urine. But the idea of keeping my clitoris fully intact while having a vagina would be amazing! Will look more into this :-) I feel like I have hope, so thank you for posting!!!!

Good news is, Phallo without vaginectomy is arguably the more established procedure to reach a
<a href="/r/salmacian">r/salmacian</a>
setup (unless you also want urethral lengthening, then you&#39;re looking at a similarly small pool of surgeons due to the complication rate scaring off many).

Without getting too graphic, they basically turn the skin of my scrotum into a kind of chain link fence that allows it to stretch further and cover more area. They then carve out the area where my vaginal canal will go and push the empty scrotal skin in and secure it with packing and sutures. The way Dr Gurjala does it, it also drastically improves the chances of the graft to take and not be rejected. The downside to this technique is that granulation is much more common and extensive.

Oh, dip‽ only $1500 with BCBS? I&#39;ve got their highest tier but was still worried about cost...

I&#39;m going to ask a few questions, if you don&#39;t mind...
</p>
<p>
Was there any push back from insurance to cover it? How long was the wait?

If there WAS push back, Align handled it because it never got to me. I never got any shit from my insurance, though I did have an issue with the anesthesiologist who filed the claim incorrectly to insurance and then said it was denied.
</p>
<p>
I volunteered to wait quite some time. I could have had my procedure done in a few months if I wanted to but I promised that I would wait two years from starting hrt to get any major procedures so I set the date at about 8 months out. This ended up working for me in more ways than I anticipated because the electrolysis was such a time-consuming process.

Yes, I did. You don&#39;t need to get it done on the shaft but you still gotta clear the perineum and scrotum and anywhere they may need donor skin from.

Perhaps this is immature but I can only imagine the secret &#34;handshake&#34;/greeting to be like a genital-only 69. Wherein both participants put their phallus in the other&#39;s canal simultaneously and do a little wiggle together. 🤭

Thank you SO SO much for sharing this, I can&#39;t possibly express how validating and reassuring this is.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been struggling to find healed pictures of this procedure; what I saw previously was making me quite hesitant. But this is a beautiful result and confirms that this is not only possibly but desirable !! &lt;3
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been wanting this surgery for years now but it&#39;s not offered in Canada (I did get a free orchiectomy though, 2 years ago).
</p>
<p>
May I ask, did you still have testicles before the surgery ?
<br>
I&#39;m wondering if lost elasticity in my scrotum might interere with the process.

I had an orchiectomy 6 months prior to my vaginoplasty but I didn&#39;t have any scrotal skin removed. I was on a low dose testosterone gel which I applied to my groin once a week to maintain function and I also made sure to actively stretch my scrotum manually to ensure it stayed soft and elastic for my bottom surgery. I can&#39;t say if those steps were mandatory or even effective, it&#39;s just what I did because I was super paranoid about losing elasticity.

This is life changing information to know that it&#39;s even an option! Forgive me for any ignorance, but I have some questions, of course!
</p>
<p>
1st) Do you have a gspot? If so, how&#39;s that done? Is it in the normal spot?
</p>
<p>
2nd) Is it possible to still manage a clit in there? I feel like i5d be impossible considering the common method for making a clit in a vaginoplasty. But, if I could, I&#39;d REALLY wanna be able to.
</p>
<p>
3rd) Can you ejaculate from penetration? Or are those separate pleasure centers or something?
</p>
<p>
4) I&#39;m very curious how the forbidden tuck is. Have you been able to tuck it like that with an erection?
</p>
<p>
5) Does the sensation of having it tucked in there cause accidental pleasure throughout the day? I imagine the first time was a WOAH moment fs. But every time after that was just meh.
</p>
<p>
6) If you decide afterwards not to preserve the phallus, can you opt to having it removed for a clit?
</p>

1: The g spot is basically just my prostate and it is definitely there.
</p>
<p>
2: You might be able to craft something that looks like a clit but it wouldn&#39;t function as one because all the nerves they would have used for the clit are still in my penis.
</p>
<p>
3: Cumming from penetration is just a prostate orgasm so I tend to just ooze a lot of precum from it.
</p>
<p>
4: If I&#39;m partially hard, I can outright fuck myself. It&#39;s basically just a creative form of masturbation.
</p>
<p>
5: It still feels nice to have myself in my warm lips while walking around but I don&#39;t really get many spontaneous erections anymore.
</p>
<p>
6: You could but I certainly wouldn&#39;t recommend it. These are major surgeries with lots of risks of complications and down time. Ultimately, you want to do as few as possible to minimize the trauma to your groin and yourself. Bodies aren&#39;t made of clay, after all. You have to be mindful of your physical limitations. If you&#39;re on the fence about a phallus-preserving vaginoplasty or a typical vaginoplasty, I recommend you take more time to really think it over. The last thing you want to do is go into a PPV with the idea that it&#39;s a safe compromise to what you really want (If A doesn&#39;t work, I still have B). No matter what bottom surgery you get, you have to be committed or you will not do well in the recovery and then you&#39;ll be in even greater danger of making things way worse.

I love the way it looks. I wish it would heal faster. At the moment, I&#39;m frustrated about the extensive granulation. Once the pain and discomfort fades, I&#39;ll be very happy.

Is this procedure possible if you want to completely preserve the scrotum and testes? Do you feel any prostate stimulation through the front? Do you still crave receptive anal the same way? Approximately how long before you can really use the new bits? How deep does it go? Tytytytytytytytytytyty.

Thank you so much for sharing your experience! The results look amazing. I’ve been seriously thinking about this kind of surgery as I don’t experience penile dysphoria. May I ask what depth did the doctor achieve with that technique and how are you feeling close to 8 months after the surgery.

A bit late, but congrats! You look great. Sorry to hear about the granulation. I hope that&#39;s clearing over time.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s so good to see more folks able to get access to this surgery now. There isn&#39;t an official count anywhere I am aware of but I was last told there were already dozens from one surgeon alone.
</p>
<p>
5 years ago when I first posted here about my surgery, I didn&#39;t fully know the impact of would have on so many folks.

You really were one of the pioneers! Earliest I ever heard about somebody getting the phallus-preserving vaginoplasty must have been around 2016 so that procedure was still brand new when you got it. From what I&#39;ve counted based on the number of surgeons offering it and their yearly average, there&#39;s probably still less than 100 of us post-op at the moment. I really hope it continues to grow in popularity as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re more than aware of just how many people who want it themselves as soon as they learn it can be done.

Far as we are aware, I was the 2nd person, and that was back in 2018. I was the first to post about my experience. Back then I had to leave out some details that could be used to identify me, but it was enough to get the word out.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been quite a ride watching the original info I posted back then slowly spreading, and the number of surgeons offering it increasing as more folks started asking for it. We&#39;re up to more than 10 confirmed surgeons across multiple states, and rising!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad more folks are starting to post their experiences. There&#39;s still a lot more work to be done to spread info though, people need to be more fully informed of what their options are with bottom surgery, that it&#39;s not just orchi or vaginoplasty.

I mean, it goes both ways. If you ever wanted a phalloplasty, just ask for them to not remove the vagina in the process. It actually makes the recovery a lot easier and a lot of doctors are willing to do it if you ask.

Yeah I just don’t really know if I’d heal great. I have had past surgeries unrelated to being trans and the scar tissue is like very painful to the touch years later and also money ya know lol But maybe I’ll do it one day !

I saw you mentioned having an orchi prior to the vaginoplasty. I&#39;m a bit intimidated by the recovery for either phallus preserving and conventional vaginoplasties so I was considering getting an orchi to alleviate some dysphoria until I&#39;m properly prepared for the more intense recovery.
</p>
<p>
Getting info on PPV is a bit difficult so maybe asking about your experience is worthwhile. Given that your surgeon used the scrotum for your vagina did getting the orchi prior cause any complications? Did your surgeon express any concerns about getting it prior to your vaginoplasty?

Well, for starters, I made sure my orchi surgeon was made fully aware to not remove any scrotal skin. I was going to need it later, after all. Also, once the incision was healed, I made it a habit of stretching that skin out to ensure it didn&#39;t atrophy or lose its elasticity. I guess these practices worked out for me in the end because we were able to create the entire canal with scrotum alone.

I&#39;ve always heard bad things about mesh, and personally know some people that had really bad complications with mesh after 2 years.
</p>
<p>
What are the surgeons doing now to not make this an issue any more ?

<p>
Like this is stunning

I would have to attribute my success to the skills and techniques of Dr Gurjala. He&#39;s made several amazing innovations in skin grafting techniques and has done hundreds of vaginoplasties using that technique and has never had a graft rejection. I&#39;m unsure of what kinds of complications that can happen later on down the road but in my personal experience, the primary difficulties have been extensive granulation which seems to occur a lot in this technique. He also only used the mesh internally. All the external anatomy was more or less left as-is, with just a couple incisions and laparoscopic punctures. All the granulation has only been internal so that tracks.

This is great! I knew this was an option but I have never seen results. I’ve struggled with vaginoplasty because I enjoy my clit but really want a vulva and vagina. Seeing such good results, visualizing what that surgery would be, it makes me feel good to know this is an option! Thank you for sharing!

I&#39;ve got about 4.5 inches of depth with my dilators. I may get a revision in about a year, depending on how dilating continues after we get the granulation under control.

What would the revision give you? Would it be peritoneal for a second, deeper section of canal/pocket? And if so, how many more inches? Or like total inches? Thank you for the reply!!

The revision would give me greater depth and diameter. They would either re-mesh my internal skin or take a small skin graft from the groin crease to lengthen the canal. The biggest limitation, however, isn&#39;t the elasticity of the skin. The limitation is the internal scar tissue and bone.

Do you have more pictures? I find it hard to understand what exactly I am looking at. Like, are there Labia here? I am confused.
</p>
<p>
But if thats too personal/pornographic, or anything, it&#39;s fine.
</p>
<p>
Also, do you have lubrication, and was the prostate moved?

I have many more pictures on my Twitter but those are much too pornographic for this sub so I&#39;ll refrain from posting them.
</p>
<p>
I have to manually lubricate my vagina. I typically use KY Jelly for dilating and various water-based lubes for other applications. I&#39;m trying to avoid silicone or oil-based lubes just because of how annoying it is to clean those out after.

I just can&#39;t get over the fact that dilation is forever for the most part &amp; it&#39;s painful. Pain and maintenance are insurmountable cons for me.

I mean, it&#39;s not painful forever. Once the incisions heal up and the granulation goes away, it&#39;s only uncomfortable. It&#39;s just a chore you gotta do from time to time. I usually just lay back in bed and watch youtube videos for the duration. After about a year, it&#39;s something you do only once a week and that&#39;s the schedule for the rest of your life.

Night and day difference. I can literally tuck my cock into my pussy and with a simple pair of panties or a swim suit, nobody is the wiser. I call it the &#34;forbidden tuck&#34;.

Thank you for taking the time to answer, I also wanted to know how hard/painful is it to dilate for you and how often do you do that for this type of surgery? And how deep did they make it for you if I may ask?

I&#39;ve had a complication called granulation that makes dilating much more painful than usual. When it&#39;s cleared up, dilating isn&#39;t really painful as much as it is uncomfortable. For the first three months, you dilate 3 times a day. From 3-6, it&#39;s twice a day, 6-9 is once a day, 9-12 is a couple times a week and after a year, you only dilate once a week. Mine is about 4-4.5&#34; deep, depending on the day.

Not only is it possible, it&#39;s also readily available. Lots of doctors who do phalloplasties will leave the vagina in-tact if you just ask them to.

Yeah, no matter which direction you&#39;re going, the recovery is nothing to take lightly. It&#39;s a very serious decision but at the same time, every year you wait is a year of your life you won&#39;t have it. It&#39;s an incredibly hard thing to do, yes, but sooooooo cool once it&#39;s done.

Oh yeah definitely! I love the thought of the results once everything is done and healed, but everything leading up to that point is so much. It&#39;s something I&#39;ll have to think over a lot. Seeing other people with similar configurations to what I want is encouraging, even if it&#39;s from the opposite direction. I have a consultation for a hysterectomy tomorrow, so I&#39;ll worry about that first though. I don&#39;t think I have it in me to deal with all the planning and the bureaucracy for two different surgeries at once!

So damned jealous of this entire setup right now. as much as I want a clit instead of a penis I think this setup is better than the full op. So many questions and so much envy

Where does one start if this is what they&#39;d like to have done? I&#39;m a total noob to bottom surgery and have no idea how any of it works.

You find a surgeon that offers this procedure and you ask for a consultation. I went to Align Surgical in San Francisco and they listed the procedure on their website.

I didn&#39;t know that one was even an option! From the wording though I can&#39;t tell if there&#39;s a hole there or if it&#39;s more like a muffing thing?

There is definitely a hole there. Granulation has been a bit rough though so penetration has been pretty uncomfortable lately. I&#39;m seeing a doctor about that next week for another round of silver nitrate treatments.

So, no peritoneal tissue was used in this procedure? Do you self-lubricate? Sorry if this is too personal, I’m just curious. I’m leaning towards this surgery as well.

No peritoneal tissue was used in this procedure. In that sense, the canal is similar to an inversion. I need to manually lubricate but I have touch sensation inside the canal.

I got an orchi 6 months prior to bottom surgery. I had originally planned to do it all at the same time but I had some complications that put my testicles in an incredible amount of pain and I just couldn&#39;t wait so I had them out early.

Are you able to penetrate with your penis?
</p>
<p>
How much erectile tissue was removed?
</p>
<p>
I kind of want this, but I’m so torn. So much of me wants a typical looking vulva, but my penis is adorable and I definitely don’t hate it all the time.

I am able to penetrate with my penis. No penile tissue was removed at all. The canal was made purely with scrotum skin. The only change I noticed was with how tight my skin was pulled down after the procedure and with the changes to the structure just beneath the penis, my penis now points a little downward when erect instead of upward.

Wow, no erectile tissue was removed? I didn’t know you’d have enough room for a vaginal canal with it all still there. That’s interesting.

I’m pretty a sure I was vagina preserving meta/phallo which is essentially the opposite surgery but we would have the same set of genitals which is actually kind of neat when you think about it

I think may have I seen your results earlier in the year on Align’s website. I’ve been searching the internet religiously to try to find nonbinary bottom surgery pictures. I’m ftn so I’d be getting the opposite procedure lol but you look absolutely amazing, I’m incredibly jealous!! I’m so sorry you’ve had so much discomfort so far, it sucks that having the bodies we want usually come with even more risks, more surgeons really need to offer these procedures so we can all live our salmacian dreams😩

Thanks so much for posting this.  I am a couple of months out from a consultation with Dugi/Dy at OHSU to talk about phallus-preserving with PPT.    I may opt for a &#34;traditional&#34; vaginoplasty, depending on what they think they can do with what I have to work with,  but this is what I want most.

So do you want it to work and have you already looked into what usually affects function?
</p>
<p>
With a decent number of transfem people being non-op, it&#39;s actually a pretty common topic and might be an easy fix for you too, like a slight adjustment in dosages to leave you with that little bit more T it needs or even just adding some cialis.

Tried everything - eventually, the eicial professionals said there was nothing they could do since they could find nothing wrong. Family GP and long-time good friend took me aside and told me the problem was in my head.
<br>
Mind you, he is also a fully licensed and accredited Doctor of Physiology . It was a very long time in my past and well before my shell showed any signs of fracture.
</p>
<p>
Only now - finaly do I get it.
</p>
<p>
Would I be upset if it responded to stimulus even marginally; I don&#39;t think so. The idea has its merits.

I admit, I&#39;m a salmacian, but I don&#39;t go to that subreddit anymore because of how they disrespected me and didn&#39;t care that they were discriminating against those of us who prefer going by the title of hermaphrodite. I just wish the surgery results were more... Natural I guess? Yours looks amazing! I know I&#39;m supposed to have both down there, but none of the surgery options I have available to me match how I want to look. I am a woman through and through.
</p>
<p>
I dunno, my story is confusing af. I&#39;m happy to see more salmacian surgery results and happy more people know about us.

It&#39;s complicated. While some of us
<em>
do
</em>
use the term and rather dislike it being called a slur, the polite thing to do is to of course only use it on someone else
<em>
after
</em>
that person has indicated they want you to.

Doing a quick look at OPs profile description and it’s probably safe to say she is okay with it. The only reason I used the term was I checked that first

I am also one of those people who rather like the term being used towards myself so that’s why I was confused anyone would say it’s rude.

A word of caution, not everyone who has my arrangement likes being called a futa. Salmacian or Bigenital are generally the preferred terms. Some people like Altersex, though I don&#39;t care for the term myself. That said, I self-identify as a Futa so I take no offense.

I didn&#39;t mean it as an offense, it was the first thing that corossed my mind after seing a woman with a penis and a vagina, that&#39;s what i know about futanari, it&#39;s different from an intersex person.
