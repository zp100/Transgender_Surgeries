I&#39;m not a doctor, but going by my experience in recovery, that looks like it may be granulation or a tiny bit of excess skin tissue along a suture line.

No clue I don’t think it’s hypergranulation like someone else mentioned since it’s normally way more red.
</p>
<p>
Not sure where you had your surgery but that looks like what grs Montreal does sometime. Because of the way they do it. I think they think it looks feminine.
</p>
<p>
If you went there. That’s probably what it is. I have tons of little weird things like on mine and I went there.
</p>
<p>
I wish I could tell you it goes away but mine didn’t.
</p>
<p>
Maybe talk to your surgeon and ask him what it is.
</p>
<p>
Is u did went to Montreal you’ll Probably get” act like nothing is wrong or a deer looking at headlight” treatment.
</p>
<p>
Hope you have better luck than me with your surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Sorry girl :( I feel you

I had my grs in Bangkok, Dr kamol. It doesn&#39;t hurt or bother me at all. Dr kamol Just answered when did i notice, i said it&#39;s the first time i checked &#34;in there&#34; and noticed them. He said just to keep watching them so i honestly have no clue... But what actually is the granulation girls talking about?how does it look and feel normally?

It’s some reddish shinning strawberry like bubbly thing.
</p>
<p>
Looks a little like what you have the colour is not right. And it keeps getting worst if you don’t take of it. So I don’t think that’s what it is because you would have to deal with it via silver nitrate or continuous care.
</p>
<p>
How was your experience over all at Kamol hospital btw? Like surgery, people, result. Other than that haha:).
</p>
<p>
Last, you can still Google hypergranulation tissue if you are worried it might be that. But I think your surgeon would have been able to click on it right away if it was.
</p>
<p>
Hope you’ll heal alright and manage this:)

If it’s hyper granulation yes, but I’m not sure it is.
</p>
<p>
Your doctor uses a a little stick that looks like long matches. Put water on the tip of it and apply it to the region affected.
</p>
<p>
Tho like I said I’m sure that’s what it is. And I don’t think any doctor would do it if they are not sure.
</p>
<p>
Have you reached out to your surgeon to confirm that’s what it was?
</p>
<p>
If so and it is. Most clinic should be able to do it.

Granulation tissue. I&#39;ve got some too, so common in GRS I&#39;d personally consider it more of a &#34;side effect&#34; than a complications.
</p>
<p>
Silver Nitrate is the typical treatment.  I&#39;m headed to my surgeon in just a week for that actually.
