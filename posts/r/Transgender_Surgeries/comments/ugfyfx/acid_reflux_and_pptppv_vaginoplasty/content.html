Does anyone know if in general, is acid reflux is a disqualifying condition for ppt/ppv/hybrid vaginoplasty? I have this  and it is controlled, but I&#39;m hoping it won&#39;t be an issue in being approved for the procedure. I can&#39;t seem to find anything online about it, so I&#39;m posting to here incase others have a similar question.

I put it on my intake form for my surgeon and nobody said anything.  They know I&#39;m on Omeprazole for it too.
</p>
<p>
So, I&#39;d think there&#39;s no issue.

It really shouldn’t be. I have acid reflux and got peritoneal flap vaginoplasty without any issues. Your stomach and peritonaeum are different things. Maybe if you’ve had abdominal surgery for reflux, the adhesions caused by it could make another surgery entering through the abdominal cavity more challenging, but you could probably find a doctor willing to do it. Usually it takes several abdominal surgeries before surgeons will reject you because of the risk adhesions pose.

Thanks everyone. I was definitely doing some mental gymnastics trying to think of how this would disqualify me, but looks like it will be a non-issue.
