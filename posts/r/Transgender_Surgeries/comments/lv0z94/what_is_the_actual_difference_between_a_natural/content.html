This isn’t a rhetorical question. I’m curious what features make someone look more natural vs more glam?
</p>
<p>
I’m currently comparing three surgeons: Deschamps-Braly, Lee, and Rofles. I think I’m between DB and Lee.
</p>
<p>
I really liked DB but his results are supposedly natural, and I’ll admit when we were doing the modeling on the computer they definitely made me look feminine but not necessarily like a doll. Dr Lee supposedly is very good at making people look like dolls and my question is what features does he give people that make them look more doll-ish?
</p>
<p>
If I like DB more and it’s just a simple matter of having a slightly more pulled up forehead or a smaller nose I would think I could ask him to do that within the constraints of what is possible with my faces skin/bone structure of course.

I think often the difference between glam and natural is like how far outside typical parameters something is pushed. For instance, say with lips, lips that are bigger past a certain point are often perceived as &#34;done&#34;, however, if you increase their size less they&#39;ll look more plump but plausibly natural.
</p>
<p>
As for DB I went to him and I believe he&#39;s receptive to feedback. You can see my results by him

Thank you and you look amazing!
</p>
<p>
I think I like DB more but I do want some of the more characteristic “glam” features like a cute nose and v like chin and jaw. I don’t want my cheeks touched though. I think im still leaning towards him and will take pictures to show him and see what he thinks. We already discussed hairlines since I have a weird situation where my hairline is already at the correct spot and he’ll either need to lower it or raise it depending on where he does his incision. He seemed open to doing whatever I liked with that. He told me what is classically beautiful but if I liked the idea of having a bigger forehead so you see more of the tilt of the head that was an option.

Yeah I mean with any of these folks making sure you communicate with them what you want is key. Fwiw I really enjoy my nose from deschamps-braly and think it&#39;s one of my strongest new features.

Yeah his jaw work seemed very good.  That being said I’ve noticed a lot of his patients end up with... a weird bubble chin? It’s like tilted upward and protrudes more than I would think is proper. Similar to this picture:

</p>
<p>
It’s like too much IMO but I can’t tell if that is because of the swelling. Either way I don’t want to have a chin like that.

At the moment I just don&#39;t have the means to be able to support a loan that large if I plan on paying it off anytime soon. Unfortunately this surgery is quite expensive so it&#39;s safer to save up rather than try to finance it, though I want to badly to schedule the surgery tomorrow! If I had the means I&#39;d have had the surgery already.

Gl to you! Let me know which doctor you end up going with. I just don’t know for sure I’d be able to pay it off within a short timeframe like that.

Throw in my 2 cents here - I think what you are describing is that &#34;LA influencer&#34; look - and I agree that Dr. Lee is
<em>
really
</em>
good at giving trans femme patients that outcome. The features I associate with that are a really refined nose, high plump cheeks (usually fillers or maybe cheek implants) and a really defined v-line jaw, again maybe helped by filler, osteotomy work or botox in/on the masseter muscles.
</p>
<p>
I honestly don&#39;t know of any reason
<em>
why
</em>
you couldn&#39;t achieve that look with DB, just that he tends
<em>
not
</em>
to emphasize those things and I think probably his patients maybe generally have a preference away from those things.

I’ll agree with that. I guess I want to look somewhere between “natural” and a Snapchat filter. I think I need to look at the features or people who I find beautiful and figure out what it is exactly I’m hoping for an communicate that to dr DB to see if he feels he can accomplish those goals.

I guess... hmm, I am navigating these waters myself and I just want to reiterate that it&#39;s
<em>
very difficult
</em>
to tell if the way someone&#39;s face looks in a particular image is because of actual facial surgery, filler, botox, or FaceTuning/photoshop/filters.

Lee&#39;s visual signature are his quite noticeable cheek implants, so give that some thought.
</p>
<p>
My ex-partner got them, developed a lisp, and acquired what I would call an unnatural appearance afterwards. However, the somewhat radical change suited her acute dysphoria because she, of course, wanted to look like anyone
<em>
except
</em>
her &#34;natural&#34; self.
</p>
<p>
FWIW, she had Kleinfelter Syndrome and was already quite feminine and beautiful before FFS.

I’m so sorry for her :( I hope she was able to work around those?
</p>
<p>
When I was having my consult with him he didn’t want to do anything with my cheeks so I’m not really worried about that. I think he may just be more accustomed to giving a really tight pull back on the forehead for a cateye look.
</p>
<p>
Plus he was willi by to hide the incision behind my hairline except for at the temples since I didn’t need my natural hairline in the middle of my face changed. Dr DB said he couldn’t do that.

To me glam is: high cheekbones and eyebrow, a curvy and narrow nose bridge, V shaped jaw and plum lips. 99% of women don’t have it naturally either. And also the overall shape of the face (oval is preferred). That requires a very skilled surgeon to figure out the proportions, chances are that it would go wrong and so over the top!

know of any surgeon that understand proportions well and are good at what you&#39;re referring to? i really care about the golden ratio or just things being very proportionate. external beauty really is just math and proportions for the most part.

You need more soft tissue docs for something like that, to me, it is as important as bone work because it truly does glamorize your face by not just being passing cis female natural look.

Thanks for making this post. This is something I&#39;ve been wondering about and already has helped me realize I need to do so much more research!

Oh I didn’t know.
</p>
<p>
I liked him but he did recommend some things that sort of concerned me. He reveme see lío lift and check fat injections which both Lee and DB said I didn’t need.

That&#39;s not my experience in the slightest (and yes, different surgeons will have different opinions about which procedures should be done -
<em>
that&#39;s why you get second opinions
</em>
). While a couple of patients do have experiences with him that are concerning, that shouldn&#39;t be allowed to override the experiences of the patients who didn&#39;t, but rather, considered alongside those experiences to get the overall picture of the surgeon in question, because the idea that a surgeon should be judged only by his worst results is as frankly silly as the converse.
</p>
<p>
I have posted a few before-and-afters in here, and so have other Rolfes patients. I don&#39;t think that my face has a whole lot of specifics in common with most other Rolfes patients, other than that we&#39;re all a LOT happier with our faces after his work than before.

I’m so sorry:( I hope you can get a revision to correct your issues?
</p>
<p>
The weird thing is his cost was just about half what DB or Lee charged. I mean if he were truly money hungry I’d think he’d just start charging more rather than trying to do unnecessary work.

Just because he charges less for his mediocre skills (as he should) doesn&#39;t make him any less money hungry. Especially when offering more things for u to pay for u do not need. Db and lee change lives. He destroys them.

Lol. One girl won’t post her supposed “botch” or even what surgeries she had; the other he supposedly “botched” just needs a few revisions to her jaw and nose. Common of most ffs surgeons. I know plenty of girls that have seeked revision rhinos after Lee, DB, Keojampa, mardirrosian, etc. I consider Rolfes a teir 2.5 surgeon with Toby Mayer. Db, Lee and Keo being the best at teir 1. Then you have Rodman, mardirrosian, Jumaily at teir 2. Rolfe is a good value surgeon. Though if I was out of pocket id probably go to Jumaily his forehead and rhino work are great and Jumaily can provide Sliding T. Rolfes gets a lot of bang for your buck so if I couldn’t afford Jumaily I’d go Rolfes. I’m going through Insurance so ultimately I’m scheduled for DB

Also cheeks are big in a glam look in my opinion  but I think cheek isn&#39;t as big a deal to people but it can make a huge difference. Glam reminds me of a gorgeous cheek and jaw

So naturql is just taking away masculinity, glam is adding femininity. So natural is a lip lift. Glam is a lip lift with fat in the lips, a nose job for feminization vs asking for a specific nose. Fitting jaw and chin vs asking for like a v line. Etc .

I’m still a bit confused but I think you’re saying is glam has specific features whereas natural is just any more feminizing feature.

I mean that has always been my read on glam vs natural as far as surgery goes.. Natural is erasing masculinity and glam is going a little harder for not just feminization, but to make one prettier or glamorous.
