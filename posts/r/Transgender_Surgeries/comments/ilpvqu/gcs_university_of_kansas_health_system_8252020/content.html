I had my surgery with Dr. Gray on July 21st and so far I&#39;m very happy with the results. I had a slight complication with tearing on week 2. Also, I had one bad nurse experience, turned out she was on loan from another ward. My favorite nurses were Brie and Brittney, so awesome! My bad nurse experience was over the period that I was suppose to get to walk for the first time, she was reluctant to let me out of bed. But when Brittney came in later, she got me doing laps. On my last day I had an issue ordering lunch, they had some computer glitch, I really like how Dr. Gray got the cafeteria manager involved to get me food. I was eating just fine that very night after surgery, I&#39;m even surprised how well my body did, despite the fact that I fainted on night two.

If you&#39;re at all interested, I&#39;ve been sharing my experience on my YouTube channel:

P.S. As you heal you&#39;ll find the stitches are very irritating, don&#39;t be afraid to ask then to trim them up at your checkups.

<p>
P.S.S. (If you are local) Make sure they get you scheduled for pelvic floor therapy before the month is over. Trisha told me they really under utilize her during the recovery.

Feel she to DM me so we can talk in detail. I&#39;ve learned a lot of tips and tricks now that I&#39;m six weeks post-op.

Iâ€™m in Wichita, they already have me scheduled at the 4 week mark :)

Definitely know what you mean. Stitch on my left labia and one on my perineum being annoying.
