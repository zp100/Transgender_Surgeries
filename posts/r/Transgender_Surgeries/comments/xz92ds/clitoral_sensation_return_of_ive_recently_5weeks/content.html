Clitoral sensation - return ofâ€¦? Iâ€™ve recently (5weeks ago) had ppv and labiaplasty. I donâ€™t really have a lot of feeling down there at the moment. I understand everyone is different but when is it likely that sensation will return (especially in my clitoris)? ðŸ˜œ

Give it time, cross your fingers and hope for the best.  Nerves can take a long time to recover.  Its one of the reasons that some gals won&#39;t get their sensation fully back and normalized for a year-two.  While some lucky sprites will be near fully functioning after a month.  Everyone heals at different rates and recovers differently.  Hugs!

It seems to be very variable. Mine&#39;s only started getting full-on sensitive during the past week and I had my surgery on June 30th

Did your clit feel numbish for awhile? I had a labiaplasty 5 weeks ago and mine is kinda numb like hardly any sensation

Yes, very much so. To the point where I was having to joke about having left my clit behind at the hospital by mistake to stop myself quietly panicking
</p>
<p>
But things are great with it now. It took quite a while for me to develop full sensation (12 weeks, at a guess?), but it&#39;s finally there

hey i also have a question regarding that. how does your clit exactly feel numb because mine doesnt fell completely numb but it rather hurts a little bit or just feels like a little bone or something or a button. but my surgery is just 8 weeks ago and here my surgeon meant it rather takes 6 months... just scared i will like feel it but it wont give me the same sexual pleasure i had. thanks&#34;

Like I can feel it but not very much sensation,  I can still orgasm if I mess with it for a good minute but nothing like before mines also kinda sore feeling. But I think we still have a good amount of time still for the sensation to come back.

I really hope this happens for me but my surgery was 15.5 weeks ago and I still don&#39;t have any sensation. Think I might be one of the unlucky ones :(
