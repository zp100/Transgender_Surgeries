This post is a continuation of my experiences with a peritoneal pull-through vaginoplasty from Dr. Heidi Wittenberg March 9th 2021.  My part 1 post exceeded the max post length so I&#39;m starting part 2.

The scabs along labia majora are finally starting to fall off significantly.  The scabs above clit hood are a bit smaller.  I was feeling the scabs in the shower and I think there are big sutures beneath that must just keep irritating.  It didn&#39;t really hurt to touch, oddly.  I can touch most places now without much pain.
</p>
<p>
I discovered that if I stand up and squat, the labia minora spread pretty wide.  I guess gravity helps pull labia majora apart while standing but when I lay on my back they flatten and keep the slit closed.  So I was able to take photos of the inside while standing:
</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure why my clit seems to have a cauliflower texture instead of the more glossy surface I&#39;ve seen in some other results.  Maybe swelling?  But I&#39;m happy it isn&#39;t obviously surrounded by scabs and yeast and it looks reasonably healthy.  It&#39;s probably on the large side of average but I think that&#39;s alright.  At the orientation for my former insurance company they said they make clits large by default because you can make them smaller later but you can never make them larger.  Maybe Dr. Wittenberg is moving to the same philosophy?  This is at least twice the size of another result I&#39;ve seen from Dr. Wittenberg 9 months earlier.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m pretty happy with the internal look overall.  The vaginal canal is more red than I&#39;d like but I think it&#39;s still healing.  The pic was taken 3 days ago and the little yellow blobs at the bottom seem to have disappeared in today&#39;s photo.
</p>
<p>
Dilation remains slow and tight.  The first inch has gotten a bit easier and less painful but I think it&#39;s only easier because I&#39;m using better technique and know what direction to push.  It does feel like the muscles are less sensitive to being pushed past, though.  The last inch or two remains just as difficult and I think I hurt myself shortly before I took the internal pics by pushing too hard to try to reach my original depth.  After pushing so hard I was bleeding a little and since then I&#39;ve had sharper pains near the entrance, probably where it&#39;s red in the photo.  So I&#39;ve been reducing pressure and things have been feeling gradually better.  In doing so I lost what looks to be about 0.5cm depth but the doc says that&#39;s expected. I still have ~16.5cm while the doc said I started with 16.83cm iirc.  13cm is the target for trans patients and that&#39;s longer than most male equipment.
</p>
<p>
Five days ago I stopped taking arnica and bromelain pills.  Since then, a slight rash I&#39;d developed on my inner ankles seemed to have cleared up.  My need to pee seems to have reduced as well to the point I had two nights of sleeping 4, then 4 hours.  Other nights have not been as good but have still been significantly better than before I stopped them.  My bladder has been sensitive to various foods like peppers and soda for the last couple years so this is probably not a problem for most, but
<strong>
consider stopping arnica and bromelain if you have strong urges to pee or rashes
</strong>
.  The rash also makes me wonder if the herbs were actually slowing down my healing process instead of helping.  I wish I&#39;d stopped them earlier.
</p>
<p>
Pain continues to improve but mobility is still reduced.  I had more clit-region pain earlier in the week but it seems to have calmed down now.  Four days ago I went downstairs for the first time to snuggle my SO in their bed.  It didn&#39;t seem that difficult but I felt more sore than usual the next day.  My general pain level is pretty low when in my bed but whenever I stand or walk or lay in a slightly unusual position too long it gets increasingly sore and I often have sudden sharper pains in a single spot that changes every time.  I imagine it&#39;s all because of the 3-4 month sutures pulling things.
</p>
<p>
I still can&#39;t walk quite normally but can move a bit faster.  I tried putting my legs together completely today and it doesn&#39;t hurt too much but feels worse the longer I do it so sleeping on my side is still out of the question.  I find myself stretching my legs out more straight in bed than I used to, with my knees a bit lower.  The range of positions I can get comfortable in has improved somewhat.
</p>
<p>
I only apply ice these days when I&#39;m sore and I noticed I can tolerate it a lot better.  Instead of putting 2-3 layers of blanket between me and the ice I can go with just a cloth or even less and still keep it on for an hour.
</p>
<p>
Since I&#39;ve been using the thin panty liners, they don&#39;t soak up enough stray lubricant after I dilate if I just wipe the lube away.  So I&#39;ve begun to usually shower after each dilation.  So much showering and soaping away the lube leaves me more sore for a bit.  I discovered today that if I let the shower hit at a 45 degree angle instead of facing the shower head directly, it seems to cause less soreness and less water drips out when I sit on the toilet after the shower.  I&#39;m also trying to not soap it as much because I think the soap irritates it.  Post-op instructions say to use &#34;dilute soap&#34; but I&#39;m not sure how to accomplish that with a bar of soap.  I also worry that I&#39;m getting it wet too often since post-op says keep it dry, but since I&#39;m at 8 weeks I hope the dampness isn&#39;t as dangerous as it would have been earlier.
</p>
<p>
I took photos of my abdominal incisions a few days ago but they don&#39;t look obviously different so I&#39;m not gonna post them.
</p>

I&#39;ve been wanting to share my design for the monitor and keyboard stand I use over my bed.  I originally included it in this post and then realized it would be easier for people to find in a

More scabs have gone away including the big one to the left of the clit hood.  I no longer feel any hard lump there so I guess the sutures broke off as well.  That feels like progress!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/y3fmlz01gjy61.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f54b933f1147f007d7ec9c8e561b1790bf2d62cb">https://preview.redd.it/y3fmlz01gjy61.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f54b933f1147f007d7ec9c8e561b1790bf2d62cb

<p>
Internally, things don&#39;t look much different than in my last photo but I got a clearer picture.  I compared this to one taken 3 weeks post-op, just after I got home from the long car trip:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/zpneioplgjy61.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76384e16ccedada46f9db71b4cb046ca2e6b31ad">https://preview.redd.it/zpneioplgjy61.png?width=589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76384e16ccedada46f9db71b4cb046ca2e6b31ad
</a>
</p>
<p>
That bloody area was the first time I&#39;d encountered flowing blood during healing and it scared me with how bad it looks.  But I now realize that area has completely healed and just looks like somewhat darker skin, so that makes me happy.  Looking back through my photos I think the area was decently healed within 14 days.  It never scabbed over but did remain red for many days so it&#39;s odd how different parts heal.
</p>
<p>
I asked the doc why my clit looks so rough in texture or if the red glossy bit above the rough area is actually my clit.  One of the nurses responded with &#34;We would have to do an exam and show you in person.&#34;  That&#39;s annoying.  I guess I&#39;ll find out in early June.  They said everything looked good with healing.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been sleeping better in general though there are still nights when I get up every 2 hours and those make me miserable.  My energy is significantly improved.  I was able to lift my 18lb monitor down to my bed and back up to the monitor stand with no additional pain.  This is against the 10lb limit in post-op instructions but it was a short distance and one time thing.
</p>
<p>
4 days ago I got a burning pain I think from the sutures in right labia majora.  When I tried to sleep it would go away, then flare up every few mins despite remaining perfectly still.  The inconsistency kept me awake and after an hour of it I took the first oxycodone I&#39;d taken in probably two weeks and finally slept after 30+ mins.
</p>
<p>
The next day I realized dilation was no longer causing burning pain around the entrance so when I finished 15 mins at full depth, I decided to insert the next size up dilator.  I got it in to four dots visible and held for 10 mins.  I&#39;ve continued this with each dilation and found I don&#39;t need to add lube to the larger dilator - the lube inside is enough.  So I just leave it cleaned and ready to grab once I remove and set down the smaller dilator on its end.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I got the larger dilator to 3 dots but it went in less far this morning.  I don&#39;t want to push it too hard and hurt anything.  Despite the stretching, it remains just as difficult to get the smaller dilator started, but it hurts somewhat less than a week ago.  Getting it in the last 1-2 inches is just as hard if not harder than last week but also hurts less.  I really hope it loosens up soon.
</p>
<p>
3 days ago I had a significant number of pains in random places, but the next day I was able to lay in bed with my SO almost the whole day and not suffer any unusual pain afterward.  In fact, pain has become rare the last 2 days.  It&#39;s usually just a feeling of tightness when I move.  I&#39;m very pleased.
</p>
<p>
I can also touch everything in the shower without pain except the upper area of labia minora, and the pain there is mild.  I feel like touching labia majora makes them swell and feel tight as in an arousal response.  I also noticed my clit area doesn&#39;t hurt much anymore when I do get aroused, but I still try to avoid it.
</p>
<p>
I read in a trans group that progesterone increases libido so I stopped taking it April 29th.  I can&#39;t be sure it&#39;s not a placebo effect or coincidence, but my libido and arousal pain have been significantly reduced since then.
</p>
<p>
A couple days ago I had to strain fairly hard to poop but it didn&#39;t hurt anything.  A couple times I&#39;ve had to poop 10 mins after peeing, which resulted in a second pee and then I had to spray hydrogen peroxide and wait 5 mins for it to dry out a second time.  I asked Mozaic if the peroxide spray had to be done after every pee even if you&#39;d done it 10 mins earlier and they said it still needed to be done.  Bah humbug.
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m doing well and feeling much better emotionally.  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t tell how much of that has to do with healing and how much with an unrelated issue in my life that got resolved.  I&#39;m looking forward to three weeks from now when I can theoretically not worry about getting aroused and drop dilation from 3 to 1 times per day.  It&#39;s amazing to think that will give me 2+ extra hours per day to do work or whatever.  In two days I go to get my second vaccine shot and I hope this time I can sit down on a donut cushion for it and not be in so much pain during the drive.  I&#39;ll let you know how that went in my next update.

It&#39;s looking much less red in the vaginal canal but there&#39;s some odd white swollen area above it that often mildly hurts during dilation.  Hopefully it resolves over time.  The red area at the top of the slit has also grown and I&#39;m starting to wonder if it&#39;s the clit.  It sort of looks like granulation tissue but doesn&#39;t seem to bleed.
</p>
<p>
A couple days ago I took the silicone tape off my stomach sutures and left them off to see if the scabs would off.  Most of them did before I took pics today:

I&#39;m not so happy with how red they are but hope someday they fade to skin color.  The two closer to my waist (1st and 4th pic) seem more healed, a little shorter, and there&#39;s no swelling or pain when I push on them.  The other two still have a bit of a stiff/swollen feeling when pressed and ache subtly after I push them.  I&#39;m putting the silicone tape back on all of them.
</p>
<p>
On average, it&#39;s gotten a little easier and less painful to start the dilator since last week but getting it in the last 2 inches remains just as difficult.  I continue to get the larger dilator to exactly 3 dots visible but pushing deeper hurts, so I don&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve kept a log of what I eat and when I get up to pee and have found some correlations but they&#39;re not always consistent.  But by avoiding spicy/acidic foods for dinner and seemingly also by eating white cake (maybe it acts as an antacid?), one night I managed to sleep 6 hours without needing to pee, beating my previous 4.5 hour record by a lot.  Some nights I still get up every 2 hours and it still sucks.  I discovered I can kneel down and lay my chest on a pillow on the bed while I wait 5 mins for the hydrogen peroxide spray to dissipate and that helps me get back to sleep, but the kneeling also caused a bit of extra pain yesterday, I think because I stretched things when I stood up.  I also found that I&#39;m less sensitive to the spray and could lay down after 3 mins with only subtle pain.
</p>
<p>
Pain has gotten a lot better the last week.  Sitting on the toilet seat is only mildly uncomfortable now.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been any sharp pains and it&#39;s never kept me awake.  Random pain still happens but is more rare and less bothersome.  I&#39;ve reduced from 3 ibuprofen and two tylenol staggered every 4 hours to 2 ibuprofen and 1 tylenol.  On a couple days I forgot to take them for 12+ hours and I got a little more sore but it wasn&#39;t bad.
</p>
<p>
I can put my legs in a lot more positions without pain but I still can&#39;t lay on my side without too much discomfort to sleep.  I can put my knees completely together while standing but it creates an uncomfortable pressure high on my inner thighs as if they&#39;re swollen.  That area has had a subtle rash (not really visible but the skin feels bumpy) during the entirety of my healing but the rash seems to be fading the more I heal.  There&#39;s still soreness when I walk but I can almost ignore it most of the time.  I went downstairs earlier today and felt I could almost take the stairs normally.
</p>
<p>
Two days ago I noticed for the first time that I peed straight down for the entire session without it ever veering off where it shouldn&#39;t go. Of course it hasn&#39;t happened again since then but hopefully someday it will flow true.
</p>
<p>
I left the house for my second vaccine shot on 5-13.  This time, I took an oxycodone an hour before and kept an ice pack on my groin almost the entire trip.  There was very little pain this time except for one speed bump that rocked the car violently left and right.  Took a few mins for pain to fade from that.  All the turns and vibration that bothered me so much last time caused almost no pain this time.
</p>
<p>
After the shot they had me stay 30 mins instead of the 15 they asked last time.  I decided not to ask for the bed this time and thought I could just stand.  I tried to blow up my donut pillow in case I needed to sit.  It&#39;s designed to inflate using a little pump but I forgot to bring that and blowing into it is oddly difficult.  So I got winded and lightheaded and had to sit on it with little inflation.  It felt sore but didn&#39;t really hurt.  But the donut wanted to slide off the metal chair unless I kept my legs tensed and the effort to do that kept me feeling tired and sweaty.  After awhile I stood up for a few mins, felt lightheaded again, sat down and toughed out the remaining time.  I should have asked for the bed but I survived.
</p>
<p>
Pain was more noticeable after laying back in the car but quieted down after icing and never got too bad. Oddly I noticed it was worst once we stopped moving at home and it seemed to improve quickly once I removed ice so I think I got it too cold.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve used ice since then.  I saw three small streaks of blood on the dilator that evening and one of my perineum sutures burned a bit in the shower but everything went back to normal the next day.
</p>
<p>
I tried my higher quality donut pillow the next day and was surprised to find it was fairly painful.  So was sitting on a fairly cushioned chair.  So I guess the only reason the thin donut on the metal chair was tolerable was the oxycodone.

It is the scab that never ends.  It just goes on and on my friends.  But swelling seems noticeably down in this picture.

<p>
The lumpy red and white at the edge of the vaginal canal looks more lumpy and gross... though I think maybe the left side of it shrunk.  It usually hurts a little to push past and sometimes bleeds, especially in the first dilation of the day, though it didn&#39;t bleed today.  Getting the dilator started has gotten a bit easier on average but getting it to full depth doesn&#39;t feel much if any easier than a week ago.  I continue to get the purple dilator to exactly 3 dots showing most of the time but I&#39;ve never gotten it deeper.
</p>
<p>
I noticed the loops of the sutures at the bottom of the photo are above the skin surface, so that&#39;s another sign that swelling is down.  I noticed a few days ago that it feels like there are less suture ends poking out when I rub down there during showering.  Two days ago one of the poking sutures started burning a bit when touched and occasionally at random times when I shifted in bed.  I took photos and didn&#39;t see any redness or swelling but I started trying to get the hydrogen peroxide spray into its region more often and used the towel and the air dryer on a bidet.  I don&#39;t know if that actually helped but the pain was gone around 36 hours later.
</p>
<p>
My mobility continues to increase and I can walk almost normally for short periods, but it tends to make me sore if I don&#39;t walk a bit bow legged.  There is still wide variation in how stiff or tight things feel and it seems to change randomly.  Pain is uncommon, but last night I was laying with my leg propped in a slightly off position and I got a sudden burning pain somewhere on the left.  It lasted a few seconds as I tried to shift around and then the area felt slightly tender and prone to little jolts of pain when I moved.  It seems fine today.
</p>
<p>
Two days ago, while leaning forward to put something under my bed I felt something pop in my loins. It didn&#39;t really hurt but was unnerving.  I&#39;m guessing it was a suture breaking internally.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been doing more physical stuff trying to clean my room and do little projects.  I even used a fairly heavy oscillating tool (guessing 10lbs?) to cut the end off a screw which took at least 20 mins and required standing in a slight crouch.  I expected it would cause pain and I&#39;d have to stop but it had little effect that I could tell.  I still tire quickly and have to lay down after 20 mins or less of moving around.  Yesterday I almost fainted after being on my feet around 30 mins in the bathroom.  I mostly blame it on the air being moist and oxygen deprived from SO taking a shower and then me taking a shower.
</p>
<p>
5 days ago I switched from panties to boxer shorts.  I hate wearing guy things but I also hated the leg holes of the panties always pulling on my groin uncomfortably when I got in bed and needing lots of adjustment.  The boxers have been far easier to keep comfortable while walking or laying down.
</p>
<p>
I tried sitting on a donut pillow again and it was only mildly uncomfortable but still felt like it would grow painful if I stayed for too long.  I also tried laying on my side with two pillows between my knees and gave up after a minute of dull pain.
</p>
<p>
I found I can lay on my back a minute after using hydrogen peroxide and not feel any pain.  However, the first night I tried doing that I ended up waking with an urgent need to pee every 2 hours or less and I wonder if the peroxide was seeping into my urethra to cause irritation, so I&#39;ve returned to waiting 5 mins before laying down.
</p>
<p>
I realized today I can touch and lightly press the entire length of the vag with little pain.  That&#39;s certainly nice.  I&#39;ve taken to spreading and rubbing it a bit to try and wash the lubricant out of it more thoroughly and since then I&#39;ve had much less gunk left on the panty liners.  Today, I was even able to push and stretch it in order to shave with a 1/16&#34; guard on an electric razor.  This got rid of the hairs that kept getting pulled in and tugged during dilation.  Pressing some spots felt a bit sore but barely painful.

Ding dong, the scab is dead!  I finally saw the big scab at the top was gone 3 days ago, and the day after it seemed a lot of the labia majora scabs were also gone.  This was after I did a long drive and a bit of walking so I wonder if the movement knocked them off.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/a1qpj16cbq271.png?width=976&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7433ddba134eb20fdb4e6d0e625be6a75233539f">https://preview.redd.it/a1qpj16cbq271.png?width=976&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7433ddba134eb20fdb4e6d0e625be6a75233539f
</a>
</p>
<p>
Things look a little less red and swollen at the top and bottom.  The yellow/white crusty stuff to the left and right of labia minora also seems less pronounced.  I&#39;m starting to think it isn&#39;t yeast but some sort of glue or surgical material because of how it won&#39;t wash off.
</p>
<p>
A few hours after I shaved a week ago, I got burning pain along the labia majora sutures.  It didn&#39;t affect my sleep but made it harder to find leg positions that didn&#39;t hurt.  It persisted the next day and dilation was also significantly tighter as if things inside were swollen just from my pressing on the outside.  I started using ice again for the first time in I think a couple weeks.
</p>
<p>
By the next day, things felt tight but the burning pain was gone and icing wasn&#39;t as necessary.  Dilation continued to be difficult and the following day I saw a bit of blood on the dilator which I hadn&#39;t seen for a week previously.   I started being even more gentle with my pressure and stopping the purple dilator at any sign of pain which made it rare to get the purple dilator beyond 4 dots visible.
</p>
<p>
4 days ago I was driven many hours to pick up a friend.  While out I visited my parents for the first time since my surgery.  I was able to lay on their couch with one leg horizontal and one vertical for 3-4 hours without much discomfort.  Then for four days in a row we drove around a few hours each day doing stuff.  I was stuck laying in the back of the car for the most part but I rarely felt more than sore and I didn&#39;t use oxycodone but I did ice regularly.  I generally ate food in the car but got out to walk around with them for 10-40 min periods a few times.  All of this activity made my loins more sore than usual and one of my dilations was significantly more bloody than normal, but for the most part I was surprised how well I tolerated everything, especially given how sore things had been a few days earlier after I shaved.  I definitely felt physically fatigued pretty quickly and starting yesterday I was more tired than I can remember feeling in years.  I&#39;m still tired today despite a pretty good sleep.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because of activity or scar tissue but dilation seems to be getting slightly harder the last few days. The little burning pains I used to feel from certain areas during insertion are rarely present but there are still sore spots. In general, every time I make a significant movement there is some level of soreness whether it&#39;s walking or just getting up out of bed. It tends to improve gradually as I move but never goes away entirely. At least I can shift my legs in bed without feeling much and I can pretty easily ignore the soreness to get in and out of difficult positions like the back of the car.
</p>
<p>
Two days ago I allowed myself to remain aroused for a prolonged period.  It didn&#39;t feel entirely comfortable but didn&#39;t really hurt, either.  Even though it&#39;s been 12 weeks, I still don&#39;t want to risk masturbating but it&#39;s definitely nice to be able to think sexy thoughts again and not feel like I&#39;m damaging myself.  I also dared to let a partner&#39;s phallus gently rest against my vulva for a bit and that felt amazing.  I wish I could do more but until I can get the purple dilator in decently without pain and not end up with blood on it every few days, sex doesn&#39;t feel like a possibility.  My next post-op visit is next week so we&#39;ll see what the doctor says.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m getting up less to pee but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s because of healing or because I&#39;m avoiding foods I&#39;ve learned trigger me.  I feel like holding pee is easier and I wasn&#39;t forced to go any of the times we were out the last few days.  I&#39;m also kneeling on the floor and hugging a pillow over my bed with my eyes closed for ~5 mins after each pee at night without triggering much pain.  This helps me get back to sleep more quickly so my rest is overall improving.
</p>
<p>
Today I tested sitting again and oddly, it hurts a lot less to sit on a soft chair with nothing rather than using a half-inflated donut pillow. Leaving the pillow only slightly inflated feels like the best option and feels like I might be able to do it for an extended period but it isn&#39;t really comfortable.  Same problem laying on my side - I might be able to tolerate it for an extended period but worry the persistent low level pain means I&#39;m damaging something.
</p>
<p>
The last two times I douched in the shower, I hit the correct spot on my first try without a mirror, so I&#39;m getting quite used to my new parts and that feels nice.  Getting through the first 3 months feels like quite an accomplishment and I&#39;m happy I can endure some reasonable levels of activity without feeling too debilitated.  Supposedly I can do a bunch of new stuff starting today: Dilate once per day instead of three times, sex, submerge myself in water, not use hydrogen peroxide spray after peeing, etc.  But to be safe I&#39;m going to wait and ask the doctor about all those things next week before I make any changes.  Since we were out a lot, I did skip one of my dilations most of the last 4 days and I may continue doing that depending how I feel each day.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I noticed in the last week I&#39;m growing sensitive to heat again.  Before surgery I left my thermostat at 62F during the night and felt overheated at 75 or higher.  But while I was healing I used more blankets and couldn&#39;t take the room going below 70.  If it got to 80-82 I still felt comfortable.  Now 80 is feeling too warm again.  This must have something to do with the healing process and the body&#39;s thermoregulation but I&#39;m not sure how it works.

</p>
<p>
I picked off the top left big scab in the shower when I noticed it felt loose.  But it left this white dot that looks sort of like a callous (dense, dead skin).  Part of the scab looked like a callous as well.  And the two big scabs below it also have white.  I plan to ask the doctor what it means when I see her later this week.
</p>
<p>
Tired of feeling hair pull into me when I dilated, I did a better job shaving, especially around the vaginal entrance.  This left things more swollen than usual and a bit sore, though the soreness seems to have passed after a few hours instead of lasting 2 days like last time.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure if it has to do with the swelling but when I pulled the labia apart, I noticed the crease between labia majora and minor has disappeared in the middle of the picture:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/85il2m7vkz371.png?width=1297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d574afeca350ce5aaa2320cce2ed853b6406cb3">https://preview.redd.it/85il2m7vkz371.png?width=1297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d574afeca350ce5aaa2320cce2ed853b6406cb3
</a>
</p>
<p>
You can still see a difference in skin tone and texture, but I&#39;m worried the crease will continue to lose definition.  It still has definition when I spread my legs while standing, at least:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/skdmj0j5lz371.png?width=1590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f98fc010b4ee80256756dc49768bb02e3cc4074">https://preview.redd.it/skdmj0j5lz371.png?width=1590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f98fc010b4ee80256756dc49768bb02e3cc4074
</a>
</p>
<p>
Most of the glue or whatever it was in the crease has worn away.  Still a lot of icky red/white stuff and odd folds around the vaginal canal entrance that worries me.
</p>
<p>
You might notice little hairs stuck to things from my shaving.  I tried to shower extra carefully, soaped repeatedly, and spread the lips to run water over it for quite awhile but those hairs just clung... and then they ended up all over my dilator.  Argh.  I&#39;m a little worried some might get stuck inside me but hopefully they&#39;ll get pushed out by dilating or douching eventually.
</p>
<p>
After shaving I noticed what I thought was a thick hair in the mirror and when I pulled it out it was a suture!  It came out as a knot with a long straight piece attached but when I set it down and moved it to take a photo the straight piece broke off, so I hope this means the 3-4 month sutures are getting pretty weak:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/7yinsmhdmz371.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca10877e5b61b5538184f8a747f224048cf5ef81">https://preview.redd.it/7yinsmhdmz371.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca10877e5b61b5538184f8a747f224048cf5ef81
</a>
</p>
<p>
Five days ago I let myself get fully aroused for a prolonged period. It felt like I had a penis slowly growing to full hardness. It was slightly painful at first like the &#34;painful erection&#34; sensation when you&#39;re super aroused but it faded into a comfortable, full sensation.  I suspect my clit elongated or swelled because there was a subtle sensation of things shifting but I couldn&#39;t see a difference on the outside.  The same muscles that make a penis bounce up and down still get activated during arousal and it causes things to shift in some way that I could feel against my underwear, but it&#39;s a small shift.
</p>
<p>
I was text roleplaying with someone online and as things went on, the only pain I felt was from the labia sutures on the left. I added ice to help that somewhat and the pain came and went. Even though the sex was all in my imagination, it felt so amazing... Eventually, I felt near orgasm without even touching myself. I did try to touch at one point, just rubbing over my clit hood, and it felt like it could have pushed me into orgasm... but it quickly made the labia sutures hurt so I had to stop. Even so, it all felt far better and more satisfying than I expected.
</p>
<p>
The next day after dilation I thought maybe I could touch my clit before I washed off the lubrication.  It felt quite good to just rub the hood but after ~10 secs the clit area felt really swollen and mildly painful and my left top labia suture burned.  FML...
</p>
<p>
Two days later I gave in and touched my clit hood again. It hurt the labia to either side slightly at first but that faded and then it just felt good. Then I kept feeling a little bump that seemed like a suture and I worried I might irritate it.  After about a minute I decided I really should ask the doctor before I risk hurting anything, but I&#39;m definitely tired of waiting to explore myself.
</p>
<p>
Dilation has been tighter this week and that&#39;s really frustrating.  I can&#39;t reduce it from 3x per day till it improves.  Two days ago there was a significant amount of blood during morning dilation - about half as much as the most blood I&#39;ve seen from dilation.  After that it returned to little to no blood again.  Today things felt possibly a little less tight.
</p>
<p>
Soreness while walking seems significantly improved the last couple days (at least before I shaved) and I continue to be able to lay in more variable positions.  Still stuck on my back and unable to sit comfortably, unfortunately.  I went down and up the stairs without dragging myself on the railing yesterday.  I&#39;m sometimes frustrated by the 3-4 hours of dilating that eats up so much of each day but I&#39;m not getting depressed much the last week or more.
</p>
<p>
I may make another update this week after I see the doctor for three month post-op but I&#39;m not sure what day it will be since I&#39;ll be doing some limited sight seeing.

Can you talk more about your experience getting a foreign insurance to work with her clinic? Her website says she doesn’t take most common US insurances and only seems to take California specific insurance.

When I spoke to them in late 2019, they said they take Anthem Blue Cross PPO, Blue Shield PPO of California and
<a href="https://www.fortifiedprovider.com/Questions-And-Answers.aspx" rel="nofollow">Fortified Provider Network
</a>
(FPN).  I think you can get one of those in most states in the US.
</p>
<p>
For other countries or other insurance carriers in the US you probably have to convince your insurance to cover it as an unusual circumstance.  Like argue you can&#39;t get PPTV locally and you will probably have to appeal a couple times.  Whether or not this works will probably depend on luck, perseverance, and ability to quote laws that work in your favor.  I recommend contacting MozaicCare to ask if anyone in your country has succeeded in the process and what they did.
</p>
<p>
Before I switched to Blue Shield, there was someone in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California network trying to convince them to cover Dr. Wittenberg and they failed the appeal process.  This is part of why I didn&#39;t bother trying to get Kaiser Southern California to cover her, but if you have the patience and no other good options I think it&#39;s worth trying to fight for it.

How can my insurance cover it if she doesn’t take my insurance? I have United healthcare which does cover bottom surgery but I thought if she didn’t accept it then it was a lost cause.
</p>
<p>
Her office did say my insurance might cover some of the facility costs but not the surgery itself because they don’t take it. Idk I might be being dumb insurance is really confusing to me :/
</p>
<p>
I also did look at buying a plan from the companies listed on her website and all of them looked like they didn’t even offer individual self pay plans so I really don’t know what I’m doing.

When a doctor &#34;takes your insurance&#34; it means they have a contract with the insurance company, are usually considered &#34;in network&#34; with the insurance, and they handle billing the insurance company for you.
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;ve heard of people (don&#39;t know any personally) who have gotten an insurance company to pay for services at doctors that aren&#39;t contracted with them.  Before Kaiser trained in-network doctors to do SRS, they would pay external doctors to do the procedure.  I&#39;ve also heard of people getting electrolysis done and then fighting to get insurance to reimburse them for it because it was medically necessary.
</p>
<p>
In each case, the patient is basically getting insurance to cover something that wasn&#39;t normally available in their network.  Now that most insurance covers penile inversion in network, I think it will be quite hard to convince them to pay for PPTV outside their network.  You need to know your rights, how the laws work in your area, how appeal processes work, and how your insurance company works.  It&#39;s not easy and it&#39;s different with each company and each state/country.  If you can find someone in your region who&#39;s done it and can give you guidance, that would be enormously helpful, but most likely you will be in unknown territory and need to learn it all by making lots of phone calls and doing lots of online research.  Even then I&#39;m sorry to say that your odds of it working out are probably low.

EDIT: As time goes by and PPTV is seen as less experimental with more known benefits, it may become easier to convince the oversight boards that often handle final appeals that insurance companies must cover PPTV from external providers if they don&#39;t offer it in network, but it&#39;s hard to say when or if that will happen.  It would probably help your case to throw a bunch of research papers at the oversight boards and write your own argument using medical terms that show you know what you&#39;re talking about.
</p>
<p>
I think your best option is to call the companies listed on Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s web site and ask them if they will sell you a self-pay plan in your area.

You&#39;re welcome!  I could never find anyone talking in much detail about their recovery experience with Dr. Wittenberg so I thought I&#39;d create the kind of experience and recommendations log I wish I&#39;d had before I started.  I hope your recovery continues to go well.

Thank you again, my internet angel! Before my surgery, I wouldn’t resort to acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen for pain or fever because I tried to avoid anything chemically.  But for the past 42 days, I’ve been taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen with 400 or 600 mgs of Gabapentin every 5 hours. I was kind of relieved that you mentioned that you’re still taking them because I now know that I’m not the only one. I never took my oxycodone except the first day after the surgery.  I also stopped icing two weeks ago because I thought it was making my wound dehiscence moist. It improved since then. I also dry the area using hair dryer on the coldest setting after washing or taking a shower. I limited my use of hydrogen peroxide solution because it irritates the wound dehiscence. I just wash with plain water or diluted dove body wash after peeing. It feels clean and refreshing. When I’m feeling some pain I just choose to be kind to myself so I just dilate twice, so far the depth hasn’t changed but then again it’s just me. Again, thank you for your update. You have no idea how helpful it is. It’s just like waiting for the next episode of my favorite TV show. Sending you light, hugs, love and healing 💜

Glad you&#39;re doing well!
</p>
<p>
Dr. Wittenberg has most people ween off Gabapentin within 21 days. 3 caps 3x per day for 7 days, then 2-3 caps 2x per day for 7 days, 2 caps 1x at night for 7 days, then stop.  Unless she instructed you differently I would ween off at that rate or ask her for instructions.  It&#39;s meant to help with &#34;deep nerve&#34; pain so I don&#39;t think it does much for the suture or dehiscence pain.
</p>
<p>
As far as skipping the hydrogen peroxide I think it would be better to wash with water that&#39;s been heated in the microwave till it bubbles then add 1/4 tbsp iodized salt to each cup of water.  It shouldn&#39;t cause you pain but will kill bacteria better than tap water.
</p>
<p>
Good idea on the hair dryer.  I was considering the same but I also feel like it hurts a bit more when it&#39;s totally dry (which it can get if I go without panties for awhile).  Wounds also heal better/faster when they have some moisture which is why many docs now recommend keeping them covered with Aquaphor.  Aquaphor is like a thinner version of Vaseline and it locks moisture in and keeps bacteria out.  Scabs are doing the same thing - locking moisture in and keeping bacteria out.  The old myth that &#34;skin needs to breathe&#34; is simply not true.  But if hair dryer seems to help your dehiscence maybe it&#39;s best to keep doing it or ask the doc their opinion.  I suspect drying it to that level may be reducing skin moisture so it doesn&#39;t swell as much, which might be good to stop the wound from stretching open but also might slow healing.  If it were me I&#39;d try to keep a thin layer of Aquaphor on it and see how it does but I know everyone has different opinions.

Thank you for the advice. I tried aquaphor and it helped with the overdrying but it was greasy and uncomfortable and difficult to wash it off. The wound dehiscence is responding very well with washing with mild soap. I still use hydrogen peroxide solution and also saline only for douching. I’m glad that you’re healing pretty well based on the pictures. Yours didn’t have wound dehiscence. Mine was really bad that I could not stand looking at it. I did trial and error and my present ‘treatment’ works well. I am not taking Gabapentin for wound dehiscence. I’m taking them for nerve pain. I was given a refill even if I was not asking for it. Perhaps the doctor knew that I needed them. I also have exposed sutures and staples. They hurt so bad that I needed to go to surgeon’s office to have the staples removed and sutures trimmed a little bit. I am relieved somehow but they’re still there poking and puncturing my skin once in a while. My case is different. It was pretty bad. I followed what I was told but I had to tweak it because I know my body and I listened to what it needs. I have a very hard recovery and I thank God everyday for even the smallest improvement. I live a very healthy lifestyle, I have a nice house to recover and a good support system but sometimes life’s not fair and it doesn’t make any sense. I will stick to what I’m doing right now but I thank you for all the updates.

I&#39;m so sorry your recovery has been so difficult.  I had something that looked like dehiscence (the nurse called it that based on the picture) but it was in a place that tended to push closed more than pull open and so it healed with no special treatment.
</p>
<p>
I found another article on the benefit of keeping wounds moist using Aquaphor or Vaseline:
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-wound-care-20160725-snap-story.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-wound-care-20160725-snap-story.html
</a>
</p>
<p>
It says wounds kept dry will not heal as quickly or as well.  So you might try a thin layer of Aquaphor and don&#39;t try to wash it off.  Eventually it will get rubbed off onto the maxipad or wash away in the shower, at which point you can apply a thin layer again.  You can even use the hair dryer on it and it will still keep the wound moist.  Up to you!

Thank you! Wouldn’t aquaphor get inside the vaginal canal? Mu wound dehiscence is near the canal.

Sounds like it probably could get inside, especially when you dilate.  But I don&#39;t see how it could harm anything.  However, the doctor does caution against dilating with oil based lubricants so I would double check with them.

Both purchased Jan 14, 2020 ahead of my FFS surgery.  I didn&#39;t notice any problems with them then but I don&#39;t think I took them half as long. Still, they could have gone bad.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Expiration on the bottles is 2022 for one and 2023 for the other so they shouldn&#39;t be bad.

I recommend just using the ice bags they give you at the hospital.  Get 4-6 good quality ice trays to fill them with.  Any of the freezer packs I&#39;ve used don&#39;t last nearly as long as ice and it&#39;s obnoxious for you or your caretaker to get up every hour or two at night to change packs.  The hospital originally put two full packs between my thighs and one across my lower belly.  I kept that up during recovery until it got too painful, then started adding fabric layers, then reduced to two packs between thighs, then one pack, then more fabric layers.  At some point I doubt much of the cold was even reaching my flesh but it hurt too much to have it closer.  As I healed I could tolerate a little more cold again.  After a few weeks I used just six ice cubes in one pack for some pain relief without so much weight.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;ll give you mesh panties until the wound vac is removed.  After that I found them to be too tight and switched to loose panties I&#39;d brought.  Stick an always ultrathin smallest size without wings on them and once you&#39;re not as messy, switch to U by Kotex barely there liners - I use two standard size in a row because the Long version is not long enough and it&#39;s too wide.  I wouldn&#39;t say that having anything touching your groin is comfortable but you need something to catch discharge and to be between you and the ice packs.  I always pull my panties down when I walk so the pad isn&#39;t rubbing.  Dresses or skirts are ideal to allow you to do that and that&#39;s all I wore.
</p>
<p>
Based on the list from the doctor, I picked up a few very loose, soft pants at Goodwill with adjustable waist cinch but I think I only wore one of them a couple times on particularly cold days.

Yeah, I&#39;m quite happy with the look so far.  I do think that splitting the penile shaft to make labia minora is a big part of the reason it looks so good, and that&#39;s usually not possible to do without the peritoneal pull-through for the vaginal canal.  If you look at Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s web site, you&#39;ll see labia minora in her PI procedures usually become very subtle after 6+ months.  I&#39;m still worried that might happen with me but we&#39;ll see.

How long did you do hair removal before surgery did you have a some hair still growing in the area? I have my surgery in July and I still see small blonde hair growing in the surgery area. I’m debating on delaying surgery because of this.

If you&#39;re doing peritoneal pull-through vaginoplasty, Dr. Wittenberg no longer requires hair removal.  If you&#39;re doing penile inversion, you should expect to be doing electrolysis regularly for a year or more.  A few lucky people get away with 9 months or a bit less but it depends on how rapidly each of your hair follicles moves between growth and dormant phases.  You basically have to keep clearing the area of hair until you see zero regrowth for at least a month.
</p>
<p>
I did do quite a lot of removal because Dr. Wittenberg used to require it for PPTV and I was also debating doing PI but I didn&#39;t have time for 100% removal because covid closed electrologists for so many months.  Looking back at my calendar I did about 59 two hour electrolysis visits and about 2/3 of them were genital electrolysis so about 78 hours of it and there was still some regrowth.
</p>
<p>
My first electrologist used overly high settings and bad technique so it was really painful and left scabs everywhere.  I started to get really depressed/afraid before each session which finally motivated me to pay out of pocket to try other providers.  I tried 4 others and they were all much less painful and didn&#39;t leave many scabs.  I got used to the process enough that it didn&#39;t bother me too much to go in and I rewarded myself with a visit to a bakery each time.  FWIW, I&#39;d say I have an average pain tolerance.
</p>
<p>
For me, a 2.5% lidocaine, 2.5% prilocaine cream worked much better than the 5% lidocaine cream they gave me at first.  It has to be rubbed in thoroughly, then another layer spread on and covered with plastic wrap.  The provider should pull plastic wrap away gradually as they work.  Once the numbing fades too much I have them add &#34;Superjuice 3&#34; oil which is 4% lidocaine, 2% tetracaine, and 12% benzocaine.  It numbs within a minute but only lasts ~10 mins.  It doesn&#39;t numb quite as well as the lido/prilo cream but it makes things tolerable.  Towards the end I was able to do 4 hour sessions.  It also helped that at that point, most of the thick hairs were gone so they could use lower settings.
</p>
<p>
Some people also use a THC or CBD vape pen but for me it seemed to make the pain a little less intense but last longer.  Overall I felt that was worse.

As of this week I’ve gotten emails from her office with laser hair removal instructions for PPT, so as far as I can tell she’s still having people do it.

What was the wording of the email? My impression was she still recommends people do it but it&#39;s not required.

Thank you for the 12th week update! Your kitty looks pretty 😍.
</p>
<p>
Before my surgery, I wasn’t horny or not actively wanting sex. Post surgery, for the past 2-3 weeks, I have always been horny and have been having wet dreams. My vulva hurts when I wake up from the dreams. It felt like I was having erections or something? Do you experience that too?
</p>
<p>
I still have cloudy, pus-like discharge flowing from clitoral hood or somewhere there or the sutures between the labia majora &amp; minora. I can’t tell really because I’m still scared to open up the lips. Doctor says it’s normal. Do you have discharge like that too? When the doctor said expect discharge, I thought the discharge comes from the canal not from the clitoris/urethra area. During the first few weeks I wasn’t paying attention to where the discharge was coming from. All I knew was my pad has discharge. There are days it doesn’t have smell. Some days stink a little bit. Again, doctor says normal but I don’t see other girls talk about it. I did more research and it seems like it’s vaginitis? Who knows because the doctor says it’s normal. Anyways thank you again for the update and can’t wait for your 3rd month consultation.

There was a time or two I woke from a wet dream and felt pain.  It does feel a lot like having an erection but with a painful edge.  I haven&#39;t noticed being more or less horny since surgery.  After I stopped taking progesterone I did become less horny.
</p>
<p>
Discharge is a common thing and I think
<a href="https://mygenderconfirmation.wordpress.com/blog-2/" rel="nofollow">this blog
</a>
mentions it.  For me, I get scab-colored stains on my pads that I assume are from the same material the scabs are made of.  Since I have scabs in a number of places it&#39;s hard to know where it comes from.  It might also be lubricant that&#39;s been lightly blood stained.  It could even be transudate (fluid that slowly permeates the vaginal walls and aids in lubrication) which is supposed to have a slightly yellow color. I&#39;ve only witnessed discharge that was truly liquid once, weeks ago, when a little brown scab-colored drop came out of the top of my clit hood.  That&#39;s probably part of what&#39;s been staining my pads but the flow of it is usually too slow or thin to be observed and it doesn&#39;t appear on my pads in any consistent pattern.
</p>
<p>
Wherever you have a wound, including a suture hole, the body will want to close it with a scab.  Sometimes the material that makes scabs remains liquid, especially if it&#39;s in a moist environment.  Scab material and white blood cells (pus) also trap bacteria and push it out of the wound.  So discharge is a good thing and part of healing.  As long as it isn&#39;t stinking too much it doesn&#39;t indicate any significant infection.

Yeah, some of the stories I&#39;ve read are scary.  But I believe people are more likely to come to Reddit and post bad experiences than they are to post good ones.  So I would base your expectations on the actual statistics.  Dr. Wittenberg gave me the following stats in late 2019 for her patients:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
256 total operations done
</li>
<li>
100% have more bladder infections, messier urine stream.
</li>
<li>
95% have granulation tissue
<ul>
<li>
Granulation tissue is &#34;beefy&#34; raw flesh that usually hurts to touch and bleeds easily.
</li>
<li>
1 patient had granulation tissue past a year
</li>
<li>
Granulation tissue is normally cauterized with silver nitrate after which it heals.  Supposedly it usually isn&#39;t too painful to treat.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
60% have incision separation on outside around 2nd week of recovery.
</li>
<li>
Some go to pelvic physical therapy for pain or discomfort.
</li>
<li>
Everyone loses 0.5-1cm depth over time.  After surgery, depth goal is 13cm.  Cis vaginas tend to be 8cm.  Some lose significantly more depth and half of those who do are doing everything right as far as dilation.
</li>
<li>
Heidi&#39;s external revision rate is 4%.  Some doctors have 30-100% (100% when they purposely do the procedure in two stages).
</li>
<li>
1 patient with regrets because of post op differences in sexual response.
</li>
<li>
1 unable to orgasm after a year.
</li>
<li>
Rectal fistula:
<ul>
<li>
4 in first 100 procedures, 2 in 2nd 100, 0 in remaining 56 procedures.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
1 bladder fistula
</li>
<li>
2 patients sent to pain management specialists for pain at 3mos or later.
</li>
<li>
All have increased risk of rhabdomyolysis which is a muscle breakdown that happens with some people with severe dehydration.
</li>
<li>
Procedure is 4-5 hours for penile inversion.
<ul>
<li>
Add 1.5 hours for peritoneal which adds 2-4% to risk in general (infection, bleeding, bowel, bladder, vasculature requiring further repair).  Doesn&#39;t change stay or recovery time.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In my opinion, all the risks are low except the granulation tissue and incision separation.  In my case, I think both those things happened but I&#39;ve been lucky they have not caused significant problems so far.  They will both heal with treatment.
</p>
<p>
So look at the risks and decide if they&#39;re worth the benefits to you.  Also consider that you have some control over the some of the risks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Make sure you have enough savings that you can take off three months from work at minimum.  Going back early definitely increases the risk of incision separation, granulation, infection, and probably other complications.  In my case I don&#39;t think it would be possible to go back to a job where I was sitting or standing as early as 3 months without being in a lot of extra pain.
</li>
<li>
Be willing to follow all doctor directions.  Stay on your back in bed except for the suggested bits of walking.  Dilate 3 times per day.  Keep iced all the time.  Don&#39;t let yourself get aroused.  It&#39;s grueling to do it for 3 months but it will keep pain down and lead to fewer complications.
</li>
<li>
If at all possible, find a way to get driven home while laying on your back.  I suspect sitting on a donut cushion for hours 3 weeks after surgery leads to a lot of issues for people.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Based on my previous experience with FFS and what I read in the one detailed account I could find from a Wittenberg patient, I wasn&#39;t expecting it to take half this long to start feeling normal again.  It&#39;s been a hard, long road that can feel interminable but I know I&#39;ll be done with it eventually.  So think about the risks vs rewards, think about your work and finances, think about your support network, think about everything you might go through to recover, and decide if it&#39;s right for you.

It’s interesting when jannaw996 mentioned that girls with bad experiences tend to post more than those with good. On my end, I see more good experiences that is why I am frustrated with mine because I tend to compare the outcome of my surgery and my recovery with most of the girls here who post their lovely vulvas and their speedy, almost painless recovery. The last time I was at the surgeon’s office I told them how frustrated I am and that I follow their other patients on the internet. I told them why No one’s looks like mine. I was told that they see the ‘real picture’. Internet isn’t the real picture, not the reality so don’t trust everything out there I was told. They only post the beautiful vaginas out there. They really see what’s going on in real life. Girls like me are not here to scare you. In my case, I want to be viewed as a learning experience. I was unrealistically a perfectionist. Now I just want this to be over. Mind you, before the surgery I was very healthy, walked/run 6 miles a day, eat mostly plant-based, have a nice house to recuperate in, supportive husband. I’m trying very hard to get back to normal. I am now seeing a therapist through zoom while lying in bed. I wish you the best on your surgery.

I&#39;m probably wrong about bad experience posts vs good ones.  That theory was based on my looking at a pretty small number of accounts from Dr. Wittenberg patients.  I haven&#39;t looked at many results from other doctors because I couldn&#39;t find any who offer PPTV.
</p>
<p>
I suspect there is a bias towards two types of posters: Those who have great results and are proud to show off, and those who feel they need to warn people of their bad outcome.  In a couple cases I saw people showing off early and then going silent or sounding negative like there was a complication they didn&#39;t want to talk about.  The vast majority of people don&#39;t post at all.  Out of the 256 operations Heidi had done when I spoke to her late 2019, I could find like 3-4 people who had posted any images online anywhere, and all but 1-2 only showed early results and not long term.  Shortly before my surgery I looked again for result pics and only found 2-3 more and I don&#39;t think any were long term.  There were a couple more people posting accounts without pictures.  Of the few new accounts I could find it felt like ~75% of them had something negative to say, and that&#39;s why I said it seems like most people come to post warnings.  But it&#39;s a small sample size.
</p>
<p>
Either way, I definitely think the stats she shares are a much better indication of probability of success than trying to figure out probabilities from the few who post online.  My whole reason for posting my updates is that I want a detailed account of a real experience to be available to people.  I&#39;m trying to show the good and the bad and be realistic.  That said, it&#39;s still impossible to know if my experience is better or worse than average because so few post long term updates with any details.

You&#39;re welcome!  Certainly sounds like you&#39;ve been through a lot and I&#39;m glad to hear you got through it.  The only other procedure I hope to do someday is fat transfer breast augmentation.  I don&#39;t suppose you have any recommendations on that front?
