Hi there. I&#39;m 3 years MtF post op and I was wondering if anyone who has undergone bottom surgery has had difficulty emptying their bladder completely and has also encounter frequent urination. I&#39;d like to hear your experiences and how you overcame the issue.

I had both those issues, especially in the first 6 months of recovery.  It was primarily caused by a bit too much erectile tissue left around the urethra, which led to the
<em>
sensation
</em>
that I couldn‚Äôt pee:  this was especially noticeable after sex.  Relaxation exercises and good old pelvic floor therapy (with a PT) helped mitigate it almost completely for me.  Im not 3 years out yet, but I hope that helps some!

I had the same experience as you, where the opening was narrowing and I had to get a meatoplasty to open up the opening. Peeing has just been a total different experience and I still am having to adjust to the new anatomy. I can&#39;t seem to hold it as long as I used too and am having to go all the time. Thanks for sharing your experience.

Surprised nobody has mentioned it yet, but seriously go get yourself checked for a UTI. Both of your symptoms seem to match. I have encountered the symptoms that you mentioned several times after being post-op and every single time it was because I had a UTI.
</p>
<p>
Symptoms include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A strong, persistent urge to urinate
</li>
<li>
A burning sensation when urinating
</li>
<li>
Passing frequent, small amounts of urine
</li>
<li>
Urine that appears cloudy
</li>
<li>
Urine that appears red, bright pink or cola-colored ‚Äî a sign of blood in the urine
</li>
<li>
Strong-smelling urine
</li>
<li>
Pelvic pain, in women ‚Äî especially in the center of the pelvis and around the area of the pubic bone
</li>
</ul>

I did hear that as a post op woman we are prone to getting UTI&#39;s. Are there ways for us to prevent from getting it all the time?

Honestly I&#39;m not great either as I tend to get them typically once a year on average. But so far what I&#39;ve found is:
</p>
<p>
1) Don&#39;t hold your pee in too long. I&#39;m talking about times like being too engrossed playing a game that you hold your pee in for hours.
</p>
<p>
2) Always wipe from front to back instead of back to front.

I&#39;ve had this on and off. I don&#39;t have much advice except, if you haven&#39;t, get tested for a UTI.  I&#39;ve had a few and they often present like you&#39;re describing.

I was urinating a lot early in my recovery. I think the swelling was preventing me from fully emptying my bladder.  I will be 8 weeks post op tomorrow and I am back my regular urination frequency.

Just a thought, maybe from the higher lack of testosterone you may have gotten &#34;girly bladder&#34;? At the start of HRT I noticed I initially had to go to the loo more before I had trained it back up again.
