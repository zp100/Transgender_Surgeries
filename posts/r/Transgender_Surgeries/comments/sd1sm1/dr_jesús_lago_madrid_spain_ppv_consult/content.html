There&#39;s not that much information about Dr. Lago for bottom surgery, and I&#39;d mainly know him from his great reputation for trans masc top surgery. There&#39;s have been a few people asking about him here, so I&#39;d like to share what I learned from a recent video consult for peritoneal pull through.
</p>
<p>
My video consult was booked two months out. He said that he&#39;d done around 100 vaginoplasties in total, and the person who I exchanged emails with had previously indicated that 1 in 8 are PPV/PPT or peritonization as it is on the website. PPV used to be the least common, but it has overtaken colovaginoplasty for 2nd place.
</p>
<p>
The surgery itself takes 8-9 hours, compared to PI which would be 6 hours. He uses 3 laparoscopic ports, two 5cm and one 1cm. Laser is advised, though there&#39;s not much risk of hair in the vagina with PPV. The catheter will be in place for a week.
</p>
<p>
In terms of practicalities, it is informed consent. No medical tests are required before travelling, other than whatever might be required for COVID. You&#39;ll have to stay in the area for 4 weeks. He is willing to fill out forms for insurance. He&#39;s currently booking about 2 months out.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s results and a bit more information on the website.

Hey, I&#39;m curious about your experience with him and also whether you are happy with the aesthetics of your result. Were the staff in the hospital nice? Did they provide pain relief without issues? How was recovery?

Heyy! The overall experience was good, Lago is defo a doc that knows his stuff and he‚Äôs also SO calm, you literally cannot feel unsafe or like anything is gonna go wrong tbh. The aesthetic of it is okay I would say. Not rly elaborate, but rather more ‚ÄúBarbie like‚Äù üòÖ, if that makes sense (which is kinda what I wanted too, rather than having big/defined labia etc). Everything works perfectly and the staff at the hospital was mostly amazing. There were one or two ppl who were‚Ä¶okay, but overall I got no major complaints rly.  You get pain killers thru IV at first and then you are prescribed paracetamol and another thing which I completely forgot what it‚Äôs called üòÖ The recovery was pretty fast for me: at first it‚Äôs kinda scary cuz it feels like you‚Äôll never be back to ‚Äúnormality‚Äù, but after a couple of weeks things start getting increasingly better and within a month I was able to walk and do staff as normal almost and similarly also my friends who did it around the same time as me, so ya, pretty good!  Anything else, lmk x

Hmm probably. I mean, ideally theres a couple others that i would‚Äôve considered and initially I was set to go to Thailand - as it is more renowned. But if I had known about Lago and the results were going to be the same, then yes, 100%

Hi, I‚Äôm considering Dr. Lago and have a question. When looking at his results on his website and twitter there are a lot of vaginas where there‚Äôs this inflamed redness inside. When I asked the clinic they told me it is mucosa that is left inside the vagina but that can be removed. Is this something that you experienced or experience?

I‚Äôve attached a twitter link of what I mean. I‚Äôm not entirely sure what it is but the bright red inflammation that is internal kind of stresses me out.

Thanks! Really helpful. I&#39;m looking at PPV with Lago as he is closer than Thailand and also cheaper. Any one else with info, please share ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

also has some information. I&#39;d suggest booking a consult if you&#39;re planning on going with him, they&#39;re free. As you&#39;re in the UK you should also probably also join the unofficial Facebook group, though it&#39;s largely trans masc.

From what he said, no reports are needed. It&#39;s pure informed consent. I was quite surprised.

I have no idea. They pushed to get a consult when I asked a simple question over email, so you&#39;ll probably need for a consult to find out.
