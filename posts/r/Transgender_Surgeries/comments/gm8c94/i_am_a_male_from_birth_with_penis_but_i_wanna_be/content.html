Hello everyone! I am a male from birth with penis. And I wanna stay male. But I wanna be male with vagina. I don&#39;t wanna boobs or girl body. I do not want to undergo hormone therapy so that she changes my body. I apologize for the details, I do not want the testicles removed, because they have an important production of male hormones. Is an operation to change the penis into the vagina with the preservation of the testicles possible to maintain hormonal levels? I mean, is it possible to hide the testicles in the large labia of the new vagina? Or hide them in another place so that they continue the functionality. What should I do? I do not want to be a woman, I do not want to take hormones for a change, but I want myself a vagina instead of a penis. That is, I feel like a man completely, and I want to remain a man, but I want to have a vagina instead of a penis. I&#39;m gay.

First of all, it&#39;s totally valid to experience dysphoria over your genitals regardless of your presentation. I&#39;m the same way where I was born male, and remain masculine in presentation, and I was able to make this transition. Dysphoria manifests in many different ways. Many trans people care deeply about the social presentation, but don&#39;t care much about changing their genitals. The inverse is just as valid. It&#39;s just a bit rarer.
</p>
<p>
I have heard of the possibility of moving the testes inside, but that can cause a lot of health issues, especially risk of testicular cancer. Usually, the solution is to remove the testes as usual and take testosterone to retain a similar hormone level. You&#39;d simply start T after surgery, and it would be no different from a man who lost his testes for some other reason. That&#39;s what I did, and I&#39;ve been very happy with the results. I&#39;d recommend that over risking things like cancer from making them internal, since taking T is pretty easy.
</p>
<p>
Nothing about the surgery requires estrogen, so the only road blocks to this kind of nonbinary transition is finding a supportive therapist and surgeon. How easy that is varies based on region. I&#39;m in a fairly progressive area in the US and I only had a bit more difficulty getting things covered and moving along, but I know others have struggled here since so much depends on what insurance you have. Some places in Europe, it&#39;s nearly impossible because the national health services don&#39;t accept nonbinary trans people, and alternatives aren&#39;t readily available outside travel. I don&#39;t know about Egypt.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, as you&#39;re seeing, the trans community isn&#39;t always accepting of nonbinary trans people. You aren&#39;t alone, though. I&#39;ve met dozens of nonbinary people who experience dysphoria over their genitals while being happy with their presentation. There&#39;s a chat here on Reddit dedicated to exchanging support and information for this specific path that has over thirty people in it. Several of us are post-op, and many are somewhere between their first therapist appointment and surgery.
</p>
<p>
If this is something you want, you can and should pursue it. The first step is the same for any transition, though: find a therapist experienced in trans care. You&#39;ll want to be a bit picky and make sure they&#39;re nonbinary friendly. Being sex and kink positive are also good signs they won&#39;t reject you for not being the cookie cutter binary trans that many people expect.

I am very grateful to you for such a detailed answer!=))) I try to cope with dysphoria, but ideally I see myself with the vagina and not with the penis. It&#39;s important for me. Forgive me for such possibly personal questions, but I have to ask them. And how often is taking testosterone in everyday life? And do you feel during sex after such an operation? I just have an idea how a standard operation is performed, but after looking at the results in this thread, I saw many unsuccessful operations and unsuccessful results. This is a little scary. Do I understand correctly that sensitivity is maintained by removing the head of the penis in the form of a clitoris? Thank you for your reply in advance, and I&#39;m sorry if I offended you with questions or embarrassed you!=)))

I take testosterone daily using a topical gel every morning. Injections only have to be done every two weeks, but I couldn&#39;t handle using the needle myself.
</p>
<p>
My sensation is great. I have no complaints about that side of things. I&#39;ve been unlucky and I&#39;ve had to deal with some complications, which made things take longer than I would have liked, but I&#39;m in the final stretch of healing, my doctors have worked hard to take care of me (and follow up stuff has been covered by insurance with zero issue), and it&#39;s been totally worth it, despite the extra challenges. And yes, they do create a clitoris using the glans of the penis.
</p>
<p>
Complications happen, but serious issues are rare, and in my experience, surgeons and doctors work hard to address any issues that do arise. As far as surgeries go, this one is actually less invasive than many, since most of what&#39;s being changed is at the surface. What kind of risk actually exists is a discussion best left between you and your surgeon, since the specifics will depend on them and their experience. That discussion is far better than looking up horror stories online, since you will find plenty if you look, with little indication of how common they are. The side you don&#39;t hear is the many successes, especially since trans people tend not to talk about the surgery much in my experience, except the negative. Granted, I don&#39;t think I ever ran into this particular subreddit before.

I don&#39;t think so. It&#39;s a group focused on dysphoria and surgery for AMAB people, rather than a general group for nonbinary trans people, so I don&#39;t think most of the discussion would be relevant to them. Though if someone is AFAB and in a similar situation where they have dysphoria only for specific things, they&#39;re just as valid. I just don&#39;t think discussions about tucking and vaginoplasties would be very helpful.

There&#39;s a few here, but fairly out numbered by AMAB. It does seem to be increasing over time though. There&#39;s some ftm groups on reddit.

There are several surgeons offering what you are looking for, with one exception: I don&#39;t know of any that would preserve your testicles during the procedure. Most of the folks who have had this done have either not taken any hormones (dangerous) or have started testosterone injections after surgery. That said, there may be someone out there that can preserve the testes.
</p>
<p>
If you pursue this surgery, you will be held to the same psychological assessments required of folks who are getting surgery for transition purposes, even though, as you have stated, you do not wish to transition. It is a standard. This may require you to find a supportive therapist which will likely be the hard part of your journey. Suggestion would be to search for non-binary supportive therapists.

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily a fair interpretation. Nothing about their post suggested to me that their being gay was tied to the desire to have a vagina. In fact, it would make it less likely for gay men to be attracted to OP.

What you are asking is possible, but not common and you’ll probably find it more difficult to get than if you were the typical trans person.  Look in the wiki here for related information

I’m sorry you’re getting so many negative comments.  Your body is YOURS to do what you want with, and if you feel that having a vagina and not having a penis but keeping your testicles for testosterone production would be right for you, you should be free to pursue this.  I don’t know if any doctors have done this specific thing before though, so you would likely be taking a significant risk.  You’d also likely be significantly reducing your dating pool, but there would probably still be some interested people.  As for the logistics of if it would work, I have heard that it may be possible for the testicles to be put up into the abdomen (I think I briefly saw something in the wiki about this).  With your testicles safely stored up there, you could probably just have a fairly traditional srs at that point and have “female-looking“ genitalia.

I&#39;m not troll. It is really important question for me. I did not want to offend anyone and hoped that here I would find at least some understanding, but a lot of answers also stigmatized here, apparently. So much for tolerance.

I&#39;m in a similar situation to OP, and my therapist supports my transition. Why is your first reaction to invalidate someone with an experience you&#39;re unfamiliar with?

I&#39;m approved for the Suporn Clinic and it seems likely that insurance will partially reimburse me for it. Even considering all the barriers, why should someone be greeted with accusations of being a troll or mentally unwell for being honest about their dysphoria?

Someone not understanding the fine details of surgery isn&#39;t a reason to accuse then of being a troll, say they have issues, or declare their dysphoria invalid. Plus, if this is your first experience with someone who clearly made an account specifically to ask questions about trans issues safely without association to themselves, you haven&#39;t been paying attention, since that&#39;s very common.
</p>
<p>
People in the trans community, especially those just starting to figure things out, are very vulnerable. You shouldn&#39;t jump to negative conclusions like this just because someone is interested in something that isn&#39;t your cookie cutter vision of the only way to transition. I&#39;ve talked to many nonbinary trans people who have been hurt by this kind of attitude, and it can be very damaging to have not only transphobic people be hostile, but other trans people as well.
</p>
<p>
So try kindness first. Worst case scenario, you say some nice things to a troll. Oh no. You could also just not make the negative comment. At least you&#39;ll avoid scaring people away from an important positive change in their life. If it&#39;s not actually for them, that&#39;s something best discovered with a therapist, not by random hostile people on the internet.

This is a remarkably close-minded response from a member of a marginalized group that knows all too well what it feels like to have something you know about yourself rejected out of hand.

I feel the same way so it&#39;s normal for me, like some other (supportive) comments have stated you would talk to doctors first and figure out the best course of action for you depending on what you want to do with your body. The surgery you suggested is possible and can be done.
</p>
<p>
Do you have any ways to alleviate your dysphoria in the meantime?

I&#39;ve seen a few men on pornhub who have had a neovagina created but still present as male. It&#39;s definitely doable. Just give it a lot of thought because it is a hell of a major operation and there is a lot that goes into recovery. You also might have dilation difficulties etc.
</p>
<p>
As for preserving testicles, I&#39;ve not seen that. Labia with a testicle in it, will still probably just look like a testicle. Nothing wrong with that though.
</p>
<p>
You could just go on testosterone like many transgender men do. There are loads of gay guys who are cool with men with vaginas, so that wouldn&#39;t be too much of an issue.
