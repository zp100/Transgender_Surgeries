That could be your nerves healing. Sharp stabbing pains are common as your nerves reconnect and regrow.

I am getting this jolts too. My doctor told me it’s the nerves regrowing and the internal swelling radiating the pain. Take Tylenol and ibuprofen every 3 hours alternating them.

Thanks everyone for the advice. I spoke to the surgical team and went to my gp. I was given painkillers and neuropathic medication for nerve pain. also antibiotics for a UTI :/

Might be the sharp ends of sutures sticking out, and into something.

That&#39;s a great point actually. There are no visible suture ends, and none I can feel - but I still have some swelling and inflammation, so it could potentially be internal stitches working out?

Early on, I had pain in one side of my labia around the same area you described, and my surgeon and I determined that it was indeed one of the internal sutures jabbing the nearby flesh. It went away after a couple weeks, but it was annoying while it lasted.

Yeah this sounds like stitches they aren&#39;t always in visible suture lines the stitches are often deeper and adjacent to visible lines.

I agree that it sounds like nerve pain. Did your surgeon prescribe gabapentin?

Listen to your surgeon. Totally normal. We’ve all gotten them post op. I had almost full sensation after surgery as well and got them.
</p>
<p>
Nothing to worry about. Truly.

I&#39;m 8-months post-op and still get varying waves of pain now and again. More frequent when really pushing dilation(having set backs). If it feels poky then maybe stitches working their way to the surface otherwise I&#39;d say nerves. In my experience nerves tend to have more spread-out and last longer starting with initial sharp pain but less localized while stitches are usually random sharp twitches that dissipate quickly.

This sounds like nerve pain. I remember it well. It was like brief lightning bolts through my new vulva. Went on for a couple of months.
</p>
<p>
I got relief from Δ-8 CBD gummies. Shut the pain right down.

I dealt with the same thing. Generally pain was 2-3 but occasionally I&#39;d get a 5-6 &#34;spike&#34; in my Labia. It was about once an hour around the first month post-op, and gradually became less frequent. It was always on my left side and that side was tender until around month 3 post-op. Now it is tender but only when compared to my right side which feels like it can take a beating.
