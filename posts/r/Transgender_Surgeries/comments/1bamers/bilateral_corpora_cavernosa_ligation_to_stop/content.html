Hi everybody! I&#39;m Jesse, nonbinary AMAB (they/them). Next week, I&#39;m going to be getting bilateral corpora cavernosa ligation (BCCL) surgery in order to stop erections.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to share this because there really isn&#39;t a lot of information about this procedure online, and I want to help other people who might be in the same situation as me.
</p>
<p>
Why I&#39;m getting the surgery:
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m nonbinary and don&#39;t want erections anymore. Normally, to stop or reduce erections you take HRT, which lowers your testosterone, which reduces erections. However, I don&#39;t want to take HRT because I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m mtf, and I don&#39;t want the other side effects (like boobs).
</p>
<p>
How the surgery works:
</p>
<p>
The corpora cavernosa are the two spongy chambers that run along the length of the penis and into the pelvis. During arousal, they fill up with blood which causes the firmness in erections. Ligating, or tying them off, prevents them from filling with blood and stops erections.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon said this procedure is actually a common step in nullification surgeries, and is pretty easy by itself.
</p>
<p>
Probably FAQ:
</p>
<p>
Q: Is it permanent?
</p>
<p>
A: Yes.
</p>
<p>
Q: Is there any chance of nerve damage?
</p>
<p>
A: I asked my surgeon this, they said it&#39;s very unlikely as the nerves to the penis are in a completely separate location from where the corpora ligation will be.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me any questions!
</p>
<p>

Alright, sorry if this is a bad question, but I plan on taking HRT, and I want to know one thing: can you still orgasm without erections?

I am m2f on HRT for 2yr now and 56yo and I can answer that question for you.
<br>
Yes. My she pee was crushed in a logging accident in 2015 that damaged these sponges op is talking about and I was no longer able to get erections and still can&#39;t now Thank goodness,
</p>
<p>
I was told back then I would have to have implants and even though I wasn&#39;t out back then I new I wanted vaginaoplasty do I declined having anything done.
</p>
<p>
I currently have the best feeling orgasams I have ever experienced in my life and I have had a bunch in 56yr.
</p>
<p>
I finally get my dream to come true and have my bottom surgery in 43 more days üôè.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes Emily ü§ó ‚ù§Ô∏è

(someone pls correct anything i say thats wrong) Sex is actually very much a psychological thing. Obviously physical stimulation often plays a big role in it, but so much of it is psychological in nature that there are people who can experience orgasms without stimulating their glans penis or clitoris (e.g. anal stimulation, nipple stimulation). As such, there should be no reason an erection is necessary for orgasm.

That&#39;s very interesting! I&#39;m MtF and on HRT but still get erections pretty easily. I have really bad bottom dysphoria especially around erections so the procedure you&#39;re describing would have been a really really good option if I didn&#39;t want SRS or had to wait a lot longer than I&#39;ve had to.
</p>
<p>
Do you know if it&#39;s an issue to do this before bottom surgery i.e. if someone has to wait several years for SRS and wants erections gone in the meantime?

I am not a doctor, but I imagine that would depend on the type of SRS since I know some do penile inversion.

Very much incorrect. I ha e very well suppressed t and high e for 2 yrs now. I still get them from time to time (even morning ones sporadically). I asked my doc about this specific topic and they confirmed that erections without mechanical help may still happen.

My T levels are around 15-20 and my E is well over 300. To be clear, its only from actual stimulation or arousal that it happens, not just randomly. Apparently some people are &#34;use or lose it&#34; from day 1 and for some like me it just won&#39;t go away.

You say usually but my experience has been the exact opposite. Myself, and two past partners can easily achieve erections despite very low tesyosterone.

After my orchiectomy I played with different amounts and types of hormones.  I finally decided that I didn‚Äôt like the way testosterone made me feel and do.  I lived twenty years without any supplemental hormones.  I had regular doctor visits and had yearly bone density tests.  He said that not taking hormones made me the same as woman after a hysterectomy or after menopause.

My penis has shrunk so much that it inverts when I lay down.  I have not had an erection since about two weeks after my orchiectomy.  I did experiment to have an occasional erection for my wife with Cialis and Viagra but they didn‚Äôt work.  I found that penile injections of Trimix gave me the hardest and longest erections in my life for two hours. If you vary the dose to change the duration.  My doctor said that this is what the porn stars use.  I don‚Äôt use this anymore but twenty years ago I tried it for my wife.  I have not had an erection since.

<p>
Does it only work for two hours, or does it last for a while if you get an erection again? I&#39;m about to start hrt and want to know all the various ways i can prevent atrophy and loss of libido, such as cialis, etc.

It is dose dependent from minutes to four hours or more.  I had experimented with my dose and at five hours went to the emergency room where they injected my penis with neo-synepherine to stop it..

HRT doesn&#39;t stop erections, so this is potentially useful for people on HRT, and even those who had surgery and still have problems with erectile tissue

Can you post it publicly sometime? There‚Äôs bound to be others it would help.
</p>
<p>
This kind of procedure has been discussed once here before, though it sounds slightly different

I know you&#39;re not OP but I&#39;ve been desperately looking for answers and information about this operation and I was curious if you&#39;re able to share any information about getting this procedure done. Do I contact any urologist?

No a doctor myself, but it sounds like its technically easy. Presumably any urologist could do it. I think the main issue would be finding who who is willing to do it. I&#39;d start with surgeons who deal with trans people already.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s also a number of other less common surgeries listed in the wiki, such as Perineal Urethrostomy/Urethral Reroute.

I&#39;m planning on doing a follow up post post-op, and I&#39;ll include more info in that one.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, I would encourage people to talk to surgeons that perform nullifications.

dm&#39;d! I didn&#39;t get insurance coverage as my insurance requires 6 months of HRT to cover any amount of SRS.

Are you thinking of doing nullification in the future or any other bottom surgery?

Nope! I&#39;m quite happy with how everything works, except erections.

Interesting I guess after surgery, you&#39;ll climax while limp since you are only going to lose the ability to have erections and nothing else?

Hey OP, I&#39;ve been looking everywhere for information on this surgery! I&#39;m an asexual trans woman who would really appreciate it if you could share information with me about this surgery such as who you have to speak to in order to schedule such a procedure.

I used transhealthcare.org to look up surgeons that perform nullifications. When I found a surgeon I thought looked good (a lot of good reviews, near me), I scheduled an initial appointment and explained my situation to them (nb, don&#39;t want erections, etc). Before my appointment, I didn&#39;t even know BCCL was a thing. My surgeon actually suggested it!

I have no idea why I&#39;d ever need to know anything about the procedure, but hey, I&#39;m glad to learn something new! Thanks for sharing! I&#39;m sure there are people out there who would benefit from knowing this exists, too. I&#39;m m really only commenting to push this into the algorithm as much as possible.

One slightly wrong information here: you definitely can have erections without T.
