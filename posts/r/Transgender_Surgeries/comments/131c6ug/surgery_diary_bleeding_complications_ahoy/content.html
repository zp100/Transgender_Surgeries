I haven‚Äôt updated my progress like I planned in a bit because I went through surgical complications starting 4/13 the day after having my packing removed.
</p>
<p>
I was standing in the shower and looked down and the entire floor was bright red. I called the surgical staff and was told to put pressure on it and if it didn‚Äôt stop to call 911. Sadly I started to pass out and the bleeding didn‚Äôt stop so we had to call 911. 911 had me go on the floor legs raised which allowed the bleeding to kind of stop. When I get to the ER they examine me and the bleeding is happening on and off. I also can‚Äôt pee anymore. The ER staff calls urology to try and recath me but they failed. Thanks to this I start bleeding everywhere again. They quickly move me to trauma ward where I‚Äôm bleeding all over the bed and floor. The surgical fellowship on call comes and adds some sutures while urology actually manages to caths me. I lost a lot of blood between the ER and trauma ward. After about 8 hours in the ER I get to go to recovery where they transfuse me with 4 bags of blood. Sadly over the next two nights I continue to hemorrhage hematoma‚Äôs. At this point it is Saturday morning and Dr Ting and Horesh make the call to bring me to the OR for exploratory surgery to try and find why I‚Äôm still bleeding. Unfortunately Dr Avanessian is on vacation so Dr Horresh will be performing the surgery. Luckily he‚Äôs a fantastic surgeon and does a great job. I lose more blood during surgery and I get 2 more bags of blood transfused during this time. They find some internal bleeding in my canal and add 3 stitches. Dr Horesh notes that the hematomas were between the bleed and grafts so the grafts were at risk. I spend the night in the ICU with a kinked catheter because they installed the wound vac wrong and that caused massive bladder pain because I wasn‚Äôt being emptied (I had 2L of urine in me), and then spend 1 more night in recovery where the wound vac failed and had to be removed and then I‚Äôm discharged. I then had to stew in my own fluids with packing and a compression dressing for 2 days after that before I was able to see Dr Avanessian. Sadly, as she takes my packing out my grafts come with it. She says they‚Äôre all nonviable and dead and cuts them out at this point. She tells me it‚Äôs unfortunate but should not impact my recovery.

At this point I‚Äôm doing pretty well. Dilation is going well (I‚Äôm on green) and pain is manageable. I have some separation on my left labia I‚Äôm concerned about and I‚Äôm concerned for the future of my canal but I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic that the worst is behind me. Just figured it‚Äôd be good to share my complication story. If anyone has questions I‚Äôm happy to answer them.

Very sorry this happened to you, and very happy you took it seriously and got help right away. This is why it is essential to have someone with you after surgery during the acute healing phase, and I‚Äôm so glad it sounds like you did. Very glad they were able to save you, and I‚Äôm sure they will be able to address any repair work later. Get well soon!
