It&#39;s been 6 months and I&#39;m upset with the amount of volume under my chin. What I got done: Brow bone shave, hairline advancement, brow lift, fat graft to the cheeks, closed rhinoplasty (dorsal hump shave) and a genioplasty. I know that overtime all the swelling gravitates towards the bottom of the face and on top of that I did have a chin augmentation so that also plays a part in the swelling. But I can&#39;t find good references to gauge if my swelling is abnormal or not. It hasn&#39;t gone down much in the last three months and I feel like buzz lightyear like it makes the bottom of my face look very bulky. Should I be worried?

Swelling in my chin and jaw didn&#39;t fully dissipate until after a year - amazingly.

Iâ€™m post op 3 weeks and feel your frustration but I probably need more patience. Curious about different or any type of massage or tissue mobilisation that could help from other people reading here. I know this area is very sensitive to bone manipulation. I swell a lot in the chin even from electrolysis. My doctors post operative advice and documentation also said these areas can take a long time to resolve.
