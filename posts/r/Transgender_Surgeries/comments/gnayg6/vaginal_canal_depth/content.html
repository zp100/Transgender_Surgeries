Hi, I recently had srs like 9 days ago and started dilating 3 days ago and I&#39;m just worried the depths I got Is too short at around 9-10 cm so I&#39;m just worried if it&#39;s too short. What&#39;s the typical depth for vaginoplasty? From what I&#39;ve read it&#39;s like 12-15 cm and if that&#39;s true I dont know what to do.
</p>
<p>
P.s. I know it takes time to heal and its only been 9 days but I&#39;m also the worrying type üòÖ but my clitoris is almost completely black, like maybe 95% of it and I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t get any sensation in it. Is this normal?
</p>

What brand dilators ? (and more specifically which diameter, or color).
</p>
<p>
I started out with the Soul Source GRS #1 purple, and had problems. A youtube video tipped me off to get a smaller diameter (the petite set) which resolved the issues I was having. Now, I&#39;m 15-16 months out, and depth has stabilized. Depth is inversely proportional to the girth of the dilator (IOW, the narrow ones can go deeper than the larger diameter). My neo-vagina is somewhat tapered.
</p>
<p>
There is one other detail about depth (and your perception of it) ‚Ä¶ perceived depth has a relationship to how wide your thighs are spread. The wider your thighs, the more the muscle mass pulls back towards the hard bottom (the pelvic bone). The difference is not huge, but there is an effect that I can tell. My deepest depth (on the dilator dots) is with my legs together, and pointing towards the bottom of the bed.

I dont know what brand, I just got a set of 3 silicone dilators all white, 15 cm in length and 20mm, 25mm, 30mm sizes. Plain and simple ones. Was disappointed I didnt get the colorful ones hehe. I&#39;m using the 25mm as the 20mm is just to start with if it&#39;s too tight. I&#39;ll be doing that for a bit before I try out the 30mm but after 8 weeks I can buy any hard plastic ones I&#39;d like to use. But even with the smallest one (20mm) I still get the same depth around 10 cm but I&#39;m also afraid to push in too far just in case something goes wrong. Actually the instructions on which size to use when has been a bit unclear to me aswell but my entire transcare the past 10 years have been hell here in Sweden for me.

The Soul Source dilators are (measured at 5th dot) petite set (21mm, 24mm). regular set (28mm, 31mm, 34mm, 37mm). Those are diameters, and taper towards the insertion end. 1st dot is 103-106mm from tip, 5th dot is 141-144mm from insertion tip.
</p>
<p>
In the beginning, 28mm was too wide, so I had to use 21mm and 24mm. Now, at a year plus, I can get all the way up to 37mm.

Mines are the same diameter from end to end so it doesn&#39;t get wider. But with time, do you increase the dots too? From the sounds of it I&#39;m at dot 1, will I be able to get to dot 5 eventually with practise ? I might need to order the soul source.

During initial healing, there was quite a bit of swelling. As the muscles/tissue healed, it became somewhat easier. I started with the smaller diameters, and worked up to the largest one. I&#39;m thinking it was 5 months +/- before I could even try the large one. At that point the majority of the swelling was gone. I was released by the surgeon at 7.5 months. Hope this gives you some reference points.
</p>
<p>
Yes, depth slowly came up, because the swelling was keeping the dilator from reaching the bottom. The surgeon&#39;s PA told me my objective was 3-dots. They were very happy when I reached that (with regular #1). I can now get about 4.5 dots with regular #1. With the large dilator, regular #4, It only goes to about 3rd dot. This has to do with the tapering of the neo-vagina, and the graduated diameter of the dilator. You reach a point where things give this much, and no more (without possibly causing tissue harm).

As I&#39;m only 10 days post up im still pretty swollen and sore so I just need to calm my mind a bit and let my body do the healing.  I&#39;ll have a second surgery in 3 months and I can consult my surgeon then if needed but until then just deep breaths üòÖ Thank you for your replies, it did help me ‚ù§

It‚Äôs below average, unless you‚Äôve had surgery in Europe where it seems to be common. Most of the posters here are not from these European surgeons.

<p>
If it turns out to be a problem it is possible to increase depth, but it‚Äôs another big surgery and expensive.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôll try to add more to the wiki on this.
</p>
<p>
Who was your surgeon and what do they say about it?

My surgeon was Gunnar Kratz in Link√∂ping, Sweden. I looked up the link you sent me and found another one who had surgery with Gunnar, had around the same depth as me. I&#39;ll just give it time to heal and hope  for the best as its only been 10 days post op. Thank you for your reply
