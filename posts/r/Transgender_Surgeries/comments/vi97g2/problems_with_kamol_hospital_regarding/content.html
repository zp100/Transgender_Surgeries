As the title states, I am having problems with Kamol Hospital.
</p>
<p>
I contacted them to cancel my surgery and requested a refund and they have not responded. They have refused to reply to any emails I&#39;ve sent.
</p>
<p>
I contacted their person Darcie Silver 4 days ago my time and have heard nothing back. I sent an email to their customer care email address yesterday and still heard nothing back. I even used their contact form on their website yesterday and still nothing.
</p>
<p>
If you are trying to cancel a surgical date with them and trying to get a refund, you won&#39;t get your money back and you also will not get any confirmation that your surgery has been cancelled.
</p>
<p>
Kamol Hospital doesn&#39;t want to give you a refund and will cut all contact with you the moment you ask to cancel the surgery and request a refund on your deposit.
</p>
<p>
I wish I had never given them any money for surgery. Please avoid Kamol Hospital and their shady business practices at all costs.

Ok people I am still having problems with Kamol Hospital. It has now been 2 months. They &#34;tried&#34; to send me the money but I believe that they screwed it up on purpose. The contact there I have had to literally make threats to get them to do anything. I just got a message back saying they sent it again but nothing has come through. If it was sent it would have ended up in my bank account but nothing has happened.
</p>
<p>
Please, please stay away from Kamol Hospital due to shady business practices and taking way too long to get money returned.
</p>
<p>
Even Krystal-Garven-2 had issues with this. So this is my update.

You could try posting in the Facebook groups. They are far more active there and might be more inclined to respond.

I tried contacting Darcie via Whatsapp directly. She got my message because it was left on read and she has not responded.
</p>
<p>
What FB groups do you know they are active on?

There’s a couple of main surgery groups.

Thanks for those. I tried them but I am not getting any responses from Kamol Hospital or Darci Silver their coordinator.
</p>
<p>
I think I am never going to get that money back and I won&#39;t get a confirmation of cancellation either.

Did you make a public post like this one? It looks really bad if they just ignore it, and you can always make a comment on Facebook when someone asks about them. Hopefully they won’t keep ignoring it.

I did and it forced them to respond. I am getting a refund now but only because I forced their hand.

If you used a credit card, you can dispute the charge!

Usually if you are outside the country they require a wire transfer before you even arrive in the country. Credit card doesn&#39;t work. I got the money back eventually but it was a major fight to get it back. Don&#39;t go to Kamol if you can avoid it.

Had to threaten them to badmouth them everywhere online to get a refund myself. You might have to go that route.

I did but it took me keeping on them and giving them a timeline. Initially I was told I would get it back in a couple of days. They sent it to my bank the wrong way. I told them that and then I was told I would get it in a week. Waited a week nothing.
</p>
<p>
So I finally told them &#34;If I don&#39;t have my money by the end of this week, I will be going on every social media site and also talking to other trans people via word of mouth and badmouthing them everywhere&#34;. Finally got my money back.
</p>
<p>
But it took over a month to get it back.
