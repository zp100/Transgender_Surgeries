It&#39;s been a bit more than two years since the trans clinic in Vancouver opened, so I was just wondering if anyone has had any experience with Dr Genoway getting SRS, specifically vaginoplasty and how their surgery went. Thanks!

I was her second patient I believe. Her and Dr Kavanaugh are amazing and super compassionate. I had issues with my grafts and lost all my depth but they tried their hardest to save them, it was just an unfortunate situation. I don&#39;t think anyone else has had that issue so far from what I&#39;ve heard, my surgery was March 2020 so there&#39;s been a lot of patients since me. I could fit the orange dilator to the fullest before complications arose. My aesthetic is beautiful and I couldn&#39;t have asked for better appearance wise. The entire staff there is amazing, I&#39;m currently going over options with them for a revision to create a new canal.

I wanted to say a) I&#39;m sorry to hear you had complications, b)I hope your revisions go well, and c) thank you SO much for responding to this. I think there are a LOT of us sitting on waiting lists for Vancouver, with virtually NO news anywhere for us to see what we&#39;re getting into. So yeah, thanks.

Sorry, I&#39;m not on here much! Everything has healed really well, and my scars are very hard to see unless you know they&#39;re there. Still waiting on a revision, but it will likely need to wait at least a year or so as my wedding is this year, and then I start uni in the fall so not really any time to recover :/

A friend is going next week for bottom surgery but, other than that, I don&#39;t know much.
