I&#39;m not sure who your surgeon is, or where you&#39;ll be but this what Chett sends you back with after your stay in the clinic for SRS:
</p>
<p>
1 pack of Disposable gloves
</p>
<p>
1 pack of baby wipes
</p>
<p>
2 packs of sanitary pads
</p>
<p>
6 tubes of Q-C lube
</p>
<p>
1 tube of anesthesic jelly
</p>
<p>
10 sheets of bed pads
</p>
<p>
1 Dilator bag
</p>
<p>
5 Dilators
</p>
<p>
1 Hand mirror
</p>
<p>
1 Gel bead donut pillow

I had surgery in July with Chet and didn&#39;t get any gloves. Luckily I brought some with me and as you need to finger yourself with lube before inserting the dilator I cut the three biggest fingers off the gloves to make the gloves last longer.

I vote to compile a list from everyone, including their suggestions from personal experience, and wiki it

Get some underwear you don’t mind ruining, and that is very roomy yet still able to compress a pad against your vulva when you pull them up. I chose some cotton brief style panties, a couple sizes larger than I normally wear.
</p>
<p>
Also get a couple packs of sleeping pads (infinity flex foam is best), a few packs of extra absorbent maxi pads with wings, and two large packs of extra long and wide panty liners (I like Kotex)
</p>
<p>
Get big bottles of quick release Tylenol and Advil (generic is fine too)
</p>
<p>
Get a showerhead that can detach and hold in you hand (I got one from a brand called Chrider on amazon for like $15), that also has a soft “spout” setting
</p>
<p>
Get a donut for sitting on, like memory foam (my surgeon recommended the brand Kieba) sit on it before surgery to break it in if you can

I went through about 6 packs of pads in 3 weeks.
<br>
Condoms make cleanup easier Baby change mat means the bed doesn’t get messy 2 tubes a week of KY.  Maybe more

For lube I think Slippery Stuff Gel is the absolute best, and it&#39;s pretty affordable. No glycerin (doesn&#39;t get sticky after a while), stays slick for a long time, and doesnt really have an odor. It was designed to not interfere with vaginal health, and it&#39;s
<em>
waaaay
</em>
better than KY, Astroglide, and pretty much any of the &#34;medical&#34; lubes out there. It&#39;s really thick and stays where you put it, but very slippery -- perfect for dilating. You can find 32oz on Amazon for around $25, so it&#39;s not terribly expensive for a top-quality lube.
</p>
<p>
I tried a bunch of different lubes for dilating, and Slippery Stuff Gel is by far my favorite. I&#39;ve gone through tons of it for both dilating and sex (it&#39;s awesome for sex too, BTW.) I kept going on about it at appointments, so my pelvic physical therapist decided to try it herself and now it&#39;s all she uses both at her private practice and at the hospital for hey post-op GRS patients.

Here are a number of lists that might help with any surgeon :
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/e6roo1/srs_with_dr_suporn_pdf_4th_edition/content.html" rel="nofollow">https://old.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/e6roo1/srs_with_dr_suporn_pdf_4th_edition/</a>
</p>
<p>
It may be necessary to make surgeon specific adaptions but a number of general hints might be useful.

Gel ice packs and ibuprofen, disposable perineal ice packs.  AZO or generic phenazopyridine for discomfort associated with the catheter. If you&#39;ve got long hair, some way to tie it up so it doesn&#39;t get matted and knotted since you won&#39;t be able to wash it for a week.  Think of a way to keep what you need as far off the ground as possible, as bending over is going to suck.
