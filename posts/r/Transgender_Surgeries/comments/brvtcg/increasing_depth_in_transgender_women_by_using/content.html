Dr. Powers is the absolute shit. Every time I see one of his posts, I&#39;m once again reminded how thankful I am that people like him exist.

Erm... wouldn’t that promote androgen hair growth in your vagina??? Not very nice to sort out if it does.

Pubic hair becomes androgenized - i.e. testosterone does the heavy lifting.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to growth too much androgens results in excessive hair growth.

I’m not sure either as not an expert but I’d want to find the answer before trying what’s suggested.

, would you mind elaborating on the use of testosterone on dilators a bit further.
</p>
<p>
How soon post-surgery would you start this, and when would you stop? What results have you seen, and in how and in how many patients? Anything that would be useful/interesting to know?
</p>
<p>
You said
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
0.5 % compounded T twice a week.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I assume its some kind of cream. How much of it would be applied to the dilator?

A gram is applied to the dilator. I never really have my patients stop it as it doesn&#39;t raise the systemic levels to anything noticeable but almost all of them see benefit from it (both pre and post-op)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d wait to start it post surgery until anything else could go in the vagina. If someone has suporn/chettawut style and the serrated scrotal skin is used for the canal I probably wouldn&#39;t be keen on putting anything against those wounds till they closed.

You don&#39;t have any data on how much depth is increased by?
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know about Chettawut but I think Suporn is a few months until its healed. This is from an interview, talking about lube
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I asked Dr Suporn about choosing a lube. He said to use water based lubes for the first 3 to 4 months, until the skin graft has healed. Silicone lubes don’t wash out and residual silicone can interfere with the healing of the skin graft. You can tell it’s healed when there’s no more discharge or bleeding.

It increases the strength of the tissue and also its elasticity. Depth would vary based on starting depth and how atrophied it was and so on. I couldn&#39;t conjecture how much.

Estrogen cream has also been shown to increase skin elasticity and thickness. Not sure which is more effective, but I would be concerned about side effects with testosterone. Change in smell, for example.

Penile atrophy is the result of not getting erections. Suffice to say this is a moot issue if one does not have a penis...
</p>
<p>
As a completely separate issue, estrogen is well known to increase skin elasticity.

What do you mean by &#34;needs&#34;? Testosterone causes all skin to thicken. Estrogen does as well.

That doesn&#39;t make sense for many reasons. Did you have skin problems after surgery?

I always wondered if T/DHT cream could increase clitoris size  as it does in FTMs. Not gonna be the one to test this though lol

I don&#39;t see that happening. It was already as big as its going to get before surgery.
