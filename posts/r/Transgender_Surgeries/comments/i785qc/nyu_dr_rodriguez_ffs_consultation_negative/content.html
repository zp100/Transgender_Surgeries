I just came out from a FFS consultation with Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez at NYU, and left with an overall negative experience.
</p>
<p>
He felt dismissive of my concerns, he claimed in his four years working with trans patients he has never had a complication (really? Not one complication or need for revision?), he was adamant of not showing any of his work (he completely talked down to me at just the suggestion), and gave me a long list of procedures he would do without giving me any reference to how that would look or what that would do.
</p>
<p>
For example, he suggested a procedure that would raise my eyebrows to make them look more feminine. I asked, couldn&#39;t my eyebrows be sculpted to be more feminine through electrolysis? He completely dismissed this idea, and pushed for me to have the procedure. I did not walk away at all feeling like he was concerned for my needs.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m honestly kinda shaken from the experience.

Any respectable surgeon will produce before and after photos when asked.

Being older, there has been a recent wave of people doing Trans surgeries.  Some get into it for the right reasons; others because we are known to pay cash.

No, there is suspiciously no information on this guy, even on the wiki. He refused to show me pictures of his work.

A whole 4 years?!... Maybe find a more experienced surgeon..  Maybe why he isn&#39;t forthcoming with any pictures of his work..
