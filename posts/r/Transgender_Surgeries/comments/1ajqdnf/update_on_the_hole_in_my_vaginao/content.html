It&#39;s probably true for Essen and Dr. Heß, Iknow several people,who got operated there that had similar issues, but they all got fixed up in a revision. It has probably to do with the technique they use there. His results are among the best you can get in Germany, but i&#39;ve personally decided against him, because this &#34;I  need 2 Surgeries for a finished result&#34; approach and the clinic organisation seems pretty chaotic. But like I said he&#39;s considered one of the best and the only other surgeons she could ask for a second opinion on this technique are on the other side of the country, so maybe look and wait...

I can see how it could be the technique. It depends on the stages, but I don’t think the two stage is a bad thing. My friend got a two stage from a surgeon in Oregon US who does a two stage where the second stage allows them to create labia minora after the initial surgery after 3 months.

Oh I didn&#39;t mean the two stage approach is inferior, I just decided against it for myself due to recovery times.

That will not heal by itself. Remember Doctors lie and is hard to find doctors you can trust. They are just talking advantage of this all transgender situation. It is sad but is true

This must be the dumbest thing I have ever read on this subreddit. Go on, do DIY SRS, I bet it&#39;s not as easy and you need a doc for it :)
</p>
<p>
Some doctors just have massive egos, but it&#39;s not because &#34;they&#39;re taking advantage of the transgender situation&#34;, you can find that in all medical field in my experience.

I was botched by Dr. O&#39;Brien Coon when I had vaginoplasty 5 failed surgeries and later on I was botched by Dr. Gabriel del corral when I had my FF. I have permanent nerve damage on my bottom lip it look horrible I try not to look myself in the mirror . I was their guinea pig it wasn&#39;t fair they train on me they lie telling me everything is ok when it wasn&#39;t. Life proof I was right

How were you “botched”? Considering surgery with DOC as well and haven’t heard negatives like this whatsoever.

Of course not maybe you are part of the doctor&#39;s team. I see a lot of comments on vaginoplasty or FF posts coming from same doctor who perform the surgery saying that it looks great but we all know is far away from being ok

This does not happen to “four out of five patients.” Wound separation is not uncommon, but this is not an expected complication. Did you have surgery in the US? I really hope your surgeon isn’t who I’m thinking it might be.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I see you are in Europe. I’m not too familiar with your medical system over there so I’m not really sure how to advise you. I would definitely get another opinion quickly.

I would try and get in touch with the Lubos Clinic if you can, this is neither normal nor does it happen to 4 out of 5 patients. I work at the Lubos Clinic and had the srs there, within the last 3 months we’ve only had this once. Besides that I wish the best for you.
