I have a couple of questions about your SRS (To be honest there are a lot of questions): What made you choose Dr. Suporn over other doctors (It&#39;s on my short list and I have doubts who to go with)? How has your recovery been so far? Do you recommend Dr. Suporn? How consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth currently? How was the dilation process during the recovery? Are you planning to have revision surgery? And if you have not undergone one, what would improve your result with one? (is a very good result, especially consider than you are only 2 months post op) How was your stay in Thailand (Chon Buri)? What was the aftercare like for Dr. Suporn and the clinic staff in general? And by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.

This is a lot of questions! I&#39;ll try my best to answer them:
</p>
<p>
I chose Dr. Suporn because I was convinced his technique is the best. He is extremely experienced, with over 4000 surgeries, and he is still writing papers and trying to improve. He is driven by passion. Additionally, the price for surgery is relatively low (compared to for example Europe) and the stay in Chon Buri can be long and they will give you daily follow up while you&#39;re there. I have not been disappointed with him and would wholeheartedly recommend him.
</p>
<p>
My recovery has been both easy and tough. Easy because I got through it with little pain and no major complications. Tough because I had smaller complications such as needing a catheter for an extended period, bleeding and granulation. I&#39;m feeling pretty good now and am almost back to normal. Dilations are a pain, but that is expected for month two and three.
</p>
<p>
I have had good sensitivity from the very start. I was only numb around the scars at the bottom. Now that&#39;s almost back to normal too. So I would say I have excellent sensitivity. I can also feel inside my vagina. I am happy with my cosmetics so far. I&#39;m going to have a cosmetic improvement (revision) in a year to fix my posterior commisure (at least). I went into the surgery expecting this as they will not fuse the commisure due to the need for dilation. I might also fix the anterior commisure which should give me a clitoral hood.
</p>
<p>
My vaginal depth is 18cm. It increased from the initial point at surgery of 17cm. Dilation is rough. I have to do them three times a day and I spend 1.5-2 hours on each session. This is expected in month two and three.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very happy with my stay in Thailand. The staff was nice and helpful. Chon Buri is a bit of a dump, but the people are really nice. Covid has made it difficult to do things outside, so I spent most of my time in the hotel with other patients.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend looking into the PDF posted
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fayd3p/srs_with_dr_suporn_pdf_5th_edition/">here
</a>
for a more comprehensive read about the process and stay.
</p>
<p>
And thank you. It has been the best decision for me.

How do you manage to make time for dilation? What if you could only dilate twice a day?

<p>
This is a good question. There&#39;s no window for reducing the number of dilations unless you have a very special recovery. Actually, you might even risk needing to increase to 4 dilations a day if you really struggle. Your depth might impact how difficult it is, and sometimes you can sacrifice some cm of depth for an easier dilation. It&#39;s impossible to tell how you will experience dilation, but you should prepare for it being tough and taking time. I find time because I have an understanding employer and good motivation. I know it&#39;s only temporary and once in a lifetime.

Hun so are you still at the hotel at two months? How long are you staying?
</p>
<p>
Or was your stay elongated because of complications?

This is absolutely false. Even two months in I can  tell it&#39;s highly usable just from dilation. I&#39;ve talked to a lot of post op women that all share this experience. Don&#39;t come posting fear mongering here. There are risks to this and any surgery, but they are far from common.

Thank you for sharing! We don&#39;t often see Suporn results from early in recovery. Your results already look great, so I can only imagine they&#39;ll look even better in a year. It&#39;s also nice to see an example of the Chonburi organ, and how much it blends into the rest of the vulva. I just have a few questions, if it&#39;s okay:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What made you choose Suporn over Bank?
</li>
<li>
I know you mentioned getting the posterior commissure, but are you planning on the anterior commissure at the same time?
</li>
<li>
Has there been anything about getting surgery with Suporn that you didn&#39;t like (in terms of results or in general).
</li>
<li>
Have you had any issues with erectile tissue? I&#39;ve heard that Suporn retains it and repositions it to more of a female position, but I&#39;m wondering what this actually means/feels like.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Good luck!!

I&#39;d like to take a better picture of the Chon Buri organ as it&#39;s not really visible, but I&#39;m not allowed to fully spread my labias yet. My description of it is a pink spongy wall with a shallow vertical crevice going from 5 mm above my urethra to my clitoris. It&#39;s not very distinct, so I wouldn&#39;t know it if I wasn&#39;t told.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Suporn has done over 4000 SRS and is the mentor. Bank is a viable option and the other girls I&#39;ve talked to are happy, but I felt safer with Suporn.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yes, I will probably do both. I will have to wait until the final result to know exactly what to do.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Nothing really worth mentioning. It&#39;s too early to complain about aestethics and functionality. Suporn&#39;s English could be better and he can sometimes be a bit difficult to understand. He can also seem a bit strict sometimes. But it really wasn&#39;t a big issue, and the staff is always there to help clear things up. I liked Suporn and I&#39;m grateful for what he did for me. Oh, I don&#39;t particularly like that the support from staff after going home is only through email. I also don&#39;t like how we have to get refills of our dilation supplies (lube, condoms, bed pads) ourselves after we are through the initial supply. But this is really nothing important.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I think it&#39;s too early to tell. I&#39;ve been trying to avoid arousal before today. I can&#39;t say anything has been problematic for me so far.

Yeah, i&#39;ve been a bit worried that the Chonburi organ would look weird, but from the ones I&#39;ve seen I don&#39;t think anyone would be able to tell unless they were familiar with Suporn&#39;s technique. I&#39;m also on the same page as you, I&#39;m planning on seeing Dr. Bank next year and I basically see it as a 2 stage surgery (even though I think they still produce some of the best one stage results, but why not shoot for gold?). Hope you have a speedy recovery!!

The commissures are where the labia minora meet. The anterior one is the clit hood and the posterior is at the base of the vulva. The posterior commissure revision involves bringing the labia together so they meet at the bottom, and the anterior one involves making the hood less wide, more like how it is in cis women. Hope this helps!

Hi sister! May I know for stage 2, do they need general anaesthesia  it or will be just only local?
</p>
<p>
As I am planning to have VFS after surgery, I am hoping there is no need any tube to my throat after my stage 1 surgery.

<p>
Than you üòä

Sorry for the late reply. I don&#39;t often log in. They first use numbing cream, then local anesthesia by injections. It&#39;s not very painful at all due to the numbing cream.

It cost me 650000 baht for the surgery (cosmetic improvement in a year included), and then the cost of traveling and living in Thailand.

Hotel is not included. You have to use their designated hotel, Rattanachol Hotel, which you book through the clinic or by yourself. There&#39;s a special rate for clinic patents: usually either 1100 baht or 1200 baht each night with breakfast included depending on the length of your stay.

What were their requirements for hair removal?
</p>
<p>
Suporn/Bank are on my short list if I can ever afford SRS, but I haven&#39;t been able to find answers to that anywhere and I know its something that needs to be started well in advance.

There are no requirements for hair removal. They advise against electrolysis before surgery. I have no hair inside my vaginal canal (I have observed it myself), but I do have hair in the crease between the labia minora and majora which is difficult to get to. Additionally, I have hair on the lower part of the vulva at the vaginal opening. You can have electrolysis on these areas after surgery. Additionally, you can use laser to reduce the number of hairs before surgery, although this will likely not remove them all. I&#39;ve used tweezers to remove some of the hair at the opening, but some of it is not so easy to get to.

Suporn seems to have recently changed his policy towards hair removal and now strongly recommends removal of hair on the perineum.  Ive just confirmed the date for my surgery confirmed with Dr bank. And this is from the detailed info they send you.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a fairly small area, albeit a sensitive one.

Hi, thank you for helping the community with your review ‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
I have a few questions:
</p>
<p>
1) Are those marks stretch marks that you have around your vagina and on your thighs? (I&#39;m not talking about the V scar, which is totally normal). And did you have those before surgery?
</p>
<p>
2) I want to go with Banks but I didn&#39;t know Suporn was still operating.. did you have the opportunity to see some Banks&#39;s patients at the hotel? How were the results compared to suporns?
</p>
<p>
3) Did you have the opportunity to meet girls that went there for revision (posterior anterior commissure, clitoris reposition...)?
</p>

Those are stretch marks from my first puberty. I&#39;ve had them long before the surgery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Most of the girls at the hotel were Banks&#39; patients. From what I&#39;ve seen, the results are comparable and I really can&#39;t see the distinction between the surgeon&#39;s skill and individual variation. But I am not an expert, so just go with the one that makes you feel the most comfortable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;ve not met anyone who had a revision yet, but I&#39;ve seen several here on Reddit. The results are usually good, and I went into the first surgery with a plan to have a revision too. I&#39;m now in the process of talking with the clinic to set a date and talking about what will be done.

I&#39;m booked in with Suporn this autumn. I did consider Dr Bank (who also seems excellent), but in the end I decided on the additional experience of Dr Suporn. That is a lovely natural looking result, and it&#39;s definitely put my mind at ease. How long was your surgery? üòä

Congratulations! I&#39;m sure you will be very pleased! I think the surgery lasted 5.5 hours, but I&#39;m not entirely sure. He puts over 400 stitches in there, so I&#39;m not surprised it takes a long time! They also take pictures from the surgery, which you can get. They are pretty graphic!

I‚Äôm booked with Bank for Sept and I‚Äôd be super happy to have these results at 2mo. I get the sense that sooo many patients end up wanting ant/post commissure revision. It‚Äôs just to be expected to some extent! Hopefully the granulation will resolve soon. :)

Oh, congratulations! You are in the best hands. Yes, which is probably the reason they include the cosmetic improvement (CI) in the price. When talking to Suporn, he mentions CI like it&#39;s part of the process. And to me it is. I went into the surgery expecting to do the CI to fix the commisure, as I already knew it was a limitation due to the dilation.

This is a method using scrotal grafts for the vaginal canal. Another characteristic is a second sexual sensate organ located in the vestibule of the vulva between the clitoris and the urethra. You can read more about it

Thank you! I am very happy so far. I think it looks good even though it&#39;s not finished healing. I&#39;m going for a cosmetic improvement in a year to fix things I&#39;m not so happy about, like the posterior commisure. Everything feels fine. I have 18 cm depth. I have sensation. It&#39;s too early to comment on the lubrication, but from what little I&#39;ve tried, I have enough lubrication to finger myself.

Hi, sorry if that sounds clueless, I‚Äôm considering Suporn as well, what is the posterior commisure, and why are you not happy with it? From what I can see your results look very satisfactory, congratulation. Also another question, what was the cost of the procedure with him? And was it performed by him or doctor Bank?

Suporn says about 90% of the granulation should disappear within 3 months. The rest he says will take up to a year. If it&#39;s not healed within a year, he will remove it during my cosmetic improvement. Removing large granulation is complicated as it requires a skin graft. I don&#39;t have any physical pain from my granulation, so I will wait for the cosmetic improvement. If it&#39;s too painful for you, you will need the graft (a small graft).

This is going to be different for everyone. I went in expecting torture and hell. I had read about how traumatizing it could be. Honestly, I have not experienced that at all and neither seem the other girls I was with. It&#39;s not been particularly painful. I stopped painkillers fairly early. The most difficult part has been constantly feeling sore and aching, and now lately, having painful dilations due to stretching the scar tissue. But taking painkillers helped a lot, so for me it&#39;s been pretty okay.
