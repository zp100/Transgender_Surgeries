Hi there! I&#39;m MtF and reviewing options for SRS now that I&#39;m closer to being ready for it. I was heavily considering Bowers a year or two ago because of her experience, positive results, and hybrid PI-PPT technique. However, looking at her again recently, I&#39;ve noticed a lot more negative experiences, complications, and controversies. I also can&#39;t seem to find any mention of her technique, and her website contains very evasive wording about what her technique actually is. All this is a bit of a red flag to me, but I still remember feelings about her being generally positive a few years back. So, to help clarify my confusion, I figured I&#39;d ask here: is she as bad as she currently seems?

She was initially my first choice. I did have my consultation with her. I chose not to go with her for a few reasons. First and foremost was her arrogance. I know that is something that is very common among plastic surgeons. My second concern was that she was completely and totally focused on the cosmetic side of things and not so much the functionality side of things. Thirdly was her billing and Wait list.

I ended up going with the team at University of Utah

I had a friend who had her operation with her. Didn&#39;t turn out well at all. Looked like a ⚾️ once she healed. Scared me away from Bowers. I&#39;m going to have mine done with Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langer.

There’s a new generation of surgeons in the USA and some of them are doing really great work. There’s been a very significant improvement in recent years.

An electrologist has told me that she finds Bowers&#39;s vaginas to be &#34;too small&#34;. I didn&#39;t ask for any elaboration, but now I&#39;m curious to know what she meant.

Go to Dr. Min Jun, Dr. BBL, or Dr. Zhao. For aesthetic as well as functionality. Or someone who trained with them.

There&#39;s many good surgeons not on that list and in social media circles. Don&#39;t let it decide on a surgeon.

I went to Thailand to have mine done. No pelvic scarring. New age technique looks natal. Wouldn&#39;t use a US surgeon if it was free.

Just had mine done with her. I have write ups here. I har a clitoral orgasm at 2 weeks. Full sensation at least on 1/2 of the depth canal.  No pelvic scaring or complications. She definitely has an ego and definitely talks about looks a lot.
