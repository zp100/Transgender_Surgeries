So I&#39;m starting to take the steps to having gcs and my Dr has suggested Dr. Mark Burke in Buffalo, I was wondering if any one has any real info about him or even experiences? I can&#39;t really seem to find much

I wouldnâ€™t... my councilor (Iâ€™m also in buffalo) has warned against it as this surgery is not his specialty and every patient of theirâ€™s who have gone to him has had complications. Common one they brought up lack of depth. To counter that, my endo did bring him up and he said nice things. Personally, Iâ€™m going to Mt Sinai as I want someone who specializes in this procedure.

Ah okay, I haven&#39;t been able to find much so was asking as my Dr said she had heard good things from other patients of hers that went through him, my first choice was Mt Sinai to begin with cuz there&#39;s a Dr there performing a newer way that gives natural lubrication which would be AMAZING to have to not worry about lube all the time

You really need to do more research and check credentials and experience level as well as available procedures. Sinai docs are very good as is program at NYU. Dr Ting at Sinai does Peritoneal Pull Through which does provide lubrication but can have issues. Regardless do your due diligence and IMO go with experience over price or convenience, I will. ðŸ˜·

Sinai does not do peritoneal pull through (a flap where the peritoneum is left attached to its blood supply) they currently do a graft (peritoneum is detached and re-attached) of peritoneal tissue called the tunica vaginalis which is in the scrotum. They used to do a graft of peritoneal tissue taken from the abdomen, but seem to be getting away from this. NYU does a peritoneal flap from the abdomen.

According to several sites he doe perform both My understanding is that PPT as well as peritoneal flap of tissue harvested from abdomen and also from tunica can be done by Ting. Depends on pt. Drs BBL and Wittenberg and a few others also can do PPT and are experienced. Excess secretion may be an issue.

my understandin is that PPT is synonymous with some flap of peritoneal tissue being used. I know they have done peritoneal graft from the abdomen in the past, but I&#39;ve had friends told directly in consults that they don&#39;t do that anymore, they only use a graft of tunica vaginalis. As always if you are interested, best to talk to the source rather than me! just passing on word of mouth.

PPT differs from just a flap of peritoneum or tunica in that with PPT blood supply to flap remains intact and is brought down to where vagina is being constructed vs others where vascular pedicle is not preserved or there is no pedicle. ðŸ˜·

all flaps have a vascular pedicle, this is what differentiates them from a graft
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(surgery" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(surgery)</a>
)
</p>
<p>
so to my mind, ppt = peritoneal flap. Not sure what a periotneal flap that is not &#34;pulled through&#34; would be, as using this as a free flap (where the pedicle is reconected to a new blood supply) seems..... insane.

You are correct that flap has intact blood supply of varying sorts, hence pull through with intact pedicle while the peritoneal graft that is used is without. Both types have been done at Sinai. ðŸ˜·

I had surgery with Dr Burke in July of 2019, he does a 2 part surgery where the first part is getting everything where it needs to be and the second is to pretty it up. The second surgery is where other issues like lack of depth are addressed. I did have complications with the urethra which has been fixed. I went in knowing that he wasnâ€™t as experienced and he works from a teaching hospital, which is why you wonâ€™t find pictures of his work. All told Iâ€™m 95% satisfied with the final outcome, itâ€™s not 100% because we can always find fault with something.
