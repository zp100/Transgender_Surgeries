Hi, I thought I would briefly share my experience so far after having a vaginoplasty 1 month ago at GRS Montr√©al with Dr. B√©langer. Overall it&#39;s been a positive experience so far.
</p>
<p>
A little background on me. I am in my mid 20s and have no major health issues. My penis was circumcised with a length of 2 inches flaccid and 5 inches erect. This was not a problem in terms of having adequate donor material.
</p>
<p>
My stay in the hospital and convalescence home was good. Dr. B√©langer was nice and professional the times I saw her. The nursing staff were respectful and very responsive to any need I had such as needing more painkillers. The food was very good, better than what I usually have at home.
</p>
<p>
My recovery has been going well so far. I have no complications so far other than some hypergranulation tissue that was easily treated at the doctors office. I don&#39;t need any painkillers and I can walk and sit without issue. I&#39;m regaining more sensation every day in my vulva. My clit has sensation but I haven&#39;t been able to orgasm yet. I have at least 5.5 inches of depth but I&#39;m still slowly increasing in depth.
</p>

Congratulations!!! I love the pink labia minora, B√©langer and GRS Montr√©al are certainly very talented. If you don&#39;t mind, I kind of have the standard questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Why did you choose Belanger? Any other surgeons considered (including Brassard, Laungani, American or Thai surgeons, etc.)?
</li>
<li>
Around what was the cost (if it wasn&#39;t covered by your province)?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I choose B√©langer for many reasons. The many results from GRS Montreal I have seen have been mostly good and most people were happy with their results so I felt confident in going there. The short waitlist was another reason since I had bad dysphoria about my genitals and didn&#39;t want to have to wait years for surgery. Also the short travel time from where I live since I didn&#39;t want to have to spend hours on a plane after having major surgery. I chose B√©langer specifically because I have heard that B√©langer is better than Brassard.
</p>
<p>
I also considered going to Women&#39;s College Hospital in Toronto but the waitlist was too long for me. I looked at some US and Thai surgeons as well but I felt like it wasn&#39;t worth the extra travel distance and potentially having to fight my provincial health insurance to cover the costs.
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery covered by provincial health insurance so I don&#39;t know the cost, I only had to pay $40 for some medication.

Some people have said she delivers better aesthetic results than Brassard.

Do we have options to choose or they will assign the surgeon? I also prefer Belanger. My file has been sent to insurance and I am waiting for approval.
</p>
<p>
And by the way,thank you very much for sharing. It was extremely helpful

You can choose  between  the three surgeons. Just let the office know and they will accommodate but it could affect the waiting time

From what I&#39;ve seen (including this result), her&#39;s look very similar to Brassard&#39;s but maybe a bit better.

It looks similar to what I got with Dr. Brassard but not sure about the inner labia, that&#39;s why I asked for a photo to see it mor accurately and compare to what I have.

I did not. There have been no hairs in the vagina so far. I have been told that any hair that does grow there can be removed with silver nitrate.

I did not do any hair removal beforehand either but have hair inside my vagina which they have not been able to remove. I underwent an intervention afterwards but still ended up with hairs deep inside my vagina. :( My friend who just got her SRS recently also has hairs inside her vagina. Best to do electro beforehand, always!

My results with Brassard were pretty good, overall satisfied but I think some Thai surgeons might do a slightly better job of making it look closer to what cisfemales have.

Someone a few weeks ago in Ontario applied after their one year of HRT, had the paperwork for funding, approval for funding and then the application for Montreal all within five months, they had their date I believe for this coming August. So a total of 7/8 months from end of their HRT. If you look in the TransOntario threads it should be available, maybe a week ago or so. It may also have been with Brassard rather than Belanger but I assume their timelines are similar since same clinic. That‚Äôs quite fast and since I‚Äôm also considering Montreal (I‚Äôm only just starting HrT but I want my bottom just gone) that was so encouraging. I‚Äôm expecting longer just so I don‚Äôt get sad, if I can be done in three years from today I‚Äôll be a happy girl.

I also had my SRS done there, with Dr. Brassard. Relatively satisfied with results. Would you be able to share a photo with your vulva spread out more so we can see the inner labia more accurately? Thanks! :)

I honestly wasn&#39;t very scared going into surgery and was actually excited since I really wanted to get this surgery done. I felt so good waking up and knowing that my penis was finally gone. The genitals I have now feel like they should be there.
</p>
<p>
I prepared mentally for surgery by making sure that I wanted surgery and understanding the surgery. Having people to help support me has definitely helped my mental health before and after surgery.

Oh wow thank you, she&#39;s the one I want the most !! Brassard and Bensimon seems OK.. but I&#39;ve heard so many good things about her, I&#39;d easily wait longer just to get her.
