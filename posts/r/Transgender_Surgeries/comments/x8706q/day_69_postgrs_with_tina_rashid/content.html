I&#39;ve very severe psoriasis, so the colour and distinction of the suture lines is from that rather than anything else. I just have to scratch myself lightly to raise angry welts, so all things considered I&#39;ve gotten off really lightly. I was expecting my body to react a lot worse to the surgery site

How was your experience with Tina, she seems like the best on the NHS?
</p>
<p>
Bedside manner, aftercare etc?

Tina and her team were excellent ðŸ¥° My follow up with her is in a couple of weeks time and they&#39;ve been good about making sure I can get to that, given how far away I live

There&#39;s a couple of things I&#39;m concerned about, but overall I&#39;m really happy with the result ðŸ¥°
</p>
<p>
(today was the last day I could cope with the hair there. It was traveling down my thighs ðŸ˜³ So away it went)

Partly it&#39;s the angle my uretha is trying to eject at. I was expecting spraying, and even weird angles, but not 45Â° up into the air -- while I was sat down ðŸ˜¬ But hopefully that will clear up in time
</p>
<p>
But the other thing is the swollen tissue above the external suture lines at the top. It&#39;s very tender, more so than the first few weeks after the operation. Hopefully it&#39;s nothing

with the urethra issue you may need to have a Meatoplasty. I had a similar issue where skin grew over a bit of my urethra making the urine go forward when sitting on the toilet.  it is a quick minor operation but should help. if you had surgery at parkside email them to ask about it.
</p>
<p>
with the swollen tissue, I had noticeable swelling until around 6 months post op, you still have a long way to go before you no longer have any swelling. if you are concerned about the pain there is no harm to get it checked out.

Looks like you are healing ok.
</p>
<p>
Are you using silicone scar strips to help with scarring ?
</p>
<p>
Also are you massaging the scars a few times a day with moisturiser to help break down the lumps that can form underneath ?
</p>
<p>
I had much worse scarring than you from awfull stitches but doing the above has helped a little. My issues caused by Bellringer and Tina is hopefully going to fix it.
</p>
<p>
You probably already know but leaning forward on the toilet can help the urine stream go where you want it to / in the bowl. If not a handful of toilet tissue is useful to stop it going everywhere. I just did it in the shower, much easier.

I ended up using the shower as well ðŸ˜… And thank you. I didn&#39;t know about the silicone scar strips. I&#39;ll have to give them a try. I&#39;m a bit um and ah about massaging the scars. The sensation at the moment is like having my non-existent testicles squeezed and that&#39;s a big no-no for my dysphoria. Hopefully my brain will remap that signal in time

The sooner you start using them the better the effect, really wish I had started sooner but yours looks a lot better than mine did. Seriously order them now and you can have them by Saturday.

The sensation, I agree is not nice but having lumpy bits under the scars is even worse at 9 months ðŸ˜£ I find it easier after dilation, douche, shower when I&#39;m all clean. I alternate E45 and bio oil and massage it in for a few minutes, as it&#39;s slippery it feels nicer. I still need mine cutting out but if you can avoid having to go back to that hell hole it&#39;s probably worth doing ðŸ˜‰

Sorry, I&#39;ve only just seen this
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure how useful my TL would be given just how quickly the backlogs in the GIC systems have gotten worse coupled with Covid, but mine was (under the old NHS Wales system):
</p>
<p>
Approached my psych for a referral to a GIC beginning of Jan 2016
<br>
Referral was made end of Dec 2016
<br>
1st appt at the GIC was 12th March, 2018
<br>
2nd appt was 29th Jan 2019 and that was my first surgery referral consult
<br>
3rd appt was 26th May 2020 which was my second surgery referral consult
<br>
4th appt was 9th Dec 2021 where they had to redo the surgery referral because the system had timed me out
<br>
5th appt was 25th April 2022 when I was discharged from the GIC
</p>
<p>
My first appt with the surgeon was 24th March 2022 and my surgery was 30th June 2022
