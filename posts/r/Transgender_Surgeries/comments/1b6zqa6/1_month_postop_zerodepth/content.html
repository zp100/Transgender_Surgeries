Why did you choose Zero Depth? I’m 2y into HRT and looking to the next step. I know dilating is laborious but curious? ❤️

Honestly, I would love to say the easy response of, Great! No problem! But it&#39;s a major surgery, and that entails a lot of things, so heres my experience.
</p>
<p>
Week 1 : The hardest part! There was lots of breakthrough pain, but I was heavily medicated, so i just slept ALOT. Not capable of moving easy, and having a catheter in was no fun at all.. at the end of the week they removed the catheter like normal but I was the 1% of girls who was to swollen to pee and when i was about to explode  I had to have it put back in for another week. The moment he did, i drained 1200ML.
</p>
<p>
Week 2 : Pain comes in waves, sometimes a lot, sometimes not at all. Able to be more mobile. I was living in the shower at this point for comfort soothing, but it sometimes made the swelling worse afterward and needed lots of ice. Lots of crying in week 2 and lots of emotions flowing. Started wound care and slowly removed some of the dead stuff. Ended up needing to drive my car(stick shift). This went as good as you&#39;d expect and resulted in 10/10 pain afterward. Wouldn&#39;t do that again.
</p>
<p>
Week 3 : I was able to drive automatic without issue by using my donut pillow, I was able to walk around without much difficulty. Able to sit for a few hours at a time. Remaining scabs and healing skin became hard to remove and start to smell funny, but apparently, this is normal as some of the skin dies. Got checkup and assistance in wound care, and that helped immensely.
</p>
<p>
Week 4 : Pain not an issue, able to sit for longer periods, able to sleep easier and drive. I&#39;m still practicing wound care but have removed aton, and swelling is going down substantially. I am starting to explore myself, and my day is returning to a sense of normalcy!

As I understand it, this is just an intermediate step for you, right? Would it be possible to stay at zero depth? As I understand it, the healing process should be significantly less.

Correct, you can ofcourse stay at zero depth if thats all you want. Id say it took around 3 months to become very comfortable after surgery for me.

Hi! I saw your post from awhile back about your zero depth procedure, thanks for sharing. Congrats!
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re up for sharing more, I was wondering what material was used for vulva construction? Were they able to use the penis shaft skin since it wasn&#39;t being used for a canal, like in PIV?
</p>
<p>
Also, how is sensation, are you able to orgasm?
</p>
<p>
Thanks again.
