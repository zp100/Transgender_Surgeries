Thank you for this writeup. I am also going to have GCS with Dr Dy and this is all very reassuring.
</p>
<p>
Also I have met with Dorian after having an orchi with Dr Chouhan (also went very well) and I want to second that they are a superhero.

Thank you so much detail that you put into this. I am still getting my pre surgery hair removal done with Lacey kenney @ Willamette valley aesthetics and electrolysis. I have 5 more 6 hour appointments left she uses a local anesthesia so it‚Äôs pain free. I am soooo looking forward to getting my surgery date and I will definitely be following you and will for sure message you

Your write up is amazing, nothing less. I am not 20 minutes away, but OHSU is still super convenient to me and Dr. Peters and Dr. Dy have the bottom surgery procedure I want so they are on my list as I research surgeons and faculties. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, outside of the obvious proximity to the hospital you mentioned, what were the other main points that led you to pick OHSU?
</p>
<p>
Sending you best wishes for a speedy and uneventful recovery!

Thank you for this absolutely amazing and throughtful write up of your experience. I‚Äôm so excited for you and so glad Dy, Peters, and the rest of the staff were as wonderful as I hope they would be. This was super helpful for me and there‚Äôs some details that are slightly differnt than what I expected based on reading through the ohsu Vaginoplasty guide. You‚Äôve got me all excited for my own surgery.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm sending you all of the positive recovery vibes I can.

You&#39;re welcome! My sincere hope is that it helps paint a picture of the process and experience so people can feel their nerves calm a little and also decide if it&#39;s a good fit for them. Any questions please feel free to ask!
