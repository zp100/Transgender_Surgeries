Hematoma on the left over spermatic cord. Super common. They can take a awhile to go away. Couple of weeks to a few months. Had mine for a few months until they went away completely. Although every now and then the spermatic cord would remind me it was still there.

Send a message to your surgeon just to be sure.

As mentioned, hematoma. Surgeons often use two sutures placed slightly apart on the chords and blood can pool up in between them. The blood has to reabsorb, this can take between 3-6 months (or less or not at all) depending on the size and other factors. I have two I&#39;ve been dealing with after an orchi in late April, one is the size of my previous testicle, the other the size of a pea ~ like yours it looks like. As it&#39;s been six months I am having them removed surgically, though the surgeon said the smaller one (which was much larger months ago) could remain, but I&#39;m getting them both taken out since he&#39;ll already have me opened up. Mine is a little painful, especially after sitting for long periods and while having tighter underwear on when I was out of the house ~ but that got better and I am mostly pain free now, does yours hurt?

What&#39;s the biggest difference you&#39;ve noticed since the surgery?

As others have said it is just blood. It will be reabsorbed by the body over the coming weeks. Mine were very big and painful and from day 8 onwards I experienced a lot of bleeding. After the wound healed the rest was reabsorbed over the subsequent weeks.

I had the same thing.  It took months to go away. I ignored it and it eventually just disappeared. I canâ€™t say how long it took because I forgot about it!
