I noticed that sometime ago, and I actually had doubts on whether I should have SRS or not. The surgery just doesn&#39;t give us a &#34;perfect vagina&#34;. It didn&#39;t take long for me to realize I would rather not have a perfect vagina than have a penis, though.

Big same. I was like “i only want it if it is ____” and then a few month later I realized “nah, I just want it, and quickly.”

My impression is that it&#39;s pretty common. Perhaps because it&#39;s difficult to join the labia minora behind the vaginal entrance and have it heal together without splitting during recovery. I think maybe that it might be easier to create neo vagina with the entrance between the labia minora in a two stage procedure, as seen
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9v6uui/ama_3months_postop_labiaplasty_with_dr_ley_2stage/">here
</a>
, but I&#39;m not sure.

I haven&#39;t the faintest idea. Sorry. You should probably ask a surgeon about this. In fact, I probably should too.

Thank you so much for bringing this up again! It hasn&#39;t been talked about in a long time.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
This is a huge short coming of vaginoplasty surgeries and I have never seen a result with the labia spread that looks natural. Even though there are results that looks great with the labia not being spread.  I think it is because of the remnant of the corpus cavernosa.

<p>
Unfortunately this is also what I concluded from my research. Many photos don&#39;t show it, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a feature of inversion and non inversion techniques. I think dilation might prevent healing otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Would be interested to know if it can be fixed, I&#39;ve not seen photos after a revision that left me feeling sure it had been fixed.
</p>
<p>
However, it&#39;s only visible from specific positions and unless the person was familiar with female anatomy and vaginoplasty it would probably just look like a variation rather that surgical.

I&#39;m put of by the scrotum mesh technique he uses and extra recovery time but will have a closure look as if he avoids this issue it may be worth a tougher recovery. Also waiting on more posts about Dr Bank.

I believe it&#39;s classic penile inversion. You don&#39;t often see it because most photos are with the labia closed, but sometimes you can see a hint of it.
</p>
<p>
Probably a related issue seems to be the vulval vestubile looking like it&#39;s two separate parts instead of one cavity. Also not often shown.

I think you are completely right, seems like it is better with non-inversion, but it happens with both.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I think it is because the vestibule is separate and more forward and the canal is to the rear.

I&#39;ve seen asymmetry with Supon&#39;s labia and/or where it doesn&#39;t go all the way down, but its more by accident or a complication than an inherent feature of the technique. Personally I&#39;d want a revision if that happened. Not sure I&#39;ve seen any problems with Suporn&#39;s vestibule, but I&#39;ve seen very few of those and can&#39;t remember.

I don&#39;t know enough about the other Thai surgeons to comment.

I think it is an inherent limitation of the technique and I don&#39;t think revision can fix it. You can extent the inner labia further to the rear, but that still doesn&#39;t make the vestibule and canal the same cavity. It might look better when not spread, but as soon as your spread the labia you see it.
</p>
<p>

I&#39;ve never seen a spread picture that didn&#39;t have this.

So my vagina is basically as described here, and a link to it is in the comments of one of the posters..  and honestly I thought it&#39;d bother me, but it really doesn&#39;t.   I&#39;m considering a revision (unrelated to positioning of the labia/vaginal canal) so maybe I&#39;ll see what can be done, in the meantime here is a link to a bunch of cis-vaginas from another reddit (normalnudes).

My surgery with her is in 11 weeks, maybe we will cross paths walking the halls :)  I&#39;ll be the goofy girl with Einstein like hair.
</p>
<p>
She said the same thing when I asked her.  Did she share any recent before/after pics?  I asked her about recent advances she has incorporated and the two big ones were placing the urethra closer to the vaginal opening in the natal female position AND orientation, and better formation of the labia around the vaginal opening.  Pornstar pussy is how I&#39;ve heard it described.

Examples from this subreddit:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/agheuz/575_mths_postop_gcs/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/agheuz/575_mths_postop_gcs/

</a>
</p>
<p>
But my sense is that a surgeon either creates the labia minora and puts the entrance behind them or just doesn&#39;t create labia minora at all, as seen in some other top voted posts on this subreddit.
