I’m sure there’s a few out there, any horror stories? Most of the time I see his name it’s all positive.

I don&#39;t have any direct experience with him, but he was one of the surgeons my daughter considered for her GCS. We booked a phone consult with him while he was still at Brownstein &amp; Crane. As the consult date approached, I got a call saying that Dr. Satterwhite moved to a different practice (his own, perhaps). I decided to make sure he will still honor our phone consult and I was assured that he would.
</p>
<p>
As the day arrived, my daughter and I never heard from him. When I called the office, they assured me that the consult would happen another day/time and that I would hear from them. I never heard from them. I called several times and then I gave up.
</p>
<p>
To me, if you&#39;re not able to honor a phone consult, how can you be an effective surgeon?
</p>
<p>
We ended up going with Dr. Chettawut in Thailand, which is where we are now. My daughter&#39;s surgery was a few weeks ago and we have one more week left here. Now that we&#39;re here, I&#39;m so glad that Dr. Satterwhite never contacted us. As frustrating as it was, I think we made the best decision possible for my daughter.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps there are many people out there who have had a positive experience and maybe he&#39;s an awesome surgeon, but I can only speak of our minimal experience.
</p>
<p>
All the best to you.
