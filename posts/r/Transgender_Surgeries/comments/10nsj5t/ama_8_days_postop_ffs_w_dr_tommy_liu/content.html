I had FFS Stage 1 (Type 3 forehead, brow lift and shave, and chin and jaw contouring) with Dr. Tommy Liu at the Polyclinic in Seattle 8 days ago!
</p>
<p>
My swelling peaked on Day 2 and I&#39;ve barely had any bruising at all. My chin and jaw are still pretty swollen, but my forehead is coming along really well (and it looks freaking
<em>
perfect
</em>
btw). I have full sensation on the skin of my forehead, mouth, chin, and jaw, but I&#39;m still dealing with some subdermal numbness and muscle weakness, particularly on the inside of my mouth. That said, I&#39;ve been feeling my nerves healing every day (pins and needles, stingers, all that jazz), so it probably won&#39;t be long until I&#39;m back to normal on that front.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Liu told me I&#39;m healing well ahead of schedule, so that&#39;s awesome! Gonna get Part 2 (septorhinoplasty, cheek fat transfer, and tracheal shave) scheduled here in the next week!
</p>
<p>
Dr. Liu is honestly the best. I&#39;m so glad I went to him. And you should too! He&#39;s pretty undiscovered as far as FFS surgeons go, so you can get in pretty quickly :)
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, lemme know! ðŸ¥°

Dr. Liu isn&#39;t the best, he&#39;s on another world! Absolutely amazing man and an artist of a surgeon. I stumbled into his quote by accident and I am absolutely flored by how wonderful his work is.
