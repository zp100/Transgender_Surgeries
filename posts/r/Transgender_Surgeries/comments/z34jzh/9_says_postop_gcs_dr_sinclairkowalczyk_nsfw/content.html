I&#39;m really struggling with the way it looks and I&#39;m not able to imagine what it might look mine a month or 2 from now or even 6. I just look at it and I&#39;m so disgusted

You have a lot of dried blood and swelling right now. Just give it time and the swelling will come down.
</p>
<p>
Im sorry youre struggling right now. Just do your best to be patient and stay calm. Worst case scenario you can always get a revision.

I&#39;m sorry, I have seen quite a few of these and I was bracing for what I might see and then I was like oh that&#39;s a good job. Also ask the doctor for some ativan or xanax and some meclizine if your feeling nauseous. I view Surgerys like this cause when I get mine I want to know what to expect, I&#39;m not an expert at all just thought maby I could give a little bit of comfort or peace of mind. Every day should be better after this day and the next and so on your very amazing and brave I don&#39;t know if I will ever be able to do it myself cause I&#39;m scared of everything. I will pray that you feel better soon.

The scars look intimidating at first but remember with proper care they will (almost) vanish. But apart from that it&#39;s alright for just 9 days.
