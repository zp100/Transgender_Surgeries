I just had GRS with Dr Miroslav in Serbia a few days ago, everything went well so far. Willing to answer your questions if anyone wants to ask me something.

I&#39;m planning to have my surgery with him as well.
</p>
<p>
How long did it take to get to the point of surgery from your first consultation?
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t mind me asking what technique did he used and how much did it cost?
</p>
<p>
What are your overall impressions?
</p>
<p>
Thank you.

I started emailing him in September 2020 and I had my surgery in July, I had consultation with him a few days before my surgery. I paid roughly 5 weeks before the surgery date
</p>
<p>
He used the peritoneal pull through method and I paid 15000 euros for the surgery itself.
</p>
<p>
My impressions are high for the most part, they&#39;re a bit disorganised in their communication over email but I had researched the surgery extensively so I already knew to ask them about whether I should buy my own dilators and so on (which I should, they recommended GRS soul source dilators). Once I got to the hospital a while before my surgery everything went smoothly, they checked my health twice before surgery. They also expect you to get various blood tests and EKG done months before to make sure you&#39;re okay. They seem to care about safety a lot. One aspect that makes them different from other places is that they expect you to briefly stand up after surgery, its scary but not as painful as it seems. I got to see my vulva the day after the surgery, looks surprisingly normal except for the stitches, catheter and some compression bandage.

Dr Miroslav is super nice and the nurses are nice too. Miroslav insisted on hugging me and was excited to meet my mom

It is, I wanna get back to education and dating. Surgery isn&#39;t fun but I want normalcy and to feel like a woman, before I couldn&#39;t even going to the bathroom without hating myself and I would suppress my sex drive to an unhealthy degree, because I&#39;d have a minor mental break down after masturbating. edit: grammar/typo

I can understand that, it took me 10 years before I was able to afford surgery, so yeah, it&#39;s amazing once it&#39;s done.
</p>
<p>
Whatever you do now, make sure to look after yourself during your recovery, don&#39;t be an idiot like me and not follow the docs recommendations.

Odd, he never discussed that with me at all. I know he offers sigmoid but PPT seemed better according to my extensive research

He has a subpar website where you can obtain their email and see a few pictures:

Hi there 🤗 How are you feeling? How everything going? Did you seen results already? Not yet? Complications? How is your pain level? Was and now? Did you getting pain killers? Working? How is the hospital staff was with you? Did you purchase dilators or was provided free? Do you stay in hotel or apartment? Somebody help you with food? Or you order from restaurants? Do you stay by self, with friend or hire some caregiver? I already contacted with Dr Miro. 🤗🤗

I&#39;m quite happy with the results and got to see my vulva the day after my surgery. I may have a minor complication on my butt next to my vaginal canal but it can be fixed easily, they&#39;re going to check up on it.
</p>
<p>
Hospital staff was amazing, there was one nurse in particular who was really nice to me, she were speaking to the other nurses in my room in Serbian (which I don&#39;t understand) and then she turned down to look at me and said &#34;I just told them you are a good girl&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Dr Miroslav himself was also friendly, hugged me before and after surgery
</p>
<p>
You have to purchase your own dilators, I went with soul source GRS dilators. I also recommend buying a small mirror for dilation.
</p>
<p>
They give you painkillers. My mom is helping me with food, she&#39;s cooking for me in the apartment the hospital provided (costs extra).
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: the complication was some sutures that broke on the outside on my butt next to my vagina, it&#39;s been stitched back together now, was told to ditch the dilators for a while and use one of my fingers

He said me, after surgery I need to stay 8-10 day in Serbia and after I can go back to home. Do you feel you can go back to home soon???? I’m a little confused. Really possible take a flight to home about 17-20 hours (in my case) after just 8-10 days???? Oooohhhh….

I was told by Dr Marta that you can do that but it&#39;s not recommended, I&#39;m staying for 14 full days. I&#39;d recommend you stay for at least 14 days

How is pain management? I&#39;ve vaguely heard that Serbia has pretty strict rules about pain medication

They gave me some clear injections for pain the first few days, no idea what it was but it made me want to vomit. I was just giving the option of taking OTC pain meds but I don&#39;t feel like vomiting again, that stuff makes me sick. Pain is not that bad imo, I may have a pussy but I am not pussy (sorry couldn&#39;t resist)

Some kind of opiate if it makes you nauseous, next time ask for Ondansetron (or generally just ask for something to fix nausea), it&#39;ll fix it really quick

The pain is manageable, pain meds are bad for you so I prefer to avoid them. They did give me injections for nausea but it only partially worked. Pain is how you know you&#39;re alive :)

I can now safely say that sexual function is in fact preserved (I don&#39;t think much else needs to be said hehe)

I don&#39;t know the entire process, but I was told sexual function is retained multiple times and I do have a clitoris. The nerves reconnect over time, as with other forms of GRS.

Hi, I am planning my surgery with Dr. Miro to December. When you were doing your research, have you found a good resource of Dr. Miro previous results?  Plus, what is your opinion about the appearance of clitoris, labia, vulva, how does it look to you?

It all looks very natural, he&#39;s good at hiding scars as well. He doesn&#39;t leave big ugly scars like I see in a few pictures on here. Actually puzzled he doesn&#39;t get more recognition from western European trans people, makes no sense to go to Thailand when there&#39;s such a good surgeon in Europe.

Thanks! Whenever I search by his name people always talks really well about him. I think the matter of popularity might be because of the hardship on finding results to compare or maybe health insurance since Servia is not yet part of EU. I think it will change in 2024. I have both problems. There is a small chance Swedish Social insurance might cover part of the costs if I have the surgery inside EU. If either i can’t find a worth option here or the insurance don’t cover. I will go to Dr. Miro.

Even if Serbia was part of the EU I don&#39;t i would have gotten it covered by insurance due to my country being stupid. My country is incompetent when it comes to trans healthcare rights, ridiculously easy to get your papers changed and most people are either nice or pretend to be, but when it comes to coughing about money for our treatments people suddenly no longer feels like giving us proper help. Only transphobia I met was from a Somali immigrant and early in my transition a seriously creepy teacher called me a good boy and deadnamed intentionally, he wasn&#39;t just a dick to me but also creepy to one of my teenage girl classmates who just after meeting told her &#34;one day you&#39;ll be a great mom&#34;. Most teachers in my experience are quite nice to trans students, although that might just be my experience. I love you

I had pretty disgusting professors. Had to deal with one at university who would always deadname me, make transphobic jokes and ask very inappropriate questions. But that was Brazil. I suspect Sweden won’t be very different from Denmark on that matter. I don’t see other trans girls talking about getting their surgery covered by social insurance. They usually submit to the butchery the doctor here can perform if they can’t afford. What is the big majority of cases since they are mostly young girls and might not have much family support.

I was lucky to have an upper middle class mom who cares about me deeply, my parental support ends there, my dad is not supportive but I cut him out of my life before I even came out. I feel good that I cut him out and not the other way around

He explicitly mentioned — he does not have any and not allowed to share.

<p>
IDK, I am willing to give him permission to share mine results (anonymously) but just other girls could make not a blind decision.

It’s risky going to a surgeon when you can’t find results/reviews. Why did you choose him?

I am considering several options: BKK, Belgrade, Potsdam.

BKK is leading now (Kamol).

I know about Kamol :) it is not an issue to find his “after” works (that is why he is leading:)

The struggle is about Djorjevic’s post-op photos :)

Mostly no, there&#39;s been a few days where I was only able to dilate once instead of 2 or 3, but I am doing fairly well with it overall.

How&#39;s it going now?

Reddit and Susan&#39;s have most of the resources you need.

<p>
It&#39;s a mixed bag, I haven&#39;t had necrosis and sexual function has returned. But I&#39;ve got partial vaginal stenosis between the two types of tissue, I might need revision surgery 12 months post op if it doesn&#39;t solve itself through dilation. I also got some tissue granulation again for the 2nd time, but that&#39;s not uncommon or that serious.
</p>
<p>
When I masturbate I just stimulate my clitoris, used my hand and different kinds of vibrators (air pressure vibrators worked best). Learning how to masturbate again was harder than I thought it would be

I can assure you Dr Miroslav and his team are not transphobic, neither was any of the nurses at the hospital. Miroslav was probably the most outgoing and friendly of them all, but they were all nice. I wasn&#39;t misgendered or anything like that, I was always referred to and treated as a woman.

His website describes the technique, 5-6 inches is what he guarantees

I was able to walk around somewhat normally around 5-6 weeks post op, while painful I was able to travel alone on a trip back to Serbia at around 4 weeks post op. Bleeding stopped at the 5 week mark exactly.
