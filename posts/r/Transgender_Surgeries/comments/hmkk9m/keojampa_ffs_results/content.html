Keojampa results are difficult to find as he doesn&#39;t post them publicly.
</p>
<p>
Look at these 2 videos of a girl who had surgery withÂ Keojampa.
</p>
<p>
The first one is before FFS

<p>
The second one is after FFS. She looks flawlessly cisgender

FFS can be a game changer if you choose the right surgeon.

Z&#39;s pretty famous in the trans community for voice training lol.
</p>
<p>
How much does it normally cost with Dr. Keojampa? That deposit of $5,000 looks painful.
</p>
<p>
Seems like California always has the best FFS doctors, but I&#39;m in Texas ðŸ˜­

If you&#39;re looking to stay in Texas then Regina Rodman is probably your best bet.

Is she any good and do you know how much she costs? Insurance or no?
</p>
<p>
Because I&#39;m looking at the Before and Afters they put on the website and the patients don&#39;t really look too feminized tbh. Looks like the doc just messed with the brow bone and nose which is standard, then just shaved the chin and jaw. No moving around or bone cutting.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t mind flying somewhere if it&#39;s cheap. I really want to go to FacialTeam in Spain but that&#39;s probably not gonna happen since they&#39;re expensive.

I don&#39;t think she&#39;s that great, personally. Definitely not top tier and too conservative for my tastes. However, she is probably the best choice if you need to stay in Texas.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s really a bad idea to go to a surgeon based on price.

I&#39;m getting my forehead/brow/orbital done and it&#39;s roughly 20k. The deposit is painful.

No insurance covers it I&#39;m guessing?

Keojampa takes insurance, but rarely does insurance cover it. I have some bougie trans care coverage, but apparently FFS is like the only thing it won&#39;t cover. Amazon, Starbucks, Twitter-esque companies do, I think. Gotta love the American healthcare system.

Someone told me Blue Cross Blue Shield covers it, but I looked at the requirements and it was like &#34;must have seen a therapist for a year and confirmed to have gender dysphoria&#34; and &#34;must have been on HRT for a year&#34; something like that. I&#39;m still not sure how insurances work tbh. Never had it before.
</p>
<p>
Problem is I don&#39;t have a therapist since I&#39;m far from any gender therapists, plus I have no job thanks to covid so it&#39;s too expensive

It depends on your blue Cross blue shield plan. Mine explicitly states it does not pay for FFS

Also, there are ways to get a therapist through telehealth that are inexpensive. I know it&#39;s hard right now. Hang in there. This will eventually all be over.

Through an app right? But a lot of them require insurance or the price is over a hundred dollars, so I stopped looking since I couldn&#39;t find any.
</p>
<p>
And for my BCBS Texas, for trans/FFS stuff, it says
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The individual being considered for surgery and related services must meet ALL the following criteria. The individual must have:
</p>
<p>
(etc, etc)
</p>
<p>
The required referrals prior to any surgery or related service(s):
</p>
<p>
o Prior to feminizing or masculinizing hormonal therapy, one required referral from the individualâ€™s qualified mental health professionals competent in the assessment and treatment of gender dysphoria
</p>

She mentions it a bunch of times in her videos that she had FFS with Keojampa if you follow her

She was my voice teacher and can confirm she recommended I go to Keojampa.
