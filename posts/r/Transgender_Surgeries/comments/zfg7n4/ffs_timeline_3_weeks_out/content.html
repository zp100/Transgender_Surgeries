I had FFS 3 weeks ago with Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez at NYU Langone. I had brow, orbitals, cheek implants, mandible reduction, genioplasty, and lip fat grafting.
</p>
<p>
So far I‚Äôm really happy with my results. Recovery has not been as difficult as I thought it might be, but it‚Äôs still tough. Thankfully I have a lot of time off from work. The hardest part has been the mental challenge of staying patient and watching the small changes add up. I can‚Äôt wait to see how I look in another month, 6 months, a year out :)
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer any questions!
</p>
<p>
edit: I also had rhinoplasty! lol idk why I forgot to include it

I‚Äôm so happy for you! I can imagine so. Personally, I‚Äôm having FFS for myself as I actually pass as I am now, but unfortunately not to myself. My brain instinctively knows there‚Äôs too much skull growth in some areas. I‚Äôm dysphoric everyday. I avoid looking at myself in a mirror, reflections, and I won‚Äôt take photos of myself. It‚Äôll be nice to be free of that.
</p>
<p>
Did you take in photos of yourself pre puberty and photos of your parents? I‚Äôm wondering if that will help the surgeon a bit.

Not everyone needs everything, which is something I learned along the way. I have friends who just had jaw work for example. But I pretty much had everything except trach shave

You‚Äôre very wise, I do see your point. One thing I am on the fence about is cheek augmentation. What I‚Äôm worried about is not getting it done only to get older and start to look masculine due to low facial fat. Idk if that makes sense. I‚Äôd rather just get it done. I‚Äôm only 29 but face lift is covered and I‚Äôm hoping the surgeon will go to bat for me and say it‚Äôs medically necessary (it‚Äôs not, lol).

Something to discuss with your doctor for sure. I also had hesitations about cheek implants but went ahead with them and so far I‚Äôm happy with it. But ya, who knows what that‚Äôll look like in 10, 20, 50 years lol

How would you rate the pain at each interval in the photo?  What areas hurt the most?
</p>
<p>
My FFS is in a little over a month so I&#39;m trying to set my expectations appropriately.

Great question. Day of, in the hospital, pain was literally around a 2-4 because I was on oxycodone. When I got home, I started taking ibuprofen and acetaminophen on a 3 hour rotating basis, and took oxy before bed. That kept most of the pain away. I‚Äôd wake up every 3 hours the first few nights to stay ahead of the pain.
</p>
<p>
At 1 week, I still had pain but it was very manageable. I was off oxy after night 3 and still rotating the other two. The pain kind of moved down my face - at points I‚Äôd feel some acute pinch in my brow, at the top of my nose. Later it moved into my cheeks and finally my chin. It might last for less than hour, when it was present. By this point I was eating mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, and other soft foods.
</p>
<p>
At 2 weeks most of the pain was gone. I was still rotating the pain meds, but I was able to sleep through the night. I‚Äôd wake up in the morning with some pain, but after taking more meds it would go away for the day. At this point I could eat any solid food, as long as it fit in my mouth. Sandwiches were a no go because my jaw just wouldn‚Äôt (and still won‚Äôt) open wide enough. However, I was able to have a whole Thanksgiving dinner :)
</p>
<p>
At 3 weeks, I have no pain besides for minor jaw muscle aches, but it‚Äôs barely noticeable. Maybe a small spike every couple days. I‚Äôm taking ibuprofen twice a day, not for pain but it helps with the swelling.

I assume the orbital reduction. At my postops (have had 2 so far) they said it‚Äôs all normal and will fade over time. I still have some redness in my eyes but it‚Äôs reducing slowly.

I just wanted to thank you for submitting this post.  I am 7 days post FFS and was getting really depressed.  After seeing your changes in 3 weeks, it makes me much more upbeat.  The swelling sucks!

Oh I get it. Hang in there &lt;3 every time I looked in the mirror I‚Äôd involuntarily say ‚Äúoof‚Äù out loud. It gets better! And the changes truly take up to a year to fully settle. But the first couple weeks of swelling are terrible

If you&#39;d be willing for me to ask, how long was the wait-list? And what was the time between the consultation and the actual surgery date?
</p>
<p>
I like the natural look as well, hence why Rodriguez is currently on my list to call! I&#39;m in north country NY, so I have a couple choices that are closer, but I&#39;ve only heard good things about him overall, so the drive might be worth it!

I called initially in like November 2021? Could‚Äôve been October. They got me a consult for March 2023. I called them back each week for the next 3 weeks and they had a cancellation in May 2022. You gotta call back to get the cancellations. After the consult, I had to get insurance and therapist letters in order. Due to some complications it took longer than necessary but I was done by August, and then got the surgery date for November. So I guess it was about a year from the initial call to getting surgery, which is really good actually!

How was your hospital experience? If you were admitted / overnight, which hospital were you in? How do you feel about Dr Rodriguez at this stage of the game - bedside, explaining how it went, what complications happened etc? I know you mentioned a reasonable recovery thus far, and you&#39;re still swollen, just figured I&#39;d ask for a pulse check

I stayed overnight at NYU Langone on 1st and 34th. Rodriguez is an amazing surgeon but he is also very to the point. He made sure all my concerns and questions were answered, and I always felt taken care of. But he doesn‚Äôt waste any time - my consult, preop, and postop time with him were both really brief. His staff are great and the NYU hospital staff were (mostly) really wonderful.
</p>
<p>
Still, the hospital experience could‚Äôve been better. After surgery, I was in the recovery ward from about 2:30pm - 1:00am waiting for a room to open up. That was an absurdly long wait. Thankfully I was too doped up to care that much. I had three different nurses over that time period who gave me very personal attention which helped immensely. Also, they let my mom stay by my side the whole time even though it was against the rules.
</p>
<p>
The nurse in the actual room was not nearly as good. They wheeled me over, down an elevator, and as soon as I got in bed I told her I was gonna puke. She meandered away and returned with a basin only after I‚Äôd already yakked, trying to keep it together (poorly) with my blankets. I wish she moved quicker. That was really unpleasant. She was also very slow to respond when I needed more pain meds or the bathroom throughout the night. Yes, I have empathy bc it seemed like she was the only nurse on duty for the whole floor (!!!!) but I mean, I‚Äôm recovering from major surgery.
</p>
<p>
I forgot to mention, one of the residents who participated in the surgery checked on me twice in the recovery ward and once in my room. That was very kind and he was really sweet! I didn‚Äôt see Dr. Rodriguez again until my first postop appointment.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully no complications (yet!).

sounds very similar to my SRS experience at Sinai. Good, but clearly overworked clinical staff.

Yes I could see! My eyes definitely got hit hard lol but I could see just fine. I still have some red in my eyes but it‚Äôs fading. My right eye was very swollen the first couple days, but I could see out of it even when it looked shut from the outside.

It&#39;s great to follow your story. I&#39;m about to do my FFS but I&#39;ve already postponed it 3 times. I&#39;m feeling like a coward because I&#39;m so afraid of the surgery, which is what made me postpone it. I&#39;m afraid of the surgery, because it&#39;s a long surgery, right? It would basically be the same procedures as you did I think (I would do forehead, nose, jaw and chin). But for some reason your post made me calmer. Maybe because you&#39;ve just done it and now you&#39;re waiting for the result, simple as that. I create many fears in my head with this surgery... But I need

It‚Äôs scary! I had a lot of anxiety leading up to surgery. Before this I‚Äôd never had any surgery, never even broken a bone. It‚Äôs normal to be scared of a major surgery. I did have a couple major freak outs about 2 weeks before surgery. And it‚Äôs long, yes, I was under for like 5 hours? Recovery is drawn out but now that I‚Äôm looking and feeling a lot better, I‚Äôm so so so happy that I went through it all.
</p>
<p>
What helped me leading up to it was my therapist, and many talks with friends who had had FFS already and were long healed. Everyone reported similar fears. Also, preparing all the materials and everything I‚Äôd need. Most importantly, you need a good support system for the first 7-10 days post surgery, the first 4 days especially.
</p>
<p>
And it is all so worth it. FFS is truly life changing and it‚Äôs only been 24 days for me. lmk if you wanna talk more &lt;3

That‚Äôs wonderful! I just started a new job that has health insurance with full trans inclusive insurance. FFS is specifically covered.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm wondering since it‚Äôs definitely medically necessary if I‚Äôll be able to take short term disability or FMLA.
</p>
<p>
Any thoughts? How did you take your leave, in a similar way as I typed above or through PTO?

My company has 12 weeks of paid medical leave, and I think that‚Äôs before short term disability. It‚Äôs separate from PTO. I had to get a few forms filled out by the surgeon‚Äôs office, where they wrote their recommendations for a recovery timeline (5 weeks). Thankfully my job just signed off on it too. I have a friend who went to the same surgeon, but they only got 2 weeks off.

That‚Äôs very generous. Maybe mine does too? Lol I‚Äôll have to ask HR. Kinda waiting to ask HR until I get things more setup. Idk if that makes sense?

<p>
Anyways you look beautiful. I‚Äôve been on HRT for 4 years, but have known that I needed FFS for myself for more years than I can count. Kinda doesn‚Äôt feel real that it‚Äôs going to happen for me, and soon too! Lol
