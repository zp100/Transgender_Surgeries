Only two times a day is not nearly enough. I was told to do 3 to 5 times a day. And I had the colon procedure. I cannot and won’t tell you to disregard what your doctor said, but I would call and ask. Virtually everyone says it’s better to dilate much more frequently for less time than it is to dilate less but for longer because you are trying to keep things stretched out as often as possible, if that makes sense. Rapidly losing a bunch of depth is not good. you appear to possibly have some granulation developing. The stitches appear to be normal, but again, I’m not a doctor. I would really call your physicians office and insist someone speak to you, no matter what it takes. Really, no harm can come from dilating frequently. You may find it less painful and easier if you do.

What is granulation? And what times of the day would you recommend dilating cause I think going up to 3 times will be good

That red irritated looking tissue may be granulation. That’s something your doctor needs to look at. I used to dilate first thing in the morning, at lunch, and then in the early evening.

One of these issues on it&#39;s own would be pretty crappy but all of them at once is crazy. Your nurses and surgeons are failing you big time.
</p>
<p>
At 4 weeks you should be dilating twice as much, ESPECIALLY with that little depth. I think that&#39;s nearing 3&#34; territory.
</p>
<p>
Issues peeing are common, and what you&#39;re describing sounds like a UTI, one of the most common issues right at the start of recovery -your surgeon should&#39;ve clocked that in a quarter second.
</p>
<p>
Standing and sitting is different for everyone, but you shouldn&#39;t be in pain while lying down and you should be getting to the point where you can sleep in any position more or less comfortably.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s debates on douching frequency and method and solution, but you should most certainly should be washing your surgical site in some way. At 4 weeks, I believe I was douching after each dilation and sitzbathing twice a day. I got PIV, I&#39;m sure PPT is different, but just airdrying after you pee and... leaking after you dilate(?) isn&#39;t enough.

I will start dilating 4x a day, thank you for letting me know! I’m so worried that I won’t get the depth I had back, I at least want enough depth for my husband. I just knew something wasn’t right when I kept asking my surgeon questions and all they said was everything was fine and sent me home.. there’s no urgency or burning when I pee though so I’m not sure if I have a uti? I’m not sure if it’s just the nerves not 100% healed yet idk :(( also what’s sitzbathing? They said not to take a bath until I’m cleared to do so

If you dilate 4 times a day you can do 15 minutes each time. I specifically asked about this and its more about stretching it out more often rather then for a longer time less often.

Girl you do need to dilate more this early in. I had SRS with RBL on January 4th and I was directed to dilate 4 times a day for 6 weeks then 3 times a day for 6 weeks then 2 times a day for the rest of the year. That reddish area at the bottom of your introitus is common and I was told to put aquacel gauze on it as it wont stick and it will draw up moisture to help it heal.
</p>
<p>
Look into getting an upside down peri bottle that you can use while sitting on the toilet to help clean yourself off.  Its ok to wipe gently after peeing, remember front to back. I use unscented baby wipes as the wont irritate things down there. Your wounds look like you need to take better care of it as being that red around the incision means it having issues. Shower and gently clean your vagina everyday with soap, you can use the peri bottle after dilating to help clean off the lube it doesn&#39;t need to be perfect.
</p>
<p>
Once you get that area happier and les red (not talking about the tissue around the introitus as thats normal you will feel better and have less difficulties. You need to discuss with your Dr about the spraying while peeing. Sit on a cushion while traveling to help and don&#39;t use a cushion that is a donut.  Good luck and I hope you get things going better for healing.

Should I dilate every 6 hours then? I was also told to clean by just getting a washrag with soap on it and just wringing it out over the site. Should I use a washrag to clean gently or just my hands? I’m so scared to wipe the incisions at any point! Also you said to NOT use a donut pillow? What should I be doing then? :(( I feel like I was givin so much wrong information from my doctor I feel like crying

Yes every 6 (example 8am 2pm 8pm)
</p>
<p>
Don’t use a wash rag, just your hand with soap that foams and clean it all and rinse. You won’t hurt your V incision on the labia but it does need better care as that red is a sign it’s unhappy.
</p>
<p>
A donut cushion causes your introitus area to push out and will have pressure on it and the vulva. My dr gave me a waffle cushion at discharge but a solid cushion would work as well.

Just to add on the soap thing.  Washing with just overrun is common I the first week or two after surgery. If they told you that in the hospital, they weren&#39;t wrong.  More often people do it by just leaning in a shower and letting the soapy water wash over it.
</p>
<p>
Eventually you graduate to like normal vulva washing.  You use an unscented gentile soap, think like dove bar soap.  You wash specifically the hair bearing parts of your vulva, so your labia majora, the mons, the perineum, etc.  When you rinse, you rinse with less hot water than you use on the rest of your body if you are using a handheld shower head, generally the coolest that feels comfortable (until the bruising and swelling goes down the just like less hot if you like steamy showers).  You shouldn&#39;t have to put soap between your labia minora and definitely don&#39;t put soap into your vaginal canal.
</p>
<p>
Also, when you dialate, don&#39;t start your timer till you are at full depth.  During scar contraction, it can take a while. I went from taking 2 minutes to get the first fully inserted to taking 40-60 minutes. It will go back down with time, but you want to wait till you get the &#34;
<em>
gasp
</em>
OMG, you&#39;re so deep inside me feeling&#34; to start the timer, then push gently, but firmly (IE, easing into the pressure ramping up to as firmly as you can comfortably press) and hold that pressure for the entire timer.  If you are going up sizes as you dialate, the same process applies, once you get the sensation, then you start the timer.  Since you had PPT, you also want to make sure you are also at least dialating the scar ring with the biggest size you can comfortably handle.  If that size is bigger than you can get to full depth, just do it in two parts.  Full depth time, then scar ring time.  Hope is not lost.  I had a hybrid, so I am half perineal tissue.  In the time my surgical notes had my depth just under 12 cm, now it is just under 16.  It just takes consistency and practice.
</p>
<p>
I just wanted to like not assume they fully coached you on anything given you don&#39;t feel well coached and other people&#39;s replies, while good, rely on assumptions here and there and I just like wanted to make sure you could take their advice even if you had no prior knowledge.

What is the scar ring? Is that the back of the vagina or like the entrance? And nope I wasn’t schooled on really anything! When I dilate I do get that sensation that it goes just a little bit further in after some time but if I put a lot of pressure it hurts/stings so it’s a little scary. And I also haven’t sized up or down at all I’ve always stayed with the purple dilator which is the third size for me (mine goes purple#1 orange#2 purple#3 and blue is the biggest)

So basically it&#39;s where the two kind of tissues join.  For me it&#39;s further back. For you it&#39;s near the front right where the perineal graft attaches.  Basically some PPTs try to close up like a camera apature and the earlier you start going nuh uh buddy, and start stretching it out to a circumference that works for you, the easier it will be. It&#39;s dumb but basically when scars try to retract the fastest is also when they can be forced to elongate the most due to their elasticity.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, so like you just want to be firm when you feel that feeling.  You don&#39;t want it to hurt.  Part of your problem too is probably that the purple is so sharp at the tip.  Depending on how big hubby is, there are even two sizes above blue (green and big orange) that you can order from soul source. Just measure him around when he&#39;s hard and compare it to the circumferences available.
</p>
<p>
When trying to increase depth, it&#39;s definitely not comfortable, especially on big purple or below. It shouldn&#39;t feel like being split either. Generally the bigger the dialator, the more pressure it can take to stretch because it is being pushed onto a wider surface are inside. It should feel like a pressure kind of stretch, if it gets sharp, you want just before that point pressure wise.  It&#39;s a slow and steady game.  It takes from you in mm so you take back in mm.
</p>
<p>
That said, if it feels both like someone just socked you in a muscle and sharp at the same time, then I generally relax, try to do a gentle push keigal, and gently give it more pressure, because that&#39;s usually the feeling of pushing against a layer of pelvic floor that&#39;s being grumpy.
</p>
<p>
It is generally safe to size up once you&#39;ve been able to consistently get your current biggest to the back comfortably (girth wise). When going up a size, you want to do full time on the others, the 5-10 minutes on the next size up, however deep you can comfortably get.  Once you are at the back, you start that 5-10 once it gets to the back.  Once it feels just as comfortable as the size before for a week, feel free to repeat on the next size up.
</p>
<p>
The other thing you could do is work with a pelvic floor physical therapist.  Also if you have a Gynecologist, they can help you navigate both healing the granulation and the basics of vulva care.

Not sure if this helps as I had PI with grafts 2 weeks ago, but my surgeons recommended I dilate 5 times a day for 20 minutes+ during the first 3 months. And to wait at least 2 hours between dilations.

I have my PPT scheduled for June.  But they’ve already sent me what to expect afterward and it lists dilating 4x a day for 20-30 minutes each time.  You definitely need to dilate more often.
