I was limited to lifting no more than 10 lbs for 3 months.

Thank you. That&#39;s a good thing to know. 3 months sounds like a crazy long time, but I&#39;ll have to deal, I guess.

Your surgeon may have a different length. Either way, the time goes by fast.

6 months post op here.  Had mine done in Miami.  Stayed at an Airbnb across from doctors office. They made house calls everyday to check on me for the first seven days my girlfriend as stayed with me 24/7. The first week after surgery your not going to be doing much of anything but laying around.

She&#39;s incredibly nice. Just as an FYI, she&#39;s very particular about BMI. Wouldn&#39;t even consider surgery until I was under 32 BMI. I&#39;m not particularly big, I carry the weight well, but Dr. Ferrando says it&#39;s for aesthetic and healing reasons.

Fellow Ohio native here, though I&#39;m from the opposite end of the state.
</p>
<p>
For the first ~3 days I was in the hospital, with the rest of the week spent at the hotel. I managed to stand briefly after 2, with standing being difficult but necessary to do each day every few hours for some time after (and using a wheelchair most of the rest of the time). Overall, my mom (who was allowed to visit and was basically my caretaker during recovery) handled anything heavy, including moving my ~6 pound laptop. Nurses checked in every so often with IIRC a call button of sorts if I needed things, with water and jello at first and slowly moving to solid food. They also checked in with me at the hotel, along with Dr. Ferrando herself. If you have a caretaker, I&#39;d recommend having them handle moving your dog--if you don&#39;t, I&#39;d mention it to the hotel staff and/or nurses. For time afterwards, though...you might want to ask someone you trust to help with that. If nothing else, bending over isn&#39;t something you want to do initially.
</p>
<p>
Dressings and catheter were removed ~6 days after the operation.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d recommend getting a bath chair and an inflatable donut cushion for the shower. (The former also helps for douching after you&#39;re healed enough to sit properly, since the neovagina doesn&#39;t clean itself.)
</p>
<p>
As for sexual activity: I was able to orgasm again after ~4 months. My clit isn&#39;t quite as sensitive as I&#39;d like it to be, but it&#39;s still entirely functional. I&#39;m slightly tempted to go in for a revision, but that&#39;s more for aesthetic purposes than anything else.

This is all really good stuff to know. My mom will be staying at the hotel with me during that part. Once I get home I&#39;ll have both my parents and my youngest brother available to help me with minor tasks, mom will be the only one I allow for help directly related to surgery.
</p>
<p>
Will definitely look into a bath chair and cushion, too.
</p>
<p>
As for the sensitivity, I&#39;ve heard all over the place, I&#39;ll have to see where this goes.
</p>
<p>
Sorta hoping I can get the healing to progress quickly, I&#39;m not fond of being out of commission. Kinda the only downside to this whole thing. Well, that and the 10 days away from my dogs.

Hey, I just made it to 6 weeks post op. The first 3-4 days will be in the hospital, the nurses check in regularly and you can call them in. I just had a severe pain spike the second night, just make sure to communicate how you&#39;re feeling. Food sucks in the hospital, but 3 days in the hotel the food is amazing, get the flatbread. :)
</p>
<p>
Dr Ferrando and staff check in each day at the hospital so don&#39;t worry too much. They give you a number for your helper/mom/friend to call if anything is wrong. Catheter is annoying but comes out after 6 days, doesn&#39;t stop you from doing the basics. Make sure to walk up and down the hall if you can but take it easy. I passed out when I tried walking across the room on day 2 or 3.
</p>
<p>
Results look great, I&#39;m healing well. Excellent depth and I can tell I&#39;m sensitive at 6 weeks, but a bit careful since I only just got the go ahead to explore physically. Excellent staff at Cleveland Clinic, Dr Ferrando is awesome and I wish you all the best! :)
