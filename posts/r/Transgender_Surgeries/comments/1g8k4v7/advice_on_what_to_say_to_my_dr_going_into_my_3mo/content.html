Yeah maybe its just the limit of our technology. My surgeon is bowers. She’s pretty skilled and things look ok from a distance but its no where near passing unfortunately. I also do know that im privileged and that the results are better than in some other cases.

idk, I think that is passing aside from the scarring. vulvas vary widely.

Absolutely vulvas vary a lot but usually in certain ways with certain things being more fixed. Personally Ive never seen a cis vulva without clitoral frenulum or without a defined hood or with the subclitoal mass that I have. I guess its mostly these three things that im trying to sort my feelings about. Theres always the possibility im super in my head about it but I think some of these things are maybe things I could get improved?

Most people don’t know any of these things. Like I was born with a vagina and idk what most of those words mean or what to look for. It just looks like a vagina to me. The only people who are ever going to clock it are other trans women who have looked very deeply into vaginoplasty or really weird transvestigators who clock cis people half the time. It’s completely up to you if you want a revision but to me that just looks like a vagina.

Thanks for giving a detailed and helpful response. Basically the main thing I’m saying is that the tips of my clit don’t connect to my labia like they do with natal anatomy. This trait is usually super obvious on androgenized natal vulvas but a little less obvious on smaller clits. I was just using medical language to say it. My main concern isn’t that people are gonna know the term or messure the proportions or anything but rather that they just instinctively fell that something is off or fake without being able to name it if that makes sense? I think I’m extra self conscious bc I’m an artist really aware of the anatomy and most of my lovers have androgenized natal vulvas where it’s super obvious how those parts connect. It’s good to hear that nothing looks off to you though.
</p>
<p>
Tbh I think medical professionals and nsfw artists will probably also clock it but it is very very reassuring to hear that that shape doesn’t read as off to the average person who sees a lot of vulvas. I would like to make stealth online sw type content without getting clocked so my main concern is transvesigator type people or really anyone clocking me if I do. I guess the other concern is being able to safely hook up without disclosing my entire backlog of gender trauma

Yeah, for sure. I think most people wouldn’t look twice, especially cis men. I went to school with a boy who confidently told our class that the fallopian tubes were positioned behind a woman’s eyes. A lot of men don’t even know where the clitoris is, let alone other details around it. I really hope you get the results you want and are able to feel comfortable and fulfilled with your new vagina/vulva. I can understand where you’re coming from in the opposite sense as I am pursuing phalloplasty and often worry that the results will not look natural.

Holly shit that story is amazing. I think I definitely may be overestimating cis guys understanding of anatomy. Fingers crossed I’ll be able to pass enough to safely live life the way I want to. Good luck on your phallo! Fingers crossed you can get the best possible results

My vulva is similar, maybe a little less pass tbh, and I do some online sexwork stuff. I got clocked once but it was from scarring.

Thats super helpful to hear ty, what were the consequences like when you got clocked? Did it mess up everything you built? I feel like theres not a lot of girls doing stealth sw but then again how would I know? Definitely been wondering how practical it is so its really nice to hear it mostly works for you

Nah it didn&#39;t mess anything up, honestly there are a few small things about my vulva I think are more clockable than the scars. But I&#39;ve exchanged photos and sex chat and even hooked up with a few guys and only a single guy has noticed. I think we in the community are far more likely to spot another neo vagina than any cis dude, so don&#39;t be too stressed about it.

Just wanted to reply that I had similar things with swelling at three months and they have gotten way better between 9 and 11 months. The swelling just posterior of my clit went down making my clit more defined. The swelling of my mons and labia majors made my labia minora more clear as well as let my hood almost fully cover my clitoris. I too don&#39;t have the like three fold clitoral hood shape, but I have definitely slept with cis women whose vulva has a similar appearance there. It&#39;s more about the structure of the mons than the structure of the hood itself. As for the frenellum... It&#39;s just hard to keep skin rigid like that as it heals. It basically requires making a taught area of the skin which tend to heal rougher. That said, I have definitely seen women with more rounded, less taught frenellum, so it depends. If it really bothers you, this would probably be the easiest change.
</p>
<p>
If your concern is passing though, I really wouldn&#39;t worry. You are well within the range of, only another trans woman would wonder and even then she wouldn&#39;t be sure. And you still have months and months of swelling reduction to go.

Tysm honestly now that i talked to my doctor Im a lot more calm about it and excited to see how it looks in a few months. I really hope it heals the way you described. Honestly its a pretty good result but I just get super anxious and perfectionistic about it. Sadly my doctor said there is no way to make clitoral frenulum but I am definitely keeping my fingers crossed that it does heal in a way that looks similar to the relaxed frenulum you describe.
</p>
<p>
I am glad to hear it passes to most people here. I do some nsfw art so I’m very aware of anatomy and the ways that vulva can be different and things they all tend to have in common so to me the things I mention are super obvious and just freak me out. Honestly ill probably be very satisfied after healing and maybe a small revision for scars and dog ears

I don’t know if it’s possible to make clitoral frenulum in a revision surgery, but there are absolutely surgeons who do it in their primary surgeries. In fact, Suporn has a 2019 paper with photos of this as well as a written description of his technique.

That gives me some hope. I wish I could have gone to suporn but bowers was the best option given my insurance/ income bracket. Maybe someday I can get the body I want. Bowers is great and im pretty happy but wow I really hate when im told things are impossible when they aren’t. I hate that I was rushed through consult without being able to fully explore the limitations of her technique.
</p>
<p>
Honestly what you say makes sense bc I swear Ive seen girls with it on this sub. I guess im going to keep trying to do research, looking forward to reading the paper.

I think it&#39;s less limits of technique at that point and more just like very different styles.  I feel like she&#39;s very upfront about what she can and can&#39;t garuntee from a functional standpoint. And while yes, some surgeons have managed to work in certain appearances, there&#39;s always other areas that are riskier.  There is also the fact that with any structure that small, you can&#39;t garuntee that it will be descernable after healing, so like while it is possible to do, it is pretty much impossible to garuntee. Even if it was part of her method, she&#39;s definitely the kind of person who wouldn&#39;t be comfortable making any promises.

I am a trans man, and your vulva looks almost identical to mine, pre bottom growth. My clitoral hood is completely non existent, to the point my clitoris became desensitised during puberty due to rubbing against my underwear.
</p>
<p>
And I have no labia minora whatsoever. I actually thought there was something wrong with me when I saw diagrams of vaginas in sex ed, and when I saw the gynaecologist for the first time I asked her if I was deformed.

Thats awesome that yours was similar to mine honestly ive never seen natal anatomy that looked like this. Did you clit abruptly end without frenulum? Also if you’re comfortable sharing id love hear what gyno said about how common that is or if your super comfortable sharing it would be potentially to see your anatomy.
</p>
<p>
The wall is really awesome though it definitely reinforces a lot of my concerns overall, pretty much every mold that has a visible clitoris has frenulum. Theres also several neo vulvas on the wall which is awesome. I guess if cis people are looking at it and seeing some srs results up there it does a ton to normalize trans existence. For sure I wouldn’t care about passing nearly as much if cis people would chill tf out haha
</p>
<p>
But yeah seriously that does put me significantly more at ease. Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing!

Yeah im really grateful for her work. Theres more here that I’m happy with than things I want to change. I think everything is done about as well as it could be in a first pass minus the dog earring, which I didn’t really show but probably should have posted. Part of the reason im worried about addressing my future goals is bc I dont want to offend her or come off as un grateful

TERFs are lurking here and downvote everything. It&#39;s still best adviced to ignore any voting when discussing trans related topics as a trans person.

Fair ive gotten a surprisingly fair bit of unhelpful passive aggressiveness on this post from other trans people on this post. I assumed it was that and made that comment out of frustration. I honestly had completely forgotten about all of the lurking twerfs/farts here. Appreciate the recentering

Also at 3 months the whole surgery depression can be real. Keep your bar set reasonable and you will be good

Idk my bar is passing. If i hit the limit of technology before then ill have to figure out what to do but imo its best to assume nothing is impossible until proven wrong. Im probably going to focus on asking for improved anatomy, like a distinct hood and clitoral frenulum. Hopefully thats at least possible

I can say from experience that when swelling goes down your clit lowers, I had a similar experience with it feeling too high up. Hopefully the same will happen for you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d say show her this list after thanking her for everything she&#39;s done for you. I don&#39;t have a clitoral hood either, and on my follow-up, my surgeon said he&#39;d fix that without me even needing to ask. I&#39;d also suggest that if you have someone you trust to help you advocate for yourself that you bring them with you to the appointment.

Thank you that’s incredibly helpful and relaving to hear. Im definitely going to thank them and try to focus on the positives. I honestly have a huge anxiety about coming across as ungrateful or difficult sometimes to the point where im afraid to advocate for myself. Like even if my anatomy is 90% of the way to being fully passing I still wanna try to get as close as possible to 100% but I dont wanna ask for it in a way that sounds entitled.
</p>
<p>
Im really hoping my surgeon will be down to revise my hood and add clitoral frenulum.
</p>
<p>
Thank again I feel a lot more at ease with your comment

I think it might be wise to reflect on what you mean by &#34;passing.&#34;  Once this heals up a bit more, there&#39;s not going to be any real world circumstance where someone will look at your vulva and clock it as trans.  That&#39;s already 100% passing.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like you don&#39;t really mean &#34;passing,&#34; you mean &#34;100% identical to typical cis anatomy.&#34;  It&#39;s not a realistic or healthy goal.
</p>
<p>
Totally fine to ask for a more defined clitoral hood and other aesthetic modifications if it&#39;ll make you happy, but &#34;I need this for my vulva to be cis passing&#34; isn&#39;t a helpful framework and can set you up for disappointment if you run into, as you put it, the &#34;limits of modern technology.&#34;

This. Swelling can take a long time to resolve.  FWIW I had my revision at 8 months postop. You have a good straightforward list to ask her IMO.

Okie y’all heading into the appointment now. Im really grateful for everyone who gave helpful feedback and advice. That helped with my nerves a lot. Sometimes I feel like im crazy for having the concerns I do and really appreciate when people take it seriously. I’m going to ask for help with getting a more natal hood/ a hood at all and ask for clitoral frenulum that extend into my labia minora I’ll probably update yall with how it goes after

Okie final update. I had a really good session with the doctor. I didn’t see my surgeon but got to see another surgeon at the clinic who I also really like and trust.
</p>
<p>
He was very receptive to all of my insecurities and wasn’t offended at all by my questions. Despite what a lot of people here are saying about how it’s perfect and I should just be grateful, he validated and recognized my concerns as real problems and gave detailed information about each one could or could not be addressed. In case anyone is interested or ever comes here with similar concerns here’s what I learned:  -
<strong>
the clitoral frenulum/ connection between the clitoral tips and labia:
</strong>
with the current technology this is almost impossible to solve. It’s likely that it will never be possible to solve even with advances in technology, the two tissues are basically impossible to connect surgically. Basically this feature is present in all natural vulvas and apparently no neo-vulvas, which really sucks. It was really heartbreaking to hear but I’m going to get a second opinion and read more medical literature. He’s almost definitely right but I want to keep some hope for now  -
<strong>
definition/shape of the clitoral hood and labia minora:
</strong>
this is basically as good as it gets with my genetics. They used a stitch to give definition during surgery but it flattened out when healing. On some people it stays and others it doesn’t, i just have unlucky genetics in this case. They could try again but it will likely be an overly risky waste of time and smooth out again.  -
<strong>
the weird tissue south of my clit:
</strong>
this is part of my urinary tract and should get better/ go down automatically over time  -
<strong>
the fat distribution and dog earring:
</strong>
will get better over time but if it doesn’t even out its likely an easy fix with minor surgery and fat grafting -
<strong>
the scaring:
</strong>
if I do get messed up hypertrophic hyperpigmented scarring (likely based on my history) they have a really good techniques for addressing this. This surprised me bc based on what he said it seems like this might be the easiest to fix. It’s also the trait giving me the most dysphoria so im really glad it can be addressed.  -
<strong>
the smell:
</strong>
despite what people on this sub say a super overwhelming and kinda gross smell is actually normal at this stage and will go away/ fade to about the same as a cis woman over time. -
<strong>
sensation:
</strong>
the reason I haven’t been able to orgasm is bc the nerve endings from my old clit that I relied on had to be removed. About 80% are still there but the particular ones I relied on to get me there are gone (The underside near the tip). The good news is that while the endings are gone the nerve itself is still there and will probably reconnect at some point in the healing process but its impossible to predict when or where it will reconnect.
</p>
<p>
I also had granulation which got addressed. Everything else is awesome and textbook perfect, tons of depth and full dilation, good sensitivity in most areas.
</p>
<p>
Having him recognize that I wasn’t crazy for feeling this way while providing detailed information about what is and is not possible really helped with my anxiety and dysphoria.
</p>
<p>
To all the people who gave helpful and kind advice to ease my nerves, I couldn’t be more grateful. It really really helped me face this difficult conversation! Ty!
</p>
<p>
To everyone basically saying to “shut up and be grateful, its good enough” but in a nicer way: why? Why dismiss my concerns and tell me to settle before I even talk to my doctor? Seriously im posting here looking for help in a vulnerable anxious state. It feels like im being gaslit when very real concerns are being dismissed or im being discouraged from raising concerns with my doctors. I mentioned that i was grateful multiple times in my original post, I would never show up to a surgeon without saying thank you. I really hate being hugboxed and condescend to, if you don’t have anything nice or helpful to say you don’t have to leave a comment or interact.
</p>
<p>
So yeah thanks again to the help kind commenters and my doctors, really appreciate everything!

Thank you so much for addressing these things. I get tired that we cannot address these aspects of aesthetics concerning srs. In regards to the sensation issue, are you referring to the frenulum? Or the area immediately surrounding the frenulum? I ask because I&#39;m thinking of getting srs in the future and I&#39;m worried that area might lose sensation and being able to use that area is vital for sex for me.

For sure. Im also so tired of feeling like I can’t talk about it or that wanting to pass is problematic or that I’m being unhealthy for wanting to transition further. I guess the only way to create those dialogs is to keep pushing and talking about it. Fingers crossed we’ll reach a point where we can get more cis normative surgery results in the future.
</p>
<p>
Also yeah unfortunately I do mean that area. That whole underside gets removed. Slighty nsfw description:  &gt;! It feels like that area is still there? Like it doesn’t feel like I have a ghost phallus or anything. It feels like my nerves are in the shape of a vulva if that makes sense. It feels loke those nerves should be connected to the bottom of my clit but aren’t. While I haven’t been able to get off so far I do still feel the desire to. Like I can get super turned on and feel that that nerve bundle really wants to be touched but nothing actually stimulates it. It’s honestly pretty frustrating. Before I used to only orgasm by using a hitachi through jeans on that underside frenulum area so its really scary to figure out if there’s anything that will work for me in the future. Im trying to explore in a low pressure way and see what happens. My priority was aesthetic over sensation though so im happy and a lot more likely to enjoy sex now even if its more about intimacy than orgasm. In the past I refused to take off clothes for sex but now im so happy to be naked, even with all the insecurities I listed here. Every person is super different but id make the same decision again even if I never feel those nerves again. !&lt;

Thanks for all the information. If that whole area gets removed then I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever get srs as I basically would lose the ability to orgasm then. While I&#39;ve been able to do a variety of things to get me up to that point, I&#39;ve never been able to any other way.

Fair fair I would recommend looking into other surgeons and techniques. There might very well be some out there that preserve it. It can vary a lot and I mostly only know about PIV with Bowers. Ill do my best to try and remember to come back and comment here if the sensation returns too. Fingers crossed it will. (I couldn’t feel my scalp until a year after ffs so theres that)

Thank you! I&#39;ve been very much struggling with the realities of what is and isn&#39;t possible in terms of anatomical equivalence of neo vulvas with natal vulvas. People on here love to talk about anatomical variation when there are certain anatomical features that all natal vulvas have and that are not currently reproducible in vulvaplasty/vaginoplasty. Thinking that you&#39;ll get a vulva that&#39;s completely anatomically equivalent and then being disapointed is not a good outcome. We need to be informed of those differences and make an informed decision on whether that is acceptable to us.

Ty, honestly yeah the change emotionally is huge. Before bottom surgery I basically tucked 24/7 my entire adult life and considered my genitals to not exist, being naked even alone was unthinkable. Now I’m infinitely more happy honestly could be naked on the street and barely care. The difference is insane but one of the things thats so hard emotionally is having to reconcile the difference between the optimal theoretical surgical result with the very real and good result I now have. Its such a privileged problem to have tbh and I recognize that but also its definitely gonna take a while to figure the exact limitations of what I can achieve. I’ve been trying to arrange bottom surgery for over 15 years so theres an insane amount of emotion wrapped up in the process. Sorry thats a bit of a vent but yeah I really really appreciate the empathy and kindness. I would love to see how yours healed up especially if you have any pic at the three month mark as well so I can figure out what to expect. Apparently I have a lot of swelling to still go down so my shape will keep developing and im really looking forward to that.

Fair. Hopefully it the scars get fainter over time, on my body surgery scars usually get darker but I’m already saving for medical tattooing. I guess part of why I’m anxious is bc most of my lovers have a natal vulva and Ive never seen anyone without clitoral frenulum. I think cis lesbians might be weirded out by some things. Im also anxious bc im considering doing online sw and don’t wanna get clocked /outed /doxed if I do. I am definitely grateful for all the things that are good and am definitely still celebrating. I think I am getting into my head a little too much and its good to hear that a lot of folks here feel like it passes so far. I guess do you legitimately think I shouldn’t bring up a stage 2/ revision?

+1 on swelling being the likely cause of your concerns. 3 months is still quite early in the process. Rn I&#39;m almost 5 and I have found that swelling has reduced with the dilation reduction in addition to time.

I know it&#39;s hard to watch and wait but just sort of forget about it and enjoy yoga pants!

Like a lot of bottom surgeries you also have your labia minora circle above your canal rather than below it. Who&#39;s your surgeon? I&#39;d like to consider her for a revision.

Yeah they tried their best to get the labia to go as far down as possible but fortunately a lot of cis women have labia that end at the top of the canal too so it bothers me less.
</p>
<p>
Surgeon is doctor Bowers. She’s really good but very busy and famous. Her waitlist is insane and shes not always the most available for checkups or even pre ops. I would still recommend her though. I sought her out specifically bc passing was a huge priority for me. Dr Gunther works with her and I think uses identical techniques and has a shorter waitlist. I might go to dr Gunther for body contouring as well so another good option. Hes the one who I ended up having this appointment with and is always really patient and willing to answer questions.

Can you show me pictures of ciswomen who have minora that don&#39;t circle the canal? Because I have looked at a lot of cisgender vulvas and I have never seen this. It kinda makes me think it&#39;s a bias on this forum that people think it&#39;s normal because so many people have it.

For sure will DM. 100% agree about the bias here based on the responses to this post trivializing my concerns. Its frustrating imo we should be pushing doctors to improve anatomical accuracy instead of shutting down trans women for having these concerns

FTM trans guy here, your results look pretty much exactly like how my genitals looked before testosterone gave me clitoral growth. You&#39;re doing great, and I think your results look great if that isn&#39;t rude to say!

Correct. I currently have this vulva in this form and am dissatisfied it. I am grateful to have a vulva regardless of shape but no amount of self confidence will change how I am treated by society. To my knowledge this is not a shape natal vulvas have and one that could get me clocked. If you have an example of a natal vulva that lacks clitoral frenulum, has the mass of tissue beneath the clit, and lacks a well defined clitoral hood it would help my dysphoria a lot to see pics or documentation of that

Always, I make sure to say this every time. I definitely appreciate the compliment but mostly looking for how I can open the conversation with my surgeon about getting closer to my goals

yea, just list out your concerns, maybe do a little surgical research on google scholar ahead of time in the outcomes, and sit down w them. btw, have u seen the galleries of vulvas? The structure is all over the place! I did a search. I didnt realize there&#39;ve been so many compilations!

The only surgeons in the whole world AFAIK who create a frenulum (what you describe as labia minora extending from clit) during SRS are Suporn &amp; Bank, and they don’t revise other doctors’ work.
</p>
<p>
You do have a clitoral hood, and it is the usual shape for SRS results; you could have it augmented and drawn together during revision.
</p>
<p>
You might benefit from an anterior commissure revision.
</p>
<p>
All that said, this is a really good result.

The technique is quite common and I have similar results but my revision will be for excess skin between the neovagina and the urethra. My clitoris is quite pronounced just simply because it is higher. I like you have not managed an orgasm but relearning is fun and very body shaking just not finishing. Other techniques are giving better results and I like you can see there are differences but revisions are usually necessary after this type of major surgery simply because of the changes after healing time. External work can be carried out for aesthetics but like others have said raise your concerns with your surgeon and get a second opinion from another. You look great by the way, but that’s our perspective 🙂

Tbh I&#39;d be super glad to end up with your result and I think you have unrealistic expectations. But I guess bring up all those things with your surgeon? You seem to have it pretty well laid out already with specific complaints.

You are confusing hopes and desires with expectations. I already talked to my doctor and can confirm I absolutely don’t have unrealistic expectations. Please see the updated comments I made on this post. There is no need to interact if you don’t have anything kind or helpful to say.

I did have something helpful to say. I suggested you don&#39;t need advice from reddit and clearly know what you want and how to articulate it.
