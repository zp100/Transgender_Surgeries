Lagner doesn’t do true ppt she does the same hybrid. He did his residency underneath her at NYU according to my now ex-physiologist that set the CSU trans program up(I moved to CA 6 month ago). I would’ve been his first at CSU if I decided on him last year. Which didn’t make me feel confident. I also wanted full ppt and only Wittenberg, Gallagher, and possibly Joshua Roth perform it in the US. Dr C has assisted and performed surgeries at NYU during his residency at NYU but I wasn’t in a rush and with my insurance I can choose any doctor in the USA. He was really nice though and was going to have my BA with him but the UC system was ridiculous and after 3 months they could not find the time to file with my insurance and get approval so I went else where.

Uc health has an awesome trans program but it’s still very new and there are enough doctors that perform 100’s of surgeries making mistakes that I’m not trying to go to a doctor that has only done 9. I also do not care for lagners aesthetics so I can’t imagine a protege being better.I have not actually heard of a case of ppt where over lubrication was an issue so I think it’s probably a rarity when it happens.

OK... so I know that they have resumed performing GA Surgeries at UC Health, and according to Dr. Higuchi they should be doing 3-4 per week at this point.
</p>
<p>
So... let&#39;s hear from some of you that have had Dr. K and Dr. H do your surgery.  How did it go?  What was the experience like?  Us Rocky Mountain Girls want to know!
</p>
<p>
FYI - I had my consult with Dr. K in early February, and it went well.  He is perhaps a bit reserved, but he answered my questions and took care of referrals for Electrolysis at UCH, as well as a follow up with Dr. H (who wasn&#39;t able to be at my initial consult).  I met with Dr. H in late March to go over some concerns that I had (not specifically related to GAS), and we had a wonderful conversation!  He is very much an outgoing and personable doctor who made me feel very comfortable with my decision to go with UCH.  I am still waiting to begin my electrolysis - they are in the process of getting that setup at UC and I will hopefully get my first appointment very soon.  After that I have a feeling that it will be a combination of time going by very quickly but also not quick enough. ^.^

I will be VERY interested to hear about your experience going forward, if you’re willing to share.  I got a referral to Dr K and have a consult set up with him.

I will absolutely share!   I have been kind of hoping that there would be others that would give some idea of results, since I know for certain they are actively performing the surgeries now, but if I end up being the first I shall be happy to provide an accounting of my experience for those who come afterwards.
</p>
<p>
I feel like we are still at the point in all of this where the more information, the better.  I have already let the team know that I would very much like the full procedure to be recorded so that it can be used for future instruction (and hopefully I will be able to get a copy as well).   I also hope to continue to provide feedback for as many years as I am able to provide for long-term outcome results and experience which ultimately will help to improve the process.
</p>
<p>
I am going through my electrolysis now, and Dr. H (who does the robotic/internal portion of the surgery) indicated that I may very well be able to get my surgery by the end of the year.
