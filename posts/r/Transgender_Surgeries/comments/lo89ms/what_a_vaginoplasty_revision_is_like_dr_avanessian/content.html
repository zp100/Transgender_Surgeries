Hey All,
</p>
<p>
I wanted to write a short post about what to expect in getting a vaginoplasty revision. The word revision seems to have a negative connotation, so I wanted to share what I was told from my recent 1-year post-op check-up with Dr. Bella Avanessian at Mount Sinai. Of course, everyone&#39;s experience will be different in terms of the scope of their revision and their specific needs.
</p>
<p>
First off, I&#39;m extremely happy about the overall aesthetics of my surgery. You truly do not see what it looks like until you are about a year in your recovery. I did have a bit of extra skin in the bottom vagina area that I want removed, and I wanted to have a more defined labia minora on the bottom half of my vagina. Dr. Avanessian said that she is starting a new technique that will fix this, and offered it only as a revision option at this point.
</p>
<p>
The surgery is 3 hours long and is considered out-patient. There is no bowel prep, and you do not need letters for insurance. You will be put under anesthesia. Scheduling is fast. I was told I can have the surgery around April/May (me and a friend have a working theory that surgeons artificially inflate their wait times in order for prospective patients to &#34;think&#34; about their decision).  Recovery is simple. Dilation as normal, but was told for two weeks to really take it easy, and the next two weeks to take it easy, and about after a month, I should be back to normal. That&#39;s it!
</p>
<p>
Also, for those interested, Dr. Avanessian puts on Dolly Parton and Radiohead playlists when she operates.

She showed up in a pink floyd tshirt the day of my surgery

Did you see any significant difference between around 7 or 8 months and 1 year?  Thats where I&#39;m at now and doesn&#39;t seem like things are really changing much anymore.  Also, will you post after your revision how everything went?  I hope to hear more since I might go for a revision too for very very similar sounding things.

I just had a revision with Dr. Ting, and much of what you described held true for me. I was scheduled for a month and a half from the day he looked at what I wanted changed. Just some labia adjustment, some skin that had healed weird, and some internal hair.
</p>
<p>
Took an hour, no letters, went home day of, and 3 1/2 weeks later I&#39;m at close to regular levels of activity.
</p>
<p>
If you need a revision, that&#39;s ok. It&#39;s not a bad thing.

3 hours of listening to Dolly Parton and Radiohead? Is this secretly Guantanamo Bay?

3 hours is quite long for a revision and if you mean general anesthesia that&#39;s unusual too. Must be some major work. I expect the result is going to be quite an improvement.
</p>
<p>
What does it cost?

My insurance will cover it. I don&#39;t have a specific number. Also, being cognizant while be operated on in an operating room would be an unnerving experience and expect anesthesia is the norm.

Hello, I assume that you are either a cyclist or motorcyclist. May I ask how long did Dr Avanessian suggest that you wait before starting to ride again?
<br>
I ma still healing from my initial surgery, but it was decided that a revision will be needed before I left NY thanks to complications.
</p>
<p>
Currently I am missing out on riding season and it is one of my major stress coping mechanisms.

Hey Yeah that was one of my first questions. You probably want to wait like 6 months after the first surgery because those hobbies put so much pressure on the surgery site.

Thanks for the reply.
<br>
Okay, so I am going to have to push for an end of year or very early in year revision then. I can&#39;t miss two seasons. I&#39;m getting old and park riding is a young person&#39;s game.
