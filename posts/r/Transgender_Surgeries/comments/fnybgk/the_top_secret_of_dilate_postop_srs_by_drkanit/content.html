I had the surgery on the 1st of  March 2020 using the technique of scrotal skin graft and I am currently 3 weeks post opp and I am loving the results so far.  My instructions are to dilate twice a day for 30mins. I’m to slowly step up the dilator size and should be on the biggest one . He has given me some cream to mix in with my lube to help the healing process.I have found the trick in dilate is to remove the elastic hair holder around the dilator, To determine the depth.  Dilating was super easy for me and I was up to the largest sized dilator.Here are some photos of my results.

Its not painful or anything unless i go up a size in dilation, I am so happy with the results! Granulation tissue keeps improving.

Personally aesthetics are pretty much my highest priority.I am pretty much just asking about others experiences with Thailand surgeons why you went where you did or didn&#39;t go to a certain surgeon.

Lol, even once you&#39;re completely healed, dilating never really feels good. It&#39;s a hard, rigid plastic thing. But it&#39;s usually uncomfortable or downright painful for the first few months.

I was still a little bit sore until about the third month. After that I was able to start riding my bicycle again, and by month 4 I had no more residual soreness and was able to start having PIV sex. I&#39;m a year post-op and haven&#39;t had any pain or discomfort in several months.

A little uncomfortable (although not painful) and a little awkward (as most sexual firsts are), but for the most part it was absolutely wonderful! I am very fortunate in that I have a partner who took things slow, listened to me, and made sure I was as comfortable as I could be. He never tried to rush me and always reassured me that I was in control. It took a good 20 minutes for him to penetrate me completely the first time (that became less of an issue as time went by; after a month it wasn&#39;t a problem anymore, once I really learned to relax and got used to his anatomy.) I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better partner, and it made that first time a really wonderful experience.

We&#39;re still together, still madly in love, and engaged now ;)
