Dr Chadwal Al Yaghchi in London did my surgery. Had my operation at 10:15 today and woke up around 11:45 ish (wasn‚Äôt with it 100%) As soon as I woke up after about 10 mins I fully came around and was fully conscious. (I come round very quick after general anaesthetic and I don‚Äôt get groggy off it) I was worried about waking up and coughing or waking up and trying to talk but when I woke up it‚Äôs like my body already knew what to do. Nurses were talking to me and I was just nodding and writing things down. I woke up with absolutely no pain and barley and discomfort. I was so surprised because it didn‚Äôt feel like I had an operation. I expect my mouth to be aching from being open for so long or my throat being dry but I literally felt like I just had a nice sleep. Could feel the mucus in my throat as soon as I woke up but it hardly even bothered me as long as you keep drinking water and eating it isn‚Äôt that noticeable. I‚Äôm now back at my hotel still haven‚Äôt taken any pain killers or paracetamol because I literally have no pain. Before I left the doctor came in and said everything went well and he gave me a print out of my before and after photos which is so interesting to see. Over all pain 0/10 discomfort 0.5/10 I‚Äôm so shocked how straight forward recovery is now, I‚Äôm manifesting that it‚Äôs going to say like this

Glad it went well! Please keep us posted as you heal. Did you happen to do any recordings of your &#39;before&#39; voice?

That‚Äôs awesome! Hope your recover goes well!
</p>

Quick question as I am a singer who has considered voice surgery. Are there any concerns with vocal control and resonance post surgery that was discussed with the surgeon? I personally would be very reluctantly consider the surgery if I lost my ability to sing.
</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance!

Hi we didn‚Äôt talk about that as I‚Äôm not a singer although I have been thinking about that because I do like singing. I don‚Äôt have any clue what the effect would be on your singing voice, I‚Äôd imagine you would have to stop professional singing for at least 3-6 months tho as it‚Äôs such an intense surgery. If you google his name you should find an email somewhere and if you ask his secretary she replies really quick !

Wow congrats. Glad the surgery went well. I would love to know how you get on as I&#39;m considering the same procedure in London too.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious do you still need to practice voice training before and after?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been trying to alter my voice forever with no luck and hoping the surgery will at least make me sound more fem. Thanks in advance and hope your recovery goes well üòä

Hi you don‚Äôt need to do any voice therapy before or after the operation as long as you follow the recovery rules and take your time you should be completely fine x
