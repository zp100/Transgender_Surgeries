is a link to my experience during the first part of my consult this past March (2020).
</p>
<p>
<em>
FAIR WARNING:
</em>
<strong>
Lotsa detail ahead
</strong>
<strong>
<em>
&#39;cause details help take away the mystery and these are things I wanted to know before my appointment . . .
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
EDIT: Don’t Forget To Wear Your Mask!
</em>
</p>
<p>
July 14, 2020: The appointment with Dr.&#39;s RBb-L and Zhao was scheduled for 12:30. Not wanting to be late and not fully knowing what to expect due to COVID, we walked the short distance from the hotel and arrived at NYU Langone on 41st Street at about 11:30.
</p>
<p>
Going through the revolving door, there is a set of white cordons immediately to the left. We are directed to go between them and approach the table where two people are seated, conducting the screening process. We were touchless scanned for temperature and asked a standard series of questions about our health and possible COVID exposure. Having completed this, we were directed to our right, across the big lobby to the elevators.
</p>
<p>
Today, there happened to be two men, dressed in suits and wearing masks helping patients get to the correct elevator. We were asked what floor we needed. I told them &#34;7th&#34; and was directed to touch that number on a digital keypad mounted on the wall. The screen flashed a code in big bold characters &#34;B3&#34;. The second suited man pointed in the direction we were to go to get on elevator B3.
<em>
&amp;amp;amp;lt;so, it turns out inside the elevators there is no normal floor buttons panel and are they preprogramed to service certain floors and promote at least a modicum of social distancing&amp;amp;amp;gt;
</em>
We got on the elevator with one other woman (who got off on the 3rd floor) and finished the ride up to the 7th floor. Arrive at 7th, step out and walk a few steps to the corridor to our right.
</p>
<p>
Directly across from us, against the wall of the corridor is a fancy rolled aluminum waist-high sign, the face of which is divided in half with names of Dr.&#39;s/etc. and arrows pointing to the left or right depending on who you are there to see. To the left the arrow on the sign indicates Dr. RBb-L and &#34;Levitt&#34;. Looking left, we can see the reception desk a short distance down the corridor, on the right. We walk to the reception desk. There are two women working the desk and both are busy with patients. Maintaining social distancing, we wait for our turn.
</p>
<p>
In less than a minute, we are asked to step forward by the woman at the far end of the desk. Information is taken about who we both are, and our relationship to each other, and both our contact information. Once I identified as the patient, my wife was asked to take a seat in the waiting area behind us. Here is where it gets a little interesting and admittedly, a bit frustrating . . .
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, maybe I should have made it clear this is my first visit, because I&#39;m told to place my hand on a whole-palm scanner sitting on the counter, next to a large digital monitor.
<em>
&amp;amp;amp;lt;I still haven&#39;t figured this out, was the receptionist trying to identify me by palm print, or trying to match me up/create-connect in the system with a palm print?&amp;amp;amp;gt;
</em>
Anyway, after more than several tries, it fails to scan my palm. Now
<strong>
<em>
she
</em>
</strong>
gets frustrated and types in my answers to her questions. Then as a final coup de grâce she informs me that my card was declined when I made the copayment for the appointment in MyChart.
<em>
&amp;amp;amp;lt;I made the payment some months ago and did not receive any notice there was a problem&amp;amp;amp;gt;
</em>
Now she wants me to pay the copayment. Financials satisfied; I am told to have a seat until I am called.
</p>
<p>
My turn comes when the nurse calls my name and at this point, I&#39;m told my wife cannot accompany me at the consult. I specifically asked this question during the video part of the consult in March and was told she could.
<em>
&amp;amp;amp;lt;my reason for asking was that I wanted her there to hear first-hand what I was being told, rather than retelling after through my filter.&amp;amp;amp;gt;
</em>
</p>
<p>
The nurse leads me back to an exam room, has me stand behind the exam chair while she explains she is going to clean the chair and prep it for me. She wipes the chair down, pulls down the new paper drape, takes out an underpad from the cupboard and places it on the seat of the exam chair. When I tell her that I&#39;m there for the physical exam portion of my consult and ask if I need to remove my clothing, she appears confused, tells me &#34;no&#34;, wads up the underpad, throws it in the trash and tells me to place my belongings
<em>
&amp;amp;amp;lt;purse and folder containing my list of questions&amp;amp;amp;gt;
</em>
on a chair beside me and have a seat on the exam chair. I sit down and she begins going through her list of questions to cover/reaffirm information I submitted in my surgery package last Fall. She then tells me she will return after seeing the doctors to take my vitals. She tells me the doctors will be in shortly and leaves, closing the door behind her.
</p>
<p>
After 20 minutes, the door opens and in walks Dr. Jun. I immediately recognize him from the video consult. He reintroduces himself, explaining he is the opening act for this consult. He revisits and verifies information in my record and asks if I have any questions. I tell him I brought a list (I prepared a list of 62-questions, grouped in three categories; Pre-Surgery, Surgery, Aftercare) and we spend about the next 15+ minutes with him explaining in some detail, answers to most of my questions. I asked him specifically about hair removal prior to surgery. He explained why it is so important to have this done before surgery by saying they want to avoid scraping follicles because that adds time to the surgery and the longer the surgery, the smaller the patient safety factor. He deferred me to speaking with the anesthesiologist when the time comes about those specific questions, and I had a number of questions specific to Dr.&#39;s RBb-L and Zhao. Then Dr. Jun exits to brief the Dr.&#39;s on our meeting and meet with the next patient.
</p>
<p>
After about 10+ minutes, in walks Dr.&#39;s RBb-L and Zhao. Dr. Zhao stands against the wall by the door and Dr. RBb-L sits in a chair in front of me. We reacquaint from the video meeting and answer specific questions I have for them. Then comes the physical portion of the consult. Dr. RBb-L has me stand, lift up my dress and pull down pantyhose and underwear. She examines me and makes a measurement. She asks me how long it had been since I last shaved the pubic/groin area. I explained I had not shaved since before my last electrolysis session, specifically because I wanted her to see the extent of the hair removal and let me know precisely what remains needing cleared. Dr. RBb-L expressed approval for my thinking and progress, re-examined the area and told me to clear the remaining hair on the perineum between the &#34;groin creases&#34; pointing it out specifically and I would be ready for surgery.
<strong>
HUGE
</strong>
Relief, in my mind screaming WooHoo! and silently jumping up and down beside myself with joy. As I recovered dressing, we verified my upcoming appointments, discussed and clarified for me the workings of the surgery cancellation list. Dr. Zhao asked if I could be prepared for a short notice and I replied in the affirmative. I half-seriously told them that if they happened to have an available slot this afternoon, I would be willing to walk over and meet them at the surgery. They appreciated the comment. The Dr.&#39;s thanked me for coming and departed the room.
</p>
<p>
I waited for about five more minutes for the nurse to return, she did not. I gathered my purse and folder and walked out of the exam room. At the small office area across from the exam room, I met with Cheryl, one of my
<em>
Earthbound Angels
</em>
, and expressed my appreciation for all the help she has given me getting to this point.
</p>
<p>
End of the consult appointment. I met my wife in the waiting room and we departed the building.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the couple of small hiccups, there were no issues to dissuade me from moving forward to GRS with this team. AMA.

Looking through your post history, you started the process for a consult in July 2019?
</p>
<p>
When did you actually get the consult scheduled?
</p>
<p>
You had your first consult at the end of March - was your surgery scheduled at that point?  If not, when did you get a date for your surgery?
</p>
<p>
What is the date for your surgery?
</p>
<p>
Dr. RBbL is one of the surgeons I&#39;m highly considering, but you mention a couple of times that the timeline just to get a consult with her is not short.  I just started contacting surgeons last week, and have a consult with Dr. Wittenberg in August.  Still waiting to hear back from the others (Avanessian, RBbL, McGinn).  Also need to talk to people who have had PPT with Selph in Alabama.  It sounds, though, that the two NYC doctors on my list might have wait lists that make this a 2+ year process.

If it makes you feel better about her at all then I&#39;ll add my experiences.
</p>
<p>
I contacted her office in March and had my video consult in April.  My in person consult is scheduled for October 20th.  They have called twice to move the date up, but I live in Texas and have already taken time off work, gotten the plane tickets and hotel or I would have jumped all over that.
</p>
<p>
Since that appointment I have gotten all 3of my letters submitted to their staff, and as of 2 days after my in person on in October I&#39;ll be having my third electrolysis session.  I&#39;ve had A LOT of laser so the staff at E3000 thinks I&#39;ll be completely hair free after 5-6 (August Sept of 2021).   I&#39;m hoping for a date near the beginning of 2022 and per her staff with the letters and hair removal that should be doable without an issue.
</p>
<p>
This will make it 2years from first contact to surgery.  Hope this helps!!!
</p>

I thought the third letter was usually from the endo.  Other surgeons (Wittenberg, McGinn) I&#39;m starting the process with are definitely like that.  I also have Aetna insurance, though I&#39;m so early in the process that they haven&#39;t really been involved yet.  I did get the Clinical Policy Bulletin from them, and it only requires a therapist letter and one from another person in an evaluative role.

My third letter is from my Endo.  She basically put in what med medications are, how long I&#39;ve been seeing her, and any health concerns.  Contacting Aetna they really want more than the 3, but know they can&#39;t require more.   I spoke with a trans specialist to make sure I wouldn&#39;t be missing anything (holy heck this was a bitch to get to), and he mentioned that the third letter is required even though not in their public list of needs.  Rejection is high if you don&#39;t have the third.  It&#39;s stupid.

Thanks!  Therapist, evaluation of therapist, and endo seem to be the standard three, and shouldn&#39;t be hard for me to obtain.

Thanks! And thank you for the thorough write-up. I&#39;ll be traveling from out of town to see RBBL and it really helps to know what to expect so I&#39;m prepared in advance. I really don&#39;t like to leave anything to chance.
</p>
<p>
Did RRBL offer PPV or was that something you weren&#39;t interested in?

From the beginning, all of my interactions with this team specifically centered on Peritoneal Pull-through Vaginoplasty. This is the procedure in which they excel and set the world standard. For me, no other options were ever discussed.

Were you also a candidate for standard penile inversion? I&#39;ve heard some doctors won&#39;t offer PPV if they think PI is sufficient.

IMO, if a surgeon tells you THAT to dissuade you from what you want - RUN AWAY, fast! Do your homework and know what you want and how it is done. Choose to go under the care of the surgeon well experienced in the procedure you seek, with a proven track record, who can deliver the best results.

Thanks, that does help a lot.  And 2 years from start to finish is pretty long.  I could get letters in a month or so if needed, and only need 6-9 months for electrolysis.  I&#39;ll still pursue an initial consult and go from there.
</p>
<p>
Another NYC doctor (Avanessian) told me that they aren&#39;t legally allowed to do video consults for out of state patients.  But you had one with RBbL.  Hmm.

For the second consult, do you have to commit to surgery with her to get that consult?  It appears not, since you don&#39;t have a surgery date yet?

No, you do not.  The initial video consultation was basically meet the doctors and ask questions.  He openly said that she requires an in person consult due to the nature of the surgery.
</p>
<p>
As for time frame,. It could be going quicker, however, I have to be able to save up funds for this.  The 8 weeks out of work is killer (3 weeks vacation time helps, but still another 5), and all the usual bills + staying in NY for 3 weeks.  The cost adds up super quick.  I&#39;m just overly cautious and don&#39;t want to take out loans.

Hmm, k.  8 weeks is a lot.  Is it due to the nature of your job?  I work in front of a computer, and can work from home if needed, and was under the impression that I could start work again after 4-5 weeks.  I could go on my work&#39;s Short Term and Long Term disability, though that does reduce my pay for the duration.  It&#39;s doable though.
</p>
<p>
Understood on the physical exam.  I&#39;m pretty sure all the surgeons require one, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be comfortable working with one who didn&#39;t.  But the initial video consult sounds very informative.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not

far from NYC, and my work is flexible, so I could move faster.  Thanks for the info, I&#39;m going to continue working with RBbL and 3-4 others and see where I&#39;m at after the various consultations.

Nah, my job is currently work from home and all on a PC.  But, reading from other people and most guidelines 6 weeks is the bare minimum advised.  8 is recommended.  With Aetna they blatantly say that GCS is not covered by short term disability.  So, for me, that isn&#39;t even an option.  Unless my job wants to be super freaking nice when I put in for the FMLA I fully expect to need to have at least a months pay for normal expenses.  Then the surgery expenses, travel, etc....
</p>
<p>
Dr. BBL does want you within 1 hour of the hospital for the 2 weeks following surgery.  So if you&#39;re outside of that expect to be staying in NY or NJ for at least 2 weeks after your surgery.

Understood on the 2 weeks.  That seems pretty standard.    And NYC is much closer than San Francisco or Alabama.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t asked my work about disability, but I think that&#39;s an employer policy?  I guess insurance might be involved, I&#39;ve never had reason to look into it.  All the various travel and other costs do add up after a while.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully I hear from BBL and Avanessian this week and schedule video consults and go from there.

I have to get out of the habit of answering questions on this Sub when I’m tired and about to execute Taps (Navy term meaning “Lights Out” piped on every Navy ship at 2200 hours, every day).

is the correct link and I added comments to this post as updates with new news.
</p>
<p>
It was one year ago this month and I was given the original consult date of February 2021.
</p>
<p>
Cheryl contacted me within several days after the video consult back in March and gave me a surgery date, May 6, 2021.

I would be curious to see your question list... if it wouldn’t be to intrusive.    It sounds like your very detailed and very thorough.

Some number of others have made/asked the same comment/question. I’m willing to share however, have to figure out how (format, due to creating them in Notes on my iPhone bc it was an easy way to create/organize/keep track of the questions whenever they came to mind).
