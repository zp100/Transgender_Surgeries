There is a lot of information about how the various electrolysis techniques work from a technical point of view and lots of resources on numbing and where to go, but I wanted to share other things I&#39;ve learned in my 140 combined hours of electrolysis all over my body (I&#39;m still not done!).
</p>
<p>
The success of electrolysis on a single follicle depends on a whole host of factors. It&#39;s important to be aware of these factors to make sure you&#39;re not wasting time and money.
</p>
<h1>
The modalities - six in one hand
</h1>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of info out there on the different modalities but not much beyond how they work.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pure Galvanic
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is the original modality, the most rare, and the least painful. An electric current is passed through the follicle, which causes moist hair to turn to lye, which damages the follicle. It takes a long time, like 30 seconds or more to treat a single hair. In the old days they would stick several probes in at once to treat large areas. An analogy of how this modality works is like dumping poison in a flower pot and then pulling out the stalk. It slowly damages or kills the flower -- it makes the flower grow back much weaker or just die.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pure Thermolysis
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This modality uses pulses of radio waves to try and heat up the follicle enough to kill parts of it or destroy it entirely. It can be the most painful, depending what settings/equipment are used. Hairs are treated in just a few seconds. An analogy for this method is like stabbing at the flower pot with a trowel and then plucking the stalk of the flower out, hoping you damaged enough of the root to kill or weaken the flower.
</p>
<p>
The power of the pulses can be customized. For instance cis women with vellus hair only need lower power blasts. More coarse hairs may need several lower-powered pulses that, combined, more gradually heat up the follicle. Alternatively, the electrologist may deliver fewer higher-powered pulses.
</p>
<p>
The size of the probe can be adjusted as well as the amount of insulation around the outside of the probe. Bigger probes offer a wider blast radius but can be more painful on insertion or cause more indiscriminate heating and thus more discomfort. Insulated probes help focus the energy to reduce pain but need to be aimed more accurately.
</p>
<p>
This method covers more area per session, but several passes have to be done over the same area to get hairs that were only weakened, or those that were missed as they weren&#39;t grown out at the time of the last treatment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Blend
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Blend combines galvanic and thermolysis. The probe runs a current that produces lye and then warms up the follicle using lower-powered radio pulses. It&#39;s usually less painful than thermolysis. Machines can be calibrated to produce differing amounts of lye and different levels of radio pulses. It still takes several seconds per hair while the lye is generated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Modalities compared
</strong>
</p>
<p>
In the long run, there is no big difference between thermolysis and blend. You end up treating the same amount of hair. Some electrologists just prefer thermolysis because with no electrical current there are fewer worries about complications with certain medical conditions or pregnancy. Done incorrectly, thermolysis can also cause bad scarring if too much is done on high density areas or power levels are set too high.
</p>
<h1>
Moisturize!
</h1>
<p>
Electrolysis works best on well-hydrated skin. It&#39;s important with all modalities because they rely on interactions with water to function. So keep hydrated. Wear a moisture mask the night before. Use a greasy moisturizer like Eucerin Advanced Repair on the days leading up to your appointment. Exfoliation is also important.
</p>
<p>
Different areas of the body also produce different qualities of hair. Facial hair is usually much more moist than chest, arm, or pelvic hair. This means it can require more passes to destroy non-facial hair.
</p>
<h1>
Know your cycle
</h1>
<p>
The hair growth cycle is an extremely important factor but I rarely see an information about it online. Electrolysis is most effective when hair is in the growth (not resting) stage. This happens after you pluck a hair and it regrows. Because of this, the first pass over an area is less likely to permanently kill hair versus when an area has been previously treated. This means it&#39;s best to keep a regular schedule where the same areas can be re-treated.
</p>
<p>
Growth cycles are shorter for facial hair (6-8 weeks) and longer elsewhere on the body (about 10 weeks).
</p>
<p>
The longer a hair goes between clearings, the deeper a root can establish itself. This makes it more resistant to damage (meaning a less likely kill) and means more pain because the heat is being applied to an area closer to the nerves. So stay on top of your growth cycles!
</p>
<p>
The bottom line: make sure you retreat the same area every 6-8 weeks, otherwise you spend money and hours on less effective clearing on out-of-cycle hair.
</p>
<h1>
Don&#39;t be a martyr
</h1>
<p>
There are lots of tips on numbing creams, drugs, and other techniques. But the issue of numbing is important. If you go to a session with no numbing, unless you are incredibly pain tolerant, the electrologist will likely turn down the power or else you&#39;d run out the door screaming in pain. They&#39;ll also work more slowly as rapid treatment causes pain to build. Effective numbing means the electrologist can crank up the power, which means a more likely kill, as well as allowing them to work faster because they&#39;re not worried about your pain levels.
</p>
<p>
This is another area where large volume sessions (4-8hrs with multiple electrologists) are a big advantage. You&#39;re completely (well usually) numb so they can work at max speed.
</p>
<h1>
Every hair is special
</h1>
<p>
Some hairs grow more horizontally out of your skin. This makes it hard to position the probe and can mean more pain as the hair crosses over more area and thus has a higher chance of overlapping any nerve endings.
</p>
<p>
This seems to be true for me, that the left side of the body tends to be more sensitive and has more hair growth, which makes for a bad combo. This is possibly due to higher blood flow on the left side of the body. Not sure how scientific this actually is tho...
</p>
<p>
Hairs that are only damaged by electrolysis will grow more slowly and grow finer. This means you should allow plenty of time for hair to grow out before a session on areas that have already been treated.

What they don&#39;t tell you about electrolysis is that it&#39;s about 500 times more painful than laser and you&#39;d probably rather go through the latter every few years than have your face incinerated one follicle at a time every week for years on end.

Oh no no. It would only be a spot treatment or two here and there. Laser&#39;s
<em>
really
</em>
effective. Electrolysis is touted as the gold standard because the hair could literally
<em>
never
</em>
come back.

i love lasers, the way cats respond, the way sharks use them, and the way they zap my hair away, the only down side is they do not work on light or gray hair.  That being said a combo of both is a great way to go, Kill-um all.

My Electrolysis clients tell me how painful their laser was - crying during laser, needing to stop every 5 min, etc. I have Electrolysis that fall asleep during their session, very few require numbing cream. Most fall between those 2...and find it quite tolerable...not feeling most of it and then occasionally some &#39;spicy&#39; ones.
</p>
<p>
The FDA Consumer Health Information Bulletin of 27 June 2007 states &#34;The US. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes electrology as providing permanent hair removal, The FDA identification in Title 21, CFR, Sec 878.5350 for needle-type epilators is: &#34;a device intended to remove the hair by destroying the dermal papilla of a hair&#34; As no other device for hair removal has the unique identification of &#34;destroying the dermal papilla of a hair&#34; only electrologists are allowed to claim permanent hair removal in their advertising

<p>
Yeah, no kidding. This is very important. Patience is the name of the game. You, or your electrologist, may feel like you just can&#39;t wait to zap those hairs, particularly if you&#39;ve been at it for a while and progress is frustratingly slow. This mentality leads to overtreating, which leads to scarring.
</p>
<p>
What seems to be particularly bad is trying to clear a sensitive area - such as the upper lip - of all hairs, 100%, in a single sitting. Density of hair on the upper lip is high and if you treat them all (with thermolysis), that is a
<em>
lot
</em>
of heat applied per square milimeter of skin, over and over and over again.
</p>
<p>
The skin does not like that at all and you can develop scarring, &#34;pitted&#34; skin, which is going to look weird even with makeup on, because the makeup goes into the the little pits which creates a fairly weird effect.
</p>
<p>
Make sure to choose a good,
<em>
patient
</em>
electrologist. There are some out there who may have good technique, but are a bit reckless, and will overtreat you in order to get a result. The skin has an amazing capacity to heal, but if you&#39;ve been overtreated too many times...there is only so much healing that the skin is capable of.

I&#39;ve seen enough work from purported &#34;experts&#34; on Hairtell to come to the conclusion that everyone there is in denial. Hairtell electrologists are quick to tell you that electrolysis scarring is so rare as to not be a concern. I see scars here among Los Angeles girls all the time.
</p>
<p>
Whenever a client brings up Hairtell with me, I tell them straight up: Andrea James has never zapped a single hair!

It could be your tolerance but it could also just be your electrologist turning down the power or using more galvanic. If it&#39;s the case they&#39;re using low power thermolysis, it could mean you have to do more hours than necessary because they&#39;re not frying it enough. Or your hair could just be fine enough for low power to work ok.

I do a lot of single-needle galvanic work. Many of my clients zonk out unless I&#39;m on a particularly sensitive part like the upper lip. Similarly, I&#39;ve slept through plenty of galvanic, although I&#39;m really only able to do it if I got just a few hours of sleep the night before. I&#39;ve last seen a galvanic tech (Electrolysis by Christy in Hayward, I don&#39;t get anything for plugging her) about a month ago to get about 10 stragglers off of my neck, and at 0.5 mA, it really felt like nothing.
</p>
<p>
The only thermolysis I&#39;ve experienced is practicing on my leg for school, and I wouldn&#39;t last with that on my face.

Do you think galvanic is the most effective, but no one uses it anymore because it takes too long?   I had 20hrs, but it all grew back....I think blend or thermolysis, but it seemed more like they were plucking. I stopped going for now.

No one uses it because

Treating a thick hair takes about 15 seconds, roughly, so the time to an initial clearance is longer (even though the regrowth rate for galvanic is lower)

Galvanic technology is old and inexpensive to make, and there isn&#39;t much room for an epilator company to distinguish itself with technological innovations. You can clear someone with a 9V battery or a power supply, if you feel up to it. Contrast this with thermolysis, where you can vary the frequency or have it come out in bursts or something, file a patent, and charge $10K for your machine. A lot of schools are paired up with epilator manufacturers, so thermolysis is primarily what they learn.

Same. As long as we&#39;re not working on the lip, or on the soft parts of the neck under the jawline, I&#39;m out like a light. Tbf, I&#39;ve done about 90 hours at this point, so I&#39;m just kinda over it.

Same. I went through it for months and I have all of
<em>
one
</em>
cycle of hair that&#39;s white. The rest are still dark brown. And being on progesterone makes it
<em>
unbelievably
</em>
painful.

I had this experience with blend also, with 2 different operators. I am now having treatments with galvanic and I&#39;m so far much more satisfied with the results.

While someone said thermolysis can scar, I had so much pitting from going through multi-needle galvanic. My skin would be raw for two weeks and I couldn&#39;t shave for just as long.
</p>
<p>
Yet thermolysis has been the lifesaver for me. I just wish my insurance would cover it for face clearing and not just as GCS prep. Hell, they cover everything but hair removal, so I&#39;m going to start fighting them after healing from surgery

I definitely have some scarring on my chin. A friend of mine got 3rd degree burns during large volume genital thermolysis. My electrologist even commented once about how she notices lots of women with electrolysis scars.

That&#39;s Electrologists using too high settings. They don&#39;t know their machines or didn&#39;t get adequate training....not watching for skin reactions.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s absolutely no excuse for any kind of burn, using Electrolysis. I hope that person reported the Electrologist.

There&#39;s absolutely no excuse for your Electrologist scarring you - their settings were way to high and they weren&#39;t watching for skin reactions.

Yeah, but you-know-who is running absurdly high with her galvanic setup. It&#39;s criminal that she&#39;s considered an expert at MNG.

What would you recommend for numbing the face for an electrolysis session?
