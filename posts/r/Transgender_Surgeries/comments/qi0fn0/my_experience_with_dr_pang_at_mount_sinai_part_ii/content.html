Hi ok I just got home from vaginoplasty today. Honestly could not have had a better experience in the hospital. My room was private and there were only 6 patients on our floor. Maybe is normal? They said they were busy. I felt very cared for by the nursing staff. Received congratulations a couple times and generally really liked them all a lot.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Pang came to the prep area before surgery to just explain what was happening and the rest of the day. I was very nervous. Because who wouldn‚Äôt be. He was very reassuring and told me of course that‚Äôs normal but that this is exciting, and to be excited! And it worked. Brought me back to the reasons why I was doing this :‚Äô) he really does have the best bedside manner. Ok enough w the gushing. After surgery I didn‚Äôt see him, only several of the PA‚Äôs- they reassured me because of course I can‚Äôt have a first impression until next week. They said it went really well and I should expect beautiful results, which really reassuring (maybe they say this to everyone lol)
</p>
<p>
Some not great things: it feels so so premature to be out of the hospital after 3 nights. I really would have been more comfortable being there for a full week/ when the packing comes out :/ but this was told to me ahead of surgery so I knew the deal.
</p>
<p>
Also I would have really liked to see him after surgery. Actually I even asked if I would see him in recovery, I guess that was too vague a question. Maybe this is unreasonable but I want the man who did this to say he did it well to me afterwards lol.
</p>
<p>
Soo that‚Äôs it. Feeling really good and excited but won‚Äôt really get it till I have the wound vac off and catheter out. This was the first time in my life I didn‚Äôt instinctually hide when nude in front of the woman nurses, and a couple times I did a bulge check to my new vagina to make sure nothing was showing. So I guess it‚Äôll take a minute ha but I couldn‚Äôt be happier so far.  I‚Äôll post one more time during healing and let you know how it‚Äôs going ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

That&#39;s standard practice at mount Sinai as it stays in for 7 days prior to removal at the week1 post op appointment.
