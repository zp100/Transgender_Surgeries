Jeez! It&#39;s a lot! My surgeon gave a shopping list, which is like 2/3 of it. I used only 1/2 of that shopping list.
</p>
<p>
Now I don&#39;t know what to do with those Hibiclens bottles and other stuff. I strongly recommend not to stock up stuff that is not needed immediately after the surgery.

Agreed, I had like 3 packages of menstrual pads i never used, I ended up mailing a lot of stuff to other people who were about to go through it.
</p>
<p>
Except lube... because you always need lube
</p>
<p>
There is something to be said about being ready though, not having something sucks when you have to send someone to get it and can&#39;t do it yourself...

Lube costs are not insignificant. Around $500 for the first 6 months depending on your dilation schedule.

I use 4-packs of these. I use roughly 5 4-packs a month. Just to make sure it heals properly. I don&#39;t put the lube directly inside. I put it on a dilator and spread more or less evenly

There should be some boundary. It comes down to $$. Agree in general.

<ul>
<li>
Lip balm (recommended, didn&#39;t get to use - wasn&#39;t a big problem)
</li>
<li>
Cranberry juice (a lot! - really needed)
</li>
<li>
Prune juice (really good for the bowel prep)
</li>
<li>
High protein drinks/snacks - you will need energy after your surgery.
</li>
<li>
Vitamins and supplements (check with your surgeon)
</li>
<li>
Long skirt (so you could travel with a catheter)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now things I&#39;d question above
</p>
<ul>
<li>
An electric heating pad or some rice bags - it&#39;s not really required.
</li>
<li>
Loose panties a size too big, you really don&#39;t want anything pressing on your pubes mons after surgery for the first while - depends on the surgeon. I wore tight shorts so things and sutures are staying intact while I move.
</li>
<li>
A lube injector - one can squeeze lube onto a dilator and spread it evenly if necessary.
</li>
<li>
A hospital buddy or 4 to visit - great if you have it. My surgery was during COVID high times when no one was allowed in the hospital. Just needed someone to pick me up.
</li>
<li>
A portable fan - did not need one at all. 1) didn&#39;t have to stop hormones 2) wasn&#39;t too hot even in June.
</li>
<li>
Dakin solution - largely depends on the surgeon. Soap was fine for me. My surgeon insisted that that may be too harsh for that area.
</li>
<li>
Pads - this is variable. I bought a lot, used a few. What I needed was a lot of pantyliners as I didn&#39;t bleed a lot.
</li>
<li>
White vinegar, for douching and all other stuff related to douching - largely depends on the surgeon. Didn&#39;t use it first 6 weeks. After 6 weeks I could go to a store and buy it myself.
</li>
<li>
A donut to sit on - not really questioning. This is a must. But the best is one that is specifically for post-pelvic floor surgeries.
</li>
<li>
some ambian or some other sleep aid - Benadryl works well.
</li>
<li>
invest in a bidet system - I could invest into it, but found I can manage without it with a bathtub
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I understand that everyone is different and every surgeon is different. This is why this list will never be written in stone. My surgery was a breeze. I could walk up the stairs on the 3rd day and on 10th day I could take an 8-hr ride home easily. I had very little pain and very little bleeding.
</p>
<p>
One thing I&#39;d like to add after back and forth with
<a href="/u/HiddenStill">u/HiddenStill</a>
. Not everything needs to be purchased upfront. I also agree with &#34;money vs risk&#34;, but there is also the time aspect.

Totally agree, I spent a week in the hospital myself, due to getting pneumonia the first day post op and nearly dying. My cath was out by the time I left, so no skirt was needed, though that is a good one and I will add it to the list.
</p>
<p>
Lip balm is another good one I didnt think of
</p>
<p>
Heating and/or rice bags, though not required were super nice in my recovery.
</p>
<p>
And though it is awesome your surgeon didn&#39;t require you to stop hormones, a lot do.
</p>
<p>
Lube injector, really does make dilating early on easier, not required by any means but it is so nice being pre lubed and ready to take that thing as opposed to feeling like you are forcing it
</p>
<p>
I am going to add some of these to my list for sure and make some edits, thanks

Yeah, I will have to type that once I get onto a computer. It&#39;s tough to type it on the phone while dilating. :)

Considering how sitz bath seems to be on so many &#34;required&#34; lists, what ended up being fucking worthless about them? What do you do instead?

If it is on your required list from your surgeon, by all means, get one. I wasn&#39;t allowed to soak mine for like a month, didn&#39;t want to weaken the skin near the sutures or the stitches themselves. By that point I didnt feel the need to soak that area for soothing effect, could just take a bath for the rare occasion j wanted to. Never used mine once it was a waste of money for me

If it&#39;s supposed to be for soothing effect rather than something medical, then that makes sense. I couldn&#39;t tell from peoples&#39; shopping lists what the primary purpose was. Is it just so you don&#39;t have to expend limited energy getting into an actual bath.

Better than trying to immerse one&#39;s self in a Clairol Foot Fixer, I imagine, but that&#39;s got a vibrate mode ;)

Thanks for sharing your experience!

I do not know. Dilating isn&#39;t painful as much as it is uncomfortable.
