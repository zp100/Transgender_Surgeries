I would definitely be careful with them and rhinoplasties, you can read my last post and honestly I was being nice about it. They did mine without a curve as well. I did mine 2 years ago and I would count as someone in that 96% that never had a revision with them because I do not trust them as they did such a bad job. At least people don&#39;t know I have had a rhinoplasty I guess because no way would anyone get a nose job that looks like mine.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to get a revision sometime soon and it costs more to get a revision than a first rhinoplasty so bare that in mind. I&#39;m not saying it will be a bad rhinoplasty of course but read reviews from people who have actually had surgery, I noticed there are a lot of complaints about their rhinoplasties before I had mine but ignored it and now regret it.
</p>
<p>
(Also consider that I have thick skin on my nose, he could be better if you have thin skin)

That sucks, I&#39;m sorry :(
</p>
<p>
On the flip side, people are far too lost in their own worlds to notice changes in others so I wouldn&#39;t judge your progress on their reactions alone
</p>
<p>
Personally I am looking for more subtle changes so maybe FT is good for me though... ðŸ¤”

One of the FT members raul bellinga seems to have specialized in rhinoplasty although I&#39;m not entirely sure - how FT actually does their work. Probably the thing to do is sort of the standard - for your specific surgeon do you like the noses they&#39;ve done? Have you asked
<em>
them
</em>
for their revision rates ? Have you talked to them about what you want and what you feel the risks are?

<p>
Yeah that&#39;s absolutely what I want. I feel like I am so close to being happy with myselfâ€”aside from brow reduction I just want to do some minor adjustmentsâ€”and I would hate to have post-surgical complications or permanent loss of sensation because they went too deep.

Facial Team published a paper with the complication or revision rate at 4%, which is I believe is very low as these things go. I think its normally one of the more risky procedures.
</p>
<p>
What it means exactly is not quite so clear, as they probably don&#39;t have much experience with ethnic noses, or maybe they don&#39;t do large changes that would risk high complication rates?
</p>
<p>
I expect that if you fit their normal customer base they are a very safe option. There&#39;s very few reports of complications of any kind with Facial Team, and I think most of them were rhinoplasty and a long time ago.

The FT specialise in everything from hair line down to tracheal shaves. A rhinoplasty is probably the most requested item that they do as most women are not happy with what they have. I would be perfectly confident that if I wanted a rhinoplasty they could mould that schnoz into a masterpiece.

Their team member Raul Bellinga does a superb rhino. When the FT works on your face you actually have a few surgeons working on you during the procedure, each with their own specialty. And they&#39;re
<em>
ALL
</em>
masters in their craft.

FT patients don&#39;t have complications from their surgery. If you hear anyone complaining about their nose work it is often because it looks too natural for them or something but not really cause they have complications or got botched.

There is no perfect surgeon. All surgeons fuck up sometimes. There are factors out of a surgeons control that will cause complications as well because we are dealing with biological systems.

There are even some complications listed here for this cohort.

Yeah I know but usually when a very good surgeon fucks up once it is relatively minor or if it is bad it is a genuine error. Unlike badly skilled surgeons with poor training, lack of aesthetic eye and lazy approach such as one size fits all who usually would have a history of unfixable and disastrous disfigured patients along with body count. For example, a patient of FT recently who had lower face ffs ended up with rolled in lip. It wasn&#39;t bad but her lower lip is 50% thinner. That&#39;s one unpredictable issue but is again minor. Compare that to Kathy Rumer, butcher Bart and some of Spiegel&#39;s etc.

Yes a good surgeon seeks to mitigate and minimize risk and complications. However, the possibility is ever present.
