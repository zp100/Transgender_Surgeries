Hi ladies!
</p>
<p>
I have been for about 4 months and am researching potential surgeons who have good reviews from the community. Has anyone gone to see him for SRS, top surgery, facial feminization, etc?
</p>
<p>
I hear about Dr. Christopher Salgado at the University of Miami, but to avoid him at all costs!
</p>
<p>
Let me know!
</p>

Absolutely do not go to Salgado. If you&#39;re in Miami you should consider Vartan Mardirossian.

Mardirossian is an amazing surgeon for FFS and Vocal Surgery from what I see online; however, he is located in West Palm Beach which is about 1-2 hours drive (regular traffic from Miami). Thank you for supporting not to go to Salgado!

No problem. I&#39;m honestly surprised Salgado is still in practice after what he did on Instagram.
</p>
<p>
Also. 2 hours of traveling is nothing for FFS. I&#39;m going to Mardirossian and I live 1000 miles away.

I&#39;d recommend doing some research. Salgdo&#39;s reputation is quite something

It went good! I ended up having surgery with him &amp; I am super happy with my results! I will be posting updates here at 6 months or a year. I am currently 3 months post-op. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. :)

I have but there’s not much new info aside from what I dug up. I know he and his partner (also a doctor at the practice) work together at the former Reed center under Dr. Harold Reed (retired). But since Dr. Reed had a not so good reputation in the community and not much info of Dr. Whitehead and Dr. Ramirez specifically in SRS, I’m hesitant. However if I were at the stage to move forward with a consultation, I’d vet them well before making any additional decisions.

Personally I view few reviews as high risk, and not something you can reduce by meeting the surgeon. Perhaps you’ll get lucky.

I can agree with you there, just wish he offered better priced consultations. He’s pretty pricey

So I looked up more information on him and here is what I found:

</p>
<p>
This is a link to his own website regarding their practice and with whom he works with and their practice for Transgender people:
<a href="https://www.restoremedcenter.com/srs/our-practice" rel="nofollow">Restore Med Center</a>
. They have a separate section of their website that&#39;s for cisgender people seeking plastic surgery (click
<a href="https://www.restoremedcenter.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
for that website if you want).
</p>
<p>
It does say he works with his husband (Dr. Alain Ramirez) and they work on the anesthesia and surgeries for trans women alongside Dr. Christian Quintero. However, back on March 23, 2020, it was reported by WPLG Local 10 News they contracted COVID-19. Not sure if they recovered or what happened since I can&#39;t find any other news articles or chatter on their website about them and their statuses. You can check out the article here
<a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/03/23/doctors-in-miami-dade-diagnosed-with-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Doctors in Miami-Dade Diagnosed with COVID-19</a>
.
</p>
<p>
But yeah this is all the research I can find without repeating results from what was previously mentioned. Hope this helps!

FYI!
</p>
<p>
The youtube video is SUPER helpful. Lally gives such an in-depth review of her SRS from coming down from NY to Miami, experience post-surgery (like a few days after). She shows pictures (graphic disclaimer) after her surgery. Lally said that Dr. Whitehead apparently did not give much after pain medication?  Which to me is odd, but I guess due to not wanting patients to get addicted to pain killers?
</p>
<p>
Tl;dr: Lally (the Youtuber) is happy with the results but goes in-depth on her experience with SRS with Dr.John Whithead. She does not sugarcoat her experience post-surgery but said it was the best decision she made in her life.

Hi! sorry to hop into an old thread.  I was wondering if you knew anything about the YouTube link “SRS- the real truth...” being set to private?
</p>
<p>
Also, after a year, have you heard anything else about him/their practice?
</p>
<p>
Thank you already for compiling so much good info.  It’s all super helpful!

Hey everyone my gf is planning to see Dr.Whitehead but she has not been able to find any videos of people giving honest reviews of his work. Does anyone have any positive reviews for him. I want her to make the best decision for herself and have her in good hands. I hope someone can help me.
