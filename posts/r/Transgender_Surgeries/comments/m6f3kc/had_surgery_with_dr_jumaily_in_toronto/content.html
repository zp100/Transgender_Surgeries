I had some chin/jaw surgery with him last week and he really goes out of his way to help you. I&#39;ve met so many surgeons before but no one like him &amp; i&#39;m very appreciative . We are so lucky to have Dr. Jumaily in Toronto i feel so dumb that I flew all the way to California for my initial FFS surgery when I could have got better surgery right in Toronto.

i’m so glad to hear that you had a great experience with him!
</p>
<p>
I have been considering about Dr Jumaily lately. I plan to have a consultation with him soon.
</p>
<p>
I wonder....how expensive compared to Dr Bensimon?
</p>
<p>
and you look gorgeous in your IG!

hi thank you! that is how i looked before ffs with keojampa. I just dont have too much experience with Dr.Bensimon I did have a consult with him but he wasn&#39;t too helpful and I thought his prices were not that attractive to go to him at the time.
