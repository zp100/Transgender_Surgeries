4 weeks ago today I had zero-depth vaginoplasty in Montreal with Dr. Brassard. Here are a few pictures showing my recovery so far:

There&#39;s no before pictures.

My recovery has been smooth so far, with no complications that I&#39;m yet aware of.  I&#39;m pretty happy with how it turning out, too. There&#39;s some asymmetry, but of course I&#39;m still swollen for the most part, so that might get better. I&#39;m not bothered. Feeling is coming back pretty well, plenty of electric shocks and noticeable reduction in numbness. I still have yet to explore my clitoral area, but I can begin tenderly doing so next month.

<p>
My reason for choosing Zero-Depth was for my own mental health, and at this point I don&#39;t regret that choice. Of course, it&#39;s still early, but I&#39;m at ease with my smoother recovery and having no need to dilate.

Oh exciting!! I had mine November 30th, and I heard back from them about that date mid September. I believe with COVID restrictions still in place for traveling, local people (Canadians) are getting their surgeries much quicker. I&#39;d expect to have your date in March/April then!

I had â€œminimal depth&#34; with Wittenberg. I read the path report from the lab after surgery, and it described the shaft of the penis having no skin on it, and then a second section which was the head minus the part used for the clit, and that was the only part with skin on it. But I also ended up with about 8cm depth, not just a tiny dimple. I still don&#39;t need to dilate, as a think that need comes from a) the fact that they cut and push past many more muscles for full depth, and/or b) scar tissue that could form at the junction of penile skin with scrotal skin inside the vagina. I do believe that what
<em>
was
</em>
discarded in my surgery was more scrotal skin vs penile skin.  The latter was used to line the inside of labia minora and to line the vaginal cavity.

Of course not everyone has good experiences, but I&#39;m certain it&#39;s a vocal minority! Everyone there was so kind and helpful, and my recovery was smooth. I hope you have an easy time!

Iâ€™m kind of a bit worried. Iâ€™m contemplating on either no depth or depth &gt;~&lt;

I have a burning question about this surgery: do you know what they do with the penile tissue? Is it used to make a sensate introitus or does it get discarded? I have thought about a zero depth surgery but I want to make sure that any tissue that could potentially provide erogenous sensation will be preserved. Thanks for any insight you can offer and I hope you continue to heal well.

Honestly I&#39;m unsure, and kind of wish I knew! Of course, with zero-depth, not all parts can be used. The length of skin that would become the canal does not get used for the most part I believe. Don&#39;t know for sure, though.
