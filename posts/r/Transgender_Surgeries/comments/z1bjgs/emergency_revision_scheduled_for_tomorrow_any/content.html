Last week I went to go see my doctor about how I’ve been struggling for a few months with having intercourse and dilating. He and another doctor did an internal exam and came to the conclusion that I have vaginal stenosis from scar tissue building up in my canal causing objects to not be able to go in more than an inch or so.
</p>
<p>
He scheduled me for an emergency revision tomorrow morning so he can go in, remove the scar tissue and add a graft to give me more width and depth. I’m really glad it isn’t a more serious issue and I’ll be able to finally enjoy sexual activity with my significant other.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who had a revision, how did it change everything for you? Was it better? Or worse? And what was the healing process like? Shorter or about the same as before? Just trying to see what I’m in for from the first time I had GRS a few months ago.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

This is a fairly common problem thats fixed with revision. It&#39;s critical here that you understand how this will be done and the intended aesthetic outcome. Do not just assume in your head what it will look like --discuss the details.

I just had the same revision last month. So far so good! Dilating is much easier

I have several friends with revisions, and 1) they vary
<strong>
widely
</strong>
in the amount of work that needed to be done, so 2) the recovery varied very widely, as well.
</p>
<p>
Was your original surgery a Penile Inversion?
</p>
<p>
Hope all goes well!

My original went fine. It’s just the scar tissue that’s causing the issues. My doctor wants to add more because while everything is in tact, the canal would be a little wider and add depth which I’m excited about!

Only labeled as “emergency” because my doctor won’t be available until sometime next year if we postponed because of the holidays
