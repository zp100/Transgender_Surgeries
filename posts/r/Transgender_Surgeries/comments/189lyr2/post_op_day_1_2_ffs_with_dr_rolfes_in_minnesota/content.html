Thank you!!! I remember when we were in the OR he saw my arm was kinda positioned weird and he came past all the nurses just to readjust it himself. It was such a small thing but you can really tell he carss about his patients :)

Fair play, it looks absolutely brutal but reassuring that he&#39;s an experienced hand and the results will come when healed up. All the best with your recovery.

First 2 photos are from say 1 and the 3rd photo is from say 2 post op.
</p>
<p>
I had facial feminization on December 1st with Dr. Rolfes at Maple Grove Hospital. Just want to start by saying I&#39;m beyond impressed with his work thus far. My hairline looks soooooo incredible I couldn&#39;t believe how well he rounded it. I used to have a scar that sat an inch below my hairline and it is gone now to my knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Ever since I woke up I have been in zero pain and had absolutely no nausea - which really shocked Mei was able to eat an entire meal - mostly soft foods except the turkey -and I am very slowly starting to chew more and more.
</p>
<p>
On day 2 the swelling started to settle in, especially in my right eye. I havnt been able to see out of it but I&#39;ve been able to see out the left. Dr. Rolfes came in the morning around 10 and took my cast off, put the jaw bra on me which is that black strap I am in, and then showed me how to massage my jaw to remove the fluid that is resting in there.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a bit tired bur I&#39;ll be posting more down the road :)

ðŸ”¥, love the brows and lip lift already.  I had FFS exactly a year ago and although the first 5 days sucked, I would do it over and over and over and over again.  You are so blessed and will look even more amazing a year from now.  Quick side noteâ€¦. Be on the lookout for post op depression a month or so out.  I didnâ€™t expect it and it hit me like a trainâ€¦be patient, stay healthy, and let time be on your side.  Every concern I had was met with my patient coordinator saying, give it time.  And she was right.

I&#39;ve been feeling amazing :) will probably be posting an update soon
</p>
<p>
I had no pain at all, and healing has been moving very quickly! I&#39;ve been able to go out to restaurants at not even two weeks. I should say that this doesn&#39;t appear to be the norm though, Dr. Rolfes and his nurse were very shocked I had no pain. Some is most likely to be expected!
</p>
<p>
Totally understand the nerves but remember he is sooooo experienced and does tons of these. I was his 4th ffs of that week ðŸ˜… and you won&#39;t remember anything. You&#39;ll wake up hours later like no time passed at all.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to message me by the way!! I&#39;d love to help another Rolfes girl out :)
