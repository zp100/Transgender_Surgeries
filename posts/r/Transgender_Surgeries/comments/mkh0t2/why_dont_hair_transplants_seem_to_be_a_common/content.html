Why don&#39;t hair transplants seem to be a common approach for FFS?

Hello :-) I seem to rarely come across examples of (mtf) girls having had hair transplants to fill in a male-looking hairline. How come?! It would seem like an easy and quite effective solution (certainly less &#39;big&#39; than hairline lowering surgeries) but I might be missing something!
</p>
<p>
Has anyone (mtf) had it done while still living as M then it&#39;s caused issues in the future? (asking for a friend ... ;) )

Hair line lowering is mostly done together with forehead reconstruction. That&#39;s the reason why it&#39;s so common.
</p>
<p>
Getting transplants done at the same time is risky because the blood supply is cut during surgery and grafts are less likely to survive. It&#39;s better to wait until everything is healed and than get a hair transplant

Facialteam utilises a coronal incision in their approach to forehead reconstruction, which can have the undesirable effect of raising the hairline. Without a simultaneous hair transplant I feel many of their patients would be unsatisfied with the added height in that area.

i had hair transplants done during FFS by keojampa! they weren’t perfect, but i had the worst hair type for transplants - dark, curly, diffused hair. the success rate on them is usually bad but i got a good hairline out of it. it’s not as full as i’d like, but i think it wouldn’t have been much better had i gotten it done after ffs.

I’m by no means an expert on this, but I’ve heard a few different reasons when consulting w surgeons.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Logistically, it’s difficult. Apparently good hair transplants are all about having a solid team of technicians dedicated to doing transplants that knows how to work together to efficiently harvest, prep, and transfer the follicles. Maintaining a team like this on staff is tricky for many surgeons.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I’ve heard the percentage follicle success rate is considerably lower when performed during simultaneous facial surgery—especially if performed alongside ffs brow work that would require either a coronal or hairline incision, or basically anything that would involve messing with the scalp. The percentage of successful follicles goes up the longer you wait after surgery to do transplants. I’ve been told it’s best to wait a year post op but 6 months is likely long enough to have noticeably better results.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Even with the highest follicle success rate, the outcome of transplants isn’t on par with the density achieved through a typical hairline advancement. This is very much a case by case basis sort of thing, but for many trans women you’ll have a much better outcome getting a scalp advancement to lower and/or round out your hairline, and then getting tactical transplants later to hide any visible scarring and further round out the shape of your hairline to your tastes.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Edit: I should have mentioned that it’s pretty common advice to wait until after you have other ffs procedures to do hair transplants, as, depending what you need done, you might unintentionally lose some of the gains from the transplants during your ffs, so a lot of trans women default to transplants being a procedure you have done after (or in some rare cases during) surgery. If you only need a slightly more rounded hairline to achieve your goals, and you don’t think you’ll ever need/want/afford brow work, then I think transplants are actually a great option for feminizing a face. It’s all case by case basis though, and I reckon less trans women fall into that category, which is why we don’t see much focus on transplants as a stand-alone option for upper face feminization.

I think the previous answers to this are pretty on point. Also it is I think somewhat common to have hair transplants post hairline advancement to &#34;finish off&#34; the hairline. In general you only want to advance the hairline from the center. You cannot move forward temporal recession more than the center as that creates uneven strain on the incision.
</p>
<p>
Using myself as an example you can see my initial hairline lowering was very effective in general but left some deep temporal recessions

</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve subsequently just had hair grafting to fill those
