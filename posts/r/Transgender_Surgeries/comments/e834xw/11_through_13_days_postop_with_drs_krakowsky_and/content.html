</p>
<p>
As with days 6-9, the last few days have been pretty full, and I&#39;ve been trying to find time to put my experiences in writing. Unfortunately, some of the details are foggy since my brain still isn&#39;t at 100%, but I think I&#39;m getting better.
</p>
<h1>
Day 11
</h1>
<p>
I had a rough day, some very large emotions stacked up all at once and I broke down in tears. Even though I&#39;ve had a fairly smooth recovery physically, there are some strong emotions involved, and they can definitely stack together and fuck with me, as today proved.
</p>
<p>
One of the ongoing challenges I&#39;ve had since our daughter was born is feeling like I&#39;m not doing enough as a parent, that I&#39;m placing too much load on my wife, and that I&#39;m failing as a mother. I&#39;m always thrilled to see our daughter and today was no exception. We went to see a photo exhibit at Ryerson about African women in photography from the 19th century to today, which was quite interesting, my wife carried our daughter the whole time since I&#39;m limited to less than 15 lbs for two months. By the time we were through, my body was feeling just about done, and our daughter was very ready for a nap in the car. After we headed back to ARC, I had a short nap and then dilated, and then my wife sent me a very cute photo of our daughter climbing on a shelf with a sun visor in her hand.
</p>
<p>
Dilating feels draining physically since I&#39;m lying around pressing the dilator against the end of my vagina for 15 minutes, which isn&#39;t exactly the most comfortable thing to do. Emotionally it&#39;s a bit of a challenge as it reminds me that my body isn&#39;t cis, and even though it&#39;s a lot closer to right, there are still some pretty solid differences. Cleaning up afterwards and applying polysporin to the incision lines makes me confront how changed it is, and that right now at least it doesn&#39;t look great.
</p>
<p>
I also question how it will turn out once it&#39;s healed, there&#39;s significant swelling, especially in my left majora, the clitoral complex feels very prominent and not well protected by the majora, and I don&#39;t really have any visibly defined minora below the urethra. I also pee about 45 degrees forwards and 45 degrees towards the side, and it feels like the posterior end of my vulva is slightly too anterior. I
<strong>
know
</strong>
that things will change as I heal, but it feels like it&#39;s a crude approximation of a vulva right now.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also got a few lasting complications from facial surgery that remind me that my body is pieced together.
</p>
<p>
Put it all together and cue an emotional break down. I can deal with each piece individually, but when stacked together at once, I was in tears for a while.
</p>
<p>
I ended up going out for dinner and having a nice bacon cheeseburger with fries from a nearby diner, along with a slice of cheesecake to take back for a late night snack. Comfort eating, but it helped.
</p>
<h1>
Day 12
</h1>
<p>
I definitely felt better today, I had a BM for the first time in 3 days, which took a physical load off, and I didn&#39;t have anywhere nearly as hard a day. We also went out for brunch, we walked over to the House on Parliament, with me pushing the stroller. And, I got to spend a lot more time interacting with our daughter, feeding her and keeping her entertained, than I did yesterday. The rest of the day was basically eat/nap/dilate, but I at least felt somewhat more involved as a parent than the day before, and that helped a LOT. So did snuggles before leaving, there&#39;s something so emotionally satisfying about hugging her.
</p>
<h1>
Day 13
</h1>
<p>
For the first time since surgery, I actually felt well rested in the morning. I didn&#39;t get to sleep until around 12:30 last night, and I still woke up multiple times. But, I slept on and off until after 9. We did our own things today, so I decided to make a trip over to Parliament St to check out an Epicurie (they had homemade cookies and Nanaimo bars, so a total win there), and then headed back over to the Gardens to enjoy a snack and the greenery. I still felt drained afterwards, but it feels like I&#39;m moving in a positive direction. I did it on my own, I wasn&#39;t in pain until I was already walking back, and (after another nap), I&#39;m feeling rested as opposed to kind of drained still. Hoping I sleep well again tonight.
</p>
<p>
Getting to depth while dilating is still a challenge for me, it feels like I hit a wall, then after 5-10 minutes, something that I have no conscious control over seems to relax and I get the last bit of the way to full depth. I also experimented a bit with using my thighs to hold the dilator inside me, and unfortunately, I can&#39;t maintain pressure doing so, oh well.
</p>
<p>
As always, feel free to ask me anything.

Thank you for all of this information. With my orchiectomy scheduled next month, Iâ€™m really starting to contemplate my options.
</p>
<p>
This is all incredibly helpful, cheers.

You&#39;re welcome. I hope your orchiectomy goes well. If you&#39;re contemplating vaginoplasty in the future, it would be a good idea to keep your scrotum around to avoid needing a skin graft later.
</p>
<p>
I hear WCH&#39;s waiting list is pretty long right now because they&#39;re only doing one surgery a month at the moment, so that&#39;s worth keeping in mind too.

Iâ€™m sure the orchi will be fine, itâ€™s such a minor operation. Iâ€™ve lived with  testicular pain for most of my life (large benign cysts all over). Pain can be managed hehe.
</p>
<p>
The physiological side though. My previous therapist scared me out even considering vaginoplasty. Only ever bringing up complications. But with my current therapist, worlds difference. (Personal biases or prejudices?) Now Iâ€™m leaving that door open.
</p>
<p>
So these first hand experiences and photos are incredibly valuable. Thank you for putting this all out there.
</p>
<p>
The waitlist in Oregon is pretty long as well. Scheduling into 2021 last I checked. The plus side, even waiting in line gives me the opportunity to educate myself and engage.

The potential complications are scary, and aftercare is no joke. But at the same time, the most serious complications are pretty rare, and (for me at least) the aftercare is totally worth it in order to finally have the right genitals.
</p>
<p>
Finding a therapist that&#39;s a good fit for you is huge. I kept seeing mine when she moved to a different city since I felt so comfortable with her and didn&#39;t want to try to find a new therapist at the time.

Your account has been extremely helpful. Iâ€™m enjoying following along, especially as I sit one week away from my first electrolysis session to begin prep for bottom surgery. The surgeon I hope to partner with for this uses the same technique and knowing some of the minutiae of your day and recovery is helping me know what to expect. Much love ðŸ’–ðŸ’™ðŸ’–

I&#39;m glad it&#39;s been helpful. Genital electrolysis was difficult to deal with due to the pain levels in that area. I managed with topical numbing, but some areas were still quite sensitive, and we had to be careful working them. Have you talked about numbing with your electrologist yet? If not, it might be a good idea.

Iâ€™ve seen a variety of suggestions for dealing with the pain, topical lidocaine applied before and then cleaned before starting being the most common. How many hours did you do?

Topical lidocaine, applied 1 he before session, covered with press &amp; cling to keep it from drying out, uncovered and wiped down progressively throughout the session. Part way through, my pain tolerance changed and I had to switch to EMLA (lidocaine / prilocaine mix) to be able to tolerate certain areas.
</p>
<p>
I lost count of the total hours we spent, I was fairly hairy down there, and we spent quite a bit of time on it over the course of about 18 months.

Typically 1x per week, 2x per week when trying to clear, 1x when maintaining. My electrologist got a microscope earlier this year, and that prompted another round of going back to clear (the little tiny hairs).
