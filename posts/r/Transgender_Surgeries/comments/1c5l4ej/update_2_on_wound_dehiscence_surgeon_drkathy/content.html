Unfortunately, all the patients who sued Dr. Rumer for medical malpractice just had their cases settled and then pushed off to the side, so it‚Äôs unlikely that OP would get any money from a lawsuit, they‚Äôd probably lose more money than gain

Med mal cases are almost always taken on a contingency basis, meaning you don‚Äôt pay unless you win money. Settled cases usually result in a pretty substantial payout. If you have to pay a lawyer to take your case, it‚Äôs probably not worth pursuing

Well done on reaching to OBGYN and much better now. Good to see you are now in the hands of trustworthy OBGYN. Having a good doctor always helps. Hope surgical site  heals soon. Stay safe. Will be a challenging situation but stay strong and rest well.

This is an excellent post.  Thank you for sharing.  The dehiscence is a known complication in any surgery.  It does happen unfortunately.  When it happens, you did the right thing and contacted your surgeon and or their office.
<br>
Their response was inadequate and you recognized that!    Too often patients don‚Äôt go and get a second opinion and trust too much in their original provider when in their hearts they know something is not quite right.  You have to be your own advocate!
</p>
<p>
You sought appropriate medical intervention and really wound care is what you needed.  When dehiscence occurs, it is important to figure out if you have an infection (common cause) or is it a technical error such as not enough purchase or too much tension on the suture line.  Sometimes, it remains unknown but the important thing is to get wound care so you minimize scarring and granulation tissue.
</p>
<p>
I wish you best of luck on the rest of your care and hope your recovery goes well!!

You&#39;re right that dehiscence is a known potential complication, but this is far beyond anything that can be reasonably anticipated.
</p>
<p>
And the fact that you were told it was fine us just unimaginable.
</p>
<p>
Bless you for being charitable, but (IMO) in this case you need to hold her fully accountable.

Well girl I&#39;m glad to see you got some professional help. Things look a lot better and at least try to heal.
</p>
<p>
We can&#39;t thank you enough for sharing such a hard personal thing like you&#39;ve encountered,  you&#39;ve probably saved a lot of other girls from going through what you have with that horrible Dr whom I don&#39;t even want to mention again.
</p>
<p>
Somehow we have to get the word out there more about this Dr. and get her shut down from being able to harm another person.   We are desperate and she preys on this and it has to stop.
</p>
<p>
I no it&#39;s hard to turn down what seems be be the last resort or none. I was looking at this same situation with this same Dr. But I was warned and I put it off and thankfully the Cleaveland clinic accepted me.  Yeah it&#39;s been a long road but my surgery is one more week,  next Tuesday is my day . So I hate to think what I would have done had I not been accepted by the Cleaveland clinic.
<br>
I will continue to keep you in my prayers üôè.

Yo... OP, nothing I can say can make it better but, for what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m proud of you for staying strong with this. To say this is horrible is an understatement and I REALLY hope things work out for you. Once it heals, you&#39;ll probably have nasty scars, but it may not be the end of the world if your nerves keep in tact. It very well could still be plenty usable.
</p>
<p>
When all is said and done you may not have an optimal vagina, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re doomed. At least I hope not.
</p>
<p>
Good luck to you. You deserve so much better than that crone Rumer gave you.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Additionally: to anyone who doesn&#39;t know much about Rumer, just know she&#39;s an evil human being. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s karma in this world, but I hope she gets what&#39;s coming to her.

When you say this is a ‚Äúknown complication in penile inversion vaginoplasties‚Äù, how common? Or is it just one of the more common possible complications, but those are still a low risk?

Wound dehiscence is a common complication of all genital surgeries, though not typically to the extent of OPs.   It‚Äôs prone to wound separation because the area is often moist, takes a long time to heal and is stretched easily by simple body movements (walking, getting in and out of bed, sitting down, standing up).
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm a gender affirming surgery caregiver and I tell all my lower surgery clients to prepare for some amount of wound separation because I see it in nearly everyone I care for. With diligent wound care, it almost always heals on its own though.

I don&#39;t believe it happens to this scale that often. A lot of my problems are from untreated necrosis. That being said I would definitely ask someone with more knowledge on this surgery than me.

Dehiscense is super common and normally heals on its own. Super bad dehiscense and necrosis isn&#39;t and is surely a result of Rumer&#39;s mutilation technique.

All the stitches failing like this is not common at all, because most surgeons are competent enough and care enough to use enough strength to hold it together - its a tense situation post op and the stitches are under a lot of pressure, but total failure of all stitchwork like this is extremely not what you should expect.

If we want to advance the success rate of these surgeries, it‚Äôs imperative we are vocal on who the evil butchers are out there that are operating on patients for a surgery that is waayyy out of their skill level and expertise. There are greedy doctors using our bodies as guinea pigs for lucrative cash grabs‚Ä¶ if this was charged through insurance I‚Äôm sure they billed them six figures plus.. if you paid for the surgery yourself, I hope you get every penny back! Or more!! I would sue.. Best of luck.

I would like to ask you something and I promise I don&#39;t want this to sound condescending or anything negative but I am curious why did you choose her? Was it word of mouth, insurance, or people&#39;s results? What was your factors for choosing a doctor?

People nicknamed her the butcher, and I even called her, after I read a few posts and learned she had a nick name the butcher, I never spoke to her again. Sorry üò¢ I hope you heal soon.

It&#39;s a trans specific medical practice in western mass and they&#39;re run by good people and mass general hospital. I have no idea why they&#39;d be recommending Rumer to anyone.
</p>
<p>
edit: She probably meant trans-health.org, which redirects to the mazzoni center.

Oh earlier she had called it transhealthcare.org, which does provide advertising services and the page on Dr. Rumer was an extremely glowing portrayal of her, no doubt written by her or one of her minions. I&#39;m not sure which one she actually meant.

Glad for you! Wish I could get my wife in with a local trans affirming PCP but she drags her feet really bad on making appts. She sees one of Dr. Powers&#39;s PAs virtually from out of state but in person would be better imo....

Been thinking about you for days girl. So thankful you are continuing to get great care with dr grimstad and that your wounds are starting to close up. I can tell it‚Äôs healing!

You are so fucking powerful! Being able to advocate for yourself and get the good care you deserve in such an intense situation is bad ass.   Thank you for continuing to be open with this group and letting us in on a little part of your journey.

I‚Äôm so glad that your new doctor has been helping you remedy the adverse effects you suffered from your original surgeon. I‚Äôm curious to know what has been the care provided to you by your new doctor that is helping to fix the wound? I noticed you said she and her team helped you and the wound is healing nicely now. Was the care you received by your new doctor only an exam, or did they do an exam and offer better prescriptions, or did they cauterize the necrotic tissue?

As a community, we absolutely must come together to put a definitive end to these atrocities. I am fucking sick and tired of seeing people butchered by this ghastly monster of a ‚Äúsurgeon‚Äù. This is a total moral outrage, some form of action must be taken to stop her.

I do hope that Dr. Grimstad plans on closing up those wounds sometime this year, because I‚Äôm just worried that it‚Äôll get infected and it‚Äôll be painful and raw :( glad that you‚Äôre getting the right treatment though!

My god... I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re going through that.
</p>
<p>
But ya, that&#39;s clearly a result of neglected necrosis.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully there&#39;s still tissue left, and it didn&#39;t kill you or spread elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
I remember when you posted initially. Not going to the hospital was a personal choice.
</p>
<p>
Albeit, it wouldn&#39;t matter if the doctors there weren&#39;t experts in GRS.. they still know how to treat infection and necrosis. A wound is a wound.. but I digress. The past is the past and you are where you are today.
</p>
<p>
How is your mental health?
</p>
<p>
Personally, I would&#39;ve unalived myself at the point you&#39;re at.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re incredibly strong.

<p>
I hope the best for you.

Yeah looking back there was definitely necrosis. We even sent pictures to Rumer&#39;s office and the nurse said it looked fine.
</p>
<p>
My mental health is all over the place. Thankfully the social workers on Dr. Grimstad&#39;s team have been working with me. I am also grateful to have such amazing people surrounding me who are really supportive.
</p>
<p>
Kathy Rumer even yelled at my mother when my mental health was at a low point saying she wasn&#39;t responsible for my recovery that was my GPs job.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to pursue revision surgeries. I think I&#39;m just going to see how it heals. This whole ordeal has already taken so much out of me.

You should sue Dr Rumer for telling you that the slowly necrotizing tissue was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  This Dr Botched you and I am so sorry this happened to you.  Hoping for you to completely recover from this üôèüèª

It is very rare, unless the patient has underlying medical issues like uncontrolled diabetes or the likes.  This was clearly negligence of the surgeon.

I have to laugh at the note of #2 where everyone tried to be your doctor knowing well trans care in a hospital setting is not where it needs to be and trans care for post-op trans surgerys need to be addressed by knowledgeable doctors who preform those surgerys.

I am so sorry.  I hope there is a medical possibility of revision.  I cannot imagine how absolutely traumatic this experience has been for you.  You are a strong woman, and we are all cheering for you.

The downvotes are for the unhinged format which is giving the impression you&#39;re the unhinged person screaming on the street corner  in an incomprehensible rant.

Okay, so it seems you haven&#39;t picked up that all caps and exclamation points are the digital equivalent of shouting. Imagine someone shouting your post when you use them and the more you use the louder and wilder they are shouting.
</p>
<p>
Then consider online chats and forums like being in a living room people come and go from freely. Would you want the person who is shouting at the top of their lungs to stay around, even if everything they said was a good point? I really doubt you would. When you use lots of all caps and exclamation points you are the shouting person.
</p>
<p>
If you want to emphasize a word or two, sometimes,
<em>
italics
</em>
or
<strong>
bold
</strong>
are you friends. They indicate an emphasis to the word without making that word into a shout.

7 is not healing that was taken before we started proper wound care. 8 is 3 days after that. It may not seem so from the pictures but in person it looks much better than before.
