You had one of the most sensitive parts of your body go through major surgery. Give your nerves time to figure out what’s going on! I know it sucks but 3 months is almost nothing in the grand scheme of things.
</p>
<p>
For right now, since I realize it sucks to hear “just wait” accept it doesn’t feel pleasurable. Don’t try and be rough on yourself over it or bargain with your body, just accept it doesn’t have sensation right now and move on. If you can’t change it then don’t exhaust yourself believing you can. It’s not fair to you and won’t get you anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Does it suck? Yep.
</p>
<p>
Is there anything else you can do about it right now? Nope.

I am about a little over 8 months post-op. I did not have sensation until about a month ago. Even now the sensation is little so it takes a while to orgasm (and the orgasms feel different to me). It took a lot of experimenting too. I guess I am saying you&#39;re not alone, but I am also saying to try different things when you&#39;re ready. For me a lot of it was in my head and getting over how different things feel (or dont feel).

Surgeon and technique? You might need to consider a revision down the road if this persists.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that some people dont get adequate sensation back till the year mark. You still have time.

Youll be fine. The surgeon you went to is a good one. You might want an aesthetics revision idk. But i have faith that in 7-8 months you&#39;ll have sensation.

I’ve seen lots of posts where it comes back more than 3 month’s later. Sometimes it’s more than a year. It’s far to early to worry about it,

I didn&#39;t have sensation until over a year, I didn&#39;t have my first orgasm until just under two years. Now I can orgasm on my own regularly. It took a lot of figuring out, I don&#39;t really touch my clit when I masturbate, instead I rub the skin around it. Seems to do the job for me, actually touching my clit doesn&#39;t feel like much.

<p>
I went to Dr Suporn for the record

My labia major still don&#39;t have full feeling, which is interesting, but it&#39;s been over a year now. I&#39;m told that it will come back, and that I should wait, but I understand the problem of just being told to wait. It should be back, don&#39;t put to much pressure on yourself!

It sometimes takes girls around 8 months. Try getting on a pillow and do your thing pillows help more easier but remember your nerves down there need time to heal and awaken again

I understand your concerns that have to wait. The first month after the surgery I was worried about many things because I was still swollen. Dr.kanit in Thailand has advised me to wait as well. But my feelings are very good Just touch and feel the Orgasm.
