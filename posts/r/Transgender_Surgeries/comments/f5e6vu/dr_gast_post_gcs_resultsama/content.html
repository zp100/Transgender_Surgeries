Hi.  I had GCS with Dr Katherine Gast about a month ago at UW Madison. Here are some of my thoughts from and since that experience.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to try to keep this organized, but I&#39;ll probably mix a lot of categories up as I go...
</p>
<p>
Dr Gast does the standard penile-inversion GCS, and IMHO she does a fantastic job at it.
</p>
<p>
It looks great so far (still swollen, but much nicer than it had been).  I had a chance to have a look when the packing came out, before the swelling really got rolling, and it was beautiful.  I was so happy... I just cried for a few.
</p>
<p>
The chief resident who removed the packing and catheter (fwa! that was an experience) was just amazing. So very human -- I think that anyone who ends up in her care when she begins her own practice will be in such good hands. It gives me a lot of hope to see such people coming into the system.
</p>
<p>
The hospital experience itself was overall pretty good. A little nerve-wracking as news of coronavirus started trickling in.
</p>
<p>
The nurses and NAs were just amazing. So kind and knowledgeable, and very much taking the role of patient advocate. ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ
</p>
<p>
UW hospital is (natch) a teaching hospital, which means that every morning half a dozen residents come trouping in and one or more actually run the exam.
</p>
<p>
Because of this, it&#39;s important to remember:
<em>
you have the right to exclude some or all of the residents
</em>
for this.  Because of my own personal history, I asked all the men to leave, and overall they made little fuss about it.  Though it does get tiring to have to ask every day...
</p>
<p>
Follow-up care and instructions were adequate, and questions are answered quickly via their online portal.
</p>
<p>
I stayed about a week in hospital, and another 5 days in the hotel nearby.
</p>
<p>
Insurance made the whole thing affordable, but the price quoted to the insurance company was .... large.  I&#39;m assuming that self-pay would be less?
</p>
<p>
RN I have little pain, and haven&#39;t needed anything stronger than ibuprofen or Tylenol since the day after surgery
</p>
<p>
Last thoughts, keep in mind that you&#39;ll be treated by a large team, which means that you may see each person only once (I saw Dr Gast 3 or 4 times) so keep track of your questions and be persistent in filling in any gaps
</p>
<p>
Overall I&#39;m super happy with how it all went
</p>

Edit: description.  Labia majora meet below the vestibule, and minora look great.  Vestibule is maybe a little lower than average cis, but not super obviously so. somehow she did some magic to have the opening self closing even after dilation. Clit is already sensate, and nicely hidden as any cis vulva.

LOL trolls are downvoting enough that this comes up at the top, if you sort by controversial

How long was the wait list?
</li>
