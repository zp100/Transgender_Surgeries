I could make more photos, but dont know how to upload them.  I looks a bit less natural when I spread my inner labia
</p>
<p>
My insurance paid most of it. I had to pay an extra of 3000€ plus hospital plus some other stuff. I think with no insurance it is sth around 19000, but I&#39;m not sure anymore

you could upload to imgur (there are privacy options there). I know there are other sites that can offer better privacy but I can&#39;t remember them now

What GRS technique did they use? And how&#39;s the sensitivity and lubrication?

I The technique is called combined method. Its pi with a free scrotum skin graft and lined with urethra skin for lubrication and elasticity. There&#39;s lots of info about their technique online. Sensitivity is great for me, although I had a numb area on my right thigh for half a year or so

I had complications after the first surgery. I almost bled to death after coming home from hospital. I couldn&#39;t dilate for a while and lost some depth. Sometimes I worry about it a lot, but never had problems with it. Should still be deep enough, that&#39;s at least what my gyn says

Can I ask how long dilation took for you? How many times per day in different recovery stages, how long per session to reach depth, how long in total, how painful? Thank you for sharing!

Most if the time i die around 45 minutes. They recommend 30 or something, but I watched series while dilating (also made it easier only to watch them during dilating). In the beginning it was 3 times a day and also was quite painful for me,  at least the first few weeks. I took painkillers or pot for dilating. Later I learned how to better relax the muscles, then it got waaayyy easier. Reaching full depth was quite complicated for me. Never got the dilator as far in as Dr morath, then it stressed me and I always tried to push it more in. Took a while before I was alright with the depth I have. But now when I dilate or have penetrative sex I always need a little vbit, like 3 minutes or something to relax and reach full depth. Its not painful any more at all. Also in learned that masturbation and dilation is a good combination for me, cause I&#39;m way more wet and relaxed

Ah, also going up in dilator size was painful in the beginning, but I did it quite quickly, like in the first month or something. Using vibrators (after things are a little bit more healed) also helped a lot with dilating. Sort of rumbles the tension away

Thank you so so much! If I may ask further, to clarify: So like 15min each with 3 different sizes? And in that you include the time it takes to reach depth? What sort of painkillers worked - regular OTC ones or prescription? Muscle relaxation both sounds magical and super useful, is this something that can be trained or does one simply discover it? How often do you need to dilate now?
</p>
<p>
Again, thank you so much! I keep saying I&#39;ll use the opportunity to catch up on all the old Star Trek series...

Yap, it was 15 min per dilator (3 of them), but that also includes the preparation for the next dilator (putting a condom,&amp; lube on it) I reach full depth in the 15 minutes. So I insert the dilator then it takes a minute to reach the back, then after a while i relax and push further to stretch it a bit more. For me novalgin and weed helped. U need a prescription for novalgin, but u could also try ibu or some other OTC. Also everyone&#39;s different with painkillers, I would recommend u try different things and see what works out for u. Muscle relaxation needed to be discovered after surgery for me. There&#39;s all the pelvic floor muscles where ur vagina goes through and in the beginning its quite hard to control them. I guess u could kegels to find out more about them Now after one and a half years I barely dilate, maybe ones a month if even. Also I don&#39;t use the dilators I got from the clinic any more, but just a collection of toys. I found the white foam thingies they gave me super unsexy and other dildos just work the same. I also have friends who have to dilate a lot more than I do, so guess you just have to find out, I can only talk from my experience.
</p>
<p>
Star trek is a good choice for recovery, there&#39;s endless episodes. I watched a lot of series when I was in hospital, but forgot almost everything, cause they pump u full with painkillers and stuff, also I guess I repressed lots of the memorys

I also Bad a consultation with Dr heß. He was really sympathetic and took time to answer all of my questions. I also think he&#39;s doing really good work. He&#39;s offering his work over a big hospital and has no private clinic. Schaff&amp;morath are putting lots of money into their work and everything looks really fancy, while heß just seamed to work out of passion or interest. I think he is a really capable doctor.  I chose Dr morath over him, cause I knew people, that had surgery with her and so I knew a bit about their experience. Also I thought that with morath being a plastic surgfeon, my pussy would look nicer. I can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s better than heß, cause I haven&#39;t met anyone IRL that had surgery with him. Dr heß also does the combined method, but as far as I remember, he also had some critique on it. So had other doctors I spoke to about it

Thanks, this really helps a lot, I think I&#39;m going with Schaff/Morath then because just like you, I haven&#39;t seen any results from Heß. I even asked him to show me results and he said he doesn&#39;t have any o.O

He showed me one result in the consultation, but only after I asked several times. As far as I remember he makes the labia minora in the second stage, although I don&#39;t remember what he builds them out of.  You can see some of his older results on
<a href="http://www.transsexuelle-und-angehoerige.de" rel="nofollow">www.transsexuelle-und-angehoerige.de

But be aware the the community they are quite harsh, also the pics are quite old
