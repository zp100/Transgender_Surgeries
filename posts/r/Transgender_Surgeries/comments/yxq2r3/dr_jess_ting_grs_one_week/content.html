This is one week post op, keep in mind I&#39;m quite antsy so I&#39;ve been moving around more than I should. Plus the other day I accidentally sat on a stool with nothing and immediately one side got much more swollen.

I work adjacent to the industry, Dr Ting is one of my favorite surgeons for GCS. I really like how the scars are hidden in the thigh creases.

Can I be honest I always had the imagine in my head of what I wanted, i looked up vagina sitting outside in the car day of surgery. I didn&#39;t even show him the picture, I was distracted ( I had a picture of my dog I wanted to take in and they kept talking about it). But I saw the diagram which matched what was in my head. I still count myself lucky, but I highly believe you create your reality. Please believe in yourself, believe you are worthy and deserving. That took me a long time to accept I was worthy of all of this.

I am still working If I need it. I want it. but its something if I can live without I will. Knowing that it is an absolute need is just as important as getting it. Then again I was like this with my boobs and face too. And I love my boobs. They are absolutely perfect and comfortable.  Though for the next time I am going the next profile up I think.

If I&#39;m honest I thought I was so ready in every department ( I knew me and I need to be active so I prepared for the bed bound portion). The month leading up to I was so nervous in alot of ways but if it feels right, it&#39;s right. I did the whole process almost in reverse, I saw ting the first visit and everyone throughout was like how did this happen( I still don&#39;t know the proper procedure). So leading up it was a year since I talked about anything. I looked at the results I could find, which threw me in both directions. All to say I don&#39;t even remember the whole time asking him how it would look this and that, I wanted function he said yes it will work. With that I had the picture in my head always what I wanted and dead ass looked up a diagram on Google ( in the car on the way in) but that&#39;s what I saw that matched my brain. I kept saying I&#39;m blessed the whole time anyone brought anything up how it all went. Know you will get everything you want, your deserving your Worthy, and you are ready to receive. Visualize, pray, and if your heart has no objections you should not either. I love you and I pray for the best but know you are blessed alreadyüíú

If anyone has any information I would be more than grateful to hear, I am taking as many vitamins relevant to my healing (zinc for skin/ testosterone, E for skin as well, sunlight to coincide with e/ exercise at least what I can, I am trying to eat raw onions as well for t) I want to help myself as much as I can. If I&#39;m honest it&#39;s the function which worries me, I have faith everything will fall into place but if there&#39;s anything I can do to help I want to do. I&#39;m going for a blood test tomorrow to check my levels.

So it was definitely weird and the whole process they questioned me, but I cashed sometime June, July 2021. I got a call maybe September from whoever saying someone canceled would you like to come in October, obviously I jumped on it. I had to wait a couple of months to qualify for hormones, I was approved in April 2022. My insurance ( empire bc/Bs) denied, so I ended up applying and getting approved for health first, and from there it was laser in preparation for my date in November.
