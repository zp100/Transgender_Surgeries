Omg so today my pain finally felt managed!
</p>
<p>
Still hurt like hell, but I was able to sleep on my side, and I made dinner, a yummy Mac and cheese :))
</p>
<p>
Pro tip: wear pads!!! I was spending so much time literally just wiping blood off me. Air dry, then wear a pad and it catches everything!! I was so tired of having to peel my buttcheeks open every morning because of all the blood!
</p>
<p>
Anyways it&#39;s a happy day :))

Really glad things are starting to turn around for you. I just did my last sitz bath last night. The first couple weeks become a blur. It really does get better though. Being able to roll over and sleep on my side was a big relief too.

Um, yeah? It bleeds a ton like every day. Lol this is after cleaning it very intensely. Docs say it&#39;s normal to bleed like this. Did you not bleed this much?

Oh, I understand and I have seen others who have that problem after surgery on here, and no, unfortunately, I am pre-op. I really hope that is not against violation or something on this subreddit, because I just look at the surgeries on here, to see each of you people’s experience with GRS and how you folks are doing afterwards, how you are recovering, etc. I plan to get it one day when I am older though, along with vocal feminization surgery (Glottioplasty)

I can&#39;t seem to figure it out.
</p>
<p>
How do you ice it? It just hurts when I do it, or it&#39;s too heavy, or it doesn&#39;t conform

I was at Montreal too. I iced the daylights out of myself, monitoring for too much cold.
</p>
<p>
Large bag of frozen peas. Get sandwich size baggies and mark them DO NOT EAT. Break large bag into smaller- one to two cups.
</p>
<p>
Place face cloth over vulva. Ice a small area ten minutes. If bag still frozen, relocate for another ten minutes. If thawed, use different bag. Three or four relocations might do for one session.
</p>
<p>
I also used large bags of peas undivided. If they had big lumps I broke them apart. My surgeon recommended ten minutes per hour but I sometimes doubled the facecloths and went longer.
</p>
<p>
I’m not qualified to give medical advice but it looks to me that cautiously icing as much as possible might help reduce inflammation.
