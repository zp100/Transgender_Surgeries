I took three days off of work. I could have used a fourth, but I survived just fine. Pain was minimal I don’t think I used the hard stuff beyond the first day.
</p>
<p>
After surgery, I was able to cut back on my estrogen and still saw a jump in feminization.
</p>
<p>
As for cost, my insurance paid for most of it. I think the co pay was a couple hundred dollars.

Wow! That&#39;s awesome. I know it&#39;s a cheap, simple, outpatient surgery but of course that never tells the whole story of how people are afterwards. Glad your pain was minimal &amp; you saw an improvement in feminization. Thanks for answering😊

I had a bilateral orchiectomy performed through Kaiser this past June, so I can&#39;t speak for long term results, however:
</p>
<p>
The bulk of the pain passed after a few days with lingering pinching sensations if I sat in certain positions and some transient inguinal pain for up to a month or so after. Very manageable. I developed an upper respiratory infection during recovery, but that&#39;s just how my body tends to cope from any relatively major trauma. I payed a little over $1k with insurance, but it&#39;s not a big deal because I also had FFS covered for a very small fraction of the out of pocket cost. Tucking is easier/not even a thing anymore, but keep in mind you&#39;ll probably have a bit of bulge still. I feel like I&#39;ve feminized a little. I gained a few pounds and feel a little curvier, but it&#39;s hard to pinpoint if that was my orchi, starting progesterone, stopping Spiro, etc. Having them gone feels very natural and having testicles already feels like a distant, foreign memory. One of the best decisions I&#39;ve made as someone who is ambivalent about my genitals and unsure if I want full GCS.

Thanks for the reply. Glad you had minimal pain. Although I&#39;m sorry on the uppper respitory infection. That&#39;s scary! Wow! So did you combine an orchiectomy with FFS at the same time or did I misread that? Quiet a sudden big transition lol. Oh I acknowledge I won&#39;t be budge free 100%. Better? Yes but I&#39;ll still have hiding to do with underwear, layers, tucking etc. glad you got better feminization &amp; adapted to life without that part. I&#39;m excited &amp; ready to lose them. Well GRS/SRS is a very major life altering choice. Nothing to be taken lightly. For me I&#39;m good without it. I care more about HRT, my orchi &amp; cosmetic treatments. Of course there&#39;s no right or wrong way to transition. Endless options &amp; we are all valid no matter what medical, social, or legal steps we take.

Oh, I didn&#39;t have them together. I had my FFS last November. That was definitely the most difficult recovery of my surgeries so far. The point was even though my insurance isn&#39;t the best, I saved tens of thousands on FFS, not to mention facial electrolysis. Best of luck to you on your surgical recovery!

I see! Makes sense. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re now the girl you always were inside &amp; now it&#39;s reflected. I can imagine FFS is painful especially if it&#39;s multiple plastic surgeries on your face. Worth the time, money, &amp; pain though cause your face is what people see. Thanks so much! I think my one surgical journey for my gender transition might end with simply my orchiectomy? Only other big maybe is one FFS procedure-a minor nose job? Idk? But HRT my laser hair removal sessions &amp; lifetime cosmetic treatments like facials, chemical peels, microneedling, skincare, makeup, Botox, &amp; lip injections will complete me. Well I&#39;m going to becoming a medical esthetician so all that stuff I&#39;m into &amp; can get a huge discount on in the future since it&#39;ll be my job lol

I got it done in 2011... it was basically the best decision of my life.
</p>
<p>
I took a long weekend and drove to Michigan.  The pain was minimal.  Day of I took the prescribed drugs, but the second day I stopped taking them because I didn’t need them.  Third day when I got home I helped paint my living room.  That said the swelling and bruising IS a bitch. But like any other deep cut / bad bruise only hurts when it is disturbed.
</p>
<p>
I spent $2k.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it increased feminization dramatically.  There is a big difference between blocking T and just not having the stuff at all.
</p>
<p>
I can go swimming now without major concerns.

Thank you for replying! Wow! I&#39;m so glad it was the best decision ever for you. I know it&#39;s a cheap, simple, outpatient surgery with lots of benefits but the aftermath I was curious about. Glad your pain was minima &amp; you healed well. Michigan huh? I&#39;m in Ohio &amp; getting mine at Cleveland clinic. Swelling &amp; bruising doesn&#39;t sound fun but I knew it&#39;d happen. That&#39;s what pain pills &amp; ice is for lol. $2k for an orchiectomy is nothing when you look at the cost of full GRS/SRS- $20k minimum. Lots of money, time, work, pain, risks, recovery, &amp; lifetime upkeep. No thank you! Well I&#39;ve had feminization since I&#39;m young &amp; started with a good starting point. My t levels are super low but the problem is my E levels are low too. So not the fullest affects from mtf HRT sadly. An orchi I hoped would accelerate the feminization &amp; improve my E level which I hear will occur😊 Ha! Good to know I can wear a bikini in the future, maybe a skirt one

The pain was minimal, a few days on the couch watch Netflix and I was good to go. I haven&#39;t had my levels checked yet (going in next week for that), but I think I&#39;ve seen some body hair decrease and some slight extra boob growth, but I could be imagining those, and it&#39;s only been like a month and a half.

Thanks for replying. It&#39;s reassuring hearing everyone saying minimal pain. Well it sounds like you obtained extra feminization afterwards

I had my orchiectomy in April. And I agree that it was the best decision of my life. Pain was minimal, similar to the comments above. I definitely noticed more feminization afterwards, such as more fat on my thighs. Although I suspect removing spironolactone from my meds was part of that. I&#39;ve heard price ranges from $2000 - $5000. The lower range was because they used a a local not a general anesthesia. Everything still works down there, if I want it to LOL. Although I&#39;ll have to admit it&#39;s an adventure sometimes reaching orgasm. I only produce a few drops of clear liquid.

Thanks for responding! Awesome! Someone else said best decision in their life. I mean beyond dysphoria associated with that part, it&#39;s medically needed &amp; proven to improve your health plus prolong your life vs if you stay on HRT forever with no bottom surgery. Little pain &amp; improved feminization is good. Having zero t is way more powerful than trying to fight/block it. Once the source is cut off its obvious estrogen will work better. Omg everything still works down there? My only fear was that I could never orgasm again especially with my future girlfriend. Even if small liquid comes out &amp; I have sensation is all I will ask for. I know I&#39;ll have no t production or sperm ever again &amp; I don&#39;t care. But the orgasm part kinda was a bummer.

An orchi was the only way I could get my levels right, so, unsurprisingly, I have had additional feminization.
</p>
<p>
The whole process of recovery was fairly easy. The first two days were more painful for me than for most, though. Zero regrets. Still have consistent and easy erections, unfortunately. Oh well. At least tucking is ridiculously easy and painless, now, which is a big plus! Without tucking, though, it&#39;s much the same for me :p
</p>
<p>
It cost me a flat 3k.

I had minimal pain, mostly just mild discomfort.

<li>
If your T is well suppressed prior to surgery, surgery itself isn&#39;t going to improve your levels. My T was basically non-existent before surgery, so nothing really changed in that regard.
</li>
<li>
No. See above answer.
</li>
<li>
Medicaid covered mine.

<li>
No problems having orgasms. I&#39;m actually post-GRS at this point and can still very much have orgasms.

Orchi did making tucking quite a bit easier, yes.

Remember  that even  F2M girls with total bottom  surgery  can still reach  orgasm. Don&#39;t  expect  raging  hard on&#39;s.  I can orgasm manually  or orally but for me at at least, I can no longer penetrate. I prefer cis females  too , and you know what they say, 10 billion lesbians can&#39;t be all wrong LOL

Yeah I heard FTM trans men can orgasm too after full bottom surgery. I just expect a little something. Well I&#39;m only sexually attracted to both cis &amp; trans girls. I&#39;m a total transbian 100% lol. So I desire some sexual sensation &amp; little orgasm at least with my future girlfriend. &amp; yeah 10 billion lesbians can&#39;t all be wrong or lying lol
