Pictures for week 4 are
<a href="https://lensdump.com/a/9nlQz/?sort=title_asc&amp;page=1">here
</a>
</p>
<p>
So let&#39;s get into week 4 now.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 22
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I shall start to dilate again, slow but steady. They removed a little bit of scaly skin or something like this from the top of my vagina. (The problem I had last weekend)
</p>
<p>
I started dilating with the number 2 again and it was really uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
Also my pee get tested again in case of an infection, cause I still have a slight incontinence.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 23
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I shall start dilate with 3 now even if it&#39;s uncomfortable or painful. On the gynecological chair all looked good enough so I could be able to be released from hospital.
</p>
<p>
In the evening I started dilating with the number 3 and noticed I need something in front of it so I can use my hands for other stuff üòÖ
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 24
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have to get on the gynecological chair again tomorrow so they can say if I can be released.
</p>
<p>
In the morning I also was able to dilate with the 4 and in the evening even the 5. Even when the 5 was just in for like 6 cm for a few minutes.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 25
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If all is ok on the chair they can release me on Saturday ( day 26). And yes they said it looked all good enough for that :3
</p>
<p>
The incontinence I have might resolve itself by itself.  But I shall dilate deeper cause it is already closing in the back.
</p>
<p>
Now i tried a tactic so I can get the 3 close to completely in.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 26
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was up early so I can be released early, but sadly I had to wait till midday for all my documents. So now to the hotel to my boyfriend so we can travel back tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Dilating was only in the evening without the 5.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 27
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Get up early cause our train was leaving before it was 6 am. 10 hours ride and it was kinda okish. The last km was per car then it that was the real hell on that day üòÖ
</p>
<p>
And in the evening I just tried douching my vagina and yeah it was really strange and I need some other stuff for it.
</p>
<p>
This day without dilating cause I was way to tired after all this.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 28
</li>
</ul>
<p>
First night in my bed and a nightmare üòê otherwise nothing really new.
</p>
<p>
This is also the reason why this is the last weekly thread. Maybe I&#39;m doing another on in a few month or so as a follow up.

Great result!!! I think you won&#39;t need another surgery! I&#39;m just searching the clitoris, is it well-hidden or where? =)

If you look at the last picture and zoom in at the top of the labia minora you see that they are a little bit higher at a point. Beneath that it the clitoris, still with healing problems. Or just look again at the pics. I&#39;ve edited it so the last pic is from yesterday where I&#39;ve spread the labia minora.

Tbh dunno what the difference is between team markovsky and taskov (from my knowledge he hasn&#39;t a team of surgeons that also do it but he do it itself).
</p>
<p>
Sadly I havent noticed the self lubrication, BUT I was dry as shit already pre OP and pre HRT and on HRT, so take this also in conclusion.
