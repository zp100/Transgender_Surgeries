Those who have had an orchiectomy without general anesthesia, how much did it cost? And how did it go?

I was talking to someone on reddit who mentioned she had her orchiectomy done in the office without general anesthesia because it was cheaper. I&#39;m just wondering how common this is and if it&#39;s a reasonable option.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve already talked to my PCP who is well networked with the transcare department at my hospital so hopefully I&#39;ll be able to get a real estimate soon, but I&#39;m just trying to figure out is this is feasible for me before I make a few appointments with specialists.
</p>
<p>
Thanks

2015, $3000. Horizontal incision for some infuriating reason, and my spermatic cord is now attached to my scrotal tissue. I&#39;m glad I had it done, but I&#39;m angry about the technique.

So the incision was on the scrotum? I was planning on inguinal, so the incision was above my pubic area. Just seems safer SRS wise.

I had SRS with the suporn clinic two years later and everything was fine. I got a midline incision, if you do iguinal they have to put you under based on what my doc said. Midline is totally fine.
</p>
<p>
Edit: got confused and read the wrong reply. Info is still good, just not asking me üò¨üò¨üò¨

Maybe, but all the GCS surgeons say midline is fine, and you won&#39;t have tummy scars

I&#39;m totally fine with the scar on my belly, I&#39;m more concerned about healing time and getting back to work. Just seemed like it would be less of a bother. Also I want to make sure the spermatic cord etc. is cut very short. The idea of being able the feel it after the procedure grosses me out. Either way I should have an appointment with a urologist in the next couple of weeks so I&#39;ll see what she says.

If that&#39;s what you want and you&#39;re willing to pay the extra cost and get the required letters, I don&#39;t see why I wouldn&#39;t be possible. Might be harder to find someone to do it, but I think with enough digging you should find someone. Good luck at your appt! Hopefully she&#39;s willing to help!
</p>
<p>
Also it would be two scars, one for each testicle I think, not that that matters much I suppose

Extra cost/required letters?
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t know cost would be different, but that makes sense I guess. Why does it require more letters? I mean it doesn&#39;t matter my PCP is head of the transcare department at my local hospital and has already talked about letters like &#34;don&#39;t worry, I gotchu.&#34;

My orchie didn&#39;t require any letters, it was informed consent, so I just meant you would need letters for it instead of informed consent possibly, but if you were already going the letter route then no difference.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a more complicated surgery, so I&#39;m assuming it will cost more ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

2016, Dr. Arnkoff Farmington Hills, MI $3000. I took Xanax prescribed by my doctor for the procedure and felt fine. Afterwards, I hung out in a hotel room and ate a bunch of chicken nuggets. It was awesome.
</p>
<p>
Edit: obviously local anesthetic was used in addition to Xanax to help me relax

Yeah it‚Äôs looking like $3000 is the price point. Someone said they got it done for $1200 back in ‚Äò06. I was hoping it was going to be more like $2000 :/ oh well

Arnkoff in Michigan is up to $3500 I think myorchie.com
</p>
<p>
My results were fine with him, but lots of other people here have complained about lack of follow up and complications

I can confirm the lack of follow up and complications.  My spermatic cord is fused to my scrotal tissue, and an ugly horizontal scar.

Why did he do horizontal vs a midline vertical incision? Did he tell you? That&#39;s awful, I&#39;m sorry.

I have no clue! All of the results I have ever seen were vertical, but without telling me (and I should have asked, but I didn&#39;t think a horizontal cut was a thing) he just did a horizontal incision.

I had mine done outpatient with a local only. Took about thirty minutes. Cost was $1,200. I was back at work the next day. No pain only minor ache where the cords were cut. Two years later I had the scrotum removed with a local and mild IV sedative. $1,200. Took over a month to fully heal. Over-all fantastic results now with a smooth area beneath the penis.

Can I ask what year you had that done? Inguinal or midline? And what country was it done in?
</p>
<p>
I want it done that way so bad. Quick and simple.
