If you don&#39;t mind me asking, what was the revision to correct?

Add more labia minora, fix up the clitoral hood and to regain my depth again I had lost it all and now I&#39;m all the way past the dots on the soul source dilator.

I&#39;m trying to schedule a depth revision, and if I can get a clitoral hood it would be nice, but I&#39;m not sure if that would add to the cost.
</p>
<p>
through pure neglect (was sexually active for years post-gcs, then my life situation changed and I wasn&#39;t as active as before and lost most of my depth). I was down to about 2&#34;, but I&#39;ve been working on my dilations for almost a year and I&#39;m back to just under 4&#34; (original depth was 5.5&#34;)
