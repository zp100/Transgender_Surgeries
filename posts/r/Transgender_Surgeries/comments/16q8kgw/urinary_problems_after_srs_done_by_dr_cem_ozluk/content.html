Hello ,please stay away from this doctor Cem Ozluk in Turkey. He’s a monster and he will ruin your lives!!!!! Please don’t do sex reassignment surgery with him and also don’t do other surgeries with him. He ruined my life!!! I had sex reassignment surgery more than 2 years ago done by him and something horrible happened one month after the surgery. 1 month after the surgery the hell began. I couldn’t pass the urine at all between 4-24 hours everyday for 1 week and I went to the hospital here in England where I live and they didn’t want to help me and they said the urethra is closed and they wanted to put me tummy catether. I didn’t accept and I left the hospital. I’m only 21 , that time I had only 18 how can I accept something horrible like that at this age ? I want to have a normal life. I never heard any other transgender girl to be in this situation to be asked to put tummy catether after SRS. I can’t accept this no matter what. After I left the hospital this problem only happened again for 2 days then it didn’t happen again for 1 year and I even forgot about it and I thought this problem is gone. Then again 1 year after the surgery the hell began again. I couldn’t urinate at all for 12 hours then after 4 months it happened again then again every 2 months until February this year. Now this didn’t happen anymore since February but it’s about to happen again because I pass the urine very bad and drop by drop and with not strong flow. I didn’t went to the hospital here anymore because of the horrible experience I had that time in the hospital here and I went again to Turkey to Doctor Cem Ozluk in the hope that he will help me. And after the things he said I realised how big of a fraud and scam he is. I told him what the doctors in England said in the hospital and he also said about tummy catether and that my urethra is closed. How can my urethra be closed if I passed the urine for 2 and half years ? He obviously said that to manipulate me to do what he says and to get more money from me. Then what he said it’s really strange , he said that he will try to do urethromy and if the urethromy will fail he will do urethroplasty the next day and he said these things without examinating me and without doing urethra X ray or to put the urethroscope there to see what’s the problem. He said that he will put the diagnosis while doing the surgery that he said it can fail. I read online that urethromy can’t fail it’s just that the problems can reoccur after a while and it can be needed to be repeated but no way what he said. I’m glad I realised he’s a scam and if I would have accepted what he said he would have completely destroyed my urethra forever and would have made things a lot worse. And after he said the urethra is closed he said to me to take video of me passing the urine because he can’t find the urethra hole when he was the one who created it. He created that hole , how he doesn’t know where it is ? And after I send him the video and I had to take screenshot from the video and mark on the screenshot where the urethra is he said he won’t do anything without money when it should’ve been included in the huge amount of money that I paid for the surgery, it should be included to urinate normally and without these problems not to ask again for other big amounts of money to do Urethromy and the second Urethroplasty. Now I’m in a continue hell looking for doctors to properly check the inside of the urethra and see what treatment can be done. I’m desperate and I regret so much doing the surgery with this doctor. He ruined my life!!!! I think he done my urethra poorly on purpose to come back there to ask for more money. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM HIM , HE WILL COMPLETELY DESTROY YOU!!!! DON’T GO TO HIM NO MATTER WHAT!!!!! SAVE YOUR LIVES!!!! And also save other lives by telling everyone about this and sharing this about this doctor everywhere so that no more victims fall into his hands!!!!! And also think carefully when you do this surgery and make a lot research about the doctor that you want to do the surgery with.

Have you seen him in person, or are you communicating with him solely via the internet? The urethra is very small, literally the size of a pin so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s not something you can just see without help, at least from a picture alone.

<p>
There are surgical options available to you, these complications do happen as horrible as they are. Discuss your course of action with a local doctor, your surgeon, or if you don&#39;t feel comfortable returning to him - another trans care surgeon who can do revisions.

Apologies, I didn&#39;t see that you were able to go back in person. I&#39;m very sorry to hear that this has been your experience, hopefully it&#39;s able to be rectified sans urostomy bag. Keep your options open, maybe start reaching out to other surgeons who can help. Urinary issues aren&#39;t too uncommon with this surgery, there are solutions to be had

I’m from Turkey and transgender woman. It is the first time I have ever heard this doctor’s name and he does gender affirmation surgery. Sadly , I should say that You went to a doctor for srs who has almost no experience.. I am so sorry for you, you became a victim of a doctor with no experience

When it comes to FFS in Turkey, there are some good doctors but I still believe that Thailand is much better. Turkey should not be the first option. I’m

There are none. It’s a really bad idea doing this surgery in Turkey.
