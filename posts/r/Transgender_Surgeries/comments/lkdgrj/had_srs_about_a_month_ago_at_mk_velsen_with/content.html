So, I had SRS on the morning of January 11th, 2021 with doctor Kanhai at Mk Velsen in The Netherlands. Recovery is going great, I can do most things again. The only really hard thing is bending down to pick up stuff from the floor, but even that is doable.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is, according to their schedule, once a day. Got up to the 3rd size of dilator, and that&#39;s going in super easily. Tried the largest dilator yesterday, and even that was pretty easy and went in quite deep. My biggest issue is relaxing the muscles down there, so any tips for that are welcome.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, feel free to ask :) I&#39;ve had plenty of people look at it while there, so not like I really have any feeling of privacy around that area at the moment.

Not measured there. I&#39;m probably not at 5.5 inch of depth, I think just shy of 5 inch. Purely based on how far the dilators go in. Then again, didn&#39;t have too much material to use. Recovery for me was pretty easy, though the beds there were a disaster :P

i based my depth measurements on the soul source dilations i fit until the last dot in inside before i got stopped by the end wall , so could be 5,5 or less depending on how the actual measurements of the dilation &gt; i never had clear answer for it  i also had small materiaal to work with i end up with skin transfer  tbh your result look like mine but better in way of swollen  keep with the cleaning and dont fear to be naked !! that actually will help  veel succes schat xx

Hi! Congrats on your surgery!! And good luck with any following recovery :)
</p>
<p>
Really cool to finally see a result from Kanhai. It&#39;s quite hard to find info ahead of time, I&#39;ve found at least. Although naturally I don&#39;t know how much info they send after they&#39;ve actually planned your surgery üò∂ Fingers crossed that will happen super soon for me.
</p>
<p>
Are you happy with the results/how you expected it to be?
</p>
<p>
And how did you find the recovery in the clinic (especially now with the corona measures)?

Communication indeed isn&#39;t that great. Recovery was pretty okay, though the beds kinda sucked. And apparently my bed couldn&#39;t go high enough for the inspection on Friday... The amount of info they send beforehand was scarce, I only got the prescriptions I needed to pick up at my local pharmacy less than a week before the surgery.
</p>
<p>
As for the results, I&#39;m pretty happy. I stopped painkillers last weekend and don&#39;t really miss them. I&#39;ve been on a bit of exploration, and I was surprised that it was actually kinda wet and pretty soft down there. I&#39;m still way to early to &#34;play&#34; with anything there though.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is pretty easy as well, the biggest size I&#39;ve been told to use (size 3) goes in really easy. I do advise you to look up some exercises to relax your pelvic floor muscles beforehand, that&#39;ll help you out a ton.
</p>
<p>
If you want, I can see if I can send you the PDF with information you get afterwards. That includes information like how to clean everything, how to pee, how to dilate etc.

Thanks so much for the info/your experience!!! I&#39;ll dm you about the pdf, it&#39;d be super nice to have that :)
</p>
<p>
Sounds exactly like the impression I got: surgery is great, but communication is a bit lacking (Even though they are honest about that, tight with personnel and such, it&#39;s a bit unfortunate cause I would love to be able find out EVERYTHING ahead of time :p)
</p>
<p>
Do you know roughly how long people stay in the clinic? (Barring serious complication of course). Cause I heard they are pretty quick in getting people up and walking about. I have to travel relatively far so it&#39;s something I think about a lot :p.

A normal stay for SRS is roughly a week.
</p>
<p>
I arrived on Monday around 06:30, went upstairs for surgery at around 08:00. Woke up again at 13:30 or something, though my first memories are from around an hour later. The rest of the day is mostly sleeping/waking because of the anesthesia. I did ask for something to eat at around 20:00, because I was getting really hungry then.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday you&#39;re supposed to get out of bed, if you can. If you get out of bed, they&#39;ll remove the dripline. Besides that, not much happening.
</p>
<p>
Wednesday is also a slow day, they want you to walk around a bit. Also, I think Wednesday is the day you start bladder training. You have a catheter, and they want you to close it until you have to pee. Once you&#39;ve peed, call them to measure how full your bladder still is, and to write down how much you peed. You
<em>
may
</em>
have to go to the bathroom for number 2, if you&#39;re lucky.
</p>
<p>
Thursday is more of the same, you&#39;ll regain more mobility. I had the luck that a friend of mine was also there for the same operation, so we had a bit of a stroll in the clinic.
</p>
<p>
Friday is when you&#39;ll get your catheter and the wad of bandages (in your new vagina) removed. Removing the bandages felt like removing an endless string of anal beads üòÖ The catheter is pretty painless if you follow their instructions. Then dr Kanhai will inspect the inside, this may hurt a bit. Shortly after, you&#39;ll get instructed on how to dilate. After all this, you just have to pee once more before you can go home.
</p>
<p>
Do make sure you have someone to pick you up, because you sure as hell aren&#39;t driving for the next week or two. Public transport is probably also a no-go because of how sensitive everything is.
</p>
<p>
Once home, you probably want to dilate, take a nice shower, eat something and hop into bed.

They did at the intake, but it was no problem. I&#39;ve been hovering around a BMI of 30 for the better part of 2020, and only managed to drop it a bit lower since November/December. It wasn&#39;t a deal breaker for them though
