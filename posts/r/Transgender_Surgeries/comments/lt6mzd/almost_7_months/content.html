text didn&#39;t show. I did this in Montreal. I don&#39;t have a super pronounced labia minora but I&#39;m happy with how it is healing overall.

These kind of results make me feel hopeful about one day getting mine done. Out of curiosity has anyone here done the surgery themselves? I have been reading about it and I think it may be possible with some major research and practice

Is this a joke? There is no way someone could craft a good result solo.

Even the best surgeons have multiple people working with them. If an expert cant (or at least won’t) do it completely by themselves then idk how anyone would think they’d be able to in any way perform such a delicate surgery on their own body.

Unless you&#39;ve done it yourself I don&#39;t see how you can say that. Are you a surgeon ?

I’ve had bottom surgery (albeit I’m ftm) and it required both a plastic surgeon and a urologist plus a team and took multiple hours.

No.  It’s totally not possible.  You’ll end up dead.  Trust me.  This is a 4 hour surgery, and if you care about such things, involves intricate ability to deal with nerves and blood vessels and veins and skin and scars and pain and muscles. If by some miracle, one didn’t end up bleeding out before they got to the hospital, there is NO away that what was left would be sensate and functional and free of chronic pain and not leading to massive urinary issues for life. Trust me.  And I’m someone who has pushed the DIY thing much further than almost anyone.
<br>
I would NEVER attempt this type of intricate and dangerous surgery involving so many body systems. Ask yourself:  would you trust putting your hands into a second year med student to do this rather than a board certified specialist? Because I guarantee, the second year med student will know more about nerves and muscles and the plumbing involved on a theoretical level than you...and they would not have to worry about blood loss or shock or anything else stopping their ability to complete it.  But they WOULD botch you horribly. The primary thing that differentiates those surgeons that do this well from a 3rd or 4th year med student is YEARS of practice and learning how to move their hands in such delicate ways as to make this a relatively safe procedure in  their hands...and then all the technology and safety and backup they have to keep you from dying or 100 different things you could. NO. its disturbing that you even think that tbh.  thats some major illogical hubris.

No one is giving them selves vaginoplasty. There was a few people that have done complete nullification and it’s extremely stupid and dangerous

Litterally the could took a catheter shove it in his Willy and cut of the surrounding tissue. That about all your going to be able to perform by yourself and you might as well just take some scissor to yourself cause it the same thing

Very good. What is clitoral sensitivity like? How much of the previous sensitive (orgasmic) area gets preserved?
