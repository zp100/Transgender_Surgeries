My girlfriend wants to have Dr Belanger do her srs but heard from someone that she wasn&#39;t taking on any more patients, whether that be temporary or permanently she isn&#39;t sure. I dont suppose you heard anything like that? I&#39;d appreciate anything you can tell me.
</p>
<p>
BTW, result looks great, congrats! üòÅ

Hmm I would really doubt it‚Äôs permenantly. They do go on vacations in the summer so that may be why the wait is a little longer than normal

Congratulations! Thank you for posting this. She is my number one choice and I am going to ask for her when I finally get my consultation booked. Would you be willing to comment on your experiance with her and the clinic?

Yes! Dr. B√©langer is incredibly fucking chill. I didn‚Äôt really see her much, but she seemed really nice.
</p>
<p>
As for the clinic and Ascl√©piade, the staff is awesome and cares for your needs. The food is really good and balanced. The rooms are chill and do not look like typical scary hospital room.
</p>
<p>
Overall, everything went really suspiciously great. I had a feeling that something bad would happen because everything was perfect. And there was a little funny drama;
</p>
<p>
A girl arrived in the room next to me. I hear her crying and talking to herself. When staff comes, she yells at them. So they bring friends, but they can‚Äôt even enter she‚Äôs screaming at them. Later I see her outside with two police officers. She tries to flee! But the officers grabbed her. She comes back two days later with police. For the rest of her stay, there was 24/7 a guard at her door and could only go outside with the guard.
</p>
<p>
I never knew why she reacted like this and I so badly want to know. 10/10 would go again

I so glad you shared this! I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to post results from a surgeon I‚Äôll probably (hopefully) get to work with. Thanks a lot, really.
