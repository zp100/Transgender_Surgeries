You&#39;ll be fine, they do this surgery often and have lots of experience. Pain management is done very well there, just need to ask the nurses if you&#39;re in more pain than Tylenol can handle.
</p>
<p>
I actually woke up on the table as they were finishing up, it was a very weird experience.

I mostly just remember asking if I can go back to sleep and moving my head side to side to look around. My pain tolerance is pretty high. I kinda sat around 3/10 for pain most of my time there. Had a couple times I had to ask for tramadol, but some girls had it much worse. Was like 12 of us across 2 surgery dates when I was there.

I never let my pain go above a 6. As soon as any discomfort hit I asked for a tramadol and if that didn&#39;t resolve I got oxycodone. I was never in any agony. Quite surprised

Oh wow.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not a very big eater. I usually just eat one meal a day, or else I feel like I&#39;m overly full. I grew up in a family where no food was on the table, so I grew up with this habit of not eating much.

healing all that damage is VERY calorie intensive, your body needs lots of calories and protein to heal well! I have friends who ate MUCH more then normal and ended up losing weight while healing

I heard that plenty of us wake up mid surgery.
</p>
<p>
I probably won&#39;t as I&#39;m also having tracheal shave at the same time, and they will use general anesthesia in combination.
</p>
<p>
I was told that for vaginoplasty alone, it&#39;s usually spinal block only.

It&#39;s twilight sleep and nerve block with morphine. I&#39;m allergic to morphine so I had no additional pain killers during surgery. The first few hours after were rough but it&#39;s much better now

Do you mind going into a bit more detail for those of us with a bad reaction to morphine? The post care is probably the only thing that I have hangups about.

After care pain relief is done with Tylenol,  tramadol or oxytocin. You will get 2 Tylenol and 2 tramadol on a regular basis if the pain is really bad they&#39;ll time you an oxytocin to help. Their goal though is to minimize pain they unfortunately can&#39;t relieve all of it.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday afternoon I definitely needed the oxytocin, today wqs pretty good but now I&#39;m finding my legsnar3 cramping from being limited to how I can safely move!

Pain is very well managed. Just ask for narcotics when it starts being uncomfortable. I was quite fortunate as my pain was super low. There were other girls at Asclepediade that looked to be having a hard time. Read the booklet like over and over again

Had mine with Dr Brassard 3 years ago and the pain was very manageable honestly. The post surgery care is the most intense aspect during the first 3 months.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m gonna say though, however intense you find it, DO NOT stray from it, it is vital for the correct healing that you do all the dilation and post cleaning / drying as required. It&#39;s a full time job at first but it gets better and easier with time as you reduce treatments and intensity.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, otherwise, don&#39;t fear the pain. GRS MTL are extremely capable. The nurses at l&#39;asclÃ©piade do a great job of taking care of you and teaching you what you need to know and do

Thank you for your words.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, I have my boyfriend taking off work for three weeks after my return, so I&#39;ll have him help me during that time. Should I need more time with him around ?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m already pretty much staying at home and sedentary most of the time, so that won&#39;t be a problem. I expect it to be hard for about 3 months, especially the dilatation schedule, and have a bit of post-op depression, but I&#39;m ready.
</p>
<p>
I have a crazy week coming up. We bought a house, so we are moving on the 30th of August and then leaving for MontrÃ©al on Sept. 2nd. I still have tons to pack and get ready for the move, but at least it helps me not to stress out too much about surgery.

You should be good, it&#39;s great that he&#39;s taking 3 weeks. One of the hardest things is cooking and things like that, you&#39;re just so exhausted all the time from the healing so if he can manage that at first, it will be of great help for sure.

Congratulations on the house and the surgery btw!

I found that keeping a regular schedule helped. Plan your days at l&#39;AsclÃ©piade around the meal times, giving yourself time to walk around when you can, and ice yourself often between meals. The nurses are going to be distributing your medications at meal times, so it&#39;s best to get them at consistent times. Eat what you can when you can. Your body needs nutrition while you&#39;re healing. Hydrate. Sleep.

Looks great! I&#39;m at 8 weeks from Dr Brassard and my only issue is hypergranulation. I&#39;m seeing my Endo next week and hoping she knows somewhere she can refer me to get it treated locally.

That&#39;s my problem. I don&#39;t currently have a family doctor. Mine retired last year and haven&#39;t had any luck getting a new one.

Yeah, a local trans group suggested going to a walk-in to get referred to a local trans clinic that has experience treating it. But I already had my Endo appointment coming up, so I&#39;m hoping she can just refer me instead of having to explain stuff to a walk-in.

Congrats! Looks great, though I&#39;m a little biased as I&#39;m a Brassard girl too.
