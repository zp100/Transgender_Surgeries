I’m very sorry that happened to you. You are absolutely right to feel that your trust has been violated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Keep an open mind when you talk to your surgeon. There may have been technical reasons they changed the plan when they got in.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I would be very hesitant to throw around words like “malpractice.” (For reference: I’m a director of a US medical malpractice insurance carrier.) while it is technically possible that there was negligence that occurred, filing a malpractice lawsuit is simply not going to help you. If you can get a lawyer to take your case (and this is a big if, as malpractice lawyers tend to only take cases where there are economic harms like death or disability that result in big awards), then the case will drag on for years until you give up or the insurer pays some “go away” money. So threatening malpractice is an empty threat — and your surgeon knows this. Making the threat only turns your relationship adversarial.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you are unhappy with your outcome and the surgeon departed from the agreed-upon plan, then it is entirely reasonable to expect that the surgeon will make it right. And you should not be shy in asserting that expectation in your post op visit.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Again, I am sorry this happened to you. I hope that it turns out to be ok in the end.

#3 really drives home how colossally fucked and stacked against patients the medical system is. Pretty much no recourse for OP to get justice for having something put in her body she doesn&#39;t consent to.

I mean it’s even worse than you might think. If a patient is harmed and they happen to be a member of a marginalized group: non-white, old, poor, LBTG, obese, etc, the odds you’ll get a competent lawyer to take the case is a lot lower unless the negligence is outrageous and there is a major injury. And of course juries also devalue the suffering of certain groups on top of that. For all you hear about runaway juries, doctors still win 80% of the cases that go to trial. (Maddeningly the cases doctors lose have less to do with whether there was malpractice than whether the patient was sympathetic enough.) and the way the system puts a dollars and cents value on human life is … eye-opening.
</p>
<p>
It’s a broken, repulsive system and everyone who works in it knows it but nobody seems to be able to fix it.

<p>
Like yeah, the medical system is fucked, but threatening malpractice isn&#39;t attacking who you think it is.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s attacking the doctor and only the doctor. Malpractice suits can jack up malpractice insurance prices or even make them lose their license. Doctors aren&#39;t going to continue talking to you or trying to help you if you start threatening malpractice.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s better for doctors to immediately cut off contact and fire you as a patient than continue to engage with an adversarial patient who can, at the very least, cause you a headache.

<p>
I like all the other reasons, but this one seems suspect to me. If the surgeon found something that required them to change the plan, wouldn&#39;t the correct action be to back out of the surgery and discuss it with the patient? Or is it possible there&#39;s some kind of agreement in place that allows a surgeon to proceed with their best judgement in those scenarios?

I’m a doctor but not a plastic surgeon so I can only speak generally. Most consents will have a clause that allows the surgeon to exercise some discretion, within reason. For example if o go in for an appendectomy and find a tumor, I can biopsy or maybe resect the tumor without waking up the patient (which would subject them to the risks of a second surgery/anesthesia). But it would probably not be ok to turn the appendectomy into, say, a hysterectomy without waking the patient up and reviewing the risks/benefits.
</p>
<p>
Now my guess (just a guess) is that swapping one implant for another is probably within a reasonable limit, if there was a good reason. To be honest I am having a hard time thinking of a charitable explanation for using implants 50% larger than the agreed upon size, though.

This is a judgement call. I&#39;m paying for at least part of the surgery regardless, and if I woke up with a bill for 3 grand and nothing done I&#39;d be quite unhappy as well. I am unqualified to say what looks best for you. That&#39;s up to you to decide, but 220 vs 320 doesn&#39;t see terribly off size with, however, I get that they used different series. It would be interesting to know if they price difference was being exploited maybe?

Giving them the benefit of the doubt, they might not know that they made a mistake and so telling them will let them know and they will fix it.
</p>
<p>
Even if it&#39;s not a mistake and they realised that they didn&#39;t have the right type and size after putting you under or something, they shouldn&#39;t have done something to your body that you didn&#39;t ask for (unless it&#39;s necessary to keep you alive or whatever, but implants definitely are not that).
</p>
<p>
Whatever their reason for using the wrong ones, complain because they won&#39;t fix it if they can think that it&#39;s alright.

Complain. Do the research and know who to talk to about malpractice also in case they get reluctant or defensive.  The sooner you complain and make your displeasure well known might impact the best and optimal time to get them to redo it - seems to me immediate revision is required in order to make sure your healing time isnt wasted on the wrong set of implants..

Why the benefit of the doubt? This is not putting a burger together. They ask a lot of money for these surgeries.

Not to belittle how expensive these surgeries are, but what makes you think that would change a surgeons intent? No amount of money can change the fact that surgeons are people too who sometimes make mistakes.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, OP, if you&#39;re being strategic about putting a case together it&#39;s basically always in your own best interest to assume good faith and document everything until you can really
<em>
prove
</em>
there is no other explanation.
</p>
<p>
No harm in (quietly) seeking legal advice in the mean time, however.

I’m sorry but I don’t see how this can happen.
</p>
<p>
If the surgeon is properly organized. When someone advise him what they want. They write it down or record it or whatever. Prior to the surgery they look if they have it in inventory. And have it prepared.
</p>
<p>
The fact that they put something else. Means. Or they didn’t take note when the client told them( surgeon in the wrong).
</p>
<p>
Or they didn’t look while they were in the operating room. Or relied on someone else who had brought them. Which again as per per deontology they end up being responsible because they are responsible of all act done in their names.
</p>
<p>
A good surgeon should know what their patient asked for and would be able to see right there this isn’t it.
</p>
<p>
So it leaves to 3 things.
</p>
<p>
Or the surgeon is badly organized and didn’t take note of what the client said and /or didn’t look prior to surgery’s
</p>
<p>
Or the surgeon doesn’t actually care what the client choose and do whatever they want.
</p>
<p>
Or the surgeon ordered the wrong thing for the surgery and still decided to put them in because” he knows better” and didn’t want show he didn’t prepared properly.
</p>
<p>
If a car dealership sends you a car the wrong colour even if he saw it before they shipped it. Its not a mistake. its because they didn’t care at some point.

You should maybe take a look around this thread as several other people have proposed more explanations than the ones you gave.
</p>
<p>
You also seem to have ignored the practical aspect of negotiations and why it’s generally the worst option to jump on the offensive before collecting enough information to make a strong case.

U know trans girl keeps cutting deals with surgeons who keeps doing it to others after.
</p>
<p>
Reporting the surgeon to the board does not prevent her from getting a deal. In fact when the board confirms that he did put something else than what was requested. She can actually take it to civil court and win her case since she has the decision of the board.
</p>
<p>
Of course she can simply go ask the surgeon and take a deal. But that surgeon will continue doing it over and over again.
</p>
<p>
Look at Brassard  in Montreal who now operates girls in 1:30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
And this will continue because  for every 100 garbage surgeries he does maybe 10 have the guts To complain. Out of that. Maybe one will actually take action necessitating  a deal.  So he’ll cut the deal and continue acting the same way he does and girls will continue killing themselves due in part of the crappy surgeries he does.
</p>
<p>
I know good girls that did kill themselves because of crappy surgeries. And if people would have stop cutting deals and actually report those surgeons.  Lives would have been saved.
</p>
<p>
But maybe I’m just less selfish than the average trans girl I guess.

Well it was never ever going to be the last because your implants only have a longevity of roughly 10 years (yes some may last longer but the longer in the body after that, the higher the chances of rupture or other significant complications).
</p>
<p>
I can understand that having the wrong implant is not to the plan and frustrating, but hopefully your surgeon had good reason for doing what they did?  At least talk to them and gather more facts before bandying around words like malpractice. The minute you use that word you will 1) put them on the defensive and make this confrontational rather than cooperative. And to make things right you really really need it to be cooperative.

I&#39;m not assuming malice, just malpractice. Besides the size, this is not the implant technology I heckin requested !!!! Considering the size : I would rather not have BA than 320cc silicon
</p>
<p>
Oh I&#39;m not screaming at people, just sometimes in my room. I asked for benzos as soon as I found out not for this to spiral out of control. This is a breach of my consent and my trust.

First take some time to calm down, rest and relax.  After make sure to gather all of the documentation you have, I take phone photos of everything so I have digital copies.  And query your surgeon why the changes we&#39;re done and what your concerns are.
</p>
<p>
As others highlighted many times with breast implants a change is made because the doctor realizes the thing he&#39;s trying to put inside your body isn&#39;t going to work or look right.  Sometimes they make the right judgement call, other times they don&#39;t.  But if you work with them, its not unheard of for the surgeon to open you back up and adjust your implants if you are really unhappy with the work after its settled.

<p>
Saying this is malpractice is like saying a cop crashing is the same as murdering civilians in cold blood.
</p>
<p>
It happens. Doctors change courses, have incomplete info or even make harmless mistakes. This isn&#39;t malpractice.
</p>
<p>
If they removed all your existing breast tissue rather than giving you implants, that&#39;s malpractice because that&#39;s not even the operation you went for.
</p>
<p>
But changing from 220cc to 320cc is pretty tiny change and discretionary (which you should check all the forms you signed, there&#39;s a 100% chance you signed a form giving the surgeon this discretion)

That makes sens, we agreed to be flexible to implant size (on a 180/220 range at first) What drives me mad is that I wanted that new ergonomix tech, stated it several time and did not get it.

<p>
the email I sent for clinic management
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
&#34;I am extremely distressed about one of my procedures yesterday (Brustvergrößerung mit Eigenfett bds.)
</p>
<p>
As a matter of fact, the surgeon did not respect my choice of implant, using Motiva Anatomical True Fixation Implants instead of Motiva Ergonomix, a technology that was a deciding factor in me getting breast augmentation surgery.
</p>
<p>
Here is an excerpt of an email from me to Dr x dated from May 6th, three weeks after our surgery follow-up in person.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Hallo Dr x / Research made a strong case for the Motiva Ergonomix so I&#39;m gonna go with these :)&#34;
</p>
<p>
We did not discuss implants further.
</p>
<p>
I DID NOT WANT any breast augmentation surgery that would not use this new patented technology that has a lot of praise within the trans community.
</p>
<p>
Yet when I woke up from surgery, I was given the Motiva ID cards for my implants stating these were not Ergonomix but Anatomical. At no point was I signified that I would not get the Ergonomix implants I requested. If Dr Schaff was not ok to operate on me with my implants of choice he should have abstained and I would have found another provider, in France, for this surgery.
</p>
<p>
This is a MAJOR breach of informed consent.
</p>
<p>
I certainly did not agree to what was put in my body and I have rarely felt so violated.
</p>
<p>
Before looking into getting appropriate counsel on this matter, I ask that a full reimbursement for this procedure be made to my bank account as soon as possible so I can look into booking another surgery in France in 2 months (see IBAN attached).
</p>
<p>
Also I do not feel that I want to stay here at the Clinic any longer.
</p>
<p>
One of my friends is ready to fly me back to Paris tomorrow evening and I will leave as soon as medically reasonable.
</p>
<p>
Please advise. &#34;

Some news : went for surgery again yesterday, finally got my pick of implants (motiva ergonomics 260cc with 2.8cm cm projection vs motiva anatomical 320cc with 4.6cm projection).
</p>
<p>
Surgeon threw in some work on my scars and another revision downstairs to make it worth my while.
</p>
<p>
I am, of course, exhausted with 2 surgeries and 4 days of intense stress.

Something very similar happened to me, except I got much smaller than we agreed upon. I was mostly respectful when dealing with the surgeon after but was clear that I wasn’t happy with the outcome. He agreed to waive his surgeon’s fee so if I paid the operating room fees ($3,500) then he would fix it. Although this isn’t ideal, I felt it was the best realistic option. As other people have pointed out, suing a surgeon is very difficult and time consuming and may result in more loss.
</p>
<p>
Edit: the revision went amazing and it has been my most successful surgery of all the surgeries I have gotten. Very pleased with the final outcome. I know it sucks, but surgeons are human too and have to make decisions on the fly sometimes. I’d recommend trying to work towards some similar revision surgery. I was PISSED at first but have come to realize this is just the way life is sometimes.

This happened to me with another surgeon. Did you sign pre surgical consent documents noting the implant type and size? If so before confronting the surgeon ask for a copy of this documentation. Verify the implant type and size does not match that listed on the card and then have a conversation with the surgeon. Pending the outcome of the Convo either allow surgeon to fix the mistake or lawyer up.

Welcome to the world of trans surgeons who think they can do whatever they want.
</p>
<p>
:( so sorry. Report him to the board. Plain and simple.
</p>
<p>
I know some might say it’s hardcore. But if no one does it that whole issue with surgeons doing wth they want with us even after we state we don’t want it will continue.

I&#39;m sorry this happened to you. But for some reason men assume we want big boobs. I had to turn down a BA 7 times in 1 consult with a surgeon. I came for something completely different... Needless to say I did not go for that surgeon. Sadly healthcare is so flawed.

This raises a lot of red flags. First he decided to digress from what you both agreed to do. Second, if he did this, god knows what else he did to you without consent. I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re pretty numb at the moment? I&#39;m hoping he didn&#39;t severe any nerves on purpose. This would make me paranoid as it doesn&#39;t make sense why he would do this when you&#39;re measured during pre-op consult and are asked about your wants and needs. What this surgeon did is evil as if he has some fucked up fantasy about trans women and wanted to mess up with you by putting in a much bigger implant without consent or warning prior to surgery. I&#39;d be scared to have surgery with him again and I&#39;d suggest talking to a lawyer and asking this dickhead of a surgeon to explain himself. Don&#39;t buy his excuses but scrutinize it with impunity. This is no different to rape and is in fact worse!

Its better he went bigger. We have extremely wider chests. The implants you chose may of made ur breasts look insanely far apart.

Not if OP didn&#39;t want bigger.

<p>
That&#39;s not universally true. While testosterone does widen the ribcage, plenty of people exposed to testosterone don&#39;t end up with &#34;extremely wider chests&#34; compared to the average cis woman. Plus, some trans women never even went through testosterone-induced puberty. It&#39;s incorrect &amp; harmful to just assume someone has a massive ribcage because they&#39;re trans.
</p>
<p>
Any alternatives should have been discussed beforehand, decisions like that shouldn&#39;t be made while the patient is under.

I said what i said if you don&#39;t like it too bad for you. Many transwomen complain about having implants too far apart due to the surgeon not choosing a wide enough implant to adequately bring them closer. That&#39;s potentially why the surgeon went bigger. This very thing happened to me resulting in me getting a revision to go larger. Im tired of all this #hugboxing this group is known for. Its not harmful to make a statement transwomen have wider chests than ciswoman and if it&#39;s harmful to you than i suggest you undergo therapy to help you toughen up.

Your experiences aren&#39;t everyone&#39;s. OP wasn&#39;t done any favors by being given bigger than she wanted, along with it being a completely different line of implant from the one she clearly had a preference for. You having an above average chest width has nothing to do with her situation.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not hugboxing to call out misinformation.

<blockquote>
<p>
On average [trans women] do have wider chests than [cis women].
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is true, on average. I said as much in my first comment. That&#39;s also not the same as saying that all trans women have &#34;extremely wider chests&#34;, which is inaccurate.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quit living in fantasyland that nothing seperates you between a biological female because im here to tell you theres plenty!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m not living in fantasyland. I&#39;m just pointing out that you&#39;re making harmful generalizations about the trans community based on your own, anecdotal experiences. I&#39;m sorry that you have an &#34;extremely wider&#34; chest, but that&#39;s not the case for all trans women, nor is it relevant to OP&#39;s point.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Fact is her surgeon changed her implant size for bigger and there&#39;s a high probability thats why.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
OP expressed that she explicitly did not want the larger implants, or the line of implant used. In other comments she has expressed that she doesn&#39;t have an overly wide build, and would have rather had no implants instead of the larger ones she received.
</p>
<p>
Her surgeon&#39;s decision should have been discussed beforehand. Possible alternative scenarios are a standard at any surgical consultation. Being trans doesn&#39;t magically give the surgeon license to upsize implants just because the surgeon thinks they might look better.
</p>
<p>
Your experience, your anatomy, and your preference for a larger implant have nothing to do with OP&#39;s situation. Deal with it.

3.Theres absolutely nothing wrong with me giving a suggestion for why he may of went larger. Your upset because YOU not op,have expressed some type of fear about talking about transwomen  having a wider chest triggering someone. Which makes zero sense to me. I can not imagine someone hearing transwomen usually having wider chests and now being suicidal etc. You are making a mountain out of an ant hill. And from wat im reading it seems op is more upset about the product type than size. Especially Considering the difference in breast implant cc&#39;s is barely anything. Shes mostly seeing swelling right now. But either way im done arguing about this.

^ ALL of this!!!
</p>
<p>
He may have tried them and figured u would be disappointed with the outcome so he elected to go bigger for proportional reasons. Depending on how u r built 220cc’s is barely or just about a cup size of a difference where 320cc’s is about a cup and a half depending.
</p>
<p>
I asked for 600cc’s and my surgeon gave me 650cc’s because it would match the aesthetic I was going for better. He realized this after inserting the 600’s and remembering what we had discussed well before surgery as well as in the day of.
</p>
<p>
Trust me gurl he most likely did u a favor. If it’s real issue after a month contact him and explain how u feel 😀

Some surgeon didn’t do a safety timeout. Or they did and still fucked up. It’s malpractice. It’s probably an honest mistake and something that can happen without malice, but at the end of the day, you have the wrong hardware inside your body.
</p>
<p>
At a minimum, you should be entitled to get a revision by a different surgeon paid for by the previous surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Any more advice is beyond the scope of Reddit. You’ll need to retain counsel if you want to pursue anything.

No, we&#39;re not doing that. We&#39;re not telling people to settle for the bare minimum of getting surgery
<em>
and
</em>
to be grateful with whatever happens next. OP getting surgery is a right, not a privalege. OP getting the
<em>
exact
</em>
results they want is also a right, not a privelege. Just because you would accept scraps from the world doesn&#39;t mean everyone else does.
</p>
<p>
Do you walk over to people in restaraunts and tell them they shouldn&#39;t complain because people in Africa are starving? Get a grip.

What even? Surgeons fuck up all the time. That&#39;s why malpractice lawsuits actually exist. OP has rights. They are clearly upset and furious and were asking what to do next. Not if this was a big deal. Read the room. Yes this is the Internet, but in this corner of it we&#39;re being kind and supportive.

No idea what me being a transman has to do with anything (??) but that speaks alot more about you than it does me, really.

stop gaslighting him telling him to relax. the OP paid 8k for their surgery they should get exactly what they asked for not any bigger or any smaller. what if your surgeon decides to cut off your clit for fun and you need to suck it up because some people don’t even have the chance to get srs so enjoy your botched pussy. your thinking is backwards and twisted and you need clear psychological assistance and rehab.

Rule 1 is not about that. Have a look at this post which explains moderation on the sub.

Are you sure he actually used the wrong ones and they didn&#39;t just give you the wrong card? Sounds like a major fuck up somewhere. Unfortunately that can happen and your anger is totally understandable. You could sue his ass for that. If it really was the wrong implants I would do that if he doesn&#39;t fix it for free.
