I had gotten all my letters, held my consultation with Rumer and was on track to have top, bottom and FFS at Rumer until my partner told me to check around reddit for surgeon reviews. I was obviously very shocked to discover the collective opinion on her work here. I feel deflated now, and beaten. Betrayed with the realization that cosmetic surgeons don&#39;t seem to follow the same ethics of a normal MD. I feel like I&#39;ve been existing in this deafening echo chamber of positivity among other post-op women. I *did* have this suspicion that everyone around me was being TO POSITIVE, perhaps as a means of publicly justifying their own experiences and whitewashing the bad because focusing on anything but the good was painful for them. I can understand that sentiment.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I had looked at Min Jun as my alternate choice, and have a consultation scheduled with him in two weeks, but I understand that his waiting period is long, like probably longer than two years, and that&#39;s really hard to accept. I&#39;m not getting any younger, and I think I&#39;d be more physically able to recover if I finish this before I&#39;m 40.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what to do next, and I feel lost. I&#39;m paranoid that none of these doctors have our best interests at heart, and will say what suits them to gain another paid patient. I don&#39;t know how to look through the fog or determine which other surgeons would be better alternatives.

Min Jun is one of the best SRS surgeons in the USA at the moment.

Yeah, that thread on Rumer is what tipped me off. It was harsh, but it was what I needed. Are there others like Min Jun that are worth looking into? I know my body only gets one shot at this, but I need to find other alternative options encase my insurance denies the Crane Center.

Will second this recommendation! I went from scheduling a consult to surgery in 6 months with her and absolutely love my results 😊

Rachel Bluebond-Langner and Lee Zhao are also one of the best SRS surgeons in the USA! Check them out as well, they operate at NYU Langone and they have some of the best aesthetic results I’ve seen! Their wait is long but if you get your letters and electrolysis in, they are very good at moving you up the waitlists and they have a wider variety of insurances they accept!

Thank you so much. It took me a little bit of time to process all of this, and calm down from the shock of it all. I looked up Dr. Rachel and I saw the most beautiful thing right off the bat - she takes my insurance, so I&#39;ll likely have fill coverage. I&#39;ve been fighting this worry of coverage for almost six months, as everyone else I found was a &#34;maybe, we&#39;ll see.&#34; I appreciate your help so much.

I will say if you want PI and are able to &#34;front&#34; the money until insurance reimburses you to go to McGinn. She has fairly low wait times because of this. If you want PI or PPT (similar to what Min Jun does) I would say Del Corral. He is the sweetest man and has really good outcomes as well. He also takes insurance and has a good team to help push through for approvals. His wait times are about 3-6 months after consult.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Del Corral also uses some of the newest technology to scan your face for FFS to give you best results.. I&#39;ve heard some good things about his work.

Dr. Jun, Dr. BBL, Dr. Zhao all collaborated &amp; trained together. They developed the most logical intelligent approach to vaginoplasty. Period.

I had my surgery in 5 months after scheduling with Dr. Min Jun. I was on the cancellation list, and people cancel all the time! Go for it! I bet you’ll have the surgery way sooner than you expected! 2 years in a max, but everyone I know did not wait that long, I posted my after surgery pics if you want to see them. I cannot say enough on how great he is.

I am actually super excited, because I&#39;m scheduled for Dr. Jun next April. I&#39;ve got two more sessions to finish my electrolysis, then I just need to clear all the final insurance headaches. I&#39;m really glad I didn&#39;t settle and very thankful to everyone&#39;s advice.

it may be hard to go through right now, but I&#39;m glad you found out when you did.

tbh my headspace has never been ok after she botched me. I know how much waiting sucks (I had to wait 2 years for a consultation on a revision), but it is better than her knife.

I&#39;m so sorry you had to go through that, if there is any consolation at all to it, I believe you and have cancelled my future schedule with her. You&#39;re so strong to tell your story, and may have saved me from a monster.

Take a deep breath! First, you did the right thing at the end of the day! You could have been hurt and have horrible pain and suffering so it’s a blessing you discovered the truth before you actually went through surgery! Given Rumer’s track record, it still disgusts and baffles me that her medical license hasn’t been stripped 🤦‍♀️
</p>
<p>
Here are some places that could help!
</p>
<p>
SRS: I already mentioned Bluebond/Zhao, there is also Geolani Dy/Blair Peters and Kaoutzanis/Higuchi  that did the exact training as Jun with similar aesthetics. Granted his army of minions are going to fight me on this but I don’t think Jun is all that is cracked up to be when it comes to the unnecessary gaslighting and hype he gets on here; however I still think he’s one of the best surgeons and produces quality work but I don’t feel like the other surgeons are getting the credit they deserve and I think their aesthetics are really good so it all comes down to preference really!
</p>
<p>
FFS: You could try Justine Lee, Tommy Liu, Jeffery Jumaily, Dechamps-Braly to name a few. Those particular surgeons I’ve been super impressed with in terms of consistency and quality.
</p>
<p>
Breast surgery: just find a doctor who specializes in transgender breast, I’ve seen great results from Blair Peters for instance and John Pang from Mt. Sinai

Thank you especially for the FFS recommendations! I think considering insurance will cover top, bottom but not FFS, I don&#39;t need to be on the same multi-year wait for it. You and the others here are so good about turning a negative into a positive. I gave Rumer a lot of my time, and a fair amount of money, but the knowledge here was worth the trade.

I heard his wait is getting a lot better with surgery, he’s operating at many locations in SF for more robot time so the surgery time wait is much better!

This was one of the big draws with Rumer originally, claiming she could remove all the hairs during surgery, making electro unnecessary. Of course, now that I&#39;ve mercifully found this subreddit, I know now she doesn&#39;t have a good record even achieving that. So much lost time, planning towards her lies! Still, I&#39;ll trade that time for the knowledge I gained.

Yeah, her manner and ego was noted during the consolations, but what really tipped off my self preservation instinct was her venomous retort that claims of missed hairs were all lies, when I asked if it was really possible to do the procedure without electrolysis. I didn&#39;t know at the time that this subreddit existed, so had no context on these so called &#34;lies!&#34; I was to desperate to doubt something that was to good to be true.

I want to thank all of you for your advise and support. Thank you so much for all your help, and for creating the body of work and community that is this subreddit. Thank you for literally saving my life from what seems more and more like a predator.

You are so brave! I’m so so so sorry about what that horrible Devil Monster did to you! She’s taking advantage of us and it has to stop like yesterday! She just really makes my blood boil how neglected and cocky her demeanor is and how she walks around thinking she’s some hero, TF?! 🤦‍♀️

If you enjoy being butchered, then yes, go to “Dr.” Rumer. You’ll enjoy not having bottom gender dysphoria, but take on a whole different type of dysphoria…the choice of collaborating with a doctor who disables your genitals into roadkill. In fact, I’ve seen better looking roadkill than “Dr.” Rumer’s results.
</p>
<p>
Go to Dr. Min Jun. Not Bowers, Satterwhite, or Wittenberg/Bonnington. Dr. Min Jun ONLY.
</p>
<p>
He provides the latest technology &amp; methods to vaginoplasty. If one doesn’t have any chronic medical condition to accessing their abdominal peritoneal tissue.
</p>
<p>
Yes. His wait is long. I feel lucky having him as my doctor. You don’t want to do this major surgery half-assed. Botch any other surgery, just not bottom.

Wittenberg/Bonnington and Satterwhite are just fine as well, seen pretty decent aesthetics from them, that’s all I say.

I’m open to admit “good results” are subjective. Some people simply have lower standards. That’s all I’ll say.

And for the record, I absolutely love Jun’s work. I just want to honor more surgeons out there doing amazing work too, and everybody has their preference and views on certain things which I can respect! I also see a ton of people who just happen to resonate with Jun’s work so very happy for him.

This. He obviously does great work but people keep acting like he&#39;s the ONLY option and if you go to anyone else you getting below standards.. I&#39;m sure that it doesn&#39;t make people who can&#39;t go there or mentally would rather die than wait any longer for his wait times feel good.

Anyone that goes to a surgeon other than Min Jun are NOT getting low standards. Saying that is just cruel to people who can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to go to Min Jun. Some live too far away and aren&#39;t willing to have the travel potentially hurt healing. Some can&#39;t because of insurance companies being assholes. Some don&#39;t have insurance that he takes and can&#39;t get an exception from insurance.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s obviously plenty giving bad outcomes. There are plenty of surgeons out there giving amazing outcomes too. I have seen some incredible vaginas on here. Everyone has preferences of how they  want their body to look and act. Some don&#39;t want discharge that comes with PPT, some really want that.
</p>
<p>
Edit.. obviously do NOT go to Rumer. Never once agreed to that! Just saying Min Jun is NOT the ONLY option. There is the team that trained or trained with Min Jun in NY, McGinn, Del Corral.

What’s wrong with Wittenberg/Bonnington? Overall they’re on the good end as a whole from what I’ve seen especially for ppt which is what I’m looking for. They seem to be also getting better and better with time.

Don’t worry, you are in great hands with Wittenberg/Bonnington! I really love their care and many people resonate with her work, her work is quality for sure! Go with your gut feeling! 🙌

Thank you! I’ve seen many good opinions and increasingly good results from Bonnington on top of already Wittenberg’s really good results. I am very favoured to the full ppt technique they do, and yeah, thank you for squashing some of the anxiety I was having, I am planning on going with my gut feeling.

Their stitching skills are not my liking. Very obvious. Like Sally from “The Nightmare Before Christmas”. Ever seen it? The inciscions look like teeth running through the labia majora.
</p>
<p>
I don’t understand how Dr. Jun did it, but my scars are very minimal. Flat, one line, thin, clean. I still intend on getting medical tattooing, to blend things further. But that’s only because I’m super particular.

That’s very interesting, I’m wondering what do you mean by “teeth running through the labia majora”? I don’t really understand what that means because to me their scars heal just fine just like any other reputable surgeon would but I’m curious to know more about the suture work? Do you have specific examples? I’m really fascinated to see how surgeons sutures differ with each other.
