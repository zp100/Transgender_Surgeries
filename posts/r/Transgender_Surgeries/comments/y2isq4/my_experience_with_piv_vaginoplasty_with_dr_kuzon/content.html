<p>
I&#39;m typing this up as much to inform y&#39;all as I am to hopefully exorcise some of the demons I picked up along the way. I hope it helps somebody, especially my fellow Michigan girls. I&#39;m going to avoid editorializing as much as I can, but if you&#39;re thinking of going to Dr. Kuzon for this procedure, read to the end. This has been the longest three weeks of my life.
</p>
<p>
I sought a full-depth vaginoplasty through Dr. William Kuzon at University of Michigan. He was the only plastic surgeon available through my insurance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Sept 20
</strong>
- procedure. Was deadnamed and misgendered by a nurse in the pre-op staging area. Vomited several times when I came out of anesthesia after my procedure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Sept 20-26
</strong>
- hospital stay. Lost a lot of blood, was usually sitting in a puddle of it when the nurse came to change my bed pad. I missed my first 2-3 meals because I couldn&#39;t make myself eat. Even the chow hall remarked to my nurses that I&#39;d missed meals.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon came to apprise me of how the surgery had gone. I had five inches of depth. Dr. Kuzon&#39;s bedside manner can seem cold and even military at first - he talks and you listen - but if you&#39;re in a bad way, you can pick up on his sympathy if you pay attention.
</p>
<p>
The nurses wanted me to get out of bed and sit in a chair my second or third day there, WITHOUT a donut cushion. It was like trying to sit on a cactus. I made my boyfriend bring my donut from the hotel, and even then it was a bracing experience. I accidentally overdid it my first time - I was just sitting in a chair watching a fucking movie! - but by the time I got back in bed I was so wiped I was crying.
</p>
<p>
Had a lot of problems with how I was lying in the bed and could not sit up - muscle spasms in my thighs that made it impossible to sleep, dragging on my sutures that caused increased bleeding. I begged the nurse for muscle relaxers to make the cramps stop. I realized a few days into my stay that there was no support for my ass, which caused me to constantly slide down the back of the bed and my posterior sutures (the bottom of my vagina) were supporting the full weight of my upper body. Three days in, I discovered that I could raise the foot of my bed, which created a sort of &#34;seat&#34; crease in the middle and this was a game changer. Relatively speaking, the rest of my stay was a breeze.
</p>
<p>
Because of the hot flashes caused by coming off of hormones, I was constantly asking the nurses to turn the thermostat down, put blankets on my feet, bring me ice water. I must have looked insane.
</p>
<p>
Halfway through my stay I had an incident during the night--I was repeatedly waking up gasping for air every time I fell asleep. I googled it, found out that opioids can make you stop breathing in your sleep (&#34;respiratory depression&#34;), and called the nurse to ask him to dial my oxycodone dosage way back. He showed me the incentive spirometer, which nobody had bothered to tell me about, and put the pulse oximeters on my finger. Every time I fell asleep, my oxygen would dip, the desat alarm would go off and wake me up. He put an oxygen cannula in my nose.
</p>
<p>
Had my bolster, filler, catheter, and drains removed the day before my discharge in one wild-ass 20-minute session. I thought the catheter would be the worst part, but it was actually the drain line in my abdomen he snatched out like he was starting a chainsaw. It felt like he&#39;d pulled out a combat knife I hadn&#39;t felt go in. The speculum was a fucking TRIP - feeling someone insert and then spread a tool where nothing had ever been was indescribable.
</p>
<p>
Had a hard time with standing up, as I would get lightheaded and starry-eyed when I tried to go to the bathroom, almost passed out a few times. Pissed like a pro as soon as the Foley came out - I was proud of that.
</p>
<p>
I was snorking down multiple laxatives the whole time and drinking ice water like a fish, but I didn&#39;t manage to BM until my last day. I still had to beg for an enema and when that didn&#39;t work, I had to slap on a pair of purple gloves and remove the hard BM manually myself. When I tried to push, I sprayed blood into the toilet, so that was a no-go.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Post-procedure, first surgery:
</strong>
went straight from the hospital to my first follow-up appointment. Kuzon said I had a little necrosis just above my posterior sutures, but it wasn&#39;t too alarming.
</p>
<p>
After a week in the hospital swimming in my own blood and having strangers wipe my ass for me because I couldn&#39;t see my sutures, the extremely invasive follow-up examination was all the trauma I could stand. I cried the whole four hour drive home, with nap breaks. My friends kept asking me questions like what I wanted to eat, but I couldn&#39;t handle thinking. I just wanted to be taken care of and be given food to eat.
</p>
<p>
By this time my hair was disgusting and my beard had grown out a bit. Since I&#39;d had laser, though, it came out white. We stopped at a Taco Bell and I struggled to sit on my donut, eating myself sick on greasy food and staring dead ahead at nothing. I felt like I&#39;d been rescued from a cage in somebody&#39;s basement and probably looked like some feral wilderness prophet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Sept 26-Oct 2
</strong>
- I was home. At first I thought everything was fine. After my first shower in a week and a half, I felt human again and I had plenty of energy, and outside of having to waddle everywhere, I had almost no pain and felt pretty good. I could dilate to the third dot on the smallest dilator.
</p>
<p>
CW: Photos of blood and rot -
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7KBhLLeqWvM3JAkf9">Then the necrosis became a major problem.
</a>
Every time I dilated, I would fill my chuck with a puddle of rusty-looking blood. I was bleeding through my maxipads and staining all my sheets. This zombie puss stank to high heavens and became a nightmare. The bottom began to tear apart to the point I was worried it would reach my anus.
</p>
<p>
I ended up driving back down to Ann Arbor that Sunday and begging the surgeon to help me. They put me on the docket for surgery the next day, which turned out to be a reconstructive vulvoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Our car exploded on the expressway just outside of Flint, MI on the way down, and a Facebook friend had to pick us up and carry us the rest of the way to Ann Arbor. I love you, friend. You know who you are.
</p>
<p>
I was awake and fully lucid until they put me on the operating table. One of Kuzon&#39;s residents cut out all of the necrosis, re-strucured my entire vulva, and used part of the labia majora to create a skin graft for the worst part of the necrosis. I also lost 3% of my canal, but my clitoris and urethra were okay. Kuzon cut into my urethra to assess it, and then sutured it back up, which was fun and cool.
</p>
<p>
In the recovery area as I was waking up from anesthesia, I experienced the most singularly horrifying pain I&#39;ve ever endured in my life. It felt like someone was holding a welding torch to the inside of my right thigh. Easily a 300 out of 10, getting kicked in the nuts would have been a cool breeze. I screamed at the top of my lungs, told the nurses to kill me, and did my best to tear the side rails off the bed. We finally got it managed with gabapentin and I stayed conscious long enough to give someone a thumbs up.
</p>
<p>
I had to repeatedly ask about being discharged, and the nurses never did remove the catheter securer on the inside of my thigh.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Oct 3-10.
</strong>
I was discharged the day after my second surgery and spent the week holed up in a Hampton Inn down the road, ruining all their towels with blood and living on hotel breakfast and expensive takeout. All in all between my boyfriend staying there for my first surgery and us both staying there for my second, I&#39;d put the total hit at around $1500.
</p>
<p>
I was not allowed to dilate, irrigate, or take a shower this entire week. I discovered halfway through that maxipads were why my lateral sutures wouldn&#39;t stop bleeding, because the edges were too abrasive. I stopped wearing them and went back to just fluff and panties. The bleeding stopped.
</p>
<p>
By the time I walked into Kuzon&#39;s office for the fourth time in three weeks, I was extremely traumatized. When the nurse called me up from the waiting room and asked me how I was, I told her I was in Hell and as I followed her into the exam room, I started sobbing at the idea they might have more bad news for me.
</p>
<p>
I climbed up on the exam table, pulled out the slide for my feet, and laid down to cry quietly and await the next verdict. I had already decided that if he told me any more bad news that could put me back in the OR, I was just going to ask them to take me out back and Kevorkian my ass.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Kuzon and his entire entourage of 7-8 people came in and put my feet in stirrups so they could gather around and watch while he cut the bolster off.
</p>
<p>
<em>
No notes!
</em>
One of the assistants came in to make sure I could dilate before I left. That&#39;s where I discovered that I&#39;d lost depth over the week and now could not dilate past the first dot on the smallest SoulSource dilator. I held the dilator in for 20 minutes while the very warm and helpful assistant took the catheter anchor off my thigh with alcohol.
</p>
<p>
We talked one of our friends/coworkers from back home into coming to get us, a shuttle driver that didn&#39;t have much to do anyway.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Oct 10 and on / Back home after second surgery, final photo in album
</strong>
- today is Wednesday, and overall I feel much healthier than before the reconstructive vulvoplasty, but my pain is much higher and my energy is much lower. The bleeding has all but stopped, and I have a lot of skin slough discharge, which I am controlling through dozens upon dozens of gauze rolls.
</p>
<p>
My car is still sitting at a Midas in Flint. I don&#39;t know what we&#39;re going to do with it. I&#39;m hoping my boyfriend cowboys up and goes to take care of it. We will have to junk it as it is too expensive to fix or tow home.
</p>
<p>
The wound separation coming down from my posterior suture was apparently not addressed. The bottom end of my vagina now frays into several deep fissures. It is to my profound relief that they generally do not hurt. I hope they somehow fix themselves as I recover.
</p>
<p>
Dilation has not improved. It appears that I have permanently lost depth, even though Kuzon himself told me that I would not. I also frequently experience extremely painful muscle spasms in my anus, mostly after I dilate. I have the feeling this is being caused by the posterior suture fissures.
</p>
<p>
I got the constipation controlled, although I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because I&#39;m being stingy with the oxycodone or because I am eating Dulcolax like Tic-Tacs.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, let me know if you&#39;d like me to keep updating this horror show until I am better.

That was a great write up. I was on the edge of my seat there in the middle, even though I was wincing with flashbacks from my own experience. Looking at the wound dehiscence around your vulva it, not as bad as it appears. It will heal better than you think. Keep doing the updates. My concern, other than depth, would be developing granulation. It&#39;s likely and common. Don&#39;t be surprised if that challenge becomes chapter 2.

What an absolutely harrowing experience. The way you wrote it down though... I felt it in my body. And I even had to chuckle - despite everything you still have a sense of humor, which i find rather astounding.
<br>
I do hope things will get much, much better. Yes, keep us updated.

Holy hell I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;ve gone through this. You&#39;ve deserved better at every step. But seriously thank you for taking the time to share your story. Please do continue to update! I&#39;ve been considering Kuzon and U of M since I&#39;m local, but I&#39;ve never actually heard from someone who&#39;s been. Thank you so much

I highly, highly suggest not going to Kuzon. He botched mine and almost killed me with necrosis and sepsis. I had to go back in for an emergency revision two weeks after my initial GRS because my vagina was rotting out.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to that, I lost two inches of my depth. Now my canal is barely as long as my finger. And I still don&#39;t have any feelings anywhere except for, miraculously, my clitoris.

Omg I’m so sorry. I thought it worked out in the end, I misread. Thank you for the warning, but I live by U of M and I already got it scheduled with Medicaid. Idk if I will get another opportunity. My Partner got hers done by Dr. Kuzon and it turned out really good. She just had a couple revisions like a webbing and a cyst. Thank you for the input tho I really appreciate it. I’m going to explore some more options. That’s so scary. 💖
