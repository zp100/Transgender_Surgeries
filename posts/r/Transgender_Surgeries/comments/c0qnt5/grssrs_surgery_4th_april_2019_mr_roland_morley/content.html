Kimberley’s Surgery – 4th April 2019 Roland Morley UK Charing Cross Hospital
</h1>
<p>
Here are my previous posts listing my experience while in hospital. I don’t have much to add to this but it gives, hopefully, a good and detailed overview of my whole experience while in hospital.

Before I do go into the nitty gritty of my post I want to preface this with the following caveats;
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I am 28 years old
<br>
</li>
<li>
I am Slim (roughly 20 on the bmi scale)
<br>
</li>
<li>
I am vegan (FWIW I have no idea if this affected recovery or anything but I am putting it here for the helpfulness of full disclosure)
<br>
</li>
<li>
I am very athletic and run between 2 &amp; 3 5k’s per week and yoga every day I am not running.
</li>
<li>
Not entirely related but… I went into this (and still kinda going into this) not looking at many pictures or posts Post Op; I didn’t want to get too many false expectations in that respect so if stuff I’m posting is like yes… obviously… well it isn’t obvious from my point of view as I went into this relatively blind.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
There are probably other relevant factors I am forgetting here but these are the major ones I can think of off the top of my head as I don’t want people to get this idea that my experience will be completely indicative of theirs if they are older or less active etc. This was my experience and I have been talking with other women from the same surgeon who all seem to have recovered slower than me, so take this with my caveats in mind.
</p>
<p>
First the big questions that I’m answering verbatim from

Surgery Wiki so they’re all at the top here for all the interesting things.

I’ve taken pictures from roughly 4 Angles every day and pre dilation pretty much every day since I came home from surgery until  These angles were legs closed then legs slightly open to allow for my phone to be landscape between them, then same but from a portrait angle then legs spread.
</p>
<p>
Also I’m going to blame how horrible Imgur is with albums for the fact that they are out of order, I’ve annotated every single one with a date and they should be roughly in the right order but, I am not taking even longer out of my day to painstakingly reorder them because Imgur can’t be bothered to have a nice way of doing so &lt;3.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the hair also, I was instructed by the surgery that I couldn’t shave until post follow up. The hair was horrible but I wasn’t about to go against surgery instructions through a reasonably important period of time.
</p>
<h2>
Surgery Details (Who? When? Why? Cost? Looks?)
</h2>
<p>
I had Surgery with Mr Roland Morley at Charing Cross Hospital on the 4th April 2019. This was standard Penile inversion. This was all with the NHS in the UK and therefore was free and the only cost was time (it took me 3 years from getting HRT to getting surgery, I wasn’t exactly rushing this so in all fairness I could have probably got surgery a year or so early.) I got referred last year in April and so it took a year from referral to appointment. I had my Pre-op appointment in January, my date in February via a phone call and then the surgery being the 4th April.
</p>
<p>
I chose Charing Cross Hospital because of the 3 (4?) places available on the NHS in the UK I liked the pairing of doctors best at Charing Cross Hospital (that was Miss Tina Rashid and Mr Roland Morley). Miss Rashid was on maternity leave at the time of my referral which is probably why it took so long, but I was offered an appointment with her but it was too short notice for me to take them up on it.
</p>
<p>
In all honestly before I set out I wasn’t really concerned about looks or depth or even sensation really. I just wanted my penis gone and a vagina in its place and whatever it ended up looking like it would be mine and I’d be happy with it. Having said that I’m really happy with how mine has turned out, still got a bit to go with the swelling but I love the heart shape of the labia.
</p>
<h2>
More Specific Details (Depth, Dilating, Sensation etc)
</h2>
<p>
So I’ve been using the soul source dilators. These weren’t provided to me on the NHS at Charing Cross but I did not like the Perspex ones they gave me. These corresponded to size P2 and 2 on the soul source scale but I decided to use Size 1 and 2 (the purple and blue ones) because I got them as a set. The regimen we were given was 5 minutes with the smaller dilator and 15-20 minutes with the bigger one. This was 3 times a day and dropping down to 2 times a day after 2 months and then after a further 6 months dropping it down to once a week over the remaining 4 months of the year. No change in size of the dilators were mentioned but I asked them and they said it would be ok to use bigger dilators if they gave me the all clear in the follow up.
</p>
<p>
Now my plan is to use the Size 3 and 4 Dilators (Green and Orange ones) over the next few months. I started using the size 3 dilator yesterday and all seemed perfectly fine on that front so I am going to substitute the Size 3 for the Size 2 for the next few months and then go up to Size 4 and then just use size 1 and 4 for the remainder.
</p>
<p>
I’ve only ever had trouble with getting the first dilator in, it’s always a little hard but once my 5 minutes with it are up getting the bigger dilators in is really easy. The nurses mentioned when I was in hospital that I must have a very strong pelvic floor muscle as I had sharp pain when first doing the dilating when the dilator hit the muscle (apparently?). I’ve never had pain beyond that just from it being sore at the end.
</p>
<p>
Depth Wise I am able to dilate to somewhere between the second last and last dot on the dilators. So presumably this means I am able to achieve a depth of around 5 inches, maybe a smidgen more. Before the Op they said they should achieve around 4 and a half inches based on my length, post op they told me they had achieved between 4 and a half to 5 so maybe I’m overestimating here but I am basing this solely on the fact that I can’t see the second to last dot when dilating and looking through my phone. In terms of circumference, I can get the size 3 soul source dilator in which I believe is 4.32” circumference. So presumably that is reasonably indicative of my girth so to speak.
</p>
<p>
Sensation wise; I achieved sensation on Day 9/10 Post-op, which consisted of a lot of jolts that my brain didn’t really know how to process at the time. From about Day 12 onwards this sensation just grew and grew to the point where actually exposing my vagina to the elements was causing me problems of feeling extreme arousal/sensitivity. Around this time I asked the nurse if I could do anything about this, regarding masturbation, but they told me a categorical no.
</p>
<p>
Still, I’m a weak-willed person and I had never felt anything like this before in my life. Sex was always very not interesting to me. Any masturbation I did do was simply for the orgasm to take some of the pain away from the rest of my life. When I came out it was only to prevent atrophy. This was just… a totally different and intense… need. I was essentially in heat a lot of the time. Beyond that I even had different levels of arousal, so while I was kinda very sensitive all the time, when I felt mentally turned on at the same time my clit would throb and I would feel wetness inside my vagina. (I’ll come back to the wetness later). I’d sort of describe it like the feeling of “getting an erection” without actually the penis existing, like instead of that pulsing it was pulsing my clit, and with that I felt like hot down there. I imagine this is normally how it feels for penile inversion but I’m trying to describe it as best I can.
</p>
<p>
I had my first mini Orgasm around 5 Weeks Post Op, I call it that because it wasn’t a full on one but it was definitely something at the time that my brain recognised as an orgasm, but it didn’t really serve to satiate anything, this was just from some light touching and it seemed to happen from nowhere (I wasn’t really trying to masturbate) and took me by surprise. Most of the time I was resisting but at this point I was kinda hiding a bit in my room for embarrassment of how turned on I felt, it was just so not me really.
</p>
<p>
9 Weeks Post Op and I actually had my first orgasm, and I can’t believe how… different… it felt than pre-op. I was physically shaking after and just a like a glow afterwards I don’t know… it was just so amazing. No it wasn’t like some earth shattering event but it was definitely much longer than anything I had pre-op, and much more satisfying. This was just using my hands, I tried using a vibrator (yes I know I am weak and went against nurses/doctors instructions to my shame) but that was so pleasurable I couldn’t hold it there for more than a few seconds without me screaming and I was staying with my mum and didn’t want her to know what I was doing.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to couple this with the subject of lubrication, I get extremely wet; now I have no idea what’s normal on this front because at the pre-op consult they told me I would not be self-lubricating at all, to the point where I was worried something was wrong down there because I was so wet. It’s an essential near constant wetness that gets more intense as I am aroused. Normally I wake up and my panties are soaked, otherwise during the day it just builds up. I was wearing sanitary towels for the first 8 or so weeks Post op, but yeah I can’t believe how messy it is as a girl and don’t really know if this is my new normal or it will settle down after a while.
</p>
<p>
I will say, I get wet enough not to require lubrication for the dilating, it’s not always wet enough for it, I essentially check before dilating, but when it is it slips in without too much hassle (no more than with the lube anyway). Again, I don’t know how normal this is since they told me I wouldn’t get any but for the time being I’m extremely satisfied with the idea of being self-lubricating down there.
</p>
<h2>
Complications??
</h2>
<p>
Lets start out with my biggest complication. The stitches in the fourchette broke down on my way home from the hospital. They told me this happens in 25% of cases but every girl I have spoken to has had this happen either on their journey home or a week or 2 after. I don’t think I really gave it justice in my previous post but I was actually in a lot of pain on my way home. I was just cuddling my toy and crying into it, then when I got home I was completely shattered and went straight to lie down. I looked at it then and thought it looked the same, but I was really tired and so obviously missed the fact that they had broken down.
</p>
<p>
In terms of other consequences, I ended up with a) Sloughing of the Vaginal lining and b) granulation on the right side of the labia (I think the selfie pictures are mirrored so it looks like the left). In terms of longer consequences my right side is still more swollen then my left and I imagine this is due to the granulation I had there. Not entirely sure if this is forever but I don’t really mind either way as it is relatively minor.
</p>
<p>
By sloughing I mean the vaginal lining was yellow/white in places, I was worried about this but it went away in time so I imagine this is part of the healing process. I had no idea what granulation looked like pre-op so I didn’t actually realise it was granulation until it went bright red, but apparently that’s the sign it is healing. I got pretty panicky about it when I first saw this and was sending plenty of pictures to the nurse hoping they would just say it was fine. In the pics you can see there was plenty of yellowy liquid going around the first 4 or 5 weeks, but I imagine this was the sutures breaking down mostly, and occasionally falling out.
</p>
<p>
This leads a bit into pain, so on discharge from hospital they gave me paracetamol and ibuprofen; essentially normal over the counter medication with normal doseage. I didn’t take any of these and was in absolutely no pain. Unlike many of the women I talked to who had surgery around the same time as I did, I also had incredibly little blood. Not even in the hospital. I was wearing sanitary towels for 8 weeks or so after coming home and didn’t get blood on any of them from what I can recall. The only blood I had was small little dots when I was dabbing myself down after peeing (cos it was messy). This was from the granulation area but it would stop after about a minute and was literally just tiny specks on toilet paper. By the time I got my camera out to try and inspect it, it would have stopped. I remember this happening distinctly on 2 separate occasions but it could have been a little more often but I didn’t tell.
</p>
<p>
Initially for say the first 3 weeks the dilators really smelt after finishing (sorry if this is a bit eww). It was one of those smells that wasn’t really nasty, simply pungent. I think this was just a normal part of the process as again this went away after week 4 or so.
</p>
<p>
In terms of “discomfort”, when I left hospital I was essentially walking like a cow-girl. This continued when I got home. I was able to sit down, but I’d have to be slouched and have my legs up, essentially like sitting up on the bed when in hospital. I could sit down normally, but the chair would have to be reasonably low (like my mum has these bar stools and unless they were really near the ground I couldn’t sit on them.)
</p>
<p>
Essentially the day I got my sensation back (Day 9/10) my discomfort just went. I couldn’t exactly sit on the high chairs but I could sit pretty normally on low chairs with no discomfort. About a week later that went as well and I felt as close to “normal” as I could in terms of walking about the house and sitting down. Whether these 2 events were related or not I can’t tell but regardless, I was essentially fully functioning in Week 3 (2 Weeks after coming home.)
</p>
<p>
The only other real complications I had was my hypersensitivity I mentioned in the previous section. Basically when I was having a shower or any time after dilating I would really want to spend a few minutes calming myself down due to the sensitivity I was feeling down there. When I was walking sometimes it would get too much and I’d just have to stop and try and relax for a bit, it’s really hard to describe but the sensitivity was very overwhelming. I presume this was a consequence of feeling like I did so quickly post op, I asked them about it in the follow up and they said they kinda expect that you’re more sensitive at this stage but it should go down, but it could stay like this forever so. Hopefully not.
</p>
<p>
Now I was living with my mum, and we work for the same company as accountants (she is my boss.) I was essentially working 10am to 5pm (with a dilating break in the middle) from Week 3 onwards. Not every day but most days. This was my choice as my work were the most amazing people ever and agreed to pay me in full for the entirety of my time off, pending a review if I had serious complications at the end of the recovery period. It was not on condition of me doing actual work, but I felt comfortable enough to do it. The only thing I found that initially it was mentally tiring. Especially anything after the middle of the day dilation. This has eased up particularly in the last 2 weeks.
</p>
<p>
One other thing I had a consequence was insane dryness on my hands. Now admittedly this was probably my own doing but since I was washing my dilators 3 times a day with soap and then washing my hands, and also having hot showers twice a day. They left my hands very dry. I made sure after that I was using an explicit moisturiser and they normalised again after a week of me treating them with skin food and a moisturiser. Just something to watch out for.
</p>
<h2>
A few extra things
</h2>
<p>
Around Week 6 Post Op I started doing real mobilisation and going to the shops and doing around 20 minutes to an hour of walking every day. Not serious lifting or exercise but just light mobilising. At first this was really exhausting again but it started to normalise fairly quickly. Also during this week I had a massage and manicure and facial and it was absolutely no problem sitting on my front for an extended period of time (this was still a little uncomfortable at week 3 if I was on my front for more than say 30 minutes while playing a game for instance.)
</p>
<p>
Week 7 Post Op I went for some long travelling down to my workplace to say hi to everyone (around a 2 hour trip on public transport). I was really fine until I had to dilate in the afternoon and then suddenly I felt a huge wave of exhaustion after, I was shattered (I got up at 4am that day and I was exhausted about 2pm after dilating). I basically fell asleep at work but after about an hour of napping I felt fine again. The next day I went for a meal with my boyfriend and we watched Aladdin in the cinema. I had absolutely no problems there in terms of sitting down for that extended period of time other than problems associated with my constant arousal which was exacerbated by my boyfriends presence. The day after we went shopping. At the end of this 3 day extravaganza I was incredibly exhausted, and spent the next 2 days just chilling out in my room.
</p>
<p>
Week 9 Post Op I went back into work again for the day, and this time felt completely fine the whole day. How I will feel going back in a couple of weeks I don’t know but the difference between 2 weeks in terms of my fatigue was huge and it just felt like a normal day at work.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully this covers everything, feel free to ask me anything on this, nothing is off limits as far as I am concerned.

Thank you for sharing. The NHS experience isn’t applicable to me living in Germany. But the stages of recovery are really interesting to me. I’m 2-3 weeks post op and I’ve just got home. I’m older than you by quite a bit and not at all fit so it will be interesting for me to track my progress.
