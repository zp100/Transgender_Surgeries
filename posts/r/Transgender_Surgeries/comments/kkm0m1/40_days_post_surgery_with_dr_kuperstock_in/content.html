you were already pretty... it is nice work though... stunning good looks :)
</p>
<p>
i&#39;m averse to face surgery in general... buuuuuut... yeah, if i were younger... sure... i&#39;d go to Kuperstock (i&#39;ll save the name in case i win the lottery ;) ... not for me, but an FFS &#34;scholarship&#34; fund ;) ).

I am pretty much like you.  Looking at the before face, i do not see much need to change anything, and the after face is also not that much different.

ooooohhhh... yes, i could see the change... perhaps cos i&#39;ve looked at a bunch of before and afters, including ones with subtle differences.  and sometimes they can make a real nice difference *even when* the before is real pretty already.
</p>
<p>
it might be harder to see it as the lighting is so different in the two pictures and the hair style is different.  but the orbital/brow differences are impossible not to notice and the way that the brow area to dip to nose is ratio&#39;ed is different.  also nice sublte nose changes which are really nice.
</p>
<p>
she&#39;s making the same smile, but the effect is different which evidences various changes.
</p>
<p>
the lighting does mess up my efforts to comment on the chin area... cos of the lighting i&#39;m just not sure what i&#39;m seeing there.
</p>
<p>
but yeah... most FFS pictures, i&#39;ll think &#39;oh nice, but its not enough for me to want to go through it&#39;.  can&#39;t put a finger on it, but seeing this picture, i was like... yeah, think i&#39;d do that if i had the funds (although yeah... if i had the funds sponsoring younger trans women who need it would be more sensible... i&#39;m late 40s... kinda silly for me to get it done, i think...)

I think the different hair style is the most obvious change.  Yes, the nose looks a tad different, but not much better than before. I would not have done anything considering the risk, pain and cost involved for those minor changes. Because of my biology, I never had any real amounts of testosterone, and thus never had any facial changes.  But I am sure that one could find one or another parts of my face that could be change or made look better.  But natal women to who I would belong because of my biology, also have facial features that could be improved.  Hardly any of us were born with the facial features of a beauty queen.  I look pretty OK, but I have rather large ears that I dislike a lot.  My solution is a hair do that covers my ears.

Congrats, you look great!  My greatest fear is to get really depressed in the first 2-3 days after surgery...
