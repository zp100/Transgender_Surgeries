I am bit worried about this... Not only because of the cost, but because from what I know, laser doesn&#39;t really work on darker skin tones, right? Which is the case for me. I am not sure if it doesn&#39;t work AT ALL or if it just takes more sessions for it to work, though.
</p>
<p>
Electrolysis is... complicated. I don&#39;t know any places where I live that offer it, and I know it would be expensive as having to sell a kidney.
</p>
<p>
I have read a few unpleasing stories of people who had the surgery without having hair removal, so I think I am rightfully worried.
</p>
<p>
The extra question is regarding recovery time. Say I have my surgery in, I don&#39;t know, December. Would I have to stay home for three months or so before resuming my outside life (such as college and stuff)? Would I even be able to sit properly or would the pain be too much?
</p>
<p>
I am so excited and scared at the same time, lol. It is crazy. Just thinking about this makes my heart race and my eyes get all teary. Thanks.

I wonder, would it be possible to remove whatever hair is left after the pussy heals completely? I didn&#39;t know about the shaving of a layer of skin and that could make things simpler as it would at least reduce the amount of body hair in that area.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, I will look up again for places that could offer electrolysis around here.

I strongly advise you to get the hair out of the way beforehand - if you have trouble finding electrolysis now, imagine the trouble finding someone doing electrolysis inside your brand new vagina afterwards. ;) apart from that, I wish you all the best, it&#39;s perfectly okay to be scared and excited, SRS is a big (and hopefully positive) stepping stone :)

From what I’ve heard it’s near impossible to get rid of hair inside the vagina. Dr chettawut says to clear the perenium, which I plan on doing before I get the cosmetic minimal depth procedure. Body hair tends to go dormant for phases so it’s possible that the scraping doesn’t get those hairs. It’s best to do as much as you can. There is a place in Dallas called E-3000 and they can do full clearings in one setting but you’ll have to go probably three times. I had my face done there once and look forward to going back for an additional face and first time genital clearing

As far as I can tell all surgeons have some cases of hair remaining. Not having electrolysis is a risk, though it does appear to be relatively small.

I bet it is. The problem is not having any ways to afford it now, and no places near me that often electrolysis. Once I am at college, I will be in a bigger city, and I am sure there will be places where I could have the procedure. The thing is, I really wanted to have SRS before going to college (otherwise I would have to take a few months break from college, staying behind the other students who started alongside me). Plus, I am planning to have a trachea shave while I am at Chettawut&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
I am thankful for the advice. I will keep looking for an alternative. There must be one.

Ah, that area is particularly hairy for me, but shaving it is never too troublesome (except for the fact it grows again too freaking fast). Shaving the scrotum and around the penis is what I dread the most. I wonder if those are the parts where they shave a layer of skin, removing the follicles?
</p>
<p>
Thanks, girl.

Had my surgery June 19. So my experience is limited. Been home for a little over 2 weeks now. So take my advice for what it is.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get hair removal.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.chet-plasticsurgery.com/dr-chettawuts-recommendation-of-genital-hair-removal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chet-plasticsurgery.com/dr-chettawuts-recommendation-of-genital-hair-removal/
</a>

<p>
I havent had any noticeable hair growth inside my vagina. Plenty around the outer labia. But that&#39;s about it.
</p>
<p>
As for recovery, it varies greatly. YMMV.
</p>
<p>
For me, I was able to walk around pretty early. Even doing long walks to nearby shopping centres and exploring the city. But this got a lot harder after returning home.
</p>
<p>
Sitting has been getting progressively easier and less painful.
</p>
<p>
Both I think are tied to how consistently I dilate. So it&#39;s important to stay on top of that. Particularly when returning home.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been home 2 weeks now, and it&#39;s starting to feel normal now. I suggest making sure you have at least 2 weeks after returning home before returning to work. Helps to deal with jet lag and getting dilation back into routine.
</p>
<p>
I work a deskjob. And it&#39;s been alright so far, but hard to do it consistently. If I had a labourious job, it would have taken much longer to get back into it.
