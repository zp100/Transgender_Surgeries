I’m three months post PIV (University of Wisconsin/Gast). Dilating is going fine, but my clitoris is very high up under the hood and is pretty much always in aching pain. I’ve had little to no arousal post-op, but when I have it’s largely been painful. Anyone else/is this typical? Thoughts on when it will normalize?

I am about 6m out and also was with Gast. At 3m there is still a fair amount of swelling that can make things feel “tight” or like you are still tucking. This can very much be exacerbated with any arousal.  It often felt like a dull throbbing pain at its worst. At 3m, I was just starting to be orgasmic but it was not without consequences initially as after sessions it was a little tender. That has stopped and I things became increasing better with time.
</p>
<p>
Have you had the post op outpatient team look at it yet?  As someone else mentioned, it could be a stubborn stitch. I had one that was problematic at around that time that created some very crazy sensations. Luckily it fell out on its own.
</p>
<p>
You may also have some hypergranulation in that area. Super common. I had some around the urethra and entrance that while stubborn, is now resolved after a number of silver nitrate treatments.
</p>
<p>
I know you have heard what I am about to say, but I cant emphasize enough how much you are still very much healing. If it really bothers you a quick My Chart inquiry may help to alleviate your concerns or perhaps offer a solution or recommendation to f/u in their clinic.

This is super helpful, thank you! Haven’t connected with the team cause I don’t live in WI and I’m sick of traveling there so I’m just vibing for now I guess.

Yeah, I’m experiencing pretty much the same thing right now at 3 months post op.
</p>
<p>
One thing I discovered was a stitch that had not fully dissolved that was poking me just above my urethra and inner labia. Once I was able to actually see it I pulled it out and the relief was almost instantaneous.
</p>
<p>
I’m still tender around my clitoris but not as bad as it was before pulling that stitch out.

I’m sorry you’re also dealing with this! But glad to not be alone… Hmm, that’s interesting. Maybe I’ll try to see if there’s some stitches still. I can’t see my clit at all even when I try to pull up the hood so it all seems like a bit of a mystery.
