Reading this it sounds very muck like a bait-and-switch and that they have somewhat of a standard (conservative) recipe for everyone?
</p>
<p>
Having said that I think the results look very good. You still look like you but much more feminine. I don&#39;t read any male in the first 4 photos.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for the write up. This is really useful information and adds to the already long list of things I will be looking for when I&#39;m due.

I also agree that I think they did a good job, I was surprised by the reaction and tone of the post.
</p>
<p>
I think a lot of this comes down to a mismatch in expectations for what the surgeon(s), and I think this is especially true with facialteam, are able to and willing to do. I&#39;ve noticed that women who end up unhappy with facialteam will invariably point to the conservatism of their approach. This is a feature, not a problem. They are feminization specialists, not beautification.
</p>
<p>
I appreciated in my initial consultation them, having it explained by the spectrum of 100% masculine to 0% androgyny midpoint, to 100% feminine faces. Without aggressive beautification, a surgeon can only move maybe 40-50% along the trait spectrum. This means that if you begin with a more masculine face, you will only be able to go so far while still retaining &#39;your&#39; face, and not turning into the dreaded doll/dolphin face. Facialteam is not the team if you feel you need substantial aggressive work, however my past experience with women who have pursued this approach of beautification to solve dysphoria is that it is an endless rabbit hole and will never treat &#39;dysphoria&#39; (quoted because I hate the term, but is the objective of all medical procedures to alleviate gender incongruence) as well as investing even a fraction of that money on a long-term working partnership with an allied mental health professional.
</p>
<p>
The women I have encountered with the most aggressive work were truly unhappy, and always chasing their next revision :(.
</p>
<p>
If treating your dysphoria is dependent upon substantial beautification, facialteam is likely not your best choice and you&#39;re pretty much looking at Keojampa only. I never looked at Madirossian as I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of their beautification, and God forbid you risk a Bart visit.

I&#39;m sorry your results have been lackluster, and I can empathize. I know the feeling of getting a very conservative surgeon who barely changes your face at all. I look almost exactly the same as I did pre-surgery. I passed before surgery and really just wanted to relieve my facial dysphoria. My FFS did nothing for that, and I&#39;m currently trying to find a surgeon that I can afford to do a revision. Good luck to you. I really hope things get better and that you&#39;re able to find someone to revise your FFS

The hair transplants were really what turned me off from FT. I was like, &#34;really? I&#39;m not balding! You&#39;re going to do plugs in areas of my forehead where I&#39;ve never grown hair?!&#34; It just seemed like a big stretch. The other big thing was that it really wouldn&#39;t have been much of a savings for me, and is actually MORE expensive than what some US surgeons quoted me.

Strange. Only part of my head that was shaved was the strip they cut out of the back of my head. The hairs at the front of my hairline weren&#39;t ridiculously long but easy enough to brush away.

Yeah, I&#39;m not sure why they did this but it does seem pretty common with hair transplants. Possibly because the hair in that area was thin so they needed to see where they could implant the hair, whereas with areas of complete hair loss it&#39;s obvious where to implant?

No they are not. They are safe and don&#39;t botch people unlike butcher Bart Van de Ven who has lawsuits for botching people.

You sound like you have a personal vendetta with FT. I think if you are unsatisfied with their work on you you should just go to them and explain. They are more civil and never really abandon patients unless nothing can be done but then again they will tell you. If you want to go to Bart then just go ahead no need to slander FT. I&#39;m sure Bart would love the sound of your coin.
