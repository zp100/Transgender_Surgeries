Pics are
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/N0Pecmi">here</a>
. Things are settled down quite a bit, so I&#39;m only posting weekly pictures at this point.
</p>
<p>
Not a whole lot to say this time, other than that things are healing up well. The stitches are all healed, the sloughing tissue is gone, and things are looking a lot less Frankenstein-esque overall. I still have some granulation tissue that we&#39;re going to let heal on its own, and that swelling under my clit is still going strong...
</p>
<p>
But the good news is that I saw my surgeons last week for my 3 month followup, and there&#39;s nothing to really worry about. The swelling should go away eventually (up to a year), and Dr. Bluebond offered to reset my labia with a quick revision if they don&#39;t recover fully from the swelling.
</p>
<p>
Also, I&#39;m cleared for sex, yay! I&#39;m still a little nervous about penetration. I&#39;ve tried some toys, but even with a lot of lube there&#39;s quite a bit of chaffing / friction that feels uncomfortable after a while. My clit is getting more sensitive, but it takes a while to &#34;warm up&#34; -- it&#39;s not like it used to be, my old bits seemed ready to go whenever, but now sensation is there, but elusive. There&#39;s much more sensation than there was a month ago, and I expect it to keep improving with time.As always, questions are welcome!

Thank you for these updates, just found them, myself. I&#39;m very much considering this, too, I just have lots of hang ups with it turning out bad, not healing right, or being left with lack of feeling, I&#39;m glad things are turning out well for you!

Thank you! I think we all have those fears, it&#39;s definitely a difficult decision from a risk vs. reward perspective -- there are high stakes either way.

All I can say, is this Surgeon is doing really good work. Once the swelling has dissipated completely, this is some of the best work I&#39;ve seen coming out of the US. Other surgeons should take note of her technique including the use of the urethral mucosa AND the peritoneal tissue. That&#39;s a brilliant solution for lubrication.
</p>
<p>
This is one stage correct?

I agree, I&#39;m very happy with this team&#39;s work. The recovery has been very smooth and I&#39;m thrilled with the aesthetics of her technique.
</p>
<p>
It is a one stage, but she will do revisions. At my consultation I was told that simple revisions could be done at around a year, and would be covered by the original cost of the surgery. I may need one to fix my labia...I think all that early swelling popped a stitch between my labia and the swollen side is significantly less defined as a result. But it&#39;s easy to fix and I trust this team to make the experience as painless as possible.
</p>
<p>
But her initial stage creates the labia majora, labia minor, and clitoral hood already. They might need a touchup once everything settles, but there aren&#39;t any major parts missing after the initial surgery.

She does a sort of hybrid method that&#39;s basically inversion with peritoneal tissue at the deep end of the vaginal canal.

Does she use the urethral mucosa as well? And, do you self lubricate to a decent extent? Looks great, btw!

Urethral tissue is used to line the labia and that area stays appropriately moist. I haven&#39;t had any issues with vaginal dryness, but I&#39;m also still dilating twice each day, so that keeps things well lubicated, too, since I definitely need lube to dilate.

Hey! I’m at 4 weeks post and I have similar white/yellow tissue as you did at that point, did you find out what that is / if it’s something that resolves itself?

It&#39;s sloughing tissue, and should go away as the wound heals. I used an antibiotic ointment from my surgeon on it until it healed up, and it went away completely during the second month.
</p>
<p>
Google around and read up on how sloughing tissue fits into the healing process. Doing that helped me stop worrying about it :)

Thank you so much!! I was getting a little nervous there for a second. Was there any particular antibiotic ointment that they recommended?

They gave me a prescription for mupirocin ointment, but said over-the-counter neosporin or triple antibiotic ointment would work, too.

Could I ask if you were circumcised prior to the surgery? Trying to figure out how Bluebond handles circumcised partients.

Great pics. Congrats. Do you [or anyone] have similar view pics with pre-op? I’m curious as to exactly where vag will start in relation to where penis is now. Also been trying to find post op pic of girls standing and facing forward. If not it’s ok!

I don&#39;t have any pre-op pics, but the crease between my labia majora/minora is roughly where the base of my penis was. I added the most recent front view pics
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/4jgl73R.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>
. I don&#39;t like the asymmetry, but it&#39;ll get better one way or another lol.

I understand. I meant up and down not side to side. Is where it first dips in above ur clit where the base previously started?

Yes, obviously things are centered horizontally both before and after :P
</p>
<p>
To clarify, I meant to say that the top of the labia creases is about where the top of my penis was. The clit seems to be about where the middle of the shaft used to be.
