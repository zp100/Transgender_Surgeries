I’m just a little confused because it seems that the universal consensus is that he is subpar with his results at best with
<em>
very
</em>
few exceptions and butchering people’s one chance at life changing surgery at worst. Yet, I still see people posting about their recent surgery with him. Are they misinformed? Is it about affordability and accessibility? Or do they just not care and will take the risk anyway?

I mean Kamol is in Thailand. You can&#39;t really hold a doctor accountable abroad. It&#39;s hard enough to do here unfortunately.

I honestly don’t know. I think some people just don’t look online that much or don’t look beyond the advertising and website. Other people maybe just go for the cheapest option. I think we assume everybody frequents Reddit or other sites and must be hearing the bad stories, but that probably isn’t true. It’s possible some people just don’t hear about it until after the fact. I guarantee you that some of the positive reviews are definitely fake as well.

One of my best friends just went with the first doctor her insurance offered to cover. Doesn&#39;t even remember their name off the top of her head.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s beyond happy with her results, but also goddamn she&#39;s way braver than me!

I think the crowd that I at least personally &#39;hang out with&#39; or who&#39;s posts I read with the most attention is very much like me, which is... maybe a little hyper-vigilant about this whole thing to put it kindly?
</p>
<p>
like it&#39;s fully otherworldly to me, because I cannot deal with related anxieties and dreams in any other way than obsessing over my research and making sure I&#39;m only taking the very best of chances, but I know enough trans girls to know that this is my approach and definitely not a prescriptive one either. Just really wanting it go get done makes a lot of sense to me too!
</p>
<p>
I also suppose it doesn&#39;t help that Kamol is one of the very few affordable surgeons you&#39;ll find quite easily when you are looking for PPT/Sigmoid &amp; has comparably much better marketing that e.g. Theerapong. Also, if you ever hung out in certain Facebook groups, there&#39;s lots and lots of advertising - there&#39;s for example this one admin person from Kamol&#39;s hospital who posts essays under everyone&#39;s comments asking for info on PPT and even slipped into my DMs once. (and I didn&#39;t even comment, I just liked a comment!)
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t really have the most specific of points here, I&#39;m just saying the fact that a very specific group of trans people on this subreddit here is aware that the abuse people face from at Kamol&#39;s clinic is systemic, is far, far from that being common knowledge &amp; I can even imagine how you could browse this subreddit for hours without reading about it, given you don&#39;t know how to look in the right places.
</p>
<p>
We have seen good work by his clinic before, and for everyone who decides to go there, I hope that will be the case. I just really think every single one of us deserves so much better.

It’s true that any doctor can have complications. However, time and time again from this doctor we have seen patients complain about filthy and unsanitary conditions, poorly done surgeries, “PPT” that was really just penile inversion and lead to internal hair growth, horribly done breast implants, etc.  Now, again, you can find bad reviews of every doctor. But when you hear the same kind of stories about the same doctor over and over again from different people that forms a pattern, and when there is photographic evidence like we’ve seen with Kamol the writing is on the wall. It seems more than a little strange that as soon as anybody says anything bad about him all these people pop out of nowhere to rush to defend him. It’s clear he has a very powerful advertising team at work.
</p>
<p>
Would I go to him for anything? Absolutely not. Would I send anyone I cared about to him for anything? Absolutely not. I can’t stop anybody from going to him, but I’ve seen enough people badly hurt by the few genuinely terrible surgeons out there that I can at least warn people away from them.

I was pretty set on  going to Kamol because I live in Florida and my insurance won&#39;t cover it here, and Kamol does PPT. Can someone link me why I

go to him?

The reviews for surgeons are in the wiki. You can decide for yourself.

As someone who had out of country funding for SRS. I do not reccomend, the true results of his surgeries look nothing like the website references.
</p>
<p>
I have personally spoken to a former long time employee of Kamol Hospital. She had informed me that the hospital wasn’t following proper protocol, post operative aftercare, sanitation regulations.
</p>
<p>
Kamol Hospital is nothing but a PR scam. They claim to give free aesthetic revisions, aslong as you pay for accommodations and anesthesia. However this is not the case.
</p>
<p>
2 years of my life wasted on researching this hospital only to find out 3/100 Kamol patients were satisfied and had no botched complications.
</p>
<p>
Take what you will from this, but personally after the extensive research this hospital seems to only care about your money.
</p>
<p>
If you are not a big time celebrity or “Jessica Alves” You will not receive the result you expect. Money Talks, He doesn’t give a fuck about his OHIP patients. Stay away!

I’m due to go with him in September and have now spoke to a few girls who are happy. In a few years I’m going to be 70 and have a couple of health issues but I’m definitely using him . I’m never going to pass but just want to wake up every morning with nothing between my legs.   I know there are good and bad surgeons but willing to let him operate on me and will put my trust in him

Many people like ex employees collude against him. He is number one for surgery in numerous countries. They are JCI accredited which is the global accreditation system for hospitals. They are totally clean. Outside Reddit in English these reviews don’t exist in other languages. They are considered one of the best on other countries. It’s very sad what a few bitter ex employees can do.

What does this have to do with the surgery result in this post? Are you trying to create doubt that this outcome is ACCURATE?

There were so many good surgeons in Bangkok. Kamol is an incredibly poorly managed Hospital. They have a very hard time keeping employees and communication is horrifyingly bad. In my opinion I had my ppv there I would avoid it and wish I&#39;d never seen it. Back to Kamal is a decent surgeon, the consultations are very short question you&#39;re not answered and again it comes back to how bad communication is. His wife is the head administrator and she is one of the worst human being ever met. With all the good doctors in Thailand do your research do your homework and make a good decision

I am here at Kamol now.  I wish I took this board more seriously but I had already handed over my money to them when I saw it.  Everything people are saying about Kamol on this reddit forum is correct.  Do not come here!  DM if you want details.
</p>
<p>
If you want a great surgeon in Thailand, check out Dr. Nond...I&#39;ve done 3 surgeries with him.  He is a little slow to respond but he takes his craft super seriously, you can tell he really cares about his patients and the quality of his work.  He speaks English extremely well.  There are a bunch of BS reviews online from one psycho patient he had, so don&#39;t believe the BS.   Trust me, go to Dr. Nond!

I went to him and am extremely happy with my results srs and ba people don’t realize there’s good and bad with all surgeons it’s my personal belief that he was worth it for me. I hung out with a lot of trans girls in Thailand who all knew him by name and regarded him quiet highly

I had SRS , at Kamol , at the age of 70 , it was difficult to get surgery , I’m looking good down there I’ve seen first hand the same on trans a year on , and they like how it is , I have good sensation , feels great , I managed to get myself really fit to prep for op , that helped and was back at work and doing every thing comfortably 5 weeks after surgery !

Hopefully your surgery was one of the exceptions, as I only want the best for you and anyone else. I’m just really worried that people don’t know who he is as well as his reputation and take the risk. I changed my wording in the text, I don’t want to offend you at all.

Idk I’m the only girl whose posted results from him in the past couple days so it’s hard not to take this personally not saying it’s supposed to be but I feel like my results are good and anyone whose seen it in person hasn’t clocked me so idk people like acting like he butchers people but from my personal research there’s plenty of positive reviews on the web with the exception being Reddit

You’re not the only person who had surgery with him in this year so far, and the question has always been on my mind so I wanted to know the reason. When I first joined this Reddit, I was flooded with post about people regretting going to Kamol, even recently I still see them, so I figured no one goes to him anymore. Until recent post, I thought he was ‘exposed’ or something like that, but now I see that he still has somewhat of a good reputation to some people, or maybe not and they have no other way? Like I said, I’m really confused.

You know what...I think some patients are operated by Kamol, others from student surgeons(who may be bad or good). I prefer your result over some Bank result, but still I&#39;ve seen nightmares from Kamol clinic, and some average (not beautiful but not ugly) asymmetrical vjjs from Suporn/Bank.. I was fascinated by PPT technique but personally I&#39;d prefer Bank at this point.

I go there next month for mine and will update here most likely, and few friends of mine went there before me and the results seems pretty good so far, seen their results and it was good enough for me to relax on my decision. They have had no complications and seem very happy about it.

When it comes to Kamol, there’s always a chance that you will not like your results. You say you’ve seen your friends and that’s enough, but please search Kamol in the bar above and then make your decision. If you ask me, his license should be pulled. You’re taking a high risk going to him, so please be careful.

When it comes to all surgeons you mean. I am browsing here everyday and been searching about him like mad because I seen lot of bad about him. I made my own personal research talked to a lot of patients and seen how it is for real and not just based on this subreddit. It&#39;s option I have with my insurance and I am going to take it.
</p>
<p>
Also it is always the people that are unhappy that go and post about it, for good reasons ofc. But most I talked with that are happy didn&#39;t run to this reddit to glorify it, they just go on with their life...
</p>
<p>
Also for real this post is so pointless, you didn&#39;t do the surgery or planned to go with this surgeon nor talked with other patients. Everyone can just open a post bashing on some surgeon.

But it is so rare to see unhappy posts anywhere about any other Thai surgeons.  They are almost universally Kamol patients.  There&#39;s a reason for that.  And it&#39;s scary how the admin at his clinic harass those poor girls.

You have to use a web browser to view the wiki. Reddit apps are buggy and won’t show it to you because it’s too big.

Not sure, but you may also need to use a desktop browser.

Personally I strongly suggest staying away from Kamol. I was employee there, and although I think Dr Kamal is an excellent surgeon I&#39;m not sure that you&#39;re actually going to have him do your operation. The management at is terrible, customer service is non-existent, as is any kind of psychological support. I was very happy working as a social worker there helping the patients cope with the stress, but I was unceremoniously lied to and fired. Turns out I wasn&#39;t making the money but I was making sure everyone was safe and happy and had someone to talk to and hold their hand when they needed it. It&#39;s a greed fest and a Money grab and that&#39;s all. Do your research, look into the other surgeons and hospitals especially bumgarner. Thailand is a wonderful place to have your surgery and to start living your life and a safe environment. Unfortunately this hospital is not a safe environment

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be attacked, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll make comments about me taking a computer, but they owed me a lot of money which I was never going to see. That&#39;s the way they do business. Lots of stories lots of promises and then you get screwed.

And, all I can add here is that I need to remove PPT/PPV which turned out not to be PPV but penile inversion, and a little of membrane as a &#34;bonus&#34;. The scrotum goes to the end of the canal. So this is not what I paid for. This is as well not collapsed canal, it was never done correctly in first place, not large enough and entire scrotum is pulled hard to give it the length. In addition it is full of hair all the way from the entry to the end, all over the tube. This is some horrific PIV work not the famous PPV. My urinary system is damaged and needs to be repaired. Breast are the same horror story, so badly done that there is no other way but do all again.
</p>
<p>
Why people are happy with the results? Because they are doing reviews early days, when it is is all fresh. Complications actually do start few months after. You hardly see reviews like a year after then operations, etc. Why? Because people go back to them and ask for revisions, which we were told are free in case of problems. But then when you not there and ask for a repair they tell you that you need to pay for it. I have seen few people going angry then, going to social media, etc. Then abuse starts from the &#34;admin people&#34; and people pull out of it for a sake of good sleep. This is actually not isolated behavior and it is common for many clinics.
</p>
<p>
So this is why all of it is confusing. I personally do not care about money in this case, I am upset because I need to go through all the pain, operations and related problems with recovery. BA is an extreme pain, was horrific in my case, I am not looking forward to have this pain again. Money is just a commodity, my health is not. But thx to this hospital I need to go over this horror again.
