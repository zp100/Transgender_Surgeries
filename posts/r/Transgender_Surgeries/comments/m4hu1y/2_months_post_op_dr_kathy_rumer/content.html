If that is two months, she must be the Wolverine. These incisions are mature. They aren&#39;t two months post. Everything about that vulva is way past two months. Sorry, I don&#39;t think Kathy Rumer is that foolish to wave this image in front of this sub and expect people to be fooled. She would have used something that more accurately depicting healing at 8 weeks.
</p>
<p>
Bloody hell, It was only 4 weeks ago Barbie was complaining about pulling a stitch in her perineum. Now this masterpiece appears fully healed with mature scars. I don&#39;t think so.
</p>
<p>
Plus, I ask Miss Barbie about the details of her surgery length a couple weeks ago and she couldn&#39;t really pin it down. She eventually came up with three hours according to her Mom&#39;s stellar time keeping at the hospital and that was for both her vaginoplasty and BA. I was already suspicious, but no one has GRS and doesn&#39;t know how long their surgery took.
</p>
<p>
The pet name thing with the Huns, Luvs, Sweetie, my sisters, sissies... is just over the top. If anyone called me that Motherly bullshit in person, they&#39;d get an earful -- pronto. You might as well call me Babe and smack my ass.
</p>
<p>
It all wreaks of someone trying way too hard. But ya, gorgeous picture.

Emma I&#39;m sorry if my good results has affected you. My surgery was on January 12 you do the math since you know it all. As I mentioned previously I&#39;m speaking based on my experience. I did had wound dehiscence which is almost closed. Never did I complained  about pulling a stitch in my perineum. Instead I asked if it was normal to have so much pressure on your lower stitches while dilating because at some point you don&#39;t know what&#39;s normal and what&#39;s not on your recovery. One thing about Kathy Rumer is that she does start you with all 3 dilator that she provides. Purple, blue, and turquoise. ( She don&#39;t give the orange)
<br>
Instead of gradually going up on size she tells you to use all three sizes one after the other. As you could image the pressure that the turquoise dilator causes in such an early stage can be painful. I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t answer your question about how long my surgery took the truth is I never asked because I never cared. I was drugged up and the only thing I was worried about when I woke up from surgery was not to poop my pants because that&#39;s the urge I had to use the bathroom which they said it was the packing not me needing to know number 2. But yes based on my mom it took somewhere between 3 hours. I dont have to prove myself to you. I&#39;m simply sharing my experience. But like I said I&#39;m down to video chat since I&#39;m all of sudden so suspicious for having a  good result. I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m young and healthy and heal fast. You&#39;re the most negative person in this page and I don&#39;t blame you you been through a lot and dealt with many complications however that doesn&#39;t excuse you to be a jerk. If you have nothing good to say don&#39;t say anything at all miss Emma. Keep being miserable to yourself. I don&#39;t need to try to hard. The only one needing to try hard to be happy and positive with life is you. Blaming everyone for your complications.

I&#39;m sorry if I left you with the impression that I take your result personally. It has nothing to do with me or my experience, one way or another. I simply don&#39;t find your persona credible based on that image, your language, post history, and your inability to answer simple questions about your own experience. It has nothing to do with my anger, complications, or my happiness. I&#39;m just saying what several others are thinking. It all seems a little suspect. I&#39;m not being a jerk, I&#39;m applying my life experience and years at looking at images and post like yours, to let you know --it feels off.
</p>
<p>
You have nothing to prove to me at all, in fact, If I were you, I would post more images with different perspectives to make me look even more foolish. Let&#39;s face it, your result shine a much better light on Kathy Rumor results that many people would like to see. Especially for those individuals who end up with KR as their only choice for surgery. I would gladly apologize for my skepticism if you would post images that add consistency to your claims. That&#39;s all it would take.

Feel however you want to feel. Like I said I don&#39;t have to prove myself to you I&#39;m simply sharing my experience either you like it or not. It&#39;s not the first time I see you being a totally jerk under someone post for sharing their experience and expressing themselves. If you&#39;re miserable with your life just say that and seek for help. But don&#39;t take that anger on other. I did made another post with progress pictures and paperwork prove just to shut your mouth and anyone saying my review is fake. Ya just need to accept the fact that the same way there&#39;s bad reviews there&#39;s also good reviews. But again you&#39;re the reasons why anyone with a good experience chooses to keep it to themselves cause all you do is hate and talk shit. The only question I haven&#39;t been able to answer is how long it took wow! Like I said I didn&#39;t bother to ask.

No Barbie, you don&#39;t have to prove yourself to anyone. Thank you for posting more images of your Kathy Rumer experience. They look great and you should feel really good about your results.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve struck a nerve by not being convinced by your initial image. On the other hand, look at the outcome here. Instead of having one single image that left people suspicious, we now have an entire healing progression. You should have led with that series of pictures from the beginning, that would have been a much more impressive post.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not really sure who your talking about in rest of your tirade, But thank you for the updates. It helps round out the larger experience.

And btw she was my only choice besides going out of state and I&#39;m not saying I discredit anyone that was botched or had a bad experienced with her. I encourage anyone having her as a choice to do their research as they should with any other surgeon. I&#39;m simply sharing my personal experience while not discrediting anyone else&#39;s. I went to her knowingly of all her bad cases and her bad reputation. I follow my gut and went with her regardless and I&#39;m glad I did because even though I&#39;ve experienced some minor complications ( wound dehiscence and granulation tissue) it was taken care of. I&#39;m doing okay and I&#39;m overall happy with my results. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m doing anything wrong by sharing my experience. I&#39;m nowhere fully healed but each day I&#39;m feeling better about it. I made another post sharing my progress photos for anyone doubting my persona like you.

You should edit your post and add a link to your new post. That would be helpful.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, by my initial post on this thread, I&#39;m far from the only one that was left with a sketchy impression based on the single image you posted. We are bombarded with nonsense all the time by people who have agendas or just want to pretend. I&#39;m sorry you got caught in the crossfire, but you came back strong with a much better post that will end up being an excellent Kathy Rumer experience story.

Nice work.

It definitely does seem too healed to be only 2 months out.

Mine looked pretty well-healed at 2 months out. I had a ways to go in terms of actual healing, but the scars were well-developed and I didn&#39;t have any problems doing regular activities.

Being a nurse and now seeing her other post of her progression which puts it far more in perspective, I credit the drains she wore for this result.

Rumer is a butcher and will always be. Be smart and don&#39;t be fooled by bad surgeon&#39;s fake reviews and results from those who got lucky and avoided disaster by a milimeter. Even butcher Brown in the US had some happy patients who defended him in court. The modern butchers you have to avoid are Butcher Kathy Rumer, Butcher Bart Van de Ven, Butcher Zukowski etc.

Oh don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m happy for you but I would never support Rumer and others like her. The trans community needs to do better and stay away from these butchers and raise the standards for selecting surgeons for trans surgeries.

Today is my two months mark since I&#39;ve had SRS and BA with Dr. Rumer. So far I&#39;m really happy with my results and each day I&#39;m feeling and looking better. I honestly couldn&#39;t be happier now that I feel complete and I can&#39;t wait to be fully healed and live a normal life. I have full depth all 5 dots go in. Turquoise dilator causes a little discomfort but it&#39;s bearable. I have great sensation everywhere. The only &#34;complications&#34; I&#39;ve experienced so far are wound dehiscence which are almost closed and some granulation tissue that were treated. Overall had a good experience with Kathy Rumer and her team. If you ask me if I would recommend going to her my answer would be yes, based on my PERSONAL experience. As always do your research and follow your instincts. If you have any questions feel free to ask below.

Yeah but you have to understand that she has a remarkably bad record, and while it is your experience, it&#39;s overwhelmingly rare to have a positive experience with her.

I concur.....she’s definitely one of the lucky ones because the bad outweighs the good with Rumer

Or the people who have had negative experiences are just more likely to talk about them. Don&#39;t be  a jerk to people who are sharing their experiences honestly and openly.

Who’s being a jerk?? Calling a spade and spade is not an insult and Kathy Rumer is a notorious BUTCHER! This young lady clearly got a good result and believe me I’ve seen the butchery of Rumer and it’s NOTHING like this

Y&#39;all, let her have this without downvoting her just because the doctor has a bad reputation.  Don&#39;t punish your sibling just because the doctor happened to do a good job here and not with other patients.  Be happy for her, leave a note about the doctor&#39;s reputation like the person above me did, and then let the girl enjoy her body and her experience.
</p>
<p>
Like, damn, y&#39;all don&#39;t have to shit on her just because you&#39;re salty about a doctor

I think the &#34;eyebrows raised&#34; moment for me was this...

<blockquote>
<p>
ANY NEGATIVE OR HATE COMMENTS WILL BE DELETED THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE NOT YOURS!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
...moment in OP&#39;s post.
</p>
<p>
Like, she doesn&#39;t have any control over that?  OP
<em>
can&#39;t
</em>
delete posts that are negative or hateful.  Now, hateful comments
<em>
should
</em>
be deleted, but that is at the discretion of the moderators, not
<a href="/u/barbie1518">u/barbie1518</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Simply &#34;negative&#34; comments
<em>
should not
</em>
be deleted, because this particular surgeon has an abysmal record and should rightfully be criticized.

Good to know. Like I said this is MY post addressing MY experience. If you or anyone else has something negative to say, you&#39;re more than welcome to create your OWN post sharing YOUR experience. This is a POSITIVE post and negativity is not needed. Have a great day.

Thanks sis it never fails! However I&#39;ma keep doing me and praying for all my sister undergoing surgery with any surgeon of their choice. Like I said this is the exact reason why people who has a good experience with Rumer chooses not to share their experience because this is what they do. Hate and throw dirt instead of being happy for one another. Just sad.

Thats why I said always do your research first. Complications can happen with any doctor. It&#39;s not *overwhelmingly rare&#34; to have positive experiences with her. I know plenty of girls that have but most chooses not to share their positive experiences because of this reason. People attacking them for having something positive to say.

I likewise had a good experience with Dr. Rumer. I acknowledge that a lot of people haven&#39;t, though. It&#39;s made me feel anxious about sharing my experience (also the fact that I had surgery with her 9 years ago).

Thanks for sharing love. Yes I acknowledge it as well I went to her knowing all the negative about her and I&#39;m glad I did. I&#39;m grateful for my results and wanted to share it with others. I encourage people that had a good experience to share it so people know.

Thank you for all the positive comments! I appreciate every single one. I will be making updates on my journey. Feel free to ask any questions. Remember I&#39;m speaking base on my experience and nobody else&#39;s. Always do your research and go with your guts. I encourage anyone that had a positive experience to share it and don&#39;t feel intimidated by the hate and negativity. We all have different experiences and are not to be shamed for them. ❤️ Sending good vibes and positivity to everybody undergoing surgery or facing complications. I truly wish us all the best.

Glad you shared your personal experience..  I guess for those deciding they can take the experience of the girls who got botched by Rumer and the horror stories and they can take your good experience also and then make an educated decision.
</p>
<p>
Asses the risks, tradeoffs and then its up to the person..  Hopefully you can maintain your depth and in the event you need some revisions you can get Rumer to do it effectively.
