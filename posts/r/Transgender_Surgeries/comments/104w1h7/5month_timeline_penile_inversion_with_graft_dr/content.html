Out of interest, what made you choose PAI over Chetrawutt or Suporn?

A string of several detailed write-ups here with pictures showing
<em>
consistent
</em>
results among features (labia, clitoral hood, fourchette) across patients, and price. I had just had FFS in 2020 and paid all that out of pocket, my first big expense after undergrad. PAI were more than reasonably priced.

Price when I went was $9300 USD, not factoring plane ticket or hotel stay (and I got a trachea shave at the same time, separately $3000, which went very well). Minor costs for the mandatory psych letters beforehand, but otherwise inclusive for everything in the hospital including meals and recovery stay.

sorry to hijack an old thread, did you get all your psych letters in Thailand? I was planning on getting them where I live but its so difficult to schedule if that&#39;s an option I might schedule my bottom surgery first and work it out there

I got my letters in the USA but I also had to sit in for 5 minutes with two psychs at the hospital in Thailand. This was a routine ceremonial approval that PAI handled for me but that they won&#39;t operate without. I&#39;m not actually sure if they really cared about the letters from my home country.

It’s a legal requirement to have psych letters in Thailand, so they do care. 1 local, 1 foreign, or I guess 2 local. I don’t get why they want 3.

Actually, no. PAI procedure is 2 Thai letters (already in the surgery price). Other surgeons, such as Chettawut, for example, do require 1 thai letter and another 1 from your home country. Always ask what are the clinic&#39;s requirements so you don&#39;t waste time and money.

This is the law in question, so 2 is the legal requirement

<p>
In the event there is a predisposition for treatment by means of a sex change operation, the person receiving treatment must receive approval from at least two psychiatrists.
</p>

In the event the ailing person is a foreigner and has received approval from a foreign psychiatrist already, at least one Thai psychiatrist must assess and evaluate the person prior to the operation.

Yes, agreed. I was just pointing out that I already had one letter from my home country, another one from WIH  but still PAI Clinic insisted I needed a second thai letter and didn&#39;t even look at my home country&#39;s one. That&#39;s what I meant.

Your result is excellent, Dr. Sutin is an artist, I am planning to have my SRS with Dr. Sutin but with PPT or the scrotal graft technique (also with abdominal graft), I have a question: How did you decide which technique to have for your SRS?

I was initially against Penile Inversion, but ultimately seeing

aesthetically pleasing results from PI patients of PAI outweighed my preference one way or the other.

Dr. Sutin does do the PPT technique, but not with the PAI Clinic, he does it through Siam Transformative and the Interplast Clinic.

Internal swelling is still dissipating over time, and the look of it will probably continue to change once I move on to the larger dilators. In a perfect world I&#39;d like more uhh, winged (?) labia minora, and for the minora to connect to the clitoris as in natal vulvas (but I&#39;ve never seen that done in any surgical results). No plans currently, and I don&#39;t know if I want the risk/scars of more surgery.

The risks with a revision surgery are very minimal since only the appearance of the vulva is modified and in general it is only an ambulatory procedure.

About 5 3/4 inches. Initially I believed it was more, but as the external swelling went down the actual length of the dilator it covered decreased slightly.

Is this the advanced PI technique they do where it can be slightly self lubricating? Looks incredible nonetheless!

I&#39;m not sure what specifically you mean, but yes, I get plenty wet when aroused. I was expecting maybe a little bit of wetness during me-time based on previous people&#39;s accounts but it&#39;s actually a decent amount.

Sorry I meant is it the advance penile inversion technique (because in the normal PI technique you can’t self lubricate or get wet) or did you have a different technique? Thanks for replying!

I don&#39;t recall the doctor making a distinction between different PI techniques. Mine was described as Penile Inversion with scrotal skin graft.

Morphine drip during the first couple of days in-hospital, with the patient-controlled push-button increase. I opted not to use it, and coming off wasn&#39;t too bad. Honestly, although stiff, sore, and bloody, there wasn&#39;t too much pain until the nerves started rebuilding themselves. At that point I was back in the hotel by myself and started taking extra strength tylenol about every 4 hours. The sensation would dissipate, but return like clockwork after the 4 hours were up. I ended up kind of overdosing on tylenol after going over the daily recommended max and spent one night extra pukey.
</p>
<p>
From then on I just used two cold packs, switching them in/out of the freezer as they melted. After about 2 weeks I could get by without anything.

Not me if they give me a patient controlled drip for morphine it&#39;s gonna need refills. I am in pain all of the time because of back issues I would highly suggest learning how to Meditate it helps so much with pain. It actually shrinks the pain center in the brain.

The best reault i have ever seen!! 1)How much did it cost? 2) could you provide a scheme for electrolysis in your case? 3) do you self lubricate?

1) Price when I went was $9300 USD, not factoring plane ticket or hotel stay (and I got a trachea shave at the same time, which went well).
</p>
<p>
2)

Yeah during my first checkup after I had been moved back to the nearby hotel, the doctor and nurses explained the process and gauged depth, and I got the first two dilators there. I also got douching supplies which I used for a period. After that initial demonstration I was good to go it alone, but with a phone contact line to my clinic aide.

Few questions if you don&#39;t mind, as you got the best results I&#39;ve seen from sutin and it is my top one for Thailand at the moment
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Did you specifically ask to have the labia minora continue to surround the canal entrance? This is one of the most important things for me and from most pictures it isn&#39;t like that, so I was wondering if it is just something that needs to be asked...
</li>
<li>
Did you have a lot of skin to start with? Or not a lot? I&#39;m afraid that I don&#39;t have enough for results like yours
</li>
<li>
You said there was a graft used. Only from the scrotum or from somewhere else as well?
</li>
<li>
You mentioned self lubricanting when aroused. Is it only when aroused or all the time? And do you happen to know where it comes from (the graft, or something else...)?
</li>
<li>
How is sensation in labia and canal? And in general?
</li>
<li>
Is peeing ok?
</li>
<li>
What did you mean by wanting the labia to meet the clitoris hood? Did you talk about the labia majora? Because from the photos it looks like the minora do connect to it
</li>
</ol>
<p>
And again, amazing results!! The reason I&#39;m looking more into dr. sutin!
</p>
<p>
Edit: another thing, did they ask you to stop hrt before and after? So you know their policy with it (for pills/patches/blockers...)

<p>
This is something I had noticed among most recent PAI writeups with photos (but not all) that I had seen, and that finally convinced me to reach out to them. In consultation I think I requested that they give me larger labia minora, if possible, that extend to the fourchette. I don&#39;t fully recall though, it was a busy week for me.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
My starting equipment really wasn&#39;t that large (I&#39;d say similar to how it was when prepubescent), and I had been circumcised as well unfortunately. I didn&#39;t bother tucking with anything more than tight underwear.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yes, just the scrotum. Nothing taken from the arm or leg. It&#39;s just part of their standard inversion technique, which is unique to this region of the world AFAIK.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It&#39;s definitely plenty moist when not aroused, but when aroused the vaginal canal releases fluid whose consistency is similar to the fluid I produced pre-surgery. So I imagine it comes from the bulbourethral glands and whatever the prostate is turned into after feminization, via the urethra.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Sensation is great! No numbness, clitoral stimulation and vaginal stimulation feel very natural.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Peeing became fine after swelling dissipated. It&#39;s hard to tell from the angle of the pictures above, but I have a little nub of leftover tissue (possibly erectile tissue?) next to the urethra that, while it has grown smaller over time, still sticks out in an unappealing way. I might consider a small revision on that in the future.
</p>
</li>
<li>

<a href="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs11930-019-00193-z/MediaObjects/11930_2019_193_Fig1_HTML.png" rel="nofollow">As seen in this diagram</a>
, usually the labia minora meet at the top just underneath the clitoris, merging into it. Then the clitoral hood covers that, creating a ridge. If there&#39;s a specific name for that structure I don&#39;t recall it. But I haven&#39;t seen an surgical results that connect the labia minora to the clitoris in that way.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Yes, they asked me to stop HRT 2 weeks beforehand. I probably stopped E a week out and didn&#39;t stop spironolactone before surgery.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the compliments! The worst part of all this is how much raw
<em>
effort
</em>
it takes on your end, and you&#39;re not even doing the surgery. Painful and expensive months of electrolysis beforehand, months of slow recovery, and years of dilation after the fact. And that&#39;s assuming everything goes right and you don&#39;t want any revision.

Thanks for the detailed answer!
</p>
<p>
I see now what you are talking about with the labia and hood, I have never seen those results as well...
</p>
<p>
It is so amazing how they can make those results even when not having a lot of materials to work with!
</p>
<p>
It is comforting to know my smallish equipment could also work, I was also circumcised unfortunately...
</p>
<p>
I guess now I just need to get going with painful, expensive, and long electrolysis, and keep an eye on new results to see how consistent they are. I&#39;m most likely to go with them as of now
</p>
<p>
And again, thanks for posting and answering!

Of course! Firsthand accounts and direct Q&amp;A is the lifeblood of trans surgical education. This community of people is the reason I found results I&#39;m satisfied with.

For some reason I can&#39;t see your comment here, but I got a notification and managed to see it through your profile, or at least some of it so sorry if I missed parts of it
</p>
<p>
You said they didn&#39;t require photos... I&#39;m wondering how can you agree on expectations if they don&#39;t know what they are working me? Is the first time they see the area they will operate on the day of surgery? It kinda make me worry a bit that it wouldn&#39;t be possible to set expectations correctly...
</p>
<p>
And about the area for the canal, did they send you what areas should be hair free? So you know where to do electrolysis instead of just everywhere?
</p>
<p>
Sorry I&#39;m asking so many questions... I&#39;m just a little stressed
</p>
<p>
And if you prefer dms (as it seem like comments here just go missing from time to time) mine are open, but there is the upside here of helping others with similar questions...

I have a few more questions if that ok...
</p>
<p>
Do you know what skin was used to create the canal? (Basically where exactly should be hair free?)
</p>
<p>
And do you need to pay before setting up a date? The entire talking with them before (so figuring things out with them), is before any payment is done?
</p>
<p>
And how does it go? Only emails? And attaching photos of the area?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m more and more leaning for sutin and I&#39;m starting to get a little stressed out about it 😅

The penile shaft makes up most of the canal, with a portion of the scrotum being used for (IIRC) the back of the canal (hence the name of their technique).
</p>
<p>
I payed a deposit when I booked, in communication via email with their secretary/scheduling manager. They said I could pay the rest when I arrived, but I went ahead and payed everything before the trip. I had had a payment issue when I traveled for my FFS that took a lot of effort to work through, so I wanted to make sure I was 100% golden before the date for this surgery. For that larger portion of the payment I went into my bank in-person and had them make an international wire transfer.
</p>
<p>
Yes, mainly via email (and Whatsapp for quick communication once in Thailand). They actually didn&#39;t ask for photos of my area ahead of time.

For aesthetics, which I don&#39;t particularly desire, definitely Dr. Sutin. To deal with the aforementioned tissue nub, if it doesn&#39;t continue to dissipate more than it has, I think that&#39;s something my local hospital group could take care of.

Congratulations dear it looks wonderful and I&#39;m so jealous.  And jealousy leads to nit picking just like judging a car show so I&#39;m gonna have to knock a half point from timeliness pic#12 lol I&#39;m just playing with ya and it&#39;s personal preference here only and my favorite are from &lt;#11 all the way down.  On a note: my number one struggle with dysphoria my hole adult life has been with my body hair and finally at 55yo HRT and laser has rid that from my life.  You have a beautiful Va-j-j and I would be so grateful to have #12 and I can only keep my faith that my dream will come true and I can come close to your&#39;s. My Dr. Told me my body was ready and I personally have been ready but the lack of insurance is whose in charge of me right now. And I have no ideas how I&#39;m gonna pull it off I just got dreams. Thank so much for sharing 🙏

It took a while before I was up and running again. Probably 1.5 - 2 months.
</p>
<p>
I consulted in December for a date in July, but in retrospect I should have made contact with my nearest electrolysist
<em>
before
</em>
that and asked her opinion on the timeline after getting her to look at the area. As I mentioned I had initially gone to a much further away electro and I don&#39;t think they had nearly as much experience with trans patients as my local electro.

This is the best post-op vagina I&#39;ve ever seen. For me, the MOST important thing is labia minora covering all of the vagina. I mean (0) look. So your result is my goal and I will show him to construct this same vagina.

I don&#39;t need the labia minora so prominent, yours is also not prominent but it looks very natural. I want my clitoris to be covered by labia minora, too. I don&#39;t like prominent clitoris. Can he provide these for me? I am planning to get my surgery done by him next year.

You have a great result! May I ask if you self-lubricate/get wet when aroused?

hello, I&#39;m jumping on this thread to find out a little more. I&#39;m about 43 days post op with dr. sutin now and realized that he does more of an outie labia than an innie. I&#39;m wondering if yours did eventually become an innie after the swelling had all gone down? thanks for your help!

uuh, I have both labia minora and labia majora, if that&#39;s what you mean? I haven&#39;t seen many examples of neovulvas that I would really classify as an outie, if outie means having
<em>
prominent
</em>
labia minora?

yep you got it right, what I have now is the labia minora being prominent such that it is not covered by the labia majora so it &#34;protrudes&#34; out. I was told to wait 6 months for it to go down but I&#39;ve also seen other patients of dr. sutin saying that it never went down even after a year. so just wanted to ask how did yours go?

Well I went to PAI specifically
<em>
for
</em>
labia minora, among other reasons. Their minimization among neovulvas that I&#39;d seen was my biggest personal criticism of vaginoplasty results, because I think minora are a very appealing feature of natal vulvas. Mine are still intact after swelling and time but honestly I wouldn&#39;t mind a little more tbh. I&#39;ve been seriously considering looking into how labia stretching is done among cultures that do it traditionally.

Congrats! Thank you for sharing. I have been considering SRS with Dr. Sutin, and started electrolysis on Wednesday. I&#39;m concerned about internal hair growth because his hair removal diagram is quite small. Do you have any internal growth, or is it just by the opening? How thorough did you do hair removal? And how would you rate the aftercare you have received? Thanks!

I got some bad advice from my local gender clinic, and ended up commuting
<em>
two states over
</em>
regularly under the (false) belief that there wasn&#39;t a closer bottom electro provider. I only discovered that I had a very close local option about 2 months out from my surgery date. In total I got about 6 months of regular appointments in, but I absolutely should have done more.
</p>
<p>
And like you, I was concerned that their chart was too nonspecific. I instructed my electro providers to also remove hair from the scrotum and base of the shaft. As for growth after, there was a handful of hairs near the entrance, and a handful visible, but further inside. As far as I can tell/feel (and I&#39;ve spent
<em>
a lot
</em>
of time staring inside with a magnifying mirror/sticking my fingers in this thing), there are no hair roots deeper inside than what I can see. I&#39;m guessing the reason they don&#39;t include the scrotum and shaft in the diagram is because they have direct access to the underside of those tissues and can scrap the follicles, which they can&#39;t do closer to the vaginal opening/fourchette (that&#39;s a guess though). Luckily my electro provider has no scruples about getting in there, which I&#39;m eternally grateful for. Opt to do more than what&#39;s suggested, for as much time as possible, is what I&#39;m suggesting.
</p>
<p>
I was bedridden in the hospital for 6 days, with regular checkups for pain and bruising. I was chaperoned from the hospital to the hotel, and the hotel to my follow-ups. I actually only had two checkups afterward, once per week, but I was also healing well without too much bruising, and could take the catheter out on time. Their office has been very good about responding to any and all questions I&#39;ve had, and have even helped me collect documents to submit to insurance (like my insurance intends to pay a single cent, eh).

Hey sorry to revive this old thread, but can I ask how much of your scrotum you did? And do you have a sense where those hairs that were near the entrance came from? They are telling me not to worry about any area other than perineum, but I sort of wish I knew where each bit of tissue was going to end up.
</p>
<p>
I could have a date in four months from now and my perineum is currently clear, but am concerned about re-growth in the area and wondering if I ought to push it further out.

I&#39;m pretty certain it was regrowth of the perineum. Given the growth cycle of lower body hair I should have just waited more.

If you were doing it again, would you rather have waited and been sure of the hair removal than have it sooner?

Yeah I probably should have been more patient. Probably asked for a date a full year from when I first reached out to the surgeon&#39;s office at least.

Hi girl, could you do an update on how you&#39;ve been?

And I have two questions: How&#39;s sensitivity? Do you feel the need for a revision?
