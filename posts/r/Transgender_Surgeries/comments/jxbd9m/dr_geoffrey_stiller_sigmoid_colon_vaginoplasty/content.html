TL;DR - Whats the deal with Sigmoid Colon Vaginoplasty? Any first hand experiences? Asking for a stressed as heck trans girl.

Ok. So this will be like my third post on Reddit ever lol so bear with me.
</p>
<p>
I have the sigmoid colon technique for bottom surgery scheduled with Dr. Geoffrey Stiller in February and I’m lowkey freaking out about it.  I’ve been in touch with the patient coordinator (she’s awesome and so patient) and asked a bunch of questions to try to calm my nerves about the upcoming surgery. I’ve also done what researching I can not only about Dr. Stiller, but the technique itself which is what leads me to this post.
</p>
<p>
I have been able to find a handful of reviews associated with Dr. Stiller preforming gender affirming surgeries for trans women and only a few for bottom surgery with virtually none regarding the sigmoid technique. There is one gal in a FB surgery group who has had surgery with him, but she hasn’t received the second stage (which is the sigmoid part)
</p>
<p>
I should clarify that the surgery is done in two parts. First step is basically zero depth vaginoplasty and second step is the creation of the canal with the ascending colon.
</p>
<p>
It seems like any post that I’m able to track down in FB about the sigmoid technique is always divided. People say that there is a horrible smell, doesn’t look right, constant discharge of mucous, etc. Then there are the people who deny any of those claims and say the previous claims are just rumors. Which leaves me feeling very ill informed and unsure of what to believe as none of these people have actually had the surgery themselves.
</p>
<p>
There are several different reason why I find the sigmoid technique preferable to the inversion technique. I would prefer the PPV method, but Dr. Stiller doesn’t preform it at this time.  Mainly is the fact that I’m a broke ass trans girl and insurance is going to pay for everything. There is not as much dilation post surgery say for the first few months, there is self lubrication (which may or may not be excessive) and there also doesn’t have to be any electrolysis pre surgery since the canal is created through the ascending colon. Oh and he’s preforming surgery during the lockdown.
</p>
<p>
I’m terrified of the idea of having to wait years yet again to receive bottom surgery. Whether that be through surgeon availability or accumulating funds for surgery. I really really want this and don’t want to cancel based on I’ll informed fear.
</p>
<p>
So can anyone direct me to any posts containing personal experiences or provide any personal experiences they’ve had themselves? I know it’s kind of an invasive request, but I’m literally desperate for any information whatsoever. Horror stories or success stories, I just want to have an idea of whether or not I should cancel and wait for another opportunity.
</p>
<p>
Any and all information (please no speculation) is MUCH appreciated. If you read this post, thanks for taking the the time out of your day to invest in my own personal struggle. You da best. Hugs. ❤️

Holy cow, first off thank you so much for taking the time to share such a detailed account of your personal experience. That means so so much to me.
</p>
<p>
I’m glad that your results were very satisfying and more than enough to hold him and his technique in such high praise.  I do feel confident in trusting him as a person and his surgical practice from what I gathered during my consultation. I was more so dubious about the technique itself, but after reading this I feel so much better about things.  I’m so relieved to hear that the rumors are just that. I had a feeling that was the case.
</p>
<p>
I am a little concerned about the invasiveness about the second stage, but again it seems like I’ll be in good hands and it’s really comforting to know the lengths Dr. Stiller took to make sure you were taken care of.
</p>
<p>
I can’t tell you how stressed I’ve been about this and your experience really helped me sort out a lot of my fears about misinformation. I know each person is unique in terms of recovery and such, a first hand account like yours is so valuable and reaffirming.
</p>
<p>
So sincerely thank you so much. This made my day lol  ❤️❤️❤️

What about like intravaginal sensation with the colon segment vs inversion or inversion with peritoneal or scroll graft?

This is an excerpt from the email I received from the patient coordinator. I don’t really know anything outside of what she’s informed me. Hopefully going to find out more too.
</p>
<p>
“Sensation within the vaginal vault is similar to a cis female, and only about 26% of cis women are able to stimulate vaginally. The important thing to note is that if you are able to stimulate through the prostate then it will be in the same positioning as the female G spot, so you would be able to stimulate with the prostate vaginally in that case.”
