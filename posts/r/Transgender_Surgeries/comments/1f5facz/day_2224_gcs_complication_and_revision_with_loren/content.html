I had a bit of a blow out along the bottom of my vagina.  My skin was always tight there due to my &gt;35bmi and starting hrt in my teens.  So i had to go in for an appointment tuesday and had the repair surgery on thursday.  This is friday night and i should be going home tomorrow.  They used a cool skin substitute to seal me up they say it should be super strong now but depending on how it heals i may have to have another skin graft for cosmetics.

I had a pretty crazy situation where they decided not to give me a catheter during operation. Once i got to my hospital room i had to pee so they put me on a bed pan because i was on strict bed rest for the day. But i couldn&#39;t and that situation kept getting more dire.  They scanned my bladder with an ultrasound machine and it showed i had over 1000 ml in my bladder.  But my urethra was swollen shut!  It was pure torture.  I was screaming everytime my bladder spasmed and my nose started bleeding.  There were like a dozen people in my room at one point.  But dr schecter would only allow his team to cathaterize me. But they kept giving me drugs which did not help until a plastics dr got there.... The relief if the foley was amazing and i was instantly exhausted and really high lol. Within 30 seconds 1.75 L of urine had filled the foley bag.  But now i have to have the catheter for at least a week.  Small price to pay for the torture i went through though!

I’m so sorry this happened to you. I can’t fn believe they didn’t buy a catheter in you. For what it’s worth, your last pic looks great. Sending you lovely healing vibes

This should have NSFW tag surely? Graphic pics are normally blurred out until you click them
