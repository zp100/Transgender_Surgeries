I&#39;m getting FFS next month or so after waiting over 6 years from my NHS referral from Sandyford in Glasgow, the surgeon&#39;s name is Dr Moorthy Halsnad and I&#39;m going to be getting a brow reduction and chin and jaw surgery from him, I can&#39;t find any before/after pictures from FFS patients he&#39;s had and haven&#39;t met anyone who has had surgery with him, if anyone here has experience with him I&#39;d really really appreciate any details about how it went, if you&#39;re happy with the results etc, my DMs are open if you&#39;re not comfortable writing them in a public post. I&#39;ve just been pretty anxious about the upcoming surgery, and hearing about other people&#39;s experiences would really help, thank you.

Hey, so at the appointment I went to last month (which I believed to be my surgery date) he told me that he won&#39;t be doing any FFS surgeries until at least 2023 and that in the meantime everyone on the waiting list will have to undergo a psychological evaluation to ensure that &#34;the surgery is right for them&#34;, all of this was pretty upsetting to me considering that I was referred for the surgery over 6 years ago and still nothing, nonetheless when I get my surgery (hopefully next year) I&#39;ll make an update on this post or make a new post detailing how it went, sorry for not a very useful update, the whole thing is so frustrating tbh..

Ugh that is bleak I‚Äôm sorry. I had thought that the psych assessment was only for bottom surgery. My mental health crashed a few years ago and I moved from Ireland, where I hadn‚Äôt put myself on the surgery wait list yet but was about to, to glasgow. If I‚Äôd stayed in Ireland I could have got all my surgery done by now anywhere I wanted in Europe, so I feel your sadness about it.
</p>
<p>
You haven‚Äôt managed to hear any information about people who have actually had FFS from him have you ? I still find it strange that I can‚Äôt, and that botched trachea shave comment as the only information has definitely left me feeling anxious.

Everyone is getting a psychological assessment again, I said to the surgeon that I had already gone through multiple assessments in order to be referred to him for surgery, he then said that the psychologist I&#39;d be seeing is &#34;specialised in FFS&#34;, which sounds BS but meh, apparently it won&#39;t add any time on to the surgery date, but it&#39;s still stupid, no doubt they&#39;re placating to the transphobic lie that people get surgery on a whim and will later regret it I guess, which should already not be an issue considering all of the psychological assessments I&#39;ve already been through, god I hate how the NHS treats us, it&#39;s a joke

Wow that‚Äôs so depressing, especially considering you thought your surgery was so close. There‚Äôs no need for further assessment after a psychiatrist and specialist at sandyford have recommended referral, then a psychologist and surgeon at the hospital agreed to carry out the surgery, wtf, clearly an attempt to trim the waiting list - when in reality they should be focusing on hiring a second surgeon. I have my final face to face consultation with him in September so it‚Äôll be interesting to see what he says but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve given us the heads up on what to expect. Hopefully you keep us posted on your journey ‚ù§Ô∏è

Is this surgery on the NHS, i.e. free? Because its risky going with an unknown surgeon.

That‚Äôs a really bad review. You could come of if this with more problems than you started, as has happened to some people.

He laid out the risks a few months go and showed me my x-rays and told me that getting chin work done could leave me with permanent numbness in my lips, I asked him about the brow work needing done and he was very confident that I would be happy with that since it&#39;s apparently a lot more standard than chin work etc, I&#39;m not too worried honestly, my last appointment did put me at ease somewhat, and I&#39;ve been waiting over 6 years and am far too poor to afford any alternatives

Did you read the review?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Prior to the surgery, he stated that he had done it before and was pretty confident; he really put me at ease actually‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
After the surgery, my nurse informed me he would not be doing any post-surgery examination with me and they were a bit puzzled as to where he was...
</p>
<p>
I eventually got an appointment with Mr Halsnad where he admitted he had not performed a tracheal shave, he had just tried to shave some of the Adam&#39;s apple but did not know how to remove it due to inexperience. He was unable to provide any evidence he had performed the procedure before.
</p>
<p>
Please avoid this surgeon if you can.
</p>

Yeah thank you, I&#39;ve read it in the past when I was originally searching in the subreddit for people&#39;s experience for him. At the end of the day he&#39;s the only surgeon I can afford to see, I&#39;ve been on hrt for over 6 years and I need FFS for dysphoria relief, so I can&#39;t just say no.
