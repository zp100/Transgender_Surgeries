Hi everyone, it&#39;s been a while since my first post on pelvic plasty. I had my revision last May 2023, it has been 4 months after the silicone implant revision (replacing a pair of old soft silicone implants with a pair of solid ones). Sorry for not being able to write an update sooner - I&#39;ll share with you my experience as reliable as I could.
</p>
<p>
[You can refer to my current results
<a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuWvzrapeuhMkUd_A-Bf8aEqkgkz" rel="nofollow">here</a>
. And if you want to see the before and after surgery, please refer to my previous post.]
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m grateful that I don&#39;t have any pain right now and I can do almost everything that I usually do pre-surgery, with my new hips!
</p>
<p>
__
</p>
<p>
However, there are specific stretches/bending that do cause pain (again on the left hip implant area) but it is nothing serious as what it was before. So I must say that it&#39;s not perfect, but it also doesn&#39;t really matter :)
</p>
<p>
Also, 2 months after the revision in July 2023 I experienced big swelling and tightness on my left hip implant area. And they mentioned that it could be fluid retention, they said it&#39;s normal for patients who&#39;ve had revision. It took me 3 days for the swelling to go down with a few ice compression and NSAID as advised by William and Dr Won. (For anyone considering revision, please don&#39;t freak out - it&#39;s manageable.)
</p>
<p>
__
</p>
<p>
Now, if you&#39;ve read my previous post and wondering if I did have herniated disc... yes I did to my surprise. We did an MRI and Dr Won showed me the herniated disc.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, really, I doubt it at first because I thought they were treating me like a cash cow by recommending more surgeries and with Dr Won initially mentioned he&#39;d inject fillers post-op to smoothen out the hip dips, then to suddenly recommending changing my silicone implants on my next visit, and finally saying I also needed to have MRI scan + herniated disc surgery on top of revision surgery on the third visit D:: While, my local orthopedics said I didn&#39;t have herniated disc when I consulted before (though only through radiology, not MRI).
</p>
<p>
I remember the last visit to the hospital was stressful, because they didn&#39;t give me enough time to prepare for herniated disc surgery + implant revision surgery on the next day. I had to chat William several times to make sure that it&#39;s the best decision, and it will help get rid of the pain.
</p>
<p>
Now, what&#39;s even more unpleasant was when the lady doctor (
<em>
the one getting you to sign the papers, to do payment, and to take you for before/after photos
</em>
) quoted me
<strong>
twice
</strong>
the price for the revision surgery which I had
<strong>
already paid in full
</strong>
before visiting Seoul. Leading to my first ever experience having a &#34;patient-doctor pricing negotiation&#34;. So she had to confirm about it with William, to finally telling that &#34;William made a mistake but it&#39;s okay&#34; then added that the quote she gave me for herniated disc surgery is a &#34;special discount&#34; which probably kind of felt to make her look good...
</p>
<p>
When she left my patient room, she had to sigh &#34;Owhhh... SO DIFFICULT&#34; in Korean, quite loudly to the nurses.
</p>
<p>
(For your information, I did not ask them for any discounts at all - only a good certainty/confidence** that the surgeries will get rid of the pain I had. Added that they had me sign a paper with a term saying in between &#34;they are not liable/cannot guarantee for any outcome&#34; at the same time when I was talking with the mentioned lady doctor face-to-face if they CAN eliminate the pain. Plus, no one in their right mind is definitely ready when asked to do multiple surgeries almost immediately.)
</p>
<p>
So from my experience, as you can probably tell, when you want to ask anything, please ask William because he will discuss it with Dr Won directly. In my opinion, the lady doctor (forgot her name) does not have your best interest at heart. Beware.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, I have to mention the nurses were very nice. Most couldn&#39;t speak English (they would use Papago and show you their phone, you can do the same), while a few could speak English very well and were friendly. I probably felt more at ease after those surgeries, being alone in South Korea, thanks to them.
</p>
<p>
Talking about post-op herniated disc surgery, the pain I had was not gone. Slightly better, but it was still painful whenever I moved.
</p>
<p>
Then on the next day post-op silicone implant revision surgery, getting them replace the implants and close the incisions again was nerve-racking - a bit painful and uncomfortable on the areas. Good news was the pain I had before felt like it was almost gone at this time...
</p>
<p>
...And during my recovery in Seoul, the pain was gone in a week if I remember right (I could not really differentiate the fresh surgical pain and the previous pain I mentioned, but doing anything felt a lot more easier and comfortable.)
</p>
<p>
So from here, I can say that the procedure currently using the hard (solid) silicone implants does make a big difference. It&#39;s more &#34;permanent&#34; and seems more suitable for hip area especially when it is such an important area with lots of movement. They really do make an improvement.
</p>
<p>
__
</p>
<p>
I may be one of the unlucky ones that need such revision, and I hope you won&#39;t have to experience this problem since they&#39;ve changed to only using their new, customized solid silicone implants. You can opt for not having them but it&#39;s quite impossible when a pair of titanium implants are attached to make your hips wider in an instant - you need the silicone implants below to smoothen out the dips.
</p>
<p>
And please note that pelvic plasty comes with risk(s) just like any surgery. As mentioned above, there are certain movements that hurts me especially with stretching or bending a certain way (again, on the left silicone implant area). And I can&#39;t sit on the floor cross-legged due to what I believe is also
<em>
nerve pain
</em>
around inner left hip area. But comparing with butt implants or BBL, personally, I think pelvic plasty is the best solution.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 100% happy with the result now. I don&#39;t want to push you or anyone to have the surgery but if someone asks if I&#39;d do it knowing the pain I had to go through - I&#39;d definitely do it again. At least to &#34;pass&#34;, if not for cosmetic reason.
</p>
<p>
__
</p>
<p>
Also someone asked me if the titanium implants are detected by airport security - and the answer is &#34;yes&#34;. I confirmed this again from my last trip abroad two weeks ago, both airports detected my implants. I asked William about this but they are not sure why either. If you have any idea, I&#39;d love to know.
</p>
<p>
If you have any question, please feel free to ask.
</p>
<p>
â€‹
</p>
<p>
P.S. I have to thank Dr Won and William for the care they provide during the last visit - and I hope this post is helpful in helping you decide getting pelvic plasty in Yonsei Baro Chuk Hospital.
</p>
<p>
And let&#39;s hope there is always a good side to everything in life. Because thanks to having the herniated disc surgery, we found out I have scoliosis which is something to watch for in the future.

<p>
Good-to-have things to bring if you plan on having the surgery:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Plug adapter
</li>
<li>
Laptop (you will feel bored in the hospital, you can work or watch movies to pass time and stop focusing on pain/discomfort)
</li>
<li>
Protein shake (helps you recover)
</li>
<li>
KakaoTalk, Kakao T, Papago and Naver map apps (they use these in South Korea)
</li>
<li>
Micellar water &amp; cotton pads (to clean yellow stains on your body post surgery)
</li>
<li>
Consider bringing lighter/smaller luggage, don&#39;t lift heavy things post-surgery (unless you&#39;re visiting Seoul for other cosmetic procedures and requires longer stay)
</li>
</ul>

Thank you! XD

<p>
No I didn&#39;t get the filler. I think they&#39;ve ditched the idea of applying fillers. So I only got the new silicone implants (while the titanium implants fixed to the iliac crests stay the same).

Thank you for this!  I am only six months on HRT but already looking forward towards what I will be wanting to do.  Natural, passable curves worry me and I have wondered about this surgery since I first saw it was available and I appreciate your detailed write-ups!

Since i read that you get hard silicone put inside your hip area, can you still do certain excercise? Like squat or like spread your hips horizontally?

<p>
Yes, I have no problem squatting - but I can&#39;t do splits so I can&#39;t answer if I could spread my hips horizontally.

Hey, do you have any more before/after pics you wouldn&#39;t mind sharing? From the one &#34;before&#34; picture you have, it looks like an EXTREMELY dramatic change - from literally straight up and down to cis passing curves. But it&#39;s difficult to do an apples to apples comparison when the pants in the &#34;before&#34; picture kinda hide your hips...
</p>
<p>
Sorry for even asking but I&#39;m very seriously considering this surgery for myself and there are
<em>
so
</em>
few images of the outcomes for trans women that it&#39;s very hard to gauge whether it&#39;d be worth it for me. I do have a slight curve, and allegedly a WHR of 0.75, but my body looks SO boxy it&#39;s insane.

Hi, no worry - I uploaded another photo I took though it was taken with similar angle as the &#34;before&#34; photo I shared, just further. I don&#39;t have a full body photo prior to surgery (even now) with tight clothing  - wish I do take more pictures.
</p>
<p>
Before I had pelvic plasty, Dr Won mentioned how I also had curve but WHR was *outside of ideal/regular female range*. So at that time our priority was to get into an ideal and natural female size.
</p>
<p>
And yes, after the initial surgery it was really quite a dramatic change. But I really do prefer the ones after the revision (photos I shared in this post) and was also happy when Dr Won said the new hips look much more feminine. Him getting happy with his work makes me really happy too. His current technique with the solid implants are just way more superior imo.
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps you decide if pelvic plasty is worth it or not :)

Hi Starry Touch,
<br>
Unfortunately your photos from the post are not available anymore :(
</p>
<p>
Do you mind sharing them again, or maybe privately?
<br>
I would highly appreciate it,- would help a lot to make a decision.
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much :heart:

Iâ€™m looking into this surgery and curious what the change was.
