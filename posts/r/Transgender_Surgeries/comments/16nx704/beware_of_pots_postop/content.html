It will be in the next update.
</p>
<p>
Are you sure this is POTS and not something else? Who told you? Wikipedia makes it sounds like something longer term, and this kind of thing after SRS is only very temporary.

I see I wasn&#39;t clear: I already had this issue before, it&#39;s not temporary, I faint all the time. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s gotten more dangerous right now. I could mitigate it easier with my normal mobility and not being all cut and stitched up

We’re you diagnosed with POTS by a doctor prior to surgery?
</p>
<p>
Not spironolactone I assume?

As another user pointed out, I messed up the translation. Spanish is my native tongue. As far as I know my diagnosis is orthorstatic hypotension! Sorry can&#39;t change the title. Although it&#39;s a symptom of POTS and I should go get checked for it because I do have some others like shaking, palpitations, cold extremities, etc. No spiro, cyproterone. I did do spiro in the beginning but it made it worse + it didn&#39;t work that well. Obviously no AA anymore now!
</p>
<p>
This advice works for anyone who suffers from drops in blood pressure, tho.

Excuse my ignorance but what is POTS?  I do worry about my blood pressure and surgery.  I sometimes get this condition where my fingers lose the blood in them and go kinda numb if I get cold.   I’m pretty healthy nowadays I just made bad decisions when I was young.  Anyway I often wonder if that will cause problems with healing.

Postural Osthortatic Tachycardia Syndrome. It&#39;s when your pressure is naturally a bit down and when you get up your blood doesn&#39;t get to the head quickly enough so you might get dizzy, lose your vision for some seconds or outright faint. I&#39;m a big case and it happens basically every day once or twice cause I&#39;m dumb and don&#39;t take time to get up. You usually get some seconds of grace of your vision going black and can act quicky by bending down or if it&#39;s bad enough sit or lay down to avoid fainting. If it gets to the point of shaking uncontrollably you&#39;re most likely going down.
</p>
<p>
This specific incident of weakness turned out to be a fever tho. Advice still stands!

Thanks!   I don’t have that thankfully.   I think what I have is Raynaud&#39;s syndrome.   It’s gotten worse as I’ve aged.

What youre describing in this comment is orthostatic hypotension not POTS. POTS has the specific element of tachycardia (fast heart rate) that triggers the drop in blood pressure while OH is just blood being slow to get to the brain. POTS is much more rare than OH and also much more severe (OH doesn’t typically require any treatment). POTS tends to go along with an EDS diagnosis too.

I thought hipotensión ortostática was POTS in English. Sorry it&#39;s my second language so I might be getting some terms wrong. I do get tachychardia tho? And random palpitations, cold extremities, tremors, etc. Should go get checked.

Yes… very true. I passed out when I was allowed to stand up after 5 days (and I had two nurses next to me thanks God). And this happened despite the fact that I took a lot of time to even sit up. I know of a girl that fell in the bathroom and ended with a big cut in her face. It is very important to take it easy and to not rush.

I&#39;ve had so many issues with POTS-like symptoms post-op. Presyncope basically any time when I stand up, heart rate staying high after standing up, blood pooling in my hands and feet, orthostatic intolerance overall etc. I have fallen over once, and have been close to fainting numerous times in or after a shower.
</p>
<p>
My circulation has been weird overall. I feel very light-headed and dizzy while standing up, but lying down makes my head feel like it&#39;s gonna explode? Also, my arms going quickly numb and white in certain positions, usually with my shoulders back.
</p>
<p>
It has gotten better, but I have had to change a lot of things for it to improve. Understandably, a lot of this is likely due to all the psychological and physical stress while recovering.

I didn&#39;t know there&#39;s treatment. They can? The possible side effects look scary and I&#39;m already on a few medications, idk if that&#39;s a good idea.

I was on similar diet pills before my high BP issues.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d have a peach for lunch and steak and tomatoes fir dinner.
</p>
<p>
Never felt hungry. Weight melted away faster than an ice cream on a hot day.

Definitely a thought in the back of my head while I contemplate bottom surgery. Still working on getting my diagnosis for POTS right now. Recovering from FFS hasn’t been too bad with pots symptoms so far day 4 post op. I have my tilt table test in a week and a half.
