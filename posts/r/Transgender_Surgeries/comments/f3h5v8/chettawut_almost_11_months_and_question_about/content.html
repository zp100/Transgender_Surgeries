Hey there, I updated my album
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/IpQK7i0">here
</a>
with an (almost) 11 month pic. My depth is now 7 inches and recovery seems to be almost finished.
</p>
<p>
I also have a question about hair, I do intend to get laser because there is some hair (not too much thankfully) on the labia majora, close to the opening, which I don&#39;t really like. I have a close up of the depth the hair follicles get to in
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/vSPOFsB">here
</a>
(I&#39;m holding some hair strands with my fingers so you can see where they start from). However I&#39;m having a hard time with my family (that I economically depend from) since the hair removal doctor said it&#39;s perfectly normal to have hair at that depth and that I should bear with it (leading my family to say it&#39;s wasted money). Is that correct? A cis female friend told me that it looks wrong to her.

Yeah, I’m afab and those hairs are very normal! I have hair pretty much everywhere except for inside. But if you don’t like it, get it layered off! There’s nothing wrong with having a preference for your pubic hair.

Cis woman here -- placement of hair looks very normal. My labia majora is very hairy.

Yepppp this is so normal and annoying. That’s the hardest hair to shave, have cut myself doing so. Make sure if you do shave it to really shove off the other bits to the side to get that surface as flat as possible to minimize potential for cuts places you really don’t want cuts.

You&#39;re gonna have to do what every woman does, shave. Hair there is normal as can be. Consider yourself blessed.

I would say that hair is completely normal. I’m a trans man, and looks normal to me. I would only get laser if you really want to, since you have to live with it. However don’t worry about your friend saying it doesn’t look normal, because hair definitely is.

Cis Female lurker, don’t have hair there, but I also have very little body hair in general. I have also seen many women with hair there. If that hair is making you dysphoric or insecure, you should get laser surgery, if not, I see no reason to get it
