Ah, I remember the nurse saying that there was a day with two surgeries last week, one of them starting at like 4 am. I am probably your next door neighbour. My FFS was 11 days ago. Best of luck with recovery.

I had SRS 6 months ago at his previous location and then recently, brow bone countouring and brow lift. I am already happy with my nose etc - didn&#39;t want to change what doesn&#39;t bother me, regardless of whether they could be &#34;better&#34;.
</p>
<p>
It is a new hospital. The room I was in was quite modern - tons of closet space and outlets, and an in-room bathroom. I really don&#39;t know why they have so much closet when those who stay are only there for 3-4 nights at most. But they do. Also, most who stay there will have no use for the bathroom except for the few hours while they wait for surgery to start.
</p>
<p>
In short, the brow bone contouring and new location/shape/arch of the brows worked out well.
</p>
<p>
I am still under their care for a few days. Main thing I would say is ask lots of questions before and after.

I got the whole package for ffs minus fillers. The FFS has been a harder recovery than the SRS so far. The new facility is out of this world good. I love it and Chett has been amazing.

Holy cow, did you do both of them at the same time? I would think that you would be in so much more pain.

Waiiiitttt!! You got SRS AND FFS both at the same time? Jesus! Talk about being brave, damn!! Wishing you speedy recovery, was it PI? How was Dr. Chettawut, and his team? You hear such mixed experiences with him!

And do you mind sharing what were the procedures you had done on the face, and how long did it all took, how long were you under?

I had brow, chin, jaw and cheek contouring, neck, eye, face and brow lift, hair line advancement, rhinoplasty, septoplasty and upper lip brought up. He also pinned my ears at no charge and not on the quote which is nice.  Basically the only things he did not do was reshape my eyes or fillers. So far I am very happy!

I also had my SRS with Chettawut just few days before christmas. Had my packaging removed a week ago and everything has so far gone really well with the healing and dilation. If you feel like having company someday feel free to dm me. I am also open to answer for any questions.
</p>
<p>
Posting with throwaway account cause i usually only read here. Good luck with the recovery.

Chett‚Äôs cost was about 57,000 aud, 2000 flights, 3000 hotel, 1000 for insurance and covid tests. Plus money for food. 65000 aud would easily cover the cost I paid.

How was the process of setting everything up/communicating with his office? What made you decide on going to Chettawut? We‚Äôre the any requirements prior to surgery aside from the letters? Thanks, best wishes! Xo

The process was pretty straight forward, communication takes a bit more effort as Chett speaks perfect english and some of his nurses do too but some of the nurses only have basic english. The requirements were the typical stuff be on hormones for a year, living as gender, and a letter from a Thai psychiatrist which Chett‚Äôs office can organise for you. I ended up choosing Chett because he offered the most cis looking V (same as Supporn imo) and also did FFS. His wait time was not crazy and his prices were very fair.
