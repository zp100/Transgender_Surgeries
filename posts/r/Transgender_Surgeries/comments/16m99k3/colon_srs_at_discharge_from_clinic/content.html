So basically:
</p>
<p>
I had sigmoid colon vaginoplasty last Wednesday. It&#39;s now Monday and I&#39;m being discharged after I pee for the first time. Edit: I peed. Chose to stand in the shower because it goes everywhere. Will do this until it resolves.
</p>
<p>
We think I had a bad reaction to the antibiotics and that caused diarrhea so I&#39;m being sent home without antibiotics. No opioids either because we don&#39;t really do opioids in Argentina unless you&#39;re dying from pain which I&#39;m not.
</p>
<p>
Bowel and gas pain was bad for like two days then it got better as soon as the diarrhea kicked in.
</p>
<p>
I have a lot of depth. My dilators are 20+ cm long and according to my surgeon they fit all the way in and don&#39;t get to the end, when he tried at the OR. I can&#39;t get it all the way in tho, because of muscles resisting. I need to see a pelvic floor kinesiologist ASAP as to not lose any depth because with colon that&#39;s dangerous. He says it&#39;s really important to do that and get it all inside but didn&#39;t force it because that&#39;d be torture. He&#39;s really worried about it and got frustrated that I couldn&#39;t do it, seeing me again on Friday if it doesn&#39;t work out soon. If it does, next week. I&#39;ve been given lidocaine cream to dilate.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s really early to tell and it will get more swollen but I think it&#39;s looking good aesthetically. It&#39;s symmetric!
</p>
<p>
My clit is still very hidden but also VERY sensitive. Everything is very sensitive which is amazing news.
</p>
<p>
No diet restrictions but I&#39;ll try to keep it low residue because of the colon re-section. Don&#39;t want to upset my diarrhea. Edit: strike that. I just got my instructions in the mail. High fiber diet.
</p>
<p>
I have phantom testicle pain lol I guess it will go away
</p>
<p>
I paid nothing for the surgery, clinic stay, first consult, anything. Thanks to gender identity law in Argentina which passed in 2013 my prepaid medicine plan (OSDE 210) has to cover everything. I was operated on and stayed at IADT in the Recoleta neighborhood. I saw my doctor first in July and got my surgery date the next day, didn&#39;t see him again until before going into the OR. I think he also operates by public health but idk about the process. OSDE also covers Dr. Fidalgo in La Plata but I understand that he only does PI. I wanted colon because of the wetness + my gf is huge.
</p>
<p>
Will add anything that comes to mind soon to this comment! And will keep posting as there&#39;s not much either on colon or on Dr Belinky here.

Yes. Javier Belinky in Buenos Aires. Up until now my only complaint about him is shitty painkillers. Holy fuck does dilation hurt.

It sounds like you are receiving very good care and you look really good for a week post op.
</p>

Stick with it, follow your care plan and I&#39;m sure you will have an amazing result x

I know right? I&#39;m really positive about all of this. Dilation scares the shit out of me and I&#39;m procrastinating tho, which isn&#39;t good at all
