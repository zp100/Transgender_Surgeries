I just found that Ghent University Hospital in Belgium operates the most number of srs case in Europe and wondering why is it hard to see any reviews from there despite of it&#39;s fame ...? Is that the reason because it took almost 4 years for reservations or Is it because of cost?

Possibly a couple of reasons. There‚Äôs not a lot of posts from Europe as a whole. And after following this for so long I‚Äôm beginning to think that better surgeons get more results posted, and vice versa.

The reason of fewer srs post in Europe is because other nations shows the some what better results in your point of view? I wish i understood correctly..
</p>
<p>
What is Vice versa i am sorry

<p>
I suspect that may be the case.
</p>
<p>
Vice versa means the opposite is true, in this case worse surgeons have less results posted.

It is true that lack of reviews, in general, is not a good sign. Though wouldn&#39;t you agree that there are other platforms than Reddit - including in other languages than English around ? I have seen a lot of reviews on discords or other groups that never reached Reddit simply because it is not a common forum for many people in the EU / people prefer private groups / people prefer to share reviews in their native language.

I&#39;ve been looking at this stuff maybe 10 years now, so my thoughts are not just formed on what we see now. I&#39;ve not seen what&#39;s on discord, but its only existed 7 years. I&#39;ve looked on lots of non English European websites and forums.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a curious pattern in the UK and USA of local surgeons results vs the same people going to Thailand. Similarly with other European countries vs Thailand.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s some really good new surgeons in the USA recently, and people are posting lots of photos from them. There does seem to be a correlation there as well. Why so few photos from the old established names?

I would say that depending of the languages you speak and the social circles you are in you simply don&#39;t see part of the flow. I have seen plenty of results of French and German surgeons whose name don&#39;t or almost never appear here while having good results. People in the EU also tend to have public social insurances which is another factor.
</p>
<p>
It seems to me that, regarding srs specifically, the results of a limited number of western surgeons have now reached similar - though, still different - results to the one some of the most experienced Thai surgeons and those remain the most experienced currently. Regarding FFS, people in at least some EU states are not going abroad and rely on surgeons in their country. There are very reliable surgeons performing FFS in the EU, reimbursed by public social insurances in some states. You are not seeing much people talking about them here because this suh is mostly US focused and they have other habits.
</p>
<p>
You said &#34;I&#39;ve been looking at this stuff maybe 10 years now&#34; so I guess you&#39;ve seen the same thing that is observed in most countries, the number of people having access to the knowledge and medical support needed for a transition increased. But being a trans woman or man, or N.B, tend to be factor of socio-economic exclusion for many, affects success in the education system and so on. Trans people are not the wealthiest population group you may find. You have now a few decent options in the EU and USA, while going to Bangkok means paying quite a lot of money - without, in the vast majority of cases, any form of reimbursement - which most people simply can&#39;t afford.

You should really look in the wiki for yourself, but here&#39;s a couple of examples

Sorry may be i was confused in a word of &#34;wiki&#34; .  As it&#39;s considered to be a community where everyone can edit in their own tastes in my country
</p>
<p>
So i think we had misconception üòÇ
</p>
<p>
Is that link what you called wiki?

It is technically a wiki, but I&#39;m the only person who can edit it.
</p>
<p>
All reddit subs can have them, but most disable them.
