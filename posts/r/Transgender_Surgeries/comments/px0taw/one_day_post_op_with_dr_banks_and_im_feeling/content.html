Thank you!! Honestly recovery has been really easy so far. I was in a bit of pain yesterday and last night but much better today. Really it just hurt a lot to move my legs around until this morning but now I feel better moving around in bed some. The worst part I think is discomfort from the packing.
</p>
<p>
Dr Banks was great! In my consult with him he seemed very confident but also had plenty of time for my questions. He was very friendly in the OR too even though I was so freaked out lol

Congratulations!!! My surgery is scheduled in May with Bank, I&#39;m super excited!! I guess I&#39;ll just ask the standard why did you choose Dr. Bank, and what other surgeons were in consideration?

Mm honestly I picked the Suporn clinic pretty early and was just able to get a date with Dr. Banks. I was really drawn to the Suporn method for surgery but also considered some surgeons doing ppt. Honestly though I just really liked the reputation of the clinic and I wanted to just pick to stop worrying lol. Overall I feel very happy with my choice having not seen my results yet just from the doctors demeanor and from all the staff

How’s the experience been? I will be there next month. Besides quarantine have you had any issues because of restrictions? More importantly, my Partner is coming with me. How’s the room in the hospital? She’s wanting to stay there with me.

The hospital is awesome and people can definitely stay! The first night after surgery someone from the clinic will stay with you which is super helpful but they still let my mom stay as well. The room is much much bigger and nicer than a us hospital room if that’s what you’re used to.

Thank you for replying 😊 Well you sound quite an amazing woman to be dealing with the pain as well as you are after just one day!  That’s great dr banks had plenty of time to answer all your questions &amp; to have that quality about them to probably keep you calmer while going in. Can I ask you do you have support with you? My gf is waiting for dates to book towards the end of next year with dr Suporn or Dr Banks.  You must have so many emotions rolling around &amp; I find you incredible to come on here &amp; post a day later after surgery 😊. How long will your packing be on for &amp; before you’re able to move from your bed ?  Thank you for replying I really do appreciate it &amp; I wish you all the best for a speedy recovery , if boredom really takes it’s toll I would really be interested in chatting to you more lol.

Yeah I’m very grateful to have a lot of support with me. Both my mom and girlfriend are here which I think has made a big difference. I was so so nervous before and completely terrified when they rolled me into the OR but now that I’m done I just feel really relaxed and calm. I’m super excited to see everything after the bandages come off haha. I’ll be in the hospital for six more days and I’ll have my packing removed the day I leave. I’m allowed to start walking and shower on my fifth day post of though. Thank you for all the well wishes. Good luck to your girlfriend in booking dates ☺️

Can I ask what kind of difference it would be for you if you didn’t have the support of your loved ones there ? I ask as is highly likely that my gf will have to go by herself &amp; I’m dreading the idea of her being there on her own &amp; not being able to emotionally support her or anything else ….it makes me feel physically sick thinking about it, I don’t think anyone should be alone especially someone you love so much. Do you have other girls to chat too &amp; how is the language barrier….are you from the uk?

So I feel like it being the middle covid is a little different but I think it’s doable alone. I’ve met someone else through Reddit who’s a few days ahead of me so it’s been nice to talk to her but I guess there’s more of a community back at the hotel. I can imagine that without Covid there’s even more community. Full disclosure I think the lead up to surgery alone would have been hard but I think it would have been ok and I think recovery could only get easier. If you’ve read the Suporn 2015 document that might help assuage some fears since she went alone.

I have previously read all that you have documented &amp; I’ve gotta say it was the most helpful insight that I’ve ever read on someone’s personal experience of SRS at Dr suporns clinic , so thank you for taking the time to document all of what you did for other woman &amp; partners to be able to read , it was so helpful for my gf &amp; myself to read. How are you doing ? If the experience you had back then is now the same in 2021 then that takes some of the worry away !
</p>
<p>
BanksThrowaway you’ve been so helpful thank you. Enjoy being out of it for a while lol

In terms of things to worry about I can’t imagine anything has changed. Nothing of real importance really changed over the years I’ve visited, and I doubt it will in the next 10.
</p>
<p>
It’s unfortunate the social aspect won’t be the same during COVID as that’s the thing I’d miss the most, but it will be back as soon as more people can travel.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn’t mind updating it one day, but I’ve no idea when I’ll be in Thailand again. Maybe a holiday sometime.

Honestly everything I’ve heard from people here (and that people traveling with me have said) is that there is still very much community at the hotel. I personally have been chatting online with a girl a few doors down from me in the hospital and before surgery on Sunday I met someone’s mom just around the hospital so it’s nice we aren’t totally isolated and there is still some community. Definitely very grateful for that

Yeah so immediately after surgery I had a morphine pump and a button but apparently I pushed it too much so I ran out around midnight/1am lol oops. Honestly though the morphine wasn’t really doing it for me. Even then I was only about a 7-8. After that they gave my Dynastin (sp?) and I totally love that. It takes away the pain and doesn’t make me feel weird plus it lasts a while. Right now they have me on a combination of that drug in my iv and morphine tablets with meals. I had a bit of trouble with pain last night (night 2 post op) but they were happy to just keep giving me meds till I felt ok. They’ve also been giving me a sleeping my pill at night. As far as pooping they did an enema the night before surgery and have me on a low fiber diet so I’m just praying I won’t have anything happen before I’m up and moving lol. I had trouble sleeping the first night and probably got a few two hour sessions in but last night I had my pain managed in the evening and I was out like a light lol. I’d say in general my pain has ranged from a low four to a seven or eight but it’s never been close to things like electrolysis just a bad ache from the packing and a few areas of sharp pain.

Oh wow that&#39;s interesting to hear, how long before you are up and out of bed do you think? I&#39;m something of a pacer so I can&#39;t wait still for long periods of time lol
</p>
<p>
What time did you have surgery and how long did it take ?

Oh and my surgeon told me to expect about 6 hours for surgery but I think mine was just a little shorter. They wheeled me down to the or at about 8am.

Yeah you are definitely going to be ok. I was so crazy scared going into the or but that part was over so fast and then I’ve just been pretty much fine. A bit of pain here and there but easily treated

The surgery itself probably cost around $16,000USD not including travel costs and the hotel. Even though the hotel is cheap I would recommend a budget of around $20000usd

I have no plans to have a ppt revision. I liked that Dr. Banks method makes full use of the tissues present as well as using some peritoneal tissue from the tunica vagnalis so hopefully I’ll get some of those benefits as well! In general I really trust Dr Banks aesthetic and functional results even if they’re not ppt or ppv. For what it’s worth the clinic told me that they don’t believe there’s enough evidence to show a clear benefit either way except over tradition PI.

What was it like travelling to Thailand? Nerve-racking? I feel like that would be the LONGEST flight ever lol! .. did you pay with insurance or out of pocket? How much if so .. how long was the wait times? .. looks great &amp; best wishes for recovery!:)

Thanks for the well wishes! I’ve been lucky enough to travel before but the flight was still looooooong. Totally survivable though. I unfortunately had to pay out of pocket and surgery itself was roughly $16000. Fortunately the rest of Thailand is pretty cheap though not that it totally makes up for it! My wait was complicated. I scheduled my original date in March 2020 for December 2020 but that date was canceled due to COVID so I was able to reschedule for this week. I’m honestly not sure what their booking system is now though sorry!
