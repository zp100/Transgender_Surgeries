, I&#39;d talked about my experiences recovering in the hospital. This post picks up with the final day of hospitalization (when packing is removed and dilation begins) through the first week of recovery &#34;at home&#34; (or in an airbnb, in my case).

4/9, 5 Days Post Op
</h1>
<p>
Holy mother of god things move fast on the morning of discharge. The day before, Kevin stopped by to
<a href="https://imgur.com/8ekxNjw">give me my dilators</a>
and told me to make sure I took my painkiller at 6AM. He said it probably wouldn&#39;t help much with the packing removal pain, but I&#39;d want all the help I could get.
</p>
<p>
He was right.
</p>
<p>
Around 7AM Dr. Bluebond, Dr. Zhao, Kevin, and my shift nurse come into my room. I&#39;m sure we chatted for a minute, but I was so nervous I forgot all of it. Kevin tells me that he&#39;s going to remove the clear bandage, catheter, and wound vac. I brace for pain, but it comes off surprisingly easily and without pain. The only sensation I really remember was the cath coming out, and it wasn&#39;t pain, it just felt like I was urinating.
</p>
<p>
Kevin hands me my mirror so I can see it without the bandages. There is SO MUCH BLOOD, but I&#39;m happy with what I see. I don&#39;t think I showed it, I was still bracing for what&#39;s to come....but I can tell that it&#39;s going to be a good result.
</p>
<p>
Then Dr. Zhao walks up and tells me he&#39;s going to remove the inner packing. It takes him a minute to locate it, and he spends a few awkward seconds prodding around in my vagina. He finds it, and I&#39;m in for the biggest shock of the morning...
</p>
<p>
See, I knew that having packing removed was super sucky, but I thought the packing was just a single, solid dilator-type thingy that would just slide out. I was wrong. Instead, it&#39;s basically a long strip of gauze (or something similar) wadded up in there. He grabs the tail end of it, and pulls and pulls and pulls. I&#39;m dying. Everyone tells me I&#39;m surprisingly calm, but jebus I&#39;m freaking out inside. It feels like your guts getting pulled out, the roughness of the gauze rubbing on the raw skin, the scabs and clots breaking and rubbing, ahhhhh. I just remember wincing and repeating &#34;It hurts it hurts it hurts no no no it hurts&#34; over and over, squeezing my wife&#39;s hand so tightly I thought I would break it.
</p>
<p>
And then, about 4 perceived hours later (or 5 seconds, real time), it&#39;s over and I can relax. At least, until I look up and see Kevin standing over me, grinning, with that GIANT GREEN DILATOR covered in lube. He gives it to Zhao, and he spends another 5 seconds inserting it into the canal. And then, finally, I can rest.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s all over in about 5 minutes total, from when the docs come in until you&#39;re plugged up and they leave you with Kevin and the shift nurse. My wife took a picture for me:
<a href="https://imgur.com/GrclDon">it&#39;s pretty bloody</a>
already, and after about 15 minutes the dilator came out along with a toooooon more blood.
</p>
<p>
After taking a while to rest and pull myself together, I shower, and the nurse shows me how to douche. Yay, fun. They make me pee twice, and scan my bladder afterwards each time to make sure that I&#39;m able to drain my bladder sufficiently. The first time peeing took forever, and it was nerve wracking. If I couldn&#39;t, they&#39;d send me home with a catheter, and I really didn&#39;t want to have them reinsert a cath after the morning I&#39;d had. Eventually, though, everything came out ok.
</p>
<p>
After getting cleaned up, Kevin helps me
<a href="https://imgur.com/chGKY2H">dilate myself for the first time</a>
. Unlike when the surgeon did it, I take several minutes inserting the dilator and adjusting to it. It&#39;s not so bad, I think most of the canal is still waiting for sensation to come back -- which isn&#39;t a bad thing IMO at this point!
</p>
<p>
I get dressed and put my first pad on, which is a strangely validating thing to do. Eventually we get discharged, and use Curb to hail a handicap taxi so that I could have a reclining seat for the 20-30 minute drive to the airbnb. We settle in, I dilate twice more, and go to sleep.
</p>
<h1>
4/10, 6 Days Post Op
</h1>
<p>
This day felt
<em>
awful
</em>
. While I was in the hospital, I was on an antibiotic that made me nauseous, and while they gave me zofran to ease the nausea, I didn&#39;t have an appetite. I ended up not eating for about 36 hours, only eating once I got to the airbnb. I woke up with a pounding headache, chills, and lots of aches and pains and soreness all over. Stupid. Make sure you eat! I get some apple juice and chicken noodle soup (yay instacart!) and start feeling better over the next day or two. But yeah....EAT. Even if you don&#39;t want to. Eat.
</p>
<p>
Though I couldn&#39;t sit up and felt like I had the flu, I still manage to struggle through my dilations, douching, and cleaning for the day. I look
<a href="https://imgur.com/jF3vJrJ">more swollen and bruised</a>
than the day before, but I guess it makes sense after all of the taxi rides, dilations, washing, etc. I spent most of this day sleeping.
</p>
<h1>
4/11, 7 Days Post Op
</h1>
<p>
Still feeling pretty terrible, but the headache is starting to ease and my strength is coming back. Not much to say here, so I&#39;ll just point out what a frickin chore dilation is:
</p>
<p>
Each dilation takes 45-60 minutes total to spend 15 minutes actually dilating. Gather up supplies (lube, pads, dilators, wipes, etc), pre-dilation bathroom break and cleanup, getting comfy, inserting the dilator, waiting for the timer, wiping up initially, cleaning up the pads, washing the dilators, post-dilation bathroom break and cleanup.
</p>
<p>
This happens four times each day, at least 4 hours apart, with a douche and shower as well. My schedule seems to have settled on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
6:30 AM: First dilation.
</li>
<li>
11:00 AM: Shower + douche
</li>
<li>
12:00 PM Second dilation
</li>
<li>
4:30 PM Third dilation
</li>
<li>
9:00 PM Fourth dilation
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Plus I have to pee. A LOT. I guess having the new canal and so much swollen tissue has left little room for my bladder, so I have to go every couple of hours. I thought going off spiro meant less peeing! lol. Each time you pee, the entire surgical site gets flooded with urine (it just sorta dribbles around and goes all over), so there&#39;s a lot of wound cleaning each time.
</p>
<p>
Between all of the dilating and maintenance, this is an exhausting time and there&#39;s not much time left to live in between. Prepare yourself accordingly, netflix and podcasts help but only go so far...
</p>
<p>
I was worried about some dark tissue in my canal (turned out to be nothing), and texted a picture to Kevin. I had a chuckle afterwards, realizing that this was the closest I&#39;d ever come to sending a dick pic.
</p>
<p>
For today&#39;s picture, I finally managed to get a peek
<a href="https://imgur.com/e0yqNGF">in between my labia minora</a>
. I have no idea what&#39;s going on in there yet, it&#39;s just a sea of stitches and swollen tissue. I&#39;m so ready for this swelling and bruising to go away!
</p>
<h1>

<p>
More of the same, feeling less flu-like and just the more &#34;normal&#34; post-op pain from the bruising and swelling. Sitting up is difficult and my whole situation down there is so bruised and tender that I can&#39;t do much but recline in bed and maaaaybe play some Stardew Valley. I&#39;m still swollen, but my
<a href="https://imgur.com/Ef5Eljc">labia look much less bruised and angry today</a>
. Dilation has started to become painful while stretching the first few inches of the canal. Kevin warned me that this would happen, so I just take a deep breath, try to relax, and keep on gently pushing. It&#39;s all about lube and patience.

<p>
It&#39;s been a while, so here&#39;s a picture taken
<a href="https://imgur.com/DXYB9ax">mid-dilation</a>
. I&#39;m super happy with the depth I&#39;ve gotten, I was about 6&#34; before, and ended up with around 7&#34; of depth after the peritoneal grafting.
</p>
<h1>
4/15, 11 Days Post Op
</h1>
<p>
Right on schedule, post-op depression set in today. It was awful. My mood had been really great until this day, but the pain and the dilations and the cleaning all just started to feel crushing. I listened to some funny podcasts (&lt;3
<a href="https://www.themcelroy.family/mbmbam">MBMBAM</a>
), talked with my wife, chatted with some friends back home, and made it through. I think sometimes we just need to vent and bitch and moan to people who care to feel better.
</p>
<p>
The worst part was the pain from my inner labia. In
<a href="https://imgur.com/aWq5mt5">this picture</a>
, there&#39;s a little inflamed white spot to the left of my finger, just on the cusp of my labia minora. It HURT. Randomly, every 5s to 5 minutes, I&#39;d get sharp stabby pains coming from this site. I&#39;ve been flushing it with chlorhexadine solution and slathering it with bactroban, and it&#39;s doing better today, but I&#39;ll definitely be bringing this up on my next follow-up appointment.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the vulva is
<a href="https://imgur.com/PhxhpOo">starting to calm down</a>
. I finally figured out how to get an ice pack on there comfortably, and it seems to be helping. I&#39;ll have to keep doing daily that from now on.
</p>
<h1>
Wrap Up
</h1>
<p>
Today (4/16) was supposed to be my first followup appointment, but it got rescheduled for tomorrow. I&#39;ll try to make another post in a week, but it might be a tad late since I&#39;ll be making the trip back home and resettling in this time next week. As always, feel free to ask me anything in the comments and I&#39;ll do my best to answer!

RIGHT? Kevin told me I&#39;d start with green and I thought he was kidding -- right up until he was lubing it up for Dr. Zhao. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;ll make it easier, since there&#39;s only one size-up to deal with?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the encouragement!

Thank you so much for making these posts. I&#39;ll be having GCS with Bluebond-Langner in January and reading about your experience has really helped me start mentally preparing. Thank you and have a speedy recovery!

I&#39;m glad they&#39;ve helped! You&#39;ve picked a great team. They&#39;ll contact you at some point about a presurgery education course -- definitely go! It&#39;s a great opportunity to meet everyone and it really helps you prepare for the nitty gritty of what to expect from the surgery and recovery.

I&#39;ll probably have to skype in or something for the pre surgery education since I live halfway across the country. Definitely happy with all the good things I hear about the team though! Now I just need a lot more money...

Yup, it was me and my wife. We saved up about three months salary (mostly from cashing out vacation time), plus about $2500 for lodging and $1000 for food (we&#39;ve been getting a lot of take out!). We also had pet sitting to worry about back home.
</p>
<p>
Instacart (grocery delivery) and seamless (meal delivery) are indispensible during recovery in NYC, too! We didn&#39;t leave the airbnb for the first week and just had everything brought to us.

That sounds pretty aligned with what I&#39;ve got budgeted. Unfortunately my spouse doesn&#39;t have enough leave saved to stay with me the whole time. Thank you for the information!

I&#39;d really, really encourage you to find a way to have her or someone else you&#39;re very comfortable with stay with you. It&#39;s not just the lack of mobility that&#39;s the issue; the frequent dilations and wound care get extremely exhausting and completely takes over your life. It can get really depressing if you don&#39;t have someone with you to help lighten the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
At the very least, set up skype or something so you both can chat a lot.
</p>
<p>
Another thing to remember is that you&#39;ll need to get all of your luggage home, and you aren&#39;t supposed to lift more than 15 pounds for a couple of months after surgery -- be sure to arrange for someone to help you pack up and make it home!

Good! I&#39;m glad to hear that! I couldn&#39;t imagine being alone right now, it would be hard.
</p>
<p>
Oh! And another big thing to factor in down here is transportation. I&#39;m not super comfortable with the idea of Uber, but there&#39;s another app &#34;Curb&#34; that&#39;s like uber for licensed taxis, and you can use it to see what fares between places would be. You&#39;ll need to make at least 4 trips from the hospital to the airbnb/hotel -- for me it&#39;s about $25-$30 per trip by taxi, but figure out ahead of time which trips you&#39;ll need to make and how much you should bring with you. On the way home from the hospital after surgery, I hailed a handicap-accessible cab with Curb -- this was nice because the seats recline and there&#39;s plenty of room for all the stuff Kevin gives you on discharge day (pads, sheets, lube, dilators, wipes, cushion, etc).
</p>
<p>
As for the plane ride, yesterday I rode around in a taxi for about an hour, sat at a restaurant for another hour, spent another hour at my surgeon&#39;s office / pharmacy / etc. and was fine. Tired and a bit sore, but moving and sitting wasn&#39;t terrible. As long as you can have the cushion and can lean back a little, you should be ok. If I were you, I&#39;d save back a couple of the oxycodone they give you for that trip.

My consultation with her was in July 2018. The date was set about a week later to be in January 2020. I was initially offered a date about two months earlier, but I had to decline it due to being a college student still. From what I understand, 1.5 years is a typical wait for her now.

Hey OP, we&#39;re in the same boat. I&#39;m at 2 weeks as of tomorrow. We had to postpone the start of my dilating to yesterday because when they dilated me last Thursday, I started bleeding.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m proud of you. I know exactly how much this stuff hurts and how much work it is.
</p>
<p>
(I&#39;ve found that keeping the area iced regularly has been really helpful and has reduced a lot of the swelling. I saw you mention that, but I didn&#39;t see how often you do it. My surgeon recommended 5 times a day, but I do it pretty much any time I&#39;m horizontal.)

I&#39;m proud of you too -- this stuff really sucks and I can see why some people lose motivation and stop dilating, etc. It&#39;ll be worth it once it&#39;s all over.
</p>
<p>
I bleed quite a bit after my first dilation, but they said it was normal. I hope your bleeding turned out to be nothing serious.
</p>
<p>
Ice does help a lot, though the swelling is bad, it is slowly but surely going down. Dr. Bluebond aspirated one of my labia yesterday at my checkup to get some of the fluid out. Was not fun lol. I&#39;m starting to get a bit more mobility back every day and I&#39;m looking forward to things getting back to normal!

My dilation stopped bleeding for the most part after the second one.
</p>
<p>
I hope your recovery smooths out.

I was laughing when you were describing removing the packing. I tell people “I’m glad I’ve had that experience, but I hope I never have it again!”
</p>
<p>
Dilation gets better. It’s still a chore (3 months post), but the discomfort becomes more manageable and you learn how to position yourself to get more comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Be aware that you might also experience some nerve pain as everything down there begins to wake back up. For me it was at its worst between weeks 1 and 3, dropping off pretty quickly after that (though I occasionally have twinges).
</p>
<p>
So glad things are going well for you. If you can, have people visit - that helped me stave off post-op depression.  Hang in there.

It&#39;s funny, the first week-ish of dilating was painless, and now it&#39;s starting to hurt quite a bit while I insert the dilator (thankfully it stops once it&#39;s in). I guess it&#39;s some combination of the swelling and the nerves coming back online.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s great to hear that the nerve pain shouldn&#39;t last more than a week or so more, that matches up with what my team told me. I can&#39;t wait xD I&#39;m here with my wife and she&#39;s keeping me company -- I dunno how I&#39;d do this without her. Going through recovery alone would be unthinkable now that I&#39;ve had a taste of it...

Me too! It&#39;s probably the most annoying part of this at the moment, even just sitting is difficult with it.
</p>
<p>
I saw Dr. Bluebond yesterday and she assured me that it should get back to a symmetrical, unswollen appearance without a lot of excess skin, though it&#39;ll take a while.

Okay, it&#39;s good to hear it&#39;s not always going to look like that. It just is frustrating that it&#39;s not an overnight thing.

I had top surgery with Dr. Bluebond 6 months ago and it came out great. It&#39;s great that such a skilled surgeon is able to help both trans men and women

Battered and bruised but otherwise looking good.
</p>
<p>
You really shouldn&#39;t be spreading the lips so early on. There&#39;s a good chance you could tear something. You should also be careful with the ice packs, while they help for the initial swelling, they can also slow the healing process [citation needed]

Good points. I don&#39;t move anything around down there more than I have to, but there was some major irritation in there that I needed to check out. Otherwise I only spread the lips a tiny bit to put some ointment in. And icing does slow down the blood flow and reduce how quickly things heal, but short bursts throughout the day to treat the hematomas and other inflammation will still allow plenty of time for healing :)

I had a bunch of stitches in the 3rd week that made moving around very sore and uncomfortable, I could feel them all poking into me.
