holy nausea and cramping, batman! much of the last two days were spent navigating nausea. ive had surgeries before (ffs, orchi, ba) and after all of them ive gotten nauseous but not like this....
</p>
<p>
tips. dont eat the big food too fast. ease yourself into it. its also better to consistently graze than wait for mealtimes. have your visitor bring twice cooked rice, blueberries, saltines, banana, orange slices, and basic white bread. hospital ice is actually perfect for chewing on. also try to stay off narcotics
</p>
<p>
the nurses really take the whole &#34;as needed&#34; seriously. which means you have to be on top of them for supplementary stuff (the stuff thats not just pain meds). for me thats anti nausea medicine and gasx.
</p>
<p>
sleep as much as possible. also walk. i was able to walk four laps day 3 and it made a huge difference.
</p>
<p>
pooping is a big milestone. got there day 2, and has been relatively smooth sailing since. easens as you move a bit more.
</p>
<p>
day 3 is where i really felt a turn around in the evening. its the first night where i could really have slept the whole night through.
</p>
<p>
its day 4 now, and i got the woundvac off. its the first time i really felt emotions tbh. it didnt hurt really that much, just weird with cutting around the catheter. i did get a skin reaction to the outer packing tape, which made like three little blisters on my abdomen. they just sting rn. but its really nice having the outer packing and vac off.

Question about walking . . . Can you walk on your own, or the staff requires someone (hospital staff, or others &lt;wife, mother&gt;) to be with you?

Yeah same here on the adhesive rash. I had to get some hydrocortisone and benadryl when I left because the itching was making me even more uncomfortable than I already was. 13 days out now and it&#39;s mostly gone though
