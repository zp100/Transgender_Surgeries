No sadly. But the way I did it was a Google search then called or emailed each one. Then the ones I liked asked about results.  Looked for patients reviews.  Cost recovery etc. The more information  you have the better your chance of getting what you want. Here is the first one in Germany I saw when googling. Maybe start here then check them all out :)

The first week my nipples got sore and libido dropped. Second to third week were actual breastbuds and they just kept growing. The rest of the effects followed gradually like softer skin and hair, increased appetite, PMS etc.

I just take pills like you. 3 tablets of oestrogen a day and 1 tablet of spironolactone. I used to take cyproterone acetate but found it a bit too strong. My doctor also said it could lead to brain tumour or something so I switched. I started when I was 16-17 though so may be an age thing?
</p>
<p>
Also I gained weight cause my appetite increased and it helped with the filling out stage. I started with ethinyloestradiol and took it for years then switch to progynova or oestradiol hemihydrate.

Well 19 or under is the ideal age for HRT I think. Just give it time and see which ones work well for you. If your liver is fine and you&#39;re generally healthy then tablets are fine.

I don&#39;t know what the process is like where you are but if you can see a therapist privately then it will be faster. Some may also refer you to a GID psychologist for assessment if you haven&#39;t had sessions with one. But in general HRT is a long shot you have to take them for years before you fully see the benefits. After that it is just for maintenance and keeping yourself healthy especially after SRS.

<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
are reviews and I talked to someone who was with Schaff. She was happy with the outcome, I saw pictures ( she told me to keep them confidential ) and they look similar to Brassard. She had issues with pain after surgery and some bleedings though so it may be recommendable to make clear enough pain meds should be used. And bleeding during recovery can be a side effect of their method. They to my knowledge use urethral tissue to line the inside like lights in a tunnel. There seems to be another surgeon using his method too (not Morath .. a person said someone else is being trained to use his method too ) so it may be an idea to look it up. And someone from your place had private insurance and had surgery with Suporn in Thailand covered.
</p>
<p>
Concerning injections they are still produced in Slovakia. Its called neofolin there and a number of people ask for a private recipe and import it, they either send recipes to a pharmacy there or ask a local pharmacy to import it ( which might be more expensive, someone said three times the price). Prices can be looked up and they may be affordable even out of pocket.
<a href="http://fenwayhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/COM-1880-trans-health_injection-guide_small_v2.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
is a brochure by Fenway detailing the process. And if injections are not available, some people use
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MtFHRT/comments/b74vby/a_powerful_new_option_for_transgender_women/" rel="nofollow">this
</a>
method with gels or patches. It may be necessary to try it out though, uptake can be individual.

<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There may be reasons but they mostly may point to different meds. In the US and in the far east injections of HRT are common. And in Europe injections of insulin via subq are still in daily use. In the brochure by Fenway subq is also detailed, its exactly the same procedure as for insulin, with the same equipment.
</p>
<p>
In the last link of the previous post a method is mentioned that some people use with gels or patches. It can work similar to injections for some people but it may be necessary to try it out. With transdermal methods uptake can be very individual.
</p>
<p>
And in general many people use bioidentical estrogen pills sublingually. It can be more effective. Levels can rise fast this way and drop hours later so it may be recommendable to spread the daily dose throughout the day to keep levels more stable.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fefu33e8O-0" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
is a video with a number of detailed explanations.
</p>
<p>
And standard for bioidentical estrogen pills are 4-8 mg.
<a href="https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines/feminizing-hormone-therapy" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
is a standard that many endos use.
</p>
<p>
And with bioidentical estrogen pills many people have a higher metabolisation of estrone. Its a weak estrogen, which can make for increasingly weaker effects so having a test after a few months, and switching to another form of intake in case of higher levels may be recommendable. Its also explained in the video.
</p>
<p>
And if you are on Cypro as anti androgen, many people start with 25 mg for a few weeks and then go down to 12 and later 6 mg. After t has been brought down, usually after a few weeks, a quarter, which amounts to 12 mg, end eventually a quarter every second day may be enough. It has a half life of 40 hours.
</p>
<p>
And it can make for depressions and it can deplete B12, which can make for additional depressions so many people use a B12 supplement.

I dont like gels and patches. Its just such a weird feelingðŸ˜– and I know the insulin stuff I&#39;m a diabetic. But I dont trust meds which I need to import from other countries and especially not if I need to pay three times more what I cant afford. More or less I trust my endo so far. I will see how my dose with my pills works

As said standard are 4-8 mg.
</p>
<p>
And having a test of estrone after a few months would really be recommendable. Some people have over 20x more estrone than estradiol. In this case feminisation often additionally stops after a few months, or is strongly diminished. It is necessary to switch to another form of intake in case of higher levels.

Youâ€™ve only been on E two weeks, itâ€™s way too early for you to say. I didnâ€™t gain weight at all before HRT. I was a skinny string bean and could eat as much as I wanted and stay thin and slim enough to okay the xylophone on my ribs.
</p>
<p>
That changed after HRT. Give it time. Estrogen promotes weight gain.

Same for all of my family. Iâ€™m not even overweight but Iâ€™m the most shapely of my extended family.
</p>
<p>
All Iâ€™m saying is that you can throw your pre-E anecdotes and genetic theories at me all you want, but from my own experience and knowing the effects it can have... thereâ€™s no guarantee.

So well known surgeons in Germany are Schaff and/or Morath, Liedl, Hess, who have all newer/advanced methods than the normal penile inversion method for GRS.
</p>
<p>
And never consider going to Pottek. There are so much cases of surgeries, which have gone so wrong with him.
</p>
<p>
If you have Facebook join the &#34;Transgender Germany&#34; group there. Looooots of information.

Assume you meant to say Riechardt for Hamburg?
</p>
<p>
Hess in Essen as far as I remember was trained in Schaff&#39;s method too. Also I don&#39;t know where you got the information that Schaff is no longer operating alone? When he was working with Morath that may have been the case, but as of this year he has now split with them and as far as I know does the surgeries entirely alone.

That was the role he was supposed to go into when he was staying with Morath in MÃ¼nchen, but a professional quarrel has led to him operating now alone in MÃ¼nchen and Berlin. Had a consultation with him in February. I didn&#39;t actually ask whether he was operating, I suppose because it seemed so implicitly clear from the full context? But when I asked whether he was thinking of retiring he said he planned to continue operating for as long as he was able, aha

My breast started to change soon after I started HRT, but very slow.  They were really sensitive and saw a little change after 1 month.  3 years on HRT my breast are still small but have changed over those years.

It is slow for me and I would like bigger breast but I&#39;m ok with what I have.  I heard they do keep changing.  Maybe after my GCS they will change more.  I think they changed some after my orchiectomy.

My E levels are sky high and my endo Dr is trying to get it down.  I wished it worked like that where more would give you better results.  High E can cause more problems than it helps.  My T levels are so low because of the Orchi so I&#39;m off one med.

My breast had grown to an A cup in only a month, however my T level was only 89 when I started hrt at 54 years old. Plus basically all my life I had to take testosterone shots just to get it in male range when I was pretending to be a male. My Doctor thinks I may have an ovary or part of an ovary that never fully developed that kept my T levels low. Pretty much intersex I guess but who knows...

I have been on E for about a year and a half, and I am seeing modest growth. I am almost a strong B-cup... I am hoping for C. It happens, and it can happen fast or slow depending on your body. Unfortunately, I am in the States, so I know nothing about German surgeons. Good luck, sister!

Small breast buds after 2 weeks, definite buds by week 3.  Very mild tenderness from them until the third month, by which point I started wearing sports bras to hide the development and to protect my nipples which were

Growth slowed down a lot after 6 months and has just been gradual since then.  Iâ€™m now at a year and... almost 9 months?  Something like that.  Theyâ€™re still small, but I like them a lot :)

According to
<a href="/r/ABraThatFits" rel="nofollow">/r/ABraThatFits
</a>
calculator I have a B cup, but the problem is that B cups on trans women donâ€™t look like B cups on cis women (cup size is about volume, but trans women generally have larger chests than cis women so that volume is spread out over a larger area).  Personally Iâ€™m happy with smaller breasts, I just want

Don&#39;t know about srs docs, but i can tell you i really began to notice feeling changes after 1 month of hrt. The growing pains set in on month 2 though 8 probably. They don&#39;t hurt much anymore, almost 1 year on the 28th, ðŸ¥³ , but i have noticed that they are still getting bigger and more pronounced. Good luck girl!

My family has small breasts. I started noticing growth at 6 months.

Im not sure about doctors in Germany. Iâ€™ve heard of a few but donâ€™t know who the favorites are.

Ye I think so too. Pills are okay so far for me. And well I need docs who are covered from insurance cause it were to expensive to pay by myself. And IÂ´m sorry to hear that you cant get your surgery cause of this situation on the world.
