This helps immensely ‚ù§ I just want to firstly thank you so incredibly much for going in depth about your experience. It also helps knowing you&#39;re a patient of his that has actually undergone a revision, you&#39;ve honestly given me so much to consider.  To know you&#39;re happy with your results, and have consistent followup with him is huge for me!
</p>
<p>
His practice is about 5/6 hours currently from where I live as well (I live outside of Seattle so I related to you when you talked about the ease of travel) whereas my original surgeon is 3,000 miles away on the east coast and I&#39;m just not sure if I&#39;m comfortable risking my fiance and I&#39;s safety for my revision. His practice is definitely in an ideal location. Not to mention, actually getting into contact with his office has been so easy and they&#39;ve been so kind. I was also highly considering OHSU for a revision, but to hear about your original experience is making me a bit weary about reaching out to them now - I&#39;ve also read mixed reviews about OHSU both positive and negative, whereas the ones, albeit kind of few, I&#39;ve read about Stiller are moreso positive consistently.
</p>
<p>
What I need revision-wise definitely isn&#39;t the most complicated case, so knowing he could completely reconstruct your vagina is just again - filling me with a lot of hope to look forward to!  I&#39;m really, really glad to hear that your revision went well and you&#39;re happier! I have a virtual consultation with him on January 4th, so I&#39;m definitely going to discuss this all with him, but this experience is just really reassuring since it&#39;s kind of hard to find info on him. Thank you again!

I would so appreciate that! That would be really helpful to know because I&#39;ll have to sort this all out soon. With the way things are going with CoVid, and my personal life, he will most likely be who I end up going with but we will see!
</p>
<p>
Is it okay if I message you directly in the future?

O: That sounds rad! I would definitely love to check that place out. Since moving here, I haven&#39;t really been out to eastern WA/OR so sight seeing around Spokane honestly sounds nice tbh.
