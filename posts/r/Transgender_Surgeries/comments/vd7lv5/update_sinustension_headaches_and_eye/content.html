Update to my previous post
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/v76cdn/sinustension_headaches_and_eye_strainblurred">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/v76cdn/sinustension_headaches_and_eye_strainblurred</a>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m gonna just bullet point this so it&#39;s not a long boring essay:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I contacted surgeon who wanted me to get a CT to rule out sinusitis
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I went to my GP, who sent me to the emergency department last friday.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
After 14 hours, I was sent home with some painkillers and a report stating I had an infection in my sinuses.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I sent these details to the surgeon on Sunday. They replied on Monday with a letter for my GP recommending a course of combined antibiotics.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GP refused to do this, and instead want to see me first for their own assessment, and the earliest they were willing to see me is tomorrow (Thursday).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Symptoms have gotten worse, so I&#39;m hoping things get fixed tomorrow.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Wish me luck
</p>
<p>
Edit: spoke with my GP. They&#39;re writing the prescription. No explanation as to why I had to wait, only that the GP (one of many in the clinic) was not working the last couple of days.

Does one of your eyes see things higher than the other or is the blurred vision due to something else?
</p>
<p>
You might want to book an emergency appointment with an ophthalmologist.

Mild blurring and double vision in my right eye. It&#39;s very slight, but enough to make me worry. It&#39;s horizontal, so objects have a very very slight, almost like an extra outline around them in just that eye.
</p>
<p>
The emergency team think it&#39;s due to inflammation from the infection, because it was localised to the right side. They definitely didn&#39;t think it was serious enough to worry about yet.

That suggests there&#39;s probably some intraocular pressure occuring. It could be due to infection or a hematoma that might take time to be reabsorbed or is ongoing. Did you get your CT scans in the end?
