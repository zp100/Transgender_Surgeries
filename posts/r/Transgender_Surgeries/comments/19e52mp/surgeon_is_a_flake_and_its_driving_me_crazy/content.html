Hey, it&#39;s been a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
So, my wife&#39;s about six weeks post op. Overall, recovery seems...I think it&#39;s good? Most of the sores along the stitch lines are healing/fading into scars, although about a week ago there&#39;ve been some odd lumps popping up near her clit, one of which looks just like a skin tag, the other...It&#39;s about a third the size of her clit, and a sort of bruised purple.
</p>
<p>
People on this sub will (correctly!) respond to a lot of people&#39;s worries with &#34;We&#39;re not doctors, ask the surgeon!&#34; My issue is, this surgeon is a f&#39;ing FLAKE. He was scatterbrained with the pre-op and post-op care, forgot a lot of stuff, and didn&#39;t really give specific instructions on dilation, cleaning, healing, etc. Not only that, but the couple of times I&#39;ve asked my wife to give his office a call, they&#39;ll often say he&#39;ll call at the end of the day, only for him to call back a week or more later. And when he does call, his answer defaults to &#34;It&#39;s probably fine, these things happen&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I might be overly paranoid, but the laissez-faire attitude, and the fact that (based on previous experience) it&#39;ll probably take the guy a fortnight to call my wife back about the clit-lumps means I&#39;m worried that he&#39;s just going to shrug and say &#34;Eh, I dunno.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Has anyone else had these kinds of experiences with surgeons before? (Surgeon is Dr Opoku in Allentown/Philly, PA) Does anyone know of potential resources or alternatives for folks who don&#39;t have a ton of money?

Got any pics of the issue? It&#39;s a lot harder to help with only a written description. My clitoral prepuce was formed surgically and had a bunch of stitches in it. It looked bumpy to begin with and whilst not purple, that could absolutely be explained by bruising. That is what comes to mind, but I&#39;m concerned that it could be something else that would be clear (or at least clear that it isn&#39;t just suture bumps plus bruising) from a picture.
</p>
<p>
And yeah.. we aren&#39;t surgeons. We&#39;re providing guesses at best and you should take whatever we say with a pinch of salt but I totally understand the reassurance that people who&#39;ve been through the same surgery can provide.

I won’t say this and nor will a lot of others. If you could trust the surgeon completely they would all be the same and people wouldn’t spend so much time choosing between them. And we wouldn’t have surgeons who regularly botch patients.
</p>
<p>
But most people here are not doctors or surgeons (there’s a few) and you shouldn’t trust us either. Trust no one is my motto.
</p>
<p>
I’ve have actually had a doctor to tell me to ask other trans people on internet if anyone has any ideas because the doctor himself didn’t.

Unfortunately that’s not a surgeon I’ve ever heard of. People can be qualified to do the procedure, but not have the best bedside manner and if they aren’t available during follow-up, that’s not a good sign. In contrast, when I had an issue after mine my doctor drove an hour and a half and opened his office on a Saturday to put my catheter back in himself; this is why I recommend him so highly. I’m sure it will all work out, but I second the advice to get a second opinion or at least insist on her being seen promptly with any real concerns.

Um, she may want to visit a sexual health clinic.  This almost sounds like a symptom of an STD / STI ?
</p>
<p>
It certainly couldn’t hurt.

Yeah, the I&#39;m not a doctor thing.
</p>
<p>
I was told at my first follow-up that I had developed a hematoma. It&#39;s a bit more clinical than that, but a hematoma is basically a bruise. It&#39;s a completely normal part of the healing process, and I was told just to make sure to keep it padded while it healed.
</p>
<p>
I would definitely continue to follow up with the surgeon, but her primary care doctor or a gynecologist could certainly take a look if you&#39;re not getting a response from the surgeon.

The lumps are stitches under the skin. They will disappear over time.
