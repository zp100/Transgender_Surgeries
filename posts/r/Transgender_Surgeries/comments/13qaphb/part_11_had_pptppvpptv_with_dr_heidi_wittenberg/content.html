This post is a continuation of my experiences following a peritoneal pull-through vaginoplasty from Dr. Heidi Wittenberg, March 9th 2021.

Shortly after my last update my clit started turning right and staying that way despite my correcting it at every opportunity.  Basically, as soon as I parted my legs and put them back together, it would be sideways.  I tried massaging it on both sides for weeks and nothing made a difference.  So I elected to have it surgically corrected by cutting out a wedge beneath the left side that always sits higher than the right side in the hope that it would lay flat and therefore not get crushed sideways.  This was a minor enough surgery that they planned to put me in a milder sleep without full intubation and I could leave after an hour of observation.  Total cost was around $21k with a $2300 co-pay.
</p>
<p>
I had the surgery April 27th and other than waiting 4 hours to get started, it went well.  I was surprised at how little pain there was afterwards, only around 2/10 now and then and it would go away quickly if I stopped moving.  I was able to sleep on my side with 3 pillows between my knees which hurt a bit but went away quickly.  By the second day pain was down to 1/10 and after that it was rare.  I reduced to two pillows after a couple weeks and 1 at this point.

It basically still looks the same as in the last photo.  You can see two sutures hanging out at the top and bottom right.  They surprisingly don&#39;t hurt even when touched.  I began massaging it for 60 secs at the top and bottom around two weeks ago and most of the firmness has softened up, though I can still feel swelling towards the bottom.  The clit hasn&#39;t gone sideways since the surgery but the right edge does get caught slightly below a bit of flesh so I&#39;ve been pulling it fully out whenever I get the chance.  It kind of feels like the swelling/sutures are holding it down so it can&#39;t flip even if it wanted to but I don&#39;t know if that effect will last.
</p>
<p>
On 1-11 I tried to have sex for the first time and it didn&#39;t go well.  I&#39;d just driven for a couple hours which I think increased swelling and I&#39;d also felt tighter since I used the rough textured vwell dilator a few nights earlier so I could barely get in my usual dilator.  I knew I was too tight to take my partner but she (transgirl) was eager so I thought it would be okay to let her thrust between my labia.  She ended up thrusting fast and hard which worried me but it didn&#39;t hurt so I let it go on.  I paid careful attention and had her stop the moment I felt slight pain.
</p>
<p>
The next morning my canal felt sore and looked swollen in a photo.  Then we drove 7+ hours to an event which increased the pain and left significant dried blood on my panty liner.  We slept at a hotel and I woke up to find blood stains all over the sheets.  When I went pee, the water turned red from blood.  I washed my vag carefully with a spray bottle, put on a pad, and 10 mins later that pad had a big pool of fresh blood in it which really scared me. Washed again, new pad, still got bloody but looked more thin/pink. After that the discharge was clear and sticky.  I stayed in the hotel and had no significant pain or bleeding.
</p>
<p>
The next morning there was more blood but not nearly as much as the previous day.  I walked some and we drove home without more blood.  I reduced dilation to once every other day using just the blue dilator and by 1-18 there was a bulb of swelling/granulation visible at my canal entrance:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/a0ke3w69gp1b1.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ffac1d6c435c8d36458ab6ef95327de2ab200ce">https://preview.redd.it/a0ke3w69gp1b1.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ffac1d6c435c8d36458ab6ef95327de2ab200ce
</a>
</p>
<p>
I saw my gyn on 1-25.  She said the swollen lump near the entrance feels like scar tissue and should be massaged.  There&#39;s a line of red tissue from the lump into the canal that bleeds when touched but doesn&#39;t look like granulation but is likely where all the bleeding came from.  She decided not to treat it with silver nitrate.  So apparently I had been penetrated after all and I was mad at my partner for not realizing that and for not being gentle, but also depressed that I couldn&#39;t even tell she was in or that she was damaging me.
</p>
<p>
2-6: Gyn said the center of the tear along the bottom of the canal healed but there&#39;s a section near my entrance that formed a &#34;surprising&#34; amount of granulation that she needed to numb and then snip at about 8 times with her tool. The numbing needles hurt a bit but the snipping just squicked me and felt like tugs.  My original spot of granulation near apex of canal needed nitrate but not snipping.  The scar tissue/bump near the entrance was mostly gone thanks to my rubbing and she        was impressed by that.
</p>
<p>
2-20: Gyn says injury is almost fully healed.  It no longer bleeds when touched but she treated a redder spot with nitrate to help healing.  Granulation at apex has also disappeared.  I do feel like dilation has been a little less tight since the injury so maybe that&#39;s a silver lining to the injury.
</p>
<p>
Nothing changed too much at subsequent gyn visits but after 3-23 I had a series of her canceling for a family emergency or because of my clit surgery so I didn&#39;t see her again till 5-4 and she found no granulation to treat!  We decided to check again in a month.
</p>
<p>
I got the extra large Mystic dildo around 5-5 but they won&#39;t make the extra large with the firmest silicone so it ends up feeling too soft and hard to keep in or gauge depth.  Maybe I&#39;ll use it again once the previous size gets consistently near full depth.
</p>
<p>
I got a new boyfriend who I saw for the first time on 4-3.  The first time he penetrated me I was really afraid it would be the same as last time and so we didn&#39;t go for long.  Something about being so nervous made me mostly forget or not pay attention to how it felt.  But there was no pain and no soreness or bleeding so when we tried again the next night I was more confident.
</p>
<p>
I was on my back and raised my legs to him, putting them over his shoulders as I added a lot of lube. He rested at my entrance as I pressed him down gently with a knuckle to keep him aligned and he pushed into me fairly gently. I had finished dilating about 20 mins earlier but it didn&#39;t hurt much as he slipped in. He started to thrust and and it felt so amazing that it was actually working and not hurting and he was getting in so deep. I made uncontrollable sounds of pleasure and he pushed a little deeper, sometimes going too hard making me flinch, telling him to ease off. It was like never exactly pleasurable but it was amazing just to know I could do it and how right it felt to feel pinned and penetrated. I&#39;m not sure how long we went, maybe 5 or more minutes until he was getting more into it, pushing harder and he made one thrust that was a little too deep and hard which hurt, not badly but enough that it made me nervous and I said we should stop. But I was still so happy to have felt that and shared that with him.  Since that experience I&#39;ve been feeling a lot more happy and right about my vag.
</p>
<p>
Three weeks later, the night before I was to visit him again he broke up with me saying it was too painful to be so far apart and he didn&#39;t want to see me and go through the pain of my leaving again.  I was pretty angry and hurt but I got on a matchmaking site and was surprised to find a local guy I clicked with.  I got to sleep with him 5-21 but it didn&#39;t go as well as with the first guy.  He&#39;s significantly thicker, a bit thicker than my orange dilator and probably a bit thicker than an average male, so even after dilating I was too tight to fit him easily.  But I think the bigger issue is that he would get soft every time I tried to guide him into me.  We tried again the next morning and got his head in but he got soft and couldn&#39;t proceed.  On the plus side, we did anal twice so my anal dilation has worked wonders.
</p>
<p>
So that was pretty frustrating for both of us but I&#39;m hoping it will go better next time because we made the mistake of having him climax before he tried to enter me the first time so he had less arousal built up.  We still had a nice time together and I think the relationship will last.  I ordered a cock ring to see if that will help but it&#39;ll take a couple weeks to get here.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Part of why I&#39;m so tight during sex is that I dilate with my legs closed and things get much tighter with legs spread, so I tried holding the big dildo in with more pressure and spreading my legs slightly.  This stretches things and creates some discomfort but I hope that with time this will make me less tight.
