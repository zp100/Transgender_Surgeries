I’ve never heard of this doctor. Don’t go back to them for any more surgery or revisions. You are correct in that this does not look normal or up-to-date. The good news is that there appears to be a lot of tissue to work with. Please get second and third opinions elsewhere with well-known surgeons who have experience with modern techniques.

I strongly suggest that you stop reading for a moment, and call the hotline.

I am really sorry to hear that, and trust me, I know how you feel. I had “bad” surgery too and I know how heartbreaking it is and how much of an uphill battle it is to get it corrected. It CAN be corrected, though, and life does go on! Now, my bad surgery is just a bad memory and until I thought about it now, to be frank I had more or less forgotten about it. You can get there too, I just know it. Just please don’t give up. Please get help with a different doctor or talk to a friend or loved one if you are feeling really bad.

I agree with the other people that have faced this. There&#39;s a lot to work with here that should lend itself to a good revision in the right hands. I had two revisions before I found the right surgeon to fix my issues, but I was pleased after the third.

I feel your pain, and can see why you would be unhappy about it. I&#39;m in a similar position but waiting for my revision in a few months, can&#39;t climax either and my scars are horrific.
</p>
<p>
All I can say is try not to center your world around your genitals. Try and forget about it as much as possible and get on with your life. It&#39;s not easy and it sucks but some of us are just unfortunate. I&#39;m glad you have some happy pills to keep you going and hope somehow you can find a competent compassionate surgeon who can help.

I&#39;m so sorry it&#39;s like this. I wish it wasn&#39;t but meh.
</p>
<p>
Antidepressants are sort of helping me as are sleeping pills or Diazipam when I&#39;m really struggling. Maybe you can ask you doctor if they can help.
</p>
<p>
Honestly wishing you all the best x

I would cross-post in
<a href="/r/germantrans">/r/germantrans
</a>
and ask for suggestions of possible pathways to remedy this poor surgery outcome. e.g.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Writing up a detailed, several page letter for your Krankenkasse, that the result is absolutely not comparable to other national and international surgeons (attaching examples) and that the surgery outcome had a detrimental effect on your mental health, state of mind, to the point of suicidal ideation and social avoidance. Asking for approval for a 2nd revision surgery with a more reputable surgeon team
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/germantrans/comments/w54ryv/surgeon_recommendations/">like Dr. Jürgen Schaff and Dr. Susanne Morath. Or who ever you have in mind.
</a>
. When sending off the letter to the Krankenkasse, I would also cc the letter to your general practitioner, psychologist you had who wrote you your letters, and the original surgeon.
</li>
</ul>

this doesn’t seem like something that can’t be fixed. just find a really really good surgeon, and don’t settle for cheap ones with no reputation. this is ur genitals. this is ur body. find someone who’s actually worth the money you’ll spend on them. but i think it could def be fixed. it probably feels like the end of the world rn and that nothing can fix ur situation, but it’s really not. slap urself in the face and remind urself that this is still ur body and it’s still something u can fix with a good surgeon. it’s nothing to kys over.

It&#39;ll work out in the end! I guarantee it. You just have to take care of yourself until then to make sure you&#39;re around to see it. *hugs*
</p>
<p>
I know what drugs can do to someone. Trust me. I also know why people (almost always) use.  It&#39;s because it numbs the pain. For a while.  But actually it makes the pain worse, the longer it goes on, because now you&#39;re not just dealing with your problems, you&#39;re dealing with your problems while your brain chemistry is out of wack and shit is all types of fucked up.  I also have seen people come back from states you would not believe were acutely survivable.  So there is always hope, as long as there is breath. I know you know this already and I hope it can help somehow, as useless as mere words feel to me.
</p>
<p>
Please stay around and take care of yourself the best you can.  If you can&#39;t not use that day, use less.  If you are rattling for meth, smoke some weed (lower harm) and take a long shower with the lights off.  Just do what you have to do to survive, then to take small steps forward.

This might sound silly but are you dilating the right hole? I think the entrance is at the bottom instead of the hole you can see in pic which is urethra ?

Okay! Just making sure because I have read it happened before.

Idk why it would be so painful for you, maybe some numbing cream could help with dilating? I hope you can find a solution
