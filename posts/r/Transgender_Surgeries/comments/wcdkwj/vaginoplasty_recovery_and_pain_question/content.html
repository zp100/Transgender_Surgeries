Heyyyy
</p>
<p>
So I live with a condition called fibromyalgia, which means I have widespread chronic pain and fatigue 100% of the time. Typically surgery makes it a lot worse, and there is a risk of permanent pain specifically in a surgical site. I have been 100% sure of having bottom surgery until my fibro diagnosis. I can handle the pain in general and have meds etc. But honestly it is the mental decline that would come with a &#39;painful vagina&#39; that would destroy me. I just want this to work and not be another problem. To swap crippling dysphoria with chronic pain is.... gah. Not good.
</p>
<p>
So I was wondering if anyone has had the experience of bottom surgery recovery with fibromyalgia? Other chronic pain conditions too as there is overlap from a &#39;pathology&#39; perspective. I guess other major surgeries like FFS and BA too. I have had VFS and there is some lingering pain in my larynx, the ENT has confirmed that the result is healthy and functional, so likely an issue with my chronic pain and the body responding.
</p>
<p>
Does anyone think it is likely a Thai surgeon like Banks or Sanguan would reject me if I disclosed my condition?
</p>
<p>
Thank you all for your insight üôè‚ù§

You have hit the nail on the head! I am terrified of the dilation schedule including the pain and energy involved. It will be next to impossible to keep the depth. It is important for me because I&#39;d like to have penetrative sex, but if it does come to it, maybe zero depth is okay and anal will be my way around it. Having a vulva will still be pretty amazing. Right now I dont even have energy to do my daily voice practice, hygeine, and exercise. It is pretty rough. I feel stuck and a bit like my dream has been crushed, but not hopeless. It might be best to wait and see how my health manages FFS. Getting a type 3 forehead remodel done will be a good indicated of the type of pain management needed after major surgery. Hopefully it goes well. Ahah. Did you have FFS too, how was your fibro?

I don‚Äôt think Thailand has many options for strong pain meds and lots of them are not allowed outside of hospitals. That could be a problem.
</p>
<p>
Dr Banks technique is also known for a longer more difficult recovery.

Bryn Avery on YouTube is a trans non-binary person with fibromyalgia who had a vaginoplasty. They have a few videos up about their vaginoplasty that may be helpful. I have yet to watch them; they were just the first person I thought of that might have the info you&#39;re looking for.

Are you sure Bryn Avery has fibromyalgia? There&#39;s lot of video&#39;s with Cystic fibrosis in the titles.
