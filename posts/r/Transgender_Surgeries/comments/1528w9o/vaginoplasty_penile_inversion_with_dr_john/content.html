After a seven day stay in the hospital I was discharged after a successful first dilation, and the ability to pee with my new vagina once the catheter was removed.
</p>
<p>
I was discharged and back home by about lunchtime. My surgeonâ€™s protocol is to dilate three times a day for 20 minutes with the largest dilator. So once I returned home, it was about time for my second ever dilation. Iâ€™ll be very honest, and that I do have a high pain tolerance and did not experience much pain postoperatively. However, dilation is uncomfortable and painful at times, for myself. However, I have not missed a dilation or needed to stop.
</p>
<p>
I was able to continue being up and walking around, which I did every day. I noticed that if I was up and about too often that I would feel an intense pressure at my surgical site. This was relieved by lying flat for a period of about 30 minutes, and I would notice that the sensation of pressure would go away. Peeing was an interesting experience as I was instructed not to sit down for three weeks. I often found it best to pee in the shower, because attempting to squat was a very messy process. The overall recovery has been pretty straightforward without any complications.
</p>
<p>
I traveled to Las Vegas to have my surgery with Dr. Brosious and so I stayed in an Airbnb for two weeks postop. I did see Dr. Brosious in his plastic surgery office two weeks after my surgery. He did a physical exam and was pleased with my healing and my dilation schedule. At this time he cleared me to return home. I did have one small wound and so he extended my restriction of no sitting, but only lying flat, or being upright for an additional week, which in total makes one month of restriction.
</p>
<p>
I have since returned home from Las Vegas and I am doing very well. I do my dilations three times a day with four dilators followed by douching with water and baby shampoo. I am either up walking around a little bit or I am laying flat without any sitting up. Overall, I would highly recommend Dr. Brosious to anyone considering penile inversion vaginoplasty.

Not being able to sit at all is - odd... typically, it is just limited sitting (like no more than 15 minutes, and preferably with a cushion).  The day they took out the packing and the catheter (the first time), they had me sitting on the toilet.
</p>
<p>
Also, baby shampoo is an interesting choice for douching.  Usually, it is plain water, saline water, or a water/vinegar mix.  This is the first time I have heard of this.  Guess each surgeon has their own preferences.
</p>

Happy to hear that you are on the other side and recovery sounds like it is going well.  Best wishes! ðŸ’œðŸ’œ
