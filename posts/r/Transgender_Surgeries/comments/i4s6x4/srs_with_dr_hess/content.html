I just had my very own non-binary &#34;design genital&#34;(1) surgery by Dr. Hess on July 29th, and I am very satisfied. Not only with the very professional procedures, also the after-care was very good. I am at home since Thursday, day 8 after surgery, and the healing proceeds very good.
</p>
<p>
Good luck for you and just one tipp: The food is high on carbs and low on fruits and dairy products. That really was my biggest negative there ;)

(1) no internal work, no neovagina, so probably a much lighter version of SRS.

In Germany it is called &#34;combined method&#34; It is based on the standard PI but greaty improved as it uses the existing tissue very efficiently and gives you some mucous membrane in your neo vagina that is taken from the excessive urethra. It was invented by Dr. Schaff and is currently used by Schaff, Morath, Scholl and Hess (and maybe more surgeons by now I do not know about tho).
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how to expalin it in english exactly so I hope that rings any bells. If not I can look it up and explain it in a detailed way tho.

How long do the different recoveries take (dilation, healing,‚Ä¶)?
</p>
<p>
How painful is recovery?
</p>
<p>
What does the aftercare directly after the surgery look like (what has to happen in the first week post op)?
</p>
<p>
Why did you go to Dr. Hess?

Ohhh yeah! Thank you üôÇ I don&#39;t feel quite ready to write the review yet but will do so at about 6 weeks post op as I see that as a nice mark.
</p>
<p>
But as for the update, surgery went well! I only had one very minor complication a day before going home that was quickly resolved and so far recovery is going well!

You won&#39;t find much there since he is working for a public hospital and does not have his own doctor&#39;s office tho.

Hey üòä So far so good! I even had my second surgery with him by now and am super happy. I did have some complications after the first surgery and some minor complications after the second surgery now, however nothing too big and none of it his fault.
</p>
<p>
Aftercare by him and the hospital is excellent, the result looks very cis and I have full sensation in my clit, no issue getting orgasms.
</p>
<p>
Sadly my vagina is very tight and lacks depth tho. So normal sex is not possible atm. The Thightness I believe should not be a problem at all in 1-2 month if I keep up dilation regulary but I am worried a bit about the lack of depth. I only have about 10 cm. I don&#39;t know by how much that can be improved with good dilation but I doubt I can reach more than.
</p>
<p>
That beeing said, I have kind of a petite build in general and my material beforehand was medium-small so that problem might be related to that.
</p>
<p>
I will write a review once everything is healed and I have time for it üôÇ

I&#39;ve heard only great things about Dr Hess. Aesthetic and sensation are really important for me. I&#39;m still debating if I should go to Suporn Clinic (but recovery is very long and very far away from Switzerland and my family), Dr Schaff /dr morath, dr Hess, dr Bluebond-langner or Dr Mcginn
</p>
<p>
You can definitely add some depth with a revision later. I know that Dr Schaff and dr Bluebond-langner do it perfectly well
</p>
<p>
Keep me updated please, if confortable for you with any photo
