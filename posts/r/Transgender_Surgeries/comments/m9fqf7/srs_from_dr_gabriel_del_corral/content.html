I learned that my insurance covers SRS! Yay!
<br>
But now I am starting the task of finding doctors that are preferred providers, as well as ones who deliver good results. I am mostly interested in the PPT method, so I am starting here. I am in Ohio and would like to drive to the surgeon if I can, and Baltimore is a doable distance.
<br>
So, anyone work with this clinic before?

The surgical center (brand new) is part of Medstar Franklin Square Hospital. You stay at least 7 days in a private room. The nurses and staff were excellent. I cannot say enough kind words about them...they really took care of me. The food was meh...but I was on a special diet so my choices were limited. When I was there last September, there were visitor restrictions in place due to Covid so keep that in mind. One person per day. Youâ€™ll have a wound vac over everything for the first few days but this helps with the healing time and process. With that said youâ€™ll be immobile in the beginning. A book, my phone with music and games kept me mostly occupied. A laptop or tablet is too heavy especially if you have BA at the same time like I did. Before you go home at the end of the week, theyâ€™ll teach you how to dilate and all of the post op care. (Donâ€™t stray from the schedule!!) Doctor Del Corral visited me a couple of times during my stay as well as a PA (Andy ðŸ¥°)and some interns. Everyone was very attentive and affirming. Follow up scheduled at 2 weeks, and then two telehealth appointments, every few months after that.

Ah okay! His site says he also offers the PPT as well as the typical PI. I&#39;ll have to investigate further. Thank you again for all this info!!

Very much so! Aesthetic results are amazing. His team uses robotic assistance during the procedure as well:)

Wonderful to hear!  And I mean to not be intrusive but what exact method did you go with? Did you also go for PPT?
