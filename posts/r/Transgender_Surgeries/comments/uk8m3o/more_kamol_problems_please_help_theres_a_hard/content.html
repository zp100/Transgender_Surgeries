More Kamol Problems - please help. There’s a hard white lump that bulges out when I’m stimulated and looks like it wants to burst. Erectile tissue? Popped stitch? Dilation is painful, sex is impossible due to my canal tightness, I’m lost for direction and losing hope. I’ve lost 70% of my orgasm.

Darcie Silver. Update - The surgeon recieved the photo and I received back this message.
</p>
<p>
It is not erectile tissue. He removed it all. It is skin that is inflamed and he thinks damaged by your recent herpes. He suggest you see a dermatologist to find a solution. Please see a local doctor and ask. He says its inflamed and damaged from the virus.
</p>
<p>
I really don’t know if I believe this could be true or not. It could take months to see a dermatologist here, or only 2 weeks to fly back to Thailand and have a revision with PAI.

I&#39;ve not heard of herpes in terms of complications before. I&#39;d check with a local doctor to see if they have any ideas.
</p>
<p>
You said it bulges when stimulated - I assume you mean sexually aroused? Because that&#39;s whats always reported as erectile tissue.
</p>
<p>
Maybe ask PAI about it and see what they say?

You posted this 8 days ago. Did you just get the reply?

I’m almost certain it’s erectile tissue and both Darcie and Dr Kamol are intentionally directing me away from returning for a revision with them. I’ve also expressed concerns with other aspects of SRS and FFS and have been left ignored in regards to those.
</p>
<p>
I only got the response yesterday. I’ve emailed PAI and explained the issue. Yes when I’m sexually aroused and afterwards it settles down.
</p>
<p>
My canal is also so tight that I’m considering a revision later with Dr Littleton for the jejunum graft, seeing as PPV seems so hit and miss and I’m not particularly keen to revise with my colon again.

Unfortunately Trans surgeries are a little black market and it&#39;s very hard to seek revisions or care for your problem with other doctors, so maybe try to talk to your agent very very nice, polite and have a lot of patience, maybe they will offer you a revision. Anyway your skin is so smooth and cis looking and I don&#39;t see big scars, congrats

Very pretty! I wish I had a clitoris as prominent as yours. The whitish lump looks just like my erectile tissue that Meltzer left in. I had it worked on by a urological surgeon though it is still there, reduced by only 25%. Oddly enough, mine doesn&#39;t &#34;present&#34; with stimulation. It comes out more when I bear down or my legs pass 90 degrees, such as in a squat or throwing my legs in the air for some unknown reason (cough).
</p>
<p>
I hope you find someone who can remove it while leaving everything else looking so magnificent!

Well she looks great! The white lump is probably erectile tissue but i don&#39;t really know tbh. Dilation...have you tried slow deep breathes (try to relax), lots of lube, and comfortable positioning? You might want to try to work up from a smaller dilator slower and with more dilation sessions. Try to slowly expand her. Orgasm...Are you trying to orgasm the way you used to? Like the old type of orgasm doesn&#39;t work that well with the new hardware. With my experience you kind of have to find the new one (the wave that takes time to build) and keep going for that one instead of the old quick burst. Orgasm is def something you relearn after surgery. You&#39;ve got to give yourself lots of support and credit because your body is like reprograming itself.

A bit off topic but I&#39;m considering surgery somewhere in PA and a big part of the reason why I is I&#39;ve had phantom limb before. I feel like the brain probably starts reprogramming itself before the body even catches onto the plan.

<p>
OP: I hope you can get to a point where you&#39;re able to be more comfortable  with penetration.  That really sucks.

Bon voyage, sailor lol.  Honestly everything down there is already super different feeling already from HRT I assume. Still curious bout that state sanctioned poos will feel. willing to lose orgasms or worse otherwise I wouldn&#39;t consider being operated on and for real just reading of some of the complications people have make me wanna shake and cry unironically. Trying to do what I can to effect a positive outcome though.

Oh ok lol Yeah state sanctioned surgery is awesome. I just wish the state covered doctors were more skilled. You can always want better right? I mean I&#39;m worlds better now that I&#39;ve had surgery and everything went fine but every time I see a new technique coming out or being discovered and girls are pressuring doctors to learn I&#39;m sitting here feeling like I wish I was a kid again so I could have even better you know? It&#39;s exciting for them, it&#39;s like a thing with getting older I feel.

Have I tried what you mentioned regarding dilation? Yes.  Have I tried working up through sizes? Yes I’m on second largest dilator, the largest dilator has always stretched and hurt. Some sessions it can be used, others no. There’s no dick out of the many Guys I’ve met that is this narrow. Most trans girls I know can sleep with thick guys.  Orgasm - yes my orgasm works. It’s functioning at a third or less of the intensity pre-op. I don’t need to relearn how to orgasm, I’m able to but I’ve lost the bulk of the euphoria. Similar to a handful of trail mix after a long hike - fills your hunger but it’s not a box of chocolates.

Yeah no one I know has been able to take the largest size. The last time I talked with the hospital I went to they said they asked the manufacturer to stop sending them the largest one in their packages because of this. I&#39;d talk to your surgeon about the tightness and see if a revision is possible. You really do need to relearn how to orgasm though, like that&#39;s a thing. It&#39;s also possible that your nerves havent recovered entirely yet? And of course it could just be that your surgeon messed up but I mean you really don&#39;t want it to be that, like its better if it&#39;s something less extreme.

I find this really interesting because the group I&#39;m a part of for my surgeon have almost all made it to orange with some even looking for bigger options. What&#39;s the timeline they usually give in order to try to make it to orange?

I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t remember. It was like 5 years ago. I know we did 15 or 30 mins a day then it was like every other day, then every few days, I think the time was a month or maybe it was 3 months? Basically you space it out slowly. Right now I&#39;m on the second largest once a week for 15 mins and it&#39;s been this way for about a year. I could go farther out but I saw some crazy tightening when I got here so I&#39;m waiting for a while before I try to go to like the fabled once a month I saw another girl was able to get to. That would be cool, almost like a period :)

Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I thought that the penile glans was significantly shaved down to form the clitoris. That could be why you&#39;re having a less intense orgasm? Vulvas often need multiple sources of sensation (over the whole body, not just focused on the genitals) in order to achieve a more intense orgasm so you could maybe try more full body stimulation? As for the white lump, it could be erectile tissue as that is often left near the urethral area, I would recommend you possibly speak to another SRS surgeon in your country and ask whether they could take a look at it and make recommendations. The kamol team could be more willing to talk to another surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Wishing you the best of luck! Please don&#39;t lose hope, it can take a year or two for everything to fully settle into itself

It may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
may be more, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic" rel="nofollow">Djordjevic
</a>
may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time.

...and what does your surgeon say about all of this? All of your various scenarios about my be or may not be are useless unless you have some hard info.
</p>
<p>
Don;t ask folk on Reddit for advice or diagnoses, get back into see the one person who actually IS an expert...

My surgeon is in Thailand and the CEO and my Agent aren’t taking me seriously.

Then make an appointment to see a local gynecologist--she may not be an expert, but she can certainly consult with a gender affirmation surgeon in a larg city near you. Text her your photos.

<p>
Much good luck, girlfriend.
</p>
<p>
Let me know what happens...

Gynaecologists don’t touch trans women.

This is untrue. Some will and do. It depends on the Gynecologists.
