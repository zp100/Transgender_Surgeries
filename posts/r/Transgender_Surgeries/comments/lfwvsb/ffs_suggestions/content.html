Does anyone have any good suggestions for ffs surgeons? Everytime i think I find a good choice i usually later find tons of reviews talking about their bad experiences and how the surgeon needs to retire. Not really sure where to look next

I will a 1000% not recommend Dr Z as a past patient and having BA and FFS revision currently less then a year later
</p>
<p>
Your top option are Deschamps, Lee, keojampa, rodman, mardirrosian, Jumaily, and Rolfes.
</p>
<p>
Do not go to Speigel Do not go to Mayer in less it’s revision ffs, or if you have no sinus cavity or jaw work Do not go to a srs surgeon

I&#39;m so Sorry you were hurt by Dr Z. I thought he was Bad news black 15 or so years ago when he seemed to bé more a Bad truck stop chef.
</p>
<p>
Why are you down on Speigle or  Mayer ? I&#39;ve always considéréd thèm as better surgeons.

Mayer is the best at soft tissue but he doesn’t cut and you just don’t get the same feminizing techniques. He’s very old school. Chin implants and burring. Type 1 which he will push because he CAN NOT perform type 3 even if he does take X-rays he has still told girls that type 3 will be fine for their thin sinus wall and pronounced ridges. He also charges far much for the work he does do.
</p>
<p>
Speigels work is extremely Inconsistent and he can do type 3 but I believe he also does not perform jaw or chin oesteomies. That why I just tell people to refer to the group IMO Reddit sucks for surgery advice private surgery groups are far better and you can see results and get advice from real people.

Dr Spiegel does do jaw and chin work, I just had FFS with him back in September (full forehead and brow, rhinoplasty, mandible shave and contour, very minor chin reduction, and tracheal shave) and I&#39;m very happy with the results.

I didn’t say he didn’t do jaw work he doesn’t cut he contours. Oesteomies vs shaving makes a big difference

My top 3 in no order :
</p>
<p>
Rolfes(sp?) In Wayzata, MN (?)   -  I think I&#39;ve seen pictures of some good work and he is within a long day&#39;s drive or a short hop by air.
</p>
<p>
Spiegle in Boston, MA - I like his consistent skill and he doesn&#39;t go for the severe fashion editorial look. It would also look peculiaron me.
</p>
<p>
Bella Avanessian - NYC  What I&#39;ve seen from pictures I like her results a lot and may go to her despite the reportedly inconsistent staff. Her head of surgery Dr Ting seems great as an administrator but I pass on him because her work seems better.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
------------
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Meltzer in AZ - He did a nice look on my genioplasty (receding chin) but the Intense pain I had for years only faded to an often forgotten dull pain than can sometimes flair to be intense. I prefer not to take another chance after GRS having a few bits of myself seem to be slightly
<em>
off code
</em>
in placement. He did 2 revisions to what was my corpora to get rid of my
<em>
hard-in
</em>
and 2 revisions to the direction of my urine stream from 15 deg. down to 30 &amp; lastly about 45 or so.
</p>
<p>
Harrison Lee somewhere in L.A. CA I think.  What I&#39;ve seen he may trim too much from the jaw, but for some that might work.
</p>
<p>
Zuckovsky - Chicago  A little too much of aTruck stop chef for my taste but I have seen some of his glam squad in person. Like Lee he seems to have that fashion editorial kind of look.
</p>
<p>
Marci Bowers has a providers list on marcibowers.com - I have a consult with her for GRS revision and hope to drop by a ffs surgeon she lists locally but since I&#39;ve never heard of him  or seen resultsI am super dubious. I don&#39;t remember his name right now.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m  looking more too.

In FFS the notorious surgeons for botching and ones you must avoid include butcher Bart Van de Ven and some say Zukowski and Spiegel.

I did notice with Spiegel&#39;s alleged botched jobs it isn&#39;t really that bad? Bart&#39;s are 10 times more horrific but I think it&#39;s better not to take chances. So... up to you.

Everyone has bad reviews. There will always be some patients who had unrealistic expectations, bad communication between patient and doctor, or off-days from the surgeon. The goal shouldn&#39;t be to find a surgoen with zero negative reviews; find one that you like from consults.

I heard a lot of good things about Rodman and Rolfes and really liked the results I saw from them.  I also have heard and seen good results from Toby Mayer but he does not do a type 3 reconstruction if you need it.
</p>
<p>
I had really good consults with both Rodman and Rolfes and they made me feel at ease, but ultimately I went with the one that I vibed with the results more, so Rolfes.
