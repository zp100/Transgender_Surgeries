A touch fragile but glad I’m reaching the point that I should notice improvements day to day now. The worst was the 12 hrs after surgery, that was grim

I had compression bandages on, a couple of ice masks and packs in my nostrils, a drain in my neck and a large suture on the back of your head so just finding a position that was comfortable was impossible. The surgery lasted 13 hours so your absolutely beat and just want to sleep, but it’s impossible. I was bringing to panic also because breathing was through mouth only and as they did 3 incisions in the mouth, that swelled up too so you are left gasping for air for a little while.  In the morning when they remove the drain and packs I felt a million times better, so it was just that first night.

Yeah, that&#39;s grim. Do you know if its typical?
</p>
<p>
Are there&#39;s nurses around all the time? Its not actually dangerous, just unpleasant? Do they measure blood oxygen levels and did you get oxygen?
</p>
<p>
You didn&#39;t mention pain. How&#39;s that going?

You have nurses on call. You press the button and they talk to you through the intercom.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s really cool the system they have, it just rings their mobile and you get answered in seconds.

Yikes, second person that’s said they were like that. Guess I really must be lucky. I did feel a bit like the one waking up in hospital at the beginning of Day if the Triffids, if that means anything to you lol

Yesterday I could stumble around the room a bit but today I made an effort to get dressed and go for a walk around the hospital. I felt a bit vulnerable but otherwise ok, I just want to get back to feeling normal asap

Do you feel like you would be able to care for yourself at this point in terms of the basics like getting your own food and whatnot? Reason I ask, I will be going solo with my recovery (thanks family).

Well I’ll be discharged from the hospital this afternoon, and back to the hotel which is 5m walk away. They divide taxis for this. The hotel is full board and will do room service so there’s not much for me to do other than phone it an order. The hotel is part of the package, the Gvadalpun Banus, it’s a suite with sea views and is really nice.  The care continues after I leave hospital, with another acupuncture session this afternoon, and a nurse visit tomorrow to wash the hair transplants. I don’t feel isolated in anyway and I don’t think being on your own would be an issue other than boredom. They have a group therapy thing on Monday which I’m a little apprehensive about going to given the state of me but I’ll see how I feel on the day. It does seem like they go above and beyond to make you feel as comfortable as possible, this being the reason I chose FT.

How much did it cost and how long will it take before you can get back to work/school/normal life  etc? I&#39;m considering facial team and I&#39;m very interested in anything I can learn about them.

All in all it was about EUR35k, with the accommodation, hair transplants and all. I’ve gotta be back in the office in 3 weeks which by all accounts should be ok. The first test will be getting home in a little over a week, but what will be will be. The hair transplants do complicate it a little as basically you can’t touch them for a good week which means I’m rocking the shaved head look like it or not.

Alright. So in total maybe 4 weeks away from work? Thank you. I don&#39;t need hair transplants but otherwise I think my procedure list is about the same as yours.

Weird how that is, cause as soon as I was out of surgery, I couldn&#39;t sleep, and when they removed the drain (weirdest experience ever) and the catheter, I was walking around the garden and was sitting in &#34;my patio&#34; as my room overlooked the rear entrance by reception.
</p>
<p>
Ended up calling the Oncall doctor to find out if I was discharged on the 2nd day because I was packed and bored, so we booked a taxi and left just after lunch :).
</p>
<p>
Hope Isabel is treating you well :)

Yes I had no idea that thing was wrapped around the back of my head till they pulled it out. Biggest relief was the removal of the nasal packs and being able to breath freely.
</p>
<p>
I can’t complain about any of the care I’ve received. Best parts have been the acupuncture and the massages hmmm

Yea, I liked Lolo&#39;s work, never had acupuncture before, and i&#39;m not sure it did anything, but I was super relaxed afterwards, which was worth it. Plus it didn&#39;t &#34;cost anything&#34;, so unless you have a major aversion to it, might as well take it.
</p>
<p>
As for the lymphatic drainage, Antonio basically runs HC. Anything he wants, he gets, instantly. That&#39;s how well respected he is there. And again, I&#39;m not sure if what he did actually had any effect on anything, but I was super relaxed afterwards.
</p>
<p>
I got to see him a 3rd time to talk about my leg that cramped up during surgery, my entire right leg was numb so he used his powers to figure out what was going on, and it was just all the muscles that were as hard as concrete. So he advised I go to the physio at Aldea for a few sessions to try and relieve the muscles.
</p>
<p>
It helped a little bit, but it still took 6 months for my leg to feel normal again.
</p>
<p>
I assume they&#39;re still sending patients to the hotel by the beach, because a friend was there in October and she was there. 5 Star stuff.

Yes I got moved from Aldea to the Gvadalpin at some point last year. I can’t say I’m unhappy about it ☺️. I think it was Antonio’s voice that does it, you can just shut you eyes and drift off lol

Yea, it sounds like the new place is a good replacement, it just has the issues I had when looking at other places for FFS, and that&#39;s it&#39;s just a hotel, so you&#39;ve got people there on their holidays who might not be quite so diplomatic when it comes to seeing people in varying stages of recovery.
</p>
<p>
But as you said in another post, it&#39;s all room service, so if you wanted to, you could just stay there the entire time.

Hey / sorry to come back again on this dead thread. - I’m home on Monday, but my freaking chin and jaw swelling is hideous. Being 10 days post op now I’m a bit deflated despite the “trust me” messages from dr dreamboat. How were you at 10 days? When did you start to notice material reductions in the lower face swelling?

10 Days is nothing for the jaw/chin, it took about 6 months for it to start feeling normal, and even at 10 months, it still feels a bit weird at times. A week after mine, I had only just started to progress to eating harder things like bread.
</p>
<p>
After about a month though, it was much better, still not feeling right, but I could at least eat normally and move my jaw without too much stiffness.

I suppose I was kind of lucky, because I didn&#39;t bruise at all, so it was just a bit of swelling, but I was happy that
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/BY44bea.png" rel="nofollow">this giant brow
</a>
was gone.
</p>
<p>
Still felt a bit light headed, but all in all, I knew before hand it would take ages to heal, and the results wouldn&#39;t be there instantly, but there&#39;s still a bit of you that wants to see instant results.

Hiya Yeah I’m a bit like that, am ok in the mornings and getting a couple of hours work done, then I’m wasted for the rest of the day.  I think trying to get on with normal stuff does help though, I barely look human let alone feel human, so anything to help 😂

I hope it restores some balance between what I see and what I think I should see. I’d be happy with that.

First meal was a smoothie, then after that it’s been normal food, fish, potatoes etc, it’s nice but I don’t really have much of an appetite. With the numbness and swelling it’s not very pleasant to eat.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think the save has affected my voice, but it’s too early to tell what with the swelling. There’s no reason it should have, they make a point of avoiding interference with the vocal chords.

I am glad you are bored, there is nothing better to be after such a surgery.  Eat, drink, walk, sleep, use your voice a little as possible and just recover.
</p>
<p>
Seriously if you want to read about what not being bored is like go read my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/aigmdv/my_ffs_research_consultations_surgery_recovery" rel="nofollow">ffs experience
</a>
and recovery.  You want to be bored, being bored is the right thing, the good thing.

Well that was a sobering read, but worth the time,  during the first 12hrs it did strike me how “this shit is real” and that maybe I had underestimated how hard this was going to be. Even now as swelling develops under my eyes there’s a part of me thinking is my recovery going that well.
</p>
<p>
For sure though I seem to have had a better time that you had. Certainly no nausea or adverse reactions to the medications. I actually quite enjoyed the trippy hangover of the anaesthesia.

Yeah you will probably get some swelling over the next few days especially in the mornings, that seems pretty normal.  And yeah most people (everyone?) seem to have more of the experience you are having which I am glad for, I wouldn&#39;t wish what I went through on anyone.
</p>
<p>
Rest, eat even though you might not want to and walk/move.  Those really will help your body get back.  Meet anyone else from FacialTeam at your hotel?  We are pretty easy to spot after surgery :)

I think it’s accepted that it’s rough to begin with. There’s nurses around and you have the panic button. It’s more the discomfort than the pain.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been given regular iv pain medication although I cannot really say pain has been an issue. It is more the discomfort with the numbness and swelling around the nose jaw and brow, but even that has started to subside now.
</p>
<p>
They have done a lot to help me to feel comfortable too - lymphatic massages and acupuncture sessions really zone you out and have been lovely.
