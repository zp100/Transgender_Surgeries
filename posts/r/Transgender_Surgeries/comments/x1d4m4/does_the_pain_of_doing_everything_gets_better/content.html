Believe me it does! ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m currently 2 months post-op and had catheter pain (like a really excruciating UTI pain) for two days after the bag came off which was then due to come out thankfully.
</p>
<p>
When it comes out there will be pain briefly, and possibly may be some stinging when passing urine due to wee going on any wounds for the first day or two however youâ€™ll feel great afterwards.

Oh yeah, catheters are horrible. It&#39;s all much easier once it&#39;s out.

Yes it does! My urethra felt sore for about 2 days after the catheter came out but after that healing went a lot faster and down there was a lot more comfortable

From my experience, things got better after I got the catheter removed! For the next couple of weeks, peeing would come out kind of spray-y but then it went back to normal!
