Even though you lost your depth (sorry for that) it looks extremely good! Had my GCS 2 weeks ago with him, I hope it heals and looks like yours! Best of look to your sigma!

Can I ask a bit how that works like that&#39;s the extent they can do. Like, I would assume somenody can&#39;t just go to a complete other surgeon with a botched vagina and be like start it from scratch?

Well for starters my vagina isn‚Äôt botched!! From my understanding there are few options that can be used; PPT, skin graft or sigmoid(colon). I chose colon. They would remove the skin grafted canal that closed up and replace it with the colon segment. In order to move forward with the procedure the surgeon in question must be confident to move forward with the case. In my instance because my vagina just needs a canal replacement; she agreed to take me on as a new patient.

<p>
No, no, no, not saying your vagina is botched, meant just in general, still very new to all of this and learning. I&#39;m so sorry if that came off wrong üôè
</p>
<p>
I actually think you have one off the best results I&#39;ve seen here. No big moves yet, but I&#39;ve been trying to decide myself which procedure I would want to go with, though I imagine it&#39;s more of a sergeon based thing than actual choice

The one thing I&#39;ve gathered so far is that finding a surgeon seems to be one of the hardest parts. Like the few that look the best are places like Thailand and Netherlands. Which ngl? I would not feel safe traveling that far to somewhere I&#39;ve never been before. Like unless it&#39;s 100% assisted where they pick you up and take you to the hospital, you stay at where they do the surgery.
</p>
<p>
Plus, assuming you also have to pay the flight cost separately, I feel like that can get really pricey, but at the same time, since I don&#39;t understand everything about it, I wouldn&#39;t want an average at best surgeon to do that procedure so maybe it would be better to just wait to have enough saved for the overseas ones

I would say go with your gut feeling. You have to live with your results for the rest of your life. Go to the doctor who you deem that can give you the best results.

If you&#39;re afraid to travel that far. Maybe talk with local transwomen. In the Netherlands we also have patientorganisations that can help you out. Like transvisie.nl and transgendernetwerkenderland.nl. Besides that i often hear Thailand is farahead in technique delending on what you want.

Yea, I decided if I&#39;m gonna pay 25k no matter what, I&#39;d rather it be Dr. Bank over any amateur surgeon from the states

Oh I got you üòÇüòÇ. I misread that a bit üòÇüòÇ. I think it‚Äôs important to note that with every surgeon there is a risk that a complication can arise. With that in mind I started my search by looking at doctors with a low complication rate; personally I think doing that decreases the risk that a complication could happen. Then I did significant research into how vulvas looked. Then I narrowed my search to what I want aesthetically. This is very much a personal choice. I wanted a vulva where my labia minora is hidden a bit. Also what i gathered from my research is that there are few doctors who are very good at both functionality and aesthetics.
