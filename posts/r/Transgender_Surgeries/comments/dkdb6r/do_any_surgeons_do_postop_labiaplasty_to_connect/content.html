Do any surgeons do post-op labiaplasty to connect the labia minora to the bottom of the vaginal opening?

From what I understand, that is what a revision can address.

As I understand, most surgeons offer/recommend a revision. If you are interested in an “anatomically correct” vagina, you should plan on a revision.

In Linköping Sweden they normally do a 2nd operation under local anesthetic. I apparently had so much errectile tissue, that they wanted to put me properly under, though.

So they generally offer a revision here? It makes me so much more relieved.

They plan to do the operation in 2 stages, yes, from the very start.
</p>
<p>
Are you waiting for an operation there?

That&#39;s amazing. I probably will do in solna tho, since I&#39;m from Stockholm. But to be honest I&#39;m not sure when or how will happen :/

AFAIK Solna is only 1 operation, not sure about their policy on revisions and such!

There are two similar but separate issues and I&#39;m not sure which one you&#39;re referring to. There&#39;s labia minora that don&#39;t reach past the top of the introitus (common with many modified-PI surgeons), and labia minora that do, but don&#39;t connect at a fourchette (seems near-universal without revision).
</p>
<p>
For the first, it&#39;s apparently possible to do by creating a crease in the labia majora, but I&#39;ve seen no other information about it or photos.
</p>
<p>
For the second, Suporn appears to do it but is apparently sometimes hesitant to do so, perhaps based on individual anatomy. The woman in the Suporn PDF had this done. I&#39;ve heard claims that there is a high failure rate, but somebody else posted that that rate was only for separation during recovery, which is a much more controllable issue.
</p>
<p>
I think Chet claims to do it in the first stage but I&#39;m very skeptical, and he doesn&#39;t seem keen on revisions. As for any other surgeons, finding photos or even information about revisions that aren&#39;t to address complications seems to be difficult. It&#39;s a shame, as I think it&#39;d be at least helpful to hear how this process works with insurance/state health plans for the US and Canada.
