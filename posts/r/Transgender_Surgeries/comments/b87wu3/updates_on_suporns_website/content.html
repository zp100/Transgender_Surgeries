I just noticed a couple of changes of Suporn&#39;s site.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s more if you follow the links, but the key points
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dr Suporn has decided to defer his retirement for at least another year. Instead of undertaking no operations after 2019 as announced some 2 years ago, he has now decided to continue his work a little longer, and will undertake a number operations during 2020. However, the intensity of his involvement will decrease, and he will undertake fewer operations in 2020 than has been the case in previous years.
</p>

<p>
There&#39;s a new surgeon, Dr Prae (Navipa Dusitanond). Previously she only showed up as a name on the
<a href="http://www.supornclinic.com/clients/calendar.htm">booking schedule
</a>
, but there&#39;s more detail about her now.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dr Prae is already a very experienced SRS surgeon, who has been using a technique very similar to mine in her own hospital. She is a senior Plastic and Reconstructive surgeon and lecturer at the department of Surgery at Queen Savang Vadahna Memorial Hospital. She started joining me in my operating theatre during 2017 and 2018. During those operations we have worked together to ensure that when she operates on our clients without any input from me, the technique used will be a facsimile of the Suporn Technique in every respect. Because of her commitments to her own hospital, she will only be able to undertake a limited number of SRS ‚ÄúTeam‚Äù operations during 2019, which for now will be done with me present in the Operating theater. However, during 2020 and beyond, I am hopeful she will be able to spend more time with the Suporn Team, and will be taking on operations without my presence. You may have no doubt, she is an excellent surgeon in whose skills I have complete faith
</p>

When they emailed me a month ago, they gave a list prices for each surgeon based on when the surgery happens.
</p>
<p>
July to December 2019: Suporn is 625,000 Baht, Bank is 550,000 Baht, Prae is 525,000 Baht, and a Team Surgery is 525,000 Baht.
</p>
<p>
January to June 2020: Suporn is 650,000 Baht, Bank is 565,000 Baht, Prae is 550,000 Baht, and a Team Surgery is 525,000 Baht.

So is the team surgery all three of them working on you? Shouldn&#39;t this be the most expensive option?

I&#39;m actually not sure what &#34;Team Surgery&#34; means exactly. I think it might have been used more when Bank was still training, so you get him and Suporn doing the operation, maybe? And then it costs less because you have a newer surgeon on the team. I could be wrong, but that&#39;s my impression.
