So they fiddled with my pain meds some more.  I did a lot more walking and standing. At about 8 or 9 o clock i was feeling a lil bad so they gave me some tylolenol and my nightly xanax &#34;as needed&#34; lol.  Well i was still hurting and my sister had just bought a weed vape.... I took a couple of puffs and everything felt different all at once..   I was no longer numb in my vagina..  I can feel the packing and the drains and the swelling and the catheter All it once.  Gave me a full on panic attack... Had to have the nurses check me out and talk me down..  They finally gave me a percocet and things settled down but i finally feel very connected with my vagina for the first time . It is amazing

Not too but I can speak to this. The pain upon waking up wasn&#39;t bad but I was out of it for the first few days. The surgery itself isn&#39;t painful its the recovery that is. I had an epidural with diladin which gave me a lot of nausea and vomiting which they gave me nausea medication for. Id say for the vast majority of the week in the hospital pain was on average a 5-7 out of 10. Sitting up/standing up around day 3-4 was definitely a 10 but got easier over time. By day 6 I was walking around majority of the day. (Mainly because I couldn&#39;t get comfortable on the bed or chair so next best thing was walk around.
</p>
<p>
While the first week was hell, just keep in mind that it is a major surgery and takes 3 months to get back to normalcy and a full year to be completely recovered. The first week sucked so much I regretted having it, now 2 months post op I have seldom pain and couldn&#39;t be happier.

I hope this helps, feel free to DM if you have any questions ‚ù§Ô∏è

The worst pain is in your legs, back and heels of feet immediately after surgery from surgical positioning. .  i do wish they would give me more pain killers after day 3 to keep me comfortable though
