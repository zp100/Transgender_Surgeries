It&#39;s just going to take 30 days to not look injured, 2 months to not look swollen, and 6 months to be pretty much done?

I don&#39;t think ffs will make you non pretty, if you already were.  What it will do is make you look female, so I think youre going to be back on here in about two weeks absolutely shocked at how your appearance has improved.  Ping me so I can say I told you so.

May I ask, because there&#39;s no other way to have any idea right now, how much roughly would these procedures cost? I&#39;m considering ffs and I want the best for something like this and it seems they are a good choice.

I was billed over $50k, and only able to afford it because my employer provides surprisingly comprehensive trans coverage.  Also definitely worth shopping around to get an idea of different surgeons rates and services, there‚Äôs no one ‚Äúbest‚Äù surgeon, just the one who best meets your needs &amp; who you personally feel most comfortable with being literally inside your face for a full day.

Welp. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have asked for that price üòÇ That&#39;s USD correct? If so that&#39;s like 66k CAD. Bloody hell I need a better employer lol. Thing is, that&#39;s an American thing to have employers insurance cover these costs. No Canadian employers do so because it&#39;s left to the provincial healthcare, which covers absolutely minimal (no ffs) for trans people. So be appreciative of that!

Yeah I&#39;ve been definitely grateful that, even though I think the US health care system is generally the worst way to do it, it seems to have worked out for me in this particular area. But still even in the US there&#39;s not a lot of people who are lucky enough to have something like this covered.

Haven&#39;t had my first surgery yet, but ... this is what I want to do first. I can imagine how you&#39;d go into this all full of hope, optimist, etc.
</p>
<p>
But the reality is, you did a tremendous thing to your body, now it has to heal. The good news is, plenty have come before you and ... your body will heal.
</p>
<p>
Do what you&#39;re doing, try to keep that weight on, try and give your body the resources it needs to heal (food, rest, time) and think positive thoughts. Your mental state is tied to the outcome. You can do this!
</p>
<p>
We believe in you.

I&#39;m sorry things are feeling/are rough. You did a thing, and that took courage. Stick it out, and let time work its wonders. Odds are you&#39;ll turn out beautiful.

Thanks, there‚Äôs a part of my mind that believes that and another part just facing the reality in the mirror right now.  Also I probably have a decent amount of post op depression and anxiety from spending 22 hours a day in my hotel room with little other to think about. I think I‚Äôm going to find some show to binge, to hopefully take my mind off things for awhile.

No worries. I imagine it&#39;s very hard, but you can do it. You&#39;ve come this far! Try watching  something escapist maybe (planet Earth/blue planet)? Or something uplifting (good place, parks and rec, etc)? Avoid violent things, I&#39;d think.

Thanks for posting this. I&#39;m getting FFS done in four weeks and trying to prepare myself mentally for it, and I really appreciate reading your experience. And relax -- you went to DB, you&#39;re going to be fine. You knew this was going to be difficult going into it, and here you are. Before you even know it, you&#39;ll look back on this and laugh about how worried your current state made you.

True, though knowing and experiencing are different things :) I‚Äôd be happy to check in with you after your surgery and let you know where I‚Äôm at then, hopefully with a more healed perspective to share if you find yourself in a similar low. I think I‚Äôm already feeling a lot better today, though anxious to get the rest of the bandages off and take a full, proper shower.

Hey 5 days post op too, near same emotions - just gotta understand the swelling is immense and it will subside, it‚Äôs just going to take time. I am fighting the ‚Äúwas it worth it‚Äù thoughts when I look in the mirror, but rationale brain tells me ‚Äúchill the fk out‚Äù You‚Äôre not alone, it is was tougher than it looks on the before/after pics
