Hello lovely people üëã  Well let‚Äôs start my rant/informative post. First off, I am not here to bash on this doctor. Just sharing my experience. I got FFS from Dr.Hector Malagon in Mexico City of last year. I chose him because he was close by, I saw that he does ct scans and credentials such as maxilofacial plastic surgery. I got hairline advance/rounding-trichophytic incision - with jaw v-line, chin sliding genioplasty, ‚Äúcat eyes‚Äù lateral canthoplasty, and nose. I was not happy at all with the outcome. I ended up with one eye having a huge noticeable difference compared to the other eye which looked like he didn‚Äôt even touch it. I got chin pstosis that was more on the right side as you look at me rather than center, basically he left me with a bump of soft tissue for a chin. I waited some time to see if things would get better. Long story short, no it didn‚Äôt get better. I lost all confidence and I became a huge depressed hermit. I didn‚Äôt want people to see my messed up uneven eye and this bump I had as a chin. It was embarrassing and also the worst time of my life. I did all my follow ups and also expressed my concerns to him. He wasn‚Äôt even listening and it seemed like he was just gaslighting me. When I told him about my eye and chin, he said I had to wait for the eye to get its shape back and the brow will raise up as well. That didn‚Äôt happen. He said the same for the chin pstosis. When I reached out for my last follow up with him at 6 month post surgery, I asked him if he could give me my ct scan. This was all followed up with a ‚Äúsend pictures‚Äù response. There was no change. At 6 months everything flaw he did still was there AND I always got gendered male.  Luckily I had a cat scan done pre FFS and post FFS. He cut off too much bone from my chin and jaw. The soft tissue work was not great at all. It even got to the point where I think he had one of his trainees do the surgery on me instead of him. Things seemed shady and he wasn‚Äôt going to give me my CT scans. He told me he would send ct scans to me in email. Never got them. After about 7 months I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore and made the decision to go for revisions using another doctor. My friend told me about Dr.Mardirossian. I saw his work and was very impressed by it. He has many patients he worked on, in his IG. After a consult with him I decided to go with it. After 2nd round of FFS I could definitely see a change that made me happy, something I didn‚Äôt see at all with previous FFS. Depending on how things heal I may not need to get anymore revisions BUT that possibility is still there. Dr.Mardirossian was so nice and explained in details what was needed to be done. I was so glad he helped me get confidence back. Anyways my point with this is to warn others about my experience with. Dr.Malagon. Again I‚Äôm not bashing him. I just don‚Äôt think his style worked out for me and I thought it was a bit sus that he never gave me my CT scans that I asked for before the surgery. Ladies if he is your choice, I‚Äôd make sure to get ct scan before surgery and also go in great detail about any work he will perform. Have him get a 3D printed skull of yours and to show you exactly what the change will be and how ‚Äúdrastic‚Äù the outcome will be. I ended up having to get a chin implant and even then I have to see if that fixes what Dr.malagon had done. This is NOT any of Dr.Mardirossian‚Äôs fault at all. Dr.Mardirossian exceeded my expectations and was excellent work. I have pictures to share through message of the first round of FFS with Dr.Malagon and you can make your mind up about it. Im currently healing from the revisions so I don‚Äôt have too much to show. If interested message me.  Overall I saw other girls who had surgery with Malagon were Happy(I believe it was only two other girls) of the outcome. Anyways this is the end of my rant. AMA

Yes you need to post. Its a way to protect other people and also you simply writing your experience. Doctors need to be held accountable, if Doctors dont want bad reviews either they gotta do a good work or if the patient is not happy with the results then its up to the Dr to take responsability for his work and fix the issues. That shows true professionalism but most Dr. dont give a shit. They should even refund money if they are not willing to fix their work because you pay to be made look more feminine improve, not to be left looking worst. Good luck to you sis.
