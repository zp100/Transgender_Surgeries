I did have depression going into surgery and I didn’t expect it to alleviate all of my depression. Of course I know that surgery changes very particular things and it’s impossible for it to improve deep rooted psychological issues. I did however expect it to make me feel more comfortable with what I had between my legs and sure it’s definitely helped with genital dysphoria but the result is not what I feel it should be and whatever can be corrected is gonna take awhile to fix.
</p>
<p>
Most doctors won’t dare do a revision until at least a year post op. I wouldn’t mind waiting a few more months but it’s not just waiting that’s required. It’s finding a time to schedule a revision with my original surgeon or should I chose to go to a different one I would have to wait even longer for an open spot in their schedule since revision surgeries aren’t a high priority, especially if they didn’t perform the original surgery. Then there’s getting insurance preauthorization, saving up enough for a revision and then having to take time off work for said revision.
</p>
<p>
Even after all of that there’s still no guarantee that anything can be fixed to my liking. I probably sound ungrateful in saying that but I just want to be comfortable and at peace with my body.
</p>
<p>
I do see a therapist and am prescribed medication but it really isn’t working. Every time I discuss that whatever medication I’m prescribed doesn’t work they either offer to increase the dosage or suggest trying a different one altogether but in my experience long term usage of medication just doesn’t work for me.

Talk to your surgeon to get some help. Silver nitrate sucks, but it really helps. I lived with really horrible hypergranulation for six weeks post op, but the silver nitrate did wonders in the last three weeks. I had a lot of complications too that weren’t pleasant at all. I had a blood clot in my urethra that forced the nurses to hard cath me on the day of my release. I also tore my butthole open too. Don’t feel too badly. Complications are common. It might seem hopeless now, but a little perspective shifting and some help from your surgeon can go a long ways. Sorry that you’re feeling badly. I know those feels.

Would you mind to tell us what complications you are experiencing, and who your surgeon(s) is/are? Now you are describing your situation in quite a general and subjective way. So we cannot judge how bad it really is. And we can only say something non-specific to your situation. I wonder whether it would be really helpful to you... But first of all, have you been sleeping well? What you have said sounds like what someone might be saying after having a few nights bad sleep.

My complications are very visible and thick scars (almost keloid-like), granulation tissue, and my clitoris is misshaped. It’s also fairly small so I’m afraid a revision would just make it look worse. My surgeon is Dr. Wittenberg. I haven’t really been sleeping much at all recently because I’m extremely anxious about my results potentially getting worse and in general feeling disappointed in myself.

For what it&#39;s worth, while it does take time at the 6 month period it should look decent.  Mine didn&#39;t and I had the same thick keloid like scars and i was devastated by the appearance. I went to see a dermatologist who prescribed Lyderm Fluocinonide to break up the scarring and Dermatix Ultra scar gel to reduce the scar appearance.  Dermatix is amazing. it&#39;s insanely powerful more so than any other scar creams or vitamin E. highly recommend looking into both.
</p>
<p>
I also then added some special lightening cream on a couple parts and you can&#39;t even tell unless  look super close, it&#39;s remarkable. This was over 4 month span around until around the 1 year mark and I was really happy at how quickly it came around. I was obsessing over nothing.
</p>
<p>
It was also advised to let the hair grow out and cover the scars a bit 4 and half months is still healing time.  I can understand you wanting it to look amazing but these things take time, it&#39;s not the final product. 6 month is when things really come together. at the 1 year mark you will have MOST of it healed and cleaned up.
</p>
<p>
This process teaches us patience, you have to give it a bit more time.
</p>
<p>
You shouldn&#39;t be disappointed in yourself. If you broke your leg would you expect to be able to run immediately? Or for the leg to heal in a couple days?  Would you tell your friend they should run a marathon 4 months after breaking their leg? You have decades left in your life.  These things will not be a problem a year from now, or 10 years from now or 50 years from now so don&#39;t let it consume you.

Even though you are already 4 and a half months post-op, you are still in the recovering stage. If you get enough sleep, your surgery site might get better, or it might not, but if you don&#39;t get enough sleep, it could really get worse, like what you are fearing. So, get some sleep first! If you have a partner or a friend who you can trust, it might help to let him or her play with your hair while you try to fall asleep. Otherwise, buy a big pillow that you can hug :) Sleep tight :)

Are you using Bio Corneum on the scars? This can really help, you can get it OTC from Amazon or wherever

I am almost  two year  post op and  experienced immediate urinary complications from the surgery. I still currently experiencing urinary complications  from my  surgery. I don&#39;t regret transitioning. But I do regret getting SRS due to the   immediate complications I faced after surgery. We take things for granted in life. I miss how  effortlessly  peeing was for me. I have a urologist that I see pretty  much on a  monthly basis. Still trying to figure out why I am not fully  emptying  my bladder and why its difficult for me to begin stream. sigh.  :( I&#39;m  constantly reminded how easily peeing was for me before getting  the  surgery. And now it takes so much effort and concentration. I wish I  could turn back time.

I understand what you are going through. When something that you&#39;ve always dream of doesn&#39;t turn out the way you expected it to be can be extremely frustrating. Stay strong! And remember that there are way worst situations out there then what we are going through. And at least we are living our true authentic selves in this day and age. Speedy recovery sis and God Bless You!
