I was there last February for my surgery and it went well. First, make sure you connect with the front desk as they will provide you with all the logistical steps. They are extremely well informed and may even give you some paperwork and the time that the taxi will pick you up to bring you to the clinic on your operation day. The front desk will also give you some Uber eats credit so you can eat while you’re staying at the hotel. I believe they give you a $50 credit per day.
</p>
<p>
For any of your pre-surgery procedures you need to read booklet C which has all the instructions on your enema, bacterial wash and putting Nair or Veet on your genitals to remove the hair. Make sure you follow these instructions so it’s not to delay or postpone your surgery. Particularly with eating you do not want to have too much food around dinner time the night before your surgery so it’s you’re not bloated from the painkillers after your surgery, and also make sure you do not eat and drink at 8 to 12 hours prior to your surgery.
</p>
<p>
Then make sure when you get up on the day of your surgery you were on time, you bring all your luggage with you out of the hotel and be ready for the start of your new journey.

I think the schedule for showers, enemas, etc is in the booklet in the confirmation email they would have sent most recently.
</p>
<p>
Have you had your COVID test already? If not you need to make an appointment and get to Lilium Diagnostics right away.

I had some crazy stuff happen with flights, but I had it done in Toronto yesterday and sent it to them.
</p>
<p>
Okay so I just follow the booklet to a T and then they&#39;ll pick me up in the morning?

In the morning you go to the desk maybe an hour before your hospital check in time. They will call you a cab and give you a voucher to pay for it.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise yes. Just follow the times in the booklet they gave you for prep stuff.
