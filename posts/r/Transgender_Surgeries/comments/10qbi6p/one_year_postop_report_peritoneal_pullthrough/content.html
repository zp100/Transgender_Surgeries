First off, I wish NO ONE had to spend that kind of time recovering from GRS. It took my twice as long as you still. The crazy thing is, Roth could have done so much more and as far as I&#39;m concerned he could have handled any complication that came up. He simply CHOSE not to invest the time and energy in the problems and help.
</p>
<p>
This entire story hit&#39;s too close to home for me. It&#39;s completely consistent with my own experience with Dr. Roth and the challenges he has with &#34;listening.&#34; You&#39;re lucky you didn&#39;t get to experience the double whammy gas-lighting bonanza from both Gallagher AND Roth.
</p>
<p>
I could put together a small book using my correspondence with Roth and chasing my tail around and around trying to get him to help and then answering  questions to my queries that I didn&#39;t even ask. I remember at one point, after getting another email that completely avoided the question I asked, That it wasn&#39;t Dr. Roth who was responding. The entire tone and writing style had changed and I realized it had to be an attorney.
</p>
<p>
I tried so very hard to communicate with him and it was just impossible. It was frustration after frustration. He would commit to helping in some way and then get mad when I followed up for him to follow thru.  I ended up going all the way to the Cleveland Clinic for care, who I highly recommend.
</p>
<p>
By the way, he did actually spend a considerable amount of time at the University of Ghent in Belgium doing a training fellowship. I have the tweets from the university when he was there. in 2019. This was before Gallagher left.

I&#39;m so sorry that was your experience. I am just glad I didn&#39;t have to go through Gallagher first....

I highly recommend Gallagher if you want to go through a lot of revisions and still end up wetting your pants for the rest of your life.  I mean, maybe some people are into that kind of thing. I mean, in terms of sheer damage a physician can inflict and get away with, Gallagher is untouchable.

Sorry for the revival, but I can&#39;t remember if you had depth issues as well? If so, was Cleveland able to help?

No, no depth issues. It remained fairly consistent almost the 5th dot on blue, and 4th on green

Sure thing, the biggest difference now it that I&#39;m not angry about it anymore. The cysts are gone the aesthetics are acceptable and it&#39;s functional. All the chronic issues, mainly the urination and bladder control are things I&#39;ve accepted and learned to how to navigate around. Still, there&#39;s no way I would EVER recommend her to anyone, for anything. I may not be angry about what she did to me, but I haven&#39;t forgotten.
