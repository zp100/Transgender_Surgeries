So, I&#39;m about a month postop now.  There&#39;s still a little discomfort in my vagina and I can&#39;t say it&#39;s unexpected because I still need to heal and recover.  But I feel like I&#39;m really in a rush to get to some of the recovering.
</p>
<p>
See, now, part of my post-op instructions involve putting bacitracin on the incisions and on the clitoris.  No problems with that, but over the last few nights, I&#39;ve been finding places right under my clitoris that feels good when I put it on.  Like *REALLY* good.  And I want more, I want to have an orgasm with it, but I feel like I&#39;m at a roadblock.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a little frustrating though.  I mean, I&#39;m delighted that I finally have a vagina now, but I guess I have a problem or two.  First, I probably need to let it heal up and recover at least a little more.  I can accept that, even if patience hasn&#39;t always been my strong suit.  Still, how long have most of you had to wait to achieve orgasm postop?  Second is, now that I have a vagina, I feel like I&#39;m working with parts I don&#39;t know how to use; does anyone have any tips or ideas or ways to work with your vagina that might help me achieve orgasm?

It took me a year and half to have an orgasm post op. I had tried a bunch of times before, but i think I wasn&#39;t yet ready or comfortable with myself and was unable to.
<br>
Finally I broke through the wall so to speak and was able to have a mind blowing orgasm. Now I have them regularly and it&#39;s great.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard of other women taking far less time than I did, however I&#39;m on a huge amount of medication for Bipolar Disorder that really gets in the way.

Take your time and find the pleasure that you are experiencing now. Those sensations can be so satisfying on their own, at least they are to me.

I’m about 19 months post op. My doctor told me to start exploring my new anatomy at about 4-6 weeks. It felt amazing but also overwhelming. It took me a few months before I had my first orgasm. It was weak and I think that had a lot to do with numbness from surgery. Gradually that subsided and I have had some super intense orgasm now, though they are still difficult for me to achieve. I’ve found that taking it slowly works best for me.

I def avoided rubbing my clit during the first 6 month because it was painful, I think the internal stitches were still healing? Finally had my first orgasm at 157 days after the surgery lol and it only happened from vaginal vibrator and clitoral vibrator. If you&#39;re worried, I would wait. When I finally orgasmed I masturbated every time I dilated to the point I had to stop for a week to let my clit heal and regain some sensation. She&#39;s all good haha, had a gyno appointment recently and my whole vagina is healthy and cute.

I couldn&#39;t wait. I scoured reddit and susans and found reports of girls rubbing them out at 5-6 weeks so I followed suite around 5 weeks. Took a while to reach orgasm, maybe 2-3 hours but was the most intense experience I&#39;ve ever had. I immediately went back for more. My clit engorged a little and the pain turned quite pleasurable. I rubbed above my clit hood. So use lots of lube and go slow and careful. Good luck with the blast off! Vaginal assisted orgasms...youve gotta wait for full healing for that!
