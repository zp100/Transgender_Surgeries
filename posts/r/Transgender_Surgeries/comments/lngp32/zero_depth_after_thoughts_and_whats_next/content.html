I was contemplating a zero depth as well, primarily for medical reasons. I&#39;m older (in my 60s) and have both breathi9ng and heart issues. In the end, I chose full depth because I didn&#39;t know what my future held and I wanted to make sure that I was fully comfortable in my own body.

This seems to be a recurring theme. You&#39;re right, why go through this kind of surgery twice? I&#39;m not surprised that you feel differently after your surgery. It&#39;s a wonderful feeling and you bring a good message. Choose wisely and think long term.

It&#39;s actually a great time to for surgery options right now. The landscape has changed dramatically in the last 6- 7 yeara.  Best of luck to you moving forward and let us know how it goes.

Thanks for posting this. I&#39;ve always figured I&#39;d go the zero depth route too. I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m much older than you and that&#39;s played a major part in thinking that way. But maybe that&#39;s just an excuse. I figure I won&#39;t have the time and finances to go the two step procedure you are going.
</p>
<p>
I think I might have to give the idea of full GCS a little more thought before making a final decision. I think that&#39;s what I&#39;d really prefer, but it seems harder overall and scares me a little. Thanks again.💗

I had zero depth gcs in 2019, and I am happy with my decision. I am ace, and in a relationship with my ace wife. I felt zero depth was the best decision also because I have Crohn&#39;s disease and was in a mini flare at the time. The idea of having my bowel nicked or something else happening did not appeal to me, and the healing time is much less. Also, a bonus - no dilating.

A really important part of the journey of transition is to be open to change. What you desire, what you are attracted to, who you are in relation to others (romantically and platonically), all of this can and does change for many during transition. Before HRT and GCS, I was sooo sure that I was a lesbian, I had only been attracted to women, I had been married to a woman before coming out.. but I was very insecure and dysphoric and avoided physical intimacy even after being on HRT for a while. But once I had GCS (full depth, thankfully) and the cloud of dysphoria began to lift, I realized that no, I&#39;m not a lesbian, actually I really prefer to date men (and to be penetrated by them). I would encourage anyone reading this who is considering surgery to please keep an open mind and be open to changes, don&#39;t close doors if you don&#39;t have to. We are in the process of finding ourselves for the first time and it takes years and we often end up becoming different people than our prior selves could have imagined, but in a really beautiful and wholesome way.

Good advice. When making decisions that will last a lifetime it&#39;s often better to keep options open if possible.

Thank you for posting this. I was never really contemplating a 0 depth, however I was thinking about having a minimal depth one performed. I’m still not economically close enough to achieve this dream, but I will someday I hope ! And reading this is definitely helpful 💗

I honestly, if the option is available, would at least have minimal depth.

Some really great thoughts here.  I had zero depth 6 weeks ago, and can relate to a lot of what you’re talking about.
</p>
<p>
GCS has brought about a LOT of changes in how I feel about and see myself.  The lack of bottom dysphoria is life changing, for the first time in 10 years I no longer feel like there’s an asterisk to my gender identity for example.  But a part of that is that I’ve been better able to understand my own sexuality.  I thought I was lesbian, but the truth is I’m bi and suddenly the idea of vaginal penetration seems like something I’d be more interested in than before.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, I honestly still don’t see myself getting a vaginal canal installed.  Im pretty happy so far and don’t feel too keen about going through surgery again, even if I could get it covered and afford it.  But I feel like anyone considering zero-depth needs to know they should REALLY do their soul searching about what they want, and make sure this is it.
</p>
<p>
Also something that should get mentioned IMO, js that even though healing is certainly quicker and easier than full-depth, don’t go for it assuming you’ll be fine inside a month and it’s no big deal.  I’ve had a pretty typical recovery and my surgeon is happy with how things look overall: no complications during the surgery and only some easily treatable common issues in healing so far(some wound separation, a small bit of granulation).  But after 6 weeks I still can’t sit up straight in a chair or cross my legs or really do much more than walk around, and still have a ton of swelling and quite a bit of discomfort when moving around.  Stitches and knots are still coming out, and potholes when I’m in the car suuuck.  If I weren’t unemployed and didn’t live with family, I have no clue how I’d get through this whole thing.
</p>
<p>
Make no mistake: no matter what surgery you go for, it’s still massive surgery with a very lengthy healing process.  Make your decision, and go into surgery, with that in mind.

I can relate to not crossing legs after 6 weeks... that took more than 4 months. Even now at 6 months there is still swelling so crossing legs is comfortable but I can still feel it.  As for sitting up, I was able to after week two pretty easily. However long sitting was too much. Riding in the car I didnt feel much great about so I avoided that.
</p>
<p>
You are right though, surgery is surgery and everyone handles it differently.  When they tell you to do PT, do it.  I didnt think I needed it but ended up benefiting greatly feom it!

Glad I’m not alone in the whole crossing your legs thing!   My mobility and flexibility is just super shitty in general due to the swelling and how it puts pressure on my clit.

Do it every night if not more often. They wanted me to do it three times a day for 15 min but that was near impossible. So I did it for an hour at night. Usually fell asleep like that hehe.

I will, thanks for the instructions!  Also, I totally fell asleep with ice on my crotch the second night I got home.  It was on there for like 4 hours and I got so freaked out that I’d hurt myself because of how numb everything was, lol.  Reminded me of the time I fell asleep with my shoulder out of its socket(I’m hypermobile), and woke up completely unable to feel or move my arm.

It sounds weird, but it&#39;s a specific fish found in Brazil called the tilapia. It&#39;s skin is morphologically similar to ours, and has been used to treat burn wounds before being used in vaginoplasty.

Like you my main concern was my lifelong dysphoria. I was strongly considering going zero depth. I thought that as a trans woman who, to be honest, doesn’t pass all that well, I wasn’t likely to attract any gay or bi women.   My therapist said “you’re a catch” and suggested I think it through thoroughly.
</p>
<p>
Although I feel certain I wouldn’t have regretted getting zero depth I’m so glad now that I went for the full vaginoplasty. So is my girlfriend. Speaking solely for myself, it was worth the extra time, healing and I’m sure expense.

Yeah - I was so down with dysphoria I just needed something and that at the time was ALL I wanted.  I had no interest in needing to dilate, zero interest in penetration, I just needed it. So I went for it. I had zero expectations as to what it would actually do for my dysphoria...and certainly no thought that it would almost eliminate it and cause me to feel so good and actually make me want more...I had no idea there was a feeling of wanting more. I love having this feeling and I want to pursue it! 😊

I had zero-depth on Jan. 21.   Still happy with it, but still recovering.

Curious what were the primary reasons why you feel more comfortable now with the full gcs vs zero depth. I too have thoughts of the zero depth because I am afraid of the recovery time

Initially I was fearful of complications in general, wasng interested in dilating, have a very busy job, and was really only working to diminish my bottom dysphoria as it was crippling.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, gcs changed me in a massive way!  I learned I can become comfortable with myself, feel great in general and best of all my bottom dysphoria has gone completely away, I stopped dissasociating almost entirely, where as before it was multiple times a day.
</p>
<p>
Never before did I have a genital feeling, but now I do and it&#39;s intensely pleasurable!  I want more now, where before I had literally zero interests. I am in a financial position and a super stable job that fully supports my needs, so I feel if I will ever do this I&#39;m better off to do it now while still somewhat young.
</p>
<p>
I dont regret my initial decision, and I would be happy still if I didnt get the canal.
</p>
<p>
Another unseen change was my wife - she wasn&#39;t even sure she was going to stay with me....what happened is she fell in love with the new me and we&#39;ve never had intimacy like we do now!  Sooo totally didn&#39;t expect this and now I want to explore more with her and she with me!
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer any other questions!

What is genital feeling may I ask? Is that desire or just the sense of feeling down there? Very happy for you btw!

My genitals prior to gcs didn&#39;t have a feeling and seemed very unreal to me.  They weren&#39;t a part of me so to speak and I&#39;d totally forget they were there, especially in the mornings when I&#39;d wake up after dreaming I was who I really am - I&#39;d wake up and be not sure who I was sometimes and would have to feel or see them to remember it was still there 🥺  after surgery and of course healing - theres an amazing connected feeling g to my vagina now and its very intense and quite pleasurable!
