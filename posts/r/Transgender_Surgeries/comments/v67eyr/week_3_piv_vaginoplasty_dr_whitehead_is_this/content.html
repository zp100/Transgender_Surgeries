The inner part of my vulva had a whole bunch of black tissue sloughing off of it for the first few weeks post-op. I&#39;m not 100% sure on why it does that in some places, but it&#39;ll probably be fine. If it feels like it&#39;s stuck to you, it&#39;s likely just a severe kind of scabbing as the outermost layer dies off and the underlying layer of tissue heals itself. If it&#39;s still there for longer, it might be a good idea to get your surgeon to take a look, or your primary care physician if you traveled far for your surgery. My surgeon removed what was still stuck to me a few weeks in, and it&#39;s since healed over just fine.

I&#39;m assuming what you&#39;re going through is the same thing, but I&#39;m not your doctor so take it with a grain of salt.

This looks very normal at this stage.  Clean area with mild soap and water in shower daily.  Let it air dry.  Apply bacitracin ointment to incision lines.  A blow dryer on low can help dry the area. Charlie

Lots of times the blackiz from the urethra and is normal in middle.  Some scabbing on sides and yellow-white fibrinous exudate which is normal.

When did this appear? It all likelyhood it will heal fine as its localized in small clumps as compared to a massive blob. Try to get blood flow to it by walking more though contact your surgeon ASAP. Don&#39;t stress but try to encourage blood flow to the area. Additionally book an appointment with your family doctor or ideally a gynocolognist preferably one experienced in gynocological surgeries to see as they can give you more on-demand treatments.
