hey i’m so sorry! he was amazing! everyone was so sweet and comforting. Dr.Freet came and visited me every day and gave me his personal number to make sure i’m doing okay! i’m very happy with my vagina almost 2 years out. very functional and aesthetically very natural I have never seen any scars

Ok so technically this started last year; I emailed him 3/24/2019 to try and seta consult up...he got back to me within that same day and said his assistant would call me to schedule a day... she called me 3/29/2019...we set up a date (I can’t remember) well something happened and we weren’t able to have the consult so. A few months go by and november came and so I contacted again for another consult... this time however it got cancelled bc of me...then December 11th he was out sick..so he immediately squeezed me in for the 13th (a sunday) and the consult went amazing. We talked for about an hour about the surgery and my medical background and everything...he ended up giving me his personal number in order for me to keep in contact with him....(THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN FOR YOU GUYS ) but he actually gave me a date at the end of the consult (March 6th 2020) I WAS SO HAPPY....january comes and I send in my letters and we’re all good and I also kept in contact with him throughout this time period...I think early February we had to reschedule my surgery for March 5th due to some scheduling conflict (but one extra day with my vagina  so yay! Since then not much has happened...I actually got denied from insurance bc one of my letters were too old but it’s all good I’m getting that appealed now...I have 3 more weeks until surgery so!

Im home and dilating isn’t necessarily painful it’s like a big pressure and it’s hard to get it in at first put I probably overdue it with lube so it’s easier....I don’t have the same dilators most see when using to dilate. I’m noticing I’m most of my swelling is on the top of my vagina and on my right lip.

tomorrow marks week 3: I feel normal, still swelling. dilation doesn’t hurt...occasionally burns if anything..I’m still penguin walking and sleeping on my back but i’m thinking by the time I hit 1.5 months i’ll be normal.....for anyone who’s getting this surgery GET A LOT OF PADS,WIPES, and BUY LUBE IN BULK!!!

Okay so quick add on....so mostly the staff is extremely sweet but there’s one lady (and her name isn’t coming to my mind) every time I’ve gotten in contact with her it’s seemed as if she’s had an attitude. She’s apart of the insurance dept.

I don’t know the exact number but i know he’s been doing this for a number of years and he’s had a lot of patients.. i’ve personally spoken with 2 of the other freet girls....I honestly took a gamble with going to him but I was able to go from consult in december to surgery in march. in the end it was worth it for me to go to him :) if you have any questions i’d be happy to answer/help
