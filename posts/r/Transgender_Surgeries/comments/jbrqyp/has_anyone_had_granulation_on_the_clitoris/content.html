Complications from it?
</p>
<p>
And how bad did the silver nitrate hurt?

It was dealt with silver nitrate. It hurt, but luckily it was dealt with when it wasn&#39;t too sensitive.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have any issues with it now. Healed well.

I’m think I’ve heard of it before, and the doctor said not to get it treated with silver nitrate as it risks causing damage. Wait at least a year and hope it goes away by itself.

It&#39;s actually growing, super painful, and prevents me from doing anything remotely sexual
</p>
<p>
If she recommends not treating it, this will be the end of me.  To not have a functional or passing vagina is too much.

It’s your surgeon who’s treating this I assume, so best do whatever they say.
</p>
<p>
You’re still quite early post though? I think it’s just that the risk was higher so it’s better to wait. I think the post I recall might have been Suporn, and he’s known for telling his patients not to let local doctors treat things in case they mess it up, in which case it may not be applicable to others.

I&#39;m on week 10.
</p>
<p>
The problem that doctors don&#39;t seem to understand is how not having functional genitalia for a year isn&#39;t acceptable.  Especially if a patient is in pain.  It blows my mind when they think that wait and see is acceptable, and worse that they think someone can just go live a normal life not thinking about it.
</p>
<p>
I really appreciate your advice and the suggestions everyone gives, but it&#39;s much harder hearing it from the medical team I trusted with my body.  Who promised only 4% of patients need revisions.  I really feel betrayed and doubt anything they say about my body now.
</p>
<p>
At this point, I would risk it.  I&#39;m not sure what could happen from a silver nitrate treatment, but my clitoris is already way too big and likely needs to be redone as well.

Ideally its not so much about being acceptable, but risk management. Same as having the surgery at all. Although clearly some doctors actually don&#39;t care or don&#39;t appreciate what suffering some people go though. I&#39;d probably be thinking the same thing as you - I&#39;m not good with pain, to say the least.
