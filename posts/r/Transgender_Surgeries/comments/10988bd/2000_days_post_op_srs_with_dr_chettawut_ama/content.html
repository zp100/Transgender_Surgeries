I would definitely appreciate the updated photos if you are comfortable sharing. My question would be how does it feel day to day and while you&#39;re being penetrated? (If there&#39;s a way to describe it, haha.)

Congratulations!!!
</p>
<p>
I think you’ve mentioned having stealth sex in other posts, and I just had a couple questions if you don’t mind. Have you found you’ve needed to do anything specific to avoid getting clocked (hiding the scars with hair or other methods, not letting people go down on you, etc.)? Also, did you wait an amount of time postop before starting?
</p>
<p>
I’ve had a couple of experiences in my first year of healing, but I’m mindful of the risks and would love to hear your experience!

Stealth Sex
</p>
<p>
The concept of stealth sex is a difficult one, and I fear there is much misrepresentation as to what it really means/looks like. Ultimately, there is no singular experience, and so in turn, there are no &#39;entry requirements&#39; for who can/can&#39;t have it, or indeed, for how it does/doesn&#39;t look.
</p>
<p>
There is this assumption, I think, that people either &#39;know&#39; or they &#39;don&#39;t&#39; in terms of SRS results, and that this fact is an absolute, true in all circumstances.Obviously no result, no matter how aesthetically pleasing, or functional, will, under certain standards, always be considered an assimilation of the cis vulva, and so it is fallible, in both extremes, to being considered &#39;separate&#39;. So we have to accept then that, no matter how &#39;passable&#39; is, there is some situation in which complete stealth is impossible. However, for the most part, if someone is functional post op, in that they have depth sufficient enough to comfortably accommodate a variety of penis sizes/girths, then, irrespective even of the appearance of their results, they are likely capable of having some form of stealth sex. It may be in the dark, with them wearing a burqa, but still. The functionality is enough that, appropriate to certain circumstances, and the expectations that come with them, a person meeting above requirement could have &#39;stealth&#39; sex.
</p>
<p>
Think of some, and imagine some of the things that might be conducive to creating those scenarios, and consider then how intersectional these concepts all are. For example, perhaps alcohol is involved, so people aren&#39;t as aware of wider secondary sexual characteristics as if they were sober. Perhaps the person is so passable that, irrespective of a questionable aesthetics, its beyond comprehension for their partner to question their gender history. Perhaps the person, in spite of a deep voice, has such a conventionally pleasing looking vulva that a partner attributes the other marker to them being European, or a smoker.
</p>
<p>
Now, that isn&#39;t exactly what we think of when we think of stealth sex, is it?No, we think of a cis-appearing post op trans woman, without any dubious secondary sexual characteristics, bearing her picture perfect pussy, nine inches deep, for the camera.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Thought experiment
</strong>
</p>
<p>
One form of currency is the note. Notes can be used to purchase things, right?Well, not all notes are authentic. In fact, some notes, though not authentic, are convincing enough in nature they are often used to purchase things. Comparatively, some authentic notes are worn enough through transfer that they are confused for their inauthentic counterpart, and so sometimes are denied.Given this juxtaposition, some people can never tell the difference between an authentic or inauthentic note. There are also some people who can only the difference between a good inauthentic note and a bad one, but cannot necessarily guarantee the authenticity of a particular note. Remember, it could be a good fake note.That being said, some people can always the the difference between an authentic note, and an inauthentic note, irrespective of how convincing the latter is. Further, there are also ways of gauging whether or not a note is authentic or not, and some people who are accepting the note as a form currency have access to these.By the time we get to the end of the thought experiment, what do we see?Well, that there are fake notes. That some of them are convincing enough to be accepted as a form of currency. Not always, but sometimes. Enough that many fake notes still exist, and are accepted incorrectly.We also see that the comparative efficacy is dependant upon the appearance of the fake note, and that this can be taken to various degrees.In conclusion, there are fake notes, some of which are &#39;convincing enough&#39; to function as a comparably as a form of currency as their authentic counterparts. However, that does not mean that every fake note everywhere is likely to be accepted in any given scenario.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In many ways, I think this is comparable to the concept of stealth sex, and indeed, the fascination we have with SRS results in relation to it. I have explored above how there are instances in which it doesn&#39;t always follow that stealth sex necessarily equates to what we think it does, and I think the metaphor helps us recognise this is not only an intersectional concept, but that it also falls across, and embraces a spectrum of experiences.

<p>
I hope that the above thoughts can help you contextualise some of your own feelings regarding stealth sex.
</p>
<p>
My own experience is quite unique, in that I have quite a unique degree of passing privilege due to my medical transition starting before puberty, etc. As such, I am hesitant to offer advice regarding &#39;what to do&#39; in order to achieve stealth in sex. I don&#39;t think there is a one size fits all approach. That being said, you might want to use some of the above thoughts to appraise your chances of stealth in relation to a given scenario/situation though.
</p>
<p>
I personally have never been clocked during sex, and have never really consciously done anything to prevent it from happening. That is obviously unique to me any my experience, but I think it falls down some of the lines addressed in the initial post response.

Congratulations!
<br>
If you could go back in time and PPT (Peritoneal Pull-Through Vaginoplasty) were available, would you have selected it to help with the natural lubrication? I&#39;m torn apart between skin-graft and PPT SRS now.

Thanks for this post!  I have so many questions (if you don’t mind):
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Who were your top 3 contenders for surgeons? Why did you choose Dr Chettawut ultimately?
</li>
<li>
How was the experience doing it overseas, was language a barrier?
<br>
</li>
<li>
Were facilities modern and updated?  I have a huge fear of infections etc
</li>
<li>
Were you able to orgasm afterwards and if so, how quickly?
</li>
<li>
Is there anything you wish you would’ve known beforehand?  Like any good/bad surprises?
<br>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thanks!
