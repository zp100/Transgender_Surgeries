Now that I’m quickly coming up on being 9-months post-op bottom surgery, I thought it was time I gave a little update. In addition, I’m now over 2.5 years on HRT and close to 4 months post-op my first round of FFS. I had my (penial-invertion) bottom surgery with Dr. Meredith Gray on July 21st, 2020. It was a long road working up to because of the pandemic—you can follow my GCS journey on my YouTube channel at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpjNMmGvWr8&amp;list=PLpgNLYroZZD299AOO1DB1kjLxKWoc6BXl">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpjNMmGvWr8&amp;list=PLpgNLYroZZD299AOO1DB1kjLxKWoc6BXl</a>
.
</p>
<p>
The first 2-3 months post-surgery, I had some dissatisfaction with the results. I felt it lacked sensitivity, and due to a tear in my perineum, it looked and felt weird. I went in on November 5th to get the tear addressed, and Dr. Gray did a little touchup to help with the appearance. Afterward, I was a lot happier in the appearance, and it was just a matter of waiting out the healing. I was a bit disappointed as it took me a while to figure out how to have my first orgasm—which was amazing the first time it happened.
</p>
<p>
As time went on, I thought I would figure out orgasms and how to get them to work. Looking back, I realized I had a lot of misconceptions, and that was a huge preventer of experiencing the best my new genitals had to offer. I had some casual orgasms here and there, but it felt like there was a consistent wall that was due to either a lack of sensitivity or that my brain and body were still getting the grove with each other. It was very interesting that now that the pre-optic part of my brain that I became used to using for masturbating didn’t have close to the same effect, and over time, it only got weaker, which didn’t make me feel very positive about my surgery. Over the next few months, I attempted to keep at it and dilate as prescribed—which on a positive note, I had decent depth and found it decently easy to reach that depth, unlike some girls I’ve talked to.
</p>
<p>
Then a couple of months ago, I met someone. She is a pre-op trans-woman, and we basically “
<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=u-hauling">u-hauled</a>
“ it. She moved into an empty room in my house within two days of finding each other, and not even a week later, we had admitted our deep interest in each other. We had sex one night, and it was the first time I ever had sex since my ex-wife announced her intent to leave me two years prior. I also got to experience for the first time what having a penis inside me felt like, and IT WAS AMAZING! For full transparency, that was on my second night that it was truly amazing. I was using the #2 dilator and could force with some pain the #3 (biggest) dilator in my set. The first night was a strangely a whole lot of stretching out of my vaginal canal, and to my surprise, her penis did the trick as since then it has been far less painful, and I can really tell there is even a difference in the authenticity of how it feels. My partner even claims that I felt to her felt more amazing than most of the cis-girls she had been with. I also was strangely able to reduce the frequency of my dilation to my surprise. I’m at present only needing to dilate or have sex once a week. (Keep in mind, I am keeping a close watch on my depth and ease of dilating, which I was told by Dr. Gray is the way to determine the need to dilate.)
</p>
<p>
And furthermore, there have been some other amazing changes to my vagina. My vaginal lining has been changing in texture and having natural moisture. On a few occasions, I’ve noticed having the ability to dilate without the need for lube, which is unusual for penial-inversion, but I did hear of it happening in a few cases. In the last month, there has been a major jump in the nerve sensitivity of my vulva. To the point that I noticed, I had far less of a need to directly stimulate my clitoris. And suddenly, the way to get to work up to my climax has changed as well. I’ve discovered that I can get amazing satisfaction from my vaginal canal and labia-minora. I’m finding that I much more prefer masturbation of those two areas and then a final rundown of the clitoris to finish.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I’m very happy with the results so far. I would have never guessed that my sensitivity would have returned this strong and that I could have orgasms this powerful. (I’ve also experienced that strange “inconvenience to walk” thing that girls describe post-masturbation.) If I had to be critical of Dr. Gray’s work, I would say I wish I had a bit more defined clitoral hood and labia minora. However, I plan that if it is still something I’m fully happy with after a few years, I can get a vulvaplasty to improve the appearance, but for now, I’m more than content. I will also be considering some improvements down the road, like a revision to do a partial PPV, but that won’t be for a few years until the initial fab fads.
</p>
<p>
A tip I want to leave other post-op trans-girls is to give coconut oil a try for dilating and sex. My physical therapist and Dr. Gray’s Physicians Assistant suggested it, and I could never go back. It’s naturally anti-microbial and helps with keeping that natural moisture I noticed.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me any questions you might have. And keep in mind that I’m open to talking with people over on Discord about my experience—I’m not a fan of Reddit’s chat feature. Farewell for now!

Hello, thanks for having the courage to post this. I also go to KU (live in KC). My one-year is in June (yay). Just a quick question. You said you were happy with their work, would you recommend them? I haven’t really ever head anything bad from the team there, and for general care they’re great.  Thanks! (-Claire)

I’m currently scheduled for late may 2022! And fortunately you can just get any insurance that they accept and they might be able to cover most trans related surgeries. You can find all the info online on their website

OMG I loved watching your videos! Awesome I found you here too! I have my surgery scheduled for April 17 with Dr Gray! :D I&#39;m so excited!   Your video of the day of surgery meant a lot to me. I was glad to hear what to expect in detail.

I&#39;m so happy you loved my videos so much. I need to get back on the YouTube horse and get over the disinterest struggles I&#39;ve had lately. Anyhow, I assume your surgery is still scheduled for next month if I&#39;m not mistaken. I&#39;m here to chat if you need someone.

I&#39;m so happy it&#39;s working out for you. I remember those last few days before my surgery, I was freaking out, but super excited to finally get something I wanted going back to before puberty.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m thankful I met someone on Reddit I was chatting with until moments before my surgery. She helped me a lot with staying calm and knowing what to expect. I had no family or friends at my side going into surgery. When I came out of surgery, the only person there to see me was my neighbor who supported me. My gosh! I remember so many little details, and it&#39;s incredible how those things stick with you for years.
</p>
<p>
By the way, I used to work on HC-8 (the post-op unit you&#39;ll be on after surgery), and I can help with resources and whatnot. You can find me on Discord at &#34;missameliasara&#34; if you need help, resources, or chat. I&#39;m also located in Kansas City if you need anything–I have supplies and have visited people post-op.

I finally got to see Dr. Dugi to have him repair all the damage that Grey and her team caused. Finally no longer in pain, finally look normal and pee normal, can&#39;t wait to see Dr. Dy and have my depth and bottleneck issue solved. I&#39;m not sure how a surgeon can cause the same complications in multiple patients and still be allowed to operate.

The complications. We’re they the result of negligence, incompetence…? How was you’re situation resolved? You said this has happened so many times to others. Is there a link with reviews from them?  I’ve also seen good reviews on the KU Med gcs  team and I’m just trying to gather all the information I can before taking a step I should have been forewarned about. Thank you for your time and I hope all has been satisfactorily resolved for you!

Negligence and incompetence. I was threatened by the medical assistant that they would be suing me unless I ceased talking about their work to current patients who had reached out to me. They did not care about my social situation which in all honesty should have prevented me from getting surgery but they still approved the surgery and then decided they would release me to my camp ground with no running water to recover after just 2 days in the hospital. Look at how some of the best hospitals treat their patients then look at what KU said they would do for you, they don&#39;t line up.
</p>
<p>
When I went to OHSU for a revision I was offered 3 days in the hospital covered by insurance. KU did not want to even attempt to ask my insurance for more time inpatient because they did not care and it was &#34;a social situation&#34;
</p>
<p>
I had complications as soon as I woke up that only got worse because negligent staff abusing me due to my Trans status in a ward for women only.

I am so sorry you went through this. There’s no excuse for that kind of treatment. Thank you for the heads up. I’ll need to look elsewhere.
