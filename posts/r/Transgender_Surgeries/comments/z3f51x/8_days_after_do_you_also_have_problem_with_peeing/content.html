I had urgency with peeing for a bit afterwards. I&#39;d get into the bathroom, see the toilet and be like, ah I&#39;m peeing already. I did a lot of extra laundry ðŸ˜…

Very normal to have urinary issues at first. Just give it some time, you&#39;re very early into your recovery. Swelling can play a role in difficulty as well. Just gotta learn to control those muscles and it&#39;s not going to happen immediately. You&#39;ll be totally good sooner rather than later.

This is a pretty common/normal early complication, and its just due to how bad swelling is. I had to have a cath reinserted until like the 12 or 14 day mark and it took me like 15 minutes to pee for a few days after removal (and admittedly, thats a pretty bad feeling) but it got rapidly better after. Hang in there and if you do need a cath in for a bit it&#39;ll be okay in the end.

As weird as this sounds. Standing up in the shower with cold water running on my hands worked really well at first.

Eight days is pretty soon to hope for normalcy. I am almost five months and sometimes still pee all over. Eight days after surgery I had a window of five minutes between first inkling and incontinence. Bladder and bowel.
</p>
<p>
I had a ten hour plane trip home eleven days post-op. Wore Depends and sat on a changing pad. Made it home safe, but had a few anxious moments.

Two Tramadol five hours later two more. I know I took some OxyContin too but my memory is shaky. My partner was with me for safety.
