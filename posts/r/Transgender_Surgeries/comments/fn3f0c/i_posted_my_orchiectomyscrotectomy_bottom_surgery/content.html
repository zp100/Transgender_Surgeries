I posted my orchiectomy/scrotectomy bottom surgery last month and was thrilled. I am now in a hospital after developing a complicated infection. I now have to heal with an open wound for 4 to 8 weeks instead of sutureed up. ( NSFW )

My original post at end.
</p>
<p>
Here is imagery of my orchiectomy and scrotectomy complication, and how I am required to heal from here out.
</p>
<p>
What you are looking at is my procedure post complication. I had surgery last month on the 20th for the actual orchiectomy and scrotectomy. This is not that photo. These photos are after my second surgery to deal with the complication, which was an infection that began to collect fluid and swell.
</p>
<p>
Before I link this I will say that I just talked to my surgeon and they are pleased. They have not seen anything bad in the cultures yet, however it is not diagnosed further enough to be giving me a broad spectrum antibiotic. That will come soon and hopefully that may allow me to venture into less cleanly areas, like going home. Please keep in mind that I am not able to see my partner because of the viral outbreak. No visitors are allowed in the hospital and I might be here for 2 months.
</p>
<p>
However after seeing this myself I would rather be in this hospital for 8 weeks and completely sterile then go through what I&#39;ve gone through a third time.
</p>
<p>
I have been told by Dr Chouhan who did the surgery at OHSU in Portland Oregon that this will heal and look the same as it would have healing without complications and sutured up.
</p>
<p>
The dark brown spots you see inside of me are where they cauterized little leaks. Overall this is healthy, albeit gross and scary looking, according to her.
</p>
<p>
frankly I am just stressed to the f*** out and scared and tired. I also majorly hurt my back before this complication happened, so while I was recovering from my initial surgery I lost the ability to walk and sit without pain. 20/10 pain. It has been a really emotional and rough two weeks for me. My euphoria has completely dissipated.
</p>

I had a surgery (unrelated to any trans surgeries) where I had a similarly sized open wound that had to heal over several weeks. I know it sucks, and it&#39;s terrifying, but you&#39;ll be amazed at your body&#39;s ability to rapidly heal and close the wound. Hang in there!

My heart goes out to you. Focus on the good news -- it&#39;ll be a rough time but you&#39;ll leave without any loss on your results. And hopefully the situation with the virus will be a lot better when you go back home.
</p>
<p>
And thanks for the courage in posting. Complications do happen and we gotta be prepared.
</p>
<p>
A million rainbow, cheerful, flower-scented vibes to you. &lt;3

Indeed! For now...

I have a feeling I might be more comfortable amongst a lot of cat hair, dog hair and my own mess very soon.

So sorry to hear!  I am still on for mine in two weeks but my fear is having a complication and not having available care due to the virus.....
</p>
<p>
I hope it all works out fine for you!

That&#39;s pretty much what happened to me except my doctor and I waited almost six months before going back in, excising the necrotic tissue, and packing the site. I was able to do this all outpatient though by going into the wound care center every other day. Then it only took six weeks to heal up fine.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t envy you being in the hospital right now though. Good luck. Sending you positive vibes.

You know, it&#39;s fine right now and it&#39;s actually very empty here so I feel pretty good about being away from any contamination. Portland is pretty gross on its own anyway lol.
</p>
<p>
But I am giving covid 19 about 5 days before Oregon becomes a mess. Washington and California are major hot spots and there&#39;s only us in between. NYC is going to be out of hospital beds by April they say, and the president has done nothing to reply to New York officials pleads.

POTUS can&#39;t be responsible for the criminal incompetence of NYS Governor and the completely useless NYC Mayor.
<br>
People keep forgetting that most politics are local and that POTUS isn&#39;t the national governor/mayor/county executive.
</p>
<p>
President He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, has been pretty proactive with closing the borders, sharing updates and releasing $$$ and resources to the states.  What more can POTUS do???
</p>
<p>
In the end it&#39;s really up to state &amp; local health agencies rather than Washington.  The blame game can wait till this blows over in a few months, it&#39;s not helping.

Are you kidding??? The difference between the states response and federal response is night and day. Our chief executive is a completely incompetent baffoon. He was elected by drooling idiots and has surrounded himself with those same people. He has recieved security briefings for months but did nothing to prepare on the national level. Because of this failure an event that could have been managed is threatening to spiral out of control.

No doubt I will. This has been a pretty rough time for me.
</p>
<p>
If any other introverts out there are bored amidst this pandemic and want to befriend me on Facebook, I am posting a lot about this journey there. I am basically left to browse my phone all day.
</p>
<p>
I have had a lot to think about in the last few weeks. I have fully come clean about much of my transition to my friends and family. I explained a lot of really extreme mistakes I made because of my dysphoria.
</p>
<p>
(I&#39;ll give you a content warning right now for my Facebook page I talk a lot about my past which involves rape and abuse and self-harm. Also I often disregard rules about being topless.) And if I may toot my own horn for a moment, frankly I&#39;ve had a pretty interesting life and I think that hour and a half video below might be very interesting for many people. My dysphoria took me to some crazy places....
</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
I am not one to worry about anonymity. My naked ass is all over the internet and I&#39;m not connected with family. If you like making digital friends, I would love new company.

I shut down my FB 4 weeks ago to help weather this storm, but I will in time bring it back online....

It actually doesn&#39;t look too bad. I know it sucks to have to have an open wound, but it&#39;ll heal. All the best for you!

I don&#39;t know why the hell everyone is down voting this. It&#39;s very optimistic and thank you. And you&#39;re right, it does not look that bad right now it&#39;s just gory and people aren&#39;t used to seeing it.
</p>
<p>
The infection is taken out and that is what matters.
</p>
<p>
I got some good news about my back today too so things are starting to look slightly less bleak.

I did mean it with good intentions. I&#39;ve seen my share of open wounds. But people being people, I guess.
</p>
<p>
Indeed what matters is that the infection is taken care of. Rest is just waiting and waiting. But once everything&#39;s healed up the time spent doesn&#39;t matter that much.
</p>
<p>
And gratz for the good news about your back!

Just be as healthy as possible and demand that they give you antibiotics the day the surgery is over. There was no protocol to give antibiotics post these procedures for the hospital I am in. So maybe that wad what my problem was. But I also decided to start combusting weed one day after my pain got really bad instead of just vaping it like I had been doing. And that was also the day that stuff started to become infected so maybe I was at fault. I do not know, but as far as fighting infections and being ready for surgery, just be as healthy as you can be, be the weight you want to be before you have the surgery, drink water all the time and eat three balanced meals a day.
</p>
<p>
But again I&#39;ve been seen a few times now by the urologist and they say it looks very good It&#39;s just scary

oh i’ve already had surgery. they didn’t give me any antibiotics which makes me worried. i guess if you noticed infection shortly after surgery then i’m good? i haven’t noticed anything except for a little swelling.

Yeah just keep an eye out for things like redness getting deeper, swelling starting back up again, discharge that is pussy or green or brown or yellow possibly, but even then if it doesn&#39;t smell bad sometimes it&#39;s just your body working through healing.
</p>
<p>
I had a very complicated package down there for many reasons, I have had past complications and whatnot so I think most people will not experience what I have.

I&#39;m so sorry to hear that you&#39;re going through all of this. I saw your original post a month ago and I was really happy and excited for you.  I wish you a quick recovery and I hope you feel like your old self again soon!
