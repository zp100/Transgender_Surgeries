The short story: my surgeon recommended not getting hair removal prior surgery, and now I have hair growing inside my vagina, so I&#39;m looking for an electrolysis provider that could help me take care of it (travelling back to the surgeon for their staff to do the electrolysis isn&#39;t financially doable).
</p>
<p>
Does anyone know a provider that can help in the Philly/NYC/Boston area? Or some other train accessible city in that general area?

Thanks! Is the place named &#34;Cirine Hair Removal &amp; Skin Care&#34;? That what came up when searching &#34;precision hair removal Chicago&#34;. Hopefully someone knows someone a bit closer, flying back &amp; forth every 6 weeks for a year is a tall order :/
</p>
<p>
And yeah I definitely agree with the &#34;always always get hair removal prior&#34; advice, I wish I&#39;d heard it back then.

I hear a lot of people say that their surgeons don&#39;t require electrolysis because they do follicle scrape. I had twenty electro sessions and my surgeon did follicle scrape. I have no hairs where they shouldn&#39;t be. It was a weekly painful process for months that I don&#39;t regret in the slightest.

I also have never understood not doing ANYTHING. My surgeon looked me over and said he wanted 9 laser sessions because my hair and skin made me a good candidate. He said follicle scraping is good, but the less hair you have going into it, the more likely you won&#39;t have regrowth. They wouldn&#39;t even schedule until I was confirmed doing LHR.
</p>
<p>
I did the 9 sessions across 9 months and was left with a minimal amount of really thin, white hairs that popped up just prior to surgery, to which he said that the PA would be able to easily finish what little was left via scraping.
</p>
<p>
To me, that makes sense - use scraping to finish off the few stragglers, not be the main method of removal.

I agree. My surgeon advised 3 sessions of laser (ppv), but I delayed to do electrolysis first. Be safe than… you know

Papillon Center in New Hope PA might be able to help. It&#39;s Doctor McGinn&#39;s place and they do surgery prep electrolysis, so it may be worth reaching out to ask

I can definitely recommend them in general, although I don&#39;t know if they specialize in post-op electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
They definitely insisted on having the site cleared out before she did the surgery (PIV), and I&#39;ve had no issues with internal hair growth post-op.

They hired some new electrolysis techs in April and are seeing patients whether they are having surgery with McGinn or not. They&#39;re offering facial electrolysis too last I asked

That&#39;s  weird. If it&#39;s the one by Giant I went to them like 8 years ago and got called a man by a customer as they left and the electrolysist was so rough with my face it took like over a month for it to heal.
</p>
<p>
She was talking to me and randomly asked if i wanted to get my genital area done (it was a hot topic in the news at the time about trans people &#34;forcing/insisting&#34; store owners to serve them or something) and when I said &#34;idk eventually i guess&#34; she snapped back &#34;
<em>
well we don&#39;t do that here. You have to go somewhere else. I think it&#39;s wrong that people try to force women to work on men/penis holders. You can try up the street a little they might help you
</em>
&#34; or something like that. It was so incredibly weird... like i didn&#39;t even ask.
</p>
<p>
I went to a nice lady in NJ after that and that&#39;s when I learned that PA does not have a license program for electrolysis.

The place is run by a trans woman surgeon who performs SRS so I don&#39;t think you had that experience at Papillon

there were two hair removal places right by the Giant when I went there way back when. I guess it was the other one. It was the one closer to the parking lot entrance off the main hwy

You may not be able to remove it anyway. It’s very difficult to perform electrolysis at depth.

I&#39;m really sorry you&#39;re having this issue. Did your doctor tell you they were going to perform follicle scraping and that&#39;s why you didn&#39;t need the hair removal? Also, how long ago did you have your surgery that it became an issue now?

Yes, Dr. recommended against hair removal and did perform scraping. The surgery was 8 years ago, no idea why it only became an issue ~6 months ago.
