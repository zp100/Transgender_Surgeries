Hi there:)  The recovery is hard ! Idk my experience maybe one of kind because of my body reaction to the morphine  The result I canâ€™t judge now ( mine was very swollen after the surgery )  There is a girl who did her surgery in Netherlands too but different hospital she had her result showing  mine look scarier now because of the wounds etc but I can totally imagine the end result could be the same or similar because if I did not had the swollen the post op incision etc look the same  ONE WORD OF ADVICE  Be ðŸ’¯ ready after the hospital that someone will help you. You can ask them for nurse . And I hope your wc is in the same room as your badkamer . Will make things easier
