Is FFS just a bunch of surgeries at once? As much as i want it, I know there&#39;s no way I can afford it all and I dont think any insurance in Michigan covers it.
</p>
<p>
Is there any objective downside to kinda just splitting us FFS into individual surgeries?
</p>
<p>
Obvioudly there&#39;s always risks when it comes to going under with anesthesia and having to deal with the recovery more often. But is this an option when I only have a little bit to spend?

It is just a bunch of surgeries and you can do them separately, however, there are advantages to typically pairing them up. As some have said upper face and lower face are common ways of splitting it up. This makes a lot of sense because upper face work often used the same incision as does jaw/chin work. Rhinoplasty is often combined with forehead feminization because when you modify the glabella you made to change the radix of the nose to ensure the nasofrontal angle is aesthetically pleasing.

Sadly, you&#39;re correct that Michigan insurance do not cover it. However, if you work at University of Michigan amd have Blue Cross Blue Shield, they will. Only if you work there and no other way for insurance to pay.

You can definitely have whatever surgeries at whatever time. There’s no specific set of surgeries you must get. There are surgeries, however that people pair together to make sure there’s consistency such as the jaw and chin, or the forehead and nose.

Downside from splitting things up is higher cost and multiple recovery periods. I personally would save up to get at least all the top half of face or bottom half of face procedures done. Splitting up FFS into more than two procedures is a mistake in most circumstances.
