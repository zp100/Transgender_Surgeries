I&#39;d speak to your surgeon and/or a doctor, that&#39;s quite a large area to be inflamed like that, plus the swelling along the raphe line and irritation to the labia would also concern me (though I also had swelling along the raphe early on, just from a result of the surgery).
</p>
<p>
Did you have some kind of dehiscence or necrosis at the base of your labia or has that also been caused by this &#39;irritation&#39;?

I did have a little dehiscence but it&#39;s healing and wasn&#39;t caused by this.

I would definitely let a dermatologist take a proper look.
</p>
<p>
Someone brought up a fungi, which would be possible and be easily treatable with the right topical cream. Also make sure to bring pictures of every medication and supply you have used to take care of your vulva post op. It might even just be that you react allergically to something in the lube. If it&#39;s allergic it&#39;s also possible to try Antihistamines and that should get rid of the itchiness really quickly.

I would agree. Iâ€™ve had a couple since beginning HRT and this is exactly how they start. Topical anti fungal cream works for me but definitely ask your doctor about the open wound.

I&#39;ve been using aquaphor as well as anti itch cream and a steroid cream  to try to control it and it kind of works but it gets really hard to resist scratching and when I do it swells up and gets red as you can see in the pics.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not just vulva either, it&#39;s right under my butt, my anus, etc. The whole area. I can&#39;t figure out why it&#39;s happening.
</p>
<p>
Slightly related but below my vulva the skin feels thick and tough, I&#39;m guessing that will go away but not sure.

Possible fungi infection?
<br>
If that&#39;s the case, stop eating all type of carbohydrates, and treat the area with antifungal cream.
<br>
I was thinking of fungi, because of the itching.
</p>
<p>
Let hear other opinions.

KETO will help with fungi infections elimination (if this is one, please, talk to a dermatologist) all over the body, as this diet will starve the fungi from it&#39;s food, which is surplus glucose.
<br>
I hope, this make sense. :-)
</p>
<p>
Wish you a speedy recovery!

<p>
If it is possible, please, keep us updated.

I think you&#39;re not supposed to use steroid creams on open wounds or infected skin!

Probably early yeast. Clean area very well with soap and water, rinse well, pat dry . Then apply rubbing alcohol with clean gauze,pat dry.  Use hair dryer on low to get air and dry area. Clean cotton panties, change liner often, dry vagina and perineum with hair dryer.

This sounds and looks like a sensitivity to something youâ€™re using.
</p>
<p>
Are there ingredients in the aquaphor that youâ€™re possibly allergic to?
</p>
<p>
Also. A lot of post op women struggle a little bit with hemorrhoids after surgery. (Could explain the itch and burn) There could also be a slight infection from not being able to clean super well after using the bathroom - if youâ€™re not already, use flushable wipes for the next while.
</p>
<p>
And an inflamed raphe line is indicative of a few things - but nothing serious. Like, muscle injury (surgery), standing for too long, straining, trying to lift weights too soon after surgery, etc.
