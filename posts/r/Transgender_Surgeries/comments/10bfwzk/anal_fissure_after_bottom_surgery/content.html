Hi all, haven&#39;t been able to find much info related specifically to bottom surgery even though I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s a relatively common complication.
</p>
<p>
I had penile inversion vaginoplasty about 7 weeks ago. Everything is healing relatively well but for the last three weeks I&#39;ve had an anal fissure. It took me about a week to realise it probably wasn&#39;t hemorrhoids and to start using a topical nitroglycerine recommended by a pharmacist (I couldn&#39;t get out of the house with the pain so my gf went to ask for me), about another week to get a home doctor to check and confirm, basically recommending I continue with the ointment and adding a hemorrhoid suppository to help with healing/lubrication, as well as stool softeners and to continue with fibre supplements + increased fluids. It&#39;s been another week since then and while the pain hasn&#39;t been quite as bad, the blood after bowel movements seems worse and I was only able to make it to two of my four shifts for my first week back at work which is really frustrating.
</p>
<p>
Just wanted to see if anyone had any further insights or recommendations. I was using sitz baths to try promoting healing but the doctor said it&#39;s probably not significantly helpful and it does take a lot out of my day, while putting pressure on the area too. It can hurt back there when I dilate so I&#39;m not really able to as much as I&#39;d like either. I&#39;m a bit worried that maybe my surgeon has pulled everything up inside a bit too tight, as we didn&#39;t use any skin grafts for my surgery due to me having sufficient tissue and not being too fussed with depth (uncircumcised, young, only been on t blockers 2.5 years, no orchiectomy before surgery and wasn&#39;t particularly small beforehand). Is this a thing that can happen? I have a phone consult with him in a little over a week. I just really don&#39;t want this to turn into a chronic issue and I&#39;m going a bit crazy from finally recovering in one area, only for another issue to arise. I&#39;m also worried I&#39;ll have to have surgery to alleviate the fissure and I don&#39;t think I can go through another procedure right now.
</p>
<p>
Update: It finally healed after sticking to a routine of using the GTN ointment 3-4 times a day, lubricating suppository twice a day, using a bidet/wet wipes instead of wiping, a poop stool, stool softeners before bed, and dropping the fiber supplements which I suspect were actually bulking my stool too much. I also used a technique that I think helped a lot more than I thought it would where you basically hold the tear together while going to the toilet with a gloved hand by gently pushing up on it through the whole movement. Safe to say I am so relieved and going back to work has been a lot easier.

They are the worst. I found nitroglycerin to be a real help. [It&#39;s a Treatment specifically for anal fissure]. It works by relaxing the muscles and makes things easier when you need to &#39;&#39;go&#39;&#39;. Unsure which country you are in but it may be available without a script.
</p>
<p>
Also - light walking helps. As it reduces overall inflammation while the fissure heals.
</p>
<p>
Hope it works out.

Yeah I&#39;ve been using this for the past two weeks. Definitely helps with the spasms but not sure if it&#39;s healing

It&#39;s difficult to really know how well it&#39;s healing although your pain is a good indication. Mine really began improving with light walking and exercise i.e yoga and low impact aerobics. But I understand your also healing from grs. Hope it gets better for you. As it can really be painful.

Try to warm-hot water,1 tsp salt and 8 drop herbal calendula tincture mix them and Saturate a cloth with the mixture and hold it against the hemorroids area until the cloth is cool. Repeat every hour until the swelling goes down.
