My case was unique, since I had to switch my healthcare insurance. My previous insurance would only cover 70% instead of the entire procedure. This caused a delay, because switching insurances takes a few months to take in effect. Normally I would’ve only had to wait 4 months from the consult/intake to the surgery. For me it was 8 months.

Which insurance provider if I may ask? I also live in the NL. If you don&#39;t feel comfortable sharing, maybe send me in private message...? I have VGZ and I don&#39;t have a great experience with them so far.

Oh I’m alright sharing it publicly. I was with ARS and switched to Zilveren Kruis. My new insurance also covers the first 13 laser sessions for my face, which is perfect because I still have to get that done.

Thank you so much! Super valuable info. I got VGZ to cover 6 sessions in total or something... now they are telling me that some cis women also have to shave so that is totally normal. Cynical af. Not the first time I hear something good about Zilver Kruis too!

I got VGZ to cover 6 laser hair removal sessions in total and no more ... For the second round they are telling me that some cis women also have to shave so that is totally normal and I should wax it if I don&#39;t like the prominent shadow. Granted I payed for myself many sessions before so it doesnt look like I only had 6 sessions - that would be really nothing in my case. However, still right under my nose in the middle and my below my lips I have blue shadow right after shaving because I have very thick dark hairs and relatively pale skin.
</p>
<p>
They are allowed to refuse the second round of hair removal so they will refuse it in every case as far as I know no matter the results and you have to try to convince them (get the help of
<a href="http://Transvisie.nl" rel="nofollow">Transvisie.nl
</a>
for that) but it works in the rarest of cases. I definately want to switch before I apply for FFS because there is a lot of wiggle room legally for them.

Thank you for posting about dr. Kanhai, I would like to hear more about your experience and thoughts about him. I’m a transdude myself, but I’m thinking about having phalloplasty with dr. Kanhai.

Yes, he’s a great doctor and know’s what he’s doing. There’s hardly any info on his results though, the only source being his website

Thanks so much, I can recommend his clinic for sure! Yes insurance issues can be cause for delay, so it&#39;s best to check now how well SRS is covered by it and if MKV has experience with your insurance.

Great, their information evening can be very nice. They share a lot on what they do and even show surgical pics. Very informative.
</p>
<p>
Sucks that OHRA is so difficult, luckily there&#39;s plenty of insurances that are more trans-friendly!

Thanks babe!! I think about posting as well,
</p>
<p>
As to your estheatics, i truly believe your will heal beautifully, i think you just have a little asymmetrical swelling around your vagina opening, i had A LOT of asymmetrical swelling in my boobs the first weeks en now 10 weeks PO they are almost symmetrical (i had my boobs done at Dr. Xander Bakker, huge recomendation)
</p>
<p>
With my consultation with dr Kanhai he said it will take at least 3 months and up to a year for it to start looking cute, and not for it looking like a &#34;massacre&#34;
</p>
<p>
Again good luck with healing!! Id love an update in the future

Great to hear that it healed so well for you, I’m hoping it’s the same for me and it’s just swelling, but I’m still skeptical for now. Yeah I’m sure it’ll take a while before it looks somewhat normal, thanks so much! :)

Oh wow looks great and the colour looks good too girl! Im also from the netherlands and am doing my process through the VUMC. I saw in the comments you mentioned like 4/8 months waiting time but ive been told ill have to wait 2 years.
</p>
<p>
Do you have to contact Dr. Kanhai through their own praktijk to get surgery this quick :o?

Yesss, Kanhai has his own clinic called Medische Kliniek Velzen which has it’s own waitlist.
</p>
<p>
VUmc takes a lot longer, because more people go to them for the prodecure. You can check out Kanhai’s website at
<a href="http://www.teamkanhai.com" rel="nofollow">www.teamkanhai.com
</a>
and send them an Email if you’re interested in going to an information evening. You will need another referral from your psychologist, but it should be a lot faster than VUmc!

That’s amazing! Did you get any info about how much it would cost for somebody who doesn’t have one? I don’t live in NL unfortunately

Hm I really wouldn’t know. Maybe you can reach out to them and ask? I’m sure they’d be happy to let you know.

I will probably also do my vaginoplasty at Dr Kanhai, so it&#39;s very encouraging that it looks so great ❤️

haay OP thank u for posting this. i actually was in the VUMC last week to ask if there was other surgeons that did this kind of surgery in the netherlands. and got Dr. kanhai recommended. with a warning that i need to ask about there after care since according to the VUMC it can be lacking. so as if it is a miracle here u are posting about them. can u please inform me how the after care was and how long it was before they send u home ? and if u needed to reach them for questions or more aftercare how that went ? i am hoping Dr kanhai may be able to help me. since after 7 years of waiting for the VUMC i recently got told they forgot/made a error to put me on a wait list for the srs wich has led me to thinking of sueing them and going to another surgeon. friendly greetings from a dutch sister ♡

I’ll be making a seperate post later today when I have the time!
</p>
<p>
I had the same thing happen with VUmc. I had to move houses while I was waiting for the first intake (had been waiting for 3+ years already) and I hadn’t heard from them. Decided to email them, only to discover they mailed me a physical letter to my old address and the current owner of my old home didn’t bother to send it to me. So VUmc just assumed I wasn’t interested anymore, because I didn’t respond to a PHYSICAL letter in the MAIL. Is it the 20th century…? So I got pissed off, apparently I was already able to have my first intake with them more than a year prior, but they didn’t bother calling me or emailing me about it. Still salty about it to this day lmao. God bless Dr. Kanhai!

Great result! I’m so happy for you!🫶🏻 Hope the healing progress is going well! I’m happy to hear that everything works properly at this stage! Is also one of the reasons I choose Kanhai.
</p>
<p>
I love to hear about your expressions in the clinic it self! Last oktober I had my first consultation and I needed to lose some weight (97kg -&gt; 90kg or less). I reach the desired weight last januari. At the moment I’m 86,7kg. But unfortunately my psychologist is out of the running. I have an other therapist now, but Kanhai wants to be sure that there are no others issues that I need to address first. (There’s not) So, I have to wait a little longer and have some conversation with my new therapist. Who’s already said it’s just a formality. Then I good to go😄 Hope to have green light with the next MDO, early may. Waiting over 6 months now.😕 But I stay positive and to see results from him helps👏🏻

Healing doesn’t happen in a lineair line, so I wouldn’t try to compare too much. We might end up with a similar result! :)

It’s sort of like the Thai method, but Kanhai uses his own technique for some things. He’s pretty innovative, which I like a lot!

Hi, has your perineum swelling decreased? Something similar happened to me but now the skin just seems to get more loose.

I honestly don’t know yet, I hope there’s an option for revision if necessary. The process went great, for me atleast. I was well informed and the staff was very nice!

Great results! Early June, I&#39;m setting up the referral with my psychiatrist, and I&#39;m also looking at MKV.  Would definitely appreciate your story/more info on MKV.
