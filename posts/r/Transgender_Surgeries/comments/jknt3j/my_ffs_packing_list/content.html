<p>
I just finished FFS - it went great! Because it was a new experience for me, I wasn&#39;t sure what to pack and I benefited from people sharing their lists on here. I thought I should share my own for the benefit of future generations.
</p>
<p>
A couple of notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I won&#39;t include things my surgeon (DB) told me to bring (like probiotics) or obvious things (like my id).
</li>
<li>
I traveled to a different city, but I drove so I could take a lot of stuff.
</li>
<li>
A lot of these items could have been obtained after I arrived. Some I snagged from the hospital.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
Ok, let&#39;s get started!
</strong>
</p>
<h2>
Nutrition
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Ready-to-drink HUEL:
</strong>
this was what I used for my liquid diet. It worked well. The ready-to-drink was very convenient because I didn&#39;t have anyone to make shakes for me. I wish I&#39;d gotten more flavors. I drank four bottles per day.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Bottled water:
</strong>
You&#39;ll need to drink a lot of water. Having a case of bottled water was really handy. It&#39;s also sterile so it&#39;s better for cleaning incisions than tap water.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
A small (8 oz) reusable cup:
</strong>
With swollen lips and jaw it&#39;s hard to tilt your head back. A small cup is much easier to drink from than a bottle or larger cup.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Medical
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Medication log sheets:
</strong>
I had to write down all my meds. I used post-its. It would have been nice to have real medication log sheets.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Salt:
</strong>
For making saltwater to rinse your mouth after eating.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Stool Softener:
</strong>
After surgery you will probably be constipated. These can help ease you back to normal.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Qtips:
</strong>
for cleaning sutures
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Kleenex:
</strong>
I like the travel packs.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Medical tape and small soft gauze pads:
</strong>
If you have your nose done they&#39;ll send you home with a little drip pad to catch draining fluids. If it fills up, you&#39;ll want to change it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Vaseline:
</strong>
When you have to breathe through your mouth, your lips get dry. Regular chapstick was too hard for my swollen lips.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Humidifier:
</strong>
When you&#39;re sleeping you will want your room very humid to keep you mouth from drying out. I got a little travel humidifier on amazon.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Biotine:
</strong>
It&#39;s a rinse that lubricates your mouth and keeps it from drying out as easily.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Wedge pillow:
</strong>
You&#39;ll have to sleep at a 45 degree angle. I got a memory foam wedge pillow on amazon to help with this.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Heating pad:
</strong>
With all the weird sleeping arrangements my back was sore. It was really nice having a heating pad to loosen it up.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Cold Gel Packs:
</strong>
I mostly used these when I got hot after walking, but they were nice to have.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Apparel
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Hip Bag / Fanny Pack with a key fob:
</strong>
I took this to the hospital and on a lot of my walks. The key fob made it impossible to lose my key - which could have easily happened in the post-anesthesia haze.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Comfy clothes to lounge in:
</strong>
You want big neck openings.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Several &#34;walking outfits:&#34;
</strong>
I found that walking after surgery can be as sweaty as running before surgery.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
A &#34;nice&#34; outfit:
</strong>
I didn&#39;t bring one but wish I&#39;d been able to look a little nicer at my followup appointments.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Soft headbands and loose hats:
</strong>
If you have forehead work done you will have an incision that will scare young children. You won&#39;t be able to wear a wig or shave your head.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Some way to hide your mummy bandage:
</strong>
if you care. I wore a hoodie at first but eventually just rocked the mummy look.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
3-4 large, soft masks:
</strong>
They&#39;ll get dirty from your leaky face, and coarse ones will irritate swollen lips.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Velcro mask extender:
</strong>
This is a long velcro strap that converts an ear-loop mask into a mask that straps around the back of your head. When your head is wrapped like a mummy you don&#39;t have ears.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Msc
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Nintendo Switch:
</strong>
with the hulu app and HMDI cable. It was nice having golden girls constantly playing on the big tv.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Bluetooth Speaker:
</strong>
for soothing pretty music.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
An extension cord:
</strong>
with multiple outlets and USB charging.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
LED Tea light candles:
</strong>
I packed these on a whim and they were super useful. Not only can they make your airbnb seem cozy, but you can use them as night lights so you can take your pills at night without having to turn on big lights.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Ziplock bags:
</strong>
I ended up with lots of loose items and could have used a variety of these.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Paper towels:
</strong>
for the first week after surgery eating was pretty messy. I went through 2 rolls of paper towels.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Nose hair trimmer:
</strong>
I had to do that the night before surgery.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Pepper spray:
</strong>
I had to walk two hours a day. For the most part I had no problems, but I did get followed by a creep for a few blocks. I didn&#39;t pepper spray him but it would have made me feel a little safer to be carrying it.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Things I thought I would use but didn&#39;t
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Straws:
</strong>
My lips were so swollen I literally couldn&#39;t use a straw
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Neck Pillow:
</strong>
I forgot to bring it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Games:
</strong>
- I bought lots of games for my switch before leaving, but I was too wiped out to play them much.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Saline nose spray:
</strong>
You can&#39;t use this until a few weeks after surgery.
</li>
</ul>

Button up comfy shirt/sweater for the first few days is good as it may be hard to pull a shirt over your head initially. Consider getting some large syringes (no needle of course) to suck up fluids to squirt into your mouth. It was a life saver for me. After my lip lift, fat grafts, and rhinoplasty I wasn’t able to drink out of a cup easily for about a week and straw suctions felt like it was pulling at my incisions. I got some big ones that are used to feed kittens. A few new clean washcloths is nice too, I don’t trust the hotel ones to clean near incisions. It feels so amazing to wipe the surgical grime off your face with a hot washcloth and breath in the steam vapors to start softening up all the gross residual stuff in the nasal cavity. Since you will be spending a lot of time on your back, another good item is a thick pillow for under your knees, helps with back alignment. Hair ties and clips are also crucial if you have long hair, your hair will be a mess for the first few days, being able to get it off your face while doing maintenance is convenient and sanitary.

Good suggestions! I&#39;d considered bringing syringes at one point, but forgotten to. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t need them. :)

My most useful purchase was a set of 50 cc Jell-O shot syringes. I used them to get my goopy food into my swollen mouth without spilling anything. I would bring my blender cup to the couch, suck a serving into the syringe, and eat it like a hamster...

We brought a similar list for my wife, but we also included small bills for tips for the hotel staff on the last day, and food delivery drivers.
</p>
<p>
We used a kindle fire stick to plug directly into the hotel TV so we could watch all our shows.
</p>
<p>
We also chose our hotel to have free breakfast and a free evening meal to cut down on helper meals.
</p>
<p>
We also brought over the counter ibuprofen/aleve to switch off of opioids as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
If you are prone to nausea, make sure to ask your doc for anti nausea meds. In some of these FFS surgeries there is a possibility of drainage down your throat during healing, and that can increase nausea, and nobody wants to throw up after that kind of surgery.
</p>
<p>
If you are getting hour hairline moved forward, a good gentle child&#39;s shampoo for when you can actually take a shower would be super helpful. I had to run out and get some and it took both of us in the shower to get everything (conditioner, blood, yuck!) out of her long hair and the gentle no-tears shampoo really helped to avoid getting things in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d really recommend a second person. If you do well, and don&#39;t need them, that&#39;s fantastic. However, if you do need help, then you have someone to run to the store, chase down cocoa in the hotel lobby, or even help with bandage changes, and driving to the doc&#39;s for post appointments. Plus, it&#39;s a good safety insurance if you really really need help with unexpected complications and need someone to call the doc etc.

Good suggestions! Thanks for sharing. It seems like everyone&#39;s experience is a little different based on the doctor and where you stay.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t agree enough about the opioids. TBH, one of the things I like about my doc is that he mostly relies on tylenol/motrin for pain relief.
</p>
<p>
About having a helper. This was definitely a concern of mine, since I did the trip solo. Please allow me to elaborate on my personal experience, not in reply to you, but for anyone who might come along later worried about the same thing.
</p>
<h3>
About traveling solo
</h3>
<p>
I stayed at the hospital for one night after surgery. From 7pm to 7am I had a personal nurse provided by the surgeon. This was crucial - not only for emotional support but also to help me get up and walking ASAP so I could be unhooked from all the machines. The hospital&#39;s shift nurses were very kind, but they were too busy to give this kind of support. If I was doing FFS again, I would move heaven and earth to make sure I had a personal nurse the first night even if I had family there.
</p>
<p>
I also hired a nurse to drive me back to the airbnb and come check on me the next day. There&#39;s a company in SF called Solos that specializes in this kind of thing. My nurse, Mallory, was so wonderful. It was a great comfort having someone looking out for me those first few days. I actually hired her for a third day so she could take me to my first followup appointment.  If I was doing FFS again, I would really like to have this kind of help for the first few days. Especially if I was going to be taking opiates or expected a hard recovery from anesthesia. If a friend or family member was coming, I&#39;d rely on them for this stuff.  Doing it completely alone probably would have been ok, but it&#39;s more of a gamble.

Sounds like you had a good set up from your surgeon.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, we had a different set up.
</p>
<p>
My wife stayed two nights in hospital, but had no personal nurse. I stayed with her as much as possible as I used to be a nurse, and acted in that capacity for her.
</p>
<p>
Because of my experience as a nurse, we didn&#39;t feel the need to provide extra help on that front, but if you have the funds to afford it, I highly recommend it. Just because then you can ask things like &#34;Is this healing normally?&#34; and be reassured things are looking like they should. My wife was really worried about the swelling, but I could tell her she was right on track heading off a lot of her anxiety.

I&#39;m not due for FFS for at least another 6+ months to a year, but I&#39;ve an odd question for you, if you don&#39;t mind?
</p>
<p>
Basically, I sometimes get a sort of nasal drip at the back of my throat (allergies, I think?) that I normally have to blow my nose or sniff to get it cleared.  How&#39;s your breathing been through your nose, if you&#39;re able to do that again yet?

Now that I&#39;ve had all the splints removed I can breathe perfectly through my nose.
</p>
<p>
For the first 3-4 days after surgery it was totally stopped up. It got a little better on its own, but wasn&#39;t great. I had two post-op appointments. The first they took out some gauze that I had no idea was in there. The second they took out the splints. After each of those it was significantly better.
</p>
<p>
My nose has been a little runny the whole time - even now. So I&#39;ll have to grab a kleenex once an hour or so. I&#39;m not supposed to blow it (or sneeze with my mouth closed) until 6 weeks after surgery.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps! There are so many weird little questions when planning this operation that it&#39;s hard to find answers to.

International electrical adapter!
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s one of those things, it collects dust in your house for a year, and then it&#39;s priceless for a week. Luckily my USB charger worked with it.
</p>
<p>
Prune juice - apparently the #1 reason people discontinue opioid painkillers is because of the severe constipation. In my experience, regular ol&#39; prune juice was way more effective than stool softener drugs. Obviously don&#39;t bring it on the airplane, but ask the nurses about it.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Funny story - I didn&#39;t hide my &#34;mummy bandage&#34;, I was just too exhausted. When I was going through the airport, the security guards gently pulled me out of the lineup, and directed me towards the premium / business class security entrance that had no lineup. What a nice touch of kindness! That&#39;s not the kind of attention I was expecting from them!

That is a funny story! Maybe the trick to easy flying is just to bandage yourself up even if you don’t need it. 😂
