That is definitely not normal, I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re going through this.
</p>
<p>
I would start looking into a different surgeon for a revision.

I think you‚Äôll be needing a revision at some point.
</p>
<p>
Would you mind naming your surgeon?

This is not normal, you should go and see your surgeon. Wearing compression is not going to fix this. Goodluckü´∂üèª

This is not normal. I too would think your surgeon&#39;s team made a mistake. I think they&#39;ve done you dirty. Obviously it&#39;s too early for revisions, but good fuck, that conversation should be happening now.

I can understand what you&#39;re going through. I had a similar problem with my first surgery, doctor told me to wait but it didn&#39;t go down. It only took a 30min max revision and everything is pretty good for me now. You didn&#39;t make a mistake it&#39;s not your fault.  Sending you much love ‚ù§Ô∏è

I&#39;m really sorry this happened, I&#39;m afraid to say this doesn&#39;t look like a normal result. I can&#39;t see any visible labia minora, the clitoris/clitoral hood isn&#39;t very well defined, possibly still due to swelling. I can only see one hole, but the entrance is quite small/tucked away, I&#39;m unsure where your urethra is supposed to be though it&#39;s obviously there somewhere if you&#39;re still peeing ok.
</p>
<p>
Do you feel like you have tucked/bent erection at all? Cos it could be excess erectile tissue causing the swelling in the middle.
</p>
<p>
I would try to get another surgeons opinion on this, and see if you can find other patients who went to your surgeon for SRS to see if they also struggled with this.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend a revision unfortunately, if the swelling in the middle does not go down in the next month or two. I&#39;d start consulting earlier than that though.
</p>
<p>
Is your dilation schedule going ok at least?
</p>
<p>
Best of luck to you, I don&#39;t think this is unsalvageable by any means but it will likely take longer to get the results you wanted than you likely hoped, I&#39;m sorry :(

I had my surgery 26 years ago, I was very young . I like to see a professional because I like to come in for a consultation my face and body are pretty botched up. I need to get reconstructive work done and I like to see it professional and then proceed from there. It looks like when they did the vaginal surgery , they left part of the penis in and it got botched up. Mine was botched up for years. I didn‚Äôt want anybody to look at it and I had to get major reconstruction surgery so that it would look normal again because it looked horrendous down there and I wasn‚Äôt able to have sex and I wasn‚Äôt able to urinate properly.

Yeah you&#39;re definitely gonna need a revision I&#39;m afraid. Seems like doctor just inverted all the penis skin in and didn&#39;t use any for the labia construction.

Firstly, so sorry you are having to deal with this. I can only imagine the emotions that you&#39;re having around something that should be joyous and happy.
</p>
<p>
As you already know, a revision is needed. It looks like you&#39;ve encountered a prolapse canal. Hopefully you can find a new surgeon that can repair this. You also need to seek legal recourse for the malpractice of the first doctor.

Hi babe.. This result does not look normal. It seems like the surgeon didn‚Äôt follow any of the common techniques and procedures. I hope you find another surgeon who can revise this work and give you a proper Neo vagina.. whoever did this needs their license taken away.  So sorry this happened..

Did the doctor visually inspect you when giving you that advice? Or had you just spoken over the phone and said oh hi the swelling isn&#39;t going down... Cis that looks worse than swelling not going down and if you described it like that he might have thought you were better health but extra in your worry. I&#39;d highly recommend getting it checked out and then see with the fixture if you need a revision.
