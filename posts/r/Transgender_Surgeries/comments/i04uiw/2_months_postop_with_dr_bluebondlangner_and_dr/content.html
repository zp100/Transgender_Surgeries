It was an amazing experience all the way around!  They are some of the most compassionate and professional people I’ve ever met.  They’re angels on earth 🥰

Awesome!  I take it they were worth the wait?  It was probably shorter for you, but last week I scheduled a consult with them.  For August 2021.

Absolutely 100% worth the wait.  I firmly believe they are the absolute best team for this surgery.  The wait is hard, I waited 8 months for a consultation and then 15 months for surgery.  But if you want the best, you’ve gotta wait.  You’ll be glad you did 😊

What type of surgery did you have?  PI, or hybrid peritoneal?

<p>
Was yours an initial surgery, or a revision?  From what I&#39;ve heard, Drs. BBL, Avanessian, and Wittenberg will do peritoneal as an initial, but some others won&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
Did Drs. BBL and Zhang ask you to participate in follow-up exams?  Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s website indicates that&#39;s required for patients looking to do PPL with her.
</p>
<p>
Apologies for the barrage of questions.  I can stop.

It’s all good, I’m happy to help!  It was the initial surgery, and they require you to go to at least the first 2 post-op followups in person.

Understood.  Did you try moving up the consult or the surgery, after you had all your letters in place?  I&#39;m hoping to have mine in hand by the end of August, and Dr. BBL&#39;s office and others here basically say that you should call to check for cancellations once you&#39;re at that point.

Oh yes I did.  My surgery ended up being 3 months earlier than originally scheduled.  I had all my letters at the consultation and I called periodically to ask about cancellations and they eventually called me and offered an earlier date.  It also helps to have your hair removal done ahead of time.

It’s their default operation.
</p>
<p>
Hair hasn’t been an issue, there isn’t any inside.  I did enough hair removal in the required areas beforehand and they took care of the rest of it during surgery.

Congratulations! She looks great, really nicely healed especially after only two months.
</p>
<p>
How has the recovery been so far for you? Are you back up and walking about yet? And if you don&#39;t mind me asking, how many hours of hair removal did you have done?
</p>
<p>
I had my consult with her in June and got a date for September 2021 -- still a ways off but I know it&#39;s well worth the wait!

Recovery has been much better since the 6 week mark!  I’ve been walking easily since about 4 weeks out, and I’m now able to exercise, drive, and sit without a donut pillow.  I had 25 hours of hair removal beforehand, all electrolysis.  Keep marching towards the finish line!  It’s so worth the wait 😊

Thank you for sharing. How is the dilation regimen going? Would you please share on your physical recovery to this point (nerves reconnecting, sensation, etc.)

Dilation has gotten much easier and I’m using the biggest (orange) dilator.  It isn’t painful, but it’s definitely uncomfortable at first.  Sensation is coming back bit by bit.  I still get the “electric pulse” sensation of nerves reconnecting.  I’ve been able to have orgasms since 7 weeks out, and they’re incredible 🥰
