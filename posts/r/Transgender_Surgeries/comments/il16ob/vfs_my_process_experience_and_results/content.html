Edit: Added clears/coughs graphs which starts the day after surgery (surgery on 8/19/20)
</p>
<p>
<strong>
What? Why?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
So here&#39;s the thing: I have a totally passable feminine voice. It almost never fails to pass, and it was the very first thing that caused a stranger to use the correct pronouns for me. The problem is that it&#39;s effortful. Unlike the effects of HRT, losing weight, or FFS, maintaining my voice felt like a constant low-stakes balancing act.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to get one of the basic vocal parameters (there&#39;s a bunch) into a nicely fixed effortless place. From there, I can build and play and feel free to use my voice however I please, like a normal person.
</p>
<p>
There appears to be some controversy about VFS in the trans community. On one side, there are people who say that the risks of surgery outweigh the benefits because a satisfactory voice can be had by voice training alone. Others say that VFS is the only possible way they can get a feminine voice despite their best efforts at training. I don&#39;t feel like any of those opinions describe my feeling: I just wanna exist and not get surprise vocal dysphoria ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. For me, this is very clearly a &#34;want&#34; and not a &#34;need.&#34; I could exist without VFS, but why do so when I&#39;ve saved up enough to get this surgery?
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Process
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Wow, there&#39;s a lot here to get through. I did a massive amount of research on the procedures available. The thing with trans medicine in the US is that individuals really have to be expert patients, or maybe the better description is &#34;self-advocating patient.&#34; That is, it&#39;s really up to us to put things together and chart a path and then review the plan with a host of health professionals. That&#39;s not an okay state of the world since it requires a ton of privilege to pull off. At multiple times in this process, I put the whole thing down and didn&#39;t think about it for days. I needed this to be a thing that I could abandon, and not regret abandoning. There was a lot that went into this, and doing this on top of everything else in life is a whole lot. However, this is exactly what I did:
</p>
<p>
First, I did a basic review of what options were available. I looked at patient testimonials, youtube videos, and surgeon&#39;s websites. There&#39;s a bunch, and they&#39;re diverse and hard to compare but that got me building a mental model of this decision.
</p>
<p>
Second, I focused in on a very few surgical options. I was interested in vocal cord shortening only (that&#39;s VFSRAC [Yeson] and Wendler Glottoplasty &amp; variations.) I read lots of papers on the surgeries, failed to understand them, re-read them, then read other stuff, then re-read them again.
</p>
<p>
Third, I discussed this over and over with my gender therapist and primary care physician. My PCP is totally awesome and even took part in exchanging papers :-) With both of them on board, I started to interview surgeons.
</p>
<p>
My criteria for interviewing surgeons were low. I wanted to talk to the full spectrum of people providing this surgery. I&#39;m not gonna lie, every time I talked to a new person I was like: &#34;Wow! They were so great. I could definitely go to them for this ♥&#34; And every time, the next surgeon felt like an even better fit... So it was either recency bias or luck of the order... I gonna go with luck &#39;cause it makes me feel better ;-P
</p>
<p>
Below are the surgeons I consulted with, in the order that I contacted them:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://us.yesonvc.com/">Yeson Voice Center</a>
($0 consultation, $7,380 total)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This happened completely by email. Jessie was absolutely amazing (you hear this online, and it&#39;s true.)
</p>
<p>
Pros: A huge online presence, good ties to other trusted surgeons (I had FFS @ FacialTeam), they are high throughput (read: very experienced with all things trans), and specializes only in voice.
</p>
<p>
Cons: A flight to South Korea meant an extra 2 weeks for self-quarantine (nbd)
</p>
<p>
2)
<a href="https://www.drspiegel.com/">Dr. Spiegel</a>
($200 consultation [I didn&#39;t do this though], unknown total)
</p>
<p>
I emailed his office but decided not to proceed with a consultation. The stories online gave me a bad feeling so I decided not to proceed.
</p>
<p>
3)
<a href="https://www.palmbeachplastics.com/">Dr. Mardirossian</a>
($75 consultation, $9065 total)
</p>
<p>
I emailed the office and set up a consultation with Dr. Mardirossian.
</p>
<p>
Pros: I have friends that live near him so I could potentially stay for free, a good reputation with patients online, very personable and an easy consultation
</p>
<p>
Cons: Florida still had the two-week quarantine so it may as well have been South Korea, Dr. Mardirossian is a plastic surgeon, not a voice specialist
</p>
<p>
4)
<a href="http://www.voicedoctor.net/">Dr. Thomas</a>
($600 in-person consultation, $15,550 total)
</p>
<p>
I emailed the office and set up an in-office visit after an at-home isolation period. I live in Seattle, so the drive was very reasonable.
</p>
<p>
Pros: Dr. Thomas is a voice specialist, he is very transparent with his data, he did an excellent job at expectation setting
</p>
<p>
Cons: Expectation for a completely effortless feminine voice (both pitch and resonance) without voice therapy seemed unreasonable. Did I misunderstand or was this what was being proposed? It didn&#39;t seem to match the results that I heard on his website...
</p>
<p>
5)
<a href="https://www.sfvoice.com/">Dr. Yung</a>
($250 consultation [$600 - $150 SLP - $200 not in person], $7,500 quoted, $10,275 actual)
</p>
<p>
I emailed the office and asked for a consultation. The consultation was really wonderful. Dr. Yung really wanted to understand my goals and how she could help, which was unique.
</p>
<p>
Pros: She earned my trust, is a vocal specialist, has integrated voice therapy that already had contact with my voice therapist, she has trans people on staff, and has tons of experience with trans people
</p>
<p>
Cons: Minimal content on the website, but there&#39;s more on Facebook
</p>
<p>
At this point, I had spent a total of $925 in consultation fees and ~$200 in academic papers. I could only do this because of where I&#39;m at in life. I decided to stop here and go with Dr. Yung, even though there were plenty more doctors to consult.
</p>

<strong>
Surgery &amp; Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day -13:
</strong>
Pre-surgical doubt and reaching out to the trans community for guidance. I&#39;m writing this in retrospect, but this was a scary moment. It was the day I had to fork over the mountain of cash and refunds dropped off the cliff. I reached out to my entire support network and a whole lot of strangers. I feel like the trans community really helped me on this day, and I&#39;m very grateful.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/i4pd7d/presurgical_doubt/">https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/i4pd7d/presurgical_doubt/</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day -2:
</strong>
Today was my pre-op appointment with Dr. Yung and Wendy Vastine. This was kind of a whirlwind day, which is what I&#39;ve come to expect of pre-op days. We talked about the procedure and expectations for recovery. Dr. Yung was very open to my questions, although I didn&#39;t really have very many. This was mostly because there weren&#39;t any red flags and I was pretty confident in my decision. I felt supported and safe with Dr. Yung. After she had me read the rainbow passage and viewed my vocal folds, I had a short voice therapy session with Wendy. We got to know each other, and they walked me through exercises that I&#39;d be working on during recovery (but not immediately) Wendy will be working with my voice therapist back home (Seattle) since there are restrictions about providing therapy across state lines (yay, US healthcare!). It sounds like information sharing between the two therapists is going very smoothly. After the voice therapy, I was off to hospital outpatient admissions for my COVID test. At admissions, I was surprised by an extra $2150 in hospital costs, and $625 in anesthesia. I&#39;m paying for this surgery out of pocket, so insurance isn&#39;t going to be helping with these costs. This brought the total to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dr. Yung&#39;s package: $7500
</li>
<li>
Hospital: $2150
</li>
<li>
Anesthesia: $625
</li>
<li>
AirBnB (18 days): $2077 &lt;- this only makes sense during COVID, otherwise flights back and forth would have been the way to go
</li>
<li>
Flights: $196
</li>
<li>
Total: $12,548
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
Day 0:
</strong>
Surgery went perfectly, and I was out of the hospital 2 hours after surgery started.  The total surgery time was just over one hour, which was faster than expected. Waking up took a lot of conscious effort. The nurse didn&#39;t know any sign language at all, but he understood when I pointed at him and gave him the devil horns (he rocked) once he gave me my phone lol. I get a bit of phlegm every now and then that turns into a bubble in my airway. I&#39;m doing a huffing type of maneuver to unblock my airway, but it&#39;s disconcerting... Apparently I wanted croissants after the surgery, so I&#39;m on number three now lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ My tongue is numb as well and I have a headache, so I took 2 ibuprofen. There are forest fires nearby as well, and we had ash blow into the AirBnB last night. Mom ran out to pick up an air purifier.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Night 0:
</strong>
I forgot that I&#39;d be constipated after surgery... I ate too many croissants, and without anywhere to go, they turned into acid reflux in the middle of the night. I woke up twice with involuntary coughs 😬 My bed is now raised, and I have plenty of medication to handle this. I&#39;ll be eating cherries instead of croissants tomorrow though.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 1:
</strong>
Phlegm is my biggest nemesis. It seems to build up every few hours to the point where impedes breathing. I think that laying on my side helps, but I didn&#39;t collect any data to see if that&#39;s true. I downloaded an app to start tracking coughs and voiceless clears over time. Gonna get me some data!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Night 1:
</strong>
Sleep is good. I enjoy sleep. The heartburn problems have been conquered, and I only woke up once with a surprise cough. Dr. Yung reassured me that some unexpected coughing is to be expected ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ So I&#39;m just trying not to worry about it too much... But I&#39;m starting to get some nice data 😁
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 2:
</strong>
A totally normal day, except no talking. I worked on and off for about 6 hours today and napped or watched TV for the rest -- quarantine life *sigh*.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Night 2:
</strong>
A totally normal night! I had zero unexpected coughs and slept like normal. My throat is really starting to settle down 😌
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 3:
</strong>
Getting more and more normal every day. Today there was very little reminder that I had surgery (except for phlegm). Literally no pain, which has started a weird mind game -- I&#39;m now worried that the surgery didn&#39;t do anything because nothing feels different. I know that&#39;s totally not right, but it&#39;s clear that it&#39;s going to be hard to wait for this reason... I&#39;ll be good, but I did catch myself thinking a curse word and mouthing it at the same time 😬
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Night 3:
</strong>
Last night sucked. All screen time and no exercise made it really hard to get to sleep. It was 2 am before I finally fell asleep. I woke up with a gasp as well, and that&#39;s worrisome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 4:
</strong>
Getting into totally normal days and nights here, so I&#39;ll continue this journal when something interesting happens.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 13:
</strong>
I GOT TO HEAR MY VOICE TODAY!!!!!! The recordings attached to this Reddit post are from today. In the after video, I had only said two sentences previously since the surgery and they were both just moments before when they told me I could talk and started asking me questions lol. Some stats:
</p>
<p>
Range went from 110Hz -&gt;350Hz to 160Hz -&gt; 330Hz (this will continue to change). Humming now at 270 Hz is as effortful as humming at 220 Hz was before. Speaking focal average is a perfect 220Hz ♥

Once I fully heal up, I&#39;ll be able to sing. Some caveats there though: it&#39;ll take a long time to fully heal, the volume will be decreased, and I will have lost range from both the bottom and a little from the top compared to my pre-VFS voice. So all-in-all, I&#39;ll probably be a bit worse at singing (is that really possible?!?), but I imagine I&#39;ll find it just as enjoyable :-)

<p>
You can train these back though, you just have to do them differently than you&#39;re used to. For example for volume you don&#39;t just increase volume but use twang instead, it&#39;s even healthier for you voice.
</p>
<p>
Saying this as someone who had a passing voice before VFS and still got it (wendler glottoplasty) to eliminate bottom range just in case. I got it two years ago.

Also, it&#39;s probably too early for you to have found out yourself, but what did the surgeons say about involuntary noises coughing, etc?

I edited the post with my clears/coughs data. I don&#39;t think this sort of thing is normally tracked, so the advice was just to minimize this as much as possible. Maybe some anecdotal data will help someone else down the line...

Wow, you sound great for 13 days!
</p>
<p>
I got to admit the recovery from my Wendler Glottoplasty was pretty painless compared to FFS and GRS but I really hated the silence and all the phlegm that the scarring produced!
</p>
<p>
I used a similar breath it away technique and also put a lot of honey in drinks!
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t overdo it though in the first month and be mindful of any strain or loud volume.
</p>
<p>
What method did Doctor Yung use for your VFS (sorry if I missed it) ?
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s similar to Wendler Glottoplasty which I had you may gain a little more pitch still (not a lot but a bit more) as the scarring heals and contracts the vocal cords a bit further.
</p>
<p>
I had mine (as a two stage process) in the UK last year.
</p>
<p>
Luckily I got this for free from this surgeon on the NHS:

Dr. Yung performs the wendler glottoplasty. The key characteristics being: 1) CO2 laser depethialization 2) Two resorbable stitches in the vocal cords
</p>
<p>
I agree, I&#39;m not expecting a ton of change in pitch. Really, just more comfort in exploring the whole range when it&#39;s healed 😁
</p>
<p>
By two stage process, do you mean that you had to go into the office twice for the procedure?

Sorry for the long answer! I was in three times but the two stage bit took place at my last appointment as I understand it (I&#39;d need to check my surgeon&#39;s letters for the details).
</p>
<p>
The first procedure my surgeon identified was to correct a slight abnormality with my right side of my vocal cords that prevented them closing as smoothly as they should have to create a smooth sound (my voice seemed to have too much creaky vocal fry). He identified this when he did his first visual check of my vocal cords and showed me it on video. This resulted in a small portion of my right arytenoid being burned away but even just losing a little bit of mass at that point helped my pitch a tiny bit and made my speech therapy techniques easier to maintain.
</p>
<p>
Then six months after that healed and it had shown to be effective and my vocal cords opened and closed very smoothly under observation I had my first Wendler Glottoplasty. This turned out fine for the first surgical review at 4 weeks but at about 6-8 weeks the surgery failed and came apart. It was really obvious... One day I just woke up and my old pre-surgery voice was back! I was literally in tears!!! The surgeon suspected he needed to have put the two stitches slightly deeper - it was very unusual for it to hold that long and then fail.
</p>
<p>
Another 6 months after that (last October) I had the Wendler Glottoplasty again. The two stage bit was that the CO2 laser was also used to tighten the cords and reduce the mass a tiny bit at the same time based on the outcome of my first set of results.
</p>
<p>
By the end of if it all I went from averaging a really horrible and deep 105hz in speaking voice to just over 200hz. My reading voice is a bit higher at around 220hz. The surgery has definitely held this time (10 months) and I&#39;ve had two reviews and been signed off. My top end seems pretty unchanged at over 300hz but I&#39;ve lost that bassy bottom end. Volume has also got a lot better over the 10 months since surgery. I&#39;d say it took about 6 months for volume to start really improving.
</p>
<p>
So my process was a bit long winded!
</p>
<p>
Glad you only needed the one go as it&#39;s not fun!
</p>
<p>
It all makes life so much easier and less anxiety driven in the end though and makes you feel more comfortable with yourself which is the best end result 👍

Thank you for the detailed story. I have been working with a voice feminization specialist for 3 months now and there is undoubtedly progress (the voice has become higher), but now we are training the naturalness of the voice and it is very difficult. I also need to constantly monitor my voice.

I should probably update the main article in depth. I had my 1.5 and 3 month follow ups. I wasn&#39;t completely healed at 1.5 months --there was some suture left to dissolve. At 3 months, everything looked perfect. My default pitch is a solid 210-220 still. Singing is weird. I&#39;m definitely relearning how to sing. Oddly, I can hit most of the male parts pretty easily still, but it&#39;s easier to switch between parts. My voice quality is more breathy, and volume is a bit reduced. It occasionally gets tired and I have to reset, but I have stealthy ways to sneak that into conversations with strategic &#34;mmhmm&#34;s or thinking &#34;hmmmm&#34;s. Volume was a larger problem early on, but nowadays I have no problem yelling at people on my bike 😉 Speaking of which, I&#39;m back to long bike rides. Last weekend I did 55 miles in one sitting, and I don&#39;t see a reason why I can&#39;t get to 100 miles by this summer. I don&#39;t worry at all about incidental drops in pitch, so the surgery definitely met my bar for success. I do wonder how my vocal cords will age. It sounds like there are lots of methods to help with aging voices though, and the biggest thing moving forward is to apply the care techniques I learned in voice therapy and be mindful of how my voice feels. Anywho, yeah, I&#39;m pretty happy with the way this turned out ¯(◡‿◡✿) /¯

8 days post-op.  Phlem is still a huge issue, but not really out of the normal for me,, and pain just a little scratching where they jammed all that stuff down my throat.  being older and fatter I think its gonna take longer for everything to heal.   I am so in my head that I&#39;m not going to be able to talk again.  maybe cuz i tried to make a sound the way i used to and couldn&#39;t, its like i know I am going to have to move the way i produce sound but I am being good and not testing it until my two weeks, i may just wait for my appointment which is a few days after two weeks.  Thanks to my works covid restriction I cannot fly back down there so I am having my Post op pictures done at Virginia Mason, and they are going to send them to Dr. Yung, and i will follow up on the 4th with a Zoom call.

This is one surgery I don&#39;t know if I could handle the recovery.  But wow, those results.
</p>
<p>
Do you think voice training requires effort for everyone?  After a few months I never thought about it again.
</p>
<p>
And would you still recommend vfs for people like that?  Who pass unless they cough, lol.

Hi there. So there recovery is pretty okay, and you get used to not talking (or at least I did) pretty quick. I&#39;m also a quiet person by nature. For me, the effort was really a mental one, not a physical one. It took effort to feel ok with doing a balancing act. Maybe what I needed was more CBT and less voice therapy! Not sure, but I&#39;m really glad I did this 😁
</p>
<p>
No comment though on if people should get this surgery -- I think that&#39;s deeply personal, but the community should support this as a valid option regardless of starting point.

The wait was two months. It could have been much quicker (two weeks), but I opted for the later date.

I really don&#39;t have much advice tbh. The biggest thing is to avoid those hard closings of the vocal folds when you&#39;re coughing. So I ended up making a &#39;hhhh&#39; kinda sound. I started to push more and more air through when I got more comfortable about a week after surgery. That doesn&#39;t always work, and eventually I would end up having to cough. One other thought -- if you try changing your position like laying on your side or sitting up, sometimes that&#39;ll delay the need to cough.

What a great writeup - thanks for sharing the detail!  I was considering James Thomas but now rethinking this....  after a few months now - how are you feeling with the results?  My issue is maintaining a good resonance - it feels very difficult for me to get and keep...

Hey, thanks for asking -- I wouldn&#39;t have thought to update this if you hadn&#39;t ¯_(ツ)_/¯
</p>
<p>
My voice feels totally healed and natural, even though it&#39;s only been 7 months. Warning: complete subjective experience follows.... There&#39;s been some expectation setting as well as pleasant surprises along the way.  That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s perfect, but it&#39;s a lot better than it was before surgery. Specifically, I don&#39;t think about pitch
<em>
ever
</em>
. I&#39;ve done enough recordings to understand my range and be okay with it. For me, there is still a mental balancing act with resonance when I speak. I feel like if I attend to my voice production while I&#39;m speaking, my voice flows evenly. But if I spend my thinking cycles on the (very mentally taxing) task at hand, resonance drops to the ground. Nowadays when my resonance goes bad, I still have a passing voice. That&#39;s because I start off the thinking-and-speaking task with enough clarity to do the balancing act. But that degrades over time, resonance fails, and I default my resonance. However, I&#39;ve already set the tone of what I&#39;m saying and the listener retains the initial impression of my gender identity. I think that&#39;s the big caveat here -- I do still have to go through the full trained voice effort to be gendered correctly. I just don&#39;t have to do it as often.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, I&#39;m happy -- I perceive this taking a load off my dysphoria plate in total. That was unimaginable to me a few years ago.

Thanks for the response!  I&#39;m mostly gendered correctly now, with the exception of phone or audio calls of some type.  I can sometimes hear myself back through the meeting/call and all I can think is that is a male voice. Same with my recordings when I practice, although I&#39;m putting all effort in, but what I hear is a trapped or manufactured attempt at pushing the resonance forward.
</p>
<p>
Any tips on training?  I see a speech therapist every Thursday and I know I&#39;ve made some decent strides - but its still very difficult (and maybe I just need to practice much more than I do?)
</p>
<p>
Anyhow - I&#39;m so happy for you that this worked out well!

Was the doctor concerned about you clearing your throat? I mean I&#39;m fresh out of surgery and if I don&#39;t stick my tongue out and push the phlegm I&#39;ll drown ; :( it happens maybe 5 times a day where I need to clear My throat.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m post op 5 days now. I&#39;m so scared I&#39;ll screw up something :(

It is a very tense and quiet couple of weeks before the post-op appointment.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Dr. Yung said that there was a little bit of wiggle room in there. While the stitches are holding everything together, things are fairly fragile but they can take _some_ load. Knowing what&#39;s too much load is probably difficult to predict and communicate, but surgeons do know what&#39;s going on -- they look how everything is healing in the post-op, after all.
</p>
<p>
That said, your surgeon has probably done this many times before and adjusted their method to make sure you have really low risks. Take it easy, and don&#39;t kill yourself over being a perfectionist here. I posted my cough and clear counts as an anecdote because I really struggled to calm myself about this too. Your body will heal up, and soon you&#39;ll be speaking again.
</p>
<p>
Hang in there :-)

- it&#39;s been a few years since you had VFS with Dr. Yung, are you still happy with the results?  Were you able to get back to singing?

I ask because I am considering going with her for my FVS and would love to hear about your long-term experiences.

Yep, I&#39;m still very happy with my results. I still jam out in my car, but there&#39;s some notes at the very top end that I just can&#39;t reach or sustain with any sort of quality anymore. For example, the song &#34;she used to be mine&#34; by Sara Barreilles is a challenge, but not something I shy away from.
</p>
<p>
The only consistent difficulty I have with my voice is with volume. Talking to a group of people in a crowded restaurant makes them have to lean in to hear me. I end up shouting in those cases so I can be heard, and that can limit how the conversation flows. Most people are very gracious about moving to quiet areas to have a conversation though -- other people wanna hear what you have to say and will make it easier for you!
</p>
<p>
The biggest thing is that I almost never think about my voice in my day-to-day life. When I do think about how I talk, it&#39;s with passing curiosity around what I used to have to consciously think about, and how comfortable I am with letting things slip. Part of this is probably from just being much more comfortable because of how far I am into my transition in general. I don&#39;t use twang in my voice anymore except when I want to be a little flirty. I use smile (to shorten the resonant chamber) when I want to make things more girly (especially for girl-talk). But when I&#39;m talking in general I don&#39;t engage in the balancing act that I wrote about earlier. There&#39;s probably a good portion of that balancing act that has become automatic tho ¯_(ツ)_/¯

Hello,
</p>
<p>
Thank you for posting the details of your procedure.  Your voice sounds great!
</p>
<p>
I’m pre-transition now, but I have been looking into this surgery. I have heard a lot of good things about Dr Yung.
</p>
<p>
Since you’re in Seattle did you preop consultation with her via zoom or teams?
</p>
<p>
I live in Houston, and the costs for her sounds fair, but just curious, did you have to have the post-op consultation in person? I was thinking I could do that a few weeks after the surgery and do it through a zoom or teams call and avoid paying for a flight there (since I’m on a budget)

Yes, the consultation took place online. There was also a pre-op appointment in person a few days before surgery to talk with one of the voice coaches and for an inspection of my vocal folds. Voice is one of the things you can really work hard on when you&#39;re pre-transition (it&#39;s where I started). One of the things they talk about is that people who have trained voices tend to be more ideal candidates. There are some really great books out there that can give you specific exercises too. I remember the voice coach saying that I worked with a different book than they recommend -- maybe it&#39;s worth a quick email to see what they recommend nowadays? I used &#34;The voice book for transgender and non-binary people&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Wishing you well with your transition ☺️

The two week post-op visit is a requirement. That&#39;s when you&#39;re first allowed to speak, and they check that everything is healing correctly. Looking back at my emails from them, it looks like I also had an in-person follow-up about 6 weeks after surgery as well.

Pre-op consultation &amp; surgery
</p>
<p>
2-week post-op follow up
</p>
<p>
6-week post-op follow up

Yep! They may have changed their schedule over the last 3 years though, so probably best to shoot a quick email and ask ¯_(ツ)_/¯

Just another quick question… on that pre-op consultation and surgery trip… How many days would you need to be there? Just thinking about hotel costs

I think the pre-op was on a Friday and surgery was on the following Monday. A lot of surgeons (of all types) do this kind of thing where they have office days later in the week and hospital days early in the week. I think it helps ensure that they&#39;ll be available in case an emergency follow-up situation arises.

In read your experience.  You mentioned inadvertent coughing.  That did ruin anything? I thought you can’t cough? Do they give you anything to prevent this? Besides your typical cough drops. What about clearing your throat?

These are questions best for the doctor. Some coughs are expected, but should be avoided. I would worry that applying something that coats the throat (like cough drops) could impact healing. I don&#39;t recall any restrictions like that though. The coughs aren&#39;t from irritation like a sore throat -- they&#39;re from a build up of mucus, so I think a cough drop probably wouldn&#39;t help much anyways.

Just looking at the travel costs to see her and have the surgery.  I plan on using my airline miles, so I know at least one of my round trips would be covered, so I know the travel to and from for the surgery would be covered. Not sure if I will have to travel back after the surgery for a follow up

And is it recommended or required to be there a few days after the surgery?
