Ok, answer whichever ones you want!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This might not be a question specific to Dr. Suporn, but how&#39;s your pelvic floor function? I&#39;m wondering if you have comparable &#34;grip strength&#34; to what cis women have? For example, could you stand up and hold a heavy set of ben wa balls inside if you tried?
<br>
</li>
<li>
How&#39;s your lubrication? I feel like I read somewhere that Dr. Suporn is able to reroute the bulbourethral glands to discharge into the vagina rather than the urethra, giving a huge amount of natural lubrication. Do you know anything about that?
<br>
</li>
<li>
Kind of awkward, but how does it smell? Any discharge issues this far post-op? Do you have to do anything special to, um, keep it fresh?
<br>
</li>
<li>
Did you have any problems with granulation tissue or clitoral necrosis? The latter is a big concern of mine, because I have a piercing &#34;down there&#34; that Dr. Bank said might increase the risk of clitoral necrosis.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I looked at the other pictures in your profile, is your ex-girlfriend&#39;s strap-on really as big as it looks? It appears substantially bigger than a large dilator, so are you actually able to use it? Is your vagina that stretchy, or did you have to sort of work your way up to that?
<br>
</li>
<li>
Do you have any close-ups posted publicly? (You say your Chonburi organ is visible? whaaat) I&#39;d be very interested to see a more detailed view, especially how your clitoral hood and anterior and posterior commisures are constructed.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Any hair problems? Did you do any hair removal pre-op? I&#39;ve seen some results with hair on the labia minora, did you have to deal with any of that?
<br>
</li>
<li>
How is Thailand in February? I&#39;ve heard that&#39;s like the height of tourist season, but Chonburi also isn&#39;t exactly a hot tourist destination. (Well, it is for a particular type of tourist, anyway!üòÑ)
<br>
</li>
<li>
How was the flight back? Did you spring for business (or first) class?
<br>
</li>
<li>
Is the Suporn Clinic Discord still active? I&#39;d hate to think it died after the clinic was closed for like 8 months.
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
I bet I&#39;ll think of more!!

Hey, so sorry I missed this earlier! I will answer them all! üòä (edit: have to do this in a few posts, as I wrote so much and went past character limits I didn&#39;t realise Reddit had! - please check my replies to my own post here)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How&#39;s your pelvic floor function?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is a super interesting one! Obviously I have never had a cis vagina, so I don&#39;t really have a reference point to compare to, but I certainly have a degree of control there. I can &#39;grip&#39; my fingers for example, and make myself feel quite noticeably tighter during sex. I have never tried to hold heavy balls inside myself, but I suspect that (ignoring the fact that I think they would likely stay in because of the natural tightness and shape of the canal), that I probably could hold them in. If anybody wanted to get me ben wa balls, I&#39;d be happy to share that experiment üòá
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How&#39;s lubrication?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You are certainly right in that Suporn&#39;s technique allows for a degree of self-lubrication during sexual arousal - my ex-girlfriend had the ability to get very wet, and she had her surgery with Suporn 6 months before me. However, this is by the same mechanism as &#39;pre-cum&#39; before surgery. So, if you get a lot of that, it is going to be carried over. Unfortunately for me, I took a few courses of accutane as a teenager to try to get rid of my testosterone-induced acne ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and I also was on sertraline for a little while too. Accutane left me with permanently dry skin, and odd side-effects like the fact that I don&#39;t even sweat. So, I suspect that if I hadn&#39;t been on these medications, I would produce more self-lubrication than I currently do - it is not non-existent, but I generally need saliva/lube to have really good sex. Of course that&#39;s very normal, and many of my cis-female friends like using lube too - we exchange advice on which ones are best!
</p>
<p>
It is worth noting that the inside of my vagina is never &#39;dry&#39;. It is always moist to a degree. Also, when I cum, I will &#39;squirt&#39;/get very wet. It makes my orgasms very obvious. Obviously this is by the same mechanism as before as well.

<li>
Smell and discharge issues?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Haha! That is a super awkward question, but so, so important, so I&#39;ll try to answer as honestly as possible.
</p>
<p>
I have no discharge issues this far post-op, but I do produce probably a normal/slightly less than average amount of (neutral-smelling) discharge compared to cis-females. I think this is more to do with my issue stated above re. lubrication, rather than something necessarily inherent to the op - I imagine some discharge will happen for most people, and it&#39;s healthy just as in cis vaginas.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the first year, I did have A LOT of discharge. I had to wear pads everyday which I changed every few hours, and it was pretty gross. It did not smell good, and I was so despairing that it would never go away. I went to the doctor about 5 months post-op and was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis. I was given metronidazole antibiotics, and the discharge almost completely stopped for about 3 weeks and there were no odour problems either... but then it came back. I think I may have gone on a further course, but oddly, at almost exactly 1 year post-op, the discharge stopped pretty much overnight and has never come back in an abnormal or worrying way... I hear Dr Bowers recommends mixing metronidazole gel with lubrication during dilation for the first few months, and in retrospect, this seems like a GREAT idea. The discharge issues were one of the more unpleasant aspects of the whole thing, along with difficult dilation at times, and having to have a catheter fitted for the first week leaving hospital.
</p>
<p>
So... I think Suporn guidelines have changed on this front in the past couple of years, but I was told initially that after 3 months post-op/when discharge stopped, you shouldn&#39;t douche or really clean &#39;inside&#39; your vagina. So, I kept this up for after the 1 year post-op mark, and I didn&#39;t have too many issues. My vagina did not smell in itself, but I guess if you put your fingers in there, they would come out smelling quite &#39;vaginary&#39;. Not unpleasant, just human. Every other month, maybe I would notice a slight imbalance for a few days where things seemed maybe slightly off, but I think that&#39;s pretty normal. Sometimes I would use an over-the-counter prebiotic ph-balancing gel if I noticed that, but it was relatively rare.
</p>
<p>
When I went back to Suporn for revision in 2019, I noticed guidance had slightly changed, and it was being recommended that you use feminine wash on your fingers, and just put that inside your vagina and wash out, maybe once a week or so. I didn&#39;t take on doing this as it didn&#39;t feel necessary.
</p>
<p>
However, I started sleeping with a man in the past year. I have unprotected sex with him, and sometimes he will cum inside me. Obviously this can upset the balance of things, so, just to make sure everything is &#39;out&#39; of me, sometimes after sex I will use ph-balanced wash on my fingers, and just kinda finger myself for a couple of seconds, and then squat over a showerhead to get it all out üôÉ I expect I probably don&#39;t need the ph-balanced wash at all, but on a psychological level at least, it does help me feel &#39;cleaner&#39;. Whenever I do end up doing that, I will use some ph-balanced vaginal moisturiser (I use &#39;YES VM&#39;. or if that&#39;s not available &#39;Sylk&#39;), just to make sure I am moisturised as any kind of soap is quite drying. I don&#39;t have issues with &#39;freshness&#39; generally if I don&#39;t do that process for several days. It&#39;s all quite normal as far as I can see.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Did you have any issues with granulation or necrosis?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
No I didn&#39;t... not that I can remember at least, but I expect I was maybe lucky in regards to granulation tissue which doesn&#39;t seem uncommon - it was certainly an issue for my ex-girlfriend, and quite distressing for her, making dilation quite difficult.
</p>
<p>
I never knew much about the necrosis risk until after the surgery when I would read in the discord chat/Facebook group about clitorises falling off. For months I was so frightened that I would be in the bath and notice my clitoris floating next to me... üò¨ Terrifying. It never happened though! It is of course quite rare, but I think it also helped being young and a non-smoker... furthermore, if that did ever happen, obviously there is the Chonburi organ back-up! A new clitoris can be created.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Is your ex-girlfriend&#39;s strap-on as big as it looks in pictures on your profile?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Haaa... yes it is! She is also 5ft 10&#34;, so that may give an even better idea of the size of that thing. It is certainly bigger than the biggest dilator in the set, though perhaps not by as much as you might think. It is maybe 7 or 8 inches, and very thick, however, it is also &#39;dual-textured&#39;, which basically means it feels softer on the outside and firmer and harder towards the middle.
</p>
<p>
The biggest thing to go inside me before that dildo was the biggest dilator in Suporn&#39;s set, and yet, I still was able to accommodate that dildo. It was very intense at first, but it went in, and feels amazing once you get used to the intensity. Because of my depth, I can only take maybe 2/3s of it, but it feels great, and I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a &#39;work-up-to-it&#39; kinda thing. It goes in fairly deep without working up to it, but then as you get into fucking, the vagina does seem to relax and &#39;stretch&#39;, and it goes in deeper.

Close-ups posted publicly?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don&#39;t think I do have any close-ups posted publicly, though there are some pictures and videos available online, but behind paywalls I&#39;m afraid. I may create something like that which I&#39;d be comfortable sharing more publicly in the future, but I&#39;ve never really been into the &#39;splay&#39; aesthetic, so don&#39;t tend to take pictures like that.
</p>
<p>
When I said the Chonburi organ is &#39;visible&#39;, that was probably a bad way of phrasing it. I think I can see it and identify it because I know the details of this surgery, but I think to a casual observer it would look similar to a part of any vaginal vestibule... I don&#39;t think it is noticeably different to the general range of cis vaginas, I just know the structures quite intimately I guess.
</p>
<p>
My anterior commissure was defined more within my revision surgery, but, I never had a posterior commissure created much within the surgeries... Suporn doesn&#39;t construct it in the first surgery, and when it came to revision, because I already had a lot of material, definition of the structure didn&#39;t seem worth the difficult recovery according to Suporn (I still wanted it, but he didn&#39;t give it to me). I do understand why though. I have seen some other results and the lack of it can be obvious when legs are splayed wide open, but for me,  it&#39;s not very obvious at all. I have enough labia down there to not look &#39;gaping&#39;.
</p>
<p>
I think one thing that I notice about my vulva compared to cis women is maybe that my clitoral hood and labia minora seem a little &#39;thicker&#39;, but I think this is probably not that noticeable, or relevant - I&#39;m sure there are many cis women with &#39;thicker&#39; labia than me out there. In fact, I&#39;m sure even in my limited sexual experience with women, I have been with one.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Hair problems?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I had no hair removal before surgery, and I wouldn&#39;t say I have hair problems. Perhaps within the first centimetre or two into my vaginal canal, there may be three or four hairs, which, because of their position, are always going to be missed with shaving. I tweeze them if I feel them, but they are not particularly visible, and they have never been obvious to any sexual partner.
</p>
<p>
If I had access to an open-minded electrologist, I imagine it would be a very simple procedure to get rid of any hair. Unfortunately, I do not have that access where I live, but at the same time, it&#39;s really not much of a problem at all - even if I had access, I would question whether the pain of it is worth it, compared to five minutes tweezing every few months.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Thailand in February
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I can&#39;t say I noticed much difference between February and August when I went the first time, or September when I went the third time. The experience is not really one that allows for tourism, unless of course you spend extended time there before surgery/after surgery. I only really went for the minimum amount of time I could get away with, and didn&#39;t do much touring. This was mainly for financial reasons, otherwise I would have gone earlier and made more of a holiday out of it.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How was the flight back? Did you go business class?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My poverty-stricken asssss has never flown business class at my own expense üòù I wish I had been able to do that on the flight back - it seems like a good idea. The flight was very uncomfortable, but thankfully it was direct. 14 hours with no stops was preferable to me, but I can see the benefits of having stops, especially if they are long stops and you were able to get a hotel for a night and use that time to dilate! I took sleeping pills and tried to sleep through it, but it was tough.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Is the Suporn discord still active?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I imagine it is! I am a member, but I have it on mute and haven&#39;t checked it for at least over a year. There are chat rooms in there for people who are currently in Chonburi having the surgery, but that&#39;s much less than half of the space there. A lot of it is about asking for advice at any stage of the surgery/recovery, sharing results, and exchanging information, so I think it should still be active for those reasons even when the clinic was closed.
</p>
<p>
Hope that all helps!

Since you say orgasmic ‚Äòsquirt‚Äô is the same mechanism as before, how about multiple orgasms? Can you have such?
</p>
<p>
They say men can have them if they don‚Äôt ejaculate, but from what I‚Äôve read it doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs a proper equivalent of female multiple squirting orgasms.

I&#39;m not OP, but I&#39;m 2.5 years on HRT and I can have multiple orgasms. Each successive orgasm requires stronger stimulation, but they also get progressively more intense as well. Each one is also accompanied by a small &#34;ejaculation&#34; (a trickle) of sticky, clear fluid.
</p>
<p>
So, no, it&#39;s not &#34;squirting&#34; like in porn videos. It&#39;s more like suddenly getting a
<em>
lot
</em>
wetter down there, although with less plumbing to move through I can see how that could still have a bit of force behind it.

Precisely! This is so cool to hear, and is similar to me I guess.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, &#39;squirting&#39; was for lack of a better word. I certainly don&#39;t gush like in porn videos üòÜ I just get very wet at orgasm, might start dripping, and will leave wet patches on sheets. I suspect that with each successive orgasm, the fluid produced might be less, but I&#39;ve never really measured that, and it&#39;s very hard to work out what is what during sex anyway.

Ooooh this is a really good question, and something I have thought about myself.
</p>
<p>
I was quite sexually precocious as a kid, which meant that I was bringing myself to orgasm before I began male-puberty. At that time, I absolutely was able to multi-orgasm, with each orgasm happening within a very short span of one another, if stimulation was maintained, and each being more powerful than the last generally. It was mind-blowing.
</p>
<p>
Upon undergoing a couple of years of that awful first puberty, I lost that ability around the same time I started ejaculating (I remember still trying to be able to do it, but it was very hard, if not eventually impossible, and I gave up - it seemed to fall away gradually though, rather than overnight).
</p>
<p>
I had developed issues with orgasm and sexual sensitivity in general before surgery - I just took quite a long time to get there, and I put that down to both the dysphoria I had (but didn&#39;t recognise the full-extent of until after surgery), and I also put it down to being on the SSRI Sertraline, which I stopped in time for surgery as it is contraindicated with tramadol - this means that if you are on SSRIs at the time of surgery, you are only allowed to take relatively mild painkillers upon leaving hospital. That was a nightmare for my ex-girlfriend who had surgery 6 months before me!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, to get back to the topic, I only really began having sex which made sense to me about a year ago, so two years post-op, with a man. In having sex with him regularly throughout the past year, I now reach orgasm almost all the time when we have sex, and usually before him, and relatively quickly (it may have taken 40 minutes before, now it can be as little as 7 minutes). I also have had multiple orgasms within relatively short sex sessions, and they also tend to get more powerful as I go on (but not all the time).
</p>
<p>
I say this because there have been so many changes in my psyche, body, and sexual response since HRT and surgery, it really wouldn&#39;t surprise me at this point if, with consistent practice, I can &#39;retrain&#39; my body to be able to multi-orgasm. I would say I have enough experience with multi-orgasms prior to first puberty to say that I am not there yet, but, I also have experience of my body changing in ways I did not think was possible, particularly regarding my sexual response, just because of the right context, consistent practice, and just becoming more comfortable with sex/myself.
</p>
<p>
Stimulation with a doxxxy wand vibrator can bring me to orgasm within a few minutes. I imagine if I made a concentrated effort, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if I could rekindle the ability to have multi-orgasms again within that context, and I think that would eventually be carried over to sex.
</p>
<p>
It is true for me that ability to ejaculate did coincide with losing the ability to multi-orgasm, but another issue I had pre-everything with multi-orgasms was that not only was I totally &#39;satisfied&#39; after one orgasm (and probably also was suffering from crushing dysphoria after reaching orgasm and didn&#39;t want to continue touching myself/having sex), it also became quite physically uncomfortable to continue stimulation past the point of orgasm. I don&#39;t have any of those issues since HRT and SRS, and the &#39;ejaculate&#39; is much reduced to just getting quite wet upon orgasm (and just to be clear that fluid is nothing like male-ejaculate!). Because of these factors, I feel like the future is bright there. Maybe I&#39;ll try the experiment one day soon and report back.üôÉ

Wow, thanks for that thorough reply!
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm surprised you say you orgasm multiple times within relatively short sex sessions (even growing in power), but don‚Äôt even consider that to be multi-orgasm, and you still have to chase what you had prior to puberty.
</p>
<p>
It sounds to me like what you do now where you climax several times in a night is akin to men who climax several times in a night ‚Äì and the kicker is that such men would claim to be multi orgasmic, but what you‚Äôre saying is that real multiple orgasms are something different yet! Am I picking that up right?
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Like you, I also began masturbating to orgasm pre-puberty. I started when I was 3 or 4 years old. I remember being able to orgasm a few times in a night or session, until I got bored of it, but don‚Äôt remember them being chained off of each other. When I hit puberty and ejaculated for the first time, I quit masturbating to climax because I did not want to make a mess (there were literally just a few times when I accidentally did; I was about 16 the first time I intentionally rubbed it out again until I jizzed).
</p>
<p>
I never treated my penis like most guys do. I never ‚Äújacked off‚Äù or ‚Äúfapped‚Äù; for me it&#39;s prone masturbation: rubbing the base of it against my body and grinding on the shaft, my dick either smooshed up against my tummy or pointed down at my feet. This probably plays in to why albeit being 32 and having had sex with tons of different partners, never once have I orgasmed or had anyone else give me an orgasm. Which really fucking sucks. I‚Äôve never even had a prostate orgasm.
</p>
<p>
I bring this up because I‚Äôm worried about having bottom surgery and being able to feel pleasure. I can masturbate myself to climax still, but it‚Äôs never quick, and even pre HRT was not something I could even do on a daily basis, let alone multiple times rapidly. The only good news is that after I started HRT, being buttsexed at least felt good in such an intense way, that it makes me think in the future climaxing from it is possible.
</p>
<p>
edit: I‚Äôve had a magic wand and different vibrators on my penis, both base and tip and frenulum, and that never got me off. I‚Äôve had vibrators and toys and many actual dicks in my ass, and never gotten off either.
<strong>
If I can‚Äôt get off with a vibrator on my dick, do you think I will be able to if it‚Äôs fashioned in to a clit?

Hey, so in regards to your edit... that&#39;s a super good question!
</p>
<p>
I never really thought about the sensation of vibrators on penises vs clitoris, however, I know I definitely did have the opportunity to try vibrators with my pre-SRS junk before, and the sensation is TOTALLY different.
</p>
<p>
Maybe this is due to Suporn&#39;s technique preserving and redirecting nerve bundles/a result of just having surgery in itself, but the clitoris area feels so much more sensitive to me than the glands before surgery. It is almost like all of the sensation in the glands originally is now more concentrated and comes from a smaller more intense point, and moreover, the sensation in general seems to have increased anyway - though that could be due to no longer taking sertraline post-op.
</p>
<p>
I think I may have had a better-than-average result on this point though, but all Suporn girls I have spoken to do seem to be orgasmic after surgery ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Hey!
</p>
<p>
So for me, multiple orgasms like the ones I would have had pre-puberty, happen like this:
</p>
<p>
You orgasm, you continue stimulation, the orgasm kind of continues and is drawn out, increasing and decreasing in intensity in kind of ripples, and maybe dies away, but the tension still remains, and if you keep up momentum, the feelings increase in intensity again until you reach another high peak of orgasm, which is usually better than the first, and it continues like this until it dies way or you/your partner become too tired.
</p>
<p>
So right now, with HRT and surgery, I can continue having sex very comfortably pleasurably most of the time, after reaching orgasm. That continued stimulation can bring me to another orgasm several minutes later (less if I&#39;m really concentrating on it/getting the stimulation I need). However, I would say that the tension usually falls away enough in that time for each orgasm to feel like a separate event, compared to what I had pre-puberty for example.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if I would now be able to reduce the space between orgasms, and kind of &#39;ride&#39; the ripples and maintain the tension up until to the next orgasm. It feels like something I could perhaps learn if I masturbated and concentrated on it, but as I wrote below, I&#39;m not really a fan of getting myself ordinarily - if I was, maybe I would be able to give a more definitive answer by now over whether it is possible or not!
</p>
<p>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
Your story is super interesting! I discovered  masturbation maybe when I was about 7. My best-friend was the girl living next-door to me, who was a couple of years older. We were inseparable as kids, like twin sisters. I told her I had discovered this sensation, and she told me she had discovered the same thing, and we thought we were the only people who had discovered it in the world, and it was going to make us rich if we patented the techniques and taught them to other people .... lol. I don&#39;t think we identified it much with sex at first. We didn&#39;t really know what sex was! Anyway, after walking back from school together, we would go up into my bedroom, and just lie on my bed masturbating together almost in a race to see how many orgasms we could have. Back then, there didn&#39;t seem to be any real difference between our orgasms, and we both seemed to be capable of the same kind of multiple orgasms.
</p>
<p>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
With regards to the world of orgasms, I definitely see parallels between your experience and mine, though your issues do seem perhaps more entrenched - but there is a lot of hope!
</p>
<p>
Orgasms became better for me in terms of sensation after surgery, though they may have been harder to reach in the initial year or two following surgery when I was still healing. I also didn&#39;t realise just how much dysphoria hampered my sexual response until after I had SRS. Finding the right sexual partner after surgery really helped me grow more accustomed to orgasming during sex, and reduced the time to orgasm quite a lot after I had gotten used to having sex with him and we knew each other&#39;s bodies fairly well.
</p>
<p>
Surgery for me opened up the possibility of different types of orgasms... of course the easiest way to orgasm for most women with vaginas, cis or trans, is by clitoral stimulation, however, although I find clitoral orgasms pleasant, they are kind of underwhelming compared to clitoral orgasms with vaginal penetration - and vaginal penetration gets me off quicker. If I had to make a choice between only vaginal penetration, or only clitoral stimulation for the rest of my life, I would choose vaginal penetration because it just feels so good when it&#39;s done right.
</p>
<p>
Although I can orgasm just from vaginal penetration, it is rare, but I suspect this is due more to how I have sex rather than lack of capacity... although even with vaginal orgasms, because sex is never really done in a scientific method kind of way, I&#39;m sure my clit would have been touched at some point beforehand.
</p>
<p>
With all of this in mind, I have identified three generally distinct types of orgasm I am now able to have:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Just clitoral - nice, feels like a &#39;good&#39; orgasm from before SRS, but underwhelming compared to:
</li>
<li>
Vaginal penetration orgasm - incredible, especially when mixed with clitoral stimulation. I don&#39;t need to be necessarily be touching my clit to cum, but penetration does seem to perhaps stimulate my clit indirectly, from underneath (it might be my clit, it might be something else... either way, it&#39;s a spot a couple of inches in towards the top which feels AMAZING).
</li>
<li>
Anal penetration orgasm - I never had these before SRS, and thought they were kind of mythical. I always felt uncomfortable with anal sex, and that was one reason why I had SRS actually (I didn&#39;t actually have high levels of dysphoria to my junk before, but sex was a pain). However, I have been able to cum now just from hard, intense, anal penetration, without touching my clit, or having any kind of vaginal penetration. This is a really powerful orgasm, similar to vaginal, maybe even more intense.
</li>
</ol>

Sorry for the reply after 4 months. I went to Suporn too. I managed to have over 11 orgasms in a row and I can have them in minute intervals if I&#39;m in the right mindset. It doesn&#39;t require stronger stimulation, actually it becomes easier. At some point my brain just goes zombie mode lol.
</p>
<p>
So yes this is definitely possible.
</p>
<p>
Squirting however does not happen (I&#39;m glad about that)

Ok, this is

interesting... You&#39;re the second girl I know of who took Accutane as a teenager, and ended up with below-average masculinization. (My other friend got hit with testosterone hard in her early 20s, I&#39;m glad you managed to avoid that!) Let me guess: you have a flawless feminine voice too?
</p>
<p>
I have a pet theory that Accutane interferes with the HPG axis in young people and can hinder T production... You don&#39;t happen to have issues with anxiety or depression too, do you?

Oh, in regards to my voice, it is very feminine. That was one of the ‚Äòeasier‚Äô aspects of transition.
</p>
<p>
Although my voice did break, it didn‚Äôt break ‚Äòmuch‚Äô, and it was relatively easy to reach a feminine default - it mainly involved me learning to not artificially push it down, as I had for a couple of years trying to pass as a boy.
</p>
<p>
It is undoubtably feminine, but I guess has some husky aspects to it. Maybe a bit like Miley Cyrus? I can‚Äôt sing though ü§ì

Yup, that tracks with my friend&#39;s experience. She trained her voice down to get people to stop teasing her about her voice, so feminizing her voice was a simple matter of, well, not doing that any more! She&#39;s also shorter than her siblings. The anxiety/depression is probably inconclusive, it&#39;s not hard to find trans women with issues like that.
</p>
<p>
I feel like someone really ought to do some sort of Science to study this out. Is there a connection between Accutane and particularly petite/feminine trans women? I&#39;m really curious about this now! lol

Fascinating! It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. I understand it is linked to being shorter as well in adolescents. I‚Äôm 5ft 8, but as far as women in my family go, that‚Äôs quite short - and much shorter than the men!
</p>
<p>
My brother also didn‚Äôt masculinise ‚Äòmuch‚Äô until his late teens, by which time I had already begun estrogen. I don‚Äôt think my brother took accutane though. I took my first course when I was 15, and then again when I was around 17.
</p>
<p>
I do have issues with anxiety and depression, but, these were apparent in some form from early childhood, my initial anxiety issues certainly developed due to how I was treated as a very feminine boy in a conservative and small-town environment.
</p>
<p>
First puberty had a disastrous effect on my mental health though, and I‚Äôve not yet fully recovered from all the knock-on effects that had in my life (I dropped out of school at 14 - before accutane - because I just couldn‚Äôt cope with life for a few years), but I‚Äôm doing a lot better since transitioning!

I went to physical therapy for my pelvic floor after surgery. (I&#39;d recommend it for everyone, helped with my healing so much). Anyways she specializes in the pelvis and has seen several cis and trans patients and based on her experience and knowledge my pelvic muscles and such are well within norm of a cis woman. That was very validating. I asked her if she could tell any differences. She said yes but only because she specializes in the area and works with pelvises every day. The differences are small subtle enough to be easily missed unless directly looking for them and knowing what to look for. One example was a very slight angle difference in feeling through to the pelvic bone. (as her finger was deep inside me showing me where ha ha. It was a little embarrassing but by that time we had several sessions together and I was pretty comfortable with her.)

Probably won&#39;t make sense to a lot of people but I am uncomfortable sharing who my surgeon is right now. I really admire that you are able to do a whole AMA thread. I am pretty sure I would start getting super uncomfortable after a short while. It&#39;s not like talking about a book or restaurant but this is a part of me and a very private and permanent part that I love. I&#39;ve had people say critical things about my results and it hurts a lot. Not like a troll, those people are easier to brush off. They were just saying their honest opinion and it happened to hurt me very deeply.

Hey Clara,

<p>
Thank you so much!! You‚Äôre so sweet to say that.

I will certainly keep this subreddit in mind if I were to post further pictures, and I‚Äôm always so happy to answer questions on it because I know that information and result pictures was exactly what I needed a few years ago, when I was making the decision to have SRS or not.

I had Dr. Suporn perform SRS on me a week ago actually. I&#39;m in Thailand now, recovering. If anyone wants some questions answered, I&#39;ll try to answer!

Suporn is doing my surgery in September. Super happy he decided to take a few more surgeries. I was wondering how many months into recovery did you feel ready for another surgery. I&#39;m thinking of scheduling a revision rhinoplasty later this year but dont want to rush it?

Hey, that‚Äôs great news! Good luck on your surgery üòä
</p>
<p>
I suppose that questions depends on the kind of surgery. You would probably need at least 6 months, but that is more due to the dilation schedule which at 6 months is allowed to be reduced to once a day, but I find this varies amongst people - at 6 months post-op for me was actually one of the hardest times in the whole procedure, because my body was forming scar tissue so quickly, I needed to dilate at least 2 times a day. I took a break on one day for my birthday and lost an inch of depth for a couple of months, and only managed to regain half an inch with dilation afterwards.
</p>
<p>
All in all, the surgery itself didn‚Äôt take that much out of me, and I could probably have had another surgery 3-6 months later with no issue. However, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anything that would compromise your ability to dilate for at least 9 months after surgery to be safe.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt know your age, but supposedly recovery can ironically be a bit harder for younger people than older people, because we ‚Äòheal‚Äô a bit quicker and more aggressively, which means more dilation - and more difficult dilation at that!
</p>
<p>
A more difficult recovery period is common with Suporn, and I would say it was about 9 months after surgery that my life felt less dominated by dilation, but double that for dilation to take only 5 minutes and to be able to go without it for weeks and months without losing depth (but also while having regular penetrative sex)

Thank you! That&#39;s exactly what I needed to know. I&#39;m 31:/ so maybe I&#39;m old enough now for it to be a little easier.

<p>
How much material did you have to begin with? And did you go back for the free revision?

Ah it is great! I am sexually functional, and sex makes a lot of sense now... I always thought I hated sex before I started having it after SRS, now I realise I just had quite bad dysphoria previously.
</p>
<p>
I would say orgasms are better, and this was apparent even just a few months after surgery.
</p>
<p>
I seem to have orgasms from both just clitoral stimulation, and just vaginal penetration - of course, it‚Äôs easier to orgasm with both at the same time, but I find vaginal penetration orgasms much more powerful generally.

Hey, so first of I wanna say thank you sooooo sooo much! This has been the most detailed and informative thread I&#39;ve ever found on any vaginoplasty method as far as I can remember and I&#39;m extremely thankful for all of this info that usually is so hard to come by!
</p>
<p>
I have a bunch of questions, some newly created within this thread and many more have already been answered. Don&#39;t really know where to start, so I guess I&#39;ll just approximately order them by the organ concerned.  This should be obvious, but I just want to emphasize again that I don&#39;t want you to answer anything you feel uncomfortable taking about :)
</p>
<p>
In retrospect I also realize that I put down lots of technical or medical questions that you might not be able to answer, so if that&#39;s the case, don&#39;t worry about it.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Okay, so I&#39;ve read you say that you went back in for revision to minimize and neaten your inner labia. What did the original result look like?  From almost all result photos I&#39;ve seen across several surgeons, the inner labia were always pretty neat, small and almost (or, in some cases, completely) invisible. It&#39;s not that I dislike that look, but I would personally much prefer more of a &#39;butterfly&#39; aesthetic, as in larger, more pronounced inner labia. Is that something you think can be achieved or is even the norm before revision? Is there any margin for accommodation to personal preference in a surgery? Did Dr. Suporn ask you about what kind of aesthetics you&#39;d prefer, for instance?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;m not a native speaker and while I&#39;ve studied some basic anatomy, I&#39;m not well-versed with the rather minor details... so I was wondering, when you&#39;re talking about the anterior commissure, is that just the clitoral hood? How does the clitoral hood look eventually? I&#39;ve seen several pictures of other surgeons&#39; results and always felt like it was strangely missing, or the inner labia were connected in such a way to create some semblance of clitoral hood, which for some reason wasn&#39;t aesthetically pleasing enough to my eyes.  At the same time I&#39;ve often seen photos which looked to me like the part that I consider to be the posterior commissure (the skin fold at the lower junction of the labia) was partly covering the vaginal opening, making it difficult to enter frontally with a dildo or penis. Does that observation describe your result adequately and if not, what does that part look like?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What is the size of your clitoris / the standard clitoris that the Suporn clinic creates? What does it look like as compared to cis women?  Can you tell a difference in sensation of the clitoris in relation to the glans penis? Is there a loss of feeling associated with what I suppose is simply a smaller outer area and less nerve endings?  Also, how the hell can there be a clitoris backup? Does the clinic just save what&#39;s left of the glans? o.o Does that mean in case of necrosis I could literally just go in for an emergency revision and get a new clit connected to my nerves?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In one of your replies you compared the Chonburi organ (in sensation, I think) to the cis clitoris&#39; crura, and while I&#39;ve heard of the Chonburi organ, I couldn&#39;t place it on an anatomical map.  I suppose it does not envelop the urethra and vagina as the crura do?! Could you tell me a little more about what it&#39;s made of, what it looks like, where it&#39;s situated and how it feels?  One thing I was always sad not to be able to get was the erectile tissue below the outer labia (the clitoral bulbs of vestibule I think?), cause I love the look and feel of puffy outer labia, but that is not something the Suporn clinic can create, can it? Or is there e.g. some special way to repurpose the erectile tissue of the penis shaft? I wish that was a possibility...
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How do you get vaginal orgasms? What kind of tissue can be stimulated to get such intense feelings? The prostate? Do you have an explanation for the sensations you said you get with stimulation of the upper vaginal wall and the back of the vaginal canal?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Does the Suporn clinic really redirect the bulbourethral glands into the vagina? That sounds amazing!  So I know that for those to produce lubrication, there needs to be some previous stimulation - or excitement at least, I guess :D How much lubrication is there previous to that stimulation (in random everyday situations I guess?) and how is it produced? Overall, how much lubrication do you produce?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To expand on the question about smell: You said something like your vagina smells &#39;neutral&#39;, &#39;human&#39;. Can you tell whether the smell is similar to the vaginas of cis women? Do you have any basis for comparison in taste of fluids and if so, is there any noticeable difference? I definitely like the smell and taste of cis vaginas and would hope for something similar :)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Also I would be super happy if anyone could direct me to any sources about the details of the procedure, aesthetic, sensational and functional outcomes of the different operation techniques and their up- and downsides - most importantly the Chonburi method and peritoneal pull-through, but also penile inversion ‚ô°
</p>
</li>
</ol>

Finally, for the record I&#39;d like to state that I, too, would love to see some more detailed pictures of your anatomy - as you can probably tell from all of my questions :p But I absolutely understand that those are your private parts and if you&#39;d like some privacy, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that!  You do look fucking gorgeous though and your vulva is definitely one of the best results I&#39;ve seen so far!

Hey! Thanks so much for all the lovely things you&#39;ve said. Sorry to get back a bit late on these questions - I&#39;ve been trying hard to answer all the comments as accurately and in as much detail as possible, and there have been quite a lot... anyway, here are my answers:
</p>
<p>
(again, I&#39;m going to have to do this in separate posts because I exceeded the character limit for reddit)
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Is larger labia possible with Dr Suporn?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I would say that with Suporn, unless you have very little starting material, larger and fuller labia are what you can typically expect after surgery. That was what my surgery result was like, and I still have relatively full labia now even after the cosmetic revision - it can still be stretched into a &#39;butterfly&#39; shape, but it is generally neater now.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What is the anterior commissure? What did it look like before revision? What does it look like now?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The anterior commissure is the clitoral hood area. While it was certainly there after the initial surgery, I found that it sat just slightly above my clitoris rather than touching it, but this was only apparent when things were stretched a bit - it wasn&#39;t noticeable in everyday scenarios. With the revision, Dr Suporn basically just made the hood slightly lower down. With regards to the posterior commissure, my labia at that point do not &#39;connect&#39;, but they do end at pretty much the same point.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What does your posterior commissure look like?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So Suporn doesn&#39;t create a posterior commissure within the first surgery precisely because of the issues that you described - it can heal in a way which makes dilation/sex difficult. This doesn&#39;t tend to create a distinctly &#39;different&#39; looking vagina for a lot of people, as the labia still end in pretty much the same place, but that does vary between people - for some, it can make the vagina look a bit like it is &#39;gaping&#39; when legs are spread. I didn&#39;t have this problem much myself because I had quite a lot of material to begin with, and because there was a lot of material, and because they end at the same place, it looks a lot like a structure is there, and it&#39;s only when I am very unnaturally spread that you can notice it&#39;s not there, and even then, it&#39;s not evident unless you are looking for it. (It might be interesting to note that I have a cis-female friend who had her posterior commissure &#39;cut&#39; during a surgery because she was having issues with sex... so she had surgery to have, in this instance at least, a vagina more like mine, and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not uncommon)
</p>
<p>
Suporn often creates the posterior commissure structure if you were to go back for a revision surgery. I did request it myself when I went back as I wanted to be as close to cis-looking as possible, but, he didn&#39;t give it to me. I think he concluded that the result I had was already pretty good that it wasn&#39;t worth the much more complicated recovery process (and inability to dilate for a good several weeks)... while I was in Thailand for revision, there was another girl around my age who was having a revision surgery for her posterior commissure around the same time as me, but, she had so many complications in getting that structure that she required a further two small operations, and had to stay in Thailand far longer than she expected.
</p>
<p>
Even with all of this in mind, if I come into money, I would still consider going back to Thailand and seeing Dr Bank for a second revision, maybe to define more structure,  and to request a posterior commissure. In the case of having that surgery though, I would plan to be in Thailand for a month or so, rather than the 2 weeks I had there when I got revision.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What is the size of the clitoris?  What&#39;s the size of clitoris Suporn tends to make? What does it look like as compared to cis women? Can you tell a difference in sensation of the clitoris in relation to the glans penis? Is there a loss of feeling? How can there be a clitoris backup - does the clinic just save what&#39;s left of the glans?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So as far as I can see, my clitoris looks like it is the same size as a pea, and it is shaped like a pearl. It is quite easy to find, and I only have to pull the clitoral hood back a small bit to expose it. I say this latter bit because with my ex-girlfriend who also had SRS with Suporn, her clitoris was much smaller than mine, and buried more under her clitoral hood. In this sense, I don&#39;t think that Suporn creates a &#39;standard&#39; clitoris, rather, there is a variation which comes across as variation in cis vaginas. I don&#39;t think there is any relevant material difference between people when it comes to the feasibility of constructing a clitoris in this kind of surgery, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if Suporn made my clitoris slightly larger and more prominent because I had a bigger dick before surgery so it felt more natural, and my girlfriend&#39;s clitoris much smaller and less obvious because she had the opposite issue. I think he makes an effort to give you a clitoris you may more naturally have based on your starting material, if you were born cis. But, that is conjecture based on my experiences - he might not think about that much at all!
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned above, the sensation of the clitoris feels similar to the sensation in the glans pre-op, only much more concentrated and more intense. I&#39;m not sure how this works, but I expect it is something to do with preserving the nerve bundle, but attaching it to a smaller amount of tissue. Very direct stimulation by the fingers of the clitoris, not through the clitoral hood, can be so intense as to actually be uncomfortable - tongue is ok, but quite intense when focussed on just the clit. It almost feels like tickling, it&#39;s good, but it feels more like sex if the whole area is licked with more pressure, rather than light flicks on just the clit. But that could just be me ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
Suporn does indeed keep what remains of the glans termed the &#39;Chonburi organ;, and places it &#39;below and behind&#39; the clitoris, just above/wrapped around the top of the urethral opening. This means that they are mainly hidden behind labia, but even when exposed, I wouldn&#39;t say they give the impression of looking notably dissimilar from part of the general vaginal vestibule in most cases - but I know they can be more obvious in some people, and there has been at least a handful of revisions where girls have asked for it to be removed, and Suporn will oblige 18 months after initial surgery when there is no risk of clitoral necrosis.
</p>
<p>
So not only does this organ provide back-up material for clitoral necrosis if that ever were to happen within the first months of healing, it also is another area of sexual sensation. It seems pretty clever.

Just one little clarification: so they use leftover glans material to create the Chonburi organ - and in case of necrosis they can cut some of it back out to create clit #2?

That is correct.
</p>
<p>
I know that sounds kinda odd, but it&#39;s really not something you tend to notice in terms of cosmetics or sensation... it certainly doesn&#39;t feel like what is sounds like.
</p>
<p>
It just means that you are slightly more sensate than I think with other GCS methods, and you never have to worry about clitoral necrosis.
</p>
<p>
I think some people may have the organ removed during revision at least a year after, but as far as I can see, they are in the extreme minority. It&#39;s not an intrusive aspect in the results generally.
</p>
<p>
I just went on Suporn&#39;s site because they used to have really good examples of results there with things quite &#39;open&#39;, unfortunately for whatever silly reason they seem to have taken the results off their site. However, within those results, you can make out the structure if it is pointed out (though not what it&#39;s made of), and it doesn&#39;t look in anyway odd - in fact, if anything, it contributes to the appearance of a vaginal vestibule.

Oh, I don&#39;t mind - I think it&#39;s great if there&#39;s some extra sensation, actually :)
</p>
<p>
Hm too bad. But you do get to see some results in consultation, right?
</p>
<p>
Talking of which: how did the whole pre-surgery process work? Did you have phone or video calls to clear up any questions and uncertainties?  Is there any support for getting a visa and getting to Chonburi?

Well previously for me, the results were all publicly available online - I&#39;m really surprised that they have taken those down! They were really detailed, but I suspect it may have something to do with the publication of Suporn&#39;s paper on his technique in 2019, which contains results, along with graphic pictures and descriptions of the details of surgery üò¨
</p>
<p>
Very fortunately, somebody sweet did send me a link to this a couple of weeks ago. I don&#39;t think this is supposed to be public content, but as it is within the realms of public interest, if you can handle graphic images of surgery, standard results can be found here :
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16bXHFAgiKbyQjEqGohzy2BbE_wlteMTS/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/16bXHFAgiKbyQjEqGohzy2BbE_wlteMTS/view
</a>
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t remember the whole pre-surgery process that well to be honest, but I think it was quite old fashioned, and there wasn&#39;t anything like a video call. There was a long exchange of emails, medical questionnaires,  details sent regarding the technique and result, and probably also surgery requirements (things like health and weight requirements, but also a letter from a gender doctor recommending GCS - everything to be in line with WPATH guidelines).
</p>
<p>
I think there is probably the capacity to do phone/video calls with clinic staff, but Suporn himself always was rather busy dealing with patients who were there in person (he took on surgery every day). I think there would be support for Visas and so on, but I didn&#39;t really look into this, as I didn&#39;t spend enough time there at any point to actually need a visa - I&#39;m quite sure that if you need to extend time there, you can get a visa while in Thailand, and that seems relatively straight-forward to do having observed a couple of people do it while I was there.
</p>
<p>
In my experience, the clinic is very responsive to emails, and goes into a lot of detail when it is needed. This is true both before surgery, and also if you have questions during your recovery. I&#39;m sure they would be just as responsive to me now if I were to have questions. My impression is that they see themselves as providing a &#39;lifelong service&#39;.

Part 2:
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can labia become puffy during arousal? Is there a way to repurpose erectile tissue?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So my impression is that Suporn does tend to keep a lot of erectile tissue, and while this never caused any big issues in me, I have heard some rare reports that it caused issues in others/made others feel dysphoric when aroused. I think I may have had some small amount of erectile tissue removed during revision, but I&#39;m not sure - my urethra protruded a small amount before revision surgery, and I don&#39;t know if this was due to erectile tissue or not, but it was corrected during revision.
</p>
<p>
My labia absolutely do become puffier when I am aroused, and I tend to feel &#39;fuller&#39; down there as I get aroused. I suspect this is because of blood rushing to the area, and the remaining erectile tissue, and I do swell a tiny bit, but I think it&#39;s noticeable to me because I can feel it and things become more sensitive - I&#39;ve noticed it doesn&#39;t look particularly different however apart from slightly puffier labia, and in that sense, it feels within the realms of &#39;cis&#39;.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How do you get vaginal orgasms? What kind of tissue can be stimulated to get such intense feelings? Could it be the prostate?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On this front, I don&#39;t think I can provide a definitive answer. I can only guess at the biology of it, and only be certain of the fact that I do have vaginal penetration orgasms which are more powerful generally than clitoral orgasms.
</p>
<p>
I note that I am quite sensitive around the entrance to my vagina, where there does seem to be some firmer tissue. This may be just erectile tissue, or it may be the back of the Chonburi organ mentioned about. I imagine it&#39;s probably both. A little further inside and towards the top (in the direction of my belly button), is the most sensitive spot. I suspect this may be whatever remains of my prostate, which I believe is homologous to the cis female &#39;g-spot&#39; anyway. When that part of me is stimulated through fingers or PIV sex, I will reach orgasm fairly quickly, and it will be powerful.
</p>
<p>
I suppose that with my type of SRS, all of the sensitive tissue in &#39;male&#39; anatomy from the glans to the prostate, is generally just moved much closer together, so it all gets stimulated at the same time with PIV sex/fingers, and that combined with the feeling of fullness with penetration, and the psychological euphoria of having sex that makes sense, can lead to pretty great orgasms, for me at least.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Does the Suporn clinic really redirect the bulbourethral glands into the vagina? How much lubrication is there previous to sexual stimulation? How is it produced? Overall, how much lubrication do you produce?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Suporn method does redirect the bulbourethral glands into the vagina, which means that for those who produce a lot of &#39;pre-cum&#39; pre-srs, this will be directed into the vagina and can result in significant self-lubrication, as was the case for my ex-girlfriend. Unfortunately for me, I only produced pre-cum up until I took certain medication, and after that point, I didn&#39;t produce any before surgery. I wouldn&#39;t say that I don&#39;t produce any at all now during arousal, because there is often some if I am aroused, but it&#39;s not enough for comfortable sex, and I will use a ph-balanced lube if it&#39;s at hand, and if it&#39;s not/I&#39;m having more spontaneous sex, my boyfriend will often just use spit, and that works pretty well.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that the inside of my vagina is never &#39;dry&#39; - it is always moist. Where that moisture comes from, I&#39;m not entirely sure though. I suspect it must partially from from the bulbourethral glands/prostate, but a gynaecologist I spoke to thinks it could also be some of the oestrogen I take being concentrated in that vaginal tissue. Whatever it is, it is not sweat. It has none of the characteristics of sweat, and certainly doesn&#39;t smell like sweat.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can you tell whether the smell is similar to the vaginas of cis women? Do you have any basis for comparison in taste of fluids and, if so, is there any noticeable difference?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any smell left on fingers or whatever tends to be very subtle most of the time. I don&#39;t really know how to describe it other than kind of like vagina, human, very slightly sour, maybe sometimes slightly sweaty if I haven&#39;t showered that day. I&#39;d probably have to have a long think if I wanted to describe it exactly, and of course it can change depending on what I&#39;ve been doing with my vagina, like sex, and whether I am having an issue like BV or not, in which case it can be quite strong and maybe like ammonia or old gym socks (thankfully that&#39;s not common at all anymore, and only came up in the first year of healing).
</p>
<p>
Because it is something that I was both curious and self-conscious about, I did ask my ex-girlfriend several times, and she had previously been with quite a lot of cis girls... she just said it was normal, as expected. Both the gay women and the straight men I&#39;ve been with didn&#39;t say anything was different about it, even when I pushed my current partner to name differences like that, he said that there weren&#39;t any, apart from me not getting as wet as most of the women he has been with.
</p>
<p>
In regards to taste... I don&#39;t have much of a reference point on that. I seem to be mostly tasteless if I am clean, which I pretty much always am. When I cum, I get quite wet suddenly, and this is like &#39;thick water&#39; with a very mildly salty and creamy taste, maybe kind of like slightly salty milk. I&#39;ve only ever &#39;tasted&#39; myself like this on someone else&#39;s fingers or dick though, so there may have been more in there than just my own fluid...

Wow, thank you so much! Don&#39;t worry, that wasn&#39;t a late reply at all, especially considering all the minute detail you go into! I&#39;ve been trying to keep up with all the other responses you posted, but clearly you type faster than I read ;)
</p>
<p>
Plus all those insights are invaluable! I&#39;ve been waiting for that kind of information for two years already, who cares about another minute or two. I don&#39;t think I could have found this anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
The best part is that you gave all the right answers ‚ù§ You blew away all of my worries! This is so much better than expected.  I think what kept me most from being certain I wanted GCS in the last years were exactly those little details about looks, sensation and function.  You have no idea how meaningful all of your replies are to me. You just gave me certainty that this is exactly what I want! Thank youuuu üò≠

üò≠ this was so touching to read! It makes me overjoyed to hear that you feel confident about the decision.

I really hope that when you have the surgery, it&#39;s everything that you want and need it to be. I&#39;m sure either way that you will be thrilled by the results.

Hahaha, I was debating mentioning, I think the long dark hair looks better on you! The wig is cute, but the bangs aren&#39;t really doing it for me and I think the longer hair frames your face better.

Haha! I&#39;m glad you did mention it!
</p>
<p>
I started playing around with wigs and make-up in the past year because I like being able to create different looks... I&#39;m also secure enough in my femininity finally to not get dysphoria hang-ups doing it because of the parallels with cross-dressers/drag. A lot of my cis-female friends are queer and creative people and do the same.
</p>
<p>
I appreciate that you think my natural hair looks better! Personally, I&#39;ve grown super bored of having long brown hair these days, but I&#39;m so reluctant to do anything radical with it for so many reasons, all of which relate to being trans haha...
</p>
<p>
Firstly, I had shorter hair for so long, I feel like I really need to &#39;get the most&#39; out of long hair now. I also used to bleach my hair all the time as a teenager and put different colours through it, so it felt good to return to my natural hair colour when I grew it out. I&#39;m also super scared of cutting my hair shorter just in case people gender me as a boy, but I realise that is probably ridiculous at this point! üòÜ

Ah, yep, I totally get not wanting to mess with your hair. I have super soft light blonde hair myself, one of the (very) few things I actually liked about myself pre-transition. I always kept it cut short, so I&#39;ll never forget, deciding not to get a haircut was the first deliberate step I took towards transitioning. Hard to believe that was only three years ago!
</p>
<p>
Now my hair is down to the middle of my back and in dire need of a trim, but I still can&#39;t imagine getting it dyed or cut into any funky styles. Almost seems like sacrilege at this point! Maybe I&#39;ll do that in the future, after I&#39;ve gotten FFS and grown my hair out long enough to donate (which I really want to do).
</p>
<p>
Y&#39;know, now you&#39;ve got me thinking, I might see about playing with wigs myself... I have zero hangups about that, I got into &#34;crossdressing&#34; before I figured out I was trans, so I have fond memories of the euphoria I felt when I got my first wig. I&#39;m not sure how I could improve on my natural hair though!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and yes, that is ridiculous, but as long as you&#39;re aware of that then it&#39;s perfectly normal and valid to feel that way! üòâ

I would loveeee to have your kind of hair! I was very blonde as a kid, but that gave way to brown which goes quite light, even reddish, in the sun.
</p>
<p>
Not cutting my hair felt so good, and cutting it into styles still feels like sacrilege even now! I had always wanted to grow it out, and did indeed have it quite long as a teenager, but I was always afraid of looking like a boy with long hair rather than feminine, and so could never quite take the step to let it grow out fully, particularly when it grew into that &#39;awkward&#39; stage when I would become so self-conscious, I would just cut it.
</p>
<p>
I was amazed (and euphoric) to discover that even pre-HRT, growing my hair out made most strangers gender me as female, but I was also so frightened about being discovered not to be a girl and mistreated, as I had been badly bullied as a kid for being visibly queer. It took a lot to overcome that fear of risking being seen as a feminine boy, but I did manage to overcome it and transition, and can live as a relatively normal woman in my 20s now... just with unusual formative years üòÖ
</p>
<p>
You should definitely go for playing with different wigs! They are so much fun, and... you don&#39;t have to cut your hair to be able to have different funky styles! You do however have to become good at braiding so you can hide long hair under a wig cap haha.
</p>
<p>
You could so pull-off a purple wig! You&#39;d look hot! üíú

Thanks so much for the sweet comments!
</p>
<p>
I really identify with some of the things you&#39;ve said here.
</p>
<p>
For me, I was also really feminine as a kid, but I remember that by 3/4 years old, I was repressing that around other kids because I would get laughed at. I still would &#39;myself&#39; at home with my mum, and with my closest friends, but I did try to play certain aspects of it down around my dad and his family... it was still very obvious though, and sometimes I would get negative reactions from them.
</p>
<p>
I grew up in a very small and conservative place, and I remember one jarring experience that sticks in my memory was when I was about 6 or 7, and I was wearing one of my mum&#39;s t-shirts as a dress, probably cinched at the waist with a belt, which is how I always dressed at home. My dad took me up the road to a pub with him, and we were both stared at so disapprovingly because of how I was dressed. It was extremely uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
Experiences like that were not uncommon if I ever let the mask slip... and as I got older, because I inhibited so much of myself for fear of being clocked, I became a shadow of a person, with seemingly no personality, or just a massive nerd more interested in reading book than being anywhere near people. That brought its own problems in terms of negative attention!
</p>
<p>
When I was about 7, my mum asked me if I wanted to be a girl, which, of course I did. However, the images running through my head at that time of what that meant, were quite distressing - trans women were so poorly represented in the media, all I could picture were crossdressers or drag queens, and I knew I definitely wasn&#39;t that! So, unfortunately, I didn&#39;t come out to my mum at that point, and just continued trying to repress. I hoped I would &#39;grow out&#39; of feminine behaviour, and I did things like destroy all my barbies and dolls. Femininity felt like a guilty terrible addiction that I needed to snap out of.
</p>
<p>
Obviously when puberty came, that was extremely distressing, and I did lose my mind for a bit. I couldn&#39;t articulate exactly what I was feeling, but I knew the changes were bad for me, and I just wanted to be &#39;androgynous&#39; or &#39;genderless&#39;, but felt too scared because of previous experiences to present in that way.
</p>
<p>
When I did begin transitioning towards the end of my teenage years, I did not think I would necessarily grow up into a woman. I was very wary of not &#39;passing&#39; and worried about the danger that could bring to me, so I identified as non-binary. I was scared about taking oestrogen because I was worried I would have the same negative reaction to it as to testosterone, and would end up having to do things like binding my boobs to feel comfortable. I did reason however that as an adult, you have to have one sex hormone dominant to be healthy, and I definitely preferred the effects of oestrogen over testosterone, but it was the &#39;better of two evils&#39;.
</p>
<p>
Within three months on oestrogen however I realised it was
<em>
exactly
</em>
what my body wanted. I was self-conscious about growing boobs, but after having them for a little bit, I realised they made me
<em>
more
</em>
comfortable with my body rather than less. I loved all the changes that were coming with being in a oestrogen dominated body over a testosterone one, and I was also being seen as female fairly easily without much effort at this point, and that definitely made life a lot easier in terms of interacting with others, and it felt more natural to me.
</p>
<p>
I still think gender is kinda silly, but I know that being perceived as a &#39;woman&#39; has made me makes sense to a lot of other people who previously would have been very confused by me, but much more than that, a &#39;female&#39; body makes much more instinctive sense to me than a &#39;male&#39; body, and my brain is no longer subconsciously panicking because changes are happening to my body which it doesn&#39;t recognise. In some ways, I would liken the body dysphoria to my brain perceiving the changes that were coming as being indicative of disease - it subconsciously panicked like something was going badly wrong. I do not get that at all under oestrogen. For once, my brain is quiet on that front.

There&#39;s something really therapeutic in reading about all the experiences you and the other people in this thread have made, some of which is weirdly comforting, others triggering lots and lots of dysphoria and envy.
</p>
<p>
Your mum sounds great though. Wish I&#39;d had supportive parents that let me wear dresses at home. I could probably have started thinking about gender so much earlier if I hadn&#39;t been forced to repress all things feminine that I obviously liked so much, in retrospect...  It probably made life easier for me though, growing up as a pretty conventional &#39;boy&#39;.
</p>
<p>
You know, I was always thinking, as a &#39;straight&#39; &#39;cis male&#39;, that of course I wanted my own boobies and a feminine body, cause I was attracted to that kinda thing. Every straight cis dude would, right? Plus the bad media rep you mentioned... there weren&#39;t any cool trans girls to look up to, so I couldn&#39;t be like that.
</p>
<p>
Still, reading your story just keeps bringing me back to the same old question of &#34;what if I had only realized ten years earlier?&#34; I can&#39;t stop beating myself up for missing my golden chance of transitioning in my teens. It feels like I&#39;ve missed a major part of life and I fucked up my face and body by starting on HRT way too late.  I wish I had a pretty face like yours and a petite body instead of this fucking huge, bulky mess of a hull.

Hey! I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve gotten something out of reading about them. I guess as trans people, we are much more likely to have complicated childhoods and experiences, and I know I certainly have enough to fill a book.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry about the dysphoria-inducing. That is really tough, and I think I understand it fairly well as dysphoria rendered me so dysfunctional for the years leading up to transition, and I&#39;ve never fully gotten my life back on track, but I&#39;m getting there.
</p>
<p>
My mum is a complicated one. I don&#39;t have a great relationship with her for several reasons, but certainly not the trans reason. She&#39;s always been very accepting of it - even quite indifferent to that kind of thing. I don&#39;t think she ever saw me as a &#39;son&#39; before in the same way as my brother, and so feels no sense of &#39;loss of a son&#39;. I&#39;m simply just me, but more naturally me.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to the free expression of gender though, I think this isn&#39;t as straight-forward as it seems. I think because I didn&#39;t have gender expectations pushed on me at home as a kid, I probably struggled to realise just how deeply entrenched my trans issues were. I wonder if I was expected to be a &#39;boy&#39;, I wouldn&#39;t have protested so much earlier, and sought treatment so much earlier, and consequently transitioned earlier... thereby avoiding the really destructive adolescence I did have, and being able to fully feminise any other girl without having to try to undo the effects of boy-puberty. Having said that though, trans healthcare for kids was not easily accessible where I lived, and if my mother pushed for it, she probably would have been labelled abusive in the society of 15-20 years ago...
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s a really interesting point about feeling as a &#39;straight cis male&#39; you&#39;d want to have a female body because that&#39;s what you&#39;re attracted to. I think a lot of people seem to realise they are trans because of similar thought patterns, and although my own story feels different having always been seen, and seen myself, as unavoidably &#39;queer&#39; in some way, I think both experiences are valid. Just different paths to the same conclusion.
</p>
<p>
So when it comes to transitioning now, I don&#39;t think transitioning later is ever too late - it&#39;s never too late to be yourself! Everybody responds differently to HRT, but consistent HRT combined with other treatments with very likely grant you the opportunity to have the life that you want. Women really do come in many different shapes, and both HRT and surgeries these days can lead to amazing results!

I&#39;d like to chip in here. I can recall that when I was at school there was once an HTBQ education. They showed a film. I forgot the name. But it was about some crossdressers or drag queens travelling and performing in Africa, if I remember correctly. Apparently the organiser and the student thought those were how transsexual people were. I thought, No! But anyway, I didn&#39;t bother to argue with anyone. I just took it as some unserious fluff.
</p>
<p>
As to your mum, I did suspect that your relationship wasn&#39;t that great. But again, I didn&#39;t think it was proper for me to speculate. But now you mentioned it yourself. So, I guess it&#39;s no longer that improper for me to comment on it. Why did I suspect so? Because if you trusted your mum, you would have told her that you wanted to be girl. You didn&#39;t tell her because you didn&#39;t feel emotionally safe enough to do it. I often wonder how it would be like, if parents could provide enough emotional safety and practical guidance to their trans kids. I guess those kids would have an easier growing-up. They would receive enough acceptance, care and guidance from their parents, so that the negative influence from other people would not be that profound and traumatising. It would simply be some unserious fluff.

Ouch! That film sounds really interesting in itself, but I would have found watching it hugely depressing if it was supposed to be a portrayal of trans people!
</p>
<p>
When it comes to my relationship with my mum, I would say that it only began to properly disintegrate when I starte boy-puberty, and that was because I was so mentally unwell for a while, it put a lot of strain on our relationship and family. By the time I was 15, she couldn&#39;t take it much more, and detached from me. She stopped being a mother in any significant way, and I then ran away from home at 17 to France for a year, and then to London where I began transition. We&#39;ve never really been able to rebuild our relationship since then, but she was with me for my last week in Thailand when I had the surgery, so she is supportive and does try to be there.
</p>
<p>
When I was a kid, I didn&#39;t think transitioning was possible in the way I have transitioned now, and because of that, I think that was the reason why I didn&#39;t tell her. I just thought it was embarrassing because it was impossible. If I had trans role-models back then, I probably would have transitioned as a kid, and would have had no problem sharing that with my mum back then.

I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to invalidate your struggles üòñ I definitely didn&#39;t put that well.  I shouldn&#39;t just have idealized your (physical) outcomes without seeing the pain it took to get there (and the consequences you&#39;re apparently still suffering from).  From what I can tell it seems you had it much harder than me growing up and I&#39;m sad to read about those horrible experiences üòû
</p>
<p>
Drawing conclusions about your mum from just one mention wasn&#39;t a great move either - it&#39;s cool that she doesn&#39;t mind you being trans, but of course people aren&#39;t one-dimensional like that.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately (? in this instance at least) I often focus exclusively on the good things in others and the bad things in myself, so that makes for a very uneven comparison at times. And the comparison itself is problematic - I shouldn&#39;t weigh my current dysphoria against your past struggles, that&#39;s plain unfair.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s just a lot of internalized trans hatred that makes it hard not to see myself as inferior to cis girls and as not feminine enough.  And then there are people like you who are so far ahead of me - at a place, in fact, that I fear I&#39;ll never reach, because I&#39;m too late - who look the way I wish I could and apparently have a feminine voice (as you said somewhere earlier)...  It gets my mind into a weird place. There&#39;s self-hatred, jealousy and fear of spending the rest of my life with a face / body I can&#39;t live with, but on the other hand there&#39;s so much thankfulness for the time and effort you put into helping all of us get to a better place and you instilled in me some unknown hope that it&#39;s actually possible!

You absolutely did not come across as invalidating my struggles - I&#39;m sorry if I gave the impression that I thought you did!
</p>
<p>
I have been quite fortunate in transition, and I&#39;m aware of that. I also tend to focus on the bad things in myself, and particularly in the early days of transition when I held myself up to standards that were both really hard to meet, but also not that important after all anyway - as transition went on, a lot of my hang-ups did seem to melt-away, but in ways I didn&#39;t expect.
</p>
<p>
I really get the internalised transphobia thing because I was a lot like that too at the beginning of transition. I also looked up to girls back then who had been transitioning for several years (like me now), and thought I would never reach that stage, and just felt despairing and full of self-hatred, and self-disgust.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to all aspects of transition, from voice, to hormones, to surgery, there is so much that can be done, and it can be taken so far! I promise that it is not as overwhelming a process as it at first appears. You just take it one day at a time, and have HRT and surgery goals. In the process of chasing those, everything kind of just falls into place the more you go on. If you&#39;re not on HRT now, that is definitely the first step.

You are giving me so much hope! Your results seem amazing and it‚Äôs awesome to know that‚Äôs possible, not just in terms of looks but in terms of function.
</p>
<p>
Would you mind telling us about what the distance between your vagina and anus is (how long is your perineum)? And how is doggy-style sex?
</p>
<p>
The view from behind ‚Äì such as standing and bending over, or on hands and knees ‚Äì is very important to me, as is doggy-style. I‚Äôve only ever seen one pic of a neo-vagina from behind, and the distance was much more than what you‚Äôd see on a cis women. I know you said you‚Äôd have to consider sharing more pics when people asked you here, so if you do decide to, I hope you take that view in to consideration.

That&#39;s really lovely of you to say...
</p>
<p>
Onto the questions themselves, those are super interesting and quite specific haha!
</p>
<p>
So I would say that my perineum is probably on the shorter side of things compared to cis women, maybe being just less than an inch. I imagine the length would be increased if I had the posterior commissure revision surgery, but I wouldn&#39;t say it looks abnormal as it is.
</p>
<p>
Doggy-style sex is amazing because it feels very intense, and seems to hit the right places. However, when I first started having PIV sex, the intensity was actually &#39;too much&#39; and I had to stop and change positions. It is mind-blowing, but for me at least, I think I needed to warm up to it. I haven&#39;t really done it for a long time, but I imagine that if I did it now with an average-sized partner, after being quite used to PIV, it would be really great. If I had a partner who was really well-endowed, it might still be a bit too intense, but in the middle of sex, that intensity tends to translate to high-levels of pleasure anyway.
</p>
<p>
In regards to how it looks from behind, I would say that&#39;s probably one of the best-angles... it looks very much like any other vagina. I&#39;ve just checked to see if I have pictures of that specifically, but I don&#39;t, I think because bending over in that way kinda makes me feel dysphoric for certain reasons... however, I will endeavour to take pictures like that into the future if it&#39;s in public interest üôÉ  In the meantime, you&#39;re just going to have to take my word for it that it looks great from behind, and I think that&#39;s common for Suporn results as any potential differences between his vaginas and cis vaginas are going to be obscured by labia at that angle.

Oh my glob all of that just sounds waaaay too exciting! I wish I could experience that feeling of fullness you described in another response and the intensity of doggy-style. I don&#39;t even think I&#39;m into guys as of yet, but all of the amazing things you write just make me wanna jump straight into it! üòç Guess I should do some more research though üòû
</p>
<p>
Oh btw, how long was the wait list for the Suporn clinic? Should I start getting into contact with them if I hope to have my GAS within the next two years?

Well you certainly don&#39;t need to be into guys to experience doggy! The most intense experience I had with it was with another girl who was strapping me.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2016 when I booked, Suporn was in pretty high-demand, so I think the waiting list was about 1.5 years - 2 years generally, but there were odd dates sooner where there had been cancellations.
</p>
<p>
Suporn is in the process of retiring now though, and I&#39;m not sure if he is taking on more SRS dates. However, he has trained a few new surgeons over the past few years, and the main new surgeon, Dr Bank, provides really excellent results - just as good, if not better than Suporn, and he is cheaper.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure how in-demand Dr Bank is at the moment, though I imagine with the ongoing pandemic, a lot of surgery dates did need to be pushed back. However, I&#39;m not sure.
</p>
<p>
If you were interested in having this surgery at the Suporn clinic within the next two years, I&#39;d get in contact now üôÉ
</p>
<p>
edit: I&#39;ve just looked at the online &#39;calendar&#39; of surgery dates, and actually, there is availability throughout this year - I guess because of covid

Ooh, thought of another one. Have you tried many toys/vibes, and what&#39;s your favorite? Have you used a Magic Wand, Sybian, or those air-suction clit stimulators? (I&#39;m particularly curious how that last one works for you, they seem
<em>
really

cool and I wonder how they work with a Suporn-type neoclitoris.)

Hulloooo.
</p>
<p>
So I haven&#39;t tried that many, but vaginal penetration feels great, so I like good quality dildos. I also do have a magic-want (a doxxy), and that feels great. It will bring me to a powerful orgasm pretty quickly. I have used other less powerful vibrators, and they were sometimes good, but I&#39;m not looking back after getting a doxxy.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen the air-suction clit stimulators, and they seem pretty intriguing. I&#39;ve not been motivated to buy one for myself (mainly because I don&#39;t masturbate very often), but maybe I&#39;ll put it on a Wishlist. A sex toy review blog from a post-op trans woman would be a cool idea, and I might take that on!

Ooooh, you got a Doxy! üò≥ I&#39;ve been lusting after a Doxy Die Cast myself for a while now, but that is definitely outside my price range. I&#39;m stuck using my (increasingly noisy) Magic Wand for now!

I would

Haha! Well I&#39;m glad for confirmation of that interest. It seems like a pretty cool idea.

<p>
The doxxxy is incredible... So powerful! I&#39;d certainly recommend it. Sometimes I&#39;ve used it during PIV sex, and my boyfriend can feel the vibrations through me, which feels amazing to him too. üôÉ

Ooooh this is a really interesting question!
</p>
<p>
The short answer is no. I&#39;m a bisexual woman, and was both before and after surgery.
</p>
<p>
The long answer is.... it&#39;s a little more complicated.
</p>
<p>
So as a kid and young teenager, I felt mainly sexually attracted to males, and more romantically attracted to females. Because I was so feminine, I found it very hard to take myself seriously as a &#39;boy interested in girls&#39;, and the idea of having/pursuing sex with women was really distressing, probably because I couldn&#39;t imagine myself as being attractive to them as I was so feminine, but also because the idea of being seen as a &#39;straight guy&#39; was so incredibly dysphorising. At one point, my romantic attraction to men increased a lot, and because of all that, I came out as &#39;gay&#39; when I was 13, but within a couple of years, I had had sex with both men and women as a boy, and found &#39;gay male sex&#39; really unpleasant. It made me so dysphoric before I had the words to describe that. Sex with women was better in those terms, but I still felt dysphoric and confused by it.
</p>
<p>
When I started transitioning, I did so from a non-binary perspective at first, and because I was a &#39;fuck gender&#39; kind of person, I identified as pansexual. I had sex with men and women, but didn&#39;t like either really at all, and having sex with cis women once I started transitioning was actually pretty distressing to me because I felt so inferior to both their &#39;cisness&#39; and because they had vaginas and I didn&#39;t. I had a really intense emotional reaction to vaginas generally, and avoided getting with cis women.
</p>
<p>
Before surgery, the only sex that felt anything like &#39;ok&#39; to me, was the sex I had with my (now ex) girlfriend, who was also trans, very feminine, and exquisitely beautiful. Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t have much sex - we had very different sex drives, with hers being almost non-existent, and we both had hang-ups about sex and our body&#39;s due to trans experience. Sadly, we just couldn&#39;t get over those issues together, and it contributed a lot to the breaking-up of our 5 year relationship (we had pretty much transitioned together, hand-in-hand).
</p>
<p>
I have had sex with cis-female lesbians after surgery, and that sex makes sense to me because those women are into me, and see me entirely as a woman - whereas before surgery, I didn&#39;t really have sex with women, and the ones I did sleep with were bi or straight, which was quite dysphorising as they were not viewing me as a whole woman before surgery, even with HRT.
</p>
<p>
Even though sex with women now makes sense to me, I find I&#39;m not quite as &#39;into&#39; it as I am with male partners. But, this could just be my lack of experience in that area. I&#39;ve probably not had enough sex with women to know what I like, but I&#39;m also kind of scared of women üòÖ I think this is quite common in a lot of bisexual girls for a lot of reasons, let alone trans bisexual girls who can bring a whole other set of issues to the table.
</p>
<p>
I have had sex with two cis-males post surgery both within the past year, and with one of them, I have had more sex with by far than anybody else in my life (and the most sex I have ever had has been within the past year, by far). I really enjoy sex with him/men, and it does feel like my &#39;default&#39;. I currently feel both more romantically and sexually inclined to men, but I think that is more due complicated feelings around women or my own internalised homophobia rather than a natural inclination towards men.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve not had the opportunity to be with other trans people except my girlfriend after surgery, and while I am completely open to it with the right person, I am wary that maybe shared trauma over sex and gender might be a bad mix.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a bit ironic, but I realise I am a slightly biphobic bisexual; I only feel comfortable being with &#39;very gay&#39; women, or &#39;very straight&#39; men at the moment. This is obviously because I don&#39;t want to feel like they are attracted to me because they see me as a boy in anyway, but it is ultimately silly and something I need to get over. We&#39;re all works in progress, and when you&#39;re trans, I guess you&#39;re more susceptible than most to having little hang-ups like that!

You mention your ex-gf a lot and on your Instagram there are still photos of you together. So I think you care a lot about her. I guess breaking-up with her after 5 years could be emotionally tough for you, isn&#39;t it?
</p>
<p>
Indeed, shared trauma could bring people together. But they often don&#39;t know how to heal themselves, let alone how to heal each other. They are also often too afraid to break up the group to face the outside world. So, they&#39;ll likely stay together and perpetuate each other&#39;s trauma. So it goes, forming a vicious cycle. In this sense, I think breaking-up with your ex-gf is a right thing for both of you. You both need to find some people who can heal you.

Haha! I did not realise my personal instagram was linked to this reddit account! I don&#39;t mind though - I&#39;ve actually just put it in my bio in case it was of interest to people. How did you find it?
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s a really sweet message. Of course I love her very much and I can&#39;t help but feel bound to her. How can you go through something as big as transition together, and not feel bound? It&#39;s like growing up together, and even though I didn&#39;t feel like we were much like &#39;girlfriends&#39; when together, we did feel like sisters, and I still view her like that. It wasn&#39;t an acrimonious break-up from my end, but unfortunately it was for her, and I made a lot of mistakes towards the end.
</p>
<p>
You are absolutely right about shared trauma, and perpetrating trauma. It is very tough. We were right for each other while we were transitioning, but after transitioning, I think we just held each other back and stopped the other moving on in life. I think we both need different people to help us heal now.

I understand. As you say, when two people are both traumatised, they are more likely to hold each other back than help each other out. But probably there is a delay for one to realise it. Just like only after you started transitioning did you realise how dysphoric you were before transitioning. I guess only after you broke up with her did you realise that the relationship wasn&#39;t all that great. So, both of you need to keep going, to find the happiness you both want and deserve. Probably either of you, or both of you won&#39;t heal. Or probably both of you can heal. Of course you can get back together if both of you or at least one of you have healed. But then that would be a new relationship :)

Although I doubt we will end-up back together (certainly not soon, and I&#39;m with somebody else anyway), I do hope we will be able to reconcile.
</p>
<p>
I hope most of all though that she finds happiness and healing for herself!

Dr Suporn - my surgeon way back in 2004!   I thought that he had retired, presumably that was after you had surgery - in 2018?

Was Kie Lertsubin still there as Patient Coordinator?  A wonderful person, I can&#39;t speak too highly of her.

I have a couple of questions about your SRS and how you are now: How has your recovery been so far? Do you recommend Dr. Suporn? How do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth currently? How was the dilation process during the recovery? And how is the dilatation process currently? Are you planning to have revision surgery? And if you have not undergone one, what would improve your result with one? And if you have already undergone one, how do you think your result improved? How was your stay in Thailand (Chon Buri)? What was the aftercare like for Dr. Suporn and the clinic staff in general? And by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.
</p>
<p>
And I would like to ask for some photos in various angles of your SRS result, (only if you feel comfortable doing it, I don&#39;t want you to feel uncomfortable), I do it for informational purposes only, in fact from the image you shared you have a very good result (of the best I have seen, I would like to have a similar result to yours), I just have not seen many results from Dr. Suporn completely healed, and it is to see how is the aesthetics of the vulva created with the technique of Dr. Suporn when fully healed (and see what I can hope to have)

Hey!
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm so happy to answer these questions, and am actually in the process of making some videos on the whole experience so these questions are super useful.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
How has recovery been so far?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Well, I had surgery on 14th February 2018, so it‚Äôs been over 3 years now. The month in Chonburi was a bit intense, with the week in hospital just lying in bed being quite hard on a couple of fronts. I also needed a catheter put in just before I left hospital. This was because although I was able to pee immediately after packing came out, I swelled up very quickly, which led to an excruciating scenario where I had a massively full bladder after drinking litres of water, and trapped urine. Dr Suporn was called in as an emergency matter to put the catheter in... that was probably the most painful experience of the whole thing for me.
</p>
<p>
I took tramadol to deal with the pain in Chonburi, but after a month or two post-op, a lot of the pain wore off, and it was mainly a feeling of numbness.
</p>
<p>
Dilation was difficult for the first year, and especially in the period of 4-9 months post-op for me. It took a hugely long time to reach depth, and I had to cut it down to twice a day rather than the recommended 3 times a day early after surgery (and maintain twice a day even past 6 months when you are technically allowed to reduce it to once a day). The difficulty with dilation seemed to peak for me at about 6 months, which lead to me trying to come up with all manner of ways to dilate easier and quicker, including using things like inflatable dildos. It was a nightmare! But, after about a year, it didn‚Äôt really become an issue in life, and after 18 months, dilation became easy, and I rarely had to dilate to maintain depth... I don‚Äôt dilate for many months at a time now and still maintain depth, but I do have regular penetrative sex.
</p>
<p>
I had revision surgery about 18 months after the initial surgery, just to reduce the size of my labia a bit and neaten things. Recovery for that wasn‚Äôt very involved at all, and it was done under local anaesthetic. I would say I was perfectly fine by a month after, and the only noticeable unpleasant effect was discomfort in wearing tight jeans for a short bit.
</p>
<p>
These days, 3 years after surgery and 18 months after a minor revision, I am ‚Äòfully recovered‚Äô and have been for the past 18 months or so at least. It‚Äôs not an overnight thing where one day your life is dominated by recovery, and the next day everything is fine. It is so gradual, it‚Äôs hard to know exactly what you are better. All I can say is I didn‚Äôt have any pain a few months after the surgery except in dilation, dilation was no longer a pain after about 9 months - a year after surgery, and I rarely dilate at all now (maybe once every few months just to check in). I have fairly consistent penetrative sex, and although that is not considered a replacement for dilation, it seems to suffice for me, but maybe that‚Äôs just because it has been a couple of years since surgery.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Do you recommend Suporn?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I believe he is retiring, but I absolutely recommend him and his clinic, including the new surgeon Dr Bank. Dr Bank‚Äôs results seem to equal if not exceed Dr Suporn‚Äôs.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
How do you consider the results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I‚Äôm pretty happy with things cosmetically, but there will always be a few things I‚Äôd like to change if I had the money to go back for a further revision. These small changes I would make would have no effect on my sexual functioning and wouldn‚Äôt really be noticeable to an observer - they would just be for me.
</p>
<p>
In terms of sensitivity, I am fairly sensitive. Orgasms are better than before for me, and about as easy/hard to achieve (I don‚Äôt orgasm easily, but find it easier and easier since finding an experienced sexual partner who knows how to satisfy me).
</p>
<p>
Clitoral stimulation is really nice, and I can cum from it, but my most powerful and easier-to-reach orgasms come from vaginal penetration, which, at the right angles, is mind-blowing. It feels incredible.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What is your vaginas depth currently?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I didn‚Äôt get much vaginal depth in terms of Suporn‚Äôs usual work... getting just 6 inches after surgery. I guess this could be down to not being a particularly tall woman, and having quite a small frame. Either way, I was surprised because I did expect more.
</p>
<p>
With the reduction in post-surgery swelling, and some filtration difficulties a few months after surgery, I seemed to have lost half an inch or so. So I‚Äôm about 5.5 inches.
</p>
<p>
One interesting aspect about this is that I can quite easily accommodate average sized penises in sex, but, I find my depth of accommodation may reduce slightly if somebody is thicker. Either way, it is enough to have great PIV sex for both parties.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
How was dilation process during recovery and currently?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Well, see above! It was ok for the first 3-4 months, though took up a lot of time and had to be done 3 times a day. It became its hardest, most frustrating, and most painful at about 4-9 months after surgery for me - peaking especially about 6 months, when generally is is supposed to get easier. I think I may have been an odd case.
</p>
<p>
Either way, by a year after surgery, I was only needing to do it a couple of times a week, and it was relatively easy compared, and didn‚Äôt take too long.
</p>
<p>
These days I don‚Äôt really dilate apart from every few months, but, I do have consistent penetrative sex with my cis-male partner.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Are you planning on having revision surgery, have you had one, if so what do you think of the results?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I have already had a small cosmetic revision to reduce the size of my labia, and neaten the area around the clit (anterior commissure). I would have a further revision to perhaps define better the posterior commissure, but really, it already exists somewhat and that revision is fraught with risk which may not be worth the cost or recovery for something small only I would notice and care about.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
How was your stay in Thailand?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thailand was great. Chonburi itself is not an interesting place, but I didn‚Äôt go there to be a tourist.
</p>
<p>
The hospital was incredible, more modern and cleaner than most hospitals I have been to in the U.K., and the care both within the hospital and outside was exemplary. It really is first class care!
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What was aftercare like?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The aftercare post-hospital was very extensive. You are visited everyday by clinic assistants who check on you, and you are examined by Suporn a couple of times a week. You are given classes in dilation, and everybody is really lovely, professional, and also approachable.
</p>
<p>
Within the hospital itself, one of Suporn‚Äôs assistants sleeps in the same room as you the night after the surgery, and the nurses are all so lovely from my hazy memory. I remember being so touched by the care I received by one of the nurses that I went back to the hospital shortly before I left to give her presents from my home country. She‚Äôs still a friend on Facebook to this day
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Photos?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In regards to more photos, I‚Äôll have a think about it. Nude shoots like this are one way I like to express my creativity and embrace my body, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be creating different images as time goes on anyway, in addition to the many I already have on my profile and in my links üôÉ

Hey, just to say, I was sent a link to Suporn&#39;s paper which was published in 2019.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not supposed to be shared publicly, but as the results have been taken down from his website, I feel like it&#39;s in public interest.
</p>
<p>
If you can deal with graphic pictures of surgery, and description of the technique, there are also a bunch of typical results you can respect from the surgery within the document here:

He is in Chonburi, which is a small nondescript town about an hour drive outside of Bangkok, in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
He was just as expensive as western surgeons when taking travel etc. into account, but the standard of healthcare there, as well as the aftercare, was incredible

At the time, I remember it was at least ¬£15,000 ($21,000), plus flights, and a hotel for a month (and then also flights and a hotel for a free revision 18 months later)
</p>
<p>
The surgeon has retired now though, but his clinic is still operating with surgeons who get the same, if not better, results. I believe they are also significantly cheaper as they have been doing it for only a few years compared to Suporn&#39;s 20 years+

Hey,
</p>
<p>
So you and I are on the opposite ends of the spectrum here, because I don&#39;t generally like getting myself off, and much prefer sex with other people!
</p>
<p>
However, I can say that absolutely you can orgasm from masturbation, and ways to get there is a matter of personal preference.
</p>
<p>
I think clitoral stimulation is necessary to cum when masturbating for most women - I&#39;ve never cum for example from just penetration with toys when masturbating, but with PIV sex, I have (but rarely). I imagine it probably could happen easily with a vibrating dildo (through indirect clit stimulation), but as I&#39;m not so into masturbation, I haven&#39;t tried it.
</p>
<p>
So for me, clitoral stimulation is gonna be the thing that makes me cum when masturbating (and vibrators on the outside will definitely help get there much quicker), but if I want a more intense orgasm, or just get there quicker, I would try some penetration at the same time. A dildo and a magic wand will make me cum very quickly, and very intensely, for example, but it&#39;s very hard to do those together on yourself! For me at least, it always helps to have someone else around!

Hey, so my surgery was actually a really good deal as far as private SRS surgeons seem to go. It was between ¬£15,000-¬£18,000 (I can&#39;t remember exactly), so that equals $21,000 - $25,000 USD. I would say it was on the cheaper end of this, but on top of that surgery cost, I also had to pay for flights and hotel for a month.
</p>
<p>
I had to pay for flights and a hotel for 2 weeks as well when I returned for revision 18 months later, but the revision was only minor and cosmetic, and was totally free as it&#39;s clinic policy to offer a free revision if you want it. üòä

Hi There! I know that you&#39;re probably inundated with other comments, but I was wondering if you&#39;d be willing to discuss why you went with Suporn over getting surgery in the US? (assuming, of course, that you live in the US) Was it entirely an issue of results / aesthetics relative to the progress and state of the US surgery &#39;market&#39; over Suporn&#39;s results?
</p>
<p>
If so - how on earth did you afford it (keeping in mind absolutely need not feel any requirement to answer that last question, but it&#39;s the reason I&#39;m not hopping on a plane to get Suporn&#39;s procedure myself).

<p>
Hey! I&#39;m absolutely happy to answer everything, but it may just take me a little while with all the other comments!
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m not actually from the U.S; I&#39;m British, though not originally from the U.K., but I was living there during my transition, and I was logged with their National Health Service for gender affirmation treatment, even though I began my transition initially with a private service. So in the U.K. you can transition entirely free, that means HRT and SRS - and the state foots the bill. It&#39;s been like that for at least half a century.
</p>
<p>
However, the NHS is suffering both from a conservative government which underfunds it because it disagrees with it ideologically and wants reasons to privatise it, and requests for gender affirmation treatments have gone up hundreds fold within the past half a decade (around when I began transitioning). This means that if I wanted the free treatment with the NHS, I would have had to wait quite a few years, although, I discovered, with Suporn&#39;s waiting list when I booked with him in 2016, probably not much longer than if I had stuck with the NHS.
</p>
<p>
While HRT is HRT, SRS is a bit more of an art, and I found the British-state-funded SRS leaving quite a lot to be desired. From the few results I had been able to see, aesthetically they seemed sub-par compared to Suporn&#39;s, furthermore, I had a couple of friends who had surgery with the NHS, but each of them had complications which required further surgery. I may just have known some unfortunate people though!
</p>
<p>
I always expected that I would be going abroad for surgery, and I of course looked at North-American surgeons - Dr Brassard in Canada actually was my second choice, and again, this was based on the aesthetic results I found online which seemed generally superior to U.S. surgeons - but I was looking at this stuff in the first part of the last decade, so I expect things have changed since then. I see a lot of new names for SRS surgery in the U.S. these days.
</p>
<p>
However, I still wasn&#39;t a fan of the penile-inversion technique. What I liked about Suporn was that he had developed his own technique, which seemed to yield far superior aesthetic and functional results than the other surgeons I had seen elsewhere in the world. I suspect this may be slightly different now with newer techniques like peritoneal-pull-through, which seems really promising.

In regards to being able to afford it, I was still a teenager when I began transitioning, and that was mainly off my own back. I ran away to the U.K. to transition with some money I had saved from a job in financial services, and I used that money to see a private gender therapist who first prescribed me HRT. A year later, while into transition, I tried university, but really couldn&#39;t afford it or concentrate on it while concentrating on my transition.
</p>
<p>
This left me in a new country without a support network, with shaky mental health over the despair of ever being able to transition quickly and be able to just get on with the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
I hate to be a stereotype, but like a lot of young trans women, I did turn to sex work and save that money. This was an okay job for me as it was mainly virtual cam girl stuff, and I was able to work on my own time, while keeping up school-projects. There are a lot of people out there who will pay a lot of money for a feminine girl with dick to talk dirty to them and put on a show... That obviously came with a lot of risk though, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to anybody except the very few who it may suit. Unfortunately I was a little naive and used the wrong site at one point, which wasn&#39;t very private, and resultantly still occasionally find content of myself from several years ago that was recorded and placed online for other peoples&#39; profit. It&#39;s quite irritating.

Thank you so much for taking the time to write up your response! I greatly appreciate the detail of what you had to say. As far as getting surgeries through state-funded programs, I can understand the hesitance! I&#39;m considering Dr Purohit here in NYC because of his good urological track record and recent interest in doing tunica vaginalis ppt procedures, but I&#39;m very interested in the aesthetics of your vagina - so it&#39;s giving me pause. I so appreciate your insight!
</p>
<p>
It does seem as though there are a number of people who had to take the financial route that you did - I suppose that the great advantage of your being able to do so, however, is that you were fully able to pick your own path with respect to results. So, again, I greatly appreciate your response - I find nothing wrong with sex work and while I&#39;m sorry that you had some issues with IP - I&#39;m glad that it worked out for this result. You clearly worked toward your goal, and I&#39;m proud of you for it, :]

Thanks so much! ü•∞ I hope it all goes well and works out for you. If you want any more information about Suporn clinic stuff, I&#39;ll always be more than happy to help where I can.
</p>
<p>
I think I should also state that I absolutely do not have any problems with sex work either. Some of my closest friends (cis and trans) are sex workers or have been, and sex workers are often some of the most intelligent and creative people I know. I think it can be a good fit for certain people - particularly when they are privileged enough to be able to &#39;choose&#39; the way they do it. I actually think that I am one of the few people for whom it has been a good fit, generally, and it can certainly be enjoyable and interesting compared to the run-of-the-mill office job!

Hey,
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m not on injections as they are not generally available outside the US/in Europe as far as I know. I would
<em>
love
</em>
to be on injections because it seems so much more straight forward. I don&#39;t like having to remember to take E everyday. It kind of makes me dysphoric because it is one of the few reminders now that I am actually trans.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been taking gel pretty much the entire time. I use a brand called Sandrena. I started on 2mg, but found 3mg is where I feel my best... vibrant and energetic, even though it does lead to quite high E readings compared to cis women. I did try pills for a short while after SRS, thinking it would be more simple than rubbing gel on my thighs everyday, but I didn&#39;t like them at all! I can&#39;t explain exactly why, but I felt like my feminisation almost decreased. My boobs felt smaller, I became skinnier, and my mood was lower. When I went back on gel, I felt more vibrant again.
</p>
<p>
I would say that my boobs started developing very noticeably after 1-3 months. They continued to grow slowly, kind of reaching a peak maybe 2-3 years after beginning oestrogen. I was never on blockers though, and at least shortly before surgery, my T levels went slightly above cis female range, and I partially-regained my fertility for a very brief moment - so this may have affected them.
</p>
<p>
I managed to get an injection of a GnRH antagonist kind of blocker just before surgery, because I have heard that T levels can ironically shoot up after SRS for a bit.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also heard that feminisation, including boob growth, can increase quite a lot after SRS, but I can&#39;t say I noticed that specifically. I was on oestrogen for just under 3 years before I had SRS, and I&#39;ll have been &#39;hormonally female&#39; for 6 years as of May this year; I feel like any residual feminising effects would have happened anyway, regardless of surgery. Having said that though, I think if I was able to have more consistent levels of E that you get with injections, rather than the spikes and drops you get with gel, maybe I would feminise further. I think it also takes at least seven years for the entire body to &#39;regenerate&#39; right? So maybe I&#39;ll keep femininsing until after 7 years on E, or after 7 years post-SRS - I guess we&#39;ll find out in 2025!
</p>
<p>
I began taking 200mg micronised progesterone around the time I had SRS, and I noticed it made my boobs feel &#39;firmer&#39;, but didn&#39;t necessarily increase the development or size of them (and it had no effect on my already developed nipples). I used to take this orally, but after watching a presentation by Dr Powers  (
<a href="/r/DrWillPowers" rel="nofollow">r/DrWillPowers
</a>
), I recently started taking these as pessaries within the past week. I&#39;ll try to monitor any effects!
</p>
<p>
My boobs are quite small, but relatively proportionate to my figure, as I&#39;m also very slim. I think when I put on weight, it tends to go to my boobs and my butt. I imagine if I didn&#39;t struggle putting weight on, my boobs would be naturally a C cup (and I think they were a few months ago when I weighed a bit more!).

Hey! Yes I expect it probably was because of the contraction period - usually however that happens earlier in the process, and tends to be over by 6 months. For whatever reason, my dilation because most difficult between 6-9 months, but then quickly reduced in difficulty after that point.

Hey, so regarding the different surgery types, I can only really comment on my own experience which would be the non-PI technique that Dr Bank would use. I&#39;m super happy with it, I&#39;m functional, sensate, and aesthetically I think the result is pretty good - and I hear it tends to be even better with Dr Bank.
</p>
<p>
However, if I were to get SRS these days, rather than a few years ago, I probably would be most interested in the peritoneal surgeries, and would research in that direction to see if the surgery was appropriate to me, and if they results matched those of the Suporn clinic. Having said that, I don&#39;t think there is much of a functional and material difference between my vagina, and vaginas that are constructed from peritoneal tissue, other than perhaps more self-lubrication in the latter which would allow the vagina to be even more self-cleaning I guess. I think dilation is also less when recovering, and that is a big plus.
</p>
<p>
Further to this however, I think aesthetics were very important to me, and I trusted the Suporn clinic more than any others to deliver a good result there. As I mentioned above, if I was extremely wealthy, I would consider getting a peritoneal &#39;extension&#39; to my vagina now if that were at all possible, but it feels like a very expensive luxury that I don&#39;t really need, but, a couple more inches of depth and more lubrication is always good!

I‚Äôm not sure how relevant this is because penile skin is mainly just used for the outside labia - it‚Äôs skin taken from the scrotum which is excised, treated, and used to form the main part of the vaginal canal.
</p>
<p>
So I was 7-8 inches before surgery... I can‚Äôt remember exactly, probably on the larger end of that, maybe it went down a bit with E more towards 7. So I had a lot of material, but as I said, that was mainly used on the outside. I had quite puffy labia after primary surgery, which in part prompted me to go back for revision surgery 18 months later.
</p>
<p>
So, even with this greater amount of material, I got relatively little depth compared to other Suporn patients, with just over 6 inches after surgery (I think most get more towards 7). That‚Äôs probably because I had less skin available from where he actually takes the graft.
</p>
<p>
With healing and some dilation issues, that depth went down to 5.5 inches, but I don‚Äôt find that it affects sexual functioning at all.

I think you mentioned you have a bit smaller frame, right? I seem to recall reading somewhere that as long as you have adequate source tissue, your height and especially your internal anatomy will decide the limit of your depth more than anything else. This is true of cis women too; on average, shorter women have smaller vaginas.
</p>
<p>
So when you mention you had puffy labia after your primary surgery, is that the outer labia? I&#39;ve heard Dr. Suporn leaves quite a lot of erectile tissue (from the penile bulb I think?) inside the outer labia, which some girls like but many others prefer to get reduced. Not sure which camp I&#39;m in yet, I&#39;d have to see my own results to decide. Like you, I&#39;m certainly not lacking in source tissue.
</p>
<p>
Other than your clitoral hood, did you have any other revision work done in your inner labia? They project out beyond your outer labia quite a bit, which is 100% the aesthetic I&#39;m going for, and I&#39;m wondering if you had to have them either reduced to reshaped at all.

Lol the words ‚Äòpenile bulb‚Äô together make me want to heave.
</p>
<p>
Yeah I‚Äôm not that short at 5ft 8, but I generally have little bones and I‚Äôm obviously pretty skinny haha
</p>
<p>
My puffy labia was actually the inner labia. There was more of it before revision, and it was more ‚Äòbutterfly‚Äô shape. I‚Äôve never noticed any sensation that would be indicative of erectile tissue behind the outer labia really, but the whole area between the clit and vagina, and so generally under and around the inner labia, does feel like it swells somewhat during arousal, but not in anyway that is uncomfortable or feels unnatural - in terms of appearance, it just makes my labia and clit very subtly swollen in sex.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the clitoral hood defining, I had some reduction in the size of my inner labia, and I just remember I also had a little reduction in some tissue around the urethra which was very slightly protruding by a few millimetres... I guess that was erectile tissue, or due to erectile tissue ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Ohhh, I see! I wonder what people are actually referring to then, when they say they had excess erectile tissue removed? That&#39;ll be a question I&#39;ll have to ask Dr. Bank. I do know that getting excess tissue removed from around the urethra is a very common revision, since, as I understand it, Dr. Suporn can only remove so much in the primary surgery before you run a much greater risk of the urethra swelling shut after the catheter is removed. (And even then it can still happen, as you unfortunately found out!) üò£
</p>
<p>
Though I will say, if that&#39;s the worst complication I have following my own surgery, I will count myself a very lucky girl!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and that&#39;s sooo cool about how your labia get just slightly swollen during arousal, since that&#39;s pretty much
<em>
exactly
</em>
what cis labia do too!
</p>
<p>
(Heh. I try my best to use as clinical terms as possible so as to avoid triggering all our dysphoria. Yuck. Kind of unavoidable when we start getting into the nitty gritty of it I suppose.)

Haha thanks. It still feels weird to be congratulated on something which has just been my everyday life for the past 3 years and never gets a second-thought now, except in this kinda context, but I‚Äôll take it! üíú

<p>
Hey! Sorry for the late response‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
So healing time is a difficult question to answer because it reduces very slowly and there are numerous aspects to it.
</p>
<p>
The first three months are quite sore, as expected, and pain is more discomfort and odd numbness rather than torturous‚Ä¶ dilation however became a lot harder and painful for me 5-9 months post, which also meant I had to do it a lot more - the rule is that if it hard and painful, you generally need to do it more rather than less. This is because the body is aggressively forming scar tissue which could shrink your vagina, so, just as aggressively, you need to dilate to ensure that scar tissue is broken down as it forms.
</p>
<p>
After about 9 months, it calmed down, but I was still careful to be dilating everyday after this point, until over a year had passed (and dilation was still difficult for me after a year)
</p>
<p>
Almost at 1 year exactly, discharge stopped‚Ä¶ it had been an issue for the whole year post-op. I had to wear pads all the time, and the discharge did not smell pleasant, which led to some embarrassing moments. It was actually quite grim. Thankfully, it pretty much stopped overnight one year post.
</p>
<p>
I seemed to lose half an inch of depth because I took one day off 6 months post surgery for my birthday during the intense healing/scar contraction period‚Ä¶ this meant that for a whole year after I kept up with daily rigorous dilation to try to get my depth back, without success (at least at that point, with dilation‚Ä¶ will expand below)
</p>
<p>
After 18 months, I had a minor cosmetic revision (little reduction of labia minora), which meant I wasn‚Äôt able to dilate for 3 weeks. I didn‚Äôt experience any substantial loss in depth at this point, and so my dilations reduced to about once every 3-4 weeks without loss of depth.
</p>
<p>
Once I started having regular penetrative sex 2 years post-op, I stopped dilating altogether, except checking in once or twice a year at most‚Ä¶ I have experienced no loss of depth, even when not having penetrative sex for 3-4weeks, which I think is the longest I have gone without penetrative sex in the past 2 and a half years.
</p>
<p>
I am fully sexually functional, and, despite only initially having 6 inches of depth (which went down to 5.5 inches after skipping dilation for one day 6 months post), I recently discovered that I was able to take in completely a guy who had over 8 inches. I don‚Äôt know exactly how that works, and I was very surprised and curious about it! My vagina does stretch, although it requires warming up first‚Ä¶ having sex with a really well endowed guy feels ‚Äòintense‚Äô at first and he can only get halfway in when we initially start fucking, but after a few minutes, he can go all the way, and it feels so intense in a really good way! I don‚Äôt know if I have managed to regain some depth by having sex with a well-endowed guy, or if it is simply a case of stretching of me and compression of him‚Ä¶ either way, it‚Äôs great, and I feel like I am still constantly discovering stuff about my body!
</p>
<p>
Even this late on, my vagina seems to change and surprise me‚Ä¶ from my newly discovered capacity to take very well-endowed men, to ostensibly textural changes inside, so it feels like the inside of a cheek, whereas a few years ago I think I was naturally a bit drier. It is constantly changing and growing as I am!
</p>
<p>
I think having regular penetrative sex helped a lot for me when it came to healing, and also dilation. I did get really down with dilation‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt an enjoyable experience, being both mentally and physically uncomfortable; sex, however, was at first very validating, but also extremely pleasurable, fascinating, and liberating to finally feel in connection with my body. I was very taken by it for several months. It was like discovering a new world and being given free reign to explore‚Ä¶ the desire to have a relatively large amount of penetrative sex was probably the ‚Äòcherry on the cake‚Äô of my healing, and I think certainly contributed to becoming, and remaining, fully functional. It entirely replaced dilation for me - and I did it a lot more than I dilated!
</p>
<p>
I imagine I could probably go without dilation and/or penetrative sex now for several months without adverse effects. I may become a bit tighter, and sex at first may feel more ‚Äòintense‚Äô (that‚Äôs a good thing for me), but I don‚Äôt think I would permanently lose any depth at this point. Maybe it would shrink after a few years of no sex/dilation, but either way this vagina feels very firmly here to stay ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Hi, you said that you have protruded urethra opening and i saw some results on reddit which have it (as well, a results from his ppt on his website) This is something that creates me mixed feeling.  Did you get this reduced? Any idea which percentage of people might get this pronounced urethra opening ? Many thanks

Hey, I‚Äôm not sure about percentage of people, but I suspect it‚Äôs more of a problem if you are well-endowed in the first place.
</p>
<p>
I did get it fixed with the free revision that was offered - at least when I had surgery, every patient was entitled to a free revision if they wanted, and so I had a cosmetic revision to reduce my labia minora, create a more defined anterior commissure, and get rid of the urethral tissue (which was pretty much hidden and unnoticeable for me anyway)

I m in the small size so. The free revision stands but i would like to have it done in the first surgery (if its possible of course), in some cases are very prominent for me for having it for a year (mentally speaking )

I would say the whole surgery recovery period lasts for a year+ anyway, and can be mentally taxing. You really have to mentally prep for it. I didn‚Äôt see the whole process as complete until I had healed from revision about 20 months after the initial surgery
</p>
<p>
I wonder if Dr Bank has fewer incidences of urethral tissue protrusion? Dr Suporn doesn‚Äôt operate anymore, but his prot√©g√© Dr Bank seems to get even better results than his teacher

Trans guy here who knows very little about the procedure. It looks like a vagina, just the flaps aren‚Äôt pink like they are on someone born with it. Do they not use the scrotal skin for the labia minora? The scrotal skin is the same as the labia minora in afab people, just not fused to make the scrotal sack. And do they offer tattooing to make the color more pink? I‚Äôm sorry if any of this is worded bad, I‚Äôm used to talking about trans guy surgeries but have no idea if you girls prefer different ways of talking about it or something I‚Äôm not aware of.

Hey! For some reason I didn‚Äôt get a notification here, so lucky you said on my other account
</p>
<p>
So the labia minora is formed from penile skin on the outside, and on the inside skin from the underside of the foreskin is used, so it‚Äôs pink there. Tattooing is available to make it pink as well. Note though, I have vitiligo around that area, so it‚Äôs generally a lot paler than it ordinarily would be for others with the same surgery - i don‚Äôt think it would be pink on the outside for me, but instead a bit darker.
</p>
<p>
The scrotal skin is actually homologous to the labia majora in AFAB people, and my labia majora is formed from it
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps! And no trouble re. language, I‚Äôm good with whatever

How old were you when you started HRT, and old were you when you had your surgery?
</p>
<p>
Were you previously circumcised? (I&#39;m guessing not, but it&#39;s worth asking.)
</p>
<p>
Do you have any thoughts/observations on how Dr. Bank&#39;s work compares to Dr. Suporn&#39;s?

Hey, so I was in my late teens when I started taking estrogen. I didn‚Äôt take blockers because I had relatively low T for a teenage boy, and estrogen by itself suppressed it to cis levels (at least until a couple of months before SRS, when, for whatever reason it shot up, which gave me the opportunity to preserve my regained fertility, so that seemed fortuitous albeit extremely distressing at the time)
</p>
<p>
I was in my early 20s when I got SRS, but recovery took a good year out of my life.
</p>
<p>
I was not previously circumcised. I‚Äôm British, and circumcision isn‚Äôt really a thing in Europe.
</p>
<p>
I rushed SRS because Suporn announced his retirement when I was thinking about booking it... I did not want to see anybody else apart from Suporn. However... after having met Dr Bank and seen his work, I think his results are equal, if not better, than Suporn‚Äôs, and so would be more than happy to see Dr Bank if I were to have the surgery today. I‚Äôm tempted to schedule a small cosmetic revision with him if I ever have the spare cash.

Suporn has described two methods for creating a vulva based on the amount of available tissue that in his paper he called type A and type B. Type B is used more often if there is less original tissue to work with like if the person was circumcised as one reason.
</p>
<p>
Also super curious if you can distinguish a difference with the secondary sensate organ that he creates vs the clit?

Ah!
</p>
<p>
Well I was definitely type A then. I was bizarrely well-endowed, and uncircumcised, and the above result was actually after a cosmetic revision which I had at 18 months to reduce the size of my labia and generally neaten things a bit.
</p>
<p>
I was in a relationship with another trans woman who had her surgery with Suporn 6 months before me, and so I had the opportunity to be examined by him half a year before my own surgery, and he told me that I had a lot of tissue... it would probably mean needing a cosmetic revision a while afterwards if I wanted things to be really neat - and I think he realised that aesthetics were super important to me.
</p>
<p>
For whatever reason, the large amount of tissue did not translate to greater depth for me. Maybe that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not that tall, or quite small framed. I only had 6 inches of depth after surgery, which, with reduction in swelling and maybe some issues in dilation in the first year, was reduced to between 5-5.5 inches. This doesn‚Äôt affect my sexual functioning though, and I have enough sex that I find I don‚Äôt need to dilate anymore and won‚Äôt lose depth. That could also be that I am 3 years post-op now...
</p>
<p>
With regards to the Chonburi organ... that‚Äôs a hard one to describe. I previously wasn‚Äôt much of a fan, disliking both the aesthetics of it (though, it is hidden in every situation apart from actual gynaecological exams), and the feel of it. I thought it felt unpleasant numb compared to my clit if ever I touched it specifically, however, I realise now that when stimulated in addition to my clit... i.e. when that whole area is stimulated, it feels great, and way better than when just my clit is touched. I know that might sound odd the idea of stimulating two areas at once, but as it sits just behind the clit and slightly to the bottom, you have pay MORE attention to stimulate just the clit, rather than both. Indeed when I thought it was just my clit being stimulated before, by myself or when having sex with others, I realise it was actually the whole area including the chonburi organ. I basically view the organ as a slight extension of my clit. I feel like it functions in a similar way to the clitoral shaft/crus in cis women, and it has never been clocked by sexual partners as anything unusual in anyway.

<p>
So this wasn&#39;t a problem? I was under the impression that Suporn specifically had issues with too much tissue. I worry any surgery I have will leave me with a protruding vagina.

Hey,
</p>
<p>
No this wasn‚Äôt a problem. More tissue is always better generally, but he is very conservative and likes to keep as much of it as possible in case of any possible issues like necrosis (issues which I did not have)
</p>
<p>
It caused no functional issues for me, but I did prefer a neater look, so I went back for a small cosmetic revision, which was free - not because there were any issues, but because he offers this to all patients.
</p>
<p>
Within the revision, I had my labia minora slightly reduced, and my anterior commissure slightly more defined.
</p>
<p>
I would say that the aesthetic results were still great before revision, and this was confirmed by a cis gay woman I had been with, but after surgery, I went from having a fairly ordinary looking vulva, to a neater one, I guess ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You know, I can‚Äôt say exactly. When I first reserved surgery in 2016, I think it was at least ¬£15,000- ¬£18,000 gbp. I‚Äôm not sure what that would be in your currency, and the price may have changed.
</p>
<p>
Factoring in international flights and hotel costs for about a month, it was eye-wateringly expensive for a young person without insurance!
