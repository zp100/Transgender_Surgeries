<p>
I am about seven months post-op from a simple bilateral orchiectomy with Dr. John Kowalczyk in Los Angeles.
</p>

<strong>
The Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The operation took around one hour and with general anesthesia.  I had my boyfriend drive me to and from the surgical center.  Driving from the surgical center to my home took around 2 hours which was NOT FUN! I was given a jock strap which held gauze in place around the surgical site.
</p>
<p>
The pain started about an hour after surgery.  I noticed &#34;two kinds&#34; of pain, which I think are associated with (1) the surgical site itself (&#34;outside pain&#34;) and (2) the nerve endings where they cut the testicles (&#34;inside pain&#34;).  The &#34;outside pain&#34; was sharp and stinging while the &#34;inside pain&#34; was like a dull throbbing, similar to the feeling of being &#34;hit in the balls&#34;.  I was given Norco for pain management and Cephalexin for an antibiotic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
First week or so
</strong>
</p>
<p>
While I could walk around starting from surgery day, it was quite painful and challenging.  While the pain meds helped, it also made me forget that I shouldn&#39;t be moving.  I over exerted myself a few times, which then resulted in more pain later in the day. The &#34;outside pain&#34; got worse, but I think was exacerbated by the fact that the gauze was caught on the stitches/scabs; after cutting the gauze, the pain improved.
</p>
<p>
My first bowel movement was on day 3.  I was quite bloated the first few days.  Urinating was challenging with the jock strap.  The technique I invented was to fold down the strap and my penis very gently.  I then pee&#39;d into my shower while standing (I had to lean forward a bit).
</p>
<p>
I stopped taking Norco on day 4, and only took ibuprofen afterwards. I was naughty and had a G&amp;T while on Norco and got REAL SLEEPY.
</p>
<p>
By day five I started to wear normal underwear with some gauze for spotting.  Noticeable swelling and tenderness on the inside where I presume the testicles where cut from. Removing the jock strap made walking easier (it was quite bulky).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Back to work
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I went back to work on day 18.  I think I would&#39;ve liked a few more days of rest. Scabs were mostly gone by now.  &#34;Outside&#34; pain was completely gone by now.  &#34;inside pain&#34; occurred if I pressed on the swelling inside; this prevented me from sitting with my legs closed which was frustrating.
</p>
<p>
I was able to successfully masturbate at this time (I only use a vibrator).  It was a little painful, but not a problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Long term and general thoughts
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The &#34;inside&#34; sensitivity was completely gone by around 3 months or so.  At 7 months, if I poke around inside my scrotum I think I still feel a tiny bump where my testicles were severed.  It doesn&#39;t hurt at all. I can pretty safely hit myself in the groin area without any pain; it&#39;s kinda fun.
</p>
<p>
I have
<em>
lots
</em>
of excess skin. To be honest, it looks a little creepy to me, but I&#39;m happy with it since I want to save the material for possible future surgeries.  There is a scar about 1/2&#34; long that is vertically orientated along my scrotum, but it&#39;s not very visible to me.
</p>
<p>
Tucking is a lot easier.  My penis was never that large, and so my testicles contributed to the majority of my bulk. I can get a pretty flat appearance with some relatively tight panties.  However, the presence of the excess skin makes things a little ... sweaty.
</p>
<p>
I still get erections, but they are far less intense. I haven&#39;t noticed a significant change in fluid consistency; still liquidy and clear. I didn&#39;t notice any change in my libido.  I think I would have wanted to get rid of erections entirely since they can sometimes hurt.
</p>
<p>
I have insurance through my employer, but my total out of pocket cost was around $700.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I am very happy with my result.  Tucking is easier.  My testosterone levels are
<em>
much
</em>
lower.  The psychological benefit of not worrying about my T levels is immense.  I struggled to get my T sufficiently suppressed for a long time.    Since I&#39;m on injectables, I only take one pill a day (progesterone) and a have a weekly shot.  It&#39;s really great for someone who is quite forgettable.  I haven&#39;t had other surgeries, but I felt this recovery was pretty easy.  Aside from the first week which was a little rough, everything was smooth sailing. I even think my junk down there is a little cute!
</p>
<p>
However, I will say that I&#39;m pretty sure I want a vaginoplasty now!  Now that I&#39;ve done the orchi, the concept of more surgery is far less intimidating.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask questions!

Sorry! It was just a weird benefit that I noticed one day and didn&#39;t anticipate.

No, no need to apologize! It&#39;s actually something that I never questioned but realized now that it should have been.

I had an orchiectomy in March on a Wednesday and I was driving on Friday and back at work on Monday. I think it depends on how well your recover and the type of work you do.

I would consider it necessary. At around one week, I could hobble around by myself, but any kind of manual labor was practically impossible.  If my job only consisted of sitting, I think I could have gone back to work at around then.  I think it really just depends on your job and how you are.

Thanks for the feedback!  I feel like I should give back to the community.
</p>
<p>
From a usability perspective, I really enjoy my current HRT regime; I take very few pills.  I don&#39;t have any body/face progress pics on reddit, but I did make a post to
<a href="/r/TransTitsTimelines" rel="nofollow">r/TransTitsTimelines</a>
at the end of last year (before my orchi).  My T levels have much improved, but I&#39;m still dialing in my injection doses.  I have not noticed big effects from progesterone; I&#39;m on 100 mg/day.  However, all my relatives have relatively small breasts. If I take 200 mg before sleep, I sleep really deeply!
</p>
<p>
I am uncircumcised.  Hmm, rolling into itself is completely pain free for me, and has been that way my entire life.   I&#39;m sorry that it causes you pain... :(.
</p>
<p>
For best flatness, I
<em>
do
</em>
have to pull my penis back like a normal tuck.  For me, the biggest issue was that my testicles would &#34;flare out&#34; and not hold the tuck at all.

Why did you end up choosing Dr. Kowalczyk? I&#39;m still shopping around and I

appreciate posts like this. It&#39;s great to see these long term updates.

It essentially boiled down to convenience and cost.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Kowalczyk was in network for my insurance and was within a two hour drive of my residence.  Since orchiectomies are pretty straightforward and somewhat commonplace, I felt comfortable going with the easily accessible option.
</p>
<p>
When I called the office, I was told that he does orchi&#39;s a couple times a month for trans women, so that made me feel better.  Also, when I met him in person, he was really great.  The main downside was that his office is quite crowded and lacked some privacy when I had to disclose documents.

I don&#39;t think that happens anymore, but it&#39;s hard to tell because there isn&#39;t much material there.
</p>
<p>
I kept my scrotum, and there is still loose skin.  However, the excess skin has definitely shrunk over the years.
