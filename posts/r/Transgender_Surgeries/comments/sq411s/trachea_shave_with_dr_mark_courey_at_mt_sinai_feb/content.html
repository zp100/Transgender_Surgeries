I had a thyroid cartilage reduction surgery yesterday with Dr. Mark Courey at Mt. Sinai. I arrived at the hospital at 8:50am, was in surgery by 10:50am, out of surgery an hour later, and home by 3pm.
</p>
<p>
I still have some soreness and swelling today but I&#39;m over the moon with my results. The bump is GONE and so is the dysphoria. Every time I feel it I just smile a huge grin.
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t sure how lucid I would be after the surgery. I&#39;ve definitely felt a little out of it yesterday and today, mostly from the pain meds and anesthesia I think, but overall I feel pretty fine. Still trying to take it easy, and taking pain meds every 4 hours to try to stay on top of things. It hurts some to swallow and I&#39;m only eating soft foods, although the doctor&#39;s office cleared me to resume my normal diet as soon as I&#39;m comfortable. I can&#39;t get the bandage wet so I&#39;ll probably be taking baths instead of showers for the next week.
</p>
<p>
I believe I have a follow-up in a week, at which point I&#39;ll ask for recommendations on scar care.
</p>
<p>
My procedure was fully covered by Amida Care, a NYC Medicaid plan for trans and HIV+ patients. I had to get two letters of approval from my therapist and my primary care doctor.
</p>
<p>
Overall, highly recommend Dr. Courey and team. Most of the staff was sweet and good about using my correct name and pronouns, and the process was quick and relatively painless. The anxiety the night before was the worst part, I was waking up every hour because I was afraid of oversleeping and missing my arrival time at the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer any questions folks might have. Can&#39;t wait to buy some chokers. :)

Thank you so much!! Chokers are such a tgirl thing but my bump has been too big to actually wear any comfortably haha. The irony of not needing to hide it anymore but wanting something to cover it up anyways

How has your healing been? Any complications with this procedure a few months out? How is your voice? I‚Äôd love to do this procedure to &amp; definitely want to hear about the recovery! :)

Pretty much completely healed at this point. No changes to voice. Scar is almost completely invisible with where it was placed and the use of the silicone scar cream.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately after all of the swelling subsided I still have a small lump, but it‚Äôs still much better than it was, and the doctor warned this might happen because I‚Äôm slim.
</p>
<p>
Overall highly satisfied! Would recommend Dr. Courey.
