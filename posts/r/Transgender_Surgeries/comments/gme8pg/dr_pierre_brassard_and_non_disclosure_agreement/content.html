Just thought it’d be important as I haven’t heard or seen any posts saying it’s not true.

Agreed.  The bulk paperwork is about protecting the confidentially of other patients and the staff, as well as acknowledging what you are about to do.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been several revisions of the in patient agreements from people I&#39;ve known going there over the years.
</p>
<p>
The story I&#39;ve heard from people is about a dozen years ago there was a more rigid version of paperwork but it still wasn&#39;t as strict as people make it out to be.  Back then the clinic was also facing more hostility and not as much governmental protections.  This was also a point in time where the Internet wasn&#39;t as prominent as it is today.  And in fairness, I don&#39;t think a lot of people really understood what they were signing, they were a bit distracted... I know I was, but I still made sure to read the forms closely and ask a couple clarifying questions just for my own benefit.
</p>
<p>
This is nothing but an old wives tale, I&#39;d put it on Snopes if I could!

Definitely. 100% about the protections thing. I admire even Brassard sometimes as he is so well known I can only imagine he faces scrutiny in his own personal life. I gave him a big hug.

There&#39;s a few links to previous discussions on this in the wiki

This one from 2017  seems relevant
</p>

Its possible it was changed. I expect Brassard is probably sick of hearing about it by now,

yes I don’t believe this was in the 2019 form. There was something about making money off your experience but even then, tons of videos on YT are monitized and filmed from the hospital bed.
