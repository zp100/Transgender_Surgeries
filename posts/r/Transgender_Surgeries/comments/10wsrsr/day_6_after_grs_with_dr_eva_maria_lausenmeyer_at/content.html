So here I am now 6 days post op. Today was the first big day because the stent in my vagina was removed. It became quite annoying to feel a permanent pressure on your bladder and your intestines. The procedure was quickly done and the part hurting the most was cutting the sutures holding the stent in place.  The picture looks quite messy but it does not display the 3D I saw and it was absolutely amazing. Keep in mind, that the stent was just in there so the skin is not relaxed and there are a lot of bleeding wounds. The doctor touched my clitoris and I really had intense feeling in it. Not pleasure at all but I think itâ€™s a good start :) She washed the Inside of my vagina with sterile solution and applied wound healing gel inside and on the wounds.
