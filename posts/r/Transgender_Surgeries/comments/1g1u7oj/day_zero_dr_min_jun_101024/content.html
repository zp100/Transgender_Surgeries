I had a consult with Dr Jun recently. I&#39;m working on getting the stuff together that he needs to schedule a surgery date.

Not fast. I think I originally looked at his website and tried to sign up for a consultation in like February or March. The system told me that they were so slammed that they weren&#39;t even putting people on the wait list, but they would let me know when it opens again. So I was basically on the wait list for the wait list. I was surprised when I got an email in July with some instructions for what I needed to do to schedule a consult. I forget the details. Some online forms and signatures were involved. I was able to schedule a video consult in early August.
</p>
<p>
In the consult besides answering my questions, he described his requirements for getting on the wait list for surgery. Which was basically the 2 or 3 letters of support from a mental health professional and maybe also a doctor, as well as a pdf from your insurance stating exactly what their requirements are for GRS. They also want you to have started hair removal and he also wants you to do pelvic floor physical therapy. He said that makes dilation easiest and significantly reduces the likelihood of any need for a revision.
</p>
<p>
He said if I had all those things right now, they are scheduling surgeries in 2026. He also added that since I am local and already started hair removal, my odds of being able to jump the line when there is a cancelation.
</p>
<p>
I have my appointment with a provider to get my second letter of support next week and scheduling the pelvic floor physical therapy is on my todo list

Everyone is held up on the time frame of getting this surgery you need a minimum of 2 years of electrolysis to have the surgery any surgeon that has a faster timeline than that is just rushing it. Get on a list with a surgeon you are comfortable with start electrolysis and your time will come. This is not a surgery to rush

Thank you so much for explaining! Sounds like I need to jump on the wait list. I&#39;ve already been going at laser removal for over a year now so that&#39;s good. I&#39;ve gotta work on my pelvic floor and some letters. Tyty &lt;3

How long is the wait time for him? I heard it&#39;s like 4 years or something crazy now.

I waited a total of 2.5 years donâ€™t let the wait times discourage you go to a good surgeon not a surgeon with short wait list

Wow! I hope you keep us updated on how it goes in the future from now. Congrats, I am gonna save up money and get him eventually. I have opted to wait  for him rather than use a covered surgeon b/c I would rather wait/pay more and get a good result instead of rushing and getting cheap quality. &lt;3

Nah, not 4 years. I just scheduled my surgery with him for the end of 2025. His office was willing to put me on a  &#34;move up&#34; list for earlier dates too.
