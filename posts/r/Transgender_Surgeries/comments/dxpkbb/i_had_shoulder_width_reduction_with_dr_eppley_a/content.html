I had shoulder width reduction with Dr Eppley in Indiana on Oct 31. There&#39;s not much info out there about this procedure, so I thought I&#39;d share.
</p>
<p>
The surgery involves shortening the length of the clavicles by removing a segment of bone on each side. The results are instantaneous and there&#39;s really no swelling and little pain to speak of. It takes about 8 weeks for the bones to fully heal though, so you can&#39;t really use your arms much during that period. All in all, the cost was a little over 17000 USD.
</p>
<p>
Dr Eppley has some more info
<a href="https://exploreplasticsurgery.com/category/shoulder-reduction/">on his blog.</a>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really happy with the result. My shoulder width (bideltoid) has gone from 49.5 cm down to 45 cm. I&#39;m 182 cm tall, so according to
<a href="http://anthro.cs.uni-freiburg.de/#colx=100&amp;coly=13">this site</a>
I&#39;ve gone from average width for men my height, to the average width for women my height. Just what I wanted.
</p>
<p>
I travelled all the way from Sweden to Indiana by myself to have it done. It&#39;s doable, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend going alone unless you really have to. You won&#39;t be able to use your arms much for the first few weeks. Even the simplest things like getting dressed or going to the bathroom are a hassle. And I couldn&#39;t do my hair at all. I&#39;m just now allowed to flare my elbows a bit, &gt;2 weeks post-op.
</p>
<p>
The recovery itself is really boring though. I spent one night at the hospital, and then 9 more at the hotel before going back home. Most of that time was just spent sitting around watching TV and occasionally taking a short walk around the hotel.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, here are some pictures:

Have you noticed any changes to the movement of your shoulders?
<br>
Have you had a reduction in movement range of your arms?

I&#39;m only allowed to flare my elbows 45 degrees to my front and sides as of now. But I haven&#39;t noticed anything different other than being sore.
</p>
<p>
It should have no impact on the range of motion though. The surgeons that do this procedure only take 2-2.5 cm per side because of that. Any more and you run the risk of reducing the range of motion.

Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3&#34;03&#39; tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they&#39;re large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there&#39;s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it&#39;d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. -- mass edited with redact.dev

Am I a year late? Yes.

<p>
But just in case anyone still wants a link, here :
<a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(09)01494-9" rel="nofollow">https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(09)01494-9</a>
</p>
<p>
The main genes involved are sox9 and foxl2, but in humans they also seem to play some role in tumor suppression, so there&#39;s definitely some kinks to iron out before (if) this can be safely done in humans.

Hi there, do you have any update for this? Do your arms feel the same around your rib cage with your arms to your side? I&#39;m worried it&#39;d feel more constricted

Thanks! There will be a small scar slightly above the clavicle, in the supraclavicular fossa. It should fade with time.

What are the risks of the surgery? Are you more prone to any kind of back or bone issues after it? Either way, definitely considering it for myself after seeing your results, this is awesome!

It&#39;s similar to standard clavicle fracture surgery and carries similar risks. If not enough care is taken during rehabilitation, the fixation plates can break and/or the bones can fail to fuse together. Once it&#39;s healed there should be no issues though.

So glad you posted here. I saw your photos on Dr. Eppley&#39;s Instagram. I&#39;m scheduled with him in March for this and some FFS revisions so it really helps to hear about your recovery.

Not that I know of, no. The rehabilitation instructions state that you can return to full strength activities by week 12.

This is fair if the reason you lift weights is for body building I think. Building being the key word. With some of the breadth of shoulders gone, you have to build more muscle just to get back to start Bulk
</p>
<p>
But if the goal is to have narrower shoulders I assume they aren’t trying to build much bulk? Not super familiar with body building goals but I feel like it’s fair to say that, with narrower baseline of shoulders, it will take longer to look the same bulk as per surgery which I figure if someone wants this surgery they don’t mind that

It should have no effect once healed. This surgery hasn&#39;t been done for cosmetic reasons very long. But I haven&#39;t heard about any long term issues with regular clavicle fractures either.

Any answer to this thats not some variation of inclusive is lacking in scientific rigor.
</p>
<p>
Aging is not well understood let alone the effects of a particular surgical procedure on aging.
</p>
<p>
That said the evidence leans that any type of surgery causes stress to the body and in theory should accelerate aging some amount. Though even this is too far reaching from the concrete data we have available.

Thanks for sharing! It would probably be easier to compare if you were wearing the same striped top (especially since horizontal stripes gives the illusion of wideness).

The scars are placed in the supraclavicular fossa, i.e. the indentation above the clavicle. That helps making them a bit less visible. Time will tell, but I&#39;m hopeful they&#39;ll fade enough to hardly be noticable.
</p>
<p>
Sure! I&#39;ll probably post an update once it&#39;s healed a bit more.

Oh also, I read that it changes the angle of your shoulder so it&#39;s like your shoulders are sort of hunched forward? Be interested in a side profile pic too if not too inconvenient or so you have any comment about that? Thanks!

They&#39;re slightly rolled forward at the moment. But it&#39;s still very early in recovery, and the muscles are both weak and sore at this stage. It will lessen with time.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think I can take a good profile pic now with my limited movement. But I can post about it in a later update.

Dr. Eppley is one hell of a surgeon. He performs surgeries most other plastic surgeons would not dare attempt out of fear and lack of expertise. Your results are great, and you look significantly more feminine. Congratulations and I wish you a speedy recovery. :)

Does it look different from behind, or does it sort of roll forward instead? I wonder if it affects the positioning of the scapula, which from what I understand primarily attaches to the arm and clavicle

Sorry if this is an inappropriate question, but how would you advise someone looking to get this to manage the cost (credit cards, personal loans, just having the money, period, etc.)? On top of saving for ffs, I&#39;m just finding out about this now and am wondering how I would even begin to pay for all of this.

First get ffs as it can be rather expensive in general than second if possible just pay outright if you can&#39;t do half half

for the procedure itself and living expenses

Hey!i know it&#39;s been long since you first posted this but i hope you will see my questions.first of all i hope you&#39;ve recovered well!apart from that i have 2 questions: 1)dr eppley says that maximum reduction can be around 2.5 cm,how is it possible that you had 4.5 cm? 2) almost 3months later,how has your recovery been?do you have any problems with movement? If you see this thank you for your time!

Hi! The recovery has gone well, thanks!
</p>
<p>
1) To be honest, I&#39;m not sure how accurate those measurements were. Those were the numbers I got from Dr. Eppley, but I agree that 4.5 cm is a bit high. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s closer to 2.5 cm, but I didn&#39;t measure it myself before surgery.
</p>
<p>
2) Recovery was a hassle for the first 6 or so weeks. Everyday things like getting dressed, showering and carrying things were a lot harder than before. It&#39;s all back to normal now though. My movement is back 100% as well. Nothing lost there, thankfully.

Ooh, I definitely want to do something like that myself. Is one of them wider or is it just an optical illusion? Now we just need to figure out how to surgically widen hips.

That&#39;s the measurements taken by Dr. Eppley.
</p>
<p>
I find it really difficult to measure it myself correctly, but I&#39;ve tried standing between two objects and then measured the distance between them. That way I&#39;ve gotten 43-ish cm every time. But I don&#39;t have a &#34;before&#34; measurement using that method.

What is the difference between boacromial and bideltoid width? I know that my shoulders are about 16&#34; wide (
<em>
measured myself so not sure if that&#39;s 100% accurate, but they&#39;re around there
</em>
) and so that&#39;s 40 cm. One measure states that my shoulders are smaller than average for my height while the other says they&#39;re larger than average. I&#39;m not sure which measurement I should use though.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I did a Google search and I think I measured bideltoid width, but I&#39;m not sure.

It&#39;s worth it if you have a lot of shoulder dysphoria and are willing to spend the money to fix it. I wouldn&#39;t rate it as high as most other feminizing surgeries (SRS, FFS, BA, etc.) as the changes are quite subtle. But I&#39;m glad I had it done.

Do you know when you&#39;d be able to start doing office work (like computer+desk) post surgery? And can you damage yourself if you accidentally use your arms too much afterward, or you&#39;re just unable because it&#39;s too weak or stiff or something?

I have a desk job and I went back to work 11 days after surgery without issues. You can move your forearms and hands just fine after surgery, but you have to avoid shoulder rotation as that can cause the fixation plates to break.

Hi,
</p>
<p>
First of all, I would like to thank you so much for taking this effort and helping people like me. Its a great gesture.
</p>
<p>
I am a female with wide shoulders and am considering to get this done. I have a few questions, can you please answer me?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Did you see any restriction in the range of motion from earlier or long term issues/side effects? Did you have to take pain killers for weeks?
</li>
<li>
I have someone to take care of me after the surgery. Will it be helpful for a painless recovery because they can help me in doing things?
</li>
<li>
How much physical therapy has to be done for this?
</li>
<li>
The pic you posted is really good change. If you don&#39;t mind, can you please share your pictures keeping arms straight so that difference can be seen clearly. It would be so helpful to understand to consider this surgery
</li>
<li>
Do we have to get the plate removed later or is it ok to live with it?
</li>
<li>
are your shoulders rotated internally and have back pain because of it?
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Sure!
</p>
<ol>
<li>
No. My range of motion is the same as before. I only took painkillers for a week or so.
</li>
<li>
Definitely!
</li>
<li>
I just did what the recovery instructions said. Basically you do some very light exercises for 8-10 weeks, and every second week you increase the range of motion.
</li>
<li>
I might post an update further on, so I&#39;ll keep that in mind.
</li>
<li>
You can get them removed if you want to, but it&#39;s not needed. I got two plates on each side and I do feel them through the skin. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth getting them removed though.
</li>
<li>
I believe they&#39;re pretty much back to normal now in terms of rotation. No pain. I just experienced a fair bit of discomfort during healing.
</li>

Your shoulders do look significantly shorter, but it&#39;s hard to tell in that picture. Since you are wearing pink pants it makes your hips look wider. Rather than wearing the same black ones that slim your hips.
</p>
<p>
Also, do you think your collar bones look different from before? Do they protrude less with the procedure done? Are they a different shape?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for posting results!

I had this surgery with Dr Ann Sluzky and Dr Bagrat Baveyan, similar amount of reduction. Yes, don’t do this on your own. Recovery isn’t too bad as she explains. But luckily mine was a lot, a lot cheaper, I don’t think it would have been feasible for me otherwise. I had my plates removed 10 months later as I prefer not to have plates left inside me.

Thank you so much for your post! Your results look great! Not much info from patients on the internet. After a few years do you have any sensibility or reduction in motion? Met with Dr.Eppley but still unsure about the long term effects.
