You look beautiful, thank you for posting these very impressive results !
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping to get work done by Facial Team next year and very scared about going under general anesthesia again so hope you don&#39;t mind a few questions ?
</p>
<p>
Did you know exactly what you wanted before the consultation with your surgeon or did they help you decide what would be most effective ?
</p>
<p>
What was pain like on a scale of 1 / 10 after each surgery ? 10 being the worse pain you have experienced.
</p>
<p>
How do the results compare to your expectations ?
</p>
<p>
Also, love the username beltalowda x

Sure! I mostly knew what I wanted going in, bounced off ideas with my surgeon &amp; made sure we were on the same page.
</p>
<p>
I did FFS in two stages. 1st stage was bonework, 7.5mm type 3 frontal setback, orbital contouring, jaw and chin contouring &amp; a browlift via incised scalp tissue. Recovery from that stage was hella rough. 9/10 pain for the first week or so.
</p>
<p>
2nd stage was soft tissue, closed rhinoplasty, bucchal fat removal etc. So far discomfort is far less severe, 4-6/10.

Was the jaw, chin or forehead pain worse for you ?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m thinking I could probably get away with just forehead, hairline lowering, orbital shave and my nose being fixed. The thought of them getting to my jaw through my mouth is just a bit much to comprehend ðŸ˜£
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m absolutely pathetic when it comes to pain, really can&#39;t handle it well at all since my last op. Before that it never bothered me but it&#39;s like a switch was flipped and everything now hurts at least twice as much ðŸ™„. still if my results are anywhere near as good as yours it would be worth it and I would be over the moon!

Jaw and chin def were the worst of it. Forehead recovery was pretty quick. Wishing you the best of luck!

Fantastic results!  Why did they do it in two stages?  Also do you have any other surgeries planned like body contouring or GRS?  Thanks and congratulations!
