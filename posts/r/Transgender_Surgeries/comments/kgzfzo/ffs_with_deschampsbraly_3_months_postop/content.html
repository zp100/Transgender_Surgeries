I had FFS with Deschamps-Braly about 3 months ago, on October 8th. I will probably post an update after my final appointment with Deschamps-Braly, something like 8 months out from surgery. I want to help people know what to expect, what I struggled with, and what was not so bad

Useful Things:
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Soylent: I love food. But chewing was way beyond me for a couple weeks. 3x of this a day and maybe a smoothie or two will have you set. This was a god send - the concept of blenderized food grosses me out.
</li>
<li>
Your favourite soup(s): be sure to mix it up a little. I stocked my fridge with a bunch of pre-made soups I like, but I got too much tomato soup. Not sure if I can ever enjoy it again. Don&#39;t push yourself and try to eat soup too soon - it
<em>
really
</em>
sucks if you get it on your head wrapping!
</li>
<li>
Big silicon straw: initially you won&#39;t be able to use this cuz you got some mega bimbo lips. But it makes consuming Soylent easier once you get the hang of things
</li>
<li>
Orajel: Dr. D gives it to you in a goodie bag. You might need more.
</li>
<li>
Entertainment: Initially video games are a little too intense. Zoning out to podcasts or familiar TV shows helped passing the time the first couple days.
</li>
<li>
Wedge or boyfriend pillow: You need to sleep with your head elevated for a few weeks. It helps reduce swelling faster. I got a fleecy fuzzy one that was extremely nice and helped keep me up in bed and comfy
</li>
<li>
THC tincture: if you aren&#39;t clean/sober, I would definitely recommend this. I got a 1:1 THC:CBD tincture which helped greatly with sleep, pain, and anxiety. Got me off the prescription drugs faster, which I think is good.
</li>
<li>
Most importantly: someone who can take care of you. Emotionally, physically. Drive you to appointments. You can do this by yourself, but it would be incredibly hard. My mother was kind enough to do all this for me, and I can&#39;t thank her enough :)
</li>
</ul>

Experience :
</h1>
<p>
<strong>
Pre-op
</strong>
<br>
Initially, I had a date with FacialTeam scheduled in May 2020. Spoiler alert, the death plague happened and I postponed my plans to the Summer.  July I had to postpone again. I was extremely frustrated - I really wanted to have FFS before I turn 30 and it began to dawn on me that international travel won&#39;t be a thing for a while.
</p>
<p>
In July I called up Deschamps-Braly. His clinic was the only other I was seriously eyeing - I knew he was talented in FFS and asked for the soonest possible date. I was offered a tentative date on October 8th. I got a consultation scheduled with him in late August. I live in a small suburban town about 30 minutes away from his office (assuming no traffic), so it seemed like a perfect fit.
</p>
<p>
The consult had some of the most aggressive intake procedures - all kinds of x-rays, and this weird thing that violated my mouth in the name of science to take internal pictures. This was done in a separate clinic not affiliated with Dr. D
</p>
<p>
Walking into his office for the first time almost reminded me of what Abercrombie and Fitch wished it could be. Moody lighting, masculine cologne smell, relaxing music. Didi, the hospitality manager welcomed me in, and I knew I would be in good hands. Zhanna , _the_ Physician Assistant (she plays a huge role in the surgery) took some intake photos of me. After some discussion, I met with the Dr himself.
</p>
<p>
Guys, I am not going to lie. I am (or thought) I was gay, but holy shit he is attractive AF. I was a little nervous talking to him at first, but I opened up quickly.
</p>
<p>
He showed me a slide deck about the surgery. Something that took me off-guard was the photos taken during surgery that were a part of the deck. Normally, I am a squeamish person, but it was presented in such an interesting way my curiosity overwhelmed my terror.
</p>
<p>
We talked about what I wanted (what he referred to as &#34;the works&#34;) and what other surgeons had said when I consulted with them. He agreed with most of their assessments, but also suggested a lip lift. (Also made my laugh by calling FacialTeam  &#34;the Spanish guys&#34;) I had asked about this with other surgeons, but due to my long lips and amount of tooth show, were wary about the procedure. He seemed confident he could pull it off, so we agreed to add it to the list. He took some measurements on my face, which he rattled off with precision and speed, to Zhanna.
</p>
<p>
I walked out of that appointment glowing and in such a great mood. Other consults I felt neutral after, or dysphoric (nothing like having the features you hate about yourself dissected in excruciating detail). I had a very good feeling about him.
</p>
<p>
To prepare for surgery, I went on a low carb diet and avoided certain foods and alcohol. My understanding is this was to help with swelling reduction, and to avoid excessive blood loss during surgery (wheee!)
</p>
<p>
I had a pre-op appointment with him 3 days before surgery. I brought my mum along, since she would be taking care of me as I recovered. We went over medications with Zhanna, and she talked about general care. She anticipated many of my mother&#39;s questions before she had a chance to ask them, and answered any questions in detail.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we met with the doctor. I had a chance to ask any final questions. I noticed he seemed much more down to earth this time, which makes sense. Previously, he had to sell himself and his practice to a potential client. He seemed genuinely excited to perform the surgery, it was freaking adorable. When my mum and I left, she turned to me and said &#34;That was fun!&#34;. As someone with a phobia around medical procedures, even I had to agree. Dr. D&#39;s demeanor and confidence really put me at ease, and I felt no emotion towards my surgery date besides excitement.
</p>
<p>
The night before, I got a hotel room with my sister in the city, at the Taj Campton, which Dr. D offers to his patients at a reduced rate. I didn&#39;t _need_ to do this, but I didn&#39;t want to have to worry about random traffic at 5am ruining my surgery time. The hotel was fine, not amazing. The staff were great though. If you are traveling and will need to stay in the city for a few weeks for surgery, I would recommend trying to find an air bnb or something more affordable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Day of Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I woke up to a call from the driver. I got into the car (a Mercedes-Mayback S-Class) for a 5 minute ride to the hospital. I walked in through the ER entrance (since it was 5 am, surgery started at 7 am) and started the intake procedure. The moment came that I was most dreading: starting an IV! I _hate_ needles, but especially anything intravenous. The IV nurse was a total sweet heart, let me freak out for a minute, and got it in with no issues on her end. The anesthesiologist explained the concept of general anesthesia to me, asked some questions, and assuaged my other concern of anesthesia awareness.
</p>
<p>
Pretty shortly, I was wheeled into the OR. As they pushed me down the hallway, they put some kind of benzo (mom nurse note: apparently this was Versed) in my IV to keep me chilled out. The OR was immaculate, Dr D was in there bobbing to some rock music. I got out of the gurney, onto the OR stretcher. The last thing I remember is Dr. D touching my shoulder and telling me all I had to do was wake up in a few hours.
</p>
<p>
I woke up in a few hours. The first thing I can remember is the intense dryness and pain in the back of my throat - this was due to being intubated for 6 hours. I had one thing on my mind: ICE CHIPS.   Ladies, treat yourself. GET YOU SOME ICE CHIPS WHEN YOU WAKE UP. Apparently I also talked to Dr. D. I don&#39;t remember this.
</p>
<p>
Next thing I remember was my sister staying with me in the recovery room. She was able to stay for longer which made my day!
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
After my sister left, Zhanna was the night nurse taking care of me. Not going to lie, that night the single most challenging night of my recovery. I was tired, unable to sleep, unable to eat without assistance. I projectile vomited blood because too much had dripped into my stomach. Once that happened I felt a little better.
</p>
<p>
I closed my eyes and listened to some music and podcasts, existing in some weird twilight of post anesthesia haze, exhaustion, and pain killers. I felt a little bit better, and was able to get out of bed with Zhanna&#39;s help. My drains were taken out, and I got to be wrapped up like a mummy
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/ltztrrmh19661.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=407e6fd1b4cc2d93e5ffb11bcb741a36a3ab1590">My hair was braided for me!
</a>
</p>
<p>
Around 3 am I took a victory lap recovery wing and as a reward Zhanna took out my catheter. I felt like I had turned a corner. Morning came quickly, and after demonstrating my ability to pee, I was discharged.  I don&#39;t remember much else from that day. I think I tried to play a video game? I was unable to use a straw to sip Soylent, and even contorting my mouth to drink from a bottle was unpleasant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Physical recovery was the roughest at the first week. I got overstimulated easily. Very dizzy, prone to anxiety and my emotions were all over the place. I was prescribed Xanax XR for the day, Valium for the evening. Tramadol was used to control pain. No opiates, which I think is nifty.
</p>
<p>
Different parts of my face were numb - weirdest being the area between your chin and lips. At 3 months out, I finally have regained full sensation.  Out of the hospital, my pain never went past 5. FFS offers aches, pressure, and feeling like you have the worst head cold of your life. No sense of smell, and mouth breathing really really sucks. It made it hard to sleep, made my teeth look grosser, and waking up each morning felt like the Sahara desert in my mouth and throat. My energy levels were very low.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
My first post op appointment my hair was washed, head wrapping taken off, staples were taken out, stitches removed, and packing (but not the stent) in my nose were removed. Getting everything off my face felt incredible - a literal weight removed!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
After getting my wrapping removed, I started to walk 2 hours today on the Dr&#39;s orders. It really helped give me a sense of purpose. And getting outside in the sunshine WITH A HAT AND SUNSCREEN literally brightened my day. Things noticeably got better around this time - pain, mood, energy levels.
</p>
<p>
The second post-op appointment was the big day! It was one week after my operation. I got my nose cast removed. Dr D gets super into it -  he personally removes the final cast to reveal the nose. Having the stents removed was also nice; I could almost breathe through my nose!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/xcrw8fe4pd661.png?width=494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52a16003403c04ce05132a2101e41ee08fc7ae77">Nose cast freshly removed!
</a>
</p>
<p>
Every day of recovery got a little bit better. I returned to work on week 4 - I took an extra week off than Dr. D&#39;s 3 weeks since I was extremely self conscious about how I looked, and I wasn&#39;t ready for back to back zoom meetings.
</p>
<p>
The period after I had my cast removed to fairly recently was the most challenging part. I had a long time to sit with my thoughts. The initial pain of recovery was not awful, when it felt like getting to the end of the day was an accomplishment. The swelling, visible incisions, and stitched hairline made feel like a freak. My hair was an absolute mess - the silicon scar gel I wear made it look oily at the roots and I couldn&#39;t refresh the color, so it just looked like an uneven mess. I had mad roots growing in.
</p>
<p>
I got through this time by telling myself to be patient, and to trust the process. I had to have faith that this all was going to be worth it. But even still, it is one thing to say it, and another to know it. Try to live your life one day at a time, and remember that it takes time for healing to happen, and swelling to go down. Dr D says that you won&#39;t see your full result until a year out!
</p>
<p>
I was really worried about if putting myself through all this - living with my mum (love you!) to save on rent for most of my post college life, spending time, energy, money, time off work, was all worth it.
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
Up until recently, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to give an honest answer. I could definitely see improvements. Everything was put into focus one day after I had gotten my hair bleached, and my sister did my makeup:

</a>
</p>
<p>
But now I definitely can: It was so worth it.

Aah you look great! This was a really fabulous write-up, thanks for sharing. Zhanna was also who stayed with me overnight and was so fabulous. Having stayed over night in hospitals before having her watch me the whole night in a private room definitely had me feeling so well taken care of.

Right? Zhanna is freaking incredible. I can&#39;t get over how she stayed up all night watching over me.

<p>
And thanks for posting your story! I remember looking at your post, and it really made me feel better to see a light at the end of the tunnel (AKA 3 months)

You look absolutely amazing!
<br>
I have a question about your consolation with Facialtime. I am just starting with research and I went through basically all of their before/after (on their page). And I don&#39;t know if I am searching wrong - because after all I&#39;m just starting with research - or something but I can&#39;t see brow lift mentioned anywhere.  It&#39;s just all about forehead reconstruction. You wrote you had brow lift and you initially wanted to go there, so I assume they do offer brow lifts? I really want to go there because I live in Europe, but brow lift (without other forehead work) is a must for me.

Hey, I don’t know if they offer brow lift independently of type 3. But they should be able to answer that during your initial consult

</p>
<p>
How long between calling to schedule a consultation &amp; having the consultation, and then how long from consultation to surgery?
</p>
<p>
I’m strongly considering him for FFS and I was curious how long the it took from first calling to start the process. :)

Congrats lady, you look great! I had basically the same procedure with Dr. D back in late 2018 and I think to call it life-changing is an understatement. Even still I notice small changes of things softening or improving in subtle ways, partially from reduced swelling and probably a bit just from HRT doing its thing (i was only at 1 year on HRT when I had surgery). You have a lot to look forward to as the swelling gradually recedes!
</p>
<p>
I would echo what Chickensfoot6 says about noses, mine also leans slightly to one direction, which I honestly don&#39;t mind. But I don&#39;t have any kind of impediment to breathing easily through both nostrils - that would be really upsetting. I also experienced loss of sensation in the area between my lower-lip and chin, even still I can only really feel sporadic tingling in that area. It&#39;s not a big deal for me personally but something folks should be aware of as a rare complication.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, congratulations, I hope recovery continues to treat you well!

Hey thanks for your detailed response! I should I have mentioned that I am 6(?) years into HRT so those fun changes are probably not happening any more. That being said, I am happy to hear you continued to see changes as swelling went down.
</p>
<p>
I had no idea that Dr. D has a history of noses that don&#39;t behave they way they should. I would like to get that information out there!!
</p>
<p>
I am lucky enough to have had my sensation come back between my bottom lip and chin. I occasionally get what I can only describe as a slightly burn-y prickly sensation on occasion, which I assume must be  nerves growing back. It reminds me of the sensation I felt when nerves were re-connecting after bottom surgery, although the degree and intensity is much less!

I forgot to mention in my message, your makeup game is absolute fire and I really hope one day to be on your level haha
</p>
<p>
To be honest I hadn&#39;t done much research, here or on realself, so I&#39;m not sure have prevalent the nose issues are with Dr. D&#39;s FFS. A big part of the reason I went with him is I know myself, I go down rabbit-holes, I really didn&#39;t want to get sucked into endless research about surgeons and techniques and foreheads etc., there&#39;s just sooo much out there. I asked him to just do his thing, and felt confident that he would do a great job, and I definitely feel like he did!
</p>
<p>
At 6 years your changes may be less dramatic, but I feel like the consensus is that swelling reduction is for sure ongoing at 12 months and maybe a bit longer. Get hyped! haha- oh and one thing to consider after you hit the 1 year mark is Accutane (the acne medication), he mentioned that there is growing evidence that it can help reduce the size of the glands in the nose and forehead which gives the nose an overall nicer shape. I haven&#39;t gone down that road yet but I probably will reach out to him about it soon!

Oh my sister did my makeup in the last pic she is amazing and I do my best to glean little tidbits of info with her.
</p>
<p>
Well, let me tell you, I did the whole rabbit hole thing and I ended up on Dr. D. I could change Drs, I would not. I did hear about that unfortunate trans man who had terrible results from him, but I didn&#39;t see any from trans women. I did tell him pretty much do his thing as well :)
</p>
<p>
That is really interesting to hear about accutane. I have had giant pores since puberty and I have always been self conscious about it. Really bad acne when I was being subjected to testosterone, which mostly cleared up once I went on HRT. Aren&#39;t the side effects of the &#39;tane pretty rough though? I remember researching it in high school. I am planning on a trip to a med spa to see if I can get treatment that will improve the quality of my skin - I got the underlying bone structure fixed, now to get the surface stuff fixed :)

Sorry I meant to respond to this earlier! The side effects of accutane can be nasty from what I&#39;ve heard, but apparently you only need to be on it for 6 - 12 months for the glands to permanently shrink, so its not a forever thing. I&#39;m very comfortable experimenting on myself for the &#39;cause&#39; so it is something I will pursue. Oh and I plan to make a post here with my results when the treatment has concluded :)

I found this by searching Reddit for &#34;cologne improves mood&#34; after finally noticing I always felt much happier after using a specific cologne.
</p>
<p>
I saw your post and had no idea what &#34;FFS with Deschamps-Braly&#34; was, so I opened it and cycled through the pictures with Reddit Enhancement Suite (ie. had no idea what I was looking at).
</p>
<p>
I thought you had some awful disease that was eating away inside your head or something because I couldn&#39;t imagine what all this kind of head surgery is for. I was looking at your &#34;after&#34; photos when all of a sudden it occurred to me that maybe this was just plastic surgery for beautification purposes, so I Googled &#34;FFS with Deschamps-Braly&#34; and immediately understood. Then, I noticed what sub this was posted in for the first time.
</p>
<p>
I just want to say, I think you looked absolutely great before, so you should definitely be happy now, I guess. I know I&#39;m not the one making the life choices here, but I like the purple, too! Glad to realize you don&#39;t have some necrotic brain disease like I initially thought, LOL. For quite a while, I was thinking, &#34;Oh no, I hope she&#39;s alright. I hope she&#39;s happy with her new look. It&#39;s subtle, so hopefully she is okay with it...&#34; LOL because I literally thought you were having parts of your head removed due to some serious disease.
</p>
<p>
FFS with Deschamps-Braly really sounds like some scary autoimmune disease to me. But, I have an autoimmune disease, so I&#39;m always thinking about all the other ones out there.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Oh, just scrolled down and saw the 4-month pic with the bleached hair. OK, I guess I don&#39;t miss the purple. Looks great!

I can&#39;t disclose the exact sum, since each surgery is tailored for the patient. I paid out of pocket. Ball park figure is around ~50k
</p>
<p>
I know that Amazon and Starbucks insurance will cover him, but its a bit of a hassle for other insurance companies, if even possible.

That&#39;s what I figured... my quote from him was about 40k which is totally unreachable for me. I do hear about people having success with insurance companies from time to time though so I was just curious.

That office is something else. huh?.. it made me feel both reassured and like total riff-raff all at the same time.

Thank you for your extensive explanation of recovery and sharing your results!  I have a consultation for FFS with Dr. D in April.  I’ve already consulted with Harrison Lee, Facialteam (“the Spanish guys”), and Dr. Satterwhite.  I’m also doing a consultation with Toby Mayer in January.  Hopefully I’ll get FFS this year.  I’m leaning toward Dr. D or Facialteam (whichever I can best afford and access with travel— I’m pretty close to San Francisco, so Dr. D will be easier on the travel part).  I had three procedures with Dr. Satterwhite, and I love him, but I haven’t seen any of his FFS results yet.   You look stunning!  The results of Dr. D are quite extraordinary.  I’m looking forward to my consultation!

You can see some of Dr. Satterwhite&#39;s work on his website but those photos are from 3+ years ago. He&#39;s significantly improved since then. the FFS FB group has some amazing results by him if you&#39;re curious.

I was impressed with my consult with FacialTeam, Dr. D&#39;s consult was a whole other level though. I think a large part of that was in-person vs virtual though. I think you would be very happy if you went with them. Ditto for Dr. D.

What I mean is, he botches them. I don’t know how frequently. I’ve spoken with around a dozen trans women who had FFS with Dr. D and their noses are crooked. He botched mine too. My nose leans to the right and a bone on the inside of my left nostril sticks out, narrowing the airway. I can’t breathe well from that nostril. To make matters worse — almost a year after my surgery, that same nostril got very infected. I developed a fever and that area swelled up. It was painful. I still get pain there every 1-3 months. I’m 2+ years post op. At this moment I’m saving up for a revision. Not with Dr. D. 😟 so when I said you lucked out—I wasn’t just talking about aesthetics.
