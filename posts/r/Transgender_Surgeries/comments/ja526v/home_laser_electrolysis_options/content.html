I&#39;m a certified electrologist, moderator of the hair removal forums at
<a href="http://hairtell.com">http://hairtell.com</a>
and probably the best known DIY electrologist and advocate. I did my own face in blend, in a magnifying mirror while completely poor. I used professional grade equippment purchased used from retired or downsizing electrologists and learned from the professionals over at hairtell.
</p>
<p>
I dont recommend at home  IPL for the face and I further dont recommend those &#34;One Touch &#34; or &#34;finally free&#34; galvanic electrolysis at home kit. They are to put it bluntly, the poorest possible implementation of an electrolysis machine.
</p>
<p>
Instead, look around places like ebay, Craigslist, kijiji.ca   for machines made by APilus, Instantron, Clairblend,  or silouette tone. . Make sure what you buy is in working order and test it on arrival, and make sure it is capable of blend treatments. I dont recommend facial work as a first try, and I recommend blend for any facial work you do do. If you are DIY-ing, you have all the time in the world.
</p>
<p>
Get yourself a copy of &#34;the Blend Method&#34; by Michael Bono ( available at texas electrolysis supply for I think $45 and study it. Ask lots of questions on hairtell.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m proof that it can be done. But it is by no means a trivial thing to learn how to do electrolysis and many, are not cut out for it. It requires good vision and hand coordination. and a butt-load of time. But yes, it can be done, DIY is a thing that many professionals dont like to talk about.

I bought a second hand electrolysis machine from an old salon. I bought it as it does flash. I read and studied widely, I asked two of my electrologists for advice and help. Ended up doing my arms and legs, and some legs and under arms for girlfriends. I won&#39;t attempt hands or face. Those require a level of finesse that I don&#39;t have just yet and think i will need the help of a professional to learn - and definitely not on my own face! Although on the old electrolysis forums there is an amazing transwoman and single mother who did end up doing herself. Maybe ask over there? Hairtell.com/forum

That would be me. I moderate hairtell these days. I dont recommend using that old machine on your face by yourself ever. I recommend blend only for diy facial work because it is more forgiving to inaccurate insertions which commonly result from doing DIY in a mirror with reversed movements :)   Get yourself a blend capable epilator and yes DIY on the face is possible, but very difficult in some places. An even better ideal is to have a partner or family member learn with you, so they can work areas you cant so well..

I was thinking about it, but... the machines are different. Newer ones are easier to use and they are less painful.
</p>
<p>
However, I&#39;d still go to specialists. Also, you may want to avoid damaging the skin that will be used in a moist environment. It also may impact sensitivity.
</p>
<p>
I was on the same boat from March to June when I had my surgery. That was a very difficult time to stay on track with hair removal.
</p>
<p>
Found a salon about 1.3k miles from home (19 hours drive one way). But then it got closed and I found another one just 5.5 hours one way from home. In the end it was worth it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d also mention that different surgeons have different requirements for hair removal. Some do scraping, which may relax the requirements.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

Would you be happy walking around with pitted scars on your face? if not, then I wouldn’t recommend doing electrolysis on your face cause the risk of scarring is high. I also wouldn’t recommend doing genital electrolysis to prep for surgery as scarring could also affect the elasticity of the skin.

Look here
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/wiki/r/TransWiki/wiki/hair-removal/content.md#learning-electrolysis-and-diy" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransWiki/wiki/hair-removal#wiki_learning_electrolysis_and_diy</a>
</p>
<p>
And look through the post history of
<a href="/u/SeanaTG" rel="nofollow">u/SeanaTG</a>
as she is a professional electrologist who started by doing diy on herself and discusses it a number of times.
