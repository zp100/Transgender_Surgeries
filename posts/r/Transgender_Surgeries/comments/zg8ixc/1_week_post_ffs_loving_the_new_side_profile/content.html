Thank you!  It has been a hellish week though‚Ä¶.  Can‚Äôt wait for swelling to calm down (my front view still looks like I‚Äôve been beaten beyond recognition), which has been very depressing.  But I guess it‚Äôs just a healing and time game now.

Dr. Spiegel in Boston.  This forum hasn‚Äôt been too favorable on their views with him, but I found him and the staff very well educated, friendly, and surgery went great.  I would use him again if I ever needed to and I recommend his services.
</p>
<p>
I also liked the results of Toby Mayer, but preferred to stay closer to home (east coast).  They took care of most of my insurance, so I should get reimbursed for 70-80 percent of the bill via Anthem BCBS.  I‚Äôm only a week out, so most of my face has about 60-70 percent of swelling left to reside.
