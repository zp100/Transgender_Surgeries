Hi everyone! For quite a while, since I was intending on moving to Germany for a long time anyway, I was intending on receiving my SRS with Drs Jürgen Schaff and Susanne Morath. However, I just checked in on their clinic website and realized that Schaff has retired since 2019, to be taken over by a new surgeon, Dr Hendrik Schöll. I would like to ask if anyone has met Dr Schöll, or has undergone a surgery with him and could provide a review, or at least provide any information about him that can&#39;t already be found online?

Schaff has not retired - he&#39;s started a practice on his own with a new website. :)

As Sinyria stated, Schaff has not retired, but as a result of a professional disagreement has moved to his own practice (where he no longer demands the extra 3000€) - information may be found on his website here:
<a href="https://drschaff.de/">https://drschaff.de/</a>
</p>
<p>
To my knowledge, Schöll was being trained as Schaff&#39;s successor and had assisted in surgeries while Schaff and Morath worked together, but from inquiring into the nature of this professional disagreement at a consultation with Schaff earlier this year, part of the reason he left was because he did not trust Schöll&#39;s capacity to perform these surgeries alone yet - presumably due to inexperience. My understanding from this consultation is that Schöll had performed up until this point very few surgeries alone. One need take this with a grain of salt, however, given the nature of this dispute might given an incentive for each side to sow misinformation (something I am aware that Morath has done - indeed precisely by seeming to propagate the myth that he has &#39;retired&#39;).
</p>
<p>
Indeed, if you search on the biggest German trans group on facebook, TGG, there is a comment from someone who had been to a consultation with Schöll confirming that since January 2019 he has  &#39;been involved in 100 operations&#39; (&#39;schöll war nach eigener aussage seit januar 2019 an ca. 100 ops beteiligt&#39;). This by all means illustrates his inexperience, which should be taken into deep consideration.

Hey there, I had top surgery with Dr Schöll about 3 weeks ago. I initially had top surgery scheduled for February, but things came up and thus I had to postpone it to August. During that time, Dr Morath was on vacation, so Dr Schöll and their team operated on me. I only mention this because I think this is really relevant to the question. And also, I can only speak of my own experience.
</p>
<p>
I only had really good experiences with him. Apart from the fact that he&#39;s a very pleasant person to be around, he&#39;s competent, confident and realistic about you as a patient and what can be done/what he can do. The day before surgery, I had the pre-operation discussion with him and his team and he took the time and patiently answered all the questions I had, no matter how trivial. So yeah, he&#39;s very sensitive towards you as a patient.
</p>
<p>
The surgery itself went very well for me. Many people see a risk in doing top surgery outpatient (meaning that you do the surgery and then can go home/to the hotel you&#39;re staying at) and a lot of guys have reported that they either collapsed afterwards or had complications like hematomas. In my opinion, the first is not much of a concern, if you&#39;re otherwise a fit individual. And there are cases, such as myself, where there were no complications whatsoever after surgery. Their secretary even called me up the day after to ask about my wellbeing because I didn&#39;t call them. I had no reason to, after all.
</p>
<p>
I booked a hotel nearby and my parents took care of me. I had no pain when I woke up and Dr Schöll made sure to check up on me multiple times while I was still at the hospital. He&#39;s also a quite humorous person, by the way, I felt comfortable at the hospital all the time.
</p>
<p>
Two days after that, I had an appointment at their office for a check-up. That was the first reveal of my surgery result and it&#39;s really good. I still have some swelling, but it will go down in time. I&#39;m really impatient though. There&#39;s no excess skin. I had another appointment a few days ago to get the stitches removed, which went smoothly as well. My last appointment with him will be next month for the final check-up.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I had a good experience with him as a surgeon and would not have opted for anyone else. He is less experienced than Dr Morath, obviously. But I still think he&#39;s very skilled and did a great job on me.
</p>
<p>
I went to multiple surgeons in Germany and ultimately settled for Morath &amp; Schöll in Munich. I know some other transguys who had their top surgery with Dr Morath and Dr Schöll as well and their reports would be along the lines of what I&#39;ve written up.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps.

Thanks for the reply!! I don&#39;t know how well transguy surgery translates into transgirl surgery but the testimonial absolutely helps. Hope you recover well and that it makes you happy

Ah, sorry, I wasn&#39;t aware you meant female surgery! In that case, I actually don&#39;t have any experience since I don&#39;t even know any transgirl personally. Anyhow, I hope it was somewhat of help. And thank you, recovery&#39;s going well. (:
