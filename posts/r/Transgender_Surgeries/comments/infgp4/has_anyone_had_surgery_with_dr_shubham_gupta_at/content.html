<a href="http://www.shubhamguptamd.com/">His personal website
</a>
and
<a href="https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Gupta-Shubham-1578726477">his page at the hospital
</a>
. I found out about him through the Transgender SRS Facebook page, and though his personal website says he offers vaginoplasty, it&#39;s not mentioned as a qualification or on his hospital page. I couldn&#39;t find any references to anyone who&#39;s had him (Susans turned up nothing, and a search on this subreddit only turned up a post from 3 months ago asking the same question I am). Apparently before he moved to Cleveland he operated in Lexington, Kentucky as well. Does anyone else have experience with him? Personally I think it&#39;s nice to know there&#39;s more than one option for GCS in the Cleveland area.

I am going with Dr Ferrando at CC, however I know someone who assists with Dr Gupta&#39;s surgeries:
</p>
<p>
-UH has a full medical team, including a (very good) cosmetic surgeon to assist Dr Gupta. Dr Gupta has more of a urology background from what I understand.
</p>
<p>
-They perform vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, zero depth SRS, and also revisions from other hospitals or revisions on their own work.
</p>
<p>
-They team is only about a year old, they don&#39;t have too many surgeries under their belt.
</p>
<p>
-Wait list is short, my electrologist has a client whom got in very quick, I believe somewhere between 3 to 6 months lead time. They perform a follicle scrape as well, not sure if they cauterize, but important because the client didn&#39;t have a lot of hair removal completed prior to surgery with the given lead time.
</p>
<p>
Hope some of this helps, I feel more secure with Dr Ferrando right now, because she has performed the surgery so many times (vaginoplasty). This is not to dismiss Dr Gupta&#39;s program, I&#39;m sure they have excellent results from what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s just limited volume.

I had him for reconstructive surgery in that very special area just a year ago and he is excellent.  He changed my life. I am completely back to normal like a teenage girl. It is not transgender surgery but was a long and difficult surgery that&#39;s not performed very often.  I would not hesitate to recommend him.
