i.e. no significant complications, reasonable satisfaction overall; functional, reasonable aesthetic results, orgasmic?
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm having very bad genital dysphoria but not sure if the risks of SRS are worth it :(

There are statistics on that. Orgasmic and functional I think most. Reasonable aesthetic outcome is subjective.
</p>
<p>
But then again... The possibility that you end up being a negative number on the statistics exists. Could you deal with that is the real question.

Where can we find stats on orgasmic and functional, and equally, what do you mean by functional, like, peeing? Or just general penetration? Not being able to pee would be lethal so...

Either this sub or the MTF one have some links on the sidebar. Otherwise use google. By functional I mean PIV, having orgasms and obviously peeing.Yea not being able to pee would be madness :&#39;D

As someone mentioned there are stats on orgasms and functionality. Most girls I know and myself included can cum.
</p>
<p>
With looks, I think a lot of trans women think with this idealist framework in their head that there‚Äôs this archetypal vagina. But if it‚Äôs not botched and you go to a decent surgeon and outline what you want, you should come out looking fine. I think a lot pass. Especially if you‚Äôve gone down an onlyfans rabbit hole and see all the beautiful and intricate shapes and forms vaginas take on.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve only seen a -couple- gnarly looking neo vaginas that don‚Äôt look like vaginas at all.
</p>
<p>
As for complications, they can be fixed if it isn‚Äôt horrible. I had a complication that had left me looking a little wonky. My left labia popped from swelling and the skin had to be removed and sewn back. I was depressed. Especially because my vagina was so pretty before the complication. But once everything healed and I had my revision labiaplasty, it looked fine. I‚Äôve gone on dates with people who didn‚Äôt know my t and didn‚Äôt clock me or my pussy.
</p>
<p>
I even have a friend who‚Äôs friends with a porn star and who‚Äôs seen a bunch of vaginas.  I was at a party and asked her if mine looked real and she said yeah, just that my lips are just thin. And I asked my hormone doc who‚Äôs a gyno, and she said the same thing. But the whole time I had thought people were lying to me. But they weren‚Äôt.
</p>
<p>
My depth isn‚Äôt that great, like ‚âà4 inches but I have used it and it feels amazing for me and the men I‚Äôve asked. And plus I‚Äôm getting another surgery to deepen it.
</p>
<p>
Tbh I think some trans women just ‚Äúpink‚Äù pill themselves into thinking that unless their pussy isn‚Äôt that archetypal image, or it‚Äôs not fully unclockable, they can‚Äôt be happy.
</p>
<p>
But I can tell you I was much happier with my asymmetrical vagina than I ever was with a dick. And now I‚Äôm even happier, even tho my coochie ain‚Äôt as fat as I wanted her üò≠

thank you, for your review. brought me a smile and some calm.
</p>
<p>
I am a bit anxious about all this, and had been only considering HRT uptil now. I don&#39;t have much down there dysphoria as such but always did want a coochie (strongly). Don&#39;t want to be in a situation where I have neither functional, or acceptable to me.
</p>
<p>
Does age matter?  I am 25+ and had my strong t-realization only about 2-4 years ago. Before that I had it all suppressed, due to some life events and environment.

Totally worth it. I had no major issues and even if I did it wouldn‚Äôt matter because I have never felt so in tune with my body and who am I. All that hate and dysphoria dried up for me. Really if you‚Äôre having terrible dysphoria now and suffering, you really can‚Äôt get much worse off. And considering the last stat I read on satisfaction for trans women was 96% positive, 5% undecided, and 1% negative, id say its a safe bet as long as you find a competent surgeon

So me personally, i love my vagina and i also did not find srs as bad as breast augmentation. I mean in the sense of &#34;autsch it hurts&#34; srs was more  draining afterwards.
</p>
<p>
I was lucky to have a surgeon who seperates the muscles down there differently, wich results in dilation began 10 - 11 weeks after surgery. I dilated then for 6 months once a day. I am now almost 2 years post op and dilate once a month maybe. If i lube up before Sex, i can have sex normal, without pre dilation. Depth is 6 inches and it all feels fine. I can Orgasm aswell. It feels great and im happy with that. It wasnt easy to let myself go during sex for probably a yearbor over a year post op.i was always worried he might hurt me, or break my vagina. It was stressful üò™  But now it all works fine and im sooooo happy üòä

I don&#39;t have detailed figures on the various details you mentioned but I happen to know that the last survey of post-op transgender patients showed that the numbers having regret about undergoing surgery worked out to 0.6% of patients here in Scotland. Figures were similar for the UK as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Out of transgender people I know personally IRL, none really talk about the details but they say they are totally happy with how things went.

The only complications I&#39;ve had have been granulation and soreness. Both extremely common, neither was major. Tho I can say treating granulation near the clit hurts a whole bunch.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy with the the look! I&#39;d be interested in getting a bit more labia if I can but the whole virus thing has made making an appointment to talk about that less front and center, and I&#39;m frankly happy to wait! I don&#39;t dislike it at all. This is a bonus more than an absolute need. I posted a recent photo yesterday.
</p>
<p>
As far as function well I cant get pregnant lol. I&#39;ve been able to orgasm from 2 weeks out. There is lubrication but I haven&#39;t been able to even try to have sex since because I wasn&#39;t sufficiently healed until the pandemic started. And it feels irresponsible to try right now what with a deadly virus going around. So I can&#39;t comment on how much additional lube would be needed.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m able to use the big orange dialator down to the middle of the thumb notch so somewhere on the 7-8&#34; depth but I honestly don&#39;t recall which number, either is fine by me.
</p>
<p>
Overall I&#39;m quite satisfied with the result. I would consider it successful.

Choose you surgeon very carefully and you can greatly reduce your chances of that happening.

I literally can&#39;t. Because a) I don&#39;t have the money to seek surgeons abroad, b) the way things work in this country I will be assigned a surgeon when that time comes and I have no say who it is. Even the consultation might be done by a different surgeon than the one actually doing the operation.

I live in the UK so most likely would go with NHS UK surgeons if I went ahead with it. If anyone has complication rates etc for these surgeons that would be helpful :)

I had many complications. Still unable to have vaginal penetration. I speak openly about complications on my YouTube channel Shape Shifter. Try to get therapy. Srs may or may not help you. But botched vagina is worth than functional penis. I would wait till medicine progresses further.

At the time I went to him. He was not problematic according to online reviews but turned out Susan&#39;s org was removing posts about him and some other surgeons.

I was mainly pointing out you don‚Äôt need to wait for medicine to improve. The good surgeons have a vastly better success rate. There‚Äôs still some chance of something bad happening, but it‚Äôs a more acceptable risk for most of us.
</p>
<p>
Susans is a danger to the trans community with some of their practices, and this is one of the reasons I don‚Äôt support censoring posts here. Same goes for discussions on hrt and diy. Fortunately it‚Äôs not really relevant any more and not many people use it as their only source of information.
</p>
<p>
I made the wiki to make it easier for people to do their research on surgeons, but a lot of people still don‚Äôt find it, or don‚Äôt look. There‚Äôs also bubbles of information on internet, YouTuber‚Äôs never refer to reddit resources, Facebook rarely does, and everything on Facebook is hidden from outside and barely searchable from inside.

Susans might have done some good in the beginning but now it is toxic place that is doing more damage with sensoring reviews and posts. Some older trans women who have been botched by my surgeon before me posted on susans but their posts got moderated. Those posts could have saved my me from lots of emotional and physical pain.

I have been to bluebond, dr ting, mass general, dr alter, Meltzer.  Nobody wants to work on me. Dr alter says that only dr schechter can save me. But he has been getting bad rep recently so I am scared.  My case is too complicated even for &#34;good&#34; surgeons. Right now i am considering the &#34;russian&#34; surgeon in Syracuse.

Yeah, you‚Äôre in a really difficult situation. There‚Äôs so little information about surgeons who do this kind of work that it‚Äôs highly risky. I‚Äôd definitely stay away from Schecter.
</p>
<p>
The absence of complaints about surgeons doesn‚Äôt mean anything if you can‚Äôt find lots of positive stories about them. Probably just means they don‚Äôt have much experience.
</p>
<p>
I think it might be safer to put this aside for a while and hope things change. There are lots of changes happening with surgeons these days and it might be different in 5 years.

I know you pretty much rule this sub reddit. Have you heard anything about Dr Nikolavsky Dmitriy in Syracuse? Thank you i had video chat with him and really liked him. He is looking into possibly taking on my case.

I added a bit more about him to the wiki.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_dmitriy_nikolavsky" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_dmitriy_nikolavsky
</a>
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s basically nothing about him from the trans community, and few patient reviews anywhere else either. I&#39;d guess he&#39;s relatively new to the trans field - there&#39;s heaps of those recently. They usually publish a few papers or articles to get themselves started (not sure why).
</p>
<p>
Personally I think he&#39;s very risky as there&#39;s no way to check up on him. Qualifications alone mean little when it comes to this.
</p>
<p>
Just to be clear, I don&#39;t know anything about medicine. I&#39;m just good at finding stuff and writing it down.

I don&#39;t think its exactly helpful. I&#39;d wait if you can.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d also suggest you get together with the others who have these problems and see if you can help each other. I think there&#39;s a few around, but they come and go online since they are in such a small minority.

You saw Ting at Mt Sinai.. Im surprised he didn&#39;t refer you to the urologist there.. Dr Purohit or Dr Miro from Serbia. They seem to do a lot of revisions..
</p>
<p>
Worth talking to Miro, he has said he&#39;s fixed colon before.. But I know your probably tired of these consults..

I am extremely tired being bounced around between consults. Dr ting just referred me to Dr Zhao and he works with Bluebond. That team was not very helpful. They made me feel like lost cause and I should just give up period.

Doesn&#39;t look like they are investing as much in improving science for this.. Still doing Penile Inversion and skin graft...   They still haven&#39;t come up with medical devices to keep vagina open instead still use plastic dialators to manually strectch it..

Preach girl. We are in stone age whrn it comes to srs. But most of community is too delusional to see that. I was desperate and delusional and still paying the price.

The satisfaction rate is very high, somewhere in the mid 90&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
Whether you will be satisfied is another subject.  I had SRS happy if it was gone.  I didn&#39;t care about anything else.
</p>
<p>
Now I tend to care a lot bc my Dr was like, amazing and I&#39;m paranoid about it being perfect.  But it will be, I&#39;m very happy

My SRS was one of the most important events in my life. Doctors and therapists wisely try to downplay expectations going into it, but it can be one of the most transformative (mentally and physically) experiences. Being able to lie on the beach in a bikini and feel a complete sense of freedom. Yes it was worth it.

‚ÄúNot sure if the risks or SRS are worth it‚Äù. Mmmmm If you are able to ask the question then in your case, IMHO they are not. Why take risks, go through the long recovery and the pain.  But maybe one day your dysphoria will overwhelm you and the risks will become insignificant.  I‚Äôm 15 days post op and my dysphoria became so bad that I had no option. Even having major surgery in these dangerous times of Covid.  Wish you the best xx
