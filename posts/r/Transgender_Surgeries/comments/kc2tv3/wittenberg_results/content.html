I’m scheduled with Wittenberg next year and I’ve just been back and forth on her or going to Thailand for Chettawut. All the results I see of hers there is very little labia minora and a lot of scrotal tissue used for the majora with a lot of scarring comparatively. I chose her specifically because she provides ppt. Has anyone had surgery with her and retained prominent inner labia with out everything being practically hidden? Does she use penile tissue for the labia or does she just do what other doctors do and sew up scrotal tissue from the outter labia?

I can&#39;t answer your question specifically but I went to Chet and when I went to see my local doctor a few months post surgery she couldn&#39;t see any labia minora, clitoral hood or a clitoris (I can orgasm but I can&#39;t feel what should be a clitoris) and she couldn&#39;t identify where my urethra was. My labia majora are also pretty meh. Chet said everything looked good when I had my final appointment so I don&#39;t trust him in the slightest.
</p>
<p>
So my advice would be to go with Wittenberg. I would have preferred to have gone to an American surgeon as I feel that&#39;s where the best results are but as I don&#39;t live in the US and had no insurance I had to pay for the surgery out of my own pocket and American surgeons were too expensive for me to afford.

I went with Chet and had none of these problems. The urethra is located at the entrance of the vagina. Clit is definitely there. Hood also. Labia minora are on the smaller side but clearly visible when closed. Chet is not the most truthful surgeon but he is a skilled craftsman. It heavily depends on the amount of tissue you are bringing in to surgery.

Well I&#39;m glad you are happy with your surgery, I had a reasonable amount of material so it&#39;s not just dependent on that. Some people get reasonable results and some don&#39;t. Many of the American surgeons seem to give better results and have easier dilation requirements.

The non penile inversion requires more thorough dilation. I cant access the rate of good outcomes for either. There are many factors at play here. I dont want to belittle you. You and your experience is valid.

It does require more dilation, which is why I&#39;d have preferred peritoneal which is what I would have chosen if I&#39;d had the money. I will agree that Chet is capable of a skilled result but unfortunately he isn&#39;t consistent in his results maybe if I&#39;d had surgery the following day I&#39;d have got him on a better day but sadly I just need to live with what I have.

I hear that PPT too requires much dilation during the healing period. Granulation tissue at the back seems to be a recurring problem as well as a lack of girth at the start. It has its pros and cons.

Of course, there are always pros and cons but it seems from the current evidence that PPT has more pros than cons when compared to penile or non penile inversion. The biggest con is the price.

Well you can only go with what&#39;s possible. I&#39;m going to see what kind of revision Chet can do once the plague thing passes.

Chet has become old. I think that this is the main reason for the inconsistency of his results nowadays. That and he takes in too many patients at the same time.

Not a lot for results Wittenberg does 100 GRS surgeries a year roughly and there are like 3 accounts of her work on Reddit.

Yeah I have friends that have the same insurance already trying it and have not gotten approval us insurance is like that. Again though I want ppt and banks does not offer it. So... it’s a mute point

They don’t offer the best depth? Sensation is debatable as penile tissue is used by Wittenberg for labia minora and clitoral hood. Ppt gives you best depth, far less maintenance, and self lubrication. Banks probably has the best aesthetic though yes. Ppt doesn’t off any internal sensation which is acceptable to me. Natal vaginas are typically not sensitive either.

I have Wittenberg May 4. I’m going to her for now and thenll do a revision. Wittenberg results always has noticeable incision marks which I’m worried about but I’m hoping I can reduce them enough to be stealth
