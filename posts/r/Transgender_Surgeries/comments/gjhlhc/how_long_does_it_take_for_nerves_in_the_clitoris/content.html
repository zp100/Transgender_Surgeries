I had sensation there at my one-week follow-up (when they remove the catheter and packing). The doctor was inspecting the area and when he touched my clit, I definitely knew it!
</p>
<p>
It took me 13 months to achieve orgasm. While part of it was sensitivity, a lot (if not most) of it was learning how my body worked and how to get there. It takes me a lot more mental preparation than before - I definitely have to be in the right mental space or nothing is going to happen.

I&#39;m 7 months post op and having some of the best orgasms of my life but I guess it depends on your surgeon, your anatomy, how well you heal.

I&#39;m 6 months post op and still not reliably orgasmic, though it&#39;s close. I also have other complications that are impacting things though. I did manage an orgasm at 2 months post op, but it hurt.

At a little over 6 months currently, still difficult but mind blowing and unlike any other time before, when I can get there. Really only have twice now, and the first was at 3 months. Iâ€™m not in a hurry though, and mostly everything had feeling within like a month or so. Still have a couple small patches of numbness on my labia and pubic mound but theyâ€™re shrinking.

I&#39;m still regaining sensitivity at 7 months post op. I can only orgasm if I use a Hitachi , though. Direct touch doesn&#39;t necessarily feel erogenous. At first it was pretty numb and that worried me and I couldn&#39;t achieve any pleasure. At about 5 months, though, I revisited the hitachi and was able to climax.

Well lets say I disregarded my surgeons advice to not masturbate before 3 months past surgery. I had full sensations day 1 after the bandages were removed. It became too tempting after 2 months *shame on me* I was lucky it didn&#39;t cause any harm.
