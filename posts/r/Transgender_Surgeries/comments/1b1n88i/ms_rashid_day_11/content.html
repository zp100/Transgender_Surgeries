It looks like it is healing very nicely!
</p>
<p>
I have been wanting to ask this so I hope this isn&#39;t rude/wrong place, but why is she called Miss Tina Rashid and not doctor?  I tried to find this answer myself, but was unsuccessful.   She is a licensed surgeon so I&#39;m just really curious why she doesn&#39;t go by doctor. TIA!

In the UK surgeons go by regular titles than by â€˜Drâ€™, they are qualified doctors and are entitled to use that title, but it is more a custom to go by a normal title :)

Iâ€™m guessing youâ€™re aware, but are you treating your dehiscence? And Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re feeling good!

Yup I got in touch with Dana about it and said to use manuka honey on it for now which I have started to do today.
</p>
<p>
They never told me just how uncomfortable dehiscence can be lol ðŸ˜‚.

Thatâ€™s good to hear, also be liberal with how much youâ€™re applying I do three pea sizes drops as opposed to just one! Is yours quite sore then? Fortunately mine hasnâ€™t given me any grief pain wise because itâ€™s somewhat internal

Not noticing any massive amounts internally yet ,slight bleed now and again but usually clear on extraction for now. The bottom part is my own fault I know it is as I had no choice but to walk through London up and down stairs and get trains to get home that day, causing the issue and changing myself raw .
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s more uncomfortable than pain but every time I pee it&#39;s like I&#39;m steam cleaning it every time .
</p>
<p>
Still haven&#39;t seen my neo clit, or spread the labia to look really as mix of numb and uncomfortable sensation still .
