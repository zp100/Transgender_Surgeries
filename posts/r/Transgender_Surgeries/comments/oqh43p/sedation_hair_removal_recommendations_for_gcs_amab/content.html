Hi all,
</p>
<p>
I have GCS scheduled for early December and live in the Greater Seattle Area. I have been having a hard time with hair removal on my penis. The problems are two fold, the first is that the only place that I found which does a numbing block has very few appointments. Without a block I can withstand it but things are slow going. The second is that I&#39;m running out of time.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m wondering if anyone has good or bad experiences with sedation hair removal. I found three places, but I&#39;m sure there are more:

heya, I&#39;ve been going to Precision and I highly recomend it. it&#39;s much, much faster than doing it without numbing and the techs are extremely efficient. I wrote about my experience
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/comments/oe5fvi/im_learning_so_many_new_horrifying_things/h45fjwi/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
. I should also say, the lidocaine injections are themselves excruciating, if brief - though, I didn&#39;t realize just how painful
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrollXChromosomes/comments/opzuo9/trolls_please_have_a_look_at_this_graph_for_a/h69qcqc/" rel="nofollow">until earlier today
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had 3 sessions so far for my face and genitals and will probably only go back for one more - doesn&#39;t make sense to fly there and pay nearly 2k for numbing when the total time to a full clear gets to 1-2 hrs. I&#39;ll just have to bear the pain for the last few cycles of hair on my face. my surgery is scheduled for Sept. 30th and I&#39;m having PPT so I&#39;m not super worried about getting the bits down there totally clear - I&#39;m past the 80% clear point already and the surgeon will scrape the hair follicles on the rest.
</p>
<p>
in all, this process has somehow managed to be cheaper than the traditional method - mainly because they&#39;re able to clear so much so fast. it took 10 sessions for regular electrolysis to clear half my chin once, by way of comparison (probably because I&#39;m in too much pain to hold perfectly still through it) - one full clear would likely have taken closer to 100 hours at that pace.
</p>
<p>
so yeah, happy to answer any questions.

Found this while looking about my upcoming appointment. Did you opt for the Lymphatic Drainage Recovery Treatment ($195) or wish you had? Any other advice? I can&#39;t believe I have to dye me hair down there ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜³ Thanks!!

You need at least a year. I strongly suggest moving your surgery date. I know one person who thought she could get it done in an accelerated timeframe by visiting one of the places above, and she now has intravaginal hair growth.

Also, you donâ€™t have enough time to do it properly. You need at least a year of clearances.

Thanks, I was hoping to hear a bit about people&#39;s experiences beyond the list of places in the Wiki which I had previously reviewed, but it never hurts to be pointed back to the list.
</p>
<p>
As for timing to do it right, I started last December and am about 10 or 15 hours in thus far. Just hoping to speed it up a bit.

Due to the growth cycles you have to have cleared it each time over the course of a year. If you miss any hairs they will be back a year later.
