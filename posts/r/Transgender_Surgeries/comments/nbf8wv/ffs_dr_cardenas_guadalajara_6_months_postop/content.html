Because I don‚Äòt want to answer everyone individually I will do it this way: I decided to go to Mexico bc I‚Äòm essentially broke and unemployed (or in training respectively). My boyfriend took a loan for me. I tried to save up money myself, did some camming but the money wasn‚Äòt coming in fast enough so I asked my boyfriend. I was waiting for this surgery for over 10 years and I decided I couldn‚Äòt wait any longer. The total cost of the surgery (including) the recovery house was around 12.000 dollars (10.5 k Euros). I‚Äòm from Germany. Dr. Cardenas has a lot of reputation, is a member of the network of american plastic and cosmetic surgeons and was really nice. I don‚Äòt speak spanish but the trip was doable. Not a lot of people speak English in Mexico but some do and that‚Äòs the way I communicated. I dunno why y‚Äòall think Mexico is shady or anything: Guadalajara is one of the biggest heath care centers in the world, with a lot of doctors everywhere. Don‚Äòt be afraid. The surgery was a full success. I only have  some numbness in my scalp, no problem for me anyway. The people in the recovery house were amazing. They had doggies and a big garden and buns every morning. üòçBe sure to take some more money with you bc you need to buy some medicine for around 100 dollars after surgery. I could walk on the first day and be pretty active on the 4th and fit on the 10th. I had a little problem in the hospital (couldn‚Äôt pee) but they took care of it. Mexico is extremely beautiful, unlike Germany it‚Äòs so sunny, warm and colorful. I can highly recommend FFS and Dr. Cardenas. The surgery changed my life. I looked pretty femme before and would pass 100 percent as female but looking in the mirror was very hard for me everyday. I‚Äòm now totally in love with my body and have only a little bit of dysphoria. Hope this helps some of you! üòò

<p>
There are plenty of parts of Mexico (mostly near the border with the US, because of both drug wars, and illegal border runners) that are really, really shady.
</p>
<p>
There are also parts that are really nice.
</p>
<p>
And thanks for the review!

Can you post a review (if you haven&#39;t already) of your experience in going to Mexico for surgery?  Assuming you went there from some other country, that is.

The thought of going to mexico for FFS is scary but your results are obviously amazing and im super jelly!
</p>
<p>
What made you decide on him as being safe and reputable? (May or may not use this information to consider going there myself :P )

Hi, not OP but I ended up going to Dr. Cardenas as well, and am fairly happy with my results. I&#39;ve seen several posts and reviews going back a couple of years, so I figured they were reputable and safe to go to.
</p>
<p>
The TransOp team organized all of the local transportation, lodging, and food for the trip. They set me up in a private apartment/hotel for the first couple days during consults and pre-surgical testing, and I stayed at their &#34;recovery house&#34; post-op with several other patients. It&#39;s an optional add-on to their surgical package that does cost a little bit more than doing it all yourself, but I thought it was worth it since I was going alone and wasn&#39;t fluent in Spanish.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;d like, I can PM you some more details or pictures of the area and accomodations, or just answer any other questions you had!

The pricing on their website
<a href="https://transop.com/" rel="nofollow">https://transop.com/
</a>
ended up all being accurate to what I paid, I think the only other costs were the flights and an overnight hospital stay.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll PM you with some more details too

Great results! I love that while you didn‚Äôt get rhino, your alterations changed the look as if you did (and I mean this in a compliment as I‚Äôm totally unsure of doing anything to my nose when the time comes...) I‚Äôve been seeing more of Dr. Cardenas‚Äô work lately and if I didn‚Äôt have to rely on insurance he would definitely be in my top 3 choices

The alteration in the appearance of the nose comes from the lack of brow bossing now. Gives you this Cleopatra look and that makes your nose appear smaller. :)

Great profile....and I appreciate your sharing your experience with a Mexican surgeon. Yet, I see NOTHING here about which procedure/s you had done. Apparently gender reassignment. BTW...your comment about &#34;growing into a gender&#34; was MUCH appreciated...and seemed to show great wisdom (and I find myself &#34;resonating&#34; with that comment. I&#39;ve been (AMAB) increasingly identifying with the female gender...but STILL value SOME aspects...which I associate with the male gender...such as my &#34;announcer voice&#34; and being able to confront certain situations (and people)....so this is MUCH more complicated than (apparently) many people comprehend.
</p>
<p>
Oh, I&#39;ve perused  a bunch of your photos...and you strike me as a very beautiful female. Congrats!!
</p>
<p>
May we assume you&#39;ve been on HRT for SOMETIME?

Hmm but isnt it better if he knows how much he can take? I wouldnt want him to feel it out during surgery but rather to have a clear plan of what is possible

I hope this isn&#39;t a Thing, but I really love that there wasn&#39;t a lot of overdoing the nose. Like, people have noses of all shapes and it&#39;s a bit discouraging to see every nose looking the same. That&#39;s been a concern when looking at FFS for me - my face has personality, leave it. I like my aquiline nose. I just don&#39;t like other parts!

Yes, you are right. Because the nose(and the ears too) give the face character, any deviations or very ‚Äûartificially‚Äú looking results will stick out like a sore thumb. From what I have heard his nose jobs are great but I didn‚Äòt have one so I can‚Äòt tell.
