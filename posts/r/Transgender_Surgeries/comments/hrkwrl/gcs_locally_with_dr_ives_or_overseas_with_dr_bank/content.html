If you&#39;ve seen photos Ives does not come close to Bank/Suporn with regards to how close it looks to cis vaginas. Suporn uses the non-inversion &#34;Chonburi-flap&#34; method compared to the old fashioned penile inversion that Ives uses. It&#39;s a far more sophisticated technique and the recovery is much longer but the end result is incomparable. You can go online and look at photos from their websites. Night and day. Ives is missing half of the female anatomy (no labia minora, no clitoral frenulum) plus he typically achieves a less depth especially if you have a small penis, which I do.

I&#39;m from Sydney, booked in with Bank rn.

I think it&#39;s also good to remember that Suporn has dedicated his whole life to SRS.. for Ives it&#39;s practically a passing interest.
</p>
<p>
Also, I went to a Thai hospital as an exchange student (coincidentally the hospital which Bank trained at before he went to work with Suporn.) The quality of healthcare in Thailand is top notch if you have the money.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Here is a comparison of Ives (first) Suporn (second) and a cis vagina from Wikipedia (third). I literally can&#39;t tell the difference between Suporn and the cis vagina.

I concur with you. I also did a placement at Chularlongkorn and have seen the difference between Ives vs Suporn vs Chettawut vaginas... Unfortunate I missed out the chance to observe an actual vaginoplasty. From the Ives vagina (penile inversion) I’ve seen in real life, the skin edges weren’t done very well and hence the scar tissue didn’t appear neat (lumpy scrotum tissue sutured to smooth skin around penile tissue - you have to invert penile skin and drag it down and in, pulling the skin around “penis” to form labia majora). Both Suporn and chettawut have better suture jobs just from the vaginas I’ve seen. Their sutures were smooth skin to smooth skin where possible. And where scrotal tissue is sutured to scrotal tissue, it tends to be well hidden - labia commissure. I can’t say this applies to everyone but just purely from the vaginas I’ve examined in real life. Medicare doesn’t cover overseas surgery - but if you have super and really need the money for your surgeries, you can ask for an early release.

I&#39;m not going to comment on the quality of the surgery as pictures tell a thousand words and others have made good arguments. What I will say us that I have been to Thailand numerous times and like most Asian developing counties it is a land of stark contrasts.  The level of health care you receive from the clinic that Dr Banks works out of is second to none to those in Australia. English is not an issue and the food is to die for (Sorry that might just be me). I personally would have no issue with having any surgery in Thailand at one of these clinics and recovery in such a idyllic setting sure bets Melbourne, especially given recent events.

I feel like spicy food whilst recovering from GCS may be a questionable decision.
</p>
<p>
I see you&#39;ve booked in with Bank, do you know if Kieran Hart is comparable?
</p>
<p>
How much are you paying for Bank?

Could you post a review of Hart after your surgery? There’s not much in him.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
which is a critique I&#39;ve heard of the Suporn Clinic (poor aftercare despite the surgery itself being great)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think you may be confusing that with someone else.

When did you book? How long is his wait list currently? Also, where do I contact to start the process of getting a consultation with him, I couldn&#39;t find anything pertaining to contacting him for GCS, everything I found was about his general urological work.
</p>
<p>
Do you know if he does the same method as Suporn/Bank?
</p>
<p>
How much are you expecting to pay and how much of that do you get back on Medicare / Health Insurance? I don&#39;t have hospital cover currently and I think it&#39;s a year wait list for the parts that cover surgery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had it mentioned by my GP (trans herself) that there&#39;s less info on PPT long term and some case reports recently of issues related specifically to that method. She basically gave the advice that PPT is too new currently and to stick with the Suporn/Bank method. I&#39;ve also read that it&#39;s possible to have a revision done after the original surgery to change the lining over to peritoneal tissue if I change my mind in the future or whatever. What&#39;s your reasoning for PPT vs other methods?
</p>
<p>
She herself went to Suporn/Bank for reference.
</p>
<p>
Up until now that Kieran Hart is becoming more prominent, I was looking towards Chettawut personally however lots of factors including price, familiarity, convenience, etc. Are pushing me towards Hart. I didn&#39;t think Ives was comparable in his work but Hart seems to tick all the boxes.

You&#39;re not going to get the easy answer you&#39;re looking for. Unless the surgeon is really bad you&#39;re going to find people speaking up for both surgeons. There&#39;s little consensus and few objective facts on these things. Personally I like photos so I can judge for myself.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s lots of reviews and post-op photos for these surgeons in the wiki here.

This one is fairly comprehensive for Suporn and will probably answer a lot of your questions.

I&#39;ve not heard of anyone getting Australian insurance to cover Thailand at all. With insurance Andy Ives it&#39;s still going to cost you $17k or so, which is still less than Suporn.
</p>
<p>
Its also not possible to travel to Thailand right now, and its not at all clear when that&#39;s changing. I&#39;ve heard that Thailand is opening up for medical tourism soon, but I don&#39;t know about the Australian side of it.

It might be worth asking in
<a href="/r/transgenderau" rel="nofollow">r/transgenderau
</a>
as well (Disclosure, am mod of said subreddit) as it&#39;s the Transgender Australia group, also Ives has photos of his work up on his website. I plan on Ives.
