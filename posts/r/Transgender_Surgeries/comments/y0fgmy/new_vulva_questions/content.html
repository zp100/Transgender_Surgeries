I went through vulvoplasty 5 days ago and got to see it for a first time. And its kinda ugly. I mean, i love my new boobs and vulva, but eww, ya know? Ofcourse i know its gonna look better after a while, its still recovering, but i do habe one question.
</p>
<p>
Why are my labia hard? I always thought they were soft like normal body stuff, but it feels hard as an erection rn. Why? Is it normal or no and if not what do i do
</p>

You just had surgery. It&#39;s swollen, that&#39;s why it&#39;s hard, and of course it looks nothing like it will over time at this point. Don&#39;t worry about it.

This. There will be a lot of swelling for a while and it should get much softer as you go. It&#39;s totally normal to think it looks gross right after surgery. Honestly, I think that surgeons should make a point to explain this before operating and before removing bandages and packing, in order to prepare folks for the initial appearance.
</p>
<p>
TLDR; it&#39;s more than likely that you&#39;re  just swollen and your vulva will be beautiful and everything will be excellent.
</p>
<p>
Side note: once you&#39;re all healed and you are happy with your vulva, anyone who doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s nice doesn&#39;t deserve to be anywhere near it.

Can confirm, I am one year today and how I look down there now is so much better than how it looked whe  bandages first came off.  You&#39;ve just gone through major surgery your body is going to take a long time to recover.. it look me a good six months to fully recover.

45 days ago? It‚Äôs normal to be swollen for months but by that time a lot of blood is unusual and if shouldn‚Äôt feel like an ‚Äúerection.‚Äù Labia should indeed be soft. I‚Äôve never even heard of that doctor so it‚Äôs hard to know what may be going on.

Oh! In that case yes that‚Äôs relatively normal. Everything is all swollen and the brain is trying to make sense of what happened. Those sensations should fade in the next few weeks.

I have no idea. They didn‚Äôt do that to me. Again, I have no idea who this doctor is and have never heard of them. I had my surgery in the US.

Insurance paid for mine as well. It also paid for my breasts. They didn‚Äôt sew my butt together though. I‚Äôd really ask your surgeon about that. Maybe to keep the tension off?

Swelling. My left lab was rock hard but it&#39;s softening up esp towards the front although there is still a hard lump left of vagina. I was impatient too (see profile), yours will sort itself out. Get some ice on it (max 30 mins on, then 3 hours off, and not direct on skin) and massage it daily with moderate pressure. I am resigned to the fact that it will probably be a year before I see my final result swelling can take a long time to go down.

Your labia are swollen for a number of reasons - they will be more swollen if your doctor opted to not tube you on either side of your ischial tuberosities
</p>
<p>
The second being that you‚Äôre 5 days post op and your body is working overtime to heal itself. You‚Äôll be fine. They‚Äôll be larger and hard for weeks. If not months. Then they will start to flatten out and take better shape. Around your 6 week post op appointment you‚Äôll be told to start massaging them and your stitch lines. Mine were looking hella thicc for months. Then one day it all just stopped.
</p>
<p>
Also. Starting in a couple days - use ice packs. 5 minutes on, 20 minutes off - gradually increasing time of ice on as you regain feeling and the days pass.
</p>
<p>
Be careful of ice burns in the meantime since you don‚Äôt have as much feeling as you might think you do currently.

6 weeks and 12 weeks.  Those felt like significant stages where the end result started to emerge.  At 5 days your body is still lying on the front line of an active war zone.  Be patient.

Can you name your surgeon? It sounds like they didn‚Äôt remove enough of the erectile tissue if the labia feels like an erection. That could be fixed with a revision. Idk what you specifically mean by ‚Äúugly‚Äù and ‚Äúeww‚Äù though ‚Äî would need more info to understand. Its still a surgical site at 45 days so is the ew from that or something else?

I had my vaginoplasty back in May with Dr. Laungani - my labia were still fairly &#34;hard&#34; at that point in my recovery (5 days in) but it&#39;s gotten much better over time now that the swelling has gone down significantly. As for sewing your butt cheeks together, he didn&#39;t really do that for me, albeit that compressive dressing I had did go down past my vagina, but I just attributed that to the healing process and never really questioned it as it was removed that week.
