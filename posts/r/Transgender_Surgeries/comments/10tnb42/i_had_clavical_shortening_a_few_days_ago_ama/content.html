I had Should narrowing surgery with Dr. Rogers recently. I am not posting pictures atm, but I can discuss the technique used and recovery if anyone is curious. It&#39;s a new cosmetic surgery, but its come a long way in the past few years. The initial results have been excellent.

<p>
How has recovery been so far?

I can’t remember the full cost out of pocket. I managed to appeal insurance to cover the costs so for me it is only the co pay.
</p>
<p>
There is little risk for lack of movement. Leif Rogers has a really really low complication rate. The only two complications came for personal injury and strenuous activity after surgery. Which to be fair, I can see how it would be easy to do. It’s not very painful after a couple days, so  accidentally lifting something or pushing against something might mistakenly happen. You can’t carry or lift anything over 10 pounds for 6 weeks.
</p>
<p>
He doesn’t use plates anymore, so the hardware only consists of one screw for each side. Recovery is uncomfortable but no harder than BA. (Probably a little easier for me). Which came with roughly the same 6 weeks of no are activity restrictions.

Thank you so much for letting us know all this info! I did not know that it was even possible for an insurance company to cover it!

I used BCBS and filed it under chest reconstruction and body contouring (both offered under my current plan). It worked, but it required an appeal and the help of my pcp and Leif rogers office staff. I was told by staff That quite a few of their patients did use insurance.

One bolt for each side. It’s inserted through the back of the shoulders and run through the collarbone itself. I’ll know for sure when I get X-rays.

This post is old, but for documentation purposes I had a consult with Dr Rogers and he still does plates. What he told me is he will attempt to use just a titanium screw, but if your bone marrow is too wide he will use a plate.
</p>
<p>
This is determined at surgery so there is no way to control this. However, he said he can remove the plate after the fracture healed.

I would really like to before and after side and three quarter view photos of this surgery. There is some degree of forward roll of the shoulders but no one ever shows those angles so it’s impossible to judge how significant it is.

Thank you for posting about clavical shortening surgery! I wish you could share pictures in the future. So far I read all the comments and your responses, it is indeed very interesting. My shoulders give me quite serious dysphoria but I am afraid about the possible side effects or lose of movement after this surgery.

I’ll be sure to update in the future. Like any surgery I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone unless it’s addressing major dysphoria. I am not active in sport or lifting so it won’t impact my life in any way. It’s really about weighing the pros and cons. For me it was the right decision.

Does it affect your posture at all? Referring to the direction of the scapula and if it shortening in the front would make your back bow inwards at all

I can’t notice it on me as of yet. My posture does seem around the same. However, It was something I knew going into it. The Dr mentioned that he try’s to avoid this and limits the bone removed to mitigate it. I know he is a little less aggressive then say, epply who give thinner results but more hunched shoulder look.
</p>
<p>
As of now I’d say I don’t have any noticeable change but swelling may be hiding it. If I did it wouldn’t bother me as I prefer the look over the square nature of my old shoulders. I think it’s going to really depend on your previous structure and how aggressive you choose to be.

It&#39;s kind of you to do this but it&#39;s a visual medium. If you do feel like sharing anonymous before/afters, then that would really help convey understanding. An endorsement without proof can seem dubious.
</p>
<p>
As is, what were your measurements before/after? : )

WHEW, this sounds pretty radical. No bad outcomes, expected---according to the surgeon? Please keep us posted. I&#39;m asking both as a trans person...and as a medical practitioner.

Yeah there are definitely pros and cons. And there has been complications, my wording came across wrong there, but nothing that wasn’t corrected. I think radical is a good word because It’s new, and comes with unknown long term risks, so I definitely don’t think people should take it lightly. For me the decision came down to talking with others who had it and weighing the complications from those that had them. I think from my perspective it’s no more radical than ffs or grs. I’ll definitely keep updates. It should also be noted that it is not major change, but subtle.

Imperfect healing of the bone or dislocation of the bolts by injury. From what I am told this usually the result of injury while healing. Although there is always a chance that the bones don’t heal and fuse. If you’ve ever had a bone break or repair it’s always a risk that can happen. There is also possibility of posture change or range of motion impact. This is mitigated by limiting the bone removed. How much can be removed will depend on the patient.
