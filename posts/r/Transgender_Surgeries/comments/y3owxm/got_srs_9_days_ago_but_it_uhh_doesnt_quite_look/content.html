9 days is too early love to really be able to tell anything. If it still looks like this in 3-4 months, you can start inquiring about a revision at months 6-12.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn’t stress too much right now. It’s impossible to know what is surgical, and what is edema

You&#39;re right. I kept trying to tell myself that too, but with the recovery and dilation I was looking at it so much and kinda starting to worry myself to death about it. This post really helped to talk it through with some people and put myself a little at ease

Girl. I did the same exact thing. I was convinced I didn’t have a clit for like 2 months

So, as the title said, I&#39;m very worried about the clitoral area. Looks like the surgeon took nearly the entire head and just put it there, with some other bits where I&#39;m not even sure what they&#39;re supposed to be. When I first saw it I was too busy being happy that at least it wasn&#39;t a bloody mess. I also kind of hoped that maybe it was normal to look like that this early on, and it would just fit into place once swelling went down. After looking around a bit on this sub for other pics of around this time though, I&#39;ve yet to find any where the neovag looks anything remotely like this, so uhhhh..... I&#39;ve been getting more and more worried

A Mrs. Tempelman in the Netherlands, I believe. It&#39;s all through insurance and the Dutch system, so I was not in a situation to shop around

There’s a lot of swelling obviously, but I’d guess you’ll be wanting a revision eventually. The good thing is it looks like excess tissue rather than too little so should be straightforward.

Yeah, you&#39;re probably right. Guess I&#39;ll discuss it a bit at my next check-up. Revisions are the sort of thing that can only happen like 6 months minimum after surgery, right? Once everything has calmed down somewhat?

Turns out there&#39;s a lot of things surgeons don’t bother telling their patients that would be beneficial. This sub is full of them. Using ice or cold compresses to reduce  inflamation (Swelling) should be provided as common post-op instructions, even if it&#39;s only an option with caveats. The main concern is existing numbness. If you can&#39;t feel the cold you risk overesposing the tissue to damage. It&#39;s fairly easy to avoid this problem with skin barriers and timed ice sessions.

Can confirm, I accidentally frostbit part of my pubic mound above the surgical site. That cold pack was too effective; I put a fresh cold pack on too fast after removing the previous one. Thankfully had minimal damage; most of the effected skin just flaked off over the following week. I have a better idea of how much cold is enough.

Also don&#39;t put cold / ice packs directly on your skin. There should be at least a little fabric in between you and the cold. Something like a t-shirt or a cloth hand towel.

Interesting, so what do you do with the ice pack, you just hold it against the area? How long for?

Pro tip. Buy 2 bags of frozen peas. What is great with that, it adapts to your morphology. Don’t put them directly on your skin, put a towel between your body and the bags. And voila! It helped a lot. The first few weeks I did it 15 minutes before and after each dilations.

My surgeon recommended ice 24/7.  Make sure to wrap the ice packs in a towel to prevent injury.

You&#39;re swollen and the clit tends to atrophy after surgery anyway. Rest, elevate, and put some ice on. Hopefully everything turns out alright.

First obviously swelling and much too early, two typically they error on bigger because they tend atrophy, three better bigger and what typically easy/small revision than to go too small, four at least I know with my surgeon the clit itself usually callous over for abit. It&#39;s only now in month 4 or 5 that actually got clearer picture of where and what my clit is. I&#39;m actually going back see my surgeon on Monday cause after my 2nd bath at 22nd week(depression, fear I avoided bath after my 14 week experience due to sloughing) I could see what I think is separation on my clit from below. It&#39;s probably little too small and I know my surgeon errors on bigger side intentionally she&#39;s very upfront about that. Sensation in my case is too much so I&#39;m okay there. We shall see..
</p>
<p>
Point is 9 days way too soon for much judgement of anything. Everything just looks a mess honestly avoided looking too much at my vagina until like maybe 3 weeks ago. I dilate and unless I feel discomfort somewhere that might call for attention I avoided her. Just bath in not having what was there before has been my mentality. Not  much point in stressing over things when your still swollen.. and yes your swollen even when you don&#39;t think you are.

Mine was pretty large too but eventually it kind of meshes together with your labia and it’s a normal size lol. It took me a few months to feel like my clit looked normal
