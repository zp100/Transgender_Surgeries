You look so fabulous. I have 2 weeks 6 days till my surgery with. This + fat grafting is what I&#39;m getting done by him as well. I&#39;m sooo excited. I&#39;m so happy for you. Do you have any thoughts or advice on aftercare or anything ?

Oh yayy!!! So excited for you! You’re gonna love your results. Main thing for aftercare, make sure you have someone you trust to take care of you for the first week. Even better if they can stay with you another week. I’d say when you’re at 2 weeks, you start to feel like your old self in terms of energy and general capability.

I don’t feel comfortable posting that info. He’s def more than your standard FFS doc but IMO it’s worth the premium.

3 years ago I was making less than 20k a year and realized I’d never ever be able to afford Deschamps, much less any other surgeon. I changed careers. Now I code and more things are possible than ever. Consider making a change to your career path if you want to get out too.

This is a somewhat odd question, but I&#39;m currently thinking about how to revamp my eyebrows :). There&#39;s something different about the eyebrows in the two pictures, and the after one looks really really good. Did you change your plucking / grooming technique? Or is that from the change in contouring / surface area?
</p>
<p>
Also, any thoughts on how you chose Deschamps-Braly?

So I was told not to pluck my eyebrows for 6 weeks prior to surgery. They never looked good unless I plucked them back when I had a prominent brow ridge. And so leading up to the surgery, they just looked terrible. As soon as I woke up from surgery and saw them laying flat and full, they were fucking gorgeous! I couldn’t stop staring at them. And now I’m keeping them this full, aside from a very minor shaping when I’m more healed.
</p>
<p>
I consulted with a good handful of FFS docs. Eventually it came down to him and Dr. Harrison Lee. I flew into LA (from SF) in the morning to see him and flew back immediately after the consult. And the actual consult took no more than 45 min total. With him, less than 20min. It was kind of a bare office. Didn’t ask to see xrays or anything. He was quiet and didn’t seem like he wanted me in there much longer. He seemed...indifferent. His coordinator sat with me to discuss pricing, etc and got up to help other people and take calls several times during my time with her.
</p>
<p>
I had already had my consult with Deschamps and it was nearly 2.5-3 hours (xrays/ct scans included). The man probably spent at least 45min to an hour with me discussing everything in great detail. He took me to his patient chair and measured every angle on my face, having his PA take down notes. He made a photoshop rendering of what I wanted for my nose (which he completely delivered on). Lee didn’t even have a computer on his nearly empty wooden desk.
</p>
<p>
As soon as I got out of Lee’s office and was in a cab to the airport, I called Deschamps office to reschedule a follow up consult to talk at more length about stuff but ultimately, it was to write that fucking check.
</p>
<p>
Trust is extremely important. Lee didn’t care to establish it. Deschamp’s did.

Thank you!   Thank you!  This post and your follow up below is some of the most specific and helpful information on understanding the planning of these procedures I have seen anywhere.    In other posts,  people complain about the $300 charge for the consults with him - - but it appears that you got a bargain, given the amount of time and effort he and his office put into your consult there!
</p>
<p>
Minor point, really,  but does he give you a credit for the $300 consult fee and apply that against the charges for the surgery?

Oh good! So glad I could be of any help! Feel free to ask any questions you might have.
</p>
<p>
I don’t recall if the consult fees applied to the surgery. There is an additional 300 that goes directly to a different medical team that does the xrays, ct scans and dental imaging that Deschamps looks at when you have your consult with him. Honestly, it’s so worth it because aside from the print outs for Deschamps to mark down, they give you a CD with all of it on there for you to provide to other doctors for different consultations. Most surgeons don’t require it so it’s extra helpful to be able to show them to get more thorough and confident answers and feedback.

Any FFS surgeon that does not require the facial digital imaging - - should, in my opinion, be rather promptly deemed to be unacceptable as a choice of surgeons.  There are serious or even life threatening and otherwise undetectable risk factors that can only be identified by the imaging - - that need to be known and ruled out or dealt with and planned for - - prior to doing the bone work.
</p>
<p>
I had no idea that some surgeons do NOT require a full set of imaging. Almost unthinkable.

I completely agree. I’m not sure which surgeons do and don’t, but Deschamps was the only surgeon who required it for the consult alone. When I saw Lee, it wasn’t until I offered those same imaging files to his coordinator at the end of the consult did they accept them. But I highly doubt he ever looked at them after I walked out the door. His coordinator laughed at the fact dental imaging was included on the CD and asked me why Deschamps would want those at all. I didn’t know what to say besides “maybe he wanted to be thorough”. I appreciated every bit of thoroughness Dr. D acted on.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I’ll add that I did mention prior to flying out that I had imaging and emailed it to them, but no one printed anything out and Lee didn’t have a computer

How specific or general were your desires going into the consult? Just wondering how prepared I should be before scheduling these.

The first thing I always asked in these consults was “what do you think I need?” before talking about what I thought I needed/bothered me. Over 5 consults, all of them said basically same thing. That helped me decide on what I’d be getting done.
</p>
<p>
As for specifics, Dr. D. said I could come in for a second consult (considering I was going to Lee for my last consideration) to discuss things in more detail. He said to bring in references to better describe what I wanted. I put together a basic PowerPoint for chin, jaw and nose. I completely trusted him on forehead. I only made sure he would be doing orbital rim contouring along with the forehead contouring.
</p>
<p>
For chin, I personally didn’t like seeing pointy chins that I’d seen from some of his (and other doctor’s) results. I have a squarish chin with a slight cleft. He mentioning shaving that down but I said I liked it. I just wanted the width and height to be brought down (basically make it smaller).
</p>
<p>
For jaw, I wanted width gone but I didn’t want to round my corners. He completely agreed and showing him references to Margot Robbies strong jaw corners really helped nail in what I liked about my jaw and how to contour it to fit my chin.
</p>
<p>
As for nose, that one was very difficult. I had pictures of different noses that looked similar to my mom’s and mine. I kind of liked the slight dimples I had near the tip. I also didn’t want him to expand the middle portion. The photoshop render for my profile was perfect on his initial draw. In the end, I knew that my profile was my worst feature so if he could flatten my forehead naturally and straighten out my nose, I’d be happy. My issue was I liked the way the front of my nose looked and didn’t know if I’d lose that “essence”. So I told him to do the profile how he rendered it and try to maintain my smallish look from the front. And he absolutely delivered on that. I couldn’t be happier.
</p>
<p>
I know girls who told Dr D “just do what you do best, I trust you”. That’s not me. I didn’t have a specific image in my mind of what I expected to look like, I only knew what I had problems with and I had strong opinions (it’s my fucking face! Lol) about the direction to take in making things better.

Oh your info here on the orbital rim contouring is really interesting. Since I actually did a virtual consult with him we will be doing the extensive work with the imaging and photoshopping at my pre-op. Do you mind if I ask if orbital contouring was a separate CPT code or you just told him you wanted that done as well? I&#39;m definitely in the like &#34;do what you do best camp&#34; by and large but I am thinking a lot about orbital contouring to open up eyes and wondering what level of aggressiveness I want.

A very important distinction!! He never gave orbital rim contouring it’s own CPT listing! That’s why I asked him about 3-4 times if he was gonna do it haha. Apparently he includes it into the type 3 forehead contouring one. It’s still worth asking to confirm though. I never got into the specifics, just that I wanted it.

Thanks for all those details, it&#39;s so helpful!

<blockquote>
<p>
So I was told not to pluck my eyebrows for 6 weeks prior to surgery. They never looked good unless I plucked them back when I had a prominent brow ridge. And so leading up to the surgery, they just looked terrible. As soon as I woke up from surgery and saw them laying flat and full, they were fucking gorgeous! I couldn’t stop staring at them. And now I’m keeping them this full, aside from a very minor shaping when I’m more healed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is such an interesting detail. I wonder what they did... it&#39;s almost like the skin beneath them is stretched so they&#39;re less dense and spread out a bit?
</p>
<p>
How long did the process take, to get the consult and the surgery date?

I mean it really is as simple as the brow was sitting on the cusp of a hill (my brow) and now they’re laying flat. So they appear different but weren’t modified in any other way than being repositioned.

To answer your last questions. Initially they were able to take me in for a consult within a month (last August) but I wasn’t ready. I was still doing consults and needed more time with my job. I set a consult date for late January and eventually set a surgery day of mid April. It got pushed about 4 times due to covid but ultimately I got in at the end of May, thankfully. It helped that I don’t live far from him.

Part of it is just that they do a brow lift. When you reattach the skin on the forehead after contouring you have to tighten it this does in fact stretch it a bit and like is what a brow lift is generally

Yup. He knows he’s in the top tier of FFS surgeons in the world. Unfortunately, he can’t seem to reconcile his “this is a walk in the park” mentality with the fact this is the most important life altering moment in our lives that we only get one real shot at.

I remember seeing some of the pics in the past and you were stunning, but I didn’t know you could get even more so!!!

I have my first FFS consult in a week, hoping to heal up as fast as you did!!!

Thanks! Bruising wasn’t too severe with me. Though it was mostly on one side of my face. By 5-6 weeks it had all faded.

Nope. I’ve had friends who think Arnica cream (or pills) help but I didn’t put much effort into it. It’s all going to fade away with time. First it’s all black and blue, then it turns yellowish, and then it’s gone. You just gotta wait it out! :)

When I smile, I already show a good deal of teeth. If I were to get the lip lift, I’d have a gummy smile.

I’ve got a hairline incision that is basically a very thin red line now (I’m currently in the early disorganized collagen stage. When I’m past that and in the “organized” stage, the red will start to fade).
</p>
<p>
The other is a very faint line under the tip of my nose. It’s fading but still a little reddish around that area as it’s still healing quite a bit now.
</p>
<p>
He went into my mouth for jaw and chin so that’s it for scars.

Yeah it’s pretty extensive. 1-3 weeks of intense swelling but pain usually subsides by the 2-3 week. Overall swelling is down 80% by like the 1-2 month mark. You look normal by then. Remaining swelling takes up to a year. But that’s mostly subtle definition here and there. Nose, chin and jaw take the longest.

I see, thank you, I&#39;m glad to have been blessed with this incomplete androgen insensitivity syndrome so I won&#39;t need surgeries (I&#39;m really scared of surgeries)
