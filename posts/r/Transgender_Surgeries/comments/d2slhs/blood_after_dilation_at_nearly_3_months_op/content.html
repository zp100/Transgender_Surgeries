The same thing just happened to me after 5 months. I haven&#39;t bled since the first couple of days after the packing came out, but for the last week I&#39;ve had (very light) bleeding while dilating.
<br>
I saw my surgeon yesterday and told her about it. Apparently it&#39;s not that uncommon, I just have some tissue that&#39;s taking *forever* to heal, and the bleeding is just part of the process.
<br>
Definitely let your surgeon know, but as long as it&#39;s not a lot of blood, it&#39;s probably nothing to worry about.

I wouldn&#39;t worry, hon.  I am two years post-op and I will get a streak of blood once in a while if I am a little too aggressive with dilation. It&#39;s delicate tissue in there.

I&#39;ve had this yesterday, for me it was actually the area between the vagina and anus.
