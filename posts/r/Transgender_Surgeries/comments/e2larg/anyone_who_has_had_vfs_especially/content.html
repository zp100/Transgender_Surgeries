When did that all start to subside? And when did your voice start to sound clear and normal? Because i am thinking i will give it another week before i start trying to talk.

It started to get better pretty much as soon as I started to use it, but it took quite a while for it to regain strength and clarity. I&#39;m about 5 months post op and am still working on strength. I regained much of my clarity around 3-4 months post op. I understand it can take 6-12 months for complete recovery.
</p>
<p>
Gently trying to use your voice is important for recovery. Don&#39;t over strain it, but definitely use it, otherwise the muscles won&#39;t re-strengthen as quickly.

How long did it take before your voice settled on it’s new pitch? I have this scheduled in February and I’m really wondering what to expect for a recovery timeline.

Voices are far more than simply pitch. I think I was near my current pitch by the time I was back too 100% voice use (6 weeks post op). However, my voice was still hoarse, quiet, and tired sounding. I then got hit by bronchitis, which didn&#39;t help matters any. At around 3 months post op, voice quality was a lot better, but still weak and easily tired.  At almost 6 months post op, my voice feels pretty natural.  I understand that it can take up to a year for it to completely settle.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m tired and in some pain at the moment, since I had bottom surgery just over a week ago. As a result, my voice is kind of tired and pitched down. But it&#39;s definitely a female tired and pitched down voice.

You&#39;re welcome. :)
</p>
<p>
Have you given some thought to how you&#39;re going to communicate while you can&#39;t speak? (I would recommend either a notebook or tablet to write things down on, and a TTS app for your phone personally.)
</p>
<p>

<p>
Thank you. Despite all the tiredness, soreness, and the time suck that is dilation and aftercare, I&#39;m happy.

I was honestly just thinking of the notes app on my phone. Do you thing text to speech would be that useful vs people just reading large font?

I found it nice to have a voice to use, even if I was only borrowing it. Saying thank you just felt better to me than typing thank you.

Also useful when talking to more than one person at a time.
