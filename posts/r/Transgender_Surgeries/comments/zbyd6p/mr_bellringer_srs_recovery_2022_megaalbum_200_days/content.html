Thank you for posting these. Hope it&#39;s OK if i all a few questions ?
</p>
<p>
How do you find sensation ? Are you able to climax at all?
</p>
<p>
Yours looks similar to mine but your scaring is not as bad or raised as mine is at 1 year post op.    Do you have any pain or lumps under the scars ?
</p>
<p>
Generally you seem happy from what you have written. It&#39;s there any stand out good or bad things that you can think of? Anything you would have done differently in hindsight ?

There is sensation but not strong. I haven&#39;t explored as much as I should because I have very little desire to masturbate. For now I can approach climax but I cannot orgasm and, as I wrote in the photo album, PiV sex is rather painful, in thighs and the vagina.
</p>
<p>
I have mixed feelings, I like the esthetic result, and was even told that being in me feels like being in a cis girl, but I miss having orgasms, even though I could only do it alone, since penetrating others was not fun to me and I hated being given head.
</p>
<p>
If I learn to masturbate with less effort, or find satisfaction in being penetrated or being eaten, I&#39;ll be able to say I&#39;m satisfied. Otherwise, I&#39;d be better with orchi.
</p>
<p>
There are no stand out things in either direction. I still need to readjust to my current level of sex drive because it&#39;s keeping me lazy rather than looking for partners.
</p>
<p>
EDIT, missed bits:
</p>
<p>
Lumps/pain: no lumps, when it comes to pain - sometimes some general pain. My clitoris glans doesn&#39;t like being pressed the same way my penis glans didn&#39;t like being touched.
</p>
<p>
It seems like the erectile tissue is all the way below labia minora. It is sensitive. I stil need a good way to activate it. For now finger + wand worked best.

Thank you for your honest reply and congratulations on having PIV sex even though it was painful.
</p>
<p>
I hope the sensation improves for you and you can reach climax more easily in the future x

Penile inversion, yes. With clitoris formed of erectile tissue and penis glans.

This was really helpful - and kinda trippy - to read as someone who had the same surgery with the same consultant at the same hospital on Nov. 3rd. I can see a lot of similarities between our results. I also developed a haematoma which caused a lot of problems but it eventually drained out of some dehiscence (which meant dropping a pint of partly-congealed blood into my mattress, unfortunately). By chance, do you also have a problem with pressure on the middle of your pubic mound causing pain in your clitoris? Even quite high up just a little rpessure below my belly button hurts my clit a lot, it&#39;s very tight there, and i wonder if that&#39;s  me-specific or common.

Hm... so if I press the area above number 2 in this picture, I feel some unpleasant sensation. No really pain.

</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have this.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to pain, there is still some if I press legs together, which complicates sleeping on the side. So i sleep with a pillow in between my legs.
</p>
<p>
Also, I used my donut pillow for good 6 months post-op.

Pressing the spot you described gives me outright pain. I guess my clit is just really sensitive, or... big? underneath the mound? or something? it&#39;s not like it has any real impact on my life anyway lol
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sitting on the donut pillow right now! I think I won&#39;t need it pretty soon, mostly I just experience an unpleasant pressure when I sit without it, not really pain. I usually sit on my feet instead :) I&#39;m a side sleeper too and I use a pillow sometimes but some nights I find I don&#39;t need it. Did your haematoma drain like mine did or get reabsorbed over time?

Nov 3rd was like a month ago. I wouldn&#39;t expect anything not to hurt.
</p>
<p>
I practically didn&#39;t sit for 3 months post op.
</p>
<p>
My hematoma got absorbed over a month. With a little bleeding from the stitch line and some more oozing. Oozing was the case for a really long time and I think it was going through skin pores. The bleeding from the v-for-victory scars was localised, from a few dark-red spots.

Well thank you for the info! It sounds like I got kinda lucky with pain in that case, as except for a few specific movements and positions there isn&#39;t constant pain anymore. but now I have a UTI which is agony, but that&#39;s okay, seems like damn near everyone gets one after this surgery and it&#39;s treatable. Sitting on the toilet for 2.5hrs peeing blood in agony isn&#39;t the moment, not a good look, but I&#39;ll live lol

I was lucky not to get a UTI. Hope you get better fast.
</p>
<p>
Also, after my surgery I would usually pee by sitting on the edge of my bathtub. I would later use shower to clean myself up - still while sitting. I&#39;d do that also if I used the toilet first. Even nowadays I clean myself up once a day like this. Otherwise I stink.

I think this just goes to show that you need to put a lot of &#39;work&#39; in to get the final result. At first, when I saw the pictures, I was worried, but the final ones look great.
