4.5 months post FFS. Things are finally settling in now. Here‚Äôs a couple before/after pics, one straight on and the other at an angle.
</p>
<p>
Procedures: Rhinoplasty, deviated septum correction, brow lift, hairline reduction, orbital shave, genioplasty, jaw reduction.
</p>
<p>
Location:  Vanderbilt in Nashville with Dr. Winocour.
</p>
<p>
Cost: I had saved up and paid cash as insurance was of no help, just under $20K.
</p>
<p>
Pain: I cannot overstate how incredibly painful recovery was. I‚Äôll also add that I was under anesthesia for 12 hours. At around the 4 month I finally felt like myself. One of the markers for me is that I‚Äôm a musician and for months, I felt like I had a disconnect somewhere in my ability to play guitar. I knew what I wanted to play but my motor skills and reflexes just seemed to be firing late - I just couldn‚Äôt play as well or as spontaneously. I had feared that I simply lost the ability to play at a level I had previously been capable of playing.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, that has pretty much resolved completely.
</p>
<p>
I would now say that my surgery was worth it. FFS has done more for my transition than HRT alone could have ever accomplished. At 55 years old, I‚Äôm happier in my skin.

I can second this.  At the 3 month mark from my FFS, and the pain in recovery sucked.  Sucked really bad.

The human body‚Äôs ability to heal is frankly amazing, and part of that is making you able to function while it‚Äôs still healing.
</p>
<p>
So while you were able to be up and moving and functioning at a somewhat-normal level, your body was still repairing things under the hood. And that takes a lot of energy. The precision skills that your brain is responsible for are not prioritized when there are a lot of things to repair.
</p>
<p>
That said, I‚Äôm glad to hear that you feel back to normal now and I‚Äôm sorry to hear about the anxiety! You look fantastic, btw. =)

Wow! I&#39;m just starting at 55 and I hope my transition will be as successful as yours. Thank you so so so much for sharing all of this information! Most gals don&#39;t for one reason or another. It is so incredibly helpful, hopeful and inspiring!

I don&#39;t see any scar in your forehead anymore. Is that where the incision was? If so how long did it take before it was hardly visible

It‚Äôs very faint at this point. It‚Äôs right along the hairline, roughly 1/8‚Äù above the hair line. I have a ton of baby hair growth now and so the scar is not really visible unless I were to lift it all up and pull it back.

That is really great I was worried about your hair line scar initially!   Did you have some shock hair loss at the incision?

Omg you look amazing, I definitely would not have guessed 55. Just to verify, insurance played no part at all? I&#39;m still relatively uninformed about ffs but 20k in the US seems like an amazing price, granted my only other comparison was transop

Hey Dylana, your results are beautiful. They are subtle but make a world of difference and you look so much more feminine. Congrats! Let me say, you are an inspiration. üíï
</p>
<p>
I asked a number of people post FFS how different it is looking in the mirror after recovering?
</p>
<p>
I personally struggle at times looking in the mirror. I‚Äôve been on HRT for nearly 21 months and socially transitioned 15 months ago. Accepting myself as a woman and letting go of the internalized transphobia has been hard. Looking in the mirror and seeing a man‚Äôs face staring back is so jarring at times. My hope is that with FFS, that trigger for dysphoria will go away. How has that been for you?

Child abuse trigger warning:
</p>
<p>
I was physically and emotionally abused by my father. He would beat me in an attempt to make me a man. Unfortunately, I looked just like him. Every time I would see my reflection, I would see him staring back at me, yelling at me to toughen up.
</p>
<p>
After FFS, I no longer see my dad‚Äôs face, eyes, nose and mouth looking back at me. That was the biggie for me. He‚Äôs gone. Wiped away. I‚Äôm free.

That was not the answer that I expected but truly appreciate you sharing such a sensitive topic. Being one that was sexually molested for a good period of time, I can empathize with the abuse be it different.
</p>
<p>
I too see my father in the mirror. While he was an amazing man, it is NOT what I want to see in the mirror. If FFS has helped you with such a traumatic trigger attached, that gives me such hope for myself. Thank you so much!
