I guess you&#39;re roughly 1 month out from what you said you had your surgery.  So this surgery in particular can be problematic.  Its called
<strong>
Corner Lip Lift surgery
</strong>
, and leaves a cut directly at the corners of the mouth.  The ability for the scar here to heal is partially dependent on how good your surgeon rejoins the cuts and HIGHLY dependent on how well you heal from deep cuts.  I would talk to your surgeon and query about anti-scaring procedures at the three-six month mark.  You&#39;ll be looking a things like micro-needling, and laser.  Note if you have bad redness/scabbing you may need anti-biotics or steroids to make sure its healing correctly fundamentally (though I don&#39;t see any indications of that from your picture).
</p>
<p>
For scars like that though, you&#39;re looking at VERY long times to heal and fade.  Many people require 1-2 years to have substantial fading of the scar and redness can last that long depending on how you heal.  For me personally it can take 5 years for a scar like that to disappear without assistance from micro-needling/laser.
</p>
<p>
So be proactive and consider laser with your surgeon based off the timing they think would be logical with your healing.  Also BIG hugs, I know this is super frustrating.

Looks like some fun new sources of pain for me, just what I needed hahah üòÖ. At least there&#39;s the silver lining of having a mask covering my lips for the foreseeable future anyways! Thank you for the reply üòÅ

&lt;nod&gt; Totally not fun, and its scary to have scars.  But you still have plenty of time for normal scar healing to occur.  And some options to minimize

Hope so! It was a very last minute decision to add the procedure, not sure it was worth it at this point üòÖ

He didn&#39;t mention much about after care, I&#39;m seeing him again next week for a follow up so I will talk to him about it then. Thanks for the advice üòä

Definitely use silicon gels. You can get them at a pharmacy.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t use anything with vitamin E or Bio Oil.

I&#39;ve also never seen this surgery before. It would be great if you can post a before photo and some updates in the future as you heal.

Would you mind talking a bit more about surgery with him. No one else has ever posted about FFS with him and it could help others in the future.

Yeah that&#39;s him.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not entirely sure what to say. He doesn&#39;t specialise in FFS, though has worked on 20 or so trans women. I believe he&#39;s able to do all of the common ffs procedures, though doesn&#39;t like to do many in the same surgery (IE, not forehead work and jaw work in the same surgery).
</p>
<p>
I mostly chose to go with him for convenience since he operates in my city and because he&#39;s one of the few Australian surgeons I&#39;ve heard of that can perform type 3 forehead reconstruction.
</p>
<p>
So far I&#39;m happy with the results of my forehead and nose. My nose is still slightly crooked, but that was to be expected as I had a very complicated nose to work on. Outside of the scarring I&#39;m happy with the lips also, though the scarring definitely puts a damper on things üòÖ

I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre dealing with this scar, but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre retaining your sense of humor about it!
</p>
<p>
Use silicone scar gel. I personally like strataderm the best. It‚Äôs more expensive per ounce but I think it goes a longer way than others I‚Äôve tried. Patches are even better as they are thought to help with lessening the surface tension at the scar site. The less tension during healing the less likely a noticeable scar will develop (especially hypertrophic). Those cheap rolling microneedling devices (use smallest setting and be careful/hygienic with it) also claim to help with scars. My electrologist who used to be a esthetician/cosmetologist also says that they help with improving scars. I haven‚Äôt tried yet because I hate needles lol (and I need to get electrolysis near the scar I care about and didn‚Äôt want it to interfere).
</p>
<p>
In the future, always ask what type of sutures they‚Äôll use. There‚Äôs some evidence that removeable sutures are better for minimizing the appearance of scars than dissolvable sutures. I plan to request removable ones for bottom surgery (yes, it can be painful to remove, but beauty is pain). The surgeon who did my forehead reconstruction and did that suture actually pinched the skin and used staples for the same reason silicone patches should work better‚Äîto reduce skin tension during healing. I do not have a hypertrophic scar where they used removeable sutures (only 3 so far head, nose, and inside mouth)  but where they‚Äôve used dissolvable sutures it was 3/5.

Doubt I could ever lose my humour üòÖ. Will definitely be investing in a silicon gel haha. The surgeon used removable stitches for all visible incisions so there&#39;s no problem there. I can&#39;t imagine how many stitches would need to be removed for the forehead incision, ouch üòÆ. Thanks for the advice, beat of luck with your bottom surgery!

The ones on the head (ear to ear) didn‚Äôt hurt as bad as I thought. My mom said hers hurt bad on her leg. The ones inside the mouth on the other hand? Way worse than upper lip electrolysis (it was just on the inside of upper lip).

I‚Äôve seen some good results with medical scar tattooing, but you have to wait 9 month to a year before being able to do it! Good luck

Can see that when applying lipstick/lip color that all is in the right place. Going to look really awesome as for a PERFECT lip shape when you go straight across connecting the ends. Surgeon did a grest job.

Any update if your scar healed ok and how long?  Seriously considering this procedure but the chance of having bad scars there for long is scary.
