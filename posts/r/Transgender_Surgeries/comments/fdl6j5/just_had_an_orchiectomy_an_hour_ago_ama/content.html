I’m in a lot of pain at the moment and the surgeon refused to give me any painkillers. He suggested i take tylenol. So that’s fun.
</p>
<p>
But yeah ask me anything!!

Who is the surgeon? How long was the wait list? Did you need a psych letter? What did it cost?

Surgeon: Dr. Daniel Cohen from urology center of winter park FL.
</p>
<p>
Waitlist: essentially zero. He could have done it two weeks after my consultation but due to scheduling I waited two months.
</p>
<p>
Psych letter: I needed one (1) letter from my therapist saying that I was ready for surgery. Other than that he took my word that I’ve been on hormones for over a year.
</p>
<p>
Cost: $1000 deposit for the surgeon, $975 for the surgery center, and unknown (yet) for the anesthesiologist. He coded the surgery as medically necessary for orchialgia, or chronic pain from fatigued testicles. My insurance approved that reasoning so it was a lot cheaper. I have yet to see what the actual billing cost was but for me it should be 2-3k with insurance!

What the deal with the painkillers? I’d be extremely unhappy with that.

Yep that’s him!

I have no idea what’s up with the painkillers. I asked before surgery and he said that it’s not a painful procedure and that Tylenol/Advil should be enough. Spoiler: IT’S NOT. After surgery it was really bad but all they did was give me a bunch of Tylenol. I asked for more as it wasn’t helping at all, but they said he didn’t approve of opiates/painkillers so over the counter stuff was all I’d receive. I’m pretty pissed. My roommate has some oxy left over from their surgery so I’m contemplating taking some of theirs.

You may still have some anaesthetics in you from the surgery. Hopefully it won’t get worse.
</p>
<p>
I had that once. The doctor said it wouldn’t hurt too much, and it didn’t, until after I got home and it was to late to get anything stronger. I always keep leftover painkillers now for when the doctor screws me over.

Just took some 5/325 from my roommate and wow I feel much better. No idea why he denied me a script but I’ll make it with what I’ve got.

I was given some Oxy tabs post surgery. I didnt use too many, mostly just the few cpl days, and then just to help me sleep a few days more. Then it was just some OTCs for a week or so. Dont forget to use ice packs too.
