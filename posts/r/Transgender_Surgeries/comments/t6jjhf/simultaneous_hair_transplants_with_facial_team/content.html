I had a simultaneous hair transplant with Facial Team. I&#39;m really happy with it. I followed post op instructions, and it healed just fine. The area was very red for a while post surgery, but that slowly went away in the first year. im 3 years post-op now. Feel free to ask any questions :)

Thanks for responding :)
</p>
<p>
Did they have to shave your hairline for the transplant?
</p>
<p>
Was the area swollen as well as being red for a while post surgery?
</p>
<p>
Was it easy to hide post surgery? (I have bangs and was hoping to cover up any redness and swelling with them)
</p>
<p>
How difficult is the aftercare to keep up?
</p>
<p>
How quickly did your hairline start to look normal?
</p>

I don&#39;t think they shaved my hairline, no.
</p>
<p>
The area was incredibly swollen for the first week or so. I looked like an alien. Not painful though.
</p>
<p>
I think bangs could be a good option for hiding it - yeah. There is gonna be a scar where they do the coronal incision, and if you got to a hairstylist that will probably be somewhat obvious to them for a long time.
</p>
<p>
The aftercare only feels a bit intense immediately after, but nurses will come and help and instruct you. I was very happy that I had my mom come along, so she could help me clean the area.  You have to keep the area away from direct sunlight for a while, and summers coming up, so that parts a little annoying.. I had mine done in April, and I just wore a cap and used sunscreen religiously.
</p>
<p>
I think it took about a year before the redness faded, and the area looked normal. I think it gradually looks more and more natural with time, as your hair line stops being &#39;too&#39; perfect.

Ok cool!
</p>
<p>
Did the hair grow in with the same thickness / consistency as the rest of your hair?
</p>
<p>
What other procedures did you get done with facial team? How was your recovery for those?

I&#39;d say that the thickness is the same. I have naturally curly hair, with somewhat different textures on different parts of my head. So since the transplant was grafted from the top of my scalp, it does have a slightly different texture and curl than the other hair in the front. I get keratin treatments now and straighten my hair, so the end result is that it all looks the same now.
</p>
<p>
I also got rhino, lip-lift, forehead. I have been very happy with all of it. The swelling on the nose took a while to subside and the lip-lift settled and looked natural after a few months. Nothing has been painful. Although I&#39;ll say that the first few days are pretty uncomfortable - but after that it&#39;s mostly smooth sailing.
</p>
<p>
FT has been really wonderful about answering questions and reassuring worries afterwards.
