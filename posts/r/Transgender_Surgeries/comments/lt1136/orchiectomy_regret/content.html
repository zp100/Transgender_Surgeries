I&#39;ve had my orchiectomy over 10 years now because I was sure this is what I wanted since I don&#39;t want SRS. I felt it was a healthier option than taking several hormones daily.  I just take estrogen daily and that&#39;s it. But now I think it was a mistake because I have zero interest in sex. Before my orchiectomy my libido was normal. Now I&#39;m barely interested and feel as if I&#39;ve become asexual which seems to be a problem when it comes to dating. Plus the fact that most men who are interested in dating me only want sex which is fine, however I feel insecure since I&#39;m not up to par on performance any more, Maybe I should speak to my endo about it?

You could try progesterone as it can increase libedo, or possibly your testosterone is too low.

Oh duh, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t see the T comment. Progesterone -- as prometrium -- really helps me.

I find sex begets sex. Unlike men, who&#39;s batteries are constantly charged. My libido needs to be coaxed out.

Mine was two years ago and I can relatee, However have you had your T levels checked? Mine were outside the normal female range (almost nonexistent!) so I now take T gel every other day which helps with sex drive

Not 100% sure as my doctor said they were basically almost undetectable. But I know that when I was DIYing with Androcur I was at : &lt;0.4 nmol/dL(11.5 ng/dl)

Edit: Why would someone downvote this? Lol

Don&#39;t take this the wrong way,  but this is a situation that begs for lab work. You really need to know what&#39;s going on with your blood work before you start contemplating changes.  Zero testosterone isn&#39;t something to just overlook and that would have been before the orch 10 years ago. You wouldn&#39;t have kept taking it when you didn&#39;t need to.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like we took the same route. I had GRS 12 years after, but my goal was always to keep the HRT as simplified and unintrusive as possible. The one thing I do is keep up with blood work and labs You need to keep an eye on your kidney and liver health too.
</p>
<p>
And just because you&#39;re asexual doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t like or want sex. Even asexuals get horney, they just don&#39;t make it a priority. If you get an endo to look at your lad results and make sure there aren&#39;t any glarring red flags, you may find the problem resides in the way you approach it.

Hormones affect everything, but the long-term stress it places on those organs is dependant on how you&#39;re introducing the hormones into your body. To avoid problems, it&#39;s best to choose methods like intramuscular shots, transdermal patches, supppsitories or even pellets.

Iâ€™m on the patch right now. Once I bank my sperm Iâ€™ll be comfortable having an orchiectomy in order to get off spiro. I do want to make choices that lead to longevity

I&#39;d check your hormone levels... estradiol, testosterone, AND estrone. While taking oral estradiol my estrone level was 3-4x the normal range. High estrone has the potential of increasing the risk of one type of breast cancer, according to some resources. And who knows if it has a risk of liver damage. I switched to weekly injections. If your hormones are out of whack it can throw off many things including libido. If you go with progesterone, I highly suggest avoiding the synthetic version. From sourcing info from medical references: estradiol range: 39-440 pg/mL; testosterone: 15-70 ng/dL; estrone: 10-173 pg/mL; estriol, serum: &lt;0.21-0.21 ng/mL; progesterone: 0.2-1.5 ng/mL. The ranges vary depending on age, postmenopause, etc. As long as you are within these ranges and you feel good, you are good to go. Some have higher levels of E than the normal since no one can give me an answer to the definition of the supraphysiological level of estradiol, I don&#39;t know when the level of estradiol becomes too high. Supraphysiological is a term used in the WPATH guide. I&#39;ve asked the VA endos, and other Drs what that level is, no one knows...

Thank you. That gives me some references to dive into and finally have two numbers, the 1200 and 1750, to throw at the VA endos when they tell me my level of E is too high.

I think the proper directions say to spread it on your shoulders?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also heard that genital skin is uniquely absorbent to hormones, so I actually put the gel on my vulva (not the clitoris though - yikes, stings). Anyway, it seems to work quite well. I definitely notice a change in my attitude towards sexy time within 2-3 days.

No.  Post-orchi it was fine for a couple years, but over time it&#39;s completely diminished. Sometimes I&#39;m in the mood, when I want of course, but lately I&#39;m bored with trying.
