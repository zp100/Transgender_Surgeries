Post holiday report from the land of Dilation and Recovery!
</p>
<p>
For those who haven&#39;t followed my previous posts - PI Vaginoplasty 11/10/22 at MGH in Boston with Dr. Winograd&#39;s team.
</p>
<p>
Crotch status? Nominal. Everything is going really well healing wise. Dilation has been fabulous and surprisingly easy. Last week I cut down to twice a day at the six week mark, it makes my days so much easier just doing it when I wake up and when I&#39;m ready to head to sleep. Huge difference in my stress levels. Moving up slowly in dilator size I think helped a lot in keeping with depth. I&#39;m always at 4th or 5th dot, although with exterior swelling going down I think i&#39;m really falling in at around the 4th dot which is fine with me. The past day I starting trying out the largest orange dilator and I was surprised to see I can get it in to the 3rd dot without issue and with a little pressure down to the 4th. Weeks ago I was terrified to even imagine that going in, period.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had much in the way of discharge or blood, just very little after dilation, but nothing to worry about. I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I actually feel confident enough to go out without pads most of the time which is so much better.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m pretty much back to my normal self, not feeling like I&#39;m restricted in any way. Going to give myself a once or twice over with the mirror tonight and decide if I&#39;m good to go to submerge again. My hot tub is calling!
</p>
<p>
Sensation in the clitoris is definitely there, and experimenting with different techniques is giving me a lot of confidence. There is still healing to be done in that area, and I feel like it&#39;s going to be a bit before I can experience an orgasm, but progress is being made.
</p>
<p>
My next follow up with MGH isn&#39;t for another 3 weeks, which I find surprising because the last time I saw them was a week post hospital stay. But I also have had zero issues so I&#39;m not worried at all.
