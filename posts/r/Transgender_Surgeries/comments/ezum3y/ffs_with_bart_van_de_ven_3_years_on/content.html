This is going to be a long post. I apologise for this in advance, and I apologise for the negative tone and sentiments expressed herewith. Please consider avoiding reading this post if you are determined to have FFS soon; it will only serve to put you on edge, hopefully for no reason at all. I wish you all the best with your surgeries if you &#39;re having them.

<strong>
Surgery with Bart van de Ven
</strong>
</p>
<p>
In Spring of 2016 I had FFS with Bart van de Ven in his O2 clinic in Antwerp.  I had a) forehead recontouring type 1 with browlift and orbital rim shaving, b) jaw angle reduction and chin recontouring, and c) lipofilling around the eyes, around the cheeks and nasolabial folds with liposuction under the chin.
</p>
<p>
To say I am disappointed with the results of the surgery would be an understatement. It seems that every single one of those procedures went wrong in some way. I was left with visible scars that were only partly addressed by a revision surgery in 2017 and far from being feminised, my face now looks older and strange and unnatural.

</p>
<p>
In my upper face, the surgery left me with a prominent dent in the bone of my forehead, above my right eye, with a diameter of a 2-penny coin and deep like half a chickpea (see pictures above). The incision behind my hairline left a deep scar that spans the length of my entire forehead and is clearly visible when I part my hair. The bone above my eybrows is jagged and rough, like someone attempted to cut notches in the bone, like a saw. The inside corners of the bone above my eyes, where my nose meets my forehead, are uneven. The skin above my eyes now hangs down loosely as a result of the orbital rim contouring, forming prominent wrinkles where I dind&#39;t have any wrinkles before (a friend who didn&#39;t know I&#39;ve had FFS recommended I have a browlift, after she had one too. But she&#39;s 15 years older than me).

<p>
In my middle face, I have two little balls of scar tissue on each cheek, where I assume the needle for the lipofilling went in. These are visible from the side and they deform the shape of my cheeks. Despite the lipofilling my nasolabial folds are now more prominent than before. It seems all the fat from the injection went on the outside of the folds and accentuated their outer ridges. Far from making my face look more rounded and feminine, this makes my face look more old and tired.

My lower face is a complete disaster.
</p>
<p>
As a result of the chin and jaw recontouring, I now have jowls and a double chin (see 2nd and 3d picture above). The jowls are the result of the loose skin and muscle that was left behind after the operation. The double chin is actually a thick and hard mass of scar tissue that has formed around the incision in the muscle under my chin. This has left a deep scar that deforms the entire underside of my neck under my chin.  Unfortunately, although it&#39;s under my chin, it&#39;s quite visible from all sides including from the front. To clarify, I did not have jowls or a double chin before the operation. I do now, and the result, combined with the new wrinkles above my eyes and harsh lines under my cheekbones and the accentuation of my nasolabial folds by the botched lipofilling is that my face looks 10 years older.

Unwanted changes to my lower lip

</a>
</p>
<p>
My lower lip is now half the size it was before the operation (see pictures above) and has lost most of its mobility, to the point that I have trouble moving my lip to speak when it&#39;s cold. This is not the result of nerve damage, rather it&#39;s the result of the stitching of the intraoral incision that was done in such a way as to pull my lower lip down and inside my mouth, so that it&#39;s drawn tight against my teeth.  As a further consequence of this stitching my mouth doesn&#39;t close properly and I have two furrows that run down from the corners of my mouth. This means that the corners of my mouth are now constantly leaking saliva. Besides the obvious unpleasantness of this, the saliva leakage has caused me to develop contact dermatitis and angular chelitis and the skin around my mouth is red and peeeling.
</p>
<p>
My mouth was the most feminine and most attractive feature of my face, before the surgery and losing it has had a real impact on me. The worse thing is that this seems to have been done deliberately, without informing me. The clinic&#39;s website says that the smile changes as a result of chin reduction if &#34;you suture the muscle well&#34; because &#34;the lower lip moves upwards&#34;. This is in a FAQ item on chin surgery that I saw for the first time the day after the surgery. I discussed it with Bart on the same day, in the first post-operative appointment.  I asked if this FAQ item was true, whether this was the reason my lower lip looked so much smaller and whether my lower lip would recover its shape with time. Bart said that yes, this was the reason my lower lip was smaller and that no, my lip would not recover. I said I wasn&#39;t happy with this, that I really liked the way my mouth looked before and that I wanted it to be put back the way it was.
</p>
<p>
Bart then said it was better this way and when I expressed incredulity he continued that a smaller mouth is more feminine and that he always sutures the intraoral incision of his patients so as to make the crease under the lower lip more shallow. He told me that his father, who is also a maxillofacial surgeon visits his theater once a week (I did not note the day) to watch him operate and that, when the time comes to suture the intraoral incision, the father instructs Bart to suture the incision so as to make the crease under the lip a little deeper. Bart then mimed to me how he responds by wagging his finger, laughing and saying &#34;no no no&#34;, after which he proceeds to do the suturing the way he wants it, which makes the lower lip smaller. I was not informed of all this before the operation, neither that my &#34;smile would change&#34; (which I only found out by chance when reading the O2 website FAQ), nor that there was an option when suturing the intra-oral incision to make the lower lip smaller or not.  Indeed, Bart recommended to me three times that I should have an upper lip lift and each time I replied taht &#34;I don&#39;t want a lip lift because I like my mouth the way it is and I don&#39;t want it to change&#34;. This would have been a good time to make me aware that my mouth would change as a result of the chin surgery, at which point I could have made an informed decision. Sadly, I was not given this opportunity.
</p>
<p>
Bart did offer a revision with lipofilling, at the end of that conversation and I accepted, hoping that it would address the issues somewhat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Revision surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had a revision surgery in 2017 to close up the hole in the bone of my forehead with bone cement, to have a facelift to try and correct the jowls and double chin and to correct my lower lip with lipofiling. The revision surgery was not free: I paid a reduced price for the facelift and paid the stay at the clinic and hospital costs in full. Unfortunately, while the revision partially closed the hole in my bone, it seems to have opened again recently to the point that it&#39;s visible when I lift my brows. The facelift only made matters worse by pulling the skin of my cheeks so tight that I now have harsh lines running under my cheekbones. And the tightened skin throws the scar under my chin into greater contrast so it&#39;s even more visible than before. The lipofilling of my lower lip to correct the effects of the stitching of the intraoral incision restored some of the size of my lower lip but it did not address the stiffness, or leaking etc and it did not restore the shape of my mouth to what it was before.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Conclusions
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I knew that FFS is complex surgery and lots of things can go wrong. I had read plenty of others&#39; accounts before booking my surgery and I only finally decided to have surgery after having lived for 20 years as a woman - so I didn&#39;t rush to do something impulsive that I hadn&#39;t thought of. And yet, nothing could prepare me for this outcome. I&#39;ve never heard of anyone aging 10 years as a result of FFS. I don&#39;t even remember hearing anyone being left with visible scars after FFS. To be honest, three years later I am still in shock- that I lost 10 years of youthful looks, that all the femininity that I built up over 20 years was destroyed in a few hours of surgery, that this surgery that was supposed to be cosmetic left me disfigured and defaced. I have trouble looking at my face in the mirror and I don&#39;t want to go outside the house, or meet new people anymore. I don&#39;t want people to think this is who I am.
</p>
<p>
As to Bart van de Ven, I have found his reaction to my concerns callous, uncaring and unbecoming of a doctor. When I expressed concern about my jowls and double chin he laughed and dismissed it with a wave of his hand, saying that it&#39;s just swelling and if it hasn&#39;t gone away in a year, we&#39;ll discuss revision. In our third post-operative appointment, nine months later, he agreed that this was no swelling but said that a facelift (which I proposed as revision) would not make a difference. When I asked what was I supposed to do now that I have more hanging skin than a woman in her 60s, he made a joke that I should wait to get to 60 and then get a facelift. Eventually he agreed to do a facelift, though I had to pay it at a reduced price. When I met him for one final time, he told me that a further facelift would not correct things and in any case he did not have the skill to perform it. I stress that he actually used those words: &#34;I do not have the skill&#34;. He then suggested he could recommend a coleague of his that could do an invasive form of facelift that would remove some of the glands in my neck, which I declined. Later in the same appointment he suggested I lose some weight and then return to discuss a revision, probably because I had earlier mentioned I want to lose weight. As he was holding open the door for me to leave, he made a final joke about how I should perhaps pick up some sport.
</p>
<p>
I am well aware that many of Bart&#39;s patients declare satisfaction with their surgeries (but then again, I have very rarely heard any trans woman having anything but glowing praise for her surgeons). However, it&#39;s easy to be happy when things go well. It&#39;s when things go bad that I, personally, expect to see the signs of competence, professionalism and a caring attitude. I saw none of that in Bart.

Hmm, that is really sobering. Do you mind if I ask you a few things?:
<br>
- Where was the incision for your facelift, the one meant to reverse the loose jowls?
</p>
<p>
- Do you mind sharing any photos of what your lower face looks like after that facelift? I am literally considering a lower facelift myself (by a different surgeon).
</p>
<p>
- How old were you when you had the original procedures (skin has different elasticity at different ages)?

Hi. The incision for my facelift was done around my ears.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d rather not say about my age. I transitioned 20 years ago (in fact, more than that, now) and I was in my early twenties. That should give a ballpark idea. I agree that my skin has lost its elasticity, but note that I didn&#39;t have any wrinkles before the surgery and certainly not in my lower face. I seem to remember that this is a common outcome of long-term HRT (something about collagen developing differently for transwomen. Sorry that this is very vague).
</p>
<p>
Sorry, I don&#39;t seem to be able to add a picture to this comment. I&#39;m new to Reddit and don&#39;t know the interface well. I have a few pictures I wouldn&#39;t mind to share. How do I post them?

Hey, thank you, I can see them.
</p>
<p>
From the pictures, it looks like he only lifted you around midface (cheekbones/ears), but not the lower face? I would have expected a lower facelift incision to extend lower, from the ear downwards and backwards into the hairline.
</p>
<p>
I appreciate your openness, it helps me plan my own surgeries.

The proposal for the revision surgery says &#34;deep vertical lift&#34; but to be honest I don&#39;t really know what that means- I don&#39;t know much about the different types of facelift. I wasn&#39;t planning to have one any time soon. I just went with what Bart advised. I still had some trust left in him at that point.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m adding three more pictures that show the incisions around my ears more clearly:

My lower face was pulled up pretty tight after the facelift- but it sagged again pretty much all the way afterwards.

Yeah, one surgeon was suggesting to me something similar: around the ear, and in the front.
</p>
<p>
He was saying that in order to be successful, the lift has to involve more than just the top layer of skin; it should also pull up the &#39;matrix&#39; or &#39;substrate&#39; underneath, or whatever the specialized word is.

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know what exactly was done in my case. It look really good for a while and I thought it had fixed things, but unfortunately it eventually all went back to the way it was before the facelift :(

Oh no! That sucks! How long did it take to go back?

I heard that facelifts aren&#39;t forever, but they should last about a decade.

A few months or so. I think the tightness was just swelling. So it&#39;s perhaps more accurate to say that it didn&#39;t do much to begin with.

Wow...even the best drop the ball sometimes. My heart is with you. He really did manage to take volume out of your beautiful pre-op lips. How? Why?

To be honest, Bart never really explained what exactly he did to my mouth and I still have trouble understanding it even now. It would have been nice to hear an explanation, as in &#34;I cut this and that and stitched things this way&#34; etc, so that at least I could understand what exatly was done to me. All I got is &#34;the smile changes&#34; and how this is more feminine and it&#39;s the right way to do it.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t really accept either explanation. His story about his father telling him to do it one way and him doing it another way certainly suggests there are more than one way to do it and the bit about a smaller lip being more feminine sounds more like an excuse, or an attempt to allay my concerns.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I get the feeling that he didn&#39;t bother to look at my face and try to figure out what was worth preserving during the operation. I just got his standard, without any consideration for what my face really needed.

Chin and jaw reductions can leave some undesired effect. Mine did. I have some sagging under the chin as well as my submandibular salivary gland being compromised somehow leaving the gland in a constant state of inflammation.... or not. Not a good look when it is. All this work is very invasive and the results seem terribly hit and miss. In the final analysis, we get to see some limited cherry picked results in the best of angles with ideal lighting from hundreds of their patients. It can be anywhere from disappointing to devastating when we meet their limitations.

I&#39;m just about to book a consultation with Dr Van de Ven. He has so many amazing results but yours isn&#39;t the first account of things really not going well. It&#39;s just so scary, I&#39;m sure all surgeons have off days and patients with complications but when it&#39;s your face it&#39;s a hell of a dice to roll...

I&#39;m sure your operation will go great and you&#39;ll be fine and dandy. To be fair, most trans women end up being very happy with their operations so there&#39;s little cause for concern.

I&#39;m very sorry this happened to you.
</p>
<p>
FFS is no walk in the park and it&#39;s horrible that surgeons dismiss our concerns so callously.
</p>
<p>
I feel like I can somewhat relate to your post. I&#39;m 3.5 months post-op and while I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to use the word &#34;botched&#34; yet things aren&#39;t exactly how I imagined they&#39;d be. I also had aggressive jaw and chin work, including a lower face and neck lift, and I have jowls now where i never had them before. My nose looks uneven and so do my eyebrows, and I&#39;m also experiencing the excess skin hanging over my orbital rims. I&#39;m trying to stay hopeful that it&#39;s all just swelling but it&#39;s hard to stay optimistic when so many people have results that are profound and beautiful just a few weeks after surgery. And I didn&#39;t go to Dr. Bart.
</p>
<p>
I hope things get better for you. Hopefully your post will inform and educate others so they can avoid this doctor in the future.

Well, if you&#39;re only 3.5 months post-op then it&#39;s too early to tell. It&#39;s very likely that, in your case, &#34;jowls&#34; are just swelling. So please don&#39;t worry your self too much. Give it some time- a year or two, even. Things can take that long to settle down.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure everything will turn out great for you and you&#39;ll have a beautiful result yourself, just like those other people :)

When I was 3 months post-op, I looked very smooth, a little chubbier than normal, but quite smooth.
</p>
<p>
6-12 months later, when the swelling went down all the way, is when saggy jowls became apparent. Not a ton, but enough that I notice it.

Isn&#39;t it inevitable that when you do jaw muscle reduction and feminize the jaw and chin that there is going to be excess skin after the swelling abates ?

Yes, and my surgeon expressedly warned me about it prior to surgery. It depends on your age too - if you&#39;re young, the skin can retract somewhat. He said that in my late 30s, I would likely need a lower facelift to deal with the excess skin - or just live with loose jowls.
</p>
<p>
Personally, yeah, it bugs me. I get that it was a price I had to pay - the FFS undoubtedly made me look feminine and pass, but my jaw went from perfectly smooth, to looking 10+ years older. So I feel like I went from a fairly young 30-something-looking male to an older over-the-hill-looking woman.

A few months ago, I had drinks with a small group that included a 60+ y.o.  MTF who underwent a full boat FFS.  Forehead, jaw reduction genioplasty  -- all of it.  Eight months later she went back to the same surgeon for a full face lift.   She is very attractive and appeared to be about 45-50 years old.   There were zero visible scars or evidence of &#34;work&#34;.  Just remarkable.

So I&#39;m curious... is van de Ven considered one of the more &#34;aggressive&#34; facial surgeons? Or maybe somewhere in the middle of the scale?

Exactly how do you think that a hole in the bone of my forehead would &#34;affect the total image of&#34; me? Are you saying it might make me more feminine, for example?

Your image is not even remotely like the ones I post here.
</p>
<p>
Like I say in my other comment, it was Bart who told me that the dent I could clearly see on my forehead (unlike in your picture) was a hole in my bone. He then proceeded to offer me a revision, during which he opened up the incision behind my hairline again and filled in the hole with bone cement.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s hard to believe he would have done all this, at considerable expense, if he thought it was all a bit subjective and really down to the lighting and angle of a few pictures I took. I mean, he actually palpated the hole with his fingers in one of our meetings.

It is not for you to tell me to live with what was done to me and move on!  That is an extremely disrespectful thing to say.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Now, just to be upfront about it, there is not a chance of a snowball in hell that I&#39;m posting my full-face pictures on this or any thread where I&#39;m discussing having had trans surgeries. I don&#39;t care if everyone else thinks that it&#39;s such a great idea, I have no intention to compromise my privacy with such publicity. For the record, there are no pictures of my full face anywhere on the internet, not on social media, not on public or private forums, not anywhere at all. And that will stay that way.
</p>
<p>
There is of course no good reason for me to post pictures of my entire face on this thread. I gave an account of the damage that Bart&#39;s incompetence and arrogance has caused to specific parts of my face and the pictures I posted show exactly those parts. This is all that&#39;s necessary to understand what he did to me. For example, when I say that he left me with a hole in the bone of my forehead, it suffices to show the hole and the area around it so that it&#39;s clear that it&#39;s a hole and that it&#39;s on my forehead. Seeing the rest of my face would not add anything to that. And so on for the rest of the pictures I posted. Like I say, a few were even taken by Bart himself.
</p>
<p>
If I may be blunt, I do not care one jot about your attempts to challenge the credibility of my post and of my account on the basis that I&#39;m &#34;withholding&#34; something. This is not CSI Miami. I can&#39;t &#34;withhold&#34; anything.  When asked to show more pictures of my results, I obliged. I&#39;m happy to do so again if required, but, to repeat, I will not post anything that will help any random nutter to identify me as trans, and give him or her information about what surgeries I had, to boot.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
As to this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What this indicates to me is that Dr Bart genuinely considered that you looked great and might easily pick up a lover if you so desired.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What a bizzare thing to say! How did you go from him telling me to &#34;pick up some sport&#34; to him meaning that &#34;I should get a lover&#34;? Are you saying he really meant to tell me to fuck off? I mean, I can see him having that emotion, but that is really not what he said.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Finally: what do you think you will achieve by attacking my credibility in public and then sending me private messages saying you want to be friends?  I&#39;m truly sorry for the problems you had and I hope you can overcome them soon, but it&#39;s clear to me you have some sort of strange agenda that has to do with praising Bart and attacking anyone who has suffered at his hands, and I don&#39;t want anything to do with that agenda, or with you.

<p>
Regarding the hole in my forehead, when Bart first saw the pictures I post, which I sent to him a few days after I firest noticed the dent in my forehead (after the swelling subsided), he initially told me it is probably just a tear in the muscle and that it will eventually knit on its own.
</p>
<p>
Then we had our first post-operative meeting where he had the chance to feel the hole with his fingers, at which point he yelped &#34;I don&#39;t understand&#34;, in a little panicked voice that didn&#39;t do much to put my mind at ease. But in any case, he said that it&#39;s an actual hole in the actual bone.
</p>
<p>
At that point he proposed lipofilling, which of course is ludicrous. Eventually, in our second appointment, he said that in order for it to be corrected properly he&#39;d have to open my face up again and close it with bone cement, which he did.
</p>
<p>
So it was a hole and it was in my bone. According to Bart anyway.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, he never really explained how or why I ended up with a hole in my bone after an operation that included bone shaving and burring. I&#39;m not even sure I want to know. But it&#39;s indicative of the care and attention that he put in my surgery.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Regarding my lower lip, after I realised that it was much reduced as shown in the pictures above- I have a more full account of my conversation with Bart in my post above, but I ommitted to say that, when I met him the day I was leaving the clinic, a few days after the operation, I asked him to confirm that my lower lip was now indeed reduced in size. He looked at my before pictures and measured something on the screen with a tool he had on his desk (kind of like a pair of calipers) although I could not see his screen so I don&#39;t know what he did there. Then he measured my lower lip on my face with the same instrument and finally said that, yeas, the size of my lower lip is now less than half what it was before the operation. [Edit: I&#39;ve just checked my notes from my meetings with Bart. The measurement happened in our first post-operative meeting, four months after the operation and he used the calipers-like tool only on the before and after pictures he had on his computer, not on my face. The &#34;after&#34; pictures are the ones I post above, in the &#34;Lower face&#34; section.]
</p>
<p>
So my mind is not playing tricks on me and Bart confirmed the reduction in the size of my lower lip himelf after taking some kind of measurement.
</p>
<p>
I asked Bart whether this was the result of the operation and he confirmed it, like I say in my post above. At that point I asked whether this was permanent, or whether my lower lip would go back the way it was and he guffawed and said, no, it won&#39;t go back. I said that I liked my lower lip the way it was before and I wanted it back the way it was and he said we could do some lipofilling. This was also done later, in the revision surgery I had.
</p>
<p>
He also said that the reduction of the size of my lip was done on purpose, because he thinks that a smaller lower lip is more feminine. I&#39;ve said more about this in my post, you&#39;re welcome to read it if you haven&#39;t. He of course did not ask me, and did not warn me, that he was going to do anything like that.
</p>
<p>
So the reduction in size of my lower lip was made on purpose and not for the reasons you suggest. It was because Bart liked it better this way.
</p>
<p>
Making changes to a patient&#39;s face without consulting with them about those changes, I&#39;m sure must constitute honest to god, official and formal medical malpractice but in any case it&#39;s what I&#39;d call a total dick move.
</p>
<p>
As to the rest of your comment- I&#39;m sorry but no, this is not CSI Miami.

If your mind is playing tricks on you, then perhaps you should wait a while until your thoughts clear up, before playing internet sleuth and trying to challenge others&#39; experiences?

About this:

<blockquote>
<p>
As I said, am sure I recall seeing your full images a couple of years  ago, and that I felt you looked nice. Not every girl wears a feather  earing.

</blockquote>
<p>
Your mind must again be playing tricks on you. Bart&#39;s surgery proposal offered me a discount of €444 on my surgical fees in exchange for his clinic being allowed to publish my before and after pictures on its website. This offer was made before the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I declined the offer preferring to keep my privacy as explained above, so my pictures were never posted on his website and therefore you have not seen my full images on his website.
</p>
<p>
... or anywhere else because I never post full face images of myself anywhere.

<p>
Re the &#39;hole&#39; you mention - I am presuming you really mean a &#39;hollow&#39;?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, it&#39;s like I said: a hole in my bone, no ifs and buts and no scare-quotes. It was about a two-penny coin in diameter and half a cheakpea in depth. It could be very clearly felt by placing a finger on it. It felt like someone drilled in my bone with a drill.
</p>
<p>
I repeat that it was identified as a hole in the bone by Bart who agreed to revise it by filling it up with bone cement. Hence, a hole and in my bone. And no mistake.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For ref, I&#39;m not disputing that your lower lip is smaller.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Good, because it would be very unreasonable to dispute that given how obvious it is in the pictures I posted.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I hope you likewise appreciate that not being able to see a fuller set  of images, makes it difficult for a reader of the thread to validate and  make an assessment about what you are saying.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Especially in view of your obvious attempts to undermine the credibility of my account by offering irrelevant alternatives (&#34;maybe the hole was not really a hole? Maybe it&#39;s just the angle and the light?&#34; etc) I do not appreciate this at all.
</p>
<p>
The pictures I have shown are perfectly adequate to illustrate my complaints: a hole in my bone, reduced size of my lower lip (unwanted), scar under my chin etc. A full face picture is entirely unnecessary and the damage done can clearly be seen in the images I posted. I can only explain your insistence to see my full-face pictures with your curiosity to know how I am and how I look, which is of course, completely irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
Besides the very clear pictures I post, there is my written account. I find it odious that you chose to challenge this by insinuating that I&#39;m somehow mentally unstable, my mind is playing tricks on me, I don&#39;t want to accept the brilliance of Bart&#39;s work because there&#39;s something wrong with me rather than with his surgery, etc etc. Why you choose to attack me, in seeming defense of Bart, I will never know and I don&#39;t care to speculate, but suffice it to say that I find it very disappointing. But not entirely unexpected, sadly.

My guess is this is because it is glandular and has now had the previous  subcutaneous fat layer removed from it (so as to lift up towards the  height of your chin as much as possible). I suspect this is rather a  unique physiological feature you have (in that your glands might extend  down a bit further than is typical).

<p>
Nope. It&#39;s scar tissue, according to my GP.

No unique mutant glands from outer space for me.

&#34;Push a bit&#34;? You said this is exactly like CSI Miami and I am withholding evidence your honour and my mind is playing tricks of me, it&#39;s all a trick of the light and so on so forth. Not quite &#34;pushing a bit&#34;.
</p>
<p>
And all in a post where I complain about how my FFS was botched and I was disfigured and scarref for life. I can&#39;t think of many ways to respond to such a post that are more insensitive and incompassionate. Well done - you get a cookie.

This image was taken after the revision surgery where I had lipofilling of my lower lip to try and correct the damage caused by Bart&#39;s original surgery.
</p>
<p>
Edit: so, you&#39;ve been poring over my pictures for the last three or four days, since we&#39;ve started our little conversation?

He was talking about a further facelift to correct the drooping skin forming jowls on the sides of my face, not the scar in the middle of my neck.

There are no glands in the middle of the neck where my scar is. Not on ordinary human beings in any case.

That is because a lot of bone reduction. Always in those cases a face lift plus must be done. Even though you seem to be young, it wont vasnish by time. btw why did you do FFS? I had full FFS twice, second time for correcting the chin with van de Ven and take out metal out of the forehead type III reconstruction and see my destroyed nose as well.
</p>
<p>
That was 14 years ago in Ghent. First I got a chin implant, that was good, but it became loose two years afterwards. So I went to van de Ven who I knew from Spain in 2010. He took out the implant and the loose screw and made a sliding genoplasty or whats called. Unfortunately from outside it is not seen. My chin is pretty much set back and so it was after the surgery. I made a panorama x ray and it is seen that the sliding thing was done and it was correctly fixed but unfortuynately he had not seen that it would not be enough in my case. I need an additional chin implant plus a face lift today. For SRS I had been with Dr. Sanguan Kunaporn in Phuket. I also saw plastic surgical results of him and his team live in action and I whished I woulod had gone to him for FFS as well. It is so much cheaper and he is a super experienced surgeron as all the others of his team as well. The thai are best for estetic things and they are affortable. Their quality is best. To good to be true actually.
</p>
<p>
So in some future I might go back to Kunaporn and get him redo my nose and correct my septum which has an S shape, plus my chin for the third time.
</p>
<p>
Most important work is the forhead if it is seen. If one does not cover the forehead that is the very first thing which has to be done and it has do be done correctly as it is difficult.

This post seems far too similar to a previous post basically saying all the same stuff. Due to the age of this account I suspect it is the same poster. All right we get it, you are not happy with the results of your surgery however what is the point of constantly posting these comments, many, many girls have had results that they are happy with. With any surgery there is risk. You unfortunately, according to you, did not end up with the result you were hoping for. It happens. Please stop what is bordering on defamation and harassment on a public forum.

Could you please link me to the post the AdrianeXX is referring to? I did a search for &#34;Bart van de Ven&#34; in this sub-reddit and found a few posts that have similarly bad experiences as mine but I&#39;m not sure which one AdrianeXX is referring to.

I haven&#39;t used Reddit before. This is my first and only reddit account. I haven&#39;t posted this on reddit before. Could you point me to the previous post that is basically saying all the same stuff? I&#39;m pretty sure that the particulars of my case are unique and so it should be simple to allay your suspicions of re-posting by comparing, e.g. pictures or procedures done etc.

Thats great. Its important that readers have a balanced view on results and Im totally not trying to undervalue your opinion or comments. FFS  is a big decision and a costly one you deserve to get what you paid for. I only hope in the long run you get the results / outcome you were hoping for.

Ok listen . I completely understand now ! Dr Bart does bone surgery ! Taking away bone is going to result in soft tissue weakness . Everybody knows that it’s logical . If you take away bone it might sag . That’s just physics . I am not for Bart and I am not against him but I know ALOT about jaw and chin surgery and bone surgery in general . I think it was to be expected . I don’t think he did something wrong . Same with reducing a prominent chin . I have talked to countless maxillofacial surgeons : there will be soft tissue problems !
