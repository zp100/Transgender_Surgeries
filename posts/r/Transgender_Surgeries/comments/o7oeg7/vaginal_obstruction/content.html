I had vaginoplasty over a year ago, and aside from some minor complaints, neither I nor my partners have had any issues.  However, recently I was dating a guy with ED and the remnant erectile tissue at the entrance to the vagina was making it hard for him to get in.  His issues aside, my extra tissue and webbing are the bottom has meant a little extra force is needed to get in.
</p>
<p>
Note, dilation and size has never been a problem for me, it’s just that initial penetration that needs help.
</p>
<p>
My question is how common is this, and has anyone had experience correcting it via revision?  It specifically gives my vagina a horizontal slit appearance, rather then the vertical appearance I’m more familiar with on cis girls.
</p>
<p>
I’d rather not go into a revision consult just to be told “that’s the best you can expect”; conversely, I’d like to know if my surgeon just did a bad job in that area.  Is it even possible to get a softer vaginal introitus?

It may sounds rude but if it does bother you, reddit won&#39;t solve your problem. A consult with a professional will. So my advice is to suck it up, be the strong and beautiful woman that you are and book that god damn consultation.
</p>
<p>
That been said, i think it&#39;s surprising that you decide to worry about this after being with that man and not the other one. If he have some ED that&#39;s his problems and not yours. There&#39;s no guarantee that things will work out after a revision. Do it for yourself.

Oh I agree wholeheartedly!  My primary concern twofold: 1) I have talked “unofficially” with a number of surgeons, and they all give salesman’s answers “of course I can do this!” (Including the surgeon I originally went with).  And 2) how common is the horizontal vs vertical opening with vaginoplasties?  Lots of surgeons (and postop women) talk up external appearance, but few speak to internal appearance.
</p>
<p>
Besides, having realistic expectations going in is the best way to get the most out of your consult, no?

My friend had that complication and an episiotomy resolved it. One of the youtubers who recently had GCS had it too and required a revision to remove corpora cavernosa.

It&#39;s great that can be revised, but as someone transitioning from straight to lesbian personally that sounds like an advantage as that&#39;s like the best part lol. ED will have issues regardless so it may just be simpler to look into fixing that which will raise their confidence anyway.

Seem like an erectile tissue issue since you can dilate just fine but once aroused it’s touch to get it inside your vagina . I go to my doctor(stiller)  who did mine on Monday for he can see what the tissue is  since my primary don’t know
