Better, still have moments of &#34;HOLY CRAPOLA I DID IT&#34; that is fun.  Still have stiches in, still have to put a liner in my undies because damn... it&#39;s wet down there.  Way more than anticipated.  Hurts from time to time, assuming it is nerves rejoining.   I have found dilation to be a right pain, as it&#39;s messy, it occasionally hurts and now that I am back at work sitting all day, it seems to be harder.  Must redouble  my efforts it would seem.
</p>
<p>
Over all, I am very very happy I did this, am sad the number of family that have basically turned their backs on me, but that is what it is.  I have my friends, family that haven&#39;t rejected me, and my job is amazing, so... over all I am happy.  I will say this, if you are considering this route, really really really know it is the right path for you.  It is not easy, it is not &#34;fun&#34;, yet at least.  While I did not lose the ability to reach climax, I have read too many stories of people being left scarred and unable to enjoy their new configuration.  This is not the path of least resistance.  Make sure, there is no going back.  Feel free to ask if you have questions.

Surgery was done by the Crane Center in Austin TX, Ashley DeLeon was my surgeon.

I figure if my journey can help someone, it&#39;s worth it.  No regrets but I can see how some might find this situation, very depressing as the healing takes a long long time.

My experience was very good.  I was sad to get a large bill after the fact as I specifically stated aftr dropping quite a bit &#34;Will I owe more&#34; and being told &#34;No.&#34;  However that is not unique to the Crane Center, the Insurance system is a mess and needs more fixing, more focus on competition and transparency.  I don&#39;t mind paying for MY needs, but I&#39;d like to know before hand what I will pay than after.  A very very good friend of mine is in Canada, started same journey, she got her date, 2022.  Won&#39;t pay she&#39;s gotta wait, I hate waiting :P  So...
<br>
That&#39;s my &#34;only&#34; complaint.
</p>
<p>
Dr. DeLeon was amazing, my results are very good, I&#39;d post a pic but... yeah internet being what it is, no.  Can only say it looks like a vagina, feels like one, acts like one, it&#39;s a vagina.  That&#39;s what I wanted, that&#39;s what I got.  Couldn&#39;t be happier.
