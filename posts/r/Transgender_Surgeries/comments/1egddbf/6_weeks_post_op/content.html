It is.  She is still a little swollen.  Even then, I think my labia is a little larger than many get for their surgery.  Let&#39;s just say I had more than enough donor tissue to use. :D
</p>
<p>
When I was talking with my surgeon I asked that she give me a vagina that &#34;looks like I was born with it.&#34;  I think she did a great job honestly.  I am 5&#39;11&#34; sp I think she did that well.  Next year I may do a small revision, but just to remove some excess skin.  Depends on if my partner says she would like that or not.  Lol!

Congratulations! You look great, huge milestone! I go in for my surgery in October and I&#39;m a ball of nerves. But I can&#39;t wait to look down and see what you see now. I just wish I wasn&#39;t so scared!

Itâ€™ll be fine. I have surgery in October as well and Iâ€™m busying myself with blood work and EKG etc and just trying to stay focused. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™re working with a therapist, I am and switched my every other week appointment to every week for a month to work through my nerves and stay focused.
</p>
<p>
You are absolutely right, I also canâ€™t wait to enjoy the new view after my â€˜upgradeâ€™.

Youâ€™ll both be fine!  If you have faith and trust in your surgeon, you will come out the other side wonderfully!  And if you do t have those feelings for your surgeon, then find one you do feel that way for. Trust me. This is a forever choice and worth the wait!
