The stitches sucked, I felt like I was always itchy, and had issues sitting comfortably at first. 100% recommend a &#34;Boppy&#34; cushion, as well as the inflatable waffle pad they give you ($20 on Amazon or any maternity website) as it takes a lot of pressure off your pelvic floor and sensitive bits while healing.
</p>
<p>
I had BBL and Zhou in April, and trust me- keep up with your dilation, schedule your meds and topical cream application, wash it properly, wipe well and keep hydrated, and it will heal incredibly.
</p>
<p>
It only got better for me over the summer/fall. I&#39;ve cum so hard and felt so much affirmation during/after, I&#39;ve cried (don&#39;t do it too early, but once you&#39;re cleared by the team, go to town. It helps keep the blues away and promotes blood-flow). Or, if you want, you can wait- she is YOURS, and nobody has any say to tell you what to do with your body. It&#39;s just you, 100%.
</p>
<p>
My bottom dysphoria is GONE. I wake up every day happy to put on pants/shorts/shower. Is it hard sometimes still? Yeah, dilation is still kinda a chore. But you&#39;ll have so so so much to loom forward to.

Congrats, girl! It&#39;s going to look even nicer once they take out some of those stitches.

Thanks! I&#39;m looking forward to getting them out. The one in my clitoris has been particularly annoying

Lol, I think that one irritated me the most and for some reason they didn&#39;t take it out the first time. I&#39;m not sure why. Anyway, I&#39;m 9 weeks out and i don&#39;t have any stitches visible anymore. Even the scars aren&#39;t that noticeable. So you can look forward to that.

<p>
Unfortunately I did have to go back to work. ðŸ˜ž

<p>
How&#39;s dilation going?

I got up to green but saw a lot of bleeding. It&#39;s a chore but well worth it

Congrats on green! I think the blue to green switch was harder for me than the green to orange switch. The bleeding will be over soon. Yes, it&#39;s a chore, but it gets easier. It&#39;s funny---I have heard people say &#34;dilating is a chore&#34; for so long that I just adopted it as my name for it. So whenever I&#39;m talking to my family about it, I say &#34;I have to go do my chores.&#34;

Its because of results like this that I refuse to go with anyone but Bluebond-Langner.
</p>
<p>
I am so excited. Your results look truly outstanding, I just hope mine look as good as yours &lt;3
</p>
<p>
First session of pre-op laser tomorrow!

Hi, I am planning to start my preparation for consultation, do you recommend laser or electrolysis?

I 100% recommend laser if you are working with Dr. Bluebond-Langner.
<br>
Electrolysis is notoriously painful and more expensive than a good laser technician.
