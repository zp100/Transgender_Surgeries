I think you should be careful not to draw the wrong conclusion from what&#39;s happened to you, or you could have more problems.
</p>
<p>
Its not Thailand that&#39;s the problem, nor local surgeons that are the answer.
<em>
Don&#39;t trust any surgeon
</em>
, anywhere, without very good evidence, and even then be wary. On the face of it, you&#39;d think all surgeons in the USA would be good, but its absolutely not true. Some of the worst results posted have been from the USA.
</p>
<p>
The good thing about Thailand (and the USA) is that some of the surgeons have a large number of reviews, and if you carefully review them you know what&#39;s likely to happen. Good or bad. If you don&#39;t look, or there&#39;s few to no reviews, its  more like playing Russian roulette.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately when it comes to revisions there&#39;s not a lot of reviews for any surgeon (apart from Suporn, and they won&#39;t work on other surgeons patients), so its really unclear who to go to. And there&#39;s not a lot of reviews for surgeons, revision or not, in most other countries at all.

Sorry to hear this horror story... I think that place is screaming for some honest and professional revision. Take care and believe in some good luck at the end with everything you went through before. All the best. üëç

That&#39;s horrible story and sorry to hear.Kamol is known well to many transgirls in korea and they are the best option to do SRS. I also consulted with Kamol about the SRS PPV,expenses and bits and pieces..I am a bit surprised with your story and I think I need to explore more SRS doctors in Thailand... Thanks for your comments

Can you tell me what your reasoning is for going out of state? I mean i hear a lot of ppl go out of state to get work done but I sounds more scary because of the many many horror stories. I got my ba done in my own state so they decided what size was best for my body. And I know all doctors aren‚Äôt good but if having done research and reviews should help. From what I‚Äôve seen so far Florida has done good doctors in specific fields.

This post is about SRS, so it‚Äôs a list of srs surgeons in Florida. There‚Äôs a different page for BBL and BA.
</p>
<p>
Also look at how malpractice insurance works in Florida.

No not Miami, in tampa. And wasn‚Äôt that the only death in Miami Florida from a bbl procedure that the doctor did that was like his 7th patient? And while I understand Florida, MIAMI has some bad reviews my surgery isn‚Äôt there but also like any other place around  the world someone is getting botched but there are more out of country botches than a couple in Florida. And it‚Äôs best to do research on them and see before and after pictures which I‚Äôve already seen a lot of my doctors work, and his reviews are amazing with photos of him and his patients smiling at their massage tables

That company has lots of offices, and there‚Äôs not just a couple in Florida, and it‚Äôs not just the same as other places. There‚Äôs lots. The law there is heavily in favour of surgeons. Surgeons go there when they get into trouble elsewhere so they can continue practicing medicine.

So every doctor there was in trouble so they moved? That‚Äôs interesting. But yes that company has multiple places in the world and I‚Äôve seen pretty good reviews not just in Florida. But as I said Florida isn‚Äôt the ONLY place where ppl get botched out of a lot of out of country doctors. I‚Äôve read about women going to DR and a lot passed away or some have gigantically oversized bbls, Thailand is great I hear but it doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have horror stories, there‚Äôs plenty more so it can‚Äôt just be ruled out that only Florida has bad doctors.
