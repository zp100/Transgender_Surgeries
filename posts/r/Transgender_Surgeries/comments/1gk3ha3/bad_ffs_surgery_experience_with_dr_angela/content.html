I hope so too thank you. It concerns me that she won‚Äôt give me my medical records, maybe there is something incriminating on them? I also forgot to mention that she failed to tell me that the operating room would be full of medical students to watch the surgery. So just really unpleasant all around

Sending you love and hoping you‚Äôre able to get a new provider that is able to help correct some of your issues. I, too, am looking for a surgeon in CA who can help fix some issues I had from my first round of FSS : /

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this üòû I have a question. This lower lip thing. Did the lip incompetence happen immediately after surgery or was it more and more difficult to keep your lips sealed as time went on?

I couldn‚Äôt really tell for a while after surgery because my lips were so swollen I couldn‚Äôt close them for ages. Then when I told her after a lot of swelling had gone down that I couldn‚Äôt close my mouth at rest, she said that because of the lip lift, my upper lip needed to ‚Äústretch back out‚Äù. As you can see in the photo though, it‚Äôs not my upper lip that‚Äôs the issue, it my lower lip which is both larger on one side, drooping and also partially numb still 2+ years after surgery
