Let me apologize in advance - -  absolutely no intention to cause you concern,  however I have some experience in orthopedic surgery techniques.  Others looking at those images should not leave with the impression that those represent the correct way for these Type III surgeries to be performed.  I am seriously concerned that the forehead bone grafts were not well or skillfully crafted and fitted - -  and you were left with some voids in the forehead bone that is under the very large mesh in the image.  That is the ONLY possible reason I can even begin to think of for a surgeon deciding it was appropriate to cover that whole area with a Titanium mesh - -  to cover defects in the integrity and continuity of the underlying frontal sinus bone structure.
</p>
<p>
If done properly,  the amount of metal hardware used for one of those Type III forehead re-constructions should be a tiny tiny fraction of what is evident in this image.  A very tine fraction.   You might get a 2nd opinion from another surgeon.    Hopefully,  the bone will grow and fill the voids over time,  and the mesh will protect your forehead while that process slowly takes place.   If you read Dr. O&#39;s FFS book,  you will see how these forehead reconstructions should look and the tiny amount of hardware that should be left behind.   None of those pictures in Dr. O&#39;s book even remotely resemble the scans you have posted.
</p>
<p>
You might get an opinion from another surgeon - -  maybe a craniofacial surgeon.  In the mean time, you might consider being especially careful to not incur any impact injuries to your forehead. Just my 2 cents worth.

Yes it looks weird but they told me it’s because the bone is thinner so it just doesn’t show on the ct scan.

If they&#39;re amputating the angle, as they did with you, then that&#39;s definitely not conservative by definition. A lot of surgeons wouldn&#39;t do that.

I think they can be quite aggressive, especially if you ask them to and I have seen some quite aggressive work from them.
</p>
<p>
Some people just have trouble managing their expectations. Or maybe they did not discuss what they wanted in enough detail prior to the surgery.

That’s a good question, about the utility of the mesh. I’m going to ask and get back to you on that! Thanks so much for sharing your story, this is obviously very interesting for people to see.  Nice little sliding genioolasty there too. I’m biased as I work for FT but those are some clean cuts there thanks to the customised 3D osteotomy cutting templates and ultrasonic instruments—have to say that this is mid-range aggressive from the cases I’ve seen. The team is capable, when desired by the patient AND safely indicated, of obtaining quite dramatic changes in the facial bone yet still within “natural-looking” parameters.

Hello everyone, sorry for the delay in getting back. Feedback from our team of surgeons (Maxillofacial/Plastic specialties):
</p>
<p>
The titanium mesh is utilized in the forehead reconstruction surgery when necessary to provide support to the operated structures. These materials have been utilized in craneofacial, neurosurgery and trauma surgery with great security for decades, with satisfactory outcomes on both short and long terms. There is practically zero risk of adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity and rejection. The mesh is an ultra fine material that is non-magnetic, meaning patients will have no problems in airports nor with MRI’s. FACIALTEAM has been utilizing medical grade titanium materials for nearly 15 years in surgical reconstructions of all types in over 1000 patients. No problems directly related to the use of titanium mesh, a very expensive material, have occurred.
</p>
<p>
The reasons some patients require the supportive mesh are, for example:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
To support defects or weak points in the bone generated during the surgery. To explain, in order to feminize the contours properly, a more profound bone volume reduction (more aggressive milling) is required to avoid incomplete or suboptimal results. The mesh is routinely utilized for patient safety, if extra support is deemed appropriate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To prevent potential aesthetic defects in the area that have been weakened after bone shaving. After many years of experience, we are able to detect the treated zones that have a greater risk of developing sunken areas—the mesh avoids this problem.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The quantity of mesh nor it’s position affect the final result. It also has no effect on the functioning of the sinus. Initially the team employed smaller portions of mesh, but after over a decade and nearly 3000 patients, prefer to protect the area more completely and increase the chance of natural results as the mesh adapts to the new anatomical shape. The forehead is a particularly delicate and highly visible area where any tiny imperfection becomes evident in time.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We hope this helps to dissipate any concern over the use of the mesh but would be happy to answer further questions on behalf of the team.

<p>
Not really.
<br>
Those images are very similar to ones previously posted here from one of the surgeons in S.America that was using metal mesh to cover the frontal sinus cavity.  There were some serious adverse outcomes using that &#34;technique&#34; reported here on Reddit and on Susan&#39;s.  As I understand the history of that,  he later quit doing that.
</p>
<p>
Also, those scans above appear to show voids in the bone behind the mesh.  From my reading of Dr. O&#39;s book,  there is really no good reason for that to happen, unless the surgeon used the bone burr and ground through the frontal sinus bone.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, again, not really.   If there are voids in the frontal sinus bone,  then the patient is at significantly increased risk of an infection under the forehead skin from contamination from the contents of the frontal sinus cavity.
</p>
<p>
The use of  that type of wide area metal mesh in a type III forehead surgery is a &#34;technique&#34; that is apparently only currently used by FT.

The large gaps in the bone coverage allow bacteria from the sinus cavity - -  (yeah... think of the same stuff that comes out of your nose when you sneeze) to be forced out and under the skin or the periosteum blood supply layer that covers the bone.    Thus, infections become a problem.  It also leaves your forehead subject to trauma from minor accidents that would otherwise be uneventful.
</p>
<p>
In order for the fracture lines in the bone to &#34;heal&#34;  there must be intimate contact with sufficient mating pressure so that there is no relative movement of the separate bone pieces.
</p>
<p>
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT MESH CLOSURE.  NO EXCUSE.  It is just lousy surgery technique by someone who was never trained to do craniofacial bone work - - where that kind of repair would get a resident canned from the program and sent back to general surgery for a year of remedial training.
</p>
<p>
Does that help ?

The way understood it though is that it isn&#39;t used to cover holes in bone, just thinner parts of it to assist in healing and strength. I don&#39;t see how that would be an issue if no parts of the sinus are exposed. Thin bone is often not visible on CT scans, so that would explain the appearance of a hole. Am I just completely off here?

I&#39;m not discrediting you or anything, but Facialteam is certified and accredited by Spanish and European healthcare organizations, you can find them here
<a href="https://facialteam.eu/facial-feminisation-surgeons/partners/" rel="nofollow">https://facialteam.eu/facial-feminisation-surgeons/partners/
</a>
. They also have very low complication rates compared to some other surgeons.  I would like to know more about what certification you have to make these statements. Its the first time I&#39;ve seen this kind of mesh applied by them myself, and I know its not common for them to do this (I&#39;ve looked at countless before and after CT scans). Not really trying to shill for them, this post is 4 months old, I would just like to get a better view of the situation.

UEMS – European Union of Medical Specialists That is the european equivalent of the ABMS (Am Brd of Medical Specialties). Go to the UEMS web site and try to make a matrix of board certifications obtained by the facial team members.
<br>
It is a pretty thin list.
</p>
<p>
A couple of years ago, I spent some time digging into this arcane subject and trying to figure out what the training background is of the various facial team members.  It is all a bit opaque due to terminology differences between Europe and N. America.  However, so far, I am unable to find any evidence that any one of the FT members actually completed a dedicated craniofacial fellowship or the european equivalent to that training.   (Caution do not confuse terminology like  &#34;maxillo-facial&#34;  with a &#34;craniofacial fellowship&#34;.   They are very different, although a lot of Ear Nose &amp; Throat - ENT doctors like to confuse the matter by use of that terminology. )
</p>
<p>
PS.   If you want to know more about my background,  send me  a  PM and will be glad to discuss that.
