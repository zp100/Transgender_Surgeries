Hello again, passed week 2 a couple of days ago! Been struggling a lot with the bigger dilator, I can&#39;t even seem to move around much without a lot of discomfort once it&#39;s fully in and putting it fully in requires a LOT of pressure and willpower, week 3 I&#39;ll have an even bigger dilator, can&#39;t say I&#39;m looking forward to that, but that being said the past few days it&#39;s been getting easier and easier so I guess I&#39;m doing it right :)
</p>
<p>
One thing that worried me is the stitches coming loose there below the vagina, looks like a massive open wound and feels like it too, but there&#39;s no bleeding or anything coming from it so just part of the process I guess, phoned the hospital about it and they just said this happens frequently and it&#39;ll heal on it&#39;s own so long as I keep cleaning it thoroughly (which I am!)
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask any questions!

Your result looks good! My comment isn’t medical advice as I’m not qualified but having gone through similar recently - wound dehiscence (stitches coming loose) just under vaginal canal is very common. My hospital recommenced manuka honey over night, and to keep the wound dry during day by using a hair dryer (clean the filter first) on the cold setting. This worked for me, although be prepared that healing will take time. Look after yourself and get lots of rest. It may be worth checking with the hospital if they also recommend manuka and a hair dryer, like mine did. My hospital was Parkside, London. Congrats on the surgery!

Yeah mine recommended a hair dryer too but my hair dryer is still pretty hot even on the coldest setting, is this because I didn&#39;t clean the filter?
</p>
<p>
Also I hate getting rest lol, I think this might be because I move around a lot in awkward ways and I stretch the areas quite a lot like I used to pre op, I guess I need to start taking it easy

The hospital is right but it needn&#39;t. I am sorry but that is a very poor result and the post op care you are being shown is totally inadequate

You don&#39;t know the full story of my &#34;post op care&#34;, I didn&#39;t put absolutely everything they&#39;re doing in this post, they&#39;ve actually supported me and given me the same advice everyone else has (you haven&#39;t given any advice by the way), so as I&#39;m actually curious could you go into more detail why this is a poor result and what could be done about it?

You need a revision, preferrably with a component surgeon not of NHS training.

The NHS doesn&#39;t train for or perform these surgeries..? I never even mentioned if this was privately funded or NHS funded, and can you go into more detail why you think this?
