Your lower jaw is /was recessed, you had a protrusive profile which was camoflauged by advancing your chin forward and perhaps up.
</p>
<p>
Because of your underlying structure you were already at a higher risk of sagging under the chin and neck area. If you had any issue with some under chin and neck ptosis prior to jaw contouring with a protrusive profile, depending on the aggressiveness of the jaw reduction you are only exacerbating it. Korean girls are a prime example when they recieve reductive DJS and or vline contouring they tend to complain of sagging under the chin and its common practice to offer thread lifts simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
Its like having a beautiful dress but it&#39;s a real showpiece and is massive, the coat hanger is wide and strong enough to support the gown when hanging. If someone replaces it with a smaller coat hanger you&#39;ll definitely see some folding and pleating. This is very common but most trans individuals are just happy about the reductive qualities they sometimes overlook the small amount of post operative sagging because well if they had a massive square jaw prior, at least now they wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s like the lesser evil honestly. Even if at certain angles they get a double chin.
</p>
<p>
I read that this surgeon performed the genioplasty without consent.. This is an issue that is lose lose honestly. The surgeon could have done that just alleviate  the sagging you may get post o.p. Unfortunately this can be seen as unwarranted so it&#39;s a more grey area. However ideally they should have forseen this and discussed it with you prior. He or she could have genuinely tried to help you not sag even more with the chin advancment. I can&#39;t say 100% for sure. Just know if it wasn&#39;t done, you&#39;d have more slack in that region and if they do move the segment back and fixate it you&#39;ll most likely get even MORE sagging..  If they removed a widget from the segment you&#39;ll need a bone grafting. Perhaps they can graft to augment your chin as well.
</p>
<p>
Step off deformity is common, many others have commented on this so I&#39;ll leave it alone. I hope you and your surgeon work this out.
</p>
<p>
To alleviate your sagging, you can get a thread lift or some people have some luck with radiofrequency treatments. You can also choose to lose more weight and bring the body fat down to alleviate but this method isn&#39;t always ideal as most people don&#39;t want to starve themselves or find this method unsustainable.
</p>
<p>
The trach shave is determined by how far your vocal chords sit out or if the surgeon used a reliable method to gauge what amount of reduction is deemed safe. Some surgeons attack this region as a quick hack and slash lol. This is quite a common topic amongst those to choose to get one.
</p>
<p>
Anothet poster mentioned swelling going down will help and yes it will decrease to a certain degree but you&#39;ll most likely still have sagging, it&#39;s just a byproduct of these proecedures.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

I love your example! People often are looking for such unrealistic expectations without realizing the limits and cons to every procedure. OP seems misinformed or uninformed about all the details they need to unfortunately, I now see why some surgeons have such a hard time dealing with patient expectations. However they do seem to be quite level headed as well (not mentioning surgeons name before revision etc).
</p>
<p>
Your surgeon really feminised your jaw! I&#39;m really wanting to as well but am asian and my jaw is recessed as well so I&#39;m consulting to consider orthognathic surgery and prepatory orthodontics to move the jaws forward and shorten the maxilla in anticipation of vline. Rhino might be indicated too if the nose gets upturned too much.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve come across one or two aquaintances in one or two of the circles I&#39;ve rotated in that used RF. The groups tend to be very surgery literate and informed as trans individuals so we can make the best choices given our situations and group share information.
</p>
<p>
From what I gather, in eastern countries more specifically korea thread lifts are much more common even if you&#39;re in your 20&#39;s but I feel like the societal acceptance for cosmetic surgery is higher and thus they practice more procedures that might be considered more fringe status to some western plastic surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Back to the topic of RF... The results was very minimal to say the least. The other person also didn&#39;t fine tune their expectations and ended up getting neck lift and facelift. Personally if I had the money to burn and had more sagging I would definitely do it but if money was more tight I&#39;d save up for more effective treatments. Happy new year!

1,I never said your jaw was masculine. 2, if you needed chin work why would you get jaw reduction? Not my business. 3, you can disagree with me on your profile. You&#39;re entitled to it but if you really want to know why not go to a professional maxilofacial surgeon?, im not interested in going back and forth with you cause you seem reactionally angry to anyone who disagrees with you. We all came here to offer you advice or support but if you&#39;re not interested in my words then ignore me!
</p>
<p>
Have a great day and hope you can feel better.

I had a sliding genioplasty with a slight forward advancement as part of FFS. It made a large reduction to my chin and definitely feminized my face, but now I have step-off on both sides where the horizontal slice of bone was removed for the T osteotomy. The chin is no longer wide enough to meet up with the rest of the jawline nicely, so there&#39;s a sudden shift in the contour on both sides of the chin. It&#39;s worse on one side and clearly visible at certain angles. I let it settle for over a year and it hasn&#39;t changed very much, so I&#39;ll be seeking a revision. I&#39;ll probably also need some type of facelift soon after for sagging.

If it wasn&#39;t pronounced at first , due to recession ... Theoretically reducing it would only make it even less pronounced no matter how you look at it as I mentioned in my previous response. A weak jaw and reduction isn&#39;t a good choice unless you counter with forward advancement either through orthognathic surgery or augmentation.
</p>
<p>
You most likely would have preffered  a small chin implant to pick up slack with jaw contouring and hilighting chin. Or even a filler to the chin to make a more projected and pointy chin without or without mandibular angle resectioning.
</p>
<p>
You could reverse it and get a facelift but you&#39;ll most likely needed one in 5-10 years again and the effects will be minimal around the neck vs targetting the cause or treating the afflicted area. You might benefit more from a neck lift. A face lift might change other things and make you even more irrtable considering you aren&#39;t aware of all the consequences for each process. Part og the surgeons role is to inform you however sometimes it gets lost during communication.
</p>
<p>
So no it wouldn&#39;t have &#34;worked&#34; you&#39;d still encounter sagging if you did only jaw contouring and if the surgeon didn&#39;t perform the genio you&#39;d probably complain about the sagging and the jaw reduction making you look about 10-15 years older from soft tissue ptosis. I&#39;m not tryiny to be mean here but you seem to be misinformed about how surgery fully works. There&#39;s pros and cons to every procedure. Consider my reccomendations in the previous body of text and have a good new year.

Sorry to hear about that! When was your surgery? Swelling in the lower face usually takes time to subside.

Hm, you could try have a high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment at a local clinic done to reduce sagginess. I used it to remove excess jaw skin after losing weight with decent results (
<a href="https://post.healthline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/High_Intensity_Focused_Ultrasound_face_lift_before_and_after-1296x728-gallery-1-1024x575.jpg">more dramatic results
</a>
). It&#39;s pretty affordable and quick compared to surgical procedures (~€200 last I had it).
</p>
<p>
Note that it can temporarily sever some nerves so you may lose a bit of sensation for a month or two; not much different from surgery.
</p>
<p>
You should probably wait for the swelling here to go down though before having HIFU.

You&#39;re totally valid in hating the look of your new chin. &lt;3 Bodies suck, and having surgeries where the outcomes should be roughly in line with what we&#39;re charged for and predicted, it&#39;s frustrating and soul sucking.
</p>
<p>
If your surgery was to make your chin and face feminine, that&#39;s an absolute success. As far as the other stuff you mentioned...I&#39;d have to look them up to know what you&#39;re talking about; like, I get the double chin thing, but it definitely makes you look more feminine as that&#39;s a feminine facial shape. I&#39;m certain lots of cis people have the same discomfort with their jawlines. (look at pics of sandra bullock, kirsten dunst, chrissy teigan, ariel winter) ...like, Angelina Jolie has the epitome of &#39;no double chin&#39;, but that&#39;s because she has a very, very masculine jaw line.
</p>
<p>
And your tracheal shave is barely visible, I think it&#39;s well within the bounds for an attractive feminine neck shape.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m def not saying you shouldn&#39;t fight to get the face and compensation you need, but I don&#39;t think anyone would fault you for keeping it as it is now. &lt;3

There’s going to be swelling for up to a year, and it’s pretty significant for the first 3 to 4 months. Please don’t be too down on yourself or your surgeon. You have to have patience. This is not your final form.

It&#39;s a flat scar just a slight blackening of my skin because my skin is really pale it&#39;s easier to see than tanned skin. I don&#39;t really care about it much nobody has ever commented on it and it&#39;ll be gone soon

A scar is different from an adams apple buldge. She clearly still has the buldge

no that will make her jaw masculine again. mewing is actually the worse thing you could do if you&#39;re trying to look more feminine. i tried it and it ruined my face (yes i did it properly), my face is back to how it was now thank god but ya don&#39;t recommend it for women seeking feminine appearance.

I don&#39;t even need to see eyes to know this is a female side profile. The skin beneath your chin is most likely still swollen. It takes a year or two to finish up the healing process. If you&#39;re on estrogen this could be quicker. I hear that helps with healing
