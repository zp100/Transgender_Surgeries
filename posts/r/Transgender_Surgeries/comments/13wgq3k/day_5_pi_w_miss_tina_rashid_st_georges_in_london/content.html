Congratulations on your surgery, well done on how you handled the challenges and good luck for your recovery!
</p>
<p>
Lots of swelling still there right now, she will only get better as this disapates. Your being super positive is sure to pay dividends during your recovery!
</p>
<p>
Good depth too!!

Btw there&#39;s a lot of self text on the post but for people who use RedReader or some other third party client it doesn&#39;t show up lol unless you hold on the title and go to properties or open it in your browser :P

Here&#39;s a copy of the text since Reddit confuses me:
</p>
<p>
Hello, bit nervous to post this but I&#39;m sitting here on day 6 just waiting to be discharged and thought I&#39;d share some of my experiences.
</p>
<p>
TR is amazing and the rest of the GRS team although I didn&#39;t see them that much, but I&#39;m 100% happy so far and feel lucky to have been referred to her!
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I got the catheter removed finally and the vaginal pack and it was so freeing! Being able to shower finally made me feel like a human being again and after after washing all the muck off my groin and stitches it&#39;s looking great down there üôÇ.
</p>
<p>
My first shower I wasn&#39;t really sure how to feel to be honest - it was still a bit tender down there and it&#39;s hard to avoid feeling a bit gross while it&#39;s still so swollen - but I felt a cool sense of relief nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
Nevermind that though as everything perked up after showering and I got some great pictures at night before falling asleep with the most intense gender euphoria I&#39;ve ever felt ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Review is: using the toilet is kind of gross, dilating is a bit uncomfortable, but it&#39;s so flat and cute down there dammit! And I definitely don&#39;t miss the previous bits lol.
</p>
<p>
As for recovery I was blessed with an easy time I think, no bleeding (except for minor dehiscence now I&#39;ve started dilating, d&#39;oh!!) or bruising, but a hell of a lot of swelling! The swelling is honestly crazy in the first few days and I can&#39;t wait for a few more days till it&#39;s down a tiny bit more and I can see inside more clearly. I tried asking for ice packs at some point but they weren&#39;t comfortable due to blood clot risks or something - but tbh I didn&#39;t need them anyway in the end. Just make sure you&#39;re getting given paracetamol and ibuprofen on the regular and ride it out and it gets surprisingly better pretty fast.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is fine so far actually, I&#39;m on my fourth dilation and the #2 (blue) soul source dilator is a bit tricky to accommodate but I can easily get to depth with the #1 (purple) one which I&#39;m happy about. I can only assume I&#39;ll arrive at a comfortable dilation routine at home since it should be more relaxing than this noisy shared ward.
</p>
<p>
Any questions about St George&#39;s feel free to ask or DM me - it&#39;s really not as bad as I expected except yeah a lot of variability in nursing staff and it helps to be fairly self directed to make sure you&#39;re getting the care you need as you need it. I was blessed with a fairly straightforward recovery in a side room for the first few days of recovery though which helps (doubt everyone gets this since there&#39;s not enough), it&#39;s pretty cramped otherwise but easily bearable and if you need any advice just ask  üòâ
</p>
<p>
I probably have a lot of tips and notes for people considering TR at St George&#39;s if it&#39;d be helpful along with more recovery pics if interested when I get home and I&#39;m over the fatigue from traveling. Tbh they are mostly quite similar but ridiculously more swollen though lol. It&#39;s just amazing to me that it all looks this good at day 6, and that I can go home with just otc painkillers in a few hours!!
</p>
<p>
Shout outs to

</a>
who saw TR at Parkside and supported me for a lot of this and kept me company in DMs ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Especially before surgery when I was flipping out and worrying about a bunch of stuff that didn&#39;t really end up mattering lol.

I‚Äôd like to get surgery done in the uk rather than travel. I feel like surgery in the uk would be a bit more expensive than abroad.  Was this a privet surgery or nhs?

I was lucky enough to be seen on the NHS although Tina does private too. From what I&#39;ve seen it used to be 15k but is over 20 now unfortunately. If you do go private though you&#39;ll get parkside instead of St George which is a fancy private hospital with private rooms :P. If you check out the wiki there&#39;s other TR results and some of the comments there talk about the private side of things üôÇ

That‚Äôs actually cheaper than I thought. I‚Äôm not going for depth so might be better off.
</p>
<p>
Still time to save but I‚Äôll keep this place in mind.

Yeah no problem feel free üôÇ hope the wait isn&#39;t too agonizing hehe.
</p>
<p>
To be honest I was blessed with good healing, and I&#39;m generally on top of things and did a lot of research so knew what was going on. I think if you were less confident about everything St George&#39;s would&#39;ve been a lot more scary so I understand why it has the reputation tbh. If anyone doesn&#39;t know what to do while in hospital or wants some reassurance about anything I&#39;m happy to chat about it in DMs any time since it was a bit of a learning curve for someone who&#39;d never been in hospital before üôÇ.
</p>
<p>
Brighton is probably quite a bit better but for St George the cons were basically: the nurses are a bit inconsistent (some shifts are amazing and preempt all your needs, and some you have to keep on top of everything a bit more and call them a lot using your call button); most of the beds are in kinda cramped bays in a shared ward, although I recovered in a side room for the first 3 days thankfully and if possible they do that but there&#39;s not many available; and yes the food is famously quite bland but I didn&#39;t really mind it and you can always opt for covenience-store-esque sandwiches and such if you don&#39;t fancy the meal options or get a visitor to supplement your meals if you have someone with you.
</p>
<p>
Tbh the first 3 or so days at least are a bit of a haze you mostly just want to sleep through, although I recommend bringing some passive entertainment and decent earphones you can lie down in for sure since I had my tablet on chill streams and videos for pretty much the whole week I was there. And after that you just need to do what you&#39;re told by the surgeon&#39;s team and otherwise rest basically so I found I didn&#39;t really need much except to call the nurse occasionally for water, pain relief and pads etc.
</p>
<p>
Anyway hopefully Brighton is a bit better and you&#39;ll be fine there. Good luck for surgery and hopefully it goes well. Feel free to DM if you want to ask for advice or share experiences etc üôÇ
