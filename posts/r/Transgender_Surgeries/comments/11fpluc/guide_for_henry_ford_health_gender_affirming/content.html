Has anyone seen how the results look from Henry Ford?  I&#39;m cautiously optimistic about them, but would love to actually see how the end results look.  Kind of scared to go with the relatively new unproven team, but at the same time, being able to convalescence at home would be really nice.

They haven&#39;t started giving dates for vaginoplasties yet
</del>
so it will be a while before we start to see results, aesthetic wise I would expect it to be similar to bluebond langner being that&#39;s where they trained and being the same technique. Time will tell but I&#39;m optimistic too, my orchiectomy went smoothly there but I&#39;m waiting to see some results and testimony before I go through with vaginoplasty there.
</p>
<p>
edit: glad to hear that they are offering surgery dates now!

It is not a there plenty of patients that are not happy with Dr Tepper’s concept of what a vagina is even though she worn one everyday of her life. When you get a consult with her, mine was a year ago she was extremely cold, not interested that she was there to give the consultation and just plain bored in the conversation.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Shakir was perfectly fine operating through my mesh hernia repair of my umbilical area and did not seem to care like my new surgeon that there would be serious complications if PPT was used so I have changed to PI with tunicus vaginalis.

how is your beef with FFS at ford related to SRS there? you keep posting about hernias preventing people from getting PPT, this is not true and every surgeon ive spoken to about it says otherwise. i have a congenital umbilical hernia that needed 3 operations to fix &amp; i am getting ppt w pariser. i consulted with ford, NYU, and two other places that only do ppt. who is telling you this stuff??

Let just say you WILL be operated on by a student seems Garcia-Rodriguez would rather teach than do any work. My forehead is bumpy, uneven and has depressions that everything be told me would be gone in a year! It’s been almost a year less than three weeks to go and they are still there. No brow bone or orbital contouring was done ( confirmed by a CT scan read by my new surgeon) also he is so worried that my forehead work that Garcia-Rodriguez’s student did will fall apart during the revision that a bone graft from the side of my skull will be required to repair me!!
</p>
<p>
Garcia-Rodriguez decided on her own during the procedure that doing my lip lift to my pre surgery agreement requirement (what I wanted my lips to look like) was not what she was going to do. So in post op she delightfully told she did not go as aggressively as I wanted because she did not want to give my “bimbo” lips!!!!
</p>
<p>
So while I was unconscious she changed my care plan that was not medically necessary to save my life. Just because SHE wanted to?!?!?  That is an egomaniacal narcissist!!

She also does not manage scar healing worth a damn!! I had scar bridging from the lip lift scar and the sutures looked like there were done by a 5 year old!! I have spent 1400 dollars doing CO2 laser resurfacing to reduce but not remove the extremely visible scarring she left me with!!!
</p>
<p>
She is a tank amateur and should not be teaching anyone how to do this kind of care!

If you go to the real self website and look her up you will only see a few people willing to post there results most still visibly trans including me. If you don’t have to do a lot of bone work and maybe mostly soft tissue you might be fine but if you need a type 3 she will fuck you up like she did me!! Permanent resting bitch face with a longhorn pattern due to messed up muscles in my forehead and extremely uneven due to depressions and high spots from the students unchecked work. She was basically sipping lattes while letting the student hack away!!

I would tell you go to U of M but truthfully I don’t trust anyone in Michigan!! If you still plan to continue with HF care make then put it all in writing and that you will not accept a student working on you. Don’t just have the put the codes as proof make them write exactly what they will do and if they deviate it needs to be medically necessary a not just because they did not want to make you look like a bimbo. For me I want my lips to be big, not to have someone decide that on the operating table when I could not consent.
</p>
<p>
I view my operation on Dec 13 2023 as medical rape!! No lawyer would represent me and Garcia-Rodriguez told me I had no right to criticize her work!!
</p>
<p>
I would walk, no run from her care as fast as I could!! She has cause me irreparable mental and physical harm. To repair just my face will cost me over 75,000 out of my pocket. No more insurance since it’s a one and done procedure that I had to also use a lawyer to get the insurance company to cover that hack job I received!!
</p>
<p>
Fuck Henry Ford Hospitals!!

Hi! I work for Henry Ford and wanted to clarify that we are currently offering dates for vaginoplasty, and have been doing primary and revision vaginoplasties since June 2022. Linked below is our updated vaginoplasty surgery guide :)
