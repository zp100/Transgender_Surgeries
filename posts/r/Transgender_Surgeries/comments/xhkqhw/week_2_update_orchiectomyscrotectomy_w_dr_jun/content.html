Posting another update because time has been going by slow and I&#39;m bored :p
</p>
<p>
All is going well. I had some minor bruising at the end of the stitch a few days ago but that has pretty much dissipated. I still have a decent amount of swelling but I feel like the pressure/pain from it has gone down significantly. I can successfully go up and down stairs without clinging to the handrail for dear life and I can do a whole 8hrs of sitting at my desk for work with minimal discomfort. I didn&#39;t realize how much the Orchi would effect my core strength/pain while using my core muscles. I can finally laugh and cough and sneeze without feeling like my insides are going to explode so that&#39;s good.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m probably part another update in a week or so. Feel free to comment or DM me of you have any questions.

Here are some

Edit - After talking to someone who is experiencing a seroma after their orchi, it sounds like I may be dealing with that too. The swelling in the area that used to house my scrotum was fluid filled a day or 2 after surgery and now it has developed into a solid lump. My surgeon said that it was very normal (as he poked around in it) and it will start to noticably subside 4-6 weeks post op and be just about gone after 6 months. After reading through a few papers (mostly veterinary but hey, a mammal&#39;s a mammal) it is suggested that no intervention is needed unless it is irritated or infected and it will subside on it&#39;s own.
