I&#39;m pretty self critical and I can definitely project that negative trait to scrutinize something/someone outside myself. As harsh as I can be, you sound like a cis female. Your narrative is at odds with the results I&#39;m hearing. If you want me to prove I&#39;m being harsh, then how about I say something negative like &#34;stop wasting my time!&#34; :P
</p>
<p>
You might be somewhat hyperfocussed on this. Take a step back and re-centre, or something else to do with crystals and bare feet. You sound like a cis female so gratz. :)

Thank you for adding some humor to the situation, it is really much appreciated right now.
</p>
<p>
I just dont hear it though. In recordings, when i speak. People respond to me as a woman, but it feels like there is always a question about it. I think they just respond because of my looks. And i feel i have validation and confirmation when Dr Thomas himself says he did not do enough.
</p>
<p>
I dont hear a woman my age. I dont sound like my peers. I sound as if i have doubled my age, which is sad. When you look in your 20s, but sound like you are in your 50s. It is depressing. And even more so when you hear others results. It feels like only a select few will get proper access….if they pass….and if your surgeon has questions about your passing, they just fuck it up on purpose so you can always be branded….labeled as trans. Or othered by people.
</p>
<p>
I need those good results. Three surgeries and these are my results….its not good enough. And any dr worth their pay should agree and do better.

Any perfectionist will tear themselves apart, including surgeons. Anyone can do better than their last attempt because they&#39;ve learned something from the process and now have data to make further informed decisions. No reputable professional will sabotage or undermine their own efforts to make the statement you describe.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not going to tell you to manage your expectations because that&#39;s patronizing and you seem to have a clear idea of what you&#39;re after. All I&#39;d say is that you should afford yourself some grace, really you owe it to yourself to be nicer to who and where you are right now. Past Girl-UnSure has come a really long way and Future Girl-Unsure is relying on you now to show some self-compassion.
</p>
<p>
What I&#39;m about to say isn&#39;t meant to make you feel bad but, at least you have a voice. There are people who never made it this far and there are those who have yet to come. I know you don&#39;t owe them anything but when you consider the fact that you have a human brain and one hell of a musical instrument, you can make it sound much closer to whatever you need it to be now. You&#39;ve got one of the most capable pieces of information processing tech in the known universe between your ears and the motivation to use it. One step at a time, rest for as long as you need then take another step. But yeah, zoom out for a few weeks. Do something relaxing and when you come back you&#39;ll be in a better frame of mind.
</p>
<p>
I know this is good advice because I never follow it and live in a constant struggle with my own neurosis.

Thank you. Your words have been really a lot more helpful than I thought anyones would be.
</p>
<p>
So…i did try to relax and be forgiving to myself. I took a 9 week cross country road trip (while working the whole time) seeing lots of nature and studying other skills to make me a more rounded person.
</p>
<p>
And…..(i want to be 100% honest) not once was i misgendered during this trip. 15 states. Countless small “red” towns.
</p>
<p>
Than i went up north for the weekend this past weekend to photograph the autumn leaves…..a park ranger….misgendered me….on my voice alone. My first time ive been misgendered since 2018. I was mortified. “Sir”. Ill never forget it. I knew i was not satisfied with my voice even before that. But…that sealed it for me. I cant have that happen ever again

The tragedy of the human experience is that we can have a hundred positive interactions in a day but we will only focus on the one which was &#34;less than ideal&#34;. Our imaginative faculties get hijacked all the time to blow up threat perception because as far as our primitive minds are concerned, that ranger (whoever the fk they are, let&#39;s call them &#39;ranger Bob&#39;) now represents the sum total of your efforts. That&#39;s not fair on you. :P
</p>
<p>
Bob is probably in a log cabin eating a sandwich right now. He&#39;s probably not thinking too much either and is at the evolutionary stage where he has to close his eyes to chew. His glasses are on the table and they&#39;re missing lenses. He&#39;s reaching up to his ear and pulling out his yellowing hearing aid (white seemed like a good colour at the time) which hasn&#39;t had batteries in them for the last six years.
</p>
<p>
There are so many variables at play, you can&#39;t account for all of them. Maybe you had a bad day and needed to hydrate, it&#39;s noth worth getting upset over. You need your higher order thinking for so much more interesting stuff.

Just…thank you. Everything youre saying is so much more comforting than i ever expected.
</p>
<p>
I posted this because i must get 4-5 messages daily asking me on my experience with Dr Thomas and how my revisions have gone. So i hope this provides some insight for those asking. Ill try again to process all of this with my therapist tomorrow during our EMDR session.
</p>
<p>
Thank you Zante

I didnt downvote you, but it seems the upvotes and downvotes disagree.
</p>
<p>
Most people voting seem to be leaning that surgery was a failure, and i dont sound like a woman. And that it was not a success, even based on Dr Thomass words in his email. I think they are voting and agreeing with me, but dont have the heart to come in and say flat out “yup, youre right. It failed. Give up. Stop trying. The dream is over. Youre unlucky, unlike me who sounds like Ariana Grandes and Mariah Careys love child. LOL SORRY HUN”.
</p>
<p>
Someone put me out of my misery please and just say what we all already know.

I see a therapist once a week. She is aware of my issues, and we have gone into more advanced therapies to relieve my traumas, as standard CBT therapy has not worked in years.
</p>
<p>
My combination of Dysphoria and dysmorphia is documented by friends family and my multiple therapists as one of the worst cases theyve seen. I dont really assume people have it easier, but i do see factually that many people have it easier when it comes to voice specifically. One and done surgery. Or training for a few months than BAM, amazing cis girl voice. Ive trained for years, literally. Documented. Been to dr thomas 3 separate times. I am not sure if people are not seeing his personal response above in my OP where even he says….after 3 surgeries, he still did not do enough.
</p>
<p>
My comments get repeated because sometimes it just feels like people are seeing me/hearing me, but not listening to what i am saying. Or dismissing it.
</p>
<p>
I understand it seems like i want everyone to agree with me. Thats not true though. But i want someone to agree with me. If the surgeon himself feels he did not do enough and classifies me as upper male range/lowest female range……that doesnt align with my body. My voice doesnt match me. And after countless work, hours, and personal finance which i cant totally afford….it hurts. A lot.
</p>
<p>
I know life is not dictated by social media. But i wish i could either believe the words you all are telling me, or someone can see Dr Thomass email and just say “youre right. Its not enough. You dont sound cis”.
</p>
<p>
I name celebrities because if i were to say these girls sound like Joanne Duncan, no one knows who that is. So celebrities are examples that can measured. Im not talking about singing. Im talking about purely speaking voices. Ariana Grande is not a celebrity because she sounds like a cis woman. But she is an example i can point to and say “how come i dont sound like her and instead sound like Michael Cera or a 65 yr old woman”. When i am more than half that age.
</p>
<p>
I understand what you are saying. I wish the steps id taken had helped. My therapist, my peers, my surgeon and results. If they did, i feel id be a much different person. But voice is the gateway to connecting with others, and without one i am confident in, or without one that matches my physical exterior, all feels hopeless. Especially after this many attempts and still knowing i am not where i need to be, where many of my peers are, and having the surgeon admit as such….hurts. And feels irreparable. This is not an attack on you, please dont take it that way. This is just an honest expression of my feelings and experiences

You should generally ignore votes on reddit. There’s people who come here who are not trans.

Id love for a shit load of people to come in here and confirm what i already know…that i spent a ton of money on a total failure, still sound like a man, and there is no fixing it because after 3 surgeries, somehow even the best VFS says he still hasnt “done enough”. So ill now always sound like a man or be constantly hug boxxed by friends, family and strangers…all because them lying to me and saying “you def sound cis female” is better to them than me just offing myself because of this failure. It makes me wonder if drs see people who dont 100% pass and say “lets fuck it up for them so they never pass now”, essentially giving them a scarlet letter, while only giving the best care and surgical techniques to the pretty ones who will def pass.
</p>
<p>
Awesome. So cool.

Thank you. I had a much higher pitch and good resonance before my initial surgeries. Now, my pitch has gone down. I have voice recordings to prove it. I cannot hit high notes that i could prior to surgery. But no one seems to care or just say “your blah blah semi tones higher”. Then why cant i hit the same notes as before on the higher end of the register? I don’t understand

Lol no. It bring you to Google drive permission. Tho you don’t want to make this or give access to it just like that. Maybe if you could put the recording somewhere else.
</p>
<p>
I’m just curious because I was actually considering going to see him. And I wanted to see your progression.

I think you can access it now. No wonder why im not getting any responses 🤦🏻‍♀️

<p>
But my past recordings are in previous posts so you can see my progress and then lack of progress. But basically if this surgery worked, it would have changed my life. Instead…it will probably end it

Hopefully you sound bright, vibrant, young and cis. Thanks, im sorry too. Because i dont sound like any of those things…well maybe cis…cis male.
</p>
<p>
This surgery can be life changing, or life ending, depending on your results and experiences with Dr Thomas i guess

Well i can describe it pretty well. I feel like slitting my own throat. Thats how i feel. I put in so much work and effort. So much. And its all for nothing. Even after this many tries.
</p>
<p>
And to have him say he didnt do enough, after three surgeries….how much is enough? Pretty girls seem to always get “enough” removed. But me? My first trans related surgery….this was supposed to tip the scales from probably passing to “ABSOLUTELY PASSING”.
</p>
<p>
And instead….im back in hiding. I dont want to talk to or meet new people. To experience new things. Listen to my voice. Who thinks this sounds cis female? Who think it even sounds feminine? Anyone…ANYONE can be feminine. But i dont want to sound feminine. I want to sound female.
</p>
<p>
My guess is you were already pretty and passing, and dr thomas did what he could to help accentuate that. Whereas for someone who may not pass 100%, Dr thomas probably just goes in, fucks it up on purpose so you never can pass now that he has scarred you, and just collects his money. And if you want to come back out….no worries, just give him more money. So he can do “enough”. Which just ends up not being enough still.

Ive had two already from him. Last June i spent almost $3500 for my revision with him….revision number 2. Only to be told “we didnt do enough” in my email from him that i linked in my OP.
</p>
<p>
Original Femlar &amp;Thyrohyoid elevation took place in November 2019. Revision 1 with laser took place in Oct 2020. Revision number 2 with surgical laser took place in June 2021. The aMaZiNg vOiCE you heard above…are my results.
</p>
<p>
And yet there are women who go see him, Ballesteros, Haben, Kim, ReMacle….and go from Thor to Ariana Grande in three weeks. I went from a somewhat passable cis womens voice to having a totally male voice because of him, without the vocal flexibility that allowed for my trained voice. Because he took that away.

To be honest your recording is 100 percent female sounding to me. Just a low woman&#39;s voice.

I disagree. It sounds male.
</p>
<p>
I need more. The womens voices i hear on Transvoice, or videos from recent VFSs on Facebook….they sound like women. I sound like a man playing make believe.
</p>
<p>
Im 5’6. Not 7’4. I sound more like the Hulk and less like Black Widow

Honestly the worst person to judge your voice is yourself. If you judge yourself compared to Angelina Jolie, everyone is ugly.  I understand if you feel differently. Maybe solicit some other opinions here.

Tbh, after 3 surgeries with Dr Thomas, and him telling me flat out i am STILL in the lower female range….after 3 surgeries and almost 20k OOP, and him saying “we should have removed more”. After three surgeries, somehow enough tissue still has not been removed. Do i have the worlds largest vocal cords, or does he need to be more aggressive in creating a woman’s voice.
</p>
<p>
Its not good enough. You sound better than me, after 1 surgery. Im young. Im not large. I shouldn’t sound like Hilary Clinton after eating 30 packs of cigarettes on a rough morning. I should sound like his other patients who come out sounding like young, bright, cis women. Not aged 30 yrs by my voice.
</p>
<p>
Maybe its my dysmorphia and dysphoria, but i dont sound female. I sound like a feminine gay male.

I think at some point operating on the same thing can cause more harm than good, but I understand your frustration. I get how you feel like you sound like a feminine gay male, but I just don&#39;t hear it like that (not trying to hugbox you), but maybe my opinion is just colored by the fact i expect to hear a woman.
</p>
<p>
In terms of my result, I have other issues like little volume, excessive mucus, and i have people constantly asking if i took up smoking now or have a cold so I think its a slot machine in some respects. The pitch turned out fantastic with the addition of my previous vocal training.
</p>
<p>
Just my 2 cents. Stay strong sister ♥️

Yours anatomy maybe the problem or how you heal. Even small women can have lower voices. Ever meet a cis woman with a bad case of PCOS?

What is your age btw? The good results seem to all be the younger. I didn’t listen to your clip yet btw.

According to Dr Thomas, when i asked this specific question to him when meeting him prior to any surgery’s, he said that was false that being younger provides better results, and that his website is only showing the people who chose to publicize their results. That a lot more women who are not 22 yrs old had amazing results, and just did not want to post the results on the website. So basically he told me flat out that age does not play much of a factor at all. While telling a friend of mine a yr later that age DOES play an impact. So at this point,idk if Dr Thomas sells snake oil or not.
</p>
<p>
Im sure people will dismiss me because i didnt get surgery at 19 3/4’s, but instead at 35. I didnt have insurance cover any ish, all OOP. Lots of us older huns seem to not be able to get anything covered by insurance. But what am i saying, Dr Thomas made certain i cant even qualify as a hun anymore. Maybe a mun, a man hun. Lol.
</p>
<p>
So yes, to answer the question that people can dismiss and say “oh thank god im not old like her at 35. She is just a blip in the system, a freak statistic, and MY surgery will go great, and ill sound just like Aubrey Plaza and the world will spin happily”….i had surgery at the youthful age of 35. As a non smoker, meaning someone who has never smoked a single cigarette in their entire life. But yet now sounds like a human cigarette.
</p>
<p>
Id play my recordings for people in the past, and would be told either “you sound great” (obviously a lie) or the other side of it “im so sorry” as if my children died in a clown hunting accident. A tragedy.

Surgery at a younger age is always better unless it is on a part that instill growing. Surgery always has risk as everyone says. I consulted with 5 fvs and all said keep on therapy and surgery only as a truly last resort.  My therapists at UCSD, UCLA, UCSf and more said only a few of their patients ever go fvs.

So youll be fine, since youre not an old hun like me, and as i said, come out sounding like Aubrey Plaza, or better. I was just too old and too manly, which even though Dr Thomas said was no big deal to me, you say otherwise. So is Dr Thomas a liar, or someone who doesnt know what they are doing? Or worse, someone who DOES know what they are doing?
</p>
<p>
I hope i could help dispel any fears you had. If youre young youll be great. Dr Thomas will do whatever he can to make sure you sound amazing.
</p>
<p>
If youre old though (35 is very old), its off to scarlet letter Hunville.

And tbh, at this point, the blame can fall on Dr Thomas. After three surgeries, to be told “we didnt remove enough tissue”, how?
</p>
<p>
No, my voice was more female before he did whatever he did to my voice. Its little to do with my healing. He sees women all the time and gives them beautiful, cis sounding voices. Not me though. No, I think its just some outside force telling me i wasnt meant to be a woman. My dreams were just that, dreams. Im not small enough, or pretty enough, or smart enough, or quick enough, or i dont sound like one, i dont look like one.
</p>
<p>
If it looks like a man, and quacks like a man, its probably a man. Thats me.
