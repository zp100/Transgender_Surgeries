Congrats you seem to be healing well. Happy to see other girl of coloring reaching euphoria. Is the purple dilater the second size up? For me the purple one is my size up.

It looks beautiful!
</p>
<p>
May I ask what method was used? I have Kaiser as well and I am in southern California. It is likely I might encounter this same doctor. Clearly, they are doing great work. I can not believe this is what you look like at 14 days!!

Yes!! I spoke with my GP and they said as much. But I didn&#39;t know it was happening. I am so happy for you and selfishly I am happy for myself as this is the method I prefer. All are good, but this is what was most comfortable for me.
</p>
<p>
Heal well, rest fully and THANK YOU so much for sharing and responding. I have a touch more hope now thanks to you :-)

Hi, sorry I know this is an old post, but were there any specific requirements you had to meet to be eligible for PPT? How did you bring up the conversation about PPT vs PIV?

Your results are amazing, congrats! Iâ€™m looking into Dr. Poh and her work looks great. What was your wait time and how long did you have to do hair removal for?

Wait time was pretty long because electrolysis took forever. I initially met with them Nov 2019 and did not have surgery till December 13 2022. Honestly part of that was because I switched jobs and moved and had to find a new electrolysis place. Part of it was because of the pandemic. I did hair removal for about 1 and 1/2 years. I have to imagine that it would be faster now. The biggest thing is not having hair on your genitals. It really helps with the process.

Guess Iâ€™ll just have to be patient. If I may ask which areas need to electrolysis for ppt? My electrologist is great and I have a high pain tolerance for my face and torso but Iâ€™m so nervous for srs prep

No hair on the shaft or balls and two inches around the scrotum all the way down to the top of the anus. It&#39;s kind of a lot tocne honest but I could do two and 1/2 hour sessions so really just depends on your pain tolerance a good numbing cream is key.
