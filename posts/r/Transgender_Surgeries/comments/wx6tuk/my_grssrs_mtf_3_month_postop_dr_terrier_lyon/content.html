Hello there. Here&#39;s a review of my vaginoplasty made by Dr Jean-Etienne Terrier in Lyon, France.
</p>
<p>
My surgery were made the May 9th, 2022. I didn&#39;t have any physical difficulties, but I was in a depression during a long time after my surgery. I&#39;m in a moderate obesity, but it wasn&#39;t a problem for the surgeon to have this vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s functional, I could have orgasm and I can feel sexual pleasure.
<br>
I think personally that my new sex is esthetical. And, even if I were depressed after the surgery, I&#39;m happy right now with what I have.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me :)
</p>

Congrats. Yours are the only post-op result for your surgeon that have been posted as far as I&#39;m aware. It would help others in the future if you didn&#39;t delete them.
</p>
<p>
What depth did you get?

Thank you so much :)
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t actually know the depth of my vagina, I&#39;ll ask my surgeon the next time I&#39;ll see him :)

So I asked him and he told me that it&#39;s the size of my last dilator for my dilatations, so I thing that it&#39;s between 13cm or 16 cm :)

Congrats!  You look great and I&#39;m pleased that all is working.  I&#39;m in the very early stages of thinking about vaginoplasty/labiaplasty.

In my experience, I had my first appointment in the end of June 2020, my file has been validated by my surgeon&#39;s team in February 2021 and after my file validated I&#39;ve been on a waiting list and I had to wait until the May 9th 2022 to have my surgery.
</p>
<p>
I think now it&#39;s about one and a half year between the validation of the file and the surgery, right now. But I&#39;m unsure.
