My doctor should answer these kind of questions, but they explicitly told me to ask them a LOT less questions, so I&#39;m refraining...

No. You should not. Keep a strict low residue diet for at least 2 months, preferably 3 or 4 months. I had colon SRS too, 4 years ago.
</p>
<p>
Google search for ‚Äúlow residue diet‚Äù. This is common for people who get any kind of colon resection surgeries. Do research on any number of colon resection surgery discussion forums on the internet for advice on aftercare. Colon SRS is in many ways the same as cis people getting colon surgeries. Follow similar aftercare instructions

Whaat??? Three months i would go insane. My doc said 10 days after release, so 20 days after surgery. You really are low residue diet for 3 months?! How was your stool? Did you get one? I&#39;ve been cheating since day 14 to be honest with small stuff. I have a strange feeling in my stomach, but i don&#39;t imagine it&#39;s from that. I hope not, but just to be sure, i guess I&#39;ll get a colonoscopy when i get back home, to make sure the colon looks ok. Thanks for the advice

As I said, a colon SRS is basically a colon resection surgery, because you‚Äôre removing part of your colon. Do your own research on colon resection recoveries and the recommended duration of low residue diets. Then remember that it‚Äôs always better to err on the side of caution when recovering from major surgery.

Good advice. It&#39;s something I haven&#39;t heard and obviously something people should be aware of at a minimum.

I think when it comes on to diet your doctor SHOULD be the one to answer.  Why did they ask you to ask a lot less questions? Did you already have surgery or are you planning on having surgery?

I thought it was implied from the title, but now i realise i wasn&#39;t ü§£ yes, there weeks ago. And apparently, i asked them to many questions already. I was hoping for personal experience, from someone who went through this. I can&#39;t imagine our bodies are so different that one orange would change everything

The thing about it is different doctors use different standards of care. To me srs is a serious surgery and you need to be clear in the aftercare, inclusive of the diet. Maybe write him an email asking for diet tips, what you should and shouldn‚Äôt eat. Didn‚Äôt he discuss this with you at your pre-OP consultation? In the internet people can give you good and bad advice and since you wouldn‚Äôt be able to differentiate the doctor and his team would be the best to answer certain questions.

Sorry, I got the impression, that it was just a suggestion that you ask less questions, not necessarily a rule.
</p>
<p>
The problem here is all the contributing factors that could play into eating a simple orange that of which we have zero knowledge. And I mean, everything from med interactions to allergies. Heck someone could ask about eating peanuts, and we could end up killing them. Not on purpose of course.

Yes, of course you&#39;re right. To put things into perspective: i don&#39;t have any allergies, especially not to oranges. I&#39;ve been allowed to eat anything for two days already, but i guess i was looking for a permission more than an advice. From what they said in their release papers, after 10 days from release, i can eat anything, and an orange is anything. I&#39;m just afraid its acidic and what would happen to my bowls from that acid

I agree with all the ask your doctor comments, because simply your question is too general, and lacks specific personal considerations that are detrimental to making the right conclusions.  Go with what they say, they have the experience on the matter.
</p>
<p>
Besides that, if you were to look at the subject
<em>
in parallel
</em>
with your doc&#39;s advice, there is such a thing as dietary intestinal inflammation index.  There used to be in IF Rating system which fell out of favour, which helped me track down issues with my intestine, I had terrible inflammation, leaky colon essentially, that led to all hosts of problems on &#34;the tail end&#34; of things for several years, very painful stuff.  For me it came down to grape seed oil which I started using for cooking food instead of olive and other oils that are usually used.  It was a bit of a fad I got caught up in unfortunately.  I finally discovered that grape seed oil had a terrible bowel irritation index.  Once I excluded that, years of pain and suffering vanished in just a couple of weeks like they never happened.  This is not meant to answer your question about oranges specifically, but a general diet suggestion.  When you have issues with bowel irritation, which often results in intestinal oversecretions, which would be relevant for sigmoid flap vaginoplasty healing and upkeeo, but not over or above any proper medical advice, looking through proper published studies on inflamation ratings of various foods and ingredients might help with proper diet selection to avoid issues like this.  I think the current systems in place switched from IF rating, to something called DII and a couple others.  Each system includes combinations of various factors such as glycemic influence, antioxidant potential, other inflamation markers, etc. to different extent. They&#39;ll have tables for ingredients vs inflamation ratings for them (either positive or negative numbers, relatively, which give you a hint for inflamation reducing or stimulating potential of those foods).  Might be worth looking into.  In general.  In addition to proper medical advice.

I can‚Äôt imagine why not. I was allowed to eat soft food as soon as I woke up. I was told I could go back to a relatively normal diet after just a few days. I had no dietary restrictions once I was able to have bowel movements. Why you wouldn‚Äôt be able to eat an orange after weeks and weeks I cannot imagine. Does your doctor have you on a bizarre and restrictive diet? if not, then I would eat whatever you wanted.

No they don&#39;t. I had colon vaginoplasty, so i guess maybe this was the reason for the extended denial of food ü§£ but since yesterday I&#39;ve started the &#34;eat anything&#34; period, just that I&#39;m afraid that oranges are acidic
