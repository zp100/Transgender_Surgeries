Hi all! I&#39;ve lurked in the subreddit for a long while - it&#39;s been a big help as I&#39;ve tried to navigate confusing medical systems even though I don&#39;t use Reddit that often! I figured I would post my 1 year post-op photos and my narrative about my experience, in case it helps anyone else in the Boston/New England area with any part of their transition!
</p>
<p>
So to start, about me! I&#39;m AMAB and identify as nonbinary-masculine. I use he/him pronouns and have not changed my name or gender marker, as I am comfortable with both. I initially struggled with my gender identity and presentation back in undergrad, around 2012 or so. I was also struggling with my sexuality and did not yet have the language or knowledge of nonbinary identities, so I considering a strict binary MtF transition at the time. I realized this was wrong for me and, due to several factors, backed away before any medical intervention. I later came out as gay in 2016 after coming to terms with how different masculine bodies could present and where I fit into that (it originally felt like &#34;choose one: bear, twink, or hunk&#34; and I was none of the above).
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to 2018 or so and I started exploring the idea of having breasts through stories and artwork. This gave me
<em>
intense
</em>
feelings of gender euphoria whereas my flat chest was &#34;neutral&#34; at best. I began therapy focusing on my gender identity and eventually started seeking medical intervention, weighing a limited run of hormones (estrogen), surgery, or a combination. As I did not wish to have any of the feminization results of estrogen, I eventually opted for surgery. That process is detailed below:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TL;DR: I&#39;m a gay nonbinary man with breasts and a lot of chest hair. Keep that in mind when looking at the photos!
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had a plastic surgery consultation for breast augmentation with Dr. Jaromir Slama on April 26, 2021. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t recall exactly when I had started the referral process, but I do recall it was approximately 2 months before I was able to be seen for the consultation. In the meantime, I had consultations with both a urologist (Dr. Robert Oates) and an endocrinologist (Dr. Katherine Modzelewski) to help me make more informed decisions on surgery vs. hormones. My meeting with Dr. Modzelewski was instrumental in me deciding on a surgery route, further buttressed by my meeting with Dr. Slama. For further information, I was on a Blue Cross of MA PPO plan through my employer at the time, with a $250 deductible. I received a particular discount by going through Boston Medical Center for any of my healthcare.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Consultation with Dr. Jaromir Slama, 4/26/2021
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was immediately put at ease by Dr. Slama and his staff. I was first met by a Physician&#39;s Assistant who helped me understand a lot more about the procedure, helped me find a size that would suit me, and answered many of my questions. At least for me, I was getting a sub-glandular implant (on top of the pectoral muscle) and we ended up with a 500cc implant (note, this was changed later). At this time, I was somewhat concerned with being able to &#34;go stealth&#34; in certain situations and was not yet out to many of my friends and family, so I was asking for &#34;proportionally small&#34; and felt the 500cc might be a bit big. I did not bring a bra to try sizes on and regretted not doing so at the time. Luckily, my turtleneck was just tight enough to allow me to try the implants regardless.
</p>
<p>
When I met with Dr. Slama, I was further put at ease - his bedside manner is excellent as he is incredibly informative, but very conversational. He was able to demonstrate to me how the implants behave when under extreme pressure, squeezing one of the size testers to an extreme degree without any rupture or signs of stress. The implants are silicone gel style - &#34;gummy bear&#34; implants, I believe. I reiterated a phrase the endocrinologist, Dr. Modzelewski, had told me - that he &#34;is an artist.&#34; He vehemently disagreed with that statement, affirming that his goal was to help produce a result that felt and looked natural
<em>
to me
</em>
. This commitment to &#34;bringing you out&#34; through surgery rather than achieving a specific aesthetic result made me feel even better about working with him.
</p>
<p>
After the consultation, I did receive insurance approval, but it was for a date in May of 2021. I was nervous that this was my surgery date and that &#34;a decision&#34; would need to be made by that point (more on this later). I was informed by the surgeon&#39;s office that this was an insurance placeholder date and would be easily changed when my actual surgery was scheduled.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TL;DR: Dr. Slama and his PAs were wonderful to work with, very informative, and very much in tune with &#34;bringing you out&#34; rather than achieving a specific aesthetic result, which I appreciated.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The interim
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I can&#39;t remember exactly when I was contacted to schedule my surgery date. I believe it was in late 2021 and I was offered dates in March of 2022. I eventually settled on March 15, 2022.
</p>
<p>
By January of 2022, I was still feeling &#34;undecided,&#34; concerned that this would negatively impact my social life and career to the point of regular anxiety attacks. It was then that I discovered one of the few men/masculine presenting people I knew of that had implants was in a field very closely related to mine (academia), which was the tipping point for me to decide to go through with the surgery. I came out to my mother that weekend (wonderfully accepting, I&#39;m so thankful &lt;3) and finally began to wear breast forms regularly to help socialize (this was partially possible as I am also an amateur drag queen and had bras and silicone breast forms on hand).
</p>
<p>
In late February of 2022, I began awaiting insurance approval quite anxiously. About one week before surgery, I began to panic that I would not have coverage for the operation and wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it out of pocket. Through a series of snafus by the surgeon&#39;s office, I called my insurance in a panic, finding out right there and then that my surgery was approved for coverage. I printed a copy of the approval letter, received a copy in the mail, and kept two PDFs saved on different computers, just in case!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Important point: I was then informed that BCBS of MA has a trans health hotline and &#34;concierge service&#34; for their trans members. You are connected to agents that know more about their trans coverage policies than most agents.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TL;DR: Insurance scares almost made me pull out, but BCBS of MA actually has a team that helps with trans patients.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The date of surgery, 3/15/2022
</strong>
</p>
<p>
After following all pre-op instructions (I hate lemon-lime gatorade now), I arrived a little early for my intake in the morning, as I was one of the first surgeries of the day. Things went smoothly and I was rather quickly taken in to the pre-op area. Some more of the basic surgical process was explained to me, as well as anesthesia and how coming out of it might feel. The nurse taking care of me was
<em>
incredibly
</em>
nice and supportive, keeping me plenty of company with light chatting throughout.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Slama came in at one point to mark up my chest, determining that he would prefer slightly bigger implants than originally suggested during my consultation for a more natural looking result. He suggested 550cc implants and, now far more &#34;out and proud,&#34; I told him to go with what he thought was best for a natural appearance. He was a big more &#39;strictly business&#39; this time around, but the room was already &#39;in and out&#39; for many of the practitioners.
</p>
<p>
I was then wheeled into the OR (surprisingly dull little rooms - I was expecting a bigger space with a viewing gallery and all - Grey&#39;s Anatomy lied to me!) and put up onto the table. I made a teensy bit more smalltalk with everyone, including asking Dr. Slama what music he likes to listen to (I spotted an iHome and iPod in the corner - classic country like Dolly and Cash) and joking about it being the Ides of March. I was then given the anesthesia and quickly nodded off.
</p>
<p>
Waking up was a pretty emotional experience, especially seeing my chest. I had a nurse rush in to make sure everything was okay and was comforted while I happy-cried a little. My time in the post-op area was pretty brief, as I was given a baggie of medications, then brought to the entrance to be picked up by my mother and boyfriend. Pain was nonexistent at this point, though I was rather uncomfortable and things felt tight.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TL;DR: Surgery was pretty quick and straightforward. BMC staff were very kind and supportive. Good vibes all around!
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I took 6 weeks off of work to start, then quickly raised that to 8 weeks on the advice of the nurse practitioner with Dr. Slama&#39;s office. I spent almost two of those weeks at my parents&#39;, especially as they had a motorized reclining sofa I slept on. I slept a LOT and very intermittently. Anesthesia and surgery both can also slow down your metabolism a lot, so I ate very little to get &#34;full&#34; and it took almost 3 days for me to pass stool. I was assured this was normal.
</p>
<p>
Pain was pretty minor throughout, mostly centered around the incisions on the undersides of my breasts. I used oxycodone for just 3 days before switching entirely to Tylenol and muscle relaxers for pain management. The chief complaint I had was a feeling of tightness in my chest and not being able to meaningfully shower for a week. I was also not allowed to sleep on my side &#34;until it was comfortable&#34; and I could get up without using my pectoral muscles - this was the chief reason for staying with my parents so long.
</p>
<p>
I had my 1 week checkup on 3/22/22 in Boston with another of Dr. Slama&#39;s PAs. She was wonderful and helped remove all my bandages, allowing me to see my chest bare for the first time (this was a really affirming moment, won&#39;t lie). Everything was pretty tight and kinda seemed like it was shrink wrapped. Since I had very little breast tissue before, having never been on estrogen, I imagine this was slightly exaggerated to most transfeminine people&#39;s results. I still had to wear the surgical bra I was given, or an otherwise high-support sports bra.
</p>
<p>
I had a ~1 month checkup on 4/28/2022, this time with Dr. Slama himself. He seemed pretty satisfied with the result, though he did note that my nipples were pointed a little outward. This was due to not having much breast tissue beforehand, but wasn&#39;t a big issue for either of us. At this point I was allowed to wear normal bras, though I opted to continue wearing sports bras for the most part (they&#39;re easy). He took pictures of my results for his before/after, then I was sent on my way!
</p>
<p>
Since then, 1 year later, I&#39;ve had almost no complications at all - a slight bit of implant rippling on the insides by my sternum, but it&#39;s minor and you&#39;ll only notice it when you feel the area. They&#39;ve both &#34;dropped and fluffed&#34; really nicely in a way that hides any remaining scar tissue, which has also healed and faded nicely (I used some silicone scar strips/gel to help promote that fading). I still have feeling in my nipples (it took a few months to regain this) and much of my breasts, though near the incision and right in the center of both breasts still have no sensation other than pressure.
</p>
<p>
In the end, my insurance covered the procedure without issue and I only had to pay the $250 deductible, which was covered by a prepaid card my former employer gave me every year.
</p>
<p>
1 year later, I do not regret this decision
<em>
at all
</em>
and was so happy I had a great team of people to help me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TL;DR: It was great, I feel great, and BMC/Dr. Slama are great to work with, at least for top surgery!
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m considering bottom surgery options now and BMC is on my list - partially because they&#39;re in network (I&#39;m on a BCBS HMO now, blech) and because of my great experience with them before. Finding information and seeing results of Dr. Slama/Dr. Oates&#39; work seems to be few and far-between on this subreddit, though - so I&#39;ll likely be asking more about that in the coming days!
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a link to the photos on an Imgur album! I&#39;ve tried to organize them chronologically and while I have very &#39;clinical&#39; photos from now, I apologize for not having better photos throughout the process!

Hi! Thank you for the awesome in-depth review! I have a consultation with Dr. Sláma in about a month and a half. Did he offer you only over the muscle for the implant, or was under the muscle available as well?

I did ask about differences between the two, but we both agreed that above the muscle was best since I am actively weightlifting for exercise and sub-muscular can have complications due to that kind of movement/pressure over time (migrating implants, for example). I can&#39;t say
<em>
for sure
</em>
that he doesn&#39;t offer it, but I will say that it was presented to me as the default. Since it was something I was already mostly decided on, I didn&#39;t question it further.
</p>
<p>
Sorry I don&#39;t have better information for you, but I hope you have a good consultation with him!

Thank you! The office said he does both, but I have a friend who went to a different place who said they told her the surgeon does both, and was only given one option when she got there. I was wondering if this was the same sort of thing. Did the office show you a lot of pictures of results from others prior to surgery?

It could be a matter of your activity levels and physiology too - definitely bring it up when you meet with him/the PAs!
</p>
<p>
They showed me a LOT of pictures, absolutely. Since they tried to help size me there, he did take special care to show a couple pictures of people with similar sized implants and chests.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m definitely curious if my pictures are in that slideshow now! I will say that they took pictures at just over 1 month post-op, so mine weren&#39;t as dropped and fluffed as they are now.

Oh, lol. Good point about the pictures only being taken at postop visits. 🤦‍♀️

Thanks for the thorough review. It makes me feel better about my upcoming visit.

Thank you! I really hope that it’s something they’re open to. Do you recall if they showed any pictures of recoveries that were a number of years out? Like say 5+?
</p>
<p>
It’s definitely great to hear that his office is so affirming though

I don&#39;t recall any of the pictures having dates associated with them for the before and after. Since they only have the two followup appointments (1 week and ~1 month), I&#39;m guessing they don&#39;t have any from that far out from healing, but it&#39;s worth asking about!
</p>
<p>
The office was just so lovely to work with! It was one of the reasons I wanted to post about this, since I saw very little about Dr. Slama on here so far!

How soon were you able to book your surgery date? Like how many months did you have to wait from the consultation? Did he not have you start out with an expander? Do you have any pictures ur willing to share? The links are dead.

Looks like Imgur won&#39;t let me share the album anymore, crud.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve added a google drive link that should help! There aren&#39;t as many captions, but all the pics are labeled by date, so you can see how things progressed.
</p>
<p>
As for dates, I had my consultation at the end of April 2021, then had surgery in March of 2022, so it was about 11 months total. Expanders were never mentioned, as I believe he thought I would take the surgery well (and I daresay he was right!)
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps :)

Okay thanks for your info! I’m basically flat chested, my breasts are so small. I consulted with a doctor at MGH and he wants to do expanders first and then a second surgery in two months to replace with implants. I feel like it could be worthwhile to see what Dr. Salma says too.

Can&#39;t hurt to get a second opinion, absolutely!
</p>
<p>
Each person&#39;s chest is different, of course, but I had no breast growth before (not on E) and think I might have been fine just &#39;cause I&#39;m a little larger anyway!
</p>
<p>
Best of luck! :)
