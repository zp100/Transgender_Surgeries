Okay so to preface: Dr Sutin is absolutely incredible and I still fully recommend him. Shit happens, I’m just documenting everything so people know what to expect, and
<em>
something
</em>
going wrong is an inevitability, no recovery is perfect.
</p>
<p>
Alright getting that out of the way, things have been going really, really, really well with my recovery. Like I mentioned, no recovery is perfect and I knew something was bound to happen eventually, and it did.
</p>
<p>
I take full responsibility, Dr Sutin said I should be ready to size up in dilation by the 1 month mark, I’m just over 3 weeks, but I wanted to see where I was at. I just got the Soul Source large set, and size 2 was very tapered so I wanted to see how far I could get it in, didn’t intend for a full dilation session, just to see if I could take it.
</p>
<p>
Well it hurt and I only made it to the first dot. As I was taking the condom off, I felt a TON of lube coming out. Way more than I expected. Way more than I used….
</p>
<p>
Yeah it was blood. I shuffled to the toilet (gotta figure out how to get blood drops out of the carpet now), and bled. And bled. And bled. It felt like a full cup of blood (okay maybe a few tablespoons in hindsight, one on the pad, some drops on the floor, and one or two in the toilet), and like it took forever to stop. It did eventually, and stringy coagulated blood was coming out too. Scary shit.
</p>
<p>
I told my liaison what happened (if you’re reading this Charee, you’re amazing), she responded very quickly, considering that it was 8 or 9PM at night at the time in Thailand, called me down, told me it was likely a popped stitch and to stick with the small dilator for 2 more weeks.
</p>
<p>
The bleeding went down throughout the day, and my second session this evening had no blood, as if the morning incident never happened. It also was the most painless dilation session, I don’t know if the bigger dilator loosened things or if I was just so gentle because I was terrified of ripping open again, but at the 3 inch mark it’s very difficult to get past normally. I’ll count it as a win! Here’s hoping the bleeding won’t happen again!
</p>
<p>
Lessons learned:
</p>
<p>
The curved soul source dilators aren’t for me. At least not for now; the curve is difficult to get in and is more uncomfortable, and harder to reach depth. The bigger ones are less curved, so I’ll use the two straight dilators PAI gave me and only use the soul source for sizes 3 and 4 (green and big orange).
</p>
<p>
Don’t size up too early! I clearly was overly confident, and not ready.
</p>
<p>
Something is always gonna go wrong, but it’s not the end of the world. I survived my first major post-dilation bleeding (outside of that first week), and the next session was less painful. Does it suck? Yes. Is it the end of the world? No
</p>
<p>
Miscellaneous stuff:
</p>
<p>
Sensation in the clit is really coming back and she’s quite a diva. Lots of lightning bolts both in the clit and labia minora, and having been circumcised initially, I’m not used to the sensation of my glans being covered and I’m starting to actually feel the clitoral hood covering my clitoris, which is uncomfortable
</p>
<p>
Swelling is going down at an exponential rate, and my labia minora is evening out nicely. Every day I look and am amazed at how good she looks!
</p>
<p>
The yellow fibrin is almost all gone from what’s visible externally (still have some yellow discharge so there’s probably some in the back), and the scurf (dead white skin cells, think dandruff) on the clit is coming off fast
</p>
<p>
I’m getting the hang of the muscle control. Slowly but surely. I’m having to actually flex my pelvic floor muscles to get some of the liquid when I douche out, and it’s satisfying to know I’ve got that control. Still trying to work out the differences between peeing, pooping, and flexing the vaginal muscles, but I’m getting better!
</p>
<p>
Overall, I’m still happy with everything, the bleeding was scary but manageable, and everyone at PAI and Estetica Thailandia have been absolute gems!

The painless 2nd dilation is what makes me wonder, what if the pain was caused by a pocket of blood being stuck somewhere inside and bursting it out actually made things better?

Glad all is ok.  I started on the #2 dilator this morning (I did a month of 1, and 2 weeks of 1.5).  I also used 1.5 for 15 minutes before changing to #2 and that worked a treat.

Similar thing happened to me, except it was trying to put the dilator in at the wrong angle. I just had to keep taking it easy and it healed fine
