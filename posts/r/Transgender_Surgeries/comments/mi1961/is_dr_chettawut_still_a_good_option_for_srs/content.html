I posted about an year ago about getting a date for SRS with him. And the responses I got were really positive on here. But I&#39;ve seen one post (I don&#39;t quite remember which one anymore) where they said he wasn&#39;t a good surgeon and didn&#39;t treat patients right.
</p>
<p>
For the past 15 minutes I&#39;ve been searching through this subs wiki and I can&#39;t find anything on him. Maybe I&#39;m too dumb to navigate through it lol.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, is he a good option? or are there better options in Thailand?

Chettawut is a great surgeon in my opinion, i’m travelling to him in June who’s having SRS and i’m having a cosmetic revision.
</p>
<p>
I honestly wouldn’t be put off by the odd negative review because you can’t make everybody happy.

I had a bad result, and im still trying to wok out a suitable revision 7 years later.  you can look through my posts. I went cause an irl friend went and had a great result, and in 2014 in-person recommendations were unfortunately one of the best things to go off of because there wasn&#39;t too many resources on the internet (this wiki is amazing).
</p>
<p>
IMO from my experience and from what I read on here, he&#39;s more inconsistent than average big-name surgeons. That&#39;s bad cause you don&#39;t know what to expect.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Also in my experience, Chett won&#39;t help with things you think are issues, and even things that are very blatant function issues (like urination for me), he&#39;ll hand-wave away, which makes it harrder to get any surgeon to fix since you don&#39;t even know the cause because Chett often doesn&#39;t  acknowledge or identify it.

Same experience as the other girl. 6 years later and I&#39;m still trying to find someone for a revision.
</p>
<p>
Even after all this time I still find it difficult to forgive myself for going to him and getting butchered. My transition was perfect up until that point where he ruined my life.
</p>
<p>
Sadly in 2015 there were no resources other than word of mouth. And all the word of mouth reviews were great.
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s just money that you&#39;re concerned about, then I&#39;d heavily advice you to save up more and go for Dr Bank instead.

chettawut operates at a different location now so i suspect everything to be alot different.
</p>
<p>
writing bad reviews that happened 6-7 years ago terrifies others including me even tho rationally that&#39;s a very long time ago and alot of things might have changed.
</p>
<p>
recently i read only good reviews about chettawut both in the past and current times. but yours is the first bad SRS review i come accross.
</p>
<p>
can you give more in depth detail as to how you think you where butchered? was it a lack of material or other complications etc? please add more details instead of blatantly badmouthing a top surgeon.
