I&#39;m looking into going with Dr. Rumer for my GRS surgery.  I was looking at the Papillon Center, but they don&#39;t a accept insurance neither does Dr. Gallagher in Miami.  2 on my list of possible surgeons I crossed off. Thoughts and reviews about Dr. Rumer.  I didn&#39;t see much about her in ways of reviews on Google.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Edit
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not going to go to either of the Dr&#39;s I mentioned above now.
</p>
<p>
Likely going to go to Dr. Bluebond-Langner or Dr. Ferrando. Now I&#39;m also researching Dr. Wittenberg.

Do NOT go with Rumer! Search &#39;Rumer&#39; on this sub, ANOTHER botched surgery patient posted here just yesterday. She is notorious for botching patients and gaslighting them about their results.

So I&#39;ll be taking Dr. Rumer off the list.   I&#39;ll follow up with Dr. Cecile Ferrando and Dr. Bluebond-Lagner. I&#39;ve heard good things about those two.

Ting is a good egg.  He fixed Kathy&#39;s fuckups.   He does NOT like her... even surgeons who have worked closely with her in Fellowship don&#39;t like her either.    Ruin me Rumer has more enemies in the medical field than allies.

Generally speaking, she is not well liked and is known for poor work and even worse follow up.

Dr Rumer is really really bad at her craft. I had a friend who got a BA and SRS and FFS with her. She needed a revision for all three of her surgeries. Do not risk it, Kathy Rumer is a butcher.

YAY you...   I can personally attest for Dr. Brant&#39;s personality and level of care.  She has never operated on me but I trust her to be a professional.   She is going to be checking in on me since my Revision.   Love her.

Have you read the reviews here? You just chose the two surgeons that everyone says to not go.  There are so many serious and talented surgeons, why would you go to bad ones ?

I didn&#39;t know about Gallagher until after I posted here.  With Gallagher it was a matter of her being in the same state and easier to get help.
</p>
<p>
With Dr. Rumer that&#39;s why I came here. To get everyone&#39;s opinion.  As soon as I heard about how bad the surgeries have been I didnt schedule the consults.

I lived 30 minutes away from Gallagher&#39;s location. It sure didn&#39;t help me. It took 3 revision surgeries over 3 more years to repair the aesthetic issues and remove the vulvar cysts. The rest of the damage remains to the degree that I take 2 daily prescription medications to maintain control of my urination.

There’s enough bad surgeons around that you should never trust any of them. Even well known surgeons can be very misleading until you research in depth. Always independantly check to the best of your ability.

Like me. My surgery with Rumer was back in 2017. Unfortunately, a wealth of information came out about her
<em>
after
</em>
my surgery. This insanity wasn&#39;t as well-reported back then but I wish it was.

I first joined Reddit at the end of 2019 as my partner suggested. At that time, I had experienced about a year and a half-ish of completely ignored complications. Feel free to check my post history. I exchanged well over 100 emails with Rumer&#39;s staff... Teri Rumer, Jenn, Dawn, Dr. Brandt, Gina, etc.... Then I joined Reddit to look for help and Dr. Rumer personally emailed me to say I shouldn&#39;t leave &#34;nasty reviews&#34; on Reddit. I didn&#39;t include my name or email address. She simply recognized my story and complications from a literal brand new Reddit account and bitched to me via email about it. She is more concerned with her (poor) reputation than helping patients she injured. Then Reddit users told me about Hannah Simpson&#39;s botched surgery. (Warning: her blog is quite graphic, if you decide to look it up.) Rumer&#39;s office made it really difficult for me to get me medical records. I needed help from the PA Dept of Health. Rumer&#39;s office sent me incorrect medical records that actually included two other patients&#39; records also, so I then reported her for HIPAA violations as well. She was reckless with my medical records AFTER I sought help from the Dept of Health. Then the jezebel.com article came out, which further validated my horror experience. All of this is 100% true, regardless of how crazy it sounds. This. all. happened.

P.S. - Everything I said here can be proven.

Thank you for speaking up. I mean it. It&#39;s fucking unacceptable that people keep getting injured and there are apparently no consequences. Fucking unacceptable and infuriating. Please keep your page up. I sincerely hope it helps other people from getting injured by her. I wish I knew back in 2017 what I know now.

If you want to stay local, call the plastic surgery department of the biggest university there.. universities that offer plastic surgery residencies always have a craniofacial specialist and they will try to get it approved through insurance. You will also be safe bc big institutions won&#39;t keep bad surgeons.

Papillon Center took insurance when I was there, it was out of network but it covered most of the cost.

You might consider Dr. Gabriel Del Corral in Baltimore. He takes insurance. I had my zero depth done here 18 months ago and I&#39;m satisfied ...your results may vary...But, the insurance issue was a big deal for me. The staff was friendly and professional and Dr. Del Corral is a true sweetheart!

The wait time I experienced was skewed by COVID shutdown but, it&#39;s best to just ask because a surgeon&#39;s schedule changes based on demand ...

I just consulted Nov. 22. I was advised they would start getting approvals/scheduling the week of January 10. Dr. Del Corral told me there were around 30 patients ahead of me and I will probably be scheduled for a March surgery.

I&#39;m really surprised that such a surgeon is still allowed to practice. Good thing I checked in here.  That would have been bad.

If you want a basic penile inversion, I&#39;ve heard good things about the skill of the surgeon I&#39;m getting my orchi with at least from the limited stuff available on here, and his bedside manner is great - Dr. Witten in Louisville. Fairly cheap with VERY good insurance coverage, wait times are pretty low by most standards, and very accommodating of patient preferences about things if you know to ask about them, even seems willing to learn if there&#39;s something you wanna get tweaked from standard procedures and can explain it well.
</p>
<p>
Rumer is the butcher. Avoid her like the plague. I wouldn&#39;t even trust her to do a revision, I
<em>
MIGHT
</em>
trust her to do an orchiectomy but that&#39;s solely because it&#39;s simple enough an ex-farmer in a hotel room with Ebay tools can do it and I know enough to almost do it myself, she&#39;s NOT trustworthy and I&#39;d go with even the more unknown and unpracticed surgeons at some local hospital over her.

I very openly posted photos of my surgery at
<a href="http://www.female.plumbing" rel="nofollow">www.female.plumbing
</a>
, yes the website title is intended as humor to keep me from crying. What was worse than Rumer botching me was her gaslighting me afterward, trying to blame it on me when that was complete and utter bullshit. She later tried to say I should avoid having sex outside the context of relationships if I was worried about how it looked (thank you “mom” but your job was make me a vagina not tell me where to use it), and then she tried to distract me by focusing on my tummy and trying to offer me a free tummy tuck since I wasn’t satisfied.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been mentioned earlier in the thread.
</p>
<p>
Of course Rumer takes insurance, it’s the only way she gets a feed of new customers despite her reputation. You get ONE CHANCE to do this right, take it from me it has been seven years and I cannot do shit with it. I have become an asexual shell of a human, and I barely feel like a woman at all. She is not the one to take the chance with.
</p>
<p>
You can happily drop my name when you say no thanks. Or just say nothing at all.

How was the revision with Dr. Bowers? I had a friend who went to her years ago for her surgery and it didn&#39;t turn out well at all.  That&#39;s part of the reason I&#39;m doing so much research into this.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll likely be going with Dr. Bluebond-Langner. I&#39;m already on the wait list.  Just need to get my Dr&#39;s to give me the letters already.

I think my results speak for themselves. I was left with no clitoris (which is requiring nerve surgery to
<em>
try
</em>
and rebuild) and a 1” wattle of dead tissue just sticking out that has zero sensation and a hold in the middle. Marci Bowers was entirely useless, it took her office literal YEARS to make proper referrals for continuing care she refused to do. She shifted the goalposts a lot and talked about how by 1970’s standards when her mentor started doing this, it was still a great vagina, and she couldn’t even manage to get me seen by some of the doctors opening up shop in New York City, despite literally having her name on the practice and faculty roster.
</p>
<p>
I can say my mental health was so damaged, and the prospect of living the rest of my life without a clitoris is so damning, that I am and remain tormented every single day and it is only the prospect of having a very complicated peripheral nerve surgery that took me seven years to get planned (which now due to Covid might not even happen after all if hospitals cut elective surgery again early next year) that keeps me alive.
</p>
<p>
If I say that too loudly, they try to send me to more therapists, but that doesn’t help. If your car is broken you take it to a mechanic. If that mechanic fucks up you go to another, and if that mechanic blows it, another… and so on. When do you take your car to a therapist?
</p>
<p>
Exactly. Trying to tell me I have a mental health issue when I have a physical/surgical issue that
<em>
should
</em>
be distressing is just another manifestation of trans hatred and abuse.
</p>
<p>
So yeah: I can’t speak to being a product of a Bowers primary surgery, but I can tell you if shit goes south she will disappear faster than a bunny in bowler hat.

As a Genital Electrolysis, BA and chondrolaryngoplasty patient of Dr. McGinn, true, her practice does not accept insurance, and requires payment up front. However, her office staff will work with your insurance to get the clearance for the surgery. There is a small fee for this service, and IMO, worth it. Upon payment, the office will provide you with an insurance-ready receipt to submit to your carrier for reimbursement. I am very happy with the results of my surgeries.

I decided to stick with Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langer.  I read reviews on her and they were really good.  I had forgotten that I had seen Bowers work personally and it scared me.  My friend&#39;s scar line looked like a ⚾️.  I&#39;m getting my final two letters next week. I&#39;m trying to get the office to give me an exact cost for everything.  Insurance said they cover 60% so I&#39;m going to try and get coinsurance to cover what&#39;s left.
