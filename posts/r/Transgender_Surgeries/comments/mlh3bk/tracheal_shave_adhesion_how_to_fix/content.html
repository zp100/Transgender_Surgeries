I had a tracheal shave 12 days, and as it&#39;s healing, it seems like the scar is sticking to my adam&#39;s apple, which I now understand is a common thing when the incision is made lower on the neck/directly above the adam&#39;s apple. My surgeon wanted to do the incision there because I had a natural crease below my adam&#39;s apple, but neglected to mention this was a possibility. I&#39;m confused though because he&#39;s an otolaryngologist at Mt. Sinai who works on a lot of trans women, so you would think he would know this could happen.

Have other people dealt with this, how did you fix it? Will it go away on it&#39;s own? Do steroid injections or scar massage help?

Yeah I was reading about surgery, I&#39;d really like to avoid that obviously. I&#39;m still really early on in the healing process tho, so maybe it will work itself out, but will definitely try massage and see if that helps

<p>
thank u!

Have you discussed this with the surgeon at all yet or sent the video to them?

I sent them a message with the video yesterday and am waiting to hear back.
</p>
<p>
I had a post-op check-up a week ago and he didn&#39;t say anything, but maybe it hadn&#39;t happened yet at that point? I didn&#39;t notice until a day or two ago.
