tw: bottom surgery, graphic descriptions of genitals, mentions of suicide

</p>
<p>
<strong>
tl;dr stay away from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN unless your life depends on it.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Hey all, I&#39;m sitting in a hotel room recovering from a GRS revision surgery with Dr. Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Zhao a week ago and wanted to share a little bit of the story in hopes of helping out the community knowledge-base. As you all know Dr. Bluebond-Langner, Dr. Zhao, and their team are absolutely amazing, nothing new there. But I want to reiterate just how bad Mayo Clinic is by sharing my story.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Story time: Back in 2017 I underwent bottom surgery with Dr. Martinez-Jorge (and another doctor who I forget) at Mayo. I was asked prior to surgery if it was okay to use a skin graft for additional depth (due to my size), to which I gave the go-ahead for. When I wake up from surgery I was told that they didn&#39;t do the skin graft because I had &#34;enough&#34; depth. I had a normal enough stay in the hospital and recovery went alright overall. However, they did an absolute botch-job during surgery that haunted me for years.
</p>
<p>
So what did Mayo do?
<span class="md-spoiler-text">
Well to start they didn&#39;t remove all of my erectile tissue, any time I would become aroused there was what looked to be- and felt like- a stump of a penis underneath the skin that would protrude from where my dick used to be. I know GRS isn&#39;t perfect, but it was clear I was far from a cis woman with a large clit. It also made dilating painful. Mayo also didn&#39;t move my urethra This caused me to have incontinence issues that I spent a long time working on with two physical therapists who were amazing and understanding and helped me as best they could. They left me with a hole for a clitoris. They also only got me to the first dot on the dilator, but that&#39;s &#34;enough&#34; I suppose. Oh, and I had no labia minora, so that&#39;s cool too.
</span>
</p>
<p>
I was absolutely devastated and became a dysphoric, suicidal mess. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to have sex with my boyfriend when I healed. And I certainly didn&#39;t trust mayo to fix their mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I pushed on in other areas of life though, accepting my fate of being botched. A couple years went by and I got myself into a really good position in my career and started looking at revision options. I asked some friends and everyone was talking about Bluebond-Langner and her team so it&#39;s who I set my sights on. I lived half the U.S. away so I had to save up a bunch for flying to NYC for a consult and then spending a month out here for recovery, but every penny has been worth it.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s obviously a bit hard to tell with swelling and bruising, but literally all of my problem areas have been fixed. The team has been so wonderful to work with barring a few hiccups (e.g. got misgendered in the recovery room by a nurse).
</p>
<p>
I went with Mayo because they were close to home (1hr), had next to no waiting list (I know why now!), worked with my insurance, and had name recognition- and I was too poor to fly somewhere else for surgery and recovery; but I had to do it otherwise I was going to off-myself. Had I known how that surgery would&#39;ve turned out I might&#39;ve tried holding out. But ultimately with how things went I just know that I&#39;m really thankful to have been able to go under with Dr. Bluebond-Langner, Dr. Zhao, and the team because I finally feel comfortable with my body.
</p>
<p>
This also doesn&#39;t touch the topic of my FFS experience at Mayo, and my BA consult with them 😂. So seriously avoid Mayo at all costs. They gatekeep with a fuck ton of appointments for not great results.

Thanks for posting, I hope everything goes well after all this and I’m sure this post is going to help others.
</p>
<p>
It would be great if you could make some follow up posts on how this turns out as there’s not a lot of info posted on revisions, as no doubt you’re well aware.

Thank you! I&#39;ll definitely try to do updates as things heal. Though right now I&#39;m expecting smooth sailing. 🙏

I think one of the downsides to Mayo Clinic is that there aren&#39;t any experienced surgeons that specialize in grs at that location. Or at least, surgeons that have a number of years of experience performing the surgery.

Unfortunately I can&#39;t speak for standard practice or anyone else&#39;s experience since I haven&#39;t looked for much info on revision stories by other people so I can only speak for myself, but after revision
<span class="md-spoiler-text">
when I get aroused there&#39;s no obvious external signs (engorged bump or anything). It may in part to still being very swollen since surgery was only a week ago, but I can certainly feel an extreme difference.

A number of people have a revision to remove erectile tissue. If you feel there is still too much, making a few photos and asking a number of surgeons about their opinion may be an idea. In Europe
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic" rel="nofollow">Dordjevic</a>
may be an option ( genitalsurgerybelgrade ), there are pictures of a revision on their website, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
may be some additional options.

Don&#39;t know if you have seen it ...
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/hpbaxc/questions_about_extra_erectile_tissue/g0hytwk/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
was a comment that could help, and there were further comments in the whole
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/hpbaxc/questions_about_extra_erectile_tissue/content.html" rel="nofollow">thread</a>
. And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_erectile_tissue" rel="nofollow">here</a>
might be some additional comments that could help understand a few aspects.
</p>
<p>
So it seems there is no standard, many surgeons have different techniques, some hide scars in folds for example, some not, etc., and it may also depend on the experience of each surgeon. And some surgeons like BBL in NY may use robotic assisted tools.
</p>
<p>
As said
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic" rel="nofollow">Djordjevic</a>
in Europe has experience with a number of revisions, and there were pictures of a revision of erectile tissue on their website. I personally would make some photos, sum up the issues that you feel are there, and ask what their opinion would be.
</p>
<p>
And I would use coconut oil on the whole area. It has small molecules and it may make for a softening. Its a recipe from people from Thailand. It is necessary to use non latex condoms in case because oil dissolves latex. And some people additionally dilate with estrogen cream from time to time.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/surgeries/transfeminine/index#wiki_after_surgery" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
may also be more.

I appreciate your support! It definitely sucked to go through don&#39;t get me wrong, but I&#39;d rather it happen to me so I can share this story than someone else if I can help it. The dysphoria and depression that came after my initial surgery was super rough and I only got through with a stellar support system, so I&#39;d hate to hear of a case where someone wasn&#39;t as blessed with the support that I had and have to go through this.
