Many thanks for sharing and being willing to provide us with a better understanding of the options available. I, for one, would appreciate you &#34;following up&#34; with your continued recovery.
</p>
<p>
Personal circumstances not withstanding and depending  on how I get on with HRT, I&#39;m hoping to go the &#34;whole nine yards&#34; as far as surgery is concerned. I may not have time to complete my goals due to financial, age, and health issues. However, knowing that there are alternatives or different options out there makes me feel better about the future, and I hope that this surgery has given you all that you hoped for.

Is the suture line up the underside of your penis as well ? Hard to tell in the pictures.

The suture line goes up about a third of the length of the penis, the bit above that is the natural seam looking bit (no idea what that&#39;s called, hopefully you know what I mean &gt;.&lt;). The suture is along that seam so that the scar will look pretty natural I think.
</p>
<p>
I annotated this pic with suture line so you can see what I mean:

The food was amazing, I&#39;d go back just to eat lol.

Dr Seipp was great, very cheery and enthusiastic which is quite reassuring when you are nervous.

Wow I’m surprised at how long the incision is for orchiectomy!  Would not have guessed the cut would extend so far up. Hope you have issue-free recovery.

Everything is looking good so far, I&#39;ve got my fingers crossed &gt;.&lt;
</p>
<p>
The incision is only that long because of the scrotectomy I believe. Though I think bilateral orchies are the same?

Just stumbled across this post &amp; this is what I’m looking for at the moment.  Great to see why the results looks like. I’d be planning on getting vulvaplasty some point after this.  Why the cut far up the shaft?

I’m so torn in this. On the one hand, I hate mine. But I also don’t want to lose what diminished erection ability I have now (top).
</p>
<p>
What did the doctor say about that if you don’t mind me asking? I keep getting conflicting info from people who’ve had it on if their ability to gain/keep erections is the same or gone afterwards.

I was told it was a possibility and although it wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world to me if I couldn&#39;t get an erection I would rather keep that ability. I figured that if I&#39;ve kept that ability 2 years on puberty blockers (which should be stopping my gonads from making any sex hormones, the same thing removing them would do) then I wouldn&#39;t be losing it by having an orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll let you know what&#39;s happened in my case once its safely healed if you are interested.

I had mine done 15 years ago and I am still quite functional. I also make a point to seek out stimulus every day so that I don’t lose the ability. There were definitely a couple years where I was kind of depressed and didn’t bother and I temporarily lost a bit of functionality, but I was able to gain it back with consistent exercise (use).

So I woke up in the middle of the night with an erection so I can say so far at least it still works lol. Didn&#39;t seem to pull any stitches or hurt much at all.

That’s what I’m thinking, but I’m only on regular patches and not progesterone, so I’m not sure how improved the breast growth would be not having to have Decapeptyl injections.
</p>
<p>
I had a look at your write-up of your experience which was a really great help, so thank you😊.
</p>
<p>
What was the timetable like for the entire operation? Did you have to have to stay overnight and/or any follow up appointments afterwards? I just have to think about hotels and dog sitters if it’s in Wales

Progesterone seems to be magic for breast growth, but GenderCare (who I’m with) refuse to prescribe it.
