Like most of you cursed with a male physique, I have a wide back, narrow hips and small bum and I marvel at all those amazing South American tgirls with curvaceous proportions that would shame a genetic girl.
</p>
<p>
Yes, some fake their pics but many clearly do not. I know they haven’t had a BBL because their figures are too amazing (limitations of BBL listed below) and they have admitted to being pumped with silicone. We’re always told that silicone is extremely dangerous and a ticking time bomb yet all I see is one amazing ‘pumped’ figure after another. If it really was as dangerous as we are led to believe then surely it wouldn’t be so popular? I would regularly see dodgy results and hear horror stories of silicone gone wrong - tgirls warning others to avoid making the same mistake they did (as is happening with covid)?
</p>

I have looked into BBL over the past few years and the honest surgeons admit they can’t give feminine proportions via a single BBL and that it may take as many as 3 rounds. This is due to
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
In order to survive, donor fat needs to pre-existing fat to be transplanted into but the male body hardly has any such fat. And transferring too much fat causes necrosis.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Skin can only stretch so much and so it’s not a case of transferring as much as you like and the skin will simply expand like a balloon.
</p>
</li>

I’d not get butt implants either. Way to many complications. Look in the wiki for BBL as well as that can be exceptionally dangerous.

Surely smoking can’t be bad if so many people do it. Or being overweight. Or …

Luckily BBL is much less dangerous than it used to be! In 2019 the rate of death for BBL was around 1 in 15000, which means less than 1% of people died from the procedure that year (this was part of a trend of decreasing mortality following new procedure guidelines). Stats were taken from the wiki.

But with smoking and weight we routinely hear of people who died and we routinely hear of people warning others not to make the same mistake stated but I have not heard a single one from any trans-woman that had silicone.

Sarina Valentina had a botched set of silicone injections that caused her pain for over a decade. She looked phenomenal but her pain was excruciating. She recently had the whole nine yards removed and she&#39;s still amazing looking, but a lot happier too.

Please stop with the injection nonsense before someone does something stupid that they will regret --and they will regret not having the peace of mind about whatever goop they had injected into their body. Let’s just skip over the discussion on lip injections with Silikon 1000 because you’re talking about BBL which is already the riskiest plastic surgery procedure being done and that’s when it’s done the right way, using adipose tissue (fat).
</p>
<p>
If you’re using a legitimate filler for the kind of volume you need for the buttocks that you’re talking about it would be insanely expensive. They sell those fillers in 1ml to 5ml syringes for hundreds of dollars a pop. If you get fat grafting with lipo, the injections will vary but that fat needs to be removed first and removing 2-3L of fat is high volume liposuction to start with. So, let’s say the surgeon will get 3L out, and comes up with 2L available for injection. That’s 2000ML. Now I’m using ballpark, but realistic, numbers here. How many injection sites are you going to have? Do you have any idea how all this gets divided up and injected back in to get that deluxe booty? If you want hips it’s going to be at least 8 and easily more to get that 2000ML back in. If all goes well, you’ll retain 75% and you’ll be absolutely underwhelmed with the results. Then you can start saving for round two and still have your piece of mind and health.
</p>
<p>
Now, if you go with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), cheap Hydrogel, or the worst idea, silicone that someone told you was “medical grade” and perfectly safe. None of these PERMANENT, non-biodegradable fillers have been proven safe at those volumes. You do not want to be the person with this stuff in your ass. I promise you.
</p>
<p>
As simple comparison exercise. What are breast implants made of? Are they permanent devices? NO! They can break down, leak and rupture. If they do, you’ll be 10-15 years the wiser at that point and trying to get them the fuck out before you have silicone migrating into your lymphatic system.
</p>
<p>
Don’t make yourself a time bomb. I&#39;m telling you this based on my own experiences.

Wow. Thank you for that. I just wanted to hope against hope that silicone isn’t as bad as we’ve been led to believe however I never would have risked it.
</p>
<p>
BBL-wise, am looking at 4-5 litres of fat sucked out each time bu, yeah, Will still be looking at two rounds at least to get the results I want.

That is an enormous amount of fat to have removed in one go. I don&#39;t know if American surgeons will go that high.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
EDIT:
</strong>
I went back and looked at some notes and I have examples of some heavier-set women having fat removed ranging from 5L to 19L. I just wanted to be accurate with the amounts. This was done outside the US too.

I couldn&#39;t agree more. I made the terrible decision to get Silikon 1000 lip injections ten years ago and have regretted it ever since.

I’d guess many don’t speak of it. Complications are going to happen years later and there’s not many who are part of the trans community at that point in their lives. Regrets over this would also be hard to deal with and who wants to speak up then?
</p>
<p>
I’ve never met or heard of any Australian trans (or cis) women who’s had it done, and it’s probably relatively rare in the majority of people who post on reddit. What you read online in English is probably not representative of the complication rate. I have met one young foreign trans women did silicone injections, and I do understand the appeal. Kind of wanted to do it myself after seeing her.
</p>
<p>
Personally I’m interested in BBL, but I need to look into it more.
</p>
<p>
Look at those links I posted.

I guess those wanting to speak out would be the same type of people who speak out to warn others of their fatal prognosis due to smoking and anti-vaxxing.
</p>
<p>
I’m also 98% certain I’ll get a BBL but my focus is not the arse (all surgeons confirm they can give me what I want in that department) but the hips. I have a 40 inch chest and 35 inch hips - I am not as lucky as those feminine and slightly built Filipino transwomen - so my area of concern is the hips.
</p>
<p>
I’ll look at the links, thanks.

Because they are embarassed they did it and it and it went sideways. The results of having it removed can leave you quite damaged. Depending on the kind of  silicone used the body will respond to differenctly. It may stay in a lump or sphereize by turning into little balls that gets encompassed in thje injection area. But they can migrate too.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s typically lack of resources and desparation that puts people in a position where putmping sounda like the only option. It&#39;s often the the same lack or resources that keeps them from getting it removed and talking about it as well.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a big issue that is often overlooked. If you suddenly have a health emergency in the injected area and find yourself in an emergency room. They may determine the material newds to be removed ASAP. They will remove it, bit they wont give any shits about the outcome aesthetics, they will just take it out. It&#39;s not pretty when that happens.

People are less likely to put their complications online. I’ve seen women who have had silicone injected with their skin looking “black” around the injection site. I know of one woman who died. I know of women who are numb. Others whom cannot lay out in the sun because whatever was injected into them will turn their skin a black color and the substance will start eating away at their skin- I have seen multiple cases where women have open holes on their thighs and butt). I know women who have had it for years and talk about now needing to have it removed. Ive seen cases where the silicone moves. So it started around the hips and now it sits like a lump on her knees. I also know of a case of a woman who cannot be on hormones because whatever is injected is free flowing and hormones change body fat distribution and there’s the chance that the hormones will move her silicone around/ negatively impact her health.
</p>
<p>
It used to be soooo popular because women did not have as much access to medical procedures- where a physician was monitoring their health and hormone levels. Surgeries were not covered and prospects of paying for things out of pocket were out of reach (this is STILL the case today in some South American countries) So some women turned to silicone injections as a more accessible way to feminize their bodies.
</p>
<p>
Trust me - I KNOW how tempting it is. Especially when you see cases of people having an idealized body type. But when you actually see and talk to women who disclose complications- they will tell you it’s not worth it.

If you go to a Miami clinic, to some cheap clinic in a foreign country are more likely to be a place that injects into muscle. The risks are very high when fat is injected into the muscle. Anyone who has ever got an IM vaccine or HRT will know that blood supply things get knicked even with a fine needle. I shudder to imagine a cannula going that deep to inject fat.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, recent analysis shows that liposculpture with strict adherence to injecting fat only into the subcutaneous area significantly reduces risk of embolism and death. At the moment, a tummy tuck is comparable in risk to a BBL.
</p>
<p>
The mortality rate of liposculpture (on the high end) is 1:15k.

Hey all, on the back of phoebeburgh’s post about Sarina, I have done some digging around and found cases of transsexual porn stars suffering with the excruciating effects of silicone on their bodies and health.
</p>
<p>
It is so tempting, especially when you have a very masculine body with a V shaped torso like a rugby player but the stories are true and not hype and I’m just not dysphoric or desperate enough to risk my health or my life in this way.
</p>
<p>
I was going to delete the entire thread but will leave it’s up – showcasing my naivete and idiocy for all time – because it may very well prove helpful, even life-saving, to others thinking of going down this path of black market surgery.

I had gluteal implants a few years back.  I was told by a couple of different surgeons that I would not be happy with BBL because I don&#39;t have enough donor fat.  The recovery from the surgery was difficult because I could not sit for 2 weeks.  I read a lot of books during recovery.  I consulted with Dr. Mendieta in FL who said he would do the BBL, but I&#39;m glad that I chose not to go that route.  I have big shoulders too, so while I don&#39;t have a perfect hour glass shape the implants really help with my confidence.  Knock on wood, I haven&#39;t had any problems with the implants.  I was lucky to find someone local, so I didn&#39;t have to fly somewhere and lay on my stomach for two weeks in a hotel room.  Best to you in your journey.

I have the reverse problem – I have plenty of fat to spare LOL. Sadly, due to risk of necrosis and limitations of the skins ability to stretch, I won’t be able to utilise them this donor fat as I would like to.

And the recovery from BBL sounds like hell so I’m not attracted to the idea of having to go through it for a second time or even a third. I’m also concerned that as you age, the fat will sag.

How many people who&#39;ve had silicone injections gone wrong do you think will speak out about it on English language subs/pages you regularly visit?
</p>
<p>
How long does it take for those injections to go bad? A year? 5 years? Maybe more like 10 or 25. Will you be around on those forums to learn about it then?

They don’t have to talk about it on English-speaking forums. All they’ve got to do is tell someone so that it becomes news in their country, that in turn means it becomes news in other countries. For example, yesterday we heard about a married American anti-vax couple that contracted COVID and died within weeks of each other. Not only would I expect something like that to make it in the news in general but I would definitely expect it to make the rounds in the transgender community.
</p>
<p>
I understand your point, and it may take decades for issues to arise but one woman I was talking to had it done 15 years ago and she’s still going strong.

It’s not bad if 1. The person knows what they doing 2. ITS REAL SILICONE !! not mixed with some other weird stuff . Silicone itself is not bad for the Body . It’s just in a loose form . But it’s not bad . They do silicone micro droplets in the lips so there goes that . I got ass shots from someone who does the IG models . Very reputable girl . And i wouldn’t trust another trans to do it also . Too envious .

So same . I hated my stick frame . But didn’t gain weight or couldn’t keep the weight for a bbl . So I’ll be honest it does hurt . If you can get pain meds take them before hand . It is a lil lumpy for the first week but you need to massage it in . It’s not soft like fat but it’s can be grabbed and slapped just like regular . I started with just hips but soon when back to round it all out and I’m super happy . It’s been a little over a year . No complications or complaints

Its just finding people that actually do it with the correct filling that&#39;s the hardest part i take Estradiol enantate and that burns like a bitch because it&#39;s alcohol based injections rather than oil. The girl you got it done from who did she do? Do you have before and after pictures?

Except and over the past year and a half we have heard from people warning goes against Covid, as I mentioned in my post, just like to hear about people warning against being overweight, smoking, drugs and alcohol
<strong>
BUT
</strong>
I’ve yet to hear of any transsexual woman warning against silicone injections and that’s the difference.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, I still Believe it’s bad and will look at a BBL first and foremost, but I can’t help but question when I haven’t heard of a single bad result of silicone injections.

There’s a big difference between a “male body” and a “trans woman’s body on consistent hrt for 5 years”… That’s first!!!
</p>
<p>
Give the hormones time to do their job before even thinking about surgery. A BBL on a gay guy for example and on an trans woman’s on a consistent HRT regimen look completely different and that’s a fact!!! Fat redistribution is a wonderful thing so please let it happen!!!
</p>
<p>
1 BBL would be plenty for a modest look.  Now if u want drama then that’s another discussion 😂😂😂

It really wouldn’t, though. I’ve had consultations with numerous top surgeons and they’ve all consistently said the same thing - that 1 BBL will not add much width.
</p>
<p>
HRT Can only do so much and it cannot compensate for the lack of pubic bone widening that happens to girls during puberty. I can add an inch on, maybe two if you’re lucky, but the 5 inches or so that most of us need? Not a cat in hells chance, unfortunately.

I think u r misunderstanding what I was saying or maybe I worded it wrong…
</p>
<p>
Yes hormones can only do so much BUT let them do that!!! Let them soften the skin, let fat redistribution occur, allow the former male physique to soften n become its most feminine  BEFORE surgery. It’s a completely different look, is all I’m saying trust me.
</p>
<p>
Let’s say u want surgery… A BBL? Ok fine! If the fat harvested is distributed very, very specifically, like in the hip dips, it will make a difference!!! Once the fat is injected and u continue HRT u will gain weight in that area!!! Round 2? Go for it, LET’S GO!!! Now u want more hips ok, be very specific with ur surgeon and make it pay!!! I’m not saying don’t get surgery, I’m saying allow HRT to do what it will for ur body first. The results will look much, much better trust me!!!
</p>
<p>
PS If u have skinny legs don’t go too too wide, it looks off.
