Hello! ‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
Since we‚Äôre getting close to the 9 month mark, I decided to write down my experience with FacialTeam in Marbella in hopes that I can help you in your own journey. I had 3 sessions of Facial Feminisation surgery in Romania, which unfortunately didn‚Äôt get me the results I was looking for. Specifically, I had my forehead shaved TWICE before going to FacialTeam, and both of the times the difference was little as hell. I realized after a while that I needed type 3 of forehead reconstruction, and this is when I stumbled upon FacialTeam online. I immediately asked for a Skype meeting, and there I met doctor Capitan, who was the sweetest doctor, answering all of my questions!
</p>
<p>
I was left with no doubt at all, and I booked my surgery in February 2021, in spite of the pandemic. I flew to Marbella and things were smoother than expected. Everything from the weather, the people, la Villa Marbella (which was their recommendation), the driver, the TEAM at FacialTeam, literally everything was perfect. I had there my THIRD Forehead Reconstruction, but this time the right one.
</p>
<p>
The thing that made me trust FacialTeam is that they don‚Äôt try to oversell you any surgery. In fact, they‚Äôre quite rigorous with the ones they propose or accept to do. I, for example, also had 2 rhinoplasties before and I wanted to get my tip of the nose slightly deprojected, which they denied because they focus on feminization, not beautification. If they don‚Äôt think you need that certain change, they won‚Äôt just do it for getting more money (unlike other doctors in EU that I won‚Äôt mention). I felt like they care very much about my satisfaction as a patient. I know some people complained that their results are ‚Äúconservative‚Äù, but truth be told, they do everything they can do based on our CT scan. Doctor Capitan further explained me that when I met him in Marbella. They want to prioritize our health, minimizing the risks, and best believe they do their best for creating outstanding results. Unlike my doctor in Romania, they made a CT scan before and after surgery, so we analyzed the differences afterwards and their work was crystal clear, transparent.
</p>
<p>
I was really impressed by the hospital, because it doesn‚Äôt even look like a hospital, more like a resort. I can‚Äôt remember feeling any pain, not even when I was dropped to the hotel the next day after surgery. I was alone due to Covid, so I felt a bit of anxiety when I was alone in the hotel room. They have the best sleeping pills though, I wish I could find them in my home country as well haha. I was swollen, but I had a nurse coming in every day to check on me, and even the lymphatic massage guy, Antonio (whom I‚Äôm sure you will love as well). Beside that, I had acupuncture to relieve the stress, which was my first experience with it and it was great. On the 3rd day post-op I was already visiting Marbella, and the best thing was the sunset walks with the other trans girls from La Villa Marbella. I had an unforgettable time and I made new friends. In those 12 days I spent in Marbella, I got to know most of it. I fell in love with the city, the landscape, the peace and the ocean. Moving there would be like a dream come true to be honest.
</p>
<p>
It didn‚Äôt really feel like a surgery, more like a vacation for me. The only regret I have is not going to FacialTeam from the very beginning. Best believe you are in good hands if you go to them. They are a full team, and Isabel (one of the coordinators that takes care of you pre-op) was incredibly  helpful. She even offered to call my mom after surgery to tell her that everything was fine. They are really professional and they deliver the most natural, yet noticeable, results!

Would you mind naming your surgeon(s) in Romania. I&#39;d like to add this  post to the wiki here.

OMG this is what I want. I want this so bad - to have it be an experience like this.
</p>
<p>
Did you feel like you didn&#39;t need anyone with you to help with recovery?

Yes, I felt ok being alone but mind you I only had the forehead done which allowed me to do most things without any help.

I also had a Skype consultation with doctor Capitan! Really professional guy. Going to have forehead reconstruction with FacialTeam once I have saved up the money for the trip.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s so important that you trust your surgeon and these guys really make sure you feel like you&#39;re in good hands from what I can tell.
</p>
<p>
Congrats on the great results! happy for you! &lt;3
