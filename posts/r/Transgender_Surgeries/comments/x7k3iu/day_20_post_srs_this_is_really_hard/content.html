I&#39;m so squeamish and actually afraid for the entire healing process plus the prep w hair removal, choosing docs, potential complications, etc that no matter how much I want the end result, I genuinely don&#39;t know if I can go ahead w getting this done. Sorry a bit of a tangent I&#39;m just,,, aaaaaaaaAAAAAA

I was the same way, but I just bit the bullet and did it.
</p>
<p>
Laser hair removal gave me panic attacks from having to show someone else that horrible thing attached to me. Surgery itself was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and there were moments where time seemed to halt and the pain became so unbearable I would have thought I was hallucinating, if I wasn’t already fully enveloped by it.
</p>
<p>
But looking back it was totally worth it. Yes it’s pretty rough but the end result is so nice, if that’s what you think you want. At some point you have to go outside your comfort zone to deal with the logistics of getting what you want.

Of course you&#39;re correct about the comfort zone thing, my cock chopped and screwed edition isn&#39;t exactly in a zone of comfort. But it&#39;s just,, another thing on my plate to think about and I&#39;m so beyond burnt out I think I just want to shut head off forever lol,,
</p>
<p>
In all seriousness yeah ig you def have enough time to think about it and come to terms with and plan everything, it&#39;s just yeah ig all I can do is keep trying to get familiar w everything, it&#39;s just still not getting better.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard it might be counter intuitive to get the hair removal? They can do it surgically? But they may not scrape everything properly, fuck. I already paid out the ass for facial and neck laser, let alone sessions for down there or painful long electrolysis. This sucks lol. Not to bellyache or self pity, it&#39;s just a lot.

Yeah some surgeons can scrape hair follicles during surgery but they might miss some. I couldn’t deal with more than the bare minimum so I had zero depth done. Less risk of hair growing inside and no dilating (I could never handle that).
</p>
<p>
In any case you’re right, it is a lot. I don’t want to scare anyone away but it’s a huge deal. If it’s any comfort, the fact you’re thinking it through is a good sign you’ll be prepared to make the right decision.

I heard the hair removal makes the follicles smaller and easier to miss? I&#39;m torn but if I had internal hair idk what I&#39;d do :/
</p>
<p>
But yeah I want to be able to use it, even if fucking DILATING is ANOTHER thing to throw on, oh my god lol it like never ends sometimes.
</p>
<p>
Buttt, yeah ig it&#39;s 2/3 steps of getting rid of the monstrosity down there that keeps me from feeling okay wearing any high waisted pants, curbing testosterone development, and then if you so choose, having a functioning girlcave. Which I would enjoy. I&#39;d enjoy that. Not having to bottom prep anymore gay male style lol,,,
</p>
<p>
anyway thanks for the discussion ik I&#39;m being a bit ridiculous but I have no other option but to hypomanically laugh my way through this whole thing I think

Well I didn&#39;t do any laser hair removal for the surgery... I mean no one told me that I have to do it. Well they told me but one month before the surgery... So I toke the risk of doing it without electrolysis or laser. And my pain tolerance was low but this... Wow now my pain tolerance is high. The needles didn&#39;t hurt, the laser on the face didn&#39;t hurt. Now I have pain but tolerable most of the time even with necrosis. So don&#39;t be afraid, step forward everytime.

If your in the states look for electrolysis that also do anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
There is one here in Texas called electrolysis 3000. They do a decent job

Totally different thing, but when I had my arm set after I had dislocated and subsequently broken it, the er doc asked if I wanted to be put under for the setting of my arm. I definitely jumped on that and it was really fast, like barely out for a second and then waking back up. They used

, I bet if they used it for that they could probably use it for you? 🤷‍♀️

My understanding is that the more you can relax the less its going to hurt. It doesn&#39;t hurt for some. Its putting it back in that you can&#39;t do much about.

If it&#39;s not for my mother that hugs me everytime I cry and some friends out of my city. And all those messages I received from all of you probably I will have given up on the first days. I still cry a lot cause it hurts and I see things that scares me like some mucous and the necrosis. I try to stay strong and keep going even if I cry like a baby everytime Im alone with my thoughts. I just hope everything heals fine and this pain ends...

Do 3 sitting bath a day, clean up with a  douche with saline solution. dry your vagina an hour after each bath, eat looooots of protein, walk an hour a day for like 2 months.. this should help a lot.
</p>
<p>
Contact me in pm if yoy want more details, I had SRS 3 months ago, can give you a very thorough guide.

That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. Three dilatations a day for 20 mins each. And 2 times cleaning my vagina with soap (for intimate zones) and water. And that I have to clean every part of it.

You are so sweet. A complete stranger, and the advice and help you give is inspirational. The 🌎 is a better place with you in it. I hope I can find such an individual when I go through this life changing surgery. ❤️

Wow.. that is so sweet, thank you so much! ❤️
</p>
<p>
Since transitioning, I started to try to bring joy and positive vibes to others, make their life better, through big or small act. I strive to uplift others, treat them as I would like to be treated, show kindness.
</p>
<p>
I know it must seem like empty words, superficial.. but, to me it’s really not.
</p>
<p>
When you’re about to do SRS, contact me if you feel like you’d want someone to talk to, or help! I had others help me through this, I’d be happy to pass it along!

I just wanna say too, that I see it healing. It looks tighter, and your black area looks like it’s shrinking.
</p>
<p>
I hope you see this. Look at your day 10-13, then look at day 20. You’re getting there

That’s day 20? I’m on day 13, and I don’t have catheter anymore. Also, I’m working on the second largest dilator already.

<p>
I’m sorry that you’re struggling.

Well because I have necrosis, they preferred to leave the catheter so the urethra doesn&#39;t close because of the necrosis. On 19th of September I have a revision with my surgeon and maybe they will remove it then.

Congrats!!! Don’t give up! I was really discouraged by healing , my whole outer skin turned black and I thought my surgery failed and I did everything wrong but I found out basically your vagina sheds so much skin to rebuild into new beautiful healthy skin. Now she’s new and gorgeous! Yours will be too !! Give it time, take care of yourself and your mental health, it can be very daunting but you got this!!!! The human body is an amazing thing! 🖤 congratulations!

I am so sorry you&#39;ve had to go through all of this, sweetheart. I&#39;ve been following your progress for a little while now, and even though I haven&#39;t commented yet, I want you to know you have someone in your corner. Even if it is just an internet stranger!

I don’t want to make you feel like I’m hug boxing but I’ve been following you this whole time as many of us have. And maybe it’s just the angle? But it definitely looks to be improving! Looks like there is less black tissue now. You are incredibly strong and I have a feeling everything will work out for you🫶🏼 just don’t lose hope!

Around week 3 is where it was the hardest for me (currently 6.5 months post op). You&#39;ll get through this and I promise it gets better.

It will no doubt feel odd coming out but don&#39;t lay awake dreading it.  Its done in seconds and its over with.  If you in pain with it in?  That is really the thing to be concerned about.
</p>
<p>
Due to urological problems not related I&#39;ve become well versed in catheters of all sorts (SIGH) and let me just say them removing it (Assuming they deflate the balloon) should be just a bit uncomfortable while they are doing it.
</p>
<p>
Having it in &#34;shouldn&#39;t&#34; be horrible but I keep hearing the same bad stuff going on.
</p>
<p>
1) Are they doing daily cleaning from where it enters the urethera and out a bit?  I was sent home with one that wasn&#39;t ever cleaned in the hospital and of course no one told me to do it so it got worse and worse.  In my experience if not done it gets crusty and hurts and the longer it goes unwashed the worst it gets.  Nothing special just keep it clean and not have any dried up gunk.  Dabbing a small bit of water based lube (Ask the Nurse if this is right) where it enters sometimes is a good way to minimize pain (But the regular cleaning is more important)
</p>
<p>
2) It shouldn&#39;t be able to move around or worse be hanging and pulling.  If I&#39;m &#34;Foly-ed&#34; I want it taped in two places so the cath tubing / hose can&#39;t be moving or pulling horizontally.  I can&#39;t tell you how many pix I&#39;ve seen without anything secured and its the movement on your very tender urethera that causes most of the pain.  The ones left hanging with the tubing or worse the collection bag pulling are just... Unspeakably bad.
</p>
<p>
There are some other things to watch out for.  Is the collection bag getting a steady stream of urine or is nothing happening?  If nothing is happening someone either did something really dumb like not inflated the balloon that keeps the openings inside the bladder or the balloon broke as happened once.  Ouch!
</p>
<p>
If it hurts you please!  You must speak up and advocate for yourself.  Don&#39;t let them blow it off there is no reason it should be such a horror show.
</p>
<p>
There really is nothing to be done about sizing caths after surgery but I think any girls before surgery would be well advised to ask them to please NOT select a huge catheter (Diameter wise) to insure you don&#39;t leak.  They can really go overboard because nothing in nurses training says they have any first hand experience with having one in.  *And I don&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t?  It certainly wouldn&#39;t hurt them to know what it feels like and more important how doing it wrong can make something that for people who are cathing long term feels &#34;odd&#34; to instead end up feeling terribly painful.
</p>
<p>
I really should write an oped or something shouldn&#39;t I?  Too much first hand experiences.
</p>
<p>
And one last bit maybe not directly related but during your recovery they will send you home with some strong pain meds.  Its my experience that (opiates) constipate you and whats worse then that combined with recovering from GRS?  The brand names are different but there are stool softeners Colace in the USA and two types of laxatives.  Senekot which I&#39;m probably not spelling rite and the stuff with fiber ;ole miralax you mix with water and drink.  Take all three!  *This from my doctor btw not me.
</p>
<p>
This might be only me but if I try to avoid taking the pain meds for too long I &#34;get behind&#34; the pain and it seems impossible to catch up.  Or like a friend you want to tough it out without pain meds. I&#39;m a wimp and if I&#39;m in serious pain I can&#39;t sleep.  At least with the pills I can sleep 3 or 4 hours at a time.
</p>
<p>
When your recovering from any major surgery its usually at least 6 weeks before things are &#34;ok&#34; enough to resume most normal activities but... In every case (with me)  before the 6 weeks there will be a day I thought I was fine.  And feeling great and I overdid things.  Like a long walk that when you come back from hurts like blazes for 2 or 3 days. Listen to something, veg out to the TV or whatever just give yourself the time to heal.

This is a subreddit for trans surgeries and I&#39;m doing a daily view of the progression of my SRS so I think there is no problem with doing this. And the support group, well it saved my life with all the beautiful comments and keeps me looking straight forward and fighting.
