The tea hitting this sub lately...
</p>
<p>
It would be good if someone who&#39;s had a recent consultation could share how many revisions he has to do.  It&#39;s definitely something a surgeon shouldn&#39;t have a problem sharing.

I&#39;m so very sorry you had to go through this. It sucks to be botched.
</p>
<p>
This is seriously making me reconsider Avanessian as my surgeon. Mt. Sinai can&#39;t be bothered to even continue the process of setting up a consult for me and it&#39;s really starting to irk me.

Same with me. I started the process back in March and only just now got my social worker visit and I&#39;m still not scheduled for the actual thing!

After reading this I&#39;m less enthused about them

I did the social worker visit and they said they&#39;d contact me with the next steps. That was weeks ago.

Their apathy is really throwing up a lot of red flags for me.

Thanks for the tip! Since I posted that comment I actually booked a surgery date with Dr. Bluebond-Langner. My surgery is in just under 1 year!

I&#39;m literally going through the same process. I started with Sinai to try and get things going and since then switched to McGinn and am going for a consult with her in November rather than even bothering with Sinai at all. They seem difficult to get into and McGinn feels like she has a solid reputation and so far everything I&#39;ve seen is making me feel more and more confident in my choice to do that, including your comment.

Damn this is kind of freaking me out. I have a consult with Avanessian in January. I didn&#39;t really make any consults with other surgeons for SRS but now I&#39;m wondering if I should. I know all the experts have year+ wait times which really really sucks :(

Thanks for being open about your experience there for people. I’ve had two surgeries with mount Sinai and while I can say I’m happy with the work done I agree that their opaque office communication is very frustrating to deal with.
</p>
<p>
I assume this has to be in part because of heavy interest due to some surgeons reputations and the fact they are in everyone’s network, and I wonder if it is time for people to start lobbying the hospital to expand admin staffing in this dept.

Most definitely!  What’s really frustrating is the sparse aftercare and lack of communication to patients before surgery and after surgery. The first 6 or so months after surgery there’s still residual swelling and us as patients don’t know any better so we assume that if “anything doesn’t look right it’s just swelling”, when that’s not the case. they’ve taken on so many cases they leave you hanging. They need to first and foremost hold Ting responsible, due to him being the head of that practice and stop him from botching women! either retrain him or bar him all together.  Not only is this 1 week after my initial SRS I went to have the packing taken out and his first words were “where’s the clitoris?”, I looked at him like “you did the surgery and your asking me this?”.....fast forward 3 months post op I go to have the skin bridge removed from the vaginal opening, which he didn’t do himself a medical student did because they overbooked patients, I had developed an abscess/seroma on the opening of my urethra, he looked at it and said “I have no idea what that is....” 😳😳 your the Doctor! All he did was drain it and literally said it will come back, he didn’t offer to have the abscess sack removed or nothing, I drained it myself until it stop coming back!
</p>
<p>
My mission now that it’s 3 years later I’m no longer embarrassed to speak on this and put myself on the line. I’m seeing other girls with the same issues. I’m on many social outlets warning Transwomen about both Mount Sinai and Dr Jess Ting and their horrible practices.
</p>
<p>
My trans sisters don’t end up like me! Do not let Jess Ting operate on you! Either go to Thailand or Go to surgeons who have been doing this for over a decade and NOT since 2016-2017. I understand due to insurance now covering SRS you want to get the surgery ASAP but don’t end up like me!

I can’t speak on Bella’s SRS Results b/c I’ve never seen her results but her FFS is amazing and she’s so passionate about what she does and understanding. As for Jess Ting all I can say is that he will NEVER touch me again!

I can confirm this. You have a lot in common with what I was dealing with.
<br>
I&#39;m having revisions done somewhere else to resolve a lot that you&#39;re discussing. Everyone I know who went to him in this timeframe has the same peeing issue. I&#39;m peeing straight between the toiled bowl and toilet seat, it really sucks.

I had my local trans surgeon look into my peeing problem, he used to be a Urologist. He didn&#39;t want to work on me, and directed me back to Dr. Ting.
</p>
<p>
He was able to get Ting on the phone, and relayed the message that the distended urinary tract can happen during healing, and said he could address it during revisions. So I&#39;m unable to get local help because the surgeon doesn&#39;t want to step on Tings toes.
</p>
<p>
After getting a hold of someone at his office, I found out he doesn&#39;t do revisions until after a full year of healing. So if I go back to him, I would have to pee all over the place until I can fly back over there. This is also when I found out he was planning on doing a two-part surgery anyways. Now I don&#39;t know what to do 🤷🏻‍♀️
</p>
<p>
Side note: Ting doesn&#39;t fix distended urinary tracts, they have a separate Urologist do it, and I would have to get this assessed by one of their urologists, despite them already getting a call from a local surgeon who made an assessment... Going to Ting from out of state has been a massive money suck... 😔

I live in upstate ny  and there’s a urologist in Syracuse who fixes urinary complications after srs but he dosent feel comfortable doing it yet because he hasn’t had any contact from mt Sinai.  Dr ting and his pa both have ignored my emails so now I emailed Alicia. I just regret going to ting from the start 😢

Alicia is forgetful, I guess? I never rely on them to call me back, I just keep calling. I related this info to my insurance as well, since they were expecting a call back. Pick a day of the week and call 3 times. Has worked well for me the past 2 years I&#39;ve been in contact with them.

Mount Sinai, ting and his staff are the definitional Incompetent. Once they’re done with you and collected your money you’re put on the back burner you literally have to show up in person to get results

Baby they’re horrible. When it comes to peeing that day I had the catheter taken out they’re supposed to make you pee before you leave the office, if you can’t pee they’re supposed to put the catheter back in that day. They didn’t do ANY of that with me. They took out the packing, took out the catheter, showed me how to dilate and then showed me the door.

I only saw him the day of my surgery for less than a minute and the consultation, that&#39;s it. I had a surgeon on his team give me his cell number if I needed any help and he checked in on me after being discharged.

<p>
Bella stopped over and said hi while I was an inpatient. Not him though.

I had issues with my peeing, but it has a lot to do with tissue healing and inflammation. It fully resolved after about a year.

Oh I&#39;m sorry for your plight. I&#39;m not versed in SRS and will never have it but I do hope you find a surgeon who can correct the aesthetic side of things. I had a look at the pics and I hope I&#39;m right, and it looks like it is fixable? If there are no functional complications then all hope is not lost. I know how difficult being botched is. It affects you a lot physically and mentally xxx

Thank you so much dear, yes thankfully it’s fixable I’ve contacted Marci Bowers and showed her the pics she’s able to fix where Ting failed. I was added to her waiting list last January and my surgery date is 2022, I would go to McGuinn b/c she’s good and closer to me I live in NY and she’s in PA, but she’s out of network with insurance  and I can’t afford her costs
