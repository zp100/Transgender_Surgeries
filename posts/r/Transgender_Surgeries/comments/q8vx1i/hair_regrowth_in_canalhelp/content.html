That surgeon did you a major disservice by saying you didnâ€™t need laser. I hope the sources here can help you!

Talk to your doctor. Mine said it can be fixed with silver nitrate which, while painful, is not a major operation.

I don&#39;t think anyone has done that and reported back after more than a year so its not clear it will work. I hope so, but suspect not.

Hiya, I did get it done however I was told it may not be a permanent solution depending on if the hair follicles survive. You could get regular treatments until they stop regrowing. Fortunately it turned out to not be painful at all, just a little cold and ticklish.

I think you&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve come across who&#39;s posted about surgery with him. It would be nice if you could post a review sometime.

I used hemostats to remove it. I used very large ones without any sharp edges and was obviously rather careful. I would do this after dilation and was rather diligent (weekly). It&#39;s not completely gone, but very nearly. Anyways, unlike epilating hair on the skins surface, to my amazement, the hair within the canal lessened with extraction. As a bonus, the hair came out quite readily and rather painlessly so  it was nice to see it was superficial and not deep rooted. After a number of years you find that your body continues to morph and the 3 years they tell you is your transition period is a bit of lie. You continue to show subtle changes years later after the fact. Hope this info is encouraging.

After my PI I occasionally got hair &#34;clots&#34; come out when douching for 2-3 years and thought the hair had stopped. They seemed very delicate from being sort of in a semi-liquid environment.
</p>
<p>
A month ago I had an endoscope in there and was surprised that the urologist (also a PI surgeon) told me I still had hair in there.
</p>
<p>
I guess maybe the pH in there may slowly dissolve them so that I don&#39;t see them.

Yes...I found if that I reached around my buttocks and inserted my thumb, I could feel the hairs on the floor of my vagina. I also realized that if I could locate it in that manner that I could also grasp it with hemostats and remove it. Like everything on this journey it took longer than I had hoped or imagined, but regardless, through diligence and consistency, with time I made it a non-issue. This &#34;transition&#34; is actually a life long odyssey. Like growing up and growing old there is no destination that makes itself known. I think our real goal comes from understanding that we have taken a new path with a different destination and with that comes an entirely different journey than the one we were originally set to walk. We literally gift ourselves to be on Frost&#39;s &#34;Road not taken&#34;. Given that circumstance, we&#39;re going to end up with some bizarre workarounds like this very one to eventually get ourselves to where we need to be. As a group, we&#39;re nothing if not hopeful, optimistic and tenacious. :-)

Any hair I have isn&#39;t in the vestibule, otherwise  I could see it in a mirror. I kinda doubt that I could feel any of the fine silky ones against skin when still attached. That clot of short 1cm shed hair I last remember from about 20 years back.

Any particular brand / kind /size of instrument ?
</p>
<p>
How old was your vag at the time ?
</p>
<p>
Like I said, I had a shed / clot of hair come out every so often with soapy warm mini-douch up to year 3 and have not had another since.
</p>
<p>
So could your cease of hair growth inside partially be linked to the time inside you (like mine) mostly not be findable except by endoscope or essentially medical
<em>
pliers
</em>
?

That was my point. After years of the hair being in a foreign environment, I think the hair lost viability and just kind of gave up the ghost. My mechanical plucking certainly hastened the hairs phasing out but it was probably going to go away on its own eventually. I was cleared by year 6 by my own estimation. Between ongoing hrt, age and whatever else I do believe the hair gives up.

I think mine largely stopped, though I guess some still hang on in there according to urologist (and PI surgeon) Dr. Witten in Louisville.
</p>
<p>
I was surprised that some have persisted but I doubt anyone could feel them, as sparse and short as they are likely to be.
