Just finished 2 hours of electrolysis with E3000 in Dallas. Had the injections , few pictures, Iâ€™ve been worrying about this all day driving here.
</p>
<p>
Pictures are 30 minutes after, when I finished 30 minutes ago I was really swollen but she told me a lot of it was from the lidocaine injections.  Definitely some bruising but again from the injections.  For the most part the electrolysis was painless, just a few points where the lidocaine hadnâ€™t got to.   The injections were of course painful, but done in batches and the pain was just a minute at a time for each location.
<br>
Over all Iâ€™m super pleased with this and booked another session in 7 weeks.    I have been having the electrolysis for a long time on and off, have done 2 previous sessions at 8 hours and was super swollen.  Iâ€™m happy with the swelling, just hope the bruising goes quickly.

Make sure to keep it clean and out of the sun for the next few days.  I sometimes get whiteheads a few days afterword&#39;s.

Yep, itâ€™s about aftercare now for a few days, out in the bar now with my first beer today.  This weekend cloudy so Iâ€™ll have no problem with the sun.   Just a question of when I can put my warpaint on now before but Iâ€™m amazed that now all the swelling has virtually gone ðŸ˜Š

It never will until itâ€™s gone.   After sleeping quite a few small bruises, swelling almost gone. I did go out for dinner last night, when I did both my 8 hour sessions it was 3 days before I went out the door.  So itâ€™s working and thatâ€™s the main point of it.

God I hated electrolysis! Might have been better if the bitch I was going to wasn&#39;t a criminal who undertreated and plucked and then called that regrowth. I actually have scars from itðŸ¥º
</p>
<p>
I switched to dermatologist laser and will epilate the lighter hairs after the dark are destroy. Best to you! ðŸ’—ðŸ˜Š

Itâ€™s difficult to chose who we use and when we find good ones we tend to stay with them

Yes. I donâ€™t know how anyone can do it without but I canâ€™t do more than an hour with just cream.   What do you use.

Thatâ€™s what keeps me from going there. The website creeps me out.

Just over $200 for a full 2 hours.   Given that I pay $80 for an hour with my electrolysis and she canâ€™t clear half of what they did plus so much more pain itâ€™s very good value when comparing like for like.
</p>
<p>
However for me a 4 hour drive each way plus hotel costs then it adds up.  Yet Iâ€™ll do it again because of the virtually no pain for 2 hours, yes the injections hurt but no where near what I expected.
</p>
<p>
Another downside is the bruises, I had dental type injections for both lips and 90% of the chin so no bruising there.
</p>
<p>
I think using my electrolysis would take 3 or 4 1 hour sessions to clear the same.   Iâ€™ve been to roughly 10 different electrolysis places in Europe and the States.  I would say the BG girl who worked on me yesterday was definitely the fastest I have ever had   This is a real factor when you start talking about multiple hours. With the injections it allowed her to blast away without me flinching and moaning.   Definitely a trade off and everyone will have to work out there own economics for this based on travel and stay.
