As a nurse who worked in the ORs for several years…I’m a bit suspicious
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Anytime a surgical procedure says no risk of complications I am seeing a red flag. Minimal risk, low risk sure. No risk? There is risk with any surgery. Eddie Rickenbacker US WWI ace pilot nearly died from loss of blood following a tonsillectomy…
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I’m suspicious also about the placement of the prostheses on the iliac crest. Firstly there is the animation, which doesn’t show the prosthesis going into a location it would result in that shape.  2.a. Also look at the shape of the prosthesis. There’s the bump out, but think about how that’s going to look. I am not picturing how that is going to create that smooth line. I’m picturing something like a pretty obvious bump out like a chair rail.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The iliac crest, where they show the prosthesis being place and slid over… doesn’t take into account that there are muscles that attach there. hip flexors, the internal and external abdominal oblique muscles, the erector spinae muscles, the latissimus dorsi, the transversus abdominis, and the tensor fasciae latae. Where there are muscles there are vessels and nerves (see number one… there are risks inherent to messing with those things)
</p>

</ol>

I sort of have this V-line on my abdomen, right over where my iliac crest is.  the v line is sort of a &#34;ditch&#34; inward,  i&#39;ve always figured that if they could just put something on my iliac crest, it would bump it out just enough to smooth out that line.  Besides, i figure that anyone really skinny/emaciated the iliac crest would sorta bump out, but if you have a normal amount of muscle and fat is should be fine, but that&#39;s pure speculation.  i hate how the narrowest part of my waist is around the iliac crest instead of around the bottom of my ribcage like all cis women without any exception have, and as far as i know this iliac crest implant would be the only thing that might fix that, i don&#39;t think bbl would help because it seems skeletal.

<p>
there are muscles on the iliac crest, but not on the very peak of the iliac crest right?  I mean i can feel the bone there, and on medical diagrams it looks like the very peak of it is exposed, is that not so?

interested in your informed opinions.

The pelvis is covered in muscle connections. I’ve been trying to find something I could use to show where everything connects is isn’t so full of medical termination that it’s useless. Some would show the nerves others the vessels but here’s one that just shows the muscles. English is not the presenter’s first language.

You also may be right, in your case you may have a situation where that particular prosthesis might help you. I’m not seeing how it could be of much use in a trans feminine use. It may work better with a cis woman (or a trans woman who didn’t do male puberty)

So yes there do seem to be a buncha muscles that attach to the lip of the iliac crest but there&#39;s also a bony part near the top, on the outer side, which doesn&#39;t have any connections right?  i image they would just find that bony part and mount and implant on it to push out the flesh a bit.  there could possibly be some weird internal friction of it rubbing against a muscle.
</p>
<p>
IDK, idk, i am only speculating.
</p>
<p>
i guess i have enough faith that they wouldn&#39;t mess up any muscles, but my main worry is that even with a healthy amount of fat and muscle, it would STILL be this sharp lump that sticks out of my side and looks bumpy instead of smooth.  the pictures on the website don&#39;t seem to show this, but that&#39;s probably because it&#39;s immediately post op, and the doctors also did a minor bit of lipo sculpting, and also they all seem to be wearing those granny panties that cover up the surgery area.  idk what they&#39;d look like if they lost some weight, if they bent over or were in some odd pose, of if they flexed their abs and sucked in a little, or whatever.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the real point of this implant is to form a sort of a &#34;shelf&#34; for the autologous fat grafts to sit upon.
</p>
<p>
As for who can benefit from this surgery (assuming there are no side effects and it works as intended, and as the sample pictures would have you believe), here&#39;s my analysis:
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think it would be useful for a cis woman or a trans woman who didn&#39;t do male puberty.
</p>
<p>
cis women universally have their natural waist (the narrowest part of their torso) at the bottom of their ribcage, a couple inches above the belly button, which is where high waisted pants will land.  the cross section at the iliac crest is skeletally always wider than the bottom of the ribcage.  for early transitioning trans women, this tends to be the case too.
</p>
<p>
in this case, widening the iliac crest just accentuates what they already have.  i don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary, because as long as the natural waist is in the right place, visually/aesthetically it doesn&#39;t makes that much of a difference if it&#39;s by a lot or by a little.  As long as it&#39;s there, then it&#39;s the waist/hip ratio that makes the biggest difference.
</p>
<p>
A lot of cis men/AMABs who did go through testosterone puberty actually ALSO have their natural waist below the ribcage, above the belly button.  some of these AMAB individuals become trans women later in life.  i don&#39;t think this surgery would help such trans women, for the same reason.
</p>
<p>
This surgery i think would only benefit trans women like me who unfortunately have our natural waist below the belly button, about where a low or mid rise pair of jeans would hit, because the bottom of the rib cage is wider than the iliac crest.  By expanding the iliac crest, it widens that area which makes the new narrowest point be above the belly button.
</p>
<p>
However, if your lower hip around the trochanter (like at crotch level) is narrow, if this area is about the same width the circumference around your iliac crest, then the surgery here would just give your entire hips this point-down triangular look, which you can actually see in some of the sample pictures that the website in the original post provides.  i think this is kind of ugly.  basically, if your natural waist is low but you don&#39;t have hips, then this procedure, even if it works, would give you this unnatural look.
</p>
<p>
so basically, if you&#39;re a trans woman, your natural waist is low, but you sort of have a bit of hips to work with, then you&#39;d benefit from this, which is a very small group of people.

<p>
Do you see how in this picture (which is AI generated presumably but still), the narrowest part of his torso is right over his iliac crests?  That&#39;s what I mean, it gives the person this V-torso shape

I’d honestly be worried about the long term consequences of titatnium hip implants but on the other hand this would probably be better for me than a BBL. I’m not saying this is definitely dangerous, but studies have shown that some people suffer titanium poisoning due to long exposure to titanium implants.

I just skimmed a few papers on it and you&#39;re right. But only 1-3% suffer these side effects. Still, I think this is a cool option!

I can’t see how anyone could offer elective surgery with even a 1% death rate. BBL was considered exceptionally dangerous when it was 1 in 3000.

The risk I quoted is for someone who is healthy. If someone is in the process of dying and gets surgery the odds would be rather worse.

Well, fuck.
</p>
<p>
I got hit by a truck and broke my hip ~10 years ago. I got surgical steel implants to repair the bone. Then I had to get the implants removed because I was allergic to the nickel and cobalt in the surgical steel. I always thought, “well, if I ever have to get another implant I’ll jus use titanium and it will be fine.”  Now I’m doubting that. And my hip is starting to hurt more, meaning I’ll likely need to get it replaced with titanium. But knowing my body I’ll react to is 😑

all of the studies I could find were about joint replacements assumed to be induced by metal wear (microscopic shavings by friction)
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think a device installed in such a low friction area (just surrounded by immobile bone and soft tissue) would be as much of a problem.
</p>
<p>
still a risk, but I&#39;d think even less than the standard 1-3% for high friction devices (for hips, necks, etc) under actual mechanical load.

This looks really amazing, and I would probably do it in a second if I could snap my fingers and make my hips even more feminine than they are already (from HRT).
</p>
<p>
However, this surgery is being done by doctors, i.e., people who are known to screw up. In fact, I grew up watching my mother suffer in horrific pain for two decades before she passed. A doctor, who was supposedly doing &#34;a very minor back procedure,&#34; damaged her spinal cord, causing extreme muscle contraction 24/7 and severe musculoskeletal distress. Subsequent doctors caused even more damage in trying to help her. She died at a relatively young age after her organs gradually shut down from the original injury.
</p>
<p>
After seeing her suffering all those years, I&#39;ve vowed to never let a doctor touch me unless it&#39;s a matter of life-or-death (and even then I would have to think twice). Please be careful, everyone...

Someone find out how much this is please! I just got excited for this! I&#39;ve been terrified of having to get a BBL because of the risk of fat embolism. I know going to someone reputable basically reduces the risk to very low, but I&#39;m still paranoid that I&#39;ll be the one that dies from it lol.

you should make a whole post about it, i&#39;m sure many would be very interested.  i&#39;m interested in how they prevent it from looking lumpy, with the implant sharply pushing out a bump.

I don’t know about this. My curvy cis gf would be a stick if it wasn’t for like 2 inches of fat above her trochanter. Even at her thinnest she carries fat there. Her hip bones are way under there. She’s been nice enough to let me poke around a bunch. Lol.
</p>
<p>
Based off my “research” on a live subject I’d be willing to conclude fat transfer is the way to go.

But I mean, like, I think i might want my iliac crest area to be wider too, so that it raises my waistline and it looks more feminine.  i&#39;m not sure if just fat there would cut it.

I dunno, looks sketchy af. Those photos aren&#39;t exactly honest in that they&#39;re excluding everything else. Looks scammy or the clinic is inept at communicating things. Take your pick.

I am planning to do this pelvic plasty in Korea this coming May. I will keep you all posted and I will give my honest opinion. I will post my before and after picture. I am digging for more information before I say 100% yes to this.

Thank you for sharing this. I also got the same price quotation - they&#39;re pretty consistent. And they told me that patients need to stay at least 1 week.
</p>
<p>
Something I&#39;d highly consider rather than a butt implant and/or BBL.
</p>
<p>
They also did the surgery on a MTF patient.

They called her male transgender 😡. A mistake with English but they need some gender sensitivity training and to correct their English.  They probably used a translation service.

It’s happened a lot with transgender-related surgeons, they quite often don’t use the right pronouns even on academic articles. Or they might do in front of you, but using the wrong pronoun or wrong terminology on academic papers. I’m not exactly sure why that’s the case.

*Update* I asked them to send me a review about the surgery and they sent me this link:
<a href="https://cafe.naver.com/feko/5383052" rel="nofollow"><strong>
here
</strong></a>
<strong>
.
</strong>
<br>
(It is in Korean and it seems you need membership (or Korean phone number) to verify. Does anyone have access to the link?)

I have access. I created an account. Any phone number will do. You only have to pick what country are you in. When you get in choose the English coz they are in Korean language. I could not find the review yet about the pelvic plasty.

I dont see the point of getting large love handles installed. The results are really weird looking. BBL FTW
