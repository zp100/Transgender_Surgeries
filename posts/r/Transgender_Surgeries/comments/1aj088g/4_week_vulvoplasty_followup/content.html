Why did you choose vulvoplasty if you don’t mind me asking? Because I am starting to struggle with trying to figure out which one I want to go with.

I am a raging Virgo and made a spreadsheet comparing all of the options from orchi and scrotectomy to vaginoplasty and PPT vaginoplasty and vulvoplasty. In the end these were the factors that lead me here: * I am married to a woman and do not really care about penetration * I didn&#39;t have to have any hair removal * I don&#39;t have to dilate * The surgery is arguably less invasive with easier recovery
</p>
<p>
If I were younger and thought that maybe sometime in my future I might switch sides and try sex with a man that would have changed the equation considerably but I am 60 and very committed to my wife

All the same reasons I chose the same. Mine&#39;s not until May.

Not saying you made a bad choice or anything, but I wanted to point out that women can penetrate. Even a woman who doesn&#39;t have a penis can use sex toys or her fingers to penetrate her sexual partner.
</p>
<p>
Congratulations on your surgery. I&#39;m glad it went well and you got what you wanted.

Thank you. And that&#39;s true but as I said it doesn&#39;t interest me

7 months ago I finally discovered vulopasty and it has shine a new light to my transition. I was already on HRT at the time.
</p>
<p>
I agree that I have similar reasons why I would choose Vuloplasty over other options.
</p>
<p>
-No dilation needed -No need if Hair removal  -Better recovery -still has the same appearance compared to vaginoplasty -Less invasive with less complications vs vaginoplasty -Very affirming being able to wear clothes correctly  -No need of T blockers and don’t need to worry about progression is reversing due to T producing organ (Only regarding Testies) “I understand that the adranal gland produces T too but no where near Testies can. -helps with updating my gender marker on my legal documents to Female
</p>
<p>
Those are my reasons.
