These are my results 22 days after surgery. the red circles show where the stitches/ staples haven&#39;t dissolved yet. Apparently I had an abnormality in my pelvis that resulted in Tina having a choice between me having a shallow depth (~2.5 inches) and trying to get more depth at an increased risk of creating a perforation into the rectum. She chose  to go for the lack of depth and I am quite happy with this as I am Queer and not very interested in penetration and it seems perfectly adequate for fingering. I am a little in the dark as to how she did not pick up the anomaly during examination and i intend to bring this up with her and will try to post updates as the healing progresses.
</p>
<p>
As far as I can see everything is healing very well and I can barely see most of the scars. Dilation has been fairly easy and i have more or less not had to use the smaller dilator (orange coloured) I was given,  since around 14 days post op, and have been able to go straight to the medium (purple coloured)  during each dilation, which i was instructed to do 3 times per day until my follow up at 10-12 weeks. I had a suspected urinary tract infection around the catheter and that was honestly by far the most painful part of the process. After the operation i did not need morphine and thus was not constipated but i am aware that this is not a usual case. I was prescribed paracetamol (acetomenophen)  and ibuprofen and have been taking them 3 times per day since being discharged. i was also told douching was optional for me, and i had been doing it once per day.
</p>
<p>
I noticed a slightly sweet earthy smell coming  from my vagina at around 20 days and was a little  worried I may have a yeast infection, possibly from the lube i was using, but was experiencing no elevation in pain, a bit of googling suggests that this is probably the vaginal microbiome establishing itself, which if true will be great news. there were some suggestions that douching at this point may be counter productive to the microbiome so i am going to experiment with stopping. Overall apart from some bleeding during the packing being removed that was quickly stopped with temporary repacking with gauze, i have had no discharge whatsoever and have been able to let everything heal in the air.
</p>
<p>
The combination of factors from the shallow vagina to the ability to let things air out may have led to what i feel seems like very fast healing and im overjoyed with the results so far even if they were not the ones i was expecting.
</p>
<p>
A few tips from my experience:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you definitely want a doughnut cushion to sit on, it wasnt included in all of the myriad lists they gave me so i didnt get one initially. Trust me, you will not be able to sit on anything that does not support your back and keep weight off your crotch initially.
</li>
<li>
I was not initially mentioned to me until a nurse thought of it, but early on both in hospital and at homeyou&#39;re probably going to want to ice the area multiple times a day (for no more than 20 minutes). when i mentioned this to other patients, they had not been told about it either and were equally enthusiastic once they tried it.
</li>
<li>
You will likely get hot flushes and be very emotional during your stay as you have been off hormones for a month and are experiencing an entire menopause within the space of about a 1-2 weeks. Be patient with yourself, you will probably feel a lot better once you can restart your hormones in 1-2 weeks.
</li>
<li>
In the hospital they give you compression stocking and these are also very good at keeping your legs warm (temperatures were around 4-7degrees C during my stay), whilst being able to keep the room cool to deal with hot flushes, and stay in just a hospital gown with occasional use of a dressing gown .  When i left hospital my legs were getting cold and i first tried hold up stockings. i found that they didnt hold up very well so i switched to crotchless tights which are much better. i suspect a garter belt may be superior to this option though.
</li>
<li>
Bring your own dressing gown. the ones at the hospital are thin and not great. Dont bring any pajamas, you wont want anything anywhere near your crotch and they will get dirty. when you get home get some loose  nightdresses and my preference for underwear when you have to wear it is loose soft cotton boxers. some &#39;boyshorts&#39; can be quite clingy around the crotch so try to avoid them. i found regular knickers tortuously tight around my crotch and I wouldnt advise them.
</li>
<li>
When you go home buy some bed/ furniture protector pads for where you intend to sit/ dilate. There can be discharge and blood when dilating and although I didn&#39;t have these it is still messy with lube,  and it will save you having to wash sheets or stop you from staining chairs.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Edit: 9th Feb 2022 I have found that I can drastically cut down on the pain killers,  and take them as needed.  There are still painful twinges (that tbh ibuprofen and paracetamol aren&#39;t very good for) and some areas that are still painful if stretched, but on the whole the pain is not noticeable.
</p>
<p>
Edit 11th Apr 2023 I&#39;ve had a number of questions asking for updates and if I&#39;d recommend Tina.I can&#39;t give a clear yes/no answer. I came out with a lot less depth than I would have expected due to peculiarities of my tendons that she and James [Bellringer]explained couldn&#39;t have been foreseen, and couldn&#39;t could have caused a pierced bowel had she tried to get more depth. That could be an attempt to cover herself, but the fact that she erred on the side of caution makes me inclined to believe her. Some issues that that make difficult to assign blame to Tina or the hospital (Parkside) are my notes being completely lost and not recovered before surgery, and poor English skills making communication very difficult across the board. This left only James, Tina and one of the the special nurses (who was not assigned to me) as easily answer my questions. Additionally; Covid quarantine was in effect at the time, so I had to get tests done at very short notice and had no time to verify deal with any of the errors that came up while remaining in isolation at the hotel. the issue of my lost notes could have been solved if I could simply have delayed the surgery for a week. Several issues were clearly caused by the hospital although may not have been better at any other hospital  such as losing my belongings. All I can say regarding whether id  recommend her is that is that she appears to be at least as competent as James Bellringer, and their reputations from what i could find are at least as good as any other UK surgeons. i&#39;m at least happy with what i have; relatively speaking. I would have liked more depth, but if that wasn&#39;t possible, she did a great job aesthetically, as well as possible, functionally (i was first able to orgasm using my fingers at around 6 months, possibly earlier if id tried).  and left me with no complications and fast healing.

Thanks very much for posting, and congratulations! Very few photos of her results. I have a consult with her this Month. Your recovery and result looks good for ~3 weeks out!  A fistulla is what worries me most, will no doubt discuss at consult.

She did indeed talk about fistula, as did specialist nurse Laura Mita. Apparently Tina and James Bellringer get them in under 1% of cases and haven&#39;t had any for some time. There is an interview worth James somewhere on YouTube in which he answers this which Iwill try to find later.  I think there is also an info booklet that she will give you and the app called My Recovery if you choose to download it.

Hi there,
</p>
<p>
Can I ask how long it was from your surgical referrals with the GIC to your surgery? I’m about to have my appointments and probably picking Tina
</p>
<p>
Your result looks great :)

Thanks, I&#39;m ecstatic about the results so far. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t recall exactly and I&#39;ve just thrown the letters away,  but I&#39;m pretty confident it was between 2 and 3 years with an original operation date in October, that I turned down because it was too close to Xmas.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I was wrong, I still had an email version of the referral. One year to the month was the original date that I was offered, which i deferred by 3 months. I don&#39;t expect it will be that fast in future as there is likely a backlog. On the other hand James Bellringer informed me that he intended to put all of his time into trans surgery so that might mitigate the waiting times somewhat. The answer is I do not know exactly what waiting time you can expect, but i am giving you all of the information that I have.
