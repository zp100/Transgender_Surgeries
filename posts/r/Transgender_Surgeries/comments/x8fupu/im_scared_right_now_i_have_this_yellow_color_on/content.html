surgical healing is a very messy and ugly process, which can include discharge, wound mucus, and the like. it is normal, though considering the necrosis it should be under way more scrutiny. i do think your necrotic tissue looks better than it did, and seems to be coming off. do not be afraid to send daily pictures to your surgeon and ask any questions you have (there is no amount that is too much, you require more care than the average patient right now - dont feel guilty or let them make you feel like you&#39;re pestering them - its their job to medically help you through this).
</p>
<p>
also do not be afraid to email other surgeons/gender affirming care centers in your area and get second opinions. you wont be &#34;cheating&#34; on your surgeon - it&#39;s your body, not theirs.
</p>
<p>
you will get through this babe, and we all wish you the best üíïüíïüíïüíïüíï

Thank you so much for this ‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
Yeah I already sent my surgeon the photo and called the hospital to ask them. Sadly it&#39;s 11.37 pm here so I can&#39;t have an accurate answer. But a friend of mine that&#39;s a nurse told me that&#39;s something normal on the wound. And yeah some part of the necrosis is coming off and I can see under it. So now I&#39;m a little more relaxed and waiting for the answer of my surgeon tomorrow morning.

<p>
basically from my (not medical background) research what i understand is the necrotic tissue you have is basically in the vein of a large scab. what happens when the scab comes off, or when your body has an open wound (SRS creates a lot of them - think burn victim/deep large cut) is your body secretes &#34;wound mucus&#34; over the young exposed healing tissue. i wouldnt pull the scab off bc the new skin area underneath is probably still healing.
</p>
<p>
what you should watch for is any
<em>
oozing
</em>
blood or discharge, especially from wounds. not like, discharge or lube from your vagina, but fluid literally pouring out of you or your incisions, especially with a very milky texture or greenish black color, or an extremely foul smell. also be on the lookout for
<em>
unbearable
</em>
pain, the completely debilitating kind.
</p>
<p>
i am not a medical professional, so please ask your surgeon to explain it all in heavy detail, not short answers. also keep the area clean; my surgeon recommends ivory soap (no scrubbing the area, glide your soapy hands over it).
</p>
<p>
youre welcome girl üíï please try to occupy yourself with joyful things in the meantime

That yellow is a generally a good sign especially from where you were.  Its a normal part of the healing process especially after loosing some tissue due to necrosis or loss of blood supply to part of the skin.  It often is &#34;Serous fluid&#34; which aids the healing process by providing a moist, nourishing environment for the skin to repair.
</p>
<p>
As Lith1um mentioned what you really want to look for is expanding necrosis or foul discharge.  Both indications of infection.  But as it stands right now that angle looks much better than your last set of pictures.

Having been following your posts I think it‚Äôs starting to look better.

As others have said, I already assume you are in touch with your surgeon/medical team.

Yeah, I already sent the photo to my surgeon so I know what&#39;s that. But what I&#39;m seeing now that I showered myself is that some of the necrosis is starting to cole out little by little.

From what I‚Äôve been able to gather she is a part of the public medical system in Spain. She is in touch with her doctor and this is how he operates.

Well he has more than 300 SRS done so I think he knows something about it. And he is on the top 10 of surgeons of Spain.

That sounds ludicrous to me. If that‚Äôs the technique in Spain than something needs to change.
</p>
<p>
Believe half of everything you hear hon. How can he do 300 surgeries? How long has been operating for? How many surgeries does he do a week?
</p>
<p>
Also top 10? How many srs surgeons are there in all of Spain?

He has more than 20 years of experience. And I&#39;m in contact with other trans girl who was operated by him the same day. And she didn&#39;t have any complications and her pussy is perfect. So I think I can believe in his words. And here in my city I have another surgeon which I have a revision on Monday.

Most surgeons take over 5hrs for grs. How does he do two in one day? That‚Äôs very hard to believe.
</p>
<p>
McGinn says she does it in 3.5 hrs but that‚Äôs McGinn. This whole thing sounds strange.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I see only about a dozen doctors on this list and not all conduct vaginoplasty. So of course he‚Äôs top 10.

He does penile inversion in 3.5 hours. And I have a lot of skin so he didn&#39;t need to take more from other sides.

please chill out. at 22 days this isn&#39;t helpful. it could be an option later down the line if necessary, but her health is the priority now. NO surgeon can guarantee that there will be no complications. none. please realize that rather than being needlessly incendiary.

Those are slough tissues and not pus or a sign of infection. Although slough tissues are nonviable tissues for healing, they are pretty normal to form during healing process. Just keep it clean to prevent infection.

The necrosis looks smaller and the skin around it is a healthy pink and doesn&#39;t look inflamed. These are all good signs.

And today looking at the necrosis I can see a little bit underneath it so I think it&#39;s peeling off. This morning I received a message from my surgeon and he says that the healing is following the road. And that I just have to keep it clean.
