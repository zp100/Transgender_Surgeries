I had an orchi about 10 years ago.
</p>
<p>
It is certainly not perfect - but it is much better.  I am on a lot less spiro - I keep some of it for blood pressure - but that is me.  I got a boost in boob growth immediately after the orchi.  There is a huge difference between blocking T and just not having it to block.
</p>
<p>
There is some pretty significant shrinkage in both penis and scrotum... as long as I wear a dark color and preferably a pattern I can get away with swimming.  Pre Covid I went to the YMCA a few times a week.  We are talking prepubescent levels of shrinkage.  Which is great.
</p>
<p>
People whine a lot about having enough material left for surgery - if you are planning zero depth - there is plenty of material.  That is actually my plan - but I live in the US and have to save for surgery...
</p>
<p>
I would definitely do it again if I had to make the decision over.

Did you have breast growth before the orchi? Were you on hrt for some time, then had the orchi?

There was some before, but it was more significant after.  I was on HRT for 3(?) years before the orchi.

The benefits include not having to take any anti-androgens and you might be able to use a lower dose of estrogen. Tucking may (or may not) still be necessary, but it won&#39;t be any harder (no pun intended).
</p>
<p>
You don&#39;t need prostheses (especially if you&#39;re looking at zero depth).

I&#39;d like to chime in.
</p>
<p>
I had mine 5 years ago, in 2015.
</p>
<p>
The most obvious pro is not having to take any anti androgens anymore. Yes, there is some shrinkage, but last time I had a checkup, I could get srs anytime I wanted, still.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s easier to tuck. I could wear anything I want and nothing would pop out or look strange.
</p>
<p>
And given how much I paid for it back then ($800 USD), I feel very satisfied with the outcome.
</p>
<p>
So, yeah. All good.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: My surgeon was Dr. Melissa Belmonte. She&#39;s an urologist, I think she&#39;s doing SRS now.

Your benefits are losing testosterone production and having less bulk to deal with when tucking.
</p>
<p>
Your concern would be having a surgery, although I hear it&#39;s an easy recovery.  But more of an issue would be loss of scrotal tissue from atrophy.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re zero depth, that might not be an issue, talk to your surgeon.ibe heard of testicular prosthetics, and I am inclined to believe manual stretching could also help the same way dilation does post srs

I had on orchy last week. Whether or not it makes a difference to SRS, you&#39;d have to check with your surgeon. For me, it means I don&#39;t have to worry about AAs any more &amp; once swelling / bruising has gone down, it should make tucking what&#39;s left a lot easier. ðŸ™‚

Iâ€™m curious about the orchi, myself: how does it affect libido? Are erections still possible? TMI, Iâ€™m married to a cis woman, and penetrative sex is important to her in our sex life.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Iâ€™ve been on HRT (spiro, progesterone, and estradiol) for a little over nine months now.

I had mine this past Friday so I&#39;m still sore but glad I did it. Swelling isn&#39;t to bad yet but I woke up with morning wood this morning which is really surprising. I hope to have srs in the next two years and from what I&#39;ve heard I&#39;ll be mostly ok in regards to atrophy within that time. Manual stretching of the scrotum might also be possible but I haven&#39;t seen any concrete evidence just stuff I heard.

I found it is stage one, of vaginoplasty anyway, and they typically do it in 2 stages.

You ditch T blockers. Thats about it. I would keep it for surgery if you can a coochie eventually.
