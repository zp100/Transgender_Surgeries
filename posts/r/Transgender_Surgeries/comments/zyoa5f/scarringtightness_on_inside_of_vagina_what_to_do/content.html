While dilating recently I felt I wasnâ€™t getting as much depth as usual. I fingered around down there during this morningâ€™s dilation and felt a tough bit of skin towards the end of the vagina - and a bit more depth behind that! It was too small to be pryed open by the soul source dilators, but I was able to hold it open with my fingers.
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s been 14 or 15 weeks since I had SRS with Ashley Deleon. Lack of depth has been the main issue, even though I love my aesthetics, sensation is fine, I can orgasm, and the office has been really helpful with any issues that arise.
</p>
<p>
So this internal vaginal scarring was listed as a potential complication from SRS, and one I know some trans girls have reported from their own surgeries. I contacted the Crane Centerâ€™s nurse line and they said theyâ€™d write up a referral to a pelvic floor therapist Dr Deleon recommends. They also said if that doesnâ€™t work out, they can work on this in the operating room. (Iâ€™m pretty close to the Crane Center so travel expenses arenâ€™t an issue.)
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m going to continue dilating and do it more frequently, Iâ€™m going to get in with a pelvic floor therapist who is familiar with this issue. But Iâ€™d like to know whatâ€™s worried or not from the women whoâ€™ve experienced this issue. Did some research earlier today and found at least one woman recommend a topical testosterone gel to help with soreness and tightness within the canal. Also heard T gel can help with achieving orgasms. I know at least one woman used vitamin E oil to reduce her external scars - I wonder if it could help with the internal scarring.
</p>
<p>
Let me know what can work girlies! This is worrying me.

Update: after dilating again I donâ€™t think this is actual scar tissue inside. Rather, I think itâ€™s part of the pelvic muscles that I might have missed in recent dilations and is wanting to close up faster than the part behind it. Was able to dilate it with my fingers, enough to get the dilator back there.
</p>
<p>
Still going to go to pelvic floor therapy though.

If you still think it&#39;s scar tissue and close to the entrance and easily reachable, definitely check out steroid injections to the scars to loosen up the tissue. Very common practice for tight/raised scars.
</p>
<p>
Also look into getting a Perifit device. It&#39;s a pelvic floor therapy device that you stick inside you (looks like a little dildo toy) and it connects to your phone via Bluetooth and you contract and relax your muscles to play videogames within the Perifit app. Super fucking addicting and fun lol.

first time I heard of the perifit! Does it vibrate to give you tactile response in what you&#39;re doing? :D I am familiar with dildos or other sex toys that are bluetooth capable with different kinds of features.
