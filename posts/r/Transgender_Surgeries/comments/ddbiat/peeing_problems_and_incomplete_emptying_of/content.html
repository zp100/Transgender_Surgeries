I haven&#39;t been able to empty my bladder completely ever since I&#39;ve had bottom surgery. Has anyone else post op experiencing this? And if so, was there some sort of treatment  you underwent?  And by the way my prostate has been small since being on HRT and its not causing the obstruction. My urethra just feels like its tight and obstructed. Does anyone know exactly what the doctor does to the urethra tube besides shortening it and repositioning it? Does the doctor dissect the urethra tube and create a flap out of it for the new opening?

Do you think its catheter related? Is your issue currently, catheter related? Does it feel obstructed and do you have a difficult time starting to urinate even though you have to go?

I haven&#39;t heard of that before, is that something which goes away on its own?

I&#39;m still struggling. My urethra feels tight and I can&#39;t seem to empty my bladder completely. At times I have to self intermittent catheter myself just to &#34;air it out&#34; and then I feel I can go.

A year and a half ago. But I&#39;ve also had some corrective surgeries along the way.

I have kinda thr opposite. I had stage 1 of SRS about 11 months ago (they do a 2 stage PI in one place in Sweden). Anyway.
</p>
<p>
I lost feeling in my bladder for about 3 to 4 months, so I didn&#39;t really know when I was empty. Then around 4 months ago I did the 2nd stage, they shortened the uretha by around 25mm, so again, I had a catheter, now the wee comes out as so hig pressure that it kinda sprays everywhere.
</p>
<p>
What you are describing may be scar tissue at some point in the urethra, most likely the &#34;outside end&#34;, it does not take a lot to mess up going to the toilet. It could also be, as others say, something the catheter did whilat inside.
</p>
<p>
Defo something to check out with (ideally) the surgeon/ team that did your SRS.

Thank you for sharing your experience with me. Peeing has been a completely different experience after the surgery. I have been going to see a urologist that specializes in urinary complications after SRS in my city. And I have gotten a revision as you mentioned at the opening of my urethra because it was narrowing. But once that got fixed I still had problem with not emptying my bladder. I have done several exams from cystoscopy to video urodynamics and my urologist said that some of the possible reasons are as follows:
</p>
<p>
1) impaired bladder muscle contractility
</p>
<p>
2) dysfunctional voiding
</p>
<p>
3) possible obstruction from a urethral stricture
</p>
<p>
I think it may be related to neurological or even due to long wear of  using the catheter. I hated wearing the catheter. It was so uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
My original surgeon has done all that he can and he thinks is due to swelling and he&#39;s just prescribe me flomax to help with the flow.
</p>
<p>
How are you peeing? Are you peeing ok and emptying your bladder completely?

That sounds awful, sorry.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t really have any issues apart from leaking a little, and almost having too much flow. No problems with emptying (I am too good at emptying haha).

You are so lucky. My urethra is so tight that I don&#39;t even leak a little at all. I&#39;d do anything to be able to pee normally and empty my bladder. Unfortunately that is not the case. I do regret my surgery because of my complication. And it really has effected my quality of life. Thank you again for sharing your surgical experience with me.

Yeah, I don&#39;t take my luck for granted. Stage 1 was an easy recovery, stage 2 was hell for 10 days. And fairly minor complications.
</p>
<p>
I know someone else who did the same operation as me, some montha after, functionality is a lot better than mine but has so much pain still.
</p>
<p>
Some surgeries just seem to go better than others. Sorry yours didn&#39;t go as you had hoped.

Major surgeries like this - chances that will go right and not right are 50/50. Something that can&#39;t be control. But, thank you for listening and getting back to me.

It&#39;s a pretty common problem with GRS.
</p>
<p>
it can also be caused by nerve damage during surgery,  or medications.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m female,  and some medications give me what is called bladder hesitation.  As in,  hard to pee. To get started peeing.
</p>
<p>
And incomplete emptying.
</p>
<p>
You could try a diet low in inflammatory foods.  Add foods that reduce inflammation.  Paleo Diet would be a good start.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry this is happening to you,  we need to pee so many times a day,  and trouble in this area makes life a misery. People should be warned heaps about this one GRS.
</p>
<p>
Unless you have a cat.  My cat sees dunny time as her personal patting time.

Thank you for your response. I do believe it could be nerve damage from the surgery. I do have a hard time starting to urinate and have a longer than usual wait for the stream of urine to begin. And when I do urinate I feel that I don&#39;t completely empty my bladder. We take things for granted in life. Until something as simple as peeing goes wrong. And truthfully, I do regret getting this surgery because of my current complication. It really does effect my quality of life. Thank you for the diet tip to help reduce inflammation and I do appreciate you listening to my problem.
