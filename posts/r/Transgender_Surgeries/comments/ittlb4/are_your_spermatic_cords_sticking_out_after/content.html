Hiya. I&#39;ve been watching the
<a href="https://youtu.be/dYokNSAnbOY">procedure video for simple orchiectomy</a>
(skip to 13:51), which shows a fair amount of organ remaining after surgery; the severed spermatic cords are seen dangling in the scrotum and they look pretty bulky. Can you feel these? Externally, by fingering the area, or just by looking, can you notice them? And do they contribute to the region &#39;sticking out&#39; in its mound shape?â€”Would radical orchiectomy be superior to simple in this sense, is what I&#39;m getting at, if they are noticeable?
</p>
<p>
Context: I want orchi first and foremost because I hate the physical sticking-out feeling of everything ball-related down there, and I want to
<strong>
flatten
</strong>
the scrotal mound as much as reasonable for physical comfort and visual aesthetics (and also to simplify hrt but that&#39;s secondary to the flattening). With insurance in mind, the only thing likely to be covered is simple orchiectomyâ€”probably not radical orchiectomy, nor any further aestheticizing (e.g. a scrotum trim, not that I&#39;d want that). Also though, I&#39;d like to save as much &#39;material&#39; as possible in the unlikely event I want a vagina someday. I&#39;d be okay with the extra skin of the scrotum folding in on itself, fwiw; I just want to get rid of the feelable protruding aspect of the mound. So for these reasons I want to &#39;make do&#39; with simple orchiâ€¦but that procedure video with the dangling cords finishes with a very-much-still-visible mound
<strong>
(skip to 19:28)
</strong>
which has me worrying it won&#39;t meet my expectations, and wondering if radical orchi would have some advantage in this regard.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it seems the bulk of the &#39;mound&#39; there firstly may be due to swelling that dies down, but furthermore may be something else other than either the testes or their cords. From what I can feel, it seems like a lot of the area is just a &#39;continuation&#39; of my penis (?), extending below the scrotum and fading out mid-&#39;taint. Is this so? And in this case, would this part of my penis atrophy over time as well as the external part? Or is there other relevant tissue as well that I&#39;m not mentiontioning that contributes to this &#39;mound&#39;?
</p>
<h3>
Let me enumerate my questions for ease of answeringâ€¦
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Does the spermatic cords&#39; remaining length contribute to the final flatness achievable by orchi? (And/or, can you feel these dangling post-op?)
</li>
<li>
To what extent does atrophy (/retraction, necrosis, etc) affect the remaining cords? Do they retract completely into the inguinal canals after some time, making question 1 irrelevant? Or do they stay dangling but perhaps atrophy enough to partially or fully resolve this issue? Or do they not atrophy or retract at all?
</li>
<li>
Are other tissues in the scrotal mound more important to flatness than the testes or cords? Perhaps some kind of scrotal stromla/lining, or the penis continuation I mentioned?
</li>
<li>
If pics would help answer each point, do you have an album? Or is there a website, forum etc with post-op pics of each (and links to procedure videos if relevant)?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I&#39;ve asked in detail expecting a detailed response; thanks.

A completely &#34;flat&#34; presentation won&#39;t be present, but it has nothing to do with the spermatic cords and a &#34;radical&#34; orchi won&#39;t make any difference.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a year and a half postop. The tender nodules
<em>
eventually
</em>
healed (I had &#34;complications&#34;) and cannot be felt now. What
<em>
I
</em>
am left with is a lot of loose skin and large &#34;fat pad&#34; that completely hides the head of my penis, but your mileage
<em>
will
</em>
vary.
</p>
<p>
Unless you remove
<strong>
all
</strong>
the scrotum (a scrotectomy, which you
<strong>
do not
</strong>
want to do if you plan on GRS), you will always have
<em>
some
</em>
protrusion &#34;down there&#34;.

Does scrotal tissue become erogenous on HRT? Or is it just used in SRS as &#34;normal&#34; skin?

I had a successful simple orchi. Quick healing, low pain, and the scar was basically invisible after a few months. I couldn&#39;t really feel anything &#39;dangling&#39;. I couldn&#39;t feel much of anything inside. I don&#39;t know how much of the cords were left behind, but I certainly couldn&#39;t feel them inside the scrotum anymore.
</p>
<p>
True, the tissue wasn&#39;t completely flat, but it wasn&#39;t as dangling as before, either. The scrotal tissue is quite flexible, so I could stretch it if needed, but most of the time it was neat and compact. Definitely increased ease of tucking.
</p>
<p>
I stretched the scrotum daily, on my doctor&#39;s orders, to prepare for SRS. When I stretched the tissue, it felt like just skin and nothing else. I could essentially flatten out the skin completely, without detecting any contents inside. I hope that answers your question about &#39;dangling cords&#39;.
</p>

</p>
<p>
After 1.5y, I had SRS with no need for skin grafts. So either atrophy didn&#39;t really take effect, or my stretching prevented it.

I don&#39;t have personal experience but From the post orchis I&#39;ve seen the cords retract completely into the abdomen. The scrotum usually pulls pretty close once the swelling goes down.
