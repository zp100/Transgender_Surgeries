Your new bottom looks great.  When healed I suspect it will look very cis female.  Hope mine looks that good a month out.  Do you have feeling in the labia, the clitoris, or vaginal canal yet?  Not sure if its all numb after surgery or just part or varies person to person.  Your surgeon did well and you are taking care of yourself well.  Hugs.
