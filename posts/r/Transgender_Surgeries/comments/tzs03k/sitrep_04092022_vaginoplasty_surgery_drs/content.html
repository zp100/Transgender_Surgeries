Thank you for following my story. If interested,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/u2731r/sitrep_04122022_vaginoplasty_surgery_drs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf"><strong>

</a>
is the link to my next post, as the adventures at NYU continues . . .
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 2:
</strong>
of my Care Plan. I owe catch up of my journey here at NYU Langone Hospital. Started writing a post on my mobile app, lotsa details and lost it when I accidentally moved to another Reddit page.
</p>
<p>
My comfort level meter is pegged at “10”. Will edit this comment today, so if interested in following my experiences, pls standby .
</p>
<p>
(Edit)
<strong>
Day 0:
</strong>
Received the call the afternoon before and was told I’m first on the day’s surgery schedule. Reporting time 0600 hrs. Being late carries the risk of canceling the surgery. Surgery is scheduled for 0730 hrs. (Edit) Being first on the surgery list was extremely important to me. Although I’m willingly placing myself in the hands of the best surgery team
<strong>
<em>
ever
</em>
</strong>
, the team is their freshest and my odds of a successful outcome is just that little bit better.
</p>
<p>
We left our Vrbo early due to experiences earlier this week driving from Jersey to Kimmel for pre-op COVID test, and pre-op appointment with Nurse Navigator, Katie. The traffic can be a living Hell. My wife and daughter are with me as my caregivers. They do the driving and navigating. I sit in the back, texting to important people who played major roles in helping me get to this day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Arrival/Parking:
</strong>
Arrived 0530 hrs. We pull into the hospital valet parking. In our planning for this day and the days following, I was very worried about my wife and daughter trying to find parking, then walking through a parking area in the dark to get back to the car. The valet parking is expensive, however, I had contacted the hospital parking services beforehand and already knew what we were in for. Both the hospital and the physical therapy buildings offer this service. Knowing the costs in advance, we planned for it in the budget.
</p>
<p>
The valet greets us, asks if we are there for surgery. Yes, we are. (Apparently, this makes a difference in where they park the car). He takes a photo of the license plate, then hands us a ticket/receipt bearing the time we arrived and the vehicle tag number. The ticket is required as part of the payment process when leaving. At one of the two payment machines located in the lobby, opposite of the services desk the ticket gets scanned, you make the payment, and this notifies the valet and the on-duty attendant  brings the car.
</p>
<p>
We enter the lobby and stop at the visitor information station. They ask our reasons for entry, ask COVID questions and issues a colored sticker to place on outer clothing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Check in:
</strong>
Kimmel elevators are on the blue pathway, practically right around the corner from the services desk. The elevator takes us to the 5th floor.  Door opens and to our left is the large surgery lobby/waiting area. As we approach, we are directed to begin our check in at the two kiosks against the wall to our left.
</p>
<p>
There is a palm scanner connected to the kiosk and it doesn’t recognize my palm. Try again, same result. I use the alternate method, and check in. Next, I go to the staff desk and a friendly staff member verifies our information, goes over our insurances, has me electronically sign. We owe no copay! Yay!!! She puts a hospital band around my left wrist. It contains: My name
</p>
<p>
DOB (Age)
</p>
<p>
Patient numbers
</p>
<p>
Barcode and QR code
</p>
<p>
Continued:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pre-op:
</strong>
Took a seat and several minutes later my name was called and I joined a group of people whom were have their surgeries early. The staff person led us through a door into the pre-op area. The layout was a long tiled open hallway (sic) with “cubicles” of sorts on either side. Each one had a sign on the ceiling, just outside the area. The staff member led us down the floor calling out names and pointing out the area to which each person was assigned. I was led to 5-10 and was told to wait, I would be attended to, shortly.
</p>
<p>
After several minutes, a staff member (she) comes to me and instructs me to remove all my clothes. There is a purple zippered carry bag with the NYU logo on it. Attached to one of the handles is a plastic tag
<strong>
<em>
(correction)
</em>
</strong>
with a sticker containing my personal information. She opens the bag, pulls out a large clear plastic bag, explains it is for my shoes. Then comes these bright yellow socks with impregnated and rubber, making them non slip. Next up is a light purple, paper-type gown. Last up is a blue paper hair cover. She tells me to take everything off, including any piercings and jewelry (I don’t have any). She points to my watch says “Take off the watch.” I tell her I’ll give it to my wife as soon as she’s allowed to join me. She then tells me to put on the gown and put all my belongings in the bag. After that, she explains that the bag will go into a locker and will be delivered to my room, following surgery. She then draws the large privacy curtain closed and leaves.
</p>
<p>
I do as instructed. I had anticipated this part and opted not to wear any underwear or bra, because why? I was just going to take them off when I got here so why add extra layers to the process . . .
</p>
<p>
I don the gown as sort of a wrap (I’ll figure out the complicated looking ties, after) and put on the sox. The markings say XL and they are a snug fit, (I’m size w11). Then, I’m try to figure out the ties for the gown. I’m struggling with it when a Patient Tech steps past the curtain. She sees my dilemma. I ask if she would help me please, (a bit of emphasis on the “please”). She smiles slightly and tells me to turn around. I do and she pulls the straps through some various openings and closes the gown. It’s definitely not form fitting, but it isn’t as bulky as before. I’m grateful and thank her.
</p>
<p>
She hands me a cellophane wrapped toothbrush and a small tube of toothpaste. She then leads me to a bathroom. Locked. An unintelligible male voice is heard inside. She tells me “Let’s check out another one.”, and leads me further down the floor. Nobody in these cubicles, yet. She turns right, grabs the handle and the restroom opens. She tells me to come back to my spot as soon as I’m finished. I walk in, lock the door and take a moment to just breath . . . set down the dentil accouterments, break out my phone and take a picture in the mirror mounted over the sink. After all, I’m sporting the latest in hospital couture, so I captured the moment! Teeth clean, I toss the brush and the small tube of toothpaste and head back to 5-10.
</p>
<p>
The Tech asks me a series of questions:
</p>
<p>
Verify identity.
</p>
<p>
Verify address.
</p>
<p>
When did you last eat?
</p>
<p>
When did you last drink?
</p>
<p>
Do you smoke?
</p>
<p>
When did you quit smoking?
</p>
<p>
Drugs?
</p>
<p>
Alcohol consumption?
</p>
<p>
Do you have anything in your body?
</p>
<p>
Review of past surgeries.
</p>
<p>
Review of current prescriptions.
</p>
<p>
Review of current vitamin supplements.
</p>
<p>
Any cuts or bruises?
</p>
<p>
Etc.
</p>
<p>
Questions answered, she asks the names of my caregivers and leaves to call and lead them back to my assigned cubicle.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for following my journey❣️ To be continued . . .

This was so cool to see. Normally all the posts are just pictures of various stages of healing. Which is important to know, but it&#39;s nice to see the actual facility. I can&#39;t believe they have Netflix! Boo! Lol.
</p>
<p>
I live and work in NYC, but it will be cool to have that view!
</p>
<p>
Thanks for sharing. Happy healing!

Thank you❣️ My intent is to share as much of the details most don’t say anything about, bc these things are part of the experience. I am a “vigilant patient”, one how wants the details.
<strong>
<em>
All the details!!!
</em>
</strong>
I’m also an open book, AMA. My goal is to provide information for any woman following this same path, so she doesn’t have to wonder what’s ahead with this team.

I&#39;ve heard! I had no idea how nice their rooms were though, oh my goodness. I don&#39;t mind the long wait, I need to save money and start hair removal (I need to find a clinic in my state willing to help me file reimbursement claims).

Thank you❣️ Hadn’t thought of it that way, this is very kind of you. In retrospect, perhaps this was meant to be. This time I/we were far better prepared as opposed to the original Jan 2021 surgery date.
</p>
<p>
You just added a very nice bright spot to my day❣️❤️🥰🦋🤗s

Thank you for these photos. I will have this as a reminder on how long to put it in for when I have my vaginoplasty when the time comes. I had my vulvoplasty in October 2019 and Only did this due to the time restriction given to me by my work place. Going for the full vaginoplasty would not have worked due to having to return early had I have done this option. Also noting and not really realizing we would have a Covid Pandemic just three months after I flew back to Hawai’i from Portland, Oregon I would of had my intended vaginoplasty. My nurses at my transgender care department in whom I go to for my hormones and takes care of my surgery process and support urged me to go with the vulvoplasty instead. So I did what they suggested, ultimately I wanted the vaginoplasty. Time restraint on staying in Portland, OR and flying back was a problem, but turned out not so much of a problem afterwards.
</p>
<p>
So now I’m going for my vaginoplasty whenever they decide when can they get me scheduled to go under again to get it.
