The white tissue is fibrin tissue.  It’s not dead.  It’s definitely going through it though.  You do have a little wound separation but it’s not too bad.
</p>
<p>
Does your surgical team have you on a wound care protocol? Cuz this could definitely use a plan to help heal quicker.

Are you sure ? It’s very soft and slimy
</p>
<p>
I’m just in my normal wound care clean twice a day and some creams
</p>
<p>
I have messaged the clinic just waiting for them to talk to the dr and get back to me
</p>
<p>
Thank you for you reply I really appreciate it

Yeah it sounds to me like the tissue has degraded but is not dead (it happens) and will continue to degrade til it hits a point of homeostasis and then start healing. Meanwhile it is still healing from the inside out.   I don’t see signs of necrosis from the pics though.
</p>
<p>
I’m a lower surgery caregiver (and post phallo trans guy myself) and when I see wounds like this I try to keep the area dry with gauze. I tuck a piece of 4x4 gauze into the area and change it out every couple hours. This wicks out the moisture and helps fast track healing.   You can continue with the cleaning and creams too. Just adding this gauze wound care can really help to dry the area out.

Hey good luck and I hope you get some feedback from your surgeon soon.
</p>
<p>
Numbness is totally normal this early on and hopefully things resolve well for you.
</p>
<p>
ETA:  the red part looks like hypergranulation tissue and may not heal without attention from a doctor. They usually put silver nitrate on it and that tends to calm it down.
</p>
<p>
Thinking bout you xo

I do agree with that this is the process of healing from inside to out. I’m like 10 weeks post op rff phalloplasty. I was so scared when this was going on too. But my PA &amp; surgeon assured me that this the stages of healing. And I did go thru 3 wound separations. They too instructed me to always keep it clean and dry. And trust me I was sooo scared and even thinking it wasn’t gonna heal. But as time went on and I saw it getting better I did realize ok it’s finally doing what it’s meant to do. In which was to close. But all of that ugly stuff had to come out. The PA said better out then in. So last week (9week) I was completely healed🙌🏽 Also, remember eating good (protein more) and taking vitamins and drinks water is a huge process of healing faster too….. Hang in there and just realize again it’s the process of healing. That yellow tissue is a good sign!! And your body will let u know if it’s an infection. Bc u will start to spike a temp and so on….. Speedy recovery to you. And welcome to becoming your authentic self 😁😁🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽

Okay great news! Glad you were able to hear directly from him that everything is okay. Congrats.
</p>
<p>
Burning could just be the open wounds you have feeling sensitive- that’s often normal.   Just keep an eye on it for the next few days and see if you can figure out where it’s coming from.
</p>
<p>
And re medical honey- I’ve used it with people (and myself) before and while it’s not harmful it only sometimes works for people.
</p>
<p>
What creams are you using right now?

Okay right on so you are already using an antibiotic cream- that would help with any potential infection.
</p>
<p>
You can try the honey on the granulation and see if it helps.  I always suggest giving it 1-2 days, see how it’s doing and if it looks worse- stop. If it looks the same or better- keep going!
</p>
<p>
And make sure to rinse well gently but daily cuz that honey can create a mess quickly.

This person is incorrect. The white tissue is normal. Mine did the exact same and my surgeon informed me it falls off at around 3 months. Mine did and it revealed my beautiful, soft, pink clit who is fully orgasmic btw. You have slight granulation elsewhere and for the weeks, it looks totally fine. Take a deep breath, do what you do. If you had some crazy infection, your body would let you know

The ER won&#39;t know anything and will be very very hesitant to intervene with another doctor&#39;s work.  Your surgeon&#39;s office NEEDS to follow up with you.  If the doc is out of office you need someone who is in the office to advise you of what to do and who to see for this.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t get anywhere with that, then resort to the ER... but again, it&#39;s not ideal.  This is a very niche surgery, so the ER staff will be confused but maybe they can do a culture and add in antibiotics.  It&#39;s just hard for them to know what is appropriate, especially if they can&#39;t access your records through your surgeon...
</p>
<p>
I know someone said it&#39;s just fibrin, but it&#39;s impossible to tell from the pics.  They aren&#39;t focused enough to know for sure, which is not entirely your fault since it&#39;s very challenging to get those pictures.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d give the office another call and insist they advise you what to do.  Ask if there&#39;s an associate surgeon or fellow that can at least take a look (in person).  It may not be as big a deal as you think, but it certainly needs addressed.

It does look like you have granulation.
