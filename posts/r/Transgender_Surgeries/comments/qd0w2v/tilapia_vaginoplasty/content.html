Hey loves,
</p>
<p>
I just had a consult with a doctor in Colombia for FFS. His name is Dr. Alvaro Rodriguez. I also saw that he does Vaginoplasty with the tilapia skin. I have asked how many patients he has done this procedure on and he told me about 70 so far. He also stated how it becomes mucosal which takes about 6 months. I didn&#39;t really have a ton of questions for this since I initially went in for a FFS consult. I just thought I would post this here since he&#39;s the only doctor I&#39;ve heard so far offer this to trans women as an option. Also, anyone on here have FFS with him? I&#39;d appreciate any feedback. Thanks!
</p>

Thank you for this article. I wasn’t aware they started using this for us already. I just wanted to post this in case someone was interested. He’s the only doctor I’ve come across while trying to search up srs surgeons that does this technique. Also, if there are any other surgeons utilizing this I’d appreciate it if you could let me know. Thank you! :)

Tilapia skin is used for burn victims in South America a lot so it&#39;s not all that weird

Hi,
</p>
<p>
My post isn’t about it being weird, or anything of that kind at all. I just thought I would post this as a resource so anyone looking to go this route has a doctor they can contact :)
