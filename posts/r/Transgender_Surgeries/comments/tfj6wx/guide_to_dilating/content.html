Dilating after having surgery is a big topic. How many times a day, how long, how to increase width, lubricant, finding the motivation to dilate, and so much more. While initial recovery from surgery usually happens by 6-8 weeks, there is extensive dilating for the entire first year as well as the rest of your life.
</p>
<h1>
Disclaimer
</h1>
<p>
I am not a doctor. If you have questions or are thinking of doing something different than what your surgeon says you should ask them. This is simply what I have been able to learn from research, my own experience, and talking with others. There are a lot of unanswered questions around short and long term care.
</p>
<h1>
Why do you have to dilate?
</h1>
<p>
Helping the tissue heal the way you want and preventing scar contraction is the primary reason. Beyond this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dilating continuously during initial healing makes sure the fresh scars inside the vagina don&#39;t heal to each other. This is the same reason why you are asked to use your finger to make sure everything stays separated, especially around your clitoris.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Dilation adjusts the pelvic floor muscle for having the vagina go through it.
<br>
</li>
<li>
The vagina is often created around a dilator similar to the soul source size #1 or #2. To be wide enough for sex you want to stretch the width, and maintain the length as needed.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Scar tissue is harder to stretch than other tissue so stretching it before it matures is easier. A common issue is the scar “ring&#34; around the entrance to the vagina becoming too tight.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
What you might expect the first year (barring complications)
</h1>
<h2>
0-1.5 months
</h2>
<p>
Initial recovery, dilation is your life, and you start sizing up.
</p>
<h2>
1.5-3 months
</h2>
<p>
Make sure you have a schedule down so around the 2-3 months point and you want your life back you will skip as few sessions as possible.
</p>
<h2>
3 months
</h2>
<p>
You gain sensation inside your vagina and can feel for the first time the stretching you have to do to undo the scar contracture. This makes dilating a lot more uncomfortable. Only worry about staying on schedule and maintaining your depth during this time! Afterwards, enjoy how everything feels.
</p>
<h2>
4-6 months
</h2>
<p>
Everything is healing, scars start to lose their bright red color, and dilating starts becoming easier. Missing a session isn&#39;t a huge deal, but missing a day can be. Massaging the ring scar tissue now and then to soften and flatten it.
</p>
<p>
You might be done sizing up. At some point going down to using only 1 or 2 dilators each session (For example starting on purple and then orange). Make sure you don&#39;t become complacent at getting to full depth as dilating is now routine and when not sizing up you are not &#34;working at it&#34; every session.
</p>
<h2>
6-9 months
</h2>
<p>
Dealing with any lasting granulation, having your 6-month follow-up appointment, and scheduling any revisions if needed.
</p>
<p>
The internal scars are still maturing and contracting even if it is at a much slower pace. Listening to your body moving down to 2 or even 1 session a day might be sooner or later. At 1 session a day you must make that session count and get to full depth or you will start to lose depth 1mm at a time.
</p>
<h2>
9-12+ months
</h2>
<p>
Slowly moving from daily to every few days, and finally once a week or less. By now you know how to read your body and also have a full understanding of what you need to do to make each of these infrequent sessions count to maintain your depth and width.
</p>
<h1>
Dilators
</h1>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.soulsource.com/collections/grs-vaginal-dilators">Soul Source GRS Vaginal Dilators
</a>
are one of the most common sets of dilators. They are polyurethane plastic and rigid. Usually, you start with the purple #1 and work your way up to the orange #4. Each one is 1/8&#34; wider. This is “the big orange dilator&#34; that is often mentioned in discussions. The thinner #P1 and #P2 dilators are not infrequently used to make sure you can maintain depth during the initial time after surgery before moving on to #1.
</p>
<h2>
Dilating beyond orange
</h2>
<p>
The set of Soul Source dilators are all that most ever need/use, but if you want to get something else or something wider there are lots of options. Here are some of the best ones I have found.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.soulsource.com/collections/silicone-vaginal-dilators/products/soul-source-silicone-vaginal-dilators-size-8">Soul Source Silicone #8 6&#34; length, 1-5/8 width (aka squishy blue)
</a>
This dilator is 1/8 wider at the base than orange. Because it has some flexibility one can sit up with it in and can even walk around sort of. Even if this is slightly tapered, it is wider where it matters most at the scar tissue at the entrance. A great safe option for getting something slightly bigger than orange. Also great if your partner is about the size of orange and you want a little more width so sex is more comfortable. If you have been dilating with orange for a long time this one can be underwhelming as you will probably be able to stretch to it very quickly.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bad-dragon.com/products/mystic">Bad Dragon&#39;s Mystic. Medium tapers from 1.7-2.1&#34;, Large tapers from 2-2.7&#34;
</a>
Shaped like a &#34;unicorn horn&#34; this sex toy is continuously wider, unlike most sex toys or dilators. With it alone, you can continuously work on increasing width without having to buy something new each week. It has some flex so it is not at all a good item for long term maintaining depth or width, only for sizing up. Make sure to order it in the firmest firmness. Going straight from orange to Mystic in the medium size can be more difficult than going between the other dilators, but doable.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://lusciousplaythings.com/products/xl-extra-large-7-glass-vaginal-or-anal-dilator-trainer-medical-sex-toy-kegel-dildo">Luscious Playthings #7 Glass dilator 7&#34; length, 1.75&#34; width
</a>
This company has various sizes all the way up to 1/4&#34; larger than orange.  This company&#39;s glass dilator was the best one I purchased. The tip was more tapered for insertion than others and when using a polarized lens I didn&#39;t see any internal stress marks showing a high quality glass product. It was also longer than the others I purchased and at 7&#34; length it can even replace orange for maintaining depth for those that have more depth. And the price wasn&#39;t too bad.
</p>
<p>
Dilating with rigid dilators guarantees you are keeping the width/depth. Glass has the nice property of being smooth which can make it easier to insert. Also, because it is clear you can put a bubble of air in first and then use it to sort of see inside.
</p>
<p>
A side note: For the most part the scar &#34;ring&#34; is the main thing you carefully stretch as you size up, but at a certain point the length of the vulva (fourchette to hood) needs to be stretched if the vertical incision during surgery was only made so long. A standard 90mm incision translates into hitting this when you size up beyond ~2.4&#34;.
</p>
<h2>
Other dilators
</h2>
<p>
Inflatable sex toys that expand to the shape of the canal and apply much more even pressure in all directions can be very helpful when used in conjunction with the standard dilators.
</p>
<p>
The Intimate Rose
<a href="https://www.intimaterose.com/products/vibrating-pelvic-wand">vibrating Pelvic Wand
</a>
is a great tool for stretching out the pelvis floor and specifically the scar ring via trigger point therapy. The vibrating also explicitly helps to make both of these easier as well as to help break up the scar tissue.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.hellomilli.com/">Milli
</a>
can expand up to 40mm at small increments. Unfortunately, it is expensive and it only does this for the first 10.5cm (4.13&#34;) of depth. Fortunately, one of the hardest points to dilate is the scars connecting the vagina to the entrance which is where this dilator can help if you are having trouble there.
</p>
<p>
There are many more dilators out there. The
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_dilators">transgender surgeries wiki
</a>
has a more comprehensive list. Pay attention to the length of the dilators as many of them are much shorter than GRS dilators and might not useful for maintaining depth.
</p>
<h2>
Sex toys
</h2>
<p>
After you have healed up a bit, get yourself a fun toy or two. Many toys are not one width, but might be wider than orange at only their widest point. The material, not to mention the ridges on many toys can make these more fun than the dilators. These toys can sometimes make vaginal orgasming easier.
</p>
<p>
When buying toys you need to pay close attention to the dimensions. Length v.s. insertable length and width v.s. maximum width. Even if they are bigger than orange measurement wise they might squish a lot smaller.

<h1>
Traveling
</h1>
<p>
When traveling the first year you want to bring your dilators with you on the plane in case your luggage is lost. Adding an obvious dildo will allow your bag to get through security after it is flagged without them asking questions or searching.
</p>
<h1>
Lubricant
</h1>
<p>
Directly after surgery, you want to use a lubricant that is bacteriostatic such as Surgilube. Once the suture lines have healed then you should be clear to switch to a non-bacteriostatic lube. Your surgeon will make a recommendation, but around three months is common.
</p>
<h2>
How much?
</h2>
<p>
For initial purchasing of Surgilube, getting a box of 12 4.25oz tubes should last anywhere from 1.5-3 months. A 4.25oz tube can last a few days or several weeks.
</p>
<p>
You will use a lot more lubricant on each dilator at the start. After a few weeks, you will figure out what is the right amount for you. Switching to using packets instead of the tube can make it easier to apply the same amount every time.
</p>
<p>
After the first month, you will have a better idea of how much you use and can order the right amount for you at that point as well as considering other brands.
</p>
<p>
When calculating how much you used and how much you need going forward don&#39;t forget that you will reduce the number of times you dilate (and thus the amount of lubricant you need) across the first year.
</p>
<p>
When switching to another lubricant you might use a different amount.
</p>
<h2>
pH
</h2>
<p>
Once you stop bleeding the microbiome will likely stabilize with a pH between 3.5 and 4.5, below the 4.5 - 5.5 pH threshold that skin needs to grow hairs. Some surgeons recommend against douching because douching can destabilize the vaginal microbiome for this reason. When getting lubricant beyond the surgical lube pay attention and using lubricants with a good pH value should be the goal when possible.
</p>

Other lubricant’s

<h1>
Pelvic Floor Muscles
</h1>
<p>
When you dilate you are stretching out the pelvic floor muscles, but if you are not relaxed it will be much harder and can be painful. Learning to relax your pelvic floor muscles is an important part of dilating.
</p>
<p>
Set up your environment. Make a calm, relaxing space to dilate. You can use pillows to support your legs and your back to help make sure your muscles are not tense.
</p>
<p>
Relaxing your whole body, calm breathing, and trying to move the dilator in on exhales can all help. When in the shower you can use a finger to feel yourself squeezing and relaxing the muscles to help learn how to do that. There are articles on Reverse Kegels with more tips.
</p>
<p>
Some surgeons will recommend a pelvic physical therapist during recovery if you are having trouble in this area.

<h1>
Dilation schedules
</h1>
<p>
There are no formal studies or papers on this topic and schedules vary between doctors. Because of issues immediately after surgery, initial dilation schedules are often tailored to each individual. Below are several example schedules from different surgeons.

<h2>
Scar tissue
</h2>
<p>
All the surgeon schedules follow a rough pattern of 3x-4x a day the first month or two, followed by 3x a day up until around 6 months, then tapering down to 1x a day until finally around 1x a week after a year. This makes sense when comparing to and discussing how scars heal.
</p>
<p>
From the full breakdown of the
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470443/">wound healing process
</a>
scar strength and contracture are what matter the most to us. One paragraph in particular:
</p>
<p>
The maturational or remodeling phase starts around week 3 and can last up to 12 months. The excess collagen degrades, and wound contraction also begins to peak around week 3. Wound contraction occurs to a much greater extent in secondary healing than in primary healing. The maximal tensile strength of the incision wound occurs after about 11 to 14 weeks. The ultimate resulting scar will never have 100% of the original strength of the wound and only about 80% of the tensile strength.

<p>
In the first few weeks, the scar tissue is the weakest. Be extra careful to prevent tearing during this time. Most wound separation occurs after you leave the hospital around week 3. After the 3rd week is often the first time you start sizing up to larger size dilators. After the 6th week, you are often given permission to do more including exploring masturbation and sex.
</p>
<h2>
Scar contracture and stricture
</h2>
<p>
Scar contracture is when scar tissue tightens. Every day, all day, when they are healing scars are trying to tighten. It is rapid at first and then slows down until the scar fully matures. This is why we dilate so much at the start and can reduce the amount as time goes by.
</p>
<p>
Every time you dilate you are undoing that and stretching the scar back out again to prevent yourself from losing width and depth. Scar tissue can take anywhere from 6 months to 5 years to mature (2 years is common). Dilating at least the first two years, for this reason, seems prudent. Most scars are fairly mature by a year and as little as 6 months, but this depends on the individual and their age.
</p>
<p>
Some ramifications
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If dilating is painful from stretching, dilating more frequently means less stretching will occur each time and you will have less discomfort.
<br>
</li>
<li>
If you want/need to dilate less and are okay with more discomfort that is a trade you can make.
<br>
</li>
<li>
If you are thinking of avoiding dilating because it is really uncomfortable, increasing the number of sessions you have per day can reduce the discomfort and remove the reason for avoiding dilating.
<br>
</li>
<li>
When sizing up you are stretching out tissue. The more frequent, the less discomfort there is.
<br>
</li>
<li>
There is less discomfort once you finish sizing up because you are only re-stretching scar tissue.
<br>
</li>
<li>
If you are not maintaining your depth while dilating you will slowly lose depth, 1mm at a time.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is a bunch of scar tissue, but in particular, the ring of stitches around the opening to the vagina tightening is a common problem. While surgeons try to not make a ring, that is difficult. In the worst case, you have one continuous circular scar that contracts. Fortunately frequent dilating and thus stretching out this scar tissue helps. Massaging the ring scar tissue at 6+ months can help to soften, flatten, and reduce pain on it too.
</p>
<h2>
Feeling painful contracture
</h2>
<p>
You get a lot of feeling back around 12-15 weeks. This is often when contracture becomes very noticeable (read difficult/painful). This becomes less pronounced in time and for many, the worst is often over by 4 months. This can feel like it starts suddenly and tapers off over a few weeks. Don&#39;t worry about sizing up during this time. Make sure to maintain your dilation schedule and not give up depth. Continuing to dilate through the discomfort during this period is one of the most important things to do.
</p>
<p>
Sizing up earlier when it is easier can make a big difference. If you want to get to orange you ideally want to do it before contracture becomes noticeable, but at least dilating with the green #3 dilator comfortably. You can size up to orange later, it is overall easier to do early in recovery.
</p>
<h2>
Reducing the frequency
</h2>
<p>
As the scar matures there will be less discomfort when dilating. Testing, you can see if the benefits of reducing the frequency are worth the increase in discomfort.
</p>
<p>
If you switch from 3x a day to 2x a day you might find:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is the same discomfort level. Sticking with 2x might be good enough.
<br>
</li>
<li>
It is slightly more uncomfortable, but you can get to full depth/width without issue, your choice.
<br>
</li>
<li>
A lot more uncomfortable, maybe stick to 3x.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you reduce the frequency and after a few days it becomes a lot harder you might need to increase your frequency back to what it was and try again in a few weeks or maybe alternate days.
</p>
<p>
The schedule you receive from your surgeon is simply an informed guess of what might work well for you to help prevent you from losing depth based on previous patients.
</p>
<h2>
Missing a session/day the first year
</h2>
<p>
Eventually traveling, the holidays, getting sick, or you sleep half the day happens. There are plenty of other reasons, each one a different circumstance. You might have a week where life happens out of your control and you miss a session every other day for some different reason. Don’t stress, make sure to dilate as soon as you can. It will probably be more uncomfortable to get to full depth and width, but get there.
</p>
<p>
Above all don’t use the excuse that you missed one session to miss a second. Or worse don&#39;t let a single missed session be the reason for stopping.
</p>
<h1>
Making a schedule
</h1>
<p>
Having a set schedule for when you dilate can help integrate dilating with the rest of your life. It is too easy to say you will dilate &#34;in a little bit&#34; and before you know it, it is hours later.
</p>
<p>
Automatic phone alarms can be helpful to remind you so you start on time and are not tempted to skip because you won&#39;t have enough time before something else happens. Alarms that go off day after day can also help prevent one skipped session from turning into months of skipped sessions.
</p>
<p>
An example 3x a day schedule is right when you wake up, directly after work, and right before bed.
</p>
<p>
Make others aware of your schedule so they can plan to do stuff with you when you are free and not unintentionally encourage you to skip a session.
</p>
<h1>
General dilating tips and tricks
</h1>
<p>
Reward yourself for
<em>
starting
</em>
dilation. For example, in the morning delay the first sip of your coffee until you start dilation. Never reward yourself for finishing dilation which would associate stopping / not dilating with the positive reward.
</p>
<p>
Have a visual record of your effort. A calendar on the wall that you get to cross out each day you dilate.
</p>
<p>
Make dilating social. Have a dilating buddy or group. Someone you can say “I dilated&#34; to every day and they can say the same to you. And when you notice that they haven’t dilated you can ask them how they have been doing. You both encourage each other and provide another layer of accountability. This can be especially useful early on when you are cheering each other on as you progress up through the sizes.
</p>
<p>
Involve a partner. Watch movies together at night, but only when dilating.
</p>
<p>
When dilating don&#39;t mindlessly scroll on social media wishing you could be doing other things. Take advantage of the fact that you have this set aside time each day. I like to think of it as &#34;me&#34; time and I get to decide how I want to spend it. Using it to unwind, read a good book and make plans has been nice in contrast to the busy rest of the day.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Meditating (which further helps you relax your body including your pelvic floor muscle)
<br>
</li>
<li>
Listening to audiobooks (you can get free digital audiobooks from your local library or
<a href="https://librivox.org/">LibriVox
</a>
)
<br>
</li>
<li>
Watching a TV series you have been wanting to watch.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Research a trip or anything else that you were planning on doing and can
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you look forward to these activities and you only do them while dilating, by association it can cause you to look forward to dilating.
</p>
<p>
Positive self-talk. When it gets hard, cheer yourself on rather than bringing yourself down.
</p>
<p>
Not being a morning person I prepare for my morning dilation right before I head to sleep.
</p>
<p>
Once you are healed enough you can masturbate with your dilators during the sessions when there is time. This can often help with stretching too.
</p>
<p>
Change up the monotony. After sizing up to orange try adding a bigger dilator or sex toy to dilate with. Try out different lubricants to see what you like.
</p>
<p>
Being able to consistently dilate is core in the initial recovery, long term maintenance, and if you ever need to regain depth or width. Finding what works for you and making it a positive experience will help.
</p>
<h2>
Efficient dilating
</h2>
<p>
After you dilate for a few weeks it can help to take a look at what you are doing to see if you can reduce the overall time and effort you need in each session. While you might only need to dilate for 30 minutes, you could find the total time going much much longer.
</p>
<p>
The biggest win I found is picking up the first dilator. Once the dilator is in your hand you are way more likely to put lube on it and start. Even if I want to first play on my phone I will grab the dilator. And every time, once I am holding it, well I might as well take the 20 seconds to start dilating.
</p>
<p>
If you are not paying attention it can take twice as long to reach full depth.
</p>
<p>
Start a timer on your phone with your voice so you don&#39;t forget when you started.
</p>
<p>
Settings aside a place on your nightstand for your dilators, lubricant, etc you need so you don’t have to take everything out and can just start.
</p>
<p>
For storing your dilators between uses using two rectangular silicone food storage containers I found works best. Picking up the clean dilators from one container and when done laying them down in the other container. When done dilating it is easy to carry everything to be cleaned (including the container). They can’t fall over to make a mess, and cleanup is easy.
</p>
<p>
If you can keep the total time in a session down to minimal you are less likely to skip because of time pressure.
</p>
<h2>
How to stick with a new habit
</h2>
<p>
Keeping to any habit is hard! Two common times that cause people to stop dilating are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
At 2-4 months when you are living your life again.
<br>
</li>
<li>
At 5-8 months when something disrupts your schedule and one missed session becomes a slippery slope into stopping.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Is someone who has never missed a session at risk of stopping? What if I told you they saw dilating as a chore, something they wished they didn&#39;t have to do, hated that they had to plan their day around it, that it prevented them from doing things, and can&#39;t wait until they can go down to 1x a week? How about someone else who looks forward to dilating, embraced the year for the experience that it is, enjoyed dilating time as &#34;me time&#34;, frequently masturbated, or had sex after dilating? How at risk are they?
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t want to dilate you will eventually find an excuse to stop.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is something we know we need to do. We don&#39;t want to lose depth. So why is it so hard to keep the habit up for a full year? Searching the web for &#34;Why don&#39;t habits last&#34; there are a lot of tips and it is worth learning what particularly helps you maintain habits. You can use this knowledge to keep dilating all year long, and how to get back into dilating if you stop.
</p>
<h1>
Sizing up
</h1>
<p>
You can find a lot of different advice on this. In general, move to the next size up when it is comfortable to get full depth for several sessions in a row.
</p>
<h2>
Sizing up in the months after surgery
</h2>
<p>
Most start with the Soul Source purple #1 dilator after surgery and then start sizing up from there.
</p>
<p>
You might be able to size up sooner or later, but if asked for an explicit time based schedule, two weeks per dilator seems common. A week to get to full depth and another week for it to become comfortable before sizing up again. You might be able to do it sooner or later than that. Here is an example schedule based on that time frequency:
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">
Post-op
</th>
<th align="left">
Dilation frequency (splitting the time equally)
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">
0-1 Week
</td>
<td align="left">
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">
1-2 Week
</td>
<td align="left">
Purple
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">
2-4 Weeks
</td>
<td align="left">
Purple, Blue
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">
4-6 Weeks
</td>
<td align="left">
Purple, Blue, Green
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">
6 Weeks
</td>
<td align="left">
Purple, Blue, Green, Orange
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
If you have any sort of complication this can cause you to have a different schedule. Sticking with the purple or using the P2 orange while healing from the complication for a few extra weeks and then starting to size up is common.
</p>
<p>
Take advantage of the fact that early on you are dilating 3x, 4x, or even 5x a day, not working or at school, and can spend extra time in bed dilating and sizing up. The easiest time to increase the width and maintain your depth is also this very time before you get feeling inside your vagina.
</p>
<h2>
Sizing up after the scar tissue matures
</h2>
<p>
Sizing up later can be slower because the scar tissue has matured. It is important to listen to your body to not make any big tears. An inflatable sex toy might be perfect for helping here.
</p>
<p>
If you are only trying to increase your width during your once a week dilating session, switching to daily or multiple times a day is worth it so you don’t give up because of the slow progress.
</p>
<h2>
Tips and tricks
</h2>
<p>
When you are getting comfortable and thinking about sizing up soon, introduce the new size to get a feel for how big it is. Gently push it in for a few minutes at the end of every dilation session. Doing this small amount can help without the stress of trying to reach full depth or holding it in for half your session.
</p>
<p>
You don’t want it to hurt. There is a difference between a dilator that fits, the feeling of stretching to get more depth on the next size up, and pain. That feeling of stretching is what you are looking for. Uncomfortable is good, sharp pain, not so much. If it is painful, you might want to give it a few more sessions/days before trying the next size up again.
</p>
<p>
It can take a few days, a week, or more to get to full depth. Skin can only stretch so much so fast and over-stretching can lead to a tear. When in doubt go slower, especially before six weeks.
</p>
<p>
Don’t sacrifice depth for width as depth is the easiest lost and the hardest regained.  In any given session used a smaller dilator to maintain depth and a bigger one to work on width.
</p>
<p>
Pushing the dilator down (point it at the floor) will stretch the lower part of the entrance. This can help with preparing for the next size.
</p>
<p>
When using 3 or 4 dilators in a session, you might not need to apply any lube to a middle dilator.
</p>
<p>
Rather than waiting to get to full depth on a dilator before moving onto the next one, exploit the fact that the first ~3&#34; of the soul source dilators are tapered. (Or get something like the Bad Dragon Mystic for a continuous taper).
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">
Soul Source dilator
</th>
<th align="left">
diameter at tip \=&gt; shaft
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">
Purple
</td>
<td align="left">
21mm \=&gt; 28mm
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">
Blue
</td>
<td align="left">
26mm \=&gt; 31mm
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">

</td>
<td align="left">
26mm \=&gt; 35mm
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">
Orange
</td>
<td align="left">
30mm \=&gt; 38mm
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
As soon as one dilator can be inserted past ~3&#34; start incorporating the next size up into your dilation session. You might use all four like so: purple reaching full depth, blue at almost full depth and green partial depth, and orange starting on the entrance. Each one stretches out a different section of the vagina.
</p>
<p>
The Milli dilating device can be used to stretch the first ~4&#34; of the vagina (it isn’t that long) at the same time in 1mm increments, but I would try using multiple soul source dilators at the same time first.
</p>
<h2>
Gaining depth
</h2>
<p>
Reports of gaining a little depth after sizing up and it becomes comfortable are pretty common. If you stopped dilating and lost width and depth it is worth sizing up to see if that is a way to get some depth back.
</p>
<h2>
Skipping dilators
</h2>
<p>
As you size up you split the total dilation time between all the dilators you are using. This can mean you could be dilating with all four dilators at once. As long as it isn&#39;t painful, eventually only using purple or blue (as it is less pointy) with orange to make sure you maintain depth and width is common.
</p>
<p>
During sex, you will potentially go straight to something the size of green, orange, or bigger. Eliminating one dilator at a time until you can go from purple straight to orange can help in learning how to be able to comfortably jump up in size. During sex take advantage of foreplay, fingering, and don&#39;t forget to explicitly relax.
</p>
<h1>
Sex &amp; Your goal size
</h1>
<p>
For many, the reason we work our way up from the smaller dilators to the bigger ones is to be able to fit your partner or a toy. Knowing the goal is a useful incentive.
</p>
<p>
Searching online, you can find various studies of the length and girth of an average penis. Somewhere around the 4th or 5th dot and between green and orange in width is average. Average means you will find both smaller and bigger in both dimensions. For comparison reaching the fifth dot on orange means you could take 5 1/2&#34; and a 1 1/2&#34; girth and gives you a little bit of extra room over the average. Of course, a penis is squishy, doesn’t necessarily go in all the way, and if they are too long you can use a
<a href="https://ohnut.co">ohnut
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
For strap-on&#39;s, you might notice that while you can get any depth/girth you want, many of them are in fact slightly bigger than orange.
</p>
<p>
Orange is not as big as the community likes to joke that it is.
</p>
<h2>
Is this worth doing if I am not going to have sex?
</h2>
<p>
It is worth knowing that there have been many who have come to the community asking how to increase width/depth years later when they now have a partner (of all genders) whom they want to now have penetrative sex with.
</p>
<p>
Ignoring that, giving yourself vaginal orgasms when masturbating can be amazing.
</p>
<h1>
Internal orgasms
</h1>
<p>
Directly past the pelvic bone pressing up they can stroke the underside of the clitoris.
</p>
<p>
Slightly farther in the prostate can be felt and is the easier of the two to find. When you finish dilating and are at full depth angle the dilator down so the part you hold is pointing to the floor and the part in you is pointing at the ceiling. It should be poking up in you a fair amount and then move back and forth to see if you get a response. Then go back to level and pull it out 1cm or so and repeat, working your way down the full length of the dilator. I hit the spot right about when all five dots would become visible. Once I knew where the spot was it didn’t take more than a week to figure out how to achieve a vaginal orgasm.
</p>
<h1>
Urinary tract infection (UTI)
</h1>
<p>
You are more likely to get a UTI after having SRS. Having test strips at home are cheap and can save you time between if you think you might have one and getting medical help.
</p>
<h1>
Does sex count as dilation?
</h1>
<p>
This is not a yes/no question. If you are having sex with someone who is only 4.5&#34; in length and you have 6&#34; of depth and you are only having sex every three weeks would you say that alone can maintain your depth and width?
</p>
<p>
There isn’t good long term published data on this, but the best way to maintain your depth/width in the long term (read decades) appears to be having a sexual partner. Maybe it is the motivation of sex that causes someone to dilate now and then? Maybe the sex actually can count as dilation? Most likely it is as simple as without a partner you are much more likely to not dilate for a very long time. I don’t know the exact reason, but I have seen &#34;I lost depth after not having a sexual partner&#34; mentioned often enough. In between sexual partners perhaps having vaginal orgasms be your go to masturbation could help.
</p>
<p>
Remember that even if you have had sex for a long time before SRS you will go through a process of learning how to enjoy sex after SRS. Explicitly experiment with what might work best for you and communicate with your partner(s) that you are learning.
</p>
<h1>
The Goal
</h1>
<p>
The goal of dilation is to maintain the depth and width that you want. It is up to you to listen to how your body is responding when you dilate to achieve this.
</p>
<p>
The various example schedules that you get from your surgeon are only examples. The surgeon and their team are there to help you at the start, but in the long run, it is your responsibility.
</p>
<p>
Stopping during the first year should absolutely be avoided.  If 3x a day is too much for you, think about going down to 2x or 1x. When you are doing 1x a day and want to stop, do it every other day instead and only worry about depth and maybe one day work on width again. There are too many regret stories of those who stopped abruptly. If you absolutely can&#39;t dilate as much as needed, that doesn’t mean the only other choice is to give up.
</p>
<p>
We don’t have in-depth studies on long term outcomes. Long term you might need more or less than 1x a week to maintain your depth. Your surgeon will probably be long out of the picture at this point and it is up to you to listen to your body to achieve your goals.
</p>
<h1>
Thanks
</h1>
<p>
A shout out to the small discord server of women who went to Dr. McGinn around the same time as me. Having a group where everyone was recovering together was incredibly helpful. From sharing tips, encouraging each other to dilate, and so much much more I can say without a shadow of a doubt it made my recovery easier.

This is version 2 of my &#34;Guide to dilating&#34;.  It has been dramatically improved since v1 was initially posted up last year.   A lot more content, given a good editing, and the biggest thing explaining in more depth how contracture works and why it plays such a big role in dilating.  How understanding contracture means you understand how long you have to dilate, how many times, trading skipping for more difficult sessions, etc.  It was improved significantly enough that it warranted getting a new post.

Just a gripe, but golly do I have a hard time with my last inch of depth. Day 13 now and it&#39;s such a struggle. More so for the first two dilations of the day than the last two.
</p>
<p>
Brassard wants us doing #4 asap, and I used it a few times, but I&#39;ve since backed off. Just too much pain. Also I have a little dehiscience that was hurting extra and felt like ripping wider when dilating.

This was so helpful. My boyfriend (soon to be engaged?) is a bit bigger especially in girth. I keep worrying that if I go with GCS I won&#39;t be able to accommodate him. This gave me a lot of insight. We hope to marry next years and I love him and just want to make sure we can have a happy and enjoyable sex life, so this was helpful. Thanks

Sorry for commenting on an old post, but I wanted to ask:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
the microbiome will likely stabilize with a pH between 3.5 and 4.5, below the 4.5 - 5.5 pH threshold that skin needs to grow hairs
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m curious where you learned this? I&#39;ve certainly heard anecdotal evidence that many patients (who came close but didn&#39;t complete their hair removal) have no regrowth, but I&#39;d never heard anything like this which would be the underlying reason why.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this guide is great, I&#39;ve re-read it several times whenever I needed a moral boost. Thanks!

A timely read for myself at day 10.
</p>
<p>
I feel like I&#39;ve been trying too hard to do #4. Dreading it was making me tense up and the pain was making it impossible to do anything with the time.
</p>
<p>
Still trying to find what works for me. #3 is not painless but totally doable. I&#39;m going to try to make my last daily dilation go up to #4.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also a lesbian so I kind of wonder why I&#39;m even bothering sizing up to 4. (Although it is important to me to have a &#34;normal&#34; vagina capable of what a cis one can do)

So I want to ask, when you dilate for what ever the period of time is, do you like push the dilator in and leave it in, or do you have to do any motions during that time?  It’s like the only think I’m not sure about.  I’m looking at surgery myself next year and I still dont know that part.

So your suppose to put lube on the top of the dilator and have it slide down the dilator, afterwards insert the dilator into your new vagina and leave it there for the specified minutes on the dilation routine sheet you get after surgery. There shouldn’t be any turning or twisting motion cause the tip of the dilator is slightly curved. You just put it in all the way and make where the last dot on the dilator is on the outside of your vulva and you do this three times a day and shower each time afterwards to get the live out after dilating with warm water to dissolve the lube inside. It should just come straight out after you rinse inside the vagina either by inserting the tip of the squirt bottle with luke warm water or the use of a flexible detachable shower head in the shower to spray warm water inside your new vagina canal to clean out the used lube from dilation.
</p>
<p>
Tip: Don’t wear panties right after you shower. You want to air dry your vagina from the lube that you just used which now should be cleaned out from the warm water. Bacteria can from inside the vagina lining if you cover the vulva in panty cloth right after leaving the shower. You’ll soon learn after you have the surgery what you have to do. They go over it.
