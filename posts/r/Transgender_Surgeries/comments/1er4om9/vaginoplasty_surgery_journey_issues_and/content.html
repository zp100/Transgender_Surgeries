I would be worried about the inside feeling cold now which wasn&#39;t true before. It sounds like there may be blood flow issues that could lead to necrosis there.
</p>
<p>
Generally is consulting another surgeon possible for you? The one that you have doesn&#39;t sound very helpful.

That’s what I just thought about , I might have necrosis inside my vagina and the fact that he never check with a camera inside of my vagina is very frustrating since I have been having pain dilating, it aesthetics of my vagina is not good and the fact that he dismissed and ignored my issues are not right .
</p>
<p>
I booked a consultation with another surgeon , however she only can see after a year out of my surgery which will be in December, I think I will reach out to my current surgeon’s team to attempt to address this issue , but don’t think they’ll do anything about it though ! Thank you for for comment !

Looks like a vulva that has birthed a couple of babies. But it is unmistakeningly vulva.
