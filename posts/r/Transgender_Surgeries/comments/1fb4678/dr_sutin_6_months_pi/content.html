As I sit here with a dilator, which is part of a set that has spent more than 7 days inside me, I thought it was time for an update.
</p>
<p>
I’m still 6 inches in depth, I was 6.5 at my first dilation, but there was a lot of swelling back then.
</p>
<p>
Everything works well, the bean is very workable….
</p>
<p>
No pain, no discomfort, and no hair inside. (No electrolysis done prior to surgery).
</p>
<p>
My BA has been great as well. Boo and Bees are a solid 18C, which suits me perfectly.
</p>
<p>
I love how both surgeries make me look, I can wear swimwear, the girls aren’t too big to require bras all the time.
</p>
<p>
I’m so happy.
</p>
<p>
Thank you PAI, Bune, and Dr Sutin.

I was a question about PI if that&#39;s okay. I heard that you can loose depth if you don&#39;t dilate regularly and all the time is that correct? And how about sensitivity did it work itself out after 6Months? I am considering PI myself because the wait time is very low for it, compared to combined method which is more popular here in Germany. Thanks in advance.

Hiya correct.
</p>
<p>
I’m suppose to dilate twice per day for the first year, then once a day for a year, and then decrease, but yes, if you don’t dilate, you will lose depth.
</p>
<p>
Having said that, I’m only able to dilate once per day during the week, but still do it twice per day weekend.
</p>
<p>
My bean is very sensitive, very sensitive.  It’s something that some don’t like, but for me, I love.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t orgasmed from penetration, but that happens to many cis women.
</p>
<p>
I have no non sensitive areas.  Everywhere I touch, and I’ve inspected the hell out of my labia and vagina feels right.
</p>
<p>
It takes time though. You get most back within a couple of weeks, as well as zaps as the nerves wake up, but you will quickly forget how it felt having a penis.
</p>
<p>
Being a lesbian mine is for toys only anyway.

How much did the BA cost you? And where is the incision? Under the breast fold or through the armpit or under the nipples? Thank you

$9200au for 500ml of love in each boob.  Incision was in the armpit.  My girls don’t teardrop over, no idea why, but was an issue before the expansion set installed so under would be visible.

Went under the muscle, and wow, was not prepared for the pressure on my ribs when I woke.
