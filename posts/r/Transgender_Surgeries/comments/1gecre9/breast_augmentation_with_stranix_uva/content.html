<p>
Tried posting this under a throwaway but it wouldnt allow it for some reason. I really wanted to post these surgery results since there aren&#39;t many results for UVA, especially for Dr. Stranix.
</p>
<p>
I had breast augmentation with him 5 weeks ago and have been very pleased with my results. The surgical care team at UVA is extremely friendly, and this was my second surgery with them (had an orchiectomy with Dr. Corbett back in February). I will try to answer some questions I see a lot here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Selecting a Surgeon:
</strong>
I admit I selected Dr. Stranix almost purely off of location, as UVA is around an hour from me and I wanted to go to a surgeon that had experience with transgender patients. I had to get a letter from my therapist first before I could be scheduled for a consult, and then I was able to talk to Nurse Ryan before meeting Dr. Stranix. My first consult was in October 2023; I was already scheduled for FFS with a different surgeon in March 2024 so I scheduled for six months after that in September 2024. I actually didn&#39;t meet Dr. Stranix until August of 2024, but after talking to his staff several times I felt very confident about his care team amd ready for the big day.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Size:
</strong>
I am 5&#39;10&#34; tall and around 170 lbs. The breast implants I chose were 425 cc moderate round. I was only able to try on sizers for 350, 400, and 450 and I felt like 450 was a bit too big, but in hindsight I think they would have been fine. This procedure took me from not quite a 36B to filling a 36D, which is what I wanted. I would say if you are torn between two sizes, size up.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
The Surgery:
</strong>
My mom went with me to drive me home. I was in and out in ~4 hours total, and didnt have any nausea. They prescribed me some pain meds and I will admit I felt very tight and uncomfortable for about a week after surgery. The incisions healed nicely as you can see, and arent very noticeable or sensitive.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Recovery Time:
</strong>
I had surgery on a Monday morning and was back at work by Wednesday afternoon, so about 48 hours of dedicated recovery after getting home from the hospital. I have a desk job and had no problem sitting in my chair for eight hours facilitating meetings. Your mileage may vary, but just stay on top of your pain meds and take breaks if you need to. I think generally online they say recovery is two weeks but I honestly felt completely back to normal after a week, minus some occassional tightness.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
The Feelings:
</strong>
Going into surgery I wasnt as excited for BA as I was for FFS, but after surgery I realized just how much more comfortable I felt in my body. I feel so much more feminine now and even though I still have some insecurities with my appearance, this really has been such an amazing experience. I also feel like sensitivity in my nipples has increased from surgery, which is great as I didn&#39;t really feel anything from nipple play before.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I had a great experience and recently decided I will be going to Dr. Stranix and Dr. Corbett for bottom surgery as well, probably some time in early 2026.

Your results look fantastic.
</p>
<p>
I agree with your assessment of surprise at how profoundly positive a BA can be for self-image.
</p>
<p>
I’m a little over a month post-op, myself, and absolutely delighted at how I now feel about my body.

This is great! Seeing results like these really makes me want to look into getting a BA more until the time comes.
