Day 14 post SRS. Nothing new, a little bit more relaxed. The daughter of my mother&#39;s bf came to visit me and we talked. Just 1 day and a half so they take of my catheter.

Cool. How are you doing as far as pain? I&#39;m scheduled to have mine Sept 9 and I&#39;m not nervous. Just wondering how much pain I&#39;ll be looking at.

Well the worst it&#39;s the catheter. The dilatations are handleable. When u are at the hospital everything will be hard to do. Just try to walk a little bit everyday and the rest of the time rest in bed. When u are out and if u are lucky u will get removed your catheter. The rest it&#39;s bareable. But remember, the depression post surgery it&#39;s real. And be careful with that.

You will need something to entertain yourself while in the hospital. Because at the end you are gonna be on a bed doing nothing. So it&#39;s better having Netflix or something so you don&#39;t stay alone with your thoughts.

Can I ask what&#39;s the depression over? Do we get depressed because we&#39;re thinking what the fuck have I done or because the way it looks fresh fron the knife wondering if it will ever be normal or pain and being bed ridden? Being in bed is what would get to me because I&#39;m always busy busy and it never fails if I take a weekend to just lay around I can&#39;t find shit good to watch on the stream box. I kinda figured it would be a since of happiness except for the pain. Wish you a speedy recovery it won&#39;t be long before your posting pictures of the heald up and we all be jealous.  üíï

Well I&#39;m my case (idk if happens to everyone) it was due to previous depression, anxiety, being lonely, people who I thought where friends asking me nothing. The pain, the frustration of being unable to do easy things like walk. And all the time that u have with your thoughts.
</p>
<p>
At the end I&#39;m a person with several depression (tried to kill myself in the hospital 7-8 days ago). But not because of the results, at the end this is a surgery that doesn&#39;t heal completely on like a year.

Ah girl don&#39;t ever give up. We all get down at time even me and I am an extremely happy go lucky person unless my little dog isn&#39;t feeling well but I know lonely also I&#39;ve not been in a relationship since 2016 or had sex since then by my choice and I don&#39;t have any friends none I mean I&#39;ve got work friends but I drive a log truck and work in the woods and I live pretty secluded in a national forest 25mi from a store or 10 from a gas station that closes at dark, my family is 300mi away and I&#39;m still in the fkg closet so to say I have knowone that sees me really and around home I don&#39;t even wear clothes 90% of the time. It&#39;s hard to find someone who won&#39;t let you down and crush your sole. I was married twice for a total of 30yr and it took about a year getting over lonely and it was hard for me because I had been with someone all my adult life until 6yr ago and now I couldn&#39;t live with anyone again. I had no clue what freedom was or what it felt like. Hang in there üôè things will get better I promise you ‚ù§Ô∏è

I cried reading this... But it&#39;s amazing how you handled everything. Being closeted is shit, but I hope someday you can be the person you want to be someday. I send you a lot of hugs. I will still standing for everyone on my family and for everyone who wanted this but couldn&#39;t get it. Send you so much love ‚ù§Ô∏è

It depends on the individual, what painkillers they might give you, and if you have complications

This isn&#39;t too uncommon. I know a some girls who had to keep theirs in that long because of swelling making then unable to pee. It will be taken out eventually.

Good luck with the catheter! I was surprised just how easy it was to nearly piss myself just after the catheter was removed. Never stray far from the toilet! At least not until you&#39;re confident with your ability to hold it. And it is different.
</p>
<p>
And rip steady streams. Welcome in peeing everywhere like a yard sprinkler that has a kink in its neck and kicked over on its side. üòÇ It&#39;s messy.
