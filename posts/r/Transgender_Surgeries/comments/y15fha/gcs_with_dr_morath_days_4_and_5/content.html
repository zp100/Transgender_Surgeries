Hi there! I’m back with more updates. It’s been an interesting couple of days.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 4
</em>
I wake up feeling that there is something wrong. Not necessarily in the surgical area, but more generally. I was having hot flashes, a bit of a fever, back pain and general discomfort and lack of appetite. The first nurse to see me thought this could be Covid, so I got tested (again) and the result came back negative. The second nurse seemed to have a better idea and started to palpate my intestines. Turns out I was just constipated. I was given a stronger laxative along with the little breakfast that I could it and, a few hours later, I was able to go to the toilet. They instructed me not to push and to just try to let go of it while relaxing the muscles. I was skeptical at first but it did work - only it took me over half an hour of sitting on the toilet. The nurse kindly explained everything and helped me through it when needed. Then a fresh change of bandages and back to bed almost a new person and all discomfort gone.
</p>
<p>
Later in the day, and alongside lunch, I worsened again with dizziness, painful general discomfort and quite a bit of a fever (I suspected it to come as an adverse effect of one of the antibiotics I take, I always feel nasty after it goes through my IV). I improved as time passed and could it a bit of dinner late.
</p>
<p>
In the evening too, I lost my IV and as I only need antibiotics until the morning of Day 6, the doctor decided not to put it back in and instead switch to oral antibiotics. Then, I was also recovered enough to get up, walk and tidy myself up in the room on my own, which was lovely.
</p>
<p>
My new genitals continue to have little swelling and are recovering a skin/pink colour at a fascinating rate. Pain around 1-2/10. No significant bleeding or pain, aside from the discomfort resulting from the stent. They confirmed this will go out on Day 6.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 5
</em>
Today started more or less like yesterday, although it felt milder. After another Covid test I half ate breakfast and then started to feel better after some 2 hours. The doctor also put my IV back in as they didn’t have one of my antibiotics readily available for oral administration and they cannot continue delaying it in this stage. IV was reintroduced and is holding so far. Also had some problems with going to the toilet and I continue to feel constipated - it isn’t painful, but it isn’t comfortable either.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the afternoon was remarkably good and I had a good time with a visitor, at least until the evening. In the evening, and as my IV was back in, the doctor apparently decided to give me the antibiotic that I couldn’t handle well again. Despite my repeated objections, they said it was necessary and it went in. This time, I had a particularly bad reaction to the antibiotic and they had to suspend it halfway. I suddenly started running a fever and got dizzy, string headaches, general discomfort and vertigo if I dared move or tilt my head. I also started sweating a lot an could feel my heart rapidly pumping inside my head. They gave me a relatively big amount of saline with electrolytes in the IV so my body would excrete it more rapidly. I felt better after a few hours but headaches and nausea persisted until the morning after. They nurses told me I wouldn’t receive that antibiotic anymore and would take note of it in my clinical history to make sure I don’t receive it again in the future.
</p>
<p>
No news in the surgical area. There’s only pressure from the stent and pain ranged between 0-2/10. At times, it would almost feel as if they had done nothing there. Honestly, the weekend was worse because of the bad reactions to the antibiotic than because of the surgery itself. I will make sure to let my usual healthcare providers now of this so alternatives can be found in the future.
</p>
<p>
The stent and the sutures closing off my vagina are going off tomorrow!

Indeed, I’m slowly defeating these minor complications, and hope no major ones appear in the future! Thank you for your good wishes :)

Thank you for your very detailed account. Could I ask if you picked their &#34;combined&#34; method? I am very interested in it and have a consultation with them next month. Also if I could ask when were you given the surgery date? Thank you very much

Sure thing! Yes, I picked the combined method and had that done. They gave me the surgery date 3 months in advance of the surgery.

No problem! I had my consultation in September 2021, surgery planned in July 2022 and surgery in October 2022.

Wow awesome! Gives me hope of having my surgery there relatively soon. Early 2024 is okay by me if it&#39;s them :)
