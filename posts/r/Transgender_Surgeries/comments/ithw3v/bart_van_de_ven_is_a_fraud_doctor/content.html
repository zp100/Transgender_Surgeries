I’m writing this review for my comrades in this very arduous journey, and that is gender transition. My experience with Bart Van der Ven has been even more than a nightmare, and this is a wakeup call to all those who’re reading it, and to those who will burn their hard-earned money to get their FFS done.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
In a few lines: he’s a RACIST, maniac, ill-mannered, outrageously immoral and despicably unethical. But, he’ll have a fake polite smile as you do your consultation. DO NOT (I repeat, DO NOT) please get swayed by that. My face has been totally, totally, totally BOTCHED- leaving to premature oldness on my face, cross-eyed (even after 2 years of surgery), permanent balding with remarkably visible scars I the entire front part of my scalp that has happened with his coronary incision, one of the implant is swelled up with red bruises, and a remarkable/visible lump-like thing (supposedly bone cementing) in the middle of my forehead, as if it appears that my face has been bashed. My hard earned money is on ashes and CHEATED thoroughly by Bart Van de Ven.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I approached him with my already-done FFS from before. I needed the procedures: brow bone bossing, jaw angle reduction, cheek implant and nose job. Just a few minutes after the surgery when I am put to bed, Bart appears in that critical stage of my postop and starts to ask for extra money. I replied to him, that I have paid all my dues and why did he NOT mention to me pre-operation, and now when I am just out of the operation theatre. He made a drama out there and made me run unconscious downstairs in that state to pay him money at the counter.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
As I am back to my home country and my bruises started to settle, I could see, my jaw angle, bossing remains the same as it was before. He hasn’t touched a single bit for which I have paid my surgery fees. My nose job is unsatisfactory and a wide visible scar beneath my nose of the incision. My right cheek implant is swollen with infection. My cross eyed vision often leads me nearly blind and I dread if at all I am hit by a vehicle when I am on roads or outdoors.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The most painful are his RACIST remarks with my skin colour- why I am dark, and how difficult it makes him to perform surgery on my skin and subtle overtones with segregation from other white patients in his postoperative lodge/guest house – that made me understand how different I am from others.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
And often he engaged with xenophobic communication with patients from the USA and UK. I do not know where his anger comes from with non- mainland Europeans.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I WOULD LIKE TO WARN ANY PATIENTS WHO WISHES TO UNDERGO FFS UNDER HIS KNIFE. PLEASE, PLEASE DO CHOOSE AN EXPERIENCED SURGEON -RE-THINK ON THE FACT THAT, INSTEAD OF A BOTCHED UP, DEVASTATED FACE WHY NOT TO SAVE A BIT MORE AND UNDERGO SURGERY WITH AN EXPERIENCED FFS SURGEON.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I am under depression and acute anxiety. I do not know how I would end up fixing my face back. I do not want my fellow sister&#39;s to face the same brunt as I did.
</p>
<p>
he&#39;s a MONSTER, an EVIL soul. Pls pls be aware to approach him for any sort of FFS-related surgeries.

I&#39;m sorry to hear about what you&#39;re going through. I&#39;ve been on reddit for a number of years now and I can confidently say that the ffs surgeon who has had the most complaints by far here and on other trans websites is Dr Bart.
</p>
<p>
I remember checking his realself page years ago and there were quite a few negative reviews and some with photos. checking his page later on and they were gone. Not sure if he created a new profile or reached some settlement with them.

He has body count and botched so many. They aren&#39;t isolated cases for sure.

Thanks very much for your supportive words.  Strangely, it seems he&#39;s bribed realself and many significant negative comments are deleted. Realself is inauthentic and being sold in the hands of these evil doctors.
</p>
<p>
I wonder who will be the most trusted surgeon in the world to approach and get dorted with my botched face.

You should file a complaint to the board here:
<a href="https://www.ordomedic.be/nl/contact-formulier/?contact=antwerpen">https://www.ordomedic.be/nl/contact-formulier/?contact=antwerpen
</a>
</p>
<p>
And join the FFS group to share your story:

</a>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d suggest seeing other qualified and reputable maxillofacial surgeons to assess the damage and what can be done if any. I fully understand the trauma this has caused you as I&#39;m also a victim of the same provider.
