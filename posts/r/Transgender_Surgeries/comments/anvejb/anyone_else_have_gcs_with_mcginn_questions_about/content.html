Puppy pads are cheaper yes, and almost the same. But you&#39;d want to ensure you get UNSCENTED ones as most I found came infused with a smell to encourage animals to go potty there. The ones I have for my cat...the smell would have driven me insane.

I had surgery with McGinn back in May, and it was a rather uneventful affair for the most part. I had a LOT of pain, and my partner had hardly any. McGinn&#39;s pre-surgery shopping list is a great starting point for what you need, but it is basically the bare essentials. Here&#39;s my pre-surgery checklist, and some notes on things. Let me know if you have any questions!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Various Candies (Look for Sorbitol to help with dry mouth)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bottled Water - While the hospital sends you home with a huge water container, bottled water is really nice to have
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
High-protein snacks: Get Strawberry (and other flavors if you like) Soylent from Amazon. Bring about at least 24 with you. It seems expensive but it&#39;s worth every penny. This was my savior when I couldn&#39;t eat much due to the recovering digestive tract. You will be on double calories, and 5x soylents = 1 day normally. The Soylents can be added in between or with other meals for an easy way to get extra nutrition for healing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Cranberry Juice: Do you want a UTI? if not...bring this and drink it often!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Capri-Sun : While it&#39;s sugar water, it&#39;s easy to grab and drink sugar-water!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yogurt: For recovering your stomach and digestive flora
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Chicken broth: For your liquid only diet - though we did add bullion to it for flavor
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Apple Juice
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Grape Juice
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tea
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Concentrated water flavoring - Mio or Kool Ade
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Cold pre-made Jello: More easy protein and calories!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
High-fiber food items: Graham Crackers, Saltines, Bread, Muffins, etc... Soylent helps here!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Vitamin B Complex
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Vitamin B6 - 50mg
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Zinc: 220mg: This helps with healing, but really interacted with my ADHD drugs so watch out!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Probiotic Gummies
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Colace: Helps make going #2 after surgery easier
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Vitamin C (2x 500mg daily)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Triple antibiotic Neosporin or other healing ointment
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Women&#39;s Multi-vitamins
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Cheap panties
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Hand-mirror
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Towels to bleed ALL OVER: You won&#39;t really feel good getting a BnB or hotel towel soaked in red stains now would you?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bedsheets at home to bleed all over
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Hand/body wipes: You won&#39;t be showering for the first 4-5 days post-surgery....yeah
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Scar Reducer: If you&#39;re concerned about scarring there are silicone strips you can get, I don&#39;t need them but my partner is using them. I use ScarGuard on my chest scars though.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Handheld Shower-head: If you don&#39;t have a handheld shower head for when you get home, you may want to look in to putting on in. They&#39;re $30-$80 for decent ones and are really helpful when you&#39;re not 100%.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Maxi-Pads. Get the night-time heavy-flow Kotex pads that cover your bum for your first couple weeks at least, then switch to the non-winged medium ones as needed. I actually did the night pad + standard pads because my drainage was so voluminous.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bed-pads: These will SUCK to sleep on as they do not breathe. Prepare to wake up sweating if you place the bed-pad up under your back instead of more at your abdomen and below.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dilator bucket: Get a nice cheap bucket for your dilators. You&#39;ll thank yourself the first time you dilate with all 4. I&#39;m down to just 1 and 4 now, but my partner still uses 1, 3, and 4.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Baby-wash: Get Johnson-and-Johnson NoMoreTears body-wash. It is gentle and works great for your first and following showers a few days post op.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lube: Amazon has a good deal on surgical lube, and it works great. If you&#39;re in a legal state see if you can get CBD/THC coconut oil to add in to help with healing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Entertainment: You aren&#39;t going to be moving much for the first few weeks, and most of your activities will be horizontal until 2-3 weeks when you can sit upright without discomfort. A Nintendo Switch, books to read, movies/tv/youtube to watch.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Activity Tray: Look in to a mobile bed-tray you can put your laptop on during recovery and at home. We got a couple cheap ones off of Amazon that work but aren&#39;t the best or I&#39;d recommend them.
</p>

As for the routine thing...yeah both me and my partner thought the same thing. McGinn&#39;s office was surprised by our preparedness and it made us anxious how easy it all seemed. Just relax and prepare for the rest of your life!

Don&#39;t wait on the bed! We actually got a brand-new bed pre-op and I was SO happy we did. The old bed was okay, but since you&#39;re going to be in bed SO MUCH it&#39;s 100% worth the comfort. We ended up getting an IKEA king size spring mattress along with a nice cooling memory-foam mattress topper. We were also concerned about the blood, but the mattress topper + red sheets + disposable bed-pads worked GREAT. For the first weeks we kept the bed-pads stuck to the sheets but after a while you really only need them for dilating, and even then once the bleeding is done you don&#39;t need the bed-pad when dilating, just paper towels.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: You won&#39;t be bleeding much 2-3 weeks post-op unless you&#39;re dilating, and for night-time if you have a Kotex pad on it&#39;ll catch most everything.
</p>
<p>
Omg! I almost forgot! Bring a few rolls of paper towels :)

A note on the memory-foam. It is comfortable yes, but difficult to get up from. If you go that route you will learn the pain of using your abs within a couple months post-op.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, how did I forget tissues on the list?!

You won&#39;t lose your crab-walking abilities with top surgery, though you will lose the ability to use your pecs for a month or two. Using my upper body muscles just took practice to cut out the pecs from being used.
</p>
<p>
Also, make sure you&#39;re comfortable with her incision location, as my partner is waiting to have an &#34;armpit&#34; incision augmentation with a different surgeon in the future vs the under-breast augmentation I got from McGinn. I do have to say I&#39;m very happy with the results.

Did you have energy to play games after surgery? Thinking of taking my Switch with me (alongside my laptop) to Thailand but I am also afraid of popping a stitch when playing Smash Ultimate as that game tilts me beyond belief. Jokes aside, I do wonder if I will have time for laptop and Switch. I heard we spend a lot of time sleeping.

You&#39;ll have time for the laptop and switch. You&#39;re only in the hospital all groggy for a couple days, then you&#39;ll be bored in your hotel. Breath of the Wild was my and my partner&#39;s favorite game while recovering.

Why does the hospital supply you with water? Is there something wrong with tap water?

They give you a big water jug you can fill with whatever. They give you filtered water in the hospital, and you can use tap when you get home. I personally didn&#39;t like the plastic taste of the thing so I used my own water-bottle at home.

Would you mind if I sent you a question or two about your experience with McGinn? I&#39;m considering going to her.

Another McGinn veteran here- just had my six month followup.  I was lo-depth so I can&#39;t contribute to the dilation discussion however...
</p>

I would recommend bringing some extra soft pillows to the Barrix clinic- the beds there were excruciating on my back.  I didn&#39;t need any meds for the surgery pain but the pain in my back from those beds was brutal!  Yeah it&#39;s only for a few days but those days can seem very long without something to help support your back properly.  There&#39;s nothing entertaining going on at the Barrix clinic so my headphones and lots of downloaded music were key!  No way I could have used a laptop in that bed but I&#39;m not much for visual entertainment anyway.
</p>

I stayed in the Gia house after.  It&#39;s pretty expensive but really nice inside and having breakfast brought in was wonderful.  I ate tons of jello as it&#39;s all I really wanted to eat for the first week. I brought lots of electrolyte power as my lips and body were really dried out after the surgery. Also read loads of books but best of all was a good companion!  My mom and daughter kept me entertained and it was really nice to catch up without a bunch of interruptions. It might be useful to learn &amp; practice the &#34;log roll&#34; method of getting out of bed- I didn&#39;t and it really helped once my mom taught it to me.  Otherwise getting out of bed would have been close to physically impossible without massive pain.

I will echo the new mattress recommendation.  I have a new memory foam mattress and it was a life / back saver.  It&#39;s pretty tough to stay only on your back for weeks and if I&#39;d had a lousy mattress (like in the Barrix) I honestly don&#39;t think I could have coped.  New mattress (and a good waterproof pad) are highly recommended.

That&#39;s awesome.  Service at the place was outstanding and the decks (I was there in July) gave some welcome relief from staring at the four walls!
