<p>
So sadly you don&#39;t hear a lot about German surgeons on here, but I had a bit of a question about how good Dr Schaff actually is. Before he quit in Munich Pasing, I had a consultation appointment with him where I got to know him a bit and got to ask more or less most of my questions (some of which fell to the wayside because I was nervous and he was a bit of a grasping presence).
</p>
<p>
What I gathered from that appointment was that he&#39;s at least very convinced of himself but that based on what he told me and my research that it indeed seems to be superior to German PI offerings. Let me give a play by play:
</p>
<p>
I sat in the waiting room with only one person besides myself in it. And the bugger manages to call me up by my full, misgendered deadname. Great. I go to him and he apologises, saying how he gas got another patient by that name who goes by male gender. Fine, I guess. I was a bit stunned and just stood there next to him. &#34;Come along then, come on!&#34; he said (roughly translated) and pushed me along by the shoulder. Not so great.
</p>
<p>
He had trouble getting his presentation to work and so I helped him sort out his MacBook. He first started talking about the history of GRS and how the initial PI technique came to be and why he decided to deviate from it, explaining how there&#39;s a lot of collateral damage in the mons pubis area from the pulling in of the skin, plus how the augmentation of the then compromised mons pubis can actually further damage the nerves that run towards the genital area. After some further explanation he went on to aesthetics. I don&#39;t quite remember it that clearly, in which order it came up, but it was roughly like this: He explained how he&#39;s able to construct labia minora that are capable of sexual sensation and how the labia minora improve the aesthetics drastically. What he also said &#34;It&#39;s also an attraction impulse to the men, of course&#34; Yikes, mate. I&#39;m bi. What about us gals? Also, my being attractive does not purely exist for men, but primarily myself (especially since my fiancé died and I&#39;m hyper monogamous and grieving). Unfortunately I was so grasped of the idea of having a chance at a working genital that my sass had yet again taken a complete backseat and I didn&#39;t say anything. I think even before that he had already gone on about the different shapes a vulva comes in, a fact that as a proud woman who doesn&#39;t like to follow aesthetic trends is well known to me. He then pointed to the stereotypical
<em>
innie
</em>
vulva on screen and said &#34;That&#39;s what you lot all want..&#34; Mate... Don&#39;t throw me in with an imagined, supposed mainstream. In fact I had already done a bit of research and roughly decided on a preference that I wanted to ask for if it was at all possible to nudge the healing process towards. But with this instance as well I didn&#39;t say anything because
<em>
meep me want vagina
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
So yea, the rest went on how the vaginal canal is constructed of partly the mucosa of the urethra and so on and so forth and how it allows for a healthy bacterial culture. I asked him how you get the bacteria in there, I had heard that there&#39;s vaginal tablets that you can get in drug stores, but he denied that and said that a gynaecologist would take care of it in due time. He also said that one could also use yoghurt as a home remedy (- I noted I did not want to shove yoghurt up there) - but not strawberry flavoured yoghurt! To be fair, that did make me giggle a bit.
</p>
<p>
So, my question is: Since he has gone private again with no specific word on when and how people with ordinary insurance would be able to be treated by him, the decision starts being influenced by financial issues as well. Besides himself you&#39;ve got Dr Morath operating using that technique in another private clinic in Munich. Presently I don&#39;t know whether the clinic in Potsdam or Munich would be more expensive. Would it be worth going
<em>
to the inventor
</em>
of the technique despite a potential extra cost to the copay compared to Munich or would Dr Morath, who had for a long time operated with him, be just as good as him?
</p>
<p>
Is my attitude of Schaff &#34;I don&#39;t have to like the bloke, he just needs to do a good job medically&#34; correct? Because he did come across as pretty archaic in his attitudes for someone working in that field.
</p>
<p>
And how ultimately good actually is the combined method? Is anyone here who would like to share specifics?
</p>
<p>
EDIT: The appointment was back in October so the whole account is a bit disjointed. His faux pas definitely weren&#39;t pretty but I&#39;ve met men who were far worse than him. He did seem very sure and proud of himself, and yes that pride was brushing the line towards being full of himself in my opinion, but I still think it could have been a lot worse. Sure, he&#39;s not the most empathetic person ever (Purely from a medical standpoint he wanted to know whether I was planning to have P in V sex and I started crying thinking of James, my fiancé and I think I remember that we dropped that topic entirely, because I was too distracted to give an answer and ask why he was asking) My whole impression of the situation is this: Not the loveliest and most kind bloke, but for someone who is limited to Germany with a lot of surgeons that use very archaic variants of the PI (ie the whole glans just sutured in very deep as a clitoris without preputium and such), he&#39;s probably the better option. I&#39;ve got one shot at this and it&#39;s going to be what I can discern from the fragmented information that&#39;s out there is the best. And all in all, he did seem at the very least interested in his work and field with his general air of pride definitely also reaching into it.

<p>
Costs and alternatives
</p>
<p>
Some details regarding cost and alternatives first - at least my (public, German) health insurance agreed to partly cover the costs, meaning Schaff would cost ~9500€ in total. Morath/Schöll cost 3000€ (as I wrote in a separate comment below), and Heß, who also does the combined method as learnt from Schaff, costs nothing extra. It is relevant to note that Schaff seems to be actively searching for a new hospital where he can work with publicly insured patients - as told to me by his secretary a couple weeks ago. I believe there is also at least one other surgeon who performs the combined method, or at least claims to, but their name escapes me.
</p>
<p>
The method
</p>
<p>
The combined method is largely just an advanced PI. PI has used both penile and scrotal tissue for decades - Schaff added spatulated urethral tissue for the vaginal canal, as had also been done by e.g. Perovic (Djordjevic&#39;s mentor - Serbia), as described in their 2000 paper. With regards to the other specifics he describes, I don&#39;t know that they would necessarily be so different from other surgeons, with perhaps the exception of the labia minora - I have seen it claimed that he creates the labia minora in the same way that Suporn does, i.e. with preputial skin (foreskin) lining the inside and penile skin lining the outside. I do not know whether this is true or not, but this is not a technique I am familiar with other surgeons outside of Suporn doing - though many surgeons do not describe in detail how they make labia minora.
</p>
<p>
Three papers have been published regarding what is ostensibly Schaff&#39;s patients and the combined method, I would recommend reading them (use sci-hub if you lack institutional access):

Where to see results
</p>
<p>
Results not linked on the wiki that I am aware of can be found in the TGG facebook group, alongside naturally lots of experiences, and the Transsexuelle und Angehörige nach F64.0 (I know) - here you have to introduce yourself in German to be able to see this section of the forum.
</p>
<p>
A note on Morath/Schöll
</p>
<p>
If you do choose to go to Morath&#39;s practice, bear in mind that Schöll still has very little experience being the primary surgeon
</p>
<p>
A personal opinion
</p>
<p>
I found Schaff extremely competent, while also naturally rather a salesperson. He produces what appear to be consistently satisfying results, his published statistics are promising, and he has a good deal of experience. He is also getting rather old, which could be a concern. He is, essentially, a good surgeon. Do I think he&#39;s worth paying 33 grand for? No, not really, I don&#39;t know why you wouldn&#39;t go to Thailand at that point, and pay less for other good surgeons. Do I intend to choose him, given I only have to pay a little shy of 10 grand? No. Would I choose him if he was still free? Honestly, I don&#39;t think so - lubrication is important to me, and while the urethral tissue makes it more likely that you produce lubrication, it&#39;s no real guarantee.

I didn&#39;t know Schöll would do the majority work. I had practically wanted Morath to do it while Schöll operates the operating theatre stereo, so to speak (hehe). Any ideas whether you could insist on getting Morath as the one doing the operation / being the mainly responsible person? I would at least guess that when he is helping with the procedure then she would correct him (I hope).
</p>
<p>
And yes it is true, Schaff is definitely a magnetic salesman, heh... 😅 He&#39;s got the charisma, but his attitude needs some work...

Schöll doesn&#39;t do the majority, as far as I know, but he has started to perform as the primary surgeon (i.e. the main person in an operation, not primary as in the main of the two of them!) in tandem, so presumably as frequently. I would assume you can insist on Morath, but I guess one never knows who&#39;s actually doing the work when you&#39;re under.
</p>
<p>
For what it&#39;s worth, I have consulted with both Morath and Schaff, and I found Morath tendentially less competent - she insisted that I would need an additional skin graft and agreed that it wouldn&#39;t be a problem if I had it on the outside of the leg, and didn&#39;t think remnants of a penile thrombosis would be any problem at all. Schaff said there was no reason I would need an additional graft, pointed out why it would have been irresponsible to take this from the outside of the leg, and immediately talked about how he would change his technique to accommodate the remnants of this thrombosis.
</p>
<p>
While I haven&#39;t consulted with him personally, if you can&#39;t afford Schaff and have the time to stomach the waiting list, I would suggest opting for Heß. He also has published papers with fairly impressive statistics, and those were from before he even switched to the combined method. From the research I&#39;ve done, and these experiences, Schaff and Heß are the only two I would trust in Germany.

Well I had already braced for the one and a half year waiting list for Schaff (despite having noooouuu idea how to save my soul until then) so depending on how tough it is with Heß then fair enough I guess? Though even if Morath isn&#39;t as skilled, as long as she doesn&#39;t come up with any crazy ideas about what to do with my particular base material then it should be easy enough for her. Schaff had a look and said &#34;That&#39;ll do nicely!&#34;
</p>
<p>
And Schaff is indeed trying to get onto public insurance coverage as my therapist tells me. It&#39;s going to be an interesting race then... Guess I&#39;ll do some research on Heß as well.

I had my GRS with Schaff back when he was still working with Morath.
</p>
<p>
In terms of sensitivity and aesthetics, I give him top marks. Depth is average and unfortunately I didn&#39;t get any self lubrication, but it&#39;s something that I knew wasn&#39;t a guarantee. Overall I am very satisfied with the results and glad I went with him (although I agree that his mannerisms can be a bit old school).
</p>
<p>
From what I&#39;ve discussed with other patients of Schaff and Morath, I believe their results are both of a very similar quality so it is perfectly reasonable to make your decision based on cost.
</p>
<p>
I met Schöll a few times during my recovery and I can definitely vouch for his character as a friendly and empathetic person. However, I haven&#39;t seen any results where he has been the lead surgeon, so can&#39;t confirm whether his results are of the same standard as Schaff/Morath
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps!

I had consultations with two other surgeons and asked them why they don&#39;t use this technique and they both told me about people who weren’t that happy after a few years. Urethra placed like that can be quite painful and dry out over time. Also „Standard PI“ ≠ the same standard, surgeons usually adapt their techniques with experience. Maybe not all of them feel the need to sell it as a new or combined method because they know in the end it is still a PI, period. The extra fee one had to pay with Schaff always made me suspicious. Also I don&#39;t like cis men who think Vaginoplasty is about them.

Well the extra fee so far has only about him being with private clinics. At the Lubos clinic I could have had it on standard healthcare at no extra cost. The clinics actually set the prices for everything (keep in mind that it also includes everything around the surgery). As it stands right now, I could get Schaff or Morath on standard healthcare after some bickering with the insurance company while having to pay the difference of standard cost vs private clinic.
</p>
<p>
To my knowledge, anyway.

Prior to 2020, when he worked together with Morath, they charged an extra 3000€ fee, which they billed as an &#39;aesthetic surcharge&#39; (&#39;Ästetischer Zuschlag&#39;). Morath/Schöll still charge this, to my knowledge - it is not a cost that can be covered by one&#39;s health insurance, but is strictly on top.

I have a quote from beginning of this year that says it&#39;s nowadays around 4000 after tax. To be honest, it&#39;s a plastic surgery clinic so you&#39;d have to be expecting it. It&#39;s probably now with Potsdam vs Munich a
<em>
pick your poison
</em>
situation: either the aesthetic tax or the private clinic tax. Whichever comes out as cheapest. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong.

Exactly, 3k or 4k extra to a surgery that is already covered by insurance. Aesthetics? Sorry, but I doubt they achieve anything close to Suporn/Banks and have no guarantee to be any more pretty than other surgeon&#39;s results who are similarly experienced of which there are definitely a dozen now in Germany. Aesthetics depend a lot on other factors apart from a surgeons steady hand. As far as I&#39;ve read in a German trans group the clinic&#39;s staff was rather surprised by the extra fee when a patient brought it up, so I doubt this is solely based on the clinic.

Well what Schaff himself showed me of his results did all look like anatomically correct vulvae so, eh... My current position is that the combined method is a whole lot better than what PI in Germany ends up being, so it&#39;s either Schaff or Morath. Ultimately it&#39;s going to end up being what best aligns with the criteria: optimal result at relative,
<em>
relative
</em>
, ease of acquisition, to put it in a more general term than just monetary concerns.

What do you mean with &#34;PI in Germany&#34;? To which surgeon are you comparing this exactly? There are actually a few handful in Germany... Did you talk to any other surgeon? I think you underestimate surgeons who have years of experience as well and are constantly updating and adapting their techniques.

Well like I said, he&#39;s not the worst, but he did have a few faux pas that I would like to talk over with him should he become my operating surgeon. For the sake of other girls. Perhaps he can still learn a few new tricks.

His work seems to be a very high caliber.  I&#39;m sure if you voices your concerns about aesthetics reasonably, he&#39;d do what he can.
</p>
<p>
Beliefs go out the window.  Will he deliver the results you want and be there to resolve issues when it&#39;s over?  If you go forward with him in the process, and tell him you&#39;re actually gay, it would be a very helpful account to give back.
</p>
<p>
Bc if he does treat you differently for being a lesbian, then yikes.

I&#39;m not gay though, that&#39;d be only half true. I&#39;m so severely bi it couldn&#39;t be more.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, I would quip at him for a bit of a laugh whenever he comes around to check on me (post OP during the big walkabout they make to check on patients because I&#39;d definitely be nervous and excited and I know how I act when I&#39;m positively nervous) / reasonably voice a complaint about his attitude if I ever see him again in another appointment

Sorry, bi.  I read that wrong.
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;m trying to remember if germany is one of the heavily gatekept countries.  Like, where if you&#39;re not straight they question if your trans.  I thought it was one where you had to present for a while to even get hrt.
</p>
<p>
But even so, you&#39;re right, he shouldn&#39;t pitch aesthetics based on what men want.
</p>
<p>
I guess I didn&#39;t understand from your post if he was genuinely rude or just not as progressive as those in the lgbt community prefer.

No, that&#39;s definitely not Germany you&#39;re thinking of.
</p>
<p>
And the attraction thing, what bothered me most was more the fact that since he already brought up attraction, he didn&#39;t mention girls at all which he should have or not bring it up. I wouldn&#39;t call it homophobic, by the way, since he&#39;s probably just not used to accounting for these things because
<em>
straight man

. He was a bit rude and a bit not progressive enough considering that he has had contact with around a thousand trans women so far.

That&#39;s just down to picking the right therapist though and it&#39;s not considered the general consensus.

The S3 guidelines are not necessarily binding and the version from 2009 is soon to be superseded by a new revision that significantly improves its recommendations. There&#39;s actually no liability whatsoever for therapists and easy things like HRT are up to the therapist as to when they write the indication letter. A lot of the old farts and of course the Krankenkasse themselves like to tell people otherwise for various reasons (not even stopping at lying btw), but generally there&#39;s more flexibility than you have probably been told.
</p>
<p>
And then there&#39;s of course my therapist who has no qualms with lying to the Kasse about the actual duration of therapy done to bypass even the remaining restrictions.

I know,
<em>
not all men
</em>
but the idea heavily suggests itself since he&#39;s of the older generation and just felt a bit stereotypical in the presentation of his attitudes. The usual &#34;there&#39;s a certain margin of truth in stereotypes&#34; discussion applies. I don&#39;t know how to phrase it but you probably would have felt it as well had you met him in person.

I think you&#39;re right, it&#39;s totally imaginable.  His skills are high enough that you hope it&#39;s not the case but still good that you have everyone here the warning.
</p>
<p>
And about straight men, it&#39;s just that as a straight woman, it&#39;s hard to hear comments like that.  Sometimes it&#39;s unfairly putting down the good ones and also women like me for dating them.  Not saying that&#39;s what you did, but some people do and that&#39;s not fun.

To be clear, I looooove certain types of masculinity (Jaaaaames 😭), if we&#39;re that specific. I&#39;m not

kind of gal.

And he just

felt

that way, you know? Like it wasn&#39;t all entirely unproblematic, especially when you add everything up. I trust his skills more than his humanity though, as it were.

Working with so many trans people he should have pucked up one or the other thing. That&#39;s absolutely not an excuse. He hasn&#39;t picked up any more progressive stances, and that&#39;s entirely on him, as well as his horrid arrogance in general.

Honestly like every other “god tier” surgeon i get these impression he is quite overrated. Especially if he thinks he’s special for creating sensitive labia minora.
</p>
<p>
With PI they are created using the skin of the penile shaft, or at least mine were (i noticed because I recognized a birth mark lol!) , so of course they should be sensitive. Using urethra tissue is also nothing special.
</p>
<p>
Sounds like another surgeon who is perhaps better at puffing himself up than the rest. He keeps getting talked about lately as having a magic “combined technique” that is suporns technique and pi together. I think most people just don’t realize that suporns technique is almost identical to PI, he just takes bigger risks with the scrotal graft to make it go further, which honestly is made redundant by the modern robotically assisted PPT method

You have to take into consideration though that I&#39;ve zero budget to go to different countries with this AND that to my knowledge nobody is using meshed skin techniques in Germany. I&#39;ve also the feeling that whilst he is a bit of an oldschool fool, he may also be onto something with his technique. One does not exclude the other. What I see from other more well known German surgeons just doesn&#39;t seem to include all the features of a combined method job, with some to many still using the very classic PI method. I had that impression even before I met him in person and he has said it himself that a lot of considerations aren&#39;t taken by many surgeons which aligns with my research.

I’m glad you said this, at the end of the day all these surgeons are business people and they’re selling us a service. The best ones know what concerns their audiences have and market accordingly. While it is important to make sure you can trust them (or at the very least trust  what they’re going to do to you) and that you do your research. I do think it’s good to take some of their big  “No one else does this like me!” claims with a little grain of salt.

He never said nobody else did it as well though. And he did encourage me to go to other consultations with other surgeons, which I&#39;m unlikely to do though since I&#39;ve no money to spare on travelling to
<em>
several
</em>
surgeons. Even if he&#39;s not the only one to manage inner labia and ones that feel at that, to my knowledge his remarks on the nerves running along down the pubic bone make sense.

Okay, so why do you say nobody else does it as well when you did not have a conversation with any other surgeon and he did not tell you that nobody does it like him? Who is it then that tells you, he would be the only good option? I had my surgery with Riechardt in Hamburg and know a few others who did and everyone was happy. There are also a few other surgeons in Germany like Witczak, Liedl, Markovsky and Krege of whom I heard good things.

From what trans women told me who&#39;ve been with him, he does a similiar adapted method. As I said earlier, many surgeons adapted their techniques, they just don&#39;t sell it as &#34;combined&#34; or &#34;better&#34;, because it&#39;s what any reasonable surgeon does over time. It&#39;s not like everyone else lives under a rock and doesn&#39;t take into consideration how other surgeons improved PI.
<br>
Schaff will eventually retire and you will still find many good surgeons in Germany, some of them women who tend not to speak too highly of themselves and sell their work as if they&#39;ve just invented sth nobody has ever thought of before. I can only recommend that you also approach other surgeons, some will probably also offer consultation via telephone or sth because of Covid these days. You will find some who are just as good or even better, there is one surgeon of whom I&#39;ve also heard very bad things, but that&#39;s no secret.

I don&#39;t think you can really answer this question properly. There&#39;s almost nothing public about him, nor about the other German surgeons you mention.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a bit of info in the wiki, but even if you like it, who knows how representative it is.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_jurgen_schaff" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_jurgen_schaff</a>
</p>
<p>
If you compare this to some of the other surgeons in the USA and Thailand the difference in the amount of the information is more apparent.

I think that’s more due to a language issue and a legal one.

I know Frau Dr Silke Riechardt in Hamburg does 200 operations a year and she hardly gets a mention either.

Legal only applies to surgeons posting photos, and that’s only a small minority of results for the surgeons I was referring to. I’ve looked on German language forums and found very little, so I’d say there’s some other reason, perhaps cultural or level of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t matter though, as the issue I was raising is risk. If you can’t independently check the surgeon then the risk is higher.

My point was more they aren’t going to share it on an English wiki.
</p>
<p>
You’ll find a lot more shared on the German Facebook group TGG. No photos though.. because it’s Facebook.

Can&#39;t really say, aside from despite his age he doesn&#39;t appear to be a tatty old man, so at least from appearances I would guess that at the very least he probably hasn&#39;t become sloppy. If you haven&#39;t already, just note him down as operating in Potsdam Sancoussi now and by hearsay he&#39;s supposedly looking for a way for patients without private insurance to have him covered. I got that info from my therapist and he&#39;s got connections to someone who meets with him often.

When he was at Lubos he warned me of a current backlog of one and a half years. Might be now more or less, depending on how him going to a private clinic has influenced the number of people being signed up.

4 months for the private clinic as of last week, i.e. booking for March. He only operates there on two days a month, though, so could be liable to get longer quite quickly.

If money weren&#39;t an issue, would you choose him over morath/schöll?
</p>
<p>
Also, do you think he&#39;d behave unprofessionally when talked back? I&#39;m not sure my sass can take a back seat when I have my consultation with him.
</p>
<p>
Btw: how did you manage to talk to him at the lubos clinic in october? Been there mid september and he wasn&#39;t available afaik.

I just got a very lucky appointment with him, someone cancelled and they let me slip the queue. Squealed like a little girl and picked out the surprisingly cheap train and bus tickets to and from Munich and everything was logged in
</p>
<p>
If money indeed weren&#39;t an issue then yes I probably would go to him, after some further consideration and a very thorough spree of consulting with all sorts of surgeons that offer the method I want, comparing them all and grilling them on their skills and their opinions of their peers.
</p>
<p>
As to back talk, no idea. Just keep it mature and polite and perhaps it&#39;ll go well. Maybe he learns something, maybe not, who knows!

Good to know all that, and what sort of treatment to expect! I&#39;ve got a consultation with him next month, but I&#39;m considering my UK options as well (I&#39;m in the UK). The surgery in Potsdam is about double the cost (£30,000 vs £15,000), and it&#39;s possible to get scrotal done here, though I&#39;m going to discuss this next week and get more information about it.

I like to reiterate, he could have been a lot worse socially and at least the way it&#39;s presented the method seems very successful and low risk (ie very rare cases of ruptured intestines, I vaguely remember about four blood transfusions required out of roughly 900 cases, minor necrosis on labial tissue in one case where part of the minora of one side fell off but otherwise it looked stellar [not sure about function impairment]).
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s not the biggest heteronormative sexist in the world, but he could learn a thing or two in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
Besides that all info I&#39;ve got on the method is from him and online research. How foolproof that actually is, no idea. But it does sound fantastic compared to the other stuff.

I had the appointment this week, and it was fine. When we were talking about partner support, he asked whether my partner was a man or woman, and was quite appropriate. Maybe he has learnt :-)

Hm, I don&#39;t know. Can&#39;t imagine he changed his aura that quickly. We skipped that question more or less unintentionally because I started sobbing about James. I didn&#39;t even get to say it was a he.

<p>
He just came off as very &#34;classic older man with an attitude&#34; to me.

I’m about to relocate to Germany and I want to do SRS so I wonder if I should take the private insurance just to have a shot in having the SRS with him and not paying 33K euros.

Well private insurance itself does cost a premium so it all depends on your budget. It has again to be said that he&#39;s not the only one doing the method and Dr Morath
<em>
presumably
</em>
is decent herself at it. Btw on public insurance you&#39;d be able to plea with the insurance for them to cover as much as they&#39;re willing and you&#39;d be left to pay the difference (consisting presumably of PI standard fare paid by them and you paying the rest). That&#39;d be around €4k for Morath, after tax (relatively recent quote from last year). Don&#39;t know the quote for Potsdam though.

It seems that in my situation it is better to have a German private insurance, now I need to find the one that will be willing to cover such a procedure. I have no idea how to find out though

Probably going through all the insurance comparison websites and then picking through the respective policies. I read transgender related things specifically need to be in the policy in order for it to be valid.
