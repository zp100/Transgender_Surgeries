I&#39;m day 8 post op, 24 hours since the bolster came off.  I don&#39;t know if my labia can take anymore inflammation :(
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m curious to know what day you noticed the swelling going down?

That&#39;s very fortunate!
</p>
<p>
My swelling was down when it came off, but in 24 hours went up.  I don&#39;t want any wound separation.
</p>
<p>
I blame using pads that prevented the ice from being effective.  Pads are off, underwear destroyed, but swelling is coming down a little.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the info, very helpful!

Things started to look &#34;normal&#34; for me after about a month, although it takes considerably longer (like a year or more) for swelling to completely dissipate. Peak swelling for me was probably right after surgery—things were really ugly down there, but they came down very quickly.
</p>
<p>
Be aware that physical activity can increase bloodflow, which can make it swell more. It is good to be up and about to promote healing, but don&#39;t be too active, as that can be counterproductive.
</p>
<p>
Also be aware that as the numbness in your vulva and abdomen starts to decline, the area will likely get more painful, or painful in different ways. This might also promote inflammation. And if you&#39;re straining for bowel movements, that&#39;s not good either—eat your fiber!
</p>
<p>
So basically the inflammation may see saw for a while but as long as you&#39;re resting and icing and getting good nutrition, things should resolve on their own. That said, if you are noticing weird things or are getting concerned, you should definitely reach out to your doctor.

Thanks!
</p>
<p>
Inflammation went up bc I had a thick pad and the ice couldn&#39;t work. It&#39;s getting better now, but I destroyed some panties :(
</p>
<p>
I eat fiber, I take stool softeners, but bowel movements are long and painful bc I can&#39;t sit very well.  And idk what happened, but the amount I have to go after surgery has been absurd.  I don&#39;t even eat that much and it&#39;s like enough for three people:(
</p>
<p>
I do keep in touch daily with my Dr. I just want the initial spike to go down so I don&#39;t have wound separation.

That&#39;s good to know because I&#39;m almost 3 months post op and my vulva looks thicker than the average women&#39;s so I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s just still swollen.

Would hope for that!  Do u mean the next day after removing the bolster?  Or right after surgery?

<p>
I can handle where I&#39;m at, but more and I&#39;m afraid it will pop 😬

They took my &#34;bolster&#34; (more like very well taped down gauze) on my second day and my swelling wasn&#39;t that bad, I pretty much noticed it begin going down on my fourth or fifth day. I also had a bad case of hematoma in my right labia, which was better by week two and a half. I&#39;m now four weeks post-op and most of my external swelling is completely gone. Just got some hard spots under my labia that are being caused by my body trying to dissolve my stitches - every time I go in a check-up and they remove unraveling stitches the healing takes a huge leap in that area.
</p>
<p>
Disclaimer; I&#39;ve been told I&#39;m running easily a week ahead of schedule in my healing.

I think my swelling hit 100% by the next day(wednesday).  The bandaging and such was removed the following day and the swelling just sorta stayed the same, and shortly started subsiding by that friday.  Today(exactly two weeks since GCS), I dont feel any swelling and its visibly reduced as well.  There is still swelling if I push on anything, but not touching it its not noticable.

SRS is a fairly large surgery. During the first week, it becomes very swollen.My swelling has been swollen for months. I have undergone surgery with Dr. Kanit Thailand. Over the years I&#39;ve accepted that I cured my swelling, pain, patience and fighting.

I’m over a week post-op and my swelling is still like wasssupp, I hate it! Yesterday was supposed to be my first full day dilating and I literally could not for the life of me get the smallest—like actually the smallest, the physical therapist had to give me a different set of dilators that are smaller :(—dilator in. Everything is too swollen and it hurts!

Depending on your surgeon and how much like lips and labia and clitoris and everything are able to provide or based on your specific needs on how you want it swelling can be very minimal I think it’s the area around the clitoris that really just takes the longest placement and everything and that’s for me what I found to be the most difficult but I got a peritoneal flap Vaginoplasty So nice it’s very beautiful very natural inside and outside self lubrication and everything wetness is amazing. Within two weeks I was talking to some of my girlfriends and they were told me wow that shit looks beautiful so it really just comes down to the surgeon and how they rewire your anatomy but taking multivitamins be complex vitamin D3 I also take progesterone that helps keep the body strong. So your overall health and your intake on Healthy stuff really does play a big role in recovery because for me bye So nice it’s very beautiful very natural inside and outside self lubrication and everything wetness is amazing.

So your overall health and your intake on Healthy stuff really does play a big role in recovery because for me by DAY6 I was up and walking just fine two days later I got my catheter removed and I continue to do physical therapy and occupational therapy exercises to get strong. I think for me swelling in the stomach is also very strong due to the fact that that’s where most of my surgery took place to form my vagina but I have 8 inches of depth beautiful self lubricanting vagina
