I had a simple orchiectomy with no issue about 3 months ago (8/28). I was miffed that nobody explained that my cords would be sewn to my scrotum during recovery, but didn&#39;t mind once the left side correctly detached after 3 or so weeks.
</p>
<p>
However, it&#39;s been 3 months and the right side has not detached, is painful to pinch (it&#39;s obviously scar tissue). I&#39;ve got an appointment to get it looked at, but they can&#39;t see me for another month, 12/23. I chose simple because the inguinal would leave scars on my hips which I didn&#39;t want. However, knowing what I know now I would&#39;ve gone for the inguinal because I wouldn&#39;t have to have dealt with any of this, and I wouldn&#39;t have awkward feeling half cords, which I assume will only get smaller.
</p>
<p>
I have pretty much given up hope that it will magically detach itself, since the amount of pressure on either side should have pulled them apart by now. This is a constant point of discomfort and mild pain. Does anyone know how unusual this is? I imagine it&#39;s incredibly unusual.
</p>
<p>
I was wondering if anyone else could help me out with their personal experience on whether not this has happened to them.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m deeply afraid of surgery, and Orchi is the only surgery I wanted. I&#39;m assuming I will now I to go back for another (or at best a quick vasectomy style procedure) to correct this, and that likely won&#39;t happen for another two months at best. I&#39;m really sad.

I remember after my orchie I felt this, I did eventually go away. Honestly I think it was sometime near the one year mark, but I can&#39;t remember.
</p>
<p>
I also thought I was going to need surgery again to fix it, but eventually it just &#34;went away&#34; on its own.

Honestly, it didn&#39;t hurt that bad, and I just ignored it because I didn&#39;t know what else to do. It was on my left side, It just felt swollen, and if you hit it funny it would hurt quite a bit actually, so I just tried to avoid getting hit funny

Had my simple orchi 2019/01 and I was about fully recovered around 3 months. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having so much pain. :(. I&#39;m unsure how my coords were tied after my procedure

Thank you, I&#39;m optimistic that the checkup will help set things straight...I hope! I just wish it didn&#39;t hurt when...trying to enjoy myself, because it ends up triggering dysphoria, which is the opposite of the expected result from the surgery ._.

Would you mind saying who your surgeon was?
