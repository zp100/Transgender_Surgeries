Hi!I had a vaginoplasty a little over a year ago and started having granulation tissue symptoms at 2-3 months after the surgery. I had pain, bleeding, discharge... Every time I told my surgeon about my symptoms and he would come up with different explanations like &#34;its because sizing up dilator size&#34;, &#34;it takes time to heal&#34;, &#34;sometimes the woulds take time to close&#34;, etc always followed by its normal, everything is fine and not to worry. But never mentioned that it could be granulation tissue, despite that it is a very common complication.
</p>
<p>
At about 5 months I found out I had a bit of tissue hanging out of my vagina for which the surgeon gave me 3 different explanations, one after each piece of information I provided (photo, video...) and at the end, none of these was correct.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t had a consult until 6 moths after surgery and he didn&#39;t even take a look inside, just used his hand to touch everything and caused me a lot of pain and bleeding that lasted a few days. Said everything is normal and not to worry. About the hanging bit, he said that it may need surgery to be removed, or it may resolve itself.
</p>
<p>
I had my last consult at 11 months after surgery, after bleeding all those months and reducing the dilator size due to unbearable pain. He finally took a look inside. All the problems I had were caused by &#34;fungoid tissue&#34; in two different parts, including the hanging bit. He fixed it in one place and said I will need a revision surgery for the other since it was too deep to access.I had to insist a lot and ask several questions to get information about how much the surgery would cost me. They will do it for free but clinic fee and other expenses will cost around 4000€.
</p>
<p>
I asked if the problem I had was also called granulation tissue and he said yes. Surprise, it was granulation tissue all along and I needed surgery to treat it.
<br>
I asked if it could be treated by silver nitrate and steroid cream, he said that this treatment is for smaller zones and it would be better to treat it with surgery.
<br>
I asked if treating it with silver nitrate and steroid cream would work even if its worse than surgery. He said yes but it will be less efficient than surgery.
</p>
<p>
Why did my surgeon kept giving me diverse explanations and saying everything was okay when it was not?
<br>
Why didn&#39;t he even mention at any point that my problems could have been caused by granulation tissue?
<br>
Why would he let me bleed daily and suffer pain for so long?
<br>
Why didn&#39;t he tell me that a treatment with silver nitrate and steroid cream was viable until I specifically asked about it and even then, didn&#39;t give me straight answers?
<br>
Is &#34;fungoid tissue&#34; even a thing? All google says when I search is stuff about diseases caused by fungus.
</p>
<p>
I see posts about others getting their granulation tissue identified and treated right away, I feel like I&#39;m being ignored by my surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I had the surgery in Spain and the surgeon is Dr. Jesús Lago.
