So I got my bottom surgery done in Montreal in Oct 2018, and my vag, 2 years later, looks almost identical to the way it did just a couple of weeks post op (minus the blood and sutures). It looks like the swelling from surgery never went down.
</p>
<p>
It looks like I have two sets of labia majora, one surrounding the other; a huge amount of extra tissue. I&#39;m not really comfortable wearing swimsuits or tight jeans because of the bulge. It looks like I&#39;m tucking, and poorly at that. Also, all of the visible tissue outside of the vaginal canal is extremely wrinkled and fragile, really gross looking imo. Shaving down there tends to be a bloody, painful undertaking.
</p>
<p>
The vaginal canal tissue is similarly very fragile, though not particularly painful, and dilation/penetrative sex is bloody. Also, when I get aroused, I get a throbbing, almost pinching pain in my vag, I think near my urethra but I&#39;m not sure.
</p>
<p>
The positives are that I&#39;m quite sensitive and have no issues orgasming. Also, I get really, really wet. Like soak through my panties wet, and it has the same smell and consistency as average cis wetness (idk the medical term lol). So technically functional, aside from the fragile bloodyness and the fact that it looks gross.
</p>
<p>
The part that bugs me the most is that the clinic told me for a year that it would get better. It never did. After that, I was told by the clinic that it looks fine, yet it looks exactly the same as it did when they told me it would &#34;get better&#34;. Am I reading too much into this?
</p>
<p>
Revisions may or may not be a possibility, it depends entirely on getting my province to cover it.
</p>
<p>
Any suggestions or insight are greatly appreciated, I&#39;m kinda at the end of my rope.

Hey! So I’ll start off by saying I feel for you and that’s awful to go through something so important and to not have ideal results. I’m not sure where you are located, but Dr Genoway is now performing GRS in Vancouver and does revisions. I was told she trained with some of the best doctors in the states and uses the robot assisted technique for most patients, and she really emphasized how much she wants me to like my results after I have my procedure next year with her. I would strongly recommend getting in contact with trans care to arrange for a revision with her as I believe she’s already done a few revisions for patients who have gone to Montreal. I chose to wait it out instead of going to Montreal for this exact reason, and it kind of annoys me that Montreal seems to have the attitude of you get what you get. I really wish you the best and hope you can receive a revision to help with aesthetics &lt;3 feel free to dm me as well if you have any more questions about the Vancouver program as I’ve already had my consult and am just waiting for a date once I’m done electrolysis!

I’m going to be honest this year has been a blur so I’m having a hard time remembering specifics. Vancouver requires you have electrolysis before surgery and bases your surgical date on when you’ve completed electrolysis and have no regrowth. The nurse told me they aim to give you a date within 5 months of hair removal completion, but that’s not including covid delays. I also won’t have accurate info on the wait time for a consult because I was at the top of Montreal ‘s list for almost two years so when they moved me over to the Vancouver wait list I was right at the top again. I also don’t have a date yet because I’m not done hair removal!

God, I&#39;m scared that&#39;s going to be me.  I had a huge amount of swelling, and everyone said be patient, it will go down.
</p>
<p>
How bad would you say your swelling was initially?
</p>
<p>
Are you willing to dm pictures?
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re screwed.  Better to have tissue to tighten and take away, than not enough

It was pretty huge, though I&#39;m no authority on whats &#34;normal&#34; for this kind of procedure.

<p>
Sorry, I meant to post pics, you can find them here:

And yeah, you&#39;re right. I never really thought about it like that, its just finding funding is going to be a fucking mess, cause my student budget will not cover this, and I wasn&#39;t expecting to even need revisions. (prob very naive of me lol)

Are those pics all recent?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m literally crying right now.  I feel like that&#39;s as good of a result as I could hope for with where I&#39;m at.
</p>
<p>
Yours looks ok, I would trade places with you for sure, but I know what parts you don&#39;t like.
</p>
<p>
This is rather emotionally devastating.  My office keeps telling me the same thing, that it will be fine in a year.  I don&#39;t think it will be, and I think it&#39;s pretty fucked up when they lie to your face about all vaginas looking different.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m regretting this so much right now.

Yeah, taken a couple weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
How long post-op are you? All the work I&#39;ve seen from different surgeons looks rough as fuck a couple weeks-months post, so I&#39;d give it time. Kinda ironic to type that myself, but the sentiment is reasonable imo; you can&#39;t know how it&#39;ll end up until you know. That is, wait until you know they fucked up before you lose sleep over it, and in the meantime, hope for the best.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not defending them btw, just gotta make the best of a shitty situation. Posting here was cathartic for me, just knowing that there are people out there who understand.
</p>
<p>
Sorry if this is unhelpful, I&#39;ve been trying to find a solution to this exact problem and as you can see by my OP, I&#39;m definitely not there yet lol

I appreciate your help.  Commiserating has its place fwiw.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m at six weeks.  I haven&#39;t changed much since my last post.  I am totally trying to give my surgeon the benefit of the doubt bc I think she&#39;s amazing, but the fact they can&#39;t just say I&#39;m going to be fine and mean it? It&#39;s hard, really hard.  The positivity they had before taking off the bolster is gone.
</p>
<p>
And again, I see what parts you don&#39;t like about your vagina, but I still think it looks nice in its own way.

Hi, my wife and I are driving home from San Francisco as I type (she&#39;s driving, lol) .  She is 4 weeks post op after a revision Dr. Wittenberg did for her because she was disappointed with the results she received from Brassard in 2015.  Her new snatch is, well, snatched, lol.  Don&#39;t give up!
