I am 2 weeks post SRS (PI) and i feel and look very bloated, especially in my lower belly.
</p>
<p>
Is this normal? And if so, when does it go back to normal?

Yep it&#39;s normal,  your constipated from pain meds.  And I also retained water that made my legs swell up to nearly double size. It was crazy scary.
</p>
<p>
After an ultrasound to rule out DVT ( blood clot) and Dr. Said it was water I asked what about start taking like 100mg of Spironolactone I still had from earlier in my transition,  plus I stocked up on them even If I took them or not. So I had plenty,  Dr said yes they would shed the water. Plus we sometimes get a hi spike in adrenaline Testosterone after bottom surgery,  it the body&#39;s way of trying to regulate back to what it takes as normal.  The last hurrah so to say.
</p>
<p>
So it helped two birds with one stone.  Gaining weight in legs feet most likely water, feeling bloated tummy and yucky,  constipation.  I took laxatives and still do a couple of times a month.
<br>
Maybe once every other week.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helped. üôè

It was around 3-4 weeks for me but I have gained a slight bit of weight so what was bloating became the usual.
