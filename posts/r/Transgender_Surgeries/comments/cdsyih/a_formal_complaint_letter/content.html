Have you contacted their patient advocates? Some will only work with you if you are currently admitted, depends on the hospital. Look over all the hospital&#39;s web and patient material and find out specifically how to file a complaint. If you can afford to have an attorney do it, you will be miles ahead of the game right out of the box. I&#39;m not suggesting you make any claims to sue them, but the moment shit hits the fan and there&#39;s a real problem, they could easily become non-responsive. That&#39;s typically the first line of defense.

EDIT---

<p>
You also might want to read the Informed Consent form you probably signed not thinking twice. They can be a serious dose of the reality of how fucked you are in terms of recourse. Especially if you&#39;re in a teaching hospital.

They say stuff like this:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I understand that the practice of medicine is not an exact science, that it may involve the making of medical
</p>
<p>
judgments based upon the facts known to the physician at the time, that
<strong>
<em>
it is not reasonable to expect the
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
the
</em>
</strong>
<strong>
<em>
physician to be able to anticipate nor explain all risks and complications, that an undesirable result does not necessarily indicate an error in judgment, and that no guarantee as to results have been made to nor relied upon by me.
</em>
</strong>
I wish to rely on the physician to exercise judgment during the course of the procedure and make the determinations that, at the time, based upon the facts then known, are in my best interest.
</p>
<p>
I have also been advised that there are other risks, including but not limited to severe loss of blood, infection,
</p>
<p>
injury, scarring, cardiac arrest, and death that are attendant on the performance of any procedure, and that
</p>
<p>
during or after the procedure such treatments as blood transfusions may become necessary.
<strong>
<em>
I understand that a bad outcome does not mean care was not appropriate.
</em>
</strong>
Other risks may include, but are not limited to:

Along those lines, any hint from you in a letter of pursuing legal action and they will likely only communicate through their attorneys from then on.

Also, if you seek a revision, a surgeon may be hesitant to operate on you if they find out you’re pursuing legal action. It ends up being a lot of liability for them.

There is no legal action involve, its just a complaint letter that I would be sent to the Director of the department.

THIS.
</p>
<p>
Whatever you do, don&#39;t go off ranting about how you&#39;re going to sue them for whatever happened.  Do not threaten them with legal action unless you&#39;ve done your homework and understand what that entails. It varies wildly by state. It&#39;s basically a conversation ender.
</p>
<p>
Stay calm, work with what you have and maintain open dialog. I&#39;m not suggesting you&#39;ll get anything resolved this way, if they really messed up and know it. Remember, they are under no obligation to disclose shoddy craftsmanship that may be painfully obvious to you and everyone else.

Thank you, for the comment but its only a complaint not a legal action against them. I am not that wealthy to pursue any legal action against the doctor.

Oh I totally understand. But even in a complaint letter sent by someone who feels hurt and unheard can make complaints the provider may see as a potential legal problem. Most Drs. are risk-averse and take it very seriously. Other&#39;s may ghost you at the first sign of trouble.
</p>
<p>
Few people are wealthy enough to fund a malpractice claim. This is why malpractice actions are typically done on a contingency basis with the law firm footing the initial cost. Even a small medical malpractice case takes phenomenal resources and time. Only about 14% of those cases are won by the plaintiff. That say&#39;s nothing about the claims that were settled privately, however.

I&#39;m so sorry that you are dealing with this! That sounds really awful. What are you hoping to accomplish with your complaint?

I&#39;m hoping for the institution to take my concern seriously, so no other trans patient would experienced my concerns or frustrations.
