Not that it matters after having the surgery, but that looks like a hairline incision.

You’re right about that. It’s right along my hairline. I thought they were the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, at 2 weeks all my scabbing in the front had flaked off and the scar is a pale pink. Still a little lumpy, but not very noticeable.

Oh 2 weeks - you made it just in time before all the craziness and cancellations! The lumpiness will get better with time!

It’s okay... I was really excited to be alone and on my own. Now all my roommates are here with me and being on leave doesn’t feel as special. I was also really excited to go thrifting and find some additions to my wardrobe, but that’s out of the question now.

Just thought it was interesting and wanted to show it off. If the hair loss isn&#39;t from them shaving a little strip, then I think I have some shock hair loss coming up around the incision. Either way it&#39;s completely hidden by my hair.

Thank you! I think he did a pretty aggressive reduction on my chin and jaw and they’re still pretty swollen and undefined. I may eventually post pictures of the results, but I want to wait until I can see the results... they’re currently very undefined and poofy.

Like

said, you seem to be healing very well. At over 3 months postop I still have a little scabbing and a swollen jaw.

Shit. My jaw is so swollen. Honestly, everything is still swollen. I can feel my forehead swell up when I eat... I can&#39;t wait until summer ends. It may be better by then. hahaha

The forehead swelling was what subsided fastest for me, but there is still slight numbness at 3 months. The jaw part is probably the worst, thought. It takes ages...

Did this make any difference to your hairline though? I had the same procedure (with the same Dr!) and I find that it didn&#39;t really do much, it just made the shape of my hairline weirder

It&#39;s a little lower and a little thicker in the front. It&#39;s hard to tell at this point because the hair in that area is consistently greasy with silicone cream... But I believe it would be perfect if I filled in the areas above my temples
</p>
<p>
The combination of hairline lowering with my eyebrow lift definitely pulled the wrinkles out of my forehead. I wasn&#39;t expecting it. They&#39;ve been there for as long as I can remember and now I can&#39;t tell where they used to be.

Looking at it, it probably came down almost an inch front and center. But it&#39;s hard to tell since there&#39;s a gap in feeling where part of my forehead/scalp was removed. I don&#39;t believe scalp advancement is meant to give you a final stage hairline. I think it&#39;s meant to be paired with transplants.

I think you&#39;re right - I want to get transplants but I&#39;m not sure I can deal with the recovery; it&#39;s a year+ of having a super super fucked hairline where like, the filled areas are sticking straight out of your head :(

I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m into it either. I heard it&#39;s kinda messy with naturally curly hair, since they aren&#39;t always the same grain or direction as the hairs around them...

Following up, the hairline lowering did fuck-all and now I just have a weirder hairline. The tension did get rid of wrinkles in my forehead though. Scalp advancement was the one procedure that wasn’t covered by insurance. Glad I took care of that! Haha

He has amazing bedside manner. Very good at reading people and listening to what you&#39;re concerned or worried about. He&#39;s really good at making you feel comfortable, even right before surgery. His office hires a nurse to sit next to you all night when you stay over in the hospital. His skills are good, but he doesn&#39;t post before/after photos on the internet. The only downside is he&#39;s very very expensive and doesn&#39;t bill insurance. It&#39;s cash up front, then they&#39;ll submit the claim so the patient gets reimbursed. That takes around 4 months...

Well quality is always expensive. I think it is good that he doesn&#39;t put before and after online which mean he ain&#39;t desperate and does not mislead people. If I was in the US I would have gone to him too or Harrison Lee.

Totally. I went to him because of the assurance that my grill wouldn&#39;t get fucked up (and it didn&#39;t). It seems like he tries to stay exclusive. Some people think it&#39;s cocky, but he sold me...
