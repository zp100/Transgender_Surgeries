Hey,
</p>
<p>
Long post incoming!
</p>
<p>
Just had my consultation with Dr. Noorman, and I&#39;m writing this post mostly for myself to sort out my thoughts, but also for others looking for alternative FFS surgeons in Europe, seeing as we have so little choice every bit of information helps.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TLDR at the bottom.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
So the consultation was 1 hour and I had to pay 50 € for it. before consultation I had to fill in a form of varying details about exercise, previous facial procedures etc. In addition to that I sent in pictures of frontal (neutral, slight smile, open smile) 45 degrees, and 90 degree profile pictures in both directions.
</p>
<p>
It starts off with him asking my preferred language, apparently he speaks a number of languages, and we settled on English (which he spoke decently, but had difficulties occasionally).
</p>
<p>
Most of the session we talked about the three areas I had highlighted as my main concern, which he agreed would give the biggest bang for buck.(forehead, orbital rims and rhinoplasty) He went into great detail how he would perform the surgeries in a way no other surgeon I&#39;ve talked to have. He showed me pictures of the anatomy and what he would do in my particular case. This was about 70% of the consultation.
</p>
<p>
A few key values he expressed repeatedly during the consultation was :
</p>
<p>
- that he hates scars, how they affect a person&#39;s subconscious judgement of you in a similar way to masculine features, (and thus recommended going with a coronal approach to forehead rather than at the hairline, similar to facial team) Although different from them he would perform the incision ~2 cm into the hair, and not as far back as FT.
</p>
<p>
- Highlighted the importance of how shadows and lights fall on the face in determining sex, as well as forehead to nose curvature, orbital rim to cheek curve.
</p>
<p>
- how his primary goal was to achieve a result harmonious with my facial type, rather than a one-fits-all approach. (I want to stress that he repeated and emphasized this many times and I really believe he means it). He showed me before and after pictures not available online of recent patients and from those pictures I believe him, he doesn&#39;t default to the upturned button nose you see so often, on some of them they keep a slight bump or downturned tip, but they were most definitely feminized and according to me was fitting for the patient. This is preferred for me because i want to retain a slight bump and angularity in my nose, just make it smaller and fix a few other issues.
</p>
<p>
The &#34;other issues&#34; that I brought up were difficulty breathing through nose, crookedness and a cartilage unsymmetrically protruding on the left side of my nose tip. He explained why I have these issues and explained how these would be fixed during the surgery.
</p>
<p>
He does take Xray to analyze how to work with the forehead, and when doing a type 3 he uses (if i understood correctly) my own bone tissue instead of bone cement. I failed to ask why unfortunately. He also uses two tiny screws to anchor it in place at the very end of the orbital rim when reattaching it, not a mesh net I&#39;ve seen others have.
</p>
<p>
He said he will be drawing on my photo to display his suggested changes, and we can discuss from there what I prefer. (this appears to be free of charge)
</p>
<p>
When I asked for revision rate (% of people who come back for revision) he either misunderstood me or did not answer directly, because I didn&#39;t get a %. However he said when doing a revision he does not charge, so the surgeon fee is 0, but you&#39;d have to pay for hospital, anesthesiologist etc. He mentioned people come back for revision sometimes because they are unhappy with the degree of changes he makes, saying they want a smaller nose etc. than what he gives them. This I feel is quite expected. He also mentioned you sign a consent contract detailing exactly what to expect for what you pay for, so what to expect should be in writing before the surgery takes place.
</p>
<p>
When discussing facial harmony he made a remark that I feel is worth noting. &#34;I don&#39;t want to create drag queens&#34;. I think the intent was to highlight that people connect drag queens with overly feminized features such as overfilled cheeks/lips, obviously surgically altered noses etc on a bulky facial frame, and this is something he wants to avoid.
</p>
<p>
He also talks, a lot. especially when it comes to the details of the surgery. He shows plenty of examples and is not afraid of talking technically with you. It really felt like he wanted to educate me, he casually brought up pictures of forehead surgeries where the entire upper skull was exposed. I have already viewed YouTube videos of these kind of surgeries, so I wasn&#39;t very affected, but it could definitely trigger some people. And I realized about 30 minutes into the call
<strong>
to not be afraid of interrupting him&#34;
</strong>
he quickly shuts up and listens to what you want, if you have a question he will accommodate it immediately without taking offense. However if you don&#39;t interrupt him he will go through his own plan.
</p>
<p>
Some other remarks we didn&#39;t delve into detail on:
</p>
<p>
- Financial aid: Tries to offer it for Belgian patients, but so far impossible for medical tourists.
</p>
<p>
- He puts you in &#34;high care&#34; whatever that means &#34;because of the nasal packing&#34;. and wanted you to stay there for 4-5 days for care and checkup after the surgery.
</p>
<p>
- Does not operate every day at the moment due to hospital capacity (covid) so scheduling a surgery will have to adapt to when I am allowed to come to them. In that regard I got the feeling they can be accommodating.
</p>
<p>
- he confirmed his connection I mentioned in my last thread to Dr. Daniel Simon, (cofounder of Facial Team) in fact Dr. Simon was a student of Dr Noorman. At the same time he mentioned he had been practicing for as long as Dr. Ousterhout.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
My overall feeling
</strong>
of him is: He appears damn energetic and passionate about the technicality and &#34;art&#34; of FFS, the before-after pictures he
<em>
shows
</em>
are all harmonious and feminized compared to the before pictures. He understands quickly what needs to be done and does neither oversell or undersell.  I would have liked him to pause a bit more to ask questions and listen to me more, but as soon as I interrupted him he listened, and because I don&#39;t have a problem being a little bit forceful this should not be a big problem for me.
</p>
<p>
I was not brave enough to confront him directly about the so called blacklisting, so I&#39;ll try to do it per email. If I get a response I will update this post.
</p>
<p>
For me this doctor is definitely worth exploring more and might be perfect for me since my budget does not allow me to go for FT or Inglefield, but I would still like my surgery with a qualified craniomaxillofacial surgeon with tons of experience and good results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TLDR:
</strong>
Energetic, passionate, very very experienced and technically minded. Talks a lot so you need to interrupt him for questions but he doesn&#39;t mind. Does coronal forehead approach. Was the teacher of one of the most renowned FFS surgeons in the world (Dr. Daniel Simon). Has a &#34;conservative&#34; approach, goal is for harmonious face, not Hollywoodization. Uses Xray for forehead, does not go in blind as some surgeons do. Language and mindset is well intentioned, but maybe a bit outdated. Hates scars. English is decent, but will stumble over words and miscommunication may happen.
</p>
<p>
Overall a good consultation, my gut feeling is giving me the thumbs up for this one. Now I&#39;m waiting for the quote and will update this post once I get it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Last but not least
</strong>
: I may be wrong about aspects in this post - it was an hour of quickfire questions and answers and notes being taken while trying to follow along, some of it may be incorrect or misquoted. I also included a lot of my personal opinions, which may be completely different to your own. Do your own research if you intend to put your face in his hands.

I highly appreciate your post, simply bc I live in Belgium and plan to have FFS in the future. Yes the amount of info about Dr. Noorman is far from adequate, and every time someone mentions Belgium, they usually refer to the bad reputation of Bart for FFS.  Definitely looking forward to further updates ❤️

It&#39;s sounds almost too good to be true. I&#39;m sorry if I glossed over this detail by accident but was this an E- consultation?
