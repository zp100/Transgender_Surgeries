I knew I spoke too soon in my last update saying granulation might be gone.  By my 8-4 gyn visit it had grown out again and needed to be trimmed, but she said the diameter of it was much smaller and it wasn&#39;t too long.  On 8-25 I hadn&#39;t seen blood on my pads for a couple weeks and thought again it was gone but it had grown out a bit longer than before, so we&#39;re trying to treat it every week or two and no idea when it will heal permanently.  She feels it may be growing more because I&#39;m sizing up my dilator but she encourages me to keep at that.
</p>
<p>
I kept trying to go with the surgeon&#39;s advice of only sizing up the dilator when the current size was easy and painless to insert, but after over a year that&#39;s never been the case so at PT&#39;s advice I started sizing up as long as it didn&#39;t hurt more than 2/10 and back off pressure till the pain fades.  So on 7-28 I started using larger purple instead of orange dilator first, then blue.  By 7-31 I used the teal (1 3/8&#34; diameter) after the two smaller and pressed it as deep as it could fit comfortably within 15 mins.
</p>
<p>
I think I pushed the purple too hard keeping it at full depth.  It was causing a significant ache after awhile and I should have gone back to starting with orange for awhile.  I got some blood on my pad the next day or two and at 8-3 PT visit she felt a new &#34;string&#34; of tissue on the right side a few inches in.  It hurt for her to rub over it and it&#39;s an area that always hurt a bit with the dilator as well.  Next day the gyn said it looked like a band of red, almost the color of granulation but not actually granulation.  She suspected it had been bleeding in previous days and said it might heal better with silver nitrate treatment but wasn&#39;t certain so I decided not to have it treated.
</p>
<p>
I was more gentle with dilation after that but as things felt better, I decided to try the largest orange (1.5&#34; diameter) dilator that Soul Source sells in place of the teal.  It actually got to a couple dots visible the first time.  The next day, PT said the &#34;string&#34; felt softer and less painful to touch.  I said that I&#39;d pushed the purple too hard and it seemed to irritate my bladder, making me feel I needed to pee when I didn&#39;t.  She suggested finding a straight dilator instead of the ones with a slight curve and recommended
<a href="https://www.smeincusa.com/syracuse-medical-vaginal-dilators?quantity=1&amp;custcol1=178">Syracuse Medical
</a>
and
<a href="https://hopeandher.com/products/vaginal-insert-set">Hope and Her
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, neither one was long enough.  I didn&#39;t spend more time searching and instead tried her second suggestion which was to pull the flat end of the dilator towards me so the deep end put less upward pressure towards the bladder.  This worked remarkably well for reducing pain/irritation and also seemed to make keeping it full depth a little easier.  There is always a spot at full depth towards the top that gets irritated after pushing the dilator against it for long enough and I think it swells so it feels like dilator is catching on it when I remove it.  With the new angle this area gets less irritated, but there&#39;s still usually pain on removal.
</p>
<p>
By the 8-25 gyn visit she said the &#34;string&#34; area no longer looked red, so that was a relief.  Since then the purple is getting slowly easier to keep at full depth and with 15 mins of blue I usually have it at full depth around 5 mins.  I&#39;ve had the orange to one dot barely visible, around an inch from full depth, but some nights it won&#39;t go in that far.
</p>
<p>
All of this stretching has made my granulation treatments much more pleasant.  Last visit I felt only a moment of small pain as she inserted the speculum and there&#39;s no longer a constant edge of pain feeling when she has it spread open.  I&#39;m really confused why she can insert it almost painlessly but when I dilate there&#39;s still a 1-2 pain during insertion and I always use the dilator tip to stretch the area right before the painful part down left for 60 secs and down right for 60 secs before applying pressure to insert it, which tends to take another minute to get past the tightness without much pain.  Yet the gyn just goes right in without stretching.  My only theory is that my body tolerates something wide being inserted more than something round.  I also wonder if having my legs in stirrups makes a difference.  Just having my knees up doesn&#39;t seem to help because the PT&#39;s finger always hurts almost as much as my dilator (but her finger is smaller so it hurts less).  Gyn&#39;s finger seems to go in more easily and the only obvious difference is having feet at 90 degrees to ankles instead of flat on the bed.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I finally found the time/mood to masturbate and was surprised to find the vibrator slid in pretty easily with minimal soreness while I was swollen with arousal.  Last time I did that (2 months ago?) it took a long time to get past the first inch and like 15 mins to get it deep enough to touch my prostate.  This time I was touching prostate within a couple mins and soon sliding it in and out without pain or restriction soon after.  It felt really good to have made so much progress after so much time feeling stuck.  I finally feel I might be able to accept my partner inside sometime soon, though both of our sex drives are so low that we&#39;re in no hurry.
</p>
<p>
My clit has been good and I rarely feel like it&#39;s starting to turn right, nor has it gone full right since the last time I reported that.  I still carefully straighten it before I lay on my side to sleep because I think having it pulled straight all night is very slowly straightening things.  I massage labia every other day and those nights I sleep with one pillow between my knees.  Other nights I try to sleep with just a blanket between knees.  This has gotten my clit/labia used to being fully compressed and I can ever sit with my legs crossed comfortably, though it still hurts my knees a bit (thighs are too thick, I think).
</p>
<p>
I realized I&#39;m rarely worried about pain when I sit anymore.  I tend to not notice any unless I think about it, and then it&#39;s pretty faint.  I still use the twin cheeks cushion in the car though I probably don&#39;t have to.  If I&#39;m getting in or out of the car such that labia presses directly on one side of the cushion, it does still hurt around a 1/10.  Same thing when I sit on my bed, but usually not when I sit on a normal chair.  I haven&#39;t felt pain cleaning labia in the shower for months, yet I still flinch when docs rub or stretch labia, and a bit when my SO touches them.  A few days ago it hurt 2-3/10 for the electrologist to rub numbing cream off my labia, but the rest of the time when she was stretching them various ways to get hairs it was near painless (unlike previous visits).  So it&#39;s really weird how the initial touch hurts and then stops hurting.
</p>
<p>
Labia massage still hurts a bit in places but when I put legs together to sleep there&#39;s rarely pain.  So that&#39;s all been really nice.  A bump at top left of labia has been slowly reducing in size as well.
</p>
<p>
A couple weeks ago I reduced gabapentin dose from 600mg per day to 300, and this week I&#39;m taking 300mg every other day and I&#39;ll be done with the pills at the end of next week.  I haven&#39;t noticed any change in pain levels so far.
</p>
<p>
Every two nights I also use the purple dilator tip to rub up and down over each painful spot inside for 60 strokes.  Generally I target 5 spots, 3 near entrance, the &#34;string&#34;, and the roof at the deepest point where bladder irritation can occur.  I&#39;ve felt improvements from this but it&#39;s verrrrry slow.
</p>
<p>
In the last couple months I&#39;ve noticed significant breast growth.  This may correspond to switching from injected estrogen to oral, and then from 4mg per day to 6mg.  I&#39;m bulging over one bra that used to be slightly loose and my areola seem a bit bigger and the area around them is sticking out a bit farther than the rest of the breast which I think tends to be how breasts get bigger during puberty (could be wrong).  I hope they fill out because the shape is a little odd right now.  I got a 42 AAA Zuri push up bra from
<a href="https://lulalu.com">lulalu.com
</a>
and almost have vague cleavage, finally.  Still wish they were much bigger but we&#39;ll see what happens.  I&#39;m pretty against getting implants because I don&#39;t want another surgery, more scars, and I don&#39;t think the implants feel natural when touched.  Might get fat transfer someday but it&#39;s really expensive and I also fear all the scars it may leave.  So don&#39;t give up!  It helps to get rid of the source of testosterone with surgery.

The color of everything has maaaybe evened out a bit more since my last update and labia definitely feel thicker with less crinkle and shine.  Basically, they feel more like touching normal skin now.  I&#39;ve taken to putting a third tiny amount of the estrogen cream between my labia where the skin was feeling thin and that seems to be helping as well.  The last few weeks the scar on the left labia and sometimes the right labia itches for a bit every few days.  Maybe it&#39;s a new stage of healing?
</p>
<p>
Labia pain is mostly a thing of the past.  I went to an amusement park a week ago and none of the seats or movements hurt.  It only hurt a little when I sat sideways on a round handrailing with most of the pressure directly on the labia, but I just had to shift my position a bit.  I&#39;ve also been using an exercise bike at home without pain, though it&#39;s a wide seat and it&#39;s mildly uncomfortable if I don&#39;t slide a little forward on it.  I&#39;ve been wearing all my old tighter panties again and I get that same slight discomfort after extended wear but I just pull the panties away a bit and the irritation goes away.
</p>
<p>
There are still spots that hurt when doing my bi-nightly labia massage.  The pain level and spots that hurt seem to significantly each time but it&#39;s never more than a 2/10.  When my SO or the gyn touch me down there it still usually hurts slightly on first touch but at like a 0.5/10 and it quickly fades.  The pain I get from having labia manipulated during electrolysis is definitely minimal at this point and much less than a few months ago.  Hair regrowth has also been minimal.
</p>
<p>
My clit turning sideways is still a problem that plagues me every time I put pressure on my loins for an extended period.  I sat a lot during the holidays and for 3 days once I got home my clit was sideways almost every time I checked.  Maybe it was the same during the holidays but I was around others so I mostly only checked before bed, but it was fine then.  At least it always goes back to normal when I fix it regularly, but recently even a day trip in the car can throw it off the next day.  I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s because of the tighter panties and exercise bike increasing swelling?
</p>
<p>
On 11-26-22 I made a great discovery.  I&#39;ve been doing my internal massages in quadrants, rubbing the dilator tip up and down over the deepest part the canal, gradually rotating it back and forth to cover one quarter of the canal for 60 total strokes.  Once I&#39;ve done all 4 quadrants of the deepest part, I do 4 quadrants of the upper part of the canal using longer strokes up and down because it isn&#39;t so tight.  For some reason, on this night doing this rubbing felt really good.  I&#39;ve heard some say putting a dilator in felt really good the first time they did it but it never did much for me until now.  After I finished 60 strokes in 4 quadrants I went on stroking and with the aid of a video I had a climax in maybe 4 mins or less.  This is far faster that it usually takes me and I only briefly touched my clit and didn&#39;t use a vibrator.
</p>
<p>
I repeated these quick orgasms two more times over the next few weeks and could climax without even touching my clit, so it wasn&#39;t a fluke of my mood or of not having masturbated for a long time.  A 4th time I tried to use a more slender dilator to just masturbate without stretching, but its pointy tip kept catching things and hurting so I switched to a thicker one but still one size down from the one I always use for massage.  That helped but still wasn&#39;t feeling that great until I started applying pressure on the upper wall (towards my belly, away from the prostate, surprisingly) with the tip.  I was still being distracted by other things and had to give up after awhile for fear of hurting myself, but it still felt nice.  It also makes me happy because it gives me hope of having an orgasm with a partner as long as they get the angle right.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also discovered that holding my knees closer together and leaning forward when I pee makes the pee go more consistently downward.  It&#39;s still common for it not to go off to the side at some point, but at least it&#39;s an improvement.  I&#39;ve also taken to widening my knees when washing with the bidet to let the water go directly against my clit and the urethra.  This has helped me smell better and hasn&#39;t caused any bladder infections from the water squirting up the urethra, but I keep the water pressure on minimum.
</p>
<p>
My gyn visits for granulation have been up and down, occasionally needing to snip out a bit of tissue growth but the last 3 visits have been small areas needing only silver nitrate.  She feels like we&#39;re making progress and my internal massages are helping the area of granulation even out with the rest of the canal instead of being behind a ridge of tight skin.  I&#39;m also getting much less pain when she inserts the speculum or stretches it open.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also had the gyn testing my pH with
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076J14CSL/">these
</a>
test strips touching as deep in the canal as possible before she gets lube up there and after I&#39;ve washed out lube with a douche the night before.  The first test returned a very clear 5.1 pH which had me excited but subsequent tests don&#39;t match the color chart well:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/g4diujwmpjaa1.png?width=1432&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f063367cb758f823724169842b064d067ee65c27">https://preview.redd.it/g4diujwmpjaa1.png?width=1432&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f063367cb758f823724169842b064d067ee65c27
</a>
</p>
<p>
The middle test looks desaturated compared to the color guide so I copied 3 spots of the original color over the key and duplicated those spots to the right with raised saturation.  The higher saturation color seems to fit around 5.5 and I feel that&#39;s more likely to be accurate but I can&#39;t be sure.  Any scientists out there have an opinion?  I&#39;m thinking bacteria or old lube might be tinting the color so I&#39;m going to try using a thin shower nozzle to really clean myself out before my next test.
</p>
<p>
To test the accuracy of the test strips, I got
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X3TKTBC">these
</a>
pH buffer powders and mixed them with 250mL distilled water in a plastic container at 16.1C (which I used to adjust the pH according to a chart that came with the kit) to get the two readings on the right.  The listing says to use distilled water but the packets say use deionized water which is like distilled water with trace minerals filtered out, and it says to use a clean glass beaker which I don&#39;t have, and it says to let the powder dissolve completely but no amount of stirring and waiting could get the bigger chunks to dissolve, so all of that might affect the accuracy a bit, but probably not much. Either way, I thought the colors matched the scale pretty well, though the 6.9 test looks a bit darker than the 7.0 key.
</p>
<p>
However the tests are interpreted, I think it&#39;s likely my pH tends to vary below 6 which is better than the neutral 7 you&#39;d expect from a penile inversion and it means less bacterial growth.  But it isn&#39;t as good as a cis vagina where normal is below 4.4.
</p>
<p>
My other big news is that I&#39;ve stretched my opening to about 2.4 inch diameter!  I hope that by stretching so wide, I&#39;ll eventually be able to take a phallus-sized object without pre-stretching.  Not long after my last update, I got the 1.5&#34; diameter Soul Source orange dilator to full depth.  After that I couldn&#39;t find any traditional dilators bigger than 1.5 inch.  I bought
<a href="https://www.drsherry.com/products/advanced-wearable-vaginal-dilators">She-ology Advanced Wearable Dilators
</a>
which claim to be 1.28&#34;, 1.75&#34;, and 1.93&#34; without specifying if that means diameter or what.  In reality, the actual width of each base is 1.26&#34;, 1.56&#34;, and 1.86&#34;, while the largest base is 1.93&#34; front to back (in other words, the base is an oval).  The measurement of the medium one is so far off what they advertise, it&#39;s no larger than the largest Soul Source.  Even the largest one isn&#39;t very useful because it tapers down so quickly, so you&#39;re only stretching a short portion of your entry above 1.5&#34;.  Because they&#39;re so tapered, they strongly push out of you so you need to hold it in because the pressure of panties isn&#39;t going to keep the 1.86&#34; part inside.
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, while looking up items for this post I found these
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Silicone-Dilator-Exerciser-Trainer-Technology/dp/B0B94MNTPB/">VWELL super fit dilators
</a>
that reach 2.3&#34; diameter and may actually be long enough for full depth.  There are no reviews yet so I think they&#39;re a new product.  VWELL&#39;s
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MT4VWGX">smaller dilators
</a>
have a lot of positive reviews but one person said they had a bad chemical smell while another says &#34;My husband does work in china so he did some research and actually got in touch with VWELLL&#39;s manufacturer and they admitted they do not use medical grade silicone for this product&#34;.  I bought those small dilators myself awhile back but never used them since since they lack depth markings.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I used one last night the same thickness as the Soul Source dilator I normally start with and it stung a bit after prolonged use and caused visible blood in my lubricant despite using more lube than I usually do.  The problem is they have a matte surface with a slightly rough texture and because it&#39;s soft plastic I&#39;m not sure if it can be smoothed.  I saw another reviewer say &#34;The material used can be a bit rough without enough lubricant used - but quite nice when slippery&#34; so I don&#39;t think the roughness was a bad batch and I think the neovag is just too tight for any roughness not to cause damage regardless of lubricant.   The larger dilators do show more glossiness than the smaller ones, so they might be smoother but the images look computer generated so I don&#39;t think that means much.  So I wouldn&#39;t trust that the materials are body safe but if they&#39;ve fixed the roughness problem, they might be an option to see how large you want to go and then buy a skin-safe silicone dildo to use long term.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I found this
<a href="https://bad-dragon.com/products/mystic">&#34;Mystic&#34; dildo
</a>
made out of skin-safe silicone in the USA from a company I&#39;ve purchased from for years:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/1tfu423e36aa1.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=367c397a7af1cdd1da8299822676de033026ab9b">https://preview.redd.it/1tfu423e36aa1.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=367c397a7af1cdd1da8299822676de033026ab9b
</a>
</p>
<p>
I added white lines to the image where my full depth is.  The lines measure 1.5&#34;, 2.14&#34;, and 2.5&#34;.  The blue, medium size Mystic is a much bigger step up in size than the difference between each hard dilator size, but the small version of Mystic is too small.  Despite the big jump, Mystic is soft and will compress significantly, so the jump is a little less than it appears.  I had it in to around the equivalent of two dots on the orange dilator visible on my first use on 10-21, and by 11-16 I was within an inch of having blue at full depth!
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the hard blue and orange dilators I start with were getting easier to reach full depth, usually less than a minute these days, and they were needing less pressure to keep at full depth.  The painful and tight area near my entry has mostly disappeared, presumably due to stretching and rubbing on it with a dilator tip every other day.  My PT felt the difference too, feeling little resistance getting her finger in.  We decided that my massage work and dilating at home was doing a lot more than my 30 mins with her every couple weeks so my last visit was 12-16.  I&#39;ll miss our conversations.
</p>
<p>
I used the &#34;actual size&#34; tool on the dildo website and overlaid each dildo size in the graphic below, plus I superimposed a photo of the orange dilator:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/nhp7icov56aa1.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58dece8f90ab69f68dbd0f7ac7bfea636bdeed79">https://preview.redd.it/nhp7icov56aa1.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58dece8f90ab69f68dbd0f7ac7bfea636bdeed79
</a>
</p>
<p>
Purple is the small Mystic size, yellow is medium, cyan is large, blue is extra large.  The small purple is actually thinner than the orange towards the end and its usable length doesn&#39;t reach my full depth.  I wish Mystic didn&#39;t have the spiral indent in it that makes it a bit harder to clean, but I used the actual size tool to look at all their other vaguely-conical dildos and none get as large as Mystic or widen out as quickly.
</p>
<p>
Mystic in medium size is rare to find in stock, but they generally put out new stock every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at noon PST so I soon found a medium in medium firmness and ordered it. I found that my paint pen will not stick to it but I found a particular pattern in the blue and white marbling indicating where full depth is.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to move up to the large Mystic but it was never in stock so I had to custom order it.  They generally open custom orders the first Fri of each month, but you have to subscribe to their mailing list and check your mail each morning because they don&#39;t announce their custom orders till around 8am the day they happen.  They unexpectedly opened Dec orders on Black Fri, I guess to have more time to process them before xmas.  I ordered in Nov and the custom order queue filled up and closed after about 2 hours.  Custom orders take 4-6 weeks to process but actually aren&#39;t more expensive than in-stock items, though you can occasionally find in-stock &#34;flops&#34; that are a bit cheaper and just have cosmetic issues.
</p>
<p>
My large purple/white Mystic was ordered in &#34;firm&#34; firmness, as firm as they make them, and I do prefer that firmness over the &#34;medium&#34; firmness.  With medium, it feels more like you&#39;re expanding the end of the dildo a lot with the force needed to push it deeper, and that makes it harder to gauge how deep it actually is.  Unfortunately, &#34;firm&#34; medium Mystics rarely appear in stock, though I&#39;ve seen them once.  I now have the large Mystic to around 2 inches from full depth.  I remain undecided if I should move to the XL Mystic at some point.  Unfortunately with the XL, they won&#39;t do &#34;firm&#34; firmness.  Also, I cut both my Mystics with a sharp knife to make them around the same length as the hard dildos.  That makes them lighter and easier to push in with fingers on the bottom.

Mystic is a pretty expensive dildo so I did search awhile for other options first.  I didn&#39;t really want a human-shaped dildo soI found
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09QL7X77W/">this
</a>
conical one that seems a decent size.  Unfortunately a review says the advertised size is a lie.  I might have tried it anyway but most of the cheap dildos have reviews complaining of skin irritation or chemical burns.  Body-safe silicone is an expensive substance so you&#39;re not gonna find a big dildo under $60-$100 because the material cost is around
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Skin-Making-Silicone-Rubber/dp/B00SK4B9IA/">$40 for 2 pounds
</a>
(maybe $30 in bulk wholesale?) because the curing agent contains platinum.  Medium Mystic weighs 1.56 lbs while large weighs 2.56 lbs.
</p>
<p>
Having an unknown material in contact with mucus skin daily is not okay with me, so I went with a company that is well known, molds their own products in the USA, and I also have some of their products that are years old and show no degradation.  If you&#39;d rather go with a big human phallus, you can probably find that cheaper somewhere but I&#39;d suggest finding a site dedicated to making them in silicone and make sure they&#39;re reputable.

A few months ago someone suggested this soft plastic douche nozzle (A in the pic below) so I tried it and it was terrible.  So I got into testing other douche nozzles.  TL;DR I still recommend E in the long term, D during earlier stages of healing, or B if you love the plus shape:
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
A:
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FLGV95T">Vaginal Cleansing System
</a>
</p>
<p>
This one made me bleed and left my canal stinging for at least 30 mins.  The slightly soft tip makes it seem safe but if you run your finger over the holes, they feel rough.  Most douche nozzles have the holes recessed in a valley but this nozzle puts the holes on the widest part of the nozzle so they press as hard as possible against your skin.  That means the holes scrape along your whole canal, and since we tend to be more tight than cis girls, that&#39;s really bad.  It felt alright going in but when I started pumping in douche fluid it started stinging and got worse till I was rushing to finish.  I suspect it scratched along my canal and the slight hydrogen peroxide of the douche got into the cuts and stung.  There was blood in 3 of the holes when I pulled it out (it looked a bit worse before I managed to get the attached picture of it).  I consider this one dangerous because it will cut you and those who are more early post-op will not be able to feel the cuts and will assume blood in the holes is natural from the surgery.
</p>
<p>
B:
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B008DEZEZQ">HealthAndYoga Enema Kit
</a>
</p>
<p>
Not the most convenient kit for douching but you can take the nozzle and use it with most other systems.  This one can hurt slightly to insert due to its odd shape but it didn&#39;t cause me any lasting pain or stinging.  One hole had pink in it and there was slight stinging for a few mins after removal.  I think the holes may be too close to your skin because they&#39;re on the sides of the plus shape instead of in the deepest part of the valley.  Unlike A, C, and D, this nozzle didn&#39;t require any smoothing with fine sandpaper to remove roughness before use, though I bought this kit years ago and quality may have gone down since then.
</p>
<p>
C:
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N7VJMBF/">Flents Douche Kit
</a>
</p>
<p>
This one needed a lot of work to make fully smooth but the plastic is so soft I just scraped at it with my fingernail to smooth it!  There seems to be a thin coating on it that will be scraped off during this process and so I doubt the plastic is really skin safe.  I don&#39;t recommend it for that reason alone and the balloon-bag that comes with this kit will also fail within a few months.  But the way the holes are recessed, they didn&#39;t pick up any pink and didn&#39;t leave any sting when done.
</p>
<p>
D:
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08VHH2QG2">Korisen Multi-Functional Douche Bottle
</a>
</p>
<p>
I thought the amount the holes are recessed on this one would be too minimal but they actually didn&#39;t catch any obvious discharge.  I had to spend 30 mins with P800 sandpaper removing roughness from this one because it seemed like it was molded in two halves that weren&#39;t exactly aligned.  The ball at the end helps it go in with less pain then any other nozzle, but the ball also forms a plug such that not much douche fluid is going to get past it and deeper into your vag.  It might still be fine if the ball was at full depth but it would need to be almost twice as long for that and it&#39;s probably uncomfortable to try to mash something to full depth while standing.  But since the ball is more comfortable than any of the other options, I do suggest this one for those recently out of surgery.  I don&#39;t recommend using the bottle this nozzle comes with because cramming the bottle against your belly to get the nozzle as deep as possible pulls the nozzle towards your belly which may strain things and caused me to ache for a bit after removal.
</p>
<p>
E:
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0778NCB8C">Bathmate Hydro Rocket
</a>
</p>
<p>
This is what I&#39;ve mostly been using since a few months after surgery and it&#39;s still the most comfortable nozzle to insert as long as I just dilated.  I never had to smooth it and it isn&#39;t showing signs of degradation, and the bulb is still working great.  Unfortunately these are twice as expensive as two years ago because they aren&#39;t being made anymore but I still recommend them.  The nozzle is not as long as others but I believe the big opening lets you push water at high pressure to the back of the canal.  I push it up till it seals against the vaginal opening and inflate my canal with the fluid before I let it run out as I squeeze more in.
</p>
<p>
Since I was trying new dilators and douche nozzles and doing internal massages, I decided to try the
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Intimate-Rose-Pelvic-Muscle-Relief/dp/B0B1NT7YZY">Intimate Rose Vibrating Pelvic Wand
</a>
.  I don&#39;t recommend it.  It&#39;s smaller than it looks.  The thick end is the only end that vibrates but it&#39;s so short it could barely reach the scar tissue near my entrance, much less the deep stuff.  The thin end can reach some of the deeper scar tissue but not all of it, it&#39;s so pointy it hurts moving over the bumpy spots, and without a curve in the end you can&#39;t really rub the scar tissue properly anyway.  The weird shape of the intimate rose makes it hit my thigh when I try to turn it to reach scar tissue on the left or right, and trying to aim it left or right without turning it doesn&#39;t provide much leverage.  It&#39;s also covered in soft, matte plastic that may or may not be skin safe.  I basically don&#39;t have anything good to say about it except maybe that the wireless magnetic charger is neat, but good luck replacing the battery without ruining the water proofing.  Just use the Soul Source dilators with the curved tips for massage.
</p>
<p>
One off-topic bit before I go:  I grew up teased about having boobs even when I lost weight so I got into the habit of hunching my shoulders forward to minimize their appearance.  This habit is so long engrained it&#39;s taking me months of effort to break.  My bra pulls in this weird way when I have my chest forward and it&#39;s so hard not to let that sensation make me want to hunch.  But I definitely look more feminine with shoulders back.  I&#39;ve been doing daily stretches in the corner of a room, forearms against the wall, pointing up, elbows even with shoulders, then lean forward into the corner for 30 secs, relax, repeat 2 more times.  I also try to pull both shoulders back when I sleep on my side, lay on my back, or sit in a chair.
</p>
<p>
The change has been so slow but my surgical healing got me used to that.  I feel more confident and feminine with shoulders back.  I&#39;ve never enjoyed dancing until I tried it recently and imitated another lady swaying my chest and my hips.  I got a compliment from a stranger and my SO liked it, so it felt really good.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it for now!  I&#39;d call my recovery around 95% complete at this point.  I just need a bit more stretching, granulation to go away completely, and a bit more improvement in the spots that still hurt when massaged.  Also wish my clit would be stable after prolonged labia pressure but unsure if that will ever resolve.

Hey I read through some of these journal posts and it seems like you&#39;ve gone through so much to fully recover... I never thought that bottom surgery would be this difficult. Would you say that it&#39;s worth it in the end? I&#39;m no where near the point where I can get it but it&#39;s been something that I&#39;ve wanted the most, and hearing about all of the complications is kind of disheartening.

It&#39;s been a long journey but it was worth the effort.  I know from talking to the doctor and medical studies I&#39;ve read that most recoveries are much faster than mine was, while a very few are slower, more painful, or more complicated.  It&#39;s one of those things where you need to decide for yourself if the average 4-8 months of recovery and the 10-20% possibility of it taking longer is a risk worth the benefits of the transition.  I think doing it when younger makes a faster recovery more likely, and I think if I&#39;d seen a physical therapist much earlier, done the internal/external massages correctly, more walking/exercise/sitting, and increased dilator sizes faster, I could have cut my recovery down by 6 months or more.
</p>
<p>
Everyone will feel differently about the odds and have different priorities and opinions.  I can&#39;t say do it or not for anyone but myself, but I would do it again if given the choice.
</p>
<p>
Although my recovery was long, it hasn&#39;t been too traumatic other than when my clit was stuck sideways.  The last year or so has been kind of a limbo where nothing hurt too much or limited me much, but the pains that were there improved very slowly. The main thing that bothered me was being too tight to have sex.  At the same time, sex isn&#39;t a high priority for me anymore so it didn&#39;t bother me too much.  At this point in my recovery, I think sex is a possibility and I&#39;m just waiting for a chance to try.  So I&#39;d say my recovery is about 97% complete.
</p>
<p>
One update that hasn&#39;t made it to my journal yet is that the first 75% of my canal rarely hurts to touch anymore and it&#39;s started to feel more good to rub it.  I&#39;ve had two orgasms so far just rubbing it for a few mins without needing to touch my clit or do anything else.  This is pretty major given that other ways I&#39;ve found to climax usually take 30+ mins of careful attention and don&#39;t always work.  Now I think I might actually climax during intercourse.  So I feel good about that and am looking forward to trying.

That&#39;s nice to know at least. I mean for me I think bottom surgery is the thing I want most out of my transition but do you have to dilate forever?? That seems like such a chore @_@

You have to dilate forever if you don&#39;t want to lose depth.  There&#39;s some evidence that people who stop dilating for long periods are also at risk of having a section close off and then fill with fluid that must be surgically drained.  But after a year or two you should be able to reduce the frequency to once or twice a week or possibly less.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still doing it almost every day to try to get my width up.  I&#39;ve moved on to a silicone dildo that is about 2.5&#34; diameter at my entry in the hope that will mean I can take a standard phallus without prior stretching.  So far, it means I can get the blue (1.5&#34; dia?) in 3/4 of the way most days within 30 secs.  I also noticed if I skip a day of dilating I can get to full depth more easily the next day, so I think daily dilating causes some amount of swelling, as does internal massage every other day.  I should be able to stop both those things eventually.
</p>
<p>
Daily dilation hasn&#39;t felt like too much of a chore to me because I enjoy watching TV or playing a game one handed while I dilate just before bed, but it may feel worse for people who don&#39;t enjoy sedentary activities.
