A very clear write up that is very similar to my experience with everything as well, except that I went through Zurich, Switzerland, rather than London, prior to getting here.  My surgery was on the 24th, so I‚Äôm still here recovering.   Maybe I already bumped into you somewhere.  If not, there‚Äôs a WhatsApp group that helps you connect with other Facialteam patients while you are here.  I‚Äôve met a lot of wonderful people who‚Äôve been patients here at the same time!  That has been one of the most beautiful surprises of all of this experience for me!

Oh hey congrats! I&#39;m probably in a neighborhing room in the hospital, or maybe you&#39;re already back at the hotel.
</p>
<p>
Last night was a bit rough but I&#39;m much better now. No pain really just difficulty breathing

I hope your breathing is doing better!  And yes, I‚Äôm back at my hotel room at this point.  Spent two nights there in the hospital.  I was so glad when they took the sponges out of my nostrils and once I was able to clean my nostrils with saline; I when I was able to breathe through my nose again.  Hang in there!  It‚Äôs gets a lot less uncomfortable by night two or three, or it should.  And then you still have to deal with swelling and bruising.  But so far, it hasn‚Äôt been quite as awful as I‚Äôd prepared myself for.

For sure for sure it&#39;s really not so bad at all. At this point I just have a lightheadedness paired with a light headache and my lower face is just numb and useless. No real pain or anything tho

Today I feel way better than all of the other days after surgery, so I just got to a much better place I think!  6 days post op, recovery suddenly seems a lot easier (plus I get my nose cast and sutures out tomorrow).

I just arrived back at the Villa, honestly for me none of this is so bad. The only really annoying part is the swelling on my jaw making it hard to eat or talk, and the first nite with the nose plugs in figuring out how to breathe. Those 3 days went by very fast!

I hope you are recovering nicely!  I‚Äôm getting really impatient with the swelling, and anxious to see what my results really look like after all of that!   Here‚Äôs to a quick recovery ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

I&#39;m doing very well, they even indicated I&#39;m probably moving faster than average. Very little bruising is left, the swelling at this point is  probably classifiable as mild to moderate and is concentrated at the bridge of my nose and my jaw. I can see my jaw again but it&#39;s all wavy and puffy and lumpy because of the swelling. My nose looks really good just that the body of it is a bit wider than usual
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m doing twice or thrice daily MLD so that may help, but I&#39;m also vegan and drink a ton of water so healing will be easier for me then most.
</p>
<p>
The hair transplant area is still pretty red, but I&#39;m exceptionally pale even as compared to northern Europeans. There are some sections that have returned to a more normal color. Also it seems like all the scabbing and stuff is gone except for two small spots.
</p>
<p>
How about yourself?

I am glad you mentioned the swelling around the bridge of your nose.  I have this too, and I was worried it was unusual to have so much of it.  At first, my nose looked really good, but it‚Äôs lost a lot of it‚Äôs original shape after the nose cast came off.  Hopefully the shape will look great again after the swelling goes down!  And same with jaw and chin: sort of shapeless down there, although I have a bit of a jaw line showing up.  Excited to see what the whole shape of my face will look like once it begins to emerge from swelling.  I‚Äôm hoping I will like it, and in the meantime I‚Äôm trying not to worry too much about how things look right now.
</p>
<p>
The incisions over my eyelids, for blepharoplasty, have also been a little slower to heal than I‚Äôd like.  They kind of opened up a bit after suture removal, so I‚Äôm hoping this won‚Äôt result in noticeable scarring above my eyelids.
</p>
<p>
And I am a bit anxious about the follicle transplants, since you have to wait about a year before you see them really growing in and whether they are a success or not.

The nose swelling after cast removal is absolutely normal, happens in 100% of cases. It can take even 18 months for it to be 100% done healing, but it&#39;ll look good long before that
