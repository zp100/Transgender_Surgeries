Yeah, that will be a little bit of dehiscence. It&#39;s very common and almost shouldn&#39;t even be regarded as a complication (it&#39;s seriously that common)
</p>
<p>
It is typically a &#34;worst before better&#34; kind of thing and will heal very well as long as you take care of it. At the moment, yours is very minor and is likely because of dilation. Between the swelling and the stitches those areas really don&#39;t want to move but dilating is important and is going to force the labia to part when they really don&#39;t want to which is a lot more stran than most realize.
</p>
<p>
Keep washing it as instructed and maybe even add a wound care spray, Medline skintegrity is an amazing product!
</p>
<p>
Otherwise your looking very well.

Oh, dry is gonna be near impossible, so don&#39;t worry too much about that XD
</p>
<p>
Just wash up whenever you dilate and #2, rinse when you pee and change your pads often. I went through so many of those already üòÖ
</p>
<p>
Also, keep your doctor in the loop in case it worsens.
</p>
<p>
If you go the skintegrity route get some gauze as well so you can spray the gauze after and put between u and the pad (ring it out so it&#39;s not to damp

I‚Äôm two and a half months post w Dr. Chettawut.  That is a very small amount towards the bottom there.  I had the tiniest bit like that on my left side like you.  It‚Äôs really healed back up for me, can barely see or notice anymore.
</p>
<p>
Be extra careful getting in and out of bed ( I developed a technique where I kept my legs relatively straight and knees relatively same distance apart, slowly ‚Äòrolling‚Äô gently out of bed pivoting at the hips somewhat like a barbie doll), and try to avoid pressure in that area.  Also remember when in the shower, if you use a washcloth,  (and with the wet wipes when dilating), use slight gentle dabbing motion and don‚Äôt rub or drag cloth across.  Same with toweling off.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm confident you‚Äôll be fine - because I am! üòÅüå∏üíñ

I have full body laser hair removal.  But some of my hair is blonde and some has turned grey and the laser can‚Äôt get that. So I don‚Äôt have a lot of hair or as much hair as some people, but I would still prefer it to be hairless.

That‚Äôs well within medically tolerable margins. The stitches are done with the expectation that a few of them will get undone, but will otherwise hold.
</p>
<p>
FWIW, I probably would not have noticed the dehiscence without the close-up.

Your dry skin looks like a jock itch infection, check that immediately since it can spread out very quickly inside you vagina making the healing process a total nightmare!

Yes!! It‚Äôs not really an infection, but the glue and the rubbing from the packing for a whole week got my skin super sensitive and annoyed. I‚Äôm already applying some ointment and it‚Äôs getting better. Thank you xx
