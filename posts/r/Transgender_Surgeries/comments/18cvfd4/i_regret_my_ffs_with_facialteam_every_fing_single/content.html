I&#39;ve seen your posts before and I&#39;m very sorry for what you&#39;ve been through and ask the pain right now.
</p>
<p>
Have you considered taking legal actions against them?

I see her posts every week (not just in this subreddit). It&#39;s gotten to the point of obsession and even spam.
</p>
<p>
Now of course she&#39;s allowed to share her experience. But when one experience keeps getting spammed, it drowns out all other people&#39;s experiences and gives an unbalanced perspective.

Bubs, this is a safe space to share experiences as you said, if you don’t care for a post, don’t interact! DON’T get on your high horse and try to tell people to be quiet because you personally find them grating, that silencing judgmental rhetoric is exactly the kind of thinking those who have hate in their heart for people like us believe! Assuming you’re not just a lurker, we all have something in common, and we should support each other!

They&#39;ve posted about it here like 4 times. Others have easily posted more about their single surgery and guess what? It&#39;s awesome. Learning more about  people&#39;s experiences especially as time goes in is a great thing to know. And is something we should be thanking them for, not discouraging.
</p>
<p>
Not to mention, in terms of the unbalanced perspective I&#39;d say that&#39;s more in the eye of the beholder, you should be doing your own research not just seeing one person&#39;s account and making a snap judgement about the place mentioned.

Not ffs, but as someone who has struggled from Srs complications for years and is now recovering from revision and seeing light ar the end of the tunnel: stay strong. You are such a strong woman and you will get everything fixed and rhis will just be a bad memory. You can do this

I have a small bump on my forehead that I always assumed was a pin that didn&#39;t get shaved down properly, it doesn&#39;t bother me as much anymore but it&#39;s still annoying. I assume that&#39;s why there&#39;s a 9k revision surgery to remove the pins

yeah, tbh I&#39;d be fine with it if the other side wasn&#39;t perfectly flat. You can see it on the photos they provided too, that one is round. Cant normally see it on my face but it is visible sometimes.
</p>
<p>
out of interest, did they tell you about that catheter? My biggest grief with them is that no one told me they&#39;d be putting in a catheter, which wasn&#39;t a good surprise when I woke up, having one in but also knowing someone had put the tube in... there... There was so much to process at the time that I brushed it off but looking back that was pretty fucked up.
</p>
<p>
I also wasn&#39;t given the option for a visualisation, it was all very rushed and I feel like I might have chosen different options if I&#39;d been able to see what they meant
</p>
<p>
the mouthwash they give you too has a warning on it about it staining your teeth, which I don&#39;t think I was told. I have really bad brown staining on my teeth now, and I haven&#39;t found out if that can be sorted out by a hygienist yet 🙄
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t remember the exact wording but I was really anxious about &#39;what happens after&#39; &#39;what if I don&#39;t like it&#39; and I&#39;m pretty sure they said that revisions were free if they do something wrong. (OP) I&#39;m not sure how they decide what counts as wrong but if it&#39;s over a year and you still have pain and numbness and you&#39;re not happy with the result, it could be worth asking them?? It feels to good too be true and you might not want to go back to them anyway, but I definitely read it somewhere and I&#39;m sure they said it.
</p>
<p>
I also found out before hand that where they say everything they do has a guarantee, it was a bad translation that they have medical insurance. Which although isn&#39;t the same, might offer a way to claim some remediation

I definitely seen your post and I am sorry you are going through that…. But with all due respect, and I may get downvoted for this, whats the point of posting this so many times? Like I feel like I see this post once per week if not more. This is a genuine question and not trying to be rude whatsoever!

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/s/KGzUKHussr">This</a>
is probably why. Someone&#39;s in the comments to schill for Facial Team. Many others on OP&#39;s posts also disparage Facial Team. OP is trying to help prevent people from making the mistake of going to facial team, and they don&#39;t care how many posts it takes before facial team gets no more customers to botch.

All surgeons botch sometimes; humans are complicated. If you don&#39;t understand there is a chance for a poor result, you should reconsider having surgery at all. We cross our fingers and roll the dice every time we go under the knife.
</p>
<p>
I totally understand the frustration and pain of OP, but one woman crusades are tiring to look at. Most of FT&#39;s patients are happy and going with them was the best decision of my life.
</p>
<p>
If she wants to make a difference, she needs to find other women with poor results from FacialTeam and make a group and then maybe there is a chance of taking  legal action and spreading the word. But this just doesn&#39;t seem to happen very often; it&#39;s the same couple of people making dozens of threads about how terrible FT are. Those of us who frequent these forums see the title and immediately go &#34;Not this again&#34;, it has the opposite effect as intended.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure you are going to call me a shill for posting this, but - sad as it is to say - our system is pretty much designed for single incidents to fall through the cracks. Unless you can demonstrate a
<em>
pattern
</em>
of negligence and poor results, no one is going to take your anecdote seriously.

So sorry to hear this, I am experiencing the same, I massively regret my forehead work with facialteam I had to get a revision on my coronal incision and it has gotten even worse,
</p>
<p>
Im currently waiting for the year mark to get transplants on my scar but my hair loss has been absolutely insane and I’ve had to cut it’s so short which has broken me
</p>
<p>
I was obsessing every day because my scar was and is so wide and straight that it is so noticeable and I saw people glancing them looking away etc which is horrible
</p>
<p>
I don’t think FacialTeam are the leaders in FFS because they don’t tailor your operation to your face it really is a one size fits all approach which I have learnt from having other procedures, where a surgeon has actually measured my face in balance to my other features etc, the pictures I have seen of Girls myself included who could have had a better result with hairline lowering/rounding included as part of their original surgery etc
</p>
<p>
But with that being said if you are happy with your FFS that’s all that matters, and they were professional and caring, the only thing that irked me was how they kept congratulating me on my result and telling me how beautiful I was etc when I was sat there for a revision with a massive scar on my head, like they didn’t seem to care or think it was a big deal just kept glossing it over
</p>
<p>
When I had my revision discussion with dr Guitterez he seemed a bit bored and frustrated when I asked him about different closure techniques like possibly a zig zag suture etc to help with tension
</p>
<p>
Not that it mattered because he didn’t even end up doing my surgery 😂, I was told I didn’t need a hairline and it would be invisible scar with no other changes and fell for the spiel
</p>
<p>
So yes I can see why you are so upset my forehead is now looking to cost me over £30 grand in total after hair transplant and may not even work
</p>
<p>
So I am sorry you are hurting so badly, I still feel so sad about my result and hairloss and it has left me feeling suicidal and low,  but I promise time will make it feel slightly better enough that you can carry on,
</p>
<p>
All surgery has risks and unfortunately we have been unlucky and I think we’re probably operated in a way that wasn’t appropriate for our individual needs which is why a one size fits all method isn’t right
</p>
<p>
But for those who have had FFS and are happy I am so glad for you, it’s an incredibly expensive and Hard life with quality of life not guaranteed so hopefully there  will be some happiness

I was strongly considering them but went with Nikhil Maini in Brighton, England instead. I&#39;m so sorry they did this to you. It&#39;s still fairly fresh though so it might improve a small amount but idk. I&#39;m just sorry.

It was 16k for forehead, lip lift and chin and so far the experience has been great. I had a month wait from enquiry to consultation then about 9 months between consultation and surgery. The facility was awesome, Mr Maini would check up on me in the mornings while I was at the hospital and the results look extremely natural. It wasn&#39;t the dysphoria cure I had built up in my head but it largely dealt with things I hated most about my face, specifically a very largely protruding brow bone and a pretty uneven chin. Pain was very manageable, no complications and I barely even notice the numbness anymore, in fact if anything it&#39;s helping my electrolysis be a little more bearable, lol. I&#39;d recommend Maini to anyone looking for an ffs surgeon. 😊

I had FFS with FT in March this year and I agree, they don&#39;t tailor their FFS procedures to your face. FT&#39;s cookie-cutter approach to FFS is a stark contrast from what I was lead to believe it was when I was researching my options. While I was in Marbella I learned that they do three FFS procedures a day (perhaps it&#39;s more now) during their hours of operation, with the doctors going from one patient to the next like a marathon. I wasn&#39;t even allowed to meet with my lead surgeon before the surgery (Dr. Bailon, I was told that language issues were the reason) and I also learned who was doing it the day before. I had been told my surgeons would be Drs. Capitan and Simon during virtual consultations beforehand, so it was a shock to have a different surgeon (Capitan and Simon both happened to be on vacation). I felt rushed through the entire process, it was like being in a surgical assembly line. The hospital in Marbella where you stay for the first few days after surgery was very nice, however there is apparently a lot of organized crime in the area because all my belongings were stolen when I went out to lunch at the nearby waterfront the day prior to surgery. FT didn&#39;t really care that I was robbed in between my consultations with the surgical assistants (not even the lead surgeon) and the hair transplant surgeon who is contracted with them (Dra. Meyer) and made no accommodations. I didn&#39;t get my nose done at FT but my impression is that Dr. Bellinga is a mediocre rhinoplasty surgeon.
</p>
<p>
So, I had forehead, chinplasty/jaw contouring, and a hair transplant. The results of my chin and jaw work are the most concerning to me because it was evident from the start that they didn&#39;t listen to my concerns and merely removed a uniform amount of bone from my entire jawline. This has become more apparent with time, and I&#39;ve had a few consultations since my surgery trying to work out a revision plan but now I don&#39;t even want to go back if they waive the surgical fees. Risking more nerve damage based on promises from surgeons who have already betrayed my trust...it&#39;s not a very exciting proposition. My jaw was the biggest source of facial dysphoria for me and instead of taking my concerns into account they did lazy work and then claimed it was no big deal because women with wide jaws exist, citing Hollywood actresses. I also dislike my hair transplant, which did not even attempt to create the oval hairline they discuss in all their promotional videos. I&#39;m fortunate that I haven&#39;t had any major complications from the brow work. Though my forehead and brow is not perfect it is at least an improvement I can live with, plus getting my facial skin peeled off again is not on my to-do list.
</p>
<p>
I honestly don&#39;t know what FFS surgeon I would recommend at this point. My trust in the whole medical industry after fighting it nonstop for almost 4 years is extremely low. If you are rich and lucky enough to see one of the superstar doctors in the US, go for it. I can vouch for Dr. Mardirossian, whom I personally consulted with while researching my options but declined due to his prices. If you live in the US and your insurance covers an FFS surgeon with a great reputation then that&#39;s definitely better than spending a ton to go to FT. If at any point my insurance would have covered work with a great US surgeon I would have chosen that option.

He only speaks Spanish in the video? My primary language is English (though I am an advanced Spanish speaker) and the excuse I got for not being able to speak to him before surgery was that his English was bad. I spoke to him afterwards though and I thought his English was fine, so I don&#39;t believe FT&#39;s explanation.
<br>
I don&#39;t think Bailon is necessarily a bad surgeon, FT just operates like an FFS machine that doesn&#39;t tailor their operations to the specific needs of the patient. It&#39;s a stark contrast from the image they promote of themselves, but I guess it shouldn&#39;t be too surprising that at the end of the day it&#39;s about the love of money over everything else.

I&#39;m sorry for what happened to you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had a consultation with them and two major negative things definitely stood out to me: Only three surgeons are EBOPRAS certified and the surgeon I&#39;ve consulted with straight up denied that titanium allergies exist. I would expect someone who&#39;s putting titanium screws in my forehead to know that. They are rare, but they do exist and I was worried since my lobes still haven&#39;t properly healed after about half a year.

I am sorry to hear that. I think that everyone needs to be really prepared for the outcome of surgery of any kind. It may not be as expected. I have not had FFS but have had other surgeries and some went well and others not so much. If they were being negligent I would definitely try to go after them.

I’m so sorry OP. Facialteam are a cookie cutter assembly line with ego driven surgeons. Especially their nose surgeon. Their results are always underwhelming, then they convince the patients there are limitations due to the sex assigned at birth. FT is another marketing trap, just like kamol hospital. They really need to employ a craniofacial surgeon and overhaul their way of thinking. This “coronal incision with transplants” approach is pure rubbish. It leaves every patient with a high hairline which never looks good. It may be out of budget, but DB or Mardirossian in the US will definitely be able to fix this.

I’m sorry you had a bad experience, all surgeries come with some risk.
</p>
<p>
I worked with FacialTeam 3 years ago and had an amazing experience. They treated me exceptionally well from consult to follow up. The team has amazing credentials, cutting edge technical advancements, and a wonderful loving staff.
</p>
<p>
I know you are upset and it’s fine to voice your experiences but when you have a meltdown on Reddit instead of working with your team on revisions, you can’t expect them to continue working with you.
</p>
<p>
My nose and chin took a full year to heal because of the nature of the bone and soft tissue in those areas.
</p>
<p>
You can see my before and after on my IG krisztina_magdalena. I had a HUGE Adam’s Apple and nose, a very tall chin. Prominent brow and widows peaks.
</p>
<p>
Hundreds of women have had incredibly positive experiences with them and it’s remarkable that you think your experience is somehow worth destroying their reputation by posting over and over again that you are miserable.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had 9 affirming surgeries and every single one has had a period of depression and anxiety about the healing process and complications. And every time I’ve taken a deep breath, cried to my therapists, and when I calmed down, talked with my team and let them help me.
</p>
<p>
A patient is as much a part of the process and team and all of the medical and recovery staff. If you let your emotions overwhelm you, you derail your own care.
</p>
<p>
I hope the best for you. FacialTeam is an amazing group.

Yes of course it’s fine to talk about our experiences. And the loudest voices are usually unhappy with their experiences, again totally understandable.
</p>
<p>
I am simply pointing out this case and the very few cases of unhappy individuals are statistically very rare outliers with FT. And while complications occasionally arise, it’s often the communication style and behavior of the patient that derail the after care and revision process.
</p>
<p>
And I don’t think it’s fair to color FTs response as “offering them money to be quiet” though. Some service providers will offer to refund a portion of the surgical cost, which is admirable especially given the tone of the communications at that point. And I think what we would hope for a provider to offer a refund if we were inconsolably unhappy. But of course they are going to make the refund conditional that you don’t defame them.
</p>
<p>
FacialTeam is still my recommendation when women ask who I trust.

I’m not here to debate or negate another trans woman’s lived experience.
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry you had issues, it certainly sounds like there were communication and expectation problems. No one wants to deal with complications from an affirming surgery.
</p>
<p>
I had an exceptionally positive experience with the surgical team and recovery staff. I personally know a dozen other trans women who had overwhelmingly positive experiences with FacialTeam.
</p>
<p>
I’m offering a counterpoint to your experience, that’s all. I hope you find a team that fits your communication style and can provide you with the revisions you need to feel confident and affirmed.

You are incredibly dismissive and arrogant facing someone in extreme anguish and pain. As someone who knows firsthand the effect of gaslighting and bullying (including in the trans community), your behaviour is a disgrace to all people affected by power imbalances. You should rise for the most vulnerable and not shill for the all-powerful. I am ashamed to share the trans status with you.

I have zero relationship with FT and there’s no benefit for me to stick my neck out to defend someone besmirching them. And I let her first two posts go because I understand the emotional pain one goes through when recovering from an affirming surgery (with or without complications).
</p>
<p>
But OP isn’t just saying she isn’t happy, she’s calling them “gangsters” and using language that makes them sound like a criminal enterprise preying on the trans community.
</p>
<p>
It’s not at all inappropriate for me, in her 3rd post, to share my personal experience in their defense. I was treated with respect and kindness and my care was professional.
</p>
<p>
Of course I want every trans person to have successful affirming care with zero complications. And I absolutely want her to find a team to work with to get her through her revisions. But I’d come to any friend’s aide if I felt like they were being verbally assaulted in public unfairly. Based on my own lived experiences as a trans person who got affirming care with FT, I feel like OPs post goes too far in that regard.

Because I’m grateful for how they treated me: with dignity and compassion.
</p>
<p>
When I did my consult in NYC, I forgot my jacket. They brought it back to Spain and kept it for a year and gave it back to me.
</p>
<p>
Their recovery staff washed my hair by hand while I cried looking at my swollen, bruised face.
</p>
<p>
The surgeons each met with me before and after and explained what they were going to do and what was done. My nose was badly damaged as a kid and I couldn’t breathe out of the left side when I slept. They repaired that and I’ve had no problems since. My Adams Apple was enormous and now it’s barely visible. My chin and forehead are natural. All of the follow up care was sincere.
</p>
<p>
I’ve stayed in contact with some of the staff and they are genuinely nice people.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had 9 affirming surgeries, some with complications, and I’ve had revisions. I’ve suffered through the intense depression of feeling botched. But I worked with a therapist to deal with those feelings and kept my communication with all of my affirming surgical teams very professional. It’s critical to have a therapist and support system to work through that part of the emotional recovery.
</p>
<p>
I will state over and over that I am sorry OP is struggling with her recovery and I hope she gets all the affirming care she needs to live a happy life.
</p>
<p>
And indeed by being a voice from the trans community that is stating my positive experience with them, I’ve been told I’m the embarrassment and not worthy of being trans (which is totally ridiculous and immature) but frankly I could care less. I’m simply sharing my experience because the repeatedly harsh posts and language used is antithetical to my experience with them.

The bumps on the side of your nose might just be swelling. I still have a bit left after a year, but I&#39;ve seen it evolve from side to side during the recovery.
