I heard there is some good reviews and some really bad reviews... A girl that got her surgery there had to do few surgeries and she goes now to another surgeon cuz they can&#39;t seem to figure out what is going on with her. From what I&#39;ve heard, The esthetic is almost never botched, it&#39;s really the functional side of the surgery that they seem to have a hard time with (I say they for the team. Back when it was Dr monstrey, the clinic had really good results). So idk i kind of have mix feelings but again it&#39;s with what I heard in Trans groups and stuff. Never had any experience with this team

I&#39;ve had a very bad experience with my SRS now nearly three years ago, and it was Monstrey himself who left me with unbearable results and a medical trauma. I had a totall revision, colonvaginoplastie and esthetic correction in december. I went again to UZ Gent but with a new surgeon dr Buncamper, he did an excellent revision, everything is ok now.

Yes I asked for him, he was my only hope, I had a trauma with Monstrey and a bad experience with Claes who did my orchi the year before my first grs. In Belgium you have the right to choose your doctor.  Just the system in UZ to use everytime another assistent was for me again not easy, I still have problems to trust new doctors. And yes Buncamper operate not only revisions. There are also other options like dr. Houtmeyers and dr. Juli Dobbeleir, especialy the last has helped me alot with a medical examination anesthetized. Wish you all the best for your grs

Hey, at the moment looking to get srs done asap. Wanted to go abroad but our health insurance keeps the door closed tight. So seems the only option is Belgium or pay privately. Would you like to share your results? Groet en, Lizzie
