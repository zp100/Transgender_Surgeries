The vagina itself is healing fantastically imo, but recovery otherwise has been rough. Since my last update, I&#39;ve come to realize that my physical health was poorer than I initially thought.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m very weak and have pretty bad muscle sense/control. Since my muscles are weak, other muscles have to help out to compensate for pretty much any movement I do. It makes it very hard to relax.
</p>
<p>
My posture is also pretty bad, and has been for years. Due to this, even when I correct my posture, I have a pretty noticable lordosis.
</p>
<p>
I have developed orthostatic intolerance, feeling like I can&#39;t stand up for long, or I&#39;m about to fall. If I stand up too quickly, my vision blacks out and I feel dizzy.
</p>
<p>
Adding to that, my circulation is weird; blood pools in my feet and hands when I stand up still for too long, but my head feels like it is about to explode when I lie down for too long as well. Most concerning is how in certain positions my arms lose blood flow, and very quickly become numb.
</p>
<p>
All of these problems are pretty interconnected, and I can&#39;t tell which one has caused the others. These are not really complications from the surgery, but rather underlying problems that have become worse from the stress during recovery.
</p>
<p>
I am actively seeking care for these things, to hopefully get out of the vicious cycle caused by the orthostatic intolerance, so I can get started with some mild exercise. I did an active stand test, and my results fulfil the diagnostic criteria for POTS. Which my doctor seems to be unaware of, and considered my results &#34;perfectly fine&#34;. He told me there wasn&#39;t anything else he could do, declining any further testing.
</p>
<p>
I have an appointment to a physiotherapist soon, hopefully they can provide me with some more tests to do, as well as practical help with my other somatic problems.

This looks great!!?? I&#39;m swedish but have never seen this surgeon before. I thought there was only one or two and their results aren&#39;t great, but this looks fantastic. How is sensation and recovery? Do you know what method was used?

That was partly why I decided to share my timeline, since I couldn&#39;t find any other surgeries done by Dr. Selvaggi here.
</p>
<p>
Sensation is alright imo, I can climax through clitoral masturbation decently well. Sure it is not as easy as before, but the feeling is fantastic 🤩✨️
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know more exact information about the method other than it being penile inversion.

I&#39;ve heard it can take a while for nerve ending to reconnect, and that masturbation can stimulate the process. You&#39;ve definitely peaked my interest though, hopefully i can go through the system and save a lot of money😊

I definitely think regular mild stimulation is helpful, but I&#39;m a bit more cautious with masturbation, especially climaxing. It is quite easy to get carried away lol 🫣😅😂 but I am not refraining from it either; if I have the energy, I am encouraging myself to do it
</p>
<p>
Glad I could offer some new insight ^^ i wish you the best 🙏🫶🤞
</p>
<p>
edit: also thanks 💕 (i forgot twice lol)

Thank you 💖 and I wish I knew myself, sadly I think it comes down to genetics 😅😔 I seem to have above average natural keratin production, it affects my hair growth as well. Which unfortunately includes facial hair 😕
</p>
<p>
With that said, my nails were looking in better shape in these pictures than they actually were. Some of them had started to veer slightly off center, or had become a bit translucent, so I have had them cut since then. Not the biggest loss, they&#39;ll likely grow back to about half that length within 2-3 weeks 😂
</p>
<p>
My nails would likely be fantastic if I
<em>
did
</em>
put in more actual care for them, by filing and maintaining shape regularly 😮‍💨

I am literally jealous of your nails. Currently using nail strengthener to get my nails stronger so they can grow. You literally have a permanent pink and white set

I remember making my cis girl classmates in high school jealous of my nails, looong before transition. So I&#39;m well aware of my &#39;nail privilege&#39;. I hope that the nail strengthener has good effect 🙏🤞🫶
