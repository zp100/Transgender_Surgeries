Thanks, I’ll take a look at this and get back to you tomorrow. I removed the post as it’s not really suitable for this sub, but you can continue to reply here.

Ok! I also think it&#39;s useful to not have it in the main scroll.  I didn&#39;t figure out another way to send it.  And, yes, def not very &#34;on subject&#34;, I just figured since the wiki&#39;s scope is same as the sub, and this stuff is there, might as well I let you know.

I updated it. Let me know what you think.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="/r/transDIY" rel="nofollow">r/transDIY</a>
sub would have probably been better for this, as others might have been able to add to it.

Looks good.  I mean, I wouldn&#39;t even use &#34;not possible&#34; in first bullet because I&#39;ve pushed raw castor through 30ga needle in my experiments, and that&#39;s as thick of oil as you get, but I won&#39;t complain if you want to leave that in.  I would also add &#34;changing to a new
<strong>
smaller
</strong>
needle for injection reduces pain&#34;.  You also linked the post instead of the comment, but I&#39;m fine with that.  Thanks for the change!  You have very good coverage of hrt and techniques on your wiki, might as well keep it current :). I&#39;m sure
<a href="/r/transDIY" rel="nofollow">r/transDIY</a>
can take care well enough on their own.

I copied your post into a comment so I can reference it in the wiki
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In - hrt/injections - syringes and needles section
</p>
<p>
First bullet - &#34;you can&#39;t inject a thick oil through a thin needle&#34; is misleading. You can&#39;t draw thick oil through a thin needle, or rather the process becomes impossibly long. But you can definitely push the thick oil out when you inject. Reason - when drawing, you can only create a vacuum with the plunger, and only 14psi of atmosphere to squeeze the oil in, which is very little for thick oils to make them flow through thin tubes. When injecting, especially with small syringes that have tiny diameter plunger, you&#39;re multiplying the force of your finger, so 5lb equivalent of pushing effort can easily turn into &gt;&gt;100psi of pressure forcing the oil, which will make any thick oil go through a tiny needle. It might not be instant for a large volume like a half ml, so you&#39;ll need maybe 5-10s to finish pushing it all in for the most viscous stuff, but it will def work, and you can use the smallest needles you can find for maximum comfort and injury reduction.
</p>
<p>
Another bullet down the same list, same idea - punching a vial will blunt a needle, so it&#39;s good to switch to a new one for injecting to reduce pain. True. Although the blunting from rubber is not as bad as the blunting caused by skin itself. But the main reason why recommend luer-lok and switching needles (usually of different size) is in my first paragraph - you don&#39;t want to spend a minute drawing. Main reason to switch is to use a large gauge needle to draw quickly, which would be an inappropriately large needle for injecting (like 18ga, easy to draw anything, sadistic to suggest to inject with), and then you switch to a needle which is most appropriate and thinnest for best comfort and injecting experience.
</p>
<p>
I have pushed raw castor oil no solvents (by far the thickest stuff around) through a 30ga needle. Obviously you can&#39;t use one piece insulin syringes to draw that, and I used a fatter needle and luer-lok to get the oil into the syringe. Most hormones in oils that have standard solvent content can be drawn and injected with 30ga 1/2&#34; needles of one piece insulin syringes perfectly fine.
</p>
<p>
Reason why I think it&#39;s important to update this, besides there not be a point in having that information up if there with no mechanism to perfect it with time, is - met a few people online and irl over the years, and someone yesterday on another sub infact, doing silly things - having Luer-lok, switching needles for drawing and injecting, ok, then I find out they&#39;re using a 20ga needle for drawing and a 21ga needle for injecting, because their doctor recommended 21ga to draw, 23ga to inject, and the pharmacy didn&#39;t have 23ga needles, so 20/21 is the combo they chose because it was closest and followed the pattern on the script instead of getting a 25ga 1&#34; to inject with, which are the most basic things and available anywhere. They could have drawn their E with same size needle, or even same needle too (I bought from same pharmacy with same recipe, I know the viscosity), and the pain from a tiny bit of blunting is irrelevant when you compare the pain caused by choosing a sharp 21ga vs a dull 25ga. &#34;Can&#39;t inject thick oil through thin needles&#34; can easily lead people to believe they need thicker needles to inject, instead of thinnest, which can substantially increase risk of injury. On further discussion the person shared they were concerned with the blood squirting that happened often. I don&#39;t think you want to do that with the wiki.
</p>
<p>
The impact of this isn&#39;t huge of course, but I hope you can follow my reason here. I leave my 2¢ in your hands.
