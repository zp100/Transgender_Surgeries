I had surgery with Dr Wittenberg last week and posted how everything went.  Today was the unveiling, dilation, and catheter removal.
</p>
<p>
I first want to say that the staff is amazing.  It will be more clear why later, lol.
</p>
<p>
I undressed and sat in the stirrups.  Taking off the bolster felt so good.  Like, instantly improved my life.  The packing came out and I giggled, I was very ticklish in there.  I looked in the mirror, and wow.  It was a disaster.  Red, swollen, barely recognizable.  Staff agreed it looked very good for one week.  And I know it&#39;s true, it&#39;s just hard to take.
</p>
<p>
The PA explained dilation, she showed me once, and I got 15cm.  Yay!  I dilated two more times, it was super easy.
</p>
<p>
She then filled my bladder, pulled the catheter, and then we waited for me to pee.  Didn&#39;t happen.  They left the room for a few minutes, nothing.  I couldn&#39;t go.  So they came in and said they&#39;d have to place a new catheter.  From that point on, I was screaming in pain, crying, and had no idea what was going on.
</p>
<p>
Megan, Esperanza, and Adam (the medical team for Dr Wittenberg) were so kind and patient with me.  They explained my muscles were too tight and would not relax.  Which explains what I felt which was like a horrible cramp that wouldn&#39;t let go. The third catheter worked, and I was still crying 20 minutes later.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not kidding, it was like an exorcism in there.  But they couldn&#39;t have been more caring, patient, and technically accurate.  When the larger tubing worked, I was free to go.  Everything was burning, I was a wreck, and I came home to ice and relax.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still very happy with my results, but the next couple weeks will be very critical to keep it all together :)

Out of curiousity, how tight/toned were your lower abdominal/groin muscles pre-surgery?

At least above average, I was very fit.  Stairs, squats, yoga daily.
</p>
<p>
But this was my pelvic floor fighting a very full bladder.  It pinched down hard.  When s catheter is in there, I feel it, and my pelvic floor clenches tighter against it.
</p>
<p>
But this isn&#39;t controllable for me, and it contracts so hard I feel like I&#39;m going to tear something

Thanks for posting!  I&#39;m almost certain to schedule a surgery with her in the next week or so, so I appreciate any and all posts on experiences with her!
