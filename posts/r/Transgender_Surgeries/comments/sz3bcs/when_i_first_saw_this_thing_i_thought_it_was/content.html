Oh looks wonderful.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to reach out to Dr. Witten at some point. I live fairly close, so how great would it be to be able to recover at home right?!

Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
I smiled when I saw this because it just so happened I was laying there with Big Orville Orange buried up to the thumb divot.
</p>
<p>
I remember the first time I saw my dilators. I was about three days post and I had the same response.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm 105 days out now and it really does get better.
</p>
<p>
It looks like Witten does good work. I considered him, but his hair removal regimen was such that I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to have surgery with him for a couple of years. I couldn‚Äôt wait that long.

Good to know about his hair removal routine. Is it possible to go to somebody else for hair removal and then come to him for the surgery?

He requires his patients to do exactly that. He told me he absolutely doesn‚Äôt do follicle scraping, so he told me it would have been impossible for me to have my surgery in 2021.
</p>
<p>
Bear in mind, by hair removal, he means electrolysis of the entire shaft, the entire scrotum, and about an inch around the base of the penis. Since hair follicles there run on a four month cycle and not all follicles produce at the same time, it‚Äôs easily a year and more because even an hour-long electrolysis session can‚Äôt get a whole lot of hair. I had five months of pubic hair removal and spent about $2K doing it.
</p>
<p>
Edit: B-T-W, Dr Chris McClung in Columbus, OH is doing some excellent work. I was going to have a consult with him until I decided to go with Dr Selph in Birmingham.

Was there anything specific he told you about the hair removal? I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m trying to ask but I have my consultation with him today and I don&#39;t really know what to expect

Yay! Congratulations! So as far as depth goes I can get about 7 to 7.5 inches, as you see, the dilators are 9 &#34; long. It all depends on how much skin they can graft on the inside, but I had an average size penis before and wasn&#39;t particularly girthy.
</p>
<p>
So pads, here&#39;s what I would say. Right after surgery and until you are fully healed if you can get away with wearing skirts or dresses without panties and just carry disposable bed pads with you, you&#39;re are going to be 1000 times more comfortable. I&#39;m still doing that, when I try to wear a pad it rubs against the area and slows healing. I by a pack of 50 pads on Amazon for like $20. If you have to wear pants for some reason then what I would do is loosely bandage the area with gauze and medical tape on your legs not on the surgical area and then just put panties loosely over that.
</p>
<p>
Lube, Astroglide Water Based Gel, make sure it&#39;s the regular non-warming gel. This is the best lube, comes in 4oz tubes, get six and be ready to use 1-2 a week.
</p>
<p>
Disposable gloves, you are going to be applying antibiotic ointment to yourself after you dilate, after you shower, or after you wipe when using the restroom.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of using the restroom, flushable wipes. It&#39;s going to be a very moist area and regular toilet paper tends to break apart. Those flushable wipes are safer and won&#39;t leave bits behind.
</p>
<p>
If you can swing it a shower with a detachable head, you&#39;re not going to be able to spray water directly on it but you can spray the water above it and let it run down onto it. It makes cleaning up after dilating so much easier. Speaking of showers, a shower chair or shower stool it&#39;s going to take a little bit before you&#39;ll probably feel fully comfortable standing for a long time.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s about it. Will you be recovering at home or staying in Louisville ?

Oh that&#39;s wonderful! Yes you will be in for five days, but going to the bathroom won&#39;t really be be a problem, not for the first few days anyway. Until they unpack you in day 5 you&#39;re going to have a catheter in for urine and between the bowel prep, pre-op fast, lack of appetite for the first day and a half, and opioid pain medications, you probably won&#39;t have a bowel movement for at least the first three days. Regarding diet do not eat anything that gives you gas, I was absolutely miserable on day and night for because I had eaten something with beans in it and being unable to move it just I was in so much pain, and apparently you can only take Gas-X every 6 hours. If you do have to do the bedpan they will help you roll over, they&#39;ll hold it, they&#39;ll clean you up, they&#39;ll do everything for you.
</p>
<p>
The nursing staff there is phenomenal, you never have to feel bad about calling them they are always happy to come and help and they can get you whatever they have whenever you need it. ü§ó
