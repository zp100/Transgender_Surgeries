Congrats!  I’m scheduled with her next summer.
</p>
<p>
Are you happy with the aesthetics (so far)?  How was the pain level?  I’d heard someone say before that taking the packing out was really painful, how bad was that?

Thanks!!! Oh, it’s so pretty! Just super swollen. I call it melon pussy. Lol. Pain is fine. I just get a couple aches here and there but that’s about it. Ibuprofen takes care of that. And some oxy that I rarely use if it’s really bad.
</p>
<p>
Packing wasn’t painful. But it did feel like your insides were being pulled out. It just felt very weird and very uncomfortable. But pain. No. But it could also be because I was on pain meds. Lol. I was singing while it happened.

So happy to hear that, I’m excited for you!  And so excited for my turn 😊
</p>
<p>
I’m glad to hear the pain was well-managed!  Any issues with peeing or dilating?

Omg! Peeing is still a struggle. Lol. But deff way better.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is actually way easier than I expected. Just listen to some music and 20 mins later you’re done. Setup and clean up actually takes longer.

I’m sure it’s gonna be fun learning to pee again lol but hey, I’ll do what I gotta do 😊
</p>
<p>
And that’s awesome, her dilation schedule definitely seems to be less than those of other surgeons.  I imagine that’s because of her technique.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy for you!  Sounds like everything went really well!  Further reinforces my decision to wait another year to have my surgery with Dr. B-L.  Oh, is Kevin still there?  I always hear how awesome he is from other B-L patients 😊

Ha. At first peeing hurt like a bitch. Now it’s getting easier. And I would go through times where I would pee every 5 mins. And it’s leveling out now. So that’s nice. Still stings a little as the swelling is going down.
</p>
<p>
Yeah! It’s super easy. I’m actually about to go dilate and douche in a second when my friend gets out of the bathroom so I can pee. Lol. Yeah. Her technique is great! I love it.
</p>
<p>
Kevin is literally amazing. He’s my fav. He makes things easy and understandable. And he’s hilarious. He also gives you any supplies you ask for as to save you money.

What was her waitlist like? Also, what insurance did you use and about how much did you have to pay out of pocket?

Well, I waited 1.5 years but only cause I had to postpone my first date for school. But I know someone that went for a consult earlier in July and got a date for September. You just have to have everything in order already. All your letters and have started electrolysis and she will put you at the top of her list. Otherwise, her waitlist is quite long.
</p>
<p>
I have Cigna and I only had to pay 100 bucks for admission.

Wait... so $100 total? Is there a catch? If that’s the case I could get it right now. As for the wait list, would I have to go into the consult with everything already done and ready or would she give me a list and I’d just report back?

Yes, I paid 100 total. But that’s cause I have really great insurance since I work for the government. I may have to pay more later. Idk. But as of now, I only had to pay 100.
</p>
<p>
The most important thing are letters. She won’t schedule a consult if you don’t have at least 1 letter. Then you need two for her to give you a date that’s far away. And then 3 she will give you a sooner date. And then you have to rush for electrolysis. She rewards people who come to her prepared with sooner dates. She doesn’t give you a list. The consult is mainly just for her to explain her method. Take pics of you. And just get you in the system. She doesn’t really do a whole lot of explain surgery and stuff like a normal consult. I think because she expects you to know what you want. So if you know you wanna go to her and you get everything done, she gives you a date very soon.

Ok, so my game plan would be to get 3 notes and electrolysis before my consultation and then I would have to fly out to NY as it’s in person? (I would assume her “taking pictures” means that I have to do it in person?) As for the health insurance, I just looked into Cigna and it looks like there not available in my state. Do you have any recommendations or advice on electrolysis?

Yeah. She takes post op pics of you. And yes, if you have everything as far as letters it’s great. And then it’s just better to start electrolysis in general. Because if not, you’re rushing if she gives you a date. My original date was 6 months after my consult because I had my letters. And I didn’t expect it. So I was rushing to get electrolysis done. You just have to find a place. I know there’s a place in Texas that does electrolysis and will do a full clearing with numbing and stuff for you. So you will only have to go there like once a couple months. Instead of once a week or something. Idk what they are called. But I’m sure a google search will show it very easily.

Awesome, so just to make sure I have it straight my game plan would be  1: get insurance that will cover it 2: reach out for a consultation  3: get doctors notes and electrolysis 4: fly in for consultation, then fly home 5: pussy time

Yup!!! Lol. She only takes insurance. Because she’s at a technology hospital and fees are sky high. I just checked my EOB and while I still have only paid 100 the fees are starting to come in. And let’s just say you’d have to be very well off to pay out of pocket.

Hey, I’ve got a consult set for next August (2020).  When do you recommend me sending letters in?  I can send a first therapy letter and my doctor’s letter anytime.  I just need the 2nd therapist, and I’m only waiting on that so it’s more current when it’s needed.
</p>
<p>
I don’t want to send things out far too soon, but if doing so speeds the process along, I can do it whenever.  I’m already working on hair removal.

Since you already have your consult, just wait until you see her. They will ask you when you get there and then they will scan them into the system. Letters need to be within a year of your date I believe for insurance purposes. But I think Rachael doesn’t mind as long as you have them and they aren’t from like 10 years ago.
</p>
<p>
I would send them in like a month or so before you actual date though just to be sure they have it on file. And the also bring them with you. They’re super busy and sometimes lose stuff. So just send it electronically so there’s a paper trail. Call them and ask about a month out. And then bring them in.

I was thinking of going with Avenessian (I&#39;m already lined up with her, just need to start electrolysis and set a date) instead, because of the long wait list.. my consultation with BL is in October.
</p>
<p>
This might change my mind, though, if she really will give me a sooner date.. would cost a little extra money that I barely have, but I think I&#39;d prefer BL over Avenessian.

My advice would be to never rush. If there’s a surgeon you really want to go to. Wait. I know it may seem like the end of the world and it’s a long time but it’ll fly by. Trust me. I had to wait 1.5 years since I canceled my original date due to wanting to finish school.
</p>
<p>
My consult with Rachael was in October 17. Got a date for July 18. Then canceled cause of school and got July 19. She’s well worth the wait in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
But make sure you have everything in order when you see her.

Right! Me either!!! It’s when your skin literally falls off faster than it can regrow. So normally skin regrows and you might see some shedding or whatever. But it when one area is doing it all at once and you can literally see skin flaps hanging off. And that’s what happening now to my clit. Lol

Just wanted to say congratulations from a patient of hers who had her vaginoplasty in November 2017. I had the pleasure of being on the roundtable discussion at her session at the Philadelphia Transgender Wellness Conference last week and would happy to answer any questions you might have from someone else who had been through it.

What is your post-op consultation schedule like? If you&#39;re from out of town, when can you realistically go home? (I have my consultation with Rachel in January...aiming for surgery in 2021.)

You stay in the hospital for 5 days after surgery. And then you have to have your own housing within 1-2 hours of the city for 2 weeks from your discharge date. I found a very affordable Airbnb. I have a couple more days until I can go home. August 6th.
</p>
<p>
You have surgery in the main hospital. And then you get moved to a recovery room in the basement that is terrible! Lol. Then you get moved to your own room. With a giant tv. Nice view of the city. And a tablet that controls, ac, tv, lights, blinds and orders your food.
</p>
<p>
When discharged you have an 2 appointments before you’re cleared to go home. Then you have an appointment a month later. Then a month after that. Then 3 months after that. Then a year. They also work with you about scheduling to do more thing at once if you live super far away. I’m only 3 hours away so it’s not that bad for me.
</p>
<p>
The hospital offers a pull out couch. Yes! It’s nice. I had 3 people stay in the hospital. Not at the same time. But they all were comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps... :)

That’s surgeon dependent. But generally it’s gonna depend on the wpath standards if they follow that. But you can get around that with your letters and stuff. You’ll have to ask the docs.

Oh! Haha. She follows the wpath standards. I can’t remember what they exactly are. I think it’s 1 year living full time. On hormones. And then the 3 letters. You can google them and find them pretty easily.
