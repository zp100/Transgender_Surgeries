I&#39;ve not had any luck organising accommodation in Guadalajara for my facial surgery next month. Getting pretty desperate. I want to stay in a recovery house.
</p>
<p>
I am at a loss to where I would go or how I would know where is a good place to stay, so if anyone can help with recommendations or something, that would be very appreciated. Otherwise I will probably just have to book a hotel and use a taxi to get to appointments and surgery and such.
</p>
<p>
The one that was recommended by my surgeon office was
<a href="http://www.restandrecover.com">www.restandrecover.com
</a>
- they used to be used by Dr. Cardenas too, I&#39;m not sure why they have stopped being used. I couldn&#39;t get contact with this recovery house over email and they have stopped responding on whatsapp when I asked if they would provide transport to the hospital I am being treated at. It has also just been weird in general - fake/reused invoice number, all their contact, address and payment details have changed recently, they put the wrong number of nights paid given the dates I asked for. Seems weird.
</p>
<p>
Another I have is
<a href="http://www.recoveryhouseguadalajara.com">www.recoveryhouseguadalajara.com
</a>
<a href="http://www.recoveryhomemexico.com">www.recoveryhomemexico.com
</a>
(same place?). I see no reviews online and they have not replied to my initial email.
</p>
<p>
Please help.

Hello there,
</p>
<p>
Rest and Recover is to be avoided. I recently had my FFS in Dr Cardenas (love him and his fabulous team at hospital innovare).
</p>
<p>
Tyler (
<a href="http://www.transop.com">http://www.transop.com
</a>
) and Vicente (rest and recover) were together once upon a time and ran transop together. After splitting up, Vicente started R&amp;R.
</p>
<p>
My experience with Dr Cardenas has been absolutely fab and he is a truly gifted surgeon who is blessed with a good eye and to be honest, good surgical skills too.
</p>
<p>
The R&amp;R was rather appalling. Vicente was constantly late to everything and even got irate. He was taking painkillers/antidepressants and had these various little young men going into his room (never saw the same one) and had half-eaten plates of food left outside on the table. He had three house attendants sue him and it was a fiasco where he actually had an man’s american passport copy left out on the dining table when he was going to go through some legal motion. It was all incredibly unprofessional. I slept with my room locked and kept my passport close to me.
</p>
<p>
My first outing after the surgery- I was waiting over 3 hours for him to pick me up. I was with his sister who said we should Uber it but I was reluctant. I was in pain and didn’t want to leave the comfort of safe and comfy place where I can sit vs going back to the house where she doesn’t have the key to and is unsure of whether he’d be in or not.
</p>
<p>
When he finally got there, he started screaming- thats when I lost my cool and gave out to him and told him about how he’s putting people at risk, etc. Also fed back to the surgical team and told them I couldn’t believe they recommended him and that because they recommended him, it reflects on him.
</p>
<p>
They took everything onboard and I guess have now stopped recommending him. I’m glad they have. To be honest, it wasn’t safe. I know there are good and bad reviews everywhere. I can go on and on but will probably do up a post here about it. I’m still waiting on him (Vicente) to refund a part of my $ as he said he would. As usual, all talk and no action. He would commit to things but never do them and when I called him out about the same, he changed my dressing once (taught his sister how to do it too) and then sent up some device that would prevent deep vein thrombosis which didn’t work.
</p>
<p>
The sink and kitchen table (and dining table) would have plates of half-eaten food that just attracted flies and mosquitos. Sad, really. Loads of potential but thats what happens when one isn’t in the right headspace. Being a physician, I recognised how this would be in keeping with clinical depression, pointed it out and told him he had to see someone about it if he truly wanted to deal with it head-on. Can’t do anything more than that.
</p>
<p>
Dr Cardenas is going to be opening up his own recovery house- please ask his team (
<a href="http://drlazarocardenas.com/en/welcome/">http://drlazarocardenas.com/en/welcome/
</a>
) NOT Transop (a middle-man) are fabulous. You have the wonderful Elsa who truly goes above and beyond…
</p>
<p>
If Dr Cardenas’ recovery house isn’t open, I would stay at a hotel and Uber. Very doable (I don’t speak Spanish). In fact, I’m planning an abdominoplasty + fat transfer with lipo with Dr Cardenas. If his recovery house isn’t open yet, I would most certainly do just that.

Thanks. This sort of explains a lot of what I was experiencing. It was all massive red flags for me all the way. I think your post will be very useful to others.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve gotten to talking with the other place I talked about by now. I should have somewhere safe to stay now.
</p>
<p>
I did ask Dr. Cardenas about their own recovery house, but I didn&#39;t ask if it would be available to people who were not his patients. Others in my situation might like to ask.

She works with him still, she&#39;s been arranging everything for me and has been really nice, I&#39;m going there really soon. Securing the date was a really frustrating process but I ended up getting an earlier surgery date instead of a later one so I can&#39;t really complain.

I realize you posted this a million years ago, but I’m curious about how the process of securing a date was frustrating. I’m at this part of the process now and just eager to start actually planning.

Who did you make accommodations with? I remember staying at some nice apartments when I went to go see the doctor?
