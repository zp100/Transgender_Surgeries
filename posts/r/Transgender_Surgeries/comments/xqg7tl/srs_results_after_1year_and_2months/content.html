I saw a post saying there are not enough posts regarding SRS when healed, so I wnated to share my experince.
</p>
<p>
I had SRS in Thailand in July 2021 (the Thai method). My surgeon was Dr. Chettawut.
</p>
<p>
While in Thailand I had no complications. When I returned home I had granulation close to the entrance, but it was treated well. My dilatation regime was 3times a day for two months then I did 2times a day. I still try to dilatate twice a day (morning and bed time), but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary this much at this point. My initial depth was declared 6 inches, but with dilating I got to 6,5 which I keep for over a year now. I had my first sex with a guy at month 7 and half. It went quite well even though I was stressed from potential pain. I slept with him once more. He didn&#39;t know I was of MtF experience. There were some rough times as well like around month 4 (depression, urinal infection), but fortunately it got better quickly. So far I am satisfied.

That&#39;s great! You are in a good hands. I did permanent laser removal, because I was not sure what kind of method I wanted and who I will pick as my surgeon. I had no problem with internal hair at all. I don&#39;t think you need to worry. They remove hairs during the surgery.

Thank you! It definitely improved my life. I was living in a shell before, and I wanted to finally live my life to the fullest. Transition is expensive and costs are insane. It should be available via the healthcare system and covered by insurance. I took a loan for SRS as I couldn&#39;t imagine to wait years. It&#39;s not an easy journey, but it&#39;s worth it.

Thank you for bringing us this wonderful  image set! I think you have given all of us a lot of hope for a good outcome for our own surgery. We see all the &#39;disasters&#39; and problematic results, but yours looks just gorgeous!!

Thank you! I am happy I could inspire you and probably others. We shall take SRS posts here with kind of a grain of salt as people post often problematic results because they want to be advised by other redditors on what to do and that’s amazing that we can help each other here. But, it does not represent the overall outcome from SRS surgeries as people who are just happy with the results don’t have the need to post it. They just go with their life. It would be definitely helpful and inspiring to see more of success stories.

Another Chet girl here. I discussed my work might restrict me from 3 per day with Dr Chet and he was happy for me to have less and longer sessions (one two hour per day worked for me, kept it over 6 depth). I treated dilation as &#34;me time&#34;, making sure I could look forward to it by having Netflix,etc., mixed it up nuts and cheese to graze on, and the occasional chocolates and wine. Bubble bath when finished. First six month were most important for me, then reduced the frequency after that. 3 years along and very happy.

Lol GRS Montreals schedule is 4 per day the first month, then 3 for two months, then 2 the next 3 months, then 1 until the 1 year mark, then you slowly reduce to 1 per week unless sexy times.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s excruciating

I just meant practically for yourself. Like with my schedule right now I would need to get up early to do it, so it at night and find some time to do it during the day with work. I’m still new to coming out so there’s a lot I don’t know so I apologize for my ignorance.

Oh you&#39;re on your ass all day litterally, you can&#39;t have a schedule, dilating the first month goes like this.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dilate 30 minutes
</li>
<li>
Bath 30 minutes
</li>
<li>
Dry for like 45 minutes.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So with the transitions and you not necessarily being the most efficient because you&#39;re tired and healing, you spend between 1h45 to 2h per dilation until the wounds are healed. So yeah, first month, that&#39;s 8 hours a day... litterally a full time job.
</p>
<p>
I was lucky enough that I was mostly healed at the month 2 mark and Dr Brassard told me it was ok to skip the drying part or greatly reduce it. That literally changed my life. Being able to dilate without taking forever to dry was so much better...
</p>
<p>
So anyway, what I&#39;m saying is SRS is very intense...

It&#39;s about to get used to dilatation. With time, you create your own regime and now it feels like part of my body care. It&#39;s difficult in first months as you are still not healed enough, it&#39;s exhausting and you deal mentally with this new situation. Once you get over this, it&#39;s something like the brushing your teeth. I was 2 months of work, so to fit 3 dilatations was easy. After that I did one when I woke up and second one before going to the bed.

I have my PPT set up for January 2024. I&#39;ve never had any major surgery so I&#39;m a little nervous with everything still 😖. I&#39;m glad everything turned out great for you. I know the hardest part is keeping up with the dilation schedule, and learning how to get used to everything down there again.

It&#39;s definitely wet inside when you use fingers. With time, vagina creates its own microclimate. Deeper you go, more moisturised it feels. The enterence is the critical point as it&#39;s not that wet. It&#39;s better and recommended to use lubricant for the entrence.
