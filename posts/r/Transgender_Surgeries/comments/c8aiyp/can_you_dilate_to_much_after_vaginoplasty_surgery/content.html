Hello,
</p>
<p>
I’m a few months away from my surgery and have done much research regarding pre and post surgical vaginoplasty. So this thought occurred to me the other day that I don’t remember coming across on reddit or anywhere else so I decided to post about it here. Apologies if this topic has been covered!
</p>
<p>
I’m just curious if it’s possible to dilate for to long at one time? Like if I’m laying on my bed watching tv and not doing anything anyway can I leave it in longer? Will it matter? Will it make it worse?
</p>
<p>
My best friend had surgery 2 years ago and she lost so much depth in her vagina even though she followed the routine dilation process given to her by her surgeon and I’m just worried that will happen with me...
</p>
<p>
Any hands on experience or thoughts please share.
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much!
</p>

After extensive research I believe some patients are simply not meant to survive the scar contraction.
</p>
<p>
I was rapidly losing depth when dilating 12 hours a day after having srs with Suporn. It was unsustainable and the pain next to impossible to endure.

As always thanks for the link!
</p>
<p>
I did look into sigmoid colon, and in fact asked a few fellow asian friends who went to PAI. They listed so many complications they personally are struggling with that I think I will never consider it an option. I think it’s particularly dangerous for me because I am more prone to hypertrophic scars.
</p>
<p>
One of them has a lot of discharge that turns into solid and gets stuck near the end of the colon canal and ferments. Douching thoroughly is difficult because of the consistency of the solid. More than half of the girls have digestive problems because of bowel scar contraction. One of them were sent to the ICU multiple times since the surgery. Another girl had a fistula 6 years after the surgery because the stapled end of the colon slowly ripped open. The list goes on and on...

Are all these complications from sigmoid colon surgery at PAI or does include other surgeons? It&#39;s really hard to find anything on this subject.

They are all sigmoid colon from PAI. Asians are very secretive so I was only able to get this information through personal connections.

Thanks for posting this. There&#39;s so little information on this surgery around you&#39;ve added a lot. Also thanks for what you posted a month ago about Suporn. Its got to be difficult, but it helps others be more fully informed about their choices.
</p>
<p>
Do you have any idea why colon vaginoplasty has such a mixed reputation? It&#39;s always seems to have had a bad image, but I&#39;d seen so few people with actual experience and they are generally positive. I was wondering if it was from many years ago and since changed, but sounds like it&#39;s not.

To be honest I am not so sure, but my best guess is it might have something to do with race/genetics, just as how skin graft srs depends heavily on race/genetics:
</p>
<p>
When people post their experience with SRS, they don’t often share their race. The Suporn discord recently came to the conclusion that Suporn and Bank often mention to Asian patients having trouble with dilation that recovery can be much more difficult for Asians,
<em>
only after the surgery
</em>
. It’s beyond unethical in my opinion but seems rarely talked about due to the lack of Asian clientele with Suporn.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately I was not able to find such information on reddit and went through with the surgery. My recovery turned out to be one of the worst, and I recently went back to Thailand for a checkup. Upon inspection Suporn quickly blamed my Asian genes and offered no help. Had I known about the specific risks of Thai method for Asians, I would have never gotten it done. My rough estimate based on talking with Asian patients from the Suporn discord, only 1 has had a normal recovery, the rest all have suffered/are currently suffering severe issues with dilation, granulation, pain, bleeding, etc.
</p>
<p>
Like I mentioned, more than half of my Asian friends have digestive issues due to internal scar contraction after sigmoid colon srs. IIRC someone in the discord mentioned hypertrophic scars are 15-20x more likely to happen post op in Asians than Caucasians, so I think it’s reasonable to believe the safety of both skin graft and colon srs procedures are affected by patient’s race/genetics. In my opinion, those who are prone to forming hypertrophic/keloid scars should always be recommended against srs.

I&#39;ve added this post to the wiki in several places.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s very little said from any surgeon for any procedure about complications, and I can&#39;t see it changing anytime soon. The best we can do is write our stories somewhere public and let others know. Its not enough, but its a whole lot better than nothing.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s got to be lots of Asians getting surgery with these techniques. Thai people would presumably have the same risks. I don&#39;t see how it could be that bad or surely they&#39;d all talk about it?

From what I have gathered the most popular choices among Asians are PAI, Yanhee, Dr. Kamol, Dr. Thiti, and Dr. Chettawut. Suporn is usually not the option for some reason, my best guess being the high cost. Somehow Chett patients don’t seem to have as much trouble with dilation, even though Chett also uses scrotal graft for the vaginal wall. Some mentioned it has to do with the perforation Suporn performs to avoid hematoma, but I haven’t seen any surgery pictures from Chett to be sure. However I do remember reading about Chett patients experiencing graft failure.
</p>
<p>
In addition it looks like Asians often choose between modified PI, sigmoid colon, and Chett. Not many of them actually know the difference between Chett’s Thai method and modified PI.
</p>
<p>
Suporn is also harder for Asians to access because afaik no 3rd party medical agencies exist elsewhere to facilitate communication other than Japan. PAI and Yanhee for example have their own translators, and Chett works with 3rd party translators as well.

That’s very worrisome since I had sigmoid colon SRS with PAI 8 months ago. I have not had any digestive problems though. I can eat anything and I’m doing fine. I remember taking to Jessie at PAI before leaving, asking about any long term issues that might happen that I should be aware of. He said the only major concern would be vaginal prolapse, which is more likely the older you are when you get the surgery, due to weaker abdominal muscles. Nobody there said anything about the stapled end being slowly ripped open 6 years post op. That sounds scary, but I wonder how that could even happen after all that time? With no warning signs?

The girl who had a fistula had a shorter colon graft, unlike the usual 6+ inch long ones. I heard from a mutual friend that she is a sex worker. She didn’t let me in on how it occurred and simply advised against getting sigmoid colon. I don’t know enough about sigmoid colon vaginoplasty to say with confidence, but my best guess is it might have to do with repeated trauma from sex work.

When I had my sigmoid colon surgery at PAI, they told me they used an 8” graft attached 1.2” deep inside my vaginal introitus. Even then, they warned me not to dilate more than 5 inches deep for at least 2 months to let the deepest part heal properly. I have been very careful and gentle with everything even now.  I suppose the risks for your friend was worse with a shorter graft and sex work. The sigmoid colon is 15-16 inches long. Using as much as 8 inches is still only half the total length and doesn’t adversely affect digestion too badly.

Thank you for the information. Any clue as to why her graft was shorter? I also think taking a longer graft should have been possible.

I don’t know why they would use such a short graft. Maybe they used the laparoscopic surgery for her? She had her surgery at PAI? With which surgeon? My surgeon was Dr Burin and he told me that with open techniques, the result is better and they can use a longer colon graft than with the laparoscopic technique. The downside of course is the scar, but my scar is no different from a Caesarean section scar, and lots of cis women have that. (One third of babies in the USA are delivered by c-section).

Her surgeon was Dr. Burin as well. What’s sad is immediately after surgery one of her labias turned completely black and fell off over time. I think it’s their responsibility to fix it but they still wanted 150,000 baht for it in her case. I hope yours stays problem free since your graft is longer.

To be honest I’m not sure what’s available for me that wouldn’t require a skin or colon graft. I heard peritoneal revision can be done somewhere but that is also prone to contraction. I might just have to wait for tissue engineering to develop.

Yes, and from what I’ve read dilation problems are very common, and the worst cases are really really bad. Suporn seems content with his surgery success rate and doesn’t care much about how much agony the rest goes through.

No such thing. If you want to dilate for 10 hours a day, you can. But not 24 hrs because the tissue needs some time to contract and heal too.

I beg to differ as quite a few recent patients in the Suporn discord have been told by Suporn that they have exacerbated granulation by overdilating. It can have serious consequences.

Ok I will concede on that point, to an extent.  But granulation is basically an injury.  It&#39;s not really fair to say that because of an injury, something that is usually valid is not valid.  We would say it&#39;s healthy to exercise every day, and that would be true, but if your leg was broken, should you jog every day?  Of course not.  Having granulation or some other wound means the regular recovery rules are different.  Plus Suporn&#39;s dynamic dilation method has a way of exacerbating granulation, whereas most other surgeons don&#39;t encourage dynamic dilation.

I don’t understand why there’s a need to compare granulation to an injury and an analogy of exercise with a broken leg. OP asked if one can dilate too much after vaginoplasty, and you answered “no such thing,” period.
</p>
<p>
I added information that shows overdilation is indeed a thing and can have serious consequences.

I think you can tell when you&#39;re having difficulty dilating and you have to do more. Otherwise you can experiment with less. You don&#39;t just follow a rigid schedule as it&#39;s somewhat different for each person and might lead you to not doing enough, or wasting time when you don&#39;t need to.

You

can
</em>
dilate more than they suggest, but according to Bowers it doesn&#39;t accomplish anything except wasting time. Trust me, early on dilating takes up so much time that you&#39;re not gonna

want
</em>
to do it more often anyway!
