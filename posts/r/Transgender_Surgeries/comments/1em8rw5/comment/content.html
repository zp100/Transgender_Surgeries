Reddit keep deleting the general information i gave in OP so here it is:
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been discharged from the hospital 2 days ago and Im recovering in my AirBNB condo for another month :3
</p>
<p>
First i&#39;m incredibly happy. All the girls at Amani are making my experience great. I was really nervous having to travel internationally for the first time ever and it was a 30 hours trip too, 3 flights X_x
</p>
<p>
I invested so much into this and did not know what to expect in reality and with my ADHD that was quite and experience XD
</p>
<p>
I originally went with PPV but changed to Sigmoid pretty much last minute.
</p>
<p>
I actually really liked Dr Theerapong himself, he wasnt all that intimidating and he&#39;s kinda of a funny quirky genius.
</p>
<p>
So Ask me Anything, like even the food... it&#39;s so much better here than in Canada XD Even the McDonalds here taste better and feel like i&#39;m eating food !!
</p>
<p>
In the future I plan to write a collection of free guides and Visual Guides to things that i&#39;m figuring out and being taught that make a huge positive experience to my recovery and what i wish i had prepared before hand.
</p>
<p>
Havent figured out how i&#39;m going to organize myself yet
</p>
<p>
Will be posting post-op pictures, they will be removing my stitches in 2 days, i&#39;ll share that one
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask in private if you&#39;d be more comfortable. &lt;3
</p>
<p>
Love you all and keep walking toward your true selves :3

Why did you decide to switch from PPV to Sigmoid at the last minute?

Because a smaller part of the scrotum is used internally for Colon Sigmoid and I did not have time to remove the hairs fully for it so i wanted no hairs inside.
</p>
<p>
So if youre gonna have PPV start laser and electrolysis early, dont start 3 months before surgery like me XD

Good advice. I jumped right with electrolysis. One to two hours (two hours at the start to clear then one hour later to stay on top of) every week for seven months and I think that was the min I could do. Three more sessions to go and it’s about done. I’d advise anyone to allow a year if they can.

Yeah if I had started a year earlier it would have been ok. If you start even earlier you can do laser no problem it&#39;s painless and quick!

Anyone reading this - if you’re pre gray, get the laser done now! Avoid electrolysis and allow yourself time to see if anything grows back and needs clearing via electrolysis!!!

Yeah Grab for cheap food, grabbing groceries or stuff from pharmacies and alternative taxi service. Bolt is often cheaper for taxi but has longer wait time during rush hours.

<p>
The biggest problem I have to have my need met by Interplast is that they don&#39;t really Speak English or communicate well.
</p>
<p>
If you speak Thai you wont have that problem, but trying to have what you need sorted out by through Interplast directly was quite honestly impossible in my personal experience and the whole point of Sapphira&#39;s thing is resolving all those holes.

Was asked in private if you need to bring maxi pads to not mess up the bed etc, this was my answer to her:
</p>
<p>
They brought me like ... 5 jumbo packs of maxi pads to put underneath me
</p>
<p>
So they&#39;re not telling you to worry about most of the things because they came in here with tons of supplies they provided me and the companion and nurse took care of everything to be honest

Gosh so much.
</p>
<p>
-Rainny come to my condo and arrange and pays for all transport between my place and appointment and picked me up at the airport too
</p>
<p>
-May and Aiza stayed with me 24/7 during the entire hospital stay, constantly there to do everything for you because you cant move at first. That was amazing for me with my ADHD and fibromyalgia.
</p>
<p>
-Sirin comes to my place everyday to clean my wounds and bring me ANYTHING i need. She even went shopping a few times for me for stuff i couldnt get on Grab (Kinda like DoorDash but for everything, even like stuff from their marts)
</p>
<p>
-All the medical supplies needed (gotta love those maxi pads)
</p>
<p>
-Sapphira herself has been there with me for every consults with the doctors to make sure what i wanted was respected. She&#39;s like this amazing enforcer/diplomat that has been ensuring i&#39;m being well treated.
</p>
<p>
-They also were there and walked me into the OR after the partner that came with me to Thailand left the hospital early that day. X_X
</p>
<p>
Honestly if you have any more question about their care package I can help you contact them, I got them on speed dial XD

I can attest to Saphira too, she&#39;s been amazing in answering my questions and helping me book in. That sounds incredible. She emphasised that her goal was to make the trip as stress free as possible and it seems like that&#39;s how it went/is going for you too, that&#39;s awesome to hear 😊

That&#39;s a hard one to answer. Honestly, i had more pain from laying on my back and tailbone than from the surgery itself. So bringing what you need to be comfortable laying down is a pretty good one to prepare.
</p>
<p>
The area itself felt kinda numb with odd sensations because the nerves are adapting. I found the surgery pain quite tolerable.
</p>
<p>
They aren&#39;t shy on giving you painkillers so there is that too.

How were your nerves in the lead up? I booked in yesterday for next march and I&#39;m honestly not sure how I&#39;m gonna handle it 😅 also what was a basic play by play the days following surgery? Like how&#39;d you feel? Any feelings of regret (I&#39;ve heard those pop up for a couple days then go away after a bit?) What did you do? Etc.
</p>
<p>
Also one thing I&#39;m curious about is going to the bathroom post op... like obviously the catheter is in for those situations but I imagine the other would present challenges?

No regret. There was a odd realization that i had crossed the point of no return. Then when looking down i got no dysphoria anymore and the feeling for that is... amazing, hard to describe..
</p>
<p>
Im tearing up in this happy bliss just thinking about it right now.
<br>
It&#39;s... free, happy, peaceful, so deep and beautiful of a feeling that it is s-spiritually connected for me.
</p>
<p>
The &#34;Wow this feel so right&#34; feeling is off the chart.
</p>
<p>
-I was very nervous and excited and determined
</p>
<p>
-Early is.. Sleep, pain killer, Sleep, Pain Killer. For a few days. Kinda zombie. I had my laptop and my phone but i wass only interested in sleeping
</p>
<p>
-What do you mean with the cathether thing? The hopsital had me pee twice on my own without before discharge, that was THE requirement. I managed early so i got discharged very quickly

Thats actually a similar feeling to how I felt after FFS, though i imagine for srs it&#39;ll be a million times that 😅
</p>
<p>
I mean for number 2... there&#39;s no elegant way to ask tbh. We&#39;re you worried about managing it for the first few days? It&#39;s something I&#39;m weirdly stressing over

That&#39;s a fair question honestly, since I did Colon Sigmoid I had to purge the system entirely. Honestly Colon sigmoid recover is easier and when I started eating again the body um..
</p>
<p>
Produced very liquid stool. And if you have any sort of issues there are plenty of ways with dealing with it. Like... not going to sugar coat that one...
</p>
<p>
I bought a like 10 Baht 10 CC enema to clear the clotted blood and after that I had no problem passing stool.
</p>
<p>
So overall yes it did worry me because I have pre-existing difficutlies but actually it&#39;s gone great. My digestive is healthier so far 11 days post open than it was pre-op!

Thats actually a pretty cool positive side effect, lol. I&#39;m already locked in with ppv I think though I have gone back and forth a few times on it. I&#39;m currently booking my hotel right now and watching srs journey videos to try and calm my nerves about it 😅 I&#39;m still like 200 days out though

Yeah &lt;3 I hope it goes well and if you ever want to talk to a girl that went through the process when you&#39;re getting anxy, feel free to reach out!
</p>
<p>
And yeah i ended up switching technique last minute so if your needs change by then you probably can change it unless they dont allow that.

When I did my consult for ffs (next year hopefully) the surgeon estimated the pain in the first 24 hours to be worse than srs, bit them to be an inconvenience. That obviously depends on procedures….

It took maybe 5 days before I could open my mouth to eat anything bigger than a slice of toast, after that I could eat normal things but my lip was numb which made it awkward. It took maybe a couple weeks before it was relatively back to normal

Its very fast, medical services are available abroad, it&#39;s not like in my home country where wait is 2-3 years (Canada) for anything, they had opening within weeks but I wasnt ready so i booked roughly 4 months in advance.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested i could even ask them what the current wait times are, let me know &lt;3

Based on the political situation, the reduced wait time (you’re right I could have had a date in about 4 months at start of the year) was a big determining, as well as the experience of the surgeon.

I liked the results better and what other girls said about how they felt. I liked Dr T in particular because the result look so cis and that feels right to me.
</p>
<p>
I think there are many great surgeons but for me Dr T offered the best for what i wanted
