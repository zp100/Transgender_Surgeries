Respectfully... OMGWTFNFWJFCDAFUQ!?!?!!! HOW!??! That might genuinely be the best result I&#39;ve ever seen. Is Min Jun normally a literal transmutation wizard or did he just get a natural 20 on this occasion?

He is a literal Wizard. If you look at his results in this sub, you&#39;ll see a ton of results just like this (watch out for the smear campaign tho :)

I wouldn’t necessarily call it a smear campaign — someone had a bad outcome and he did show a blatant lack of concern for her. By and large, does Min Jun do good work? Absolutely! I personally think he’s one of the best in the world.
</p>
<p>
But I’m also not going to silence one of my fellow sisters, and claim that she’s just trying to smear/defame his reputation. Her complications and her concerns are just as valid as someone who is injured by Kathy Rumer. I appreciate her — and everyone else — who is willing to speak about their experiences.

She is absolutely trying to smear/defame his reputation. She&#39;s been booted from two discords for bad behavior, this is just what she does, she turns on people at the drop of a hat. There&#39;s a reason why there is only one person shouting that Jun is bad(so much so that people actually believe it) and no one else is. If you were a surgeon would you react positively to people threatening you or would you want to stop working with them?

I’m definitely not going to silence her considering she’s allowed to express how she feels and what she “claims” she went through. I’m aware of the situation and have heard multiple things, read multiple things on the issue and based on what I’ve read and heard it’s a smear campaign and she tells everyone not to go to Dr Jun because she had complications from surgery. Everyone who gets surgery knows the risks it entails and you sign paperwork knowing the risks, also everyone’s body heals differently. I will not speak on it anymore because I’m tired of hearing about it and reading about it because she does have issues and was a problem prior to surgery as well with other surgeons and her behavior on some discords. I don’t need these kind of comments on my post that’s regarding my outcome from my surgery and it causing arguments with others.

I fully agree that her story is valid, but by definition, it was a smear campaign. They posted in multiple places trying to discredit him and even made him go under investigation. Not that her story isn&#39;t valid, it is still a smear campaign because of its execution.

Thats surprisingly good actually. I had a consultation with Dr Wittenberg for PPV and just the surgery itself (with the bot), not even including the anaesthesiologist, hospital stay, etc, literally JUST the surgery, was quoted $125,000!!!!

He&#39;s in the process of opening his own private practice and has gotten free from the Crane Center. His departure was official on October 1, so literally yesterday. His new website is up, but he&#39;s told us to wait for updates in 1-2 months.

Wowza.  Thats an incredible result. I want one too.
</p>
<p>
I have. Couple questions.
</p>
<p>
Age plays a huge role in healing. Whats your age roughly?
</p>
<p>
Was that PPT? I see the small scar on your abdomen from the trochanter
</p>
<p>
Did you have to do electrolysis beforehand and how long did that take? Roughly.
</p>
<p>
Incredible. 🤯

I can answer some of that, as a 3 month post op patient of Jun.
</p>
<p>
We have abdominal scars from the Davinci robot that collects the peritoneal tissue used from the vaginal graft. It leaves five small scars that fade in time.
</p>
<p>
We&#39;re all required to get electrolysis. He has a diagram for it, and he will inspect hair removal during pre op. His requirements are identical to RBL. For me, I needed 40 hours of electrolysis, but I think that is less than average. Individuals that have completed electrolysis are eligible to take sooner surgery dates that open up. Prioritize completing it.
</p>
<p>
For age, I was 39. There seems to be an ideal age from like 27 - 35. If you&#39;re very young or spent your teens on hormonal blockers, the skin is tight or you lack tissue, which makes recovery and dilation challenging. If you&#39;re older, partial effacement of the inner labia is more common as skin is looser. Younger seems to see somewhat better aesthetics, older an easier recovery. Your time on HRT, genital atrophy and original penile size play a big role in labia size/definition too.

Thank you. Im 57 I transitioned before Al Gore invented the internet. 🙄.   I gave up on my dream of waving a magic wand long ago and making it go away.  But things change techniques are better now and its time.
</p>
<p>
I believe PPT is right for me and Dr Jun will be my surgeon 🤞 this post and others like it have really set it in stone for me.

<p>
Thanks for the additional details.

That’s amazing! I don’t hVe the same surgeon but I hope mine ends up half as good as that! My surgical team uses the same method though so I’m hoping for good results.
