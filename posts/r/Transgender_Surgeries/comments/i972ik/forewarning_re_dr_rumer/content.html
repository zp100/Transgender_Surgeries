Before I knew all the horror stories I had considered dr rumer, but when I told my primary care doctor this she flat out told me she would refuse to write my letter for surgery for dr rumer.  So I picked a different surgeon and crisis averted.  Thankfully my doctor was looking out for me

It&#39;s worth pointing out that being a DO versus an MD is not necessarily a bad thing. The educational requirements are the same for each and the two diplomas are interchangeable as far as licensing goes. Dr. McGinn is also a DO, after all, and she produces  pretty consistently excellent results.
</p>
<p>
<br>
That being said, it is very concerning that she is not board-certified as a plastic surgeon. And while I do know someone personally who had a very positive experience with her, I have also heard from an alarming number of other people reporting complications and poor results. Anyone thinking of seeing her should definitely consider her history carefully when making their decision.
</p>
<p>
<br>
(Personally, after what I&#39;ve read here, I wouldn&#39;t let her touch me with a pair of chopsticks. But that&#39;s just me.)

McGinn is certified by the same board as Rumer: the American Osteopathic Board of Surgery, through which they&#39;re both certified in plastic surgery. DOs most often get certified by one board, MDs most often by another, and the MD OP consulted with seems to look down on the AOBS certification and basically told OP it&#39;s not &#34;real&#34;.

I don&#39;t know about FFS, but my electrolysis tech, who has a bunch of trans women as clients, specifically told me that she has heard several horror stories from people who had vaginoplasty with Dr. Rumer.

She is the same as Bart Van de Ven. He is mutilating transwomen for money and lures in victims with his dodgy marketing and aggressive advertising. Both need to be eliminated from the world of transgender surgeries.

Well, DOs have their own plastic surgical training.  There are other DOs such as (I think) McGinn, Leis, Speigal, etc.   I don’t know that Rumer’s degree or training is the problem.  Not all surgeons have talent.  Years ago, there was a dr. In Pittsburgh who “butchered” a number of women.  I forget who is the current “Butcher of Bankok,” but there have been a few of those.   The thing is that no college program really teaches srs techniques.   In the US med school, they train for a bit with either Meltzer or Marcie.  (Marcie was taught by Biber who was the big srs surgeon for many years) Then they are on their own.  Some are talented surgeons who develop a standard procedure with consistant results (say Brassard who was trained by Menard).  Others are hit or miss and then there are the “butchers” who tend to have a high number of poor results.

Jeez. Quite interesting that Dr. Rumer is a &#34;featured&#34; surgeon (and shows prominently in the search results), yet the only other PA doc I know (McGinn) is nowhere to be seen.

I&#39;ve heard from multiple people that she has been caught using pics of other surgeons work claiming it as her own. She also had no idea what nerve hookup for phalloplasty was even though it is the standard now.
<a href="https://gendercube.tumblr.com/post/122393463527/bottom-surgery-information-kathy-rumer" rel="nofollow">Here&#39;s
</a>
a post about her not knowing basic info about ftm bottom surgeries.
</p>
<p>
Side note, doctors of osteopathy are just as good as MDs and they can be board certified. Dr Rumer sucks but don&#39;t be scared of going to a good surgeon just because they&#39;re a DO.

My insurance company is pressing me to go with her or another one in my network if I don&#39;t want to pay $11K+ out of pocket to go with Dr. Cicuto. I already knew she wasn&#39;t to be trusted years ago when I heard someone say they almost went to her and then reconsidered when they attempted to have them commit insurance fraud to get their surgery covered. Fuck that.

You only get one shot at this...  you are better off keeping the donor tissue until you can pay or more docs are accepted by your insurance.

Amoung all of this she&#39;s the first doctor to take my advice, come back with an answer after some quick research and modify my meds accordingly. Unfortunately this recommendation was based on financial needs, buuut my health and happiness far outweighs that. Thanks for the concern!

She is board certified, just not by ABPS. That has little to do with her being incompetent and unethical.

I just had my surgery with Dr Rumer and I went with despite everything I’ve been reading. Everything I have read is complete opposite of my experience and my result! Through all the surgeries I have had related to being trans and not I have never had a better surgical team than Dr Rumers team. She is extremely knowledgeable answered every question I had (and I had a lot) she reassured me the entire time. I also had some complications that was MY FAULT and she was understand and reassured me she would get me through it and she did. Her office staff are phenomenal as well with everything and getting back to me quickly. She is not the first surgeon I had went to and I can tell you the other surgeon had the highest ratings and I dealt with them for 2 years and I was nothing more than a dollar sign to them. Thankfully I found Dr Rumer. At one of my follow up appt while waiting my turn there was another patient that was doing nothing but complaining about everything including the hospital gave them a rx for pain pills when released instead of actual pills and they felt that Dr Rumers office should have been the one to pay for their travel and lodging!!?? At first I thought it was a joke because I couldn’t believe that someone truly thinks that’s how things work or even should work! I really is heart breaking that people put such bad reviews on her and most of what I read was completely untrue. They give you a detailed packet on everything including before and after surgery instructions. They give you a list of all complications that can happen and if you know anything about any surgery anything is possible with complications. They also give you detailed instructions before discharge. And if you do what she tells you it will lower your percentage with complications. She is NOT a predator on the trans community she cares about people and helping them!!

I&#39;m glad you had a good experience with her, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that she has harmed and preyed on a lot of trans people. She spreads misinformation about bottom surgery and trashes RFF/ALT because she doesn&#39;t understand or denies the existence of nerve hookups. She has a bad reputation for a reason.

For people who may be reading this in the future, this comment is most likely fake and this user&#39;s comments have been hidden in other threads for being probable fakes.
</p>
<p>
Watch out for comments praising certain surgeons (ESPECIALLY DR. RUMER) that come from new accounts, especially accounts that only praise that surgeon. That is highly suspicious. Know that a lot of surgeons WILL try to infiltrate our spaces to take advantage of us. Stay safe y&#39;all.
