There’s is no reviews on Dr.Kathryn Ashley Brandt so I guess I’ll be the first 💜
</p>
<p>
I had single stage penile inversion vaginoplasty with Dr.Brandt on Jan. 7th 2022 in Reading Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p>
Today I seen her for my 3 week post op visit and she says everything is healing great which is good 👍🏻! (I have been seeing her weekly since the surgery)
</p>
<p>
I was in the hospital for 3 days after the surgery, and honestly haven’t had much pain throughout this whole journey. I had pressure packing on for the first 2 days (which sucked and was very uncomfortable) also I had a catheter, 2 blood drains and packing in my vagina for a week, after a week I started dilating n not gonna lie it sucked. It was mentally draining n made me a lil depressed but it wasn’t long before I snapped out of it n reminded myself that I wanted this surgery and now I have to do my part to keep up with it ! I am dilating 4 times a day,  10 mins with the purple dilator  10 mins with the blue dilator  10 mins with the green dilator After my visit next week I can start dilating 3 times a day ( so excited for that ! )
</p>
<p>
Dr Brandt gave me 6 inches of depth :) Aesthetically things are looking good so far, as I am still very much healing I can’t give my final judgment yet but so far I am very happy with the results. Everyone who has seen it says it looks natural and as if I was born with it so I’ll take that 💕. I should also mention I do have sensation especially in my clit it actually feels kinda good already lol .
</p>
<p>
Dr.Brandt said if there is anything aesthetically  that I would like to change once I’m healed, it will be a very easy fix and is more than happy to do cosmetic revision.
</p>
<p>
Dr.Brandt is an amazing person and her personality is just as amazing, I’m so happy I chose her and I think she deserves to be out there more ! Her work and technique is beautiful 🤩 , I have decided to not post pictures of my results yet because I don’t feel comfortable with showing people yet but when it heals I will most likely show off my results 🌸 if you are in the PA area and looking for SRS surgeons I would definitely have a consult with Dr.Brandt 🥰

Does Dr.Kathryn Ashley Brandt have a private practice? I am asking because I couldnt find a single mention of transgender care on the Tower Health web page. It is possible I just missed it.

I had originally been thinking about going with Dr Rumor, but I am seeing a concerning number of negative experiences with her. This makes me sad because one of the big selling points for me with her was that she claims no need for genital hair removal before surgery due to cost and lack of access to regular reliable travel the thought of not needing to try and figure that out too was appealing.

She doesn’t have a private practice but she does work out of Reading Hospital. She is amazing and also lets you choose if you wanna do hair removal or not . I didn’t do hair removal and I’ve been fine . You can find her here
