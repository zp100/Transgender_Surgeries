How did you feel about the Doctors/Staff? PostOp care? Final results: Sensation? Appearance?  Thanks :)

I made a documentary about mine:

The staff was super kind. I&#39;d say the results were okay, but I&#39;m about to get a revision (and I&#39;d say you should expect one). Let me know if you have any other questions.

I was a caregiver for a friend who went there in November 2017 with Dr. Slama. She had neovaginoplasty with him - penile inversion and she already had her orchiectomy years before.
</p>
<p>
She was not satisfied and she had to go back for I think 4 revisions. I found the day nurses rude and overworked, while the night staff was great. She was mispronouned in the surgery room and in her recovery room, not by Dr. Slama but by other staff. I&#39;ve been in a lot of hospitals, and I found bedside manner to be pretty gruff. It took her many many months to have sensation.
</p>
<p>
I found Mt. Sinai in NYC to be way more attentive and skilled.

For what it&#39;s worth, in 2019, it appears things have improved!
