I had been reluctant to post anything further on this sub-reddit for the simple fact that last time, there were comments that my results were a &#34;fake&#34; and I needed to show &#34;proof&#34; that it&#39;s real. Let me make this clear, I am posting photos of my surgery (like many others) for the purpose to inform. I find it highly invasive and borderline harassment that after posting photos of my vagina in a public forum that I have to show more &#34;proof&#34; of its validity.
</p>
<p>
Saying that, this week has been physically and emotionally hard. Tuesday night (3rd) I had a medical scare. After a week of dilating with no issues, that night I oddly had trouble getting the dilator in. After trying to get it to the third dot (purple) a pool of blood came pouring out of vagina onto my pad. This scared the hell out of me. It was not the usual discharge I normally was seeing, it was dark red, and there was a lot of it.
</p>
<p>
I debated calling an ambulance, and the owner of the place I am staying helped me clean up. I was up till 1:30 am. Fortunately, I had my surgeon appointment the next day, and opted to wait till then.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Avanassian examined me, and she said that it was probably a hematoma that I hit (clotted blood that was present in my vagina from the surgery). She thinks it wasn&#39;t something to worry about (as she was pulling clotted blood from my vagina). She told me to monitor it, but unless I have constant bleeding, it was pretty normal what happened.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to say that this was a one time incident, and dilating hasn&#39;t been an issue since that scare.
</p>
<p>
Going through this recovery is strange. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before, and so knowing what is normal, what is okay, and what is something to worry about is never really clear. That is why forums like these are essential.
</p>
<p>
You truly don&#39;t know what you are up against until you go through it first hand. Only some much can be conveyed through words and pictures, but I have to state that you will have to be okay with dealing with continuous physical discomfort, a great deal of uncertainty, boredom, and a sense that you are completely dependent on others to live. This really hit me hard emotionally this week.

As someone that also went to Avanassian, I just want to say that your results look a lot like mine and like most results I have seen from her. Nothing fake at all!

Can I ask a question? Is it normal to be terrified? It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôll just be me there other than a private nurse to take care of me after surgery

Absolutely, I was scared, especially the night before. It‚Äôs a huge life decision, and it‚Äôs a new situation where you‚Äôre not sure how you‚Äôre going to handle the recovery. Since you will be alone I think you should bring some kind of comfort item (I brought my teddy bear), or have a dedicated person (friend, family, partner) to be able to remotely be there for emotional support. It will be one of the most physically and emotionally challenging things you will ever do.

I‚Äôve been following her results for a few weeks now and honestly I haven‚Äôt seen any other surgeon who‚Äôs work I prefer more. Not to mention people say she‚Äôs extraordinarily nice and warm! Hoping to try to book her for grs when I have the means to take enough time off work.

100% agree with you, she has been absolutely warm and caring throughout this process. She cares about her patients and how they recover.

Your results look truly amazing! I&#39;m so happy for you üòä
</p>
<p>
I have been really conflicted lately in terms of whether I want some form of bottom surgery or not. I have been scared by some of the horror stories I&#39;ve heard, but after reading about your experience and seeing your stunning results even at this early stage it has really helped me feel a lot better about it all!
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much for sharing and good luck with the rest of your recovery ‚ô•Ô∏è

Your results are absolutely beautiful. That‚Äôs probably why you received hate from some people... they may not be as fortunate as you with their results, and their envy caused them to doubt you.  Congratulations, that is one fine vulva!

I have not had a vaginal plastic however I am recovering from a scrotectomy.
</p>
<p>
one of the things I wanted to point out that was informed to me was the fact that dark blood usually means old blood, which is good, it&#39;s your system trying to heal and coagulate and get rid of unnecessary &#34;goop&#34;
</p>
<p>
Glad you&#39;re okay

It looks really amazing! My cis boyfriend glanced over while I was looking at the picture and he misstook it for my afab vulva. The result is very very natural and pretty! I wish you the best for the rest of the healing period.

Whoever harassed and bullied you should be banned. This should be a zero tolerance safe space. Being trans is hard enough we don&#39;t need to be bullied by cis people and especially other trans people. Unfortunately not all trans people are amazing and have a sister/brotherhood like I wrongly assumed when I first came out. We should have nothing but love and support for one another.
