First off I identify as Non-Binary Genderfluid, and my overall transition goals are as such.
</p>
<p>
So uh yeah almost 1 day post, my surgery was yesterday at 12pm and it took a bit over 3hrs. I havnt seen her yet but Ramineni said she turned out beautiful 😍  I&#39;ll have a better idea once the bandages are off.
</p>
<p>
The epidural was placed fantastic and the night staff night 1 was awesome 😁
</p>
<p>
The room is a bit warm but all else is good.

Congratulations! Hope recovery goes well. I have scheduled my surgery with him for May 2024. Please keep sharing updates. It is great to learn about the results from Dr. Ramineni.

Oh that so exciting. Happy for you 🥰 He&#39;s a truly lovely person. He&#39;s good at stuff and believes in the cause.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a big girl 5&#39;5 340 and he took me on no problem, didn&#39;t even bring up my weight once. And if you havnt seen him in person, watch out you will come away with a big squish. 🤭

Dr.Ramineni only does PIV (penile inversion vaginoplasty) but he&#39;s damn good at it. And if your high BMI he won&#39;t even bat an eye 🥰

He does modified piv which uses a scrotal graft.  He leaves the vaginal dome open to the peritoneum.   You are able to dilate into the peritoneum.   He views srs as neccessary life saving surgery, and will operate on higher bmi patients.  He goes through things fast,  but will slow down and be sure all of your questions are answered.  Pre or post op if needed insist he slow down and have your questions answered and concerns addressed.

Really happy to hear you’re feeling good. Please judge him not on day 1 but on day 30. And be persistent with him if anything goes even remotely wrong or unexpected.

Even if I judged him day 1 he would still review awesomely 🥰
</p>
<p>
I was in despair before i came across them as my size is important to my Gender identity and they never hesitated 🥹
</p>
<p>
I also know atleast a dozen people who have been through with glowing reviews
