Hey everyone, I&#39;m back again.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/loq3xv/struggling_with_terrible_surgery_outcome_and/">Here&#39;s the last post I made
</a>
when I was going through serious depression over my results and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/kuuu8u/my_ongoing_experiences_with_dr_gast_post/">here is the last post
</a>
I made specifically discussing things about my time with Dr. Gast.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The short version if you don&#39;t want to click through: I got botched by Dr. Gast.
</strong>

</p>
<hr>
<p>
Now here&#39;s my general question because at this point, I&#39;m still a few months out before I can try to see a surgeon for revisions and my anatomy has confused me now beyond all belief.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/KnlV1Ds">Here are some pictures to accompany this explanation.
</a>
<strong>
NSFW Warning
</strong>
</p>
<p>
So, this will sound weird, but I cannot figure out if my partner has been sounding me on accident or not. We can easily see my clit and clitoral hood and it seems like there&#39;s a small hole/dot underneath that.
</p>
<p>
Then, further down, I seem to have some erectile tissue.
<strong>
However
</strong>
we seem to be able to put decently large objects (pinky sized) at least three inches deep into it.
<strong>
Then
</strong>
further down after a gap of skin, is my actual vaginal canal.
</p>
<p>
We&#39;ve been able to basically double penetrate both of these areas. I&#39;ve never sounded in my life so I&#39;m not like, pre-stretched there so things should fit in easily.
</p>
<p>
So now I&#39;ve been utterly confused and think that somehow, Dr. Gast messed up SO thoroughly, I literally was given an extra hole. Could anyone more knowledgeable on how/where body parts go during pen ile inversion help me out? Or maybe folks post-op could share their body experiences?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just utterly lost at this point and want to understand what the hell is going on with my body...
</p>
<p>
(P.S. Don&#39;t go to Dr. Gast, official recommendation here. I keep hearing similar horror stories happening to others, so I highly suggest avoiding.)

This is weird, but could you try urinating in front of a mirror in the shower or something, to see where it comes from? Sorry this has happened to you.

I tried the mirror method and it seems to be coming from higher up?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s very hard to tell with how messed up Gast left things.

Is it your urethra? My surgeon warned me that they’d had people try to dilate / stick things in their urethra because they weren’t familiar with their new anatomy. You can apparently get a decent distance in with something moderately sized, although it may hurt. Its roughly where &amp; what you’re describing.

(Note: I went to a different surgeon)

See, I can&#39;t quite tell. We think we see the actual urethra higher than it, but I&#39;m unsure.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s hard to tell with how messed up Gast left things. That&#39;s part of why I&#39;m asking though, I don&#39;t want to hurt myself down there if I am. Knowing bigger things can manage for a bit like, well. It gives me an idea at least!

I don’t see how saying “stop blaming Dr Gast” is constructive to the conversation. If other people seem to also be having less than favorable results than they expected, and choose to name the surgeon, that seems like a personal decision.
</p>
<p>
Many people come here to ask about experiences people have had with surgeons and to see some of their work to get a better understanding of what their results will look like. It’s an important part of this sub.
</p>
<p>
OP I wish you the best though I don’t have the answers!

Not sure where the judgement is coming from here, but Dr. Gast have me BAD results and I&#39;m not the only one it&#39;s happened to.
</p>
<p>
Part of why I tried to even ask here is because doing this has been the closest thing to pleasurable insertion at all as my vaginal canal in near useless thanks to her work.
</p>
<p>
And yes, it&#39;s hard to see where anything is when it&#39;s buried WAY too deep into overtightened skin and even trying to spread your labia hurts.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Gast gave me a botxh job. Every other doctor I&#39;ve seen has told me as much. I don&#39;t intend to sugar coat it.

I think she placed the urethra too, high and then there is that land bridge to what I suppose is the actual vagina.  Plus there is excess errectile tissue.  It also seems the outer labia are underdevoloped and ill defined.  On the bright side, whatever she has done has healed and is not infected.   I think you can and shuld get it revised, but NOT by her.   She is relatively new and the problem is the training for docs is focused on the initial surgery.  For repairing a botch they have to rely on skill and experience.
