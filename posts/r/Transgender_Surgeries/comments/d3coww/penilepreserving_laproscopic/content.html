<em>
(see post history for previous entries about this surgery)
</em>
</p>
<p>
This post covers week 2 post-op - basically just dilation, douching, healing, and avoiding complications. An important note - it&#39;s the
<em>
same
</em>
post-op schedule as normal vaginoplasty. The surgeon thinks that the peritoneal tissue should mean less dilating &amp; no douching, but to be safe she&#39;s putting everyone on the same post-op treatment until she has more data.
</p>
<h1>
Dilation
</h1>
<p>
Pretty standard - 3x daily, 10-30 minutes. I use the smallest one (purple) and my depth is at the second dot from the handle. I haven&#39;t measured it but from eyeballing it I&#39;d say 5-6inches. I&#39;m not really interested in working up to the super wide dilators (seriously, the orange one is ridiculous) but I suppose I should at least go up to the blue one.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a little annoying having my penis &amp; scrotum in the way of dilating. Thank god I have a hand mirror.
</p>
<p>
It takes ~2-3 minutes (maybe less sometimes) to get the dilator all the way inside. Every time it&#39;s a little different. The first several times were scary, as you didn&#39;t really know if you were breaking something or not. By now I&#39;m not anxious but it&#39;s still uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s surprising how much I can feel inside, even now. The peritoneal tissue doesn&#39;t have tactile sensation like your outer skin does, but you still feel the dilator the whole way in. It&#39;s much more sensate than your butt. It reminds me a bit of putting things in your mouth actually haha. I&#39;m excited to learn fine muscle control in the future once things heal more.
</p>
<h1>
Douching
</h1>
<p>
1x daily for week 2, every other day for week 3, and then once a week after that. I think at 3 months I&#39;ll try stopping douching if the secretions are acidic enough.
</p>
<p>
Douching is easy and painless and actually feels a bit tickly.
</p>
<h1>
Healing &amp; (Avoiding) Complications
</h1>
<p>
Week 2 was dubbed the &#34;swelling week&#34; by Dr. Wittenberg. Apparently this week is the worst for swelling &amp; has the highest risk of wound separation (eek!). Luckily nothing happened to me.
</p>
<p>
Besides wound separation, the sight of my vagina was probably the most frightening part of it all LOL. You see all the post-op pictures and are prepared for it, but you still can&#39;t believe &#34;that&#34; will heal into something that will look nice.
</p>
<p>
Funnily enough though I&#39;m already happy about the surgery. It&#39;s very annoying having to keep the scrotum around, but my genital dysphoria is already lessening. I can tell this was the right thing to do. I just
<em>
can&#39;t wait
</em>
for the labiaplasty.
</p>
<h3>
Pads
</h3>
<p>
This deserves its own sub-section!
</p>
<p>
Pads are so frustrating. Probably doubly so since I still have my penis &amp; scrotum.
</p>
<p>
Their sizing &amp; absorbancy is arbitrary, relative only to their other products. I&#39;ve bought two different pads off Amazon, both of which were way too big. Right now I&#39;m just using more &#34;abdominal pads&#34;, like the ones they give you in the hospital. They&#39;re available on Amazon in different sizes, and feel better than normal pads.
</p>
<h3>
Sexy Times
</h3>
<p>
This also deserves its own section, as it&#39;s the hardest thing for me right now. I honestly wish my libido had been affected, because it&#39;s hard mentally staving off arousal.
</p>
<p>
According to the surgeon, my butt and vagina are off-limits for the first 3 months, and everything else is off-limits for some shorter period of time (the first month I think?).
</p>
<p>
Well, I couldn&#39;t restrain myself that well - as a compromise, I give myself one penis-only orgasm a week. I can comfortably say that my penis is working 100%. There&#39;s some temporary numbness on the bottom near the base, but it normal otherwise.
</p>
<h1>
Outstanding Questions I Can&#39;t Answer Yet
</h1>
<p>
There&#39;s a few questions that I&#39;m sure people want to know, that I can&#39;t answer yet:
</p>
<h4>
Peritoneal lubrication/secretion?
</h4>
<p>
No idea yet, there&#39;s discharge from a lot of things.
</p>
<h4>
Sexy stuff besides penis functionality?
</h4>
<p>
I won&#39;t know for at least ~2 months.
</p>
<h4>
Pictures?
</h4>
<p>
I&#39;m not uploading pictures now, but that may change in the future.
</p>
<h4>
Future Post Schedule?
</h4>
<p>
I intend to cover the entire healing experience, but I&#39;m not sure how frequently I&#39;ll post. I&#39;ll post again next week about week 3, and then probably week 4, and then probably month-to-month. Around the labiaplasty I&#39;ll start posting more frequently again.

<p>
That dot should be roughly 5.5 inches if I remember correctly.

Awesome! I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s going well! The updates are much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
I saw Dr Wittenberg today for a second consult/early pre-op visit. We decided on something between all at once and 2 stage. Gonna go for an upside down V suture instead of the default Y suture pattern. But she&#39;s gonna err on the side of leaving excess material because I have a long perineum, and a revision will probably be needed anyway.
</p>
<p>
I should be home recovering in less than a month! I&#39;m looking forward to hearing more about your recovery while I wait!

Hm interesting. Why not just 2-stage?

Funnn! Can&#39;t wait to compare recovery notes :P. Hopefully your recovery is as boring as mine is.
