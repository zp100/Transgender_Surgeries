Hi, I am looking at having srs in 2024 (hopefully), and have primarily been looking into Dr Bank as my first option. I have come across some positive stuff about Dr Sutin however and was wondering whether anyone had any info or opinions about pros/cons of each doctor
</p>

Apples and oranges really as they both use different techniques.  You will find that Sutin is considerably cheaper, but that his post op care is negligable in comparison to Banks.
</p>
<p>
Dr Bank is an acolyte of the famous Dr Suporn and he specialises in the Non Penile Inversion method.  This has spectacular results, easily best in business, but the recovery can be brutal and will easily endure for 12 months.  It is also very expensive  - upwards of 18K USD. The wait list is minimum 1 yr, but is by first in basis so the non tech savvy may wait longer.
</p>
<p>
Dr.  Sutin is a member of the PAI team and as such his primary surgeries are Penile Inversion ( plus Scrotal flap) or Sigmoid Colon Vaginoplasty.  He will also perform Zero Depth PIV. He is an excellent surgeon but does not have the consistency of Dr.  Bank.  He is considerably cheaper ( 9.5k USD ) and has a wait list considerably shorter at 2- 3 months.

No he does not, unfortunately, and the colon procedure is 18k.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going with PIV because of the wait, but also because of the recovery time, since my job is physically demanding
