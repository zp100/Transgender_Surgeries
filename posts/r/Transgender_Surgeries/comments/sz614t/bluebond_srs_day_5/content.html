I got value out of reading other people&#39;s vaginoplasty experiences with bluebond and Zhao, so I thought I&#39;d share my own. AMA as well
</p>
<p>
Common questions and some thoughts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
called and scheduled consult I think in February 2020, don&#39;t remember the initial date it was scheduled for though
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I got my letters in shortly after. one from my therapist (a psy d), my HRT provider, and a social worker at a local LGBT center
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
first video consult was November 2020. It was initially scheduled for the following year, but they called me to let me know there was a cancellation and would I want it. You can also call to check for cancellations regularly, but I only did that a few times and was unsuccessful
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
after that, in person physical was May 2021 and had surgery date of February 2022. Physical could have happened really any time before surgery, and May was actually pretty great as it was pre Delta exploding
</p>
</li>

I had done 6-8 genital laser sessions prior to my physical and then let my hair grow out for like two months prior to my physical, so they could see the growth. With about half a second of looking BBL indicated I was good. It&#39;s hard to tell since the paperwork indicates that they want all hair removed and I still had a smattering of dark hair and some light hair. I&#39;m a pretty good candidate for laser with fair skin and dark hair. Insurance theoretically covers this but I have yet to have it be successful after many months and my employer trying to get it approved. It&#39;s a gigantic pain.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
around September 2021 I thought I had perhaps too much dark hair, so I sent them a message with a picture and they said I should start electro, which should clear it up in time for surgery. I didn&#39;t count but I think I did about 15-20 hours of electro total from end of September to end of the year. 1.5-2h was about the sweet spot to clear everything every other week. By surgery time there were no issues. I have pictures I sent BBL to check if it was too much if it helps others, but no pre op photos
</p>

I&#39;ve never been inpatient at a hospital before and I did not enjoy it. I think overall I had about as good of a stay as one can have? But no one has a good time being in the hospital for five days. Being woken up regularly, on top of not being able to sleep well because of the discomfort/pain, made it pretty hard to regulate emotion by the end. I have a medium pain tolerance and the final day was brutal for me. Days leading up to it can be hard because of all the meds they give you, which have side effects that can be treated by other meds, but might need to be filled by the pharmacy which can take 3-4 hours sometimes. The first night I had a migraine and had to wait 4h to get some medicine from the pharmacy that I had in my backpack a few feet away from me. Miserable ðŸ˜”

on my last day it felt like my labia was about to burst and I&#39;d be featured on
<a href="/r/popping">/r/popping
</a>
. It was not fun. There was apparently a hematoma that developed on the right side of my labia. It wasn&#39;t a concern but was extremely painful. I&#39;m able to walk quite a bit but am walking very noticeably John Wayne style. ðŸ¤ž tomorrow is better.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
each day in the hospital was better than the last, but day 0 was pretty brutal. I couldn&#39;t get up first day post op and just re adjusting my hips could be pretty painful, but each day got better and by day 3 I was doing eight laps around the floor at a time. There would be sharp pain near my vagina and pain in my abdomen presumably where they harvested tissue. Now it&#39;s significantly better
</p>

Airbnb offers discounts if you book a month or more, which I found to be cheaper than many long stay hotels and situated better. Unfortunately less than 48h before we were supposed to walk through the door, our host canceled on us for unspecified reasons. Airbnb offered a $200 credit. When I mentioned that all the month long rentals that were still available were significantly more, they offered to comp a week of the new rental which made it work out to be about even.
</p>

my GP did my pre surgery medical clearance about a month before surgery. At first my blood pressure was likely too high to operate, so they put me on some new meds and re evaluated two weeks later. At that point I was cleared by her. Unfortunately two days prior to surgery I received a call from NYU indicating that the hadn&#39;t received it yet. I called my GP, they faxed it again, and it was fine. But at this point I was a little grumpy about the last minute complications.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
other posts had mentioned issues with nurses, but at least my particular nurses at my particular time were uniformly fantastic and I can&#39;t say enough good things about the entire staff
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I have 8&#34; of depth, which is apparently about the max expected
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some advice:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
do things as early as you can, because things will go wrong. Get your letters in as soon as you can, because it helps move you up the queue. Get your medical clearance done early, because there might be complications. Get your hair removal done early, because again it might take longer than you think. Informing NYU that hair removal is done can also move you up
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
put together the order of post op stuff you need early, because you might be worn tf out when you&#39;re discharged. My partner handled this for me
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
bring an extension cord and a long charger for the hotel room. I didn&#39;t have the spoons to play games or read, but I brought my phone to fuck around on TikTok and my iPad to watch shows. You can watch Netflix on their tablet with your login though so this isn&#39;t strictly necessary
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
other people say to bring dresses etc to wear afterwards, but it&#39;s freezing in NYC in February so miss me with that. Bring some loose sweats. If you want to fit in with the NYC fashion elite I also recommend bringing some socks and crocs
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
fr don&#39;t underestimate the amount of pads and TP you might go through after discharge
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
having a helper person can be very helpful. Again even if you&#39;re relatively independent normally, your mind might be kind of mush or you might have complications. Can&#39;t overstate how helpful my partner has been so far
</p>
</li>

<p>
there&#39;s a Lego store in midtown. I saved up for fancy kit to occupy my time while I&#39;m here. It seems like a good idea but I suppose we&#39;ll see. Still gotta finish it and get it home ðŸ˜…

Congratulations and thank you for sharing. Would you mind sharing your experience when you walked into the OR? How did that go?

I was rolled in on a bed, had a brief period of time to notice how high tech the room looked. Then the v nice anesthesiologist I had met earlier that day put a mask on, asked me to take a few deep breaths, and that was the last thing I remember. Pretty short amount of conscious time in the OR. I didn&#39;t have much/any anxiety going into it though so ymmv.

It was kind of anxiety-inducing that I had to
<em>
walk
</em>
into the surgery room with an escort. My previous experiences with surgery led me to believe that I laid down on a bed, and was later wheeled into my OR - and I was able to kind of &#34;check out&#34; mentally while they moved me.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the long walk into the surgery hall felt like a perp walk ðŸ˜‚.
