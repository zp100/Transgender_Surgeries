Saw some outdated information on here.  Just got out of a consult with her last week.  She does do PTP now!!!!! ( so many different ‘definitions ‘ of it going around so you can ask - she will explain )
</p>
<p>
I asked about complications.  We went through each one.   Near Zero
</p>
<p>
No pictures as she ‘hadn’t put her portfolio together’  BUT will show me next time.
</p>
<p>
AVG Wait — she said assuming I had everything done - letters and electrolysis —  surgery would be Jan 22
</p>
<p>
Letters ‘ one doesn’t ‘ HAVE’ to be a PayD but two therapy letters.
</p>
<p>
Post op —-  interestingly enough  she gives you an epidural for constant pain meds after surgery for the first few days which is I think lovely!!!  She said it’s better than narcotics that make you constipated and that makes sense.
</p>
<p>
Overall —  she’s very reassuring and very confident!  My only hang up is the results —  yea results may vary for each but it helps.  (  if anyone wants to DM me their results of GCS I’m not going to stop you  haha :)
</p>
<p>
That’s all the info I have so questions are best asked to her.

Found that last night     Wanted to give more recent info  :)    Any way to delete outdated old information ??  I’d hate for people to not go to her or  consider her cause they read some old info  :)

I just add new stuff. Anyone considering a surgeon should be reading all of it and work out it out for themselves.

If someone is researching surgeons, they should do enough legwork to figure out which info is old and which is new. A lot of the time it’s really informative to learn how surgeons have updated their techniques over time, and understanding the history of the surgeon can often be really useful. I personally like the wiki the way it is, plus it would take incredible effort for one person to work out all that info, and I think it’s unreasonable to expect. It’s much more reasonable to expect people researching surgeons to put in the work themselves, especially when they already have such a great resource at their disposal.

Sorry, I misread the tone of your comment. I do think that the more information the better, so it&#39;s great that you&#39;ve added this! And good luck on your surgery!

How long did it take for the surgery scheduler to call you ? I’ve been waiting for like 2 weeks now.

Did you get a referral to see her?  That the only way she schedules patients   But  I think if  I remember  I just called her office and set the appointment     It might be different now
