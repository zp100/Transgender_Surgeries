<p>
I had bottom surgery (PIV with graft) three months ago with Dr. Sutin at PAI in Bangkok and am thrilled with the results!
</p>
<p>
Ms. Charee, the liason, made the entire process a breeze. I was intimidated by the intricacies of a massive surgery like this but she walked me through the whole thing, before during, and after surgery.
</p>
<p>
Total cost was $13,000 for everything except the plane ticket.
</p>
<p>
Presurgery: Arrived three days prior. Visits to clinics for paperwork and testing. Nerves.
</p>
<p>
Surgery: Checked in to the hospital the night before. Laxatives to clear stuff out. Steril shower. Wheeled to the operating room.  Woke up a few hours later feeling sore as hell.
</p>
<p>
Days 1-2 post-op: Morphine drip as needed...and it was needed. Very limited mobility. Eating, sleeping and watching anime like it was my job.
</p>
<p>
Days 3-4 post-op: Tylenol for a pain killer. Turning in bed was easier. Short walks around the room. &#34;Packing&#34; was removed (not fun but not painful either) and it felt much better after.
</p>
<p>
Day 5: Discharged from the hospital. Checked into the hotel Ms. Charee booked for me. The catheter was still in, which made walking and cleaning the surgery sight a chore.
</p>
<p>
Day 7: Return to PAI for a checkup, catheter removal, and dilation training.
</p>
<p>
Week 2 post-op: Dilating (30 mins) and cleaning (betadine douche) twice a day. Other than that, lots of relaxing and small walks.
</p>
<p>
This was the point at which it really set in that this new body was mine. Relief from dysphoria and moments of euphoria were profound. The trauma of the surgery was over and now I was getting back to a semi-normal life with the body I always wanted.
</p>
<p>
Week 3-4: More of the same. Pain decreased drastically. Swelling went way down. Dilating got easier. Had one final checkup with Dr. Sutin, got my gender reassignment letter &amp; fit-to-fly letter then left for the airport!  I got a wheelchair at the airport which helped breeze through security and avoid long standing and walking time. The flight itself wasn&#39;t bad, with a few Tylenol.
</p>
<p>
Week 4-6: Able to walk a few city blocks to run errands. Stitches finally dissolved. Dilating was much easier. Continued resting. Able to orgasm.
</p>
<p>
Week 6-10: Scaring and swelling are very minimal. Everything looks gorgeous aesthetically.  Able to walk, stand and work as normal with just a little more resting than before.
</p>
<p>
Final comments: I am incredibly happy that I decided to go through with this surgery and chose the clinic, doctor, and liason that I did.  For me, the pain, rest time, and financial cost were all worth it for peace of mind I experience now.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has questions, let me know!

Im so happy to hear of your amazing experience. I&#39;m going to PAI at the end of September! I&#39;m just now hearing about Charee and how helpful she can be. Did you contact her through her website? How much did she charge you for her services?

Yay!!! I&#39;m happy for you! She was and continues to be a huge help. Her services are free even if you don&#39;t book, and if you do, she&#39;s paid by PAI, so it&#39;s included in the 13k! She can be contacted through her website Estetica Thailandia

Just an update for anyone interested, I reached out to Charee, and because I had already scheduled everything directly through PAI, she couldn&#39;t offer her services to me. So if you want her services, contact her first!

As a fellow Dr Sutin girl, Iâ€™m so happy you had as an amazing experience as I did.  Iâ€™m 6 months down the line now, and I couldnâ€™t be happier.

Hi. My surgery with Dr. Sutin is tomorrow. Have you had any complications?  Iâ€™m worried about possible divergence of the surgical sutures. Have you ever had that happen?

Best of luck to you! I didn&#39;t have any complications or divergence of sutures. Just rest as much as possible, dilate when they tell you to, and don&#39;t push too hard when you dilate.

Itâ€™s so weird. I did everything very accurately and took care of myself, but there was still a suture divergence near the vaginal canal and I lost part of the labia minora. Itâ€™s a lottery.

Both! I had a penile inversion vaginoplasty, then the labiaplasty to finish. All done during the same surgery, both by Sutin.

Thanks! Yes, it is included in the $13k. The liason sent me a list of three suggested hotel options (with some price difference) to choose from, and then she booked it for me. I just had to pay on arrival.

I know there is probably a simpler way for me to figure out all this, but how do you even get started with getting surgery in a different country? Like what would the process be?

Email.

You have to be 18+ to get surgery in Thailand, and under 20 you need parental permission.

I didn&#39;t get any hair removal downstairs. Dr Sutin removes every follicle on the scrotal skin if doing a graft. The only hair I have is a little bit around the labia majora
