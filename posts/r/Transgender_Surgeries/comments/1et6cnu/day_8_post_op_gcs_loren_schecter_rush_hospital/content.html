I had my catheter removed today was moved to a nursing facility the day before.  It&#39;s a really nice place and i got to walk outside which was nice.  For the appointment in the morning i didn&#39;t really know what it was for.. Turned out it was to remove my catheter.  So they removed the bag and inserted a very big syringe that she said she would fill till i felt like i really needed to pee.  My bladder stopped accepting more saline but i didn&#39;t really feel like i had to pee. But she removed the catheter.  It wasn&#39;t to painful really.  Then i had to prove i could pee.  I was in the bathroom without success for awhile.  Then a pt pelvic therapist came and tried to help .. Well i pooped a lil and peed a lil.  They said it wasn&#39;t enough. And used an ultrasound and said i had to much pee.  I spent the next 3 hours drinking and walking and trying to pee.  Eventually they let me leave.  I went to my nursing center and took a tylonel and about 2 hours later had a glorious pee!
