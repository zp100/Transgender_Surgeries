Yes, they do a lot of them too. When I went there I actually thought they do more ftm surgeries because I saw so many trans men (I guessed they were trans because they were wearing a thing in their arm, where they usually take skin for the penis).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll also get the second surgery idk when, but it could be March.

Congratations! Are you happy with the result? Does lubos use scrotal tissue for the outer labia?
</p>
<p>
Thank you&lt;3

The outer labia are with the scrotal skin. The interior part of the vagina is made from a transplant from the base or the scrotum and the perineum.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really happy with my results, kinda sad that it&#39;s swollen though. I should also plan the 2nd part of the operation that will be apparently necessary (the word they use is &#34;notwendig&#34;).

Thanks for the info!! And the, alsway do it this way? Can I tell them to not use my scrotal skin for the outside visible?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m thinking about going to Lubos next year for my SRS.
</p>
<p>
What are they doing in the 2nd and notwendigen operation?

I don&#39;t understand what you mean but I guess you can ask? What should they use though? Or you mean you want the labia to be not visible?
</p>
<p>
In the second op iirc they do some minor corrections,  mostly they will remove extra skin that they leave for safety, they will also do other functional stuff like correcting the urethra if for example you pee too high or too low. Also they will do some aesthetic corrections, you can see the difference between those if you search through this subreddit or

We underestimate how much our body needs energy to heal so you might get sad for no reason because you&#39;re exhausted. Make sure to rest as much as you can so you don&#39;t get burnt out.

That&#39;s true, I guess I&#39;m stressing myself too much. I should have planned the recovery differently to begin with. I guess maybe pre cooking meals and freezing them might have been a good idea because I want to eat specific stuff sometimes

You probably went for surgery the day I left. I also had bleeding until week 5 I think? But not a lot, except from a part near the right labia majora (you can see it there being more swollen too) that had me stressed out and ended up exchanging emails and phone calls with the Klinik.
</p>
<p>
I think I had granulation while at the clinic, the doctor dealt with it while i was there though, I stayed for three weeks (9-31 July)
