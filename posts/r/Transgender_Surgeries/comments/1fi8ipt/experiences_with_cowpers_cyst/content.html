A bit of background: I&#39;m a few years post-bottom surgery, and 1 year post-revision. I had my surgery performed at NYU by Dr. RBL.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after my revision, I complained to my surgeon about some swelling in the area next to my urethra, on one side. It was swollen and slightly dark-colored.  She suggested it may be a cyst, and prescribed some cream to see if it would resolve itself.
</p>
<p>
It didn&#39;t resolve itself. The swelling remained and it was somewhat inconvenient and occasionally uncomfortable for a number of months.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I flew to NY for a post-op visit, and the Dr was able to take a closer look. Her conclusion was that it was a &#34;cowper&#39;s cyst&#34; - a cyst formed from cowper&#39;s gland fluid, possibly from some blockage in the duct.  She nicked it with some scissors and allowed it to drain. It&#39;s been a few days since then, and the swelling has gone down considerably. It&#39;s my hope that the cyst is resolved. If it comes back, I&#39;ll have to schedule a surgery in NY for a more through cyst excision.
</p>
<p>
Notably, Dr. RBL mentioned that she
<em>
does
</em>
occasionally see this happen with some bottom surgery patients, but did not know why it occurs.
</p>
<p>
It occurs to me that I had never heard of this complication before, and I don&#39;t see it mentioned in this forum at all. I am writing this post to share my experience (above) with other, and to ask if anyone else has experienced this complication as well.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Has anyone else experienced this?
</li>
<li>
Did it resolve after draining it or did it require surgery?

I had SRS in 2016 with Dr. Chettawut and have a similar issue.
</p>
<p>
Mine is positioned higher up, a little below and to the right of my clitoris. I&#39;ve suspected cowper&#39;s glands as there appear to be 2 symmetrical points on the left and right side. The right side one swells up at times and feels uncomfortable, at which point I try to drain it. Draining it produces a large quantity of green-yellowish milky liquid, and eventually blood.
</p>
<p>
I go through periods where it seems fine and I don&#39;t need to drain it for months, but once the fluid is there it tends to stick around for weeks or months, and I&#39;m draining it constantly, often daily.
</p>
<p>
As you can tell, in my experience, draining is not enough to resolve the issue permanently.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had plastics and sexual health look at it and have had scans done. No one knows what&#39;s up. I&#39;ve described the issue to Chett who told me to come back for revision, but didn&#39;t tell me what it might be (I haven&#39;t yet gone for revision as I don&#39;t have the funds for it).
</p>
<p>
I did use a cream prescribed by sexual health which might&#39;ve helped while I was using it? I can&#39;t remember the name of it now. Will update when I remember.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d be very interested in hearing from others who share this experience as well. Has anything helped to resolve things?

Is it likely to reoccur?

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Nobody knows! Time will tell. I think all cysts have a risk of re-occurance if they&#39;re not excised completely (i.e. just drained)

So much medicine is like that. Nobody has a clue.
</p>
<p>
Cis women get similar problems too.

Thanks for sharing. This is a very useful experience shared to those looking and those who have been through the procedure! It‚Äôs the first time we are hearing such an issue but can‚Äôt rule this out when looking at the level of complexity behind bottom surgery and the way recovery varies. Would be good to hear more and thank you for adding symptoms. Hopefully everything goes well from her onwards.
