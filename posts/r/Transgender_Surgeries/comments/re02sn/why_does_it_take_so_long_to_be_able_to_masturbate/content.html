I have seen this question a lot...  &#34;How long after SRS were you able to masturbate?&#34;, and I just want to know why this is an issue?  Is it a pain issue?  Does it take a long time for it not to be painful to masturbate after SRS?  Is it because of lack of feeling?  I have heard it takes a while to get total feeling and function from your new vagina after SRS.  Or is it a healing issue.  Not being able the masturbate because it might damage healing tissue.
</p>
<p>
Or is it some other reason?  Some day, I would hope I will be able to experience this issue and get my answers first-hand.  But until then, I would really appreciate if someone would be willing to &#34;fill in the blanks&#34; as it were.

It can be a lot of things, mental blocks, slow nerve healing, swelling, and a bunch more. I had my first orgasm at about 2.5 months post op, it&#39;s possible I could have orgasmed a bit earlier but I didn&#39;t try to do it all the time. I tried around the 7 week mark to use a vibrator but stopped because it hurt and seemed scary. I masturbated with my clitoris and not my vagina though

So you are saying you CAN do it, or at least try.  And that it&#39;s more about whether it just feels right?

Yes it is and it felt similar to pre-OP just without the obvious bits like ejaculating sperm/semen and twitching. It&#39;s very relaxing, I get cranky if I don&#39;t masturbate a few times a month

For me it was mostly I&#39;m not in the mood.
</p>
<p>
The first 4 weeks I was in hospital, then I&#39;ve got out and also started to explore a little bit more, but it also was painful (not much but enough to be uncomfortable)
</p>
<p>
Then at round about week 7/8 I started masturbating the first time and it felt good, but I also feared that I could damage something.

This is very similar to me, the sensation after was drastically different, and didn&#39;t feel pleasurable to begin with before I went numb. With time it started feeling more comfortable, and took longer before I went numb. Eventually I was able to get over the peak before I went numb. Took 5 months, and another 3 months before I could go for multiples again, which is where I am now. Still takes a long amount of time to get off each time, but I&#39;ve heard that continues to get better until about 2 years?

Iâ€™m at almost two months post op now.  My doctor said I could masturbate as soon as I was comfortable.  I guess directly after surgery though I was sore and even when I wasnâ€™t there were so many sutures.  I really had the feeling I would tear something and my new vulva.  So I waited until the sutures were more or less dissolved for the most part.
</p>
<p>
I think at this points parts are still numb and might not be getting the full experience.  I definitely feel things but other parts feel slightly numb.  I want experiencing a lot of sensitivity before surgery so it could just be my new baseline.  I have yet to fly to the moon but I give a shot every once in a while to see where Iâ€™m at.

For me I was able to start masturbating at about 9 weeks post operation. It wasn&#39;t necessarily that I couldn&#39;t it&#39;s just a lack of wanting. Healing takes a lot out of you and removing the last thing in my body that&#39;s producing testosterone can I just took all the rest of it out of me. So I didn&#39;t really have a drive to but one day I was kind of interested and I wanted to see if I could climax and turns out I could but only with the assistance of a vibrator. I almost never masturbate with just my fingers or hand so it&#39;s not really out of the ordinary for me to do it that way. My surgeon, Dr BBL, really really urges everybody to do some self-exploration and to start masturbating after about the 3 week period I think. She wants you to get in touch with your new anatomy and to try to understand what feels best for you. Oftentimes postoperative depression also plays a part in whether or not one wants to embark on that journey that soon I know I dealt with my fair share and I didn&#39;t expect it to even pop up. Realistically your miles may vary and everyone&#39;s journey is different. I&#39;ve had a tough time doing recovery because my right labia healed perfectly fine and so did the muscles but my left labia is still stiff and some areas and it can cause me a bit of pain and that&#39;s just a turn off. So I don&#39;t really think there&#39;s one answer to your question. I think it&#39;s completely subjective.

For me it was over 7 months before I had a real orgasm. I think the biggest thing after healing was learning what feels good with the new parts.

Going on 8 months post-op (zero-depth) and not really close to my first orgasm. Generally not aroused and still feels numb/swollen in places. Sad town.

Iâ€™m 7 weeks post op and Iâ€™ve had my 4th orgasm. Three from dilating and one from clit stimulation. I was numb the first month then all the feeling came back. I almost hands free orgasmed this morning from looking at my man nude.

It took my over two years to figure out to masturbate after SRS, maybe less if you count the little tiny &#34;Was that an orgasm?&#34; moments.
</p>
<p>
It had nothing to do with healing or sensation. I was fully healed and had plenty of sensation a few weeks after surgery.  It was learning how to be aroused. The primary sex organ is the brain.  My sexuality was changing as well, so I had to construct a new sense of what was erotic.  After that it got much easier. It can still take a long time to climax, though. It&#39;s just sort of part of being a woman.

I started exploring at the 3 month marker but could jot orgasm until 6-7 months post op. Mostly swelling and healing prevented it. No sensation for quite a while. Post orgasm was sore for the first several times. Then just after 9 months post it started getting way more sensitive and easier to explore and pleasure. It mostly has to do with healing and nerve reconnecting

I try to give people the benefit of a doubt when I see this question; that they&#39;re simply having anxiety about common post-op numbness, and the possibility of a poor outcome. That, as opposed to some troll, pervin&#39; on us.

Being told not to by your surgeon, pain, numbness, and being scared of breaking something seem to be common reasons.
</p>
<p>
I had a very gentle go at 4 weeks as I was having really well and it worked first time, but even being as gentle as I could I was still worried about breaking something. A lot of people take longer and that&#39;s to be expected.

5.5 months later, still nothing - have only tried a handful of times though. It was a crapshoot before surgery and I think nowadays I am not willing to really even try to the same extent as before.

I&#39;m currently about 9 weeks post-op and my experience has been that everything has just been very swollen and tender, which made anything other than gentle touching start to hurt a little after a while. I&#39;m also not allowed to insert anything into the vaginal canal for the first 3 months other than dilating.
</p>
<p>
That said, over the last couple weeks things have calmed down enough that I&#39;ve been able to orgasm from stimulating my clit (mix of fingers and very gently using a vibrator) a couple times.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s very much a YMMV thing though, some people can orgasm after a few weeks, some take many months

If I&#39;m honest after complications the last thing on my mind was masturbation. It took a good year before I was comfortable with my body.
