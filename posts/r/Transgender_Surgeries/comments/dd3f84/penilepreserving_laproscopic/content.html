<em>
(see post history for previous entries about this surgery)
</em>
</p>
<p>
This post covers week 5 post-op. It&#39;s about healing, exercising, and dilation.
</p>
<p>
Also, something that&#39;s not mentioned really at all - there&#39;s no word on what GCS does to the musculature down there. I doubt we have the same musculature as cis women, but I guess we assume GCS fixes it? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve read a single thing about this, and I hope everyone starts asking this to their surgeons. It&#39;s too late for me (I&#39;ll ask at my 3-month checkup anyways) but hopefully it can be a consideration in the future.
</p>
<h1>
Swelling
</h1>
<p>
Continues to go down! It&#39;s also starting to stay down even when I&#39;ve been up &amp; active for hours. I&#39;m basically on my feet as much as I was before surgery, but I recline on couches instead of sit in chairs (most of the time).
</p>
<p>
The stiches are coming out, too &gt;.&lt; . I&#39;m not interested in trying to snip it because I don&#39;t have feeling back on the inner labia yet (where the stiches are). So I just have to live with them poking me. Oh well.
</p>
<h1>
Dilation
</h1>
<p>
I was doing some blue dilator, but then the retraction phase hit! It&#39;s no lie - in the 2nd/3rd month everything gets tight as your insides heal. In the space of a couple days it went from nice and easy to be pretty slow (e.g. 1min to get in, to 3-5min). It&#39;s not actually painful, just really tight. Feels like sore muscles. So, I&#39;m stuck at purple for now.
</p>
<p>
Also, fun fact - I regained the length I thought I had lost. I mentioned thinking I might have lost some awhile ago, and just decided to try dilating a bit longer (e.g. ~20min instead of ~10) and voila, I&#39;m back! Possibly even a little deeper.
</p>
<h1>
Exercising
</h1>
<p>
Finally, I can get those endorphins! Right now I&#39;m at a daily ~90min hike in the local trails. I&#39;m hoping to start doing more in a week or two.
</p>
<p>
By now I&#39;m confident that higher activity levels is really helping the healing. The swelling doesn&#39;t even get bad after all this walking.
</p>
<h1>
Healing
</h1>
<p>
Healthy pink flesh is conquering the granulation tissue! Slowly but surely. I still have some protein coating but it&#39;s been disappearing at a healthy rate. It&#39;s
<em>
still
</em>
lopsided because one side had a tonne of granulation tissue, but it&#39;s been getting better.
</p>
<p>
Feeling hasn&#39;t changed much, just more nerves zapping. I have no feeling around the canal&#39;s entrance yet.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not having pee/bladder issues anymore! Probably was resolved with all the muscles healing.
</p>
<p>
Another thing people don&#39;t mention - post-op sleep issues! Gah! This is getting better but surgery really exacerbated my (probably ASD-related) sleep issues. Historically, I can&#39;t fall asleep until at least 30 minutes sitting in bed letting my brain process stuff. Since surgery it&#39;s been closer to 2 hours. I don&#39;t mind it too much (gives me a nice time to work on hobbies mentally) but it is something to consider.
</p>
<h4>
Discharge
</h4>
<p>
A whole subsection because I know what y&#39;all like :P.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not using any pads anymore because they were annoying. I&#39;m just wearing loose underwear (maybe femme-ish boxers?) and loose pants and accepting the constant wetness. It&#39;s
<em>
alot
</em>
, but the airflow helps. It doesn&#39;t bother me. It doesn&#39;t soak through the thick-ish cotton underwear. Plus I think the lack of friction is helping healing.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also definitely not like pee or water or anything. I think it&#39;s clear-ish and dries clear-white-ish (unless there&#39;s protein, in which case it&#39;s yellow-ish), but I only inspect it via the underwear smears (I&#39;m avoiding directly touching the area without gloves/shower until my 3month checkup). It&#39;s slimy. It smells warm and earthy and usually like me. Once in awhile it&#39;ll smell like honey (???).
</p>
<h1>
Conclusion
</h1>
<p>
Things continue to go well. Dilation is just a time to put on an interesting video. I&#39;m not worried about being on my feet too long by now. Pokey stitches make me want to (gently) rip them all out.
</p>
<p>
I might as well continue posting weekly...pretty sure I wouldn&#39;t do it if I switched to monthly.
</p>

I&#39;m super happy to hear that things are going so well for you! I can&#39;t imagine any sort of hiking so soon after such a major surgery.. let alone the friction..
</p>
<p>
But thank you so much for being so thorough and keeping us all informed! It&#39;s very much appreciated

That&#39;s all really awesome news! Thanks so much for the continued updates!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious how intense the hiking you&#39;re doing is. I kinda don&#39;t want to wait 3 months before I can do any rock climbing. It&#39;d be nice to be able to stretch out and warm up on some easy V0  boulders in the gym after a month or two of healing. It&#39;s basically just yoga plus stairs as far as physical requirements.

Well, the hiking is up/down hills and steps. So there&#39;s alot of elevation change. But I don&#39;t have to go too fast, and I don&#39;t carry anything besides a jacket with me.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;d do even V0 routes right now. The peritoneal lining is still healing and I would hate to do something in my abdomen (e.g. by using muscles or dropping/falling). Climbing is also more intense than walking, and no matter your fitness now, two weeks of laying down will take alot of that conditioning away. That said, every person heals differently so who knows. I personally am waiting at least a couple more weeks before doing anything like that.

Yeah, I was thinking at the 8-9 week mark if I even feel up to it.i guess at that point I might as well wait the full 12.

When I spoke to her, she seemed to emphasize there were more unknowns than with penile inversion, and wasn&#39;t in favor of it except as a revision technique.  She also said there weren&#39;t any significant benefits to it over penile inversion.
</p>
<p>
Did you have the same discussion and how did you progress to getting peritoneal pull through?

You can see my post history (specifically my first post) about it.
</p>
<p>
I agree with her dissuading people from choosing it first. If you&#39;re not young, fit, healthy - it&#39;s not a good option for you for you.
