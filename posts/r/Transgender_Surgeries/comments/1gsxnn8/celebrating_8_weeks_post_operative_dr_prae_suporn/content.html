Wow , looks great congrats,  how&#39;s your sensation ? I&#39;m really leaning toward Thailand if I ever decide to get bottom surgery.

Sensation is good. Too good, actually! I had phimosis prior to surgery, so my glans was already fairly sensitive, and now my clit is insane. I’m waiting for the nerves to settle down so that I can actually enjoy using it.

Hey congrats! I love seeing posts from fellow Dr. Prae girls ~
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m guessing you found your way to the support discord server? Your results look great and I&#39;m so happy for you! Things only get better from here, but I know it feels like a long road ahead (I&#39;m 10 months post-op rn).

Yes I did! It was very handy before, during and after the surgery.
</p>
<p>
One of the things that kept me sane during my stay in Thailand was the social aspect. Getting to meet all the other girls and their support people, and making lifelong friends. I’d have probably had a significantly more miserable time if it weren’t for that.

Lovely work girl 💕. Can you DM the surgery and stay costs? (Or just add to your original post as lots of girls are asking the same question 😂😂). We are so curious.

Suporn’s method is different from the other more widely available methods like penile inversion, sigmoid colon graft or peritoneal pull through. They have more information about it on
<a href="https://supornclinic.com/paper/">their website
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Pain is something that I feel cannot be measured reliably, as it is incredibly subjective. Pretty much all major surgeries like SRS are going to come with an element of pain, which at times, can be insurmountable and unbearable. There are a lot of different pains too. Swelling pain. Throbbing pain. Sharp nerve pain. Muscle pain. It can range anywhere from a mild annoyance to incredibly distressing.  The painkillers they’ll give you will help out a lot, but they won’t completely nuke it.  All I can say with any degree of certainty is, expect it. Embrace it. Prepare for it. It’s going to be rough for a while, but remember, many others have gone through the same surgery and lived to tell the tale. Draw on that collective strength, remind yourself that it’s just temporary, and that you’ll pull through all the same.
</p>
<p>
You got this!

Out of surgery, you’ll be on a morphine IV drip. The hospital will provide any and all pain relief as needed to make you as comfortable as possible. Outside of hospital, you’ll be given paracetamol, an NSAID, anti-biotics and Gabapentin (nerve pain suppressant). They will also provide tramadol if you aren’t on any antidepressants, or paracetamol + codeine if you are. The clinic did also provide me with long acting morphine tablets and short acting morphine syrup when I was at a particularly rough patch of the recovery.
</p>
<p>
Also, I had SRS! I figured it was obvious from the photos I’d posted 😅

Alright atleast I’d get heavy pain killing lol, it kinda relieves me!

No i mean what type of SRS? When I research SRS to chose what clinic ima go to I am always overwhelmed with different types, like penile inversion, scrotum something etc. I don’t know which I shpuld go for, that’s what I meant lol

Ah, the Suporn clinic uses their own technique, which involves using a scrotal skin graft, and then using the tunica vaginalis as a lining on top of that to provide a degree of self-lubrication.
</p>
<p>
There’s more information about it on their
<a href="https://supornclinic.com/paper/" rel="nofollow">website

Every surgery carries risk. I was very fearful when I was in the week prior to surgery, when I realised that I’m practically rolling the dice on my life here. Unfortunately, no two recoveries are the same, and some I know have had a pretty shit time of it.
</p>
<p>
I also know a few people who had no issues whatsoever and were completely fine throughout their recovery.
</p>
<p>
Also may I ask what you mean by the one type?
</p>
<p>
Realistically, you’re likely to be somewhere in the middle. Not great, not terrible. I’ve certainly had a rougher than average recovery, but I am pulling through nicely. Dr Prae had mentioned that I had incredibly good, fast wound healing, which has meant hitting certain recovery milestones sooner than anticipated. There’s still a long road ahead.

I&#39;m booked in with Prae next July, it&#39;s lowkey nerve wracking but change requires sacrifice hey.
</p>
<p>
If I can ask, was there anything you would have done differently in terms of helping out your own recovery?

I wish I’d stayed in bed more, and did fuck all. I’m someone who fiercely values her independence, and I made the mistake of trying to do too much, too soon out of hospital.
</p>
<p>
The site is incredibly fragile for at least two months, but because it’s at the centre of your body, you’re pretty much straining it whenever you’re moving about, which will cause it to tear and separate. Walking pulls on the area, and so does sitting. The safest, most comfortable position for you to be in long term is lying on your back at an angle no more than 60 or 70 degrees upright.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this is an inevitability, and you will almost definitely walk away (gingerly) with some separation. The clinic will keep an eye on it and will advise you if it’ll heal on its own, if it will need to be stitched up during your stay, or if it will need to be fixed in a return revision visit later on down the track. Minimising how much time you’re on your feet or sitting down in your early days will help you immensely in the long run.

<p>
tl;dr: lie the fuck down lol 😤

It looks amazing, but I hope that the pain and everything goes away. That’s my number one fear is being left in permanent pain, number two is losing sensation although a less scared of that now that my libido is way lower, but still.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know if I’m insane to even consider bottom surgery when it seems so dangerous
</p>
<p>
And I don’t know that I could possibly do the one type since I don’t know what they would be working with

Suporn’s method is different from the other more widely available methods like penile inversion, sigmoid colon graft or peritoneal pull through. They use a scrotal skin graft. They have more information about it on
<a href="https://supornclinic.com/paper/" rel="nofollow">their website
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
I would advise you to reach out to the clinic directly for the cost, as the amount you end up spending can depend on a lot of different factors, and the clinic will be able to provide you with their most up to date pricing.
