Hi,  i was wondering if anyone can tell me their experience with jaw botox ?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m too afraid to get jaw surgery because of the potential nerve damage.
</p>
<p>
Does it make a big difference ?
</p>
<p>
Most of the picture i see on google are not that impressive.

I had masseter botox injections for TMJD and they made a dramatic difference in my jawline for a few months. My face looked markedly more feminine a week or two after the injections until the muscle slowly started to come back. Go to a *dentist* who specialises in theraputic botox.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t have any complications and it also helped significantly with my TMJD related pain.

Lol.  I did it once, with one of my local docs.  He got it in the right place, but results were very conservative.  I got the area shaved during FFS and it is way better than the Botox route.

BTW, jaw and neck exercises help a lot.
