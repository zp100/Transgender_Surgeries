I had my first consult for vaginoplasty today. I&#39;ve been on HRT and socially transitioned for 8 years. I recently got married and am finally in a position to take a few months to devote to surgically transitioning. The team I consulted with includes a Reconstructive Urologist and a Plastic Surgeon that work together on every bottom surgery done at their location. I prepared as much as I could. 2 years ago I quit smoking. This year I buckled down on my diet and got BMI under 36 (more loss planned). I have worked at a place I dislike for several years to ensure my insurance would cover the surgery. This morning I was left ugly sobbing after the plastic surgeon told me that due to the anatomy of my pubic region, specifically the skin of the &#34;FUPA&#34; not being stretchy enough, he could not commit to full depth, and would want me to consent to zero depth vaginoplasty.
<br>
I&#39;ve gone through so much to be who I am. I would rather die than go for zero depth. I know for some, that is a perfectly acceptable method, but for me, it would be further mental torture.
</p>
<p>
I asked if it was a weight issue, as 35.5 bmi is not as low as I&#39;d like to be, but they said it is simply the tissues not being stretchy enough.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m mentally wrecked.
</p>
<p>
I sobbed the majority of the 5 hour drive home, and kept thinking intrusive negative thoughts. I&#39;ve put so much time, effort, and pain into transition. This can not be how it ends. I&#39;ve been physically and sexually assaulted due to being transgender. I&#39;ve lost every member of my bio family due to who I am. I&#39;ve suffered at the hands of others for years. I can not believe this is it.
</p>
<p>
I have a consult in January with a different surgeon,  but now I&#39;m spooked. If he says the same thing,  I don&#39;t think I could keep doing this. I&#39;m genuinely worried for my mental health setbacks if my only options are zero depth or no surgery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m broken.
</p>
<p>
Positive vibes appreciated.

I have never heard a surgeon say this. I am assuming this is something specific to their technique. Your best bet is to get a consultation with another doctor that offers peritoneal pull through or a colon graft, or who doesn‚Äôt need so much groin skin. There are way more options than ‚Äújust‚Äù zero depth, or no surgery. I‚Äôm not quite sure why you have such an extreme reaction to minimal depth procedures, but if you truly don‚Äôt want that then there are skin grafts, etc. The problem will be finding someone that will work with your insurance.

I know it sounds petty to be so against minimal depth procedures, but for me, I can not see myself being happy without a functioning vagina. My husband is incredibly supportive either way, but in my head, I need to know that vaginally penetrative sex is possible in my future.
</p>
<p>
I appreciate your information and time.

There is absolutely nothing petty about having that as a goal. This is a major life-changing surgery, wanting to come away from it able to have penetrative sex is perfectly normal and healthy.

Yes, as mentioned there are peritoneal pull through and sigmoid colon techniques that use tissue from inside the body to create the neo vagina.  You have options.

Whatever you do, don&#39;t settle for what that surgeon thinks is best for you. Definitely get another opinion. I didn&#39;t have a lot to work with but my surgeon was able to give me 5.5&#34;. I had Dr Bella Avanssian at Mt Sinai in NYC.

Look into a different surgeon. Peritoneal pull-through vaginoplasty, as well as colon (although personally I feel like this option should be a last resort) are available for patients with insufficient donor skin. With that said, the peritoneal methods to my understanding usually require a surgical robot and two surgeons - so not every hospital has the resources to perform them. Being a bad candidate for that surgeon doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re a bad candidate for every surgeon.

To be clear, the surgeons seem like great people. I&#39;m just extremely bummed and not sure how to proceed or get my headspace clear.

find a new surgeon.  That sounds like nonsense to me.

Zero depth isn&#39;t merely acceptable for some folks. It is preferred. If I did get a vaginoplasty (which I&#39;m not going to but if I did) I would choose that.
</p>
<p>
But yeah this surgeon isn&#39;t right for you. Even if penile inversion won&#39;t work for you there are other options.

The consult in January is with Dr. Del Corral in Baltimore. I&#39;ve heard good things, but I think I agree about continuing until I find a surgical team that can meet my needs.

I had a fantastic experience getting the laparoscopic robotic PPT with Dr. Del Corral! His team did an excellent job, and I‚Äôm super pleased with both the aesthetic and function of my vagina.

Look for extensive independant reviews and post op photos for surgeon. Don‚Äôt trust what they say.

<p>
Del Corral is in the wiki, and I‚Äôd definitely avoid the ones who are not.
