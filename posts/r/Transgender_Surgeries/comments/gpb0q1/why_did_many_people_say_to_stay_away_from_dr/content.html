Why did anyone say to stay away from Dr Brassard? What‚Äôs wrong with him?
</p>
<p>
What are pros about Dr Brassard? What good reasons to have him?
</p>
<p>
Did anyone end up needing a revision after Dr Brassard?

The biggest legit complaint he has more of an assembly line procedure. He has a technique that he&#39;s perfected over the years and it&#39;s more geared towards consistent results rather than more boutique techniques that takes longer per patient.
</p>
<p>
Because of that, the most frequent aesthetic issue is less labia minora issue which bothers some people. You might want to research more into that if that&#39;s a concern, he&#39;s not the only one who skimps on that. Suporn was one of the few who did an amazing job on that, but it was much more extensive surgery and much more pain in the healing I heard.
</p>
<p>
The other complaint I&#39;ve heard is about the staff - It&#39;s in quebec and some people have reported language/attitude issues but really that&#39;s just how Montreal is.
</p>
<p>
I had no problem with Brassard or the nursing staff (the admin staff on the other hand...) and I know many others who haven&#39;t either. I also know several people who had horrible complications or expected a better result from the surgery, it&#39;s very anecdotal. Even Suporn/Chettawut have had their share of complaints.
</p>
<p>
A lot of the complaints I&#39;ve read about any surgeon are from people under the belief that if they just had X surgeon instead everything would have gone PERFECT, or X surgeon would have made it look better. Your vagina will not look like anyone elses. Your recovery will be unique as well.
</p>
<p>
I think the real questions to focus on is travel time including the difficulty in having to go back for revisions, cost, and to understand what your expectations are. You are unlikely to end up with a porn model vagina that so many cis women wish they had, but none of the surgeons will butcher it.
</p>
<p>
Whatever surgeon you go with, follow their guidelines to the letter! Not following proper aftercare instructions (and i get it dilation sucks) will torpedo your results regardless of who you see.
</p>
<p>
Good luck

I have to agree with everything here, I went last year to him.
</p>
<p>
To add to the nursing staff I know one girl there had a really bad experience with them who was there at the same time as me, I didn&#39;t have any issues. I managed to help her out with it, but only because I had another friend who had a similarly bad experience when she went with the nursing staff.
</p>
<p>
Out of the people I know who have been to him very few have had complications and none have been extreme cases.

There&#39;s one nurse there who I thought was pretty cool and funny. She&#39;s older than most of the staff and obviously cares a lot. Idk if this is always her job, but I&#39;ve seen a couple videos of her removing stents (she did it for me too) and she always says &#34;et voila&#34; the same way. Seems like she always holds it up to see your reaction to the size too. Nice lil human moments like that made the whole thing a great experience.

From what I‚Äôve seen he does most surgeries in Canada. The people I‚Äôve met said they were pretty happy with it. I‚Äôll likely go with him since it‚Äôs free under Canadian healthcare. People complain about factory results, but I like streamlined things so I don‚Äôt see the problem personally ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Honestly as long as it‚Äôs okay looking I don‚Äôt care much for chonky labias. Also, I‚Äôve seen a lot of reports about smell and nonstop discharge with the peritoneal pull through and from what I understand, the peritoneal tissue doesn‚Äôt have much sensation, so all that kind of makes it a no for me. Apparently, there‚Äôs not many reported cases in trans women and that puts me off a bit. I don‚Äôt have an opinion on dr Wittenberg as I haven‚Äôt seen her work before tho.

I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs possible if one is from Ontario. My province does not cover out of country, so it isn‚Äôt accurate to say Canadian healthcare covers it.

There is/was lots of misinformation about him. For some time, people got in their head that he makes you sign a NDA to not share ANY pictures. In reality, you just can‚Äôt take pics of caregivers or other patients without their consent. Aka common sense.

I think I saw people saying to not go with him because some people were unlucky with complications or he was rude or something like that (I&#39;m not 100% sure). But I think pros are : +Only 2 hours of surgery (being less time on anaesthesia i guess?) +Amazing aesthetic results

There never was an NDA. That seems to be a myth that just won&#39;t die, but nobody can ever produce a copy of one. I&#39;ve heard of on a few complications, no higher than any other surgeon, but those keep getting repeated by more and more folks, just because they heard it from a person, who heard it from a person, who heard it from a person. Yet the actual accounts, from actual patients, of major complications are few and far between (
<em>
especially
</em>
when you take into consideration how many surgeries his facility does.) This is unlike Rumer, who has a long history of exceptionally bad outcomes that are well-documented all over the place, from lots of patients.
</p>
<p>
I know a few folks who went to Brassard, none of them had complications, and they&#39;re all happy with their results.
</p>
<p>
And just because someone&#39;s disgruntled enough to set a clinic on fire doesn&#39;t speak for that surgeon&#39;s entire practice. He has a track record that&#39;s decades long, and one patient who was unhinged enough to set a fire doesn&#39;t erase that.

And my ex-girlfriend had her surgery with him and she&#39;s very happy with her results. There isn&#39;t a surgeon in existence who doesn&#39;t have at least some less-than-happy patients. Even Bowers has had some, and she&#39;s one of the most respected GRS surgeons on the planet. That still doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s the butcher a small handful of folks seem convinced he is (despite the evidence to the contrary.)

Yes YOURS, everyone have different results. I did read somewhere that Dr. Belanger tends to create more labia so I just guessed. And maybe someones body can&#39;t handle being 6 hours on anaesthesia so maybe it&#39;s good to choose Brassard if you&#39;re anyways happy with labia? I also heard that many cis womens can  reduce the length of the labia minora by surgery so maybe there is no reason to extend it if it&#39;s amazing :)
</p>
<p>
Just to clear up, when I Said &#34;he doesn&#39;t really create labia&#34; I spoke in a figurative sense

I do agree with that, everyone is different and Belanger does like to use all the skin she can for the labia. Brassard tends to take a bit more skin off but his updated method does make more of a labia then the results you&#39;ve seen 2+ years ago. If Brassard was using the old way I would never have gone there.
</p>
<p>
I believe that no matter what surgeon I went to I would need a labiaplasty to extend it, 90% of the results I&#39;ve seen from any surgeon the labia ends to early

How do you know that method is updated? Does it say on their site? What do you mean by &#34;ends to early&#34;? It will shrink?

He uses more skin the make the labia so when everything is healed up you may actually have to get the loose skin taken off or use that loose skin to extend the labia more. Most GRS results I&#39;ve seen the labia fades before the vaginal opening where as when you look at most cis vaginas the labia extends to or a bit past the vaginal opening and disappears into the taint.

I went there 2 years ago and this is my experience as well.  He&#39;s seems to not be as open on his techniques as say Suporn is so I don&#39;t know when this was changed.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s part of the area that heals and as the swelling goes down it becomes less prominent until it&#39;s perfectly healed with the final result. There&#39;s only a few main techniques and with the inversion technique it&#39;s common the labia is small. Brassard adjusted his method to make it on par with the other inversion method surgeons apparently as it was supposedly quite worse than what I received at one point.
</p>
<p>
Most people do do go for a revision from any surgeon will get that adjusted afterwards - and it&#39;s also something some cis women choose as well. I don&#39;t think people realize how common that is. If this is a major concern then people should be looking at non inversion techniques in the first place - of which there&#39;s not many.
</p>
<p>
There might be recent examples in the wiki I&#39;m not sure.
