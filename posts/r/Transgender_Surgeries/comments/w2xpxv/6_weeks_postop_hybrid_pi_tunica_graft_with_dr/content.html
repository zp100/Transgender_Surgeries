Hey all.  As the title says, i&#39;m exactly 6 weeks post-op with Dr. Ting in NYC with the PI canal + tunica vaginalis end-cap thing.  Just turned 30 and weigh 140lbs (basically no body fat), for reference.
</p>
<p>
i&#39;ll be frank because i&#39;m out of spoons today: i truly, truly hate the way my vulva looks, and i&#39;m afraid it&#39;s only going to keep looking worse as i heal.  Nothing looks even remotely like what a cis vulva should look like. God where do i begin.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
my clit hood is too high, and my clit itself is too big so it doesn&#39;t fit inside at all.
</li>
<li>
i don&#39;t have any minora at all.  Considering my biggest ask was to give me prominent, well-defined minora, its absence fucks me up hardcore.
</li>
<li>
vestibule is lopsided, and there&#39;s a random crevasse on the left side in the pic that&#39;s not there on the right.
</li>
<li>
there&#39;s a ton of separation on the bottom, both on the fourchette and the bottom of the majora.  Looking at this one ruins my mental health every single time.
</li>
<li>
tons of white skin all around the entrance and inside.  Seriously, whenever i look inside after dilation it&#39;s almost entirely white.
</li>
<li>
the dilators still sit at a significant angle inside of me.  i can mitigate it a bit by angling my hips, but it&#39;s truly unnatural and awful and well outside the range of cis vaginas.
</li>
<li>
the whole vulva feels way more &#34;recessed&#34; than the average vaginoplasty result i&#39;ve seen.  Hard to describe, but it looks and feels like there&#39;s way too much empty space where there should be minora and majora and stuff.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
i showed it to a friend a few days ago, and she used terms like &#34;horrible and worrying&#34;, &#34;not a result i would want for myself&#34;, and &#34;way worse than any other results i&#39;ve seen at 6 weeks&#34;.  Which like, was really fantastic for my mental health as you would expect.  i&#39;ve struggled my whole life with feeling lesser to cis women, and now i barely even feel capable of calling myself a woman at all.  In my darkest moments, which happen daily now, i refer to myself as botched.  i don&#39;t know if anyone would agree, but it&#39;s how i feel right now.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Ting, along with several assisting doctors and nurses, said during my 2 and 4 week postops that i was &#34;healing incredibly well&#34; and that he thinks i got excellent aesthetics.  Honestly though, i&#39;m struggling to believe him.  i&#39;m scared that the separation is going to leave horrible scars or make the vulva look even more unnatural when it&#39;s healed, nothing looks right at all, and i&#39;m worried about all the white skin inside and on the surface.
</p>
<p>
About the only thing that&#39;s going well so far is that i don&#39;t have any trouble dilating ever.  Was up to green by week 3, and just did orange for the first time last night and it was trivial.  Depth is great too: 5th dot is about underneath my considerably-recessed-than-average urethra, which lines up with Ting saying i got 6+ inches of depth.
</p>
<p>
Pleasure&#39;s been great at least too.  Started masturbating at week 5 and have had 3 screaming explosive orgasms since then.  Order of magnitude more pleasurable and longer lasting than before, and i don&#39;t have to take frequent breaks because of erectile tissue bullshit.  No mid-pleasure dissociation either which is amazing as heck.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
i don&#39;t know why i&#39;m posting.  i guess i&#39;m just trying to reserve hope that maybe it&#39;s not as bad as i think it is, and maybe someone will be like &#34;you&#39;re catastrophising, this looks great and it&#39;s going to heal great and all your worries are unfounded&#34;.
</p>
<p>
i don&#39;t know.  i guess just, i&#39;d really love to hear what y&#39;alls thoughts are: how you think it looks in general / compared to average, if it looks even remotely cis-ish to you, if i should be worried, etc.  Maybe some reassurances that things might turn out okay might be nice too if anyone feels like it&#39;s not as bad as i think it is, i don&#39;t know.
</p>
<p>
And if anyone out there hated there results at this point but they got better as healing progressed, i&#39;d love to hear about that too.  i literally don&#39;t have anything else keeping me going right now.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the trouble everyone.  i really am.  Thanks so much for reading and i hope you have wonderful days.

Honestly, I have seen better but I have also seen a LOT worse. Yours looks nice while standing and that&#39;s definitely a positive. You are also only at 6 weeks, mine looked like a car cash at that point.
</p>
<p>
Also if you have function you are winning, some of us never climax again after surgery.
</p>
<p>
If you want to see bad there are pics on my profile, if they make you feel better then I suppose some good can come out of it. Third pic in the link is the one I hate most and that&#39;s at 7 months. Yours looks much better x

Thank you very much for the kind words, i appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
Gosh i don&#39;t mean to be a jerk and minimize your feelings, and i&#39;m really sorry if i am, but honestly those pictures *to me* look absolutely wonderful and i&#39;d do anything for my ugly misshapen parts to end up looking like that.  i don&#39;t expect to be anywhere near that lucky :/
</p>
<p>
You mentioned it looking like a car crash about now, and i&#39;m curious: how significantly different was your vulva at 6 weeks compared to months later?  Like did you hate yours as much as i do mine, and were there any positive changes that ended up completely surprising you out of nowhere?
</p>
<p>
i ask because in a couple of other replies to this post, i mentioned that i&#39;ve seen a ton of results on here the past couple years, and how their 4-8 week pics looked similar enough to their final pics that there weren&#39;t any significant changes or surprises over the healing process.  i guess i&#39;m just wondering if you personally think that my result might look significantly prettier (or less fucked up at least) as it heals.  Like, if the context of you saying &#34;honestly I have seen better&#34; saying was &#34;compared to other 6 week posts&#34; or &#34;irregardless of healing it&#39;s worse than average&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the trouble and thanks.

Well thanks but I can&#39;t see it. Yours looks better now than mine did at 3 months and if you think mine is ok then you will be happy with yours soon enough and Yes it will &#34;look  less fucked&#34; and much prettier.
</p>
<p>
I hated mine from about 21 hours after surgery when I seen the state of the stitches. At 6 weeks I already had the V scar, you can&#39;t see it in the pictures but the skin under it is hard and painful to touch, it&#39;s also tighter than the surrounding skin and itches constantly.
</p>
<p>
My biggest issue though is having almost no clitoral sensation and I&#39;m still in pain. Neither of those can be fixed in a revision and I am very aware that I may never climax again. It&#39;s not from lack of trying either. If you have done it twice already then congratulations.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping another surgeon will remove the excess testicular skin that was left and cut out the scars and close them properly. If they don&#39;t I&#39;m cutting them out myself, don&#39;t care if I fuck it up I just can&#39;t live with looking at what he left there and the memories of him treating me like shit in hospital.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I would gladly swap mine for yours.
</p>
<p>
Sorry almost forgot... The scarring at the fourchette collects urine so it looks like I pissed myself if I don&#39;t wear a pad 24/7. I will put another pic on there but it&#39;s hard to take one without the flash making everything look better than it is.

Okay, that&#39;s reassuring to hear.  Thank you for the comfort and the advice, i really appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
Not to push back too hard or anything, but do you genuinely think that it&#39;s going to look significantly different/better over the next few months?  Like structures are already missing or misshapen and everything looks so awful, and i guess i just don&#39;t see how it could get better as time goes on.  Like i&#39;ve seen a lot of final results on this board, and when i look at their 4-8 week update pics, they already look both amazingly cis and also pretty close to how they ultimately end up.  Do you really see mine being prettier (or at least less malformed) over time?
</p>
<p>
i&#39;ll take that advice to heart, too.  i&#39;m definitely prone to alienating people when i spiral, and doing that to my surgeon&#39;s office would literally be a catastrophe.  Thank you very much.

i needed to hear all this.  Thank you so much for writing it, Autumn.  Gods i really hope you&#39;re right about all of that, and that after it&#39;s done that it looks better than it does now.  i&#39;m 100% certain i&#39;m going to need a revision, and fuck here&#39;s hoping that i can live with how it looks after that.
</p>
<p>
i wish i knew how to make my brain calm down in the meantime though.  Like, i genuinely don&#39;t think i have the tools to get through the next few months in anything other than animal-survival-mode (thanks, cptsd).  Will try to reread your comment every couple days in the hopes that maybe my brain will internalize the advice, at the very least.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again for everything, really appreciate it.

it will DEFINITELY look different in several months. Swollen tissue takes ages to come down, and while I think it&#39;s fair for you to worry, i wouldn&#39;t worry until everything settles to where it&#39;s meant to be.

Thanks, i appreciate you saying all this.  i just really hope that when it settles it looks significantly better than it does right now.  Getting through each day is a real struggle at the moment, wish i could fast forward to then.

If only we could grow an entire female reproductive system on a tree and attach it to our bodies... but you know this looks better than mine, so it&#39;s fine.

Gods i agree with that so, so deeply.  It&#39;s just so unjust the lengths to which we need to go to feel like ourselves, and how limited the technology and results are even when we do.  Fuck this universe.

It looks great to me, well within normal range.
</p>
<p>
Your friend doesn’t sound like a very good friend though. What horrid things to say.
</p>
<p>
I would say your recovery is going great considering you’ve had orgasm and dilating is going well.

Not to sound like i&#39;m pushing back too impolitely or anything, but do you really genuinely feel that way?  i don&#39;t know, i just see the lack of typical vulvular structures or connections and all the malformed parts and it just seems so abnormally bad compared to all the cis and trans vulvas i&#39;ve seen :/.
</p>
<p>
My friend is....blunt, shall we say.  She doesn&#39;t ever lie to me about how she feels, and that&#39;s definitely the part that fucked with me the most out of what she said.  Like she will constantly say how cis passing and pretty and femme my voice and body are, and always stops me from beating myself up when i get dysphoric about those things.  That&#39;s why i feel like i can really trust her opinion about this being super fucked up, if that makes sense :/.
</p>
<p>
Orgasm and dilation are definite pros at least, you&#39;re right.  Thanks for the support and reassurance, i really appreciate it.

Hi sweetie, I know this stage is super rough and during the first few months after GRS I had a similar period of despair, doubts and even sometimes regret. This also happened with my top surgery which had minor complications. Going down your list, I had almost every one of your concerns. Now at 9 months post op, most of these issues either resolved themselves, turned out to not be issues, and the rest will be corrected soon with a labiaplasty revision (you can get revision much earlier btw, I procrastinated). It&#39;s been a long and tedious healing process but I stuck with the dilation and focused on taking care of myself, going to therapy, staying connected to community and working on my dreams that aren&#39;t directly related to surgery.
</p>
<p>
At some points I actually felt like I should have stayed with my old genitals because at least they looked natural, but over time I realized just how nice it is to have a vulva instead of a penis and balls (and this is coming from someone who liked and enjoyed using what I had). It&#39;s taken some work and getting to know one another, but now I love my pussy even with her imperfections. Like other commenters have said, you DO have a cute vulva and she will be so beautiful when she&#39;s done doing her thing!
</p>
<p>
The hard part for me has been the waiting and not being able to skip ahead to the day I feel totally sexy and comfortable with a partner or myself. But there is a lot to enjoy and look forward to that has nothing to do with your vulva&#39;s appearance! You have good depth and that&#39;s amazing and not to be taken for granted! When it&#39;s sanitary and comfortable to do so, have some fun and get some bikinis, leggings, high waisted jeans, all that good stuff! Take care, have faith and don&#39;t forget to stop to smell the roses!🌹

Hey, just wanted to say thank you SO much for all the reassurances and kind words.  Seriously, i&#39;m touched.
</p>
<p>
Sounds like we really are/were in the same boat, huh?  i&#39;m at the point you were at a few months in right now honestly: every second of the day i regret getting surgery (with Ting especially), i feel botched, and i wish i had just stayed with the old equipment even though it was literally killing me it made me so dysphoric.  It feels literally unthinkable to me that that might ever change, but it&#39;s reassuring to know that someone else in my position ended up having such a dramatic and positive turn around as the months went on.
</p>
<p>
And like wow, all of your/our issues really ended up getting fixed or not being big deals?  That sounds too good to be true, but fuck i really hope that i can say the same in a couple months.  Hard part is going to be surviving in the meantime haha, and i literally don&#39;t have the mental health tools to be able to do that right now.  Here&#39;s hoping therapy can help me get by till then.
</p>
<p>
i&#39;m really, really sorry to ask, but if it&#39;s not too much trouble and you feel comfortable with it, would it be okay if i asked for a few vulva pics from around my stage of healing and then a few of either nowadays or when you really felt that the concerns had resolved themselves?  i&#39;m really curious to see what your healing journey was like so that maybe it might help my stupid brain calm down and accept that things might get better later.  If not though that&#39;s completely okay, i know it&#39;s a lot to ask for.
</p>
<p>
i&#39;ll keep rereading your comment every few days in the hopes that maybe i&#39;ll internalize your words and advice. Thanks again for everything.

I just want to say, I went to Mt. Sinai (though my surgeon wasn’t Ting) and I have
<em>
very
</em>
similar feelings post-op, and my result isn’t too dissimilar from your own.
</p>
<p>
I’ll be honest, the aesthetics of my results looked better throughout the healing process then it did in the end (4 years post op now) - but I also knew that was likely to happen based on the nuances of the healing process, so it became predictable in my case. I also still deal with urinary and internal issues that have also aided in my negative feelings post op. I decided not to get a revision there because I moved, and wasn’t comfortable with their team any longer. Wishing you luck and healing throughout the process, and sending you all my empathy.

So I think most post on here look fairly amazing. I&#39;m 12 weeks post-op today and my issue is that there like no coverage of internal structures and my canal seems like almost external add on. I think she&#39;s ugly and it makes me never want be intimate outside this recent unwelcomed increased libido. I had scary dilation event in week 2 that implies sensation should be good(presume it was orgasm) just unexpected and not pursued at time and really freaked me out. So not concerned there and frankly wasn&#39;t really concerned before.. told my surgeon wasn&#39;t my priority I was unorgasmic beforehand. She indicated not be suprised if it happens after surgery once dysphoria lifts. Try figure out how include photo.

I think you have a lovely vagina. Take a look at the web page “https:
<a href="http://www.greatwallofvagina.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">www.greatwallofvagina.co.uk/
</a>
. There are about 4 billion females on this planet and each one has a different looking vagina. Don’t fret .

i really appreciate the reassurance, Thalia.  i really, genuinely do, i&#39;ve just been looking at vulvas for my entire life and none of them have ever looked even remotely similar to what i have.  Even the most &#34;tucked-away&#34; cis vulvas still have all the right parts (minora, fourchette, clit hood covering clit, no random fissures...) in all the right places and with all the right connections.  i know vulvas have tons of variation but this doesn&#39;t even feel remotely within the extreme boundary of &#34;normal&#34; :/
</p>
<p>
Sorry to bother you, but i acknowledge that my perspective is ruled by trauma right now so i want to genuinely ask: do you personally think this is even within the boundaries of &#34;normal looking vulva&#34;?  Not like if it&#39;s clockable or anything, but like if you saw it you&#39;d be like &#34;oh yeah this is totally what a vulva should look like and the parts it should have&#34;?

I still think your vagina looks lovely but I understand that you need to be totally satisfied and at one with it. My thoughts are with you, and I would like to add don’t let dissatisfaction cloud you mind and thence ruin your life.

Oh huh interesting, so i guess that means his results consistently look like this?  Does the frowny face mean that you&#39;re also dissatisfied with your aesthetics?  If so, do you mind if i ask how you&#39;re doing and how you&#39;re coping with it?  i&#39;m honestly struggling to make it through each day haha, i really, sincerely hope you&#39;re holding up better than i&#39;ve been &lt;3

Give it more time to heal. Mine only started to really settle in after 7-8 months. Also, it’s unfortunately very common to have a revision to address the aesthetics. So don’t feel like it’s the end of the world.

That&#39;s good to hear that things might get better over the coming months at least, i really appreciate your comment and for saying so.
</p>
<p>
Do you personally think that my aesthetics might become significantly different/better over that time?  This is just anecdote, but whenever i&#39;ve seen someone&#39;s final result, their 4-8 week update pics always looked like it was clear they&#39;d eventually progress into the final result pic?  Hard for me to put into words but like, the evolution over time wasn&#39;t significantly different or unexpected is what i mean.  That&#39;s part of why i&#39;m so worried - if structures are already missing or significantly messed up now, i can&#39;t really see them getting much better over time :/.
</p>
<p>
Also, do you think that it would even be possible to fix all the stuff wrong here in a revision?  i really don&#39;t know how drastic they can be, but i&#39;m gonna need a LOT of work to fix this :/

From the one picture, things actually look lovely. So, I have to go on what you’re explaining, which may be you catastrophising your results. Put things in perspective and try to not think strictly about the negative. Because of our lifetime of dysphoria and low self esteem we’re used to focusing on what seems wrong. Girl!  You can walk down the street in spandex and feel comfortable knowing your not tucking!  For me that was one of the best things about my surgery. Give it time, focus on the positive, and be kind to yourself.

May I ask if you asked him about the white skin inside? If not, have you thought about getting an opinion from another trans-friendly doctor? It may not even have to be a surgeon, some trans-friendly PCPs have seen multiple surgeries and know about them, just can&#39;t do them. Perhaps yours could help you navigate through the concerns you have?

Be happy that you can orgasm. Aesthetics should not matter that much. 💐

While i am grateful i can orgasm, it feels dismissive to say that aesthetics aren&#39;t important.  i literally can&#39;t be happy with a result that doesn&#39;t look even remotely like what a vulva should look like. Aesthetics are important and i can&#39;t trick myself into believing they&#39;re not.

I think it will get better over time as you heal.   Maybe a minor revision in the future, but basically it looks pretty good. You are healing well which is critical. ❤️

Hi I don&#39;t know much about this kind of surgery I&#39;m afab but from an outside perspective your result looks incredible and very natural. All cis vulvas look different anyway and I think yours actually looks really nice :)

You are absolutely entitled to your feelings, and I can&#39;t speak from experience because I haven&#39;t even started hormones yet, but I will say that if I could snap my fingers and have an identical vulva to yours instead of this thing, I would do it in a heartbeat, ESPECIALLY with the screaming orgasms
