I&#39;ve been reading reddit post on Yeson for some time and figure it&#39;s my turn to share my experience. I&#39;m currently in the quarantine hotel through this weekend. Quarantine was reduced from 10 day to 7 days after I had already booked my flight, so I&#39;ll spend the extra 3 days in my hotel of choice. I will give trip details up to this point and will keep coming back to this post to do updates. Not sure if that&#39;s the best way to do it but it&#39;s what we&#39;ll do for now.
</p>
<p>
To get it out the way I paid $7380 for the surgery plus $400 for botox plus $40 wire fee for a total of $7820. The starting price has since gone up to $8400 if I&#39;m not mistaken, but I agreed to pay the old price back in 2021 before the price increase. I wired the money over from my bank early. I splurged on first class tickets for myself which is totally unnecessary but what I wanted for a total of $5300.57. My hotel of choice is the Conrad Hilton for another $3500 for 11 days. So all said I&#39;ll be out of pocket around $16,620 which is way more than necessary, but I have no clue if I&#39;m ever coming to Korea, so I wanted to experience it in the most comfortable way possible.
</p>

This was a solo trip for me. The flight over was pretty amazing. I flew from Las Vegas to San Francisco then San Francisco direct to Incheon International airport. I flew first class on both legs. The first leg was cool, but I honestly slept the whole way. I had done no packing so decided to wake up at 2am morning of my 8am flight and pack everything at once. I know, I know horrible decision, but I literally work 4 jobs and have zero time to prep if I don&#39;t take a day off.
</p>
<p>
Second leg was on United business class Polaris. I guess they don&#39;t call it first class anymore but anyway the Polaris seat was amazing. I&#39;d seen them on youtube before but experiencing it was way better. To be all by yourself in you own little pod and be able to fully lay the seat flat to sleep and they give you pajamas, slippers, a travel kit with sleep mask an other toiletries. Champagne while you wait for others to board. Decent food choices. All the drinks you could want. And the service was top notch. I fly the same on the way back and am really looking forward to it.
</p>

The airport checkpoint process with organized but a little bit of a world wind. You process through 5 or 6 different checkpoint each asking for either paperwork that was given to you to fill out on the plane or that had acquired from one of the previous checkpoints. After shuffling from one checkpoint to the other, we were corralled onto a bus and driven about 30 mins away to a quarantine hotel. If you look it up on google the hotel is listed as temporary closed so perhaps it&#39;s only quarantined people here. It&#39;s currently under construction from the area that we entered and checked in at. They help you download the self check app onto your phone to report if you have any symptoms or fever and then you pay your money and get your room key and it&#39;s off to your room. Once you enter you&#39;re in there for the next 7 days. Once I settled in I texted Jessie the name of the hotel that they took me too.
</p>
<p>
I know some people said they got to stay in some random really nice hotel, I did not get as lucky however. The room is small with two twin beds, one of which is just a bare mattress with no bedding. Theres a small desk with a bench attached and a bathroom. Theres a small safe, an electric kettle and luckily a mini fridge. There is no microwave however. I had watched other quarantine videos so I was prepared that the three meal a day that they deliver to your door are absolutely cold. I brought a little hot pot that I bought off of amazon just for this trip.
</p>
<p>
The meals I usually just take out the container of rice and the water bottle and the rest usually the rest ends up right in the trash as I don&#39;t enjoy eating cold food and my diet is quite particular so I don&#39;t like most of what&#39;s delivered. I brought top ramen, oatmeal and Mandarin oranges to supplement for the quarantine week.
</p>
<p>
Tow days into being here the delivered the checkout sheet that asks for your information and for you to pick how you will be departing. If you are getting picked up via car they want to know the driver&#39;s phone number and the car number aka license plate number. Pablo, a driver from Yeson, had previously messaged me on WhatsApp to let me know that they would be asking this information and had handily supplied me with both his phone number and the car number so that part was easy. I had two different choices for desired checkout time. I could either check out directly at Midnight at the end of the 7th day or I could checkout at 6am the following morning. I choose midnight as Pablo has already said this was not a problem with him and the sooner i can get out and quarantine jail :-) the better. If you didn&#39;t have a ride and needed to take the shuttle to either the train station or bus station then your checkout times were  7am or 7:30am the morning after the 7th day.
</p>
<p>
So right now is day 6 for me. Tomorrow night can&#39;t come soon enough :-). I went ahead and let the hotel know that I would be arriving around 1am so that they wouldn&#39;t cancel my reservation as a no show. They responded and insured that they would not cancel my reservation. So now I&#39;m just working and waiting. Next update will probably come this weekend after I make it to my hotel.
