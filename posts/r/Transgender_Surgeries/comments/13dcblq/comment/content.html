I stayed at the accommodation Siam Transformative provided. It was called Lumphini Park Nawamin. You can see on the map it’s very far away from the clinic and to be honest it was quite challenging to sit in the car for so long because of traffic. They insisted I stay there because it was close to nurse Cherry who lives in that apartment complex so I didn’t really have a choice.
</p>
<p>
As aforementioned, the journey from the hospital to the accommodation they insisted I use is very far and uncomfortable post-op so I would recommend you stand firm.

Thank you. Will keep that in mind. Not sure what happens now that Saphira and Cherry are not working together anymore. I have been only communicating with Saphira.

I wish people were more honest about comments. Not just because they are taking sides. The person that wrote a bad comment about the condo we provide didn’t even stay in this condo. Saphira and Cherry were still living in the Sukumvit area and she stayed right down the street from them. The reason we ask that you stay in this condo is because it’s 5 minutes from us. You have a problem or emergency we can be right there to help. You only have surgery once. I ride home from the hospital which is uncomfortable anywhere you go. But being close to both nurses is very important to us.

I did find the car ride to be a little unpleasant but it was manageable. If it was a daily trip it would totally suck but there was one day of heading to the clinic pre surgery, so zero problems there. Then the day of heading to the hospital, also no issues. The return from the hospital was not a great ride but honestly, way better than another minute in that hospital bed. The next trip back is not until follow up appointment with the doctor after about 2 more weeks. So the location doesn&#39;t really matter in my opinion. I would rather be close to my nurse so she can be here in a moment than close to the hospital where I have no reason to go to after discharge.

I had surgery with Siam Transformative and stayed in the flat in the Nawamin area that Becky arranged. I personally found it annoying to have to travel back and forth to the doctors clinic. Bangkok traffic is daunting. I was also frustrated that Cherry is the wound care nurse with years of experience with Dr. Teerapong (I think Becky is a retired respiratory nurse). While I’m sure Becky has some knowledge of wound care, she’s not what I paid $2,500 for. I never saw Cherry once. Becky dabbed saline on my stitches twice a day. I could have done that myself. I really struggled with after surgery blues and it would have helped a lot if I stayed in an area where I could go for walks and or to a cafe. If I were you, I would insist on staying in the Sukhumvit area so you’re only 5-10 minutes from Interplast. The Sukhumvit area has interesting shops, night markets, restaurants, salons, etc.

Thank you for the advise. I will surely ask to stay someplace not far from the clinic that has options for things i can do and explore. Did you stay there for a month?

Yes you stayed in a condo close to Sukhumvit because you didn’t have button surgery with Dr Thee. And you chose that one because it was 2 minutes from Saphira. Your friend did not have a 4 hour round trip. Before you start lying about anything please get the facts straight. Dr Thee is the one that wants his clients close to us. We are 30-45 minutes away from Interplast clinic. And just about anywhere in a city as big as Bangkok, it would take that long going anywhere. Becky and Cherry doesn’t live in the same complex anyway. So before you lie for anyone again please get your facts correct and if I remember correctly you even hated that area and eventually moved to another area even further away.

It is unsettling that you continue to attack patients in the community instead of accepting their valid feedback and making improvements and changes to your practice. Just an observation.

I had surgery with Dr. Theerapong through Siam Transformative. I stayed where they booked me which was a condo unit and it was about 30-45 minutes away from Dr. Theerapong&#39;s clinic by car.
</p>
<p>
I had no problems with the service of Siam Transformative itself and they are still helping me out to this day even though I am now 8 months post op.
</p>
<p>
There are shops nearby to walk to though they are small and mostly convenience stores. Also Cherry does NOT live in the condo apartments that they have you stay in. Cherry lives about 5 minutes away by car, about 15 minutes by foot.
</p>
<p>
Becky the translator does NOT do nursing stuff anymore due to age, and health issues. She can but it&#39;s really hard for her. Siam Transformative is Cherry&#39;s brain child, Becky came on board to help with translating Thai to english. Becky is originally from the United States so her english is really good and also she married her husband who is Thai so her Thai is also excellent.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend where they put you because it is a small studio apartment and it makes it easier getting to and from the bathroom especially post surgery because you will have difficulty at first after you return to the condo apartment.
</p>
<p>
As for the drive to Dr. Theerapong&#39;s clinic... you usually go in for the initial consult before surgery and then one last time before you are meant to go back home to the states. Yes it is a bit hard because of traffic, but we have traffic here in the States and would have happened anyway. Also you are sitting on donut pillows for the trip to the clinic and also for the trip back to the condo post surgery. I can personally vouch that Cherry visits every client and they usually had 3 other girls there while I was there too. Cherry visits twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the afternoon. If you are in any discomfort or pain post surgery or have any concerns they are a FB chat message away and they will come to you if it is an emergency.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what everyone elses experience was like and I cannot speak for them, but my experience was top notch and I paid for the extra long package for care while I was there due to going to Thailand alone and not having anyone there with me to help out.

Thank yoy for the insight. I am scheduled for surgery with Dr. Theerapong on August 8 thru Amani Thailand ( was Siam before). Did you also have colon vaginoplasty? Mine is actully a revision and the clinic recommended open technique to be able to address depth issues.

Yes I had colon technique for my own surgery. Mine was laparoscopic in nature since mine was not a revision but the initial GCS. Also they call it SRS in Thailand so be warned.
</p>
<p>
As for Amani Thailand that is not Siam Transformative. I can tell you that right now. If you want to know more DM me.
