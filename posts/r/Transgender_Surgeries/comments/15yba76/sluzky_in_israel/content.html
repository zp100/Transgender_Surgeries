I just found out that Dr. Sluzky is in Israel and wanted to let everyone here know. I missed a consult with her because I thought she was on Armenia time and she only told me about the move after.. Still don&#39;t know which city or if her prices have changed but will update when I find out more. She is very difficult to communicate with... Like 0/10 for communication...

Yeah I noticed the same sheâ€™s very slow at responding to emails as well ðŸ˜”
</p>
<p>
Still her good prices and skill make me want to try but itâ€™s a bit of a red flag. She should get a secretary or assistant if she canâ€™t keep it up herself

I&#39;m also pursuing it for her skill and prices but close to giving up and going with one of the other surgeons. I&#39;m just happy the CT scan ended up being free so that&#39;s not a sunk cost I need to worry about.
</p>
<p>
When she tried scheduling an appointment with me, she gave me two times. I suggested a third but said if it didn&#39;t work I would take the first. She never responded so I assumed it was the one she suggested. Had to wake up in the middle of the night for it. Turned out she chose the other time. And then didn&#39;t tell me she was in Israel&#39;s time zone anyway.
</p>
<p>
Sorry needed to rant a bit lol So yeah, agree that she should definitely get an assistant

</p>
<p>
How did you get the ct scan?

I told my local doctor about it and she said it won&#39;t be covered because FFS is not covered here but suggested that if I could come up with a &#34;medical&#34; reason for it, that it may be coverable. I ended up getting her to say that I need a rhinoseptoplasty to fix breathing issues from a deviated septum and she added all the other bones to the req form as well.
</p>
<p>
She told me I would probably still need to pay for it (since it wasn&#39;t just the nose) and even checked the private payer box but I guess the CT techs are so used to everything being covered that they didn&#39;t notice the box. lol So I was just lucky and haven&#39;t gotten a bill. But trying something similar might be worth a shot!

Iâ€™ll do my best but doubtful it will work since itâ€™s less about meeting to pay or not here and more like I canâ€™t get it unless I get a doctor to ask for it. I can get it privately tho but those are never paid for even if needed

Your doctor should just have to fill out a standard req form. That&#39;s what mine did. Same thing they would do if you were getting sent for an X-ray.
