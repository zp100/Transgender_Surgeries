I had srs 6 years ago. I was pretty unhappy with the results because it seemed i had extra tissue below the clitoris, which itself was also way too big for what I wanted, so the additional tissue just made that worse. I really didn’t like how it protruded like half an inch when spread, and how it pushed labia minora/hood forward so that stuck out when closed. So the clitoris and hood had a lot of bulk and dimension overall. It was disappointing because I specifically chose a surgeon (chett) who, I thought at the time made aesthetically smaller features than most surgeons. So I had a labiaplasty/clitoroplasty as a revision 3 years after by dr. mcginn. She did really great and solved my major concern by reducing the visible size of the clitoris and extra tissue around it.
</p>
<p>
However, labia minora/clitoral hood still protrudes when closed because of how thick the clitoral hood skin is, and I’m also still unhappy with how it looks when spread, since the clitoral hood skin is very thick, the whole part looks very wide and bulky, and still has more dimension than I would like as well.

I know every vulva looks different and they’re all normal and whatever, but all I care about is aesthetic, I didn&#39;t care about anything else. I expressed this to both surgeons I had. I asked both for small features and for the overall look to be compact and that the labia majora be closed when standing up. Both said they can do this, but I still don’t have that. I’m ace, so I was annoyed that maybe function was given precedence to aesthetic to begin with, despite me making it clear that that was exactly what I didn’t want to happen.
</p>

Overall I am very happy, especially after my second surgery. But is it possible for me to get something close to what I want? I’m asking here because I realize my results after my second surgery are very normal for srs, especially for an original surgery from 6 years ago, so I wonder if anyone else has successfully achieved something similar to what I’m looking for. I’ve been looking into normal plastic surgeons who do cis labiaplasties now, since two trans-specific surgeons haven’t been able to get the results I want. I haven’t had much luck reaching out to plastic surgeons yet, but im asking for any specific suggestions here.

Hi! I came across your post from years ago and was just curious if you had any luck finding help from a plastic surgeon who normally does labiaplasties on cis women?
