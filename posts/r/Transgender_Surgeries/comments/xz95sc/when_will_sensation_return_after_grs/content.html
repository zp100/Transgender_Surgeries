Hello everyone, I had grs early September and I still don‚Äôt really have much feeling down there. I can‚Äôt feel my clitoris at all. I know that it comes back gradually over time but I‚Äôm wondering what are your experiences with that? ‚ù§Ô∏è what kind of timeframe should I be expecting?

I think it&#39;s wildly variable. I started to get the small stabby pains of nerves reconnecting after about 6 weeks, I think? But it&#39;s only this week that my clitoris has fully come online. I&#39;m still a bit numb inside, but the sensation there seems to be getting better

Without being alarming, the fact that you don&#39;t have any sensation at all in your clitoris is unusual. Sensation can certainly be reduced from surgery trauma, but it&#39;s complete elimination may speak to a more in-depth complication. You should ask your surgeon about this and be very specific about the sensation you are referring to.

Around 8-11 weeks for me. Now I am totally sensate. Don&#39;t sweat it yet.
