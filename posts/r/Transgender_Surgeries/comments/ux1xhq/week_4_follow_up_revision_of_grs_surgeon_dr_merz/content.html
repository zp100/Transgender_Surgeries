Also in this week not much happened, douching is still hard, I&#39;m still sick, but i just was getting my finger inside my new kitty and it felt really numb inside and I have some stiches on the upper side in my vagina
</p>
<p>
Also dilation started with No. 1 and 2 of the vagiwell set but i will do it only every other day till the stiches are healed.
</p>
<p>
Depth is down from 13 cm to 8-9 cm
</p>
<p>
So overall i hope i can work myself up again and that my body might heal better and faster bit that&#39;s it for the first months
</p>
<p>
Next thread will come in July with the 3 months mark
</p>
<p>
As everytime, if you have any further questions just go ahead and ask :3

How has sensation been so far? You mention numbness, how was it before revision?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for keeping up with these! They&#39;re super helpful!  Looking forward to your 3 month update :)

Sensation on my vulva is there, labia majora are kinda numb, but everything else is sensitive (and orgasms are possible)
</p>
<p>
Numb is my vagina and this wasn&#39;t the case prior to revision, i have numbness on the downside and at the full depth, but they have done some stuff inside so I hope it&#39;s just the swelling and onces that&#39;s going down I get my feeling back

That&#39;s actually something I was curious about as it&#39;s hard to imagine what to expect for sensation after surgery.
</p>
<p>
I wish you a good recovery! It might be a good idea to mention the numbness to your surgeon?
