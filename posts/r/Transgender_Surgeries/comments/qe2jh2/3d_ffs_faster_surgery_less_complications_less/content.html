I posted because I was being asked very often about it. For bony work, we need to evaluate it before the surgery, in old times, we used to order a face x-ray for the forehead and a ct scan for the mandible then, we would manually  measure the parameters and angles  and calculate where to cut and how to reposition the bone. Nowadays, we order a specific CT scan and in the computer with the help of an engineer, a 3-D image is done, all the teeth roots and nerves are marked in red and marked as protected zones and bone cuttings are simulated based on female angles and sizes. Then, the bone change is simulated on the soft tissue and we can see in the computer what would be the final look after the swelling is gone (6 months). Once the surgeon is satisfied w the angles, a  real size 3-D image from the real patient&#39;s mandible is printed as well as the simulated post op. For a faster surgery, instead of getting a ruller and keep measuring each bone intra op,  cutting guides are printed as well.  Once the bone is exposed, the guide is placed,  bone marked and we cut knowing we are not damaging any nerve or root. We compare the resected bone to the model.   Also, instead of having 3 different plates and multiple screws, a custom plate is manufactured.  It decreased the surgery in at least  1 h. It can be done for the forehead, to custom cheek implants and for the mandible.

Looks like a 3d printed jaw bone and another which is &#34;post surgery&#34;? And then the brackets maybe measure the difference in changes to guide actual surgery? Idk I&#39;m guessing.

Yup, you&#39;re probably right. Those &#39;surgical guards&#39; are positioned and angled exactly where they make the cuts in the bone in FFS surgery.

Found something actually similar a few days ago. Personally I think these are genius if measured per person individually.
<a href="https://youtu.be/gk_EgQMTHlk">FFS Individual Guides
</a>
</p>
<p>
Personally I am happy that Dr. FENSTERER is doing all of this to show us that she cares how these procedures get done.
</p>
<p>
Haven&#39;t seen any other FFS Surgeon who shows so much empathy to our community so far. Just their work and accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
Personally the only thing that is missing are unique advancements and or post surgical care such as the Korean and European Hospitals that perform Feminization Surgeries.

Yes, because before, I needed to check where the nerve  and teeth roots location were, measure on the or table, compare with my measurements, re check, and check multiple times (do you know that saying measure twice, cut once? In this case, it is measure10 x, cute once) place the markings, then cut, choose which plate fits netter, bend the plates, measure the holes depth, chose screws. With the CT planned cutting guides, I don&#39;t need to measure anything, just place it, mark and cut because I did all that ahead. I also have information  about the bone thickness and  I don&#39;t need to measure the hole depth. With only one custom plate, instead of 3 (3 plates),  I go through this process only once instead of 3. I also have more information about patients specific anatomy and that is a safety feature for the surgeon bc I know where I can go faster and where I need to go slower bc some critical structure.

Yes and insurance pays for it if your plan covers FFS. If not covered, and patient wants it, the additional cost is $10k to the procedure. If that is not covered and patient can&#39;t afford the extra cost, we can do old school bc we have been doing the old way for over 10 years. I actually have improved my technique based on what I have learned with the 3-D prints.

If you see the second picture, there are some red structures, one looks like a line going back. That is the nerve. Then, the computer recognizes that are as no cutting zone..so the surgical guide is calculated under that. The other red structures are the teeth roots..no cutting there either. The surgical guide is made only below that area

Given the fact that my mandibular molars have failed one after the other subsequent to my FFS 6 years ago, I would say this could be a really important leap forward.

Yes, the nerve and the roots are both inside of bone so the surgeon can only predict the locations. In the past, I needed to measure in the CT scan and draw each measurement on the patient.

I am sorry that happened to you. But, the guides are to protect nerve and teeth roots, the surgeon is the one who decides where the cuts should be from that point.  I still calculate the proportions and manipulate the computer model but I confess I have been more aggressive with the resection after using the computer.  The surgery itself is still difficult and tools don&#39;t replace skills, just facilitate it.  There is one specific thing about what you said though.  When I first saw the guides being used, the resident screwed it and cut the bone with the guide on the patient he not only cut the guide itself but lost it inside. It was not pretty from a technique standpoint.  Based on that, after I screw it, I mark and then I repeat on the other side. Get my old school ruler and check. Only after that I cut without the guide on my way. That avoids the guides moving and also blocking my view.  However I am very glad you said that bc it is rare to hear from  surgeons who do FFS complications or unsatisfied patients, and I personally became more aggressive in the angle resection.Now that you said that, I might go back to be a little more conservative.
<br>
I also combine face lift with FFS if I think there is too much skin in the area bc the surgeon should predict that the skin will sag.  Specific about your problem, if a patient of mine would complaint of asymmetry or too much was taken, I would inject radiesse there. It is a filler made of calcium. I use that filler to masculinize the angles ( I did it on my husband ). That can also be use to correct asymmetries. In regards to your skin, there are some non surgical methods to rejuvenate it (Ulthera, thermi, laser, etc) or  just go ahead and do the face/ neck lift if there is too much skin. I am sorry that was not a good surgery for you but I would like to thank you for exposing the problem, that will make me go back to my re think my  measurements again.  I would like to invite more people to tell me what went wrong in their surgeries so I can improve myself.

Me too. I look really weird from the front because butcher Bart took too much and cut the nerve canals.  The only lucky thing is my angles were untouched. But from the front my face looks really narrow and long with depressions to the side of the jaw.

Computer  models have been used for a long time, I remember  the surgeons using 3-D models when I was a medical student in Brazil and that was 25 y ago.   We used for  skull defect and also on severe facial  congenital deformities. There are other uses in other body defects too. It is natural to improve the technique and once familiar with it,  adapt it for other uses. For example, I use intra op CT for traumatic  facial fractures to check if the bone and plates are well aligned and I can&#39;t wait to have a more complicated FFS  case  so I can  justify the costs  to insurance but for now, bc of costs, I can&#39;t use it but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if in a few years, that will be the new thing for FFS.

Well there&#39;s certainly more to it than using 3d models outside surgery itself and, as you say, it&#39;s natural for the practice to evolve. They&#39;ve been used in medicine for decades after all. Here&#39;s the video Facial Team put together if you&#39;re interested. They&#39;ve been publishing literature on this subject a while. They&#39;ve pioneered this approach for the surgery in question. The geometry is actually used in situ as a guide, like your approach I think?

Yes, I am aware of them. I am currently in Brazil to talk about trans health ( not only surgery).

A local surgeon in the Seattle area helped write a paper on it recently and I stumbled across it randomly. I am planning on getting a consult with Dr. Michael J. Nuara as my insurance covers his work and the 3d printed guides are really a great idea. Here is the paper I am referencing.

Well, first I thought that anyone could do that now bc in the past, we did it all manually and we needed to know the proportions but now the computer presents the plan ready. However, bc I was so used to the old school, I found myself changing the model very frequently. I don&#39;t know what algorithm the computer uses but for me,  it is not perfect but works  as a safety tool. Bc we can&#39;t see the roots or nerves in the surgery bc they are inside the bone, the models basically tell my limit but I am the one who draws the cuts and decide bone advancements.
