Instead of rehashing the entire story i&#39;m going to just post something else I wrote with key information missing for legal reasons. Side note, I had C cups before and lost about 115 pounds. I was at the bare minimum needed for a breast lift. I&#39;m a small B cup now.
</p>
<p>

Following your plan of getting a breast lift done first and the augmention is the worst choice I have ever made. When I first met with you back in September or October I explained my breast goals to you that I wanted them to be large. But your insistence on doing them separately has ruined my chest.
</p>
<p>
In the past several months I have seen several plastic surgeons (at least 7) for different body lift options include breast lifts. I have also consulted with other plastic surgeons after I had my breast lift done , on what can be done to achieve the results I want. Each one had their own ideas and there was no clear vision on that, however each and every surgeon including a surgeon that is a friend of yours that you referred me to, did not agree with you that doing a breast lift first would help me achieve my goals. Some even said that with my case of laxity that a breast lift in one procedures and breast augmentation in another wouldn&#39;t be needed at all.
</p>
<p>
Since I trusted your medical option, which might have been the worst choices I have ever made, I no longer have the skin needed to reach my goals. I did beforehand, but now I donâ€™t. Iâ€™m sure you have some articles you can link me too and thatâ€™s great, but the fact that several other board certified plastic surgeons (we&#39;re up to 7 surgeons now saying this) in unison are saying, YOU ARE WRONG IN HER CASE holds far more value than any link.
</p>
<p>
When I asked you why the lift and augmentation canâ€™t be done at the same time you said that you canâ€™t bill a covered procedure (breast augmentation) and a cosmetic procedure (the breast lift at the same time). First of all patient care comes first as well as the physical results, not billing mandates. Second of all, Iâ€™m not sure why a zero charge canâ€™t be sent out with the cpt codes using for the breast lift, with a payment agreement signed for the breast lift. Units get billed out to my insurance company, cpt codes with zero charges donâ€™t have denials since thereâ€™s no charge but accurate cpt reporting is followed and payment is received by patient for the cosmetic procedure. Honestly though, this is a point that is really looking past one thing. If you canâ€™t do the procedure which would be best for me (lift and aug at the same time) then you should not be giving me any medical opinion since you are a surgeon that will not be able to help me reach my goals, but infact hinder them.
</p>
<p>
Hereâ€™s just a small things of things Iâ€™ve lost because I listened to your opinion: The time wasted going through an unnecessary breast lift, the cost of that lift, being out of work for 1 month so thatâ€™s one most of lost wages and having to wait several months until my scars healed enough that I can have a breast augmentation. I will now need to go through at least 2 different breast augmentation surgeries to get myself to the size I want to spaced about 6-12 months apart, and that would be in total 2 months out of work. So 15 monthsâ€¦. 15 months to get to the place I wanted to be at if did the breast aug+lift at the same timeâ€¦ The surgical costs aside and lost wages aside, I donâ€™t have time to wait. The fact that I have to wait so long to get where I need to be is the most upsetting part of all of this. Just if you receive another formerly overweight patient, do them a favor and refer them to someone else that can actually help them. Trusting something else with my medical care is something I would do a heartbeat, it canâ€™t be undone. I canâ€™t reach the goals I want now and that is solely because I trusted you.

This surgeon also has a long history of using transphobic language in his website as well as his personal notes. A lot of patients put these aspects aside because he has good bedside manor. I really am just done... Other surgeons are telling me the same thing, I don&#39;t have the amount of skin needed, not only that but if I didn&#39;t do the breast lift beforehand my breasts would be more centered as well after the implants were put in... He ruined me because I listened to his medical opinion. I don&#39;t get a second chance or a way to go back, it&#39;s all over. It really feels like a lot of trans specialists just hate us and want to exploit us because so many of us are in a weakened state.

Del Corral. Maybe he&#39;s better at somethings than others, but if you&#39;ve lost weight and want breast augmentation, I would advise you get a second opinion before moving forward with a 2-staged breast augmentation.
