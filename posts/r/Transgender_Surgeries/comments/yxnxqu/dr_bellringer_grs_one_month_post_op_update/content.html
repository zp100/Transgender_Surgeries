Hello,
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been slightly over a month now since I had a surgery with Mr Bellringer. Just wanted to post some photos and ask some questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
How does it look overall compared to the previous photos that I&#39;ve posted overall? Also Is the hematoma and wound dehiscence looking good?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;m still concerned about the vulvas size, they look unnaturally big to me, will the swelling continue to come down?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;ve noticed a few weird red dots around vulvas - what are they? Are they normal? Are they going to fade away? Do I need anything to treat them?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Is it safe to start using Ibuprofen to help healing and swelling? I had hematoma on one side previously as well as wound dehiscence and been told not to use Ibuprofen?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Is it safe to start using any creams such as Arnica to aid healing and swelling now?
</p>
</li>
</ol>

I had work done with Dr. BBL and have a similar looking vulva.  I had some concern about the lack of definition of the labia when compared to other people.  Mine felt very big and puffy to me too.  The doctor said though this is really a function of our own anatomy.  Your vulva looks really good to me and you seem to be healed pretty well for only one month from surgery.  It‚Äôs actually been over a year now for me and swelling has gone down s‚Äômore but the overall look is the same.  My surgeon offered to do a revision of the aesthetics of my vulva still bothered me but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth it for the risk.

Yes I totally get it. Don&#39;t mind not having big labia personally too.

Ask your surgeon about when you are clear to take NSAIDs again. To my understanding, the reason they don&#39;t want post-op folks to take ibuprofen for a while is cause it can increase bleeding in some cases, which may be dangerous. I had to wait 3 weeks before I could go back on the daily NSAID I am on. I imagine since you had a hematoma they may have you wait a bit longer.

Yes I do! But no bleeding for the last two weeks. Also started with the purple dilator few days ago... Intimidating and not easy at all! You on purple too?

Im not bleeding too, just had a considerable bleeding two weeks ago, but I think it was because I hurted a stitch while douching... im on the second size, but my dilators have no color, so I think it is the equivalent to the purple one. (Which is very intimidating!)

Not sure why I&#39;m being downvoted, literally everyone I have ever dated with a vulva looks like this aside from the surgery scars which will heal.

many trans women are obsessed with having highly visible labia minora, unlike cis women who have surgery to remove all or part of the labia minora.

I‚Äôve had a few clients who were disappointed in their small labia minora, I explained that cis women want that. I taught a few girls the phrase ‚Äúporn pussy‚Äù.

There&#39;s a reason why we want it: the clitoris is supposed to be covered by skin, to avoid rubbing against hair and pants, which is ANNOYING and uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
OTOH, too much clitoral hood feels uncomfortable, so you want to cut it a little bit.
</p>
<p>
No obsession at all, sorry.

I think this could lead to problematic expectations‚Ä¶ SRS labia minora will never look the same as cis labia minora just due to the techniques used right now. I think the large majora looks great!

One month isn&#39;t a long time. My surgeon said surgical site swelling would take 6 months to a year to resolve. It took about eight months. Your labia look great.

I think this looks like a very natural shape, the outer labia is supposed to be kind of puffy and many people have a small inner labia or wish they did.

Hi, I had my surgery with Mr Bellringer nearly 17 months ago now and as I recall the appearance of mine at one month post op was very similar. I&#39;d keep an eye on the wound dehiscence just in case it progresses onto granulation though. Fortunately if it does as it&#39;s external it&#39;s easily treated with Betnovate steroid cream (I also had internal granulation which Mr Bellringer treated with silver nitrate at my follow up appointment). The dots to me look like from where some sutures were and I would expect them to probably disappear in time.  Your labia majora will reduce in time (remember it takes about 12 months to achieve the final appearance) but slightly large labia majora tend to be a Bellringer &#39;trade mark&#39; so to speak and I&#39;m happy with mine being on the larger side. I also had a scar from inguinal hernia surgery as a small child that Mr Bellringer had to work into the surgery and how he&#39;s done it is a work of genius. It&#39;s interesting what&#39;s been said about labia minora, as mine are quite discreet and hidden but that&#39;s fine by me. My cis wife has quite prominent labia minora and she hates them and thinks that they&#39;re ugly. I probably wouldn&#39;t take Ibuprofen at this stage though. I think I would probably wait until things were a little more healed until you use Arnica but I think Bio Oil on your healed sutures would probably be OK.  All in all it&#39;s a good result xxxx

Hey Giseleeee!
</p>
<p>
I had a check up with Dr Bellringer around two weeks ago. On positive the scarring healed really well. I was religiously applying bio oil at least once a day, I&#39;m not sure if it did help but yes I&#39;m pleased with that bit. On the negative, dr Bellringer spotted bit of a skin excess especially when I&#39;m standing up which I hoped he&#39;s gonna spot and I&#39;m gonna have to go for revision. Had a mixed feelings whether I should stick with him or change the surgeon to Tina Rashid but in the end went with him as it&#39;s a bit of a faff to change the surgeon and he reassured me me he&#39;s gonna do his best. Not complaining really and glad he was able to admit that yes it could do some retouch, will be posting once it&#39;s done.. Regards!
