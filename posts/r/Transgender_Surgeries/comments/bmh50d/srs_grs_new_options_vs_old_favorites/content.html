Hi, so I am in the early stages of trying to pick and SRS / GRS surgeon. I would probably go with Supporn but two things concern me. First, Supporn retired and I am not sure about being with his replacement until they have more experience under their belt - I could go with one of the other top Thai places I guess.
</p>
<p>
Also, there is all this talk of the new and way better method which possibly being done by a few surgeons, but I am not even sure if it is just an urban myth! Is it called PPV?
</p>
<p>
Does anyone have direct experience of this new method? Priyamed in India I believe do it?
</p>

Bank is just as skilled as Suporn. Nothing to worry about there!

I would even argue that he&#39;s doing a better job than Suporn, so far what I&#39;ve seen from the girls that went with Banks it&#39;s all great and even made me decide to go with him as well.

I am guessing the new method you are referring to is Peritoneal Pull through.
</p>
<p>
They surgeon takes tissue from the peritoneal lining of the abdomen and uses it to form the vaginal wall. This has been done for 50 years on women born with MRKH syndrome.
</p>
<p>
This method is being performed at Mt. Sinai by Doctors Ting, Bowers and maybe Avanessian.
</p>
<p>
At NYU they are using the Peritoneal lining in addition to penile inversion for extra depth.
</p>
<p>
In San Francisco, Dr Heidi Wittenberg is offering Peritoneal pull through, but has expressed concerns about the long term effects, as they have never even been properly studied in cis women. As of February she had done 9 of these, and preferred to mainly reserve it for women in need of a revision.

The million dollar question seems to be go with a known name such as Supporn and get a relatively well known result but with the need for dilation and generally no or limited lubrication (yes I know lots of women say they do lubricate but in theory I believe it is not self lubricating).
</p>
<p>
Or, go for the relatively new PPV which is supposed to self lubricating and needs less dilation and not a lifetime of dilation but it is relatively new and the long term results are as yet unknown.
</p>
<p>
Mmm. Difficult decision.

I met a girl who had Dr. Ting&#39;s PPV technique. Yeah, she is self-lubricating ALL THE TIME!
</p>
<p>
She told me it never stops. She has to wear pads everyday and expects to have to for life.
</p>
<p>
Her words to me were, don&#39;t do it!

In theory I should wait a few years and see how the world looks then.

Yeah the self lubrication gotten via the Peritoneal method isnâ€™t tied to arousal, so thatâ€™s something to keep in mind.
</p>
<p>
Also when I talked to Wittenberg about it, she plainly said that undergoing this procedure meant signing up to be a guinea pig, and while some are ok with that, itâ€™s important to recognize.

The short term results aren&#39;t entirely known either. How much do you really know about it?

If interested Dr Kamol is great heâ€™s one of the top surgeons in Thailand. He trained with Suporn when they studied under Dr Preecha. If interested in information feel free to message me.

I think the reason that the PPT method is used on cis women with MRKH is because they do not have the sexual tissue available that we have to make the vaginal canal with. In Suporns method this would be the scrotal tissue. I believe that the PPT method is similar to the sigmoid colon technique and its &#39;whet ness&#39; is not nessarily tied to arousal.
