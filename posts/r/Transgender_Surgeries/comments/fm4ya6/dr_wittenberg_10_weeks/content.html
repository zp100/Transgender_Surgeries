I&#39;m 33, and this is penile inversion.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m feeling like a normal person again! Plus having a vagina is already feeling normalized. (Of course I&#39;ve always had it. üòã)
</p>
<p>
Around week 8, I started testing my ability to drive again. I found myself able to drive to and from errands (plus walking around). If I absolutely had to return to work, this would be the first point I would consider it doable for me.
</p>
<p>
There are still stitches in place, and hooks are still pushing their way out (see scab on the left). I&#39;m hopeful that they&#39;ll be dissolved or pushed out over the next three weeks.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still on the blue (second smallest) dilator, and the next size up won&#39;t fit past the bend. Plus there&#39;s still muscle or something that&#39;s pushing in from the top and right side. Nothing I&#39;m too worried about as it just takes a bit of pantience for this to loosen up and make way for the dilator each time.
</p>
<p>
The only only other thing I can think of is that I&#39;ve been wearing panty liners for the past few weeks because of the lube that leaks out after dilation. However, the amount of lube I need to use has gone down considerably and I haven&#39;t had discharge in weeks, so I&#39;ve stopped even using pantyliners.

One thing that helps me is to initially put the dilator in while standing up and pushing your hips forward (like you&#39;re doing a hip thrust). This will roll your pubic bone out of the way a bit so that the bend isn&#39;t so sharp of an angle

You‚Äôre kitty looks ready pretty, but I just went on her site &amp; the ones in her gallery just do not look good for me personally. Did you see other pictures that made you go with her ? Or did you just trust her ? You results are amazing

Thank you so much! And yes. Another one of her girls mentioned in their journaled experience that Dr. Wittenberg has far more (and better) results not shown on her site. I asked to see these when I went for my consultation (and you should do as well if you visit). There were so many great looking ones; it absolutely won me over.
</p>
<p>
Her reasoning is that she doesn&#39;t want to show just the best results on her site. I very much appreciate that mentality, but I also feel that she could put at least a few more of the good ones up.
</p>
<p>
As a side note, in case you want a similar look, I specifically asked for smaller labia majora (since I&#39;m thinner and I felt it would fit my body type better).

You&#39;re welcome. I felt the same way, but I kinda figured I&#39;d be happy just having a vagina that the particulars wouldn&#39;t be an issue.
</p>
<p>
Now that it&#39;s all over, I&#39;m about 50/50 on getting a revision. I certainly don&#39;t need it: visually and functionally things are great. However I was hoping that my labia minora would be a little more pronounced. (Trying to get a copy of my 6-month follow-up photo.) That&#39;s probably my only complaint, and I&#39;d really only ever bother with a revision if my insurance fully covers it too.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best, and I hope you find the surgeon that best fits what you need. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Thanks! It&#39;s hard to tell the difference without the side-by-side comparison, so I didn&#39;t even notice myself until I posted this.

This is some seriously good healing for 10 weeks. I know everyone is different but it looks like you&#39;ve got really lucky in that respect. How are you feeling in terms of tiredness at the moment? I know some people have said they feel exhausted for months afterwards and find it hard to return to regular life just because of that alone.

I&#39;m regularly exhausted by dinner time, but I push myself to stay up and stick to as normal of a sleep schedule as I can. Glad to hear this is expected. I wasn&#39;t too worried about it, but it still sucks that it occurs daily.

Yeah a lot of people have that exhaustion, it‚Äôs pretty normal, your energy will come back with time. I hope that it comes back quickly for you though!

Result looks amazing üôèüèª‚úåüèª but thats to be expected from Dr. Wittenberg, i want Dr. Jess Ting or her to do my Peritoneal vaginaplasty if possible ü•∞üôèüèª tho i always wonder why people&#39;s pussies are so hairy, dont they laser or electrolysis the whole area down there? (its funny people always get butthurt and downvote me if i just ask stuff like this, im not trying to offend anyway) üòù

The areas that will be external don&#39;t require hair removal (though I intend to do once I&#39;m healed enough). It&#39;s just the parts that will be internal, and yes, I did those parts. I was able to get ~90% of it done in three months of electrolysis, and the rest was cauterized during surgery. Like I was told, plan for 6+ months of removal.

Nice plan, you can always remove the outer hairs yea. Atleast you got your wonderfull looking vagene ü§≠üôèüèªüåπ I already removed most hairs with laser hair removal altho not electrolysis. So a few fuzzy white hairs stil remain ‚òπÔ∏è also i dont think i need it removed 100% if i opt for Peritoneal vaginaplasty because its a peice of colon. It selflubricates and cleans wich i want because i worry hairs or different stuff will get stuck all the way back in the vagina if i went with penile inversion, even tho people say i should just douche, but its my fear. I wonder if the inside sensation you get from being penetrated is the same or if there&#39;s a difference between penile inversion and Peritoneal vaginaplasty

It&#39;s not really visible here. Even when I spread my vagina, it&#39;s not super obvious, but it&#39;s there, in the correct position. I promise. And it functions just like any other woman&#39;s.
