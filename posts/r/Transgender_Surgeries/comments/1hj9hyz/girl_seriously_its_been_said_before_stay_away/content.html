Honestly it&#39;s been said and re said before. And I was dumb enough to believe it couldn&#39;t be that bad. It is. Fraudulent practice, bad doctors. It&#39;s all true.
</p>
<p>
Just as an example, I met Kamol at 10 am for my pot surgery, he and his claim and still lie to people that he does all surgeries. I waited in the room and my surgery started around 10pm. 12 hours after meeting him. Girls claim he sometimes take 4-7 hours for this surgery. So after working 12 hours, he started mine??? I have no clue who did mine. I have 1 labia, it looks like straight up garbage.
</p>
<p>
The staff is being abuse. Going there is like buying shirts from a factory you know they abuse kids.
</p>
<p>
Stay away at all cost. Do not believe any positive reviews from this place. I found online 5 stars reviews of people working there who never had surgery claiming they had an amazing surgery.
</p>
<p>
At every possibility they will try to ask for more money on things included, will never refund you if you have prepaid and they didn&#39;t do the procedure. And if by chance you get lawyers or people with influence involved they will claim it&#39;s miscommunications.
</p>
<p>
I cannot described how disgusting these people are. Poor staff..... nurse sleeping on the ground during Night Shift. Scared of speaking up.
</p>
<p>
This place is a disgrace to Thailand. And any medical organisation, conf√©rence, meeting out there should ban and/ call out dr. Kamol for his butchering fraudulent behaviour.

It happens.
</p>
<p>
People go anyway. Despite ALL the alarms and advice,  they go,  for reasons you won&#39;t understand.  Sometimes it&#39;s because the money.  it&#39;s cheaper. Sometimes... it&#39;s another personal thing, like a mindset.

Yeah because sometimes Kamol doesn&#39;t have his prot√©g√©s do the surgery and does it himself. But this isn&#39;t the kind of lottery I&#39;d ever want to play in.

I was very seriously considering Kamol as they market themselves as the number one place to go in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
But after someone I coincidentally meet referred me here to see people‚Äôs experiences I have changed my mind as it just seems to risky. If you‚Äôre not online much I think it would be easy to get a positive marketing impression.

Yep everything there is done so that you need to pay more. The amount of girls that were there that had issues with their surgery is crazy. Bunch of girls were there to ‚Äúswitch‚Äù cuz ppv had issued and then needed Colon and bunch had issues with colon and needed another surgery obviously. And the worst is that madam dare to claim on Facebook that Kamol does all surgeries unless a patient request another lol. They take the community for complete idiots.

It is strange when people badmouth Kamol and say that you shouldn&#39;t believe any positive opinion.
</p>
<p>
When I hear such claims, I always wonder whether these critics are former employees who were fired due to their unreliability or whether they are employees of other competitors.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Regarding your false statement about reimbursement - I paid money for my SRS with PPV in 2024, which was of course more than the colon SRS that was then performed. And I got the difference reimbursed by Kamol without being asked to do so.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bad surgical results - why do we so rarely see pictures of such bad results and usually only simple claims and insinuations, but no evidence?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
To be clear, the healing process is not only subject to the surgeon&#39;s performance, but also or even more to the patient&#39;s living conditions.
</p>
<p>
Alcohol consumption, smoking, drugs, age, physical fitness, self-discipline and also other surgeries that have already been performed - all of this has an influence on the healing process.
</p>
<p>
And I&#39;m not saying that because I&#39;m a fan of Kamol, but because I studied medicine for a while myself.
</p>
<p>
Is Kamol perfect? ‚Äã‚ÄãNo, not at all, and no other doctor is perfect either.
</p>
<p>
Almost every doctor has patients who are not satisfied with the results.
</p>
<p>
For example, Dr. Bank, Suporn&#39;s successor, also has complications and results where patients are disappointed.
</p>
<p>
The reasons can be incredibly varied and not necessarily due to poorly performed work.
</p>
<p>
So please be fair and discuss objectively and, above all, honestly!
</p>
<p>
After all, it&#39;s about people who want to help transsexuals.

Lol. Honestly girl stop posting here you are hurting people and loosing all credibility. Defending Kamol. Is like stating fighting a bear hand is no dangerous.
</p>
<p>
If you were being honest. You would say communication was terrible, nurses were sleeping on the ground at night and were over worked. You barely met Kamol. He probably drew line on you and someone else did the surgery. Like he does for almost everyone.
</p>
<p>
Personally everyone who defend this places is or delusional or as incentive from them to so.
</p>
<p>
Way too many warning flags about this place. At best someone who was satisfied with their results would simple stay quiet. Due the the third world quality is services and they way they treat employee, steal money.
</p>
<p>
As I stated on my other responses on this tread. She knows who I am she knows the damage they did ans the way they acted and they know I am coming after them. So no I am not an employee. More someone who wants to make sure not a single trans girl goes there to get screwed, damaged, stolen, etc.

Have you never heard of freedom of expression?
</p>
<p>
Just because there are people who are happy with Kamol, it would be very strange and distorted to prohibit them from expressing their opinions.
</p>
<p>
What you are doing is simply slander!
</p>
<p>
I have to hide, I have a picture in my profile and I can prove every statement I make with pictures.

Bah it‚Äôs the fact that I have been there multiple times because I made friends there. And the things I saw and I heard.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm sorry but Germans were pulling out people from their house to send them on never coming back train. I would not have been promoting‚Äùhey guys Europe is amazing you should go there right now ‚Äù and then claim freedom of expression as my way. If you love them so much. Reach out to Vanessa and ask her to share with you the picture of the girl that they altered to hide the fact they stole money from her. She will know exactly who she is. Then come back to me champ.

Please don&#39;t be mad at me, but I&#39;m increasingly suspecting that you are actually Layal. The employee who was fired from Kamol some time ago and who, in her frustration, deleted surgery appointments from the in-house surgery planning calendar in order to harm Kamol and hope that these would be potential patients for another clinic that you wanted to switch to.
</p>
<p>
I heard this story yesterday from another German girl from Hanover when she found out that I was also from Germany and told me that her surgery appointment had not taken place because of Layal&#39;s behavior.
</p>
<p>
You know, I think it&#39;s really wrong to use a pseudonym to protect the reputation of people who only want to help you.
</p>
<p>
I had my revision surgery at Kamol yesterday, which went brilliantly, just like my VFS, cone shave and SRS in January.
</p>
<p>
The staff are super nice. English is sometimes a bit bumpy - but I&#39;m still getting by well.
</p>
<p>
The revision was carried out on me by Kamol personally with another doctor. This morning Dr. Kamol came to see me and said that he was very happy with the result.
</p>
<p>
Me too, and so was a friend from Switzerland who, based on my results, now wants to have her outer labia tightened by Kamol.
</p>
<p>
I can only repeat myself - I am really very happy with Kamol and can recommend him with the utmost confidence.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t believe it - I can send pictures from yesterday afternoon, i.e. before my revision operation, and also after pictures that I took just a few hours ago.
</p>
<p>
Everything is so good that I can move to K-Garden right away and go to my booked AirBnB in the middle of Bangkok next week.
</p>
<p>
I am really incredibly sorry for you that your life is not going the way you would like it to, but please don&#39;t blame other people who only offered you opportunities and don&#39;t ruin their existence by spreading untruths.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and today I will try to find the employee Vanessa, with whom you obviously have a personal problem.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if she will answer my questions, but I am really curious to hear the description of the people you accused.

Lol. Who the hell is Layal. The simple fact I‚Äôm not him or her, not sure the pronoun on that names. Simply points out even more my point.you actually name other people. Supporting what I am saying. And the simple fact that you are there right now? Again raise some concerns lol. How about you make a voice video if it‚Äôs so great. And why r√©vision already? Wait you paid again the k garden for stays etc etc. Girl more you write more you prove my point. Like seriously‚Ä¶. I am not an employee nor was an employee. Just someone who felt so bad for the nurses sleeping ok the floor that I bought yoga mats for every nurse on Night Shift when I was out of surgery and saw that. (Grab). Find Vanessa and ask her if a client ever bought mats for the nurses cuz they were sleeping on the ground. She ll probably lie cuz that‚Äôs all she does. But ask the nurse on the 5th floor.

<p>
And also here are the price for both surgeries. ¬†Sorry it came out black copy paste. But they are both at 17.500$ usd
</p>
<p>
So to claim yourself that you got money back from switching is an utterly lied and simply confirms you posted here to promote them so you are fake. Or you actually got screwed the first time.
</p>
<p>
And if you did indeed get money back. Cuz they were screwing you. Since et you had it in 2024. And now they know in their case and they have been reported to multiple countries they deal with, all their accreditation as well as the Royal police, their health department, the united nation for the treatment of foreign workers, etc etc.¬† So you probably got your money back because of what I am doing and know they are being scrutinized or will be ok the accounting side.
</p>
<p>
But the simple fact you claim ppv is more expensive it‚Äôs a lie. It‚Äôs the same was colon. And those price were for surgeries in 2024.
</p>
<p>
If you have a hard time reading it simply make it back bigger to make easier.
</p>
<p>
Also need that ¬†price include the hotel stay 21 days post up that they everytime trey to charge the person for it blaming it on miscommunication when they bring proofs it says it‚Äôs included.
</p>
<p>
I bet you probably even paid for your room. Maybe that‚Äôs what they gave you back reeling you it‚Äôs the surgery price difference cuz they want to keep scamming people.
