I was very much in the same place. The healing was not linear. Some says the incisions hurt more than others or things that seemed to be healing opened up a bit with dehiscence. Things will get better just take it one day at a time them one day you will cross a threshold and just feel better and not really know what specifically made the difference. Hang in there you got this! Also YES continue dilation even through it all, great job ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I had surgery on a Tuesday, and I think by Thursday I did my first walk with the physical therapist, and as the days went by, I was doing it more often, and, by the 7th day I was getting up more.  Everyday I get more active.  I was in the hospital for 10 days, and I‚Äôve been at home alone and I do pretty much everything, like cooking, and very light stuff. My sister helped me clean the house and my fiends helped me throw my garbage. Last Tuesday after my doctor‚Äôs visit.  I went to Walgreens walking, went to the store, and then had to go back to Walgreens later that day.  That day I was super active. I walked a little weird and slow but I get things done.  Mainly I‚Äôve been home resting

Yes, I‚Äôm a lot more tired now,  dilating is not bad, I feel the pressure and the tightness but not really pain, but where I feel the constant pain is around stitches in the labia.

Keep at it.  Mine got worse before it got better.  I think worst was around week 3.  By 4 weeks I was def seeing the end of the tunnel.  Not the same surgeon, but I think this would be relatable across the board.  I&#39;m 7 weeks now.  I&#39;m out of the house for more than half the day now. Even managed to do some car repairs.  Very tight after of course.  But it&#39;s coming along nicely.  You just gotta give it a tiny bit more time and you&#39;ll be over the same hill yourself.
