So had my appointment this morning at ten, my girlfriend had her year and a couple months checkup slightly earlier than me, so I got there around eight for my appointment. I&#39;d previously had two consults with other doctors whom I ultimately didn&#39;t go with due to a feeling of unease in the consult, [Whitehead and Ghallager, respectively] and was surprised at how easy this was, they took me back at nine after a very quick and streamlined check in, had me do the standard triage thing of blood pressure, medications, etc. Then took me to an exam room to speak with an associate.
</p>
<p>
The associate was very friendly and answered what few questions I had &lt;namely about my bellybutton piercing and if I could continue to get my estrogen pellet implant prior to surgery,&gt; handed me some little red robes, told me to undress from the waist down, and put the robe on for a examination from Dr BBL and Zhao. I ended up waiting for a while afterwards, but they showed up on time for my actual appointment [around 10 or so] and Dr Bluebond was very friendly and basically told me the same things the associate had. I&#39;m a little bit overweight so they told me to either try and lose a little weight or just don&#39;t gain any, which, fair. Then I was examined, to which she remarked that I had shaved, which apparently you&#39;re not supposed to do, but it&#39;d been 2 weeks since I had so I guess the lasers working if it&#39;s still short enough that it seems so. She then explained about the process they do, perinatal, and the associated risks with it, including fistulas. We then briefly chatted about my letters and how I already had them finished and ready to go on file, a round of laser and electrolysis left, and how my schedule is open; possibly expediting my booking.
</p>
<p>
As of now, they&#39;re booking surgery about 18-24 months out, which OOF, but I suppose it&#39;s better than not ever doing it; but I was informed it&#39;s possible to get an earlier appointment since all my prerequisites were mostly finished. The girlfriend told me that typically they take about a week or so to call you to schedule out an appointment so now I play the waiting game.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to AMA, I&#39;m on the train back to where I&#39;m staying and quite bored.

I was 15 months consult to surgery. I had most of my hair removal done and all my letters on file before the day of the consult. But she’s even more popular now so maybe it’s now out to 18 months.

Thanks for this summary. I’m considering getting a consult there too. How long did the consult take? Did you have to pay out of pocket for the consult? And did you contact insurance to get approved (if you have it/are using it)? I’m really lost with what even the first step is. And if it’s just call to set up a consult and provide insurance, then I’ll be relieved.

It took maybe 5 minutes with the doctor and I. Which is... not disappointing. But maybe anti climactic?
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t pay anything there, but they&#39;ll probably be sending me a bill through the paitent portal they use.

Consult takes around an hour but most of that is waiting for nurses, fellows, and the 2 surgeons. Whether you pay for your consult out of pocket or through insurance depends on the insurance. Whether you need prior approval also depends on the specific insurance plan. If you do have to pay out of pocket, the consult is around $200. You won&#39;t get a surgery date though if your insurance isn&#39;t accepted (or you don&#39;t make it clear you&#39;re paying out of pocket). The surgery at NYU costs around 100k USD so most people pay via insurance.
</p>
<p>
If you think you want to go to Dr.s Bluebond Langner and Zhao, schedule a consult now. The wait time is long. It&#39;s pretty easy and their care team does a really nice job stream lining everything.

No.  My significant other is post op through BBL, so I asked her everything pretty much. She&#39;s an encyclopedia of knowledge about it.

Thanks for this. I have my consult scheduled in 3 weeks and Im just a combo of nervous/excited. Is there anything that you&#39;re glad you learned beforehand? And what were the answers to your two questions?

Oh so bellybutton piercings are fine, just remove the jewelry beforehand and you can snap it back in after, they try to work the scar with it.
</p>
<p>
Also the second one was about my pellet implant, it&#39;s A-okay, I&#39;ll probably get it a week or so before just to have time to recover, but going off hormones is outdated luckily.
