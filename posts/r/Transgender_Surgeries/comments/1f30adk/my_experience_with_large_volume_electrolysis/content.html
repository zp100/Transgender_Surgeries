I&#39;ll start by saying in spite of the fact I DO NOT recommend large volume electrolysis to anyone who doesn&#39;t strictly need it (i.e. you have hair that makes you a poor candidate for laser), I don&#39;t regret doing what I did. My results have been good, I have no scarring, and all of the aestheticians I saw were wonderful people looking to help trans women. That said, it is not a good use of your time or money. If you can do laser, you should do laser. The reduction laser gives you will be permanent, and you can skip doing laser maintenance appointments and just start doing electrolysis at that time. You will have a hairless face much faster and much cheaper than large volume electrolysis. Also note that while many specifics of my experience are particular to doing this procedure in Chicago with Cirine, I don&#39;t think any of the other places which offer sedation/large volume electrolysis do so in a way that would makeup for the numerous downsides.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
What Actually Happens the Day of and How to Prepare
</strong>
</p>
<p>
They do at least tell you this, but I will stress again the importance of eating a reasonable (but not too big) breakfast before your appointment. My second session I had only a bowl of oatmeal and found myself about to pass out as I sat up to drink gatorade a few hours in. I&#39;d say oatmeal + a yogurt was enough for me as someone who generally only eats a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast. Wear extremely comfortable pants that you&#39;re okay sweating in for 8 hours, and a shirt has a loose enough neck hole you can avoid touching your face with the fabric. Do not bother wearing anything nice.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re traveling in from out of town, it is vital you do so with a second person. You will not be able to take proper care of yourself, and especially after the first appointment you will likely be shocked at how much swelling there is. I might&#39;ve had it worse than most, but I was unable to open my jaw enough to eat proper food for 1-3 days after my appointments, so I lived on very calorie dense smoothies. Even if you don&#39;t have to travel from out of town, I would still recommend having a close friend or family member who can help you the day of the procedure and the day after (as the morning after the appointment will be the worst it gets, since the fluid will accumulate in your face as you sleep). I was in town so I can&#39;t give a good estimate as to when flying would be okay, but I would plan for 5 days after the appointment, especially the first one given how awful your swelling could be.
</p>
<p>
Odds are your appointment will start at 5am or around noon. I recommend having a pair of wireless earbuds (even if you&#39;re a boomer like me who prefers wired generally) and an external battery for your phone, as even though you&#39;ll be slipping in and out of consciousness at times it will make your time vastly less bad to have stuff to listen to for 8 hours (plus you should be SURE you have phone battery to call your ride).
</p>
<p>
After you&#39;re let into the room for the treatment, you&#39;ll change out of your shirt and into a gown, they&#39;ll put numbing cream on your face (frankly the smell of the alcohol might be the worst part of the procedure), the doctor or a nurse will come in to give you an IV to put you into a twilight state, then you&#39;ll get multiple injections of nerve blockers into your face (which hurt like a bitch, probably 6-7/10 on the pain scale).
</p>
<p>
What sadly none of the preparation emails tell you before hand is during the procedure your face will be mostly paralyzed after the nerve blockers are injected into your face. This means that even drinking water/gatorade will be a challenge since your lips won&#39;t close to create a seal, so I recommend bringing a tiny plastic cup from a cough syrup bottle, and drinking from that. My recommended technique is to pour the liquid into your mouth, then pinch your lips closed with your fingers so you can swallow. Because your face is numb you also won&#39;t know if you chew on your own cheeks/tongue, so I recommend only bringing yogurt or kefir for a snack. You WILL need a snack to keep your blood sugar high enough to avoid passing out in the middle of the procedure. Also MAKE SURE TO TAKE BREAKS. If you only take breaks when you have to pee, you WILL be at a higher risk of passing out. Pace yourself and make sure to regularly drink gatorade and kefir/yogurt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Aftermath
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Note that my experience was probably on the worse side of how these appointments can go, but there&#39;s really no way to know how you&#39;ll react beforehand. I followed every post op instruction to the letter and I still had a very rough go of it for my first 4-5 appointments. Also note that the appointments do get easier, you not only learn the ways your body will react, the affects are also just less intense the thinner your hair is and the less of it you have.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve touched on this a bit above, but honestly if you get it as badly as I did I really cannot prepare you for the swelling. The worst part is on top of how swollen you are, your skin will ooze a bit in areas where your hair growth was thicker. Neosporin and the lotion they recommend you will be your friend. After the first day or so Aquaphor won&#39;t cause whiteheads, so use that too. Your partner/family member/friend will hopefully be with you through all of this, as you might have an anxiety attack as you look in the mirror. If you work in person (and especially if you do any physically strenuous work), I would be prepared to take at least 3 days off (and frankly I would position those by a weekend so you have those 2 days to recover as well, giving you a 5 day buffer). I work remotely and I still needed to take 2 days off for the first 2 appointments, and I definitely was in no shape to go anywhere or do anything for 4-5 days afterwards. Most importantly you should make sure you can avoid direct sun, your skin will be extremely damaged and you have to be careful to treat it delicately until the irritation subsides. It will make a full recovery, but you have to treat it correctly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Cost
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is not a cheap way to get rid of your facial hair. I think all of my sessions cost me around $15k by the end of it, which was an expense I had budgeted for but frankly was not one I needed to. The 12 laser sessions you&#39;d need to get those results* would cost 10% of that. Were it more convenient or less painful than laser, I could possibly recommend it to anyone who was a candidate for laser, but it is emphatically neither of those things. If you have a lot of coarse blonde hair, this is probably the least bad way to get your facial hair removed though.
</p>
<p>
*Large volume will not finish you up, you&#39;ll have to do traditional electrolysis appointments every 6ish weeks for likely around 6-8 months afterwards. For laser you of course will only get permanent reduction, but the traditional electrolysis you&#39;d need after laser reduction is I would think at worst comparable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Final thoughts
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I would be remiss to leave out that the medical center in Chicago the procedure takes place in is mediocre at best. Despite scheduling your appointment months in advance, you will usually only learn what time to show up the day before, and over the course of my ~7 sessions I never once received my appointment time more than 48 hours in advance (once the time was changed on me the night before at 10pm - far too late when I was supposed to be there at 5am). This is NOT the fault of Cirine - the aestheticians are always prompt - it is the fault of the doctor. The doctor who actually administers the injections and applies the sedation (who I will not name because they Google themselves - you can easily search yourself to find out who I mean) is very unprofessional - before my first appointment I could hear them cursing out one of the nurses, and while I didn&#39;t experience any of the horror stories you read online having met him I fully believe that many of them are true. I would trust this doctor with injections and literally nothing else. The center is also not well staffed - after my first appointment I was left alone to wait for the woman who does the lymphatic drainage massage, and during that time I nearly passed out and found no one to help me. I thankfully was okay, but you should make sure you have a friend or family member present AT the center once it gets close to the end of your appointment, because there might not be anyone else there to help you should the worst happen.
</p>
<p>
Overall 6/10 experience, at least my facial hair&#39;s gone forever!

The problem with laser is thats it’s unreliable. Some people find it grows back to varying extents. Possibly all of it and a lot later as well. Yours is gone for good once you’ve gone through all the hair cycles.
</p>
<p>
Full clearing of dense hair with electrolysis can however lead to scarring, and these high volume places tend to encourage that due to the travel.

Yeah if you stop maintenance some hair absolutely grows back. That said based on everything I&#39;ve heard from aestheticians, women I know, my own experience, and research I&#39;ve done, the
<em>
reduction
</em>
laser offers is significant and permanent in the vast majority of cases (obviously some are unlucky - this is true of all medicine). That reduction is pretty reliably a substantial head start on electrolysis, and imo makes large volume electrolysis unnecessary for the vast majority of people who are candidates for laser.

The way I look at is, electrolysis is better, except it’s such a horrible and expensive thing. And the experience of electrolysis depends on who is doing it - you mention the pain from the injections, but it’s possible to do most of them virtually painless if the doctor bothers. Lots of other issues as well, but it’s not  like there’s a lot of choice if you want to do it this way.

I did a handful of sessions at this location and the write up is about on point. I did manage to do it alone and was able to survive by getting Gatorade and ensure delivered and packing ice packs.
</p>
<p>
A couple of notes: - I have red hair and it was realistically the only option. I had tried laser and 80 hours of electrolysis. That barely made a dent. It wasn’t until high volume did I make progress.  - They never were able to provide an appointment time. So obnoxious.  - The doctor who does the med is a creep. Can confirm. - One session had the power turned up too high and caused pitting. It’s fine a few years later, but didn’t love that. - I made it through by listening to audio books and disassociating during the procedure. - I went alone and recovered in my hotel room for about 36 hours afterwards each time. I would order Gatorade, ensure, water, and light snacks ahead of time. I packed ice packs. - the swelling, pain, and recovery was an absolute hell. You can do it, but it sucks.

For large volume yes, but for typical electrolysis, no most electrolysis places do not have anyone qualified to give injections and recommend OTC or prescription topical numbing

Just an FYI, but I mentioned potentially having to fly for LVE to my dermatologist (she cringed), and she mentioned that she would do injections on my face for local electrolysis. The problem is finding a local place willing to book you out for a half/full day, and has two electrologists willing to work concurrently.
</p>
<p>
Edit to add: Sorry, the point of the above is that might be an option for anyone with a local dermatologist and electrologist(s).

Thank you for the detailed writeup. I have a salt-and-pepper beard (thankfully it was mostly pepper) and have been doing research on LVE. I live on the East Coast and had planned on flying in/out to
<a href="https://electrolysis100permanent.com/electrolysis/long-treatment/" rel="nofollow">Electrolysis 100
</a>
in Chicago since they have gotten really good reviews. I heard horrible things about The Zukowski Center and felt like I heard some not-great things about Cirine. Well, I got to the end of your write up, and you echoed some of the things others have mentioned, and why they were not on my list:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
Yikes, I am sorry that happened...
</p>
<p>
Do you think your issues of pain, swelling, etc were no offense intended, but a &#34;you issue,&#34; in the sense that your body just had an especially adverse reaction? Or is what you experienced somewhat common, or maybe due to the specific injections (e.g. type, volume, number of, etc) used by Cirine? I had planned on flying in the morning and out in the evening since Chicago is a short/cheap flight, and that seemed to be what a lot of others had done.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again for the write up. There is just so little info on all the stuff we go through, so things like this become searchable and help a ton of other people.

I definitely had a worse reaction than average, but I would be surprised if the injections done at other LVE places are substantially different. I would go in assuming that you will have a slightly less bad version of what I did. I would absolutely not recommend flying in morning of and leaving that same day, definitely arrive the night before and plan to stay at least a few days.
</p>
<p>
Also I would say if you still have a lot of darker hair you should at least give laser a try before you fly across half the country.
</p>
<p>
While I&#39;d say my LVE experience was a mixed bag, I have no negative things to say about Cirine outside that. I continued to see an aesthetician from Cirine for traditional electrolysis after I finished up Large Volume, and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the way I was treated when I was doing traditional electrolysis.

Thanks for the response. I had to pause LHR over the winter due to an undiagnosed severe photosensitivity that popped up 18 months after starting the med. Photosensitivity and LHR is no joke.
</p>
<p>
My plan is to finish out LHR if my skin ever returns to &#34;normal,&#34; but a good 20% of my beard is white, so have considered LVE just to tear the tape off.
</p>
<p>
I would feel too uncomfortable using Cirine after your post since I would have a really hard time keeping my mouth shut if I heard anyone in a position of power cursing out an employee. I don&#39;t care if the person doing the yelling has an MD and I just flew to Chicago, I would still say something and walk out.

I’m currently about 30 hours into electrolysis (blonde facial hair).  I originally was doing 4 hours a month but now we’re at a point she can clear my face in 2 hours.  It sucks…but the only spot I ever got injections for was my philtrum (the dimple above your upper lip).  Everywhere else the pain has been annoying but manageable.
</p>
<p>
Even now the hair has thinned out to the point injections are no longer needed.  The philtrum is exceptionally sensitive but the pain is very short lived.
</p>
<p>
All this to say OP took a very aggressive approach which likely got the job done much faster than traditional route…but one needn’t think numbing the entire treatment area (outside of creams) is necessary. Most people will be able to tolerate the pain for an hour or two.

Yeah the only real advantage is the speed. I did about a year of LVE appointments (around 7 each around 2 months apart), and then 8 months of traditional electrolysis (averaging around 45 minutes every 6 weeks). I still have about 10 hairs I&#39;d like to get cleaned up at some point, but they&#39;re not a priority and aren&#39;t visible to anyone but me.

Not everyone with visibly dark hair above the skin is a good candidate for laser hair removal. The color that matters more is the root of the hair and there are some people who have hair with lighter colored roots yet the hair shaft grows out darker. Other things to consider are the type of machine and wavelength used, frequency of session, whether pre and post care are followed, and the experience of the operator. Laser can provide great results, but it’s not perfect for everyone. As someone else mentioned here, photosensitivity from medications can be a serious contraindication as well. Some medical conditions can also be contraindications.
</p>
<p>
Someone interested in hair removal should have a consultation with a professional because everyone is different and what works for one person may not be best for another.
</p>
<p>
Just my two cents.
