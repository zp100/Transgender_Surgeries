Would you mind naming your surgeon?

Dr. Deleon at the Crane center in Austin. And if anyone asks, yes I would recommend them.  They took my insurance, so I didn&#39;t have to pay much out of pocket. I haven&#39;t had any complications or anything either, everything is healing fine.

I&#39;d second the pain experience, though mine was scrotal not inguinal.  I never needed the narcotic pain reliever, extra strength tylenol was sufficient.  The first 48 hours or so was the most difficult, and there was enough discomfort it woke me up at night a couple times.  Otherwise, no big deal.  By a week or so I felt fine, apart from the usual pinchiness from the stitches.  I hate stitches.

And oh what a pleasure to have that sack empty... forever!  No T to worry about anymore.  So nice...

I had mine almost a year ago. Recovery was easy, just take it easy. I didnt need the pain meds they gave me, I just had a little achiness the second day, which was handled alternating tylenol/motrin.

Some of my pics are on here if you want to look.

I had mine 3 years ago and they removed my scrotum also. Even though I had 2 drains I had a lot of swelling. That led to my cords hurting me for about a week after they were cut. But after that my surgeon wanted me to walk every day and I was doing really good after the second week. I&#39;m so glad I had it done and want my penis removed this year
