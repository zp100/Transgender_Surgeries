I didn&#39;t go to McGinn, but I&#39;m about 3 months post op with Bluebond-Langner. It&#39;s my first week back at work and I&#39;m a little more tired, but not excessively so. I wouldn&#39;t want to start using T gel for the same reasons as you, but I have been back on progesterone since 2-3 weeks post op and haven&#39;t had any problems with it.
</p>
<p>
It shouldn&#39;t hurt to start progesterone again, just keep an eye on your emotions and stop taking it if you start having problems. Emotional issues relating to progesterone are super variable from person to person, and I don&#39;t think it makes sense for every patient to completely avoid it during recovery -- just be smart about it.

Yeah I believe I will add it back in to my HRT regimen tonight. I always took it in the evenings and today is the day I do my injection anyway so it&#39;s a good day to start back on it.

Thanks for the feedback. I&#39;m already over 8 weeks post op and when Biana offered it I turned her down. I healed really quickly. She even told me so at 9 days post op how quickly I was healing and then again at the 6-week follow-up she was in disbelief at how quickly I had healed. I always have been a fast healer. Obviously testosterone was not necessary for that to still be true. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll probably offer it again at my 6-month follow-up but I will turn them down again. Not worth it for me. And it&#39;s not like I&#39;m wiped out. I just noticed that by the end of the day I&#39;m pretty tired. But the upside of that is I sleep great every night. It&#39;s an adjustment. And to just put testosterone back in my system without giving my body a chance to adjust just seems like jumping the gun. And regardless, I
<em>
will
</em>
adjust. I&#39;m not putting that poison back in my system.

Its should be a low dosage, with the intent being to keep you in a normal female range of testosterone.
</p>
<p>
If, post surgery, you end up being in a normal range naturally (as opposed to being lower) then you don&#39;t need.
</p>
<p>
McGinn and my endocrinologist both, independently, said it may be necessary. After the blood test I had at around 4 months post-op, they both agreed that it was not needed and I never even received the prescription.
</p>
<p>
Testosterone isn&#39;t inherently evil (I think it&#39;s normal for people in our position to feel uncomfortable with the idea though), and they&#39;re not trying to rewinding your progress. That being said, you really may not need it and it&#39;s your decision in the end.

I was being a bit snarky but still, based on the conversation I had with her, and her having never seen my actual levels, it seems like it&#39;s not something I&#39;m going to need. I guess anti-androgens worked better for me than they work for most because my levels were already very low. And if that&#39;s the only reason they would recommend it - to counteract the low levels - then there&#39;s no need. My T has been low for years and my endocrinologist and I agreed they were perfect that way. And I still default back to, what is the average level for a cis woman? Because if my T is within that range then there&#39;s no reason for me to add to that

I haven&#39;t had surgery yet but I&#39;d like to go to McGinn. Do I really need to take MONTHS off of work? If so it&#39;s going to cost me my job.

You don&#39;t need to take months off. I took eight weeks off because short term disability covered it for me. You do need to take at least four weeks off however. She stated that she has military personnel back on the job after 4 weeks. I wouldn&#39;t wanted to be back on the job after 4 weeks, but apparently it is doable.

Thanks. I have an office job but I&#39;m the only one where I work who does what I do. They literally can&#39;t function without me and if I&#39;m gone someone needs to cover me. 4 weeks is about the limit I could reasonably take off.

Depending on where you live they might not have a choice.  Leave for transition related care is covered by my state&#39;s FMLA and if a business offers disability insurance, the law states they have to cover it.

Thanks. My job doesn&#39;t offer any disability insurance. I have a contract position with a very small employer. My contract specifically states that I can be terminated if I need more than  a month off. I&#39;d have to check with an employment lawyer to see what my options are.

It&#39;s about libido and energy. Not libido orgasms. But yeah, I think it&#39;s a bit ridiculous myself. It&#39;s like - hey congratulations, you successfully made it through a long arduous transition Journey. Now here, press rewind? Yeah, no thanks!
</p>
<p>
When I pressed her on it she said that after surgery your T levels are going to be low between 20 and 50 and that can cause low energy. Well cis women have t as low or lower and they seem to be just fine. Also, my levels already were low between 20 and 50 just on anti-androgens so, no thank you.

Different surgeons do things differently. Some do not ask you to stop HRT two weeks prior to surgery like Chettawut and Suporn, for example. I find it wise to follow whatever instructions your surgeon of choice gives you.
