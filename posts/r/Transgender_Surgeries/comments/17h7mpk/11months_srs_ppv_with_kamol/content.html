Are you also planning a revision surgery with colon for depth? Or just for aesthetics

I&#39;m so sorry you went with Kamol. I dodged that bullet myself after I heard horror stories about Kamol&#39;s surgeries.
</p>
<p>
I went with Theerapong. His aesthetics are great and I had the Colon done myself through laparoscopy. The recovery wasn&#39;t too bad either.
</p>
<p>
If you aren&#39;t going to have a vaginal canal, I wouldn&#39;t remove the PPV stuff, just leave it alone and just do labiaplasty and external stuff. Because to remove the PPV the doctor would have to cut you open for that and at that point getting a colon done would be easier to do at that time than going back if you ever changed your mind.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in need of a labia revision myself with Dr. Theerapong due to one of my labia disappearing during healing when the swelling went down and then a surgeon here in the states said he could fix that but then didn&#39;t do as promised. I just couldn&#39;t afford to fly back to Thailand to see Dr. Theerapong due to being on disability myself. So I am trying to save up to see him and hopefully he can fix what the doctor here in the states screwed up.
</p>
<p>
So I know your pain with doctors being crap. Trust in Dr. Theerapong, he did awesome work on me and if I had had the money to fly back to see him I would have.

Hello everyone. I am two years after and I wanted to ask because i am a bit lost: 1.Do you still wash the vagina from the inside with saline waters?
<br>
2.how do you wash the lips?  3.how many times and hours do you do the dilations?  4.do you have granulomas, what do you do?  5.how do you treat the bad smell? I really appreciate your response.
</p>

Had problems from Kamol also , going on over 4 years - had Theerapong do a Sigmoid - dilate once a week with the largest Soul Source dilator - I still has an aesthetic mess from Kamol and Theerapong basically did nothing aesthetically so I‚Äôm still seeking someone else being blacklisted from Theerapong - never got a one on one consult with Theerapong? Why ? I‚Äôll never know , just an exam the day before , no talking on anything about my needs/wants nothing - I needed a full vulvaplasty like done with a 1 st time SRS maybe 10 days later in reality Sooo ??
