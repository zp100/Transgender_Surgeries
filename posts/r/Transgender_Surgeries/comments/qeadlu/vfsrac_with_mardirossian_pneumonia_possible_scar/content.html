I had VFSRAC with Dr. Mardirossian last May and could not express how excited I was. The surgery turned out fine, but later that night, I started coughing. I. Could. Stop Coughing. Turns out, I came down with pneumonia. I was worried the stitches would break but the surgeon told me to forget about the surgery and just recover; of course, he also said he would still charge me to redo the stitches if they came undone because &#34;It&#39;s not his fault&#34;.
<br>
Anyway, somehow, the stitches survived and the excitement came back. I couldn&#39;t wait until I recovered.
</p>
<p>
He checked me 3 months ago and he said I looked fine but my vocal folds were really red. It&#39;s been 6 months and I still get so tired when talking (to the point it hurts), the raspiness is there and worsens periodically, and I don&#39;t have my volume and falsetto anymore. Now he is saying I might have scar tissue due to the coughing and might need to redo the surgery to remove it; again, he is still charging me but now with a partial discount.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good idea to have my vocal folds bared down more when it doesn&#39;t sound like he is sure of what the problem is or if that would help my voice. I&#39;ve been voice training and thought this specific surgery would be fine because it would help me voice train, but I still couldn&#39;t make any progress. I&#39;m so insecure about my voice and I really wish this didn&#39;t happen for what it cost.
</p>
<p>
Sorry if this was more of a rant, but does anybody have suggestions on what I should do?

I think I have? He would put a camera through my nose and he could see my folds. He said I looked fine when he did that.
</p>
<p>
That totally makes sense too about the folds not properly vibrating. Maybe I‚Äôll suggest that and see what he says
</p>
<p>
As far as the stitches, I just meant during recovery cause I got pneumonia during that important part of recovery so that‚Äôs why I was concerned about the stitches breaking before I healed

I know, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm really reluctant to have him ‚Äúfix it‚Äù, being he had nothing to say at the 3 month. Wow, that‚Äôs really good advice, I was wondering how to go about that! I‚Äôll get him to give me copies of my videos so I can have someone else have a look.
</p>
<p>
That really would be a coincidence since I was perfectly healthy before... I really want to confront him about it since I requested antibiotics to begin with. I‚Äôm going to bring that up about that possibility.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for taking the time to write to me, you helped a lot üòä I‚Äôll let you know how it goes!
