Hard swelling :( it’s painful to the touch some days. It’s definitely swelling because it grows bigger or smaller day to day. Smaller in the morning and swells up more by the evening.

Okey, I see why you are worried! No medical advice but maybe it would be good to check it with a knowledgeable doctor, they could probably check the inflammation values and maybe it can be good rule out that it&#39;s caused by bacteria. Since you say it&#39;s painfully, after such a long time, it&#39;s good to check. Pockets of bacteria that later cause very bad infections can happen after every surgery or wound healing and should be treated before it&#39;s causing a emergency situation.

As a massage therapist, this sounds like scarring or swollen lymph nodes (pronably both). Scar tissue can exist under the skin, and even if it&#39;s not visible it can block up your bloodflow, causing inflammation, waste buildup, and slowed healing. Lymphatic drainage massage can help clear out waste and reduce lymph nodes. It can be expensive, but maybe you can find sliding scale options in your queer community. Regular massage can break up tension and scarring, and improve circulation to assist healing. You should ideally get cleared by a doctor, but I&#39;m sure it depends on the therapist whether they&#39;d be willing to work on you at this stage.

By the way, what specific procedure did you have? I&#39;m trying to decide between burring and cutting.
