Hey everyone! It‚Äôs been a hectic bit of time but I‚Äôm doing alright now and this update will cover the day I got discharged and the day I was just hanging out at the Airbnb for the day before my follow up and my follow up I actually just got back from! If you haven‚Äôt caught up with the series so far

Discharge day:
</p>
<p>
The day I was discharged felt so exciting! I‚Äôm not the kind of girl to just be able to lay in bed all day ESPECIALLY FOR THREE DAYS, so this was the day I was looking forward to the whole time I was recovering! That morning the nurse I had told me to order some food to get something in my system because I would need it when I left for today. I DEFINITELY needed it. I hung out after eating until Dr. Ramineni came in to check on me one last time before I left the hospital and saw I was good to go and got my discharge papers done! I texted my sister and my Fianc√©e and told them I was ready to be picked up. Not too long after they came to pick me up and I got wheeled down to the entrance of the hospital. I had the donut set up in the front seat next to my sister who was driving and we headed back to the Airbnb. I got back and it felt so freeing to be out of that recovery room. I immediately wanted to shower because the ride home made me realize I hadn‚Äôt showered in three days and felt gross. So I got downstairs with the help of my sister and got situated in the shower and washed off. The catheter and packing made it a little rough to have my whole body under the water so luckily with the help of the detachable shower head that was installed in the shower I went around that area and once I got out and dried myself off I took care of down there with bath wipes I had swiped from the hospital. Doing this was a bit of a process especially with the packing causing the most annoying pain. Then came me using pads. I had to double layer them because of how much I would leak. It took a while to find the best position on the couch in the living room to not put too much weight on my coochie since the packing and catheter made it painful as hell. But once I got back into managing the pain the right way things got easier. I ate and mostly slept for the rest of the day.

<p>
The Day before the Followup:
</p>
<p>
This day was pretty much where I rested as much as I could at home. I stayed on top of checking on my coochie every few hours along with pain management. The most annoying thing I had to deal with that day was the damn catheter bag. But other than that it was mostly the day of rest before the follow up appointment.
</p>
<p>
The follow up appointment:
</p>
<p>
So this was a pretty quick but overall strange thing I had to do today. We all got up considerably early to get ready and I was so ready to get the packing and catheter the hell out of me that I was all packed and ready to go before everyone else! I took an oxycodon like Ramineni suggested I should an hour before the appointment and packed my dilators. We headed out and got there mostly with no issue. The building was pretty easy to navigate and getting up to Ramineni‚Äôs office was quick. I checked in and not even a couple of minutes later I was ushered to the room he was going to see me in and told to have a seat on this chair that looked like it held my legs open which was weird to see for the first time but was pretty affirming and made me realize those chairs would be a regular occurrence soon! I got settled into the chair and Ramineni as well as Katie came into the room and asked me how things were going. After he talked about the timeline of the follow up we got down to business. First was the catheter. I was terrified of the pain that would give me at first so I had my fianc√©e hold my hand when they got to that part but was pretty underwhelmed. He pulled it out and I just felt a little uncomfortable pull for what felt like a couple of seconds and then it was over. I just looked at everyone and went ‚Äúoh, okay.‚Äù Then he started taking out the packing. He snipped off the sutures for it and then prepared me for him taking out the packing. He snipped a few of the sutures an then told me to try to relax so my muscles didn‚Äôt clench onto the packing and cause more discomfort. So I laid there and just focused on gentle breathing. It felt so strange and felt like an eternity for him to take it out. There were some bloody spots along with this like mucous-ish substance that was coated throughout the entire length of the packing which grossed me out. It was such a weird feeling when it was coming out. Like the feeling of getting something from out of your teeth, the feeling of something foreign that shouldn‚Äôt be in a spot that you couldn‚Äôt really just GET out. Imagine that but it being almost close to your stomach.  That‚Äôs when I felt the relief of the packing being gone and OMG ü§§. But that‚Äôs when he went into the dilating part of the follow up and explained the parts of my new coochie and how to dilate properly. After that I was good to go! He gave me a few supplies to get started and me and my fianc√©e headed back out. I got settled back in the AirBnb we were at and I got into the position for laying out while also being able to dilate later. Which leads to now. I‚Äôve been just laying in bed and trying to take it easy since we got back. It was weird kind of exploring my coochie before with the packing in since it was also giving me pain. But now with it out I was able to really look at everything. I really feel like myself now physically than just the other aspects of me.
