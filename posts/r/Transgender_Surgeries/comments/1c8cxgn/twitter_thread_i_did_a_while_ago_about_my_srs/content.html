Did a little research. It appears to me that the original post you replieed to that led to this thread, the one that Ritchie Herron posted, was photoshopped.
</p>
<p>
I couldn&#39;t find the post here nor could I find any trace of the reddit user. And it was originally posted by reddit lies. An account spesifically made to fact check fake reddit stories. But transhpobes are too stupid to read apparently. Even in the comments of the page itself they are acting like it&#39;s real.

yeah it doesn&#39;t matter if the original post was real. the transphobic demand for trans horror stories exceeds the supply

Slight correction. Looking further, it seems that reddit lies is a troll account by someone who seems to be alt right. So they were reproducing it as a truthful horror story to appeal to transphobes yeah.

I&#39;m so happy that your complication resolved. For some trans girls I know SRS complications are endless.
