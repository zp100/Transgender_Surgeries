Hi all üòä
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m currently looking into getting my options of getting vaginoplasty through the use of the PPT method. Doing this I stumbled upon Dr. Phillip Houtmeyers in Belgium, however information on him with regards to srs seems to be rather limited, both on the Wiki and elsewhere on the internet, and I was wondering if any of you have any experiences with him or information on him with respect to srs?  ‚ù§Ô∏è

I met him and had been quite disappointed.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
He didn&#39;t seem very professional to me.
</li>
<li>
He showed me a very limited number of results and argued that the rest is on his computer at home...
</li>
<li>
The results were not very convincing.
</li>
<li>
Regarding his method, he actually does PI most of the time and PI-PPT very exceptionnaly (I am not even sure it is &#34;pull-through&#34; actually) and actually discourages from it because he believes it doesn&#39;t bring an added value to patients, (which, to be honest, is something some other surgeons say as well, and why they mostly do variations of PI rather than PPT).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As you stated yourself, there are very few feedbacks on him. I had managed to find only one of his former patients.

Sorry for the late reply, but thanks for telling your experience with him. It is a bit disappointing to hear, I will admit, but it is nice to get a little bit of information. I will also admit it kinda feels similar to the short interactions I have had with him over mail, where he kinda seemed to answer my questions with as few sentences as possible, and get it over with. Kinda hoped for it to just be how he interacts with people over mail, but sounds like it might carry over to in person as well üòï

I&#39;m having my first talk with him September the 9th. I know other trans people who got their vaginoplasty done by him and only found positive comments. The first warning that i got from them is that he&#39;s not social. You have to come prepared with every possible question you have. But I&#39;m confident in his skill. I know he used to work in uzgent. And he was also recommended by my endocrinologist.
