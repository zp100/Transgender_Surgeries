As title says, I‚Äôm considering PPT for deepening after initially having penile inversion/minimal depth.  I have about 2.5 to 3 inches of depth, and think maybe I‚Äôd like full depth now.
<br>
I‚Äôm wondering what the recovery is like, since PPT would be mostly just internal, and everything outside would remain the same and presumable that part wouldn‚Äôt hurt. If you‚Äôve had PPT for deepening after initial vaginiolasty, can you give me some ideas of what it is like, and if you‚Äôre happy you did? Thank you!

Sorry to hear you dont have depth im surprised honestly bc most surgeons always aim for 5-6in depth which is what cis women have. I have up to 8 if i really wonna go deep but it gets uncomfortable so i dont.  Dilating is the hard part honestly it can be so uncomfortable sometimes and letting a guy fuc just ugh anyways yes revisions i did one but jt was for my exterior my vagina was to fat lippy which is like guys like to but doing doggy was nearly impossible. Recovery time is nearly as long. Depth wish i think my friend had it and just was out for another 3months and back on dilating and doing it 2xs daily for at least a hour and going back between her small purple uo to the second to last dilator. We all loose depth Specially the more days u skip or half ass it its bound to happen my surgeon noticed immediately for me 5months in when i had gotten mine bc i was scared to go super deep

Oh, I probably should have mentioned in the initial post that I specifically chose minimal depth, and ended up with way more depth than I even expected... it‚Äôs just that when playing with myself, going deeper really seems like it might be fun/nice!  Thank you for your reply!

True, but my recovery and healing on the outside was easier I think.  I was back at normal things pretty darn quickly vs. having had to dilate this whole time.  I‚Äôve had little need to douche, and the only ‚Äúdilation‚Äù I do is playing with toys, but even that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúrequired.‚Äù  I am supposed to just use fingers for a minute or two a day is all.
