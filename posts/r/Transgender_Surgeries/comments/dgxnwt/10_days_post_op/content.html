I just had bottom surgery with satterwhite ten days ago. I got my packing off and it looks a bit messy, as expected, it does look like a vagina overall. I’ve started dilation which is a pain in the vagina lol. Overall I’m really happy with everything and I’m feeling like doing an ama.  Also for those that have been post op longer than me, any ideas for passing time while dilating? 😁

Read a book, watch some tv, play on your phone, stare at the ceiling fan, try to keep your cat off of you, etc.
</p>
<p>
Every Morning the first thing i do is make myself a cup of coffee, grab my dilators, and drink my coffee while doing it. Sometimes playing on my phone, sometimes just zoning out waiting for the coffee to kick in.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, once you are healed up more, dilation sessions kinda just turn into masturbation sessions as well. which passes the time really quickly, lol.

Yea I’m so inflamed right now I can only take the smallest one and have to use it to to upen things up enough to use the next one up which is supposed to be the smallest of 4. It’s a bit painful. Takes like 40-50 minutes to do it. They gave me some meds and told me it should be easier next week.
</p>
<p>
I’ll defiantly get a cat so I can keep the poor fucker off me. That actually sounds like a lot of fun. 😁

I’m sure the first three or four weeks will be the hardest. It all feels weird af for the moment. I’m hoping sensation won’t take that long to kick in.

It should reduce your pain level once you get it off. I slept better, longer, moved easier, and haven’t needed the opioid pain killers since. Do keep it dry. I had a couple I’ve packs leak and that was annoying. It will get better and you’ll enjoy getting it out. Fair warning thou getting it out is weird af. It doesn’t hurt but it’s weird and idk how to describe it, just relax, maybe take an anti anxiety pill, the more you relax the better but it’s sooooo weird lol. Sorry not trying to be weird but idk how else to say it.

That’s good to know. I keep getting all kinda weird tingles from my clit, nothing from my vagina thou. I’m not even two weeks out so I’m not getting my hopes up I’m just taking it day by day.
