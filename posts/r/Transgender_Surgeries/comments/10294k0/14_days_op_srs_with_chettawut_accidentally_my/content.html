Is it below your vaginal canal near your new labia folds? Without a photo it‚Äôs hard to say, however it sounds like would dehiscence and unfortunately happens to 60% of girls who have bottom surgery. Check my profile, my sutures happened to do this around week 3 and it was EXTREMELY uncomfortable and beyond scary but it gets better. DM if you want to talk through it more

This is very common, and two weeks in especially stitches are supposed to be starting to dissolve and come out. They are not permanent additions to your body. You absolutely don‚Äôt need to panic and run to the ER, unless you suddenly develop severe uncontrollable bleeding or signs of severe infection. Check with your surgeon of course but I am 99% sure you are fine.

Deppens. If it is just a small stich that poped, that will heal itself.  A lot of stiches? Go to the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Noone here will be able to goce you a GOOD answer without seeing it.
</p>
<p>
Edit: if you want an OPINION of someone who also had stitches comming loose. You can frel free to dm me too

Stitches breaking/loosening  and the wound opening is called &#34;wound dehicance,&#34; and it&#39;s super common. I had a pretty major instance of that happening my first surgery, and again very recently in 3 places. They do close and heal on their own, typically.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;re scary, common, and typically up to the surgeon to determine severity. Document with photos, and send them to your surgeon if possible. Enlist help if you&#39;re comfortable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The surgeon will be able to tell you what best to do.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s what mine told me, and what I did on top of that. My surgeon suggested I use saline solution to soak a gauze strip, put it on the wound, and place a dry bandage on it. I did this two or three times a day for my more minor wounds.
</p>
<p>
My wound seperation was thankfully not very extreme on my second stage of the surgery and I was able to assist closure with butterfly bandages. Like a nice middle ground between doing nothing and restitching. The wet to dry treatment meant I went through a lot of those though, as the adhesive isn&#39;t very strong. So if you decide to go that way, buy two or three boxes maybe.
</p>
<p>
I took it easy. No leg lifts or climbing into tall cars that might aggravate the area. It closed eventually. But not before giving me severe anxiety about the wounds opening more and being generally terrifying.
