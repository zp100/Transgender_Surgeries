My wife and chiming in through me.
</p>
<p>
My wife went to a bunch of consults when she was at 1 year on HRT. She settled on Dr. Ley in Scottsdale Arizona. Great price, and she does stunning bone work. We had already had Dr. Ley do my meta for me (FTM), and Dr. Ley is an out transgender woman, and really understands the concerns and fears around FFS. Dr. Ley charges for time on the table, not individual procedures, and it included a two night stay in a hospital. Our initial quote was about $35K,
</p>
<p>
My wife had her hairline moved forward about a 1/2 inch, her brow ridge reworked (that included reworking her orbital eye sockets which really opened up her eyes), her chin reduced, and cheek implants.
</p>
<p>
My wife is super happy with all of it. Like you, she wasn&#39;t sure about the cheek implants, but they made a huge difference for my wife after all. She&#39;s had to wait to get a lip lift because so much was done at once. Also, I didn&#39;t think the hair line being moved would make a bid deal, but she can pull her hair back, no scarring you can see, and it made a big difference.
</p>
<p>
My wife&#39;s only complication was that they left some non-dissolving stitches in, that I pulled when we got back home. There were quite a few that come with the hairline being moved forward.
</p>
<p>
My only real complaint was that Dr. Ley was really unrealistic about ongoing electrolysis post surgery. Dr. Ley had a patient that had complications with her cheek implants that had to be removed, and there was a legal threat. Therefore Dr. Ley has recommended no electrolysis without antibiotics after cheek implants ever again, and not for 6 months post surgery. This isn&#39;t really standard advice, and contradicts all the other surgeons we had seen. I think it&#39;s a CYA, from an old nurse&#39;s perspective. My wife&#39;s current surgeon said wait 6-8 weeks, and you are fine.
</p>
<p>
My wife was worried about skin with her chin reduction. She&#39;d also lost over 100lbs, and that translates to loose skin. She&#39;s going in for an extended facelift and upper lip lift in a couple of weeks. She had great chin reduction, but it&#39;s not entirely visible due to her skin. Dr. Mangubat near Seattle is doing it for her because it&#39;s closer to home, and expects to see a great result in feminizing her face. That&#39;s going to run about $15K out of pocket.
</p>
<p>
We were not able to get insurance to pay for FFS. We can get electrolysis, BA&#39;s and GCS covered without any issues at Kaiser WA, but FFS is still a ways out for coverage. We got a Care Credit cared through Dr. Ley&#39;s. That took care of about half of it, and VISA paid the rest.
</p>
<p>
The biggest surprise was that it really does take 6-12 months to see how it all shakes out. I saw her have good results immediately, but it really fell into place as the months went on. She takes and uploads daily selfies to FB, and I am shocked when I go back and look at what I thought were the finished results, only to see what she looks like now that everything is healed.
</p>
<p>
My wife is 48, and that surgery took more out of her than it would have for a younger patient. Being patient with the healing process, and putting enough time aside made a difference. She was out of work for 6 weeks. She could have pushed it and gone back sooner, but it would have been exhausting.
</p>
<p>
I have my wife here over my shoulder, and she said to use this picture:

Wow, thank you so much for your thoughtful response! You’re quite beautiful and I can see why you appreciate Dr. Ley’s work.

Hi All,
</p>
<p>
I hope this isn’t too much of an imposition, I’m just still feeling overwhelmed.  I’m a late-transitioning gal who dreams of becoming the best version of myself, and after much reading, I’d still appreciate FFS surgery guidance from sisters who’ve been through it and are similar to me in:
</p>
<p>
Facial structure (see attached photos) Age: 50 (ideally, but less of a priority)
</p>
<p>
I’d welcome: What what procedures you were recommended/sought/actually had done. Surgeons you considered, selected and the reasons Any complications / surprises you didn’t expect Before/after pics you’re comfortable sharing  Insurance lessons / considerations
</p>
<p>
My current background/stats: 165lbs, 5’9” HRT a bit over 1 year About 6 treatments of LHR to face, more scheduled Ordered/awaiting virtual FFS Have interviewed with: Facial Team Spiegel Keojampa
</p>
<p>
More of my background, if it helps: Generally, FT seems more conservative and Keojampa (by his own admission) is more aggressive, especially with the jaw. I’m considering brow, nose, upper lip and jaw. I’ve had surgeons be both for and against jaw work, though I’ve always considered it one of my biggest causes for insecurity/dysphoria. None has recommended tracheal shave, and I tend to agree. I hadn’t considered, but have had 2 of 3 surgeons recommend cheek implants. I’m still very open to interviewing other surgeons and am wondering about Deschamps-Braly, still.  I generally felt more comfortable with FT and Keojampa, but mostly because Spiegel’s coordinator has just been too pushy. I fear loose skin with an aggressive jaw procedure and prioritize health, natural-looking passability and then (ideally) attractiveness in that order. While I’m eager to leverage coverage from Anthem BCBS and have had some luck (after excruciating, drawn-out interactions), I’m also willing to pay a premium for best care / results.
</p>
<p>
This sub has been a generous pool of support in the past and I want to thank you for reading this and helping with any lessons you care to share!

I went to dr. Harrison Lee in Beverly Hills last October. I was 50 and had everything done.  Have a look at my transition timeline post.  I’m super happy with results.  Happy to answer any questions.

Which procedures did you get? Were there any he performed that you weren&#39;t expecting to need?
</p>
<p>
What was the cost? I&#39;m hoping to get a consult soon but want to be prepared.

You should also consult with Bryan Rolfes. Check him out online and on realself plus on Youtube. There&#39;s Harrison Lee also.

Thank you, Federal Tension. I read a bit about your difficulties right after surgery and sincerely hope things have improved for you. Big hugs your way.

Thanks I&#39;m happy to help especially after what happened to me. One thing that I&#39;d say is some doctors see us as bags of money only and guinea pigs. So ruling out Spiegel was a good move and a blessing as he seems greedy, money hungry and arrogant. Also don&#39;t go cheap. Expensive does not always mean great sure but usually safe is almost certainly guaranteed. Money you can make but your face you cannot. It may be worth consulting with Paul Nasif from botched who specialises in noses. Have the best touch you if you can afford it or save up.
</p>
<p>
Deschamps Braly, I&#39;m not sure how good he is  with noses as there&#39;s one girl here who wants a small cosmetic revision. FT is a good choice if you want it abroad but are obviously not the best as some also suffered nerve damage or botched faces due to carelessness as one redditor said but they are few and far between. Bart on the other hand, consistently has botched cases and perpetually numb patients even the happy ones or some odd issues. Personally, I&#39;d suggest having it done in the US. No language barriers, familiar boards for checking surgeon&#39;s credentials, better training, surgeries done in hospitals not clinics and you have more legal rights as a patient when medical negligence occurs. I really think that Bryan Rolfes, Harrison Lee and Deschamps are the ones with consistently good results, high satisfaction rate but varying taste in aesthetic. So you go with one you share/agree on what looks good, feel safe and genuinely wants you to be happy.

Leave the jaw. You don&#39;t have prominent jaw angles it&#39;s already quite round but the chin may benefit from some shaving a bit. Brow lift, nose, forehead and cheeks could be your main areas for FFS. I&#39;d probably have nose done with a surgeon specialising in nose and FT isn&#39;t good with noses I heard. Some lip fillers may be good too if you want.
