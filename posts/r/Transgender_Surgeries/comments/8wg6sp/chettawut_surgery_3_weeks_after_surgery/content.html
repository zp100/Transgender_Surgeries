Heya, i wanted to help people with my knowledge of the procedure of the chettawut clinic and my own opinion with some pictures.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask any questions.
</p>
<p>
I am already at dilator Number 2  (0, 1, 2) and I dont feel a lot of pain anymore. It is more of a uncomfortable feeling which is less than pain, and some pain which can both be blocked by paracetamol or arcoxia.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion Dr. Chettawut did a phenomenal job, because in germany doctors would have given me only an &#34;asthetic&#34; surgery, because of the lack of penile skin. He was able to reach 7 inches, and did a very good job at the asthetics, I really feel attached to my genital now, and feel kinda connected to the view of it. Since the first days it is very sensitive and caused some pain, e.g. sanitary pads were too much sensation which cause some pain in the first days using them. I have always felt very comfortable with the after care which the clinic provides. The Hotel is also providing a lot of help in the first few weeks, and i really like the cleaning ladies which clean the cottages at the Bangkok Rama hotel. They helped us to get back to bed after each cleaning session, and even gave me my plushie and covered me with my blanket. Here are some pictures of the result over the first 3 weeks

</a>
</p>
<p>
If there is any interest, i might start to write a journal kind of thing
</p>
<p>
*edit: I had my follow up today, the skingraft is totally fine, but they had to crauterize some granulation tissue at the bottom side of the entrance. Now both, me and my wife need to slow down dilation and stop Dilator No.2 for two weeks, so we are back to No. 0 for 10 minutes and No.1 for 40 minutes, and should slow down while entering the other two, no more instant inserts D: . He also recommended to keep the No. 0 dilator in the schedule for half a year ;~; .

There&#39;s always interest. Women will be reading it for years to come.

Wow!... I want more details so I can match it up with my experience by the day. Your results are phenomenal.

<p>
Mine...not so much as you can see here:

Well, I&#39;m of two minds about it. If I was really dead set on making her out to be a butcher or something I could easily spin a convincing tale, but I don&#39;t really think that&#39;s true. I was about patient number 10ish (March, 2017). It could have been lower, but I&#39;m friends with her other early patients and they had various complications too. Some worse than others. I&#39;ve actually talked to half a dozen of her earlier patients (MTF Bottom) although there&#39;s probably a poster on her office wall telling people not to talk to me by now.
</p>
<p>
I just let the story tell it&#39;self, there&#39;s no need to embellish.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think her trajectory is improving in both the pre and post-surgery information she&#39;s providing and the fact that she&#39;s operating out of one hospital helps simplify things. I think this bodes well for future patients. Good results come with experience and doing MTF bottom surgeries frequently. Which brings me to the real question you should ask yourselves. How many surgeries do you think a MTF Bottom surgeon should have under their belt to demonstrate they produce good reliable outcomes?
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s a question I did not take seriously enough and I paid a price my pictures cannot even begin to explain. It&#39;s also why I won&#39;t recommend her, at least not now. I foolishly chose staying local over traveling to a surgeon who was more established. There were other issues at play too. There&#39;s no need to go into all of them other to say, the entire experience was a net loss and remains so in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve read other surgeons answering this question about complicated surgical procedures, and GA bottom surgeries are in that category. The numbers that get tossed around are usually into the 100&#39;s, even as high as 200-300. Needless-to-say, that&#39;s way above 10.
</p>
<p>
If your friends are considering her that&#39;s great, we need more choices and experienced surgeons. Period. It&#39;s a tough spot to be for both sides. I found that out the hard way that being an early adopter, in this case, was the wrong way to go.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to reach out publicly or PM, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m not out to burn down her practice, but I&#39;m not going to sugarcoat my experience on her behalf either.

I think its between the Day 20-25. I am not really sure, I need to take my time at home to look at all the pictures I have taken. I have seen your stories and we both feel so sorry about your case, maybe you could sue her? I wanted to start a offline journal after surgery, but I was too tired to make one, I will take some of the notes of my wife to complete and start my journal/experiences.

The operation with skingraft was around 11.000~ Euro for each of us. Additional costs are the Hotel, dilation stuff (sanitary pads, bed sheets, lube, docadine, baby wipes, and antibacterial soap), the flight from and to home, food for the entire stay, and additional stuff you might need like a plushie or something like that. The following is needed to get the operation, but you can schedule the operation before giving them all the lab results and srs letters: 1. CBC (red blood cell &amp; white blood cell and platelet count) 2. Anti HIV 3. Cr (Creatinine) 4. PT and PTT (We require both results of PT and PTT) 5. FBS (fasting blood sugar) 6. Chest x-ray (Digital x-ray file) 7.2 SRS Letter, one from a licensed psychatrist and one of a therapist. (In my case I had a therapist/psychatrist/urologist, and a well known therapist in germany) They will verify the existence of the therapists, and may contact them (they contaced my psychatrist/main therapist, but a wikipedia site and his own website were enough for the 2. therapist)
</p>
<p>
We did book our Surgeries in November &#39;17 and got them at the 8. and 9. June 2018. We planned around 15.000 euro per person for the trip, to have some buffer if something goes wrong and additional medical stuff would be needed.

*edit: We had 3 years of hormone treatment at full time as woman before the operation. But I think you need half a hear on HRT and some time as a woman only.

I had time to look into my documents, it costs as follow: SRS 356.000 Thai Baht Skingraft 32.000 Thai Baht Trachea Shave if wanted 62.000 Thai Baht (my wife wanted it, i didnt need it) Its pretty cheap for a very good result and the aftercare (daily visits of the nurse except sunday) in the hotel. We preferred chettawut mostly because of an expected okayish result, and a very good aftercare (where would i get someone to look on my clit and vag on a daily base to check if everything heals fine, buys me meds, and takes care of stuff I might need for 30 days after srs)

He jumped on Number 1 on our list after suporn retired. We decided chettawut might be as good as a team of newly trained surgeons, he has around 3000 operations since 1995, and we had enough (because he is cheaper) money to go 42 days to thailand to have a good recovery before flying back in an economy flight (12 hours flight time, 2 hours airport time at dubai).

The 7inches of mine and in case of my wife 6 inches are totally fine too. We are atm at Dilator Number 2 (26mm) and I dont think we will have a lot of problems to reach 32mm within the 12 weeks after srs. Technically we could get bigger dilators after reaching 32 mm, but I dont think I will need it in our relationship, so I am fine with 32mm and 7 inches depth.

Go to the atm and get enough cash for two weeks in thai baht. Nothing says friendship more than a non-englishspeaking thai guy at the front door of your cottage, while you are dilating, because a chetgirl ordered mcdonalds, having no money, and send him over to your place. (She didnt tell us about her plan, so we were kinda confused and worried because we couldnt do much, she thought we might pay him and would know that she ordered something. 2. Get a thai number at 7/11, you will need it to order at 90% of the food delivery stuff at food panda or even mc donalds. They will alway call you before delivery and want to make sure that you ordered and really want the food...

In my opinion it is okayish. The pain can easily handled by Tramadol, Paracetamol and Arcoxia. You need to be careful while dilating tho, and shouldnt do too much because the stiches might crack up open. Too much pressure because of pain medication can damage the result inside. If you intend to go to chettawut, visit Cottage 4074, maybe there will still be the Chettgirl microwave with our names on it. xD

The nurse will assist you in dilating for the first few times. I Had problems AFTER their offical helping time changed, but she helped me anyway. I was very happy about this, and it helped me to relax. (They will only be able to help you if you are dilating when they are at your place. But they also need you to lay there to apply betadine, they cant if you dilate at this time) They come around 9:30-15:00, depends which hotel gets visited first, and if its sunday.

Do you think we could pay extra for them to come again just for dilating? I wouldn&#39;t want to risk anything.

Ive never heard of anyone doing that, so it&#39;s probably not necessary. There are people you can hire to help you through it in thailand, and I&#39;d guess elsewhere. I&#39;ve never seen a post by anyone who has used these services, but they do exist.

Well, I dont think they gonna do that even if you want to pay extra. Trust me, you wont need them after the first few days, they will look at your vag on a daily base and you can tell them if something hurts. As long as you dont take more medication thatn you should, you would feel pain when hurting yourself with dilating. Dilation isnt really hard, just a bit annoying. (Dilator No. 0 is still harder to get in than No. 1+ 2 .

How hard is it to move around at this point? In my mind, the recovery seems like it would be similar to that after a difficult childbirth...

We are capable of going to 7/11 (around 200 meter away from the hotel), we can go to the breakfast at morning, walk around a bit between the cottages to visit our new found friends, but it can be really exhausting. Dont expect to be able to work after the flight home, and dont overextend your capacities. You are supposed to not lift more than 2,5kg/5 punds in the first 3 months. If you walk to much, or lift to heavy, stiches might break and bleeding occurs, there might be more things happening, but I dont know of them.

Thank you, that clarifies a lot! Sounds like one really wants to make sure to have other people around during those first few months if nothing else then e.g. to carry groceries and things. Need to find a way to plan around that... How tiring is it generally? Are you fine reading stuff, or communicating, or are energy levels still low?

Well I am here right now. I think a lot of energy is lost because of being without the hrt atm. But we sleep generally a lot more then expected. My wife wont go fully back to work after one month of healing after surgery. We intend to get amazon prime fresh for groceries and stuff. So no one needs to help us when we are back home.

I am curious, why did you decide for yourself to take the minimal depth version? I am in a girl/girl relationship, but still kinda interested in having the &#34;full&#34; experience and I want to have the possibility for sexual intercourse in any way.

Yeah I guess that’s not as important for me. Penetration isn’t really my thing, I’m more topical with my body. Healing is quicker, and I’m not into the dilation process. Also not really my thing. Plus the doctor says he can get 1.5 to two inches depth and honestly that’s great for me. Sex is a full experience anyway you do it, so it doesn’t really matter to me.. but quicker healing, minimal invasion, and no dilation are the main reasons

Looks great! I&#39;m going for surgery with Dr Chettawut in a few months myself 😊
</p>
<p>
My main question is a bit of a different one: how do you feel now? Emotionally and mentally more than anything. Is it a relief? What was your reaction when you saw it for the first time?
</p>
<p>
I ask because I&#39;ve read hundreds of stories about the physical side of things but less about how you actually feel afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, any little tips for getting through the stay in Thailand? How much were you able to leave your hotel room and do things?

Well, i felt happy before the operation, lived my life, and kind of adapted to live with this thing. I did not like to swim, because i didnt feel comfortable, but swam anyway with friends because i love to swim. Emotionally I am still feeling the problems of not having the HRT since 2 Months. Mentally it is a good feeling, I feel attached to my vag, I like it and it feels like it is my one. I was overwhelmed with happiness after the unpacking, because i couldnt believe that he made such a good job. I expected a 3/10 vagina with at least the depth and normal feelings/at least some feelings. I wanted to be realistic before undergoing surggery, and many things can go wrong. At the moment I am able to have kinda good feelings down there when touching my gf, I think I feel less hindered by my body now. Soft touching is also already possible which helps to relax a lot for me. Of course i would never try to get an orgasm at the moment, because it needs to heal first. I realized after the unpacking and removal of katheter how much this genital still made my in a lot of things kinda uncomfortable without me noticing it. It was just there, so i didnt really think of it much. Now I feel much more happy in most scenarios of undressing, showering, and all the stuff.
</p>
<p>
Get some trans friends in the other cottages, if you choose rama hotel. Dont expect an ant free cotage, we were able to leave after katheter removal, but going 200 m to seven eleven is kinda hard and very exhausting we needed a break when walking back. Steps are horrible to take, and you might hate every hole in the walkways. Dont overestimate your energy, I wanted to do most things like emptying of the catheter of my wife, because she had a little bleeding after the clinic. In the end i had a bigger bleeding because i tried to comfort her in any way, I might have had no bleeding if i stayed away from doing too much stuff for her. (Well, it was still the correct thing for my feelings, couldnt be comfortable lying next to her while she bled a bit. :x )

Since the operation I was only in a car once. The nurse brought me to hotel by car after leaving the clinic. The biggest walking was to a supermarket 200 meter away from the hotel. We did it after catheter removal and we were pretty exhausted by this. Short Timeline of the surgery at Chettawut clinic: Day 0: Operation Day Day 1-3 Laying in Hospital Day 4-7 removal of the package Day 8-12 you are not supposed to leave yet, catheter removal on Day 12 Day 13+ you might be able to leave the room for getting breakfast at the hotel restaurant ~3weeks we visited the supermarket several times, but we are unable to climb stairs and the dilation takes a lot of time and is pretty exhausting.
</p>
<p>
I dont think you will be able to perform big travels arround the area in your time frame.

Congratulations! Is it true that you do not need electrolysis/laser with Dr Chettawut? The main thing keeping me right now from surgery is the time it will take to remove all the hair down there.

We didnt do hair removal and he doesnt recommend doing it before surgery because it could create scar tissure which in the end can cause problems while dilating/surgery. Atm there are some hair at the entrance, but I am totally fine with that. After recovery I will get rid of them at the entrance, inside he tries to get rid of most of them, but I think its likely to have some inside because of some hairs suriving the procedure.

Thanks for the quick response! Is hair inside going to be a hygiene issue down the road? Sorry if I&#39;m getting too personal, but I&#39;ve been thinking of going the same route for a while now.

I think it wont be a big issue, it may cause some problems in a few years, who knows. In my opinion it wont be a hygenic issue, and the hairs at the entrance dont interfere with my dilation. Tomorow this the follow up date at the clinic for me and my wife. We might ask him about it.

Totally forgot to ask the inside hair question. We asked him only when we can do hair removal and he told us to wait at least a year.

I&#39;ve head that internal hair can cause infections, but I suspect that&#39;s rare even when there is hair.

Yup, Its my pikachu, which my wife gave me before surgery. I was driving to the clinic by their driving service, and he wanted to carry everything... Because of this, pikachu got lost in the car. I was very stressed at this point, i am officially diagnosed autistic, and the nurse calmed me down by telling me she will look for pickachu to get it back after surgery. Half an hour later and two nurses searching through the clinic, they gave me back my pikachu before surgery, I think they had to call the driver to come back. This really helped me to trust them in any way. Chettawut even hugged be before surgery which kinda confused me. Having someone to hug is very important in a drugged state in the clinic.

Good taste in Pokemon. I brought Pikachu and Snorlax with me to Thailand and they both accompanied me throughout all the bed rest as well.

Grats :)

Looks very pretty and normal. Yours is probably the nicest Chettawut results I&#39;ve ever seen! (I&#39;ve seen at least 2 dozen including mine)
