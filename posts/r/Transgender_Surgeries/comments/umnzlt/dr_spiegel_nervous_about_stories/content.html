Hello all,
</p>
<p>
I recently was recommended Dr Spiegel through the NYU center. I didn&#39;t do any research yet and decided to contact them, I got a call from the scheduler and he gave me a whole spiel &#34;Dr Spiegel is the best in the world, he invented two techniques and has them patented and has worked on people like GG Gorgeous&#34; I was like ok? I didn&#39;t hear about GG and he was surprised heh. Anyways, kinda a weird thing to get into with with the scheduler but I didn&#39;t think about it too much. So he scheduled me for a consult on Monday, 500$ just for a consult, thats crazy!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
So I started doing some research on Dr. Spiegel, and found out he lets his students work on his patients without their consent, and doesn&#39;t do any imaging and has varying success rate.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
So this made me very nervous, unfortunately this is one of the only places somewhat near me, I live in upstate NY. And there is a potential that they have someone in house who can appeal my insurance to cover this.
</p>
<p>
Should I spend the 500$?? Or should I try to find someone else?
</p>

I&#39;ve posted this before, but when I asked my Endo and Primary Care Doctors for their input on FFS surgeons, both said, &#34;stay away from Spiegel!&#34;
</p>
<p>
Their largest reasons were &#34;he&#39;s an asshole with a massive ego.&#34;

To be fair, almost all surgeons are &#34;assholes with massive egos&#34;.  lol
</p>
<p>
It takes a special kind of personality to willingly endure the rigors, sleeplessness, and emotional abuse of surgical medical training.  I have a friend who is one of the very rare &#39;nice&#39; surgeons (although he isn&#39;t that nice compared to genuinely nice people), and even
<em>
he
</em>
says that most of his colleagues are totally self centered assholes!

I don&#39;t know too much about him, but what I&#39;ve heard is similar to you - he might be a pretty skilled surgeon but that does not mean he is very professional or has good bedside manner. I think you are correct that gigi went to him and I believe a few other well known trans people have as well, but keep in mind that he may have been aware that they were public figures and that would influence how good of a job he does.

Yeah idk I would be inclined to avoid him, especially since there are so many other extremely talented sugeons with similar (or lower) price points.

I had a consult with him and it was fine. I think it was useful to consult with multiple surgeons. I asked him directly if he does the surgery himself and he said yes- so either he is blatantly lying or isn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t get the feeling he was lying, but who knows. It&#39;s very likely he has a resident or someone similar working with him, learning, because he is probably getting up there in age at this point. From everything I can tell he has gotten some great results.
</p>
<p>
The reason I personally decided against him was that he was charging 10K more for the same work as anyone else on the east coast. And I felt like he had more of the &#34;I am a master of making beautiful women&#34; type of old school, egotistical attitude that I don&#39;t care for, but that&#39;s just my personal feeling.

Hmmm. That price is steep. It seems like the consult prices are getting higher and higher these days.
</p>
<p>
IMHO, It’s almost like they want you to invest a high amount for the consult so you’re more likely to stick with their practice and not go elsewhere because you spent $500 already that will go toward your surgery. If you make consults with 2 other surgeons then you’ve easily spent $1000 of your money.
</p>
<p>
However that’s just my own thoughts on marketing and sales.
</p>
<p>
Is it an in person consult where he will take X- rays or facial measurements? Three years ago I flew out to see Deschamps for a $300 consult and he took 2 x-rays (I got to take home) and lots of measurements on my face.

GG Gorgeous transitioned about 10 years ago. At the time, she was basically the first person ever to be so public and open about her transition on YouTube. Seemed like everyone had heard of her. YouTube film studios even made a documentary about her. But I guess people have forgotten or are too young to remember now. :) Times change I suppose.

I regret spending the $495 on a consult with him.  His website proclaimed they work with insurance but at the end of the consult he was well no. We accept insurance from one provider. The rest don’t want to pay our fees (~$92k for FFS). He also has a very restrictive media policy about who you can talk to about your surgery post operative.  He does not do any kind of imaging and says it is completely unnecessary.

I actually had extensive FFS done by Dr. Spiegel almost four years ago.  I found him to be a highly skilled, competent, and empathetic surgeon.  He is associated with the Boston Medical Center and, as is true at all academic hospitals, had a Chief Resident work with him during my surgery.  My daughter is a surgeon at Mayo, and they do the same thing (meaning work with Residents).  I did not object to that arrangement as it is so common at the really great teaching hospitals.  Every surgeon mentioned was at one time a Resident at a hospital somewhere - otherwise, they would not be qualified to be a surgeon.  For me and for my goals, I was (and am) very pleased with the results that Dr. Spiegel achieved for me.  All of my bits have full function, full sensation, and I personally think are much better than prior to the surgery.  Obviously I cannot speak to anyone else’s experience, but I am thankful that Dr. Spiegel was my surgeon.

I had a consult with him and chose to proceed, but I haven’t gone in yet. I’ve seen work he’s done on people I know and acquaintances that I would be very satisfied with. When we met he wasn’t unfriendly. I agreed with everything that we discussed and felt encouraged by some of his input.

I guess time will tell.

Thank you all for your feedback, the general consensus seems to be he isn&#39;t great overall, I will look elsewhere, especially cause it looks like he won&#39;t take the insurance anyways. Appreciate ya&#39;ll!

Don’t go there he is very rude and only cares about the money. I’ve read several times also that he lets his students do most of the work without patient consent. When I had a consult with him he was making fun of my name change to his intern as he was walking out….. also feel like his results are subpar compared to other surgeons around yet his pricing is like really high. My consult fee was only $200 but it was years ago so he must have increased it based on what other commenters are saying.

I don&#39;t really get the &#34;he lets students work on patients&#34; thing.  I mean, he&#39;s going to have residents or fellows or whatever, that&#39;s how they train the next generation of surgeons.  How do you think people learn to do these operations?  I asked him about it when I did a consult and his line was basically, &#34;Of course I have people helping me but all of the important and aesthetic stuff is done by me.&#34;

<p>
It’s said to be the reason for his apparent high complication rates/poor results.

<p>
No one has an obligation to be the training subject for new surgeons. But good for you if you’re willing to take that risk, you’re helping others.
</p>
<p>
The main problem with this is he doesn’t disclose it properly and most women go into it assuming he’s the surgeon like he was in the past when he built his reputation.

Students… absolutely not. FFS is a very complex surgery and should only be performed by skilled plastic surgeon that have years of prior cranial plastic surgery procedures. NO MED STUDENT SHOULD BE IN AN OR DOING FFS work! That is absurd. Not only are some paying $15-30k for work, this is the rest of their life we are talking about. Some adolescent surgeon just entering the field needs to be in an er practicing on simple cases. Period.

They won’t be actual med students, but surgeons wanting some specialised training. I would expect he charges a lot of money for this. Dr Keojampa for example trained with Spiegal, and I doubt these surgeons are paying to stand around watching.
</p>
<p>
So nice, business, getting paid twice. The problem is it’s not disclosed to patients.

I went to him. I don&#39;t feel my results are terrible. I had to have a rhinoplasty revision with him which is still healing so I can&#39;t judge it yet. I don&#39;t really trust him and would avoid him if possible
