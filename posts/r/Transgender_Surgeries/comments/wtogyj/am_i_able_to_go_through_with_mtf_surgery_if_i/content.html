So I just saw a walk through of how mtf surgeries usually go and i saw that the foreskin was pulled back from the head of the penis. But I have phimosis (which basically means that can&#39;t happen), so do I need to fix that first before the surgery, or will it even matter at all during the surgery?

I know plenty of MTFs who were circumcised and have had lower surgery. I don&#39;t know the exact process of creating the vagina but I imagine if they can do it on ladies who&#39;ve had their foreskin removed then they should be able to do it on someone with phimosis.

Don‘t fix it, mich better chance of good results if there‘s no prior scarring.
</p>
<p>
Also what part the foreskin gets used in depends on the surgeon, but: they can pull back much harder than you would be able to anyway.

Yeah exactly. And I&#39;m also thinking about the money situation as well. The mtf surgery top and bottom costs enough as is without aslo having to worry about another surgery on top of that.

Oh absolutely. But if you&#39;re in America you could potentially get the circumcision covered if the doctors feel your phimosis is severe.

You are not circumcised, so in my opinion it makes no difference. It might be used, just make sure your surgeon knows about it, which is why you have a meeting before your surgery.

It’s not a problem for srs, and you should not try to fix it as it can only lead to worse results.

There’s a case in this pdf where she had it. You’ll need to search.

It may limit the techniques your surgeon can use and it will probably limit the maximum depth you&#39;ll get but AFAIK it shouldn&#39;t prevent the surgery. I&#39;ve known of a few people that have had phimosis and got bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
This is a question for your surgeon at consultation.

It&#39;s gonna be fine. Surgeons know how to work with all sorts of genital sizes and shapes. What ever you do: don&#39;t get circumcised, it&#39;s better to have all the tissue available for surgery that you can.

It&#39;s up to you but I would strongly advise against going in to a circumcision without educating yourself first. I was recommended for a circumcision and I have strongly regretted it. Basically my doctor did not even offer me ointment or tell me to try when i had tight skin that caused very minor stretchmarks, when i went to the urologist he said he would remove the scars which were about 5mm (quarter inch) and there was no discussion of alternative methods or what to expect, sexual sensation or function and after the surgery I was left with a horrid transitional scar, tubules, skin bridges and inability and sex became anxiety inducing.. i had about 5 inches of skin removed (7 inches plus when stretched) which was comprised of 2-3inches of outer skin additional 3inches (approx) of inner mucosal skin, I went from being able to masterbate to orgasm in under 5 minutes to now taking an hour or more with no orgasm, i have constant discomfort and in order to restore my foreskin using special devices i now need another surgery to fix the several issues that are getting in the way beforehand.  the typical amount of foreskin removed when unfolded and slightly stretched equals roughly a square foot and it&#39;s easy to see why this is valuable for a vaginoplasty... I would like to avoid having a colon or peritoneal vaginoplasty out of country where my country will not pay for it. instead i now have to get a more invasive surgery that may not provide as much sensation or aesthics without more risky skin grafts and fork over at least $20,000.00 just ot get the depth and look  i would get had i not been a victim of medical malpractice...  to make matters worse i had requested my medical records and it turns out the surgeon had falsified the documents stating we discussed alternate methods, there was no follow up appointment offered, i was under the age of consent but nobody signed for me also..
</p>
<p>
sadly foreskins are actually repurposed for the pharmaceutical industry in luxury cremes and they can be worth upwards of $100,000.00  so it&#39;s easy to see why they want to get ass much as possible regardless of the repercussions.:
</p>
<p>
Edit: I was wrong.. &#34;A total of 199 trans patients underwent surgery from September 2017 to August 2020. Median time to orgasm was 180 days. 178 patients had completed one year of follow up or greater, and of these patients, 153 (86%) were orgasmic and 25 patients (14%) were not (Figure 1). Difficulty in pre-operative orgasm was correlated only with older age (median age 45.9 years versus 31.7, p=.03). Post-operative orgasm was not significantly correlated with pre-operative orgasm&#34;
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get circumcised in my opinion, there are stretches you can do to fix your phimosis- just look it up online, if the surgeon decides you need to have that particular tissue removed during vaginoplasty they can worry about it because they will know exactly how much they can remove without compromising the result.

if you do decide to go make sure you are explicit about how much tissue will be removed and get a tattoo to draw the line or something

These specific questions are always best to ask your surgeon. They will tell you if they can work with it or not.

Some people here don&#39;t seem to know the difference between phimosis and not being circumcised. That&#39;s a question to ask your doctor, but as everything will be open and the head of the penis will be your clit, I don&#39;t believe there is any issue.
