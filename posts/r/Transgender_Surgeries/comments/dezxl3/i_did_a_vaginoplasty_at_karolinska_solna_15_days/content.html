I did a vaginoplasty at Karolinska Solna 15 days ago and I&#39;m starting to regret it so hard. It looks disgusting and is a growing infected wound thats starting to consume everything. They say everything is normal and they can&#39;t do anything. It smells so bad and it hurts.

This looks pretty similar to what I dealt with as far as seperation. It took some time to heal, but definitely improved to an incredible degree. Around the two week mark was when things looked at their worst. You&#39;re still mondo swollen at this point.
</p>
<p>
Are they allowing you to take epsom salt baths? I was told to do one for 10min each day and I found it helped quite a bit with pain and decreasing swelling.  If they haven&#39;t instructed you to do so, I&#39;d ask your doctor&#39;s team if you might be able to?

Suit yourself. It&#39;s what doctor Bowers has her patients do to help with healing. It&#39;s specifically epsom salt, and strictly 10min. No more than that.

My surgeon told me no baths for awhile, too. He says they&#39;re a great healing aid when you hit a certain point but it can be detrimental. Maybe it&#39;s based on differing techniques? Or maybe just different schools of thought. Idk.

Things to watch out for in any soft tissue infection:
</p>
<p>
Fevers Chills Increasing pain Increasing redness and tenderness at the surgical site Pus drainage (it matters if the drainage is coming from inside the vagina or the external incisions)
</p>
<p>
In general, 2 weeks is outside the range most people develop wound infections, however it’s not impossible. If there is a wound infection, most likely it’s bacterial. Fungal wound infections are rare uncommon in post op  wounds and viruses are basically unheard of (at least in first world countries).
</p>
<p>
In that area, the abx that you would get would start off with broad spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Likely, your surgeon would only tailor the antibiotics if they had a wound culture telling them the specific organism.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure if anyone will be able to tell you whether you have an infection or not without examining you in person.

These are just general points for any post surgical wound. If you think it’s infected, then maybe you would like to treat this patient accordingly?

The white stuff looks semi-normal to me, but I’m not a doc nor do I have first hand experience (just lots of research).
</p>
<p>
Don’t freak out too much in the first 3 months- I’ve seen tons of results that looked terrible at first, then a few weeks later they look COMPLETELY different/better.

That stuff that looks like an infection is likely part of the healing process. I’ve had it before with wounds. Other than that, it looks like it is healing well. It takes time. It will look different every week as you heal.

It is very common to have separation in that area. I had some. Be careful not to stick your dilator in it like I did. Keep an eye on it, and see where you are at in a week or so. Keep your surgeon in the loop. It sounds like they aren’t concerned at this point. I know it’s difficult. I’ve been there, but you will soon be seeing improvement.

How many days ago did you talk to your doctor? If the infection has gotten worse since then, you might want to contact them again.
</p>
<p>
Keep it clean and keep an eye on it, it may start to heal up soon. If it keeps getting worse, I&#39;m sure your surgeon will want to do something about it.

That&#39;s rough.. do they have you using any sort of antibiotics? I would purchase a triple antibiotic over the counter ointment and use it often. Spray yourself off after every trip to the restroom with a peribottle. Make sure you&#39;re also taking a probiotic to help with healing.

Thats why you should use antibiotics with a wider spectrum but you definitely need one ASAP.
</p>
<p>
And the wound also needs to be cleaned. (Cleaning first). Afterwards you should have a doctor check it at least every second day. This could also do your family doctor.

They are not illegal.
</p>
<p>
When I did SRS in Linköping 11 months ago I had 3 antibiotics for a week, then 1 more week of a single antibiotic. I can check to see which ones they were, if you like.

Neosporin isn&#39;t recommended so much any more because of allergic reactions, but that&#39;s in wounds that aren&#39;t infected.

I&#39;m totally not saying that neosporin is going to fix it. But in America that&#39;s how our healthcare goes. The white in the center does look normal to healing in intense burn and surgical situations. the yellowing looks like it could be infection and that&#39;s why I say a triple antibiotic ointment. This is just a severe wound dehiscence that needs rest and potentially resutured.

Are you able to visit a doctor or hospital? I know it&#39;ll be hard but any doctor should be able to tell you if it&#39;s infected and what it&#39;s infected with by doing a swab or blood test. An infected wound is an infected wound, they should be able to tell what it is and do a general treatment even if they aren&#39;t specialists.
</p>
<p>
This is completely different but when I had top surgery (ftm) my incision lines started getting pustules and splitting a couple months after my surgery my doctor despite just being a general gp, was able to give me a steroid cream that healed it up pretty fast. Turned out it was because some of my internal stitches had failed to dissolve and my body was freaking out about them.

You absolutely need some local antibiotics if you ask me. Something Like fucidine id suggest. This sounds and looks pretty much like an infection. You should see a doctor ASAP. I am a medicine student. Doesnt mean I know a lot but this looks pretty obvious to me.

<p>
Best for your healing process.

Is the smell kinda fish-like, and is the mucus yellowish with a greenish tint? If so, it may very well be part of normal healing.  I had very similar things going on when I was dealing with a broken stitch after a pilonidal excision.

Ask the doc to give you an antibiotic anyway to &#34;make sure it is not getting infected&#34; because 1) it
<em>
can&#39;t

really hurt, and 2) this sounds more like an infection based on the smell. I watched some of Saving Private Ryan yesterday, and the medic once asked another member of his squad if a soldier&#39;s leg wound smelled &#34;south of cheese&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Also, green mucus rather than yellow or white is an indicator of bacterial pneumonia as opposed to other causes of pneumonia, so it may very well be infected.  Also check if the area is unusually warm, that&#39;s another indicator of the immune response to bacterial infection.

Swedish doctors aren&#39;t very keen on prescribing antibiotics &#34;just in case&#34; due to overuse and incorrect use of antibiotics breeds bacteria that are resistive or even immune to antibiotics. You&#39;ll generally only get antibiotics when your illness is identified as being of bacterial origin. No &#34;I&#39;ll prescribe you these antibiotics just in case&#34;.
</p>
<p>
It sounds to me that this specific doctor is being a bit overzealous about that.

Ask him to explain.  Ask him to address every concern you have and to stop giving you platitudes.

Hej! Are you without hormones? If so, how long? It normal not be in the right mind after a while without hormones so ask them if you can start it again!
</p>
<p>
You should definitely call 1177 so them can contact the doctor because this can be an emergency.

Okay. So if you&#39;re feeling bad I think a call to the doctors may be a good idea. But remember that it&#39;s a tough surgery and your body it&#39;s trying it&#39;s hard to adapt to the new way of working. Some parts will be gone, others will stay.

Just thought now: so you have their emails? Maybe sending a photo may help
