And here are answers to all the questions I wish other people gave information about as well!
</p>
<p>
[Edit: In an attempt to make this post easier to read in the future, &#34;January&#34; in the next paragraph is January 2022. All events in this account are relative to that.]
</p>
<p>
My overall timeline was to start HRT last January (first Planned Parenthood, then Plume).  I moved a few times but eventually landed in Boston in late Spring.  I contacted Brigham and Women&#39;s trans health program and enrolled.  I was really busy but began talking to the program coordinator about FFS in July.
</p>
<p>
In August life had calmed down enough to make plans so I scheduled a consult first with Dr. Ranganathan.  First available appointment was in mid-September which I took.  She&#39;s the newer surgeon in the program but also the Director of Maxillofacial Reconstruction at the hospital, so I think she&#39;s talented.  That consult was pretty low key, but she seemed pretty brilliant.  She was extremely personable and asked me about my own goals and then rattled off a whole bunch of procedures she felt I&#39;d benefit from.  She said her two pre-surgical requirements were that I needed my hormones stable and I needed to be close to a comfortable weight, as losing a lot of weight after surgery could lead to sagging skin.  Totally makes sense. She does a two-stage surgery: top of the face first (nose and higher), bottom of the face second (jaw, mouth).
</p>
<p>
After this I scheduled a consult with Dr. O&#39;Brien-Coon.  Life got busy again so I made that call in October.  I always planned to consult with both but the program coordinator said the hospital doesn&#39;t allow two scheduled consults, but once a patient consults with one he prioritizes them getting a consult with the other if they so wish.  I first needed a CT for surgical planning so I had that performed in mid-November and my consult was right after Thanksgiving.  This consult was everything I wanted it to be so I&#39;m going to bullet-point the details.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I met first with his medical assistant for medical history, then his PA for some more advanced screening, and then he came in.  At the end I met with the program&#39;s social worker to discuss insurance coverage and some other practical stuff.  I met with a lot of people.  Overall I was in meetings for about three hours.
</li>
<li>
He had a very full binder with lots of before-and-after pictures that highlighted what had changed.  Extremely helpful!  He did comment that many pictures were taken before the patients&#39; swelling had fully abated because it&#39;s extremely hard to get patients back in after the amount of time full reduction in swelling takes.
</li>
<li>
He reviewed a computer model of my skull with me and discussed where he recommended making changes.  Some of the changes he explained were not so much ones that distinguish male vs female but are generally found to make a person more attractive (eg moving my chin forward).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
[side note: Dr. Ranganathan apparently uses the same imaging for surgical planning, but she only does that after the patient is scheduled.  When I consulted with her she said that she&#39;s currently scheduling 3-4 months out.  That consultation was in September.]
</p>
<ul>
<li>
My appointment had to be moved later in the day because his flight was delayed coming back from Spain, and he mentioned he was flown out for two weeks for training.  I did some
<a href="https://facialteam.eu/training-education/ffs-training-program-22/">research
</a>
and learned later he was invited to speak at a conference organized by Facial Team (and they list him as International Faculty, the only such person).
</li>
<li>
He listened to all my concerns and was very effective at discussing them with me.
</li>
<li>
His process breaks FFS into two stages.  The first stage is all the bone work as well as soft-tissue work that&#39;s not dependent on bone work.  My hairline is going to be lowered in stage one because there isn&#39;t much value in seeing how things look after healing to determine how much I need it or how much to lower it.
</li>
<li>
He uses Stage 2 for procedures that he wants me to decide on after I see how I change from stage one (stuff like rhinoplasty, blepharoplasty, neck lift, etc).  He also said that I can split surgery into more stages and be covered by insurance so long as it&#39;s a procedure we haven&#39;t done before.  If I want fat grafting in stage 2 and want to see the results before deciding on rhinoplasty, that&#39;s an option.
</li>
<li>
He gave me a few benchmarks for recovery time: six weeks to return to work, six months for most swelling to be gone, up to a year for full healing.  I mentioned I work fully from home and he suggested two weeks until going back to work.  He did add that he&#39;s seen patients return to remote work after one week but neither envies nor recommends doing so.
</li>
<li>
The one place he discouraged me was tracheal shave.  He says he does it, but only recommends it for patients who come in and are deadset on having it.  That makes sense to me and I feel like the decision was still left to me to make.
</li>
<li>
I asked if I&#39;d need to complete facial hair removal first and he said no, though I&#39;ll need to stop shaving for some time while healing.
</li>
<li>
I also asked about weight loss as a surgical pre-requisite, he said losing weight first if I want is optimal but not fully necessary.  He didn&#39;t think I need to lose a ton of weight because I don&#39;t carry much in my face.  I do carry weight in my neck, but a lift isn&#39;t part of the first pass.
</li>
<li>
If you look up any website where he has a professional representation, you may wonder if he&#39;s 25 years old based on his picture.  I&#39;m pretty sure he had professional headshots taken like 20+ years ago and has been reusing them since.  He&#39;s middle-aged and not a fresh graduate.
</li>
<li>
At several points he told me that he was very specifically wording notes in my file in ways that insurance would find them palatable.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All-in-all it was a very easy choice to book surgery with him.  I&#39;m currently waiting for an exact date- apparently there&#39;s so much interdisciplinary involvement that scheduling requires coordination across multiple departments&#39; calendars, but I&#39;m being tentatively quoted early August.  I&#39;d rather do April but c&#39;est la vie.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea what this is going to actually cost.  FFS and is fully covered by my insurance and this is all preferred in-network providers.  For me out of pocket I&#39;m anticipating a few hundred bucks.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to answer any other questions anyone may have!
