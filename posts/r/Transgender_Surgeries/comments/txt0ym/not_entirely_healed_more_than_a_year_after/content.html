So, I had GRS with Stiller in March of last year (penile inversion technique). During my follow-up, his office noticed I still had quite a bit of granulation tissue near the suture areas inside my vag. This could explain the random (but infrequent) bleeding I&#39;ve gotten from time to time (usually around once a month lol) and the greyish discharge I&#39;ve sometimes noticed on my pads.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, they suggested silver nitrate treatment to flush out the tissue. I opted not to do it that day in-office, since I had a bus ride back home the next day and dealing with bloody discharge in a greyhound bathroom sounded demonic. But I&#39;m scheduled to get the treatment from my doctor tomorrow, and I&#39;ve been really nervous. It&#39;s been a long(ish) road for me recovering from surgery, with a few lingering infections that have now resolved themselves and recurrent UTI&#39;s (or something else? it&#39;s weird), but seemingly no serious complications, which is good.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone else dealt with the lingering granulation issue? Or have you had silver nitrate treatment for something similar? They want me to get it done once a month for 2-4 months, and if it doesn&#39;t resolve itself by then, they may want to do it under anesthesia at Stiller&#39;s office, which I very much do not want. I&#39;m also just worried about silver nitrate generally and I do not know where to find good info about it...

So basically, granulation tissue is a minor complication that can occur when the body tries to heal -any- break in the surface of the skin. Basically it tries to heal as fast as possible but sometimes it overdoes it and so some of what is meant to be vascularized internal skin tissue gets pushed up and out to the surface during healing, which then is a problem because the vascularized tissues are exposed and susceptible to irritation of damage, causing pain and bleeding.
</p>
<p>
Silver nitrate is a caustic chemical that is activated by moisture. Which makes it perfect for treating granulation tissue because granulation is very moist tissue. By placing a very small amount of silver nitrate onto the end of a thin stick, silver nitrate can be precision applied so that it cauterizes the granulation into non-existence. It will literally melt it away, and the remnant will slough away over time as you heal from the treatment.
</p>
<p>
Depending on nerve regeneration in the area of the granulation and the granulation itself it may sting a slight bit, but it is usually not bad, and generally the treatment will make you feel a million times better than when the granulation was there.
</p>
<p>
The downside to silver nitrate is that it temporarily stains the skin silver/gray, and it can last a few weeks. This can be minimized by care application to the exact location of the granulation, but some of the surrounding tissue will get stained, and if the moisture runoff soaks into a pad then the pad can cause staining on any skin touching the pad. Another potential downside is that, since it is activated by moisture, if applied to granulation on the inside of the vagina, any excess silver nitrate left on the treated area may rub onto other vaginal tissues and cause slight irritation, but thankfully there usually is not much excess deposited during treatment so it&#39;s a minimal risk.
</p>
<p>
If there is a rather large amount of granulation tissue inside the vagina, then the easier, quick solution is to use a cautery device to excise the granulation surgically while under anesthesia. One treatment and it&#39;s gone.
</p>
<p>
Usually after either method of treatment you will want to leave it alone for a little bit, but after a while you can shower to wash off/out. Usually a steroid cream is prescribed to help with the post-treatment healing, which can be smeared on a dilator and inserted to apply it to the inside of the vagina, if needed.

This all sounds like a lot, but really it&#39;s not a huge thing. The doctor will open you up with a speculum so they can see inside, and then take a plastic stick with a tiny amount of silver nitrate on the tip and rub the tip of it against the granulation a little bit. Might take one stick, might take a few, but that&#39;s it, that&#39;s the treatment.

What should I be worried about with the granulation tissue if it doesn&#39;t go away? I&#39;ve been having a couple of unexplained medical issues since my surgery so now I&#39;m wondering if this is related.

I had it done about 5 weeks after surgery, but they only managed to get some of it. Then a few months later I started getting pain+bleeding and I had the rest removed by my local gynecologist, she asked a lot of normie questions about trans stuff but was about as respectful as a curious cis person can get so it was ok, she gave me 5 treatments over about 5 weeks to make sure she get rid of it. It doesn&#39;t hurt much to get it removed, I wasn&#39;t given any painkillers or anesthetics for it personally.

YouÂ´re not the only one.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://marcibowers.com/transfem/gav/post-op-care/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/surgeries/transfeminine/index#wiki_after_surgery" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
might be some resources. Talk it through with your med persons in case.
</p>
<p>
And a number of people said pelvic floor training was helpful in general.
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/u8tlqf/protip_for_difficult_vaginoplasty_recovery_see_a/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
may be more.
</p>
<p>
And looking for local med people who are experienced with trans people may also be recommendable. Asking at lgbt places or support groups for a referral may be a good idea.
