I&#39;m keeping a diary of my time at GRS Montreal and sharing it here for you lovely folks to read. I&#39;ll answer any comments or questions I get. Otherwise, just enjoy the show.
</p>
<h1>

<p>
I&#39;m home! And it feels damn good to be home. I got to dialate on a queen bed with all my creature comforts, and all the privacy in the world. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll wear pants indoors until christmas xD
</p>
<p>
I think the staff and facilities at GRS are top-notch, but I was so ready to leave by the end. And I think that speaks volumes about how well-prepared they leave you by the end. You&#39;ll have learned everything you need and have every piece of equipment you need to take care of yourself. None of the (admitted few) others I spoke to said they were unprepared to continue on their own.
</p>
<p>
Flying was actaully fine - or as fine as a 3 hour Air Canada Rouge flight can get. The killer was - as most of you correctly pointed out - walking around the airports. I had planned to hold off on the Tramadol until I really needed it. That plan lasted 5 minutes until we got to security, then I popped 2 immediately after getting my carry-on back.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully all our gates were close by, and enough benches in between to take very necessary breaks. Yes, all your comments on the last post said to use the wheelchairs or golf carts. Yes, I ignored them. The only time I regretted that was at my home airport, when the Tramadol had wore off and I was too excited to leave to take any breaks. Plus I got another rank Tramadol headache in the car home, but nothing was going to dampen my spirits.
</p>
<p>
Until I got home and tried to unpack my own suitcase and had a bit of cry because I physically couldn&#39;t find the energy to do it. I&#39;m blaming that one on travel exhaustion though xD
</p>
<p>
I could go on to describe my own whole evening, but these posts were meant to document my time at GRS and that time is now over. I want to thank everyone who left kind words, and I hope at least someone found this diary useful. If nothing else, it was useful to me, just to organise my thoughts and decompress at the end of each day.
</p>
<p>
And that - finally - is all I have to say. My love to you all, and goodnight!

Thank you so much for writing about your experience, as someone who is still on the waiting list to go to GRS Montreal it was really lovely to hear about your experience going there and returning home.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best in your recovery and journey ahead ðŸ’œ

I have been following your posts since day one and I&#39;m very glad everything seemed to have gone well. I really appreciate you documenting the process, I am probably going to get my vag at GRS as well and I have been quite terrified to undergo such a massive surgery, but your posts and others like it definitely help to ease the fear (a bit haha).
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing you experience!

Thanks for the diary Kayla! Found your posts while preparing for surgery with Laungani in 14 days. I&#39;m scared, but your posts helped me realize it&#39;s just a day by day journey.
