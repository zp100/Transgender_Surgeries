Today was a very big day for me, and I probably pushed myself a little bit too hard. I don&#39;t think I really did any damage, but I did land myself in some significant pain.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t sleep very well overnight again, this time due to feeling bloated due to gas, I would shift positions and it would dissipate, then build again. Dr. Krakowsky checked in on me again this morning, and everything was looking good, though the colours have gotten angrier (my majora were showing some yellow yesterday, today they were red and purple.) Still asymmetric swelling. Emery stopped by later to get me up and moving a bit more. I&#39;m more confident walking today, and the packing wasn&#39;t bothering me quite as much. I tried sitting down again, and it was an experience, I managed to put my weight on my butt, but it wasn&#39;t comfortable for more than a few seconds. I had to start shifting positions hunting around for some comfort and using my arms to offload. Since I was being discharged from the hospital later, just being able to sit felt like a huge milestone. While shifting around, one of the nurses took out my IVs, which made getting back into bed easier since I was able to flex my wrists fully again.
</p>
<p>
They also took out the drain, despite assurances that it wouldn&#39;t hurt a lot and I probably wouldn&#39;t really feel it, I definitely noticed in painful detail the feeling of the tubing coming out of my butt cheek. They were right that I didn&#39;t really feel anything in the vulva itself though. I would definitely recommend taking some pain meds beforehand.
</p>
<p>
Discharge from WCH was a little bit uncoordinated since Emery was stuck in clinic, but things resolved themselves and I got hooked up with the kit, and had my wife pick up my prescriptions from the pharmacy in the lobby. (Glad I didn&#39;t need to try to do that myself. I think if necessary they could find some way to make it easier, but since I had my wife with me, it wasn&#39;t an issue.) I took a painkiller before leaving, which would come in handy after getting to ARC. Riding in a wheelchair to the exit was a humbling reminder that seats are not my friend right now. Fortunately for me, I was able to ride in the front seat of our car for the drive over to ARC, with the seat fully reclined and me rolled partway up onto my side, I was actually pretty comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Intake to ARC was a longer process than expected since they were a bit overwhelmed and their community health worker had needed to step out for an emergency. More sitting in a chair while details were sorted out. I was buffered by the painkiller and managed by keeping my weight out on my hips instead of over the centerline. The nurses got intake sorted out and I got in to my room (a double room, but I&#39;m the only occupant), complete with a proper hospital bed with powered controls and a remote. We got my things setup (I am a techie and travel with more gadgets than really necessary) and my wife headed out while I got to lie down and take a load off.
</p>
<p>
The part where I pushed myself too hard was where I decided that it would be a good idea to try for dinner in the cafeteria instead of taking the nurses up on the offer of dinner in bed. The usual routine is to eat in the cafeteria, and I thought it would be a good idea to see if I could manage it. The answer was barely, I couldn&#39;t seem to find the rolled up on my hip position again, and I was in growing pain while working through my meal (better than the hospital food!) and doing up my menu plan for the weekend. After that, I stood up to keep strain off my incisions while we went over my medication routine, and got my next dose of painkillers (another lesson learned, painkillers first, painful experience second.) Getting back in bed and getting some cold packs onto my vulva felt great.
</p>
<p>
My majora were an angry purple and more swollen when I got back to my bed and I&#39;ve got some seepage from one of my primary incisions about halfway down on one side, but the sutures stayed intact. I don&#39;t think its a major issue, though I&#39;ll follow up with Emery in the morning through the chat app that WCH uses. After a couple of hours with cold on my vulva, the colour and swelling went back down to where it had been earlier. At this point, I&#39;m worn out and ready to sleep. I brought a stuffed sheep that would survive being steamed, and I&#39;m very glad that I get to cuddle Snuffles tonight.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the nurses at ARC have been super caring, the nurses at WCH were a slightly more mixed bag ranging from fantastic and really in tune with my needs (the nurse in recovery, the overnight nurses, 2 of the day nurses) to uninformed and needing a lot of guidance (I had to tell a nurse to stop before she used an alcohol swab to apply polysporin to the incision lines on my clitoral hood and labia minora. I then suggested that she use a cotton swab like the other nurses had been using. She listened.) Part of this is that the TRS program isn&#39;t the only thing going on at WCH and with the low volume of patients, the specialized knowledge hasn&#39;t spread very far beyond the nurses that were initially trained. There&#39;s a bit of &#34;left hand, meet right hand.&#34; going on between the TRS program and the AACU. Emery is able to get things sorted out when needed.

Today was pretty busy, so this one was a bit bigger than my earlier posts. As always, feel free to ask me anything.

You&#39;re welcome. I found that the biggest anxiety I had beforehand wasn&#39;t the surgery itself, it was how the recovery process would go since nobody else had really posted anything about what it was like for surgery at WCH. I want to help alleviate some of that for others if I can.
</p>
<p>
ARC is an Acute Respite Care center for short term recovery from acute health issues for under-housed, homeless, or socially isolated individuals. It&#39;s run by the Sherbourne Health centre, and is very LGBTQ friendly. It has a few beds set aside specifically for people recovering from transition related surgeries. WCH discharges you on day 3 post-op, and you need to stay in town for the first 2 weeks after surgery. I don&#39;t live in Toronto, and have limited support available in town, so Emery referred me to them for my stay in Toronto while I recover.
