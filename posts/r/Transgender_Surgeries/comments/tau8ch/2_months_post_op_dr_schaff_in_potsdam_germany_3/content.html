I had my SRS with Dr Schaff on January 10th so I‚Äôm now 2 months post OP. The first week in the hospital I had quite significant pain and discomfort, but the staff were generally very sweet and helped me in any way they could. After they removed the packing on day 7 I was immediately a lot more comfortable and felt even better when they removed the catheter at day 10. On that day I also had a smaller procedure done to widen my introitus to make insertion easier, which was with local anesthesia. I didn‚Äôt have any pain from that, but it happened kind of suddenly, so be aware that this can happen (It happened to another girlwho was there with me as well). I spent 14 nights in total at the hospital and was glad to be gone by then ‚Äì the food was not great!
</p>
<p>
I started dilation around the 12th day, at first 3 times per day for roughly 15 minutes and between those sessions I was told to always wear a placeholder (a piece of gauze covered with a condom). The placeholder was very bothersome to me becaus it kept sliding out, so after 1 month I decided to go without them. I don‚Äôt recommend this; however it hasn‚Äôt affected me much. At this point I dilate twice per day.
</p>
<p>
My recovery went very well, I didn‚Äôt have any noticeable pain after week 2 and didn‚Äôt have any (even minor) bleeding after 3 weeks post OP. Dr Schaff‚Äôs technique creates relatively pronounced labia and those got very swollen for me. Swelling has taken a long time to go down and there‚Äôs still a lot of it. I‚Äôve found taking Bromelain supplements helps, as well as Zink, Vitamin A and Arginine. Some areas also don‚Äôt have full sensation yet, but I am noticing improvements there. I am very satisfied with the functionality ‚Äì I had my first orgasm at 5 weeks post OP and find them relatively easy to achieve when I‚Äôm in the mood. I also had sex with my fianc√© last week and it was good! Didn‚Äôt have an orgasm then but I think that‚Äôs more a matter of practice. My depth is 6 inches (~15cm).
</p>
<p>
I also decided to get a BA on February 16th, so a bit over 5 weeks after my first surgery. Again, I don‚Äôt necessarily recommend this for everyone but I‚Äôm very happy that I did it. I got 280cc teardrop/anatomical microtextured implants from the brand Polytech, medium profile. They‚Äôre over the muscle, which is something I insisted on because I‚Äôm an athletic person and I don‚Äôt want to compromise my muscles in that area.

I didn&#39;t have BA with Dr Schaff, it was with Dr Sebastian Dunda here in Berlin. I payed that out of pocket, but it would have been cheaper than with Schaff (I think he charges around 8k for a BA, tho I&#39;m not certain).
</p>
<p>
I did get full coverage for bottom surgery tho, I was very lucky with my insurance!

Hello! I&#39;m on german public health insurance, mine is BKK VBU. They have a contract with the private clinic he operates in and I managed to get full coverage through them, however that is not guaranteed. I got lucky, but I assume they often pay at least a partial amount.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re not in the german healthcare system at all I assume getting it covered would be more difficult.

This is really helpful!

I&#39;m with TK, and I&#39;ve heard not so great things about them helping out with coverage for Dr. Schaff.

I heard back from him immediately (basically the same day) but I sent all my info to the email on his own website, not to the clinic. I basically didn&#39;t communicate with the clinic at all until the week before my surgery.

Mostly the much shorter recovery time and in general it is recommended for aethletic people to go over. All in all I didn&#39;t see any drawbacks with choosing over the muscle so I went with that :)

I have my BA happening here in the states on 4/15! My doctor also recommended over the muscle. It was such a RELIEF to find your post because it seems so uncommon for girls like us to get over the muscle! Congratulations on the perfect twins! How long was your healing time before you were back up doing normal activities?

Awesome, you must be very excited! which implants are you going with?
</p>
<p>
If we&#39;re talking about the BA alone I would say after a week most of the discomfort was gone. Actually, I was already going out and seeing friends at 3 days post-OP, though I wouldn&#39;t recommend that and it was pretty uncomfortable. at 3-4 weeks post-OP I started getting back into my excercise routine, including push-ups and other excercises that involve the upper body. I can also walk as much as I want, though no running yet. I will wait until 6 weeks post-OP to try that.
</p>

I&#39;m considering having BA soon with similar implants (probably 300cc). Could you tell me about how they feel? Do they feel soft and as part of your breasts or more like there something inside the breasts when they are touched?
