I remember asking about them a while ago and getting inundated with negative responses, scared the crap out of me.

I had my surgery with Dr Theerapong (initial not revision) and so highly recommend him. So many horror stories from Kamol. But pretty much only happy stories from Dr Thee. Plus there is an amazing nurse option I used that works with him as well.

I hate that you have to spend more money, however a revision with Dr Thee should take care of everything for you! I saw some revision photos that he did from Kamol and the difference was night and day!

Yah ! It’s got worse since I was there 2019 summer time - Darcey wasn’t there but I’m sure her death was caused by stress and all the complaints she was dealing with ! - a Japanese gal kept QT by the place  has died recently also apparently just before Darcey died - I agree stay away from that place -

Please. Can we do something about it, if our LGBT COMMUNITY will stand for this and this hospital will pay for using innocent transgender people and scamming us for money. Obviously they know exactly that the procedure they introducing to everyone is not going to work and yet still using the social media  influencers to endorse this PPV-SRS technique.

Yes she died this last month in Bangkok , supposedly from a night time asthma attack but she apparently was an ex alcoholic - the pressure from dealing with so many botched surgeries more and likely did her in trying to deal with all this crap from apprentice surgeons fk’ing things up !!

I actually feel really bad for her. She probably got lucky originally and got really nice surgeries from Kamol and wanted to help other girls but ended up sending them to their doom and the guilt probably was too much. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if her death was a suicide honestly, sorry for being grim. It&#39;s really sad tho, she was so young and clearly wanted to help her sisters out based on her content. Also based on the way she acts in videos she appears to have a very low self esteem based on her voice, body language and the fact she carries the camera in a way that she&#39;s trying to hide certain features of her face which is really sad since she was very beautiful and feminine and passing. Rest in Peace

You know , it appears if a person is a known Celebrity like Jessica Alves ( The Human Ken Doll of fame ) and to some degree Darcey Silver an ex Stand Up Comedian from the UK that Kamol personally makes sure the surgery is done in full by him to get browny points to go to his Hospital run by a Board of directors wanting more money rolling in the doors ! He has investors that only see money not human care , just money in the end ! Otherwise without some notoriety your not getting his actual experience and the newbies wanting surgery experience are doing these surgeries now - Stay away - Thai Law is very different when it comes to punishment of bad surgery !
</p>
<p>
The only true way to stop this crap is education for others wanting to go there is “TAKE THEIR MONEY AWAY” by not going there !! - this is something they do know is ( MONEY ) and it’s the only way they LEARN and shut them down !!

Guys this is scaring me - I’m Canadian and the government won’t cover Theerapong because the hospital he works outve doesn’t want to provide the details/itemization  they require and refuses to accept payment after surgery.
</p>
<p>
Had a consult with Theerapong. It’s true he kinda is like a mad scientist lol. 😂 in the best ways possible. His results looked amazing. He said he could do colon technique and labiaplasty ( I was botched along w many others back when the Canadian Gov’t sent us all to Dr Brassard in Montreal)
</p>
<p>
My whole being tells me to go to Theerapong, but it’s so frustrating that his staff won’t set up the program to work with OHIP (Canadian Government). He said NP - he would - but his staff seemed clueless.
</p>
<p>
My only option was colon revision with Kamol. Preecha said they cannot do a revision. Now I’m scared 😳

Kamol felt so shady all fancy⚠️ that&#39;s why I choosed dr theerapong he&#39;s humble well experienced I would describe him as a mad scientist who only focus on his work without even advertising it 💡
</p>
<p>
100 recommend him

They both are equal in my limited knowledge! Dr theerapong is pioneer in colon srs while Dr suporn is with his own unique technique.

You said Dr Theerapong is good for SRS. What hôpital does he practice ?
</p>
<p>
I choose Kamol Hospital for a SRS PPV (In June 2024)but when I read comments I&#39;m afraid.
</p>
<p>
Which hospital is better for SRS? Thx

You can use for a long time ( even a whole lifetime). It is no harmful to you considerably. I use it everyday when dilating. That is why I have nothing smelly oder in my genital. Only use lube for having sex with your partner. Apart from getting aroused, you should use Betadine gel for safe.
</p>
<p>
When having a wound, Betadine will serve well. So don&#39;t worry about your 10 month time. Remember that my friends and me use it and we needn&#39;t to meet our surgeon again 😇. We used to be stressful because my neo- vagina always have problem like kinda discharge and 🩸 like you but I say &#39;No&#39; now.
</p>
<p>
Now my big problem is to keep my depth. That is OK. I have more time to do others. Facing many problems with vagina is a heavy thing. It affects you all. You can&#39;t do anything effectively because your dilating obsessions.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is a part of your life, and don&#39;t make it into your fear. I hope your better status from you soon.

Most of Thai surgeons also use betadine for dilations first. This is the first time I have seen Karmol only using lube gel for dilations. You can ask patients doing at Yanhee, Karmol (popular hospitals in Thailand). At least, mixing up between betadine and lube gel for sure. Because when your wounds are new, it intercourses with water - based lube during dilating, it is seen that you definitely will be wrong - humidity is a good place for bacterias, fungals with no anti- bacteria substance like betadine or another gel like Digizone/Surporan.

Very diluted betadine solution after dilation with lube, I’ve heard of, but not betadine instead of lube.

It depends on each surgeon but do you know ??? Thai betadine is smoother and stickier than normal Betadine for dilating. So only use betadine is enough. It doesn&#39;t mess up about your items to self-care. I use it for in and outside my healing vagina. Anyway Betadine is still unharmful one of smoothing stuff I&#39;ve known &#39;till now. I only use it for all cares, simplity is the best always.
