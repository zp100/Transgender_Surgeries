I love your results and I love that happy face you have in your more recent pictures ðŸ’™ I had my consultation with Dr. Facque just a few weeks ago for FFS and also for body contouring and breast aug. He recommended doing orbital brow contouring to make my eyebrows a little more female which sounds like a lot of work when Iâ€™m only really interested in some nose and chin treatment. Did you feel pressured at all into doing any work that you might not have otherwise? Overall love the work that he does but wanna make sure the two of us are on the same page before surgery date. Toodles!

Hey congrats! I canâ€™t say that I ever felt pressured, but there are some things I wish I would have done differently.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Getting in touch with billing to pay off the out of pocket so I wasnâ€™t surprised with a $4,000 bill a week before surgery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Making sure to clarify I wanted my purse with me when I woke up so I could call my boyfriend. It was kept in a safe when I woke up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I would have given myself a few more days before surgery to explore San Francisco and to ready myself mentally for recovery.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

Human faces arenâ€™t meant to be perfectly symmetrical. My left side has always been higher than my right, just how my face is. Plus when looking at me dead on, itâ€™s hardly noticeable.

youâ€™re right in that human faces arent meant to be perfectly symmetrical, natural human faces that is. yours is operated on and so asymmetry would be a byproduct of the surgery potentially, because i dont see that same level of asymmetry on your face pre surgery.

Iâ€™m just holding my phone at two different angles in two different lightings. Either way it doesnâ€™t bother me. Iâ€™m genuinely happy with my results.

right but the asymmetry is supposed to be corrected during surgery not exacerbated. iâ€™m not even trying to be rude, but you legitimately were not that uneven pre ffs, not even close. regardless of how much euphoria you feel and it should be a concern imo.

You may not be trying to be rude, but you are. You literally canâ€™t see all of my jaw in the first picture. I was born with some lopsidedness in my face due to some other pre existing conditions. My surgeon and I have a plan to fix my unevenness in a future surgery, it just simply would not have been safe to do it with this surgery. If you would like to see my FULL face pre-op, and me now dead on with the same angle you may message me privately, as I donâ€™t know how to add more pictures to this post. I understand what you are trying to do, but your approach is crass at best.

Actually I figured out how to add more pictures. Iâ€™ve uploaded better photos. As you can see my before picture is very lopsided. My second picture it has been corrected to a point. Eventually I will go back and have this corrected further. Now let people have their victories.

I donâ€™t know why you went to the gender confirmation center for face. They do that horrible scar line in front of hairline. I would not recommend anyone to go there for Facial Feminization Surgery they specialize in Non-B and trans masculine folks by the work Iâ€™ve seen.

I do not mind the scar. I shave my head on the regular anyway. I went to them, because the results I saw were satisfactory to my transition goals. If you go to my profile youâ€™ll see my most recent update with makeup. Iâ€™m super happy with how I turned out.

Well as long as your happy there are plenty of great Facial Feminization Surgery providers in SF like Dr. Dr. Raul Seth and Dr. Knott Dr. William Hoffman and Dr. Keojampa so I donâ€™t understand why anyone would go to GCC.

The way you phrase that isâ€¦.questionable. People have different goals, different anatomy, etc. Iâ€™d go back to them 1000000000x more if the need was there. In fact planning on going back for breast augmentation, and bottom surgery.

Yeah definitely look into your opinions hun. Out of curiosity did you have your surgery at Saint Francis and did you feel like you where treated by staff there?

I did. The staff was super helpful! The nurses took great care of me, and talked with me about my fears about having a foley. They were so patient and kind. Even the billing lady was super fun to talk to, and gave my boyfriend and I advice on what to see in the city before surgery (We are from Nebraska and donâ€™t travel much.)
