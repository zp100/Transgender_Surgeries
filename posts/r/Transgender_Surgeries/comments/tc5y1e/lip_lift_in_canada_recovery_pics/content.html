i had a lip liftin montreal and it was done under local, I honestly think having the freezing needle probe all around my nose and upper lip was the most painful ptsd causing experience I have ever had so I would definitely recommend sedation for liplift!        I put together pics to show the insane swelling I got but it turned out really nice and the dr didn&#39;t screw anything up. I was so careful during recovery not to move my upper lip too much because I didn&#39;t want any tension or separation of the incision. So I ate very little and drank mostly soups I just didn&#39;t want to risk pulling apart the incision
