So the doctor I&#39;m seeing for SRS said they&#39;ll probably want to do laser for hair removal on the testicles before surgery. Shouldn&#39;t that be electrolysis? I&#39;m very skeptical that this will work.

I&#39;m doing electrolysis. It&#39;s supposed to be more reliably permanent than laser. After doing a lot of laser on my face (16 sessions) and still needing a lot of electrolysis (probably another year going in every 3 weeks), I&#39;m not wasting my time on laser for the bottom area. I
<em>
really
</em>
don&#39;t want hair in there.

Have you started electro-down-below yet? I&#39;ve been getting my face done for the past couple years and I&#39;m curious how it compares.

I have. I started a bit ago, but I had to stop to recover from orchi. I&#39;m just now getting back into a regular schedule. It... it takes a while. And it hurts. Sometimes the zaps are real bad.
</p>
<p>
Where my electrologist worked is still smooth about a month later, but there is still so much surface area to cover yet, and I can&#39;t really give a good estimate of how long it will take. I will say that I think it is a bit easier in some places, as many of the hairs don&#39;t seem as deep as facial hair, so it is easier to get to the root.

Off topic question about electro on your face - does it leave red spots?  I wanna get started on this as soon as my laser sessions are over but I&#39;m a farily public figure in my organization and I&#39;m worried about this to a large degree..

First, I tend to heal on the fast side. So take that into consideration.
</p>
<p>
The first session on a particular area usually creates a lot of tiny bloodspots/scabs that linger around for about 4-5 days. I use a fair amount of aloe to keep the area moisturized without clogging the pores. I&#39;d guess it&#39;s taken about ten days for an area to heal up completely from that first session. But I&#39;ll also say this: no one has ever said &#34;what happened to your face?&#34; And I&#39;m out walking in the public all day long in and out of businesses.
</p>
<p>
Now I will say, because of my job I have to be careful how much sun exposure I have after a session. The only time anyone ever asked about my face was the day I placed a full-size gauze bandage over my chin and taped it there. One older lady asked me about it, and I just said I was having my face treated. No one else has said a thing, not even my co-workers, and not all of them are aware I&#39;m trans.
</p>
<p>
Sessions after the initial clearance don&#39;t tend to be quite as bad. The skin adjusts to the trauma, at least it does for me. For example, after the initial clearance I won&#39;t shave the area for a couple of weeks. But after I&#39;ve had several sessions over an area I&#39;ll usually shave it the very next day (sometimes there are really tiny hairs growing that are too short for my electrologist to get).

I think it depends on the operator and technology, but you can also reduce swelling with drugs.

There’s some information in the wiki on this, but it’s not very conclusive. Personally I’d do electrolysis.

Laser can remove a large percentage of the hair. Then electrolysis can be done for fine tuning, but a surgeon can also do scraping of the follicles during surgery to get rid of the last of it.

Yeah, laser every 5 weeks for 6-8 months then a few sessions of electrolysis to finish it off.

I think it depends on the laser. I just had my first session at a place called Milan. I believe they have several locations in America. Some lasers are run at spa type places that do other services as well. Look for a place that only does laser hair removal. The one I go to is staffed entirely by registered nurses. It’s super professional and they’re very accommodating to trans patients.

The other problem you will find - what I&#39;m dealing with now - is that laser only gets black or very dark hairs.  It appears, while not seen before treatments, I have a TON of blonde hairs that dont get touched by the laser.  My body hair has recently also changed from black to blondish brown ( hormone related? )  I do not know why this is though, but its proving to cause plenty of issue with laser removal.

I too had the hair colour shift and the issues with laser and my red/blonde hairs. I used laser to knock out the bulk of the darker hairs and have had electro for the others. I ask the tech to focus on the light hairs and have laser do the dark ones.
<br>
My electrologist was the person to suggest going elsewhere to get laser and reduce the bulk of dark hairs.
<br>
In my case I still will have 9months prior to surgery after I wrap up laser. During that time, I&#39;ll be doing electro (facial primarily) til the end of time, so if anything pops up, I can take care of it during my biweekly session.

i go to milan as well and have been for about 5 sessions now. it’s definitely working and my face is almost completely hair free at this point.

The have been great about me being trans and honestly it’s been one of the most welcoming places i’ve been.

Laser is not permanent and the follicles will grow back after a few years and begin producing terminal hairs again.  You&#39;re correct that electrolosis is the only way for it to be permament.
</p>
<p>
Scraping from the inside scrapes off nerve endings too, that&#39;s why some girls report having no feeling on the walls.  If you want quality results, you need quality techniques.  Don&#39;t try to take shortcuts when it comes to your body.

The FDA&#39;s own definition of how laser works is very different than yours. I think you misunderstand what &#34;permanent hair reduction&#34; means in this context. Laser is very permanent if performed properly.

I think their definition is actually exactly the same, that&#39;s why electrolosis is the only FDA recognized permanent hair reduction treatment-- because it&#39;s the only one that&#39;s permanent. :shrug:

No. The FDA calls laser &#34;permanent hair reduction&#34;
<em>
not
</em>
because it&#39;ll grow back, but because laser can only target dark hair and virtually everyone has at least some light hair mixed in, even if they don&#39;t realize it. Therefore only the dark hair will be removed, but any white/blonde hairs will remain -- hence a reduction in
<em>
overall
</em>
hair growth, but pretty well permanent for darker hairs that are properly treated.

Since this comes up from time to time here is an FDA source with the relevant extract:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20180424190505/https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/ResourcesforYouRadiationEmittingProducts/ucm252757.htm#1" rel="nofollow">https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20180424190505/https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/ResourcesforYouRadiationEmittingProducts/ucm252757.htm#1</a>
</p>
<p>
&#34;Several manufacturers received FDA permission to claim, &#34;permanent reduction,&#34; NOT &#34;permanent removal&#34; for their lasers. This means that although laser treatments with these devices will permanently reduce the total number of body hairs, they will not result in a permanent removal of all hair. The specific claim granted is &#34;intended to effect stable, long-term, or permanent reduction&#34; through selective targeting of melanin in hair follicles. Permanent hair reduction is defined as the long-term, stable reduction in the number of hairs re-growing after a treatment regime, which may include several sessions. The number of hairs regrowing must be stable over time greater than the duration of the complete growth cycle of hair follicles, which varies from four to twelve months according to body location. Permanent hair reduction does not necessarily imply the elimination of all hairs in the treatment area.&#34;

That kind of just says reduction means reduction, but doesn&#39;t explain how its reduced or if there will be any regrowth years later, etc.

It may not be the most helpful definition, but it is the FDA&#39;s definition. The crux is what is meant by long-term. I suspect that as long as it lasts longer than a full growth cycle you wouldn&#39;t be successful in a lawsuit for false advertising if the operator only claimed what the FDA allowed them to claim. The equipment and techniques are still relatively new compared to electrolysis, so I don&#39;t imagine there are any 20 year studies on effectiveness. Personally, I did laser on my face with electrolysis to &#34;clean up&#34; the remaining hairs. I believe that was the best decision for that part of my body. Before surgery, I just went with electrolysis as it seemed the most prudent for an area where future removal would be extremely difficult. It would be cool if there was more published studies on the effectiveness of hair removal techniques specifically for GRS.

Not really though. Case in point:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This means that although laser treatments with these devices will
<strong>

</strong>
the total number of body hairs, they will not result in a permanent removal of all hair.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That&#39;s pretty clear that the reduction is permanent, not just &#34;long term&#34;. Because....
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The specific claim granted is &#34;intended to effect stable, long-term, or permanent reduction&#34; through selective targeting of melanin in hair follicles.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, exactly what I said before: because laser targets and affects melanin (ie darker colored hair), then it results in permanent reduction because it&#39;s affecting dark hair, but not lighter hairs that lack sufficient melanin content for the laser to be effective on them. In other words, there is a reduction (the dark hair that the laser will kill), but not all hair because not all hair is dark enough for the laser (and most people have at least a little bit of lighter hair mixed in.)

Googling the question &#34;is laser hair removal permanent&#34;, shows no sources that even claim that it is.  The FDA does actually
<em>
not
</em>
call it permanent hair reduction at all, and practitioners are actually forbidden from saying it&#39;s permanent because that would be false advertising.  It&#39;s like waxing that lasts a bit longer.  That&#39;s why most people advertise it as
<em>
long-lasting
</em>
hair removal and not permanent.
</p>
<p>
Now consider the fact that there&#39;s no way to treat the area after surgery.  It shouldn&#39;t even be an option to go with something that isn&#39;t permanent.

The terminal hairs don&#39;t come back for a really long time, but the villus hairs never go away in the first place with laser.  Personally, I&#39;d like zero hair inside my vagina.  If other people are cool with having hair on the inside, more power to them.  It just burns me when I see people spreading misinformation to people who might not be okay with having hair inside.

That&#39;s literally what they&#39;ve always referred to it as, and most websites out there that discuss laser use that exact same verbiage specially for that reason. This is also still reflected on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_hair_removal" rel="nofollow">Wiki entry for LHR</a>
. Practioners are absolutely allowed to call it &#34;permanent hair reduction&#34;, and most do. It&#39;s flat out incorrect to state that it&#39;s just like longer-lasting waxing, and shows a massive misunderstanding of how it works on your part.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it appears the FDA&#39;s site was rearranged at some point over the past several months, and much of the info about LHR isn&#39;t there anymore. The page(s) that we used to reference when having this discussion (because you aren&#39;t the first to misunderstand) are no longer there. They&#39;re even still linked to on the Wiki page for laser hair removal (ref 7 and 9, a page called &#34;Laser Facts&#34; and &#34;Radiation-Emitting Devices: Laser Facts, respectively), but they take you to error pages on the FDA&#39;s site now. I wish I&#39;d saved them, but I haven&#39;t had this argument with someone in over a year and didn&#39;t think the FDA would revamp things the way they have.

<a href="/u/misscolinsxx" rel="nofollow">u/misscolinsxx</a>
does hair removal professionally. You can ask her.

I mean, I&#39;m currently undergoing electrolosis.  As I stated before, my surgeons require specifically electrolosis because it&#39;s the only technique that will eradicate the hair, not just minimally reduce the appearance of it.  Laser is a great technique for something like your legs that have a large area and villus hairs are inconsequential, but is a
<em>
terrible
</em>
technique for something that can&#39;t be redone later when it needs to be.
</p>
<p>
Also I&#39;ve talked to a lot of people who&#39;ve gotten laser, and I currently see a 20-year industry veteran once a week.  Everyone agrees that it&#39;s a terrible technique for such a sensitive area, and it won&#39;t be able to clear the area anyways.  All it does is reduce dark hairs.  It&#39;s really a cosmetic technique, when electrolosis actually kills all hair follicles permanently.  No left-over villus hairs afterwards.
</p>
<p>
The idea that laser is adequate for bottom surgery is a common misconception, and I understand the appeal.  It&#39;s a cheaper, faster, supposedly &#34;just-as-good&#34; shortcut.  It&#39;s fine for legs and arms, yes.  Not so much for surgery prep.  It&#39;s a shame to see how many people are confused about this.

The reason people tend to have regrowth with laser isn&#39;t because it doesn&#39;t work, but because they only go for a few sessions and assume that&#39;s sufficient, when in reality it doesn&#39;t even take one entire growth cycle into account. When done over a longer period, to take both missed hairs and growth cycles into account, it&#39;s
<em>
incredibly
</em>
effective. I&#39;ve had lots of both electro and laser.

<p>
I&#39;m assuming you actually mean &#34;superficial&#34; because both of these are just as cosmetic as the other, although it&#39;s still incorrect. Once again, laser kills follicles too, as long as it&#39;s done properly. Bad electrologists can absolutely give bad results (include the risk of serious scarring and hair regrowth), so neither is free of potential problems. And obviously it doesn&#39;t work on lighter hair colors, but nobody was arguing otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Laser can save lots of time in the chair, but it&#39;s still a long-term investment in time (meaning a substantial number of sessions are still required for complete clearing, but each session is
<em>
way
</em>
faster than an electro session.)

The FDA Consumer Health Information Bulletin of 27 June 2007 states &#34;The US. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes electrology as providing permanent hair removal, The FDA identification in Title 21, CFR, Sec 878.5350 for needle-type epilators is: &#34;a device intended to remove the hair by destroying the dermal papilla of a hair&#34; As no other device for hair removal has the unique identification of &#34;destroying the dermal papilla of a hair&#34; only electrologists are allowed to claim permanent hair removal in their advertising

Laser will get rid of dark hair, but you will need electro for light hair. I am doing a combination of both, using laser to rapid fire kill a lot of dark hair and then have electro work through what was left.

It depends. Some don&#39;t even require laser hair removal because they cauterize the hair follicle during the surgery. Did he specify if he cauterizes the hair follicles during SRS? In that case laser hair removal wouldn&#39;t even be necessary. I went to Brassard who didn&#39;t require laser hair removal. I had minimal depth SRS so requirements may be different if you go for full depth SRS. Be sure to check with your surgeon.
