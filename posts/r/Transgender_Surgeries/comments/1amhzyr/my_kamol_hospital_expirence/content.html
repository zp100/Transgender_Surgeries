First of all I have seen that there is some discussion around Kamol hospital posts and I want to make sure that I don’t want to participate in any of these nor am I related to the hospital in any means.
</p>
<p>
I tried to post about it a few days before but since I’m new to Reddit it obviously didn’t work out either due to me or the discussion mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
So please feel free to reach out to me if there are any concerns about my integrity regarding this issue.
</p>
<p>
Hi there,
</p>
<p>
I want to share my experience about the Kamol hospital in Bangkok.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been there twice now. First time in June/July 2023 and January/February 2024.
</p>
<p>
All the following procedures have been successfully proceeded by Dr. Kamol. SRS colon, BA, FFS (bones only) on my first stay and FFS part two as well as some revisions.
</p>
<p>
I had no problems with complications in any means regarding any of theses surgeries.
</p>
<p>
I don’t like to speak about the outcome as a result since to I didn’t had a clear picture of it in my mind when I started. To me it’s more of a process to explore and experience myself on the way after surgery and to connect to the feeling inside.
</p>
<p>
So to me it all came down to trust and I experienced that it was well given into the hands of Dr.Kamol.
</p>
<p>
I followed his recommendations during the consultation and to me he appears very emphatic and aware if the situation as well as behaving highly professional at the same time and i haven’t regretted this approach at any time.
</p>
<p>
All the personal, at the hospital as well as the one at KGarden is incredibly friendly and professional.
</p>
<p>
The hospital itself operates at the highest standard given and the way everything is arranged by the agents is in a way that I could feel safe and secure during my whole stay.
</p>
<p>
So to me, taking a leap of faith coming here and trust Dr. Kamol and his stuff  made all the difference in my life.
</p>

I asked about Kamol a while ago and I was inundated by links and stories related to bad experiences. I will stay well away when I schedule my srs. Min Jun looks exceptionally good.

Why did you go to Kamol while the surgeons in Germany are covered by insurance? Also instead of Kamol (who is associated with major problems) surgeons like Markovsky or Morath have a great reputation.
</p>
<p>
Your whole story sounds super fishy to me if I’m honest. I don’t want to assume that you got payed to write this review but something definitely doesn’t add up here. Who on earth would write their full name in a review like this.

You are fully right about exposing myself at this point in life to everyone is and was a disgusting experience.
</p>
<p>
That’s why I decided to finally delete the comment.
</p>
<p>
Since I assume you might live in Germany as well you surely be aware of that there is a long discussion about how to reach out help to trans people while not treating them as mentally ill but on the other hand giving them access to medical health service and have the insurance pay for it. And you also might now that due to this there are a lot of trans people having a real hard time. So it was my decision to skip this discussion and to go for it myself by reaching out to medical institutions who offer a safe and legal way to help my medical transition while being in charge of it myself as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
Still it left me a bit worried since non of the things mentioned in other posts had occurred to me nor any other patient i have met there during my nearly  two and a half month of stay there. Of course that doesn‘t mean that it did not happen to anyone at anytime. In the end so many things can go wrong since it all remains a major surgery.  That’s all I can say about it.  I also don‘t get why people who recommend their own surgeon to others  ( hopefully because being satisfied with their work) while blaming others for doing the same and speak out against a place without probably ever been there in person.
</p>
<p>
All I wanted to say is that for me going there was the right decision at the right time.  Everything added up to a wonderful experience. I‘ve had 5 surgery’s there of which every single one of them went as planned.
</p>
<p>
The hotel was lovely, the hospital friendly and the stuff simply fun to be around.
</p>
<p>
Personally of course I owe Dr. Kamol more than I could ever give back. He made my dream reality and so everyday I‘m thankful for doing so. But I guess that most of the people who underwent SRS surgery would say this about their surgeon.
</p>
<p>
So I don’t see why I shoudn‘t end up saying that I would recommend this place since they exceeded my expectations.
</p>
<p>
With best regards, Tea Federspiel

To be honest, I find the results of German surgeons aks unsatisfactory.
</p>
<p>
I also went to Kamol and am really happy with the result.
</p>
<p>
However, I am detecting a certain amount of envy among some trans people from Germany towards those who can afford to go to Thailand.
</p>
<p>
This is expressed, for example, in the fact that you are &#34;rewarded&#34; with a large karma deduction if you write that you were in Thailand.
