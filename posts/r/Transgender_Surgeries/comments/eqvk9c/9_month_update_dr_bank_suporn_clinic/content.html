<div class="md">
<p>
I&#39;m now at the end of 9 months post-op with Dr. Bank at the Suporn Clinic.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I would rate the end result as positive, albeit with a very unfriendly recovery.  Currently, I have only returned to work part time (software dev) from home, as the dilation schedule is quite tiring.
</p>
<p>
Time to depth per dilation (TTD) is currently at about an hour with the M dilator (32mm), with the L dilator (34mm) being out of bounds as recommended by the clinic.  That said, I expect returning to the L eventually should be doable, as I did use it at one point.
</p>
<p>
Visually, I&#39;d say the neovagina looks fine.  There&#39;s some hair going into it, but that&#39;s to expected.  I suppose I&#39;ll get it electrolyzed at some point... which is a ouch proposition to think about.  I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any hair further in where it&#39;s not expected, but I guess I&#39;ll get it checked out at some point.
</p>
<p>
There are some things that could be improved by a a cosmetic revision, but I&#39;m not particularly eager about it at the moment, as I&#39;m still going through the recovery.  At earliest, I&#39;d go back for a checkup and possible revision at the end of the 18 months free revision period, although I believe the price of a revision outside the free period is about $2k USD, so the price is not an impediment.
</p>
<p>
Overall, if revision were somehow impossible, I&#39;d be fine with the result as I have it.  Sensitivity is 10/10.
</p>
<h4>
-- Timeline Summary --
</h4>
<p>
After the surgery, I had an initial depth of 14.5cm, which is ok.  For reference, I&#39;m 5&#39;5&#34; 120 pounds, so it&#39;s not like I was likely to have a ton of internal room for the neovagina, although I did have sufficient &#34;material&#34; for surgical usage.
</p>
<p>
Until about the end of 2 months post-op, TTD was pretty good - about 15 minutes on the M and 10 minutes for the L thereafter.  After that, it got rather awful.
</p>
<p>
At about the start of the 3rd month post-op, TTD went absolutely wild nearly overnight (over the course of 2 days), with the 3x dilation taking a total of 12-15 hours per day.  This was unsustainable, and eventually this was decreased to 2x per day slightly ahead of schedule.  TTD at this point was about 3-4 hours, which was bad but sustainable at 2x dilations per day.
</p>
<p>
During this period, pain levels were absolutely insane, and there was a LOT of bleeding (literally there would be a concerning pool of blood lol) during dilation, as I had granulation everywhere internally.  Pain levels were also insane.
</p>
<p>
For reference, I was off morphine and painkillers 2nd day post-op in the hospital (you&#39;re there for 7 days), when pain levels were similar to brushing up against a decently hot piece of metal (7/10 or 8/10), only you can&#39;t pull away.  I was ok with that and didn&#39;t need to use painkillers when I began dilation.
</p>
<p>
After my TTD exploded, pain became a 9/10 - to the point where my vision would start to black out from the corners while dilating due to the sheer excessiveness of the pain.  To offset that, I used 2x500mg acetaminophen and 2x50mg tramadol prior to each dilation.  Even so, my pain levels were approximately equal to the pain immediately post-op in the hospital without painkillers, just a bit below that - but manageable.
</p>
<p>
Also concerning was that for a couple months, maximum achievable depth more often than not dropped to about 13.5cm.  However, depth has since recovered back to 14.5cm, so it wasn&#39;t permanent.
</p>
<p>
At about the 7th month post-op, the clinic adivsed that I restart using betadine in the post-dilation douche, and that I stop using the L dilator.  That appears to have been successful, as it started a decrease in my TTD, to the point now where my TTD is 1 hour with the M and I have cut the tramadol out of my pre-dilation painkillers.
</p>
<h4>
-- Some Observations --
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Quality of life is rather improved by controlling what I eat.  Specifically, I eat a satisfying, healthy lunch (by delivery, to pipeline food prep with post-dilation douche and cleanup) and have a smaller, healthy, high fiber dinner so that I am &#34;emptied out&#34; by dilation time.
</li>
<li>
Dinners are typically 700-750 kcal, and a bit more than half that comes from a meal replacement drink (helps with lining up the bathroom time to be just before dilation in the morning).  I originally used Soylent RTD for the drink, but I&#39;ve since switched to Huel RTD becuase it felt better and seems healthy enough.  It tastes like cardboard, but it works for me so I just do it lol.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I&#39;ve habitually been intermittent fasting every day between dinner and lunch for the past few years, and conveniently it seems to work well for lining up the digestive cycle with dilation.  Dunno if that&#39;s ever a problem normally though - might not be a problem at all.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I believe people typically return to work on some level around the end of 3 months post-op, but that would&#39;ve been impossible for me.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Asians apparently have more difficult recoveries on average, or so I was told by both Dr. Bank and Dr. Suporn post-op.  But, your luck may vary.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I am unsure whether my recovery would have failed (in that I would have lost depth permanently) had I not persisted with reaching depth despite it taking 12-15 hours per day at its worst.  I might&#39;ve been quite close to what I would&#39;ve deemed a disappointing result, as I don&#39;t really have a ton of depth to spare.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Internal diagnostics claim cognitive performance is inhibited post-op, but that&#39;s to be expected with how much of a difficulty recovery has been.  I suspect further recovery along the cognitive lines as overall recovery progresses.
<br>
</li>
<li>
For me, the cost of the surgery is nothing compared to the cost of the recovery, in the sense of lost time and productivity.  Your experience may vary - most recoveries are better than mine, and some are worse.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I plan on gradually working my way back into an exercise routine starting Monday, as I finally feel like my body is probably ok with me doing that.  I plan on having another update in 3 months at the end of the 1st year post-op.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TLDR
</strong>
: Shit recovery, way worse than average.  Still worked out, though perhaps just barely.  Whew.  Sensitivity is 10/10, fuck yes!
</p>
<h4>
-- Addendum --
</h4>
<p>
By request, I would also like to mention that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I haven&#39;t socially transitioned yet, and feel no particular pressure to.
</li>
<li>
Getting a psych letter wasn&#39;t difficult, although I did see the same psych weekly for about 5 months.  I&#39;d say it was money well spent (since the surgery is irreversible), and I would not recommend going through with the surgery pre-social transition without a great deal of playing devil&#39;s advocate.
</li>
<li>
There were no issues at the Support Clinic with the fact that I was not socially transitioned.  Really, no difference at all in treatment and acceptance vs if I had been socially transitioned.  It was great.
</li>
</ul>

This is a great write up. Thanks for posting it.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s two points I think are particularly valuable.
</p>
<p>
We occasionally hear of some very difficult recoveries, and this shows that it is possible to get though them. I must admit I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d cope, but it is possible.
</p>
<p>
And thanks for posting about the not socially transitioning. I know a few people do it, but its not talked about much. Does anyone know you&#39;ve trans or had surgery?

All my friends know that I&#39;m trans and have had surgery.  I haven&#39;t bothered presenting publicly as female due to not looking the part, and so for me it&#39;s most convenient just to present as a guy.

Dunno at the moment.  Inertia leans towards not socially transitioning unless I stop passing as a guy.

This is really encouraging to me. My therapist&#39;s main concern with me going to the Suporn clinic is that I present male. I&#39;d love to be able to share your testimony with him.

I agree, and that&#39;s the conclusion I&#39;ve come to. I&#39;d just much rather have my therapist fully on board with some firsthand testimonies.

I did, actually. He said he read through it, and was still concerned about their potential treatment of me, given the way they talked about presenting female while in their care. From the email:
</p>
<p>
&#34;While living full time as a woman is not a mandatory requirement, it is preferred because we have found in the past that other clients we have feel uncomfortable at times with clients undergoing SRS who deliberately present as male. Simply for their own comfort and that of our other clients, we like all our clients to present as female while in our care, even if they do not wish to travel to and from Thailand as female, nor wish to continue to live at home as female,&#34;

All it means is you’ll just feel awkward if you present male while surrounded but others who have fully transitioned and are presenting female. I’ve not socially transitioned even though Ive been on hrt for a very long time. I’d feel very awkward in that situation and present female just to blend in, and I’m terrible at it. I’d also not want to take any chances with the psych eval there. The entire thing is difficult, but that’s life these days. How much do you want this particular surgeon and what are you prepared to do to get it?
</p>
<p>
Do you have some difficulty dealing with others? Why do you care what the therapist says?
</p>
<p>
I don’t think most transwomen care these days, especially younger ones.
</p>
<p>
I’m not clear on what you are doing. Are you non-binary? Why are you not socially transitioning?

<p>
I actually made sure to ask about presenting male in relation to the psych eval. They said that wasn&#39;t something that&#39;d be evaluated and that the people dismissed at that point of the process was negligible.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
The Suporn clinic and Dr Bank specifically are my first choice by a mile, and I&#39;m pretty much ready to do anything in my power to go there.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>

<p>
Not particularly, but being displaced so far from home in a potentially hostile environment is a scary thought to me. That said, OP&#39;s statements on the matter make me feel much more comfortable.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I guess because I trust him and he&#39;s been very helpful so far in this process. If I can convince someone skeptical of the choice, I guess it&#39;d make me feel more confident that my desire isn&#39;t clouding my judgement.

<p>
I&#39;ve been reticent to bring it up for fear of being shunned, called a fetishist, or otherwise questioned in my decision, but I don&#39;t identify as a woman. I&#39;ll sometimes call myself enby, but it doesn&#39;t really resonate with me. All I know for certain is that I&#39;ll never be my real self without a vagina.

<p>
I’ve got friends who are similar to you. The mainstream reddit trans subs have no issue with this kind of thing and people who disagree tend to be quiet or get banned. Rule 1 here covers that.
</p>
<p>
Sounds like you’re not on hrt? You’ll have to take testosterone afterwards if you don’t like estrogen.
</p>
<p>
I know for sure that there’s a lot more people like you around than is apparent, but they tend to keep very quiet, giving the illusion that it’s more rare than it actually is.
</p>
<p>
I think I heard of only one person who had difficulty with Suporn’s psych and that was because she could not communicate properly. Aspergers or something. But she got through it eventually. Sounds like you won’t have any problem.

Alright, thank you for the reassurance. I&#39;ve actually considered estrogen because of what I&#39;ve heard in regards to vaginal dryness and sexual experience, but the idea of growing breasts does bother me a little.

I&#39;m not sure, but I think you may be able to use vaginal estrogen without raising your blood levels too much. Dr Will Powers has talked about something related on the body. He&#39;s also talked about using testosterone cream vaginally post-op to improve the skin condition.

From the email:
</p>
<p>
&#34;While living full time as a woman is not a mandatory requirement, it is preferred because we have found in the past that other clients we have feel uncomfortable at times with clients undergoing SRS who deliberately present as male. Simply for their own comfort and that of our other clients, we like all our clients to present as female while in our care, even if they do not wish to travel to and from Thailand as female, nor wish to continue to live at home as female,&#34;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For anyone reading this thread in the future, I wanted to mention that Suporn Clinic appears to now require 1 year living full time presenting as female and be fully socially transitioned. For details, see this
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/17xi85z/im_very_disappointed_suporn_clinic_dr_banks/" rel="nofollow">post</a>
I made after finding this out in an email exchange with them.

Yea I&#39;m 100% male socially still, aside from my friends knowing what&#39;s up.  Still use 100% male pronouns, etc.  If your therapist has any particular questions, I can certainly answer them.

Wow I’m sorry about your experience. That sounds terrible.   I’m at 6 weeks post op and still live as male and will continue to do so.   I feel very fortunate that my experience was very easy.

Whoa! Did you see a local gynecologist at some point? You shouldn&#39;t just Suffer Through this! 8+/10 pain during recovery isn&#39;t an acceptable outcome, even temporarily - if this happens, See Someone

Yes, and that&#39;s where I was told I had extensive granulation everywhere, although they weren&#39;t able to get more than 6cm in.  Even getting an exam (using the proper instruments, as recommended by the clinic) triggered a good bit of bleeding from the granulation xD.
</p>
<p>
But, currently the bleeding is very low level if present, and usually is not present anymore.  Maybe I&#39;m not wide enough for the L dilator after the healing started accelerating?  Shrug.
