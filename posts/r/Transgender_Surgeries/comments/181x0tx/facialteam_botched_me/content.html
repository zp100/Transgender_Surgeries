I looked at your pics on here and on your profile.. I definitely see it and I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through this.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t understand the people who say this is normal or that you need a psychologist.
</p>
<p>
There has to be a facial transition between the nose and forehead, nobody&#39;s face is just one long continuous slope, and they did a terrible job with your nose.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t really care what the explanation is for their Rhinoplasty technique. Rhinoplasties have been done for almost a century on both men and women in ways that are identical. Why would there be a need for this &#34;new technique&#34;  for trans women specifically that obviously creates subpar results in comparison to other surgeons.
</p>
<p>
The goal is to feminize the nose, not smooth it out into oblivion.
</p>
<p>
It just doesn&#39;t look like they handled your face with care and consideration. I hope you get the results you want one day, and you are definitely justified in feeling angry about this.

I‚Äôve never been impressed with FT‚Äôs results.  It appears to me that you did not need a type 3 to begin with.  A mild type one would have been enough. Or even some filler for that matter.  You are definitely someone who has had poor results.  At least it has healed.  A revision will probably require someone who is good with bone paste.  Sorry this happened to you.üôè

NVDD was my surgeon in 2012, he said the aim is to make you pass to the postman when you answer the door in the morning to with out makeup, I suffer from a bit of BDD and and after I just couldn&#39;t see it, yet the actual real world results back up his claim, guy is good at his job.

I once had an in-person consultation with them. I wasn&#39;t impressed. I needed to do my chin and jaw because they were square but they did not want to touch my face, so i moved on and did not press the matter. It was a giant waste of time. I also did not like their rhinoplasties, they seemed very odd and imprecise.
</p>
<p>
I see what you mean about the forehead and the transition to the nose, it&#39;s a bit flat. I&#39;m not sure why you have a bit of sagging in the neck area since you did not have a mandible reduction; it&#39;s perplexing. From the profile view the chin seems a bit recessed and a tad flat. As for the nose, the bones need to be broken and brought in to narrow the &#34;open roof deformity&#34;.
</p>
<p>
From what you&#39;re saying, the way they addressed the situation is not good at all, very unprofessional and without empathy.
</p>
<p>
Edit: in looking at your before pictures, I think the neck sagging is coming from the chin reduction/contour + the Adam&#39;s apple shave.
</p>
<p>
Edit2: do you have before and after CT-scans ?

Like I said this is likely an open roof deformity and isn&#39;t supposed to happen with experienced rhinoplasty surgeons. They should&#39;ve also made that observation in the post-op consultation. The good news is that this is relatively an easy fix.

In 2011 I had a consultation with them in London, something just seemed off,  I went to NVDD who some accuse of not being surgically aggressive enough, I disagree, he knows just how to subtlety shift facial features the other way plus he is a really nice guy, I went twice, once for bone work and once that had settled went back for a mini facelift and eyelids and a few other bits and bobs. I had a twang occur in my forehead and called him up from the UK, he told me exactly what it was (a temporary stitch snapping as normal) and put my mind at rest, all turned out fine.

NVDD is awesome. He&#39;s such a nice guy and seems to genuinely care. He&#39;s so careful. I really like his approach.

Yes, and he must be in his 80&#39;s now, don&#39;t know he keeps going, I think he was 75 when he did me. Dr Bert is alright too, my bf had a few jelly tots on his face he wanted sorted, we called them up and had a weekender in Belgium and Dr Bert got him sorted in the evening after he&#39;d been doing boob jobs all day.

Hello, yes. I had my ffs with Dr. Noorman Van der Dussen, mostly bone work; I personally think he&#39;s very good and very personal, a good listener and very precise. I will be doing soft tissue work with Dr. Pagnoni in Rome (SMAS) very soon.

Mostly differences in dates and scheduling. Both doctors are equally good. I decided with Dr. P on this one because he was available and could accommodate me sooner.

Love the downvotes for telling the truth. I was a Facialteam patient. I was in Marbella for just under 3 weeks and many of us shared our pre/post CT scans. In all the rhinoplasty cases I saw where a dorsal hump or wide bridge (i had both) was feminised the nose bone was dissected and reset.

Yes. I had forehead reconstruction, orbital shave, rhinoplasty, upper blepharoplasty, lip lift, trachea shave, platysmaplasty, sliding genioplasty and hair transplant. My CT scan clearly shows the nose having been broken into 5 pieces and reset.

They charged me for two nights in hospital, which is the correct amount for the procedures I had and the same for others having the same done, but discharged me after just one. When I brought it up they told me two things. Everyone else who was staying for two nights was a mistake and they should have only stayed for one like me.  That the difference in price  between one and two nights is 100 euro, take it or leave it. The original charge was around 3500.
</p>
<p>
So they lied about how long I should have stayed and then lied about the cost. To me the mark of professionalism is how you handle things when they go wrong. Own it and correct it. They did the very opposite.

Hi, I went to FT 3 years or so ago.
</p>
<p>
I was/am unhappy with many elements of what happened. I found it crazy that all I ever saw was glowing gold standard reviews wherever I looked as that was far from my experience.

My nose is pretty awful, silly pointy barbie nose and collapsed to one side, trachea scar extremely prominant, orbitals insufficiently reduced, hair transplants super thin. What upsets me the most is my jaw is totally lumpy and has a big dent in one side of it, it&#39;s extremely asymettric and I pretty much find seeing myself in photos or a videofeed traumatising.
</p>
<p>
They fobbed me off completely and their psychologist made an excuuse and dipped from our one session.
</p>
<p>
It would be laugable if it wasn&#39;t so traumatising and life impacting. I still sometimes imagine their cheesy self assured smiles as they talked shit at me, and the surgeons response when they took the bandage off to have a look. &#34;Oh well it&#39;ll get better in time&#34; basically.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve moved on with my life and can&#39;t afford to get a bunch more fixes done but I often wonder how I&#39;d feel if I went somewhere else and wish I had.

I had a consult with them a few years ago and they made me feel really uncomfortable. Like, I‚Äôm older and I‚Äôm not the cute passable type so they treated me like I was a waste of their time. Then they sent me a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù estimate on how much it would cost and I had X days to pay them or that cost wouldn‚Äôt be guaranteed. It felt like they were trying to pressure me, like a used car dealership. No thanks.

I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you. I hope you can get a rhino revision in the future.. the rest seems upsetting and not what you paid for but still liveable. In the US business world we&#39;re constantly reminded of the amazing consumer protections in the EU as an impediment to how we can do business at parity globally, but these cases always make me second guess those notions.

Feels a little refreshing to hear some more diversity in opinion about facialteam practices here. They have incredible marketing but a lot of the botch jobs seemingly disappear from forums or fail to be heard about. My surgeon I‚Äôve ended up going with has done numerous revisions on FT clients. I consulted with them and they seemed nice but upon detailed research I chose to go elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
edit: OP it sounds like you‚Äôre planing on revisions and I hope you can get what you need. While it looks a lil funny and is not an acceptable surgery result, my personal opinion is you still look very feminine and pretty.

I&#39;m so sorry to hear how they have mistreated you. While it&#39;s not to the same extent as you, I have had issues with their results too. The left half of my jaw is mostly numb, but some days it gets worse which means I never get used to it and it hasn&#39;t got any better in almost 2 years. I also experienced hair loss that hasn&#39;t recovered like they said it would. And my incision for my trachea shave is extremely visible, when they said it would be completely hidden.
</p>
<p>
We all deserve better.

OMG I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you.. You can get revision thru reputable surgeon to correct I&#39;m sure. And sue facial team if possible! üò°

I know is already too late for OP, and I‚Äôm really sorry, yet I know u will get the revision u deserve. Just don‚Äôt let facial team near you ever again.
</p>
<p>
Aside that, I would like to gime some advice :c
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm from Facial Team home country, Spain, and we know the deal around here‚Ä¶ u don‚Äôt get that expensive/ extremely skilled surgeries here. You just don‚Äôt. If u value ur life, ofc. (Or if u have *enough money, and the right connections, which is pretty isolated)
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs always exceptions, and if u are in a rough spot, we always have Social Security, yet‚Ä¶ it is just that. Free.
</p>
<p>
The majority of the time, the procedures and results are abysmal, there is no names, u don‚Äôt have anyone at charge that u know, and there‚Äôs anyone for u to blame in case something goes wrong, only the state.
</p>
<p>
We know to never go to hospitals with any possession, because they will always be stolen.
</p>
<p>
We know to always bring someone with us if have to go to a medical institution, because nearly always you will be mocked and mistreated.
</p>
<p>
If someone here wants to really get out of a difficult illness (aka cancer ie), we know our chances here are really lower, but yeah, it‚Äôs (free) (tldr: it‚Äôs not, taxes here are ridiculous, and if u are freelance u have to pay up to 60% of ur income in taxes)
</p>
<p>
FacialTeam has really bad reputation around here, and only those unaware enough would be willing to assist its clinic.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm sorry, but please, this situation is going nuts, and ppl should know that Spain is no place for such surgeries, if it is through the national healthcare, they are intangible, if they are not, they are just protected from the very roots of our legal system (although if u are rich maybe u have some chance after‚Ä¶.years)
</p>
<p>
There are good professionals too, ofc, but do not count on having that luck when u are risking that much, please. Not when they are not even cheap, they are up there with DB or Jumaly.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm sorry OP, and I hope u get the solution u deserve.

As someone who moved to Spain a while ago and had surgery at FT, wow.. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re lying about everything this much, but I feel like I should point that out.
</p>
<p>
I won&#39;t speak on current day FT quality, my experience with them was good, but that was a long time ago, and things may have changed. The only other thing from what you wrote that I can&#39;t speak on is cancer treatments here, as for pretty much everything else you wrote, you&#39;re just lying. Even easily verifiable stuff - like no, freelancers don&#39;t pay 60% taxes ever.

If I am honest, the answer would be‚Ä¶ not in Spain.

Maybe in some really local groups there are locals surgeons talked, but in truth‚Ä¶ no one really comes up here as a common ground like others abroad :/

There is a difference between botched and poor results. It seems you had a bad job, but it&#39;s not so that you&#39;re disfigured and have functional issues. Are you considering revision?

When you said botched I expected it to look a lot worse.

Tbh I&#39;ve been aware that there are other people like DR. Mfo who seem much better ever since I did my first web search.

Was it a cheaper option?

I can&#39;t comment on the rest but I don&#39;t think the tracheal shave is bad at all, and I would caution you against trying to mess with it further. Everyone will end up with a small bump if you are holding your neck up like that (even cis women have this, and definitely fully passing trans women with trach shaves) - if you try to make it smaller you are really risking damaging your vocal cords, which will affect your life
<strong>
really
</strong>
significantly.
</p>
<p>
If you can&#39;t see a bump while your head is at a normal angle, that is The Goal, anything more than that is really really risky. I honestly think people should only go to VFS surgeons for trach shaves because the consequences of having them go wrong can be really bad

Sister I think you should talk this through with a good psychologist, many people go through difficulty with their mental health after FFS. Please be very gentle with yourself and take care of yourself. You are very beautiful. If you have a doctor that can refer you for scans of your bone structure, that might help you see exactly what could be the issue and needs to be fixed.

Surgery is always a crap shot and you have to know that before deciding to have the surgery.  There is no guarantee that the surgery will make anyone look better and sometimes it makes people look dramatically worse and it happens even with the best surgeons.  Don&#39;t have surgery unless you are willing to accept the risks, often it turns out great, sometimes little change, and other times, not very often but not rare, much worse.

Any credible plastic surgeon will tell you there is no guarantee of a favorable result.  All surgeries have attendant risks and in plastic surgery there is always the possibility the patient will not consider the result favorable and the surgery may be a failure.  That is not to say some surgeons aren&#39;t better than others and some are incompetent.  I was going to have surgery on my trigger finger and that is what my hand surgeon told me and that is one of the easiest surgeries there is with very favorable outcomes.

I am not seeing anything ‚Äúbotched‚Äù here. Your profile looks very feminine. Any minor asymmetry is normal to find in any face.

Then, this raises the question: who is the best surgeon that has a good track record? Seems like there aren‚Äôt any from what I can gather here.
</p>
<p>
Also, reddit is known to be a cesspool that seems to attract a lot of negative reviews (&lt;1-2% ‚Äúers‚Äù) in stark contrast to the actual amount of surgeries being done having positive reviews (&gt;98% ‚Äúers‚Äù).
</p>
<p>
All in all, there needs to be more concrete evidence to substantiate your claim. Perhaps other people can attest this. Discouraging others to get the surgeries can just be as harmful and, if not, misleading and affect peoples‚Äô decision-making contemplations.
</p>
<p>
That being said, you look very feminine already. Hope you get the help you need to feel content.

DB is the best facial feminization surgeon in the world. His worst works are better than most of FTs best, for the same price. Facial Team is a rip off, they are making you pay for a brand(but their brand is low quality).
