Omg.. that sounds terrible. I had a great experience there. Other than almost dying during surgery. My results and care were excellent.
</p>
<p>
However.. I was worried about one of the other girls.. they were being mean to her. She was Asian.. and I’m afraid they were mistreating her  because of it. Everyone else was white. And I was the only Latina. The girl was having all these complications and no one cared… but they treated me so well, and I couldn’t see any other reason why they mistreated her. She was terrified. I tried consoling her. But I was so high off drugs. I remember they shot me up with morphine more than once because I had to go in for a second surgery.  So my experience the entire time was pain free.. and I was like floating. I kept popping pills when I got home, so I felt minimal pain.
</p>
<p>
But back to the girl. It really bothered me. I came out of surgery before her and… I also left before she did. I was so worried. I was 21 at the time. She was younger than me. I hope she turned out ok, that gave me bad vibes about them..
</p>
<p>
But Dr. Brassard himself is amazing. He is such a sweetheart. I ended up going back a year later. Or 6 months later, because I had a little issue with my clit having like a skin tag. Or a little stitch that never came out. It kept poking me. They also closed my hood, and made it tighter because it didn’t heal properly while at home. And he was amazing. The nurses, were bitchy and rude. I didn’t have to stay overnight or anything for that surgery’s they just sent me off. Even tho I went under.

The nurses are by and large the worst part of the facility. Not getting a proper meeting with brassard beforehand is understandable, albeit a tad annoying, but every other issue I had there stemmed from the nurses in convalescence being shitty and ignoring me.
</p>
<p>
I’m pretty sure it wasn’t a race thing, because that’s 100% how they treated me as well in May and I’m as white as it gets.

I dislike the fact you went through that with the nurses, but I also feel better knowing it wasn’t a race thing. There was a nice lady named Florence, she was in charge of the food. What year did you get your surgery? I had mine done in 2017

Mine was may of 2022, a couple weeks before this post. The nurses are horrid there and I&#39;m so glad I&#39;ll never have to go back. Unfortunately I&#39;ll need to get a revision surgery at some point for a few reasons, but hey, hopefully those nurses aren&#39;t so shit.

I want to go back for a labia reduction. I really like Dr. Brassard. I asked him to give me large labia and he delivered, but now I want to get it revised and I don’t trust any other doctors. When I got my clitoris corrected due to a minor issue, I paid for the anesthesias, however this would be purely cosmetic.. if I move forward I’ll update on here

Hi there! Finally figuring out how Reddit works and seeing the reply. Till this day I’m not exactly sure what happened other than as soon as I woke up from surgery and opened my eyes, they told me I had a beautiful turn out but that I wouldn’t stop bleeding and they were going to shoot me with morphine because I was loosing a-lot of bleed and need a transfusion.. then I woke up at the convalescence center and no one brought it up.. I tried asking questions.. but it’s all a blur. They just kept telling me I was ok and gave me iron pills.. but I do feel I received extra care because of it, so that was nice?? But yeah it was scary..

In my experience most nurses are like that, especially night staff. Overworked and unhappy.

In general I’d agree, but some of these nurses were especially bad.
</p>
<p>
I had to unblock my own catheter twice and stayed up until 4am making sure it drained properly three nights in a row. It took an entire day (9am-7pm or so) of them condescendingly telling me to drink more water while in massive pain for them to finally switch to a different catheter end... only to find the hose they gave me was faulty. I eventually ended up drinking about 5 pitchers of water in the span of a couple hours before they were satisfied enough to try anything.
</p>
<p>
It’s more than just being overworked, it’s actively not listening to and ignoring the needs of a patient. Generally speaking the nurses were just vibing behind the nurses station. The head nurse was the only one who even really left it.

I agree with your experience about not having much time to chat with Brassard or the Anesthesiologist beforehand. Honestly though, if you read the booklets they tell you to read, it&#39;s quite clear that PPT is not something they offer.
</p>
<p>
Can&#39;t say I had any problems with the nurses though. But I was an easy patient. For PT I just did a lot of laps around the two floors. The topic of PT never even came up with the nurses, probably because they could see me walking around all the time.
</p>
<p>
Sucks that your catheter went poorly. Mine went fine but was still the most unpleasant part of the experience. Getting it out was when I finally felt human again.

I never said they offered PPT. I just wish I’d started with it instead of PIV and gone somewhere else.

Weird, when I went in 2019 the staff was amazing.  There was 1 real hard ass nurse where everything had to be done her way but everyone else was top notch.  No complaints from me.  I feel like Covid really messed with a lot of health care systems.
