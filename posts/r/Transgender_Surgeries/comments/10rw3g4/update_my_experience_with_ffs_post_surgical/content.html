thanks to much, still a long way to go but I am happy with it! I wish i had a secret to share, but as

mentioned this was all very much related to surgical stress and I had pretty thick hair prior to surgery (whether TE, pressure alopecia, or something else is anyones guess). Overall I think the parts that are regrowing are around 3ish inches, not sure if thats normal or not, but I was just super scared nothing would come back haha.

My endo had written a prescription for minoxidil, I think just to ease my stress about it, but I never ended up using it at all because it just felt like way more of a dice roll than it would probably be worth since it&#39;s mainly for AGA. Outside of time I just did some exercise and daily vitamin. I was taking a b+biotin vitamin as well but stopped after a few weeks because it was making me break out and I am sure I was already exceeding my absorbable amount with the daily.
