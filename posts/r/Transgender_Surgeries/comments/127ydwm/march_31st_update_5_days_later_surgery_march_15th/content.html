Honestly, this is more healed than you think. The way the dehiscence is, it doesn&#39;t seem to be pulling the incisions asymmetrical. Healing by 2nd Intention, is no fun and it does extend the recovery time, but this looks like it should come together pretty well in the end.

I&#39;m not upset in the slightest of worrying if there will be cosmetic stuff if the scar is bigger the scar is bigger and scars do fade over time and can be helped,b it&#39;s healed tremendously from 5 days ago alone. And it&#39;s only been 5. The surgeon said would take about 30-60 major days of healing so Im just letting it&#39;s do its job.
</p>
<p>
I agree that if given the proper time to heal and taken care of properly it should heal great.

My previous post. Instead of remaking it might be easier to see I will try to learn to catalog them for future posts.

I agree with the other poster in that it might be worth getting checked out for a connective tissue disorder. I’m no doctor, but I’ve never seen anybody have this level of separation just from sitting on a plane more than a week later. Do you have any of the other symptoms like super stretchy skin or easy bruising? Super sorry this happened to you and I hope they can fix it all up!

Oddly I actually have like the reverse my body skin does not really bruise at all it takes an extreme amount this surgery was the first i have ever bruised like this. My skin is not super stretchy I know of the beighton test.
</p>
<p>
I played sports and I have clicky joints that pop. I just learnt to not treat my body like average and train much slower  Both joints and muscle and stopped lifting weights doing more body work.
</p>
<p>
It is what it is. Today has been much better compared to a week ago. In a week today will be nothing, mind over matter and it will get better.
