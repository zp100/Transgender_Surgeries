For some reason I’ve come out of surgery with plenty of depth 6 1/2+” and I’m having no real problem maintaining that. My problem is that I’m using a Soul Source purple at what appears to be about 1 1/8” diameter and I’m finally after 6 days just starting to get used to having it in for a half hour x3.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow I’m supposed to start 15 min x4 on the purple and 15 min x4 on the blue at 1 1/4”.  I’ve tried it a couple of times and it feels very painful. 15 minutes 4 times a day sounds excruciating to me.
</p>
<p>
The problem is the dilator is squeezing my tissue between the dilator and the pubic bone and at 1 1/4” it really hurts.
</p>
<p>
I learned with the purple one that removing it and adding lube and reinserting it tends to make things much better.
</p>
<p>
My question is, will the blue one get better too?  Has anyone else had this issue?  I really want to be diligent about dilating but a lifetime of this pain sounds discouraging.
</p>
<p>
If it makes a difference, I’m gay so there are no penises in my future, only fingers and toys.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for any help. I really do mean for this to work and if it means terrible pain then it does; but I’d rather it didn’t.

You are 2 weeks in, things are still swollen and its going to be uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
Are you being sure to insert your dilator straight in? Not &#34;curving&#34; it in to make it more comfortable?
</p>
<p>
Lube the shit out of it! Get half in, and lube it up some more, don&#39;t be stingy early on, later you can use next to none, but now make sure that thing is slick, also if you are still having issues, try a lube injector, works wonders early on.
</p>
<p>
As far as moving up sizes, I found it easier to dilate with a smaller size for a couple minutes first to get everything all lubed up and loose, then move to the larger one.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t worry it will get better and before you know it you will be down to a time or two a week and forgetting to do it, hang in there!

Also be sure to rotate your dilator a quarter turn back and forth!

I had the same problem. It took months to actually get to the blue, like 7 or 8 months. It was really painful to increase the width and the pubic bone is what limited me from being able to do orange. Depth was no problem for me either.
</p>
<p>
It was hard for me to be diligent on 3x a day for 50 minutes each. It cost me but the pain was really bad trying to get comfortably to the blue. I would be sore after and the next session would be worse, then i ended up skipping days.
</p>
<p>
After a year when i actually was able to put in the time again i can now start with the blue and then go to the green. I know it would be easier at this point if i was able to commit sooner, so my advice is to really try to push through it.
</p>
<p>
Switching to coconut oil was a game changer for me too

When I upgraded size, three weeks later, it was REALLY hard at first. I’d sweat. It was tight and sore. There was still discharge.
</p>
<p>
Now, 4 months on? Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Keep at it, and it will absolutely be worth it. It gets better never rang so true.

Well good this is what I’m hoping. I can abide the pain if I have a feeling there’s a goal, and that the pain of the blue one will become less over time. Thank you.

This is more of an issue with a lack of lubrication. I would suggest finding a &#34;lube launcher&#34; and squirting in some lube

before

you put the dilator in. They&#39;re just big, blunt, rounded syringes designed to get lube inside you, and they can be found on Amazon for a few bucks. Most adult/porn shops carry them too. It helps quite a bit.

Check with your surgeon if it&#39;s a suggested schedule or they want you to adhere to it.  My doctor said to process as I felt comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Moving up is always difficult.  When I do it I try to just apply constant light pressure and just watch something on tv or my phone.  As long as I hit full time with the smaller size, I don&#39;t worry about the depth of the larger at first.

Wait, am I missing something? You&#39;re on the blue one 12 days after surgery? That seems super early to me, usually people take weeks or months to get to that size. I&#39;m confused as to why you&#39;re going so wide so early. I think you should be increasing width at a much slower pace; that way it should be easier.

What do you mean by ok?  Ok for fingers?

<p>
For anyone who is looking for penetrative sex with a penis or standard toy, purple won&#39;t cut it regardless of depth.
