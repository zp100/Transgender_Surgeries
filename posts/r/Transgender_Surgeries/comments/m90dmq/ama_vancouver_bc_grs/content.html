Hey all. I made a separate account for this as due to my experience I don’t really want people to know who I am as it’s been a rough few weeks. I had PI Vaginoplasty performed by Dr Genoway and Dr Kavanagh at the beginning of March. I think I’m like the second or third patient that they’ve done this procedure on excluding revisions. The program is quite new so I’m hoping to help those looking to go this route. I did have mild complications at no fault of the surgeons or really anyone, so tomorrow I finally go home after two weeks in the hospital. Feel free to ask me anything, not sure about if I’ll post photos as I’m pretty sure I gave them permission to use them formally already so they should be available soon to potential patients. I should also note both surgeons are amazing people who radiate kindness for individual patients but also the whole community.
</p>
<p>
PS I’m posting this before bed I promise I will respond tomorrow!

I see the surgeons Friday and would like to make sure they’re okay with me sharing it first. Obviously it’s my choice but I don’t know if they’d prefer to professionally put photos on a website or something and they’ve done a lot for me so I don’t want to be rude! I’ll update the post if I decide to share them myself!

So I was already on the Montreal waiting list and had been for 3 years but never got a date that felt right so I was like pretty much right at the top when they started moving people over to Vancouver. The program had a few road bumps starting up. I’ve heard from someone I know that they were recently quoted 12 months for the waitlist but I can’t say if that’s accurate for sure. I was given dates to choose from end of September 2020 ish and chose March for what for my schedule best! Also the surgeons require you have electrolysis in the necessary surgical site before you can have the procedure and that’s about a 6-12 months to completion depending on the person!

Thanks!! I&#39;m asking because I&#39;ve been on the waitlist for almost exactly a full year and haven&#39;t heard anything yet. If I can ask a few more questions just to sate my curiosity:
</p>
<p>
Did you get any control over aesthetic? Rather, what kind of questions did they ask in terms of your expectations vs. feasible outcomes?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also been told they offer the peritoneal method- was this presented as an option to you, and if so, what made you weigh PI over PPT?
</p>

Hmm you could always call trans care and just ask for an update! If you’re done hair removal make sure they know that too!
</p>
<p>
They were very open about what they could achieve based on my anatomy and definitely asked what I was expecting for results. I cared the most about aesthetics and less about depth but they were able to give me cis looking results and 7” of depth based on my skin. Unfortunately my grafts weren’t cooperating so my depth has probably gone down a bit but I told them I would be more than happy with like 4” anyhow. I can tell you one thing for sure and that’s how much they care that you’re happy and healthy so I know they would do their absolute best for each patient even if it means more work for them. My surgery was 10 hours, they are very meticulous.
</p>
<p>
The peritoneal was mentioned but I believe they prefer to do PI unless you don’t have the anatomy ie; not enough skin etc. I guess for me the possibility of self lubrication couldn’t matter less to me and that seems to be the main reason people go for peritoneal. You can definitely bring it up, but honestly I would trust what they think is best for you in the end as they’ve 100% proven to me they can be trusted. They could have easily fixed the minor complication I had and sent me home the next day but they kept me for 6 days and followed up every day to make sure things stayed perfect so my results wouldn’t suffer!
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps :) you can dm me if you think of anything else!

Honestly I&#39;m just waiting til my next trans care appointment to bring it up if I don&#39;t get a call.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m basically dead set on peritoneal but we&#39;ll see how things go, and I&#39;m glad they gave good aesthetic.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for answering my questions though! Honestly
<em>
very

reassuring to hear all that.

They will probably never come back :/
</p>
<p>
Its so fucking aggravating there STILL aren&#39;t any results photos from GRS Vancouver after 3 years! Like I don&#39;t know how people are so comfortable going under for surgery with no clue wtf the results will look like.
</p>
<p>
And for some reason the few people who have said they would post results disappear like the OP here after saying they will post pictures. I&#39;m just at a loss.
