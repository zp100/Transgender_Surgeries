I am 12 days post op with Chett. My results in terms of aesthetics, sensation, pain and depth are all fantastic (will post pics in a few weeks), but I&#39;ve noticed that where the skin has been stitched together along the labia minora it has started to split and peel off in a way that looks pretty worrying.
</p>
<p>
I have my follow up with Chett soon, but he and his nurses have a habit of always saying that everything is normal... and I am sure it is in the sense that they&#39;ve seen everything before, but I&#39;d still like to know what&#39;s going on and why.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s granulation tissue and it doesn&#39;t really hurt, but it also definitely doesn&#39;t look right. Would appreciate if anyone can shed some light!

For anyone coming across this in the future Chett said “it’s normal” without further elaboration (as I expected!) but then I managed to get some more detail from one of the nurses. Apparently when you have swelling the fluid can leak out or collect around where the stitches are which can then cause the skin in that area to peel. As soon as the swelling goes down it will get better.

Yeah it looks like wound separation and granulation (granulation is different from hyper granulation). It’s very common.

Also go easy on spreading your labia for a few months. Avoid any unessecerry stress on healing grafts and stitches. Chett. Is pretty specific about that.. definetly talk to Sre or the other nurses when they come for your next visit.
