You have the right to know about your treatment, so ask them what exactly is going on now and what they expect to happen next.

Try to ask surgeon his treatment plan and timeline.  If this is a rare complication , he may not be sure and asking other surgeons about your case. I wish you all the best. Charlie

It will get better; it takes time. Embrace the moment and focus on healing this is what I did after my bottom surgery.

You will get there. I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re having a hard time, but it won&#39;t be like this forever. And seconding that you should talk to your surgeon and ask them what their plan is.

I don‚Äôt know if you are doing sitz baths. I had ugly stuff like that and they told me to leave it alone. Bits of ugly eventually started falling off in the shower or in the sitz bath. I don‚Äôt know if you have the same stuff
</p>
<p>
I was still a bit of a basket case for a while after surgery, very worried, very swollen, pain. If possible, you might try to walk a bit several times each day if your medical support people say it‚Äôs ok. I think that helped me. Went and looked outside. Seemed to help me.
</p>
<p>
I hope you can find relief from your distress. I don‚Äôt believe in prayer or healing energy and stuff like that. However I am sending an eHug.

The problem it&#39;s that they put me again in an hospital. When I was at home everything was fine... I toke walks everyday and sit and play with friends, sleeping well and everything. But now that I&#39;m in the hospital I feel sick, I feel pain, I can&#39;t even move because the catheter it&#39;s connected to a big bag and that makes me feel pain. The good thing is that the necrosis will fell off and I will no need surgery. At least till 19th September that I&#39;m gonna see the surgeon who did the surgery. Today I get discharged from the hospital and get back at home again with just the little catheter.

The necrosis is felling off by himself so the surgeon told me just to clean that part 2 times a day very well and things will go nice. Because he said it happened to a lot of his patients and at the end it felt off alone.

Don‚Äôt worry, it takes some pain before the pleasure.

Soon you‚Äôll be looking back a year later slipping on that bikini you always wanted, and looking down happy you no longer need to tuck.
