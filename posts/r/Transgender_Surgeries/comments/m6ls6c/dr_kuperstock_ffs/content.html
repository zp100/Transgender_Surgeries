I just had my FFS with Dr.Kuperstock yesterday! He has assistants, but zero students so you can rest assured that his hands will be the only ones making any modifications to your face. Assistants might hold back skin or pass him tools, but that‚Äôs it.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been happy with his bedside manner and the vision he saw of my face matched what I wanted as well. I let him describe what he saw as recommendations before I told him what I wanted.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve also been chatting with another girl that is having her surgery on Friday. I paid cash for the procedure and was able to get a slot 7 weeks after our initial consult. He did have a 6-week opening, but the timing wasn‚Äôt going to work for me. Other patients might be booking 3-6 months out of I remember correctly.
</p>
<p>
OP, feel free to DM me if you want to see any photos. I had type-3 with orbital contouring through a coronal incision, medium cheek implant, open rhinoplasty, and lateral mandible contouring.

Here is a video I made at 6 months. I feel like it tells a better ‚Äúreal world‚Äù example of the results by that point. My jaw and nose have both come down a bit since then as well.

You can also look at my post history here to see some stills, or check out my Twitter account under the same handle name! I‚Äôm not super active these days so I don‚Äôt have a ton of examples.

I haven&#39;t had FFS with him yet but am scheduled soon.  He&#39;s been great to deal with so far.  Super responsive and patient...  My wait time was a few months, depends on your flexibility it seems.  Definitely do a consult if you&#39;re considering!
</p>
<p>
FYI, his office is 703-383-7340.

Thank you so much and best of luck with your procedure! &lt;3 are you planning on posting results afterwards perhaps? What do you have planned to do?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for the phone number! The person who called me back accidentally gave me the wrong one üòÖ

I&#39;m having a lot.  Scalp advancement, forehead contouring, rhinoplasty, cheek implants, and chin contouring.  Not sure I&#39;ll do photos or not.  Just had a pre-surgery physical, actually.  Kuperstock requires an EKG and bloodwork to make sure you&#39;re good for surgery.
</p>
<p>
No problem on the number.  I ended up calling their main office the first time and it was a bit awkward to find the plastic surgery center&#39;s direct number.  ;-)
</p>
<p>
Good luck with the consult.  Hope things go well with whoever you choose!

I went to Kupe and have a pretty highly rated before and after post here. I&#39;m 5 months now and my results just keep getting better and better. I found him EXTREMELY great to deal with, and he went to bat for me on getting it approved through insurance.

I‚Äôm also thinking about going to him, I haven‚Äôt had a consultation yet but I‚Äôve heard good things about him and he‚Äôs not far from where I‚Äôm located. Would love to see more before&amp;after‚Äôs of his work but they‚Äôre hard to find!

I have surgery with him in 2 weeks. From consult to surgery for me was 4 months but I&#39;m going through insurance and wanted to give plenty of time for approval.  I could have scheduled as soon as 4-6weeks if I was self paying.
