Does anybody have any updated reviews on Dr.Kathy Rumer? I have SRS &amp; breast augmentation booked with her soon and after seeing quite a few negative reviews I‚Äôm thinking about reconsidering. I would like to follow through with Rumer because I almost feel like it‚Äôs now or never but then again I don‚Äôt want to go to her if I‚Äôm going to be unsatisfied with the results. PLEASE HELP. (PS. if it matters everything counts to me. I not only want it to look aesthetically pleasing but I also want everything to feel &amp; functional like a normal vagina not just for me but for my partner as well)

Would you say this is due to poor aftercare maintenance on the patient‚Äôs behalf or Dr.Rumer is at fault?

It&#39;s pretty obvious from all the anecdotal evidence that she is neither caring nor competent. My friend used her, she was butchered by her and then refused to fix her issues. This is first hand information to me.

From firsthand experience *as an actual patient*, RUN FAR AWAY. Go to a competent surgeon instead.

The rumor is everything is ALWAYS the patients fault no matter what with her...  If you want to at least consider someone else in the same region, check out McGinn.

So you have options but are going out of your way to choose a controversial surgeon? Strange.

No I chose her because of my health insurance &amp; current financial state. I‚Äôm limited and She happens to be one of the few that does take my insurance. By all means if you know of more surgeons that accept insurance in places that are cost friendly then point me in the direction. There‚Äôs no need to surgeon shame me because of my situation. We all know how hard enough it is to transition let alone the ungodly costs so that‚Äôs why I came here with my question; for my fellow sisters to be informative not shady üëåüèæ‚úåüèæ

I&#39;m not shaming you, just confused. I got the implication that you went out of your way for Rumer rather than an insurance situation. My bad.

I&#39;m booked using insurance with Vanderbilt University. They&#39;ve done my top surgery whic included an extended arm lift, and an abdominal skin removal following massive weight loss. Their surgeons are newer, but all the work I&#39;ve seen and patients I&#39;ve heard from in private have positive experiences.

No it&#39;s because she&#39;s a monster who butchers people, destroys their lives, denies culpability, and then uses her blood money to tie her malpractice lawsuits up in court indefinitely.

I don&#39;t have any personal experience with her but I have spoken to some people who had surgery through her and read many experiences and from what I gather is that she does too many surgeries throughout the year to do any sort of aftercare such as revisions and doesn&#39;t really care about results simply just getting them completed. To what I&#39;ve read she doesn&#39;t care about her patients and honestly I don&#39;t know why she does the surgery because it doesn&#39;t seem like she has any sort of planned for aftercare. When I was going through one of the pre-surgery classes for my surgeon, Dr BBL and Dr Zhao, one of the girls who was there was the partner of someone who had Rumer and she said that her partner lost almost all depth one year post surgery. I don&#39;t want to tell you what to do but judging from all the anecdotal evidence I don&#39;t think that she&#39;s a good decision to have as a surgeon. I think that she doesn&#39;t actually care about helping the trans community or actualizing their self-image but just simply getting the surgeries completed. Maybe she cared at some point but it definitely doesn&#39;t seem like she does now. She does more procedures in one year than almost any of the other surgeons in this country and that&#39;s saying something because my doctor uses a robot and only takes 3 hours to do the surgery in total.

I went to Rumer originally and went to BBL/Zhao for NEEDED revision afterwards. I lost almost all depth from my first surgery. My vagina basically healed in the shape of an hourglass -- it closed in the middle. I had godawful-smelling green discharge from above where it healed in the middle and her office did not help me one bit. My vaginal discharge smelled like feces, but thankfully I didn&#39;t have a rectovaginal fistula like some of her other patients I&#39;ve personally talked to. Rumer and her staff are all incompetent. My complications from my first surgery were ignored, even after countless emails to her staff. I want the past 5 years of my fucking life back. I&#39;m doing better now... still healing... but jesus fucking christ, go to a different doctor. I can&#39;t stress this enough. Look up the
<a href="https://jezebel.com" rel="nofollow">jezebel.com
</a>
article about Rumer. It basically parallels my experience even though it isn&#39;t about me at all, nor do I have anything to do with Jezebel. Rumer made it extremely hard for me to get my medical records from her too. I had to complain to the PA Dept of Health and State... and then her idiot staff included 2 other patients&#39; records mixed in with mine. I have detailed records about another patient&#39;s genitals. The incompetent leading an incompetent staff.

Yeah I really considered going to her because of how quickly I could get surgery completed but then when I started reading about people&#39;s experiences with her a few years ago it turned me on to the best decision I could possibly make and that&#39;s when I decided to go with Dr BBL and Dr Zhao. I&#39;m sorry you had such a terrifying journey I can&#39;t imagine how frustrating it&#39;s been. I&#39;m glad they were able to do a revision for you it makes me so happy and I couldn&#39;t recommend the NYU langone team enough to everybody because you can genuinely tell that they actually care about what they&#39;re doing. It makes me so happy that they were able to help you fix the way you were wronged.

If you can contact the other patients it‚Äôs probably a HIPPA violation and there‚Äôs big fines for that.

Run, don&#39;t even dare looking at that name. You might get traumatized for life seeing what she has done to many unfortunate individuals. I have seen a couple results from her and they are far away from the minimum expectations.

Seriously... do your self a favor and don&#39;t let her fuck up your life.

Former victim here.  Do not.   It took me over 3years to get what she did corrected.   Save yourself the headache.   She isn&#39;t shy about using extortion to get her way.    If you happen to say something she doesn&#39;t agree with she will threaten your care.

Same... I&#39;m also a victim of hers, and I also agree with your last sentence.

I had surgery with her 3 years ago and I finally am getting the opportunity at a revision with a competent surgeon. If you are worried about aesthetics and feel she is by far the poorest choice you can have. If I did not have the hope of a revision to look forward to for the last 3 years I probably would have been in a very dark mental health space (if not already dead) because of what she did to me.
</p>
<p>
This morning I was dilating and it hit me up very hardly how bad she butchered me. The material she left behind where my urethra is swells and the stands about a good 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch beyond my vagina. My anatomy is so confusing that a cis-female partner mistook my urethra for my vagina the first time she fingered me. And a male partner stopped dating me after he saw it.
</p>
<p>
If you want someone that is good with aesthetic there is hardly anyone less competent. She is not even a plastic surgeon and I would never wish her knife to touch a TERF let alone a fellow trans sibling. I know how important and how much anticipation goes into this and it&#39;s worth getting it done right by someone who actually gives a shit about the results they will leave you with.

I&#39;m so sorry :( I also didn&#39;t realize at first how badly she butchered me as well. She told me for around a year straight that everything was healing &#34;beautifully&#34; when it clearly wasn&#39;t. At 13 months post-op, I suddenly just got severe complications? Pfft yea right. Maybe if her office actually fucking listened and got back to me, I wouldn&#39;t have needed to go somewhere else for revision. I was gaslighted and ghosted. I went to NYU Langone for revision. Rumer is incompetent.

What type of implants did she use on you?   My friend had GCS and BA at the same time.    I had my BA a year prior.    She would have never picked what I ended up with.

Rumer is just a butcher. Whether if there are new reviews or not she will always remain a butcher. Good that you ask now go cancel your surgery and avoid being mangled by her butcher scalpel.

I have a close real life friend who had SRS with Dr Rumer several years ago. She paid completely out of her own pocket so she could have gone to many other surgeons but she went with Rumer. I‚Äôm pleased to report that she had a good result and is happy with the surgery to this day.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm just throwing that out there so that people know that there actually exist people who had good results with Dr Rumer. It‚Äôs not 100% always bad! But, I do think it‚Äôs important to understand the gravity and sheer number of negative reviews of this surgeon. Personally I would not recommend it.

Personal experience staff is incompetent along with surgeon. Lies on medical records and ghosts when things go wrong. Dealing with a freak show from her. Never did follow ups. One excuse and lie after another. Have a child do the surgery you‚Äôd get better results.
