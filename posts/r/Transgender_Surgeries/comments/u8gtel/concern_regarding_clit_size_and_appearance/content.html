You still have a ton of swelling.  Do not worry at this point.  I really believe until you are a year from surgery that a lot of improvement will happen.  The swelling may be hiding the hooding, and labia minora.  Very likely your clitoris will become smaller and less prominent.  Everyone heals differently, but I would try not to evaluate aesthetics until you are 12 months post op. Try some ice packs outside your panties for 20 minutes three times daily.  Be sure to also have a liner in your underwear to protect the skin.  It could possibly help swelling.  Do not compare yourself to other women here until 12 months out.  Be patient, recovery and healing are slow and take time.  I am mtf and a physician.  I am not a surgeon but do hrt and take care of people including mtf and ftm,nb etc.  Hugs, Bridget

I&#39;m hoping to get thoughts of others about my clit and how it seems to just refuse to go down in swelling at all amd looks like it had healed into the right side labia minora.
</p>
<p>
I am 6 weeks now post op and opinions or experiences would really help here. I have a follow up with my surgeon soon.

No worries lady... it looks like you are still early in healing, and have a lot of swelling to wait out... it&#39;ll all go down, and you will be pleased... I worried as well... and the more I waited, the better I felt.

It looks like your clitoris may have had some superficial necrosis in the prior pictures. The swelling may take awhile to decrease because of that. Also, it looks like the labia majora are trying to fuse in the midline.

She is a little big, but nothing terrible. You’d rather be a little bit then a little too small, imo. You can get a labiaplasty revision. You have a good amount of tissue left to work with. I’d let swelling go down and assess from there.

I think you’re all good girl. There are plenty of cis girls who have big clits that still poke out a bit in poses like the last pic too, me being one of those cis girls haha. Vulvas come in all shapes and sizes but you’re still healing as well, I wouldn’t sweat too much

Clit size are intentionally left large as to retain sensitivity. Yes, lack of hood. You can get a revision. Specifically through PFV or PPT.

you could try manually freeing up theinner labia a couple of times daily and the hood also . use bacitracin  or put vaseline gauze to help keep open.  Not much to lose by trying.  Be gentle but persistent, it will likely hurt. Use a mirror and lots of light.  Might be easier than a second surgery

Definitely not normal. But, give it another 6 weeks.

Remember worst case scenario you can always have a labiaplasty and clitoral reduction/revision.
