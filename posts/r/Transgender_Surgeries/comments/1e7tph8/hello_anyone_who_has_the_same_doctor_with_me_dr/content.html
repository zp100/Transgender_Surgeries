It looks more swollen than the usual. I&#39;ve seen some of his results and within 1 month it&#39;s more &#34;saggy&#34; and not really swollen. Are you still in Bangkok? If not, I&#39;d suggest you visit your local doctor to take a look.

Just swollen, will go down. You have a better result than most.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone else here who&#39;s had surgery with Dr Thep, but this looks relatively ok for 1 month. Some aspect of it are really quite good. However, I&#39;m not sure what you are expecting. Its possible to get better aesthetics, but you&#39;d have to pay far more money.
