What were your overall thoughts with Hart &amp; his work, and with your procedure and recovery experience? (If you donâ€™t mind my asking). Iâ€™ve got an appointment with my GP mid-March to get a referral to see him. When I called Hartâ€™s rooms a few weeks ago, they said a consult would likely be in August, surgery could possibly be 2026. But my consult probably wonâ€™t be until September now, considering how long it has taken to get in to see my GP. I just want to get in before he closes his books again.

I had my consultation back in November last year and my surgery is early to mid 2026 for PPT, PIV could have been a bit sooner, so maybe 2027 might be a more realistic approximation for your procedure.

Yeah. That makes sense. I mean, neither I nor the person who answered the phone specified the type of surgery. I just asked about the timeline for vaginoplasty. I should have specified I was wanting PPT. She said they were currently booking surgeries for end of 2025, heading into 2026. I figured by the time I get my consult, theyâ€™ll likely be booking into 2027. I just want to at least get on the books for now. I keep reading about how he periodically closes them for a few months to let the backlog come down. Hopefully not before I get my referral.
</p>
<p>
But time to prepare is good. Iâ€™ve been on HRT for seven years. But I donâ€™t even know where to start with finding someone for a psych sign-off, and I need to get Super release organised. Heck, if Iâ€™m waiting until 2027, maybe itâ€™ll even be on Medicare by the time my surgery comes up, haha. Plus I have no idea how logistics are going to work yet. We live 5hrs north of Garran. So thereâ€™s a lot to figure out.
</p>
<p>
If you donâ€™t mind, how did you find the consult? Can you tell me anything about what to expect?

Write out a comprehensive list of questions and have that with you otherwise you may , like I did, forget something and realise after that you wanted to ask that.  Do your homework as to the type of procedure that you are interested in getting as it will impact on wait times etc. The consult may feel rushed but if you go in with a &#34;plan&#34; and ask the right questions you will find Dr Hart very down to earth and easy to communicate with. As you have probably already worked out he is extremely busy so if you do think of anything after the consult you can email the practice and he will answer when he can.

He is so attentive and during recovery so far has been very helpful and I feel very comfortable with asking him anything and that I&#39;ll be ok Although being a very busy person he certainly has been very helpful, also the nursing staff was fantastic at the hospital,  Although he doesn&#39;t do anything in person I felt informed before surgery although I would recommend getting a list of questions together now , So far I&#39;ve been happy with results expect for some swelling and scarring causing me insecurites,  Dilateing has also been very easy so far so I&#39;m confident that things will heal nicely  I would also recommend getting Lazer on shaft and testies now because that is an issue I&#39;m discovering, having pubes in your labia not fun  Also gotta remember there&#39;s backlog with hart due to Ives quitting so there&#39;s a good chance there&#39;ll be lots of cancellations and you can be moved up . Hope this makes sense and helps  Feel free to DM me if you have any further questions

Thanks. That definitely helps. Glad to hear itâ€™s mostly going well. Iâ€™ll have to look into the hair removal. The place I go to for my face doesnâ€™t do those areas. Iâ€™ll definitely have to put together a list of questions for the consult. I want to make sure I know everything and am well informed. But right now, trying to think of what questions I would actually ask him, my mind goes blank.

Iâ€™m so happy for everyone who is able to get gender affirming surgery!  It seems impossible for me, but seeing my fellow trans folx get theirs gives me some hope &gt;\&lt;[
