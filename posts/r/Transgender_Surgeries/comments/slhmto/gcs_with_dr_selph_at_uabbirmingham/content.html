I had GCS in late September with Dr Selph at UAB-Birmingham. Dr. Selph is a reconstructive urologist that started doing GCS about 2 years ago.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve attached a timeline of pics from 5 days to 6 months.
</p>
<p>
ask away.

Edited to add imgur link, images are NSFW

Wow, great result!! That’s very encouraging. Thank you. How do you feel about the overall experience? Hospital, follow up care, preop process?

My only real complaint is about the food.
</p>
<p>
The surgery is performed at UAB-Highlands (that&#39;s where the robot is) and you have to call every day for next days food and the food itself is not good. Like, the broth and side stuff is ok but the main dishes leave a lot to be desired, even for hospital food. If you don&#39;t order, I think you only get a basic breakfast, but no lunch or dinner.
</p>
<p>
I was only mis-gendered once or twice and they immediately corrected themselves but for the most part all of the staff were very nice.
</p>
<p>
Pre-op was your basic stuff, questions, blood work, urine sample and at least for now, a covid test a few days prior to your admission date.
<br>
I think it was about 3 months or so from when I decided to go forward and getting a surgery date, and it only took my insurance about 2 weeks to approve it.
<br>
Post op, the abdominal pain was the worst and lasted about 2-3 days. Because they do the surgery laparoscopically your abdomen is inflated and it takes time for that excess air to work it&#39;s way out.
</p>
<p>
This is a hybrid PPT which uses about a third each of scrotal/penile/peritoneum tissue, no hair removal is required since he does a follicle scraping. This save a lot of time, money and pain since you can skip that part.
</p>
<p>
I had my first post-op O at around 6-7 weeks.

Anytime. If you think of any other questions please feel free to ask!
<br>
I really recommend Dr. Selph, plus he doesn&#39;t have a super long waiting list (yet!), so you can get surgery pretty soon.

I&#39;ll be there week after next for a 5 month follow up.
</p>
<p>
I will say he doesn&#39;t really take requests as far as appearance goes.
<br>
His goal is to have a successful surgery and &#39;you get what you get with what you&#39;ve got&#39;. Appearance can be tweaked later but from what I can tell, very few need revisions from his procedure.

Very good. Dr Selph is very easy to talk to and answered my questions. We are good to go as soon as I send him my letters. We’re looking at a early December (my choice it could have been sooner) surgery date so I will have my letters renewed in July and they will get the surgery pre-approval with my insurance underway at that point.  At this point I feel very comfortable with this arrangement. Thanks for your input!! Thanks for asking too.

He did mine about a year ago. I lived on chicken fingers and jello while I was there. We heard the food was horrible before I went, so I took a lot of my own snacks/food.
</p>
<p>
I did lose about 10 pounds while I was there

Most post the pictures to Imgur in a separate album, then make a link to them in the Reddit post.

I think it might have to do with the spoiler tag. Try removing it and uploading the pics again.

You can also put the photos on an external site and just edit the text to link to it.

I hate how gruesome it always looks in the very beginning it makes me so scared for when it happens to me. Your long term results are looking fantastic though!!!
