aloha friends! I had vocal feminization surgery in Korea with Yeson voice center on Jan 2nd.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of detailed accounts of how that usually goes down already on reddit, so I‚Äôll just add what I didn‚Äôt see anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm an actor, and was expecting to go in for my initial appointment and be told how strong and healthy my voice is. Turns out I had pretty bad asymmetry in my natural vocal folds, which prevented me from pronating properly. this affects my speaking voice and especially my singing. so that was surprising. dr kim said it was pretty bad. i asked how often his trans patients have this issue, and he said that actually a lot do, and it‚Äôs caused by straining to use your voice improperly for years and years. like, for example, speaking high all the time without proper training. for me, that had been since my voice dropped in middle school. so like over a decade of vocal stress. (i‚Äôm 26)
</p>
<p>
good news was, he was able to fix all that surgically. in addition to increasing the pitch of my voice.
</p>
<p>
right now is about 4 weeks later. i started talking again though he recommended i wait 2 months (instead of one) for extra healing. i might actually go back to my vow of silence.
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: 5 weeks later. been talking. my voice sounds mostly the same except without some of my very bottom range. people notice it is different though. but still in the masculine pitch range. hoping to see improvements soon.
</p>

I got VFSRAC from Dr. Kim (Yeson) January 13th. They increased price. Now it‚Äôs $8,400 + Botox if needed. But 99% getting Botox injection too.

well with covid, there‚Äôs a 10 day quarantine in korea. it‚Äôs all handled very smoothly and you‚Äôll be automatically whisked from the airport to a ‚Äúgovernment facility‚Äù at your own expense. that expense is almost exactly $1000 USD flat and the facility is actually some random nice hotel somewhere. they deliver you food and drinks 3 times a day and when you‚Äôre free, you get picked up by Yeson and taken to a hotel you would have booked previously near Yeson. they like to do an initial appointment, and then surgery the next day, with a follow up usually a week later or in my case just 2 days later. so that seems flexible.
</p>
<p>
so total time would be like 2 and a half weeks max including the quarantine? if you reach out to their english liaison Jessie, she‚Äôll mock up a schedule for you so you can see if it something you‚Äôre interested in. hotels are very cheap there now, probably cause they‚Äôre mostly empty.
</p>
<p>
edit: sorry didn‚Äôt even answer the question. someone else commented it but yes‚Ä¶ surgery recently went up to $8400. so that plus mandatory quarantine and flights and hotel is like 10,000 11,000 range for everything

Would you consider doing a follow-up post, once you&#39;re done with voice rest? I feel like there are a lot of posts describing the surgery, but no that many sharing their recovery and results.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also going to Yeson, in April, and im veeery excited and nervous!
<br>
Also, heads-up to anyone who&#39;s going/considering it. The travel quarantine is being reduced from 10 days to 7 days from February 4th.

i am done with voice rest. he suggested 2 months but the normal is 1 month and it‚Äôs been 1 month. my voice sounds very much the same as before, slightly higher and different in timbre. in the couple days i‚Äôve been speaking it‚Äôs went up slightly but is expected to do most pitch increasing at the 2-4 month mark. i used an app to measure the pitch range of my normal speaking voice and i can see it‚Äôs currently up from 92hz-137hz to 116hz-175hz.
</p>
<p>
other than the slight pitch increase and slight different texture of my voice, the biggest difference is there‚Äôs no low part anymore. i can‚Äôt make low deep sounds at all. it just kinda gives a tug feeling and my voice feels tired. i think in a week or two, and definitely in a month when the botox wears off, i‚Äôll have more progress to share.

That sounds like a great outcome. Awesome! I really hope my lower range will be eliminated too. Thank you for sharing - it&#39;s very reassuring to hear üòÅ
