Why the hell did they &#34;warn you&#34; not to go back for revision? That doesn&#39;t seem trustworthy

Mmhh.. I&#39;m still gathering information about srs so I hope someone who has more info comments, but I never heard of them advising against revisions when they appear to be very common.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t look bad, but I understand your concerns. It just feels off them saying that, is all (at least to me, it could also be my ignorance showing). it&#39;s after all, all about you feeling better. Weather someone else says it&#39;s good or not, it&#39;s you who has to feel comfortable.

totally and also the revisions are paid out of pocket which means I likely won&#39;t be able to afford.

If there is  a medical reason for the revision (other than cosmetic), GRS Montreal can get it covered under RAMQ if you&#39;re in Quebec (I know a few people who&#39;ve had to go for revisions). How other provinces work I&#39;m not sure.
