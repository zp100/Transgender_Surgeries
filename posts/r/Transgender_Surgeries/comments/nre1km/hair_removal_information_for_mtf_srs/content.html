A big part of SRS can be the hair removal that is done before the surgery.
</p>
<h1>
Learning
</h1>
<p>
This topic can be controversial as there is a lot of misinformation. This is an overall lack of medical research on the short term as well as long term outcomes. I recommend taking time to learn and making your own choices beyond what I have written. Some more places to start learning:

<h1>
Why is hair removal required?
</h1>
<p>
Anything that ends up inside of the vagina you want to be hair free. Beyond being undesirable, hair inside the vagina can cause infections. Hair removal after the surgery isn&#39;t very possible.
</p>
<p>
No matter where you go, no matter their technique (including PPT), what surgeon you go to (even those in Thailand) every surgeon appears to be okay with getting all hair from the perineum region (between scrotum to anus) removed.
</p>
<p>
For most surgeons, the shaft, its base, and the perineum region create the entrance to the vagina and the back wall in almost all SRS procedures. These are not removed and so they are not scraped during surgery.
</p>
<p>
Only scrotal skin that is removed can be scraped/cauterized. You don&#39;t want to rely only on this, but it can be a good final clearing of this skin of any hairs that were missed.
</p>
<h2>
No hair removal required
</h2>
<p>
For every surgeon that says you don&#39;t need hair removal, you can find testimonials from their patients saying that they found hair after surgery.
</p>
<h2>
Anecdotes
</h2>
<p>
You can also find people who have only done laser, or electrolysis, or some combination, or didn&#39;t do anything and only had scraping/cauterizing and say they have no hair.
</p>
<h1>
Laser v.s. electrolysis
</h1>
<p>
I&#39;ll preface this by saying I am unaware of any long term published medical studies on laser or electrolysis so comparing them is all anecdotal as far as I can tell.
</p>
<p>
According to a
<a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm048995.htm">FDA release on electrolysis
</a>
</p>
<p>
&#34;Electrolysis is considered a permanent hair removal method since it destroys the hair follicle&#34;
</p>
<p>
There is no such statement around laser. Further laser can&#39;t get everything including white, blond, red, grey, thin black, and black hair with white roots. As laser damages, but doesn&#39;t kill hairs there are more and more of these. And how well laser works very much depends on your skin color. In contrast, electrolysis works regardless of hair or skin tone.
</p>
<p>
It is important to
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransWiki/wiki/hair-removal#wiki_electrolysis_vs_laser">research this topic
</a>
for yourself because this isn&#39;t like your legs that you can touch up next year.
</p>
<p>
If the choice is between doing nothing and hoping the surgeon deals with it or doing laser I would choose laser every single time.
</p>
<p>
If you feel okay with having laser done alternating every other week between laser and electrolysis (for anything that laser can&#39;t get) can be a way to get to the continuous clearing stage of hair removal faster. When possible (probably a few months tops) you want to switch to clearing with electrolysis full time.
</p>
<p>
If you are unsure about laser, start with electrolysis from day one.
</p>
<h1>
How long will it take?
</h1>
<p>
Hair grows in cycles. At any given time most of the hair is not active. So even if you kill all hair that is visible most of the hair is dormant and will appear in the upcoming months.
</p>
<p>
The genital hair cycle is often stated to be between 5-7 months, 12 weeks resting, then 2-4 months active. If you think you can get it done in less time than this you will probably be disappointed. Further, The Richards-Merhag table has
<a href="https://hairfreelife.com/life-hair-anagen-categen-telogen-phases/">8 months for Groin growth
</a>
)
</p>
<p>
Waiting at least a year after you are &#34;done&#34; to ensure no regrowth is the most reliable way to ensure you are clear, but often people do electrolysis up to a few weeks before surgery (3 seems common). The surgery should be 3-12+ weeks after your last electrolysis session for healing.
</p>
<h2>
Genital hair cycle math
</h2>
<p>
Below is an example scenario to make it more clear how it can take more than a year to actually clear all the hair.
</p>
<p>
At a session, several possible issues can cause hair to not be killed
</p>
<ul>
<li>
1 Electrolysis might zap the follicle, but not actually kill a hair follicle, requiring you to wait until the next active period to try again. 15-50% of electrolysis hairs have regrowth depending on the skill of the electrologist.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Not clearing the area and the hair can start its next resting period. Either you run out of time or if you do clear two or three always seem to be missed anyway.
<br>
</li>
<li>
It becomes ingrown and you end up pulling it out and have to wait until it appears again. As Electrolysis weakens hairs it is easier for some of them to become ingrown.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Example timeline:
</p>
<p>
Oct - (nothing done)
</p>
<p>
Nov - (nothing done)
</p>
<p>
Dec - (nothing done)
</p>
<p>
Jan - Finished first full electrolysis clearing, active hair from Jan was available for hair removal for the first time
</p>
<p>
Feb - active (Anagen phase) hairs that started resting the previous Oct now reappear
</p>
<p>
Mar - active hairs that started resting in Nov now reappear
</p>
<p>
Apr - active hairs that started resting in Dec now reappear
</p>
<p>
May - active hairs that started resting in Jan now reappear a second time
</p>
<p>
Jun - Jan hair active
</p>
<p>
Jul - Jan hair active
</p>
<p>
Aug - Jan hair still active (worst case of 4 months)
</p>
<p>
Sep - Jan hair resting
</p>
<p>
Oct - Jan hair resting
</p>
<p>
Nov - Jan hair resting
</p>
<p>
Dec - Jan hair active a third time
</p>
<p>
The worst-case scenario would be the hairs that start resting in January when you do your first clearing and if you only do 6 months of hair removal you could only get two opportunities to actually kill those.
</p>
<p>
Electrolysis only kills 50-85% of hairs. You need to give each hair as many opportunities as possible, at least 3. 6 months of clearings means maybe only 2 opportunities, 10 months means 3. A little over a year for 4. If you have 5000 hairs and kill 85% each time after 4 cycles you might have 3 that still survived.
</p>
<p>
Another simple way of thinking about it is: With a cycle of at best 5 months and at worst 8 months, if you want to get through 3 cycles that is 15-24 months of clearing to be confident you got everything.
</p>
<h2>
From those that do this as a living
</h2>
<p>
Ignoring the math, going out into the real world, and speaking to several electrologists, each one has said that most of their patients take more than a year.
</p>
<h2>
Clearing
</h2>
<p>
Until you are clearing all the required areas in a session it is possible to miss hairs that then go dormant and you have to wait months to kill them the next time around.
</p>
<p>
You could be doing an hour every week for 8 months, but because you never fully cleared in a session you still have months of dormant hairs to kill and feel discouraged.
</p>
<p>
You have a lot more hair at the start. Reaching that point where you can clear everything in a session is very important for having a guess for when you might be done. This can take anywhere from 10-30 hours. Booking as much time as you can at the start will help.
</p>
<p>
Until I was able to clear the entire surgical area in a session I did not feel I could not even start my clock and thus couldn&#39;t think about booking a surgical date as I had no idea when I might be finished. I could have consultations but didn&#39;t book a date.
</p>
<h2>
How often?
</h2>
<p>
1-2 hours a week or 3 hours every other week of electrolysis is common. Maybe you will need less, maybe more, but this should give you an idea of what others are doing.
</p>
<h2>
I heard I only need 20 hours of electrolysis?
</h2>
<p>
The more I learned the more I realized that just because someone said they only had 20 hours of electrolysis before surgery doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t need 50 or 100, only that they
<em>
only had
</em>
20 hours before the surgery date arrived. I also found many reports of exactly 6 months of electrolysis, but I also learned that often the surgery date is booked 7 months out so you can
<em>
only have
</em>
6 months of electrolysis. 1 hour a week for 6 months is where I think a lot of the reports of having ~24 hours of electrolysis. Who knows if they actually needed more? Paying attention to those who reported that they gave themselves a year+ for electrolysis before booking their surgery day. 40, 80, and 100+ hours aren&#39;t uncommon.
</p>
<h2>
Misc Thoughts
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The sessions need to never be more than 2 months apart or it would miss active hairs
<br>
</li>
<li>
Each session
<strong>
must
</strong>
clear everything or you can&#39;t count that as clearing all the hairs in that &#34;2 month window&#34;
<br>
</li>
<li>
At every session always start by clearing the shaft, the base of the penis, and perineum as these are the most important as these can not be cauterized in surgery.
<br>
</li>
<li>
If you spend 8 months clearing dark hair with a laser, you might still have another 8 months to clear everything the laser can&#39;t kill.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some other things to take into account when you ponder how many hours it might take you: Genital hair can be different, such as being curly and requiring a lot more time per hair to kill. Some people have a lot of hair, some people have very little. The skill of the person doing the electrolysis also matters. Everyone goes at different rates and faster doesn&#39;t mean better because they might not be putting the needle in all the way correctly.
</p>
<h2>
Final thoughts on &#34;how long?&#34;
</h2>
<p>
Because there is a surgery date, a date after which you can not have any more electrolysis, that is the reason you have to care about the hair cycle. You could do an hour or two here and there when not busy over the course of years, give yourself a year break to prove there is nothing, and then book a surgery. But we are all impatient and would prefer to get SRS sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p>
I have read a report of having hair after doing laser for a year and another report of having hair after 100 hours of electrolysis. It might be impossible to have zero hairs after SRS. The goal is to eliminate as much as possible, especially any coarse hair.

Dr. McGinn doesn&#39;t post her diagram online, but she requires even more area cleared than BBL
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have been collecting them from various surgeons for a while now and I was surprised at how varied the size of the required area was. While the number of months required to clear the area will always be the same because you have to go through the hair cycles, the total number of hours you have to have can vary drastically due to the size of the area.
</p>
<p>
I have been able to get a copy of the hair removal diagram without a consultation, either from someone else who went to them for a consultation or by asking the assistant.
</p>
<h1>
Showing your surgeon
</h1>
<p>
If you have the opportunity to show your surgeon your progress the most important question to answer is if the areas that you are clearing are correct. Is what you are getting done matching up with where they will cut?
</p>
<p>
If it is 7 days after a session and you are as bald as a baby they have no clue how much dormant hair there is. I would only look for their opinion about if I am done removing hair if it has been a while (minimum 4 weeks?, 8 weeks better) since my last appointment and they could get a much better opinion of the level of hair remaining.
</p>
<h1>
Surgeons perspective
</h1>
<p>
Hair removal is the patient&#39;s responsibility to get done before surgery.
</p>
<p>
Patients often don&#39;t have the best compliance with hair removal even when given the time. If they show up on surgery day with only a few hours of electrolysis the surgeon won&#39;t cancel the surgery. Surgeons will do their best to kill hairs with scraping/cauterizing (if they do that), but they can&#39;t make guarantees.
</p>
<p>
It is worth thinking over the actual logistics of what happens during surgery. If they cauterize, someone sits down with the cut skin, killing any hairs they can spot one at a time. Surgery is only a few hours at most and not all of that time can be spent on treating the skin. How much hair can someone realistically remove in a few hours? And remember, this person can only kill active hairs they can see. Can that be as effective as dozens of hours spent on laser/electrolysis over a period of months?
</p>
<p>
Even though they recommend patients stop electrolysis 1-2 months before surgery to give time for the skin to heal, patients are having electrolysis done up to 2 weeks before surgery (often 3). Even those that give themselves plenty of time still want to remove any last hairs before surgery.
</p>
<p>
Patients want the surgery yesterday, they also don&#39;t want to move the surgical date even if they know they have not had enough done.
</p>
<p>
It is less about what is an acceptable amount of hair in the vagina after SRS and more about the reality that operating on people who have not had a lot of hair removal is common.
</p>
<p>
I have spoken to surgeons who say they regularly see hair inside the vagina at follow up appointments, but don&#39;t say anything because there is nothing the patient can do at that point.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Leis said his assistant will miss killing ~10% during surgery.

you won&#39;t find much either. Search on Reddit and elsewhere for posts by those who are seeking a solution and read the replies to further confirm that there isn&#39;t much you can do.
</p>
<h1>
Pain
</h1>
<p>
You can get a prescription (or pick up over the counter such as NumbSkin or Topicane 5) for Lidocaine and Prilocaine at 2.5%, 5%, or higher to put on before your appointment which will take a lot of the sting off. Unlike facial hair where I could get by without anything, I recommended doing this.
</p>
<p>
Some places will do lidocaine injections which are nice, but you still want the cream beforehand to deal with the pain of the injection. Ever say to yourself, I am looking forward to someone injecting my genitals with a 6&#34; needle multiple times? That&#39;s when you know your pain tolerance has changed. That was only sort of a joke.
</p>
<p>
I have tried stress balls, fidget cubes, and other things, but by far the best thing hands down is to try to calm my entire body. Like I am trying to go to sleep, relaxing every muscle and using slow breathing techniques. For me, the first 15 minutes were always the worst until I got used to it.
</p>
<p>
In general, being well rested and hydrated will improve your pain tolerance.
</p>
<h1>
Aftercare
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Hygiene before and after each SRS electrolysis appointment is
<strong>
much more important
</strong>
than for facial electrolysis.
<br>
</li>
<li>
You want to regularly exfoliate (such as with salt) every other day to prevent ingrown hairs which will become more common as some hairs don&#39;t die, but become weaker and thinner. If an ingrown hair is inflamed bad enough that the whole area can&#39;t be worked on. Daily showers and exfoliation can help a lot.
<br>
</li>
<li>
When you spot ingrown hairs you want to gently pull the hair out of the skin, but don&#39;t pluck it out.
<br>
</li>
<li>
After a session, take an aspirin, apply ice, drink water, and nap. Above all, don&#39;t move and you will reduce the pain. The next day you will be worn out, ideally work from home if you can.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Miscellaneous
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
When I wasn&#39;t yet sure I wanted SRS I could have still have had several rounds of laser, each 8+ weeks apart at my regular laser for facial hair appointments. If I did have SRS this could have killed off some of the hairs before doing electrolysis.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I wish I had been more on the ball about getting my insurance prior authorization approval rather than letting it drag out for 9 months.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Set a calendar appointment one week before your appointment to shave so you don&#39;t forget.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Wear a skirt to every single appointment. You won&#39;t want to ever tuck or have pressure from say tight jeans after an appointment.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Often there is small amounts of bleeding. Wear underwear you don&#39;t mind ruining.
<br>
</li>
<li>
When you are told that you are all clear at the end of a session take a look yourself before you get up, every time I have found one or two hairs that from my angle I spotted that were missed.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Once you start being able to actually clear either have shorter, more frequent appointments or book longer sessions with the expectation you will be using the extra time for your face, bikini line, etc. Never worry that you are not able to clear.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Dark coarse hairs were targeted first and I was able to clear all dark hairs several sessions before I could clear all hair including the blond and red. The clock doesn&#39;t start until ALL hairs are cleared in a session, not only dark ones.
<br>
</li>
<li>
I knew that I needed continuous sessions all year, but during that time covid happened, I had VFS, then I had to switch the person doing my electrolysis, then switched again. Life happens and you need to do your best to adapt. And if you have to restart the timer, so be it.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Dysphoria
</h1>
<p>
So yeah, you have to go and hang out with someone while they work on your genitals. It is important to remember this isn&#39;t sexual, this isn&#39;t anything, it is a job, a task. They are professional and have done this for years. You are the Wednesday appointment. The first few appointments can be awkward, but it gets easier and you will become more at ease with time.
</p>
<h1>
Cost
</h1>
<p>
Doing laser for SRS is more expensive than elsewhere on your body. Doing electrolysis for SRS is more expensive than electrolysis for your face.
</p>
<p>
Want lidocaine injections? That will be even more expensive.
</p>
<h2>
Insurance
</h2>
<p>
If your insurance covers hair removal, get that paperwork started asap as they can drag their feet at every step from prior authorization to reimbursements.
</p>
<h1>
Common Experience
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Clearing the shaft (Always clear the shaft at every appointment!) and one other area
<br>
</li>
<li>
Clearing the shaft + all other areas one time
<br>
</li>
<li>
Being able to clear more than one area in a session
<br>
</li>
<li>
Being able to clear all areas in a session
<br>
</li>
<li>
Consistently clearing all coarse dark hairs with time left over
<br>
</li>
<li>
Consistently clearing all dark, red, blond, etc hairs with time left over
<br>
</li>
<li>
Session after session for 12-24 months.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Needing less time to clear the dark coarse hair. Example: If I wait 4 weeks between appointments I used to require ~8 hours of hair removal, which decreased to only ~4 hours and then only ~2 hours.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Needing less time to clear the non-dark hair.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Final electrolysis session as close as 3 weeks before surgery. Sometimes combined with a round of laser to kill anything not visible that started growing under the skin.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To reach the point where you can clear all areas at the end of an appointment you can put in more hours and have more appointments.
<strong>
This is the main milestone in this process.
</strong>
Maybe you can get there in only 12 hours, maybe it is 30 hours. This could take you 1 month or 6 months. This depends more on how many hours you want to put in than how much hair you have. After you reach that point you are then going through the hair growth cycle and there is no way to make that part faster.
</p>
<p>
If you want to speed up the entire process, reach the point where you can clear everything in a session as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
From start to finish on average more than a year is spent doing electrolysis.
</p>
<h1>
What I did
</h1>
<p>
I have been told I have average hair both in quantity and time to remove each hair.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sep 2018 - Full laser session. At the time I wasn’t sure if I wanted SRS, but I was already at the laser office for a session on my face. I was aware that SRS hair removal would take a long time and so this might help reduce that. I also wanted to know how much worse it would hurt, and worst case if I didn’t have SRS having a little less hair on my bikini area would be nice. As expected it killed the dark hair and left the red/blond hair.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Aug 2019 - After an electrolysis appointment for my facial hair I got a test hair removed downstairs to feel how much &#34;fun&#34; getting hair removed for SRS would be. It was not fun. It was more painful than my upper lip. I bought some lidocaine.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Nov 2019 - Full laser session #2 (still waiting for my prior authorization for electrolysis I was eager to do something)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
After a lot of delays, I finally started electrolysis at the very start of 2020! I was still learning, but I imagined I could be done by early summer (haha). All my initial ~4/8 hour appointments had lidocaine injection(s) which ate up time at the start not actually doing electrolysis.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Jan 02, 2020 | +2 months 4h appointment, 3h30m actual
<br>
<ol>
<li>
Jan 23, 2020 | +3 weeks, 4h appointment, 3h30m actual
<br>
</li>
<li>
Jan 27, 2020 | +4 days, 1h appointment, 1h actual | 100% cleared around the shaft, mostly elsewhere
<br>
</li>
<li>
Feb 25, 2020 | +4 weeks, 4h appointment, 3h45m actual
<br>
</li>
<li>
Mar 13, 2020 | +2.5 weeks, 4h appointment, 3h actual | Partially cleared at the end of this appointment
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
COVID-19 happened and all electrolysis appointments were canceled.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Jun 30, 2020 | +3 months | 8h30m appointment, 7h50m actual | ~3/4 cleared 100% cleared around the shaft
<br>
<ol>
<li>
Jul 23, 2020 | +3 weeks | 8h appointment, 7h20m actual used the last 15m for electrolysis on my bikini line | 100% cleared
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I want to pause here to point out that it was 2 non-overlapping laser sessions and 17h (14h45m actual) of electrolysis before I was able to &#34;mostly clear&#34; the required area in a single session and later 33h30m (29h55m actual) before I was able to 100% clear in a session. Granted there was a COVID delay in the middle, but still!
</p>
<p>
I have been doing electrolysis for &#34;7 months&#34; with an average of more than an hour a week, and I am doing multi-hour long sessions with a lot of hair, not one hour cleanups. One could be upset that the paper estimation of being able to be done in 5-7 months didn&#39;t come to fruition. The important thing to learn is that it has not been 5-7 months of clearing, only 7 months reaching the point of having a full clearing.
</p>
<p>
If I now say today was my first 100% clearing and I can start the clock and if I have regular appointments I could be done at the earliest April 2021 or at least the amount of hair per session will be less by or after this point. This means I could have surgery at the earliest late next spring (May or onward), almost 2 years after starting the hair removal process.
</p>
<p>
While I was trying to be aggressive I had VFS at this point and scheduled my next electrolysis appointment for the day after I was allowed to talk again for the inevitable &#39;ow&#39;.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Sep 3, 2020 | +6 weeks, 5h30m appointment, 4h50m actual used remaining 30m for electrolysis on my face | 100% cleared
<br>

Oct 1, 2020 | +4 weeks, 7h appointment, 6h00m actual used the last 30m for electrolysis on my bikini line | 100% cleared
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
After being treated badly at the end of my Oct 1st appointment at Dr. Spiegel&#39;s office I switched to going to a new local place (
<a href="https://www.pulsehairremoval.com/">Pulse
</a>
). Turns out the new place had a compounded topical BLT cream (Benzocaine, Lidocaine, Tetracaine) which was fantastic and way better than injections. I highly recommended over injections. Bonus she was left handed so she was clearing starting from the side that usually was cleared last and less early on. Any extra time at the end was spent on my face or bikini line.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Oct 16, 2020 | +2 weeks | 2h50m | 100% cleared
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I shaved 7 days prior to my appointments for the first nine months. Blond hairs look similar to vellus hairs, especially with only 7 days of growth. I suspect that between the length and having so much dark coarse hair to deal with most of the blond hairs were simply skipped in the first half of the year. Less time is now spent on the black coarse hair the remaining time is being filled going after these blond thin hairs. I&#39;m shaving two weeks out at this point so it is clear which is vellus and which is blond hair that will grow very long.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Nov 13, 2020 | +4 weeks | 2h30m | 100% cleared dark hair, 50% blond. The first conversation about how much more electrolysis I needed (maybe 3-6 months?) and telling me others have had surgery at this level of clear.
<br>
<ol>
<li>
Nov 24, 2020 | +1.5 weeks | 3h | 100% cleared - Used a black ink dye, spent most of the time on blond hair removal.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For the first ~30 hours, every minute I know was removing the thicker coarse dark hair. But after that it gets fuzzy. Everything was cleared, but for some definition of cleared.
</p>
<p>
I will state the axiom that if I have an appointment for N hours, I will have N hours of hair removal.
</p>
<p>
I have tried to determine the correct amount of time I needed. Both for this post as well as for myself, but it isn&#39;t the easiest. At every appointment, we removed the darker, longer coarser hairs first followed by the thin hairs. After that time is spent on hairs outside of the required area. It might even be intentional such as explicitly working on my bikini line (because who wants to shave that?). You also have to contend with the fact that this part of the hair cycle could have more hair.
</p>
<p>
Month by month the amount to remove all the dark coarse hair was decreasing and that is what mattered even if I don&#39;t have the exact amount of time it took.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Dec 8, 2020 | +2 weeks | 2h40m | 100% cleared - Took less than 2 hours to get all dark coarse hair, the rest was thin hairs
<br>
<ol>
<li>
Dec 22, 2020 | +2 weeks | 2h | 100% cleared dark hair, 50% thin cleared
<br>
</li>
<li>
Dec 29, 2020 | +1 weeks | 2h45m | 100% cleared
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This marks 1 year of hair removal. I should be done right? Not doing 8 hours this past month right? I was hoping to have surgery in the spring, but given how much hair is still appearing I pushed back having surgery until next summer to give 6 more months of hair removal.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Jan 20, 2021 | +3 weeks | 2h30m | 100% cleared dark hair, 50% cleared blond
<br>
<ol>
<li>
Feb 5, 2021 | +2 weeks | 3h | 75% cleared. Not many dark thick coarse hairs, mostly it was all blond
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Because dark hairs were what was targeted from the start there are fewer of them at each appointment by now and instead, my appointments are being spent mostly on blond or thin dark hairs. These could have been ones that laser didn&#39;t kill, we didn&#39;t start working on until later, or previously thick coarse hairs that were not killed, but just damaged. It is almost like halfway through I started all over, but with these hairs.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Feb 17, 2021 | +2 weeks | 3h | 75% cleared. I think this might be the same as 100% cleared from 6 months ago, I am just way more strict and don&#39;t shave so the long blond is more visible which is the only thing left at the end of this session
<br>
<ol>
<li>
Feb 23, 2021 | +1 weeks | 3h | 100% cleared.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Mar 9, 2021 | +2 weeks | 3h | 100% cleared.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Mar 23, 2021 | +2 weeks | 3.5h | 100% cleared. This marks 8 months of continuous clearing. Less than 50 thick dark coarse hairs. The rest are thin or blond.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Apr 6, 2021 | +2 weeks | 3h | 100% cleared. Same report as the previous session.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Apr 20, 2021 | +2 weeks | 3h | 100% cleared. Same report as the previous session. Told I am clear enough at the start of the session that I could have surgery now or at least others have. Done 5 minutes early!
<br>
</li>
<li>
May 5, 2021 | +2 weeks | 2.30m | 100% cleared. Done 30 minutes early!
<br>
</li>
<li>
May 18, 2021 | +2 weeks | 2h45m | 100% cleared. Maybe 20 dark coarse hairs at the start? Done 15 minutes early! The last 15 minutes spent hunting for a few final hairs
<br>
</li>
<li>
Jun 1, 2021 | +2 weeks | 2h30m | 100% cleared. Done 1 hour early! Last 30 minutes hunting for any final hairs. Most of the real dark hairs were ingrown hairs I helped to the surface.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Jun 15, 2021 | +2 weeks | 2h45m | 100% cleared. The last half was spent killing small vellus hairs
<br>
</li>
<li>
Jun 22, 2021 | +1 weeks | 2h | 100% cleared. And a final laser session to kill anything that might be under the surface.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
From Nov 2019 to June 2021 I spent 20 &#34;continuous&#34; months on my hair removal, 30 sessions of different types and durations with a total of
</p>
<p>
96h30m of paid for electrolysis, 93h00m actual time.
</p>
<p>
And of course, I had one final &#34;session&#34; during my SRS.
</p>
<h2>
Lidocaine injections
</h2>
<p>
You won&#39;t feel a thing! This sounds fantastic, in theory. The reality was very different, at least at Dr. Spiegel&#39;s office. I would arrive and get the injection sometimes more than
<strong>
45 minutes after the session starts
</strong>
. I am charged dramatically more
<strong>
per minute
</strong>
all during this time. The injections wear off after about 2-3 hours and they would rarely if ever come back to give you a second injection even when you asked them to. When I was there all day I would be in pain at the start, the hour before lunch, and again two hours before the end of the day when it was worn off. And during the middle, there were always spots that the lidocaine would miss that would suddenly hurt like hell to have done. Also worth knowing that there are two people that do injections at Dr. Spiegel&#39;s office. Dr. Spiegel does it in a way that is much less painful than the other person.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the pain aspect, because you are getting injections you want to book a long session, this means I had to estimate how much time I needed which was harder as time went on. And longer sessions meant taking a morning or day off from work and a harder recovery. An hour or two session is something I could squeeze in without having to take a day off from work (long lunch, working early/late to make up time etc).
</p>
<p>
Because you get a lidocaine injection and can&#39;t feel anything a higher setting can be used, but unfortunately done wrong this can cause third degree burns and there have been several reports of this.
</p>
<p>
A simple injection at the start and a pain free session is not the true story at all.
</p>
<p>
Injections might be worth considering for the first session or two where you want to do all day sessions back to back to get to your first clearing. But if topical lidocaine works stick with that especially as the cost might not worth be worth the benefit. But in general given that there are dozens of hours to go, learning how to manage the pain is best.
</p>
<p>
Bonus: none of the receipts from Dr. Spiegel&#39;s office were initially accepted by my insurance.
</p>
<p>
For another perspective, someone else documented their experience of
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/gpc1cu/1st_session_genital_electrolysis_at_papillon/">the first session at Papillion center
</a>
</p>
<h2>
Time eater
</h2>
<p>
Hair removal eats up a lot of time. Days that I have hours of electrolysis are pretty much shot. You come home a wreck and try to sleep. The next day you are not in the best shape. And then what feels like just a few days later you do it again. You become friends with the person who does your electrolysis because you see them so very much. We spent so much time together we listened to several audiobooks together. This is a core thing that you are doing in your life for over a year. At my final session, I gave her a little thank you present.
</p>
<h2>
Not being able to see
</h2>
<p>
During an early electrolysis appointment, the entire time was clearing the perineum region. At home, I realized I could only see the area with a mirror. I had always known that I would need a mirror to see myself in the end, it is something else to experience what that feels like.
</p>
<h1>
Summary
</h1>
<p>
What to do for hair removal is a big open question and there are no clear answers. Having some hair post-op is common. You can find good outcomes with only scraping, only laser, only electrolysis, and combinations, but surgeons make no guarantees. This led me to try to learn as much about how the hair grows and how to improve my odds as much as possible by removing as much as I could before surgery.
</p>
<h1>
TLDR
</h1>
<p>
Because of hair growth cycles, you want to be clearing the area for 8 months minimum. Laser can only clear dark hairs, but any non-dark hairs (blond, red, grey etc) will still require electrolysis. If you do both consider alternating between the two to not double the time it takes.
</p>
<p>
If you are only doing electrolysis or you have a lot of electrolysis to do the following applies:
</p>
<p>
The first goal is to reach the point you can clear everything required in a single session. It can take around 10-30 hours of electrolysis to reach this point. Booking 8 hours a week will let you reach this point faster than 1 hour a week.
</p>
<p>
Once you can clear everything in a single session (often 2 hours a week or 3 hours every other week) you want to clear at every session for a
<em>
minimum
</em>
of 8 more months (because of hair growth cycles). After the 8 months continue getting anything that wasn&#39;t killed until near no new hair appears or you are okay with what is left to leave to the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
This whole process usually takes over a year with 18-24 months being common. If you are only doing electrolysis, expect it to be 60-100+ hours.
</p>
<p>
If you do not give yourself a year of no electrolysis to confirm you have zero hair growth you need to be mentally okay that you could have a few post-op.

This is version 2 of this post.  I posted the first version 9 months ago when I kept seeing misinformation and wanted to get something up with the basic math.  Since then I have learned a bunch more (more than a small edit) which has all been incorporated into this post.

Electrocautery by a surgeon or gynocologist.
</p>
<p>
Silver nitrate may also work and GP should be able to do it. Personally if I had that problem I’d be tempted to do it myself if I could only reach, but you also need to be very careful with it.

I wish surgeons were more up-front/honest about how long hair removal takes.  Every single one&#39;s paperwork says 6 months, but every electrologist I&#39;ve talked to says a year minimum, possibly up to 2.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had to cram mine out in 6 months, and thankfully I was a good candidate for lazer so that cleared up a lot, but we&#39;ll see in the end I suppose.

I am lucky enough to work with the Cleveland Clinics Reassignment team. The doctors are very educated and actually leave it up to me, (I am a electrologist) to say when they can make an appointment for intial consult. There hair has to be 70% gone before they can even make the appt

OP mentions breathing techniques; for me this was at least as effective at pain management as lidocaine cream was:

</p>
<p>
I had 2 hours per week from early August 2020 to mid-May 2021.  Minus three weeks in September.  Hit full clear in early December, have not shaved the surgical area since then.  Not as thorough as OP, but I still expect to be in good shape for PI in two weeks.

could I ask about your technique for applying lidocaine? I&#39;ve been doing a saran wrap thing but it&#39;s not always very effective and will wear off within ~45 minutes

I actually just had my electrolysis tech apply it at the start of a session, and we&#39;d work on my face for an hour first, which gave the lidocaine time to set.  It was definitely still effective after being on for an hour or so.

Excellent info--thank you!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been doing laser for the last few months, but I don&#39;t even have a consult until August. My insurance covers electrolysis for the purpose of clearing the area, and I asked the social worker at the surgeon&#39;s office how to deal with that. She said that I could get a referral from the surgeon when I go in for the consult, and that since it usually takes about a year between consult and surgery and it takes a year to clear the area with electrolysis, that should be fine.
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;m wondering if I should start now. But I am already doing laser, as I said, although it&#39;s hard for me to gauge how well that&#39;s working. It&#39;s frustrating, because it seems like most places do one or the other and not both, and I&#39;m hesitant to mix methods.
</p>
<p>
This is so complicated, between surgeons and insurance and hair removal and I already have a full-time job!

Thank you! I have a laser consult in a few weeks, but my surgery consult isn&#39;t until November. I feel much better prepared for when I speak to someone now.

Sorry if this is a naive question, but I’m just about to start doing Electrolysis in preparation for SRS - what do you do for an 8 hour long session? I can’t imagine what that could possibly be like. Are there breaks? Do you listen to music or podcasts or something?

When I did longer sessions we had a lunch break.  There is always music, but it was nice listening to audiobooks together.  All day sessions were to just get the process started, the majority of my sessions were shorter and often 3 hours in length, we still listened to our books during that time too.

Oh Gosh, I&#39;m truly honoured. There&#39;s more references to work I&#39;ve done in this post than I can shake a stick ( or a probeholder) at!  More so, your post demonstrates really well the concept of hair cycles of growth and how that affects your strategy for hair removal. And there are different stategies. But the takeaway is that complete removal of all hair starts at around 18 months REGARDLESS OF THE BODY AREA assuming you are establishing full clearance of all hair that comes in during that time frame. Your explanation of the hair growth cycles is very much spot on.  I&#39;d like to feature your blog on my web site , at
<a href="http://electrolysisbyseana.com">http://electrolysisbyseana.com
</a>
with your permission.  It&#39;s truly heartwarming to know that my preaching over the last few years has gotten trough to a few people! You&#39;ve made this humble electrologist truly proud! In reference to your work regarding lidocaine injections, I&#39;d only like to point out that here in canada we do not have an option for this.  For this reason most seeking this ( expensive!) service will need to go to chicago or texas.  Edit: I&#39;d like to link to this post on hairtell as well. I think there is a lot that can be learned from your thoughts.

Question: I&#39;m in the middle of electrolysis and i&#39;m finding that I have a lot of very thin, short, transparent/blonde colored hairs all over the surgery area, but especially going up the shaft.  I naturally have black hair but I guess I have some that are transparent; my electrologist thinks it&#39;s because I had a lot of prior laser, and the laser sessions burned the pigment away but left the hair.  They are very hard to spot, nearly invisible, in normal lighting you can&#39;t even see them they only show up under intense lighting and that&#39;s only if you are really looking very hard.  They basically look like fuzz, some are so small they can be mistaken for a dust particle lol.  I have to help my electrologist to spot the ones that grow around the shaft area, but I can&#39;t see the ones in the perineum area.  I&#39;m sure my surgeon would certainly miss them.  How absolutely critical are they to remove?  I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s even possible to completely get rid of them just because they are so incredibly easy to miss even under a spotlight, it&#39;s so easy to look at the area and be like, oh yup all done, but actually still have a number of those.
</p>
<p>
Also, the way I&#39;m doing electrolysis is an hour a week, sometimes up to 2 hours depending on scheduling, using just some basic numbing cream.  Each session is nowhere near a complete pass of everything.  I didn&#39;t know it was even an option to have &#34;local anesthetic&#34; and have an 8 hour long session.

I had the same thing starting around half way through my hair removal.  I am also guessing they are just damaged hairs that were not killed either from laser or electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
I stopped shaving so they would grow out longer and be easier to spot.  Not shaving was okay because we always cleared at every session so every session had only active hairs.  We used black dye a few times to make them pop, but that seemed more trouble than it was worth.  As for how critical, I don&#39;t know.  At some point, you have to say &#34;this is good enough&#34;.
</p>
<p>
The majority of my sessions were all done with numbing cream and on average 3 hours every other week.   You don&#39;t have to do 8 hour sessions all in one day.  Booking a one hour or 90 minute appointment every day will very quickly get you 8 hours of time.  Having a regular schedule to &#34;put in the time&#34; will get you a lot farther than trying to do a single long session.
</p>
<p>
If it isn&#39;t clear from my writing I am not a fan of the local anesthetic and wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

Did you clear away all your vellus hairs?  Some of the thin transparent hairs that I have are probably just that

The thin vellus hairs that are just a few mm tall I don&#39;t think she bothered with.  It is the thin clear hairs that end up being a cm or longer that we kill.
</p>
<p>
I did have a mix of red, blond, and dark hair at the start so at least for me I always knew I would have to kill these blond hairs.

I see, i&#39;ve been asking my electrologist  to focus a lot on the thin hairs that are literally 1 or 2 millimetres long.  probably vellus hairs, now that I think about it?  i figured that it&#39;s best to get the hard to see ones out of the way first.  Now I&#39;m thinking maybe I should just leave those and focus on the longer ones.

We’re going to have similar T levels to cis women so should have about the same possibility of terminal hairs.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure about bottom surgery. In principal it’s not necessary, but can’t say I’ve read anything on it. My impression is that women don’t do hair removal for bottom surgery properly anyway, and vellum hair is a step beyond that.

I have a question about missing a session:
</p>
<p>
So far I’ve had 8 sessions of intensive genital electrolysis (each 6 weeks apart). However, I have missed my last session of 1 hour and am wondering what is the best way to continue now.
</p>
<p>
The place where I go is fully booked most of the time, so the first possible appointment date would be 9 weeks after the missed session. Would it be better to go with that option (the first available date) and keep having sessions every 6 weeks after that, or to keep sessions on the original 6-week interval and book the next session 12 weeks after the missed one?

God damn so many steps are there to just getting srs. Like, I gotta get multiple referrals, fly to Thailand, pay around 30k upfront,  and now you&#39;re telling me I have to get laser on my privates. Every place I go won&#39;t even do it. So what am I just screwed if I go and haven&#39;t had it done

Maybe this will help
</p>
<p>
I am covered by Cigna Open Access Plus (GA). My plan pays for Electrolysis
</p>
<p>
&#34;Hair removal by electrolysis of donor site tissue to be
<br>
used to line the vaginal canal for vaginoplasty, limited
<br>
to eight 30-minute timed units per day (CPT Code 17380)
</p>
<p>
I have called Cigna to ask for a list of in network providers of this service, but they unfortunately cant conduct a search that is that specific. Their advice to me was to reach out to the surgeon that will be doing the vaginoplasty and have them give you a referral to someone in your area that does electrolysis for their patients. once you get that info then call you insurance to check if that provider is in network.
</p>
<p>
If they are not in network and there is legit no one around you that offers that service other than that provider your insurance can make a case for you and they might come to an agreement with that provider and cover the coast or some of it.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately we have to do a lot of foot work and be our own advocates Reddit is an invaluable resource in the process.
</p>
<p>
Also just try your best to find a company that offers insurance that covers these surgeries and put effort into getting a job there to gain coverage. 30,000 could be a down payment on a home etc. I work for H&amp;M and my insurance out of pocket maximum for a year is $1,500. That is the most I will pay a year for medically necessary in network procedures. Loads of companies have inclusive benefit packages now.

Question for the OP: You mention &#34;If you have 5000 hairs and kill 85% each time after 4 cycles you might have 3 that still survived&#34;. Where did the 5k hairs number come from, if you remember?

Hmmm been a while, but I could have easily just picked a number for easy math I can do in my head.  Might have googled how many hairs in a square inch or something.

Was your area waxed before electrolsis? If it wasn&#39;t then it should have been. I think Electrologists either don&#39;t know or don&#39;t recommend to wax because they want you to pay them for long. But seriously starting by waxing the area first means that they are only clearing active hairs and aren&#39;t wasting time trying to clear hairs that aren&#39;t in the growth stage.

Was speaking with my electrologist who does my face and who will be doing my groin soon and she said it makes her sad when her customers opt out of getting an area waxed because the rate that they get results is so inferior.
</p>
<p>
I got my face waxed and within 8 hours (1 hour per week) of electrolysis I&#39;m at the point where each week she&#39;s clearing upwards of 90% of what&#39;s there. Anything thats left that grows a little long that week (so visible without a magnifying lens) gets cleared up the next session.

Waxing a few weeks prior to laser also improves the results of that as well.

unfortunately, this is bad advice. Waxing removes active and inactive hairs that could otherwise be destroyed and prevents the electrologist from treating those hairs within the growth cycle . This has the effect of extending the period over which electrolysis must be performed by many years to effect permanency. Waxing is in no way permanent. Here&#39;s what my friend Michael Bono has to say about plucking, waxing and tweezing:

It is impossible to pull the entire root out with waxing, plucking or threading. Partial root always stays in. The root that stays in says &#34;oh I&#39;m injured, I need to become thicker, stronger and blacker. It can take up to 90 days for 1 hair that you pluck or wax to come back in. The hair takes up to 12 weeks to go through all 3 stages of growth. Unfortunately it just appears as if your area is cleared but wait until the 12 week mark after you waxed and see what comes back

I wasnt suggesting that the hair was removed permanently by plucking or waxing. Of course it will grow back. What I&#39;m saying is that thermolysis is more effective on hairs that are in the growing stage. Waxing an area means that the electrologist is only ever spending time working on growing hair, rather than hair that is in the resting phase. If someone spends an hour working only on hair in the growing phase they will produce better results than if they spent half of that one hour wasting time on hairs in the resting phase because it isn&#39;t obvious until the hair has been treated if it was in stage 1 or 2.
