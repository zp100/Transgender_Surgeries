Here&#39;s the timeline. This might be long winded. I also didn&#39;t post a lot of the early healing pics because you have to stop laser for at least 1 month pre op and while they say 1 month post it took me 3 months before I was willing to be seen in public post op so I didn&#39;t restart laser on my face for 6 months post and shaving was a pain so there are a lot of really bad pics.
</p>
<p>
Anyway first pic is at 23 years old pre everything. 2nd pic is at 26 pre everything. I had super hugh T levels for those 3 years and wanted to show what a T level that hovers around 500 pg/mol does to someone in 3 years. Also it&#39;s such a dramatic ending going from that.
</p>
<p>
The next pic is at 28 years old and 6months on HRT no makeup.
</p>
<p>
29 years old 1 year HRT and no makeup or filters.
</p>
<p>
The pic after is at 30 and 1.5 years HRT and a full face of makeup and no filters.
</p>
<p>
Followed by 31 years old 2.5 years HRT and no makeup or filters.
</p>
<p>
Next pic is also at 31 2 months later the day before FFS and was taken maybe a 5 minute drive from my surgeons office. I was wearing my Kenosha County jail pants (yeah that Kenosha, I grew up there).
</p>
<p>
The next pic is 1 hour before FFS and the last pic I took with that face.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s the long part of the post where I talk about what all I had done. I had a stage 1 hairline advancement as most of my jacked up hairline grew back in from HRT alone. I had a stage 3 chin reduction. I had a stage 2 forehead reduction and sculpt, and a stage 3 mid jaw reduction and sculpt but opted not to do anything to the rear jaw as I have always been a fan of a strong jaw corner. I had a stage 1 lip contour and didn&#39;t want too dramatic of a result. I had a stage 2 brow ridge reduction and a stage one eyesocket sculpt. I had a stage 2 nose bridge reduction and had my surgeon give my nose a modest upturn and he fixed my deviated septum while he was in there. I had a stage 2 brow lift. I didn&#39;t opt to do anything with my cheek bones because they are naturally high and amazing and I have always loved them. I did have some lipo and natural fat implants done in my lips, cheekbones, under my eye brows and under my eyes. A second round of that might be the only revision I have.
</p>
<p>
I saw Dr. Brian Rolfes in Wayzata MN. He is incredibly kind, and his offices staff are absolutely wonderful and were incredibly helpful through the entire process.
</p>
<p>
The next pic is 24 hours post FFS. And the reason I spoilered this.
</p>
<p>
The next 3 are all 2 months post op healing progress and ate left side, right side and center.
</p>
<p>
The next is a top center 3 month hairline heal progress.
</p>
<p>
The next is 5 months post op hairline.
</p>
<p>
The final pic is from yesterday and was my first post FFS full face pf makeup. And I am 11.5 months post FFS.

Usually insurance stuff, but it refers to how aggressive they get with certain things. Like a stage 1 jawline shave leaves room for revisions later. I have no room for revision really. But had an aggressive jawline and wanted it gone.

My biggest advice for FFS and healing (I know everyone has different goals and gets different things done) is if you get a hairline advancement do not itch it. That shit fucking itches for a solid 6 months, and even now at almost a year post op the nerves in the top of my head are still slowly waking up and it itches soo bad. Like crawl out of your skin, make it stop, it feels just bad.
