34yr old transwoman here! Just thought people would like to know that - I see lots of worries about post-op sensation/ability to climax. I had my first about five weeks after surgery, and have been easy to get off ever since, three minutes if needed. But sex is awesome with the right partner (or toy), and to the point, orgasms are unequivocally more euphoric and for much longer than before. Yes, you have to be in a desiring mindset/actually into your fantasies more than before, but that&#39;s never been hard, and only easier/better over the years.  Thought I&#39;d finally report on my very long-term findings.  üòÅ. Sorry for the throwaway acct
</p>
<p>
Edit: should&#39;ve added I know this isn&#39;t a universal result, of course, just want to add my two cents

OK, I&#39;ve been wanting to tell someone this for ages, so thank you this post. I&#39;m MtF and went to Dr. Brassard 15 years ago (because, being on the East Coast of the US at the time, he was just &#34;the one&#34; to go to). I&#39;ve been reading how unhappy some people are with appearance (i.e. essentially no inner labia) which is consistant with what I have and it&#39;s something I may have fixed, eventually. But there also seems to be anecdotal evidance for consistantly good orgasm ability from his work.
</p>
<p>
Ah where was I going with this... oh yes. My first orgasm happened the VERY FIRST time I dilated, meaning, yes, DAYS after surgery while still at the convalenscence house. The very nice nurse, an older woman, showed me the dilators and what to do with them. She left, and not long later, my goodness, what an unprecedented and surprising fusion of pain and pleasure. To be clear, it wasn&#39;t intentional, and it was entirely painful, but unmistakable an orgasm. It just happened.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, similar experience for me in the long term. Before surgery orgasms were a source of shame. I didn&#39;t lose my virginity until after, and the experience can be really, really wonderful as long as my brain doesn&#39;t get in the way somehow.

This exactly. Same with relative absence of inner labia, too, but I don&#39;t really think much at all about a labiaplasty...so many variations of a vagina, nbd there. Little bit more erectile tissue left that I thought he would, but the aesthetics are fine and I can have an order of magnitude better orgasms than I could as a guy...I see it as a great privilege rather than fixate on an imperfection :)
</p>
<p>
Love to hear about your early experience in the recovery house ü§£ I was east coast US too, and yeah, he was the go to guy at the time

How often do you need to dilate?

So see above for the first part, but the other interesting thing is I was functionally ace (still had fun on my own) for like three years and didn&#39;t dilate for most of that time (I know.). But when I started again, I was able to regain all lost depth/width within a few days. That was cool

Okay this is interesting and may also set some fears to rest. These days I just have sex or fuck some happy giant suction cup thing, I only dilate every few months. Stays tight, of course, so every time with something big is a little uncomfortable at first, but I don&#39;t mind, the less dilating the better. You can do what I did and get a thrusting, heated, suction dildo with a certain head shape that simulated all the dilator tips in one, if you catch my drift lmao...dilators begone

What&#39;s life been like since you got surgery? Like how did it affect dating and relationships for you?

So life is good, generally. I&#39;m an artist, writer, philosopher type so I just wanted to get past the body dysphoria so I could think straight...success there. Dating is a mixed bag cause I&#39;m an idiot and still try and date cis straight guys half the time, and that&#39;s trouble.  They don&#39;t have any questions about my vajay if I don&#39;t come out to them first, but I&#39;ve had some discomfort from the wrong guys when I tell them. Also a few times over the years I&#39;ve had to start with lube - with the wrong guy and not turned on,  if I&#39;m dysphoric/anxious, etc - but I don&#39;t go all the way till I come out to someone, not trying to be a statistic

For folks who orgasm easily after surgery, how was it before? I have an incredibly hard time orgasming with my partner (I think that requires me to be more present in my body than I can be right now maybe) but solo isn‚Äôt too bad most of the time bc I can just disassociate lol. I‚Äôm wondering if surgery helped people in a similar boat reach orgasm more easily / with less disassociation required.

Probably a partner or mental release thing then, no? If you&#39;re good on your own, the machinery&#39;s ready!

Yeah, it‚Äôs confusing lol. I think it‚Äôs dysphoria maybe? Like it‚Äôs hard to get into anything / get into it in my current body and I‚Äôm not even sure what I want a partner to do for me. My body likes my partner and gets hard but then it‚Äôs like ‚Ä¶ now what? I don‚Äôt actually want to use this really.
</p>
<p>
Whereas by myself I can sort of just fantasize about having a different body / being the woman on the screen and that usually distracts me from my own body enough I guess. I‚Äôm pretty much unable to fantasize about my actual self and never really could.

Only 7 months here. But I tried at 4 weeks and it just wasn‚Äôt getting there, things were very much still healing. Tried again at 6 weeks and eureka!
<br>
Definitely longer, stronger Os. They are a little harder to get. You have to be in the right headspace for sure.   Jealous of those that can get there from dilating though!

Yay!!! Have you gone on AliExpress and tried out the cutting edge (so to speak) of toys? I linked one above...they&#39;re truly premium quality for $15 with future tech that has taken mine to the next level lately, sex with a partner is honestly no better and probably a little worse lmao. I mean, it&#39;s symbolically better, but in terms of pleasure...

Hope the link isn&#39;t dead?  Btw I wouldn&#39;t have recommended this if it wasn&#39;t extremely high quality with zero indicators of cut corners, chemical trace odors, etc. Actually the highest quality toys I&#39;ve owned, my pet theory is they&#39;re all made by the same factories

Glad your doing well in that department!  I&#39;m 4 months post op and sometimes I try to cum for 2 hours and get nothing. I had a few orgasms earlier on in recovery but they weren&#39;t too great.
