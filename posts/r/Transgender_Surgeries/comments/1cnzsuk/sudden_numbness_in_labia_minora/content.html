UPDATE: After an ice pack for inflammation followed by a warm compress for blood flow, I can feel again! Iâ€™m putting this at the beginning so that anyone in the future with this same issue will know what worked for me. Ice and warm rags for a couple of days very much helps

Hey everyone, Iâ€™m at 6 weeks today, Iâ€™ll make a big update this evening, but I have a concern that I wanted to get some advice on.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™ve been straight up horny. Like, uncontrollably so. I tried using a vibrator and can come right to the edge of orgasm but never actually get there.
</p>
<p>
Well after my second attempt, I realized my labia minora was totally numb. That was about three days ago. The inner part has some sensation, but the outer part has none.
</p>
<p>
My liaison said that sensation coming and going is normal, and Iâ€™ve heard that using a vibrator too harshly can make you go numb for a day or so, but Iâ€™m terrified I broke something and now the nerves arenâ€™t gonna regrow properly or something, especially that itâ€™s been several days now.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone else had this issue? I could really use some reassurance

I can&#39;t speak to your exact situation - my bottom surgery&#39;s next month - but after FFS I lost sensation or had weirdness in sensation all over the place and only now at 4 months post op am I starting to feel anywhere near fully back to normal. Phantom itches on my scalp were a nightmare because I couldn&#39;t feel myself scratch them. Nerves are weird, you probably just caused some swelling that pinched them off. You&#39;re still healing.

I recovered 97% sensation at 3 months, had 1st orgasm at 4 months, then at 6 months and suddenly from one night to 4 am I lost almost all sensation in the vulva, perineum, and belly. Clitoral sensation was reduced too.
</p>
<p>
Two months before that, another girl from the US had the same sudden numbness. She told me that it came back slowly after doing some different sleeping positions, but she stopped replying.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have a clue about. But a neurosurgeon told me that it probably has to do with a vascular issue, irrigation to the nerves, let&#39;s say the Pudendal nerve, because that one is responsible for inervating the vulvar area and its surroundings. It could be trapped too. How? I have no clue. Six months after, is far away from the surgery itself, so I have no effing idea why this happened.
</p>
<p>
I have normal orgasms. And, I was diiagnosed with &#39;&#39;anhedonia&#39;&#39; by a surgeon ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„
</p>
<p>
How could I have anhedonia if I&#39;m fully orgasmic? Doctors most of the times say anything to us, but they have less clues than us!

Yeah, that worries me. ChatGPT recommended using a cold compress for any inflammation, followed by a warm compress for blood flow

It could be just a normal part fhe nerves healing/regenerating.  Are you sure they haven&#39;t been numb since surgery, and you&#39;re only aware of it now because other bits are waking up?  Six weeks post is still very early. I&#39;m 4 months and still have a fair bit of numbness, some intermittent. It can take nerves several months to heal and &#39;reboot&#39;   And TBH, I wouldn&#39;t overdo it with the vibrator at 6 weeks - slow and steady wins the day ðŸ˜œ.
