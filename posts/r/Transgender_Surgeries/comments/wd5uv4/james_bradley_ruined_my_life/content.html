Could we have a little bit more information? How long ago was this done? What was the initial plan? What else was done, if anything? What does Dr? Bradley have to say about your disappointment?

I&#39;ve been where you are. I&#39;ve seen the results of amazing revision surgery in this sub over the years. It took me three additional revisions over more than 2 years to get damaged repaired, but in the end I found the right surgeon and she made it happen. It&#39;s not that unusual to get a chin revision.

I would understand if you don&#39;t want to return to the same surgeon. You aren&#39;t required to do that. the question you should be asking people here is who do they suggest you look into that would be a good choice to fix it.

Absolutely this is possible, a competent surgeon can work with your face and achieve your goals. Keep in mind, though, that if there is a similar result where the surgeon dismisses your wishes and the outcome is different, it will increase your distress. To balance your approach, it might be best to see a mental health worker who can support you in making an informed decision, based on a surgeon who has a proven track record of patient care. I also need this as someone with mental health issues that requires support to communicate with my surgeons and health team. Dont go it alone. Identify what can reduce your distress and make one step at a time toward those goals.

I believe you can. Actually I know you can. Because you are strong and you are beautiful, use that and you can fix what he did and drag his reputation down into the mud as you undo what he did to your body and how he mutilated you.

Definitely not! I just mean he mutilated you by forcing the way you look upon you. I didn&#39;t mean it in a bad way towards how you look. I am so sorry if I offended you in any way!

You deserve to stick it out. You deserve to have your face returned to you. Someone already took your pride, and hurt you, and made you feel like you have expressed here. Do not help them do that to you after the fact. Do not beat yourself up for a decision you didn&#39;t know would hurt you. Do not say you&#39;ll never be beautiful, and that you&#39;ll never recover. You deserve to be happy once again, and you deserve to look in the mirror and see your own face. Someone hurt you and it is horrible and it is dire and disgusting of him that he did that you. But you are not a lost cause, and you are not beyond the realm of help, or anywhere near it. You can be helped, and it might take a long time to do it, but you can do it. It can be done. Let yourself reclaim your jaw and chin again, and do not remove yourself from the equation before you even have the chance to try and repair the hurt that was inflicted.
</p>
<p>
You deserve to be here, and you deserve to feel  beautiful. It&#39;s possible and you are not too far gone. Stay safe, okay? I love you as a fellow human being and I want you to be able to be happy again. You deserve that much and a lot more. Be safe tonight, and as long as possible. &lt;3 Sleep okay, if sleeping is hard right now. Try to rest your brain and body for now so you can recover a little, and then move forwards. I believe in you and so does everyone who commented here.

Your jaw line looks cute and femenine if anything it gives you  more of a unique exotic features why such a big fuss over this? I had my FFS with Dr Cardenas am I 100% happy not at all but we have to be realistic with expectations. One thing that I find troubling is this trend of women wanting that Barbie bimbo look and our narcissistic obcession with how we look its not healthy your face looks beautiful stop crying over the non existent flaw!!

Girl…. You need to
<strong>
relax.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Your entire face is well within female proportion. I actually wanted to go back to my surgeon and get a revision on my jaw so it would look like yours instead of it being so harsh and extending straight across all the way back to my ear.
</p>
<p>
I had complications in my chin so basically it ended up being square instead of round and i hate it but your chin is round and it isn’t massive like you think it is. I couldnt even figure out what you were upset about looking Dr your pics until I read what you wrote. If you want to have the chin brought back a bit, sure, go for it. I understand you are very upset but this shouldn’t be causing you to feel like you’re on your deathbed. It just shouldn’t. Not with how pretty and feminine you look, it’s just silly. I think you are
<em>
very
</em>
sensitive and so I understand that because I’m the same way. I have very intense anxiety and emotion and I’ve felt things that made me feel like what you feel right now. My FFS didn’t go perfectly how I wanted it either but we both look good. My chin got infected, it isnt round the way I wanted and it’s permanently fucking numb. Ur good sis. Seriously trust me sister.

I agree. My chin was done the same way and I have complete numbness. I have learned to live with it cause I&#39;m not gonna risk anymore problems. I also developed dangerous blood clots so no more surgeries for me for awhile!! I think her chin looks good as well. ❤

I have about 50% feeling in my bottom lip and my chin. I personally believe that it will come back completely after many years. I had a small cut in my lower gums when i was a kid that messed with my nerve so that every time I’d get startled my lip would quiver. I had it for a long time and then it went away. So when I went into this surgery I thought hmmm I might not respond well to this kind of invasiveness. Sure enough, I’m numb.
</p>
<p>
The infection however was 100% my fault. It’s a long story but it was definitely my fault. I don’t think my surgeon did anything wrong I still have full movement and partial feeling but I think I was just sensitive to this type of surgery. If I had him revise it I’d want him to go through under my chin instead of through the gums.  It’s already been a couple years so it’s technically “permenant” at this point but I can tell it’s slooowly getting a little tiny bit better with time and I think I will get the feeling back eventually. Nobody can tell I’m numb from looking at me or talking with me.

Is there someone you trust who can come over and be with you for a little bit? No one can stop your pain or change what the surgeon did. But perhaps some company would help ease the loneliness? I felt something similar after being raped as a child. The suicidal intent comes and goes for me. When it gets too much and I feel close to acting on my intent, I have a plan where I ask a trusted person to be with me. If that is not possible I always go to the nearest emergency department, call an emergency mental health crisis phone line, or knock on my neighbours door. Neither of us can change what happened but we can be with people who love and support us in the present.

I&#39;m sorry this is causing you so much trauma. No one likes to wake up to surprise surgery procedures that were done without consent.

Listen to me, the other trans girls you see with small chins and perfect jawlines are only the extremely lucky, most of us will always have a &#34;flaw&#34; that our dysphoria twists into a spear to stab is through the heart, the important thing is to see how your appearance is not a flaw, but a blessing. I say it is a blessing because when you see these people with perfect features, they probably haven&#39;t suffered anywhere near as much as those with supposedly imperfect features, and when you see people only seeing the flaws with their appearance, instead of the beauty those flaws contain it is a reminder that they are just as human as you are, which is amazingly beautiful, but you are still more beautiful for the fact that you have been able to hang on for so long when you only see your supposed flaws. You shouldn&#39;t need to worry about how you could have been beautiful, because you already are beautiful. You don&#39;t beg to think about how you could have been a beautiful girl, because you are already a beautiful girl.

Eh, it&#39;s just bone morphology, it can be changed. Nothing is irreversible. Consider going via FacialTeam, they do CT scans and draw on them to show how it&#39;s all going to work. You can tell them exactly what you want. Did James Bradley do something similar?
</p>
<p>
Stay solution focused and keep moving forward. Thank you for sharing your experience though. Do you have any residual numbness, was your mentalis nerve very close to the edge already - that&#39;s the only reason I can think, outside of his routine, why he might try to avoid the area?

Ok I need you to please listen to me here. When I look at those pictures I don&#39;t see anything masculine, all I see is a beautiful woman who, like most of our species, cannot appreciate their own beauty. You are beautiful, you are loved, you are NOT masculine looking. Please do not end your life, please don&#39;t hide your beauty from the world just because some stupid doctor changed your face. Your face is still feminine, your face is still feminine like yourself, just in a less obvious way. I beg you to please go to someone who can help you see this and love who you are, because you are beautiful.

This 👏🏼 ⬆️…also I don’t know where your at financially . Do lots of research of surgeons who perform revisions , who can work with ur insurance or payments. Also report the surgeon to one of the mods on this Reddit . If you can afford a lawyer to sue him I’d go ahead ! I hope you continue to fight your depression , keep hope ! 💖💖💖

You can go to another doctor to solve the problem for you instead of killing yourself . Just save money and go to a good doctor . It is easy these days.

We (most humans) usually can&#39;t fully appreciate our own beauty, but specifically because we compare ourselves to others and create standards to compare ourselves to.
</p>
<p>
The most important thing to remember is there are no &#39;standard&#39; traits, there is a spectrum. Be careful of thinking in black-and-white (I&#39;m not beautiful)
</p>
<p>
catastrophising (I will never be beautiful)
</p>
<p>
magnifying ( because my Y looks &#39;Z&#39; to
<em>
me
</em>
that means I&#39;m Z and therefore neither X nor beautiful)
</p>
<p>
and
</p>
<p>
minimizing (even though most of me looks the way I want and like, it doesn&#39;t matter because of one detail)
</p>
<p>
These thoughts aren&#39;t true and will eat away at your mental health if you don&#39;t get them under control.
</p>
<p>
Do some self CBT therapy or connect with someone who can help you to do so because if you don&#39;t, besides eating away at your mental health, any cosmetic work you get done again or not won&#39;t make that big of a difference if you continue to compare yourself on a microscopic level to others so intensely that your ability to see yourself accurately is compromised.
</p>
<p>
And I&#39;m not going to convince you that your face looks feminine or you look beautiful because you probably won&#39;t believe it right now or care but to me, it does. And yes, to me, you are.
</p>
<p>
Big love to you sista

Honestly honey you look pretty to me. I know that the gender dysphoria is so real and so hard to overcome. Us women have a load on our shoulders and pressure to conform to societal standards. You are beautiful. You are loved. You are cared about. You can overcome this. You matter. Your life matters. I’ve been in your shoes, where the depression feels suffocating and feel like there’s no way out, no way to overcome what we’re struggling with. But it does get better. I’m one to talk because I’ve never been happy with the way I look, but I know that I’m more than a pretty face, just like you are. I know this is overused but it’s true: suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. You can overcome this. You are a strong beautiful woman who still has lots to do in this world. It’s not over yet for you. The best is yet to come. Get a second opinion, research more, talk to others, reach out to a close friend. Don’t do anything to yourself please! You can do this, I promise you ❤️

i know how you feel as keojampa ruined my chin and people really can&#39;t understand how this part affects the whole face , even more than a forehead because you can&#39;t hide it, but it does and it can really bring you so down. I see what you are talking about with the Step-off and it being wide. The good thing in your pic is that it seems like bradley did not do t-osteotomy to narrow it in anyway? So there is still a lot of bone and it can all be redone to give you that smaller V-chin, if that is what you want so it should be fixable. It would be way worse if he shaved the shit out of your chin and there was no option to fix anything but it doesn&#39;t seem to be the case and you have the options still. please hang in there.

I have seen absolutely incredible transformations from Keo and I’ve seen really fucking confusing ones. It’s very strange I almost feel like he takes some patients a lot more seriously than others. He’s taking on way too many patients.

Please listen to me when I say this. You can still be beautiful because you are beautiful. You had no way of knowing the surgeon would do this. You had no way of knowing what the results of the surgery would be, or how you would like after it, however no matter how it could have gone, you still would have come out as beautiful, because even if the result isn&#39;t what you wanted, you are beautiful and you are stunning. Your face may not be feminine in the way you wanted it to be but it is still just as feminine as it would have been, just I&#39;m different ways. Please do not end your life, you have so much to give this world.

Even if you don&#39;t want Dr Bradley to fix it there are capable surgeons who could. You should make that effort and consult with one of them. I think your jawline is great.

You say your potential is gone, but you also say that your life story can warn others to avoid the surgeon. Then why not use your life to actively warn them, you can reach a lot more people that way. If you can bring his reputation down and rid the world of a man who offers fake promises, your story can inspire others to rise up against the injustices society has handed them. You may not look the way you wanted but you are still a beautiful girl. Please, do not let this man destroy you, that would be letting him win, please turn your hatred of him into conviction to reignite your potential, it has always been there, the embers just haven&#39;t reached it yet.

So sorry to hear what you went through :( If he moved your chin forward against your wishes, is there no way you can sue for malpractice? I don’t understand why any doctor would bring the chin forward or do a chin implant for FFS, but some seem to do it.
</p>
<p>
If it makes you feel any better, i think you still look very feminine and it’s ok to be unhappy with what he did without meaning you don’t look female.

First of all, I am so fucking sorry! This is absolutely horrible, going specifically going against what you wanted. Do you think there was anything malicious involved?
</p>
<p>
I had a similar experience with my grs, my surgeon, (C. Salgado, FL), who is a freaking
<strong>
board certified surgeon
</strong>
, the gold standard in America, and regarded in the surgical community as, &#34;world renowned&#34; in transgender surgeries.
</p>
<p>
I saw before and after pictures that I only found out later were of actual cis women, wasn&#39;t fully informed about the risks and % and types of complications that could occur, went in expecting at least a few inches of depth and woke up to find that&#39;s not what happened. That&#39;s just the beginning.
</p>
<p>
I think I was just in shock afterward and figured once the swelling went down everything would be ok. And when it wasn&#39;t, I was treated by his staff as if I was a problem.
</p>
<p>
Have you talked to your surgeon? What does he say?
</p>
<p>
The first thing you need to do is get consults from different surgeons for a revision. And see what they say about what he did to you. I went to multiple who told me there wasn&#39;t much that can be done but maybe for you there&#39;s an option?
</p>
<p>
Second, you should think about filling a complaint, even if you think there was nothing malicious involved. This is far enough away from what you wanted that this man shouldn&#39;t be touching other people.

Sorry you’re struggling but I honestly don’t see anything that bad. Maybe you could discuss it with your Doctor. Hope you feel better you’re beautiful!

I don’t know if this will make you feel better but I spent a good 10 minutes trying to understand what was even wrong. And had to look at a bunch of comments before finally understanding what you were upset about. I’m really sorry you didn’t get the results you wanted but no hugboxing, your chin or your jawline or any feature I can see in the pictures read male to me in the slightest.
</p>
<p>
But I hope you can achieve the smaller chin you want anyway
</p>
<p>
All the love in the world
