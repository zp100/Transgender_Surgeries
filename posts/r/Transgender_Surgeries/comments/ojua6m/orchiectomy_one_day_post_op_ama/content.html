Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm still feeling lousy, but so far it looks like a best case scenario. I had minimal blood on the wound packing I removed before showering this morning, and I‚Äôve noticed no bleeding since either. I‚Äôm already back to wearing normal panties, just with liners, and it looks and feels great to be rid of those two nuisances. üòä

I can‚Äôt say yet how it will affect my E and T levels, since I already had E and T in line with cis women. HRT got me there quickly, so I don‚Äôt expect a dramatic shift.
</p>
<p>
The pain is more intense than I expected, but it‚Äôs still only moderate. The incision site is more tame, but where the spermatic cords were cut is the worst. It feels like one last kick in my now non-existent balls, except the pain doesn‚Äôt go away.  I‚Äôm glad to take taken time off work for recovery. I‚Äôm on norco/Vicodin and have been taking that regularly.

Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è Orchi is an important step for me in deciding if I want vaginoplasty later. I checked out your profile. Did you do orchi first also?

To add to this, I‚Äôm about 1.5 years out and my skin is still stretchy. It‚Äôs wrinkly and hugs my body but I think it still has at least 90% of the original skin.

I don‚Äôt think this is a major concern. I‚Äôd recommend getting a consultation for orchi and asking this specific question. For bonus points, get a bottom surgery consult and ask them the same question. Obviously skip on scrotectomy, since that will minimize the tissue available.
</p>
<p>
There are also vaginoplasty techniques like PPT that are less reliant on genital tissue.
</p>
<p>
Low dose topical T and stretching the tissue can help preserve it too if you decide you want vaginoplasty later.
</p>
<p>
PS: Spiro‚Äôs side effects suck! See if you can go on bicalutimide as an alternative T blocker.

It is, but it‚Äôs not awful either. I can get around, albeit slowly, and today is already lots easier than yesterday. I‚Äôm expecting tomorrow to be easier and milder, but I expect to be on reduced mobility for at least a week.
</p>
<p>
If it helps, orchi is one of the milder surgeries for trans people. I would say to go for it. ‚ù§Ô∏è If you haven‚Äôt had other surgeries before, it‚Äôll also help you gauge your tolerance for surgery and recovery.

Irs not long. Maybe a week, maybe two but it was greatly subsided by then.
</p>
<p>
In all honesty I believe my orch was more painful than both my zero depth and my canal addition later on. I am of mindset that having orchy when you have gcs is where a lot of pain comes from. Seems the chord cutting combined with that kicked feeling produced the most pain of anything for me.
</p>
<p>
My zero depth was a breeze, and besides having to take it easy for a few weeks to allow sutures to fully heal, it was a walk in the park. My canal addition - the same except I have wound separation that is extending healing time. That has mostly been the pain I&#39;ve had to deal with so far on this recovery.
</p>
<p>
The whole process for all three procedures is definetly uncomfortable. But in the end it was all totally worth it.

Nope! My surgeon actually won‚Äôt do a scrotectomy because he wants people to keep the tissue available for vaginoplasty if they decide they want it later. The recovery is also milder without scrotectomy. Either way, I wanted just the orchi to keep my options open for later.

An orchiectomy never removes scrotal tissue, it is literally only the testes and spermatic cord that is removed. A scrotectomy is a seperate procedure that can be performed at the same time, but not usually performed in combination.

That looks great! Be sure to keep pressure on it for a few days to keep the swelling down, and cycling ibuprofen/acetaminophen every 4 hours helps with the pain. I remember it feeling like someone kicked me with a steel-toed boot and left the boot inside, lol.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm glad you haven‚Äôt had much bleeding/discharge from the incision area! That‚Äôs a really good sign :)

That looks very good. I am hoping that my parts down there will shrink so that I don&#39;t have a bulge in tight leggings any more. I&#39;m planning Orchi as well and possibly GRS if the shrinkage from HRT wont be enough.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask you if you had any reduction in penile size with HRT?

Thank you! I‚Äôm glad I shared, so I can help others make informed choices. Orchi should remove a lot of the bulk between your legs, and it‚Äôs pretty great for both people who‚Äôve fully suppressed their T and who are struggling to do so. For me, my testes were basically shut off and not doing anything, but for others, they can finally get off blockers and give their transition an additional push.
</p>
<p>
My size hasn‚Äôt seemed to have changed much, at least not yet, but I‚Äôm also only about a year+ into HRT. Obviously for these pics I‚Äôm unaroused. üòÖ
</p>
<p>
I want to maintain the tissue in case I want vaginoplasty later, so I make it a point to continue to masturbate (although much less often than before), and I have topical T to combat atrophy, though I don‚Äôt use it consistently.

Thanks for the reply :)  I&#39;m on E2 Monotherapy for 10 months now and my T is suppressed perfectly. For now I lost 3cm erect and a little less than 1cm flaccid.

Right now everything just feels a bit swollen and sore, but the penis has internal structures to keep it in place. Either way, my balls will not be missed. üòõ

I was honestly tempted to just ignore your comment for privacy reasons, but it looks like you‚Äôre a moderator here that helps maintain the wiki. That‚Äôs important work, and I really appreciate what you and others do to maintain that resource.

I had my surgery with Dr Kowalczyk, a urologist in Los Angeles, CA, and my experience has been overall positive. I found him as a referral from my amazing endocrinologist.
</p>
<p>
I selected him over another doctor, a plastic surgeon and referral from my amazing therapist, because Dr Kowalczyk was dramatically less expensive and I had to pay out of pocket. I also felt that orchiectomy was not so complex where I needed to select only the best I could afford. Dr Kowalczyk also fought (though ultimately failed) to get my surgery approved by my insurance despite the exclusion on my policy, which I appreciated.
</p>
<p>
The state of trans healthcare in the USA can be really stupid. It really depends on your employer, even if you live in a more progressive state that has protections in place, since large employers have the ‚Äúself funded‚Äù loophole.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I intend to make a follow up post about my recovery. It hasn‚Äôt been a smooth ride, but I‚Äôm still very happy with my decision. I‚Äôm more than a little scared about recovery if I choose to get bottom surgery though.

Over $20K is crazy! I paid about $3K out of pocket. Check with urologists in your area.

Happy for you! Did you get a scrotectomy? Any issues going #1 or #2 (bathroom)?

Thanks! My surgeon won‚Äôt even do scrotectomy because he doesn‚Äôt want people to regret it if they pursue bottom surgery later, but I only wanted orchiectomy regardless for that same reason. Scotectomy has a longer, more difficult recovery too.
</p>
<p>
No bathroom issues post surgery whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
It looks like you‚Äôre considering orchi and wanting to leave the door open for bottom surgery later, so I‚Äôll add some advice: Go for the orchi, skip the scotectomy, and any credible doctor should be fine for orchi. Don‚Äôt endure a long wait list for a simple procedure. See my comment above talking about my choice of doctor.
