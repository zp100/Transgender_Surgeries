I don&#39;t get why they would remove them without seeking medical consent? Unless those organs were already damaged during surgery.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I will opt for open surgery for mine then.....

They were.
<br>
I was always infertile and found out when I was 20. I started having hormonal issues. All stemmed from childhood trauma and abuse. I’m from a small town area in the deep south and being LGBT+ is looked down upon.  I always had to fight and be in survival mode.

Not “beat up” more like being a scapegoat to grown adults (drug addict mother/ absent father) - both parents were absent and didn’t want to be parents. I grew up homeless having to house hop and couch surf, bathe and eat at my families houses. As a child, my family members were physically, mentally, emotionally unstable, dysfunctional, narcissistic, VERY abusive, crackheads, cokeheads, meth heads, heroine addicts and everything else all having mental illnesses, bipolar schizophrenia, and and every mental illness that they ould collect a welfare check from, yet everyones a bible thumping Christian overseer who “lived right” but projected their inferiority and dictated how I showed myself to the world using iblp /ati crazy Christian Conservative principles. I used to get beat and abused for nothing. A majority of everyone on my mom side which were mostly women are drug addicts, and/or pickmeishas, -Envious jealous low self esteem “washed up” weirdo ass women who obviously don’t love themselves. - (especially an older messy, big Linebacker built, big backed bad body built, slow ass, mentally toxic female cousin of mine who about 2-5 years older me, still living with her mom, and raising her kids in the same room that she grew up in, who&#39;s brother is a crackhead and a pedophile, and she Talks about EVERYONE!!!!) Them hoes love to stick together in cliques and love to start drama and mess, and the type of women who will get you set up or even killed over spreading lies and bs over their jealousy) crab in the bucket mentality minded and child predator/molesters/ registered sex offenders. I don’t have anything negative to say about my dad side, but my dad just wasn’t there and used excuses not to step in and be a responsible man/ FATHER when my mom was tweaking on crack, meth, crystal and every drug she could try because she was bored. His excuse was he was paying Child support and that the courts wouldn&#39;t allow him custody. Knee grow! GET FKIN REAL!!!! Everyone knows my mom is an addict even the judge. Honestly, I felt like He was too embarrassed of his children, and the women he reproduced with and wanted no ACTUAL parts in our lives other than us NOT knowing him, BUT knowing OF him. He did what “Pookies and Kangs” do and that was RUN and avoided being a father to ALL HIS CHILDREN. I was a scapegoat and a black sheep. I was ALWAYS violated and had to fight and fend for myself. Both at home, at school, and in my hometown in public growing up.  Ive delt with Neglect, physical, emotional and sexual abuse and being molested alot either by my mom’s “STRAIGHT male friends” or incest…etc male cousin who smokes with my mom (15-16y/o than me). The damage was sustained from being abused as a child. LOTS of abuse! Im currently seeing a therapist and have been diagnosed with Chronic C-PTSD and trauma, and have epilepsy due to the trauma.…. This only put the icing on the cake......I&#39;ve cut all ties and moved on with my life..... Im recovering slowly but surely.

Very interesting story, thank you for sharing. A lot of people find out they are intersex as adults by surprise during surgery or fertility testing, so you are certainly not alone in that! It’s also great that Jun handled the more complex surgery well

OMG! Thank you for sharing this! I I&#39;m currently going through something very similar, but we&#39;re in the stages of figuring out what all is where. I really, really, really appreciate being able to see your procedure and hear about your experience. Would it be okay for me to reach out to you and ask some questions?

Oh, thank you for sharing! I&#39;m 46,XX/47,XXY. I have a functional ovary (I think, I&#39;m off HRT now to see where I land on my estradiol levels on my own). I also have a presumably healthy uterus as my MRI showed. I do menstruate, but through the urethra.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/11gqumu/question_about_the_atrophy_cream/">I don&#39;t have a lot of material
</a>
. The outlook to lose the uterus and ovary also scares me.When did you find out about your intersex condition?

I found out 5 days after surgery. I LITERALLY didn’t physically suspect it, and never had any thoughts about it due to not really knowing what intersex was or at least meeting an intersex person.  But I always KNEW I was female internally because growing up something just never sat quite right with me and I was on the quest to find answers and fix the issue by any means necessary. Thats what lead me to start transitioning as a teen.

I have a very similar experience with the transition. I&#39;ve got very visible gyno early on and superwide hips.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m surprised that they did karyotyping, I guess as part of pathology? I&#39;m also surprised the surgeon did not question lack of one testicle before the surgery.

Unfortunately, I am unable to conceive as I no longer have a womb. However, my doctor mentioned that with a uterus transplant, there is a possibility for me to become pregnant, although the delivery would have to be done through a c-section. Personally, I am not interested in pursuing that option. I am content and at peace with myself and fully accept myself for who I am.

Was the transplant option brought up because you&#39;re intersex or is it open for all of us?

It was only brought up as a possibility because I’m intersex, however I have no desire to have children or participate in any childbearing experiments or processes.

Now that&#39;s interesting. I wonder how much of it is being gate kept due to societal bias.
</p>
<p>
What I mean is, despite being intersex you were born AMAB and presumably had your body effected by testosterone in some way right? So you&#39;d likely face most of the same kinds of issues &#34;biologically male&#34; trans women would. I also don&#39;t think it would make any difference in terms of anti rejection meds because that is part of every transplant. Still doctors saw it as a viable option for you but not most trans women.

So many trans people are finding out that they’re intersex Vice versa intersex people being trans the correlation needs to be studied more. What if trans people are all intersex but at varying degrees?

The only thing I can advise is that Dr. Jun uses EVERYTHING! Regardless of your size. And preserves ALL the nerves, so you’re gonna have feeling throughout. He has a youtube video explaining the process and his method.  I believe it’s under “Crane center Transgender surgery “

He accepts insurance 😊 Trust me. It’s cheaper to spend $5k-$10k a year on a medical insurance policy he accepts than flying overseas.

It’s not the only factor, for sure, but I’ve never had insurance for $10k a year that actually covered all expenses. 😅

If I went overseas it would be as much to go there, as well as much cheaper/quality longterm after care/recovery.

I said the same thing 😂 ‼️ I SAID DAMN‼️😂🤭 Thats a full payment for a triple wide 4br/3ba mobile home, utility hookup and 2-3 acres of land with a fence somewhere down south. But overall idgaf‼️ im fully satisfied, im at peace, and I LITERALLY  can go outside naked and run down the street like a crackhead or a drunk and not be embarrassed. ( sorry for the humor- but thats how happy i am.) im super high key proud to say my pussy worth a quarter a million 💸💵💰too lol 😂 (I guess for the bragging rights 😂💁🏽‍♀️). But overall its a huge releaf and a huge burden that I can now release and LIVE my life authentically.. I feel complete and really like myself. 😇 so I say its worth it every penny‼️✨💯

Thank you for sharing your story. Your results look fucking GREAT! I’m AFAB but my best friend is trans and I’ve been doing a lot of research for her as well to understand better. Not going to lie I’ve seen some results from cheaper docs that is.. not so great 😞 and that makes me very sad for the patients. I’d rather my bff pay more and get a better result than pay less and get a bad result. I feel like you literally get what you pay for. Congrats on your 🐱!! She looks great! 💕🙌🏼

That’s made up insurance money prices. Just about no one would pay that personally.

What I meant wasn’t that you could pay less, just that all the patients are insurance cases. I don’t know if you can go with that surgeon for a reasonable price. There’s been bills far higher than that in the USA too.

<p>
Look at Dr Bank in Thailand.

Yea dr bank is very reputable and like 20k(which is still alot) i plan on graduating and then getting really good insurance so i can get cheaper in america. But if far right republicans get their gilead and outlaw surgery i plan on saving the 20k anyways or finding a reputable dr in mexico/canada.

You never know. From my understanding. Some girls do‼️ His list back in 2022 was backed out til 2025. For self pay his down payment is $23,000. - which is about the same you’d pay if you were to go overseas.  I forgot how he explained the self pay option but, he stated that he does get a discount for renting the hospital room and equipment so it’ll be $168,140 that includes room and board, equipment and hospital fees etc. We also did talk about the overseas procedures advising that you know it’s up to you, however, most patients end up spending a lot more going back overseas for any type of revisions

I plan on it. I wanted to be as honest as possible with the outcome and show the “ugly but less gruesome” photos first. Im keeping the “Good” photos for myself because the chasers and fetishizers especially ……be on a whole different level of mental illness and toxic obsession when it comes to a transwomans genitals and it’s starting to be sick and annoying 🤨🙄 And don’t be nervous‼️ you’re gonna be sleep and wakeup like it was already there. Best of luck and praying for you to have a healthy, safe, and speedy recovery ❤️‍🩹 ❤️🫶🏽

Now that makes me sad... I&#39;m not from the US, I wanted to have this surgery with him (well I don&#39;t have both sets of organs, just regular mtf srs) but I&#39;m pretty sure I won&#39;t get 230k
