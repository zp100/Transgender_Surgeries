I’m starting the process of getting ffs with facial team in Marbella, I thought I would get an online appointment with Dr. Simon or Dr. Capitán but instead got offered one with Dr. Raul J. Bellinga and I wanted to ask if I should say yes or if there’s a difference and I should ask for an appointment specifically with one of the other two? Since of course I want to have the best opinion possible and opportunity to discuss my case.
</p>
<p>
If it makes any difference my main focus I think will be my chin and jaw, but of course I have no idea what they’ll suggest since they have more experience and I would most likely go for what they say, that’s why I’m asking if I should ask for another doctor for the online consultation.
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much in advance!
</p>
<p>
Edit: just emailed asking to have it with them instead, however afterwards I was told Dr. Bellinga does the first consultations so if they say no it would be fine I think
</p>
<p>
Edit 2: got an appointment with Dr. Simon

I do not think it matters which surgeon does the consultation.
</p>
<p>
I had my first consultation which was by Skype and by chance it happened to be with Dr Simon.  Much later, I had a second consultation, also by Skype, and this time with Dr Raoúl Bellinga when we went into more detail.
</p>
<p>
After I had the estimate, I sent it to Alexandra Hamer of virtualffs and her report was very informative.  I went for three views and the results came back showing the various stages of the surgery.  I then sent this to Facialteam as further information.
</p>
<p>
My pre and post op consultations were with Dr Raoúl and they were both very enjoyable.  My surgery, which included breast augmentation which was performed by Dr Kai, was at the end of March.  It lasted about 11 hours.  I would not have wanted one surgeon to work for such a long time.
</p>
<p>
After two nights in the hospital, I was only ever on ibuprofen and an antibiotic.  I did not have any pain.
</p>
<p>
It is now nearly two months since the surgery and I am delighted with the results.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps.

Oh, I didn’t know that. I already emailed to ask if I could have it with Dr. Simon or Dr. Capitán, but if they say no then at least I know it’s fine with Dr. Bellinga, thanks so much! I was unsure because I don’t want to do rhinoplasty so that’s why it made more sense to ask for someone else.

If you can afford it travel to them. They make you a free of charge appointment. You will get a better insight what’s possible. They make scans, photos and show you a morph, virtual ffs result.
</p>
<p>
Btw, I’m sitting right now in Marbella, just waiting for the taxi service to get me to the airport. I’m post surgery. 😅

Being that they&#39;re in the same clinic they probably do this a fair bit, if I were in your position though I would want the consultation to be done by the person doing the surgery.

The thing is I don’t know yet who that’ll be since it’s the first consultation in which they tell you which procedures you would need, after that I don’t know who does what or how that’s decided.

I guess just take it a step at a time, but be sure that once you know which doctor is supposed to be performing the surgery that you get a chance to talk with them directly first.

Speaking from personal experience, for me it supposedly made *all* the difference. I was entirely taken by the great attitude Dr. Simon and Dr. Powers showed in their YT video. However, I didn&#39;t have neither one of them during my personal consultation in Marbella, and based on my experience there, I decided that I wouldn&#39;t be going with FT ― way too many red flags for me, in particular regarding the doctor I had my consultation with.

I wouldn&#39;t go with Bellinga as it&#39;s outside his sphere of competence (he&#39;s a rhinoplasty surgeon), that and he won&#39;t be able to communicate matters effectively. I did have mine with Bellinga too but it became apparent that I had to read between the lines and probe on certain matters. He&#39;s very charming, make no mistake.
</p>
<p>
There isn&#39;t as much cross-communication between the team members as you might think and if, when you arrive in person, find yourself, the days before surgery, talking about anything other than your nose with him, it&#39;s a wasted conversation - stuff doesn&#39;t get passed on ;] His cognitive load should be confined to your requirements around the rhinoplasty.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d
<strong>
really
</strong>
push for Dr. Simon or Dr. Capitán, even if there&#39;s a fee.

Thanks! This is exactly what I wanted to know, I will then ask for an appointment with one of them. Just for particularity, which one of the two would be best?

Yeah, I got one with Dr. Simon, which is great since my main interest is jaw/chin :) but I would’ve been okay with any for this part, although I’m happy I got it with him for said reasons

Dr. Bellinga does only rhinoplasty, no other procedures. Facialteam has a lot of surgeons in the team, not only 3. They discuss your case together.

He does all the soft tissue procedures from what I understand. I was with Facial team 2 weeks ago and he did my otoplasty and submental liposuction. He also did another girl&#39;s lip lift and blepharoplasty.
</p>
<p>
I agree it&#39;s worth talking to Dr Simon or Dr Capitan though.

Yeah, they are the founders. 😅 I had surgery with them last week. Dr. Bailón and Dr. Capitan worked on me. I was told so that Bellinga is the nose job man, idk, rhinoplasty is not only soft tissue procedure, check your CT scan! 😉

Fair enough. I&#39;m very happy. There&#39;s a clear difference in my forehead, eyes and ears. The swelling around my chin is still there though so it will likely take a few months before I&#39;m seeing the final result there. So staying patient but excited!

So it would make sense to ask to speak with a different doctor then? Since I’m not interested in rhinoplasty, I mean I know they decide together but I can only speak with one for the online consultation

Ask for a maxilofacial surgeon. But they discuss your case together. There’s hardly any chance to get a first consultation with your final surgeon. They make 30 patients per month at least. There’s a lot of surgeon in the team, not only 3.
</p>
<p>
Btw, they share the procedures during the surgery. They change surgeon after one is finished.

I consulted Dr. Simon first, and then Dr. Bellinga.  I think you made the right choice, even though Dr. Bellinga is very well informed about all of the procedures.  I plan to go there in person as well, as that should make things much clearer.  I wonder if everyone gets put up in the spacious villa shown in the pictures, or some patients in other hotels that are part of the same chain.
