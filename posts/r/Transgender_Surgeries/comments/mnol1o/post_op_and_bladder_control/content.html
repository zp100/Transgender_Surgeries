Real talk here because this isn&#39;t something anyone ever mentions, is how different using the bathroom is. Like you get no primer on this. But, how long did it take any other girls here to learn like proper &#34;holding techniques &#34; when it comes to using the bathroom after vaginoplasty? Because I&#39;m like 9 weeks out and while still well into healing, am still having quite a few very very close calls and one or two times where I haven&#39;t exactly made it in time.

My bladder is much much stronger post op.
</p>
<p>
One thing they had me do once as the catheter came out was hold for 30mins when I needed to go to retrain the bladder and holy hell has it worked. I&#39;ve been able to go a good 3 hrs on average before needing to pee and even managed 5 hours once.
</p>
<p>
Pre surgery I&#39;d get a lot of bladder anxiety etc but now that&#39;s all behind me üòé

See I had a rather weak one before I started hrt and the super high dose of Spiro for 6 years didn&#39;t help any lol.  Like I was an every 30 to 45 minutes. So I&#39;m like really trying to figure this one out as now that I&#39;m off Spiro I really dont to do that anymore lol

I wondered about this too, but for me at least it was basically the same post-op. You relax the same muscles to start the flow and &#39;clench&#39; them to stop it.
</p>
<p>
The urine appears sooner because the urethra is significantly shorter after surgery, and then there&#39;s the spraying from swelling after surgery. For me this improved with healing, but it&#39;s still a slightly messier exercise than pre-op.
</p>
<p>
My bladder control is the same or possibly even slightly better post-op. X

Kegel exercises are the thing if you&#39;re not already doing them. I did some in the run up to my surgery and after.
</p>
<p>
You should speak with your surgeon, get them to check there are no other issues. X

I live a few states away from my surgeon lol. But yeah my next virtual appointment I&#39;ll mention it for sure. As for the kegels that&#39;s probably a very very good idea.

I think this depends on each person , I was able to control my bladder &amp; pee a perfect stream as soon as the Cather was out 5 days post op . Haven‚Äôt had any issues since , barely need toilet paper after . I would think the bladder is the same as before surgery ? At least to me it doesn‚Äôt feel any different if I have to pee I have to pee , but I can also hold it till I‚Äôm ready just like before .  Maybe practice holding it and releasing it while you are in the toilet to get the control back . I was told you‚Äôre bladder gets ‚Äúlazy‚Äù from being dependent on the catheter for so long , So you have to train in back. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The bladder is the same but controlling the pelvic floor muscle feels completely different to me. Idk I&#39;m just like I don&#39;t feel like I know what I&#39;m doing anymore. üôÉ

Oh mine is awesome --Thanks to the medications I have to take because of the nerve damage.  That should tell you how much control I have. I&#39;ve been through PT twice. I&#39;ve had Urodynamics testing and I&#39;ve tried all kinds of other methods to get control, but I cannot. It&#39;s been like this from the moment I got out of surgery. I just kept waiting and waiting and waiting for it to heal. Four years later, I&#39;m sunk without Flomax and vesicare to control my bladder and urethra. Cool huh?

Hell, I was dealing with that right out of the box. I Worked on it everyday hoping I was getting somewhere. Sometimes I thought I was, but it was wishful thinking. Gallagher just kept telling me it would heal, or all I needed was Pelvic floor work. Now, no one will touch it. I&#39;m stuck with permanent nerve damage. The harder I try to go, the less I can.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s what really sucks. The MEDs last for one fucking day and ware off. If I don&#39;t take the Meds one day, peeing becomes a waiting game permeated by gravity induced dribbles. Thanks to my renowned gender surgeon, that&#39;s the best I can do.

Well hopefully my surgeon can tell me what&#39;s going on when I talk to him next. I mean its still early in healing really so probably will just take more time

I mentioned it a lot. I have a chronic leak. Some people&#39;s brains have to relearn how to properly control the pelvic floor muscles, after they&#39;ve been split apart for a vaginal canal.

Yeah I got very little primer on it. I was told before leaving &#34;try and go&#34; then went to the bathroom and was discharged. So no real info on this will be completely new lol.

<p>
But I&#39;m glad yours is getting better
