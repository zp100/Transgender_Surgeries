You&#39;re still making progress dear!  Just make sure you are keeping in touch with your surgeon and following their advice.  I think overall it looks pretty darn good at this point.  I wouldn&#39;t stress yourself over the aesthetics right now, just be happy you are healing.  Aesthetics will change as the tissue continues to heal and swelling continues to decrease.  No point in stressing over the look of it just yet (I know, easier said than done).

You&#39;re welcome :) and no I actually am only acquainted with a few trans people through co-workers and such.  Honestly, I work in the medical field and find these surgeries very interesting.
</p>
<p>
Plus I know a thing or two about wound/incision care. These are relatively difficult surgeries to recover from which can be very taxing mentally/emotionally. Incisions are terrifying and foreign to many people, which is a totally natural response, so I like to ease minds where I can.
