Sorry to hear about you having to re-cath and the associated traumatic experience.  How are you holding up? I hope you&#39;re feeling better and we wish you a speedy recovery.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t mind me asking, did you tell your surgeon or staff about being plural? We&#39;re scheduled for November and I&#39;m worried a traumatic event in an already stressful situation may cause some fronting shuffle that I won&#39;t be able to influence. It&#39;s been a negotiating process to get everyone&#39;s consent and was just wondering on your thoughts in general.

Yes, we informed them over a year ago.
</p>
<p>
I made efforts to educate the nursing staff on it. And yes, we had shuffles and panic attacks.
</p>
<p>
We were diagnosed with DID by a specialist in 2019

can i ask about the DID? did it make getting surgery more difficult?
<br>
we&#39;re DID too and it&#39;s always wonderful to meet others who are plural

There’s taboo and stigma among idiots online of course, so every time I mention it I get downvoted.
</p>
<p>
My therapist is a DID specialist. I’ve been working with him for years, and have made incredible progress. He wrote one of my letters for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I informed my surgeon about it and how they could affect things. She was understanding and willing to proceed.
</p>
<p>
Our DID is well managed and understood. If you are unstable you won’t be allowed to get surgery. Bear that in mind.

yeah i don&#39;t like to talk about the DID on reddit. that makes perfect sense.
</p>
<p>
i&#39;m so happy to hear that you have a proper specialist!! that&#39;s truly wonderful. that isn&#39;t possible for me due to money, but it is my dream.
</p>
<p>
i definitely understand that instability means you can&#39;t get the surgery. that&#39;s why it&#39;s taken me 10 years to get to this point. i&#39;m still not  too stable, but this surgery has to happen. not getting it is no longer an option for us. so we&#39;re white knuckling it and have  managed to get all my letters finally &lt;3

You’ll be ok. Don’t be surprised if some new alters crop up afterward, or if some of ya fuse together. System changes go with life changes.
