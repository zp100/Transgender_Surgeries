<em>
I&#39;m very bored so this got verrrryyyyy long, so I split it up into three sections based on the stage of the process that will continue in comments, but heres my initial experience outlined for anyone researching, and feel free to ask questions.
</em>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<em>
Part One:
</em>
</p>
<p>
My Stats:5’7”131 pounds1 year 10 months on HRT (.5ml EC, 200mg Progesterone, 100mg sprio x2/day (discontinued after surgery))
</p>
<p>
I started the process at Mt Sinai Transgender Health Center in March, and it took about 2 months to get in my Social, Psych, and Medical consultations done to get the applicable letters of recommendation. They do try to offer all three meetings on one day when possible but I believe they were short a psych person when I started so it took a bit to line everything up with my work schedule.
</p>
<p>
After this I had a consult with the surgeon  Dr Grotas at the urology/ surgery dept.  I was told by the dept that did my other consults / intake that they would send over my info and I would be called to set up a consult, but after a couple weeks it became pretty clear that I needed to check in. I was able to set up an appointment quickly at that point. From what I’ve heard this is not uncommon. They’re super busy and getting stuff between departments will probably require your shepherding, but at least they don’t seem to annoyed when you call to check in or clarify things often.
</p>
<p>
The consult went fairly smoothly, Dr Grotas went over the procedure and his methods and I asked the questions I prepared, and we picked a date. He does a bi-lateral (both balls) orchiectomy with a small midline incision on the scrotum, removing the testis and everything else in there. After this I met with his assistant (I think? After talking with a million people in the process I’ve lost track of everyone’s position but they were all very helpful) and completed more paperwork. Ahead of the surgery I just had to make sure they had copies of my approval letters and that was pretty much that for prep on my end. One week before I had a pre-op check in where I filled out a bunch of paperwork (you will fill out the same forms and answer the same questions MANY times throughout this process) regarding my medical history and then got blood taken and an EKG. No one told me transition was going to require the relinquishing of all of my blood on a regular basis. At this point they gave me my med and prep instructions ahead of surgery. No Aspirin or CBD oil for a week, no more spiro after the night before. No food or water after midnight the night before. Estradiol as normal (i inject sundays, surgery was scheduled for Wednesday.)

Recovery Days:
</em>
</p>
<p>
When I got home I surprised myself by climbing the 3 flights to my apartment assisted only by the bannister on the stairs. My girlfriend and I had been most worried about this part, and even had a friend on call in the event we needed another hand, so being able to do it alone was a huge confidence boost. When I got in I pretty much went straight to lay down and my girlfriend brought me an ice pack. I napped the rest of the afternoon and my girlfriend prepped me some snacks of chopped up veggies and popcorn, toast etc for when I was feeling up to eating because she is AMAZING.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the day went pretty fine except that a prescription for painkillers that I&#39;d been given never got called in due to an error of some sort. I assume this is because they dont typically prescribe anything and just advise ibuprofen or Tylenol. Since I&#39;d been experiencing some extra pain a nurse added it to my paperwork but I think along the way this got mixed up. I didnt need it by the time I was home but still a little frustrating.
</p>
<p>
The next day was spent mostly laying in bed icing my groin and playing video games and watching movies. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d get bored of this so quick but when it&#39;s such a nice looking day out it was hard for me not to want to soak up those last days of summer. Oh well. I was shocked by how little pain I was in, two Tylenol every 6ish hours was more than enough. I was able to get up and move around my apartment / use the bathroom / fetch more snacks / feed my cat, and such activities pretty easily, with only a little soreness. I tried to move around as little as possible but in the heat my ice packs needed changing every hour or so and I was also peeing a lot! which I chalk up to drinking a lot of water.
</p>
<p>
Today (day two) was more of the same, with even less pain and the swelling way down as I keep up with icing. I removed my bandages, and my incision appears clean and as good as I could imagine. I was able to shower as well (YAY.) I was even feeling well enough for a quick trip to the coffee shop for a new bag of beans (5-10 minute walk each way) which helped my early onset cabin fever. Now I just have to keep myself from getting over confident and pushing too hard too early.
</p>
<p>
All in all I&#39;m really pleased with the whole procedure, and quite happy with my pace of recovery. I&#39;ll update further on in recovery but figured while I&#39;m bored I might as well type something up. Based on initial experience I can deff say I&#39;d recommend the procedure and mt sinais team to a friend. I&#39;m already feeling better about my appearance below the belt, and with the swelling I havent even gotten to the real difference yet. Thanks for reading and dont hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

Day of:
</em>
</p>
<p>
I was told the day before to arrive at 9:30 am, and from there I filled out very familiar paperwork and went through intake. My partner who was my escort home (you must have an adult escort) came with me and she was allowed to be with me during most of this process except a couple of conversations with nurses / the anesthesiologist for whatever reason but it was fine. Talked to all of the nurses / doctors about what was going to happen / med stuff / had I followed instructions etc. filled out more familiar paperwork. Everyone made me feel very comfortable and informed. Come time for surgery I said my goodbyes and went into the OR with the nurse.
</p>
<p>
Side note: throughout this whole process they confirmed and used preferred names and pronouns etc. It is a trans surgery dept after all. My legal paperwork is not all in quite yet so we had to confirm my legal name often use it for paperwork but they’re very tactful about it. I had had my court date and gotten my order during this process but they advised me to wait until after surgery to complete everything because it is IMPERATIVE that my ID and everything match the name on my paperwork throughout the process so that I can prove it is / was me and everything is good.
</p>
<p>
In the OR they held my hand and put me to sleep and then I woke up &#34;moments&#34; later in recovery. Hospitals are cold as fuck! But I felt remarkably well when I got up. They spoke with me, brought me water and eased me awake. During this time I began to experience some decent pain, not in my groin as expected but due to some serious stomach gas which I guess was my body’s reaction to anesthesia, so I’ll have to keep that in mind next time. Once I warmed up they brought me from a bed to a chair and my girlfriend was allowed in to see me. Unfortunately my stomach was acting up a little (probably a little anesthesia nausea plus painkillers on an empty stomach) and I threw up a bit so they had her go outside and I sat for a bit till I was feeling better. Once I was able to get up and pee I was discharged.
