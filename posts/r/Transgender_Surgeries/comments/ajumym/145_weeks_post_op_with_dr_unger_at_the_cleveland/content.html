Update:
</p>
<p>
I attempted PIV sex for the first time a few nights ago. We went extremely slow and it only lasted a few minutes at most. It was somewhat difficult to find the hole without a mirror which felt odd. Probably because I use it twice daily for dilation and don&#39;t have a sense for it yet. I used the green dilator for a minute or so before as preparation although it was still a bit difficult to get it in. She is trans as well which did make penetration a bit more difficult. Once in, we went very slowly, as it was mildly uncomfortable but not at all painful. My partner sped up a bit but it seemed as though I had little or no sensation on the inside which left only the mild discomfort so I asked her to stop. It went about how I expected and i will probably wait a few more weeks before trying again.
</p>
<p>
Emotionally, I didn&#39;t have much of a reaction. I think it was just too underwhelming an experience to really feel much one way or the other. I suspect that once I switch from primarily anal intetcourse to vaginal that I&#39;ll feel more at home with my body and more comfortable sexually.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has any questions, ask away. I&#39;m an open book.

Update #2:
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just under 7 months post op now and things have been getting a lot better. I can now somewhat comfortably have piv sex although it still isn&#39;t as sensitive as I would like it to be. I started dilating once a day about a month ago because of my crazy schedule which has definitely made having sex require a bit more prep time. My clit has gotten more sensitive and has been fun to play with. My labia are still somewhat sore so I have to be a bit careful not to get too aggressive or it can really hurt.

Heres a picture from a few minutes after I showered and attempted to shave. I noticed that compared to my previous pictures some bits are less pink than before. The scars tend to change color slightly when I shower so that&#39;s why they look a bit different in color. Also, I think some of the darker skin on the labia are just spots where I didn&#39;t get enough hair removed. All in all, I&#39;m happy with how my vagina turned out.

I&#39;m still a bit hesitant to play around there much, but the pain is almost entirely gone and I get a bit more sensation every week. I&#39;ve only attempted masturbating once with little success but hopefully I&#39;ll be able to orgasm in a month or so. Overall, I&#39;m very satisfied and would highly suggest Dr Unger. She specializes in fistulas too which is one less complication to worry about.

I would really appreciate if you could update with how functional things are when they heal.  The nurse at my clinic for HRT recommended Cleveland Clinic for SRS but I&#39;m concerned about things being functional and being able to orgasm.  I live in Columbus so doing surgery in Cleveland would be pretty convenient.

Yay Columbus! That&#39;s where I live too. I initially had concerns about her too but after seeing her results, speaking to patients, and seeing my own results, I think she may be one of the best in the world. Even some of the &#34;big name&#34; surgeons don&#39;t get results as good as hers. I&#39;m not the least bit worried about functionality but I&#39;ll try to remember to update you all every so often. I should be cleared for piv sex now but I&#39;ve yet to try so maybe in a week or so I&#39;ll post an update about how that goes.

Beautiful! I love Dr. Unger, she does my testopel and is going to do my hysto. I&#39;d have to say she&#39;s the best doctor I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m glad you had a good experience ðŸ˜Š

Do you know any others who&#39;ve had surgery with Unger? If so, how was their experience and results?

I met a few post op people during my two consults but I&#39;ve since thrown out their contact details. All I can say is that everyone seemed happy with the results.
