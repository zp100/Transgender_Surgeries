I just called to ask about my surgery that&#39;s in April and they told me that for the next two weeks everything is canceled and that they&#39;re going to check in after the two weeks and see how things are and if they can continue on with any future surgeries

No clue, it might be a good idea to call and ask.

i talked to them earlier since i have a follow up in a few weeks and they said they&#39;re cancelling follow ups thru March 31st, could be extended as the situation develops. üòì i think i need to have granulation tissue treated so i&#39;m pretty nervous. check with them just in case though!

To give some accurate information, Mount Sinai is still giving follow up appointments, but they are asking for patients to email the surgeons photos and calling to talk to go over anything. They have people in the office helping people. I know,  I had a scheduled appointment with Avanassian this morning, we talked for a good amount of time.

They are doing virtual appointments, and while I can‚Äôt confirm it explicitly, she did say she was at her office seeing other patients (our time got pushed back, and she gave that explanation.)
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm assuming in-person appointments are for high priority ‚Äúthis needs to be checked out‚Äù patients who need to be physically seen.

Fuck. I have to assume this is going to push back everyone else&#39;s surgery dates so canceled ones can be done :(

That&#39;s not usually how it works because it creates more work and disruption from the domino effect.

They can&#39;t know how to handle it until they have even an inkling of when this might &#34;end&#34;. No telling if they&#39;ll be rescheduling weeks&#39; worth of surgeries or months. (not trying to frighten anyone I&#39;m not even on the damn list yet).

This is accurate. My point was that they don&#39;t do the surgeries that were cancelled first upon resuming business as usual. Those cancelled surgeries and appointments are fit into the schedule when possible without disrupting the rest of the scheduled appointments.

My apologies, I wasn&#39;t disputing your point nor do I think you&#39;re incorrect, they&#39;ll target as little disruption as possible with the schedule. I have the bad habit of responding to people without clarifying that I don&#39;t disagree with them in the slightest lol !

That really sucks =/
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m scheduled in the early fall with Dr. BBL. AFAIK NYU hasn&#39;t cancelled elective surgeries yet, but I&#39;d be surprised if that doesn&#39;t happen within the next week or so. I can&#39;t even imagine what it would be like being pushed to the end of her schedule...

This is on Dr. Ting&#39;s Facebook in case this is of any interest...
</p>
<p>
&#34;At The Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, we have been thinking of all our patients in this time of such uncertainty. We know the surgeries we perform are both life-saving and life-affirming and we also know many of you are worried about COVID-19. We are too. In light of what&#39;s happening, we have taken the extraordinary but necessary steps of postponing all non-emergent gender affirming surgeries for at least the next two weeks, and possibly longer. This will protect our transgender and non-binary patients from the risk of transmission of COVID-19 while at the hospital, and will allow the hospital the capacity to care for critically-ill COVID-19 patients. As soon as it is safe to do so, all postponed surgeries will be rescheduled with the highest priority.
</p>
<p>
To those of you who have already reached out with words of understanding about this very difficult situation, thank you. To all of our patients, we hope to see you very soon and will be updating you with any developments as soon as we&#39;re able.
</p>
<p>
Our office is open but running a minimal crew as both clinical and non clinical personnel and physicians are being Ôøºreassigned dynamically to areas where they are most needed.
</p>
<p>
Believe the hype. COVID-19 is real. It is here. And it is going to get worse.&#34;
