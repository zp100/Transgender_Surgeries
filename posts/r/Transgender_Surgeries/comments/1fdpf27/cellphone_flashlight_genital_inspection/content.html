Hi - asking a question as I still feel violated over a year later.
</p>
<p>
Two surgeons at the same facility had inspected my genitals, both pre and postop with their own personal phone flashlights. On both instances, I requested they first turn on the room lights and that I don’t consent to an inspection in the manner they proposed. I was ignored by both doctors.
</p>
<p>
How would you feel? I still feel awful and unlistened to. A formal complaint is getting me nowhere either. Anyone I’ve talked to: family, friends, psychologist, is absolutely disgusted that this happened and is seemingly their common practice. It would not be allowed for a gynaecologist’s exam, so it shouldn’t be here.
</p>

You did good questioning it.  Well done.
</p>
<p>
You were in a very vulnerable situation. What they did is not right or acceptable, i have been in a similar position and also have an ongoing complaint.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not your fault if you feel violated and they need to be held to account.
</p>
<p>
Please try to stay strong and look at the positive parts. Don&#39;t let the bad things define your existence going forward
</p>
<p>
Sorry i can&#39;t be more help but I&#39;m getting over it even though it&#39;s much more difficult than it should be 3 years post op.
</p>
<p>
You will recover and feel much better at some point. EMDR helped me a lot after being assaulted by a surgeon on more than one occasion.

Assuming you don’t need them anymore, name and shame.
</p>
<p>
Generally you can refuse consent to medical procedures and doctors have to accept it. What country is this?

That sucks. I doubt you will get any kind of response that makes you feel better, even if it were illegal. The hospital knows you will have to hire a lawyer, and then face a potentially huge legal bill if you lose. It costs them nothing to ignore you. Again, sucks.
</p>
<p>
How the f is there not a flashlight that is wiped down between patients if that is needed for exams? The thing is that cell phones are notoriously disgusting, so if a surgeon busted it out to examine me I would say, &#34;Did you sterilize that thing after using it in the bathroom?&#34; Keep your fecal phone away from my wounds, bro.
</p>
<p>
Edit to add: I am the person who has no shame in asking a nurse, physician, etc for them to put on new gloves if they do something gross, and then try to touch me. A dental tech used her gloved hand to push other USED gloves down into the trash; she was shocked when I asked her to put on new gloves after what I saw, but she knew she f&#39;d up and put on new gloves.

I told them to turn on the lights or get a flashlight. One ignored me, the other laughed and said it couldn’t be done.

Yeah, then that&#39;s sexual assault babes. You told them no and they ignored you and proceeded to perform an illegal inspection without consent.

I have no idea what to do now. I went through the formal complaint method and the response I got is that cellphone flashlight inspections are allowed. They did not address the parts where I told them both ‘no’.

&#34;Cell phone inspections are allowed to the point that the patient consents. That consent was violated. I expect that hospital administration takes my concerns more seriously or I&#39;ll be escalating it to law enforcement.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Take note of every piece of correspondence between you and them. Confirm that it happened, which it seems like they have, and look for supporting evidence that they acknowledged you said no and did it anyway. Unfortunately you shouldn&#39;t expect much to come of it, but it might still be worth doing it if it helps the next person.

i&#39;m very sorry to see the disgusting comments you are receiving that normalise this and dismiss the violation of your consent. i would not have felt comfortable with a phone being used to examine my genitalia and a request for them to use an alternative device is perfectly reasonable.

I’m so sorry that happened to you. Doctors (definitely not all) can take an extraordinarily inhumane approach to their patients. Simply because they quarantine the emotional aspect of your ’being’ in favour of a mechanical perspective to your biology — entirely inexcusably, no question about that. The resulting trauma (because doctors are also frequently in denial about the relationship between mental and physical health (i.e. you don’t have a heart problem! you’re just anxious now let me get to my next patient, or you’re making up your severe period pain, endometriosis is a myth!) is dismissed as ‘made up’ or just another example of a ‘difficult patient’. Too many examples to list where doctors create this pain and this problem because of their thoughtlessness and sometimes worst, their transphobia.
</p>
<p>
In your case, it seems (from what limited understanding I have) they’ve approached you without regard to the wholeness of your person and lacking any empathy (let alone any ‘bed-side manner’), have traumatised you (unintentionally or otherwise, it’s not relevant) They traumatised you.
</p>
<p>
I firmly doubt they even discussed the matter afterwards beyond language analogous to comparing the differences between two fan belts in a car’s radiator, but they hurt you that’s for sure and they should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. A battle hardened nurse with  hospital authority should give them a good whipping for that. Furthermore, compassionate healthcare ’culture’ can sometimes be comparable to shitty corporate culture where employees just don‘t give a shit enough to take one extra moment to accommodate what can be the difference between you feeling very cared for and you horribly traumatised. Again, I’m so sorry this happened to you. You deserve much better care.

I don’t work in an area with genital exams are common but as a nurse I’ve never seen a doctor use anything but their cell phone flashlight to do exams. (Usually eyes for neuro)
</p>
<p>
But yeah doing things without consent is illegal.

You can’t know if it’s just a flashlight, a video with flash on, snapping pics, etc.

I agree, I also find it odd that they do it that way. I also find all the comments saying that this method is normal for this and other procedures odd. Personal devices should not really be used for non personal work, sounds like an invitation for trouble.
</p>
<p>
Not sure why people aren&#39;t thinking about the potential video aspect you mentioned. It looks the same (at least on my phone) whether you are taking a video with flash or just have your flashlight on and that is a very understandable fear. It&#39;s unlikely that the doctor would do that as it would put them and their license at risk but crazier things have happened and I think it is a very valid concern. Especially if you expressed that you were uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
Not to mention it just looks extremely unprofessional to be using a personal device for such an intimate procedure. If it&#39;s something they are doing regularly or even semi-regularly, they can get a flashlight. They aren&#39;t expensive at all.

You’re assuming that it’s a personal device though, as an NP, I’ve got a cellphone provided by the hospital for when I’m on-call. The nurses and my colleagues all have this number to reach me. I use it to snap pictures of surgical wounds in order to document accurately later on. The nurses also often snap pictures to send me concerning patient care.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, this is the healthcare provider you’ve chosen to deal with the most intimate part of your body and if you don’t trust that they’re not snapping pictures to use illicitly then maybe you just shouldn’t go to them?

Isn’t that where a baseline level of trust comes in between you and your surgical teams? I’ve gotta be real, if my doctor were so sus that I didn’t know if he was filming my genitals and it seemed like a credible threat, I don’t think I’d be having procedures done with them.

People have high expectations of surgeons, which is why they keep getting botched. It’s only too late to they find out that they are not all to be trusted.

How do you manage to come up with that? It’s a fact that some surgeons have a dire record and that people would never go to them if they knew that beforehand. Why they are so bad I can only guess.

I&#39;m sorry that happened... it should never be done.
</p>
<p>
Where I worked (elder care facility), personal phones were forbidden to be used except on breaks, and only in the breakroom.  Most of the nurses (90%, but not the trainees) had the work cell phones.  Pictures could be taken, with consent, for forwarding to the doctor.
</p>
<p>
(some of the patients were non-communicative, but even then we&#39;d tell them that we were taking a picture, why we were taking it, and what would be done with the picture).
</p>
<p>
So they should have there followed similar protocol: using hospital phones, explain why they need to take the picture and what they will do with it, and then get consent.
</p>
<p>
(If I was licensed in Michigan, which would be pointless as I left the US after passing the bar exam, I&#39;d write a supporting letter to the hospital.  But as an unregistered lawyer, they wouldn&#39;t be impressed very much...)
</p>
<p>
But I would find if there&#39;s a group that can take this pro-bono or on contingency.  Shouldn&#39;t be hard as the hospital should back down if they got a letter from a firm that puts the same fear into their hearts as Trump had before meeting Kamala :P

You weren’t violated. It wasn’t abuse. Sorry your doc doesn’t carry a frigging mag light. Cell phone flashlights are very intense directional light and very true to color. There’s nothing wrong with it.

As a trans NP…I don’t see the issue with this.
</p>
<p>
On one hand I can understand why you might feel uncomfortable with the cellphone flashlight. “Maybe it’s a photo or recording occurring.” But at the same time, this is the person you’ve chosen to perform such an intimate procedure that if you don’t trust them enough to believe that they’re genuinely just examining your genitals and not snapping illicit photos for self-gratification, then do you really want them performing your procedure to begin with?
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s terrible to do things without a patient’s consent and if I were them then I would’ve stopped using the flashlight as well, not a big deal. With the implication that they were doing something malicious though, I probably would’ve just informed the patient that I didn’t feel comfortable performing this procedure on them.

Do you work in the cafeteria at a healthcare facility? This, like it or not, this is not how modern medicine is done. Sorry. Hate to trigger anyone but we have hospital issued smartphones that we have to carry around. You can not have a surgeon perform surgery on you and then refuse follow up care, risking said surgeons career, because you don’t like a lighting source. This is such an outrageous concept that it made the drs laugh

Er, actually, you CAN refuse consent at any time. For any reason. You can refuse follow up care whenever you would like. It is the law in both USA and Canada. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s AMA, you can refuse it. That doctor&#39;s career is not going to be in trouble for respecting a patient&#39;s refusal of consent. A patient can get up after a heart transplant and refuse all medications and there is nothing anyone can do if that patient does not want to take their medications. Not the surgeon&#39;s fault and wouldn&#39;t be considered their fault.
</p>
<p>
Also, it doesn&#39;t look like they bothered to clarify that this was a hospital-issued cellphone or not? It&#39;s no surprise that someone doesn&#39;t want a phone flashlight near their open wound, when people hold their cellphones while shitting on the toilet. People rarely ever wash their phones. There is also no way to actually know if it&#39;s a personal phone or a hospital phone, it is right to be concerned and to have those concerns taken care of by a simple explanation (this is a hospital phone, see? not a personal one) or just go get a fucking flashlight? My gyno always uses a small flashlight.
</p>
<p>
Like even if it was the hospital issued cellphone, that shit is held everywhere around all kinds of patients and you want to hold it up near an open wound post-op? That&#39;s super gross in and of itself.

I’m not sure why we’re being downvoted for explaining basic healthcare setup. Its quite literally ridiculous to get upset with and attempt to shade a surgeon that you chose because he used a different lighting source than you preferred. Then I feel as though the ones upset about this clearly haven’t had SRS before. Surgeons do snap pictures and/or videos of your post-op 🐱. Of course they’re not going to go posting it without permission, but it’s not uncommon for them to do so and place the photo in your chart for reference. As you said, we all have iPhones issued by the hospital for communication.

You can try to boil it down to &#39;using a different lighting source than you preferred&#39;, which ignores all of the issues that were actually important about this, but you do you. Lord forbid someone doesn&#39;t want what they assume to be a personal phone (which lots of people hold while taking a shit) held up near their open wound, and if it&#39;s a medical phone they could have clarified that and clarified that they sterilized it instead of laughing at their concerns.
</p>
<p>
Y&#39;all are being downvoted because you&#39;re both wrong about medical consent. A heart transplant patient can decide they don&#39;t want their medications right after surgery for any BS reason and it has to be respected. My gyno uses a tiny flashlight, I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s suuuuch a difficult thing to ask a doctor to use. Acting like yall shocked cause someone doesn&#39;t want someone&#39;s cellphone up in their snatch, I swear some will do anything to defend a doctor or surgeon.

It doesn’t sound as though consent had been rescinded  though. OP mentioned that they made a suggestion and a comment about not wanting them to use the smartphones, which is different from. “Stop. I’m not okay with this. I don’t want these devices to be used.”

You are not in charge in the hospital. What you want isn’t always taken into consideration. You can not refuse to allow them to see the area postop. Not sure what has gotten in patients lately but it makes the job impossible. If you don’t want to be looked at, skip surgery

The falsehoods spread are uncalled for. I promise you this is the way things go. I’m at work right now in a major teaching hospital. Guess what everyone uses for a light? If they just performed surgery on the area, why make it difficult and frankly riskier to yourself by not having proper follow up?  Think of it as drs covering their butts and protecting you from yourself whether you like it or not. Safety is the key, not modesty

Seriously. Do you personally know any Drs? First off they would never carry around more than they need. Second, most would lose the flashlight by the time they saw their 3rd pt of the day

You dont automatically lose your Autonomy when you go into a hospital.   You have every right to not consent to a doctor using their phone when its pointed directly at you... You know phones have cameras on them right ?

Absolutely none of that matters.   She is conscious and objects in this situation.
</p>
<p>
There are plenty of other light sources in the office, it&#39;s not as if the doctor cannot perform said inspection without a cell phone light.
</p>
<p>
It is both unprofessional and unethical to not take a patients wishes into account in this situation

Healthcare workers see so much that it’s seriously just another person. Way too much paranoia in this post.

If it makes you feel any better, your doctor isn&#39;t going to risk recording you and ruining their career. Did they at least do a good job on the surgery ?

Nope, poor job aesthetically and I’m also left with horrible chronic pain. I take two medications daily for it and am undergoing severe tests to pinpoint the issue. Eventually it will require a corrective surgery as it seems a main nerve was clipped, stretched, or torn.
