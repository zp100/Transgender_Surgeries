I  am one of his SRS butcher jobs of this Doctor. I am not holding back my very own pictures of what you will not want to believe what he did  to me. I am 69 and have waited 40 years for this last completion of me. I am so sorry that these doctors are not what their websites say to us must .. Please if you don&#39;t take the time to see these pic you might  get hurt by another like this doctor.I am ashamed to have to do this for myself  but theres others that he has done these cut jobs on and I wish they would come forward and tell us their stories. This picture link is to what I  was sent home after the bandages were taken off 7 days after SRS . if you need more proof ask me I am here to make a difference in our lives. Link

Iâ€™m very sorry this happened to you. I did not have the same experience and i feel really bad because I shed positivity on this doctor on this sub and to know that this could lead to this makes me feel terrible. I am glad you are sharing this to help others. It truly goes to show results may vary and you roll the dice every time. I hope that things can work out in the long run for you

I still don&#39;&#39;t look at it much it puts me in a very depressed thinking mood of  whats left now for me.?? Even  if he pays money isn&#39;t going to bring back my Picture of a vagina on me, all I can do  is share this doctors cutting up a human and getting paid its going to end now..!!

Unfortunately There&#39;s typically a Statutes of Limitations to sue for Malpractice, (2-3 years depending on country, here in Ireland anyways It&#39;s only 2 years)
</p>
<p>
Edit: I didn&#39;t realize this post was 2 years old, Did you manage to sue for Negligence/Malpractice?

I&#39;m very sorry for you.

<p>
That looks like the inner labia and clit are completely missing, there&#39;s way too much blood and I&#39;m not even quite sure what the circled spot is. Looks like there&#39;s a chunk missing. I&#39;m surprised they let you go home instead of fixing that stuff up immediately.
</p>
<p>
Not exactly what one would expect but I hope at least the dysphoria isn&#39;t as bad anymore.

Look for my next post to night on why the hospital isn&#39;t to blame for this mess./? I will show the cover up that this doctor put on me so that the nurses couldn&#39;t see the  surgery or any blood . It took a real NUT CASE to do what he did to cover this mess up. Thank You for your support. TG Jillian

Firstly hun I am so sorry You need to go too hospital and be check over to be sure their is no internal bleeding or infection. What he&#39;s done to you looks  horrific, 3rd sue him, no only for malpractice but for the cost of having any corrective surgery done

Thank you for your thoughts and there right on , But I am going to post a few more pictures which I maybe should have done along with this on on how this doctor covered my surgery with a cover that the hospital nurses couldn&#39;t take off and they couldn&#39;t see a thing no blood etc. It took a crazy man to do this to me or any one. Your going to want to shut your eyes to these pictures please look for my extended post to night. Thank you .. TG Jillian

Seeing this makes me extremely sad. I&#39;m just completely speechless! We trans sisters endure so much in life and when the most important surgery of our life goes extremely wrong it breaks my heart. I wish I had the power to turn back time or undo things. I&#39;m truly am really sorry!

Your a sweet heart as most of us are , this is why we some times get stabbed in our backs by these type doctors. I wasn&#39;t going to do this  and it took some friends a lot of them cis woman too to get me to start this post because what is right shouldn&#39;t be turned into a mutilation as it did and will if he stays in practice so I am wanting new girls to beware get another doctor this man has a way of making you feel like your  going to get the best of every thing and I listened to it and now I am ashamed of me to believe him. Thank you for your words of love for all LBGT+ people I am one and I will be me. TG Jillian  PS. look at  my next post it will shine light on how he covered his butchering of me from the Hospital staff they were con&#39;d as others were. to night post

Are you in any pain? How has your experience been with dilating after your surgery? Can you pee properly? Do you have feelings of regrets? I feel for you sis. My prayers are with you.

I sorry I am running a  bit late on returning  comets, Well I was on able to use a dilator 2 days after the bandages were taken  off because my canal started  streaming out of  the hole that  he  cut in me and  so for 3 days I was having the skin  of my canal made from my penis  and  ball sake cut off with a pair of sissors he used to do this with. Needless to say I never saw him again. I am 1 year to day post-op surgery  was 7/15/2019 today 7/15/2020. Theres a whole lot more to this nightmare I am living with I want to show  what  went on over this year and whats going to come out of it. I have  to find out if this will be a help to find  and see by the month of the year I have gone through  doctors  nurses, PA&#39;s, NP&#39;s  lots of things we all heard  could happen but not  like this  set in time frames I am 69 at this stage so I am hoping to help all younger persons to be filled with more info on the bad side so that they will be atop of their questions to there surgeon. Leave feedback if you will. Thank You. TG Jillian

Im so sorry to see what you have been dealing with after surgery with him. I had my surgery with Sinclair a month before yours in 2019, but fortunately the only complications Iâ€™ve had after a year is my vagina closing up a little bit.
</p>
<p>
Please take care, and thanks for sharing your story. Prior to my surgery I couldnâ€™t find much on him online.

Hii, I donâ€™t recall having staples on me at all. It was all stitches, the ones that dissolve on their own. On my first week appointment he did remove some things though, idk if it was staples or different type of stitches.

I thank you very much, it&#39;s good news as why the staples were used. He wasn&#39;t the surgeon on me??? !! My lawyers have been running this thought over and over and what  you and  another  TGirl told them is that he setup up this surgery with this Hospital for their surgeons  to have a piece of meat to try and create a vagina.!!!!!!! He was there  right before my eyes closed  and said are you ready ? so that I would think he was the surgeon , CAN YOU  BELIEVE THIS ?? LEFT ME THERE WITH UNTRAINED WANT A BE TRANSGENDER DOCTORS WHO NEVER  HAD A REAL BODY  TO CUT UP. I wish I could show you all the whole month by month pictures that I have  over this last year . I am in tears.......
</p>
<p>
I must break from here  cause its killing now that  its what I am now?
</p>
<p>
A  UNIC :   LOOK UP THIS WORD.
</p>
<p>
ITS WHAT I AM NOW SORRY TO LEAVE.
