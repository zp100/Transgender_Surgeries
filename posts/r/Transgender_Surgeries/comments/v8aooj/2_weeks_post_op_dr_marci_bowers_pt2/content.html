Here to share my experience with Bowers. I know that she is a focal point of interest conversations and also pin üìå to this page. Not defending her since everyone has their experience that is true to them. This is about mine, from a point of view of an immigrant white Mexican trans woman.
</p>
<p>
*Insurance
</p>
<p>
Forgot to talk about insurance. I have Providence through work and even though it&#39;s pretty good there were hiccups.
</p>
<p>
Before even getting on the waiting list I made sure to call my insurance to know coverage and whether or not I was in-network. They say said I was in-network and that my maximum was $3500 for surgery, $3500 for hospital, and the same for anesthesia. Once the pre-approval went is they say &#34;sure but you are out of network with them&#34;. Even though I was mad it technically didn&#39;t matter because my out-of-pocket stayed the same; however, it matter to Bowers&#39;s office.
</p>
<p>
Apparently, insurance is sneaky (I&#39;m surprised) and when you go to someone out of network they usually try to pay them less for the service/surgery. Sneaky. So how bowers office handles this is that they ask you to pay everything up front ($14,500 or was it 16k?) Which if my partner and I had no savings and credit cards the whole surgery would have been postponed. (Make sure to use a good cash back or rewards). Once insurance paids Bowers then the office will refund us whatever the amount is.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately it was my insurance fault for telling me the wrong info, but with the combination of the short notice for surgery, it was not fun. I do not care for Bowers&#39;s office policy either but I guess we live capitalism and people need to be paid.
</p>
<ul>

Day of surgery After no food and bowel prep, the day before I was getting hangry. Sadly, I was the second surgery of the day, and the person&#39;s surgery before me went longer than expected. Did not make it to the OR until 1 pm. When I did my BA and orchi (other time and surgeon) I was the first arriving at the hospital at 7 am, that was nice.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before going to the OR Dr. Bowers and the visiting Denmark doctors came in to say hi and answered last-minute questions, the usual. I didn&#39;t have much because I knew what to expect. Then came the anesthesiologist, again the usual. Then I was rolled to the OR got on the table and soon after it was just black. Don&#39;t even remember counting. That is more than my last surgery.
</p>
<p>
*After surgery Apparently I had some pain control issues. Honestly, I don&#39;t remember at all, good thing. I was saying that &#34;what used to be my head hurts&#34; and putting my hands over the area. The hospital took good care of me because I clearly don&#39;t remember. There is a TikTok of me singing &#34;my money don&#39;t jiggle&#34; where I recline the bed as I sing the &#34;seats go back&#34; part. I was high as a kite. I was also singing &#34;Gloria&#34; by The Doors because that was my nurse. I also said that my blue dilator was for my molcajete (Mexican mortar and pestle).
</p>
<p>
I do not remember anything until about 9 pm. My mom and partner were there. I had ice on me and I was not hurting just aware of the area almost like just soreness.  I mostly slept through the night except for the routine nurse checking. Once conscious my pain level stayed under 5. I want to add that I have a high pain tolerance and as we go on I will remind again.
</p>
<p>
Even though my surgeon was Bowers there will be similarities with any surgeons like exhaustion from walking, bowel movements, pain, bulb extraction, etc.
</p>
<p>
*Day after surgery Mostly a boring day. Mom and partner came in but since taking care of my kid they just stay no an hour or less both times that they came. Pretty boring day.
</p>
<p>
This morning nurse checked my bulb and with little to no blood, she was impressed. My pain level is about 4, everyone that asks me is impressed since I was clearly in pain after surgery. ++I have never been a bleeder and even oral surgeons have complimented my body&#39;s ability to cloth over wounds++
</p>
<p>
I played on my Switch, slept, ate and after a Miralax, I had a bowel movement. Since we are bed-bound I needed a bedpan, a really weird experience. They will also help you roll over and clean you, I am ready when I become a senior I guess.
</p>
<p>
To get cultures on my gut and newly vagina I started drinking Yakult. I kept the hospital food light too. I highly recommend the salad rolls, French toast, and salmon with broccoli.
</p>
<p>
I also found the white noise channel on the tv it was great for sleeping at any time. Also the jazz (music) channel.
</p>
<p>
Getting long again. Will continue in another post. Probably add a picture of the big reveal since it&#39;s the next day.

The surgery went really, really well. No post op pain in my vaginal area, but my quads on both legs are extremely sensitive, with bruising--so it makes site ng down on a toilet REAlLY painful/.  again has me worried a bit, but alll of the packing comes out tomorrow, so iI&#39;ll get to see what it looks like.
</p>
<p>
But again, I&#39;m stunned that the surgery itself has resulted in NO pain. Learning how to pee again concerns me, but I&#39;m having some phantom penile sensation, including the urge to urinate, so maybe my pretend penis will just unload without any problems.
</p>
<p>
Without a doubt, my bottom surgery has been a total trip, So many things to learn and experience.
</p>
<p>
I have never loved my life as much as I love it now...
