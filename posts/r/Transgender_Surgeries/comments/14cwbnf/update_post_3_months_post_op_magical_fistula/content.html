I hope this is OK to comment, as I am a CIS woman (my teenage daughter is trans and will be undergoing surgery in the future which is why I&#39;m on here to try to get support and info for her, and show solidarity where I can). I just wanted to say, firstly I think you&#39;re really brave. Your surgery outcome looks aesthetically really good, fingers crossed you get the fistula sorted - it must be really tough to have to cope with but it sounds like you&#39;re looking after yourself and getting the help you need.
</p>
<p>
I also wanted to say (and I KNOW it&#39;s not the same) that when I had my daughter it was a very tough birth and she basically ripped me from one hole to the other (sorry for the TMI). It took a long time to heal, it hurt and was scary but it did heal eventually with surgical help and now you would never know it happened. My point being, the human body is so resilient, and in years to come you&#39;ll be all healed and this will just be a bad memory. I really hope you&#39;re not offended by my comment, I know I can never know what it is to be trans and to have those experiences, but I wanted you to know from one woman to another - it will all be OK. X

Everyone is welcome to comment here, I post for transparency for everyone to learn and be aware of the process. Thank you for your kind words. Sorry about the late response I have had a bit of a hectic personal life recently. I&#39;m not offended by your comment if anything I appreciate you taking the time to write.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not too discouraged yet. But it does get hard. At least I was lucky enough to get surgery.. most don&#39;t..

Thankyou for being so kind. That&#39;s good that you&#39;re not discouraged by it, I think with any health issue often coping emotionally is half the battle (personally I&#39;m not always good at this), that&#39;s something that forums are great for. Fingers crossed you get it sorted quickly and can move forwards without any more difficulties.

Sorry about the fistula complication. Hopefully it improves with time! Aesthetically it looks great
