I had a similar dehiscence, just follow the cleaning process your doctor gave you. Mine recommended a spray bottle with 1:10 ratio of Hydrogen peroxide:water  then gently patting it with a paper towel (no wiping!) It will heal and get better eventually it just takes time. eventually it won&#39;t look like anything happened at all.

The lube and discharge thing is pretty unavoidable, just do the cleaning at the regular times. too much cleaning is also harmful fyi, the goop is not necessarily bad.
</p>
<p>
Also I know you didn&#39;t really mention this but I certainly felt this and felt haunted by it for quite a while: Don&#39;t blame yourself if you are. This isn&#39;t your fault and its unlikely you could have prevented it these things just happen with any kind of surgery.

Javier Belinky. He advised me not to be too mobile but the pain wasn&#39;t that bad so I didn&#39;t pay attention :_

Ty for sharing. How long were you resting before you &#34;got up&#34; and can I ask what you did? I&#39;m in line and trying to make a list of things to get and avoid. It doesn&#39;t look badly infected btw. Just try to keep it clean af.

Hi! I&#39;ve been moving normally (to eat, shower, go to the bathroom and the pelvic floor therapy which is close) for this last week that I&#39;ve been home after 5 days in the clinic. Yesterday my mom drove me for two hours for a brief appointment and my wound had separated when I got back home.
