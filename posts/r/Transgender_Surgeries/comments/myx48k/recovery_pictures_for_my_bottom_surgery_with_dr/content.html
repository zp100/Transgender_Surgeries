Thank you for sharing these pictures. I’m really sorry this happened to you. I hope people will stop going to Dr. Gallagher. It may seem hopeless right now but Dr. RBBL does revisions I’m sure. Hang in there! Thx for being brave and sharing these pictures. You probably are saving more girls from going to this surgeon!

Thank you. Yeah I really don&#39;t want others to go to her. Things function, but it looks terrible, especially when standing up, and I instantly lost all my depth.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I&#39;m in Florida not IU where she used to practice. She moved down to Miami.

I feel like functional revisions are harder, aesthetics seem easier to fix definitely! I’m glad you’re in good spirits. Also post op blues are real regardless of your results. Make sure you have a good support systems. Lots of girls get revisions. You’re not alone

Wow, I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that. Thank you so much for sharing so people know to stay away from her.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, one of the worst things about this surgeon is that she makes tons of videos on TikTok (an app people recognize as mainly used by children) and her videos very much feel like advertisements for her practice. She positions herself as an expert, and her results very much speak to the opposite of that. I&#39;ve seen comments on her videos from young trans people saying that they can&#39;t wait to get surgery from her. That is inexcusable in my opinion, even if she happened to be an amazing surgeon. No surgeon should ever be disguising their advertisements as information on a platform directed to children.

Holy crap, now I almost feel bad for posting my latest revision with Dr. Ferrando. It’s taken me years to years to Fix Gallagher’s work and my friend is dealing with the same issue. I’ve been screaming at the top of lungs, Don’t DO IT!!! Let me tell you, I suggest you avoid her for any revisions. I made that mistake. She only made it worse.  I’m totally here to help you get through this, there’s practically a whole team of us, who are trying to climb out of the Gallagher Hole.
</p>
<p>
Look at my latest post from Yesterday, I posted how far I’ve come getting things repaired. Why the hell is she using surgery glue anyway? OY. I feel so sorry that this happened to you.

I am a Gallagher girl as well and I have had nothing but complications from my urethra placed in the wrong place and pretty much connected to my clitoris leaving me the inability to control my urinating, she revised it several times and it would close back up within 6 months each time. Then there is the hood she gave me that has a scar to my waistline, which now my clitoris has a layer of skin over it reducing the sensation. My labia revision is horrible, little labia definition and stitches that came loose that I was unable to get past her nurse who told me it’s alright, we don’t need pictures! I also have leftover erectile tissue that causes me issues when having intercourse, and swelling to the point that my partner cannot penetrate me without pain! I behave since had revision with Dr Witten who has solved my urinary issues and hopefully the problems with erectile tissue. I cannot stress enough “do not use this surgeon” Social media presence does not make a surgeon!

So far I was lucky that my urethra is working fine. My clitoral hood is literally just her taking my penis, cutting it and folding down, sensations and everything. It also almost completely covers my clitoris and there&#39;s no muscle control or anything it just sticks out, making it feel like I&#39;m tucking 24/7.
</p>
<p>
Idk who thinks what she gave me is a vagina because it doesn&#39;t look remotely like one. When I stand it looks like I have a penis still and am tucking.

Thank you. I got a urologist 2 weeks ago and let him know what&#39;s going on, have CT scans of everything and everything looks fine so far so I have some support structure set up to help.
</p>
<p>
Sadly it&#39;d be another trip to Miami for the surgery though as there aren&#39;t any doctors in my area that could help with it directly, just treat symptoms.
</p>
<p>
So far I can pee fine.

Yeah we ended up in the ER actually, which is how we got the CT scans. Nothing was working right and we had constant diarrhea that was literally just all the water we drank with no color or anything which is how we got so dehydrated.
</p>
<p>
I scared Gallagher today because I pushed her on the issue and having to do a revision and now she&#39;s more serious about everything. Hopefully things will turn out better now, but I&#39;ll keep an eye on everything.

The last surgeon that corrected my urethra was also a urologist and he placed it in the correct location. It has been six months and I no longer have urinary issues! No more pads as well, first time since Gallagher did my surgery (3years) that I haven’t had an issue with peeing, I am very happy about that. The other problems she left me with are going to have to be surgically intervened.😞

Wow....  i’m so sorry it turned out this way.  About the only good thing is that you are alive, and she left plenty of excess skin to work with on a revision.  It is a miracle that you have healed this well.   From what I’ve seen, in my humble opinion, this doctor is dangerous.   I’ve personally seen better looking results from women who got done in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Yeah that and I do still have sensitivity. Like a lot.
</p>
<p>
Idk what possessed her to do this? Like all of her other surgeries are completely different and it feels and looks like she just moved my penis down and split it open. I didn&#39;t expect anything even remotely close to this bad.
</p>
<p>
Gallagher is definitely dangerous.

Yes, it looks like she lopped it off and then randomly sewed up skin.   The tissue at the end of the structure looks concerning and I can’t make out any other points.   I’m sorry she did this to you.  It sucks to go through all of the recovery.   But on the positive side, I think a skilled surgeon can fix it and you heal amazingly well.

Thank you. Idk which surgeon would be willing to work with me and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll have the money for it.
</p>
<p>
She took $14k up front and didn&#39;t report any of it to my insurance and expected me to pay the extra $3k to insurance the day before surgery without any warning.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not made of money, I can barely hold my job as it is. I hope other surgeons are more respectful.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: actually now that I look at it and everything, it&#39;s literally the bottom of my dick. Same position and everything. Wtf.

Maybe Wittenberg? She does revisions I think, and works well with lots of insurances. Getting surgery with her in september. Looking at peritoneal  vaginoplasty surgeons could be a good idea for a revision for you, especially if you lost your depth. Bluebond-Langner is another good option, but I think she&#39;s booked out like crazy now.

Oh sweetie, I&#39;m so sorry. Whenever you&#39;re healed up enough, I would recommend you make your way to Michigan. I had my surgery done with Dr Kuzon from U of M (penile inversion) and the results were fine. I&#39;m almost certain he has corrected other surgeons work before.
