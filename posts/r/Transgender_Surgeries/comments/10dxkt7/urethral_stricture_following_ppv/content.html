So, I had undergone peritoneal pull through vaginoplasty in August with Dr. Freet, before I knew how bad he is. I had been having trouble with urinating, which I found out a week ago was because of an urethral stricture, after my urethra almost completely sealed up. I had seen an urologist who widened the opening of my urethra back to normal size. But I think that it may be closing up again, and I&#39;m looking for advice on what to pursue further. The urologist suggested that I may need to have reconstructive surgery, should I get that done with a normal urologist or a different gender confirmation surgeon?

If you indeed need surgery to correct it, a urological surgeon would be the better choice, and a urological surgeon who also is involved with gender surgery would be the best choice.

Depending on how well I&#39;m healing I may need surgery to correct. Does the community know any in North Texas, or the United States?

I don&#39;t know any in Texas, but I can highly recommend Dr. Higuchi at UCH Anschutz in Colorado.  Not sure what his schedule is like right now though.

I&#39;m not claiming that this is necessarily a total answer...but might play some part in your healing.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Vit C and Zinc for more rapid healing.
</li>
<li>
Acupuncture points, Ren 3 and Ki 12 (very helpful for most anything related to urogenital function).
</li>
<li>
I also suspect that merely widening the passage may not suffice. You may have to wear an object which maintains the patentcy of it for awhile (until your body &#34;learns&#34; that this is &#34;normal&#34;).
</li>
<li>
(Finally), I&#39;ve found Kegel exercises very helpful for &#34;toning-up&#34; that area.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I confess that I&#39;m a little unclear about how one (post-surgery) is able to prevent urine &#34;dribbling.&#34; Best of luck. ;  )

Trying to prevent the opening of my urethra from reclosing, which mostly relates to 3. What devices would help maintain the opening while it heals?

There are dilators for this, but I’ve no idea if it’s appropriate.

OK, I&#39;m not sure, as this isn&#39;t my area of specialization, but seems to me that a tampon applicator (not the tampon, itself) might work well.

That doesn&#39;t seem safe and seems much larger than a urethra is supposed to be

My mistake. I needed further clarity about this. Apparently in the usual SRS procedure, a relatively normal urethra is formed near the new clitoris...and is distinct from the vagina. In that case, I&#39;d confer with the surgeon about what would properly be employed to help keep the canal patent (not closing up, but no actually enlarged). Sorry about that!! ;  )

I had peritoneal pull through vaginoplasty, during that, they shortened my urethra and performed vulvoplasty. There was necrosis near my new clit resulting in half of it falling off and some dead skin near that area. When things healed I had an urethral stricture, which built up more scar tissue over time. This resulted in me having to go to the ER because I couldn&#39;t urinate at all the Saturday before last. They performed a cystoscopy and widened my urethra, but I&#39;m scared that it may reclose over time.
</p>
<p>
You do understand that this is the trans surgery reddit and I was asking about surgeons with specialty in urology/reconstructive urology or for ways to keep my stricture from reforming.

Wow, thanks for sharing that. Hope all turns out MAGNIFICENTLY!! Another idea... using some of that (OTC) anti-scarring cream might be helpful. BTW, after an accident a couple of years ago...I had complete urinary retention...and that SURE ain&#39;t fun!! With Chiro. and Acupuncture, all returned to normal over a few months... but I had to be catheterized for awhile.

I think it&#39;s all the same. BTW (and you&#39;re gonna think I&#39;m nuts!!)....fresh onion contains the same ingredient (HONEST!!)....for when you run out of the cream. I had a small facial scar (from a childhood dog-bite...yikes!!)...which is something like 95% gone...and a more recent (larger) one on my L knee...which is kinda 50% gone. I&#39;m looking forward to using the cream again...after breast augmentation...which frequently leaves scarring underneath each breast.
</p>
<p>
....and, No, I DON&#39;T recommend your using the cream on your burger!! ;  ) I happen to prefer guacamole...and/or BBQ sauce!! ;  )
