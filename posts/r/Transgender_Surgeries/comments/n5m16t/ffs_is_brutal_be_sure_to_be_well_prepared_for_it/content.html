Today is exactly one week from my surgery with facialteam and I want to do this post while my memory on the first tough days is still fresh. I’ll post an update of my results at a later stage. I had forehead, rhinoplasty, chin and jaw, tracheal shave and simultaneous hair transplant.
</p>
<p>
SURGERY I thought general anesthesia worked in a similar way to when you fall asleep but is completely different, it’s a sudden blackout! I remember the nurse giving me the shot, then me laying down for a couple of minutes and my next memory is when they woke me up, more than 10 hours later... At first I thought I was dreaming, and I remember me thinking “cool, I’m dreaming about my surgery”, then I slowly started to realize my main surgery was over and they were doing my hair transplant (they don’t want to keep you under anesthesia too long so they wake you up for this part). At the beginning it was just some blurred images, so I wasn’t sure if I was dreaming or not, then the voices of the doctors became gradually louder and clearer and at one point I remember I saw the writing “facialteam” on the the gown of one doctor/nurse and I said to myself “ok, I’m not dreaming anymore, but is it really possible that my surgery is already over?”. Well, that “already” was actually 10-11 hours and no, I wasn’t finished yet... You don’t feel any pain during the hair transplant because you’re still super zonked out on meds but it’s extremely annoying because it lasts another 3-4 hours (in the same position) and you have post surgery discomfort, which in my case was not being able to breathe with my nose (having had rhinoplasty) and having the mouth plenty of blood and mucus, so with the need to spit every 5 mins or so. This was the only moment in all these days that a facialteam member was not kind at all, a male doctor doing the hair follicle stuff on my head was continuously complaining because according to him I was bleeding too much. C’mon man, don’t you realize what are you doing to my head??? And you idiot, don’t you realize that if all the nurses are speaking with me in Spanish is because I speak Spanish and I totally understand your whines??? All the others (all girls, just a coincidence?) were really kind and helped me when I had to spit due to the mess I had in my mouth and they reassured me all the time saying things like “we’re almost finished, resist a little bit more, you’re doing great”.
</p>
<p>
NIGHTS 1-2 AT THE HOSPITAL  They tell you that the first night is uncomfortable but this is a euphemism, it completely sucks! Worst night of my life! When they brought me in my room they put a cold refrigerating mask on my face that should have helped to reduce inflammation and possibly to avoid too many bruises. That wasn’t my case. It only increased the difficulty to breathe and the impression I was about to choke.  You have a dedicated nurse for the first night just outside of the room and he left me some gauzes for when I had to spit and some lemon aromatized cotton swab to remove the blood and mucus in my mouth. I called him a couple of times during the first hour and the second time he told me “you need to relax, you think you’re gonna choke, all the patients do, but it’s not gonna happen”.  He left me a pill to let me sleep but obviously I didn’t take it, I was really thinking I could have died if I fell asleep (“you don’t know what I have in my mouth and in my throat”). So I didn’t sleep at all during the night but in the morning I finally did for 1 hour or so and I realized I didn’t die so yes, he was right. That helped me to relax a little bit.  On day one they removed the bandages from my chin and my forehead and the nasal swabs so I felt a little bit better. Unfortunately I realized I had one eye closed and the other one severely swollen, as the rest of my face. Didn’t eat or drink anything until the evening when I had a delicious carrot soup. Second night was similar to the first one, a lil bit better, at least I could watch the NFL Draft live that helped me to enjoy those sleepless hours. On the second day they washed my hair, I took a shower and I left the hospital in the late afternoon. During these two days all the personnel of the hospital was really great, always kind, attentive and caring. Some of the services offered by FT in order to help the recovery included an acupuncture session and two lymphatic drainage massages.
</p>
<p>
DAYS 3-7 AT THE HOTEL At first I thought an additional night at the hospital would have been better but then I really appreciated the serenity of my hotel room and the fact I could slowly come back to my daily routines. If you stay at La Villa a FT nurse will come every day to check your scars, change bandages, help to clean your nose and wash your newly transplanted hair, so if you’re going with FT I strongly recommend their accommodation. The first nights sucked at the hotel too but I could sleep a little bit more (3-4 hours) then from day 5 onwards I started to feel like a human being again, I could open my eyes, took care of myself, started to take some short walks and finally I could sleep even 6-7 hours during the last two nights.
</p>
<p>
CONCLUSION  After one week I’m still pretty much swollen, my face color is a mix of pink, violet and yellow, my nose is still clogged, the two sides of my forehead, my chin and the left part of my lower lip are still numb but I feel good, the worst part is over and every day I see some small improvements. Tomorrow they will remove my stitches and I will finally be able to have a proper look at my new nose. The next few weeks will be dedicated to appreciate the daily improvements of my long healing. That’s my mood now. So that’s it, my next post will be in a week or so and I will share some pics of my results. FFS is really tough, you can do it but you must be well prepared physically and mentally!
</p>
<p>
Stay tuned!

Yeah I think I was. I have my bottom surgery already booked for mid-November but tbh at the moment all I can think is “plenty of time to cancel it”.  Let’s see what I think in a couple of months...

Thx and congrats for your surgery too! I didn’t mention it but I did the same with the f* mask! Lol You were lucky your mind could skip the hair transplant part, I found those hours really exhausting and neverending...

I vomited blood probably six times during the hair transplant lol. Wasn&#39;t amazingly pleasant. But did pass somewhat quicker than I expected.
</p>
<p>
It was the chin strap I hated the most. Also that stupid mask was really finicky to put on right.

For the hair transplant were they able to do it with long hair? I really, really don&#39;t want to shave my head.

Congrats!  Good luck with recovery.  Thanks for posting this.  Had a different FFS experience and it&#39;s fascinating to hear how FacialTeam does things.  We&#39;re definitely missing out on the acupuncture and lymphatic massage over in the US!

First of all, CONGRATS! I hope you feel much better in the nearer future. I have a few questions!!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How long did you take off for the procedures?
</li>
<li>
How long do they suspect it will be until you&#39;re back to being able to work and stuff?
</li>
<li>
How able are you to sit and watch TV or read? Reading is always so hard when I&#39;m in pain, but TV is easier. I want to prep a good watch backlog when I go!
</li>
<li>
Are the painkillers enough? Do any of the specific places hurt more or less?
</li>
<li>
What are you most excited for? :)
</li>
</ul>

Thank you for your answers, too!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll consider taking off two weeks after my surgery date, but I plan to take at least a day off ahead of time so I can get super prepped and get one last workout in.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
By the end of day 2 in the hospital though, I was getting bored and walking around a lot. I went into the hospital with plans to watch a ton of stuff. I didn&#39;t end up watching anything. Focusing was just too hard.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oh nooo that sounds annoying.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
All of my facial dysphoria was wiped away in one day.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Words simply cannot express the amount of happiness I feel for you reading this. I feel it all the way through my heart. Congratulations.

Thx, I’m feeling a bit better every day but healing is really a long process!
</p>
<p>
I took two weeks off so back to work on next Monday but I’m working from home (I just need to be able to sit in front of my computer) so I don’t have to show my face to anybody LOL
</p>
<p>
Agree on reading and watching TV. Reading is too tiring for me right now so watching TV is my main activity
</p>
<p>
Painkillers were enough for me but a friend of mine who had the same surgery last week struggled more than me so as always YMMV. Personally I’m a bit bothered by all the numbness I still have (I’m biting my lower lip every time I eat and I feel the areas around my eyebrows really heavy)
</p>
<p>
About excitement, I’m really excited to see my nose tomorrow and to see how my face will still change in the next few weeks/months without all the swelling

This is great and very helpful to me, thank you for posting.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to be going through the same sort of thing on 8 weeks, just need a fast-forward button on life a bit. Unfortunately work keeps throwing me curve balls that make days seem to last longer than normal.

I hope you feel better OP!

The first week definitely sucks ass. It&#39;s even worse cos you have to wake up all the time to moisten the hair transplant area.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I recall from the transplant procedure was asking for water in poor Spanish.
</p>
<p>
I still don&#39;t have 100% full feeling in my forehead after almost 5 years. It doesn&#39;t bother me though, it&#39;s nowhere near like the start when it feels like you&#39;re wearing a helmet. I can still definitely feel everywhere on my forehead, it just feels slightly odd when i touch it.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I found listening to meditations on youtube very useful to relax me in the subsequent weeks after the operation.

Thx for the suggestion!  You described it perfectly, it feels like I’m wearing a helmet! So you had the hair transplant a long time ago, is all the new hair still there after 4-5 yrs?

It&#39;s mostly still there, I quite often wear my hair pulled back, which doesn&#39;t help. And I think some came out with the crusty stuff. It looks fine tho, not patchy. I had the transplant at my temple area and a small bit at the front of my hairline.

Huge cheers!  Getting FFS seams to be the kind of pain and bruising as getting your face smashed with a shovel... seriously wish there was a magically better surgery that wasn&#39;t so horrible.

To someone that has undergone SRS and FFS, how would you compare the recoveries?

I recently underwent SRS about 4 weeks ago, and wow, has my recovery been rough...

First, congratulations on you FFS surgery! 💙💖🤍💖💙
</p>
<p>
Second, how did you pay for FT? I’m looking around for surgeons and I would like to know my options if any when it comes to FT FFS. I’m not exactly in the money and so far my only options are Drs covered by IL Medicaid and possibly getting a scholarship from Point of Pride. Thank you!

It&#39;s nice to know what I might be in for. I had planed to be there about a year ago, but with COVID and the Australian board being virtual shut, there wasn&#39;t too much I could do about it. It&#39;s still on my list; weather start of next year or the next.

OMG thank your soooooooooo much for taking the time to share your experience you have no idea how helpful your have been to me. I have been having crazy dreams about my upcoming ffs and getting really nervous.
</p>
<p>
Except for the hair transplant, trachia shave, and my face / neck lift we have the same ffs so this really put me at ease. Looking so forward to seeing you progress. Mine is July 22nd!.

I’m prepared for it to be pretty bad now… and it sounds like a lot of people have a rough time.  With time, I think it’s easy to leave the nasty details in the past.  And I think people try to put a rosy tint to their experiences sometimes, or just don’t want to get so personal about their darker moments for a variety of reasons.  But I appreciate hearing about the unvarnished reality!

That’s exactly the reason why I made this post, because I knew the first tough days would have been (almost) forgotten after a few weeks, but it’s important to know what to expect and to be prepared for it

You can add this post (and the follow up) to the wiki if you want, I think it could be interesting for a lot of girls

Could serrapeptase be your friend?   If you are past the point it could provoke bleeding, please consider it.
