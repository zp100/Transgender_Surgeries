Hi! I went to Dr Jennifer T. Anger at ucsd on march 7th 2024. I’m honestly not happy with my aesthetic results whatsoever. She used the ppt method and my canal is over 7 inches deep and I have no complaints. My clit is the wrong shape, my inner labia are so horribly misshapen and uneven that it looks like I have one. My outer labia look like a separated scrotum. I do not recommend ucsd for srs. Dr Anger is a very polite and respectful surgeon and the staff are wonderful. However my result is subpar. Part of the issue is my own weight and that I gained a significant amount 6 months after getting srs. Please help me and please strongly reconsider ucsd gender care for srs.

In full honestly looking back, I should’ve been denied srs until I lost more weight to begin with. I do plan on losing weight before any revision for the best chances of having it look normal.

As a trans man who has seen a lot of cis vulvas, I can say for myself that yours looks fine. There is nothing wrong with the shape of your clitoris. And you have clearly visible labia minora and labia majora. The labia majora may seem too big to you, but that is also the case naturally with cis women. If you want an aesthetic revision, that is certainly possible; find an experienced doctor for that.

I thought the clitoris wasn’t supposed to be shaped like a upside down v, ty for the advice though. I do plan on getting an aesthetic revision. I have one scheduled with the same surgeon if I can’t get on the books for another within a year.

Yes this is honestly very cis passing, also the shape of the clit is really different so everyone. It usually just feels like a button
