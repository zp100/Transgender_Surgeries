tldr; SERIOUSLY consider Guerrero and his team. For ease, price, comfort, quality, speed, and expertise.
</p>
<p>
Hey everyone! I don’t post often but I thought it was important to mention something that might be able to help other girls.
</p>
<p>
I did a consult road-trip. By that I mean I consulted with several different surgeons and got quotes, recommendations, and developed thoughts on each of them.
</p>
<p>
One thing is consistent across the board; facial feminization is more expensive than ever. Staggeringly so.
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t matter if it’s Keojampa, Deschamps-Braly, Mardirossian, Jumaily, etc. FFS is truly feeling completely out of reach for the average girl.
</p>
<p>
Just a couple of years ago you could get top notch work for under $50k, but no one I talked to had rates anywhere near that… with a few exceptions.
</p>
<p>
I talked to several surgeons internationally who had much better rates, including FacialTeam, but one stood out.
</p>
<p>
Or, I should say, a team stood out.
</p>
<p>
Moises Guerrero works alongside Fabian Chavez and others to do work that I feel is comparable to some of the best surgeons in the States. Guerrero has a ton of experience with craniomaxillofacial surgery, and Chavez makes some of the cutest noses I’ve ever seen. It’s something I hadn’t considered before, but FFS surgeons aren’t usually all that great with noses.
</p>
<p>
The forehead and jaw is super technical, but the nose is different. The nose is more art than anything. It sits in the middle of your face and kinda sets the flavor for the entire thing. It isn’t what I was most dysphoric about but it’s come to be super important to me. Having experts in their fields working on you together makes SO much sense. Plus it ensures that your surgeon isn’t exhausted by the time they get to your nose at the end. You have someone focused on it.
</p>
<p>
And before they even touch your face they begin surgical planning with 3D printed skulls, created from your CT scan.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the actual surgical capabilities and teamwork, there’s a major bonus that I couldn’t find literally anywhere else; the aftercare.
</p>
<p>
A stay at a recovery house where there are nurses catering to you 24/7, a chef with a menu customized for you, transportation to help you get around, and amazing attention to detail in setting everything up by the team’s super knowledgeable coordinator.
</p>
<p>
ALL of this (the surgery, the driver, the recovery facility, the nurses, the chef, the food, the medication) is all included in the price.
</p>
<p>
A price SIGNIFICANTLY less than in the states. Tens of thousands of dollars. I was quoted over $100k for one of the top surgeons in the US and they didn’t include any of this.
</p>
<p>
Yet Guerrero’s team quoted me at less than $40k.
</p>
<p>
For everything. Period.
</p>
<p>
PLUS the waiting list isn’t years long.
</p>
<p>
He’s certified, qualified, surrounds himself with the best people, does his work out of a nice hospital, etc. His coordinator showed me that Mexico can and should be considered a valid option. It’s not like everyone assumes it would be. There are great surgeons everywhere. All over the world. Not just in the US.
</p>
<p>
That said, I didn’t end up choosing his team. ONLY because I’m likely going to be able to get my surgery reimbursed by insurance by going to another surgeon.
</p>
<p>
But not everyone is in that position. Many people have to save up and pay out of pocket, and I’d honestly feel terrible if I didn’t tell my sisters about this team.
</p>
<p>
The fact that I almost chose him over the top tier surgeons I talked to truly says a lot, because I’m picky af. I’m taking FFS extremely seriously and wouldn’t consider anyone who didn’t meet my expectations.
</p>
<p>
Guerrero’s team, and especially their coordinator, exceeded them. I was calling it the “get snatched and chill” package, because it was so easy.
</p>
<p>
I’m actually kind of sad that I’m not going with them at this point. I was legitimately excited. But the insurance opportunity that I have is too good to pass up.
</p>
<p>
But it could be your way forward. I have a feeling we’re going to be hearing a lot more about him in the coming years. Get in before he gets a Deschamps-Braly or Keojampa-length waiting list.

was insanely helpful and made the entire experience a dream. The work she did made my life significantly easier.
</p>
<p>
They can also do facial masculinization, but I’m not familiar with that work so I don’t feel comfortable speaking on it at length, but it’s worth mentioning for the boys out there.

Hmm, funny you didn&#39;t get any comments. I wonder why? They sound good. I&#39;m in Australia, so every trans girl who needs FFS is really stuffed if she isn&#39;t well-off.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for that.
