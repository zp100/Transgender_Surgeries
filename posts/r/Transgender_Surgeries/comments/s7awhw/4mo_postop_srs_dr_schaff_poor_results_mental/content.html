Non related, but this is the first post I’ve ever seen that is bad about dr Schaffer. I am planning on having my surgery with him and I am curious if you think he is a bad surgeon, or this is an unfortunate case ?

Atleast he is an asshole and from what I&#39;ve heard (anecdotal) he don&#39;t care as much about his bad results then about his good ones. (can&#39;t proof only got it told by other girls)

He&#39;s openly transphobic. At least from what I read on
<a href="/r/germantrans">r/germantrans</a>
he recently was in an interview in which he made some shitty comments regarding trans people. And then there&#39;s a good amount of anecdotes of him being an ass to his patients.

For anyone wondering about this, he basically said that he requires a letter from a psychologist because being trans is a trend especially with young people and he needs to know that his patients are actually trans.

To be fair every surgeon in Germany requires two letters from a psychologist, as it is our current law :/

Not really. Schaff usually isn&#39;t covered by insurance anyway and he only needs a single letter from a psychologist. The ton of documents you need are mostly bs by insurance companies, not something you legally need

See my post on the consultation that I had. Came off as an arrogant, sexist prick pretty much. I&#39;m not surprised he&#39;s ignoring the bad outcomes.

Others are doing it too here in Germany and aren&#39;t those kind of assholes.

Also i would also judge based on how they treat ppl with bad results, cause it can happen to you to.

Totally understandable, but if you would look in this wiki you would see others results too ;)

I know it cause I&#39;ve made mine public and I was in Munich with Dr. Klemens from team Markovsky.

Ik about yours, and the result is really nice, but apart from yours, and some from schaff, and like one from morath, I’ve seen nothing. The info abt germany in general is very lacking and more confusing when you’re not german.

Maybe take a look at
<a href="/r/germantrans" rel="nofollow">r/germantrans</a>
and google translate a bit. The term you&#39;d have to search for is &#34;GaOP&#34;, some say &#34;SRS&#34; too though
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s definitely hard to find pics. Heß, Schaff, Markovsky, Taskov and Morath get consistently recommended. Schaff is known to be an asshole to his patients and pretty transphobic but I haven&#39;t heard bad things about his work until now.

Understandable and sadly it&#39;s not much better if you are German. You then can ask in your local support group but that&#39;s it. And in mine there are like 2 others that had GRS already, both in Hamburg and they just say it&#39;s &#34;good&#34; but don&#39;t go into details or technical stuff :/

Idk, I’m also thinking of waiting lists and stuff. How much did you wait for your dr (I’m paying out of pocket btw, if it has any relevancekr

Dunno about paying out of pocket, but my surgeons waiting list is like round about 6 month. I&#39;ve asked for my surgery date early March and got my preferred date end of August

Well, you could try using lidocaine on the “pain point.”  Narrowness was a problem a lot of earlier PI surgeries seemed to have.

I’m sending you so much love, sweetie. You’ve already gone through a lot, I’m proud of yourself. Time heals…, that’s all I can say. Hope it gets better eventually, and that you can find a solution.

Not sure what kind of lubrication u use...and after care salb. There are some that make the vagina softer while dilation. It is recommended that more often dilating is train the muscles which are to date your pain point. In my case It took around 6 to 8 month with delating 3 times per day reaching the goal.

I had surgery with Dr Schaff and a complication as well(fistula). I’m still pretty happy with the results because dilation is fairly easy and I have about 17+ cm of depth.  I think Dr Schaff is a relatively good surgeon, but he needs to be paired with a good Gynecologist. My situation was not good with the fistula. However, the support of Dr Hertwig in Berlin. Made it bearable. I had an appointment everyweek to check how the healing process went. Now I’m eager to do the second operation to get the fistula fixed and the other tweaks that comes with the second op.
