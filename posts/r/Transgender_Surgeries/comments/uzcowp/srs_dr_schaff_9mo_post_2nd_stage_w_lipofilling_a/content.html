starting to feel happy about the aesthetics, the added fat really closed it up nicely.

<p>
i have to wait a few weeks to see if the lipofilling and botox injection are going to make penetration painless...

Would you mind telling me more about the Botox? First time hearing this. And penetration hurts a little fit me cause I‚Äôm very tight, so if there‚Äôs other things I can do that are non surgically üòÖ

the muscle can stay very tensed up in the surgery area due to trauma, so the botox basically put them to sleep for a few months. will update here with results

Can I ask what was done on the second operation? I had my surgery with Dr Schaff 6 weeks ago and I am wondering which improvements can be done. Looking at mine how it is now I might think on how I want it to look like but it is still too swelling to tell how close that will be already.  Also, on a previous post you mentioned a pain point in the upper wall right? Was that a wound, hyper granulation tissue or something or mostly the tightness of the muscles?
