<p>
Yesterday I had full-depth vaginoplasty with Dr. Chris McClung in Columbus, Ohio. I wanted to make this post earlier, but I’ve been very fatigued (naturally) and have basically been nonstop sleeping.
</p>
<p>
Im a 21 year old trans female, so I’ve underwent this surgery at a very young age. Thankfully due to a 2016 decision, Ohio Medicaid covers all costs for this surgery. I haven’t had to pay a dime, which im extremely grateful for.
</p>
<p>
As far as pain goes, it’s honestly not too bad. I elected to have an epidural to help with post-op pain, so I’ve taken very little pain meds (only when the epidural messes up, which it has twice now). The epidural was uncomfortable when installed right before surgery, but is now barely noticeable. For the last day I was unable to lift my right leg as the epidural had numbed the muscles in that region, but as of an hour or so ago I can love it up and down now! The epidural has kinked up twice now and blocked the medicine from getting into my system resulting in a fair bit of discomfort. I’m still learning the difference between discomfort and pain as there’s a very blurred line between the two. The discomfort is constant, whereas pain flares every now and again. I’ve been given Tylenol mostly for pain, but occasionally I’ve been given Oxicodone.
</p>
<p>
I was cleared for solid food today (yay!) and have been eating alright, still not much of an appetite but we’re getting there. I’m very much looking forward to getting back home on Sunday and having all of these tubes removed from my body. Those are by far the most uncomfortable parts.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I figured I’d share my experience with the great Christopher McClung as there’s not much info out there about him. He truly is amazing, one of the sweetest guys you’ll meet who really cares for his patients. I can’t recommend him enough.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, ask away!

Ive seen him once for a possible orchi and grs down the line (I have a few requirements to meet that may take me a year or two) he seems really sweet and considerate. I&#39;m really happy to hear this about him.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for sharing. looking forward to hearing more about your experience if you ever feel up for sharing more.

I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s a great guy! Congratulations on the operation!
</p>
<p>
How do you feel about the results after a couple weeks past (mostly asking about visually)? How long was your wait between consultation and operation? Any surprises?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m considering McClung for a potential future operation, so I&#39;m happy for both of us that you had a positive experience!

I couldn’t recommend him enough! He’s so sweet and caring, he’s definitely someone I feel I can trust will help out if any complications arise.
</p>
<p>
Visually, for me, things look really good. I’ll be posting a 4 weeks out picture tomorrow, but I couldn’t be more pleased with how it looks visually, even at this early stage.
</p>
<p>
I had my initial consultation with him on August 5th, 2020. I didn’t have any of my letters from the required people (Hormone doctor, therapist, psychiatrist) and had no hair removal done at that point. Had I come with those things in hand, he could’ve scheduled me as early as February-March. My surgery was set for April initially but another unrelated medical issue got in the way and I had to delay my surgery because of it, but the wait time is really none at all, and even if it is a few months, they fly by.
</p>
<p>
I’m so happy for you! It’s certainly a journey, but every day feels better and I can feel that mental/physical alignment slowly falling into place. It’s a really good feeling ❤️

How was hair removal and did you manage the pain down there?

He certainly did some of the loveliest work I’ve seen with you. Your healing looks remarkable. Sorry to be so full of questions, but what was his hair removal requirement? Did he have BMI parameters?

He did require at least some form of hair removal, but he didn’t care whether it was laser or electrolysis. He never explicitly said if there were any BMI parameters

I’ve had 20+ hours of electrolysis so far. I’m really eager to see how far out he’s already scheduled. He’s about a four hour drive from me. I’m at my one year mark, have all my letters, and am ready to get it done.

With all of those things in hand, it’ll most definitely be within the year. He was ready to schedule me just 4 months out but I didn’t have the required hair removal done yet

One hopes. I’d really like to get it done before I have to start a new deductible year with my insurance.
