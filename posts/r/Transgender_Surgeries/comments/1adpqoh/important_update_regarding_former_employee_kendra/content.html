We hope this message finds you well. We feel it&#39;s essential to update you on a matter involving a former employee, Kendra, who was previously associated with Kamol Cosmetic Hospital.
</p>
<p>
Despite the opportunities provided and the trust extended to Kendra Von Airheart to represent our hospital as a Customer Care Liaison, it has come to light that she misrepresented her language abilities, particularly in Spanish. This misrepresentation was brought to our attention when a Spanish-speaking patient sought assistance, and Kendra was unable to effectively communicate in Spanish.
</p>
<p>
Regrettably, Kendra&#39;s employment with Kamol Cosmetic Hospital was terminated on December 25th due to her actions. She was provided with her last salary promptly.
</p>
<p>
However, it has come to our attention that, upon departure, Kendra took with her a hospital-issued laptop and iPhone, both of which are essential tools provided for her work. Despite our efforts to resolve the matter amicably, she has refused to return these items.
</p>
<p>
We want to emphasize that we take matters of honesty, integrity, and property very seriously. The theft of company property is a severe breach of trust and goes against the principles we uphold at Kamol Cosmetic Hospital. Such actions not only compromise our organization&#39;s standards, which are JCI accredited, but also impact the smooth operation of our services.
</p>
<p>
We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this challenging time. If you have any concerns or questions, please feel free to reach out to us directly.
</p>
<p>
Ps. If you would like to receive evidence of the theft and the police report, you can directly contact us at our public channels such as Facebook, Instagram, whatsapp and on our email.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your continued support.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
Kamol Cosmetic Hospital

OK... this message seems highly suspect.
</p>
<p>
For one, if this is indeed Kamol Hospital - which there seem to be a number of red flags which would indicate it is not - why would you air the dirty laundry of a former employee / internal grievance here?   I mean, letting the community know that you had to let an employee go due to problems - and even
<em>
possibly
</em>
mentioning the first name of the employee in the context that no one should expect any Kamol-related communication from them is one thing.  But detailing issues which rightly should be matters for your internal team, and possibly your legal representatives, in an open public forum like this is just unprofessional.
</p>
<p>
And to offer to produce &#34;proof&#34; by way of evidence and a police report?  That is absolutely unconscionable.   This is not information anyone here needs to know.
</p>
<p>
Again, I highly doubt this account is related to Kamol Hospital, or any of its current employees, in any sort of professional manner.  Rather, it has the air of someone with grievances against Kamol trying - badly - to sow seeds of concern where they are not warranted.
</p>
<p>
Oh - and IF this was a legit post, you would be in violation of both Rules #6 and #8 I believe.

This is part of what leads me to believe that this account is, in fact, NOT Kamol Hospital.  Why would they delete the post?  Why is the account virtually unknown?
</p>
<p>
If it is a genuine account, it really should have the proper flair added, and they should provide some degree of verification to the mods.  This would go a long way towards providing a degree of trust to the community in general that this is coming from &#39;the source&#39;, and not just some random account.
</p>
<p>
And a legitimate hospital - regardless of what country it is in - should NEVER offer to hand out randomly police reports or other internal evidence which may contain personal information that the general population of the internet has no business accessing.  It is irrelevant to the issue as it would impact patients and potential patients.
</p>
<p>
Just my opinion, of course.  But this throws up a number of red flags.

It fits the long term pattern of posts from this account and others. I also get to see things that others won’t because I’m here all the time and the mod stuff.
</p>
<p>
The previous post was a scan of some kind of legal document in Thai.

That being the case, I would strongly encourage them to follow the rules then.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Put flair on indicating that it is a commercial account
</li>
<li>
Post only in english - even documents which they may deem useful to the community.
</li>
<li>
Don&#39;t directly discuss other people - which is what they are doing here.  Simple announcements indicating that they are addressing issues, and that people should be wary of contact from a particular person (first name is probably enough) should be sufficient.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those would be my takes.
</p>
<p>
I appreciate what you, and the others, do to keep things on track here.  It just seems like these specific posts have fallen through the cracks a bit when it comes to some of the rules basics.  Especially with a &#39;user&#39; account that has zero visibility outside of these posts.

Dear MischiefThePony, this is the OFFICIAL account of Kamol Cosmetic Hospital, as other people already understood.
</p>
<p>
Just to reply to your bullets
</p>
<ol>
<li>
&#34;Moderators assign user flair to disclose that the user either has or could be perceived to have a commercial interest&#34;. This means I CAN&#39;T flair myself. More over, at the moment we are not advertising, not promoting ourselves whatsoever and not giving any recommendations on pictures etc,.
</li>
<li>
Moderators approve all posts, this means they didn&#39;t perceive this one as suspicious or violating any of the Community rules.
</li>
<li>
We are not discussing other people we are just explaining what happened with our former employee who is still posting and using her name to post on behalf of Kamol Hospital. We want to let the community know that this person has violated the law of trust and respect towards this organisation, the staff and last but not least all the patients who trusted her persona. We can&#39;t not disclose her name as she is
<strong>
still
</strong>
in possession of the hospital&#39;s properties and she is
<strong>
still
</strong>
acting like if she works for this Hospital, whilst
<strong>
she&#39;s not.
</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I hope I was clear enough with this post and that all doubts about the reliability of this account are finally sorted.
</p>
<p>
Best regards,
</p>
<p>
Kamol Cosmetic Hospital

This is entirely false, sick and disturbing, even by Kamol Hospital standards! The hospital had over three weeks to resolve this issue, but as anyone who has ever had the misfortune opportunity to work with Kamol, one already knows communication is next to impossible. Simply put,  I am owed airfare home, my college degrees needed to be returned, they had them for my supposed work visa. I have also demanded that my name be removed from any and all reviews, as the customer service I provided was influential in attracting and keeping clients. Lies are a big part of the Kamol business model, and I was fired after completing the agreed upon probation. I attempted and can prove I contacted the manager daily, but my messages went unanswered. There is definitely a string of transphobic homophobic and racist comments made by the director of the hospital. It was by far the most toxic and awful place I have ever worked. There is only one trans employee left, and when her probation is over, she will most likely be fired too. This post on the Kamol Facebook and Reddit page is just another example of how unprofessional this hospital has become. Why have NO Kamol employees contacted me? Kendra
