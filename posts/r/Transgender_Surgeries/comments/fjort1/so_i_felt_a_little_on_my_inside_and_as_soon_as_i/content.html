Did you get any laser or electrolysis before the operation?  Did the say they would remove all the hair follicles or just what was left?

This sounds like a glaring violation of informed consent.  Your surgeon lied to you, and I recommend you get a malpractice lawyer.

Not really a violation of informed consent, and also unlikely to be a surgeon purposely lying.
</p>
<p>
Based on the OP and the sheer amount of hair, it sounds like the follicle scraping was inadvertently not or improperly done.  But I do agree, that a malpractice lawyer should be consulted / retained.

Right.  Negligence over malice.  Not that there&#39;s much of a difference.  Either way, there&#39;s no way this isn&#39;t malpractice.

I thought it was pretty well established by now that scraping does a mediocre job at best?

I doubt there is any stats on it, but it certainly does seem that it is indeed mediocre as far as ensuring that
<em>
all
</em>
the hair is removed (what everyone desires as even just a few hairs missed can cause irritation).  But the OPs post has the impression that basically none was removed vs the normal bulk removal w/ leftovers.   Imho, that could only really happen if the scraping step, inadvertently wasn’t done at all or was improperly done to an extent that it had the same effect.  In a similar vein or level of negligence as surgeons leaving forceps &amp; other surgical implements inside patients.

I&#39;m so, so sorry and I mean that from the depths of my heart. Your story has me in tears and I wish I could be there to just hug you!! No one deserves this, much less from something you worked so so hard for.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just a random human on the other side of the world but I love you and my heart is with you even though I cant help. God bless you and thank you for sharing your story and I wish you nothing but better things that you deserve from here on. Please stay strong even if the obstacles you face are ones no one could ever deserve to deal with. &lt;3

That is crazy! There are too many instances of this happening after the surgeon has told their patient that the hair follicles would be burned out during the procedure and that not being true. I don’t even know what to say. 🥺

Interesting. The surgeon I’m looking to see says they cauterize the follicles in the procedure they use.

Have you looked into electrolysis? I&#39;ve heard of people getting hair removed inside via electrolysis.

Only ones I&#39;ve heard say you don&#39;t have to do it pre-surgery are the Thai surgeons, and some of their patients are having issues too.

Brassard also says not to get hair removal as he will cauterize the follicles during the procedure.

He&#39;s not a liar. I dunno what that person is on about. I had surgery with brassard about 11 months ago and I&#39;ve had no significant trouble with hair growth. I had one hair about an inch inside on the top surface near the line where tissue that once was shaft and scrotum skin meet, but I can&#39;t even find it anymore. I had a gyno check it out and she said she couldn&#39;t find anything more than a single little white hair. She and a liaison from montreal said it was likely weakened from being pulled out during dilation/sex, as well as  tissue adapting to its new internal environment.
</p>
<p>
Montreal says quite clearly that if you expect a perfect, hair-free result then extensive removal needs to be carried out and completed a full year before surgery. They really do a great job addressing this issue and work extremely diligently to provide the best result they can. This shit is complicated though and people who freak out over minor mistakes like mine are a) too impatient and b) unrealistic in their expectations.

It sounds really bad, especially at such a time when the whole healthcare system is overloaded due to Covid-19 :( Honey, I think you need more intervention. Let&#39;s think through this, and get help after the outbreak of Covid-19 is over.
</p>
<p>
If you want to report the case, and help other transwomen in Sweden so that they don&#39;t end up having hairs inside their vagina canal, probably you can have a check of this page:

It’s very telling how you feel about not being able to share real stories. In the trans community we’re only allowed to tell everyone how great &amp; perfect all the surgeries are, &amp; those with issues are silenced. When you do share you’re said to be a fake TERF. Which leads more to get surgeries they later regret. I’d do anything to wake up with a cis vagina but after years of researching, contemplating, &amp; having experiences I’ve determined it’s just not there yet. And even when/if I do it will be a decision made after I’m already married &amp; it’s decided it’s needed. Yet even the trans community will tell pre/non-op trans ppl how we’re not valid. It’s sickening. Reddit will make it seem like you just hop in a hospital bed &amp; boom you all a sudden have nice new pretty lips between your legs you’re ready to rock the world with. Like it’s getting a tattoo or something. It’s a real damned surgery with tons to go wrong &amp; tons of regret for so many.
