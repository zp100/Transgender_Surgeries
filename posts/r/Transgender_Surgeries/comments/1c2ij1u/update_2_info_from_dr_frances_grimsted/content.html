So you‚Äôre going to be okay? Rumer was already on my ‚ÄúUnder No Circumstances, Even if Hell Freezes Over‚Äùlist but I think that‚Äôll be in bold print, italicized, and underlined now. So sorry you had to deal with this, love.

I wish people learned about rumer the second they signed up to begin hormone therapy. Shes a notorious wackjob doctor who has her staff post positive reviews for her everywhere, meanwhile shes constantly botching surgeries left and right. People should know about her IMMEDIATELY if they ever consider bottom surgery.

Pennsylvania, I believe (Ardmore).  You can look her up - just don&#39;t believe any of the lies on her sites, social media, or elsewhere that provide glowing reviews.

She&#39;s in eastern Pennsylvania, close to Philadelphia. She&#39;s one of the few doctors that takes insurance and is in-state for me, but I would pay 100% OOP before going to her for bottom

or
</em>
top surgery.

So as a general rule always let any trans person in Pennsylvania know that:
</p>
<p>
<em>
Dr Cat Rumor
</em>
is out to absolutely destroy pussy like Luka Magnotta
</p>
<p>
While humor may be inappropriate here-  and I feel for OP and hope for a speedy recovery -
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think anyone can get a cease and desist for what was just said due to
<em>
coincidental
</em>
phonetically similar name and we need a way to talk about these  individuals. Turning them into a meme is a tried and true method.
</p>
<p>
Alternatives
</p>
<p>
<em>
Dr Cat Ruiner
</em>
<em>
Dr Pussy Ruiner
</em>
</p>
<p>
Also is there a full list of these dangerous and harmful surgeons - hopefully with equally pun worthy names? I&#39;d like to have a list around for the safety of friends and partners

Does any such &#34;Under No Circumstances, Even if Hell Freezes Over&#34; list actually exist? (I mean as an actual physical list that other people can read, not just a mental list). Because I would be very interested in seeing a list of &#34;blacklisted&#34; surgeons in case I decide to have any more transition surgeries in the future.

Thanks for going to the hospital and keeping every part disinfected and clean. Follow their instructions and do not go to the surgeon. Keep ER informed and any changes to situation that calls for er don‚Äôt hesitate! It looks like a long arduous process but one step at a time and keeping safe and healthy is the first step! We are all following up your posts.

Been so worried for you so this is definitely a positive update. What are your next steps? Will it all heal up naturally do they think or are you looking for revision work?
</p>
<p>
Again, so so thankful you&#39;re okay. Strength and courage to you.

This is not up voted enough! My heart goes out to OP. I wish we could do more, Go Fund Me or something to help with the costs of a correction?!

I&#39;ve seen many results, none as disheartening as these. Rumer is dangerous to our community and should have her license revoked.

<p>
At this point, it&#39;s probably going to have to be healed inside-out. When surgical sites have complications like this, it&#39;s usually best practice for wound care to not try stitching things back and instead leave things open to allow discharge and fluids to weep out and healing to start deep and move its way outwards.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad you have doctors helping you now, OP. I wish you as smooth a healing journey as possible from here on out!

I&#39;m glad you&#39;re getting qualified help. I&#39;m not at all surprised to hear you have some necrosis (and it would have advanced without intervention). That was my primary concern from your presentation yesterday. Pretty scary stuff.
</p>
<p>
It may still get worse before it gets better, so please stay on top of seeing a REAL specialist. That&#39;s beyond &#34;complications&#34;.

I went to an OBGYN trained in gender affirming care. Her team assessed the damages and took very good care of me. It has been cleaned and we were given instructions and resources on how to keep the wound clean and help it heal.

While that still looks incredibly painful, I am so happy that you found someone competent to address the issues.  Follow all of their directions, get as much rest as you can, and if *anything* starts to feel off or you get a fever get back to the doctor as soon as you can.  Now that things are being treated correctly hopefully your body will heal up quickly and you can move ahead.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes for continued recovery, healing, and peace. üíúüíú

If I was you, I would message everyone you can who Rumer did surgery on , get them all together ( even just in a group chat and you all should take that dr to court for everything she is worth. Leave her nothing.

I am not on Medicaid but medi-cal. This is why I am scared to go to the surgeons that accept my insurance. I am scared that there will be large issues due to the person not caring or from them not working on trans patients. (I&#39;m a brother not a sister) Same with top. I&#39;m scared that the surgeons that&#39;ll cover top for me (I want anchor for personal reasons) will mess things up.
</p>
<p>
I really don&#39;t trust the surgeons that accept state provided healthcare.

Maybe I shouldn&#39;t say what I&#39;m about to say, but I&#39;m both glad and impressed at the same time about the fact you&#39;re taking it so well and in such a calm and stoic way.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d be freaking out, panicking and almost unable to be functional. It looks so gruesome to me...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so sorry this has happened to you and you have to deal with it. Stay strong and rest a lot so it can heal quickly.

Best wishes.

All I have to say is holy fuck you got butchered. I‚Äôd be balling my eyes out if this happened to me. Freaks me out some. This is what freaks me out that there isn‚Äôt a lot of info on the Kaiser Nor Cal SRS surgeons.Thing is I really don‚Äôt have the money to go anywhere else. I mean hopefully since I want minimal depth that means there should be less chance of complications.

I am glad Dr Grimstad is taking good care of you. I worked with her team when I was in the process of getting my hysterectomy (FTM, post op phallo) and she was wonderful. They have a social worker that is a trans woman on their team as well (her name is Elizabeth). These kinds of complications are really hard emotionally, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to them for more support.  Wishing you lots of good healing vibes.

Quite funny, that&#39;s exactly how my vagina looked like at the 2 week mark with Rumer. Everything heeled up nicely eventually somehow, but I have a lack there of any labia, even after labiaplasty.

So they are just leaving it like that? What the actual fuck? Nope. Never going to this doctor. I am so sorry you&#39;ve had this experience. This is seriously a worst case scenario and makes me worried for you.

Dr. Grimsted&#39;s team taught me how to clean and dress the wounds. Because there is no solid epithelial tissue along the vulva it cannot be stitched back together. It needs to be filled in with new tissue from the bottom up.

Sue. With absolutely no hesitation. Seen internal legal aid and make this fraud for everything she has and find yourself a surgeon who takes pride in their craft and human well being. This looks like a hate crime, not the work of a surgeon. This was an act of violence towards the transgender community and you were the means of displaying it. Start a go fund me to have this correct immediately.

If there is any indication this was anything more than a complication (as dehiscence, even internally, is a known complication in PI vaginoplasties) we will definitely sue. I am fortunate enough to have the financial resources for a lawsuit without need for crowd funding.

So glad you were able to get some competent help! Is the doctor close to you so you can get back to see them if needed? It&#39;s probably kinda tough being in Maine, I imagine major medical centers may be few and far between.

Did they close the wounds for you yet? Cause that should be what they should be focusing on the most at this point. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. A lot of people get revisions, so don‚Äôt think that you‚Äôre different for having to get one or two revisions. I really hope you get scheduled for a revision very soon because I do not want there to be any more necrosis than you have already had, which should‚Äôve been none. Rumer is a horrible surgeon, and it is not your fault for not knowing that. Stay safe and keep in contact with your revision surgeon! ‚ù§Ô∏è

My wounds are slowly healing! I&#39;m not worried about the necrosis because it doesn&#39;t seem to be spreading. I&#39;ll post an update after my next visit with Dr. Grimsted.
</p>
<p>
Generally revisions aren&#39;t done until 6 months out. And at this moment I kinda don&#39;t want to go through another surgery and recovery period even if it would be shorter than this one. My boyfriend is very supportive and is giving me the confidence I need to make my own decisions about my body. I am very appreciative of him.

Honestly, I truly feel like a skin graft would be your best bet. It‚Äôs understating for sure if your not wanting a revision, but it‚Äôs not that bad. There‚Äôs enough to work with and I think if you find the right surgeon it can really be a pretty puss. I really hope the best for you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è and start a gofund me ! Look into dr.min jun or dr.banks personally I think they do art and sculpt them pussys outta clay and water just putting it out there üíãüòÇ

It actually doesn&#39;t hurt at all. Everything is in proper order except for my labia. Although this doesn&#39;t mean I will forget what that witch put me through. That emotional pain will stay with me for a while.
