Since these posts have been so helpful for me in my SRS journey I wanted to provide my own.

<strong>
Reasons I Chose Dr. Ramineni
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was interested in him and Dr. Del Corral because of their proximity to me and I had heard great things about both. The big reason I ended up choosing Ramineni was I honestly felt like I had been blown off by Del Corral in my consultation and Ramineni was very patient in answering my questions and talked to me like I was a real person. Plus a big upside was that he doesn’t require hair removal and the closest electrolysis place that was willing to do my genitals was an hour away which would’ve been very difficult to make work because I was working two jobs at the time (about 50 hours a week with crazy hours) and I was willing to accept the possible repercussions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Timeline
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I originally consulted with him in January of 2021 and had a date for July 2021 but I had some unexpected health issues crop up in early June as a result of a food intolerance (basically overnight eating peanuts made my insides revolt) and I pushed my date back just to be safe. I cloud’ve gotten in earlier but January worked better for my job and my post-surgery caregiver. His team at the office were great with helping me get everything sorted out through this process. I was instructed to stop taking my hormones two weeks before surgery which was honestly pretty miserable but if not anything else it helped strengthen my resolve to get the surgery over with.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surgery and Hospital Stay
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was the first surgery of the day which was a blessing even if waking up at five in the morning was pretty brutal. The nurse helping me out pre-surgery and the anesthesia team were amazing and they all seemed just as excited as me. I believe the surgery itself took two and half to three hours. The next few days in the hospital went more or less okay. My nurses were almost universally fantastic despite how hectic my floor was because healthcare workers are truly God’s gift upon the earth. My surgeon’s assistant visited me one the second day to make sure everything looked okay and Dr. Ramineni visited me on the third day to check in with me and answer any questions I had. The third day I started walking which went off without a hitch and I was able to do a lap around the nurses station during the day and again that night before bed. The fourth day I was visited by a pelvic floor therapist who walked me through relaxation techniques, correct posture, and helped me walk up and down a flight of stairs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Hotel Stay
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I stayed in Falls Church just outside of D.C. until the upcoming Monday when I had my follow up appointment. This was also more or less fine if not pretty boring. I made a point of walking as much as I possibly could during this time and doing at least two flights of stairs a day. Also showering was almost euphoric after marinating in my own nastiness for half a week.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Follow Up Appointment and Drive Home
</strong>
</p>
<p>
He took out my catheter and removed my packing which is just as crazy as everyone describes. I got about 75% of the way through it with no issues when he jinxed me by saying ’You’re doing really well, this is where most people are screaming in pain.’ That last 25% brought tears to my eyes and was probably the worst pain I experienced during the whole recovery process. From there he looked me over, taught me how to dilate, and sent me on my way. From there I went straight home which was an hour and half car ride that went smoothly with the help of a donut cushion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery at Home Week Two to Three
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The biggest issue I had at this point was that I still hadn’t pooped. I was told to drink about a quarter of a bottle of magnesium citrate and that finally got things moving but it was severely unpleasant and was a multiple hour ordeal. Once that was conquered I was pretty mobile and I was able to do most everything I needed to do around the house though it wasn’t necessarily easy. By the end of week two I was walking two blocks to get my coffee in the morning and by the third week I was driving w/o my donut cushion and more or less entirely self-reliant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Three Week Follow Up
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had my friend drive me up to D.C. even though I was told I could do it virtually if I wanted because I wanted him to see everything firsthand. During the follow up everyone seemed surprised how fast my recovery has been and he told me everything looked great. I had five or six questions and he answered them all thoroughly and confidently. He cleared me to going back to most of my normal activity at week four including swimming and light jogging.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Present Day
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This week I’ve really felt like myself again. I’m still wearing pads to soak up discharge and I can only drive about 45 minutes to an hour before I get too uncomfortable that I have to stop but other than that my life has felt surprisingly average. I’m getting back into the swing of hiking now which is my happy place and it’s greatly improved my mental health. For my other outdoor enthusiasts trekking poles are a must. In another week and a half I’m going back to work where I’ll be on my feet for eight hours at a time which may or may not be an issue but I’m honestly excited to see my coworkers again and have my old life back because days start getting pretty weird when you don’t have anything to do all day. I also want to acknowledge that I’m incredibly lucky that my recovery experience has been as easy as it has been so far. I know that this isn’t typically and I am truly blessed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Tips
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
GET YOUR NURSES SMALL GIFTS! I got a bunch of $5 Starbucks gift cards ahead of time with thank you cards and all my nurses were very appreciative and many told me that they’d never had someone do that for them. Nurses especially during the pandemic are overworked and underpaid. Showing them a little bit of appreciation will go a long way.
</li>
<li>
Laughing hard or coughing while you still have your packing in is quite painful and will feel like you’re clenching a rock.
</li>
<li>
Edibles are your friend when dilating. I got a friend to bake me a ton of weed rice krispies and consuming them in low doses really helps me loosen up. The first time I tried it I got a centimeter or two more depth.
</li>
<li>
Get fit and eat a balanced diet. I don’t believe in medical gatekeeping and I believe that regardless of your circumstances you should have access to gender affirming care but more often than not the healthier you are the easier this is going to be for you.
</li>
<li>
Try to stay positive. I’m a firm believer that the mind body connection is real and while it might seem difficult at points a little bit of positivity goes a long way.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If ya&#39;ll have anymore questions I’m an open book!

This is fantastic to read! After the one poor experience that was posted a couple months ago with Dr. Ramineni, I was worried he might get a bad rep around the sub.
</p>
<p>
I had my consult with him at the end of January and I’m scheduled March 8. Your results look fantastic and I appreciate you sharing!

I won&#39;t lie reading her story definitely freaked me out and almost made me reconsider but I&#39;m glad I stuck with my guns.

I actually questioned him directly about it and I was very satisfied with his answer and candidness. Obviously HIPAA meant he couldn’t speak to the specifics of the patient, but he broke down the possibility of it happening, what all of the treatment options were if it happens and progresses (which matched her experience of procedures). Fistulas happen (statistically 1-4% of the time depending on the surgeon), biologically everyone’s metabolism and healing rate is different so there’s a genetic component to it. His rate is typically around 1% of patients and even then a second surgery just to close them is usually sufficient. The path that lead to colostomy while it heals he stated had happened only once in his career so I assume he meant her specifically, but again HIPAA.
</p>
<p>
I’m very comfortable with him. I’ve emailed numerous additional questions since my consult and he typically responds directly with very thorough explanations. If complications occur, I’m as prepared as I can be. Even the best surgeons in the world have complications from time to time.
</p>
<p>
I’m just hoping to be properly healed enough for my top surgery on May 2 with Dr. Stranix ad UVA. 🤞🏻

That&#39;s great to hear! I&#39;m glad that you were able to get his thoughts and experience first hand! Hopefully that&#39;ll be helpful for others considering him.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also got my fingers crossed for your upcoming top surgery! So many good things so quickly!

I’m at 1:30. It’s surreal because I was originally March 22, but they had a cancellation and bumped me up. Glad I won’t be the only one in the hospital going through the recovery that week.

Generally it fixes itself because it’s caused by swelling and should be expected. More often than not it should revert to normal in 3 months or so according to my surgeon’s post-op care documents.

From my understanding it varies from surgeon to surgeon and even patient to patient for PIV. I don&#39;t remember the specifics but some surgeons utilize a gland to help with getting wet. It&#39;s also very possible that I&#39;ll still need lube in order to have full blown penetrative sex.

This is so wonderful to read. I’m scheduled with Ramineni on April 9 for vaginoplasty and am so excited and nervous. Ramineni told me he does some hybrid version of the standard penile inversion and peritoneal. Did he do that for you and if so do you understand better what it is? Of course I know I need to ask him as well. Do you have more length and/or natural lubrication and stretchiness in the canal? Thank you so much. Lewin
