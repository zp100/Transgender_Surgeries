Hi everyone.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m post op srs for 2 months.Today I tried... Well.. to masturbate and everything was fine, i even got an orgasm, it was really great, however...
</p>
<p>
I kinda... cum. I got some discharge right after it. Probably prostatic fluid? It was transparent without any smell.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what happened. And now i feel really dysphoric... If I actually cum after orgasm like a male... Im a f*cking mutant
</p>

Its normal and women can leak fluid from their glands as well when excited.  Congrats on your surgery and orgasm.

I&#39;m afab, but I can cum like that w my vagina. I think it&#39;s normal for cis women, you just never see it in porn because porn is about men and not pleasing women.

It may be from the Cowper&#39;s glands, these are typically  left in during MTF GRS and can still give some lubrication. X

Hey, sorry if this comes across as rude (not trying to, honest), but think of it like this: females lubricate when they&#39;re aroused and it can either be watery or &#34;slimy.&#34;
</p>
<p>
It can also be transparent or creamy (I have no explanation as to why but it&#39;s normal and I&#39;ve done it and am still a virgin with no STDs).
</p>
<p>
It also has no smell--the only exception is if there&#39;s a bacterial infection.
</p>
<p>
After orgasming, it all just comes out naturally because the vagina is self-cleaning and it&#39;s just like &#34;Okay, that was fun. I&#39;m done now, time to yeet this mess.&#34; Sounds like that was yours too.
</p>
<p>
So, really. You&#39;re all set. Just be careful when having fun, two months doesn&#39;t sound like a long enough recovery time for a major surgery. ✌️✌️

This is normal for women (cis or trans).  Different women have different amount and type of fluid, but you&#39;re not unusual in this.

Hi
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m postop now for 2.5 years. Just after my SRS I had the ability to &#34;choose&#34;  between kind of male orgasm including the ejaculation of some prostatic fluids or a female one. I had the same strong feelings of dysphoria when it was the male version witch happens when there was visual stimulation and a hard way of rubbing. So aware of that I followed most of the time the female path, softly build up and without visual sexual context. That way I have always multiple orgasms. I started also using progesteron-cream after reading that this can reduce the prostate. Maybe you can ask your endo about it. I noticed that after a year I could again enjoy visual stimulation and intenser sex without those terrible ejaculations. The &#34; male&#34;  version disappeared.
