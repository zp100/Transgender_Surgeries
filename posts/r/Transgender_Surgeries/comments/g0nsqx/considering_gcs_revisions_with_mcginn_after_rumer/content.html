I also posted this in ask_transgender, I hope that is okay. I had surgery with Dr. Kathy Rumer in 2017 and have mixed feelings about my results. I love the sensitivity I have but have mixed feelings about the appearance. I’ve also been having pain and bleeding during penetration. I was recommended to talk to Dr. Christine McGinn. Any experiences with Dr. McGinn for surgery, or more specifically with revisions? I’m thinking about maybe labiaplasty too. Any insight is helpful! Thank you so much 💕
</p>
<p>
In addition, if you have any questions about Rumer, feel free to ask away!

Going to McGinn after Rumer is a mixed bag. On the one hand she is going to totally make you feel like shit more than you do already for how you look and feel because she has nothing good to say about Rumer, and she is right.
</p>
<p>
That being said, she will tell you straight up whether or not she thinks she can help, and she won’t even offer to take on your case if she really doesn’t feel she can add anything. Mine was
<em>
that
</em>
bad.
</p>
<p>
I ended up going to Bowers for revisions. She made things even worse.

.
</p>
<p>
Please for everyone else following, stay away from Rumer. She destroyed my life. The photos speak for themselves, but it was her gaslighting and blaming me for my complications that completely crossed the line.
</p>
<p>
Sending you love and hope.

Hey, can you put a content warning on that link? Having just had GCS my heart absolutely breaks for that poor woman and what she has been through. I literally gasped and cried and couldn’t look through the whole thing. I’ve heard Rumer was bad from two friends who have been to her but damn this is a whole other level of bad.

How is it that certain surgeons can still operate after messing up multiple times is beyond me. I think SRS and FFS should be regulated more and surgeons who messed up badly should lose their license. How can these surgeons even sleep knowing they messed someone life up.
</p>
<p>
Isn&#39;t possible to have a sticky post in this forum listing all surgeons that have ruined people&#39;s lives because they did not do a good job.

Identifying and listing bad surgeons might involve some level of legal risk and I’m not willing to do it. There’s also disagreement over who some of them are and I’m not interested in getting into arguments over that.
</p>
<p>
However the wiki does list all surgeons and they are in there if people take the time to look. It allows moderation to be independent and fairly free of bias.

But is there a way put surgeons on a heirarchy based on the reviews and feedback they get? So the surgeons with the lowest to zero complication rate are rated higher or only list the ones that one most safe and qualified. I just feel like something needs to be done to protect the lives of transwomen from surgeons who ruin people&#39;s bodies. Just a thought.

I’ve thought about it quite a lot, and it’s a very difficult problem.
</p>
<p>
I‘ve done what I can and if people can’t be bothered to look what am I supposed to do? Any more risks legal problems and possibly getting banned from reddit.
</p>
<p>
In practice lots of people never come to reddit, and lots of those that do don’t name their surgeons or ask for advice. They don’t find these resources or any other. How do you help them?
</p>
<p>
There’s another group of surgeons that in my opinion have higher risk, but everyone always argues over these things. And there’s lots of grey areas. Personally I’m not here to argue with people and long term I think it would damage this sub and cause more harm than good.
</p>
<p>
In my particular case there are difficulties caused by moderating this sub and having made the wiki. Before that I was starting to get a fair bit of friction expressing my opinions because I was very active on reddit and quite good at making my point. It’s far worse now so I don’t do it. However you’re free to say whatever you want.

Regarding Rumer, there’s a list of questions in the wiki. It would help if you could answer any of them.

There’s probably some information on revisions in the previous discussions about Kathy Rumer.

This guy does revisions.

Apparently he can help with bleeding and pain during penetration more often than the aesthetic issues. Sadly, he is very choosy about who he sees for revisions. So don’t expect a yes from him, it’s far from certain.
</p>
<p>
He has a plastic surgeon in the same building as him who can do aesthetic revisions when the occasion calls for it.

This guy.

Definitely worth a call and an appointment, I&#39;ve seen girls results that have seen him for primary, and his results are ok in my opinion. I’ve only seen his earlier work so maybe he’s gotten better.
</p>
<p>
They work together with a third surgeon, and the whole team of them do 1-2 primary surgeries a month. Again, this was based on info from years ago.

Do you have any interesting links for this doctor? I&#39;m adding him to the wiki, but can&#39;t find much.
</p>
<p>
Just a fyi, but its helpful to write the doctors name, Dr Dmitriy Nikolavsky, so that when people are searching they can find it.

Sorry, I linked because I didn&#39;t want to misspell their names, as they both have tougher to spell names. I don&#39;t have any links, sorry.

I hope you don’t mind this question, why Mcguinn over someone who’s more known for revisions?
</p>
<p>
Im also interested in a revision for a “failed cavity, From what Ive been reading, Dr. stiller and Dr. Bluebond Langner are more known for revisions.

Nobody is really well known for revisions, except perhaps Suporn and he only does his own patients. It’s quite difficult once you get to this point.

I would say it depends on what the revision is for.  But I agree, on some cases it is pretty difficult to find a surgeon that would try to “fix” what another surgeon did.

Autumn Asphodel on YouTube went to her and had a positive experience. She talked about it years ago and you can still find the videos.
