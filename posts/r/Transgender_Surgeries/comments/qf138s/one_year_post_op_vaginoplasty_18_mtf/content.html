Hello everyone ! Before everything i would just like to do a little disclaimer about the angles and the lighting in the pictures above, i personally find my vulva 100% pretty irl and in reality the proportions seem far more accurate in the first pic than the two others so please keep in mind three pictures dont define a result !
</p>
<p>
So I’m a 18 years old french girl who was operated 11 months ago by the Dr Plainard located in Limoges, France. I just wanted to share my experience with him here and would like to say that i’m honestly so happy with the results of the surgery !
</p>
<p>
As far as sensations go, they are amazing ! I can reach orgasms through clitoral stimulation and PIV intercourse also feels really good so i can’t complain on anything.
</p>
<p>
For the aesthetics : i am really pleased with the results, in reality scars are practically non visible (my boyfriend of 10 months actually never ever noticed them even when i try to show them to him), they are only visible with a lot of light if you look closely ! I am also pleased with the appearance of my labias, i think they look very natural  !  When it comes to my clitoris, it is pretty big, i’d say a little bit bigger than an average ciswoman’s but i’m not mad about it and it’s hidden between my inner labias anyways.
</p>
<p>
Finally, talking about my dilation schedule, my surgeon advised me to dilate everyday for the first 8 months (4 for the first two months, than 3 for the next two, 2 for another two months and 1 for the 7th and 8th month) and now i’d say i dilate 2 or 3 times per week when i don’t have any vaginal intercourse and maybe 1 time a week if i have sex.
</p>
<p>
It also seems pretty important to me to bring up the fact that i haven’t been using any lube for sex for the past 3 months ! I don’t really need it because i naturally self lubricate enough when there is a lot of foreplay !  My vaginal canal actually looks exactly like a cisvagina’s mucosa according to my gynecologyst so it lubricates a little and foreplay usually allows me to produce natural lube between my labias. Sometimes if things still are a bit dry, we can always use a little bit of saliva but it’s almost everytime enough (even though of course, the first back-and-forth can be a little uncomfortable, it quickly is a lot more pleasant).
</p>
<p>
Please also note that every vulva and vagina are different and keep in mind that you shouldnt compare yours to others’s !
</p>

Your vagina looks great! Very natural- I wouldn’t even be able to tell that you’re trans if this was shown to me no context. Your surgeon did a great job! How were you able to get bottom surgery so young? Wish I could lol

I actually started transitionning at 14 thanks to my parents who let me after months of seeing psychiatrists and being diagnosed with gender dysphoria by 3 different doctors. At 17 i met my surgeon for the first time whom i was supposed to be operated by in june 2020 but it was actually postponed to november due to covid !

God you’re so lucky. I came out at 11- I’m 15 now and even with super supportive parents I’m not even on hormones yet. Waiting lists suck :///
