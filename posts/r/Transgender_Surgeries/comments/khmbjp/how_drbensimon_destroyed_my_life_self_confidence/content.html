My facial feminization horror story.
</p>
<p>
So I know I’ve posted some info about this in the past but I’ve never posted actual pictures and details of what happened to me. Other than all me reviews are being deleted. And every time I try to share my story somewhere it’s being shut.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bensimon has all those wonderful ratings but I keep hearing bad stories about him.  I could share in the link with pics I am providing texts I received of people complaining about his work but it is not my place. Instead I’ll just share my story hoping that it will prevent some of you from making the mistake I did of going to see him.
</p>
<p>
My transition was going extremely well up to that surgery. This is to highlight how devastating it can be when a surgeon doesn’t take the time to actually do good work and put the effort and time that needs to be put in, in order to give the best result possible. Not only for looks but also for the safety and the life that goes beyond the 1 year after the surgery.  We do have life’s to live after.
</p>
<p>
I wish I could post side to side pictures like so many of you do. My problem is that those side by side are actually distorted to amplify certain aspect of my face pre surgery versus post. This is part of the reason why the board of doctors have found enough elements to launch an investigation against him for my case. You can find part of the letter in the imgur link.
</p>
<p>
I won’t go on about the investigation against him other than there is enough elements that should raised warning to all of you enough to simply never consider going to see him.
</p>
<p>
I now have multiple issues following his 3 hours 7 min FFS on me. Which some cannot be fixed and some that can be fixed will leave marks. On top of  that, features that I would have liked to have,like eyebrows raised that I actually paid for. That I will never be able to get now because he removed to much eyelid skin.
</p>
<p>
The surgery was supposed to be a minimum of 5 hours. After 3 hours 7min he was done.  He push back my hairline. Didn’t raised my eyebrows. Didn’t fix my nose. Put my chin back in the wrong place, did an horrible job on my foreheads so not even sure he did any orbital bone contouring.  I had staples left at the back of my head that my personal doctor had to remove because they had forgotten to remove it. ( small details I know but it shows that they wanted me to get out of the operating room right away).
</p>
<p>
They call the next patient during my surgery so that she hurry to the medical Center so that Bensimon could start right away. ( you know he wanted to finish early). She is the one that told me that mine went super fast because she had to rush to the Center.
</p>
<p>
Stitches were poorly done inside my mouth. And a hole was left. Which obviously turned into an infection. Etc etc etc. It just  keeps going.
</p>
<p>
My eyelids were poorly done and I told him that if he would raised my eyebrows like he was supposed to. I didn’t need another eyelid surgery. He didn’t want too.  Told me everything was fine. Made me feel like I was pretty much crazy. But did offer to redo the eyelid because he thought they needed correction. That was my second mistake I trusted him again. He removed too much skin and now I’m F forever.
</p>
<p>
After that when I told him I wasn’t happy about the whole thing and it was mistake that I went to see him. He told me I had a big head and that he didn’t like to work on big head.  Maybe he should have told me that before destroying my face. He proceeded in telling me because he saw that it hurt me and probably because it  was not professional at all. That some woman have big head and said his wife has a big head. I did not find that comforting at all and it simply confirmed the type of character he is.
</p>
<p>
Turns out, I found recently out that he shouldn’t even had shaved my skull because of the size of the sinus which he had the scan well in advance.
</p>
<p>
Ive commented on some post of girls who had bad experiences. People who haven’t been thru this type of thing cannot experience how it feels.
</p>
<p>
And I know some of you will probably try to make sell pitch about Bensimon in the comments so please refrain.... go destroy the life of girls somewhere else.

:( that is really sad to hear. And it should not even be considered but I do understand how you feel because. No part of me actually wants to or feels like I belong or am male. I have never felt lie I was. But lately doubts about the whole thing have started popping in my head simply because of all the crap I had to endure. The amount of psychological damage you get from being botched is retarded. And people than haven’t been cannot understand the implication in can have on yourself.
</p>
<p>
I really hope you find the money,help and support to be able to fix and live your life as your true self:)

Butt implants and fat transfer went wrong could hardly walk for a year butt implants flipped inside out in my butt 😮 and worse of all he forgot to do fat transfer to hips as requested - as I&#39;m trans was used to experiment on for junior doctors because it didn&#39;t matter my results as I&#39;m not an Insta star in my opinion

I&#39;ve been dilating for a year and still have problems with my vagina wanting to close up. My care provider says this is a natural response of the body to a wound. I had to patiently explain to him that this is my vagina as I am a woman. He&#39;s just says &#39;uh-huh, ok well you need to keep the channel clean and dressed to prevent further infection.
</p>
<p>
Frankly I am getting more and more worried that things will never be right.

Hi,
</p>
<p>
It’s normal for it to try to close that is why you need to dilate once per week. Tho I as I stated before. They perform McDonald’s SRS which results in more issues and less quality results. So I would suspect we do have crappier mechanics simply because it’s rushed.

Technically it is a structure that isn&#39;t built to be there so you always have more maintenance there :&#39;(.

I know you probably don&#39;t want to hear it, but I did end up having good results with him. I was really worried going in because of your posts, but it looks like he might have learned some lessons. You can check

out for more details if you want.

I do wish you would post more clear pictures as I find yours a bit hard to read honestly they are like washed. Not saying it impact the results just saying it’s a weird feel to it that makes it hard to have real  judgement on the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy for you that you are satisfied with your results.

Yeah, problem is he is the president of cosmetic surgeon in Quebec and no one else does facial feminization in Quebec.  He is also part of GRS Montreal which pretty much controls the medical field in Quebec.   They are set up so that no one can actually do actually do anything. But I’m slowly making progress. And will get across.

Trust me if I would tell my old story including hiring expert “expert who give back the money and refuse to do report after meeting me” people would be wtf.

Well, no one is &#34;untouchable&#34;, you just have to have a mountain of overwhelming and well documented evidence. Even then, it won&#39;t be easy, if he&#39;s as insulated as you say. Just depends on how much tenacity you have.

Yeah. I’m just not ready for another surgery and my new surgeon when he explained I needed hardware now to fix the mess Bensimon did. Didn’t sound like an amazing thing  too have.
</p>
<p>
The worst is that when I was trying to get an appointment for my eyes because I’m starting to have lines on my cornea. She couldn’t get me one because one wanted to see me.
</p>
<p>
This is what you sign if you go see that guy.
</p>
<p>
He’s got long arms and he it will be hell to try to try to get help to get something fix because that would mean someone would have to say he did something wrong.

Wow.  A lot of times they mess up only one aspect of surgery (like one other horror story involved giving a lady a double chin), but dang.  Completely messing up 4 aspects is incredible and atrocious.  I hope he loses his license and it is broadcasted to all 50 states/jurisdictions of your country.  Please try to get on Botched with Drs Paul Nassif and Terry Debrow.  Nassif is a miracle worker with noses and has done incredible work on many faces.

It is. I know that google reviews allows for merchant to actually removed themselves bad reviews. Lol that’s kinda fun lol.
<br>
I read that rate Md had some sort of sub where they can pay to remove bad reviews.  And realself well lately I keep hearing about the negative reviews being removed so I guess they also started.

They should really be held accountable and be made to realise that changing someone&#39;s face or body for the worse is a serious crime. The changes are permanent and so utmost care should be taken. If they can&#39;t do that they shouldn&#39;t be operating on people.

Is his Dr Bensimon in Portland Oregon? If so he’s the biggest piece of shit!! He never did the biopsy on the tumor he removed from my right breast. He performed a breast lift with a fat transfer (2fat transfer )My oncologist asked for the pathology report on this. HE NEVER DID THE BIOPSY!! I know have full blown cancer in my entire right breast and have to undergo a bilateral mastectomy in November 🥵 I literally can’t breathe I’m in shock . My Dr turned him into the Oregon medical board.
