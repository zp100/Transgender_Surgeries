I am in the process of getting genital electrolysis in preparation for PI GRS.  Currently I am doing 2 hours per week which is slow and painful.  I am wondering if any one knows of a provider who can do long session electrolysis with pain management (like the one in Chicago) in the Southern California area.  Thanks for your help.

I use 30% lidocaine in an ointment base. Alcohol wipe before applying. Works well be careful at that strength.

How did you get it and how much did it cost?

It’s prescription, and it’s about $75 for 120grams. You have to be very very careful with this. Little goes a long way and you can’t use at this strength for &gt; 12-15 square inches at most.  You don’t want to stop your heart.  Also you need a compounding pharmacy that will make it.

Thank you for this suggestion.  I have Kaiser, so I doubt they will prescribe such ointment but I will check.  And I didn&#39;t know about the heart risk - good to know!

Beverly Hills Hairfree will do 4-8hr sessions with lidocaine injections beforehand. It’s expensive, but she did a great job and it wasn’t painful. I flew out there for 3 sessions last spring/summer and then had a short cleanup session closer to home before my November surgery.

Talk to your doctor and have them send a proscription for the
<a href="https://www.cfspharmacy.pharmacy/blt-compounded" rel="nofollow">BLT pain management ointment</a>
. I put this on my upper lip and it goes completely numb for an hour. I’ve managed up to 4 consecutive hours by applying a few times during the treatment. I’ve been doing two 2-hour session/week. This is the only way to make it doable. I haven’t tried down below but would imaging to is even better give them thinnest of the skin.

Thank you for this suggestion.  I will check with my Doctor to see if I can get a prescription.

That’s not a very strong BLT cream. It’s stronger with more lidocaine.

At 10%, that is 2-1/2 times stronger than OTC Lidocaine. Lidocaine can be very toxic so you need to be careful with it. A 20/10/10 formula is one of the strongest I’ve found. What product is stronger?
</p>
<p>
This was night and day better than OTC lidocaine.

Probably you need to get it compounded, and the more lidocaine the better. The rest is just to make it work faster, and who cares about that. Your one seems to be 20% benzocaine, which is not at all the same as 20% lidocaine (or more). Then add some DMSO and its even better.

The benzocaine hits fast and wears off fast. It fills in for the time that the other two need to take effect. Tetracaine, OTOH, lasts
<em>
longer
</em>
than lidocaine and a little goes a long way. Even 2% has been enough for me, so 10% would be great.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve used 10% lidocaine by itself with good results but it wears off (for me) about 45 minutes into a session. I have to stagger the application and cover it with plastic to get through. With BLT cream I can skip all that.

I&#39;ve used both. 20% benzocaine does nothing for me at all - I can&#39;t even tell if its there. 20%+ lidocaine doesn&#39;t work either, but I can tell its there.
