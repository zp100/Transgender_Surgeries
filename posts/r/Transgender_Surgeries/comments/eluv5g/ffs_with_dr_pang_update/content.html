Hi,
</p>
<p>
Quick update. I’m now one month out of surgery, and very pleased with my results. I feel, and people have told me, that all of the work done fits my face very well. I’ll be even happier when I’m back to 100% and can get back to being more active in a month or so, going from very active to very inactive has unexpectedly been one of the most difficult, if not the most difficult, aspect of the journey so far.
</p>
<p>
If people are considering Dr Pang I’m happy to share photos via DM, however because of recent raids on trans subs collecting media for harassment, I am paranoid about sharing / posting images, and will be screening profiles for past participation in trans subs, and I’m uncomfortable sharing images with throwaway accounts.
</p>

Congrats on the results. May I ask for the cost since I’m also looking for ffs surgery? And some images would be much appreciated if it’s comfortable for you to share.

so happy for you! Everyone under Dr. Ting seems excellent.

I am doing Sinai for GCS and strongly considering them for FFS as well, so please shoot me a DM if you can!

This is so good to hear! I just scheduled a consult with him (Well, on the waitlist for a consult) based on your posts. Wishing you a continued speedy recovery!

Good for you! Glad you are happy, and a wise move on keeping safe. I’ve had dm’s from pretty horrible people on here.

I&#39;m not sure how to judge, but I had a pretty prominent brow I thought which was significantly reduced, much to my approval. I also had a significant bump in my nose that is gone. I was very happy with the fact that I had significant changes, but still looked like me, if that makes sense.
