It’s been 3 months since I had my bottom surgery, so I felt it was about the time to do a write up of the experience, and how things are going so far during recovery. I’ll be segmenting this in a way that makes sense to me, but I’ve got a bit of a meandering style so bear with me. I’ll also be very frank, and probably at times a bit graphic. Since we’re talking about healing from surgery and genitals, be forewarned about squick.
</p>
<p>
I’ve included an album of pictures going backwards from today all the way to the day after my surgery. I might update it again with some new pics in a few days, because my labia are kind of swollen today because I had some pretty rough sex a couple of days ago and I’m still decently sore from it, hahaha!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Overview
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’ve gotten a sigmoid colon graft vaginoplasty by laproscopic technique from Dr Kamol in Bangkok, Thailand. I chose Kamol for a few reasons. I had to pay out of pocket, so Thailand was an obvious choice, and Kamol, being lesser known in the west than Suporn or Chettawut, had reasonable prices, especially for the sigmoid graft technique that I wanted. I originally was aiming for open technique, which would have been 13,000 USD, but ended up getting laparoscopic at 16,000 USD. The usual price of laparoscopic is more like 18,000 USD, but since I was originally scheduled for open, and the doctor determined the open technique was unsuitable, they were willing to negotiate a bit. Kamol is very experienced surgeon, having written and published quite a few papers on trans surgeries, and even his secondary doctor has 10 years of experience. His aesthetics were quite good by every post-op picture I could find, and I couldn’t find any reports of poor post-operative care or really bad complications. He seemed like a safe, competent, and affordable choice.
</p>
<p>
I chose colovaginoplasty for a bunch of reasons, some of which are very specific to me and my needs. I wanted self lubrication, and a reliably durable vaginal canal because I tend to like rough sex. I knew from my talking with other girls that the healing from colovaginoplasty was a bit rougher at the beginning, but less bad after the first few days than penile inversion, and considering I had a limited amount of time in Thailand with the clinic this seemed like a good choice. Any serious complications were likely to happen very early, and be able to be taken care of right away. Also very important to me was the fact that dilation needs for a sigmoid graft neovagina are considerably less severe than with penile inversion, as there isn’t as much of a need to stretch skin as it forms scar tissue. This was a big deal for me as I have severe ADHD and keeping to any kind of a schedule is difficult, bordering on impossible, for me, even with my meds.
</p>
<p>
The possible downsides were things that mostly seemed like problems I would categorize as “things people without vaginas think are big deals”. Having too much lubrication and having to wear a panty liner is not an abnormal thing for people with natal vaginas (my wife calls the week before her period “snail trail week”), and possible issues with smell were, from what I could tell by talking to others, overblown and kind of silly to a lesbian who is well acquainted with how many different ways vaginas can smell. All told, the few downsides seemed manageable, and the positives were huge, so I went with it.
</p>
<p>
I was not disappointed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Getting Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Organizing the trip to Thailand was a huge pain in the ass, and I have a huge amount of respect for any woman who manages to do this whole thing solo. I have a very robust support team, and I still got my ass handed to me on several occasions by how stressful and daunting the whole thing was.
</p>
<p>
International travel isn’t something I’ve done before, so I had to start from square one, getting a passport and moving from there. The entry requirements for Thailand are somewhat convoluted in a normal year, but with covid going on everything was nightmarishly opaque and difficult to sort out. Insurance, covid tests, identity paperwork, proof of income, visas and certificates of entry. On and on and on.
</p>
<p>
At one point I had everything approved and ready to go, and then the Thai government changed the rules for entry and invalidated all medical visas, forcing me to scramble and apply for a tourist visa instead, which caused me to have to spend 2 weeks in hotel quarantine instead of quarantining at the hospital. That pushed my surgery back by three weeks, and extended my stay in Thailand, ballooning the cost of the trip more than I expected.
</p>
<p>
Some of these issues are, of course, probably temporary due to the pandemic, but I think it drives home the fact that things can, and will, go wrong, and having a buffer of extra funds is a necessity. I STILL ended up having to borrow money from people because shit kept going wrong up to the day before the surgery.
</p>
<p>
For all the difficulties, the Kamol hospital staff busted their asses for me trying to make things happen. At first I found them to be a bit brief, and somewhat disengaged with my questions for them at the start. They seemed content to let quite a bit of the operation go unplanned until I was actually in Thailand, which in hindsight makes quite a bit of sense. How much can they really do overseas? But once the Thai government pulled the rug out from under us? They were on top of things on their end as much as they possibly could be, texting me in the middle of the night their time and doing everything they could to help me navigate the paperwork, and arranging the quarantine hotel for me, as well as being incredibly flexible on the scheduling of the surgery itself. At times the Kamol staff can seem just a bit overly laid back, but I have nothing but good things to say about them once shit really needs doing. Just be aware of that if you’re the kind of person who stresses about every little duck being in a row before things start.
</p>
<p>
Once I was actually in the clinic, things proceeded very well. I found the facilities clean, and modern enough in the equipment I would think actually matters the most. The surgical gear all seemed up to date, even if some of the ancillary things like beds or other durable equipment seemed to be a bit older. It honestly felt like they knew where their money needed to go, because if I had the minor complaint that the bed was older and firmer than I’d have liked, they had an abundance of staff and I never had to wait long to get help the way I’ve often had to do in an American hospital. The nursing staff was competent, and not overstretched with too many patients, and they were all lovely and kind in their bedside manner.
</p>
<p>
Dr Kamol himself seems to be a man prone to being brief. He didn’t bother going through much explanation of what he’d be doing, and his pre-op examination of me didn’t take too much time. He expressed concern that because of my weight I wouldn’t be suitable for the open technique, but the way he questioned me makes me think its not that I was too heavy, but that I’d lost enough weight that even at the weight I’m at the amount of skin and fat and whatnot was still thicker in the abdomen than he was comfortable with. He did take pictures and speak with his colorectal surgeon. In the end he did have to insist on laparoscopic over the open technique, offering to do penile inversion if I couldn’t afford the more expensive surgery even after they negotiated the price down a bit, but I don’t think they were merely trying to up sell me.
</p>
<p>
I spoke with an acquaintance who was at the hospital at the same time, for the same surgery, and she told me that Kamol was very receptive to questions, and to her making specific requests about her surgery. It’s likely that Kamol was just responsive to the fact I was quite brief myself. I had done my research, and was content to get out of the way and let him do his job for the most part. I found it comforting to hear that he wasn’t purposefully short and unwilling to talk to people who need more back and forth than I do.
</p>
<p>
It took a few days of being in limbo before they actually told me they were ready to do the surgery. I think mostly because I arrived just before the weekend, and because the change in entry rules had messed up EVERYONE’S surgery dates they were doing their damnedest to move everyone around and get them scheduled without delaying anyone more than a couple of days. The recovery floor I was on was completely full the week of my surgery. The psych evaluation consisted of a single doctor coming in and asking me how long I’d be planning on the surgery, how long I’d been transitioning, and if I was excited or nervous. Very much a rubber stamp for WPATH guidelines.
</p>
<p>
Bowel prep was about as fun as you might expect. Drinking a bunch of laxatives and then getting eleven enemas isn’t an experience I care to repeat. It took so long that they pushed my surgery back until the evening, and I didn’t go in to the OR until almost 10pm. I remember being put onto the table, and the anesthesiologist telling me he was pushing the meds to make me sleep, and then waking up groggily in the recovery ward at about 5:30 am. I wasn’t in any particular pain, and went back to sleep until about 7 when they took me back to my room.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Post-Op Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Recovery for the first three or four days was rough, but honestly not as bad as I expected. I’m not shy about taking pain meds, and the morphine kept things mostly under control until they took me off of it. By that time tylenol was enough to get me through. Honestly my SHOULDERS hurt far more than my vagina or my abdomen. They had me on the operating table with my arms pinned halfway underneath me for six hours and that just fucked my shoulders up way more than I would have expected.
</p>
<p>
I was off food for three days after surgery, up and walking a bit by day 4, able to walk back and forth to the bathroom on my own by day 6, and had the catheter out by day 8. The nurses changed my dressings twice a day, starting on the first day, so I got a good look at things from the very beginning. Bruising was impressive, but I was expecting it because I had the same issue after my orchiectomy. I actually thought that I had internal packing, having heard that they did that for penile inversion, but it turns out that the numbness of the area just made me feel like I was stuffed with cotton.
</p>
<p>
By day 11 I was dilating twice a day. The clinic has you go downstairs to a room specifically for dilation, and the nurses assisted with it up until I left, changing my wound dressings and cleaning me afterwards. Recovery was uneventful, besides Kamol deciding he needed to do a slight revision of my labia minora due to a section of skin not getting adequate blood supply and going bad. This was done on day 19, under local anesthesia, and went good. This means, of course, that my labia are a bit uneven, but it’s very obvious that Kamol purposefully left me with more than enough tissue in the labia minora to get a labiaplasty later on if I want to. I don’t know that I will, but I’m thankful for the conservative approach.
</p>
<p>
I had my non-dissolving stitches taken out on day 22 (which was probably the most uncomfortable part of the entire post-op process), and flew home on the 23rd. The 20 or so hours of plane ride and airports was rough, but survivable for me with an inflatable butt pillow. The pillow the clinic gave me was far too firm, but the cheap blow up ring worked great, especially when stuffed into a pillowcase with a real pillow for extra padding.
</p>
<p>
The next two months of recovery at home have been easy enough. For the first month or so I still got fatigued pretty quickly, so I had to take things easy, but I was able to get back to working decently easily. Granted, as a professional dominatrix I can control how physically demanding my job is without a lot of trouble. Driving long distances was rough for a while, and I avoided it entirely for the first few weeks back. By today at the end of month three I have little to no problem doing all physical activities including exercise.
</p>
<p>
Dilating has gone easily enough. I followed the clinic’s advice of going up in size about every 7-10 days, and despite barely even managing to keep up with a 2 a day schedule, I am now on a dilator size LARGER than the ones they gave me. Dilating was never painful, but the unyielding plastic dilators have the habit of bruising my pelvic floor muscles and making it harder to sit. I ended up purchasing a softer silicone dilator from Intimate Rose that is a size larger than the biggest Kamol one, and can now fit it all the way in. It’s 1.45 inches across, and they have one size larger that I might get that is 1.55 inches across at the base. For someone who has had penile inversion, the hard plastic dilators are far more necessary as they are better at stretching the scar tissue formation of penile skin, so be aware of that.
</p>
<p>
Nerve healing took a while, though I started getting zaps and itching within a few days of surgery, but by today I seem to have close to full sensation in most parts of my vulva. My clit and g-spot are both very sensitive, and achieving orgasm is quite easy when masturbating, but a bit harder with other people because I’m still learning how to do it.
</p>
<p>
The dreaded smell issue was a problem at first, though it was obvious to me that it was a bacterial culture issue since the smell went away entirely when I had a second course of antibiotics for my revision. The process of healing also caused the colon tissue to slough off dead material, leading to me constantly having gross boogers (for lack of a better term), and slightly off-colored discharge. As healing has progressed that has mostly stopped, and eating a bit of yogurt every day to help encourage the right kind of bacteria to grow in my vagina has basically brought the smell in line with what every other vagina I’ve been intimate has smelled like. My partners all agree, as well.
</p>
<p>
The amount of mucous created by my vagina started out very significant, but over time has reduced to a very manageable level. I still wear panty liners to keep from staining my underwear about half the time, but I’m down to using basically the smallest ones and it’s more just to keep things comfortably dry, rather than entirely necessary. Even if this is as minimal as the mucous gets, I’m quite comfortable with it.
</p>
<p>
All told, by today I feel like my post-op healing has gone very well, and I’m probably at about 90% of whatever my new normal is.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Feelings about my new vagina
</strong>
</p>
<p>
My first thoughts when seeing it were actually quite anti-climactic, and I now understand why some girls who pin all their hopes on bottom surgery fixing them feeling crushed by the results. I didn’t get a huge rush of euphoria. I didn’t feel like I was going to burst into tears. The entirety of what I thought when first seeing myself standing up, with a vagina, were “Huh. I look normal.”
</p>
<p>
And that’s pretty profound in it’s lack of profoundness. Before surgery, when I looked in the mirror my body looked strange, alien, and misshapen. It was as if my penis had a gravitational field that warped everything around it. Afterwards I just… look like myself. I FEEL like myself. I had a few physical habits that took breaking around having a dick, IE putting on my underwear with the motion to tuck, but otherwise I feel like I’ve ALWAYS had a vagina. I had very little to no phantom penis sensation, and the worst I got was itching of reconnecting nerves seeming to be a few centimeters away from where the actual sensation was coming from.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I did have a few emotional moments. The first couple of times I had any kind of sexual contact with my wife and girlfriends was pretty overwhelming because it felt so… normal. The experience was completely new, obviously, but it was like my body knew how things were supposed to be. I knew how to move, despite never having done it before. The angle my hips should be at, the motion I needed to make when grinding. Everything was old and new at the same time.
</p>
<p>
The other emotional moment was actually buying underwear for the first time post-op, hahaha! I had so much stress beforehand because I needed to get underwear that would be appropriate for tucking, and the relief of being able to just get anything I wanted was overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
The amount of relief I’ve gotten from dysphoria cannot be understated. I used to have panic attacks if I was too stressed out and felt my dick too much at the same time. I was an anxious, nervous wreck in public, obsessively worried that people would clock me by seeing my dick, or that something bad would happen and I’d be discriminated against by paramedics or cops because they saw my dick while rendering aid. Overblown fears, perhaps, but they plagued me and made existing in public difficult sometimes. Now my dysphoric episodes have happened about once every two weeks, are very very manageable, bordering on just being normal bouts of feeling crap about my face and body because of unfair western beauty standards. I’m almost ridiculously more comfortable and less anxious in public. From the mitigation of dysphoria standpoint the surgery has been a complete success.
</p>
<p>
I’m very happy with the form and function of my vagina itself. Initially I was a bit meh about how it looked, but a lot of that was because it didn’t look like the perfect, pink low-profile porn star pussy that I kind of have a preference for. I had a fair bit of anxiety about it not looking “real”, but my cis partners have been nice enough to let me really examine how they look, and for the most almost every feature I have in my vulva one of them has in theirs. In the end my body type was never going to have a vagina like I would want in an ideal world. My pelvic fat pad is just too thick and even if I was cis I’d probably have a fat pussy like I do now. I can accept and love my slightly asymmetrical, squishy vulva just the same as my cis partners have had to. The scars I have are very, very minor, and mostly placed where they’re basically invisible anyway. I had to show a hook up where they were before she could tell that I had any at all.
</p>
<p>
I’ve described how it feels to have it touched both inside and out, and my cis partners tell me that my description is more or less accurate to how they experience sensation in their vaginas: most of the vaginal canal doesn’t have a strong feeling of touch, mostly the sensation of pressure, except for the g-spot, the ring of muscles of the pelvic floor, and the back of the canal. I think this is an untalked about advantage of sigmoid graft over penile inversion. Penile skin is sensate in a way that’s more capable of feeling touch than colon graft, so I imaging penetration feels quite different with it. Granted this is a question of “authenticity” over ability, which is somewhat meaningless, but I’m comforted knowing that the sensation of my vagina is within cis norms enough at least by how accurately I can describe it to others.
</p>
<p>
As far as sex goes everything is great. I’m still a bit too tight for easy penetration, but I have managed to have regular PIV sex after dilating. Contrary to what basically every doctor and TERF says, I DO get wetter when aroused. I suspect this is because colon tissue secretes more mucous when it’s touched (to help poop slide along), and when aroused my pelvic floor tends to clench and spasm. I get MORE than wet enough during sex, and I don’t find that I need lube for gentle play at least. I get a slight bit of pinching sometimes in my labia if things dry out and they start to stick to whatever I’m playing with instead of sliding. Lube helps, obviously, especially on initial insertion, but I only found it really necessary when having extended, rough penetrative sessions. And, happily, I can get quite rough with things. My vagina holds up great under more aggressive play, with the weak link mostly being my overly tight pelvic floor muscles. I still end up very sore after sex, but even dilating leaves me sore so it’s whatever.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I’m really happy with both the surgeon and the type of surgery I went with. I had only very minor complications, and my vagina is perfectly suited to my needs when it comes to sex. It was quite a bit more expensive than penile inversion (Well, more than a bit, honestly. Almost twice as much.), but considering I’ll be stuck with it for the rest of my life, I’m really grateful I was privileged enough to be able to afford it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TL;DL: Vaginas are fucking great.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me any questions if I didn’t go over something you want to know!

Do you know what part of the colon he make the vagina with , the ascending or that other part(can’t think of the name of it ) ? …. Does he leave some of the penile inversion skin in to attach to the colon and if so by how many inches ? And congrats and I think I will be having to do this surgery solo

I&#39;m decently sure he uses sigmoid, not ascending, but I&#39;m not 100% on that. I&#39;m also decently sure that the entrance to my vaginal canal is lined with scrotal skin. It feels like maybe an inch? Enough that I have good sensation around the opening, but definitely before I reach my pelvic floor muscles.

Kamol has been 1 of my top choices ever since Jessica Alves, a celebrity trans woman had her SRS with him. She&#39;s very happy with her experience &amp; results but hasn&#39;t shared details. Grateful you did. Thank you. 💙💜🤍

damn your labia is one of the mose natural ones i&#39;ve seen. is this because you did sigmoid?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
you&#39;re tempting me to get this over penile inversion now.
</p>
<p>

What do you think the advantages are in general?

I would imagine it&#39;s a factor. Because my skin didn&#39;t need to be used for the canal, there was more for my vulva. I think the major advantages of sigmoid are more skin for vulva, less dilation needed, self lubrication and cleaning, and more natal vagina accuracy in sensation.

I&#39;m unsure if I find the aesthetics enough of a problem to deal with the cost and time needed to get one. I&#39;m not attempting to be stealth and my partners all find my vulva attractive, so it&#39;s of pretty minimal importance to me, at least for now.

Hey. I just wanted to say that your results look fucking great. Its like... I&#39;m in a really weird position to try an navigate. I&#39;m going to be 19 soon, and I came out at like 16. I feel like I should start pursuing GRS
<em>
now
</em>
because of how long its going to take... but idk.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really scared. Like if someone could give me a button to press where I would just have your results or like half the results I&#39;ve seen on this sub I would totally press it. But I&#39;m terrified that I&#39;m going to get a bad result and then be stuck with that forever. My main concern is that my vagina responds to my arousal... so being able to have some erectile tissue left behind to get a &#34;girl boner&#34; would be fantastic.
</p>
<p>
I was also wondering if I could talk to you about some other GRS stuff in PM&#39;s.

For what it&#39;s worth,  even without erectile tissue, my labia get kind of puffy when I&#39;m aroused. I assume because of more blood rushing to the area. I get wetter, too. And sure! I&#39;m happy to answer questions.

What’s your dilation schedule like? Is it intense?

Thank you so much in advance!!

I am supposed to dilate twice a day for 30-45 minutes. I&#39;m fucking terrible at it and usually only manage once a day. Nevertheless I am getting more flexible and having an easier time taking larger penetration. The advantages of not having penile skin to keep from scarring solid is impressive to me.

Yeah I know I’ll be similarly bad at keeping with this; so considering the non penile-inversion techniques

Really curious about the penile inversion scaring: I have been thinking in doing the same method (but on my country, Brazil, not with Kamol since I don&#39;t really want to travel to do it) bc my girl dick is really sensitive and it always hurted/itched pretty easy during sex before (and I never even used it to penetrate someone), but this method seems to have an easier recovery. And yeah, my pelvic floor is tight too, so I will do this one too I guess.

Hi there, my question is rather sensitive as it&#39;s about BMI and weight.i&#39;m planning to have the same surgery done, however i am currently overweight.I&#39;ve been on a weight loss programme from same department as my endocrinologist, but i would need to lose a significant amount of weight (20kg) to be suitable for the surgery (BMI less than 25, not within the obese range).Would you be so kind as to shed some light on this matter, maybe share your BMI or body weight when you went in for the evaluation?
</p>
<p>
I am open to private messaging if these questions are too private.
<br>
Thank you!

Kamol has a similar weight requirement. I was, in fact, too heavy for the open technique which is why I had to switch to the more expensive laproscopic. My BMI was right at about 26 if i remember? Maybe slightly less.
