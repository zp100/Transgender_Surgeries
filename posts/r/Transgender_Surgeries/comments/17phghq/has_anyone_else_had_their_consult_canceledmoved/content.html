I just had his office cancel a consult date for a fourth time. I had my bottom surgery consult date moved back once, but had the consult and have a date set now. A bit after doing my bottom surgery consult with him i decided i also wanted to do top surgery and scheduled with him. Heâ€™s now rescheduled this one twice and now canceled it. Presumably itâ€™s canceled bc they did this at the end of the day and i missed their phone call by a minute and so itâ€™s just canceled. Iâ€™m super upset bc it feels like this is not going to happen in time (i lose insurance in August and my grs date is 6/4, my last option feels like doing them together which sounds hellish). Itâ€™s been weirdly hard to find a surgeon for top surgery who takes BCBS here in chicago. this whole canceling shit has just been so upsetting. has anyone else dealt with this with Schecter or other surgeons? or i guess if you know some good surgeons who take bcbs IL and have a short wait list. sorry for this rant, this just happened and iâ€™m so upset.

NW Medicine is the way to go. Dr. Wang is new and excited about working gender confirming care, I was weeks from consult to surgery with Dr. Wang. His nurse Victoria is a wonderful and helpful person too.
</p>
<p>
Dr. S was not kind on my consult, not rude either, but in no way personable. The front office wanted more from me than just my in hand letters from my care team including phone interviews with my therapist, then told me that once they had them it would take them months just to get it all submitted to BCBS, then another year to get on the schedule. All after waiting most of year to see Dr. S in the first place.

That&#39;s utter b.s. the office staff has handled my case and I have bcbs and walked in with my letters in hand. I know they are really backed up as far as scheduling but they also brought on a few new surgeons now this past month too! He is even trying to get laser and electrolysis in office. I waited a year to get to where I&#39;m at. Maybe more. But it&#39;s well worth getting in. Not sure what your complications were, but i hope you get sorted either way!

Going by previous reviews, I donâ€™t think heâ€™s a very good surgeon.

By no means unique, but (professional language on)
<em>
I don&#39;t like
</em>
(professional language off) Dr.S&#39;s front office.  A friend of mine spent
<em>
years
</em>
trying to get surgery scheduled with Dr.S, and literally nothing ever happened.  She got tired of waiting, consulted and had surgery at NW, and was
<em>
still
</em>
waiting for Dr.S&#39;s office to process insurance and propose a surgery date.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really surprised you can&#39;t find anyone to take BCBS in Chicago; they&#39;re typically the platinum standard when it comes to acceptance.  I suggest you move on from Dr.S...

I am going thru their office now. They are having scheduling issues because of one surgeon leaving the practice and taking on a new surgeon to fill and having to reschedule everyone is super messy. Even my b.a. this month got moved twice. Be patient he is worth it. I have a surgery date set and insurance accepted right away and I use bcbs. Once your in and have your letters with you and turned in etc, your in. They are really having a rough time scheduling is all. Give them a chance. They are really nice people

To note, I&#39;ve been to NW and also uic.. they both take bcbs. There is a place in Peoria and Springfield that does top surgery as well fyi. Take a medical transport down and stay then come home. Just a suggestion if you don&#39;t want to use schecter
