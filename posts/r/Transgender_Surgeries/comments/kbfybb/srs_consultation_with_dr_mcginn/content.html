<p>
I have had two phone call consultations with Dr. McGinn about getting a vaginoplasty.  Like everything I do I dig a little too much into a topic.  My first consultation was in 2019.  The second consultation in 2020 was just some final questions I had before finally deciding to book a surgical date or note.
</p>
<p>
I took notes rapidly as we went.  None of the answers are straight from her and they are all in my own words.  For a few of them, I wasn&#39;t entirely sure what I had written so I tried to go from memory.  I am sure if she read this she would disagree with some of the answers or say that some are not so black and white.  I tried my best.
</p>
<p>
After my painful FFS experience, I took my time before having SRS.  Take time to really learn what is going on, how the surgery works, what are the complications, and more.  I even helped a friend through their surgery and immediate recovery.  Even if I wanted the surgery long ago I was determined to go slower and not make a decision I would regret.  Ultimately this helped me have a much better understanding of what was going to happen and reduce my anxiety around it significantly.
</p>
<p>
At the end of both consultations, the impression I got was of she is someone who knows their field.  On each topic, they could talk extensively to a depth that I could appreciate.  Not just we do X, but the five variations of X and why you don&#39;t to Y or Z even though they at first impression are interchangeable.  That type of stuff.
</p>
<p>
There is a reason that she produces such consistent and good results and that expertise came through in the conversation.  Further is her desire to help trans women through and through.  From HRT, to SRS and even the Gia house and the electrolysis her office provides.
</p>
<p>
In both consultations, we talked about those who have appeared recently just to capitalize and take advantage of trans women.
</p>
<p>
Another way to look at it, she is absolutely not some surgeon who just started doing vaginoplasty last year because they heard they could make $250k a pop from insurance companies.
</p>
<p>
One of the main aspects of the consultations that I learned was just how unique each surgery is.  What we start with very much determines what the end result will look like.  This includes obvious things such as if someone has had a circumcision or not, but includes details such as some individuals have much thicker urethra than others.  While we talk about how you want to have a healthy BMI for surgery in general, the amount of fat or lack of in the region of SRS can be a factor.  Seeing a bunch of before/after photos is not at all the full story.
</p>
<p>
Seeing the photos I sent her she was able to say across the conversations things like: okay well we will need to do this, but not that, and this, but not this other thing, etc.  She said she has like 16 different types and picks the appropriate choices between them depending on the person&#39;s anatomy.
</p>
<p>
Prior to the consultation, I requested a copy of the pre-op, post-op, and dilation paperwork and tried to avoid asking questions that were answered there.
</p>
<p>
Dr. McGinn had been doing vaginoplasty&#39;s since 2007
</p>
<h2>
How many vaginoplasties have you done?
</h2>
<p>
~1500 + lots of other surgeries such as top surgery.
</p>
<h2>
How many vaginoplasties do you do in a year?
</h2>
<p>
~150/year
</p>
<h2>
Complications
</h2>
<p>
The overall impression I got for all complications was that she does different things to avoid them, but there is a certain amount of luck involved.  This honest answer is reflected in what we have seen in the community where even McGinn has had a few surgeries that have not turned out perfect, but in general, in the three years I have been paying attention I am only aware of three major ones, but I have seen many more good outcomes.
</p>
<p>
Overall I am someone who is not overweight, never smoked, doesn&#39;t have diabetes, is under 40, etc so a lot of stuff she isn&#39;t worried about.  Having a consultation she will tell you of any issues that are specific to you.
</p>
<h2>
Major Complications and rates?
</h2>
<p>
Fistula 0.6%
</p>
<p>
Blood clots 0.4%
</p>
<p>
5% blood transfusion
</p>
<h2>
How common is necrosis?
</h2>
<p>
She has never had any necrosis of the clitoris
</p>
<p>
Earlier in her career, she saw more at the bottom of the labia, but as she has a lot more experience she doesn&#39;t see that too much these days.
</p>
<p>
This depends a lot on how the blood vessels in the person grow.
</p>
<h2>
Prolapse?
</h2>
<p>
Nope, never had any
</p>
<h2>
How often is numbness/nerve damage?
</h2>
<p>
The labia is relatively numb for a while because those nerves get cut, eventually, they can connect from the thigh, but because of that, they will feel like the thigh and not penile tissue.
</p>
<h2>
Common complications you see?
</h2>
<p>
As the nerves reconnect electric type shocks
</p>
<p>
Depression around 3 months is very common
</p>
<p>
Granulation from dilation constantly pulling on the wounds.  Treatable with ideally a steroid cream (my note: heard elsewhere hydrocortisone, with silver nitrate as a last resort).
</p>
<h2>
Stopping HRT before surgery?
</h2>
<p>
Used to, no longer required that starting in 2020
</p>
<p>
For progesterone (which I do take) as she isn’t sure how it can interact so ideally stop it 6 weeks before surgery.
</p>
<h2>
What&#39;s the schedule like?
</h2>
<p>
Sunday - Patients arrive
</p>
<p>
Monday - paperwork
</p>
<p>
Tuesday - Often 3 are done on the same day. Each surgery is 2.5-3 hours, not rushed at all, she knows what she is doing.  Is home by 5 etc.
</p>
<p>
Friday - Patient is discharged from the hospital, occasionally on Saturday
</p>
<p>
Patients often stay at Gaia house that McGinn runs which has stuff available and is right nearby.
</p>
<p>
Following Monday - packing removed, dilation is taught
</p>
<p>
At +12 days, the following Thursday final post-op appointment, and then you can go home
</p>
<p>
Worth noting the hospital has started a program to help those who are having trouble dilating.  Dilating is very important and if you are having issues this is one avenue you can pursue to get help
</p>
<h2>
Follow up appointments?
</h2>
<p>
These can be in person, or on the phone and photos can be emailed.
</p>
<p>
At 6 weeks
</p>
<p>
At 6 months
</p>
<h2>
What is your current recommended dilation schedule?  Does it match what is in the dilation manual I was sent?
</h2>
<p>
Initially 3 or 4 times a day.  Never once a day, but at least three.  Each person is different and this is really about keeping depth more than anything a strict protocol.
</p>
<h2>
Does everyone always start on the smallest dilator?
</h2>
<p>
Usually, it is the purple, but sometimes the blue
</p>
<h2>
Which dilator is the graft made around?
</h2>
<p>
The graft is typically made around the blue dilator
</p>
<h2>
Long term care
</h2>
<p>
From years of experience, she likes to add Testosterone to HRT, like to keep it at 60-80
</p>
<p>
Douching as needed
</p>
<h2>
Sutures to the thigh from the bandage?
</h2>
<p>
Sutures to hold in graft and to tell the patient when they are spreading their legs too much which can cause stitches to pop.
</p>
<p>
My note: people like to complain about this, but now I know the purpose!
</p>
<h2>
Any custom tweaks that are requested from other patients?
</h2>
<p>
&#34;I will not do a request where the clit is removed&#34;
</p>
<h2>
Should I find a local gynecologist before surgery?
</h2>
<p>
Nope, they freak out the first year.  But do become friends with your PCP, they can be helpful
</p>
<h2>
Should I get an abdominal and rectal scans for rectum protrusion?
</h2>
<p>
Haha no
</p>
<h2>
Viagra given to help the healing after surgery
</h2>
<p>
Haha no, where are you hearing this stuff?
</p>
<h2>
When do you need the second letter by?
</h2>
<p>
3 months before surgery
</p>
<h2>
Silicon tape for scar healing
</h2>
<p>
Yup, the only thing that works and very good
</p>
<h2>
Morphine for several days or can I try to do Advil Tylenol
</h2>
<p>
Yup, entirely in the patient&#39;s control
</p>
<h2>
Leg compressions
</h2>
<p>
yes at the hospital
</p>
<h2>
Ice for swelling
</h2>
<p>
yes at the hospital
</p>
<h2>
Why No food after surgery?
</h2>
<p>
Until walking only ice chips, then food.  We want the patient to fart given the gas that is in the abdomen.
</p>
<h2>
When stitches pop, why aren’t they re-stitched?
</h2>
<p>
Higher risk of infection
</p>
<h2>
How has your technique changed and advanced over the last 5-10 years?
</h2>
<p>
She talked a lot about how much more she knows about skin, skin tension, and even when she knows when to do something, but it is best to leave something for the 6 month follow-up or risking a complication.
</p>
<p>
This has resulted in very few necroses of the labia for example.
</p>
<p>
Over the years she has moved incisions based on hair trends, ultimately the angle is better if the incision is more medial, but if there is a preference that can be taken into account
</p>
<p>
She now takes a lot more erectile tissue from the urethra bulb after finding needing to remove it frequently at follow up appointments.
</p>
<p>
During the consultation, we talked about various other surgeons (Dr. Meltzer, Dr. Bowers, Dr. Brassard, Dr. Supron) and what she didn’t like about their technique and the complications she has seen from them (given that she does revisions as sees their work)
</p>
<p>
My own impression: Overall she has dramatically improved her craft over the years in 100 small ways that all add up.
</p>
<h2>
What makes a &#34;fat pussy&#34;
</h2>
<p>
She preserves any fat you have, sometimes she has taken from the inner thigh to try to add some in a revision.
</p>
<p>
Trans women who have only ever had very low bmi often don’t yet have any fat in female fat locations which results in a thin look.  This is evidently common in young trans women getting SRS.  This means very little fat where the mons will be.  If you have a very low BMI, gain weight before SRS!
</p>
<p>
She has just started providing a service where she does fat grafting from thigh to mons.  This is very unpredictable though.
</p>
<h2>
Hair removal
</h2>
<p>
If cauterizing is done it is only done on the removed scrotal skin.  The shaft, it&#39;s base, and perineum region which isn&#39;t scraped need to have all hairs removed before surgery.
</p>
<p>
She frequently gets patients on the day of surgery who have been saying they are ready hair wise only to find that they are not finished.
</p>
<p>
Cauterizing further reduces elasticity, for the skin you want to maximize elasticity...
</p>
<p>
We talked about this a fair amount.  A few minor details were added to my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/nre1km/hair_removal_information_for_mtf_srs/">Hair removal information for MTF SRS</a>
post.  But nothing crazy new.  For anyone that has read that post already knows what this conversation was.  She said that she feels laser or electrolysis is fine for black hairs.
</p>
<p>
I had sent her photos so she confirmed the area that I was clearing was correct and she could see where I am after 50 hours.
</p>
<p>
My primary takeaway from this entire conversation was that I would rather have another six months of hair removal for any stragglers that appear even if I could have SRS next week.
</p>
<p>
Hairs that grow inside the vagina are a thing.  And if you have a few, try not to freak out, it happens.  Don&#39;t have your boyfriend go counting hairs.
</p>
<h2>
Are the Inguinal rings closed at the top or bottom?  Could I have them at the top so I could play with them?
</h2>
<p>
They are closed at the bottom.  No, I won&#39;t move that, there is a blood vessel you don&#39;t want to mess with so no playing with them.
</p>
<h2>
Clitoris
</h2>
<p>
The clitoris is made up of the part of the gland at the very top of the nerve bundle.  This is the opposite of the frenulum.  She makes it in a pointy shape where the very end actually dies off leaving the round nub shape we all want.
</p>
<p>
The end results depend on the individual (as with everything), the gland is cut down, but sometimes some of it is buried depending.
</p>
<p>
No, you can&#39;t just ask to save/use the part that feels the best, the nerve bundle and resulting choices don&#39;t work that way.
</p>
<p>
There was a ton more in this discussion, a lot of it comes down to your own personal anatomy.
</p>
<h2>
Could the nerve bundle be folded down rather than up?
</h2>
<p>
It goes up.  Maybe it could, but you don&#39;t want to mess with the nerve bundle because that is how you lose all sensation.
</p>
<h2>
urethra
</h2>
<p>
The mucosa of the urethra used between the clitoris and urethra opening
</p>
<h2>
Is urethra skin self lubricating?
</h2>
<p>
Yes.
</p>
<h2>
Labia minora
</h2>
<p>
Outside - penile skin lining the outside
</p>
<p>
Inside - urethra
</p>
<h2>
Vagina
</h2>
<p>
The top half is the skin from the penis, the bottom half is scrotal skin
</p>
<h2>
Lip fillers in the prostate?
</h2>
<p>
She has done this in the past.  Primarily as a teaching tool to help partners find the prostate.  Because it is a filler it goes away.  Actual results if it provides better sensation to the prostate during sex was mostly she didn&#39;t have enough data.  If I wanted I could do it at my 6 month follow up and it would cost around the cost of the filler itself (aka ~$500).
</p>
<p>
My note: Sounds fun.  For science.  (From the future: not at all needed)
</p>
<h2>
Loss of depth
</h2>
<p>
tl;dr Don&#39;t dilate, don&#39;t have sex, lose depth
</p>
<h2>
What is your expert opinion on using the tunica vaginalis peritoneum at the end of the vagina
</h2>
<p>
My note: Given that when you have SRS you will either throw away scrotal skin or the tunica vaginalis peritoneum this was my primary question for the entire consultation.
</p>
<p>
She had a long answer which I could sum up as: there is no long term data on this and the surgeon doing it is just trying things on trans women including this.
</p>
<p>
There was a lot more and I was listening more than taking notes.  My personal takeaway from the conversation was that I should wait until there is more actual data, maybe a published paper with more detail on this, but if I want SRS now I should go stick with what works as this is unknown and a gamble.
</p>
<h1>
tl;dr
</h1>
<p>
Dr. McGinn is someone who knows her craft and produces consistently good results not from luck, but from hands on experience and knowledge.  You need to do enough hair removal pre-op.  You need to dilate post-op.  Your results will depend a lot on your own anatomy and there are very few choices that you can request.

Thanks!  My own
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/jlio53/dr_mcginn_consult_writeup_and_why_im_planning_on/">consult</a>
focused more on the logistics, and I didn&#39;t ask nearly the in-depth questions on the surgery itself.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious as to the low BMI discussion.  Any idea of what is &#34;too low&#34;?  I&#39;m on the low end but not super low, and her staff told me that losing more weight before surgery would not help the results.  From your write-up it almost seems like the opposite is true.

<p>
On the low BMI is was really about teenagers that transition have practically no body fat and the little that they do have wasn&#39;t gained while on HRT so they don&#39;t have the female fat patterns on the thigh/groin area.  For them gaining 10/20 pounds while on HRT to get female fat patterns would be beneficial to their result.
</p>
<p>
If you are at a healthy weight, stay there.  If you go underweight you lose weight from everywhere including fat from those areas.
</p>
<p>
Because of time (I had a lot of questions) I tried to avoid the logistics type questions.  Most of them are answered in the pre-op/post-op paperwork and seem pretty similar from one surgeon to the next.  Or more I want to make the choice based on results over logistics.

McGinn will be doing my SRS. I&#39;m a young adult but my BMI is less than 20 (but still &#34;normal weight&#34;). I&#39;m guessing I should probably try to put on a few pounds :( I literally have never been able to put weight on my entire life ugh

Thanks for the clarification.  I actually gained about 10 pounds in the first year of HRT, and have been pleasantly surprised by getting some hip padding.  It doesn&#39;t seem like I can lose those pounds anyway, guess I&#39;ll stop trying.
</p>
<p>
I asked about medical stuff as well, just not hardly to your level of detail.  Drs. McGinn and Wittenberg actually had decently different logistics, so I did find those questions useful.  I&#39;m kinda glad that, with your focus on the medical details, that Dr. McGinn is apparently still on your shortlist, makes me feel better about choosing her and PI.

How did you deal with the anxiety?  I had a panic attack in her office recently when I tried to get lidocaine injections for genital electrolysis.  Her staff contacted my therapist (who I had already talked to about the panic attack), and I&#39;m going to be starting antidepressants and an as-needed antianxiety med.  Not happy about all this, though I do definitely have issues with getting through medical procedures, and I do share their goal of making sure I manage my anxiety through GCS.

Understood.  Since the panic attack I&#39;ve been having suicidal thoughts, though they&#39;re not directly related to dysphoria.  It still really sucks and my therapist was obviously extremely concerned when I shared that.
</p>
<p>
For electrolysis, after the panic attack, my therapist recommended
<a href="https://www.powerbreathe.com/2020/03/22/breathing-for-focus-using-the-4-4-8-breathing-technique/" rel="nofollow">4-4-8 breathing</a>
, and it made a world of difference.  We also use topical lidocaine.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad you were calm on the day of surgery!  My mom will be with me, and I&#39;ll take an antianxiety med, so hopefully those help.  After they get the IV in there shouldn&#39;t be any more needles while I&#39;m awake, so I *should* be ok.  I&#39;m also fine with being less- or no-clothed in medical settings, so I won&#39;t have dysphoria issues.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so sorry about your experiences, but glad that you got through GCS!  6 months to go here, mine is also in June.  I just made my reservation at Gaia House, so this is starting to get more real.  Fingers crossed!

I’ve a friend who took the offered “sleeping pill” the night before her surgery and she was still not entirely with it when they took her into surgery the next morning. Ask for something like that.

I don&#39;t know, I really find the peritoneal claim of no long term research kinda a cope out.  It&#39;s been done for decades for women with MKRH.  How would AMAB have any different effect on adding that tissue than AFAB?

The conversation was specifically about using the tunica vaginalis peritoneum, not peritoneal from the inside lining.  There is probably a difference between the two, but I am not entirely sure what that is.  We had a separate short discussion about peritoneal from the inside lining which wasn&#39;t something I am interested in and also not something she recommended (thus it was short).
