I had bottom surgrey December 17th so I&#39;m almost a month out. I wanted to post this while everything is still fresh on my mind. Dr Salim is an awesome guy and he super chill. I just feel like because I have a photo graphic memory and remember and over think a lot Im a hard person to communicate with but I&#39;ve notice other post are always leaving out details that might or might not help someone. Like for instance i didnt know i was doing a scrotal graft until a week out from surgrey which kind of upset me because I should have felt like we should have talk about that at my pre op appointment (reoccurring theme) I have had a pretty good recovery even though your basically depressed the ENTIRE time from lack of normal stimuli. The few days leading up to it were a nightmare. Clear liquid diet and bowel prep was gross and I was dizzy and weak. When I went in for surgrey I was terrified. I had never had a surgrey before so I was scared. I stayed i  a hotel near SF the night before so I would get there on time. I arrived at the hospital on Geary and checked in and headed to the 4th floor. I met with a nurse who was the nicest sweet woman ever. I swear to God she was making me laugh and was so excited for me and we talked and I think her name was rose. She had me strip down into a gown and get into this warm bed that way so cozy. It was like a heated blanket thingy and she ran an IV in my hand and all the sudden my pinky got tingly and I ask her about it al i almost passed out when she started to respond. My pulse literally dropped in half. She immediately called someone over and tilted the bed upside down so the blood would rush to my head I was so scared. Another anesthesiologist came over and asked how I was doing and I told her everything just started going black. She said I should be fine and I started to feel better in 30 or so minutes. (Fear and no food can cause this I have never fainted before) Next thing I remember Dr. Salim came over and we were talking and laughing about how I shouldnt faint because I might scare my anesthesiologist. He said he didnt care if I fainted but my anesthesiologist would 🤣. So I calmed down they fed me some gabapentin and started to roll me in. Before that I kissed my family members and waved hi to Dr salim waiting outside of the OR. I feel like we were both excited.  IT WAS SO BRIGHT it was honestly the scariest room I had ever seen. They had moved me to a diffrent bed on this donut cushion thing under my head and I looked up and saw the medical tools and I almost fainted again out of fear. I laid down really fast to just try to calm down and I started talking to the anesthesiologist because he asked me where I worked and what that was like and told me that I might feel a pinch in my IV and we kept talking and I dont remmeber where our conversation left off. I woke up with the biggest pain in my calf from being in stirrups I suppose. But I was high and tired and I just wanted to sleep but everyone kept talking and my mom wanted to a photo of me so my husband sent her one to make sure I was ok. The next day was bed rest amd clear liquids still. Nothing eventful. I was craving anything solid. That entire week was so annoying. I was hooked up to an pain IV machine full of duladid with a button to dispense it every 10 mins if I desired. That lasted 3 days then I was switched to pills. I finally start up and started to walk around and was eating solid food by the 3rd/fourth day. THE VAGINAL PACKING WAS SO ANNOYING UGH. YOU CANT CLOSE YOUR LEGS AT ALLLLLLL. Sitting was not happening and going to the bathroom you felt like you were going to pop a stich. I had one really rude nurse I cant remember her name but she wouldnt help me go to the restroom on the first day. She told me to just &#34;go like you normally would.&#34; And that I should be happy and thankful because I had the &#34;dream surgrey&#34;. It was kind of fucked up. I was pretty upset. My husband was gone so I was by myself. I ended up trying to go &#34;like normal&#34; and it was hard getting up and down and I kept feeling like I was going to pop a stich because you vagina has the packing sewed into your body. After that I had a lot of nurses that were sweet and helpful and FYI dont eat the food at the hospital. It has a crazy laxitive effect. I was a vegitarian and I swear I went 80 times when I had normal bowel movements and no constipation AT all from the pain medication. Speed to day 5 Dr. Salim came in and looked at everything and he said everything looked really good. Personally I had no Idea what he was talking about because it looked like a swollen barbie vagina 🤣. So he asked me how I was doing and told me I could shower if I wanted to but I told him I would just wait til the packing out to be safe. Next day A nurse jeff came in to help me take all my packing out and it was hilarious. I didnt know I would be so sensitive so soon. As he was removing the packing I swear he might as well have been engaging my G spot. Like I making all kinds of noises and we were laughing and it was embarrassing. Dr salim came in 5 minutes later and showed me how to dialate. He said I should put firm pressure on it to make sure I&#39;m at full depth I was scared of breaking something. But it was chill.   Also we were giggling because as he touched things my nerves were just firing left and right. It was like a terrible porn 🤣 He said he was more aiming for depth then width on my dialator. He also said I should maybe gain a couple of inches in depth by dialating. (Personally I have never heard of that ever so I&#39;m definatly going to need a revision regardless because I have specific needs and im dialating to a point where I feel my dialator hit my pelivic bone. So I&#39;m going to need a pertinonal deepening hopefully soon. I think they only do this as revisions so I wouldn&#39;t make it a priority at first. ) I was discharged and sent home. I just had a recent follow up and they they took the stiches out of most of my vulva and other places. I was told I wasnt allowed to have sex for 6 months or even talk about a revision until then (which is silly when other surgeons its 3 months at this point I&#39;m not really sure so if in three months I&#39;m hoping he will reason with me because I want to finish transitioning this year so I can take my life back) Its honestly just sore and annoying at this point. I just want to feel normal again and today is the first day I&#39;m off of narcotics. I So far my experience is a mixed bag. Idk I feel like they know what there doing but dont give you ALL of your options up front. Like if I would have know he could of done a pertinonal pull through? I would had him do a triple graft and just save me the functional revion that I&#39;m now going to need. Also he showed me aesthetically what its supposed to look like but I still feel like he used way to much skin on my labias. I have my fingers crossed on the aesthetics on that one. AMA!

Are you able to sit down without it being super tender? I’ve heard that can be one of the most annoying parts of recovery.  I’m hoping to have everything cleared out within the next few months..as I’m trying to get the electrolysis done with already.. What’s weird is kaiser was trying to get me to do laser (which I did three rounds of on my downstairs) but I requested electrolysis instead  to make sure it was permanent.Well since I can relate to those kidney stones; that makes me fairly happy that it isn’t as painful as that. Those are very painful! When you went through the process were you able to pick which surgeon you had? As I guess a few other surgeons at kaiser do it as well. How has your appetite been since having surgery?

So sitting down is still super tender but you will figure it out. They did the same thing with me with laser. I was like I&#39;m a blonde german girl THERES no way lasers will work on my pigment less hair 🤣. And yes I was able to pick the surgeon I wanted I chose him because I know a few girls who are super happy with there results. Personally I&#39;m paranoid and have post op depression which is kind of wreaking havoc on my brain. So I&#39;m not sure how I like my results yet only because my swelling is being an ass hat and personally I don&#39;t like my depth. I have 5 inches of depth and I wanted more so at my follow up he talked deepening procedures so I&#39;m going to do that. Like no matter what. I just think its archaic to think that the &#34;male standard&#34; of what the average penis is , is what what the use to give girls a standard depth. Or at least that&#39;s what it feels like. We are not average girls and that should be respected as such. My appetite Is not so great to be honest I&#39;m hungry then I&#39;m not. My emotions have a lot to do with it because I&#39;m constantly just trying to finish transitioning. Besides that I&#39;m so sore some days I just dont even want to get out of bed and the swelling just wont chill out. Like if the majority of the swelling would go down I&#39;m sure I would feel like 98% better with all of this but it&#39;s rough. Some girls dont swell at all which good. But unfortunately I do.

First off congrats! I’ll be going through my surgery with them in about five months. Are they now offering the Peritoneal pull through method? As I was only told about the standard penile inversion technique, or shallow / no depth version. How was the pain overall? When do you feel like you’ll be able to go back to work without many issues? Also when you had the hair removal portion done before SRS... Did they do an inch around the shaft, and all of the scrotum? Oh and yeah when I had FFS one of the nurses kept referring to me with male pronouns, and one of them was super rude. It was a mess which was the San Leandro facility.

Hey! Thank you so much love!  I think it purely revision based to be honest because of how tricky it can be. Like he said I could achieve more depth? But I just don&#39;t see how personally so I will be seeking a &#34;marrying&#34; revision soon hopefully. I&#39;m not gonna lie the pain is tolerable. Like it&#39;s a DEEP soreness. Like I&#39;ve had kidney stones and they hurt worse then this. This is kind of like a slow burn kind of pain that doesn&#39;t stop. So I&#39;m a month out and the pain has died down a lot but IM STILL having a hard time walking around and functioning and now it just feels tender vs painful. My energy levels are trash and I&#39;m still trying.  I&#39;m supposed to go back to work near valentine&#39;s day (kind of ironic.) Also yes I did 8 months of electrolosys which Silky touch electrolosys because she knows how to clean house and is fucking awesome. She&#39;s in san ramon... they also made me remove an inch around the entire base. Yeah I&#39;ve had a few issues with nurses but that one woman I was just stoned enough to deck &gt;.&gt;

(Update) So at this point I’m actually super disappointed. These people are probably the most gatekeeping experiences I’ve had with my care. I have requested that my revision be addressed several times and that I want it to all be done at once and they ignore my request. I was called in to San Francisco for another consult to address all of my concerns and I explained to Dr. thomas what I wanted done and explained that I wanted it all done at once and I REALLY needed dr salim there so instead one the nurses took photos and sent them to him. Dr salim called me 20 mins later and told me “I’m sorry if they lead you to believe that we could do the deepening at the same time but we need the robotic surgeon for that.” And I said “That’s fine but then what was the point of dragging me down here just to basically get me excited about my revision if your only doing half of it. I want it all done at once and we talked about this” I need a urethra shorting a deepening and a labiaplasty. So when I’m aroused I have the excess swollen tissue around my urethra that’s actually painful. It makes intercourse almost impossible. I have SO much excess labia skin and it’s ugly. It’s like why didn’t you just make this cute from the get go. And I have 6 inches of depth. Which is not really much considering the men I’m with sorry not sorry.  I’ve now had my “robotic surgeon” consult rescheduled once. I’m just tired of it. Kaiser really doesn’t care about its patients and has proven that to me time and time again. In my FFS consult they refused to do certain things to address my dysphoria and have been super fate keeping on that. At this point I say sign up with blue cross go with Heidi whittenburg and Moziac care for FFS. Both are super cool and organic also super modern both DO not gate keep at all. I’ve seen the results from both and spoken with people that have had them and there pretty satisfied and have had issues addressed in under a year. I would NOT go with kaiser if your looking to get things addressed in a timely manner. There there to literally fill a paycheck and it’s sad.
