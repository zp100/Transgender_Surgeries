In my country&#39;s trans groups we have Kamols “representatives” who are jumping on every girl who asks about surgeries. They are offering “to  help”.  We have one very popular trans instablogger who did srs in this hospital, obviously, it was paid integration or something. But now many know this place and “Roomy went there” is used as reassurance
</p>
<p>
I hope more people will see the results of Kamol. It&#39;s a shame so many girls don&#39;t research him before booking srs

Many don’t know English well enough. Some just know how to research, who to trust. Or don’t care. For many “she did it there” is enough. Or “they all the same at the end”, etc

It is hard to find information about their work, when I was doing my research I have hardly found any information. There is a lot of negative feedback in recent months, but prior that nothing tbh. I am surprised that no one died there yet, it is just by pure luck. They have drained me 1.8L of blood and left me alone in a room post op. No monitoring, no one at the bed. This probably shows best what it is and how it goes. In my opinion it is just a SCAM and you get scammed by those guys. They sell you a diamond and deliver shiny glass stone. Darcie Silver is probably the most horrible out of all of them because she is actively luring people based on lies and fantasies. BS I was told by her is just unimaginable, in the western countries it is treated by a law and is defined under criminal code. It is as well called deception and there are paragraphs for those who intentionally harm people. In TH she is free to go, no one will do a thing to her as long as she keeps bringing more idiots to the hospital who pay to be disfigured and risk their lives. Mind my words, one day someone will die there. It is just a matter of time, they do absolutely nothing to prevent it and they just run on pure luck at this stage.

Sure, they perhaps were the best, now it is a circus show with bad jobs, I hardly believe Kamol is still doing anything, I think he did just rest in his fat chair and letting subbies doing the job for him, if they do bad job, so be it. I have seen horror pictures, cannot share as I do not have a permit for it, but if you imagine penis pulled down between the legs and sliced in half then it is his new model of vagina. They as well seem to do shallow canal lately with massive problems in dilation, and the last thing is oversize lower labia needing second revision. In short it hangs like a bag on each side the bottom. I&#39;ve seen report of cut nerves in different places as well, one person could not eat for weeks because they have cut nerves to a tongue and jaws, so not functional jaws and could not talk nor chew. Total careless work with no accountability at all. Had people saying they had damaged urinary system and could not pee too. So yeah, if you brave enough to risk it, go for it. In the end what does not kill you makes you stronger. Kamol will definitely  test your limits when you get no morphine, you are left alone in a room with no way to call nurses, are being told that everything is normal when it is not and they just wait until you go away so the problem is gone. NEXT ONE PLEASE... It is starting reassembling horror stories from late Australian crack down on dodgy plastic practitioners. I had cut nerves, have hair in the canal, have abdominal pain need constant antibiotics to keep functioning. It is just a joke pulled out by monkeys in the circus full of clowns. Just a warning, keep away from Darcie Silver, she is intentionally confusing and manipulating information under empathy umbrella with intentional agenda behind. It looks like paying upfront before you arrive is not a good idea as there are reports of no refunds, so they just don&#39;t refund and blame TH laws for it. So if you are to pay, send $500 and transfer rest of it once you there, not in advance.

Seriously I just hear so much bad things about Kamol hospital. Is there no positive at all? no happy results anymore?
<br>
I am about to do my surgery there in 6 months and honestly scared to death because of the lack of positive from others.
<br>
Thinking about just going with Dr Bank instead but in suporn hospital they make it so much harder to get started with getting help and setting a date... feel so alone in this

I put out things as they are, I am sorry that there are no fantastic news here. It is your body, make sure you trust the doctor.  I don&#39;t trust Kamol and their team at all now. Their goal is not your good but their pocket, they will sacrifice you for money so I am not sure if this is a good thing. All I can say is that there is no way on this planet I am going back to those butchers again.

Hey, by the way there are happy people, but they are probably not going to be happy when hair grows inside of them. The problem in it is that it takes months and they probably don&#39;t know that it is happening until they get sick. So it is something to think about. If hair grows inside then I am scared to think what else is done there. I am to find out in time I guess...

If you want a better chance at depth I&#39;d consider sigmoid not ppv. Kamol is known for issues with depth and making the entry to the canal too narrow which will result in a very difficult and long process over many many months to just get it to widen to the size of a small cock. Personally I&#39;d look elsewhere because of these issues.
