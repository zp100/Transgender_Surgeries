I think they are just the lead on the case and maybe do one of the procedures each and then the specialists of each other area of the surgery do those areas if that makes sense.
</p>
<p>
At least that is the impression I get.
</p>
<p>
I have heard I will be tested like 4 times, which is quite fine I&#39;m vaccinated now so I should be safe. And I&#39;m glad they take everyone&#39;s health seriously.
</p>
<p>
How was the recovery like?

I have also been fighting with the insurance company for more than a year about cover FFS for my daughter and now trying to find an attorney to rep her on contingency. We made the same decision and I will be taking her to Facial Team in June-also flying Boston-Dublin Malaga.
</p>
<p>
When we get back I plan to file a claim with her insurance and continue fighting. I believe we have a good case because there are numerous legal precedents that have found denying FFS as cosmetic is discrimination and our state (Maine) already has anti-discrimination laws that include gender identity. If you are interested in any progress we might make with insurance, DM me and I will start as list and keep you posted.

That&#39;s one hell of a coincidence, and I&#39;m sorry to hear you&#39;re going through the fight as well. I&#39;m sure it means the world to her that you are fighting for her like that. I know what it would have meant to me to have parents on my team.

It&#39;s definitely getting more expensive. I do understand them charging more for covid resulted reasons, hopefully it can come down or at least remain constant for a while after this.
