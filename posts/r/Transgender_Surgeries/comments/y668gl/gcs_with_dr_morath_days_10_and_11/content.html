Hi there! After the few rather repetitive days, we are back in action. A lot has happened and a lot has improved during the weekend.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 10
</em>
Today the day was up to a great start. A nurse woke me up at around 7 in the morning to take out my urine catheter. It felt really weird as it finally went out and there was a bit of blood involved due to a nearby sticht, but I’m now free of catheter! I could shower immediately after it (now without having to be that careful with the catheter and the bag), it was lovely and I could finally clean myself (I had postponed my shower the day before so I could do it without the catheter, meaning that I was starting to feel uncomfortable).
</p>
<p>
After the shower, I visited the doctor and get everything examined. All is going really quick and I’ll be starting dilations tomorrow in the morning, instead of on Monday. If dilations go well during Sunday, I’ll be discharged on Tuesday, so exactly two weeks after being admitted therapy before the surgery.
</p>
<p>
Now however comes the scary part: for the first time in almost two weeks: I’m feeling like I need to pee. If I don’t, the catheter goes back in, so I go sit in the toilet and start relaxing my muscles down there. It takes some 15 minutes of experimenting but at some point the urine starts going out. Success! The rest of the day I continue to visit the toilet every hour or two as, as they tell me, my bladder is now not used to being full (the catheter kept it empty) and I feel the urge to go to the bathroom earlier, but things will get back to normal in the next few days. What is true is that now peeing is a bit of a hassle as I need to clean myself (before removing the catheter the nurses took care of this) with water after every time and then do a change of bandages (now there are four: two in between the spaces between labia minora and labia majora, one in the entrance to the vagina, and another in the space between the labia minorca, where the clitoris is, and all the way down) and clean every bit with some antiseptic. It’s time consuming but I also feel quite euphoric every time I have to work in the area. I have also received contradictory instructions as to how to do this so I’ll ask the doctors tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Also, I have a lot more energy now that the catheter is out. I move a lot more and could even stand for nearly an hour while chatting with my room neighbours (they’re truly two lovely women!) and receive the visit of a friend in the afternoon, with whom I have the chance to go visit the patient garden twice (felt extra nice, as it was my first time outside since I was admitted). I could also sit for dinner with a donut cushion and even though it isn’t the most comfortable for now, it’s nice not to have to lay down for my meals.
</p>
<p>
Not much to report from downstairs. Swelling is going better and I don’t have any pain (although I’m still given some ibuprofen-like painkillers with my meals), only the feeling of my nerves reconnecting and sometimes a bit of diffuse pressure in the area.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 11
</em>
We’re in for another big day! Today, I start dilating, at first in the morning with the doctor and then on my own another two times, in the afternoon and in the night. I was actually quite nervous but I had a good feeling as I didn’t feel any pain during my daily examinations. I went in shortly after breakfast with my set of dilators and the doctor talked me through the process. We tried together and it all went smoothly. It’s quite a weird sensation I still need to get used to, and I feel a lot of pressure as the dilator goes in, but at least I feel no pain and can manage somewhat easily. My legs were also left sort of wobbly after it and after the other two times I had to do it during the rest of the day. The placeholder I need to leave in between dilation sessions was also a bit uncomfortable at first but then I got used to it and I don’t feel it there any longer.  And in any case, doctor considered my dilations today a success and confirmed I’ll be discharged from the hospital on Tuesday, and so I booked my flight home alongside my girlfriend, who is coming tomorrow to pick me up.
</p>
<p>
Curiously enough, dilating also makes me feel pretty euphoric and I found myself looking forward to the next ones (although I bet I’ll get tired quick, as I’ll have to do this three times a day during the next half a year). Also, and even sensations are still developing, for the first time while dilating and cleaning I could sort of feel how this could be pleasurable down the line (certainly not now though!).
</p>
<p>
I also had quite a bit of energy today. I could again sit for my meals (except breakfast, I was still too tired to get out of bed) and to write on my GCS diary, as well as go to the garden twice and on a couple of walks around the ward.
</p>
<p>
Painkillers were reduced to one a day with dinner without me noticing much difference. Still no pain and everything looking well, save for a small part of my right labia minora that started looking a bit brown(ish). I’ll ask tomorrow in my final checkup. All alright otherwise and looking forward to being back home!
