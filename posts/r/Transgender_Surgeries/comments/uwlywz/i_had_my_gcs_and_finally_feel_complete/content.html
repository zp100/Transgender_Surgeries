I want to preface this post by saying that I won&#39;t be including pics of my results...yet. I&#39;m eventually going to do a post with those results I&#39;m just not brave enough to do it yet.
</p>
<p>
But I wanted to let you all know that my surgery is done and I&#39;m so, so happy. My surgeon was Dr. Jonathan Witten in Louisville, KY and I must say I&#39;m stunned by how good my results look. I had to lay in bed for nearly a week before I could see the results but it was worth it...my new vulva looks awesome!!! For the first time in my life I feel like a complete human being with a whole body. I&#39;m beyond happy!!!
</p>
<p>
The hardest part about the whole operating process was laying in bed for 5 days. It&#39;s one of Dr. Witten&#39;s requirements though so I was prepared for it. Even though I knew it was coming I wasn&#39;t completely prepared though. I say that because I have severe degenerative disc disease and I didn&#39;t take into account just how bad laying in one spot was going to hurt me.
</p>
<p>
Laying in one spot or position for very long gets SUPER painful!!! I guess laying on the operating room table for 7 hours really messed me up too, because when I woke up I was in more pain than I can describe. It was pure torture and there wasn&#39;t anything the nurses could do to bring me any relief.
</p>
<p>
Even getting treated with morphine didn&#39;t take the pain away. It would only help for about an hour before it would burn itself out of my system.
</p>
<p>
But between me, the doctors and the nurses we got it figured out...kinda. Here&#39;s what we did. The nurses started packing ice packs right around my lower back. They packed them in there tightly and I could even roll from my side to my back a little bit and the pressure of having one of those packs get squished by my body weight felt kinda good.
</p>
<p>
Then one of the doctors prescribed me a prescription strength Lidocaine patch that I could wear for 12 hours at a time. I could have it on for 12 hours, but then I had to take it off for the next 12 hours. That thing really helped during those 12 hours.
</p>
<p>
The on-call doctor then prescribed something the nurse said was super strength Motrin (sorry I forget it&#39;s name). That really helped a lot. More than I can say actually. I didn&#39;t really think it would help, but the nurse gave me the shot and about an 45 minutes later I was relatively pain free. But it only lasted for about 3 hours.
</p>
<p>
The third thing I did was have my brother bring me a Tens unit that I could put on my back and continuously shock my back. That thing helped more than anything else....it even helped more than the morphine.
</p>
<p>
So if you&#39;re preparing for surgery I&#39;d definitely consider buying a Tens unit. I got mine on Amazon and I think I paid $35 or $40 for it. It kept me from going crazy from the pain.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll make another post later about the rest of my experience. I just wanted to let people know that I&#39;m done with my surgery and simply cannot be any happier than I am right now. I&#39;m finally complete!!!

I&#39;m so happy to hear that you had such an amazing experience with Dr. Witten!  One of my girlfriends had her bottom surgery with him last June, and her results have been nothing short of extraordinary!  She looks great, everything functions beautifully, and she is even self lubricating (somehow!) which none of us expected!  Like you the hardest part of her recovery was the period of bed rest following the surgery. Thank you for sharing your story! My own surgery is in less than two months, and the Tens unit advice is solid gold!

Multitudette is correct. I had PIV. I can&#39;t begin to tell you just how happy I am. I mean this was my lifelong dream come true. But actually living my new life is making me beyond happy!!!

I am under the care of pain management and I asked the doctors if my pain management doctor could come in and give me a pain block. They said no though because they needed me to be able to feel what was going on down there at a certain point.
</p>
<p>
So I had to depend on the Tens unit keeping me sane.

I had pain management in hospital as well.  Preoperatively they placed an L4-5 epidural and used ropivicaine . It was dosed so I was numb just in pelvis and butt.  I could feel my legs and move them.  I was in an airbed which adjusted to prevent pressure sores.  I was on my back totally for 2 days, then epidural removed and I could walk with therapy or the nurses.  Most of the time I was still on my back.  I was given tylenol for pain, colace for bowels, celebrex twice daily for pain and inflammation.  I could get oxycodone 5 to 10mg every 4 hrs if needed.  I was very comfortable.  Bridget

Oh my gosh that sounds so much better than what I faced, I was on my back for 5 days total and wasn&#39;t allowed to get up once. It was torture. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over now though.
