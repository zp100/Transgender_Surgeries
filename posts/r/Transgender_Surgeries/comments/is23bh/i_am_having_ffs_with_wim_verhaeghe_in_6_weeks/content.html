So as the titles says, i am having surgery with Wim Verhaeghe from Belgium. He looked like a great guy in person and i trust him and i have seen him in a documentary before. He also did a youtubers face Jessie Maya but besides that i can not find a lot of info.
</p>
<p>
Anyone here with some experience?

Very well! Almost no pain, which was surprising. Eating was irritating for a couple of weeks but that&#39;s normal... But more importantly let me tell you about the result. I am extremely happy with how I look. I feel like he erased the features that came with puberty. I haven&#39;t been misgendered since then. What I love about Wim&#39;s work is that it is very natural, some people that knew me from before even have a hard time telling what exactly changed because it is so subtle.
<br>
This result is because Wim&#39;s practice is ethically sound, his intentions are in the interest of his patient unlike others: I want to take this opportunity to warn everybody not to go to 2pass clinic ever. Please spread the word X

There’s some other surgeons in the wiki and you might find some other sites to research him.

It would be great if you could make a post about it afterwards to help others in the future.
</p>
<p>
Usually when you can&#39;t find anything about surgeons its because they don&#39;t have much experience. However there&#39;s not that much published about European surgeons anyway, so who knows. If it matters to you then you could ask him how many full FFS procedures he&#39;s done

Diana Gabriels is a clinic who is the person between a surgeon and the customer. Without a “middle man” it is impossible to do such procedures in the Netherlands cause you can not just ask a surgeon to do it.
</p>
<p>
Se it as a private clinic. I also did my breast augmentation with them.

I had some work done at 2 pass but I don&#39;t want to go back there. I&#39;ve contacted wim for a quote but he refers me to the hospital to make a pre op appointment. Due to covid and the 3 hour drive I was wondering if any of you could tell me the price range of his type 3 forehead reconstruction surgery. Thank you so much in advance!
