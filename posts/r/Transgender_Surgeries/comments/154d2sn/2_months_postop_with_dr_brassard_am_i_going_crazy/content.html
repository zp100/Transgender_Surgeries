From my 10 second look over its entirely possible shes just small. When in doubt, ask your doctor! Just keep in mind some women have small clits -- you may just be one of them. Assighned smal clitoris by surgical healing, or something

Might just be buried. Do you have sensation?

Haven&#39;t really been touching in there too much... With any girl I&#39;ve been with before, the clit is usually showing more..

I think I see it, too, but ask your doctor to point it out to you. I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it being small. Mine is pretty small and I have better sensation than I did pre-op. My doctor told me to leave it alone until 10 weeks and then it took a few months after that for the nerves to totally remap and have my first orgasm.

Edited to fix a typo!

I also had surgery with Brassard and also got a small clit.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m able to masturbate normally. Cumming feels like a wave going through all of my body. I feel less sensible when people eat me out though.

I had the same issue and messaged my surgeon, he replied with ‚Äúsometimes skin heals over the clit and it‚Äôs no big deal, it can be uncovered with surgery.‚Äù

You also have some granulation tissue. Your doctor will need to remove it. Mine tried silver nitrate but I ended up having it burned off.

With my own partner, her clit is barely, barely visible. I can feel it but not see it a lot of the time. Sometimes it‚Äôs just small, but it‚Äôs always good to ask a doctor :)

I think there&#39;s a clitoris but it&#39;s very small therefore you&#39;ll probably end up with less sensation than pre-op.

Now what I see is some granulation happening a little that is that deep pink tissue forming on the edge. It&#39;s an overgrowth of your tissue while healing. As for the your question yeah you got one. Looks good

It‚Äôll be there more hidden  , they do keep the basics for sensation but  unfortunately in Canada they only do PI inversion Montreal and Vancouver , they have minimal experience really except Brassard doing PI and basically use the rest Penile skin for the canal - Canada is outdated not offering Jejunum or Sigmoid to give better distinction of structures having the Penile skin used outside to give maximum aesthetics that is expected post op Trans gals want and don‚Äôt get post op in Canada - the Government doesn‚Äôt like paying for out of country surgery in this area of surgery if they only offered but it‚Äôs only PI unlike in the states - they want the money kept in Canada for Canadian surgeons only - Brassard is very experienced in PI and nothing else really - all you get is PI or PI here  in Canada - Sigmoid is a serious surgery that I got by Theerapong last Nov. 2022 an 11 hour fix job but worth it and be truly functional finally - PI is almost a joke now in this day and age , it‚Äôs done because it‚Äôs the simplest to learn , no other reason , the dilation is forever until you die and shrinks no matter what despite dilation - 8 months post op I dilate every 3 rd day , no shrinkage and have 7 plus inches using the Orange Soul Source dilator now - Canada is dated really with skills doing this creating a functional and proper looking vulva post op and why I went to Thailand , I‚Äôm biased I suppose but the Vancouver gender clinic is a joke hear and I‚Äôve let them know my views trying to be paid back for not wanting to sign the out of Country surgery I needed they don‚Äôt offer because of a lack of skills and ability through the BC human rights !
