I post under a throwaway because I have had harrassment on my main account. I have had GCS 4 years ago because I thought it would make me happy. I just don’t like the looks of the vagina and I came to realise that having a vagina is not for me. I watch porn and I’m envious of the guy’s penis every single time. I wish I had taken my time to explore myself more. A social transition would probably have been more than enough for me. I love being a woman and I always will but I feel so stupid for having wanted GCS asap. I didn’t follow WPATH. I went to rubber stamp therapists. I was advised by everyone to not do that but I thought I had everything figured out and now I have to live with consequences. I had GCS at 9 months HRT and Chettawut helped me to get two letters from rubber stamp shrinks. I haven’t dilated in years and it didn’t close up which I had hoped for. I should have followed the regular path. I didn’t have money for lots of counseling. I am not blaming anyone, it’s my own fault. I just wish I could turn back time and prepare myself a lot better. The results are fantastic and I have excellent depth. It’s just that I didn’t think about what a vagina would look like on my body. I don’t have money for a phalloplasty but I was thinking about a meta? Can I get that without coming off estrogen?

Meta&#39;s work by taking the &#34;legs&#34; of the clitoris that was enlarged by testosterone and releasing them, creating a longer look. If you don&#39;t have &#34;legs&#34; to your clitoris, then they can&#39;t release anything.
</p>
<p>
If you had GCS, and don&#39;t have testicles anymore, coming off of estrogen will leave you with no protective factors that either testosterone or estrogen would provide. I wouldn&#39;t do it without conferring with your endocrinologist.
</p>
<p>
You are really talking a lot more about a restorative surgery. That might take you outside the bounds of a traditional meta or phalloplasty. You current anatomy might require something else entirely, and if you truly want that, you are going to have to shop for a surgeon, I think. There are very few surgeons that perform this surgery, and any sort of reversal might be even less.

I&#39;m sorry to hear that. Do you think going through lots of counselling would have made much difference? I&#39;ve never been able to figure some things out no matter how much counselling I&#39;ve done. Hrt for one. I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d work out if srs is right for me without just doing it.

Miroslav Djordjevic In Serbia appears to be the main guy for reversal surgery. I wish you the best.

There&#39;s some pretty harsh pictures there. I think the Vaginoplasty they show is actually on a natal woman with a  congenital absence  of her vagina canal. That&#39;s why the aesthetics are so perfect. His MTF Sigmoid colon example at the bottom doesn&#39;t have that level of detail in the result.

I don’t know if counseling would have made much of a difference. I didn’t have a lot of experience with vaginas and I didn’t know what it would look like on my body. I am not a regretter in the common sense. I don’t advocate against GCS. It wasn’t right for me but I’m just one person. I think everyone should carefully explore what is right for them. I still love life and love being a woman. It was my responsibility and no one else. I don’t want a restorative phalloplasty. It’s too taxing on the body and even more nerve damage could happen. I want a less invasive surgery. I know I can never get back what I once had.

Thanks for your honesty! You are taking all the responsibilities on yourself, which I think is very brave, and could only be done by someone with love in her heart. Hugs!  I agree with you on that the more invasive surgery one has, the more damage it could cause to the body.  Would you like to talk more about why you don&#39;t think it looks right on your body?

Based on what your saying, I&#39;m not surprised at this out come and I&#39;m sure people there are plenty of other who are young and making these decisions and get around the WPATH standards just the same. Even at that people can still resent their surgery for a variety of other reason. Bad outcomes, recovery disasters, numbness, loss of arousal and some people don&#39;t understand how much they really change your sexual nature.
</p>
<p>
Seriously, I empathize with your regret.  After what my surgeon put me through, I told her right to her face that I didn&#39;t have any regret having GRS, but I regretted the decision to have her do it. It was an 11-month nightmare that I&#39;m still living with. I wouldn&#39;t recommend her to anyone.
</p>
<p>
The point is, there&#39;s no going back here to the beginning to start from scratch. We have to deal with what we have. If you&#39;re not getting what you want from your sex life and vagina, maybe there are other issues that a sexologist might help you work thru. It&#39;s an entirely different beast this vagina, but as long as it working as advertised, you should hold back on the resentment a bit and focus on getting it better connected to your brain. It&#39;s not that easy but it may be worth doing. More surgery is never going to get you what you had, but new problems.

You don&#39;t need to say it, and its not helping. She literally starts off with
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I post under a throwaway because I have had harrassment on my main account.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
and says
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I should have followed the regular path.

It’s not a lie that situations mentioned in this post make it so much harder for everyone else to transition.
</p>
<p>
It’s tough enough as it is - cases like this will be brought up in medical societies and used to make us all jump through hoops to make sure we are sane enough to know what we want.
</p>
<p>
As a person who knows exactly what they want/need in life, I find it degrading that the medical world has to cater to the lowest common denominator

I&#39;m not saying its a lie or not true. Its a common opinion and she&#39;s probably thinking the same thing. Most people would.
</p>
<p>
I
<em>
am
</em>
saying its not a kind, nice, or supportive thing to say. That would be fine it it helped more than it hurt, but it doesn&#39;t. She&#39;s already given a very strong warning to follow the traditional path. She&#39;s here for some info on surgery and she didn&#39;t have to admit to what she&#39;d done. I&#39;d guess she either said as a warning to help others in the future, or is in need of some emotional support - she said she can&#39;t post under her main account because of harassment, and this is the very top post with lots of up votes. It probably doesn&#39;t feel too good.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been others posting on reddit who regret their surgery and I&#39;ve seen the same response. There&#39;s probably more who are afraid to. Personally I think people should be more supportive, but its not up to me.
</p>
<p>
I hope she leaves this post here as I&#39;m going to link to it to help people considering surgery. Hiding this stuff away is not helping those who might make similar mistakes in the future.

You don’t need to judge me once more. I have been punished by my own mistakes more than enough. It was my responsibility and the consequences are all on me. I don’t blame anyone else than myself.  Gatekeeping doesn’t work. It’s up to the individual. You can’t know what a vagina does with you if you have never had one. It’s a gamble you take. Explore enough and do what makes you happiest in the long run and for Pete’s sake, stop being so judgy. You are behaving like a TERF.

Yes, I considered that but I didn’t want an empty ball sack with a penis. I wanted a vagina. I just couldn’t know what it would look like on my body. It didn’t work out for me but that doesn’t mean anything. Most people who get GCS are happy. I’m an exception.

In the paper
<a href="/u/HiddenStill">u/HiddenStill
</a>
referred to, it says &#34;Several factors have been associated with dissatisfaction and regret, such as age older than 30 years at first surgery, personality disorders, social instability, secondary transsexualism, heterosexual sexual orientation, dissatisfaction with surgical results, and poor support from the partner or family.&#34; Do you think you can identify with one or more of the factors?

This really isn’t passing the sniff test for me. Like, I know trans positive therapists who made it really clear that they would help but they have to do their job and who went through the whole rigamarole. ‘Rubber stamp’ therapists don’t really exist even in super accepting Portland. And then doctors aren’t even allowed to operate on you until you’re a year into HRT / social transition right? How did op even do this?
</p>
<p>
Pls offer some links or something to your therapists so we know you’re legit.

I needed an asap letter because one of my letters was too old. I managed to find a therapist and get a new letter in three days in a very conservative part of the South

That’s not the same as rubber stamping tho. Letters don’t need to have the whole 6 month waiting period.

<blockquote>
<p>
I had GCS at 9 months HRT
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough, if I&#39;d been able to have it up until the 9 month mark, I probably would&#39;ve jumped at the chance. I&#39;m quite relieved that wasn&#39;t an option for me, not necessarily because I would&#39;ve definitely regretted it, but because I would still have doubts that I would never be able to be comfortable with. And I&#39;ve had a ton of (great) sexual experiences, but those weren&#39;t enough to prevent me from obsessing about having the surgery. I think a lot of this has to do with how much the idea of being a woman is associated with having a vagina. We want to be seen as valid women, but it&#39;s hard to shut out the voices that point to the space between our legs. The times are a-changin&#39;, but not fast enough.
</p>
<p>
I still may very likely get it, but it doesn&#39;t feel as essential to my transition as everything else, and I do mean
<em>
everything
</em>
.

Totally agree with the first post. This is why trans ppl should go though the long wait. So that this doesn&#39;t happen.  So that ppl really want this surgery dont wait longer because some ppl just want for the sake of it

Well that&#39;s how it is. You really want it. Dont conplain afterwards, as someone else WHO REALLY WANTED IT could of had a shorter wait. And to get it redone should be paid out of own pocket. Sorry should if really thought about it

Cause some trans ppl transitioned longer and waited longer to know what they want. Others did it all in no time and might be unhappy, or suicidal or want thier penis gone to then have it back... So yea SOME TRANS PPL. I cant say all can i, as we all went through different processes and experiences. I think no one should fly through the system! Same for me, im glad now 10 years later im having the surgery, even though i knew i wanted it back then. But did i really want it that bad back then? Who knows.... So yea i think it needs to be strict this process. For everyone!!! Some of us are suicidal...depressed etc during transition..... Who knows how she feels now after her wrong decision? Im not picking on her....im saying it needs to be strict cause of cases like her, as shes hardly the only one. And i doubt very much that how ever they going to fix it for her...it will never be like before and i doubt she will ever be happy again. And thats how it is...no need to sugar coat shit. We are adults and should be able to deal with the truth

Nice contradictory stream of consciousness babbling you got going there.  Sorry, but admitting that everyone has their own experiences but then in the next breath insisting that everyone needs to be held to the same barriers to care is bullshit.  Folks don&#39;t need to go through a one-year &#34;cooling down&#34; period if they want breast reduction surgery or bariatric surgery--both of which involve drastic changes to the body and permanent removal of large amounts of tissue.  Yes, folks should speak with trained and competent medical care professionals.  Yes, this is a big decision.  But how about not robbing people of their legitimacy?  As you said, we are adults.  How about letting people make their own decisions and cope with the consequences, be they positive or negative?
</p>
<p>
In other words, stop infantilizing people and go shove your gatekeeping someplace rude, K?
