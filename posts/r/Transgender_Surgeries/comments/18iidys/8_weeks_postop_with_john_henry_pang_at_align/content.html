Congratulations for achieving your transition goal. She looks amazing. Question time (if you&#39;re up for it).
</p>
<p>
Why did you pick this particular surgeon? How was recovery after surgery?  Is there anything before/after reassignment that you wish you had done differently?

Thanks so much!
</p>
<p>
I picked Pang by using this sub. I feel like I looked at thousands of results and I liked his the best on average.
</p>
<p>
I honestly don‚Äôt think I would have done anything differently. But if you have something specific you‚Äôre curious about go for it.

He&#39;s my FFS and Body Contouring Surgeon. Very pleased with his work. I&#39;m getting booty implants and my last FFS revision next year with him.
</p>
<p>
I am torn between him and min jun for my vaginoplasty

That‚Äôs a hard choice! I, like everyone, love Jun‚Äôs work but I like Pang slightly better, the wait was shorter, and he‚Äôs in network for me.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm sticking with Align for FFS and going with Mittermiller. I think Align is really stacking themselves with young fantastic talent and I had a good experience with GRS. But when I want to do breast augmentation I‚Äôll probably come back to Pang. He really does good body work. Good luck sis!

I have FFS with Mittermiller in four weeks and his bedside manner is incredible. So excited for your results and would love for you to continue to post updates if you‚Äôre willing so we can see how the üêà heals. Congrats!!

Yes he‚Äôs seems so chill! And yes I‚Äôm definitely planning future updates. This sub has given me so much; it‚Äôs honestly the internet at its best. I love that I can give back and will definitely be posting an update probably at month 3. Thanks sis!

I‚Äôm so happy to hear this, I‚Äôve had my surgery scheduled for a while but I don‚Äôt see a lot of talk about Pang and it makes me nervous. I keep delaying my surgeries for various reasons, new job waiting for FMLA, now my mom says if I delay another year she‚Äôll help financially and be there for recovery.  I have FFS, BA, and Vaginoplasty scheduled with Pang and I‚Äôm always going to be nervous, but I‚Äôm happy to hear good things.

How does it feel down there now? This has always been been my dream and it looks like your doctor did a really good job. I am a bit envious of you.

Sensation now is generally good. Like I said my clit works, though sometimes it takes me a while to orgasm. Things are still healing so it‚Äôs not always comfortable. I‚Äôm still regaining sensation in the lower part of my vulva and nerves are still a little fritzy, plus some intermittent swelling . But it‚Äôs still early in recovery.
</p>
<p>
Fingers crossed for you sis!

Do you live in CA?  Based on your photo I just signed up for emails from Align (you look great!), but I live in DC.  The lymphatic massages and hyperbaric chambers sound awesome, but I don&#39;t want to be stuck in LA or SF waiting for them.

No, I live in Chicago. I stayed in SF for 2 weeks. Pang actually recommends against hyperbaric O2 for GRS because the therapeutic benefit is maxed in the first week, and you can‚Äôt do O2 with the wound vac and catheter. They‚Äôd rather you rest at home from week 2 on.
</p>
<p>
And thank you!

Pang does hybrid PI with scrotal graft and tunica vaginalis graft. I had originally wanted PPT but decided that because of his aesthetics and the option for PPT if I needed it for revision that PI was ok, especially with the TV graft.

Thanks.  I have a date with Marcio Littleon in Rio in July, but and doing a consult with Pang as well.  That is a great result.  Aesthetics and sensitivity retention are the biggest things for me.

As someone who went to Pang and is seeking revision with Dr Littleton, I would recommend you go to Littleton.

Haha yeah maybe. With my kinkster friends I‚Äôm definitely the Wolverine of the group.
</p>
<p>
But truthfully for anyone reading this comment, Pang‚Äôs team never stops stressing to take it super easy and the fact that (it feels like) I‚Äôve barely left a couch in two months I think is a massive component. Our role as the patient really can‚Äôt be over stressed.
</p>
<p>
You‚Äôre so kind üñ§ and yes, I‚Äôm thrilled.

Thank you again for your post! Three questions for you:
</p>
<p>
1) you said you stayed in SF for two weeks. What was traveling back to Chicago like? Would you have stayed longer in hind sight?
</p>
<p>
2) Did you have to get electrolysis given that he did PI TV? If so, how long did that take?
</p>
<p>
3) If you had a remote admin job and could work from your couch would you be comfortable working at this point in your recovery?

For sure!
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Maybe. The canal bleed at week 4ish was the scariest thing ever. I was in the hospital here for 3 days and had to have blood transfusions. That said, I think it was on me and I‚Äôm not sure staying a whole month would have been necessary. I had mapped out in my head the surgeon locally here I would get myself to if anything happened, though making that happen is no guarantee. I think this is a question of personal risk tolerance and truthfully I‚Äôm not a risk averse person. It came down to the cost of staying in SF and the limitations of my caretaker. I think conservatively if you can stay a month do it, but if not less time is doable.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Flying back was a little challenging. Two things I did was requesting mobility assistance from the airport which I would say is essential. I also got a first class ticket so I could recline more, and that was also I think necessary. It wasn‚Äôt a picnic getting back and without these things it would have been much harder or impossible.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Pang doesn‚Äôt require hair removal and feels confident in his skills here. I had 3, 4 hour electrolysis sessions about 2 months apart starting in May just to put my mind more at ease and decrease the chances of Pang missing any, thinking that 4 total attempts at full hair removal is better than 1. My electrologist could cover everything in a four hour session and said my results were some of the best she had with so few sessions. In the end it probably wasn‚Äôt necessary.  Pang with still write a letter of necessity to give to insurance.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I‚Äôm a remote worker and just went back this week. It‚Äôs not my favorite to work from my couch but it‚Äôs totally doable at this point.

Thanks so much for the detailed response it‚Äôs so helpful. Last question, what was the timeline like from when you contacted the office to when you got a consult? And then how long from consult to surgery?

You‚Äôre so welcome! Here‚Äôs the timeline:
</p>
<p>
03/24/2023: contacted align  04/13: consult scheduled  05/19: consult 07/03: letters of support reviewed and scheduling preference provided 8/1: surgery scheduled  10/16: surgery
</p>
<p>
I was really happy to have gotten through the process so quickly. I have no idea what Pang‚Äôs wait time is like now but if he‚Äôs continued to gain popularity I can imagine it being longer.
</p>
<p>
The one thing I‚Äôd suggest that could have sped the process up was having my letters ready to go by the consult so you‚Äôre ready to submit them as soon as they‚Äôre requested. I probably could have saved 6 weeks give or take if I had those in hand.

Hi OP and congratulations!
</p>
<p>
No real questions, I‚Äôm nervous about picking my surgeon. I like the aesthetics from both. More recently one exceptional one with Min Jun. I looked for recent results from Pang but the updated website has about 10 photos and Reddit doesn‚Äôt have many posts with pictures.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm currently scheduled with Min Jun in June and Pang in July as I try and decide which surgeon. I‚Äôm going to keep that till February to see if any insurance or other changes impact my choice.
</p>
<p>
I consulted with Min Jun a week ago, so no longer with the Crane Center, and he seemed typical. I read of more care and support problems regarding Min Jun and the Crane Center staff. I read of more positive experiences with Pang and Align. Hospital or SC experiences vary by location.
</p>
<p>
I feel more confident in the after care with Pang. Min Jun is a big question mark now that he‚Äôs on his own.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve had a bilateral orchi so no TV for use by Pang although there is other tissue I know he can use. I forgot PPT is a saving option for revision if needed.
</p>
<p>
I also live in IL, but I have a good friend about an hour from SFO that I can stay with. I plan to spend the first two weeks nearby with another friend as caretaker.

That‚Äôs such a blessing to have a choice of both, congrats! Jun was my second choice. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be happy with either.
</p>
<p>
If you care at all about an opinion I would just choose the surgeon you think will give the best best results you want. They‚Äôre surgeons so you‚Äôre direct interaction with them will be limited, and dealing with crappy staff of personalities is way easier than shit results. But it‚Äôs also true how you‚Äôre treated can be confidence building. I felt Pang and his staff were friendly and professional, but they not going to go out of their way either. They run a tight ship and give it to you like it is.
