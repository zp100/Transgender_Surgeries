Told I was an &#39;&#39;overweight 67 year old trans woman who expected to be transformed into a 26 Columbian Pole Dancer&#39;&#39; in one procedure!
</p>
<p>
I had requested fat transfer from waist and flanks to create hips in my conversations with Dr._Aslani.
<br>
at Cirumed Clinic when I originally had a consultation face to face with him in Marbella. This is evidenced in my correspondence with my patient coordinator.
</p>
<p>
He mentioned that I would be a difficult case as a trans women (although  drdowbakmiami and  dr_delvecchio said I was an ideal candidate) and I do appreciate that with my body shape there would be limitations to what he could achieve. Also, at no time in our conversations did he mention a 2 stage procedure where he would concentrate on butt implants first and then a second procedure to create hips – my understanding is that this would be achieved in one procedure as with the majority of his patients.
</p>
<p>
As a trans woman and all trans women would understand, I told him my requirement was to create hips because my lower body is very masculine and he recommended butt implants – it’s only after a few email exchanges with the patient coordinator that I realised he did not mean hip implants but butt implants. I queried this with the patient coordinator because my aim was to create a curvy figure around my hips but was told this would help achieve my goal.
</p>
<p>
In my patient records the Dr states he marked me up and explained in great detail what the procedure entailed and what he would achieve – in fact the Dr forgets that in my case I am almost blind without the aid of glasses, totally naked in a room full of strangers, covered in cold antiseptic cream and frightened about the whole situation and about to be sedated and he unfortunately made no attempt to describe what would be achieved under those circumstances.
</p>
<p>
The surgery went ahead eventually and upon waking up I was in excruciating pain and could hardly move and I was incontinent partly due to the procedure but also the drugs.
</p>
<p>
I cannot fault the staff who looked after but at no time was I asked if I was happy with my results by anyone. They only seemed interested in obtaining pictures that could be used on Instagram.
</p>
<p>
Post-op Dr Aslani’s examination was perfunctory with no question of was I happy with the results. In fact, he seemed to almost lose his temper when I could not move properly to lie on the examination table due to the extreme pain and discomfort I was in. I noticed with several other patient reviews that Dr Aslani took the time and trouble to take pictures of the end results and discuss them with his delighted patients but this did not happen in my case.
</p>
<p>
My patient records show that I had fat grafting from my waist and flanks, and this was transferred to my hips and butt – in fact the records show that 2400cc was extracted and into each hip 1200cc was grafted in. It reality it seems that no fat was transferred to my hips because the photographs show different results and 2 independent medical professionals have stated this.

Wow. I don’t know why he just didn’t do fat augmentation in the first place.  I’m sorry you went through all of this mess.

Agreed - there&#39;s a lot more I could say about this but really only as part of a personal conversation for several reasons !!

He seems terrible - he creates such an unnatural looking results. He did a surgery on a trans influencer recently and they look like uneven sand bags :(
