Hi all,
</p>
<p>
I have had 2 consultations with a renowned maxillofacial surgeon here in London and after explaining everything to him I was referred for a CBCT scan. I saw him again today to go through the report and as you can read from the report Bart Van de Ven exposed both my inferior dental (ID) nerves on both jaws. The report states that this is due to contouring that was done in a manner and extent that it thinned out and exposed my nerves. My local surgeon said that this should not have happened and according to him is negligence.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, the screws he placed under my chin is an unorthodox method in the field of maxillofacial surgery particularly genioplasty as he couldn&#39;t understand why Bart Van de Ven placed the screws the way he did. My local surgeon said that Bart Van de Ven must have completely peeled my entire lower face which he shouldn&#39;t have done and only to an extent.
</p>
<p>
Third, because the screws he placed have sliced through my 3rd molar teeth on both jaws as stated in the report, it is possible my teeth are dead. He has referred me for a dental check-up to see if this is the case and if so I will need root canal treatment.
</p>
<p>
Fourth, any dental treatment such as braces cannot be carried out as again the screws are in the way and therefore, I&#39;m likely to encounter problems. My local surgeon suggested that based on the findings and medical facts, what Bart Van de Ven did to me is malpractice and that I should indeed seek legal action if I haven&#39;t yet.
</p>
<p>
Other than the errors in the jaw and chin surgery. Bart Van de Ven also damaged my skin and submental region by performing liposuction which he decided to perform himself and was carried out wrong as he suctioned way too close to the skin causing bleeding and giving me hemosiderin stains and scar tissues.
</p>
<p>
He also placed a piece of bone on my chin and put more screws which he did not tell me about.
</p>
<p>
All in all Bart Van de Ven has given me only problems  with his lack of experience, poor judgement, unnecessarily aggressive hands and experimental surgical methods.
</p>
<p>
I hope that this would serve as a warning to many transwomen out there that Bart Van de Ven does not have our best interest and he is experimenting on us. He may have happy patients but most of these patients all have nerve damage and are too ignorant to question if the surgery done to them was even done right. If despite the various negative experieces of many transwomen wronged by  Bart Van de Ven you feel that the risk is worth it, you&#39;re of course, free to take the risk. However, had I been a membet of reddit and Facebook and saw all the horrible things he had done I would have ran away.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for reading!

Jesus this is brutal. Reading this and looking at the cbct scans is like a horrible comedy of errors. Over aggressive contouring. Shitty hardware placement. Chin bone grafting (which has some literature on it resulting in failure ).
</p>
<p>
I do hope you pursue legal action if you&#39;re able, as this seems to be one in a line of poorly done surgeries he has performed.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so sorry that he did this to you.

Yes he also for whatever reason performs otoplasty which again is a plastic surgeon&#39;s job. Where he learned to do it, is most likely by practicing on his patients. Jamie Rose Dee and Jessica Alves had their ears done with him. He suggests them during consults not on his website.

To be honest, I&#39;m not sure even the surgeon I consulted with repeatedly questioned Bart&#39;s experience and credentials.

Lol.  You still hear those stories of frauds like that guy who loaded a man up with women’s breast implants rather than male pecs.  The guy woke up mid-procedure to see his surgeon using a SPATULA as a surgical instrument.   The more i see of Dr. Bart’s work, it makes you wonder....  i hope that you can sue him.

Thank you. I also hope that he gets punished by God or get a really bad karma for all the lives he ruined. He knows he is doing serious shit and yet many transwomen still recommend and praise him like a saint. He is laughing at us.

CT tech here, and I read thru all of the technical medical lingo. All I can say is holy fucking hell.
</p>
<p>
I am going with keojampa in a little over a month. I asked him to be aggressive with my chin and he said do what he could. He said he could only do so much because of this exact reason. Its why I went with him. He is mindful of nerve damage and wants what best for his patients not just what will look the best.
</p>
<p>
I wish I can see the rest of the images. comparing before and after.

I have no before CT only panoramic X rays and lateral post op X rays. I knew from the panoramic 3 weeks post op that somethings were off. But my dentist and even the surgeon I saw in the beginning were saying you cannot see nerves on X rays etc.. but there were there! And I was right all along!

Well you cant see the nerves.  But you can see the mental foramen. Which is that gaping hole or whats left of the canal. I can only imagine the numbness you feel.  Can you even move your lips on that side? Can you feel anything?

My lower lip moves crooked. I can&#39;t feel much. Right side of lip and chin are completely dead. Left side of lip and chin have muted and altered sensation. In the CBCT and in my X ray it shows he cut half of the branches of my mental nerves on the left side. It was pure luck my left side didn&#39;t end up exposed but as the report said he cut and shaved it very thin. The questions again is why? What was he trying to achieve? What was going in his head? My lower face also looks weird when I smile or talk. It looks over shortened and seems like it is coming forward a bit too much when I talk. It&#39;s bad and complex that I&#39;m better off getting a new set of jaw and chin if it was possible. I&#39;ve lost all definition to my face. He also removed my jaw angles that were not really too prominent to begin with.

Question, are you a NP or PA? or did you just pick up the lingo of whats going on with your case. I try to not use medical words and keep it simple for others who may be versed in medicine. Just curious.
</p>
<p>
ALso This sucks, I am sorry and I hope you find peace in what happened to you. I also hope you are compensated for your loss. I was looking for your before and after I saw that you quite the history in this account. It seems its still quite fresh. I do want you keep telling your tell. But I hope you come to terms with this trauma as well. Have you seen anyone for the emotional damage this has brought you?

I use the medical lingo cause I feel it is easier for people to connect the terms with the report. Also it is quite hard to distinguish the nerves if I just call all of them nerves. I did not find it hard to understand the report but I used to do medical interpreting at hospitals so I got exposure to medical words. I don&#39;t know everything obviously. It is very hard to deal with emotionally and very scary. My parents don&#39;t understand and the reports will only confuse them. My sister supports me somewhat but she is too young. I never did imagine going to Bart for surgery would mean my downfall. I feel like a very different person. Changed for the worse or a lesser version of my former self. Damaged, less atttactive, less confident, less happy and much less positive outlook in life. However, I feel what makes it the worse is that the damages Bart caused me are not only irreparable but also permanent which could have all been easily avoided had Bart done it properly with care and with avoiding harm in mind as any truly qualified surgeon would and should. I cannot say whether if I can recover mentally and emotionally as my mood changes all the time. It&#39;s like a dark cloud on top of  my head. I do have thoughts or random desires of experiencing death as I now fear living like this for the rest of my life.

As I said its still fresh trauma. I really hope you are seeing someone. YOU NEED to have help. I highly suggest you are going to someone at least 2 times a month. If not more. You need some one to help you get the right coping tools.
</p>
<p>
Also post surgery depression is real. Anesthesia does do a number on you. Its something I worry about with me or anyone even with the best results.
</p>
<p>
I have lost at least to friends with what we suspected as post surgery depression.
</p>
<p>
So I am asking you please see someone.

Yes what&#39;s really unfortunate is no preop CT to map location of inf alveolar canal thru mental foramen and location of the roots. D-B does preop CT I believe, not sure about Keojampa. I will get one regardless just to be safe. Would love it if they all used Stealth to keep problems to a minimum like they do for others eg Sinus surgery as everything is mucosa covered. Good luck with Keo, he&#39;s terrific from what I hear.

Keo does a CT. As Radiology is my field of study. He does one pre op. To help plan and guide. I mean how do you know where stuff is exactly if you dont have a map? One the reasons I went with him over Harrison lee. BTW Lee is still doing my bewbs, next thursday in fact. I am super scared as its my frist time under the knife. however I been in the OR as a rad tech 100s if times.  So its stupid I am sooo stressed about it. Maybe I have a fear of being cut, and maybe because I have to give up all controll.

I think he already has one from one of his American victims. It is the reason he banned Americans from his ptractice. We&#39;ll see if he will ban Europeans next.

At this point, it seems like everyone that has witnessed malpractice by him should band together and file a class action lawsuit or something.

That sounds terrible, thank you for sharing this information. It certainly seems like well documented negligence by Dr. Van de ven.
</p>
<p>
I’ve come across so many complaints about this doctor, hopefully he will be subject to close scrutiny soon.

He advised against any cosmetic work as it may just cause me more problems. If anything I can have the screws removed but due to the placement of them it will be quite invasive.

So sorry this happened to you. This is why everyone&#39;s story is so important so physicians like this can be avoided. As for the images, there is no excuse really. Not knowing where you are cutting or where significant structures like nerve roots or inf. alveolar canal (ID) are or bony variations there may be or not having adequate exposure is a recipe for disaster. Plain XR&#39;s are inadequate many times and CT particularly with Stealth imaging where you can see real time where your instruments are can prevent a lot of these problems. I personally will not have the surgery without a CT to show the structures e.g. IA canal or frontal sinus for Type III surgery. Hopefully a competent surgeon will be able to offer some help.

Hope the fact you are talking about this will not make justice for you harder to get. You have given a lot of things to make him able to defend himself, he now know exactly what he has done wrong and will be able to search what to use for mitigate it.

Diana Goetsch shared her experience with pictures and such on Facebook that Bart and his minions saw before she filed a lawsuit. Bart didn&#39;t sue her because she wasn&#39;t lying and no doctors bought Bart&#39;s made up rare blood disease as his excuse for putting her into coma. It&#39;s very hard to falsify or makeup excuses for genuine malpractice. As you based it on facts and actual evidence of the damage.

The fact is you don&#39;t need to convince a doctor but a judge, both side will give an expertise on this file. And I think he will not have any worry to get one saying he has not do something wrong because the expert have interest on saying this.

Please reach out if you need someone to talk about things with. Solutions are not always ready to make things better, but sometimes airing the words provides a level of relief and subsequent acceptance.

We woman are unique and many medical professionals want to help us feel whole. These cases of negligence affect many outside of trans surgery, we are not alone is malpractice. My sincerest support in growing and moving forward 💖💖💖

Omg i am so sorry to hear this. You should definitely take legal actions against him. He can lose his license as surgeon and pay damages and necessary corrections and Surgeries. I wish you lots of strength.

This makes me want to cry. I&#39;m so sorry this happened. Sue the shit out of him OP. The money obviously isn&#39;t going to fix what happened, but hopefully you can get some kind of revision and live a normal life. :-(
</p>
<p>
This doctor is a monster and should have his license revoked and go to jail. So many FFS surgeons prey on us financially, but it looks like this is someone who literally uses his patients for practice and to try out new techniques. What a total fucking psychopath... I hope enough lawsuits can shut down his entire practice.

Yeah a custom designed peek implant(normally used for the hip, but in the last couple year they started to be used elsewhere) and he will only remove a very small amount in the area where the implant and the chin connect so i dont get any edges other than that hes gonna do very normal stuff that pretty much everyone can do. A rinoplasty (but not much, i just dont want people to be able to see right into my head when they are the same height as me. So the nasal wings have to be lowered a bit. And while creating the cbct scan he wanted for the chin implant i found out my nasal septum was broken before and in a weird shape because of that. I want him to fix that as well. And a lipofilling in the cheeks. So i&#39;m pretty sure he cant mess that up. Pretty interested in how its actually gonna be. So far i heard everything from he&#39;s awesome and cared so much to he&#39;s an asshole and couldnt care less, all he wants is money

You&#39;re sure he can&#39;t mess up? I thought and hoped the same but he did everything wrong. He&#39;s russian roulette at best and in surgeries that&#39;s very bad but again good luck.

How do you know?  You don’t know exactly but if you careful c dissection and well versed in the anatomy c good exposure introspective you can but I think certainly safer with good imaging. I think that in future that will mean fused CT/MR and Stealth.
<br>
I suppose the thought of surgery is scary which is normal. I just concentrate on the outcome and know that complication are uncommon. I tell those who support me and share it with docs and RNs, seems to diffuse it.
