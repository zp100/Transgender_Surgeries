Hello,
</p>
<p>
I got a MtF penile flap botched 6 years ago by Dr. N. M.-J. in Lyon (France) when I was 25. Since then penetrative intercourse has been impossible at worse, very painful. Moreover, as a (then undiagnosed) autistic person quite easily influenced, I did not really want that surgery but still got it as I was peer-pressured into it.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, here am I 6 years later living as an AMAB enby with non-functional female-looking intimate parts and mostly painful intercourse.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m looking for help and advice on the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
assessment of whether I can get &#34;clitoral&#34; release with what&#39;s left of my clitglans
</li>
<li>
whether getting a sigmoid graft surgery would help me get &#34;normal&#34;, non-painful neovaginal intercourse
</li>
<li>
whether a surgeon, preferrably in Thailand, would accept to try and perform both, giving me something better than my painful and angry inch.
</li>
<li>
maybe contact info and/or price estimates.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thanks
</p>
<p>
Matcha

Hey! So it will be best to reach out and ask the different surgeons if they would take you on. You can also look into the peritoneal pull-through technique as an alternative to the sigmoid graft.

It may be an idea to make a few photos, and send them to a number of surgeons, and ask what their opinion would be.
</p>
<p>
Bluebond-Lagner and Wittenberg to my knowledge have experience with revisions and they also use peritoneal methods, which could be used to harvest tissue for a revision, should it be necessary. Those surgeons may be more expensive but they may have more experience with revisions.
</p>
<p>
Another option could be a revision with colon methods, a number of surgeons offer laparascopic methods which may leave less scars and may be less invasive. There was a review lately by someone who went to Kamol and used this technique as first surgery. It may be possible to look it up. They have a price list on the internet, and
<a href="http://phuket-plasticsurgery.com/fees.html" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
may be a list with a non laparascopic colon method. Using the less invasive method may be recommendable though. And in europe there is genitalsurgerybelgrade, who also use peritoneal methods ( and possibly also laparascopic colon methods ) and they also have experience with revisions.
