Have any trans women who’ve had vaginoplasty experienced this?
</p>
<p>
My GF is 3 months post op and we think this might be happening. Yes, she’s going to be checked by her surgeon ASAP. But in the mean time she’s feeling really low and alone about this, there’s so little info out there.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has experienced this, can you share your story with her for solidarity?

Just reassure her that she will be okay. She needs comfort more than ever. These things are normal as they are discussed as possible risks/side effects. I would see your surgeon asap and they should fix whatever issues. I&#39;ve NOT had the surgery but my friends, been on the table 4 times for the procedure. It&#39;s pretty normal to have to redo.

Prolapse isn&#39;t actually &#34;normal&#34; and isn&#39;t something anyone should
<em>
expect
</em>
to experience. Yes, they
<em>
can
</em>
happen, but it&#39;s
<em>
very
</em>
rare, and not something to be taken lightly.

Wittenberg told me to expect vaginal tightening starting around 10 to 12 weeks post op for about 2 weeks. Something about sutures. She said to go down in dilator diameter if it gets too painful.
