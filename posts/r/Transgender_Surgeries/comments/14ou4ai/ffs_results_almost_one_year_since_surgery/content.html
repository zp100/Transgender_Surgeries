Your nose looks awesome 👌 did you have forehead work done? It&#39;s hard to tell with the glasses on.

Thanks 🥰🥰
</p>
<p>
My plastic surgeon did the God damn best job on it. I love it so much.
</p>
<p>
As for forehead, yes I had the browbone shaved and my sinus pushed down and forehead rounded.

How was the recovery if you don&#39;t mind my asking? Mine is in October and I always like hearing others perspectives 😁

I don&#39;t mind at all, like I let everyone know, you can ask me any questions, I&#39;m an open book haha 😜
</p>
<p>
For the recovery, it was a very rough one for the first week but was a total of 4 weeks to completely heal.
</p>
<p>
The first week, I was so swollen and I could barely see out of my left eye and my right was swollen shut. I believe I&#39;ve heard of others having both eyes swollen shut which can make it super hard and you will depend on your caregiver for the 1st week for sure.
</p>
<p>
Luckily the 1st week you cant shower or remove your bandages so you literally have to do nothing. Eating is reduced to a liquid diet but if you have your nose done it can be harder to drink because (at least for me) it will go into my nasal cavity when trying to swallow and so it makes drinking (eating liquid lol) really hard and you&#39;ll lose weight.
</p>
<p>
Then when the second week came around, all the swollen was so reduced that I was able to do everything myself because I could see out of both eyes lol but you have to make a conscious effect to relax, not do much and not over exert yourself which is so hard to do haha, also this was when my doctor let me start showering and really scrubbing the incision on my head to help break up the dried blood and clear up the scabs.
</p>
<p>
Then week 3 and 4 are the easiest to go through but making sure that rest and eating enough though your healing is the most important.
</p>
<p>
I hope that helps give you an idea what you might have to go through, but the most important thing is to Rest, Eat and Drink plenty of water! And to know that you won&#39;t see your completed face until 8 months to 1 year when the swelling has gone down the most, so when you first see your newly made face, give it time before you have any feelings about it 😁😁😁

I&#39;m not getting my nose done so that should hopefully help with the eating part. I&#39;m hoping my eyes don&#39;t swell up but I guess if it can&#39;t be avoided it&#39;s lucky I&#39;ll have someone with me for that first couple weeks. The weight loss thing is a good note too, I haven&#39;t seen anyone talk about it really but I guess if you&#39;re not really eating it makes sense.
</p>
<p>
Thank you, yes every bit of advice or knowing what to expect is very helpful 😊

It will at least help with drinking (since you can&#39;t eat anything)
</p>
<p>
The weight loss is nice but you will gain it back so fast once you can start eating solid foods haha, trust me on that, unless you have a good diet already lol
</p>
<p>
And you are so very welcome. I&#39;m glad it was helpful and I hope when you have your surgery that you have a smooth and quick recovery and that there are no complications with your surgery ❤️❤️❤️❤️

I&#39;ve been trying to lose weight for srs anyway so my diet has been marginally better than it was a few months ago, lol. Trying to get my bmi into their &#34;healthy&#34; range, lol.
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much 😁 good luck with the next stage of yours 😊
