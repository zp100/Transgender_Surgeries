Thank you so much! I have my surgery booked on the 19th of may with him, this was a big help! Did you have private health also?

Did you have private health insurance?  That should have covered all the hospital costs, which would be very significant.

I self funded that too since private healthcare requires 12 months before they pay for pre-existing conditions and I&#39;ve not needed that since I&#39;ve been in the ADF

Thank you for posting this google doc, there&#39;s not a lot of info out there and it&#39;s reassuring to read about someone&#39;s actual experience. If you feel comfortable answering, what was your experience with the two referral letter prerequisites for surgery? I&#39;m saving up for surgery and my biggest fear is having to prove I&#39;m trans enough for surgery to someone, having someone have that power to say yes or no over me is overwhelmingly scary.

My psych letter was fairly easy to get since I went to the same psych for HRT initially,  I found it was almost the same process too like they asked a few questions about my dysphoria and I think a check to see if I was mentally fit to make the decision. Also, I only needed 1 psych letter, the reception were happy with the first one I sent off. Idk if this is because I&#39;d seen the psych for a while or  if they only need one these days

Thank you so much for answering! I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s an okay experience, I&#39;ve started seeing a psych recently but they&#39;re finishing their qualification so they don&#39;t think they can do the letter, makes me a bit nervous having to see someone new for it :/ I think I&#39;ve probably built it up in my head to be worse than it (hopefully!) will be but it&#39;s still a bit scary
