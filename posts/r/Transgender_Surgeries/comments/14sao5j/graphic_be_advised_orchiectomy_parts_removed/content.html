That is so cool!!!! Thank you for sharing!
</p>
<p>
I just had an orchi on June 29th but didn&#39;t think to ask my surgeon to take any pictures 😔
</p>
<p>
No wonder my inaugural canals hurt so bad, I didn&#39;t think the spermatic cord was anywhere near that large.

Yeah that and they pull them down (stretch) and out the sack to cut them off so they retract up into the upper canals.
</p>
<p>
Mine are still a little sore. After the pathology came back the size of the testicles were about 2/3 the normal size so there was some atrophy.

Makes sense!! I hope you fully recover soon 💜
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t mind me asking, how long have you been on HRT? Mine have definitely shrunk a lot as I&#39;ve been on HRT for over 2 years at this point.

Just for reference what kinda pain meds did they give you (if any)
</p>
<p>
For me it was only the first few days the sort of hurt if I would Lean forward (like sitting on the toilet) I just had one of the sutures fall out yesterday, feels so much better. It was poking out and would poke through my panties and then would tug with every movement. One 1/4&#34; chunk of glue left. Had my follow up with the surgeon at 2 weeks and she said everything looked great. She was a little shocked when I told her I woke up with a hard on 2 days after surgery. I have not had an un prompted hard on in 6+ months. It has happened a few times since and it&#39;s so much more 💪than it was before surgery. A lot of my size came back too. Before surgery it was like a turtle trying to get back into its shell. To the point my surgery report says I am uncircumcised. In reality I have been circumcised for 45 years. This all makes the wife happy.

They gave me &#34;Apo-Tramadol/Acet Tramadol HCI/Acetaminophen&#34; says it&#39;s an opioid on the bottle, and to take one every 6 hours as needed. I only took 2 out of the 30 in the bottle, and they were both on the day I got home from the hospital, haven&#39;t needed them since. It&#39;s worth noting I have a really high pain tolerance.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been taking pictures everyday and will post them once I&#39;m fully recovered!
</p>
<p>
I also got an erection 2 days after surgery and have had a few intermittent ones since, my understanding is it&#39;s because the body will try and produce T from the adrenal glands to compensate or something before giving up on it, though I could very well be incorrect. I don&#39;t get random erections, but I do get erect when turned on regularly though I don&#39;t use my gock in the &#39;standard&#39; way.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think they used any glue on me? There&#39;s a little bit of stitching poking out so far, but that&#39;s it, the incision isn&#39;t painful at all, I can poke at it and even grab that skin and there&#39;s no pain, it&#39;s literally just the inaugural canals where the spermatic cords were cut that&#39;s tender whenever I move, being stationary is pain-free.

They used lots of surgical glue in mine. They told me to take Advil and Tylenol. Granted I am already on pain meds for an existing chronic pain issue. My pain management clinic was shocked they didn&#39;t give me something for the pain. They were nice enough to up my pain meds (been asking for over a year to be reevaluated)been on disability since September because of my pain and finally got reevaluated. The sack never had pain except when the glue or sutures would get caught on my panties. My testosterone levels were at 17ng/dL going into surgery and dropped to 16ng/dL a week after surgery so basically the same before and after. Same with my estrogen level it was within 9 points of before. I feel my boobs have grown a cup size since surgery and dropping Spiro and finasteride. My skin got super dry after surgery. Like it was peeling off my face for about 2 weeks. It&#39;s back to normal now. All in all great experience. I would have gone straight for GRS but my disability is running out so I didn&#39;t have the time to recover from that surgery before I would have to go back to work. Maybe next year.

Omg I feel like my boobs have already grown a cup size too! I didn&#39;t have any changes other than that tbh, and I haven&#39;t had my bloodwork taken yet as my dr told me to wait 4-6 weeks after surgery to do it to get an accurate result before changing my hrt dosages (3mg EV/3.5days &amp; 200mg Prog every day - current dosage)
</p>
<p>
Great experience for me as well, everyone at the hospital was really nice.  I only got misgendered once by the first nurse I saw who missed my vein the first try putting my IV in, after that all went well.
</p>
<p>
This is an intermediary step before GRS for me too, I also would have gone straight for that but the waiting list for an orchi was 2 years and GRS 4, so I&#39;ll take it.

My every 3 months blood work was already scheduled for my PCP follow up so I went with it. I had my consult in April and got the surgery in June. My other urologist (unrelated) said he would do it for me if there was any issues with UCSF. He did my vasectomy a few years ago so he has already been in my sack 😁.

Congratulations girl on getting rid of your testicles. Did they atrophy because of your HRT regime? I plan to be able to see my pesky critters on a surgical platter soon. I just have to save up the money for the trip and the fees for the orchiectomy. Going to get the sac taken away as well. No use for it since I’m not going for vaginoplasty. Congratulations again 🏳️‍⚧️🦋🎀🤍🎀🦋🏳️‍⚧️

I had a university housemate who was in veterinary school. We’re still friends 30 years on.  She was a very outspoken lesbian and feminist and used to tell me she carried her castration tools in her purse to deal with asshole men.  I half believed her, she had been pursued across the campus green one night and after that she let a dagger strapped to her side. She was very fit and demonstrated to me how she had trained and adept at handling it.
</p>
<p>
Years later, we were having a conversation over drinks and we were both laughing about how there should be someone like ‘Dexter.’ who deals with rapists by castrating them and leaving them with a souvenir of their testicles displayed in formaldehyde.  I’ve yet to see that in the news.

Thanks for sharing! Is this prep for future bottom surgery/ies? I&#39;m debating getting things done in stages for easier recovery so I&#39;m curious about other&#39;s journeys.

Yes, for me I&#39;m still a ways out from GRS but I hated taking the testosterone blockers. This way I&#39;m done with all that and if this helps my dysphoria enough and I don&#39;t need to go through full bottom surgery great. I don&#39;t mind my external plumbing, but I have always hated my balls. They served their purpose (I have 3 kids) don&#39;t need them anymore. Had a vasectomy in 2020,wife had a hysterectomy in 2021 so there was zero chance for us to have more kids so instead of taking meds to block the testosterone and deal with the side effects just yank those bits out.

Nope. If anything I had the opposite. I have had more euphoria not having to deal with those things. My mood has stabilized. I dropped the Spiro, finasteride and my low dose antidepressant.

Nice that you got to see them. They pulled on the cords, and cut them high it looks like. I&#39;m a nullo and when they did my orchiectomy 5 years prior to my penectomy, the cords were left long. Then when I got my penectomy, the surgeon told me he had to trim my cords back 3 inches or they would be too close to the surface with all the tissue that was removed and be uncomfortable. It felt like my balls had been cut off again.

Dilation’s on the surgery! It is such a Wii off the shoulder so to speak, right? I know it certainly was for me. Also, good for you for asking for photos. Mine were removed in two separate surgeries as it was cancer related, although I am thankfully all good now. Anyway, my point is that I am so glad that on the second surgery I thought to also ask for a photo to be taken. I guess it’s subjectively kind of gross? But at the same time it’s definitely been a good conversation starter lol All the best in recovery and once again, congrats!

I wanted to keep my after-surgery, but was not told it was an option.  Would have been perfect, to have them encased in resin and keep them in my purse.
