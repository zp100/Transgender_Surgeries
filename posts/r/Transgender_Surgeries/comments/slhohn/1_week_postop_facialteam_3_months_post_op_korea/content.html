I got my jaw, chin, nose, and cheeks done a couple months ago in Korea. Just came back from Spain from type iii forehead surgery.
</p>
<p>
Still a little swollen, but everything went super well!

It was a clinic in Gangnam called AB Plastic Surgery. Primarily locals go there, so it‚Äôs nice to know a little Korean or being someone that knows

Thank you so much! üíï
</p>
<p>
Oof the pain was something else. Waking up from that jaw operation was the most discomfort I‚Äôve ever felt in my life, not exaggerating. I think the worst part was the post op mucous forming in my mouth while I was dehydrated af from not being allowed to drink water 8 hours before. It was slimy, but also very dry which makes no sense.
</p>
<p>
Then, you can‚Äôt eat solids for a good month ~ 2months, so you‚Äôre stuck eating Ï£Ω(jook) which is a Korean porridge; honestly I love jook, but my mom made it for me a lot as a kid, so it‚Äôs sentimental.
</p>
<p>
Swelling is an ordeal. Anything and everything for the next 6 months of your life should be dedicated to reducing the swell: Cucumber water, quartz rollers, put your Korean face masks in the fridge, don‚Äôt eat salt, don‚Äôt eat solids. You can see in my photos that 3 months post, I‚Äôm STILL super swollen. My doctors in Spain were like ‚Äúhow recent was ur surgery in Korea??‚Äù lmaoo. Jaw and chin swelling can go for about 1year ~ 2years. You‚Äôll hate how you look in the meantime, so have fun with that.
</p>
<p>
But let me tell you the cost-effectiveness of this. I‚Äôm very vain, and seeing even a little bit of the results show through the swelling, I am 1000% a happier person. Though my dysphoria was fixed probably as a result of all my surgeries together, my jaw+chin actually makes me feel pretty. If I had to do it again, I would.

Whoa, sounds even worse than what I prepared for hahah. But like you said, it is worth it. The porridge bit cracked me up, ahaha I had tons of it in childhood as well.

Wishing you a speedy recovery, thanks for the reply.

I was thinking about going to Korea for FFS. Will it be ok as someone from Europe, do you think, who isn&#39;t Korean and also doesn&#39;t speak the language? Major congrats on your surgeries :)

For surgeries I would try
<a href="http://www.docfinderkorea.com">Docfinder Korea
</a>
. They offer an English speaking point of contact between you and the clinic on top of organizing your trip (stay, taxi, !!PCR FOR RETURN TRIP!!). I know they get paid by big clinics to get foreigners to go to their hospitals, but the clinics that do pay ‚Äî JK and NANA being the big ones ‚Äî are pretty decent. Even locals use their clinics. NANA is pretty up and coming, so they have a reputation to uphold.
</p>
<p>
As for exploring Korea, you can get along just fine as the subway system has English juxtapositions on all their signs and route systems. Most people, especially the younger generation, know enough English to carry out transactional conversations. Just make sure you get a Korean SIM at the airport because a Korean number is very useful.

Thanks :) I hear some people saying I should go to a western surgeon because of the differences in facial structure between white European and Korean faces, but also that Korea has some of the best surgeons and it&#39;d generally cheaper  - so I feel like i need to learn a lot.

This is primarily why I wanted to go to a local Korean clinic. I thought they would be more familiar working on my face as I‚Äôm Korean. The funny thing is that Korean people want aesthetically western noses, which is why they pulled my bridge out like that üòÇ.
</p>
<p>
I have seen western customers go to Korea for surgery and get Korean features though, and it looks really cute.

I don&#39;t wanna go with facial team because they have very little effect, some don&#39;t pass after, most of the people who go already passed. and they told me that they won&#39;t touch my jaw during the consultation but they do touch other people&#39;s jaws so it&#39; confusing

Thank you!! I‚Äôll DM you some before photos~
</p>
<p>
Jaw work is super dangerous, and the recovery on that was BRUTAL. If it doesn‚Äôt contribute much to your dysphoria, I would stay away. I got it mainly for aesthetic reasons.
</p>
<p>
And I didn‚Äôt know there was a facialteam in Italy! I went to the one in Marbella, Spain. I live in California, and traveled to Spain and Korea (separately) for my surgeries. My butt is absolutely mad at me for those long flights.

on my experience with jaw. It definitely it scary, and there is a divide between Korean doctors who will and won‚Äôt operate the jaw because of its potential complications. You just have to find the right one.
</p>
<p>
I want to say that the jaw isn‚Äôt a big factor in making a more feminine face, but I know exactly how that particular brand of dysphoria feels, which is why I got my jaw done. I will suggest getting masseter Botox first, just to see how you would feel with less muscle there.
</p>
<p>
Also, l-shaped jaws are hot ü•µ

Oh cool! I did not know that. I had ffs with them 3years ago, and also in April. It was a really wonderful experience and I couldn&#39;t be happier with the results. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be very happy with yours too

You look absolutely gorgeous! Well done on having the patience on waiting and getting them done in stages!
</p>
<p>
Out of curiosity, what did they use for the nose? Rib cartilage? Gortex? Silicone? :)

Thank you so much!
</p>
<p>
During my consultation, my surgeons in Korea told me that they may need to take cartilage from my rib or behind my ear, but post surgery they said they found some in my face that could be used üòÇ

My pleasure! I meant it!
</p>
<p>
Wow! I‚Äôm glad for you- saved you other incisions!
</p>
<p>
I had a huge nose and my primary rhinoplasty did t go as planned - the surgeon in Turkey literally saved down my bridge and my sunnies fall!
</p>
<p>
I have no choice but to have it augmented now and im hoping Dr Cardena‚Äôs wife uses cartilage vs implants.
</p>
<p>
You have a fab nose and I dare say im going to show them this pic (with your permission)- major nose goals! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüåπüôèüèº
