I am 3 months post-op. 2 weeks ago I started to feel pain in my right buttock and leg when I reach 8-9 cm depth during dilation. Maximum what I can fit is 10 cm. I tried different angles but it doesn’t help each time.
</p>
<p>
I keep using Emla local anesthetic cream for dilation. It was prescribed by my gynecologist, without it it’s too painful to dilate.
</p>
<p>
Another problem is that I still cannot stand still more than a minute because of pain. I can walk and sit on a special pillow, but standing gets too painful after a minute.
</p>
<p>
When I met my surgeon for last time, we made MRT of my internal organs and he said everything looks good. He suggested me to do more activities like swimming and yoga.
</p>
<p>
But why do I hurt my leg when dilating?..
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: pain in leg during dilation disappeared itself quite fast. Standing and sitting was getting easier and easier but very slowly. Now I am 7 months post-op have almost no pain during day. Still have some now, but it doesn’t mean much, expecting it to disappear completely during next months

Pain in the buttom/leg-part (hardening) is normal because of the leg muscle (quadriceps), which next to the pelvis muscle. When you lay down and take up the legs, your leg muscle is used / tensed. Same happens, if you lean your hand on your leg while dilating, your muscle will be stressed. So, it will be affected by dilating and can cause pain (in other words: you butt hurts, or even your belly, if you keep your arm 30-40 mins in the same position.
</p>
<p>
What to do: WALK - MOVE - RUN - unbelievable but movement/sport/stretch is key to relax that quadriceps muscle! Second, do pelvis muscle training. Third, while dilating try not to touch your leg with the hand. Also try using BOTH hands to dilate, in order to avoid to use only one. /edit You can also dilate with your feet! (to hold) Forth, try to keep your leg muscles as relaxed as your pelvis muscle should be. Many people can&#39;t control their muscles that good, only training will help! I mean, it is possible to spread the legs with much less tensed muscles, if you do Yoga or whatever.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, avoid staying at home too long after GRS, as a healthy body (walks, etc.) will recover better than just staying at home and taking pain killers.

Thank you so much for reply! So this was 2 years ago and I am completely fine now. In retrospect I think that my mistake was to stay home after the surgery for too long. Had to walk more, keep moving

Probably just sore muscle from recovery. 3 months out, you’re like, a month and a half passed recovery time. Decreased activity for that long will cause tenderness, especially in the glutes and thighs along the sciatic nerve. Just the nature of long recoveries. Your doctor is right. Just keep active and the tension in the sciatic nerve will lessen, and will become less prone to tensing up.

Thank you very much for answer. I just returned from spa where I got a massage. I asked to especially massage that part of my legs in the top, almost at buttocks. And now I feel much better with movements and standing. However I still cannot stand more than 60 seconds straight, pain comes to vagina. But since yesterday I learnt to move my weight from one leg to another while standing. And this way I can stand for several minutes.
</p>
<p>
I am flying to Phuket tomorrow, will start swimming.
</p>
<p>
Do hope that this is going to be my last flight when I use a wheelchair. I still need it now because I cannot stand in a line at passport and security controls

Definitely just tension in the muscles around the sciatic nerve then! Massage is a bandaid. Swimming is DEFINITELY a great way to get that fixed up. Get those low impact leg/glute workouts in.

Yes, I&#39;m having this same symptoms when dilating, the leg someone both legs, get a nerve like pinch sensation down to the feets...it starts at the point where the dikator is hitting near 10 cms or more. There are pelvic muscles and the Core of our moving body power. Too many important things concentrated there in a tiny space.
