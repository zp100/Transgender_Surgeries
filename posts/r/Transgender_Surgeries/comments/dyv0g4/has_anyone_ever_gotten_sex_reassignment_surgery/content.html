Has anyone ever gotten sex reassignment surgery without having to prove you&#39;ve been on hormones or have psychological evaluations of being trans?

At least in Thailand it requires a psyche evaluation, and 2 years of hormones (which eventually I&#39;ll qualify for) I&#39;m just a bit worried if I&#39;m evaluated as &#34;not trans enough or at all&#34; and end up getting barred for it.
</p>
<p>
Is there any reputable surgeon (relatively cheap) that would would allow somebody who isn&#39;t trans to get a sex change?
</p>
<p>
I just really dislike the function, role, and aesthetics of the male reproductive system and just want it gone.

I just had my SRS in Thailand and despite having a recommendation from an Australian psych I was made to see two there.  And it was a joke.  Whole process took an hour and they asked questions like
</p>
<p>
How long have you liked boys?  How long have you been living female? What are your plans for the future?
</p>
<p>
Not telling the surgeon by the psychs were at Praram 9 Hospital

Did you have to pay extra for the second psych? That might have been why, as its not legally required.

Included in my package and was required under Thai rules. At least thatâ€™s what I was told. It was only 2000 baht.  Not much in the grand scheme

Assuming you&#39;re living in Thailand, I think you&#39;re just running into lots of gate keeping rather than actual legal requirements. If you look at Suporn&#39;s requirements its nothing like what you&#39;re running into, and you can be sure he&#39;s operating within the law.
</p>
<p>
The law, translated into English, is here
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.thailawforum.com/Guidelines-sex-change-operations.html">http://www.thailawforum.com/Guidelines-sex-change-operations.html
</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
To consult a psychiatrist for assessment, diagnosis of the condition, diagnosis for characterizing the condition, and assistance given to the person according to the guidelines of the Psychiatry College of Thailand.
</li>
<li>
Once a psychiatrist has made a psychiatric diagnosis on the ailing person indicating a predisposition for a sex change operation, the psychiatrist shall send the person for consultation with an endocrinologist to consider the use of hormones in treatment.
</li>
<li>
The endocrinologist must examine, diagnose, recommend, and treat the ailing person of every age group by considering the appropriate type and dosage of the hormone therapy.
</li>
<li>
The psychiatrist must make recommendations to every person receiving treatment and the person receiving treatment must experience living the life of the desired sex for at least one year, and assessment must be made on the results for consideration of further treatment by means of a sex change operation.
<br>
</li>
<li>
In the event there is a predisposition for treatment by means of a sex change operation, the person receiving treatment must receive approval from at least two psychiatrists.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you have a letter from a foreign psych
</p>
<ul>
<li>
After the sex change operation, the relevant doctors in the treatment must provide follow-up care and consultation as appropriate.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I&#39;d probably contact the surgeons you&#39;re interested in and see what their rules are - and ask if they can recommend two psychs to write you&#39;re letters. I don&#39;t think surgeons care much as long as you have the letters. Given what Thailand appears to be like it would probably help if you present female as well as possible.

Awww, Thank you (again) for your help :) I&#39;m overseas and will be for the next few months. I kind of skipped the initial psychological evaluation part though. After much gate keeping I coincidentally met an Endo at Chula hospital who went &#34;yeah sure I&#39;ll give you hormones&#34; so I&#39;ve been E for almost a year.
</p>
<p>
Hahahha, Desired sex. Hopefully it hasn&#39;t been lost in translation or just the laws not differentiating between sex and gender. But my desired perceived social sex is just the same*, I just don&#39;t want a penis.
</p>
<p>
Anyways it&#39;s quite far away and when I get back I still need to get on blockers, still don&#39;t have enough money to self fund, I doubt my family would help out.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
probably secretly wants to be seen as a girl but is either in denial or too scared of not passing or being seen as wanting attention, dis-honoring my family and trying to be something I&#39;m not.
</li>
</ul>

Could you say more about your experience at Chula Hospital? The name of the endo and how he does HRT? I&#39;d  like to add it to the wiki I&#39;m working on.
</p>
<p>
I guess you mean King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital?

Yep, the one next to lumpini. My apologies, it&#39;s been a while since and I&#39;ve never met the endo again. But it seemed to be a one off thing that was against protocols.
</p>
<p>
Tangerine I know was willing to just prescribe it but had to say no to me because of my earlier visit to Bangkok hospital (pschiatrist there said no, so tangerine had to trust the psch). The endo I met was like &#34;Psychiatrist don&#39;t know about hormones - it won&#39;t give you more depression, I&#39;m gonna prescribe&#34;  Which I was thankful for.
</p>
<p>
Chula hospital on the 7th floor (gynecologist) has a gender diversity clinic that opens only on a particular day (the person on tangerine&#39;s facebook management team should know if you message them , they recommended i go there)
</p>
<p>
Later attempts bookings were not so successful though since when they refered me to a psche the information wasn&#39;t passed on so my appointment (which I had to come line up before 5:30 to get the queue cards for walk ins) was useless. They try to keep an internal system where the endo, phychologist and surgeons are all connected, but getting a psychological evaluation to continue with blockers was difficult - I tried in september to get a slot and the next one was in december.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s pretty difficult to understand if you don&#39;t speak thai. Some doctors have conflicting viewsbut at least it&#39;s not as bad as Bangkok hospital&#39;s gatekeeping in general. It&#39;s overcrowded/booked but really cheap compared to private hospitals (consultation is free I think, only the medication cost money and it&#39;s cheaper than in pharmacys in general. Might be worth blood testing elsewhere, though if you do it there the info does get sent to the doctors

I&#39;m not in Thailand, but I do like collecting information in case I ever need it, or if there&#39;s any others that do. There&#39;s a few Thai people here.
</p>
<p>
Personally I&#39;d not bother with a doctor in Thailand and just do diy. They appear to be fairly hopeless on HRT. I have heard that Tangerine did really low levels. Pretty bad.
</p>
<p>
By the way, it looks like Tangerine is closed.

What price range surgeon are you looking for?
</p>
<p>
Outside the likes of Chettawut and Suporn there&#39;s not much information in English on most Thai surgeons. I believe there&#39;s some Thai trans Facebook groups, so you might have some luck there. I&#39;d assume it must be pretty easy to meet Thai transwomen and ask their opinions.

Price is so far off right now, I&#39;m probably going to have to pay for it myself and I&#39;m still a student. I don&#39;t really know what budget seems reasonable until I get a job. I could try asking around

There&#39;s a huge range in cost and you&#39;ll get Thai rates from most of them. Depends on how many years you want to save up too.

I mean I&#39;m trans, I&#39;ve been on hormones, I&#39;ve had FFS, but I was only full time for a bit over 6 months when I had bottom surgery in Thailand. (I took a while to get comfortable enough to go full time)
</p>
<p>
I just lied and said I was full time sooner.
</p>
<p>
I got a new therapist here (to get my letter to give to the Suporn clinic) and lied about my full time date to her too.

<p>
Bam. Everything you need for surgery.

It probably depends on the country you&#39;re in, but generally speaking if you can afford it and can give informed consent, there are plenty of doctors who will do it.  Insurance coverage is a different matter, though.  In the US, at least, even with a nice healthcare plan, a super liberal doctor, and a willing surgeon, insurance companies still do the awful gatekeeping.

I&#39;ve never heard of a surgeon who will do SRS without psych letters. However getting letters is not necessarily difficult and can amount to informed consent via the psych.

I know right? I mean what are the doctors thinking when they slice breast off of humans (masectomy) or even implant unatural materials that could cause infection (breast augmentation) , mullitate people&#39;s labia (labiaplasty), cut into people&#39;s faces and shave bone off their skull, or heck even slice off foreskin.
</p>
<p>
Meh, I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re on the same page. The doctors seem happy to comply if people jump through some arbitrary hoops to get paperwork (check the other post in this thred) - somebody was able to lie to get the paperwork and the paperwork is a requirement of the thai law.

So we are somewhat on the same page then :) apologies for my rudeness and sarcasm - that was more so to highlight that for some surgeries don&#39;t require the same hoops to my knowledge. Ofcourse I&#39;d expect some form of consultation. Well I haven&#39;t quite gotten to the psycho test stage yet so i&#39;m not even sure what they require.
</p>
<p>
In regards to the post I&#39;m refering to identifying as trans as arbitrary
<em>
there goes he chances for anyone who might jump in to support me
</em>
. I&#39;m not too concerned about the hoops unless &#34;you need to identify as a girl&#34; is in said hoops

Well, if you&#39;ve been for two years on hormones you would probably pass the psych evaluation. As much as we like to fight gatekeeping, there is a reasonable argument that such checks are necessary. Furthermore the psych evaulation is there not to see if you&#39;re trans enough at this point, but whether you can cope with the surgery and its consequences. Recovery can be very tough and if you have some standing psych problems it is a good idea to deal with them first.
