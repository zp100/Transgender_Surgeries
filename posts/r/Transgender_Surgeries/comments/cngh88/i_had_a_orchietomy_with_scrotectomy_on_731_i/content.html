I had a orchietomy with scrotectomy on 7/31. I wanted this as my final surgery. I don‚Äôt want to the ‚Äúfull‚Äù surgery, I never had much dysphoria about my penis. I knew I wanted my testes removed. I hope it is good enough angle. Ask me any thing.

Are you able to get an erection still? I&#39;ve thought about getting one for awhile, but I would prefer to keep that ability

I stopped getting erections before I started HRT. I had very low testosterone. It was around 134. Which is very low for a male. Nothing helped. Then I started HRT.  I don‚Äôt want erections. I am happy to receive. I hope that answered your question. If have them already, this procedure shouldn‚Äôt change that.

I just want to quickly add that I personally can still get erections, 18 months HRT while T is currently at ~25 ng/dL. Granted, I basically stopped getting random erections during the day, but it has not yet been an issue in the bedroom.

I just got my orchiectomy a week ago. I&#39;m still getting erections. If you can get erections on HRT, you&#39;ll be able to get erections post-orchi.

Hello!  I&#39;m a mtf age 23 &amp; 1yr into HRT. I&#39;m non op GRS/SRS by choice. But I&#39;m undergoing a bilateral orchiectomy this fall. I&#39;m very exited. Aside from the orchi my transition is all simple cosmetic treatments.  My questions are how much money did it cost you? I know majority of health insurances cover this but still curious. Did you do local or general anesthesia? What was your total time spent at the hospital despite it being outpatient? What&#39;s the pain like?  &amp; lastly should I get a scrotectomy with my orchi if I&#39;m non op?  Thanks &amp; congrats on your transition journeyüòä

I am taking basically 2 weeks off work. I go back on the 12th but you can take off a shorter if you have a office job. I felt I would be grouchy if I went back to work early than I will. I didn‚Äôt want that to happen. It can take up to 6 weeks to fully recover and have everything healed. I couldn‚Äôt drive because I was on pain meds. I had to buy a seat donut for sitting in the car or hard places. It isn‚Äôt a requirement but it helped me. It is uncomfortable.  You can not lift over 10-20 pounds during recovery.
</p>
<p>
I wasn‚Äôt asked to stop HRT. I didn‚Äôt stop. I have had no ill side effects from not stopping.

How did you convince your urologist to do a scrotectomy? I tried to no avail, she just kept saying &#34;you need the scrotal tissue for SRS&#34; even though I don&#39;t want srs.

I went to a surgeon that just about specializes in trans related surgeries. She does other cosmetic surgeries but she is great. She was a surgeon in the USA Air Force.  I highly recommend Cosmetic Concierge in Charolette, NC. I live in East Tennessee so it is just a 4 hour drive away from me. She may not be so convenient to you, I am going back next year to get breast augmentation. The whole experience with her and her team is magical, in that I mean she always places the patient first. They treated me like family.  That meant the world to me. I wasn‚Äôt just a number.
</p>
<p>
Even though I didn‚Äôt have a labioplasty or full GRS. She wrote me a Gender reassignment surgery letter. You can read it what it says on a different post in my history.

Hi! I am scheduled for orchid in three weeks and, yeah, I also really am not super interested in having full bottom surgery. I had been advised to save the scrotum just in case but I have started reading abut how you don&#39;t have to so your perspective interests me. I am mostly excited to remove as much bulge as possible and lower my E dose. My fears are around orgasm and erection. I get erections still even w/ T fully suppressed (undetectable) but they are softer, not usable for penetration. I like my former penises reinvention as a big floppy clit but orgasm comes from this clit AND from prostate manipulation by my partner. Did your orchid effect orgasm at all? My urologist said it wouldn&#39;t but I gotta ask around! I guess I am having difficulty imagining what it would look like down there if the scrotum was gone. Can you describe?
