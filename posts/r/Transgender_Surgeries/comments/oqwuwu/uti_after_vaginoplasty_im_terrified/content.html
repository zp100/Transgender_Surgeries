Hey guys i suspect that i have a UTI. I went to a pool party and had to go to the bathroom all the time after that....feeling unsatisfied each time. I&#39;m almost 3 month post op and I&#39;ve taken an appointment with a random doctor to get it checked. I&#39;m extremely terrified about the idea of showing my bottom part to a random doctor and explaining that I&#39;m trans. The symptoms are less worst now and I&#39;m thinking of canceling my appointment because of my anxiety. Am i been over dramatic?

You need a trusted doctor. Why are you going to a rando? Please please please for the love of god find yourself a trusted doctor. Ask in your local trans support community who is good with trans people. Reddit can&#39;t help you here.

They probably will just ask for a urine sample.

I had a UTI a few weeks after bottom surgery. I actually just called my surgeon and she sent in a prescription for the antibiotics. I’ve never heard of a doctor needing to do an exam for a UTI either, I don’t think there’s a way to tell from the outside (but I could be wrong). I’ve had a couple since and when I called my PCP she was also able to just send medicine in no problem. I didn’t even need an appointment.
</p>
<p>
There is medicine you can get at your local drug store (no prescription needed) that can help at least a little (nothing is going to have the full effects of antibiotics) but I’ve found Azo urinary pain relief to help aid in these situations greatly. (Just a heads up: it turns your urine BRIGHT orange and that’s 100% normal!)
</p>
<p>
Good luck! ❤️

You can buy at home UTI test strips at places like Walmart or CVS or any pharmacy like store. Brands like AZO or just store brand. It&#39;s the same strip they use at the docs to test for infection. If it&#39;s positive, you could call and say you tested and need antibiotics from your main doc? They&#39;re usually by feminine products.

It’s a very simple thing to take care of, but you do need to see a doctor. If you don’t, you can risk the infection moving up your bladder and into your kidneys, and if it’s allowed to continue unabated, you can risk getting kidney failure and in the worst case scenario death.
</p>
<p>
You can visit any random doctor or health care provider or even a nurse. Immediate care health clinics are especially good at taking care of UTI’s. Just make sure the clinic is covered under your insurance.
</p>
<p>
They’ll take a urine sample (you pee into a cup in a private bathroom). They will probably do a preliminary urine analysis within 15 min, to check for presence of white blood cells (which indicates an infection). If they do, they’ll send the urine sample to a lab for further analysis to identify the specific bacteria in the culture. Meanwhile, the doctor will prescribe you an antibiotic to treat the UTI. You’ll walk out of there with a prescription (usually for Bactrim, nitrofurantoin (macrobid), or ciprofloxacin (Cipro)) and you’ll usually feel better as quickly as an hour or two after you take your first antibiotic pill.
</p>
<p>
It’s very easy and non invasive. You won’t ever show your private parts. Please see a doctor right away though, to confirm the presence of bacteria in your bladder, and to prevent the infection from spreading.
</p>
<p>
Getting a UTI is extremely common for anyone with a vagina and almost everyone will experience it at some point. It’s normal, but the sooner you see a doctor the better.

They shouldn&#39;t have to look at anything, will likely just do a urinalysis.
</p>
<p>
I recommend buying some D-Massone. I had a uti for almost 3 months after my surgery and it&#39;s finally going away after using it.

I know this is an old thread, but I really can’t recommend D-mannose enough. I even found a brand that combines it with cranberry extract, it fixed me right up.

Cranberry juice those have always helped or at least I think it have. I have never took antibiotics for mines …

Usually UTI will just need urine sample. In my limited experience it takes few days to get back because they have to culture the sample. I wouldn’t think they need to exam you.

You just pee in a cup and they tell you yes or no. And don&#39;t hesitate to get it checked out. I had a uti right after as well that turned in a kidney infection that went septic and nearly killed me. So take it from me, get it checked out

Usually UTIs are diagnosed via urine sample. Mine was blood in the urine. Cleared up with some anti biotics.
</p>
<p>
If they prescribe you antibiotics, buy some yogurt or something like Kombucha to eat/drink on the side (not with). You&#39;ll need a probiotic to keep your stomach (good) bacteria alive while the uti gets taken care of.
