Hello!! I had MTF Vaginoplasty with Tina Rashid on the 17th June on the NHS and I thought I‚Äôd do an ask me anything for people curious about getting the surgery on the NHS!
</p>
<p>
Few things:
</p>
<p>
I was waiting 3 years for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I have healed very well with little complications :D
</p>
<p>
I am from Glasgow!
</p>
<p>
I am 22 years old.
</p>
<p>
Nothing is off limits I‚Äôll answer almost anything about my experience, I‚Äôve also had penetrative sex with my vagina (did so about a week ago) so feel free to ask questions related to that too &lt;33
</p>

you said you were waiting 3 years for surgery? how did you get it so fast? I&#39;ve been told the waiting time for 1st appointments is 49 months which is 4 years and then I imagine you&#39;d need to wait another year or more to get surgery.

I was on the waiting list for Brighton until September 2021, I was changed to London due to the surgeon retiring and I got called in February 2022 to go for a consultation in March. I then got my surgery in June. No clue how I got it so fast but I was told by Sandyford that Rashid‚Äôs waiting list was only recently opened so it might be that? Although I feel like Rashid has been on the NHS for a while so idk if my gender doctor was telling the truth or not

I should also add that when I got called to go in June they said ‚ÄúAn appointment has opened up‚Äù so maybe it was a cancellation? I didn‚Äôt really ask I just said YES PLS PLS hahah

Thank you for the reply, I thought there might have been a way to get it faster üò• but I looked back through this subreddit and found a post from 3 years ago concerning tina üòä

well as soon as I realised I&#39;m transgender I immediately went to the gp for a GIC referral because of the wait time so I&#39;m glad I figured it out so early üòÖ 18 btw so I&#39;ll probably get my surgery when I&#39;m 23-24 which isn&#39;t so bad. but considering genital dysphoria is the worst part for me its a bit frustrating. But there are always people who have it worse than you so I guess I&#39;m quite fortunate to only have these problems üòÖ Thanks for the good vibes.ü•∞

I‚Äôm still quite numb inside and I was really anxious of hurting myself but still enjoyed it the first time! I cried of euphoria after haha.
</p>
<p>
Second and third time was much better, very minimal bleeding and pain and it felt really nice. Once I learned to stop being so tense and nervous it became a really great experience and I‚Äôm very happy with it

Am on the waiting list, not sure what questions to ask other than how was recovery - how much could you get about at 1, 2, 4 weeks out of hosp etc? How much pain was there? Any complications?
</p>
<p>
Basically I&#39;m debating whether to tell my family and leaning towards no but also I see them fairly frequently like maybe every 4-6 weeks so it&#39;s hard
</p>
<p>
Like other comment if you are comfortable sharing your results privately that would be appreciated ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I didn‚Äôt have much pain after 2 weeks post op! There was nerve pain but I found that uncomfortable rather than painful and it went away about week 3. Only complications I had was granulation (which is very common, I treat it by putting steroid cream on my bigger dilator). I also had a UTI and bacterial vaginosis but they both went fairly quickly after being put on antibiotics.

I&#39;m going with Tina Rashid because she&#39;s a good surgeon and I like her methods, but I&#39;ve not seen many surgery results from 1-12 months afterwards. I guess the few I have are: 1) what were your expectations in terms of aesthetics and functionality and 2) were they met?

My expectations for aesthetics weren‚Äôt much. I have a long term boyfriend so I didn‚Äôt really care if it didnt look exactly like a cis vagina as long as it functioned and I could wear whatever i wanted. It ended up looking really natural though!! Very happy with how it looks, it also functions great! Ive had multiple orgasms, it takes a lot of effort to get there but I can manage after about 30 minutes :-)) If anything it surpassed my expectations. I wanted my dysphoria gone, even if it meant having an odd looking vagina but it looks and functions great I couldnt be happier

Yeah, after seeing the Great Wall of Vagina, I&#39;d rather just have the function.

Congratulations. And that&#39;s very good getting it via NHS so quickly. I am 3.5 years on the waiting list for Sandyford. I ended up self-funding and am about 2 weeks post Op now. From Stirling myself. I might have some Q&#39;s during my own recovery via PM if that&#39;s OK?

Hair removal I didnt need any !! Id say I have average hair growth and brown hair.
</p>
<p>
I was in hospital for 6 days with no complications but some complications can have u stay longer.
</p>
<p>
For aesthetics I had no input but I‚Äôm very happy. My boyfriend said even with the scars he wouldnt be able to tell and I‚Äôm only 3.5 months post op!

Well I m so happy for you but considering o ve waited over 4 years already and hinted that at least another year or 3 on top of that it‚Äôs clearly ageism and it‚Äôs massive  We pay into the system all our lives and get put at the back of the queue and worse

Now I&#39;m not 100% fact checked on this but  it seems creditable ,comes from the referal service themselves ,but the long waits are part of the new way they manage the referal service . They now do mass bookings of 50 at a time work through 25 of them and then book the next 50,it seems to have caused a roadblock as a lot of people are getting letters making the service worse with confusion ,saying their  referal is on hold on  the waiting list but not given any time frame .
