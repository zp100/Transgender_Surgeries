Two years ago I decided to undergo SRS operations - a story almost from a horror movie but with a happy ending.
</p>
<p>
I live in Poland and our insurance does not cover any SRS procedures. So I had to save money and find a hospital where SRS is performed for reasonable money. My first choice was a hospital in Krakow. I did all the required tests, came to the hospital and in December 2020 I had my surgery.
</p>
<p>
After surgery, I woke up with a lot of pain and with intense bleeding. I was anesthetized with some opiates, I had a catheter and an ice pack. What I had down there looked like bloody cauliflower. After 3 days I was forced to walk, when I left bloody footprints on the floor. I was in such a bad condition that I basically had to learn how to walk again. After 7 days I was discharged from the hospital and my relatives took me home. I stayed at home for another week. After 10 days I went to my doctor to remove my catheter. What I had between my legs scared her so much that she decided not to remove the catheter and I had to go all the way to Krakow again, simply to remove it. After the next 2 weeks, it turned out that a lot of tissues had necrosis and the doctor had to remove them, including my clitoris. In addition, my vagina (made with the Colon technique) was so sensitive that I couldn&#39;t even touch it. After all this, my mental state was very bad, and on top of that, I was basically left out without any help.
</p>
<p>
I returned to physical fitness after about 7-8 months after the operation. I was looking for a doctor who could help me get my bottom in order. Unfortunately in Poland no one was able to help me. Two years after the operation, I managed to make contact with Darcie Silver, who works at the Kamol clinic in Bangkok. After exchanging documentation and photos, it turned out that Dr. Kamol is able to reoperate my pit. I managed to get money and a few weeks ago I found myself in a clinic in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
I would like to focus on the four most important aspects of my stay at this clinic:
</p>
<p>
- Preoperative care
</p>
<p>
- Operation
</p>
<p>
- Postoperative care
</p>
<p>
- Comfort and mental support throughout your stay
</p>
<p>
First: when I arrived at the hospital, all the necessary tests were done, I was always looked after by a nurse or an accompanying person, I always knew what was happening to me. Doctor Kamol turned out to be a very good man, but more importantly, he correctly diagnosed what mistakes had been made during the previous operation and presented two plans to repair my pit.
</p>
<p>
Secondly: I tolerated the surgery very well. There was no pain or bleeding after the operation. I also did not require opioid anesthesia. In fact, the next day I was able to walk without any problems. I managed to unclog my vagina without much intervention, re-form my labia and, what is important, rebuild my clitoris so that I can feel it.
</p>
<p>
Third: I spent 6 days after the operation in the hospital where everything was clean and sterile. The nurses changed my dressings twice a day, I could get whatever anesthesia I wanted. Really, the standards of care were way off better than in Poland, which is supposedly located in Europe. After 6 days, I was transferred to a hotel building where I could recover in peace and quiet, but where nursing care was still available. The nurses taught me how to care for the operated sites, how and what drugs to use, and provided me with a supply of drugs for the time of convalescence at home. They also taught me all the rules of dilation and you get a set of dilators for yourself.
</p>
<p>
Fourthly: because after the first surgery I had a huge trauma, Darcie and all the people who took care of me supported me mentally all the time. Really, if it wasn&#39;t for their support and commitment, I would be terrible because I was functioning on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Darcie was with me at all major medical events, checkups, and research. Then she helped us organize time during recovery. She took care of a lot of administrative and financial matters for us and helped us in all hospital procedures.
</p>
<p>
What else can I say, I just recommend this hospital, Darcie, and if I do anything else, I will definitely come back.
