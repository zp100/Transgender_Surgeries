I don&#39;t have any plans to use Dr Burin but I wanted to get some answers that would better help those that are planning to.
</p>
<p>
How was the experience with their team? Where they respectful, kind, accommodating?
</p>
<p>
How was post op? Did they give you the proper direction for post op care?
</p>
<p>
Would you say that you are satisfied with the experience and results?
</p>
<p>
Did you have any moment of discomfort with Dr Burin while under their care?
</p>
<p>
And finally, is there any information that could better prepare a person planning to use Dr Burin?

</p>
<p>
The team are amazing.  I was picked up on time by the driver Im and driven straight to PAI’s offices.  There I met Bune; the English speaking liaison and signed all my paperwork and gave some blood for tests.  Later I met manager Jesse and they are two of the nicest men I’ve ever met.
<br>
Burin himself has a great bedside manner and is a lovely, gentle man.
</p>
<p>
How was post op? Did they give you the proper direction for post op care?  Post op I was in Phayathai 2 hospital for 5 days during which time I was taught to care for myself.  Every time I had an enquiry Jesse was a phone call or text message away and was back to me quickly.  He still looks after me in that respect.
</p>
<p>
Would you say that you are satisfied with the experience and results? I’m very happy with the results and was back at work in 7 weeks with some discomfort but not too bad.
</p>
<p>
Did you have any moment of discomfort with Dr Burin while under their care? It’s major surgery. Trust me. There is discomfort. But pain was managed well and I am now largely pain free
</p>
<p>
And finally, is there any information that could better prepare a person planning to use Dr Burin? Don’t be scared.  He is very compassionate and the team are great.  I went to Thailand for surgery and made friends.  I like that his team are now a part of my life.

My experience mimics this posters. PAI is without a doubt, based on anecdotal info alone, the place to have this procedure done.  They also do Colo and my feiend whom had a failed procedure with Chett then used Dr. Burin to have a do over and have her failed PI redone with Colovaginoplasty.  She has lived with her boyfriend the last few years and they are expected to be getting married soon! Oh.....and yeah, Bune is amazing...lol. Dr. Burin and Dr. Sutin are simply the best at what they do. And why wouldn&#39;t they be? They were trained by the pioneer in SRS, Dr. Preecha. Many of the best U.S. surgeons trained with him to learn his techniques and still use his process to this day.

I stayed for 30 days and was treated with the utmost care and respect the entire time I was there. Payathai Hospital was as nice ir kicer than any Amrican hospital I have experienced. The Thai&#39;s are an unusually friendly and charming people as a homogenous group.

Primer: Not exactly trans but definitely have BD.
</p>
<p>
I was just in Bangkok over the holiday and stopped by the Preecha Aesthetic Institute to ask about a trachea shave. The staff I spoke to seemed strangely condescending and explained that the cost is just as much as it would be Stateside. It was funny that as soon as I asked about Local Anesthesia I was told it was not available for the operation at PAI and quickly pushed out the door. FYI I am not haggard or exactly poor, I just know what I am looking for from my surgeries and am price-aware. It also seems like PAI might be charging a premium due to their brand.
</p>
<p>
Highly recommend stopping by Kamol Cosmetic Hospital. They aren&#39;t great at getting back via email or via line on a timely manner, however, they have extremely professional and welcoming staff. Literally, I dropped by in person and had a consult the same day with the operating surgeon to go over techniques/recovery/misc. questions, paid ~21k Baht or $680 (a fraction of what PAI quoted of $4,500-$5000 lol), and chose to be operated on with LA the next day.

Dr. Parin (

) had great bedside manner, the staff were a mix of cis and trans people, and the clientele were also mixed.

This is so antithetical to anyones experience that I have ever spoken with or even read that I simply can&#39;t help but wonder what underlying facts we&#39;re not privy to here?

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. Burin over Dr. Sutin? Do you recommend Dr. Burin? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in Thailand? How was Dr. Burin&#39;s aftercare? Have you tried the dilators of the soul? And if you used them, is there any advantage? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

So I’m 11 weeks tomorrow and my GP who is Australia’s foremost Gender specialist has declared me healed and even she is astounded.  But your mileage may vary.
<br>
I chose Burin after talking to some other girls and some unique issues I had such as short penis due to my intersex condition.
<br>
The job he did looks great and I’m a bit over sensitive in the clitoral region.  Had my first orgasm middle of last week.  Oh baby! Buri saw me every day and if I had questions or concerns they have been addressed promptly even after returning home.  He has an amazing bedside manner and is very gentle.  I started with PAI dilators and now use Soulsense.  No discernible differences except a small bend in the soulsense.
<br>
Dr Burin is also a perfectionist and I spent 2 hours longer than expected in surgery because he wasn’t happy with his work yet.
<br>
I consider myself blessed for having had him as my surgeon and he will be the only plastic surgeon allowed to touch me going forward.

I’m actually quite happy with the work PAI did.  It was penile inversion with skin graft from my tummy.  I healed quickly and feel great

I know I’m late to this thread but were there any hidden costs? Did they raise the price when you got there at all or did the price stay the same from when you first booked them?

No hidden costs.  They quoted in writing and stuck to it.

Sutin was my surgeon and I am over the moon. I healed quickly and efficiently. I gave 5.5 inches of depth using soul sources big orange dilator and I am very orgasmic.

hi, i&#39;m seeking for a non-penile inversion vaginoplasty and a friend told me to try the PAI but their website only mentions penile inversion... is it really a penile inversion or more Suporn-like? maybe their website isn&#39;t up to date... thanks for your help

PAI only do penile inversion and colonvagioplastly. It’s not like Suporn. If you want that why not go to Suporn?
</p>
<p>
Have you looked in the wiki here?

I have looked at the wiki but a friend tells me that they do the same as Suporn or Chettawut. Suporn is too expensive for me but I&#39;ve got a lot of feedback about him...

I can&#39;t give many details but she knows the PAI well and knows a lot of girls that went there so I don&#39;t understand why she says that then...
