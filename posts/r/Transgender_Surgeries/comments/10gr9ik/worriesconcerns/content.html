Hello friends! I am considering surgery with Dr. Gabriel Del Corral, but recently I&#39;ve seen some alarming posts about his operation stealing operation pics and his original website was shutdown.
</p>
<p>
Was any of this true? Is he still reputable or should I look elsewhere?
</p>
<p>
Thanks a bunch!

I&#39;m a bit over 3 months post-vaginoplasty with him, and I am satisfied with my results and have found him to be pleasant and helpful throughout both the pre-op and post-op period. I&#39;m not doubting the allegations that FTM top surgery pics that weren&#39;t his found their way onto his website -- I&#39;d seen the pictures and the original site they came from -- but I also don&#39;t doubt his claim that he had nothing to do with them getting on his site, and as soon as he was informed, he apologized and had them taken down (the site subsequently going down may have been the result of a dispute with the person who ran the site and was responsible for the pictures being on it). More importantly, it doesn&#39;t reflect on his work and the people like me who can vouch for it.

Sure. My insurance (Kaiser Permanente of the Mid-Atlantic -- the only bottom surgeons they deal with are him and Dr. Dy at OHSU) reached out to his office for a consultation in January of 2022, and I got called for scheduling in February. I was able to reach out to the person who contacted me (Jordan, who is unfortunately not with them any more, but I&#39;ve heard his replacement is really good, too) throughout the intervening couple months without too much difficulty, usually receiving a phone call within a day or two of emailing. I had my consultation in April, and Dr. Del Corral was very friendly and accommodating. He examined me and gave me his opinion on which technique he thought would benefit me the most, but when I explained that I had been hoping for a different technique (by, uh... going vasovagal on him and nearly fainting), he immediately agreed to my wishes and explained how he was going to make it work.
</p>
<p>
At that point, I had access to the MedStar patient portal, so I was able to reach out to him and his staff through there. Admittedly, there was a SNAFU early on, where I never got a reply to a question I asked him later that day, only to find out from Jordan weeks later that he HAD replied the next day, but apparently the system never routed it to me. And if I send a new email through the system, it gets routed through the admin first, so it takes a couple days to get to him, but once I have a direct line to him, he generally replies within a couple hours (if not a couple minutes). Jumping ahead in the story a bit, I&#39;ve even had him immediately reply with asking me for my cell number, followed by him calling me a few minutes later (even on a Saturday). But, going back to April/May, I got a letter from his office that my insurance would be processed by mid-June, but during the consultation, and when talking to Jordan later, I was told that they would start the process right away. I did hope that would have meant that I would get scheduled earlier, but mid-June did mean mid-June -- however, I didn&#39;t have to wait more than a few days after the date they gave me before getting the email that my insurance had been approved and my surgery would be scheduled for October 12.
</p>
<p>
At the consultation, I was given a packet full of pre- and post-op information -- shopping list, where I needed hair removal done, dilation and douching schedule, complications, and so on. Whenever I had questions, I was able to shoot him or a member of his team an email and get an answer, and again they were willing to work with me if what they had said wouldn&#39;t be feasible for me (for example, the day-before bowel prep routine contained magnesium citrate, which was recalled a few weeks later, but rather than just telling me to find a way to get it anyway, they gave me an alternate routine). I was only able to do eight laser treatments and nine hours of electrolysis, but he assured me (despite conflicting information) that he would perform follicle scraping and that what I had done would be enough (and three months in I haven&#39;t noticed any evidence of internal hair regrowth). He was even willing to discuss aesthetics with me, thanking me for sending him pictures of other post-op work (one his, but the other two not) that illustrated what I did or didn&#39;t want -- albeit cautioning me that he couldn&#39;t guarantee that my results would be exactly the same.
</p>
<p>
October 12 rolled around, and my mother (my post-op caretaker) and I arrived at MedStar Health Franklin Square at an annoyingly early hour. Intake was quick and the staff was very nice, and well before the appointed hour we were in a pre-op room, where Dr. Del Corral was among my visitors. He didnâ€™t stay long and we didn&#39;t discuss much of substance, but he did want to check in with me and see that I was doing well. I was then wheeled to the operating room (made to walk from the gurney to the table, as was apparently the hospital&#39;s policy for that kind of surgery), and a few minutes later I was under. Three-ish hours later, and I woke up in the recovery room. Once they were sure I wasn&#39;t going to have an anesthesia-based reaction, they wheeled me through a winding series of hallways and elevators to my private hospital room.
</p>
<p>
I spent seven days in that room, and all of the nurses and techs I saw during that period were nice, helpful, and gender-affirming. The longest I ever had to wait for one of them to come when I rang was maybe 15 minutes, and they responded over the com before then that they were running behind (and it only happened the once). They brought me anything I needed, and were especially kind when it came to dealing with the bedpan and, later, douching. The food was... fine -- a few really good items, some decent, some bland, but not awful. The food service staff unfortunately did misgender me a few times, but whatever. The cleaning staff, though, was also really nice, and especially made me feel good on the day I was discharged. I didn&#39;t end up seeing Dr. Del Corral during that period -- I was one of three vaginoplasty patients all admitted at the same time -- but I had daily visits from his staff, and they helped me with adjusting my medication intake (prescribing me gas medication when I started having problems with my bowels, making sure I got my normal prescriptions, etc.) and with understanding the things I would be doing once the dressings came off.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of the dressings, I had an issue the first night, where my catheter wasn&#39;t fully in, so the nurses had to loosen the seal on the dressings to fix it, unfortunately resulting in the vacuum drain ceasing to work efficiently, and I did end up with the area above my clitoris not healing as fast due to the clotted blood because of it. However, that (and my bowels, from a combination of the bowel prep and my pre-hospitalization diet) was my only issue the entire time, and my pain levels were so low that I was able to refuse opiates the entire time. I was walking around the room by day 3, and the he dressings came off entirely on day 5, at which point I had my first dilation (got the blue Soul Source in past the last dot, although I then promptly swelled up and have been slowly working my way back to that depth since), but also had my one moment of actual pain when they took the catheter and drains out beforehand.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, I was discharged on day 7, and made the somewhat uncomfortable car ride an hour home. I went back a bit over a week later for my first post-op, and then had post-ops every 2-4 weeks after. I again didn&#39;t see Dr. Del Corral himself until my most recent one, but, as I said, I spoke to him on the phone several times, as well as keeping in touch via email. I developed a bit of dehiscence below the canal, and, in addition to telling me how to treat it, he went out of his way to ensure that I understood that everything would be okay and to not worry. When I went back for this last post-op, he was as understanding as always about how my work was going to interfere with the treatment regimen that he had given me, and he both worked with me to come up with something I could do while dealing with work and offered to sign off on as much extra time as I needed to recover (he offered an extra month, but I couldn&#39;t justify it with having already been off for three and this being my work&#39;s busiest time). And he&#39;s having me come back again in about a month to check on how it&#39;s working out for me.
</p>
<p>
That about covers it, absent the details of my at-home recovery.

How the wait was, emotionally? Kind of rough, but part of that was the busy season at work I mentioned, and part of it was the fact I had just adjusted my estrogen and gotten it up to a respectable level... and then suffered from PMS-like symptoms. The worst was the period between January and April, because so much was up in the air and I just wanted to know that I was definitely going to have the surgery. Things got better once I had the date in June, but then there was the sense of chafing against being forced to continue dragging around the stupid thing between my legs... I didn&#39;t truly feel bottom dysphoria until those last few months. (If you literally meant how long I waited, it was 11 months between reaching out to my insurance and having the surgery.)
</p>
<p>
I had started getting laser in July of 2021, because I knew I wanted bottom surgery, even if nothing was scheduled yet. I did the eight sessions I mentioned: the first six were via a Groupon discount, where I had them do a full Brazilian-style treatment; and the other two were paid out-of-pocket and limited to the areas highlighted in the surgery packet (i.e., the base of the shaft, the scrotum, and the middle two-thirds of the perineum). I didn&#39;t start electrolysis until after the consultation, despite having been visiting an electrologist for my face for just as long as the laser. The woman who owns the clinic was reluctant to do below-the-belt anyway (too painful for her clients, a history of sleaze-ball cis male clients), and she was hearing conflicting information on whether it was necessary for the surgery, so she wanted confirmation that Dr. Del Corral required it before she would give the go-ahead. Even with that, I could have gotten more sessions in, but I had forgotten to ask my laser tech how long I needed to wait between sessions for electrolysis, so I only ended up getting one electrolysis session in between April and June, when I could have gotten three. I paid for electrolysis out-of-pocket as well, because my specific Kaiser plan doesn&#39;t cover hair removal.
</p>
<p>
If I had been more discrete with my laser, I&#39;d have more, but, yeah, I&#39;ve got pubes on it mound, along the scars, and on the outer parts of the labia majora. I&#39;m debating getting my hair removal done a bit down the road to have the latter hair removed, but since I don&#39;t have time right now anyway, I&#39;m waiting to see how much more it grows back. Unsurprisingly, by the way, he shaved the entire area for the surgery, even if he wasn&#39;t working everywhere there, since there was a lot of medical tape around the dressings.
</p>
<p>
I THINK I have the potential for 6 inches, but, as I said, I haven&#39;t been able to get back to the depth I hit that very first time and I never actually asked what my intended depth was. Currently, I get to the fifth dot on all of the Soul Source dilators, which I think is 5.5&#34;?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had a few minor orgasms from doing stuff like applying gentle pressure to the mons pubis while rubbing the labia, or very gentle play with the clitoris, but because the latter isn&#39;t fully healed, I haven&#39;t really wanted to go at it. I&#39;ve tried canal masturbation with fingers, dildo, or vibrator, but those sessions were ones where I wasn&#39;t really setting up a good mood for myself, so I&#39;m not surprised I didn&#39;t orgasm. Still felt nice, though. I haven&#39;t had sex yet, lacking both a partner and time to get out and find one.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t posted anything publicly yet because I&#39;m reluctant to do so with the clitoris and the dehiscence below the vaginal opening not being fully healed, but I took weekly progress pictures up until my most recent post-op over on the MedStar trans surgeries Discord. I can PM you an invite link.
