The outer labia do seem to be healing well, congrats! I can&#39;t really tell from the pic, but do you have a defined clitoris and/or labia minora, and can you feel them well yet? (Although it&#39;s only been a month so you probably still have some sensation to regain) I wish you a speedy recovery!

I can definitely feel my clitoris, it&#39;s the most sensitive part down there, and it&#39;s visible (though it&#39;s a little shy lol) if you pull the hood back. Labia minora not so much... I can&#39;t say for sure, but I would chalk it up to my size pre-op (and possibly also being circumcised). I have fairly decent depth (13 cm/5.1 in at my last exam), so I&#39;m definitely not complaining even if it means my labia minora aren&#39;t as prominent.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the well wishes!

I&#39;m actually a month and a week post-op, haha. I have a pic I took just over a week post-op on my profile if you want to see how I looked then.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Ferrando and her staff have been incredible to me every time I&#39;ve seen them. I&#39;ll definitely keep going down the healing road!

Everything looks good.  I had my surgery May 10 th.  So about the same time frame.  Are you back at work?  I agree the human body is amazing.  I looked with a mirror yesterday and cried tears of joy and happiness.  Still wearing a pad until healing is complete and discharge lessens.  Not much bleeding anymore. Charlie

Thanks Charlie!
</p>
<p>
Technically I can start work this week, but outside circumstances (unemployment, moving into a new house, etc.) mean I probably won&#39;t be going to work for another month or so. Never say never thoughðŸ¤ž
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also at the point where I still have discharge, but the bleeding has mostly stopped. I still wear pads, but I don&#39;t go through them as quickly. I&#39;ve even been thinking of calling my surgeon&#39;s office to ask if I can start wearing panty liners instead.
</p>
<p>
The human body truly is amazing! The way I&#39;ve healed, even when compared to pics I took at the beginning of the month, is truly wild. Plus, I had my first post-op exam last week, and the nurse told me that the sensitive areas around my vulva are the body of my clit... it&#39;s crazy to think about but it&#39;s absolutely remarkable!
</p>
<p>
I was talking with another post-op friend I made recently and I told her I already knew bottom surgery was the right choice for me because looking at my vag gives me so much gender euphoria, lol. And she agrees ðŸ˜…
