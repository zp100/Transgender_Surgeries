Hi friends! I have my vaginoplasty scheduled for May 4th, 2023 with Dr. K. Ashley Brandt in Reading, PA. So far my process leading up to this point has been super easy &amp; streamline. Her and her team of medical staff are incredibly talented as far as I can tell. I was able to get a peek into her surgical team&#39;s world when I had a friend recently go to her for his bilateral mastectomy, and I remain in awe at their level of professionalism.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to open the chat here for any questions about the process as well as a starting point for future documentation as surgery / recovery progresses.
</p>
<p>
So far this is how the process has gone:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
11/08/2022
</em>
</strong>
was my first appointment with Dr. Brandt. She sat down with me and presented me with a thorough PowerPoint explaining the process of vaginoplasty, photos of procedures she has completed, potential complications and problems that could arise out of surgery, statistics of post-operative orgasms / sensation, and so on. I went in with a list of questions that were all answered before the PowerPoint was over, and knew almost instantly that she was the gal for me. At the end of the appointment, she asked if I wanted to proceed with taking the steps toward surgery, I told her yes, and she advised I start laser hair removal almost immediately, which I did. She wanted to follow up in 3+ months which gave me time to get about three laser sessions in before seeing her next.
</p>
<p>
<strong>

</strong>
was my follow up. It was relatively short and sweet. She did a physical examination of my &#34;plumbing&#34; to make sure things were in good shape to operate. She checked the status of my laser hair removal and went through a pre-op packet with me as well as some quick post-op facts. She told me to take a look through the packet from the time of this appointment up to my surgery date. She also told me that we would set up a time about a week or two before surgery to go over the packet again to make sure all the boxes were checked. When I say this packet has everything, I mean everything! What to eat, what not to eat, how to prep, what to buy, where to buy it, advice on proper healing methods, etc. It was all very clearly laid out for me. I had no further questions at this point so she said once we have a good surgery date picked out, then she&#39;d message me!
</p>
<p>
<strong>

</strong>
was when Dr. Brandt reached out for me for a surgery date. She suggested 05/04/2023 and I immediately accepted! Her nurse coordinator (Teena Lee a.k.a Superwoman in the flesh) reached out to me and scheduled the pre-op telehealth visit for a week and three days before surgery. She also informed me of an automated call I would receive the day before surgery to let me know when I could arrive at the hospital.
</p>
<p>
So far, that&#39;s how it&#39;s been! Feel free to ask any questions or give any comments you&#39;d like to share! I&#39;m super excited to share the progress of my surgery and recovery.

Thank you for sharing!    Ashley may be an option for me as well.   Is there a website that shows any of her work/ results?    Did she mention who she trained under?

I believe she did her fellowship with Kathy Rumer! Not necessarily “under” her but at the same hospital as her. I know that Ashley and her team don’t have great feelings about Kathy and her bedside manner and I would agree. Im an MA at a doctors that specializes in trans care and I hear Kathy Rumer nightmares almost weekly. I don’t think she has her results posted online as a way to respect her patients privacy. She showed me a plethora of results in our consult and I was blown away.

She definitely did but I forget. I’d say based off my results it looks like she has the experience of thousands but I think maybe around 30-60 if I had to guess?

Hi, did you do this with insurance or out of pocket?
