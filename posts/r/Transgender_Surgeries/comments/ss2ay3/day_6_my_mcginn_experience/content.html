Hey y&#39;all! I had GRS with Dr. Christine McGinn Feb 8 and I&#39;ve been recovering since. It has been a wild recovery,  but everything is going so well. My pain levels are moderate but under control and I already have internally remapped everything in my head. Its pretty incredible how easy that part has been.
</p>
<p>
I will absolutely, 100% plug her bed and breakfast, the Gaia house, Bill has been incredible, at providing a wonderful space to recover and its nice to have wonderful breakfasts in the morning to raise my morale.
</p>
<p>
The check in process at Capital Health was easy, but the wait is very long. I DEFINITELY suggest bringing a 10 foot cell phone chord, that thing saved me.
</p>
<p>
They give you a morphine pump which helps a lot and the nurses were wonderful to me. The experience of waking up and knowing that it was done was just life changing. After that, you&#39;re in the hospital for like 4 days and you get discharged to near where McGinn&#39;s office operates.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow I get to actually unwrap her so I&#39;m excited to see how that goes. But I just wanted to say from a logistics standpoint, McGinn has been top notch and my recovery is super well handled. I only had to use the emergency line once for something minor and it was well corrected.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s truly world class in many ways. Super happy with my decision.

It was nothing bad, just something I wanted to see was abnormal or not that turned out to be normal ❤️

Congratulations, Erin!  I, too, highly recommend Gaia House.  Bill&#39;s breakfasts are great. I absolutely loved his French toast on Sundays! New Hope is such a cute little town, and it is so pretty down by the river.
</p>
<p>
I went to Dr. McGinn while she still used Lower Bucks hospital, but I did help get a friend out of the Capital Health hospital and the facility seemed very clean and modern. Dr. McGinn&#39;s office staff was great, too. Very friendly and helpful.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, congratulations again. I wish you a speedy recovery!
