I had penile inversion bottom surgery with Dr Hart on the 26th of October this year and so far I&#39;m super happy with almost everything.
</p>
<p>
The Nurses at the hospital were amazing and Dr Hart himself was very professional, kind and knowledgeable. I really liked the amount of times he checked in with me despite seeming super busy and he even made time to come check in on concern I had.
</p>
<p>
I am happy with my external appearance, it looks like a vagina enough for me, they are all different and this one is mine. And I&#39;m happy with how things are functioning right now and I&#39;m excited to see how things feel when I can start touching stuff.
</p>
<p>
My main concern at the moment is my lack of depth, when we did the first dilating session Dr Hart told me that he was only able to get about 12cm when he measured in theatre and that he had difficulty constructing the canal due to how strong my pelvic floor was and how difficult it was to cut through it. (Apparently it can be like a bicep muscle if you are strong enough). And when we did the dilating session I was only able to insert about 6cm of the number 4 dilator.
</p>
<p>
According to Dr Hart all the digging he did to to get through my pelvic floor allowed me to start on the largest dilator he provides so I&#39;m happy with my width. He did mention that the swelling of everything maybe decreasing my depth aswell.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to now and I&#39;m still using the number 4 dilator but my depth hasn&#39;t really increased that much, so I&#39;m going to try and apply some pressure to hope I can get more. It&#39;s a bit disheartening having so little depth at the moment, but hopefully I can get more.
</p>
<p>
I would definitely recommend Dr Hart if you are in Australia and want to stay in Australia for surgery, from what I have heard he is the only one operating here aswell. But he and his team are lovely and I have nothing but praise for the hospital staff.

I&#39;m also in Aus, if you don&#39;t mind sharing what was the process to speak to Dr Hart, the reason I subbed to this thread was to obviously see what the realistic results were but to also hopefully get some more information on what&#39;s available over here as far as SRS is concerned because thus far my experience is apparently access to just finding out about how to start the process is a national secret lol.

It was pretty easy to start the process, I got a referral from my doctor who sent it to Dr Harts office, though i will say my doctor specialises in trans patients and I believe has a professional relationship with Dr Hart, as he knows her and what she does.
</p>
<p>
They then called me about making a consultation appointment which was $250 partially subsidised by Medicare. There was a wait period of about 2 months for that.
</p>
<p>
The consultation was about an hour where what type of surgery I wanted was discussed and where I could ask questions. At the end of the appointment we made a surgery date. I got pretty lucky with putting my referral in January, consultation in March and surgery in October.
</p>
<p>
Dr Hart was available for me to email after I did the surgery booking, so I could ask questions as they came up.

That&#39;s awesome, unfortunately I&#39;m in tassie so we don&#39;t have specialists over here for gender affirming care but a few GPs have taken it upon themselves to start seeing those specifically in the community &amp; I&#39;ve been lucky to find just such a GP but there seems to be a bit of a communication breakdown between surgical options &amp; the doctors over this way so it&#39;s definitely something I will have a chat to my GP about when she gets back from holiday. 1 last question if it&#39;s not too personal how long were you on HRT prior to surgery? Just wondering as I&#39;m only about 6 months in, I&#39;m only asking at such an early point because when I have asked in general conversation no one seems to have a clue haha.

Thanks a bunch for your info, like I said with the scarcity of the info I wasn&#39;t going to pass up the opportunity to find out about a local surgeon.
