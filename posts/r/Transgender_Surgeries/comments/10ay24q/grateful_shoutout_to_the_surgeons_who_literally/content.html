<p>
I want to express my gratitude and cheerlead for Drs. Laura Douglass (urology) and Drs. Alireza Hamidian Jahromi (plastic surgery) of Temple University Hospital, the surgeons who literally changed my life, or at least the way I embody it. They are the most incredible and kindest doctors I could have ever put my trust in, and I truly believe it has ‚Äúpaid off,‚Äù so to speak.
</p>
<p>
I went with them and Temple due mostly to proximity, because we live close to Philadelphia, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt afford to travel and stay close by for a while to another hospital too far away. In doing so, I knew I sacrificed access to some of the bigger names and best surgeons that a lot of trans women go with and wait for, and took a big risk on lesser-knowns. I‚Äôve looked around this subreddit and seen only a very small few posts about them (it was actually this very subreddit that made me aware of them!). But I am so glad I did for a lot of reasons beyond just location.
</p>
<p>
What I love about their surgical team is just that: Hamidian and Douglass are a
<em>
team.
</em>
Douglass offers the urological expertise and Hamidian provides the plastic surgical. Their strengths complement each other‚Äôs for a better result both internally and externally. So while my vagina is still too swollen and bruised for me to feel comfortable sharing any photos yet, I can already see the excellent job they did and sense that it will eventually look really great. Not to mention how readily available they are for any concerns you may have after the fact throughout the healing process. I am just one week post-op and I already got off the phone with Dr. Douglass this morning about a question I had. Throughout the surgery, hospital stay, and now beginning at-home recovery, I know the risk I took on proximity and location was worth it and I absolutely made the right choice.
</p>
<p>
The gender affirming care unit that Drs. Douglass and Hamidian are working to establish at Temple is still relatively new, so there aren‚Äôt many testimonies out there vouching for their work yet. But I‚Äôll offer mine here: I have not one regret about my decision to go with Temple University Hospital‚Äôs gender affirming care unit for my gender confirmation surgery, from the doctors and their surgical team to the nurses. I could never be grateful enough for this experience and everything I‚Äôll get to experience after because of them.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has any questions about any of this, then feel free to ask, and I‚Äôll do my best to get back to you!

First, congratulations! I also had surgery at Temple and my experience was the same. The quality of care and results were outstanding.

Thank you; I&#39;m so glad my post was helpful. While you&#39;re recovering I&#39;ll give you an update on me and while ymmv my recovery exceeded my expectations. I never had any pain, just discomfort from the stitches. I had full mobility in weeks. And while I don&#39;t remember exactly, orgasm in 5 or 6 months and the unexpected discovery that I self lubricate. It doesn&#39;t get any better!

I am a couple of months away from my consultation with the Drs at Temple! I&#39;m so so so glad to hear such good things! I live in Pittsburgh for another year and a half, so it is one of the closest surgical teams to me.

I&#39;m glad you had a great experience! I am also from the Philadelphia region (in fact, I go to Temple university, lol), and I was looking to get bottom surgery by Douglass as well; I am currently on a wait-list. I&#39;d definitely want to see pictures if you don&#39;t  mind ‚Äî that is, when or if you feel comfortable.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s also another surgeon in Pennsylvania that I may go to, to get a vaginoplasty at Main Line Health. I&#39;m getting BA and FFS from her as well, which thankfully my insurance is covering.

Hi can you please keep us updated and would love to see pics either publicly or if ur ok sending privately. I am highly highly considering them (already had the consult and everything) but I&#39;m just having a really hard time deciding. My plan it to decide in the nexr month and a half or so, and it&#39;s not an easy decision.

Hey there, yeah I definitely plan to share updates! Publicly or privately, I‚Äôm just not yet comfortable sharing any kinds of pics yet because everything still looks too swollen and bruised and stitched up for my comfort level. I see the shape of things to come, so to speak, and it‚Äôs a good one! But just feel too vulnerable showing it yet.
</p>
<p>
As for considering them, I can say I know there are plenty of great surgeons out there and I hope you find the right fit, but I do want to double down on how professional and knowledgeable and talented and compassionate both Drs. Douglass and Hamidian are. I hope you‚Äôll keep considering them!

Yes I&#39;m highly considering them. It&#39;s only to the point u made about not having a ton about them yet online. I live right outside of the city so of course logistically it&#39;s a no brainer and they both seem extremely warm and nice. It&#39;s not an easy decision to say the least.
