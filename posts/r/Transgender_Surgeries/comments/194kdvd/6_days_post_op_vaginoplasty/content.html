Everything hurts, and everything is swollen,  but every day I wake up with a vagina is a great day. Postop day 8.

Well said. I told myself although the first few days in the hospital were rough, I’d do it all over again. Congratulations on your surgery. Wishing you the best ☺️

If you don’t mind me asking - why did it have to be changed last minute and how did you consent to that?

We planned to use the peritoneal flap for the end of the neovaginal canal, but after they inserted different sized dilators to make sure the tension was fine, the tension ended up being too tight, and it was tearing the flap away from the peritoneum. So my surgeron decided instead of stopping there and leaving me with a very short canal, I had extra skin graft left over from the scrotum that he was able to use for the remaining. So basically I received a standard penile inversion technique.
</p>
<p>
As for the consent, I’m honestly not sure if the consent I signed also covered the standard technique. But in happy with my surgeons choice to not leave me with a short canal. Rather have a near to normal depth than minimal. And because he used the skin graft, I was told if a complication arises PPT is still possible for me in the future. Just need to plan a different approach to getting the flap I guess
