Including flights, accommodation, food etc.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m from the UK and currently in the process of saving like mad, and whilst able to save at a pretty good rate (around Â£1,100 a month) it feels agonisingly slow.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m planning on having SRS with Dr Bank - so the surgery for that is going to be what? Â£12,000? So with flights, accommodation and other expenses does Â£15-Â£16,000 to cover everything sound about right?
</p>
<p>
As for FFS, I was considering Facial Team. Through what I&#39;ve found online I&#39;d be expecting to pay Â£20-30,000 for the surgical stuff alone - however do their prices include flights and accommodation? More recently I&#39;ve been considering the top US surgeons, so you&#39;re talking what, Â£40,000ish for surgery alone? So perhaps another Â£5000 for expenses?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just trying to figure out what ungodly sum of money I need to save tbh lol
<em>

. Would you say around Â£60,000 for SRS and FFS with the top surgeons, all expenses included sounds about right?
</p>
<p>
Then after all this is done, I can save for a house like a normal person...Fuck isn&#39;t being trans great? ðŸ˜–

I&#39;m going for Dr. Bank later this year. So far it&#39;s been 12k pounds for the surgery, I haven&#39;t purchased the tickets yet, but they seem to be around 650-700gbp and I don&#39;t know about the hotel yet, but expect at least a thousand-ish. And you need some room for extra stuff like pads, wipes, extra dilators, tons of lube

Ooh good luck ðŸ˜Š. How long are you intending on staying, is it typical to be there for around a month?

Thanks! They recommend staying for a month, and I&#39;ll be there for around 26-27 days.

Yeah, your numbers for Dr. Bank sound about right. I&#39;ve been budgeting about $21,000 USD (or Â£16,000) for SRS with him this summer. The surgery itself is currently Â£12,600 until June. It will increase to Â£13,200 in July 2019, and then to Â£13,600 in January 2020. They seem to increase the price around Â£400-600 every 6 months.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t looked into FFS with the Facial Team, so I can&#39;t confirm those numbers.
</p>
<p>
Edit: spelling

Thanks :) - I&#39;m still not ready for SRS, even though I do just about have enough saved (I&#39;ve got Â£13,000 atm). Plus I honestly want to have enough for both procedures before getting one, just in case I were to for whatever reason lose my job after SRS (I really don&#39;t know how my boss will like the idea of me being off for potentially months).
</p>
<p>
Have you looked into any of the US surgeons for FFS?

You&#39;re welcome! Yeah, that seems like a good plan. Hope for the best, and prepare for the worst is a sound strategy, I think.  No, I haven&#39;t looked into FFS. Just not something I&#39;m interested in.

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s right for me. I don&#39;t have very bad dysphoria and there&#39;s a small part of me that worries I&#39;ll regret it.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;d choose to be cis female in a heartbeat if I could, so maybe it&#39;s other things putting me off, like the fact that it&#39;s a surgery and I&#39;d have to make a conscious decision for a very final and practically irreversible procedure.

I get that. I don&#39;t have it too bad either and I worry about everything.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand I want it and I worry I&#39;ll get to the end of my life and regret not living fully. I&#39;ve wasted enough of my life as it is. It&#39;s truly difficult.

Ugh, yeah I feel like that too haha. I&#39;m defo leaning more towards having it done, like 80-90% sure. It&#39;s just a huge decision and I&#39;m unfortunately really quite indecisive.

The way the Suporn Clinic books dates makes it kinda hard to say how long the waitlist is. They don&#39;t keep a waitlist on their end. Instead, they publish an online calendar of all scheduled surgeries and open dates (
<a href="http://www.supornclinic.com/clients/calendar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.supornclinic.com/clients/calendar.htm
</a>
). The first person to email them requesting to reserve an open date will get it. At the moment, they only have dates listed going until January 2020. And they&#39;re pretty consistently booked solid. (There are currently 4 openings for the rest of 2019). But, if you watch the calendar page for updates, I think there&#39;s pretty good chance you can get a date that opens up due to a cancellation or rescheduling.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: No real waitlist, but they&#39;re (mostly) booked for the next ~10 months. Watch for openings and you can probably get in sooner.

Thanks. Do you think it&#39;s possible to schedule further out, like 18 months? I&#39;m not ready to book anything now but might want to reserve something for later.

You&#39;re welcome!
</p>
<p>
No, they only book surgeries for the dates that are on the calendar online. They just opened January 2020 for scheduling yesterday, and that&#39;s the first time they&#39;ve added new dates in the past several months, I think. So, my speculation is that they&#39;ll be adding more of 2020 pretty soon, but there&#39;s really no way of knowing. Since they haven&#39;t added new dates in a while, I would also bet that any new dates will fill up very fast, so I&#39;d keep an eye on the calendar or use an online tool to watch for updates.
