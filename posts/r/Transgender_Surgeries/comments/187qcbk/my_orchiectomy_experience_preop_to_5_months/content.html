Do you recommend a particular type of underwear to wear during recovery? I&#39;m not sure if I should wear something that compresses and supports me a bit or go for super loose fitting everything to avoid any contact/irritation.

I just wore standard bikini cut panties and sweatpants, would 100% recommend bringing pads and using one as for me they didn&#39;t bandage or anything so it probably would have ruined my underwear with blood stains if I didn&#39;t use a pad.

When you wake up after surgery you might find that you&#39;re wearing a gauze material in the shape of boy shorts. They are snug but also stretchy and breathable. I found these to be ideal for the healing process because they hold everything in place without too much movement while also allowing the wound to breath, which will prevent complications and promote healing.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck with your surgery üòä

How is ‚Äútucking‚Äù is it pretty much the same minus having‚Ä¶ you kno what? Does the genital region lay more flat than before? That is if you do tuck.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been considering this as an option prior to going through with srs.

Honestly for me it isn&#39;t all that much different, I still have to use tucking underwear if I wear leggings or something tight, don&#39;t have to fidget with my bits as much so putting the tuck in position is a tiny bit quicker.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not flatter now when tucking, though admittedly I&#39;ve always been pretty good at getting a tight, flat tuck.
</p>
<p>
I can be tucked for longer now before it starts to become uncomfortable, and I don&#39;t bother tucking under dresses or loose skirts anymore, I used to pre-op but now with legging safety shorts it seems to compress everything enough there isn&#39;t a visible bulge, pencil skirts or tight dresses I still tuck though.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still planning on getting GRS, but the orchi was definitely worth it while I have to wait for that.

June 23:
</p>
<p>
Five days, thirteen hours away from my orchiectomy. The hospital called me on Monday just confirming all my medications and whatnot, all good to go! Won‚Äôt have my actual surgery time until the day before, [REDACTED] got her times today since hers is on Monday, check-in at 11:30am and surgery at 1pm, the hospital told me from arriving to leaving is typically ~4 hours. I‚Äôm literally counting the hours, I‚Äôm so excited!
</p>
<p>
July 2:
</p>
<p>
3 days after my orchiectomy, I am so happy, such an overwhelming sense of relief and comfort even though there&#39;s a bit of pain (obviously) from the surgery. But I am so happy and haven&#39;t for a second regretted my decision. I&#39;m going to write a brief overview of my experience from arriving at the hospital to leaving, since after the surgery was a little hazy I don&#39;t want to forget it in the years to come;
<br>
When I arrived at the hospital with my partner we went to the main admitting desk and got checked in, and was directed to the second floor day surgery unit, there they checked us into a room, and asked me to change into a surgical gown, hair cap, and little booties (made of the same material as the hair cap) the gown was actually pretty cozy, and they gave me a blanket to wrap up in. Shortly after that a nurse came in and asked me a bunch of standard questions, like medications I&#39;m on, if I&#39;m a smoker, drinker, allergies, confirmed the surgery I was having, standard stuff. Then she misgendered me but immediately corrected herself, went to put an IV in my arm, missed the vein the first time (Which I never had happen before, I have quite prominent veins), but got it the second try, and hooked me up to a saline bag with some antibiotics. Then my partner and I were just in the room for about half an hour before the nurse came back and said okay ready to take me down to the operating room on the main floor. I kissed my partner and said I‚Äôd see them soon. The nurse wheeled the bed I was on down the elevator to the main floor, asked me to get out of the bed with the blanket and sit on a chair where I would meet with another nurse, the anesthesiologist, and the surgeon, they all asked the same standard questions as the first nurse did, asked if I had any questions, asked if I had any piercings, and gave me some tape to put over top of them (my septum, upper &amp; lower lobes, and industrial. my tongue I took out before) and then said to just wait a moment before they would be ready for me.
<br>
They came back and said let&#39;s go, we walked into the operating room, there was a smaller bed in the middle of the room, with 2 diagonal pads for my arms, huge lighting apparatuses above the bed, the 4 people in the room, 2 nurses, the anesthesiologist, and the surgeon. They were all really friendly, first the anesthesiologist said they take music requests, and I said play some Ghost (yes, for real), Mary on a Cross was the first song that played, I was a bit nervous after I asked for that because if one of them is religious or something I didn‚Äôt mean to offend anyone pre-surgery, but it seemed fine. They started just making small talk, they were all dog people so we ended up talking about our dogs for a few minutes, then the anesthesiologist said he was going to inject me with some &#34;happy drugs&#34;, I was feeling a bit anxious at this point, laying on a table staring at the bright white halogen lights, but pretty quickly I started to relax. They attached a blood pressure monitor to my one arm and a heart rate monitor to my other, and strapped my arms to the diagonal pads, the whole time they were explaining what they were doing to me and I felt safe, next the anesthesiologist said they were almost ready for the next injection, and they would put an oxygen mask over my face and I would start to feel sleepy, after the mask was on the nurse with it said I could close my eyes if I wanted, I kind of did but opened them once in awhile, the anesthesiologist said, &#34;okay, now take three deep breaths&#39;&#39;. I remember taking the first in, then out, and saying, &#34;I hope you enjoy Ghost&#39; then breathing in again, and that was it.
<br>
Next thing I remember I slowly woke up in the recovery area, they had heavy warm blankets laid on my chest, my arms were draped over my chest as well and I felt very comfortable, the room was dimly lit, and there was a nurse sitting beside my bed on a computer. I noticed my hair cap, booties, and piercing tape had all been removed, the back of my mouth was a tiny bit sore, but that was it, I immediately felt a sense of relief and happiness. The nurse asked how I was feeling, and I said *amazing*, asked if I had any pain, and I said, &#34;none yet!&#34; She said excellent, said something like, &#34;let&#39;s get you back to your room&#34; and I remember asking &#34;the one where my partner is?&#34;, She confirmed yes it was.
<br>
As she wheeled the bed around the corner and I saw my partner I shouted, &#34;sweet potato!&#34; And was so happy to see them, the nurse left us in the room for awhile and I got to give my partner a kiss and we just chatted briefly, a different nurse came back to the room shortly and asked the same general questions, if I had any pain and I still didn&#39;t, then said she had to look at the incision to see if there was any bleeding, just lifted my cozy blankets for 5 seconds and said all was good and then left us for awhile. Maybe 20-25 minutes later she came back, unhooked my IV from the drip, and said&#34; okay, if you can use the washroom you can get dressed and go home&#34;, I fairly easily sat up from the bed and started walking towards the bathroom, the nurse was like, &#34;oh wow, slow down&#34; so I&#39;m not sure if she was expecting me to be more out of it or what, but I felt pretty normal and back to myself at this point. I peed fairly easily and looked at the incision for the first time myself, I was so happy. I got up from the bathroom, took my gown off and started getting dressed, they didn&#39;t put any bandages on me or anything, so I put a period pad in my underwear before putting them on, finished getting dressed, and sat down in a chair with my partner, a different nurse came back and asked if everything was okay, I said yes, he gave me a prescription for painkillers and a 6 page aftercare booklet, asked if I had any questions, took my IV out, and sent us on our way home.
</p>
<p>
It was 4 hours from arriving at the hospital to leaving the hospital, my partner said it was about an hour and a half from the time they took me from the room to being back at the room, so I think I was only unconscious for between 30-45 minutes.
<br>
The day of surgery and the following day I would say it hurt pretty much the same amount as my vasectomy did, maybe a little bit more. Just the incision was tender. I took the painkillers the first day, and didn&#39;t take any until after I tried to go on a little walk the day after, which was a mistake, I took one more after the walk, but I haven&#39;t taken any more of them since.
<br>
On the second day I had a lot of really weird puffyness on the sides of my penis, there was more bruising showing up on the underside of the penis, and the inaugural canals started to get a bit sore. (See my photo album for reference photos, I took some pictures every day.)
<br>
It&#39;s the third day now, and the puffyness is gone, the incision is a bit tender, but the inaugural canals are very, very, tender. You know the area they go when you tuck, and you can kind of see where the testicles would puff out of your skin up above the sides of your gock? Right there is SO sore, the lightest touch in that area is very tender.
<br>
I&#39;ve mostly been switching between laying in bed, and sitting at my computer, both positions are fine, but waddling between them and to the bathroom is quite sensitive. No more walkies for another day or two I think. Overall I am so pleased and happy, not for a second have I felt regret or anything other than relief and happiness over getting this done. 10/10 would do again.

Still feeling really good! Fully recovered from the orchi around a month after and have been doing really well since, I can still feel kind of a hard bit on my inaugural canals where  I think the spermatic cord was cut, but no pain or anything and tucking has been much easier. Still waiting on GRS.I have my yearly checkup with [REDACTED] on September 11th but I don‚Äôt think anything is going to change as my levels still look good, it isn‚Äôt surprising my levels didn‚Äôt change after surgery as I had peritubular fibrosis and extreme atrophy for both testicles reported on the surgery pathology report.

Well it has been 5 months today since the orchiectomy and I‚Äôm still incredibly happy with it. Not a single regret, 10/10 would do again. The incision has long completely healed and I don‚Äôt feel anything on the inside behind it or anything, zero pain. Still no issues getting erections - truthfully if anything it‚Äôs easier to get them now, probably because I have a bit less bottom dysphoria overall, but I do still plan to get GRS, this was a good thing to be able to get in the meantime since I‚Äôm still on a multi-year waiting list for that, unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
But to end on a happy note! Not having cis genitals has been a pretty huge relief for me, a good step in the right direction for my transition so far. I have even better orgasms now than I did before, both from using my gock and from anal, much less bottom dysphoria, knowing my body won‚Äôt ever produce T again (Even though the pathology report said peritubular fibrosis and extreme atrophy so I probably wouldn‚Äôt of had to worry), knowing that without a doubt is wonderful and I couldn‚Äôt be happier about it.

All bodies naturally produce testosterone from the adrenal glands as well as some other tissue. You actually don&#39;t want to be completely lacking testosterone, that&#39;s not healthy for anyone!

They didn&#39;t change at all! Lol the fibrosis and atrophy in my testicles after being on HRT for 2.5 years basically shut them off for good long before they were removed I think. üòÖ

Oh I&#39;ve never taken an AA, my T was always suppressed from the E.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been on estradiol valerate 3mg/3.5days, &amp; 200mg of oral progesterone a day for like a year and a half or more now, and even when I was taking 6-8mg SL E pills the first year I started my transition my T was completely gone from it.

You don&#39;t need Spiro if you take an appropriate dose injected.

I had already been on HRT for more than 2 years when I got the orchi, I swear my boobs seemed a bit bigger/fuller a few weeks post-op, but my bra size is still the same, so I can&#39;t say for certain.
</p>
<p>
My E &amp; T levels didn&#39;t change at all pre vs post op.
</p>
<p>
Also, sorry I didn&#39;t respond sooner, it didn&#39;t give me a notification for your comment for some reason.

No worries. Just curious since I&#39;m planning an orchi soon, too.

Wow congratulations girlfriend I am so happy for you and thank you for sharing.  I&#39;m supposed to get my complete bottom surgery before the first of the year.  Stupid insurance is holding me up as usual.  There just waiting for the green light for me.  It&#39;s tuff not having a specific date.  I&#39;m an approval and schedule within a week deal. I was supposed to of had it before Thanksgiving but I had to cancel my beautiful Missouri insurance before doing plan B but they take 30 days to cancel and day 30 is today. Finally  I&#39;m wish you a speedy date for your final surgery. ü§ó

Great write up and documentation. Great insight for folks considering this. I really appreciated this read as I am about 16 days post op from my orchi and have a pretty good visual preview of how my healing may proceed.
</p>
<p>
Can relate to that soreness at the top of the canal area. But no real ‚Äúpain‚Äù for me either.

That pain did go away pretty quick! Though fair warning after it went away I would still

sometimes

get it for a couple hours after having an orgasm for the first few months, haven&#39;t had it since then though!

Great insight - I wondered how long it would persist and if that pain would reappear later with orgasm etc. For now it is mostly just late in the day once in a while.

Easy peasy for me, the first few days were mostly waddling between the bed and the bathroom, I will note that stairs were totally doable though moderately uncomfortable, but then I started going for walkies and after a week and a half I was cycling on my road bike again.

Yeah, I compare the orchi to the vasectomy I had years and years ago quite a lot because it wasn&#39;t much worse than that!

I mean, it definitely depends on what you do for work.
</p>
<p>
If you work in a desk job or just mostly standing or sitting and your pain tolerance is as high as mine I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be fine, but if you&#39;re doing any physical labor I&#39;d say not. Lifting anything more than 10kg for the first week caused me a bit of pain and I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to do that often.

Oh, this is great. I‚Äôm an avid cyclist. And honestly the healing times have been pretty much my only hold up at this point. I do think I want GCS at some point. But I‚Äôm more an more thinking about getting an orchi first.

Yeah don&#39;t get me wrong I didn&#39;t do any centuries or anything, at the time I just had my bike on an indoor trainer, but could do my 30-45 minute workout rides without an issue!
</p>
<p>
The 2ish weeks to mostly recovered from an orchi is definitely less than the potential months of GRS, but I do still want GRS, whenever the waiting list gods call my name üôÉ
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it&#39;s definitely been worth it IMO.

True, but IMO a trainer is a bit more uncomfortable than on the road, you can&#39;t adjust your weight or move around really as much compared to outside. More bumps and whatnot, but I&#39;d bet out on the road would have been even better.
</p>
<p>
I just didn&#39;t want to take the bike out and risk getting however many km from home, and then being too uncomfortable to ride back, which is why I used the trainer. Lol

Good luck, the actual procedure was very similar to what you described above, and wasn‚Äôt all that bad. The worst part is having a limited diet afterwards.  Also I‚Äôve been dragging my feet on planning and scheduling my orchiectomy but this post has really got me excited to get it done. Thank you for the post. üòÅ

Tbh I&#39;m not sure how accurate that link is.
</p>
<p>
To my knowledge he is the only surgeon in southern Alberta who does orchis for trans people, so if you&#39;re getting a referral, he&#39;s your only option, or at least he was for me.

Tl;dr from my summary comment:
</p>
<p>
Bring pads, apart from the stitches the hospital didn&#39;t bandage me up or anything, so I would have ruined my underwear without pads.
</p>
<p>
Take short walks to help the recovery process, don&#39;t overdo it, I felt fine and went on a bit of a longer walk only to regret it an hour later.
</p>
<p>
There might be some super weird puffy looking swelling, it&#39;s normal.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with yours!

How was the recovery for this? I gotta have a meeting with a gender therapist before they sign off on my surgery.

Amazing. Wanted to get the same op for so long always seems out of reach, how do I go about getting the op? Do you recommend a particular surgery/hospital?  They definitely did a tidy job on you and it looks super neat. I&#39;m in Europe but will travel for the op. Does Thailand do the procedure? Costs? Any advice or assistance would be much appreciated  Thank you all ‚ößÔ∏èüíû

Use it or lose it I think! And yes my scrotum just shrank by itself over time, and I feel like it&#39;s probably going to keep getting a bit smaller in the years to come before GRS.

I tried to take them as similarly as I could, I found it a bit frustrating when I was originally looking into orchi&#39;s that there wasn&#39;t anything like this post lol so I made it!

Well my understanding is that since the testes produce sperm, and the shaft becomes hard from sperm being sent there and increasing the pressure, that without that it wouldn&#39;t be able to become erect. But I may just be misinformed about that process.

You are misinformed. That&#39;s not how it works at all.
</p>
<p>
The arteries relax and open up to let more blood flow in; at the same time, the veins close up. Once blood is in the penis, pressure traps it within the corpora cavernosa. Your penis expands and holds the erection. It&#39;s literally just bloodflow.

Hello and good health to you!
</p>
<p>
Do you have a plan of action if it turns out that your testosterone level is dangerously low even for a female type? Because when there is no testosterone, the body breaks down even in women.I pre-op and worried about it that my zgt from 2021 has already completely turned off testosterone in them, the result is 0.140 mcg/l = this is approaching a dangerous level even for women.
