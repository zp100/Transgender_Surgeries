Hi! You&#39;re welcome :). Glad to help.
</p>
<p>
I chose peritoneal because of the lubrication, self-cleaning, and the freeing of more tissue for external use.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t ask about sigmoid colon but yes they do that technique too.
</p>
<p>
I have scars from a previous surgery already so I&#39;m not too bothered. I have five, all in a straight line. One was in my navel so that was cool. None of the laprascopy incisions were on my mons, actually none at all :).
</p>
<p>
The dilation routine will be 3x day for three months, then 1x a day for another three months, then 3x week for another three months, then 1x week forever. This is the standard instruction but I may get different ones depending on how my recovery goes.
</p>
<p>
I got 15cm right after surgery.
</p>
<p>
So far I highly recommend this technique. And also my surgeon! She is amazing. She is very attentive with any of my questions, she visited me three times during my hospital stay, and she is available during office hours any time after my surgery.
</p>

I worried too about taking part of my colon out so that is why I went with the peritoneal tissue. Colon issues would be not great :(
</p>
<p>
You are so welcome. Best of luck :)

Dr. Whittenberg trained him and stands by his ability to do good work. So I&#39;m trusting that. As well as a friend who got her revision from them and is happy with the results.

Thank you! Not really! I asked her a lot of stuff. All of my post op questions right now are how to deal with pain and about odd things that have come up. Just ask her everything you can think of. Get yourself sure of what will happen when you are knocked out, what will happen after, and what your options are.

Is there anything that you&#39;re really glad you asked? I&#39;m just really bad at asking good questions... even in interviews and things...

I&#39;m glad I asked if I could take marijuana for pain afterwards and &#39;m glad I asked for a cosmetic change. Both of those were great questions that have improved my experience! On the cosmetic question, I think that everyone is entitled to get the result they want even if that means asking the surgeon nicely for a tweak :).

Hi gorgeus, I have some questions about your experience with PPT (well, there are a lot of them), could you please help me? I plan to undergo this technique (or the non-inversion technique of Suporn): Did you undergo the hybrid technique (where half of the vagina is skin and the other half is peritoneal tissue) or the full technique (where the entire vaginal canal is peritoneal tissue)? What made you choose Dr. Wittenberg over other doctors? Do you recommend her? What made you choose PPT over other techniques? Do you recommend it as a technique for SRS? How do you consider your results in terms of aesthetics and sensitivity? Are you satisfied with your results? Are you planning to have a revision surgery? And if you plan to have one, What would you improve your result with one? What is your vaginal depth? How is self-lubrication? Do you douching or is there some degree of self-cleaning in your vagina? How have the dilations been?, That&#39;s all for now, and by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.

Sure! I will help :)
</p>
<p>
Penile tissue was used for the vestibule, and then peritoneal was used past that for the rest of the vagina. I am not sure if this qualifies as a hybrid.
</p>
<p>
I chose Dr. Wittenberg because at the time I found only 4 PPT surgeons available to me and she had the best availability.
</p>
<p>
I definitely recommend her :). She was luckily able to accommodate my special requests and has been enthusiastic about learning how my recovery is going.
</p>
<p>
I chose PPT due to the high similarity of peritoneal tissue to vaginal mucosal tissue. I wanted my vagina to be as close to natal as possible.
</p>
<p>
I do recommend peritoneal pull through over penile inversion. I cannot say for others as I don&#39;t have any firsthand knowledge of their results.
</p>
<p>
For aesthetics, it&#39;s amazing. Everyone who has looked at it says it looks like a natal vulva. For sensitivity, also excellent. I am able to orgasm and I have full innervation of the labia and clitoris.
</p>
<p>
I am very satisfied :D. My only disappointment is that I healed extremely quickly which caused me to lose a lot of depth.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t currently plan to have a revision surgery. I&#39;d love to get more depth back but that kind of surgery would be just as invasive as the primary surgery and I don&#39;t want that again.
</p>
<p>
My depth is currently 9cm. It started at 14cm.
</p>
<p>
Self-lubrication is plentiful. Sometimes too much, as I have a lot of discharge during the day. Not enough for intercourse, but enough for a finger to sneak in during masturbation.
</p>
<p>
I do not douche, the lubrication is enough for self-cleaning :)
</p>
<p>
The dilations have been fine. Not too painful. I am currently on the Size 1 Soulsource dilator and it is large enough for my needs.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for the congratulations and wishes ❤️

Hi cuties~
<br>
This feels really amazing. I am SO excited for my future and I already feel relieved and euphoric that my previous equipment is all gone. No more bottom dysphoria! Ask me anything about my experience so far, I will answer them if I feel comfortable to! I will post a follow-up in 1 year for questions about the long-term results.
</p>
<p>
Here are the details:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Surgeon: Dr. Heidi Wittenberg.
<a href="https://mozaiccare.net" rel="nofollow">https://mozaiccare.net
</a>
</li>
<li>
Technique: Peritoneal pull-through. The vaginal canal is made with tissue from the peritoneum, which is a thin layer of mucous membrane from the underside of the abdomen. The vulva is made with all the initial external tissue.

Pictures? Nope.
