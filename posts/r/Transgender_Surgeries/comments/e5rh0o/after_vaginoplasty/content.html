Hey guys,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve read recently from friends that it&#39;s possible to have hair growing inside the vaginal canal after a vaginoplasty, has anyone heard much about this/experienced this? I&#39;m really curious about how this effects these ladies sex lives and general comfort.

I haven&#39;t had vaginoplasty yet, or personally experienced it, but here&#39;s a copy-paste of the short description of it my surgeon gave me on a vaginoplasty info document:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Growth of hairs in the vaginal cavity
</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you suspect the presence of hair or if your doctor discovers hair during a gynecological exam, you can have the hair cauterized. Contact your family doctor.

Which surgeon is this?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve heard of anyone successfully removing deep hairs.

Dr. Brassard, the document specifically mentions that no one at GRS Montreal will actually do it, so I&#39;d have to go elsewhere to get it done.
</p>
<p>
That said, most of what I heard anecdotally suggests its pretty difficult to remove the hair, so who knows? I just know for me personally, genital laser hair removal pre-surgery is far too expensive and unpleasant to even consider. I&#39;m gonna take my chances and hope for the best!

This is a dumb move. Brassards patients usually end up with hair in disproportionate numbers compared to other surgeons.
</p>
<p>
If you are going to him, definitely consider electrolysis or laser. Its not that bad. Quite honestly it was at most a 3 out 10 pain wise for me granted i have a high pain tolerance. You can also get local anesthesia to help.

Agreed. With lidocaine injections I was literally sleeping through electrolysis in that area.

I dont think you are here in good faith given your account details and posting history.
</p>
<p>
However hair is basically never going to be inside if you follow proper guidelines for prior to surgery and go to a half decent surgeon.

Why would it not be in good faith? It was just a topic of conversation that came up between friends and I didnt want to ask them about it directly at the time. It was something I hadn&#39;t heard of prior

The fact that your accounts oldest post was 8 hours ago. And the fact that you post in terf/transphobic subreddits.
</p>
<p>
These are major red flags that you arent here in good faith. (And i havent even checked to see if theres some deleted posts in your history that spell it out even more).

Holy shit. I didn’t realize just how TERFy that sub was until going through it for a while. Good to know as a flag for the future.

This happened to a friend of mine. She did do electrolysis beforehand, but not enough. She really dislikes the hair and plucks what she can by herself.

Internally? That must be really tricky.

Must be super uncomfortable :(

Yeah, internally. Full disclosure: she’s my ex, and yes I could feel it when we had sex, but I don’t have a penis so it was just my fingers and I wasn’t bothered at all.

Ah, ok. That&#39;s interesting, thanks for that extra info. To the best of my knowledge I&#39;ve never had a girlfriend who was trans and whilst knowing this is none of my business, little questions pop up in my mind about things like that.

Out of curiosity, are you aware how much she has, and whether it&#39;s deeply internal or near the opening? (Also, who was her surgeon?)

It&#39;s my first time on this app. What are the terf groups? I&#39;ve just added a bunch of things to follow (lgbt stuff mainly). I haven&#39;t had much time on here to see any transphobic content anywhere
</p>
<p>
What exactly could be nefarious about this post? Can you explain what evil intent there could be here because I really don&#39;t get it.

Ah, I see. I just went on that group as I searched for &#39;vaginal atrophy&#39; and some results came up there. I&#39;ll unfollow detrans, it wasn&#39;t intentional.
</p>
<p>
As for the incels, I know as a community they&#39;re awful. I&#39;ve had an interest in their groups and how they interact and their terminology for awhile. I&#39;ve seen some stuff about them and I&#39;m curious.
</p>
<p>
I still dont quite understand though why I&#39;m having to justify my post history after only having being on here for a few days. Was there actually anything wrong with my post? Obviously these subjects aren&#39;t appropriate to bring up in person so it seemed like a safe choice to ask online.

Ah ok, well that&#39;s understandable. I just wasn&#39;t sure for a moment there if I had overstepped in some way by just asking the question.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m super late to the party in regards to reddit, so I&#39;m still figuring it out

Thanks for that, I was feeling bad prior to that comment there :)

Any decent surgeon consulting pre-grs should be very specific about where you&#39;ll need to have electrolysis. It needs to be thorough, and best practice would be to have it handled over several months to make sure you can catch different growth waves from every follicle.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve already sat for about 25 hours of facial electrolysis and I am NOT looking forward to having it elsewhere...but it&#39;s far better than trying to deal with it after the fact.
