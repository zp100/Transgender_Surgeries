What to say what to sayâ€¦
</p>
<p>
My god those first few days
<em>
SUCKED
</em>
. Pain and sickness were unbelievable and I really donâ€™t have much memory of day 1 and 2 other than waking up, being sick and in pain, passing out and rinse and repeat for about 48 hours.
</p>
<p>
Day 3 and 4 on the other hand were infinitely better. Got up and got moving around the ward, got to brush my hair and wash myself which felt heavenlyðŸ˜‡
</p>
<p>
All in all no exciting updates, other than things are sometimes a bit painful and Iâ€™m sometimes a little sickly.
</p>
<p>
Saw Dr Hart a couple times over the first few days, he let me know all went well and as expected, even with minimal donor material available pre-surgery.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow I should be getting the drains and exterior dressing off and Iâ€™m so excited to see how everything all looks.
</p>
<p>
Because of some creepy and inappropriate messages I got after my day 0 post I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be sharing photos publicly anytime soon. However if anyone is considering seeing Dr Hart please reach out directly and Iâ€™ll let you know if Iâ€™m comfortable sharing directly.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask and Iâ€™ll do my best to answerðŸ’–
