It&#39;s probably gonna need some revision, but it honestly looks really promising. Like as it heals, it&#39;ll come together pretty well. Not too shabby.

What do you think might need revision?

Well maybe not revision, but more attention for the scars and anything they might pop up as it heals, I suppose. But from looking at it, it looks like it&#39;s coming along nicely.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I could see that
<em>
might
</em>
be a thing is the shape being a little wonky (sorry I&#39;m not sure what word to use) , but that could very well be swelling, or the angle of the photo, or just how it was sitting at the time of the picture, so that&#39;s why I said
<em>
might
</em>
need revision, because I can&#39;t tell for certain. And it&#39;s not like vaginas are crazy symmetrical anyway.
</p>
<p>
I mean, if you&#39;re happy with the progress then don&#39;t take my word for it. I&#39;m new to observing surgery so I&#39;m definitely no expert.
</p>
<p>
But seriously, if this were me I&#39;d be pretty happy with it, so don&#39;t take this as negative. If this never got any more attention I don&#39;t think it would look bad by any means. I&#39;m just nit-picky, personally.

Thanks! I&#39;m not sure about the labia minora yet, but I need to wait for the swelling to go down. I did some therapy and &#34;spiritual&#34; work before the surgery, so I see my new vulva as I would a newborn baby. Obviously not perfect, but perfect anyway.

What a great analogy!  Day 22 is so early. Yours will likely heal just fine in time.

Yeah, absolutely!
</p>
<p>
For example, my dick has always been sorta twisted and screwed to the left. (And I do mean sorta, it&#39;s not super pronounced.) It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a desirable thing in a penis, but I mean, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s really a problem, right? It&#39;s just how it is. If I had a magic button to make it perfectly straight, sure, I&#39;d press it, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t be out here worrying about finding that button. Nothing is perfect and good enough is well, good enough.
</p>
<p>
I mean, I don&#39;t want this dick anyway, but in the context of a dick lol.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully this makes sense, but I think you&#39;re getting what I&#39;m saying. You also seem really happy about it and I&#39;m glad to see it!
