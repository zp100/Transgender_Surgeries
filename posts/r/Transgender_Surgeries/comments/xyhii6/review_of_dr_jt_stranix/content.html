Sorry that the pics aren&#39;t perfect, but I think they get the idea across. I have a vulva I&#39;m super happy with!

Thank you for the photos; fascinating to see how the site healed so nicely.
</p>
<p>
Also for your detailed description of recovery in the hospital. That will help others better understand what&#39;s involved. Sounds like you got great care.
</p>
<p>
Hope your recovery continues going well.
</p>
<p>
Your vulva looks great, BTW.
</p>
<p>
Congratulations!

I have an orchi scheduled with Dr. Corbett for December. I realized I really don‚Äôt have a reason not to just go ahead with bottom surgery and with the current political winds a lot of reasons to do it sooner rather than later. So I‚Äôm going to set up a consult with Dr. Stranix (depending on the time frame and their recommendations I might cancel the orchi and just go with the actual bottom surgery - I was mostly getting the orchi done this year since I‚Äôm maxing out my deductible with FFS next month). Any good tips for working with their office in the early stages? Also did you look at/consult any other surgeons? I live in Virginia and have a list of others in driving distance I‚Äôve also considered (Bluebond-Largner, Del Corral and McGinn)

It can be really hard to get in touch with Destiny sometimes, but it&#39;s important you continue trying. Once you have dates, things tend to move pretty quick -- the fact that you&#39;re already in the system with Corbett is gonna help.
</p>
<p>
I looked at other surgeons, but between wait-lists and my perspectives of Steanix&#39;s choices when I got breast augmentation, I was sold

Thanks so much! I absolutely love the work that was done. Like... Honestly, these pics do not do it justice. Plus, it&#39;s nice working with a good surgeon

Thank you so much for sharing. I have been very nervous about possibly switching Dr&#39;s.  She looks lovely.

My pleasure! Stranix and Corbett make a fantastic team, and I think they work together to make great vulvas and vaginas.
</p>
<p>
And thank you! I like her a lot (and she&#39;s much better than what was there before)

Hi! Sorry to necro the thread but I&#39;ve been considering Stranix and Corbett for awhile now. Thanks so much for posting pictures, your results are beautiful! Did you have to do any hair removal? And if so, how extensive?

Hi there! Thank you!
</p>
<p>
I was required to undergo hair removal around what was once the penile shaft. I ended up getting a little more because Alternative Health Associates up in Alexandria has a deal on laser for trans folks. I haven&#39;t had any hair regrowth in the last six months, so between the laser and the scraping done by JT appears to have been perfect for me

Oh that‚Äôs awesome!! I already go to Alternative Health for my facial hair removal! I‚Äôve had to stop doing laser bc my remaining hair was too red, but good to know the combo of laser and scraping seems to have done the trick for you! That brings me hope!!! I loath electrolysis üò≠

Hello! I wanted to ask how sensitivity and overall ability to feel pleasure has been.
</p>
<p>
I had my consult with Dr.Stranix and have been gearing up to go along with him (Currently undergoing electrolysis)  but have not heard of anyone talking about sexual functioning.

Hi! I&#39;m almost 2 years on at this point, and sensitivity and pleasure has been great! I had my first orgasm at like... 6 or 8 weeks. I&#39;ve had a few intimate partners since then, and it was wonderful!

Well that&#39;s rude.
</p>
<p>
I go to the gym 4 days a week, climb regularly, do a fuck ton of cardio and lift weights. You have no idea what my activity levels look like, nor what my health looks like.
</p>
<p>
My not being skinny has nothing to do with anything. I&#39;m three months in, there is still swelling, and my body occasionally does weird things when it comes to healing sometimes. The revisions I need are
<em>
minor,
</em>
the pictures I have were taken through a mirror after sunset and are not the best, and your opinion is unimportant
