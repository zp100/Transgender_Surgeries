I&#39;m in your same situation. I have a consultation with him coming soon, if I will be able to travel despite covid restrictions. I&#39;m very interested in the method, maybe after the consultation I&#39;ll write a post on here..

I can confirm I&#39;ve also been quoted €33,000, for both surgeries: €22,000 for the main one and €11,000 for the revisions 6 months later or so. I have a consultation on the 9th December. A friend also contacted them, and the lead-in time for surgery is currently 4 months from consultation, according to her.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s worth mentioning that he&#39;s no longer working in any practice in Munich, but is now working out of Potsdam. I originally booked to see him in Munich this week and only discovered he wasn&#39;t there when I called to confirm my appointment. It turned out they&#39;d tried to contact me by email but our corporate mail filter blocked the message :-(  Luckily I was able to change my flights and hotel booking, I&#39;m travelling from the UK.

A little update: I had my consultation and have booked with him.  He quoted a waiting time of 3-4 months for the surgery, and having booked, I&#39;ve got a date in just under 3 months&#39; time.
</p>
<p>
During the consultation, he showed a LOT of detail about his method including a fair few surgery photos, and showed a lot of results.

That&#39;s old info - up until the end of 2019 he worked together with Morath and they charged 3000€ for those on public insurance. He went solo in 2020 and took away this charge, but as of last month he is now only working in a private clinic that most health insurances won&#39;t cover the full costs of (if at all), so the price is now likely to be much higher.

I am four weeks post-op with Schaff. I can send you a picture if you like?
</p>
<p>
(As well as answer other questions you might have. I am very satisfied, though I had a complication which means I may have to have a followup operation to have full depth. Currently I get the dilator ca 12cm in.)
