Having multi-peak orgasms (and orgasm type in general) is a hormone thing more than an anatomy thing. I had them even before vaginoplasty (but post orchi, so T levels were super-low). I expect that if you&#39;re reaching orgasm with no problem you&#39;ll find that you&#39;ll have multi-peak orgasms at least some of the time. Have fun experimenting!

physically, stimulating the clitoris after a first orgasm I have not tried it more than once directly, but when I watch pornographic videos or photos I know that I can feel a pleasant sensation more than once in the genital area and in the body. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to have clitoral multiple orgasms.

I noticed yesterday, when I used the clitoris sucker for the first time, that I managed to have small spasms, but the first time since I had the operation

I&#39;ve had multiple orgasms many times. I&#39;m sure you will too at some point.
