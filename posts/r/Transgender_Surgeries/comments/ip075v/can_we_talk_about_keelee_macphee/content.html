I continue to hear people say that she trained under Marci Bowers.   This is incorrect.  Per Dr. Bowers own staff today via phone call, they  did not know who Keelee MacPhee is.  (650) 570-2270 is Dr. Bowers number  call and ask for yourself.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bowers does occasionally train  fellows out of Mount Sanai, however that list is very small and Keelee Macphee is not on it. New and up/coming surgeons routinely *observe*  Dr. Bowers perform surgery, but Keelee MacPhee has never actively  trained as a fellow or resident, under Dr. Bowers (again per her own  staff).
</p>
<p>
Please ya&#39;ll do your homework. I didn&#39;t do mine.
</p>
<p>
I assumed internet wisdom was right in making my decision to go with  MacPhee two years ago. Had I to do this all over again would  definitely gone with a different and more experienced surgeon. I&#39;m  actively planning a revision with Bowers or McGinn, that Macphee says is not advisable.
</p>
<p>
Basically, my surgeon left excess  erectile tissue under my labia minor.  When I am aroused a stump of  what was there before appears. It&#39;s hugely dysphoric and in spite communicating this, my surgeon says she will not consider a revision.
</p>
<p>
Keelee was awesome up front and law of probability says she has probably had a few raving success stories. I&#39;ve since been in touch with other Macphee girls who have the same complication I do. So do your homework!

When I had a consultation with MacPhee in March of 2019 I specifically asked her whether it was true that she trained under Bowers and she told me it was true.
</p>
<p>
If MacPhee is lying about that in order to sell herself, that’s deeply troubling.  No wonder she doesn’t take insurance, the companies probably refuse to work with her.

Her website claims doing SRS since 2005. Do you believe that? Or think that is far fetched?

Given that for mtf SRS there’s no pretty much no mention of her online before 2018 I’d say it’s more likely that what’s what she has written is purposely misleading.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dr. MacPhee has been performing gender reassignment procedures since 2005 and is grateful for the ability to help patients transition to the bodies that align with who they truly are.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://keeleemacpheemd.com/transgender-surgery/">https://keeleemacpheemd.com/transgender-surgery/
</a>
</p>
<p>
But what does that actually mean? A breast augmentation/reduction, orchi, or some ftm procedure might count as a gender reassignment procedure, but it’s not what you’d first think. It’s not what you did think.

If she wasn&#39;t doing full bottom surgeries in 2005 saying that is def misleading since most people consider GCS a bottom surgery and generally specifically some form of vaginaplasty and not like a basic orchiectomy which most urologists do regularly.

I have been around about twenty years and only heard of her in the last three or so years.   That doesn’t mean she didn’t do surgeries bitd, but if she did, it was pretty under the radar.  I’ve seen a lot of surgeons in srs/ffs since insurance companies started covering trans surgeries.   Bitd Anne Lawrence used to run a srs review site.   The big players were Brassard/Menard, Biber, Meltzer, Reed, Schrang, Suporn and Preecha.   Marcie was just getting started-took over from Biber.   In FFS, Dr. O &amp; Dr. Z.  Lynn Conway’s site has a lot of info on surgeons active back then,
