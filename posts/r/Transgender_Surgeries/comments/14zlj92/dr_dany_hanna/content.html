There are a few posts in the wiki in the side bar.  He is fairly new, a couple years at most.  The biggest concern discussed is that he trained under Dr Rumer.

He did my bottom surgery in May, and I&#39;m SO pleased. I asked him a LOT of questions at my consults with him, and I specifically asked about Dr. Rumor. He wants nothing to do with her and regrets any association with her at all. He&#39;s one of the best &#34;unknown&#34; surgeons and is located in North Texas. His office staff is absolutely friendly, and the nurses at the hospital where he performs his surgeries are selected and trained by him.

May I ask if you got full or minimal depth? I have a surgery date with Dr. Hanna on December 6 of this year. HE said he&#39;d do either on me so long as I met his weight requirements (210 for full depth, 215 for minimal depth). I&#39;m 219.8 now so hitting below his requirements for full depth in time is a certainty. He said he does like 70% minimal. My surgery with him is scheduled Dec 6th of this year.
</p>
<p>
I started thinking about how my penis isn&#39;t very large about 3 inches long and was (am?) concerned that I needed to get PPT to allow me to have depth and a good cosmetic results. I was tentatively scheduled with Dr. Min Jun for PPT next year next September but now that is up in the air because he is leaving the Crane Center and who knows if he will honor my date and / or take my insurance. I was holding off on canceling with Dr. Hanna just in case. I&#39;m glad I did as I might go through with surgery with him this year. I&#39;d made up my mind of Dr. Jun but maybe I should just go with Dr. Hanna.

I&#39;m in the same boat. I believe he also does PPT? Didn&#39;t really ask because after my Dr. Jun appt got canceled I took a step back and decided I didn&#39;t really care that much as I was primarily concerned with asthetics.

When I asked him about Rumer he said “there is a reason I am no longer with her. I didn’t appreciate the way she treated her patients and wanted nothing to do with that”  Every experience Ive had with him and his staff was nothing like I’ve ever had with any other medical professional. They are AMAZING. He is always available 24/7. He gives you a 24h number that connect to him or his wife (who also works at the office) directly so you’re not getting an answering machine but you get him.

His results look good to me. I&#39;m just concerned about the fact I am not very well endowed so I am uncertain I can get depth and a good cosmetic result without PPT surgery instead of PIV.

I contacted him as it&#39;s the closest clinic to me but he doesn&#39;t take my insurance.

I had full depth in mid June with doctor Hannah and I cannot say enough good things about him. The man is a true artist with a scapple. As of right now, things have gone so much more smoothly than I thought they would have.
