Hi all! Finally being brave and posting pictures here (that I won&#39;t delete a day later). As someone who wished there was more stuff for Dr. Roth&#39;s work on here (there&#39;s like 2 individual&#39;s pictures) I should be part of the solution. I&#39;ll do the obligatory long post but the summary
</p>
<p>
<strong>
tl;dr
</strong>
: I&#39;m quite happy with the results. I wish it were more astethetically pleasing (especially having a labia minora) but I have no regrets and I&#39;m very optimistic about things. I likely won&#39;t persue a revision unless a complication comes up (she&#39;s not the perfect pussy, but we can make due).
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery on 7 Nov 2022, having a robotic-assisted peritoneal pull-through. Dr. Joshua Roth was the urology surgeon doing all the bottom bits and Dr. Koch (I believe) was the surgeon operating the robot that handled the peritoneal stuff.
</p>
<p>
Not pictured I left with 5 &#34;stab wounds&#34; in my abdomen (including one inside the belly button). The scabs have already come off and they look like they&#39;re healing fine without any pain or anything from those after the first week or so.

Yes they&#39;re all basically the same position/pose. Haven&#39;t really taken full-body things since I&#39;m not comfortable with it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
My rambling thoughts on the results so far
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Good
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very happy to have had any surgery done. I have no regrets in that area at all. I seem to have plenty of clitoral sensation so I&#39;m excited for that (kinda frustrated I can&#39;t do anything sexual for another few weeks by doctor&#39;s orders). I have sensation on the left wall but little-to-none on the right side but my doctor said that&#39;s nothing to be concerned about yet as nerves are still waking up (which, in my experience, is random pain whenever a random nerve wakes up). There was no complations or anything also which is nice. Peeing has been good after an adjustment period, and pain has been managable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Bad
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dilation sucks. This isn&#39;t new information. I wasn&#39;t as aggressive at the start as I should have been (largely due to not being confident). My depth currently is (on a good session):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Petite Purple: 4 dots
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Petite Orange: 3.5 dots
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Normal Purple: 3 dots
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The depth isn&#39;t bad but I had to build back up to it after being too &#34;safe&#34; with dilation in the first couple weeks. I&#39;m at least trying to get to the blue one since that&#39;s roughly my partner&#39;s size (he&#39;s slightly thicker but real penises aren&#39;t as solid as literal wood).
</p>
<p>
FWIW my schedule is twice a day (from my doctor). rn I do 30 minutes on the smallest and largest ones listed above, and 15 minutes on the middle one. It&#39;s boring and uncomfortable but while I&#39;m off work (last week) it&#39;s not bad. It&#39;ll be more annoying trying to fit it in (no pun intended) before work.
</p>
<p>
Until recently I had pretty severe pain after dilation (especially the nightly session). Sometimes taking an oxy after (I&#39;m very apprehensive of pain killers so that&#39;s saying something), just to get through the night. Sleeping in general is difficult from discomfort and pressure, on top my normally bad sleeping habits.
</p>
<p>
Had a dehisience early on in recovery. Everyone on reddit, and my NP made it clear it wasn&#39;t a big deal. My NP mostly just stressed keeping it clean and keeping vaseline on it and all the stitches (partially to help the skin, but also to disolve the stitches).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Ugly
</strong>
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s not the cutest vagina here. My mons pubis has always been enormous (I had bury penis as result, which was convenient as a trans woman lol), but it kinda gives my vagina terrible cliff look from the front. While a little is swelling I&#39;m certain most of that is just how I am. Further weight loss should help (I&#39;m down 125 pounds but still about 30-ish pounds over weight and apparently it&#39;s half in my crotch lol). Not trying to lose weight during recovery but getting bacdk on the horse after.
</p>
<p>
The lack of labia minora isn&#39;t great. I realize that&#39;s commonly excluded from first surgeries due to swelling and whatnot but it&#39;s definitely the biggest disappointment of this all (I didn&#39;t understand that initially since the doctor said it included a labiaplasty but I didn&#39;t dig into specifics at the time). I likely won&#39;t get a revision to create one unless there&#39;s other complications or in the future it really gets to me. This surgery has been one of the hardest things in my life, physically, and I don&#39;t really want to go through even half of it again lol.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Overall
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d recommend Dr. Roth. His work isn&#39;t the prettiest in the world, but in terms of functionality he did an excellent job it seems. No complications (so far), recovery hasn&#39;t been awful, peeing is good, sensation is very very promising.

Highly DO NOT recommend Roth. Please see my post, and look carefully. Other women are having issues with his results.

I&#39;m sorry you had that experience for sure. From reading your post, that sucks a lot.
</p>
<p>
The only issue I&#39;ve had that overlaps with you is the excess tissue at the entrance issue (I think, we could be describing slightly different things). Which makes some angles of entrance difficult.
</p>
<p>
But regardless he needs to have more consistent results. I should do a post update about where I am though just for more complete/transparent data. W.r.t. outcomes it&#39;s also
<em>
possible
</em>
he&#39;s improved. When I had my consult in June 2021 I think he&#39;s only done like 20-25 surgeries (IIRC) himself, but I think now it&#39;s 2-3 times higher.

I had my surgery last year.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard from three other women with similar/same issues since then.
</p>
<p>
He told me he is doing about a surgery a week.
</p>
<p>
There is a reason you can&#39;t find accounts of his shit.

Did you have to do electrolysis before the surgery if so did you start after your first consult with dr Roth or after an did your insurance cover it? Iâ€™m considering going to dr Roth

I did not need electro. My understanding was he required it for penile inversion since he uses more of that tissue and stuff. But he didnâ€™t require it for PPV.
</p>
<p>
I imagine insurance should cover electro down there if your surgeon requires it. But not sure how all that works (I work on the insurance side and I know billing electrolysis people isnâ€™t the easiest)

How long did it take before you got contacted for a consult? I&#39;ve had a referral out since the end of October. And how far out was surgery from the consult? I&#39;m working on getting my letters.

I have a consult with him next year. His office called me about a month or so after the referral was sent in, though my NP said it would probably be 4 to 6 months. My consultation was scheduled 13 months out, and they said that it would be at least 2 years from then for a surgery date. .... I wish I didn&#39;t have to wait so long, or any of us for that matter. Transitioning in my 30s and feel like I&#39;ve lost so much time. If all continues on without any set backs I&#39;ll be pushing 40 when I get my day under the knife. But better then than never. Good luck

Hi!
</p>
<p>
My understanding is he has a 35 BMI requirement, but
<em>
I could be wrong
</em>
. I weighed approximately 220-230 (depending on which visit), which, at my height, are just under 30.

Yeah, that&#39;s a tight timeline but hopefully you can do it (safely). If you can&#39;t I assume just showing that you&#39;re making progress can maybe serve as enough to like give you a temporary date or something. Like not an all-or-nothing thing. But I don&#39;t know.

I had a similar perdiciment. I&#39;m not a gym goer, so I combined going vegetarian, well, &#34;vegatarian&#34; lol, I avoided dairy a lot, just not completely, and stopped drinking soda and most processes sugars (cosmic crisp apples and pb is my jam lol), drink only water, and a lot of it + black coffee in morning and occasionally black tea with lunch or dinner, and intermittent fasting - 8 hr eating widow between 12 and 8 pm was easy to keep, and I went hiking as much as I could. It was really low effort (overall) and I dropped 50 in about 6 months. A bit of that was muscle atrophy. But it&#39;s crazy what a little fasting, eating better, and mild exercise can do. I&#39;m a lazy taurus, so casual 3-5 mile hikes are my kind of exercise, lol. And for context. When I started, eating bacon would make my chest hurt. First trial with fasting, I went from 233 to 210, then had my first med appointment for transition, then did the above and got down to 165/170. It wasn&#39;t easy but I wanted one thing like I never have, so I gave up my yummy junk and comfort food for broccoli (roasted ðŸ¤¤) the first 3 months was hardest, but once I lost 20lbs I was hooked, more determined, and knew I had to just keep it up. I still would like to loose more... 22years of not caring about yourself takes its toll. But the more I push through, the more whole I feel. Good luck. You can get to where you need to be, and you don&#39;t have to kil1 yourself on a treadmill tp get there - unless that&#39;s your thing lol. I never thought i would be where i am and now believe that we are all capable of achieving our goals
</p>
<p>
I do miss chicken tacos, though... but cauliflower tacos are pretty bangin to. Lol.

Update of my experience with him:
</p>
<p>
My consult with him on 2/27/24 went fine. He was very careful to make sure I understood everything and the gravity of bottom surgery, as well as giving me all the space and time I needed for my questions. From things I&#39;ve read paired with my experience, I think he is just not a surgeon who is very focused on his work and your care and not the type of doc who kinda acts like your friend. And even with that, he was very nice. Imo, I think he&#39;s a really good doctor. My orchi on 4/4/24 went super smooth and I look forward to my PPT with him. I developed a cyst under the incisionafter about a month, but his DNP Amanda talked me throughthings, gave me a round of antibiotics and the cyst resolved itself just like she said it would. I understand some ppl have had not stellar results, but every bottom surgeon has patients who have had not stellar results. He&#39;s no Rumer. And I also had my FFSs with Dr. Dominic Vernon at Eskenazi and he was soo nice. He is the kind of personality that I think a lot of ppl want from a doc, but we can&#39;t forget that you&#39;re surgeon&#39;s job is to provide you with medical care not jovial friendship. My experience with Roth was really positive, both my wife and I couldn&#39;t see were some of the negative bedside mannerism comments were coming from. But I also think we as trans people wish too hard on maybe not to most realistic expectations. Dr. Roth can&#39;t give me a cis vagina, and bottom surgery is super complex and every person responds differently. From the results me and my wife have looked at he does a pretty dang good job, and does this work for a really good reason.
</p>
<p>
Also, his DNP Amanda is truly amazing. My post op check in with her went fantastically.
</p>
<p>
My views are shaped from working with a pride center and support group and from transitioning in my 30s. I&#39;ve had to accept a lot that will never be, and fme, younger trans folks can sometimes have not the most realistic expectations. For example Dr. Min Jun has produced some, like, out of this world results that probably every trans woman would want, but he also produces a lot of the average to average-well results. Because everyone&#39;s body and how they take to the surgery is different, Suporn is/was the same. Something that really helps is to look at a wide variety of cis vulvas. No 2 are the same and they vary a lot, asymmetry is normal, and they change throughout a woman&#39;s life. My wife&#39;s vulva at 21 and now at 36, post 2 kids, is different. And from the results of Dr Roth&#39;s, I think I&#39;ll be super happy, while also recognizing that I could be one of the few unlucky to roll a nat 1. We&#39;ll see some time by Feb 2026.
