I have posted this as there is not a lot of Parkside results on here. Bellringer also gets mixed reception, I know lots who had great results and found him quirky and others not so happy and bad experience.  For me I am happy with my results.  Surgery was on 13th January penile inversion. Took 2 hours 20min.I had spinal block administered and no real pain first day. Used morphine 2nd day till removed. Only paracetamol and ibuprofen after which was a struggle but as long as got meds on time just about coped. I do think pain control could be better. Recovery was standard amount of awful but parkside hospital is amazing. Bellringer bedside manner was crap and felt down. Rashid is lovely though. I had 7 inches of depth. Lost half inch over 6 months and maintaining fine now dilating once per day. I was orgasmic from week 8 and nerves were firing like crazy from 2nd week. Only complication was some granulation on bottom labia. Healed now but tiny bit of extra scarting there. Incision lines mostly blended in and covered by public hair.  First couple months sucked. I&#39;m reasonably happy with my outcome. Bellringer and Rashid both good surgeons. Rashid is easier to get on with tho.

If you feel comfortable, when you say orgasmic from week 8, how easy would you say it is to get there compared to before your OP? I also went to Bellringer (a little over a year post op now, first O at 5months), and getting over the hill still takes a lot of effort and time for me, and to be frank, I don&#39;t seem to have a lot of sensation (my clitoris is also very small/buried/has no definition which I think makes it hard to stimulate?)

It takes fair bit of effort and my sex drive pretty low so generally can&#39;t be bothered. But when I do try, majority of times I do get there but can take hour or more. However I struggled to orgasm before often. Sensation fine but my clit quite buried to. I was ok with that.

Hi there i also had grs with Bellringer back at the end of February this year! So pretty much at the 4 month mark now. My clit is also very buried almost seems like it’s under the skin? Does anyone know why Bellringer makes them so buried?  I mean im not complaining I can still orgasm/reach climax still
</p>
<p>
Just wondered why it was so buried!!!!!

I&#39;m not really sure and may ask when asking for silver nitrate again why its done that way. Tina&#39;s are really obvious but looks like the head and didn&#39;t want that reminder but wonder if its better for sensation.

Ahhh you see mines the opposite it’s definitely there but doesn’t look like the head at all.    Surprising as Rashid is under Bellringer!    If you do ask do get back to me on that please.

Wow ours could be identical twins! I had my surgery with Mr Bellringer almost 12 months ago on Saturday 3rd of July and I&#39;m very happy with my results indeed. Considering the donor material available (I had straight PI not peno-scrotal, so no genital electrolysis thank goodness) he&#39;s miraculously given me 6.5&#34; of depth which I&#39;ve managed to maintain. I&#39;ve been somewhat slower in reducing my dilation frequency than the advice given, as you&#39;re told you should be down to once a week by 12 months, my schedule currently being once every four days using the largest orange Soul Source dilator, with the purple, blue and green ones now being available for use as novelty paperweights. I had a few complications in recovery such as some burst stitches in my left hand incision (totally my own fault for being an impatient patient), wound dehiscence and granulation where the incisions meet  at the fourchette and some internal granulation that Mr B treated with silver nitrate at my follow up appointment. The burst stitches and dehiscence healed up fine and the granulation at fourchette responded well to Betnovate cream. My scars have faded nicely now too and I was conscientious over their care, regularly massaging them with bio oil as recommended. I&#39;m fully sensate and had my first &#39;big O&#39; at just over three months, although it did take some time at first as I had to relearn how to get there. My clitoris is very similar in appearance to how others have described but that&#39;s not an issue as far as I&#39;m concerned as it works! I have no idea how long my surgery took as I never asked, all I know is that I went under at about 8:15 and woke up at about 10:30 although it seemed like I only closed my eyes for a second. I never had any pain, never needed or used the morphine and even stopped the paracetamol they were regularly giving me on the morning of the third day after surgery as I didn&#39;t need it. He does have a rather blunt bedside manner but I liked it, as I just want the facts and tbh I was more interested in his skill with a scalpel. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve posted about your surgery with Mr Bellringer on here and the fact that you&#39;re happy. I thought I would respond to share my experience (sorry it&#39;s so long) and to say I&#39;m happy, as are many, many others. My GP was suitably impressed too as when she saw it when I went to see her for a swab for a possible infection at the beginning of week seven (there wasn&#39;t one fortunately) she said, &#34;that&#39;s amazing you&#39;d never be able to tell would you?&#34; Considering she is the gynecological special interest GP at my GP surgery and sees lots of cis women&#39;s vaginas that&#39;s high praise indeed!

Took 2 hours 20 minutes.....
</p>
<p>
So he can do a decent job when he can be bothered and takes his time.
</p>
<p>
He spent 140 minutes doing a good job on you.
</p>
<p>
He did me In 75 minutes and it looks absolutely shit, no sensation to speak of, huge pain post op that he would not authorise pain killers for and chronic pain still 7 months later. He completely fucked my crotch and I&#39;m needing to get it fixed with a different surgeon. I never want to be in the same room again as that asshole. Fucking soul destroying how he can do such a good job on you then not bother with mine, fuck him and parkside that let him get away with this shit.

Oh look, one he spent time on. Private by any chance ?

For a realistic result when he can&#39;t be bothered on a Saturday morning rush job / NHS there are pics on my profile.

Mine are quite neat. Most scarring was small split and granulation. But the 2 v lines are very neat. Better than I expected.

Hey looks lovely! I&#39;m week 5 post op with Tina Rashid so it&#39;s nice to see what things might look like with less swelling :)
</p>
<p>
I found a little tramadol very helpful on day 2/3 especially to sleep, but didn&#39;t need any morphine. The nurses also make an ice pack for me which was helpful!
</p>
<p>
I notice on your profile you were feeling a little regret a while back I hope you&#39;re feeling more positive now x
</p>
<p>
Thanks for posting x
