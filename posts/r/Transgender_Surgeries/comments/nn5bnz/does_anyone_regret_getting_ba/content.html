I&#39;m just over 6&#39;0&#34; 160lbs and went with 500cc anatomical implants, which seems typical compared to trans women of similar proportion to me. My cup size is 38D now.  I feel like they make me way too top-heavy and I was misgendered within two weeks of getting my implants. I hadn&#39;t been misgendered in the past 18 months prior to BA. I&#39;m 50/50 whether I should downsize or just have them removed altogether and present androgynous going forward.

I regretted getting BA in January 2020, I had an experience with a male surgeon in Pittsburgh PA where he guided me to choosing saline implants and talked me into 395CC up from what I wanted max being 325CC( He stated 325CCs was way too small for my frame, even after I repeatedly told him I wanted a modest improvement in bust).
</p>
<p>
After surgery the surgeon let my partner in the waiting room know how I was doing at told her he went with 450CCs because he thought it would make me happier. I felt top heavy and disproportionate plus had constant pain in my left breast and a feeling of something being out of place on the left side. I had them removed November 2020 and feel much better all but the scars I have leftover.  I really wonder how much some male surgeons views of women or idea of what he prefers in women shapes their judgement of what would be best contrary to what the patient actually wants.

A surgeon should never change the plan without consulting with the patient.

I went through hell last year with mine but they were old. I ended up getting the same size to reinsert but 16 years and the latest smooth cohesive gel. They are much smaller.
</p>
<p>
I agree that people don&#39;t realize there&#39;s a lot more to consider than how big they will be. By te time I got mine out in December, they were recalled and ruptured, I had two capsular contractors, in addition to silicone leaking in my breast tissue. They had made me sick and depressed and I didn&#39;t even realize it. I didn&#39;t suspect they were making me sick and didn&#39;t expect much improvement in my well being. But two weeks after I got them out I suddenly noticed I was feeling amazing. THIS, after a 6 hour surgery. I should have felt like crap, It&#39;s just gotten better and better since.
</p>
<p>
Anyway,I wrote it up here:

I read your story so happy you&#39;re doing well. Gallagher has her practice in Miami now and I was thinking about going with her but you&#39;re the second person I&#39;ve read that has had problems with her. Thanks for bringing that story to light i&#39;ll be going elsewhere.

Wow that was a pretty wild read.  But that very much matches many of the long term BA concerns I was reading about.  Thought sounds like you banged pretty close to the worst case situation.  Hugs Emma!

I never considered how important the issues really were  until it all happened. The worst part was not realizing they were making me sicker and sicker. Bii is one of those chronic illnesses that when you bring it up to your doctor you know everything you are describing is anecdotal and comes with a pile of controversy. But my lab test, blood work and blood pressure showed almost immediate improvement after surgery that continues to improve.

I&#39;m sorry, the implant and illness was bad, but the whole experience of getting it taken care of was the epitome of bad health care. Why? Because spiteful Dr. Gallager fabricated reasons for my dismissal and prevented my access to the entire plastic surgery department. My own doctors couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t refer me to a surgeon to remove the implants in-network. This went on for more than two years while I had all these complications from GRS and the implant issues.
</p>
<p>
This is reason enough why you should avoid her.
</p>
<p>
Trust me, I begged and pleaded for help and got nowhere. That&#39;s when I turned to me Anthem Nurse Case Manager and eventually I went to the Cleveland Clinic.
</p>
<p>
Now I know why the Cleveland Clinic is a world class hospital with a great trans program and it was all in-network.

If you get cleavage from them I&#39;m sure it will be fine. 500cc still left me with a wide gap in addition to being top heavy and having narrow hips wasn&#39;t helping :/

Okay. If you’re looking for natural look you can look into maybe low profile, which would enable you to use a small volume implant &amp; not end up with a super huge gap in between your breast

Yes what makes you clockable  are many things not just breasts. You voice, the way you walk, your mannerisms and yes, narrow hips will make you stand out and also facial features. Have you had FFS already? Like I said, many things can make a girl clockable. To me I have to get FFS and a BBL first beforeeven gettinga BA. But that&#39;sjust me..

I&#39;ve had 3 FFS surgeries and VFS. I pass 100% on the phone with my voice and I&#39;d say my face passes pretty well. I&#39;ve had situations where someone would &#34;sir&#34; me from behind and then when I turn around say, &#34;oh, sorry ma&#39;am&#34;. I don&#39;t think most people realize how much having a wide ribcage and shoulders can out you. I should have tried getting a BBL first looking back on it. I&#39;m hoping I can gain enough weight for it.

I&#39;m sorry that happens to you. I also have a wide rib cage and wide shoulders and this is the reason why I think a big butt with very wide hips is important to me because otherwise I am clockable because of my frame and narrow hips. My face is ok I guess but I still need FFS and my voice is clockable as well but I&#39;m working on it. Or maybe I should also get VFS. I know how you feel because I have the same problem.

I regret going to a shitty surgeon who botched me and had to get two revisions. Still not happy with them but they look a lot better than the initial botched job so it is what it is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78kgIOBKkmQ">Mathilda Hogberg - I Don&#39;t Recommend Getting a Boob Job</a>
</p>
<p>
Mathilda one of my favorite trans youtubers recently discussed her actual problems with her BA.  These are actual things in life that you wouldn&#39;t think of, a surgeon is unlikely to tell you, and can drastically effect your life.
</p>
<p>
Specifically she goes over how much a BA helped with her dysphoria... and that she loves seeing them.  BUT, they are far more &#34;fragile&#34; than your regular body parts.  And they are in-fact foreign objects inside your body.  Which can result in some pretty unsettling feelings and pain.  She has specifically been having problems with pain herself and may end needing to have her girls reviewed for replacement or removal.
</p>
<p>
As for if you should downsize... yikes that is a tough question.  I know IF I choose to get a BA I&#39;ll have to be careful of the same choice and ending up top heavy as well.   I do know you have to wait quite a bit before any more surgery can be done to the area.  So might as well settle in and ask this question again in a year.

Thankfully my surgeon is going to do the revision for free, excluding facility fees, because I wasn&#39;t happy. I was told to wait until the 3-month mark before scheduling. I felt I went overboard and my fear of looking like a drag queen or a caricature of a woman was realized when I woke up from surgery. I would have been totally fine with 500cc if I had a narrower rib cage and wide hips but I need to be realistic and find what works well with my body type. I&#39;m pretty thin, don&#39;t gain weight easily, and have a similar body type to many WNBA players, so I figured replacing them with a small implant like 250cc might be the best option. Just removing them would be admitting failure and that would lead me down a very dangerous psychological path after going through 34 hours of surgery and 2+ years of HRT.

Yeah. I have to write her a really good review after all this. The work that she did was great and I told her it was all my fault for not doing my research, while trying not to have a breakdown. She reassured me that she would either downsize or remove them depending on what I wanted and meet with me again soon to talk about what my options are.

Jeesh this is not your fault. She&#39;s the surgeon. It&#39;s the surgeons responsibility to know what to do if they are doing the procedure.

I did. I assumed they wouldn&#39;t be so wide set and it&#39;s much different looking in a mirror vs seeing your reflection when standing with a group of people.

Typically chest width is the biggest hurdle to overcome with MtF BA. Even A breast surgeon experienced in trans-patients can&#39;t always compensate enough to get good aesthetics. A good front adjusting bra might help.

Nipple location was part of the problem too. If my surgeon moved the implants more towards the center my nipples would be on the side of the breast. It might not be too much of a problem, since I doubt I&#39;ll ever take off my shirt in front of anyone, but I still have to look in the mirror.

Oh you can stop that thinking right now. You deserve what anyone else would expect from BA. Nice boobs! Don&#39;t accept less because you think no one else will see them. Areole placement should be part of the surgery if that&#39;s what it takes to get good reaults. I&#39;ve had mine moved twice. It wasn&#39;t because I had some deep desire to relocate my nipples. It was because it was necessary for the appropriate breaat aesthetics.

Did he use an inframammary incision or periareolar?

After one year, would you mind telling us how the story ended up? Did you get smaller 250cc implants finally? And are you happy with them?

I ended up having them removed. I&#39;m allergic to a lot of things and this was another thing. I started breaking out in rashes near the incision and on my cheeks. However, they were in long enough that it stretched the skin and lowered the inframammary fold. More natural breast tissue developed to fill in some of the volume that i lost after removal. I may get a bit of fat transfer to the area in the future. At least I know now that my body doesn&#39;t like implants.

I had mine done a few years ago I was NB leaning but non transitioning I originally thought about a B or small C as that was the size of my breast forms I was use to Wearing. My surgeon explained due to my size and height they would be too small and look odd considering what I had ask. He encouraged me to go larger, at the time it wasn&#39;t much of a push to get me to agree to go larger. Ended up a D/DD once they settled and fluffed out they looked nice though it was a bit painful at first, while the results are good they are very noticeable
