The moderators should really make this post a sticky at the top. I&#39;ve never seen a botched repair look like this. This is a miracle.

Reality: is it safe to assume that you are a woman with a support system and money?

Your story makes me so much more comfortable with the work Dr. Al Kassis did for me yesterday! I was originally supposed to have Winocour and he (W) had done my prior surgeries (15# removal abdominoplasty, and arm lift with BA/BL). I&#39;d never met or spoken with the man before today so I was running on a LOT of faith.
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much for sharing this and to everyone in this community that&#39;s shared their results from him as they really helped calm my mind.
</p>
<p>
Edit: changed day as it was yesterday not today. Sleep and sense of time is so borked RN 😆 🤣 😂

I should. Getting an extended stay due to living 75 miles away and unable to afford a hotel stay for several nights before first scheduled post-op. Also appears things went smoother than anticipated as he&#39;s now comfortable with me making that trip and moved said appointment to the Monday that starts week 3 post-op.

I loved him and was very frustrated that he didn&#39;t get me across the finish line. When he was at Vandy he and Kassis worked together on every case and I think he basically started the whole program here. Even had my HRT doc text him to rib him a little for not getting me done after all the work he put into my body. Results I saw in pics were great and I was super comfortable with him. The only nervousness I had yesterday was down to having never met or spoken with Kassis before, so I was going on blind faith practically.

He really does have a great bedside manner. Next time you see him tell him Andrea in Nashville says &#39;hi&#39; and she did great with bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
Also that I&#39;m still considering that garment tag.

If you’re comfortable answering:

<p>
Was most of the time between revisions waiting for your body to heal?  14 months sounds like a quick turnaround time for 4 surgeries.

So happy that this was able to come out much better for you. Bless you my dear I am sure the ordeal was beyond any comprehension and there are no words that would suffice on my part. Just know we are thankful for you to be on the other side of that nightmare. May you be rewarded with smooth sailing from here on out. Sending warm and healing thoughts to you you must be so strong! Rock on girl may you live a long, healthy, and beautiful life.

It&#39;s odd... my results were good. I&#39;m sorry this happened. :o It makes me feel bad recommending because I had a positive experience 11 days PRIOR to your surgery. I feel like it&#39;s a dice roll, but maybe I just got lucky.

Wowwwww!! Amazing what he did with your original surgery!! I am so, so sorry you had to go through that trauma, but your vulva looks amazing now!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m thinking of getting on the waiting list with Dr. Alkassis  for top surgery, and this really makes me feel good about it. He seems like a very compassionate and talented guy.
