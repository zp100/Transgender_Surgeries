Suporn did mine. The overall cosmetic result is similar to Banks‚Äô results. The truth is that regardless of who did it there is plenty of variation from patient to patient, specially this early. Every body is different, recovery is different and all the results differ slightly. Plus, in a way, every patient presents to them with a different set of materials

He had to retire for medical reasons 2-3 months ago. Possibly for good (the website states that he will not do any surgeries through 2023). I was probably one of his last 30 patients

It is overall, very similar. It is the same surgeon performed at about the same time. but it&#39;s not identical, each is proportioned a little differently.

It&#39;s only been a pain after flying home. Feels like 8 rever recovered from the plane trip (pain wise not depth).

There&#39;s so much swelling left to go down. According to Dr Bank the majoras will go down a bit, the clit hood will deswell a bit more and the minora will become thinner.

I beleive you, surgeons that close with tidy sutures can do this easily and consistently. Some just don&#39;t bother because they are in a rush and leave horrific scarring like mine.

Have you tried Dr. sanguan?  He is less well known with westerners, but uses a method similar to Suporn and has been know. To do revisions.

I have a couple of questions about your SRS (To be honest there are a lot of questions): What made you choose Dr. Bank over Dr. Suporn and other doctors? (It&#39;s on my short list and I have doubts who to go with) How has your recovery been so far? Do you recommend Dr. Bank? You had the circumcision before the surgery? How consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth currently? How was the dilation process during the recovery? It is painful? Did you request any kind of aesthetics for your vulva? Are you planning to have revision surgery? And if you have not undergone one, What would improve your result with one? (is a very good result, especially consider than you are only 1 months post op), How was your stay in Thailand (Chon Buri)? What was the aftercare like for Dr. Bank and the clinic staff in general? And by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.

Dr Bank is better than Dr Suporn now. He&#39;s also known for having better english skills. I live in NZ so the only SRS doc here isn&#39;t good so I decided to go with one of the best as the American ones charge an arm and a leg of you don&#39;t have US insurance.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
2.Recovery is easy while in Chon Buri, you are in the hospital for a week bored af then in the hotel there are a lot of other girls to hang out with. Pain isn&#39;t really an issue as they give you strong pain meds
</p>
<p>
After the flight home dilation was painful and difficult for a week (15 minutes to reach depth).
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
I recommend Dr Bank, he is easy to talk to and cares a lot about recovery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I was not circumcised but the different isn&#39;t shown in the pictures, it means my inner minoras are pink.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I love my results, he gave me the looks I asked for and a very nice clit hood, sensitivity is great both with the clit, the vaginal canal and the libia. I haven&#39;t tested much else out tho since exploration isn&#39;t allowed until 2 months have past.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
depth is roughly 16/17cm (depends where you measure from)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
dilation is very much a chore with some pain, for me isn&#39;t not that bad just uncomfortable with some pain.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
my requests was for a prominent clit hood that can be seen when standing up, majoras and minoras in line with each other. He was able to do it all, currently the majoras are larger than my minoras but will see in two months when more swelling has gone down.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I am planning to go back and make my minoras end at the same place as currently they don&#39;t, and other than that I don&#39;t see anything to change. The minoras is just a nit pick as well.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The aftercare  is fantastic, once you are out of the hospital and in the hotel a nurse checks up on you every day and you see Dr Bank twice a week (they drive you to the clinic for those).
<br>
They make sure you have enough pain killers or other dilation supplies to last the month as well so you don&#39;t need to worry about that.
</p>

Yep, for 2 months Dr Bank told me. It&#39;s because your clit will get &#34;erect&#34; and all the blood going to it can break the newly formed and weak blood supply to it.

Lmao no. I broke the rule in 24 hours with someone (I wasn&#39;t touched there aelt all)

Once you are out of the hospital you&#39;ll know when to stop as there will be pain from your clit when sufficiently aroused.
