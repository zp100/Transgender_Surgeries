My dr.  referred me to Dr. Joshua Roth for bottom surgery (mtf). She says he is the only Dr she ever refers people to for bottom surgery (she only has trans and nb patients) and hasn&#39;t received any complaints about him,  but I can&#39;t find much info about his practice online.
</p>
<p>
Does anyone know anything about him? His practice is in Indianapolis IN

I am scheduled with him to get the penile pull through vaginoplasty on July 19th. My main issue right now is the fact he is requiring that the area is absolutely hair free ahead of time, so I have until June 19th. I&#39;m blonde and older so all the hairs down there are transparent, so it can only be electrolysis. Been working at an accelerated pace with my gal to get it down, upping my appointments to 2x a week this month. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get it done, but I know hair can be removed from the inside, I just wish that was an option. Anxiety!

Who did you use for electrolysis? My daughter needs to get started and she&#39;s a redhead. I would love to find someone in Indiana who does the area needed for surgery. I&#39;m not having much luck. I heard great things about Milan, but they are only doing laser now.

I went through Barb at Arborcrest, but she&#39;s told me she&#39;s not really going to be doing anymore hair removal for bottom surgery. She&#39;s in her 70&#39;s and the process really hurts her hands (have to put tension in the area to do the removal). She still does everywhere else though.
</p>
<p>
I need to find a new electrolosist for that are as my wife is prepping for her own surgery. We are going through Milan for laser to get what they can for her.

He knows what he is talking about and doing, he had only done it 20 times so far. I saw some of his work, but it is hard to tell if its good or not because all the photos were immediately taken after surgery, no full recovery post op photos.....which makes me even more nervous af!! T_T

It went great actually he had plenty of photos both directly after surgery and then 6 months later. They do Peritoneal Pull Through surgery, which i think I&#39;m going to go with but he works with another more experienced surgeon who taught him the procedure so there is extra experience with it. He explained everything well. he really knew his stuff, and answered all my questions to my satisfaction.  I just now have to make sure i have someone around to help with aftercare!

I’m glad to hear that. Plus, he probably doesn’t have a 2 year waiting list yet.

If deductibles matter always go for surgery in the first part of the year. Then you won’t have to pay them twice for a revision.

Sure, I do. He did a revision for me last May, 2020. Well, it wasn&#39;t so much a revision it was more like clean up. He removed a cyst from my Vulva.

First of all, I would be weary of any surgeon who doesn&#39;t have patients who have come forward with some personal stories about their experience. This goes for any surgeon. Personally, I&#39;m on the fence about my experience with Dr. Roth, due to several reasons that were easily avoidable. He was a Pediatric Reconstruction Urologist. I don&#39;t think he was particularly good at communicating with adults. Especially adults that advocate for themselves and know when they are being misinformed --at least not this one. This was a point of contention because I felt that he was more fixated on finding fault in my language than he was listening to what I was actually saying. I also don&#39;t particularly enjoy when the surgeon I had surgery with, who is 20+ years my junior, tells me what language is and isn&#39;t appropriate to express or describe my feelings about the outcome and recovery. As an IT professional whose livelihood has been dependant on using online resources since 1996, I found his email reply to a serious question that I --not believe everything I read on the Internet-- to be extremely insulting.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, I&#39;d like to see him become a successful GRS surgeon in Indianapolis. It&#39;s something the Indy trans-community needs access to. He showed me pictures of his work, but it was too soon post-op to make any assessment of the outcome. So I can&#39;t speak to that.
</p>
<p>
If your Dr. is recommending Dr. Roth and knows other post-ops in your area, ask him to reach out to them and see if any of them are willing to talk to you. If they will, they could call or email you. You might check Susans.org for a report too.
