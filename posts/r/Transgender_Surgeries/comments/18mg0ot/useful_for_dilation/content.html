haven’t had bottom surgery but as far as i know you’re looking for depth more than girth when dilating anyways. best to use what’s recommended by the doctors

Check out the milli expanding dilator. A lot more expensive, but it doesn&#39;t look like a torture implement

If you follow Dr. Powers, apparently inflatable butt plugs are good for this
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Just to clarify I meant anal balloons not inflatable butt plugs because those are actually two different things

I generally try not to follow him, since he was found out to be a grifter.

He definitely has some questionable attitudes. But I&#39;ve found some interesting and helpful stuff on his subreddit. His post about gene mutations and transness may have also helped solve one of my long term non-trans medical mysteries which is such a lifesaver.
</p>
<p>
Just curious, how was he a grifter though?

Oh yeah I remember when this was posted. That was the moment where I was like &#39;kay, it&#39;s not just me thinking something was off&#39;. But yeah even so I&#39;ve found helpful info on his sub from others too. I just make sure not to take all of it at face value.

Width is very important in order to have intercourse. Depth isn’t any good if you can’t get the penis inside you.

It expands only in one direction, and doesn&#39;t have an easily insertable initial size.. I&#39;d steer well clear. Coming from someone with girth issues, who has painfully worked up from 22mm to 32mm in 3 months... Just use lots of dilators and be patient.

Absolutely not! The metal rods would concentrate pressure at a few points, which would be very painful and probably lead to fissures in the vaginal wall. If you’re looking for an expandable dilator, try a balloon style version such as the one linked below. It exerts even pressure around the entire vaginal wall, is made of body-safe silicone, and the expansion can be easily controlled and released by the squeeze pump. I used this to stretch my scar ring during the contracture period (post-op months 3-5). It worked so well that my surgeon (McGinn) has been giving these to her other patients with contracture issues.

That’s what Dr Powers recommends.

Yup, I saw the post he made about it a while back. There were a few things that he wrote that I took issue with, but he’s generally right about balloons being more effective than rigid dilators for increasing canal width. Powers also acknowledged that balloon dilators are not a replacement for rigid dilators. Maintaining depth is vital and rigid dilators are needed to stretch the back wall of the canal. I think the particular model that Powers recommended (Ram Anal Balloon pump) is ok, but not the best. The one I linked above has a better shape for stretching the scar ring(s), which is what many patients struggle with when sizing up. The wider part of the balloon can be position just inside the scar ring to really focus the radial expansion on that area.

I&#39;d recommend you go back to Dr Powers post and add your feedback. It may help others.

I had bottom surgery and I would not use this. It looks scary and I don’t see how it would be worth it. You’re better off using the dilator the doctor prescribes and sizing up.

Dilation maintains depth because lost depth can’t be regained. Girth is more a matter of stretching.
</p>
<p>
There’s a reason the vast majority of us were handed a bundle of SoulSource dilators when we’re discharged from hospital. They are entirely appropriate to the circumstances of our recovery.
