5 weeks post op and 3 weeks post revision with Dr.Chettawut. I&#39;m feeling very paranoid about the fact that the healing process isn&#39;t going well. Any thoughts or chett patients who have gone through the same?

I can&#39;t imagine what you are going through, but if the healing process does end up finishing well it looks like the end result will look great.

I&#39;m guessing you also had a popped stitch on the bottom of your labia? seems to be a pretty common problem, everyone i was there with had one to some extent, and mine required a revision.
