Backstory: I had surgery May 17th. My surgeon kept insisting that I had a perfect result, despite only giving me 4.5 inches of depth when I said that was the most important thing for me. This has led me to mistrust my surgeon a bit along with conflicting information they’ve given me as far as dilating. My surgeon hasn’t even mentioned the obvious asymmetry with the labia minora, so I’m wondering when this heals, will it heal more symmetrical or will it always look asymmetrical unless I have a revision?

<p>
who&#39;s your surgeon? seems like you&#39;ve got more symmetry issues than just the labia minora, your incisions aren&#39;t even the same length let alone location. 4.5 inches of depth is not &#34;perfect&#34; at all, you&#39;re right about that. I&#39;d say you definitely need a revision, from someone else.
</p>
<p>
Really sorry this happened to you, and that you&#39;re unsatisfied with your results, that&#39;s awful. I hope it can be made right.

Unfortunately yeah, I live near Whitehead but instead flew across the country to a different surgeon because of his reputation. Especially with the rumor that he worked with Dr. Salgado, the guy who posted mid-surgery pics of patients on Instagram with mocking captions.

I actually have had a consult w him, and planned to have surgery (no one in my city, other surgeon is Salgado - which is terrible). A friend is also going this month for surgery.

If it’s any consolation I had virtually no complications other than more bleeding than usual and having to have a catheter reinserted. If I had a do over though, I would have gone with BBL or Wittenberg. They seem a lot more caring and invested in their patients

Unfortunately I&#39;ve been down this road to a lesser degree and this kind of asymmetry problem is not easy to fix. I still have asymmetry myself because, I&#39;m not interested in using a skin graft in an attempt to fix it.

As others have said it does look as though you will need a revision. Sorry you surgeon lied to you, mine did as well and I also need it fixing.
</p>
<p>
One thing I would suggest though is get some silicone scar strips. Your V scars look the same shape as mine and are still dark purple 8 months later. Wish I had started using the scar strips earlier but I was in a very bad way and not functioning.

Thank you for the tip! Can I go ahead and use them now even with the scabs? I have a supply ready to go for when I’m able to. Surgeon has been MIA otherwise I would have asked them

I would say yes, just be careful trimming the hair that you don&#39;t accidentally remove the scabs.
</p>
<p>
Maybe cut the strips so you only cover the purple bits ?

I wish I could be of more help, but you might want to look into getting on a waiting list for revision. I think it’ll look a lot better once it continues to heal, but there’s something going on that side that likely won’t look great.
</p>
<p>
That being said, it certainly falls within the “normal range” of cis genitalia. I find it comforting to view the Labia Library, which shows how appearances vary a ton . Here’s a link:
