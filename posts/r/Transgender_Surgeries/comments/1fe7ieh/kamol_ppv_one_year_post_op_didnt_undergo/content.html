You said you don&#39;t dilate, how ? I thought you need to dilate regularly post-op ?

<p>

About dilation ? And you didn&#39;t have any problems ? I thought it was highly recommended ? But that&#39;s really cool if you don&#39;t need to, less things to think haha :)
</p>
<p>
Sorry, I&#39;m FtM, I know some things about different types of vaginoplasty and also some post-op things, but I clearly don&#39;t know everything haha, and I want to learn more things about MtF surgeries in general : I&#39;ve transfem friends and sometimes they ask me if I&#39;ve this or that information since they know that I&#39;m trying to inform myself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (and since that most of information is in English and that we&#39;re French ‚Äì so bad English speakers üòÜ /joke-with-a-grain-of-truth).

Some girls don&#39;t need to dilate. Also regular intercourse can keep it open as well. Always recommend but some girls find they do fine without, especially as you get further from surgery!

My personal opinion that is what I call a beautiful looking vagina. Even though I am not into vaginas  and honestly haven&#39;t seen too many in person. Although I do go with 5 girls once a month to a beauty spa session. I am the only girl like me there and they know and accept me. A few times we all have been naked and done the spread and compare while drinking wine and giggling. Of the girls they are all different and personally some do not look as nice as others but no one would ever say anything as it is their body and not for any of us to criticise. We are all friends and care for each
<a href="http://other.Plus" rel="nofollow">other.Plus
</a>
they say same nice things about what I have down there too.
</p>
<p>
I am super happy with how my vagina looks, even though I know little about what is meant to be a nice vagina, but so happy with what I have. Although any result would have made me happy compared to tucking a penis and testes into my panties for too much longer. I personally prefer the look of an uncircumcised penis as long as it is not attached to me.
</p>
<p>
So this is my point, why do people on here criticise on the Reddit Posts. Girls on here who kindly show their results are showing their satisfaction, showing others for help and support and it really annoys me that people criticise  these brave and helpful people. The girls are sharing their experiences for the benefit of others through this journey of transition. Many of us put everything on the line to get to where we need to be to make our lives successful and happy. Many of us lose our family, friends and endure massive financial loads to get here. This is not a place to criticise someones surgeon or the type of surgery they have had.
</p>
<p>
But anyway had my complain, but wanted to say how could anyone criticise your surgeon when he has allowed your body to look the way it is. Well done and enjoy life, especially when taking those big dicks, ha ha ha

You know your comment is quite rude and irresponsable, right? Whatever your thoughts are, please be gentle and notice that neo vulvas don&#39;t ever look exactly like a cis one. Not even the Almight God Dr. Bank does create a natal vulva alike. I know it&#39;s common to hate Kamol in here, but let&#39;s keep it to the doctor and not attack someone&#39;s body and what could become an insecurity. I&#39;m sorry for op to be openly sharing her result and receiving this kinda thing. Your vulva looks great, hun, and it&#39;s yours and only you know how hard all this process was. Don&#39;t listen to trolls.

You know, you don&#39;t have to denigrate the majority of cis women to say that a vulva/vagina is beautiful.. All vulvas/vaginas are beautiful..

yuuuuuup. as a trans man here, i plan on getting phallo,, but sometimes when i see someone on here saying they are unhappy with their results of mtf surgery, I just wish I could reverse the surgery, and do magic to give them my parts, and get theirs in return. That way there‚Äôs no scarring, or long, painful, possibly brutal healing process. Just two peoples lives changed forever with a swipe of a magic wand or a snap of a finger.

Shit im high as hell, nono, i was just trying to say something nice to your comment.  i think my train of thought was, if i could switch my parts with someone else like that, they would be happy with their body, and feel beautiful instantly, and neither one of us would have to go through the pain in the ASS to get there. Even though we‚Äôd still be happy in the end. Would just love to be able to make it quicker and less painful for people haha. Just thinkin my high thoughts, dont mind me.

I understand what you mean but I don&#39;t share your point of view. I&#39;m pretty happy to be a trans man and to be able to choose the parts I want on my body. It&#39;s like being litteraly a &#34;self made man&#34; haha ! Dysphoria hits hard some days, but the journey is as important as the &#34;goal&#34; to me, and I don&#39;t really want to exchange that experience for a cis man body. But I respect and 100% understand your point of view :)

As a trans man as well, that‚Äôs perfectly fine!  I absolutely wasn‚Äôt saying that EVERY trans man or woman would rather do that. But many of us just wish that we were born who we were meant to be without having to go through all the hell and medicine and surgery‚Äôs. And even after surgery, some of us get dysphoric about the scars or how our new dick or vagina looks compared to cis peoples. It‚Äôs a sense that, even knowing we finally have one, the fact we weren‚Äôt born with it can still make it a hard thing to come to terms with. I can say for me personally, I‚Äôm very comfortable in my body now. And I almost pretty much see it the way you do aside from some things. But, it‚Äôs nice to be able to choose your own dick size. My chest was never an issue because I have very little there so, I may not even opt for top surgery. But I know I‚Äôll get phallo one day. It‚Äôs just the way I see it is, if I could meet a nice trans girl who was going through what I am right now, and was also scared of something going wrong AFTER the surgery, if I could just magically exchange our parts so we never had to worry about that and the pain and discomfort, even possible fitsulas and infections, it would be really nice. That‚Äôs all!

I feel like any man can be a self made man. In my eyes, it has nothing to do with the body,, but it‚Äôs the mind and spirit. What you strive for, what your heart is really into, what you fight for, and wake up for everyday, especially what you choose to do with your life with pure passion. That‚Äôs a self made man. But, I do see and understand what you were saying and how you meant it. It‚Äôs kinda like a ken doll situation.. especially with packers imo hahah.  i have a small collection of em lmfaoo.

idk I love being trans and I&#39;m very proud of myself and my body but I sure as hell would swap out my body if that magically became an option just for the sake of not dealing with the pain, expense, and lost time of phallo. We are talking tens of thousands of dollars WITH insurance and 2 years (if not more) of surgery after surgery like....c&#39;mon. No offense but I think that&#39;s a pretty easy opinion to have when you&#39;re pre-everything. I wouldn&#39;t take back a single damn thing I&#39;ve done for myself and my transition, but if the option was there I can&#39;t imagine many trans people who have actually been through multiple stages not understanding why 99.9% would take the magic swap.
