So as the title says, i had my 1st revision surgery with Dr Schaff in Germany last month (February 20th) and i am slightly happy with the results, but also very annoyed and dissappointed with some parts of it that are very asymmetrical and painful. As you can see in the pictures where i have spread legs (and even the ones where i close my legs) my right labia minora and right side of the clitoris is basically protruding out so much that my labia cant cover my clitoris. This of course means i have a whole lot of pain and i think it kinda looks awful and not very attractive. Other than that my dilation has been *fine-ish* i cant use the biggest dilator, but have been working up to using the middle size one regularly. Penetration hurts quite a bit initially (it has like a stinging feeling at the entrance) which sucks, but i guess its possible to live through it.
</p>
<p>
I really hope it&#39;s all gonna improve as i heal more, but i&#39;m really not optimistic about it since most of the swelling seems to have gone down and the asymmetry isn&#39;t really changing that much anymore. It&#39;s obviously really early, but i&#39;m not really expecting to get to a point where i feel satisfied with how it looks + feels (the pain is easily the worst part) which just sucks. During my consultation with Dr Schaff about the revision he was really rushed and basically saw how my clit was very skewed to one side and said something along the lines of &#34;We can change that in the surgery no problem&#34; which i of course took as a sign that it would be relatively easy, but as of now i think i only have seen very marginal improvement to the asymmetry (if any at all).
</p>
<p>
Anyway, i&#39;m fucking traumatized as hell from this whole process and just feel horrible about it all. Hopefully it gets better or whatever and if it doesn&#39;t i guess i&#39;ll come back in 3 months to figure out how im gonna fix it in yet another revision surgery (probably by someone else, if possible). Please don&#39;t take this as a formal review or something cause i just feel bad right now and wanna complain about my shitty body. I didn&#39;t die or have any actual major complications, which is nice i guess.

Ciswoman here, I think she looks pretty darn cis. All of our girls are different, they come in all shapes and sizes and colors, no matter what designer vaginas would have us believe. I think you’re beautiful.

I just want to say dont focus to much on symetry. Humans are generally not perfectly symetric. Boobs, Noses, Hairline, Dicks, Vulvas al come in different asymeteical shapes.
</p>
<p>
If you need to consult another surgeon for making it less asymetric, but dont get obsessed with symetry. I&#39;ve seen enough vulvas in my life to know your one does look perfectly normal, even when its not perfectly symetric, it doesnt need to. A little flappy Minoras who are not completly inside the Majoras is btw also a perfectly normal thing that also exists in cis woman.

Are you kidding? She&#39;s

<p>
The entrance thing will go away with time; labia is a complete non-issue. This am I&#39;ve seen 3 surgical results that were... Let&#39;s call them &#34;beginner-grade&#34;, and their owners are distressed.  Your results are

amazing!

I&#39;m sorry for your ongoing pain, can you at least orgasm? Try to consult different doctor. Also, it doesn&#39;t look bad so that&#39;s positive.

Sorry to hear that this whole process has been so tough for you! I&#39;m at six weeks post op and can definitely understand some of the frustration. Personally, I think your results look super beautiful tho!

As a physician with 40 years’ experience doing pelvic exams, I have to say I’m rather respectfully blown away by your remarkable results. Really scratching my head to find incision lines, scars, etc. Visually, your result is far beyond I think most people’s.
</p>
<p>
That your vulva looks natural, cis-, and beautiful, of course, does not resolve your physical discomfort.  In the course of my practice, I’ve had innumerable cis- women who had marked vulvar physical discomfort, for a variety of reasons, vaginal/clitoral/vulvar dryness being probably near the top of the list, regardless of age.
</p>
<p>
As women mature, of course, vaginal dryness is one of the things that often comes with age and the fluctuating hormone levels. However, in younger women, it’s not uncommon that one or both of the labia majora don’t fully cover the labia minora, or clitoris. Once upon a time there really wasn’t much to do about that, and, yes, in time you can become accustomed to it, and the discomfort will dissipate, especially if you regularly use a vulva-safe moisturizer, but surgical techniques are such now that it can be a quick and relatively easy outpatient procedure to repair.
</p>
<p>
As for the asymmetry, other than the physical discomfort you’re experiencing, I would encourage you to joyfully celebrate the crazy, wonderful, lopsided magnificence you’ve created. Truly, you have an absolutely beautiful surgical result, especially at 10 months postop. We are all marvelously asymmetrical. I have a perky boob, and I have a droopy boob. Would I like them to both be perky? Of course, and I may well do something about it at some point. But I can guarantee no one else has boobs just exactly like mine!
</p>
<p>
I hope you resolve your physical discomfort. I think that’s well within the realm of probability, even if it does require a(nother)relatively minor nip and tuck. As to your seeming sense of vulvar imperfection, I can only say that I envy your result with all my heart!

I&#39;m sorry for the annoyance and pain. As for the clittoral pain or the stinging, I cannot speak to that.
</p>
<p>
But honestly I think the vagina looks amazing 🥰 I have never seen a symmetrical cis vagina. I don&#39;t think people expect them to look symmetrical.

I would recommend you to go for an appointment with another surgeon. It does look like something was made differently with your right labia minora, was there any wound dehiscence or anything else? Is it loose skin you can move easily over the part of your kilt?

It looks damn near perfect. The pain will subside the way pain does throughout the body: the exposed parts will toughen up a bit just to deal with the day to day. This is also the whole theory behind dilation, or getting up to walk asap after a leg injury/surgery.
</p>
<p>
The more you patiently do now, without overdoing it, the better the longterm results will be. But jeeez that looks incredibly cis! I would hop a plane now if a surgeon could guarantee I’d wind up with that beauty!

Schaff really became old, it&#39;s not my taste of vulva/vagina The clitoris looks kinda off and the top of the left labia minora somehow weird
</p>
<p>
Maybe some surgeon can fix your issue
</p>
<p>
He was rushing the consultation like my surgeon Dr. T from South Germany and he also failed me, disappointing that&#39;s a common behaviour for surgeons.
