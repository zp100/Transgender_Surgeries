Hi everyone!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I went to my first consultation for FFS with Dr. Macía. We talked about what to do and what not and overall I&#39;m pretty convinced to go with him. This is what I&#39;ll have done:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Frontoplasty: He&#39;ll lower my hairline about two fingers, I think that&#39;ll be enough and won&#39;t need hair transplant, round the forehead and lift the end of my eyebrows.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Rhinoplasty: The technique he use (ultrasonic?) is not as invasive as the tradicional ones (as he explained), after the surgery I&#39;ll have two small bandages on the sides and a splint over the bridge (don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the word, english is not my first language), and few stitches on the base of the nose (between the nostrils). His results are reaaaally good and I think here is where he&#39;s more confident. He&#39;ll focus first on functionality and the aesthetic, I have 0 worries. Also I asked him because when I smile I saw a lot of gum, he told me that with rhinoplasty we can lower the lip like a 10% or so? He saw me some results with that, the change was small but noticeable.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Mentoplasty: Small changes here as you can see, I&#39;ll just have some save on my jaw and a pointier chin.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Other questions I asked him:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Rhinoplasty won&#39;t change my voice, is a very rare outcome.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s made about 400 frontoplasties and only had one case of shockloss around the scar. No dent cases apparently.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll leave the simulation he made. What are your thoughts? Total price will be 20K
