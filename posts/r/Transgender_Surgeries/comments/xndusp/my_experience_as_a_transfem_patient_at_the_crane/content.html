TL; DR: Min Jun might be a great doctor. The rest of the Crane Center is unprofessional af.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I am not a native speaker of English, but I will be trying my best to make this post as clear as possible to help any of you prepare or plan to have surgery with Dr. Jun at the Crane Center.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Both my partner and I are transfem students fascinated by Dr. Jun&#39;s technique and appearance. Since we are in California, we ultimately chose him and the Crane Center for our surgery. We waited around half a year, then we were informed that there are two cancellation spots available. From the intake to the actual surgery dates, it took roughly a year.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
However, trouble came with the insurance. We both have Anthem Blue Cross (Platinum plan equivalency), and that is a self-pay plan through my partner&#39;s affiliation. We later were informed that the administration of the Crane Center can be sometimes unprofessional from a friend. It was unprofessional indeed.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
My insurance requires pre-authorization to be submitted at least a month ago before the surgery date, and the Authorizations team at the Crane Center did submit them a month ago. No issue. However, problems arise when my insurance denies the first claim due to an issue with one of my medical provider&#39;s letters.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
In Anthem at least, there&#39;re two types of things patients can do after a denial: Peer-to-Peer conversation, and Appeals. The first is through the Pre-Authorization department in Anthem, and the second is through the Grievances &amp; Appeals department. The two departments also have two working styles: in the Peer-to-Peer team, they are responsible for setting up a meeting with a Medical Director at Anthem and a doctor at the provider.  They are pretty friendly and responsive to work with. On the other hand, the Appeals team at Anthem is who you might not want to work with: damn slow, and always giving useless information.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Usually, as a patient in California, and at this point, there&#39;s nothing I can do other than submitting an Internal Appeal request through Anthem or submitting an External Review request through either the Department of Insurance or the Department of Managed Health Care, whichever manages the insurance if a final denial was received or haven&#39;t received anything for 30 days. However, for the Crane Center, they can choose to submit a Peer-to-Peer conversation request, submit an Appeal Request on behalf of them, or both.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The people at the Crane Center chose to do neither. They did complete a Peer-to-Peer conversation with my insurance, and the Medical Director requested a letter containing more information. The insurance also promised to reply the same day after we update them with the materials. I updated Crane Center with a revised referral letter the next day, and that was
<em>
a month
</em>
before my surgery. I also submitted a patient Appeal Request for myself. Plot twist: the Crane Center sent the new documents to a completely wrong department: the Appeals team at Anthem.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
According to Anthem, their Peer-to-Peer department is supposed to return with a result within 15 days, and 30 days for non-emergent pre-authorization Appeals. However, I then spend my whole month trying to figure out why the hell nothing reached me or the Crane Center. Until 2 business days prior to my surgery, we luckily found the phone line for the Peer-to-Peer department that was supposed only for the providers to call. We called them, explained everything, and told them we were patients wondering about the results. It was at that point that my partner and I realized Crane Center submitted nothing to the Peer-to-Peer team at Anthem.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Things did end in a good way, as we faxed Anthem the updated letters that day and received approval the next day, and that was a Friday afternoon. My surgery was literally on the next Monday. Given we have already paid 4k for a month&#39;s stay in the Bay, that was pure good luck.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
My partner also experienced a similar situation when she saw my case was denied. Her surgery date was 2 months after mine, so she had enough time to revise all her letters to follow our insurance&#39;s requirements. Similarly, Crane Center managers showed their unprofessionalism by NOT submitting my partner&#39;s updated letters, but her obsolete letters instead. Guess what? Yet another denial.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Not to say that the Austin, TX Office had a really
<em>
really
</em>
bad attitude toward us. They forced us to do weekly Zoom meetings with them instead of calling because they think &#34;we are calling too much&#34;. Supposedly they do understand how their
<em>
in-network
</em>
insurance operates (they really just take a few insurances so that&#39;s not that hard right?) and don&#39;t force us to train ourselves to be Patient Coordinators, we wouldn&#39;t have given them a single call. The California people were pretty chill though, but I highly recommend anyone planning or having conversations with either of them, know what they are doing. Because they clearly
<strong>
do not do their jobs well
</strong>
.

Thanks for the read. And hope y&#39;all have a great day.

It&#39;s insurance. Anything to prevent from having to pay for a procedure.  My insurance denies denies denies, in hopes you go away. There is no way an approval will happen, as once you meet all the requirements, more requirements magically appear. There isn&#39;t a Dr. or facility that would take my insurance anyway, with the track record they have. It&#39;s extremely frustrating.

I feel like they were better a few years ago when I used them. Maybe they overturned staff?
