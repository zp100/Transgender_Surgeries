Previous post
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/sz614t/bluebond_srs_day_5">here</a>
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask any questions. I got a lot of value out of other people&#39;s posts in the past, so happy to provide the same.
</p>
<p>
On my discharge day I developed a big ol hematoma in my right labia that caused a ton of pain. At my initial follow ups everything seemed perfect (their words) and like things were going well. Eventually the hematoma forced its way through the sutures though, which dehisced the majority of that side. It started off relatively contained and then became huge over about two days. Dr Zhao gave me a call on the weekend to reassure me and told me &#34;I look at that wound, and I think it looks pretty good&#34;. That calmed my nerves. Spent a lot of time searching for &#34;dehiscence&#34; and &#34;second intention&#34; at this point. From what I can see it&#39;s common to an extent, but this level seems relatively rare.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s definitely a marked difference at this point where I went from being told how good everything looked, to everyone beginning conversations with &#34;just know this will heal&#34;.
</p>
<p>
At my two weeks post-discharge follow up today, Dr Bluebond was able to remove a ton of clots from the outside and inside, as well as remove a bunch of stitches. This resulted in a pretty good comfort increase. Prior to that I was likening the inside to a brambly forest with all the stitches.
</p>
<p>
They have me applying aquacel to both stitch lines on my labia, and a pocket internally where a hematoma did some work. Every time I need to pee I get to take all three off and put them back on, which can be pretty gnarly as they get saturated pretty quickly. Just annoying.
</p>
<p>
Another annoying thing is finding long enough overnight pads. Since I&#39;m laying down basically full time I need the extra length. The best ones I found so far were the Rael ones, though I also tried Cora and Seventh Generation. The Rael ones are significantly longer than either. I&#39;ll be trying some period panties from thinx and saalt when I get home, which I had already planned on and then bluebond also suggested thinx when I asked. We&#39;ll see how that goes.
</p>
<p>
So overall it&#39;s pretty tough mentally, just because it&#39;s so uncomfortable and will be for quite some time. I&#39;ll also be making a sooner return visit in person at the six week mark (instead of waiting until the 3 month mark as originally planned) to make sure everything is going okay. I was also planning on taking off six weeks of work originally, but it seems likely I will need to take off up to six additional weeks.
</p>
<p>
Activity wise I&#39;m able to walk around with only some discomfort. I&#39;ve been walking around the neighborhood and visiting shops, taking the ferry and walking to appointments without issue. I got to go see the final performance of The Hang at HERE, which was fantastic but was definitely pushing it for me to sit down straight up in a chair for two hours. It&#39;s super queer, highly recommend going if it gets another run.
</p>
<p>
Still absolutely no regrets about any of it though. Everyone involved in my care has been great. Both of the surgeons and all of the nurses really seem to give a shit and care about you. From what I understand it&#39;ll still heal fine, it&#39;s just a longer more uncomfortable road to get there. Can&#39;t recommend going to Bluebond enough.

Oh cool! 10-12 weeks sounds mentally intimidating but it&#39;s great to hear I&#39;m not alone and that it went well for you

Not medical advice, but you may want to look into the studies showing high levels of Vitamin C intake. Your body uses a lot of it post surgery.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Aquacell is also used in cases to help things heal along.
</p>
<p>
PS. You will heal fine!

Yep! I should have brought this up but you were not the first one to raise this with me. The team emphasized protein intake as well

Great! Yes, protein is another one. It’s pretty amazing how much minerals and vitamins becomes essential during the months following GCS.
</p>
<p>
I’d also add, research if taking a probiotic regularly is ideal for you (again not medical advice). Research on overall effects on health is astonishing. Also, due to taking antibiotics during and after GCS, it’s harsh on our systems. Plus, that area will need as much “friendly bacteria”, and the byproducts they produce, during the healing—and possibly for the many years to come.
</p>
<p>
Good luck. You got this! They’re an incredible team.

Normally , you leave it open and use local wound care.  This allows it to heal by secondary intention.

Did your right labia need stitches when that wound opened?

No and my understanding is that it&#39;s not common to restitch them once they open up either (both from talking with Dr Google and Dr Bluebond)

Once the wound opens it is no longer sterile, so if they close it the wound has a high likelihood of developing an infection. Open wounds don’t typically develop an infection so long as they are kept clean.

Just curious is there a plan for closing the wound? Butterfly bandages maybe? Or is it likely to fix itself? Just wanted to throw out there that it looks great side from the wound on the right labia. I hope my someday vagina looks like a healed up version of yours.

Typically with wound separation they just leave it alone and it closes on its own. Kinda weird, but I had big spots of wound separation and the body just eventually heals it
