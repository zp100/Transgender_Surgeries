Had surgery with Bélanger in Montréal about 3 months ago followed by major complications - - infection followed by substantial tissue loss around the labia majora. I&#39;m actually very surprised at how well, at least comparatively, everything has healed given the way things looked two months ago (I have photos that look far worse than anything I&#39;ve seen on here). That said, I&#39;m looking into revisions to (a) remove the loose flap of skin on the upper left side of the labia majora (from where there was major separation); (b) reduce fairly tough scar tissue around the vaginal opening and ideally cover up the opening a little more; (c) separate and define the labia minora which are sort of fused together below the clitoris.
</p>
<p>
I was initially supposed to return to Montreal for an urgent revision but turned out to heal well enough on my own that it seemed best to wait until things had healed and settled fully. I could still probably return to Montreal and have it paid by Canadian health insurance but am a bit wary of them after my experience - - they seem like very good surgeons but frankly negligent in follow up - - and am curious about if anyone has any specific recommendations for US surgeons particularly skilled at revision. It&#39;s basically aesthetic at this stage - - the internal graft took very well, no problems urinating, sensation is all there, albeit still returning.
</p>
<p>
Tldr: best US surgeons for revision after mixed experience in Montreal.

And if you have depth problems, the PAI Clinic is well known for Colovaginoplasties and they are very good and Dr Kamol practices the peritoneal technique

Thanks. No depth problems and would def prefer to stay in N America. What&#39;s your reservation re Bowers? Do you have any opinion on Wittenberg, whom people seem to think very highly of?

Dr. Wittenberg is very good, Dr. Bowers ruined a girl&#39;s vulva that&#39;s why I distrust her, you go with the one you have more confidence

I also recommend you for revision surgery to dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner is very good and also practicing the peritoneal technique and has a very good reputation, and a question: Why not consider going to Thailand? it is very popular and also has the best surgeons for this procedure

If you are young, try to go to Thailand-this is going to be for the rest of your life so go for the best. If you are older, (more difficult to travel and get away) would try McGinn or Meltzer.  In revisions, I think experience counts.  McGinn rarely seems to have troubles and Meltzer does a two step srs with the second step being labiaplasty and cleaning up any issues.

Well, surgeons from the United States would recommend only Dr. Christine McGinn and Dr. Marci Bowers (but personally I would avoid her), and from Thailand to Dr. Kamol or any PAI surgeon (Preecha Aesthetic Institute and from there are Doctors Burin and Sutin )
