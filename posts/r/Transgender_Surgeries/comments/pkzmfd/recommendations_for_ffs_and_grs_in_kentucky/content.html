Currently looking at getting FFS soon, followed by GRS after doing laser treatments a bit over a year now for hair removal on both areas.
<br>
So far within the kentucky area, my Endo has recommended
<br>
- Dr. Banis Plastic Surgery (FFS)
<br>
- Dr. Tathyana Fensterer (FFS)
<br>
- Jonathan Witten (GCS)
</p>
<p>
Out of curiosity, has anyone worked with these doctors and has reviews or experiences with them, or have other recommendations of good work done within the kentucky area? Worst case I have to fly out, and I&#39;m not entirely against that, I&#39;m just working within current standings.
<br>
(Also if there&#39;s any reviews on Seattle Voice Lab as I&#39;ve been looking for a vocal coach for a while.)

I apologize. I assumed you were from Kentucky when you said local. I should have asked. Well, anyway, we will have a trans summit at the Highlands in Louisville, KY Nov 13. All doctors, surgeons, endocrinologists, psychotherapists that have been involved in trans care will be there answering common questions. I personally think it is an unique opportunity to have providers that are so hard to reach located in only one place answering questions. I will get more detail of the schedule for you.

It got canceled bc of COVID :(. The new date will be March. I don&#39;t think anyone from UK was going. They were having a problem putting the team together. I should contact them and invite them to he part of our provider group.

Avoid Dr. Fox if you can help it. I saw Durham-Scott at the same practice and he did a fantastic job on me but I&#39;d have to see his FFS results, I just know he does it as well. He had an excellent bedside manner, explained everything well to me, and he takes some insurance.

my body contouring with durham was less than pleasant. totally fucked it up. the breast augment i had tho was phenomenal, 700 cc mentor implants =:) went from B-DD OVERNIGHT. DR FENSTERER is no longer performing FFS in the louisville metropolotian area. from what i was told it was because of insurance coverage failure issues and the practice was not to keen to wanting to have to fight to get the approvals that were not 100% guaranteed. apperently ate up alot of staff time that wasnt getting re compensated for. also there is another doctor here and im getting to see her for my FFS/trach shave if your willing to travel to lexington. uk turfland has ms. nakita gupta. she worked with people up at mt sinai in new york. might be your best chance locally. they do file insurance.

This is Dr Fensterer and I would like to comment about the above note. I am no longer working at Dr Banis office due to a disagreement with transgender care. However, I was invited to join Baptist Health care and I will resume transgender care January of 2022. This includes FFS/trach shave, top surgery and body contouring. Dr Witten will keep doing  vaginoplasty procedures, since he is doing a great job. I will be linked to Baptist Health care and this means I will be accepting all insurances. Just a reminder, not all procedures are covered by insurances but we have been working on that.  We are setting the E-town office for the trans community so I would just ask patience because I we will start from zero, again...  And yes, I have a lot of interest in the trans community so I always read what the patients are writing so I can improve myself too.

Thanks for your work. I reviewed the rule. Thank you. I have been working with trans for 20 years since I was a plastic surgeon in Brazil. I came to US and re did the whole residency. I am very active with the community locally and patients love me but I have a personal rule to not advertise. I think if you need to advertise your work, you are not good.  However, I needed to correct the post. I am between jobs and my previous boss cancelled all my trans surgeries and gave an untruthful reason. I  am resuming my activities in January of 2022 and now I will be able to see medicaid and all other insurances that I couldn&#39;t. I don&#39;t mind answering medical questions but so won&#39;t give my opinion beyond that.

You&#39;re welcome to post here. There&#39;s a few other doctors/surgeons who do occasionally and I&#39;m sure you can help people. I collect informative posts/comments in the wiki here as well to try accumulate the knowledge.

<p>
What do you mean? How are you active?
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re currently the only FFS surgeon I have listed in Kentucky so I expect you&#39;ll get quite a lot of interest. Lots of people don&#39;t like to travel.

I go to the trans group meetings on the weekends, give them presentations, I go to hospitals and clinics to give grand rounds to educate about trans surgeries and how to address them properly. We do have a monthly meeting with all providers, Endo, peds, psych,, ENT,  uro, internal med, gyn and I to discuss about the program and to refer patients to each other. I write to the local medical magazine about trans patients. We will have a summit this month and I will be there to talk to patients. Currently in Louisville, we offer most of the surgeries, face, tracheal shaving, voice, top and bottom through different providers and practices and we all accept all insurances. We are happy to do through insurance if it is part of the plan.  If you have anyone local, just send to uofl trans studies that they will refer the patient to the correct provider. One of the reasons I got my job is bc of work I do w the  trans community. The only surgery we don&#39;t offer is the F to M  bottom bc it is a surgery w not good outcome.

I have not been associated with the Louisville area trans community meetings for over a decade now, even though I was 1 of the 3 founders of the first local group in the early 90s.
</p>
<p>
Are any of your local presentations, such as the one this week or on Nov. 13, open to the public ?
</p>
<p>
I ask as I finally may have the resources to have FFS and rejuvenating surgeries and plan to consult with several surgeons including you now that I am aware of your practice.

Yes, I will be there on a stand to answer anyone&#39;s questions. I will show how we are using 3-D printings for FFS.  You know that insurance might cover some of those procedures, right? I at least try to make them cover the bony portion. Now that I am with a larger health system, I will have more help negotiating with insurances. This week I am in Brazil presenting what I have been doing and checking what they have been doing.

Not sure where or when &#34;there on a stand to answer anyone&#39;s questions&#34; is.
</p>
<p>
Should I call somewhere to find out ?
</p>
<p>
Or are you allowed to say here when &amp; where ?

dr durham is located in the same office as dr fox at ky plastics on 4001 Kresge way. lou ky. across from babpist hospital. word of warning to all those who decide on these two. ask ?s and do your research first. dr fox has had a sour reputation towards the transgender community in the past and has stirred alot of backlash over things. my advice is do the reading and judge for yourself.
