Hi all!
</p>
<p>
I have my FFS with Facial Team in booked in June. I&#39;m really excited!
</p>
<p>
In some ways now seems to be a good time to have surgery as I can recover while working from home in peace and quiet when not much is going on. On the other hand is does add a quite a bit of complexity and worry.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has gone through FFS during covid could you please let me know what your experience was like? Did everything seem safe? Was it easy to arrange PCR Covid tests? Were lots of places closed etc?
</p>
<p>
Thank you!
</p>

Thank you for your answer! That makes a lot of sense. I&#39;m glad they arrange the tests when we are in Spain.
</p>
<p>
Is it OK if I ask you again, say in early April? :)
</p>
<p>
I feel a bit like an information sponge at the moment, I&#39;m trying to learn as much as I can.

You are lucky, cause I have some really fresh info for you! I had ffs surgery a week ago and I’m still in Marbella, flying back home in two days. First of all, everything seemed safe, there were no incidents that raised my eyebrows. They did covid pcr on me during preop, and it obviously needs to come up negative. If you are staying in la villa marbella, they are very serious about covid protocols and very nice too. I will also have another pcr done tomorrow during my sutures removal, you dont need to arrange it, it’s done automatically, and they give you a certificate needed for travel. Its free for you, but you will need to pay if you need one for your companion. I also needed an extra rapid antigen test 4 hours before flight and they arranged it too without any issues. There is a curfew after 10 pm and I didnt really want to risk anything so I wasnt wandering around the city. So I dont know what places are closed or open. I ordered food to my room everyday from local restaurants and a hotel employee brought it to me, always wearing a face mask. And you’ve probably read thousands of testimonies already, but I just want to add that they did a really good job and I would pick them again if I could. I tried to be thorough, but if you have any other questions, feel free to ask me!

It will be the UK for me.
</p>
<p>
Was it a Visa or Covid paperwork that you needed from the consulate? AFAIK you are free to travel at the moment there are the moment as long as you have a recent PCR test but I could be totally wrong.

I&#39;m probably not representative but that is because it took me so long to put the money together, not their waitlist.
</p>
<p>
I had a face-to-face consultation back in 2018 in London which was really useful, I got an email with a quote about a week after. I needed time to save more and I have financial commitments so I couldn&#39;t move it forward until a few months ago. I arranged a skype consultation (mostly because it had been a long time since the one in 2018 and I had forgotten alot!) and got another quote.
</p>
<p>
Just before I booked my surgery date I asked how long the waitlist was and I was told that they were offering dates from the following month for most people but it was a 2 month wait for UK patients because of the travel restrictions.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure how often they run the consultations but at the moment I think you possibly get a surgery date only a month or two afterwards. Their waiting list might be shorter at the moment due to the pandemic.

I went in December. I think pandemic is good time for the recovery, you can hide away and heal while not missing out on much. The is additional travel complexity though which can be stressful. I suspect the travel to and from Spain well be the most complex bit in relation to covid.

At the end of January, but as far as I understood there’s not a real waiting list at the moment, you  just propose them a date or month and they tell you the availability. I booked the end of May simply because I couldn’t earlier (and because is a symbolic date for me) ;)

Are you in northern or southern France? Just to understand if you would travel by plane. I don’t know if things changed in the last few weeks but for ground transportation in January you shouldn’t even had to show a PCR test to enter Spain
