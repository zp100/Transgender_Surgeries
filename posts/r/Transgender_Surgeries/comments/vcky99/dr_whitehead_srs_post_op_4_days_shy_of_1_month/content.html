I have my consult with him next week. Anything you would advise to a future patient?

Ask as many questions during your consult as possible and don’t be afraid to speak up if something is bothering you. You will get push back but they are there to help you. The surgery itself went okay for me, no complications, but I barely have any depth despite having ample tissue to create depth. If that’s important to you make sure that you address it. Best of luck ❤️❤️❤️

Thank you!! Did he say why only minimal depth? I have to say, I’ll be be pretty devastated if I can’t have sex with my husband post op.

He advised me to only dilate with my finger because I was bleeding and he couldn’t tell where I was bleeding from. At this point I had about 2 dots on my dilator which is like 4ish inches. And I lost depth when I did that over 2 days. I didn’t have much depth to begin with but I felt like I took his advice when I shouldn’t have. I should have dilated anyway.

Yet when I woke up from surgery the nurse said I had 5 inches of depth. I think they were exaggerating so maybe I felt better. But it came across as not being truthful later. Idk

I’m glad you are well. Where does this Doctor operate out of?
</p>
<p>
How did you find and decide to go with this doctor? Has he performed SRS/GCS before? Is this a typical result?

I decided to go with Dr Whitehead primarily because my insurance was willing to work with them and he’s the closest doctor to me that I liked as far as aesthetics. If I would have had all the money in the world I probably would have gone with Bluebond Langner, because I probably would have gotten more depth. My current depth is only 3.5 and I was pretty well endowed before surgery. I might get a revision with a peritoneal flap later to get more depth if I can afford to.

This is a typical result for where I’m at in healing. I messaged them this same picture on Monday and they said I’m healing pretty well
