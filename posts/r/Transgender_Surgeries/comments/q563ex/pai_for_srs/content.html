I have scheduled my SRS with PAI Dr. Burin. May I ask you what are the issues you had after the surgery? At least, a girl whom I know had no major complications at all after Dr. Burin&#39;s surgery last year.

Thank you for sharing. I’m so sorry that PAI treated you so cruelly and for the suffering you’ve experienced as a result. I hope you are able to get a good revision soon. May I ask what year you had surgery with them?

Other than anesthetics, any major complications you have experienced?

Apart from the problems with aesthetics (which in my point of view is not so bad, I have seen worse results from American surgeons, and with a labiaplaatia it can be easily fixed) you have experienced some other type of complications

I am very sorry, sorry for my lack of tact, I did not know that you had such a bad experience with PAI and I am very sorry for it (thank you very much for your experience, it was very helpful), I am now beginning to doubt whether to go with them for my vaginoplasty (if I go it would be with Dr. Sutin), I hope that very soon their functional and aesthetic problems will be fixed (I recommend some surgeons so that you have your revision surgery: Dr. Christine McGinn, Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Heidi Wittenberg are the best fixing SRS problems), in advance I want to apologize if I make you feel bad, it was not my intention.

I get the impression that Objective Database may be affiliated with P.A.I ... i cant imagine why theyd leave comments like this otherwise. But this post has at least given others a good insight into their clinic. Good and bad. Thanks again for sharing your experience and wishing you all the positive vibes

Thank you so much for your reply. And so sorry to hear about your experience with them. I think ill definitely be avoiding them also, as my intuition did give me the same vibe. Thanks again lovely, your a life saver

Remember that no surgeon is 100% perfect, they are human beings and have mistakes, even the surgeons who are known as &#34;the best in the world&#34; have had not so good results, and with respect to the organization, P.A.I has been very professional with me (I still don&#39;t have my GCS), and with girls and non-binary people who have come with them and have very good results and they told me that their postoperative care and the way of organization they handled with them have been very good.

They were epic when I went years ago. Dr. Sutin is quiet, reserved, caring and a love. If Bune is still there, he will be your laisson and he is a love too.

My first choice was Suporn. He was taught by Preecha originally but went out on his own and changed the methodology to a degree. In the end, his wait was over a year and his price 6k more so I ended up @ PAI. Afterwords, I never regretted it. I can&#39;t speak for now, but back then, the personalized service I received was the difference in being a stress case or relaxed. The whole surgery is stressful enough without making logistics a problem too. Picked up and taken to and from the Airport as well as every appt. I had including the surgery itself and taken to the grocery store whenever I needed. All part of my up front cost. Good luck to you on whatever you choose!

They&#39;re about 10K U.S. all inclusive for modified P.I. with a standard 5 day hospital stay.  The hospital and staff of nurses were all 1st class. The best experience of my &#34;transition&#34; that I can remember. :-)

Ok, thanks. Are you sure surgery will perform by Dr Sutin?  I send an e-mail last Friday to have a quote.  I must find other results from p.a.i. to be sure to make the good choice

There were three when I went. Sutin an Burin were Dr. Preecha&#39;s workhorses and both are very good at what they do. I have about 5.5 inches in depth, good aesthetics, zero issues and mind blowing orgasms. So I got my moneys worth and then some. Whatever you do, find a surgeon with good consistent results that has had a lot of surgeries. Practice makes perfect when they prove they have the skills... first. You want to be just another routine procedure

My quote was $13,000 AUD. Which is 3,000 less then other quotes ive recieved. Hopefully girls who have had SRS through P.A.I can share their experiences too help me chose. I also recommend requesting a quote also, so you can get a feel for their clinic and see what they require apart from payment Thanks

I have not gone personally (they are on my short list for my SRS), but I know some girls who have gone to PAI who have had very good results, I have seen results from Dr. Sutin and Dr. Burin and they are very good (with certain aesthetic differences), there is no doubt that if you go with them you will be in very good hands.

Thanks for sharing this. Yes they seem very professional. Im just waiting covid restrictions to ease before booking. As  id rather not spend an additional 9 days in hotel quarantine. Hopefully more girls share their experiences to help me make my decision

Note that they are somewhat old and have made improvements in their technique (and the photos are very good in case), each surgeon: Dr. Sutin and Dr. Burin have their own technique for creating the vulva and its finer elements
