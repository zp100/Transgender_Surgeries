The lesson here is that surgery is not entirely safe, and shouldn&#39;t be undertaken lightly or without due
<del>
dare
</del>
care. Death is rare, but there&#39;s plenty of complications and some of them are bad. As far as I&#39;m aware this will be the first in Thailand, 3 in USA, 2 in Europe.

<p>
I keep track of deaths from trans surgeries in the wiki here.

The death rate from BBL is far higher.

actually i happened to know what happen...if this is the same japanese i heard and saw...
</p>
<p>
If this is her here is the story...
</p>
<p>
She is a dr bank patient(went to them thru japanese agent)and after post op my guess is 3-4 weeks or less?she went to yanhee for breast augmentation....and the funny part is this agent also works with kamol hospital and managed to get her to stay in kgarden after BA...she was found dead in the morning by the cleaning staff....this news is actually spreading around in the chinese trans circle...and what i heard also was the agent told her was safe to do BA then?

This is what I’ve heard in Japanese community as well. The cause of death was pulmonary thrombosis. It is said that she didn’t report chronic  conditions to the agent or the doctor. You mustn’t hide the info from your doctor out of fear of being rejected from the surgery really.

every surgery carries risk..even a normal non trans related surgery can give you hell if there is complications...just like you say...be honest with your dr or agent..

It’s hard to say. Surgery is surgery, and people can and do do die from breast implants even in the US. Maybe something was done wrong, or maybe the patient had a blood clot or a bad reaction to a drug that would’ve happened no matter where she was. It’s impossible to translate the tweet so I can’t read it. Just a reminder to pick a very experienced surgeon and be mindful of the fact that the consent forms and the risks they discuss aren’t imaginary or theoretical; It’s rare, but sometimes the worst does happen. People don’t just die from surgery in Thailand, people die from surgery no matter where they are. There must not be a rush to judgment or an attempt to blame the doctor without more information.

Really weird framing of the post to imply that Thailand is dangerous for SRS when it&#39;s the US that has had 3 deaths and also she had his her medical history, the post makes it extremely clear that it was due to her chronic condition

I didn&#39;t even have surgery yet, as I was on the table. The anaesthetist administered drugs, it killed me!
</p>
<p>
and I had to be resuscitated,  lucky it was successful.  That was at st John of God midland by Dr Paul Young.  2020 Oct.
</p>
<p>
So it can happen anywhere.
