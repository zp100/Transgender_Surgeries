Much much different. My doctor actually dissected my prostate and put my vaginal canal kind of in between so I guess to explain it I have like a “ ring” of sensation that I just can’t even explain how amazing it feels but my husband and I still do both but even he says he  prefers vaginal . Like one of the comments mentioned you get the sensation of the prostate as well as the clitoral stimulation and if someone hits it right it feels so amazing you can orgasm really easily , also it’s easier to relax and enjoy vaginal when you enjoy it better .

Hey can I ask you questions in DM had a consult with Figler and this is promising I wanted to know more about what he meant by making things anatmomically correct and also about aesthetics.

I&#39;m nearly 5 years post-op. I also never liked anal and while a lesbian, I do enjoy vaginal penetration with toys. It feels very different than anal. The prostate is moved to front of the vaginal canal (more like the vaginal canal is put between the prostate and rectum.) The prostate becomes the g-spot and like a cis-female can even trigger the need to pee after penetration.

Nope. Vaginal has stronger sensations in the g spot and clit (from the labia moving), and anal has stronger sensation around the sphincter with more diffuse sensations for the g spot. Being post op has actually made anal more than pleasurable than pre op for me for some reason, so both a great in their own way.

My experience is they are different.  Strangely enough, I don&#39;t really enjoy anal anymore but vaginal is OK.  YMMV.

I&#39;ve not yet had sexual intercourse since my surgery. But if it&#39;s anything similar to dilation or even masturbation, no it&#39;s completely different.
