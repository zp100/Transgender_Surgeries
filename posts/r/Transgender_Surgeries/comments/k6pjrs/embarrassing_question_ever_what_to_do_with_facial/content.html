I’m planning to switch to Dr Belanger (GRS Montréal) as my surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t done any facial electrolysis yet due to the pandemic. It’s really annoying.
</p>
<p>
I likely will get a surgery date / my surgery day before I can have first few sessions.
</p>
<p>
During first few days of post op - is it possible to shave your face? Electric razor? Facial hair is one of my horrible gd.
</p>
<p>
I freak out about that. I don’t want to be hairy after surgery. I don’t care about body hair or whatever. Just my FACE!!

It wouldn&#39;t be a problem. Shaving cream and a razor would be more complicated than an electric razor, but I don&#39;t see any reason why you can&#39;t do either from bed.

True. I just am worried about my strength and pain; might be too weak to do anything. But I think I’ll be fine.

Bodies are different, so you won&#39;t know till you know. I was starving when I woke up and ate a full meal - honestly felt pretty good until the anesthesia completely wore off. Other than that I was napping and playing around on my phone and tablet.

working as a nursing home nurse 18 months ago, shaving the clients each morning was part of my duties.  (i&#39;d use their own electric razors.  was a bit scary as some of them had sensitive skin).
</p>
<p>
since its a concern, then i&#39;d talk to the staff there about it and see how they typically take care of things.  but yeah, if i was a nurse there then ofc i&#39;d help a patient who was too tired to do it, or too tired to do it well or safely :)

I had the same worries going into it and honestly for the first couple of days, you’re going to be too exhausted to worry about it. I did have enough energy starting on day three to shave with a manual razor but it took everything out of me to do it.

This was my experience too. As I was in Montreal for my surgery I didn&#39;t manage to shave until after I walked over to L&#39;asclépiade.

I shaved the night before surgery and then shaved for the first time afterwards five days later (my usual timeline). It was fine, I planned the moment since I couldn&#39;t stand for long period of times but I had no issue otherwise. I used a razor and shaving cream.

I had no problem using an electric razor I think two days after surgery? I couldn&#39;t do much else, but I could do that. It&#39;s about the only reason I kept my electric razor.
</p>
<p>
I honestly didn&#39;t have much else to do, sitting in the room alone for 3 days (COVID restrictoins) with just a laptop. I think that was the only hygiene item I took care of in the hospital.

I shaved every morning. I used soap and warm water, which work fine, and a damp warm washcloth. I’d brought a hand mirror anyway for dilating. It wasn’t hard at all.  Don’t forget to bring some moisturizer for after shaving.

after a few years I&#39;ve largely quit worrying about my hair, I still do electrolysis when I can afford to but I&#39;ve still got 80% of my facial hair, that said, if I go a few days without shaving, it&#39;s not the end of the world, Living for myself, not the admiration of others.

Honestly answer.   For me personally, enjoy your oxycodone and know nobody is was funny see me for a few days.  Most places arnt allowing visitors right now.  I was in a hospital, nobody saw me.  Once I left the hospital I  did finally shave.  The drugs really make you care less.

I shaved w a razor the morning before surgery and then just used electric razor in my room each morning. I just had the CNA close the door in case someone walked in but I mean they knew I was trans so I think they’d be respectful. I had a good experience

I shaved sitting in my hospital bed on day 2 post-op.  Just ask your nurse for some hot water and a towel and anything else you might need, they’ll be glad to help.

threading takes forever but eliminates the problem for years. Waxing is another good option. You could try a good hand held lasor light tool. I never had a reason to use one but I know it&#39;s helped some people. It was a trans woman who told me about it.
</p>
<p>
Also just keep in mind facial hair is common in many cis women whether from pcos or genetics. My grandma had a mustache and had to shave almost every day. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this for dysphoria related reasons. If you do shave, use a softening cream. for me, applying aloe afterward minimizes the look of stubble and makes my face look even softer. And shaving with a softening shaving cream will leave your face baby smooth for a while. My razor is 5 layers but a bic one might do the trick too if the hair is pretty thin.

How about getting a full facial wax a few days before? I got them before I did laser.

<p>
LPT: Apply lidocaine cream before waxing.

I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re saying here? If you pull the hairs out with wax then laser won&#39;t do anything.

That&#39;s true.  But if you just want to avoid the need to shave while in the hospital a one time wax would carry you through the time when you can&#39;t shave.

I just remembered, I know someone who got an infection in her face by plucking hairs out before before having SRS. She had to get some antibiotics from her doctor, and was worried it would cause her surgery to get cancelled.

Waxing facial hair is not advised at all. It grows in a basket weave pattern so you can cause a bunch of damage to your skin this way.
</p>
<p>
I say just shave the night before and bring an electric razor in case you feel the need to and have the energy to.

I shaved with an electric razor.  That said, everyone that sees you on the ward will have seen other trans women post-op, and I&#39;m sure some of them had stubble too.  But I understand - this was one of my biggest fears too.  Shaving my own face was no issue with the electric razor.

You&#39;ll probably not give too much of a fuck for the couple days immediately afterwards.  I was able to shave off the facial fuzz after day two, once pain and everything started to subside.
