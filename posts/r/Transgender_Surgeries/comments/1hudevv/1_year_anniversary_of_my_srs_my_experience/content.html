Hello! The time has come, and in 3 days, it will be a year since I had my surgery. I&#39;ve been documenting here on Reddit most of my progress, problems, worries and everything else, and since I&#39;ve hit the 1 year mark I decided it&#39;s a good time for a summary of the results.
</p>
<p>
I got surgery at PAI Clinic, that&#39;s in Bangkok, with Dr. Sutin. Using the classical inversion technique, the 8th of January, 2024th
</p>
<p>
Things have been healing well. It took a while, but everything ended up nice enough.
</p>
<p>
Dilating and depth: Im currently sitting at around 5.8in/14cm of depth, with just under 5cm/or 2in of wideness. I hit this mark at around 8 months post op. This has been, very annoying... Mainly, the need for bigger dilators which seem to be rarer than tree headed horses(you most possibly won&#39;t have that problem, it&#39;s just my bf that&#39;s a bit oversized, but for the average, the ones from the clinic should be enough), i managed to find a random 42mm one and a set of 3 bigger ones form the brand vagiwell, only used two of the last ones tho.  Other than that, no complications on that front other than it being somewhat annoying. Now i dilate once around every 3 to 4 days, that works well enough for me to be able to have intercourse with no problems.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetic: I looks veeeery good, I have some photos of it here, feel free to look for them on my profile. I&#39;m very pleased with it
</p>
<p>
Complications: I&#39;ve had a few... I had the catheter for a bit more that a month due inflammation, and it was the worst thing ever. A tiny fistula. Any my nerves seem to recover at the speed of an old turtle with arthritis. Now all of that&#39;s done, but I have to say it&#39;s been scary...
</p>
<p>
Sensitivity: This has been possibly the hardest part of my recovery, since it&#39;s been a lot slower for me than what&#39;s usual. &#34;Internally&#34; it&#39;s all well, it&#39;s been like that since the beginning. But the clitoris and the surrounding zone has been a hard deal, not even a month ago I was seriously worried that I would be able to orgasm ever again... Aaaaand, today it happened for first time! (Well, first time via clitoris stimulation, getting pounded some times does the trick). Which is why I&#39;m doing the update 3 days earlier than the 1 year mark. It felt good, it was not overly hard, the main thing that&#39;s been hard for me is getting in the mood and not worrying about it, i did cheat a bit tho (all hail the Hitachi wand)
</p>
<p>
So, that&#39;s it. Challenge complete!!
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask any questions you need.

Thanks so much for sharing your experience. Did you have into stay longer in Bangkok until the catheter was able to be removed? How did you feel the clinic was at handling these complications? Iâ€™m going to Dr. Sutin this week too and nervous.

Nope, I actually flew back home with the catheter in. And got it removed around 2 weeks later (even tho nobody here wanted to actually be the one to do it, so fun fact, after a nurse deflated the baloon I removed most of it out of lack of trust lul) The complications were basically a lot of over swelling, the problem with the clinic was that when I said I couldn&#39;t pee (and that the attempt was horribly uncomfortable and painful) they didn&#39;t listen to me and told me &#34;that was normal&#34;. The moment they saw it wasn&#39;t they put the catheter back in, but it was hurting a lot by then... This happened two times and during the second time they listened better, mainly because I sounded very angry
</p>
<p>
So that... Still, don&#39;t worry too much, when they feel something&#39;s wrong, they are gonna react fast, just make sure that when something&#39;s wrong you say it with authority and a bit loud, or they&#39;re gonna pass it as the normal account of discomfort
</p>
<p>
I get this may feel scary, but this is one of those complications that are &#34;1 in a 100&#34;, and despite not being ideal, you know the way to make your point across if you think something&#39;s wrong, you&#39;ll be fine oki?
</p>
<p>
Edit:I have the entire thing documented on other posts i did regularly when i was there, in case you might find them usefull

Youâ€™re doing good then I had surgery on the 3 rd of January. They were supposed to do a vaginaplasty but one surgeon decided not to show up. So the other at least did the shallow depth to make it look like I had one. But in a year it feels fantastic but never had an orgasm. Looks good but after a year of waiting, I will finally get the vaginoplasty of my dreams which I wanted my whole life. I go for the surgery on the 13 th which is in one week.

Now Iâ€™m going to get what I wanted my whole life on Monday I got the rest of my instructions for what to do before I arrive.so this is really happening on Monday finally. Itâ€™s a shame that first doctor was like that. No reason for that. He probably should never of been a doctor doing this.here the first surgery was on January 3rd, 2024, and now the surgery is on the 1-13-2025. One year 10 days. He took away from me. But now Iâ€™ll be living my live to my fullest. Who cares about family, they gave up on me. Itâ€™s not For them, itâ€™s for me to feel tru to myself. But I have a new family. I consider everyone here, Al my LGBTQ center, and even my church. They had given me a party whe I got my new birth certificate and name change. People have been so good to me and more now than before I transistioned and now Iâ€™ll be compete and feel Iâ€™m doing what i should have my done my whole life.
