I‚Äôve heard of a couple of enby‚Äôs getting vaginoplasty and it makes me so damn happy. I‚Äôm so sick of the binary idea of transition, that you have to be someone or something specific to be trans enough to get bottom surgery, that doctors and therapists are changing their mindset of what it means to be trans. I‚Äôm so, so happy for you and your vaginoplasty looks great!

ü•πü•πü•π Thank you.
</p>
<p>
I do hate the conflation that genital dysphoria only exists with gender dysphoria. I happen to have both, but the two are on. Their own separate tracks.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned yeah I&#39;m on feminizing hormones and I refer to my pussy as a she, but I&#39;m so happy I am able to address the one while I figure out the other one.
</p>
<p>
Sure if it was still WPATH7 and I had to commit to being a girl in order to treat my genital dysphoria I would, but that wouldn&#39;t have made me happy the 30% of the time I&#39;m in a masculine experience. Instead, I can just give the HRT time to feminze as I figure out the rest, ya know.
</p>
<p>
I know plenty of people who only have genital dysphoria, so I want to do what I can to increase visibility and to help others get on the path of loving themselves. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôm FTM and post op RFF phallo, but just wanted to say congratulations and you look great!! It‚Äôs really awesome seeing plus size post op bodies. I‚Äôm not sure about vaginoplasty, but for phalloplasty surgeons can be VERY strict with BMI requirements (usually under 35 or 30, MAX) and it causes an enormous and troubling barrier for so many folks trying to access surgery. Congrats again!!!

Thank you ü•π First off, congrats to you and your journey. Vaginolplasty is rouuugh but from what I hear it pales incomparision to phallo so yeah, much respect.
</p>
<p>
Also the BMI restrictions are typically the same for vaginoplasty. My doctor, Ramineni is a real ally and believes gender affirming care shouldn&#39;t be gatekept so long as the individual can be taken cared of (in this case I&#39;m my own caretaker) and dilate, as long as we can do that and aren&#39;t like u know danger bad u healthy, he&#39;s good.
</p>
<p>
I worked very hard to get myself ready for this surgery while still holding onto me, I deserved this opportunity! And I want to do what I can to advocate for others (especially of the plus size) to have the same opportunity as I was afforded.

I&#39;m happy right where I&#39;m at and my vitals are also great right where they are at.

If there was any actual concern for my health I wouldn&#39;t have been able to recieve this surgery.

Also this response technically violates the rules.

The very last sentence of my initial post... If someone says, &#34;they enjoy their bear belly,&#34; and they are large... they don&#39;t need advice on how to lose weight.
</p>
<p>
Given how size is treated in the trans community, that is, at the very least, borderline harassment.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t report it, but please be more mindful.

Wow! I am so happy for you, and also jealous. I have extreme genital dysphoria, which is more severe than my gender dysphoria. If I were given a choice of living and presenting as male, but getting vaginoplasty, or living as a passing female, but having to keep my penis, I would take the vaginoplasty. Obviously I would like both, but the vaginoplasty would be more important. Thank you for sharing!

Yeah for me I figured my genital need was straight forward so I would push through and do that as soon as I could while I figure everything else out.
</p>
<p>
I think hormones, a fat transfer BA and a tracel shave will be all I need left.
</p>
<p>
Want to be able to present more feminine while still being able to present somewhat Masculine when I feel that. ü•∞

Thank you ü•∞
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t always like my facial hair, usually while in my feminine experience, but when I am in my masc experience, I think it looks damn cute. So i definitely can&#39;t do Lazer.
</p>
<p>
I feel similar with my bod hair so it stays as well.
</p>
<p>
My goal is to be able to present more feminine when I feel that way and to be able to slap some hair on it when I feel masc (kinda like a earlier FTM transition. Just like u know a dummy cute boy)
</p>
<p>
I love that WPATH8 allows us to distinguish between Genital and Gender dysphoria so us nonbinary folx get to walk our actual journey and not a lie ü•∞
</p>
<p>
and thank you, i actually had my surgery 2days after my bday, so this is a great year so far üòÅ

Um i have a question and it is a real serious one. How were you greenlit for the surgery?  You from my perspective seem to be overweight for GCS.  The heavier you are makes it dangerous to undergo surgery.  I had mine in thailand so im not sure about American standards.

Very overweight üòÅ 5&#39;4 330 at the time of surgery.
</p>
<p>
Dr.Ramineni is a true ally. As long as one&#39;s health is solid enough, can follow through with aftercare and dilate he&#39;s good.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m heavy but very healthy, and my pre labs were amazing (i also dropped 40 from 370 to make the surgery and aftercare easier as I expected to be my own caretaker)
</p>
<p>
The BMI restriction is strictly fatphobic as there is no coordination between BMI and rate and failure, it&#39;s only moderately more risky and negligible really. However, Ramineni isn&#39;t a teaching setting and is quick (a little over 2 hours for me), so it&#39;s very safe.
</p>
<p>
But I realize even more so than most that this is a gift, and I shall cherish it to the fullest.

Where did you get your information?  It isn‚Äôt fat phobic, the more stomach fat you have high cholesterol and breathing issues.  It is directly linked to many serious health issues and being put under anesthesia is dangerous if your lungs are not able to take in oxygen.

<p>
And you&#39;re just gonna assume all that based on BMI? That&#39;s what&#39;s fat phobic.
</p>
<p>
They could easily ask someone to do labs before rejecting them, and if the values are good, guess what... no problem üôÑüôÑüôÑ
</p>
<p>
Last I knew and from first-hand experience I will add, they don&#39;t do the surgery in the belly it&#39;s where the dick is.
</p>
<p>
Sure, there is data that suggests anesthesia for long durations is riskier but marginally. Now maybe 8 hours under isn&#39;t the way to go...but 2 hours? Is no problem.
</p>
<p>
I was 5&#39;4 330 lbs  And walking upwards to 20k steps a day (on hurt ankles), so excuse me if the idea of being locked out for just BMI makes no sense.
</p>
<p>
I was even up and about and capable of being my own caretaker that&#39;s just much better prepared to go into this surgery than most.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know many skinny people who had an easier time with recovery than me.
</p>
<p>
So yeah a BMI cutoff is fatphobic I went in well over 50BMI and am fucking glowing. I do believe BMI, being the start of a deeper conversation, is appropriate, though, but not an outright block.

That was a lot of emotional responses there.  And when you‚Äôre on the table your fat belly pushes down on your ribs and your chins on your throat making breathing more difficult.  Wouldnt a larger stomach that gets in the way of things make it difficult to perform surgery.  That is what Im thinking nothing more.

Well, it&#39;s an emotional topic.
</p>
<p>
This is an important topic  that&#39;s close to me, ya know?
</p>
<p>
And it really doesn&#39;t get in the way of much of anything. If it does, then you may have some big medical issues that need addressed. So my point is a BMI cutoff is fatphobic. It assumes too much based on 1 data point that in itself says next to nothing. The determination should be based on health unless the doctor is really unsure of their skill. If they are unsure of their skill, then yeah... they shouldn&#39;t be working on anyone, much less someone, a bit more difficult.
</p>
<p>
And if this is a skill issue, then the framing needs to be as such &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not skilled enough to perform this procedure for you&#34;

I have been in crossdressing-trans social networks for a decade and have talked to people that not even had the courage to pierce their ears.

I had a need and I wanted to be me bad enough ya know? And I decided I wasn&#39;t gonna let anything or anyone get in my way. I wasn&#39;t even privileged enough to have anyone come take care of me and even now, still by myself.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t say that as a flex...but like if you want it bad enough don&#39;t let anything fucking stop you, not even yourself.
