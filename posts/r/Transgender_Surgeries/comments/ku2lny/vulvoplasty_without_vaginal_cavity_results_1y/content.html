Overall I&#39;m not satisfied with the results (even ignoring keloids) but it&#39;s still better than having male genitalia.

The surgery was performed in Argentina by Dr. Javier Belinky (privately, without the public health system)

Would you mind adding more info to help others in the future. How much did it cost and what depth did you get? Would you recommend this surgeon to others?

Thank you. The cost of the operation was 7.5K USD. I don&#39;t have any depth, I thought it would make a dimple to give an aesthetic feel but it didn&#39;t. The hole I have at the end of my vulva (where the vaginal opening should normally be) it&#39;s where he located my urethra, so it&#39;s not anatomically correct to me, i also usually suffer from urinary discomfort. The clitoris was too big and without a hood, minor labia are very poorly defined / almost nonexistent. Also the lips are asymmetrical (one bigger and swollen than the other, it even hurts to touch). I also lost the sensation from the left side of the area (even where the leg begins), he told me that maybe it was due to a cut of the nerves during the operation. In terms of sexual sensitivity it seems to work well although I am not very interested in that at the moment. I thought that some things would improve with time but they did not, everything remained the same, the aesthetics even worsened because I developed keloids (even when I applied topical corticosteroid cream preventively) Based on my personal experience I would not recommend him, maybe I was unlucky or with complete vaginoplasty the results are different, I&#39;m not sure. It also doesn&#39;t offer free surgical reviews for complications (not even to remove my keloids, he said it would cost 200K ARS (around 2K+ USD) In theory the postoperative visits are included in the price but the last few times he wanted to charge me so I had to see him in a public hospital. The most positive thing is that there was no waiting list (I only had to wait a month, avoiding years of waiting in a public hospital), also his way of being was always kind and respectful.

Thanks, the result was not as expected but it is definitely a relief (although I still do not feel completely comfortable with my genitals).
