Thank you for the report.  I&#39;ll have to keep the surgical aspect for comparison once I&#39;ve had SRS.  But I&#39;ve had my beard completely removed and am in the process of cleaning out ears and removing eyebrows(for permanent tattoos as replacement and cleaning off my arms from backs of hands to elbows.  I&#39;m sure there are a number of numbing substances but I&#39;ve a good suggestion.  It&#39;s called by it&#39;s acronym BLT, each letter is the first name of a numbing agent Lidacane is the middle one.  Apply about an hour before the start and wrap snugly in saran wrap to get the maximum absorption into the skin.  It is a prescription item so you&#39;ll have to see your Doc.  Good luck with the hair removal and know that I envy you for having SRS out of the way.  Would you share the name of your doctor and also whether you used Medicare for the surgery?  I&#39;m 76 and keen to use Medicare which, in their manuals says they will cover along with all medications to include HRT.

I’m in Canada. It was all covered by the public health insurance. And the prescriptions were covered by my extended health insurance. Surgery was Brassard in Montreal. Good experience.

Thank you for replying.  You are to be commended for having the courage and must be one very self confident and happy lady to have followed your dream to fruition.  Know that I am proud for you and that you have provided me with greater confidence that I can and will succeed also.  If you ever &#34;winter south,&#34; I live in Sarasota, Florida and would be delighted to host a visit, an extended social visit.  Kindest regards,  Moana

Thank you Moana. Get plenty of exercise, no smoking, little or no alcohol, and balanced diet. Travel to the surgery city two days before admittance to hospital. That gives space in case there are transportation problems.
</p>
<p>
If you can afford it, take a few days in a good hotel before flying home, if possible fly business class. If you don’t get fully reclining seats, try to sit at the front bulkhead. Pet your carry-on bag against the wall and keep your legs and feet elevated. Also, the preflight lounge is comfortable and less noisy. Nice food, too. Get a wheelchair as soon as you get to the airport. If at all possible, have someone with you.

TAKE THE PAINKILLERS. DO NOT BE A TEETH GRITTER.

Pain is hard on the body and slows healing.

Well, I&#39;m a type II diabetic so alcohol is a no-no, Period!  My dad smoked when I was very young but I never developed the habit and have never been a smoker.  I am working about 50-55 hours in a 5.5 day work week.  I get lots of exercise managing an auto painting franchise.  And I will cherish and follow all the rest of your suggestions.  I&#39;m wishing I could have the surgery in New York with Blueblood and Zaio as it seems they have about the highest consistency of beautiful MtF SRS creations.  My past life had me visiting New York a minimum of 3 and up to 6 times in a year for two decades but I appreciate the place has changed considerably.  My bottom line is to find the surgeon who accepts Medicare insurance payments and has the lease possible number of disastrous efforts to create a female.  Thank you so much for writing.  Kind regards,  Moana
