After my mid-October (2020) GCS I was concerned about infection and decided to use Surgilube for dilating. Iâ€™ve been all healed up for several weeks now but I had a bunch of Surgilube left, so I kept using it. Last week I was about to run out so I started thinking about alternatives. My gf and I use Slippery Stuff for sex so I tried that.
</p>
<p>
The difference was astounding. I can now barely feel the purple dilator; the blue one is much easier and for the first time Iâ€™m making serious progress with the green one (we call it Kermit). Previously I had despaired off ever getting that one all the way in but now I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Sorry for the terrible pun.
</p>
<p>
Additionally I use much less Slippery Stuff so that even though itâ€™s about 1 1/2 times the price per ounce, itâ€™s cheaper per dilation. I get less lube mess. There  are other lubes I havenâ€™t tried but Iâ€™m amazed at how great this stuff is. If youâ€™re looking for a good lube consider it. No, Iâ€™m not on their payroll unfortunately, this is just a PSA.
</p>
<p>
I bought mine from Amazon in the 16 ounce pump bottle.
</p>
<p>
Edit for clarity: Iâ€™m talking about the Slippery Stuff gel. I havenâ€™t tried the liquid and know very little about it.

This is super helpful ty! I used aquagel medical grade lube while my incisions were healing but now that I&#39;m past that I&#39;d really love to switch to a cheaper, less messy alternative

I agree and can highly recommend it for both dilating and sex!

Slippery stuff here.  I&#39;ve tried a more organic lub and it was so watery.  I&#39;m using purple and just starting the blue dilator.  Changing my technique some so I&#39;m using a little less.  I bought two of the 32 oz pump bottles and put it in a smaller pump bottle that I use during my sessions.  Need to invest in slippery  stuff company and paper towels company. ðŸ¤£

Agreed, but the first three months it&#39;s still a better idea to use one that&#39;s bacteriostatic
