I had hybrid robotic-assisted peritoneal flap/penile inversion vaginoplasty on 12/7/2023 with Dr Rajveer Purohit at Mount Sinai in New York. I have 7.75&#34; of depth and currently using the green dilator. I had some post-op bleeding around my urethra 2 days after surgery and needed some sutures put in bed-side, plus 2 units of blood transfused. I had to go to the emergency room on Christmas Day 12/25 because of vaginal bleeding that would not stop. I spent 5 days in the hospital and needed 3 more units of blood transfused. Since leaving the hospital I have not bled any more, discharge has been minimal, and my wound separation is healing nicely (I apply manuka honey twice a day). I am super happy with the medical care I have received and with the surgical outcome. AMA !

Hybrid ppt/pi is robotic. I would assume pure ppt is also
</p>
<p>
I had mine on January 4th. They use 2, 3 or even 4 ports. The corresponding incisions are on the abdomen.

She looks amazing! I&#39;m planning on seeing Dr. Purohit for peritoneal vaginoplasty. Once I start my new job and get access to decent health insurance, I am reaching out to his office to schedule a consult.

Congrats! It was about 8 months from my initial consult with him until surgery. I met with him again 2 months after initial consult, and then again 1 month before surgery. I really like him, he patiently and thoroughly answered all my questions and never made me feel rushed. Really knows his stuff. Great bedside demeanor. Even visited me late on a weekend night when I was having a lot of bleeding, to check me out and instruct the other uro doctors on a better way of wrapping my dressing. I felt safe and well taken care of. The emotional challenges of recovery have been much tougher than the physical challenges, and he and his team have given me a lot of peace of mind in trying times. Good luck with your consult!

Does he do follicle scraping? I love the low turnaround between consult and surgery date but that&#39;s not quite enough time for full hair removal, as I haven&#39;t started with hair removal there yet and don&#39;t know the extent of what needs to be removed and if it has to be electrolysis or if it can be laser

Mt Sinai offers laser hair removal, I guess it takes 5-7 sessions spaced a few weeks apart. Should be covered by health insurance. Laser only works on dark hair tho. I had light colored hair. I started electrolysis at the beginning of the year, before my consult. Ended up doing at least like 80 hours to get smooth in time for surgery (out of pocket! ouch.) He does do follicle scraping, but it is still necessary to do some hair removal. I wanted to be super thorough about it tho and not rely on that

I am not local to Mt. Sinai. There aren&#39;t any options around me so I&#39;m considering flying out for it. I&#39;ve looked through a number of results and my insurance should be accepted there and they&#39;re reputable. I would also prefer to not rely on it but I can&#39;t start the hair removal without knowing what hair they want removed and how. If laser is acceptable ig I should get started on that ASAP but I was skeptical about it since I&#39;ve always been told it&#39;s not permanent. Laser tech tried to explain that it&#39;s not considered permanent because it can only target dark hairs but that the follicles that it does effect are permanently destroyed. This would be ideal for me since most of the hair for me I believe is quite dark but I&#39;m also still not sure what extent they want removed.

Pretty sure kiwifarms just scrapes this sub for pictures to post.  Mostly pick up the early results of course because it filled with terfs trying to shit on trans people.
</p>
<p>
Make sure to post on alt accounts, I mean late for that but anyone seeing this.  Alt accounts for surgery sub pics are your friend.

I never heard of Kiwi Farms before. Took me a moment of digging to find the website. Wow what a sorry-ass bunch of people. They have some sort of sick fascination to spend so much time documenting people they find inferior to them. And clearly must be unemployed and living in their parents&#39; basement, to have that much free time. Personally, I&#39;m not offended by such pathetic individuals -_-

They can suck my meat-stick and deep-throat my testicles in the hospital pathology department

My surgeon stopped using the wound vac. I got the impression from previous patients that there was a significant increase in pain every time the wound vac &#34;sucked&#34;
