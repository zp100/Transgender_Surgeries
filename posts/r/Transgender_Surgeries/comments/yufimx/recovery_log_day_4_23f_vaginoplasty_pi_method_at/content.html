Since Wednesday I have had a vagina. Looking at myself in the mirror I am upset, because I still have some swelling and I’m bruised and bloody and smelly. This was expected- I am a previous depression sufferer and my psychiatrist discussed these feelings with me months ago. Still sucks :(
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow the surgeon will have a look, I’ll get the vaginal pack out, I’ll get the catheter out, and I’ll dilate. I presume I’ll also get to finally wash the surgery site.
</p>
<p>
I was initially worried that the result was lopsided but I’m not worried anymore, both sides are seemingly symmetrical. I’m getting used to how it looks but I understand I’m still swollen.
</p>
<p>
Passing stools has been the biggest challenge of my recovery. It requires getting up out of bed, sitting on the toilet, gently navigating toilet tissue against my undercarriage, usually whilst accidentally making myself bleed at some point too.
</p>
<p>
I had an incident where I urinated from my urethra in spite of my catheter. This was disgusting, but the nurses said to leave it without washing it, as it had gotten on my stitches.
</p>
<p>
Pain has been managed with paracetamol and ibuprofen. Morphine was stopped on day 1.
</p>
<p>
I am a vegetarian, dairy/nut allergic, and am finally sick of repeating the same meals.

I guess I’m mostly posting for my own sanity. Feel free to AMA. Reddit chats are broken if you’re wondering why I ghosted you, I’ve been trying to reply since Wednesday

Swelling will resolve. My surgeon said six months to a year but it was about eight months. I wouldn&#39;t worry. Just be sure to follow the discharge instructions and get in touch with Rashid’s team immediately if you run into any problems.
</p>
<p>
Hang in there, and good luck tomorrow!

Yup swelling will resolve, as will symmetry. I came up like a balloon 2 days before the pack came out - thought all the stitches were going to go. I was also bruised to hell. All has resolved, and I do really love my new bits!!
</p>
<p>
Go scroll way back up in my profile for pix of my own bruising post op and more recently, might set your mind at rest!
</p>
<p>
As the nurses for ice packs (and keep asking), Ice seems to arrive in a tied off latex glove. Icing the area did help my swelling. Carry on doing the same once home 15mins on, few hours off and not right on the skin.
