Hi, so there seems to be a lot of uncertainty around doctor prae from the Supron Clinic since she started her solo surgeries and how well she would do. Since I am one of the first ones to go through with it, I wanted to share my experiences. I am not going to post photos bc I have some trauma related to photos and videos of my body being taken.
</p>
<p>
Day -1: Checkin to the hospital around noon and kinda do whatever until 8pm. Thats when they do the enema, which is cleaning your bowels and shaving. I am going to be honest. Both of those sucked a lot. Enema is literally pumping like a gallon of water into your butt so you can empty everything out. You have to do it until it runs clean which took me 5 times. It hurts, its uncomfortable, you feel the water stretching your insides and feels like horrible cramps. The shaving was also quite bad... they used a spray - assuming its some sort of shaving spray -, a trimmer and razer. There was a lot of sharp pains. To be honest I thought it was going to be covered with cuts by the time they were done. They also go over the same area like 20 times... not even like correctly. Normally you shave once in the direction the hair grows then once more in the opposite to get a close shave. They went diagonal and sideways which made it not such a close shave and quite painful. I didn&#39;t drink or eat anything after and went to sleep.
</p>
<p>
Day 0: You wake up shower and then get wheeled off to the operating room. I thought I would immediately be put to sleep but they do things like stabbing the iv into you (which hurts quite a bit), taking your blood pressure and setting up some other things. Once they put the mask on you, your vision instantly blurs and you wake up with everything over. You stay there for an hour or so before going back to your room. Now, this day was by far the worst day for me. Constant pain and nausea. On a scale of 1-10 its an 8 for someone with high pain tolerance. Nausea made it horrible as well. Every time the nurses tried to make me drink water, I threw up within a few minutes. I was mostly drifting in and out of consciousness that entire day but couldn&#39;t eat or drink anything. They also check your blood pressure and fever every 2 hours or something that day. I&#39;m not exactly sure bc I was not super aware of anything other than the pain and nausea I felt. Around 8 hours after the nurse finally gave me morphine shot which I didnt really notice bc I fell asleep.
</p>
<p>
Day 2-4: Nausea was better and pain was still bad for these days. If the pain got to like a 4+, I would just call the nurse for some painkillers, same for nausea. Nothing much happened these days besides some suicidal thoughts (some personal things were happening) which a psychiatrist gave some meds for.
</p>
<p>
Day 5: Outside bandages came off. Dr bank was the one to do it. It didnt hurt too much, just a light sting every now and then. I showered that day with the help of some nurses and went back to being bored. The psychiatrist mentioned the nurses said my results already looked really good bc there wasnt too much swelling. I was kinda too scare to look or move much so I trust their word. It did already feel apart of my body, a painful part but nonetheless, felt really natural.
</p>
<p>
Day 7: Discharge day! They inject painkillers around 7 and Dr Prae came an hour after to remove the catheter and packing also to explain dilating. Taking out the catheter was painful but only lasted like 3 seconds. The packing took awhile but was not painful at all. It was like a weird sensation of like a string of balls being taken out. My depth ended up being 14 cm (169 cm height for reference). Using the bathroom the first time was quite scary and still is but not really different than before. Just it tends to drip down to my butt every time. I went back to the hotel and around 3 had to dilate again with the help of staff guiding. It is quite uncomfortable and painful but just within my tolerance. The cleanup and setup is ironically quite relaxing to me.
</p>
<p>
Day 8: I dilated in the first thing in the morning and it was bearable. I&#39;m trying not to use painkillers bc staff told me that I should try not to rely on it and build more pain tolerance. After that I went to the restroom for number 2 for the first time. It wasnt much probably bc I barely ate anything. I also had a checkup with Dr Prae at the clinic to remove the outside stitches and checkup. Removing stitches didnt hurt maybe a just a few sharp pokes. Dr prae said everything looked good but there might be some separation later which can be fixed with some stitches.
</p>
<p>
Day 9-10: There is quite a decent amount of lingering pain, but I&#39;m avoiding using painkillers as much as possible. Maybe once a day or every other day besides the one that says to take with breakfast and dinner (they give you 4 types of painkillers). I also have like 3 cold packs that I&#39;m alternating between. It helps a lot with pain and probably swelling too. Dilating hurts. It feels like someone is crushing your insides. A good comparison would be pressing your thumb as hard as you can into your arm. That type of pain and discomfort x10 and inside your stomach. My time to depth is between 5-10 minutes. I took 12 minutes once and staff was like go faster! Its bad to go too slow. So everytime I exhale I try to push it a bit deeper similar to how you would go deeper into a stretch. It hurts a lot but I just try to push through the pain. The feeling of taking it out hurts probably because its rubbing against some stitches. I also already have some separation happening but they said its fine. Doctor Prae will look at it next checkup and maybe add stitches.
</p>
<p>
Misc: - Dr Prae is extremely nice and considerate. She is professional and I find it a lot more comfortable to have a female doctor attend to me due to some past experiences. I&#39;ve hear Dr Banks beside manners isn&#39;t good but from my brief meeting with him he seemed fine. - Aesthetics: From looking at photos of early bank around 7 days - 2 weeks. I&#39;d argue mine looks better but thats mostly its not as swelled as other people. I can&#39;t say in the long term if it will be better, equal, or worse but I plan on coming back for a revision anyway. - Hospital food: International food menu sucks. A lot. I didn&#39;t try the thai menu but my lack of appetite and horrible food meant I basically only ate one slice of bread and a handful of potatos/fries everyday. The juiceboxes were nice though, grape tasted the best in my opinion. I didn&#39;t mind it that much because I want to lose weight anyway. - Nurses and staff are really nice~ I kept having a breakdown so I ended up chatting with the psychiatrist and she was really nice too - The other patients here seem really nice but I&#39;m too scared to talk with any of them! I also have selective mutism which doesnt really help but they all seem really friendly and supportive of each other from what I saw.

Thank you so much for sharing this.  I couldn&#39;t find enough information about her before and so I was too worried to make a confident decision on her.  I&#39;m so happy you shared so that maybe I can reconsider or at least it&#39;ll help others in the future.

I was a bit hesitant about going through with Dr Prae when I was offered it. The odds were a lot better after failing to get Dr Banks. I think around 24/57~ were given dates with Dr Prae. I ended up going with her bc having it done sooner and during my summer break makes it really convenient. I agree there is barely any info on Dr Prae and she isn&#39;t even on their website last time I checked. I want to share my experiences and give updates to help others decide whether or not they want to wait for Dr Banks. My experiences so far with her are good and didnt really have any complicatioms thus far besides a little separation which can be easily fixed. I think for the revision I will probably ask if Dr Banks could be the one to do it, not bc I think Dr Prae isn&#39;t good but I think the extra experience would help with getting the aesthetics I want.

Hey, would you be willing to give a quick update on how things are going now? It’s been around a month so I’m curious if you have any new information to share? Thank you!  :))

How are you doing now a few days later? Are things stable and healing properly?

Swelling has gone down a lot according to the staff (I did not have a lot to begin with after they removed the bandages). The reduced swelling could be bc I have been just laying in bed all day alternating between 3 cold packs so I&#39;m always using one. I feel like it helps with the pain and discomfort and prob the swelling too. My separation has gotten worse but Dr Prae is waiting to see if it heals on its own if not then stitches. I don&#39;t have any other complications other than the top part of my minor labia has bumps that bleed due to the inside swelling more than the outside and a group of stitches being there. It will go away once swelling goes down more so no major complications! I am not supposed to walk much bc it might cause more separation but I went to an aqaurium at a university yesterday and kbbq anyway. Very fun! Highly reccommend both places (Bangsaen Aquarium - go in the morning so its not crowded -  and KBBQ บางแสน)! First time going out since operation so the staff said it was fine they did a checkup after and said separation looked the same. I do get a lot of discharge and go through between 5-8 pads a day. The pads arent long enough and kinda staining my panties (near by butt) and bedsheets (I just wear a shirt and panties so I can have the cold pack on) so I&#39;ve only using my old cheap panties. Somehow the cold pack has 0 stains so thats good! Not gonna wear my nice panties until like a year out though.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetics: It already looks like a natural vagina (I looked at pictures online for side by side comparison and really impressed with how it already looks natural despite only being 2.5 weeks out). I am quite satisfied and excited to see it in a few months when it heals more. I probably will still come back for a revision regardless bc it can always be better plus its free.
</p>
<p>
Sensation is... everything is too sensitive in my opinion and I am a little scared about it healing more and becoming even more sensitive. It already felt like a normal part of my body since they took off the outside bandages but now my vagina feels like something I&#39;ve just always had. I can pee in a stream and not have it go everywhere! I&#39;m so happy about that part.
</p>
<p>
I started dynamic dilation and found it easier than static. Applying hard constant pressure hurts more than alternating between pressure and doing circles with the dilator. My time to depth for both medium and large only takes me less than 10 seconds, 30 seconds if you include using fingers. Its not that fast bc it doesn&#39;t hurts but bc it hurts a lot (going slow hurts the same amount just for longer). I use one finger to find the hole then put my second all the way in, using both to push up and down quite hard. This does not hurt but is uncomfortable. I only do that for like 10-20 seconds then I put some rolled paper towel in my mouth to bite on, close my eyes and just push the dilator in. If it hurts, I push it faster. Pushing it in is the most painful part like a 7/10 (operation day pain was a 8/10) but its important to relax your lower body. I find biting down hard on something helps move the tension there so my lower body is relaxed and not tense. After its at depth it goes down to like a 4 and slowly goes to just being uncomfortable by the time I&#39;m done. The large dilator hurts more but I can reach full depth in the same time. I haven&#39;t used painkillers at all since being discharged other than the ones that you take with breakfast and dinner (they give 4 types of painkillers). Staff reccomended not relying on it to build pain tolerance so I guess it works though my pain tolerance was already high to begin with. Everyday pain would be like 2 with some sharp pains every now and then. Staff did mention I&#39;m getting to depth too fast (speed running dilating! current world record holder lol) but its fine as long as it does not cause bleeding.
</p>
<p>
Side note: apparently after the operation there was a button to self administer morphine. No one told me about it. The nurses and staff were just like wow this person has such high pain tolerance and patience, never even thought about touching the button. ITS BC NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT IT! Would have spammed that so much but oh well building more pain tolerance I guess.

That honestly sounds awesome! I&#39;m glad you are recovering well!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m personally scheduled with Dr Bank in June next year and it&#39;s calming to hear about others experiences. 😊

I&#39;m happy you got your surgery scheduled and I hope it goes well~ I don&#39;t regret doing this one bit and the hospital and clinic staff have been really nice and supportive. I&#39;ve had a few mental breakdowns here and they were always willing to listen, give advice, and encourage me. The only thing I&#39;m worried about is keeping up the dilation. I can barely get myself to brush my teeth twice a day...
