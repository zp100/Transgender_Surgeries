I went through your account and I am surprised you already had a revision not long after you had the original procedure. Was your right labia being disconnected from your vaginal canal an issue the first time? I couldn&#39;t tell if it did when looking at your recovery photos. I too had my srs about three weeks and now dealing with the same issue which of one side not being connected to the vaginal canal.

Is your surgeon saying it’ll recover okay?

I see him in a few days so when he sees everything I can get back to you but I would say so? I have sigmoid vaginoplasty and the vaginal canal area has a lot of granulation since out of nowhere since about yesterday at least I noticed it yesterday. Waiting for the skin to develop inside or however it&#39;s supposed to but my concern is the granulation in my vaginal canal and the dehiscence of one side of my vagina not being attached to my skin/vaginal canal down there but everything else is fine.

Yes, neither labia was incorporated to the introitus before. This was one of the fixes. But all the stitching bringing the right labia down and connected broke and now it looks like a chunk is missing. Yes, my revision was close to my original surgery. 6 months.

Did it ever end up looking better at least even if it wasn&#39;t connected all the way down? Did skin end up devolving there anyway so it looked better and not so detached? I can&#39;t tell in your pictures if it did.

No. Before the introitus was completely separate from the rest of the vulva. It really looked like it was going to look good but then the stitches broke and now I have a wound and I don’t see how it can fill itself in.

I went and looked at girls who had this issue and it seems to be common and does heal itself and develop skin but I am sorry this happened to you and I will come back after my appointment to tell you what my surgeon says and I will post a progress picture

So you are getting a revision for the wound separation itself? Did it heal back at all to look close to okay?

i can’t answer that because it is fresh, it happened on monday that my sutures opened. My surgeon said the upper layer of skin died. Now with the skin graft it will hopefully heal faster.
