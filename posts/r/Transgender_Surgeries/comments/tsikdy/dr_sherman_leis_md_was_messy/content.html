Girl okay I hit this Dr up last year, he‚Äôs outside of Philly. I had a FaceTime consultation.  Okay so like we touched on stuff and got to talking about the community in PA, he told me there‚Äôs like group things that get together in Harrisburg and he speaks at them sometimes. Told me if he ever sees me there maybe he‚Äôll take me out to dinner. Could be a nice gesture but like‚Ä¶. Weird. Lol kinda awkward as fuck.  So at a point (because apparently he does srs the most)was asking me if that‚Äôs what I wanted and I said I was only there for boobs. He basically was like well doesn‚Äôt that make the men into you gay if you have that? Lol!  Like maybe relax.
<br>
So yeah I‚Äôd avoid him unless you‚Äôre fine with being Called a gay man  because like if you calling them gay‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs man on man, what you calling me? Lmao the audacity. Watch this one gals.

I know both of the Docs mentioned here and both have quirks.  Keep in mind that the FFS guy literally has feminized thousands of women at reasonable cost compared to the alternative bitd (Dr. O).
</p>
<p>
But I think that overall your post  is probably a valid criticism.  The 1990s era docs-well-things were different all of the way around.  I was coming out late 90s and knew a lot of women who transitioned in the 70s-90s.  Demographically, back then I think a much higher percentage of Tranz had roots in the gay community and absorbed a lot of that culture.  I think many of today‚Äôs transitioners would be lost back then.  1990s Docs picked up on the period gay culture,  and never caught on that the context has changed.
</p>
<p>
Also, there was a strong population of organized crossdressers who (some) eventually transitioned and brought along almost dead notions about femininity that the docs accommodated.  Keep in mind back then most mainstream plastic surgeons didn‚Äôt even want Tranz in their waiting room let alone operate on us.  Many would just say ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do that‚Ä¶‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
So some of that dated cultural stuff can be annoying,  but the source is not from them having an attitude or them being condescending-it‚Äôs what they picked up along the way over many years of working with our highly diverse community.
</p>
<p>
Oh and Leis has (or had, haven‚Äôt seen them in years,lol) a very sweet wife and he seemed pretty devoted to her.  So the ‚Äútake you out to dinner‚Äù was most likely just intended as a nice gesture.  Leis has other hangups (weight) but never struck me as a chaser or Perv.  Anyway, I believe I heard that Leis retired.

Well, I kind of have empathy for these older providers.  They are behind the times a bit in terms of transculture (so am I come to think of it,lol).    I was never one to get bent out of shape easily, and knowing where it comes from, it goes in one ear and out the other.  On the other hand, I have respect for those docs who were willing to care for us when nobody else would.  Now that insurance covers us, suddenly we are flooded with providers, some of dubious affection for our population.    Your larger point is right though.  There really is no system in the US and its indicative of our chaotic healthcare system in general.

What a prick! I&#39;m sorry you experienced that.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Meltzer asked me who I was going to sleep with, men or women as it would affect the outcome. I said, &#34;both, like any other woman would have the choice of making.&#34; He gave me the teeeeeniest clitoris without a hood. I have a vulva that encompasses it, so I&#39;m not mad, but it&#39;s a pain to have to purposefully seek it for access.
</p>
<p>
Yeah - old school thinking (I know what&#39;s best for you) is bullshit.

He is known to touch patients without gloves and also sleeps with patients both pre and post op. Definitely stay away. He should not operate on people.

I got that vibe from him when I saw him speak at PTWC one year. Seemed to think most of us were straight, poo-pooed zero depth procedures.
