I know every doctor has bad reviews and no one is perfect. I haven’t seen her name on here as of yet so I thought I’d ask and see what everyone thought of her. Especially people that had ffs or bottom surgery with her.

I would be very wary of her. IRL I have heard of several botched surgeries she has done directly from patients themselves.

I&#39;ve met her in person a few times at the Philadelphia Transgender Wellness conference and at first she seems very likable, but after a while she comes across as very arrogant. I have seen some of her results in person and some of them look good but others were a disaster. When complications arise, she is horrible and blames the patient for things that are clearly her fault. She also has a horrible bedside manner once the surgery has taken place as she seems to disappear. The worst case from her is what happened to
<a href="http://hannahsimpson.com/surgery/">Hannah Simpson who is very open about what happened to her
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
You want a good surgeon for this and someone who doesn&#39;t follow up is NOT a good surgeon I don&#39;t care how talented they are.

I have a friend who went to her for ffs and it was a nightmare. She had go out of pocket to have several revisions. Rumer was completely evasive and my friend spent a lot of time trying to get the worst complication fixed, a cheek implant that drifted into her lower eyelid. Rumer pretended like she would help since my friend hadn’t had bottom surgery yet. Once my friend said she was going to another surgeon Rumer stopped answering her calls. She had the implant removed by another surgeon at her own expense. I highly discourage working with her.

I really appreciated this source because you can go by surgery type and surgeon. They also do a great job of explaining each surgery, and it’s friendly for both MTF and FTM users.

Look up her name on

, there are more stuff there. I would honestly rather never have SRS than allow her to touch my body.

Here’s the list of surgeons I would never touch: -Rumer -Schechter -Meltzer -Dugi
</p>
<p>
Every surgeon has stories of complications and bad shit happening. It’s the nature of the surgery, but these 4 have more good than bad and reputations of being difficult to work with when complications arise.

I would agree with everyone in your assessment aside from dugi. He works out of OHSU which is a medical university and why you can’t find much of his stuff online. He’s one of the go-to’s in this area of the country and one of the best in the field of male reconstructive urology, which is a plus for the vaginoplasty procedure. He’s usually referred to for revisions of other surgeon’s mess-ups. His office has been incredibly 100% a joy to work with and are very easy to get in contact with every step of the way.
</p>
<p>
A lot of people have unrealistic expectations of the US healthcare industry and don’t put in the prerequisite work that goes into any surgery, such as healthy dieting and exercise, mindfulness and therapy, etc. Yes, you can do all of the right things and there is still a risk of complications, though you will find most complications are from individuals who are older (50s/60s), overweight, have other health issues, etc. Dugi is very professional, has excellent bedside manner, and most importantly, has amazing results, something echoed by everyone I know who has personally worked with him.
</p>
<p>
Just my two cents.

Unfortunately I have found few vaginoplasty pics there, and hardly any recent ones. It seems much more used by trans men and top surgery pics

And what does that number mean? Is it calculated by every patient that asks for a follow up, is it only what the doctor reports, only when there’s medical necessity, or is it a totally made up number that means nothing? If the patient wants a revision for any reason is that figured into the number or is it only counted if the doctor actually does a second surgery. Some doctors only take super low risk patients or patients that’d never be able to follow up. Is it counted as a revision if anther doctor has to fix it?  Who made that number, is it independently verified?

I had a consultation with her and she seemed nice enough to me, but that said, the surgery I am interested in is not particularly complicated. People who require more complicated surgeries are obviously more likely to experience complications, so I would recommend taking a lot of things you might hear with a grain of salt. I&#39;m not trying to deny anyone else&#39;s bad experiences with her, but she is located near a major metro area and probably performs a LOT of surgeries, so the fact that she has had at least a couple of patients who&#39;ve experienced a bad outcome with her doesn&#39;t mean that this kind of experience is typical. People who have actually had good outcomes with her are a lot less likely to be vocal about their experience.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that this along with the sheer number of transphobes out there who have nothing better to do than hurl abuse at surgeons who treat trans people have probably made her overly protective of her business, which is understandable, but also understandably makes people hesitant to take a risk on her, as no one wants to risk being mistreated if complications should arise. Getting just an initial consultation risks nothing though, and if you&#39;re really worried about the risk of complications, her staff may be willing to share some metrics about risk. Given some of the horror stories other people are offering, and given that you&#39;re asking about FFS and bottom surgery, I certainly would not blame you for being wary of her.

There&#39;s plenty of surgeons who have high volumes of surgeries and don&#39;t have anything like this kind of record. It&#39;s kind of hard to get past the photos of her work too.
</p>

There&#39;s an a interesting ftm post about her as well.
