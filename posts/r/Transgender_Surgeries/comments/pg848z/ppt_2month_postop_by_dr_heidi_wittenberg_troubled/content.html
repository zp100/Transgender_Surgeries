PPT 2month Post-Op by Dr. Heidi Wittenberg. Troubled about Aesthetics. I had wound separation immediately post and my inner labia became detached from the bottom (as you can see). Considering revision, but would love some community input. I&#39;m so worried it looks like a crab claw mutant(not natal).

I wanted to thank everybody for their measured responses. I was in such a bad space last night, but I feel completely reassured. After reading through y&#39;alls comments, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion the procedure was not, in fact, a botched job and I need to let my O&#39;keefe heal. Like someone pointed out, a revision is comparatively simpler and easy to recover from so if I&#39;m not totally sold on the aesthetics I might just move forward with that.
</p>
<p>
On the bright side, I feel lucky I have some good - good depth (6.5 inches) and the sensation is pretty remarkable - definitely better than it was when I had the noodle.
</p>
<p>
Thank y&#39;all so much again!!!

looks like prominent labia minora, within normal limits. the scarring and abrupt color change the labia majora will probably become less apparent with time.

Its amazing how varied AFAB vaginas are, if you look at the different panels of what they call the &#34;Wall of Vaginas&#34;, you will see how vaginas really don&#39;t have a &#34;normal&#34;. Although many woman who are dysphoric about the look of their vagina will get surgery to cosmetically look what is considered &#34;normal&#34; in their mind. Probably due to all the porn we see and how they all seem to have &#34;perfect&#34; looking vaginas.
</p>
<p>
This is just one panel of the Wall of Vaginas, they did plaster casts of I think 100 vaginas to show how much variety there is in how they look:

You have 2 months since the operation, it is still too early to make a decision, I recommend you wait until 6 or a year to make the decision to undergo revision surgery, even so it seems that it is a good result, the vulvas are very diverse, none is equal to another and yours falls into the typical variety.

Two months is still very early. Give it time. It will definitely improve. At that point you&#39;ll know more about if or what needs fixed.

I’m looking at having the same surgery done. I’m surprised no hair removal required, I know they say not needed but if thePPV fails and they needed to do a PI then it’s less  problematic. Wittenberg is a big proponent of PPV they are just starting where I’m at. Why didn’t they correct this post op? I would like to know everything

Instead of listening to Ms. Ignoramus here, just wait for til ur at least 3rd month PO and then check to see if ur healed completely and the aesthetics should look normal if not then IMO just considered a mild labiaplasty touch up. Most PO vaginoplasties may look &#34;scary&#34; when still freshly outta surgery then a few months later to a year it&#39;ll start to look more normal and cis passing.

Totally agree with this. I’m at 3 months minus 1 week (also with Mozaic care, ppt) and have a more mild version of this issue.
</p>
<p>
Overall, it does get better especially around the 3 month mark. I’ll probably end up having a cosmetic revision, though.
</p>
<p>
Just give it time, OP. It’ll get a bit better and you’ll likely want a small revision for the issue, however that should be WAY less severe than the surgery you just went through. It’s not ideal, but it’s definitely workable.
</p>
<p>
The swelling in the labia will go down substantially.

<p>
also, a lot of the size in the labia is from excess fat that they intentionally leave in place because fat cells are very sensitive and are quick to die off following trauma (like surgery). this process of death takes about a year and it&#39;s the primary reason you got warned about &#34;tissue necrosis&#34; as a possible complication of surgery. it happens so often that if they don&#39;t leave the excess fat in place, they risk leaving you with underdistinguished labia, with little differentiation between the labia majora and labia minora.
</p>
<p>
so: the extra size of the labia is normal early in recovery, especially with swelling, and it&#39;s an extremely easy fix if the size doesn&#39;t go down sufficiently - they just remove some more fat. it&#39;s there as insurance and it&#39;ll take around a year before you know whether you need a revision or not. at the same time, if the dehiscence really affected the aesthetics of the labia (also rare, apparently - the body is really good at healing via wound closure) they can repair it then.
</p>
<p>
give the healing process time, OP.

I think 2 months you are doing good, I wish I had that minora definition. But you know what you need and revision is quick and recovery is easy

Give it time, but if you do decide to get a revision, check out Dr Jun in San Francisco. He&#39;s an artist.

Oh honey, your results look just fine, I&#39;d be happy with it. Just remember, it&#39;s better to have too much left over than too little. You&#39;re doing great, the worry is all part of the recovery process. Also, I think Dr. W says that the labia will look more natural over time with plentiful penetration.

i&#39;m so sorry sister.  I actually know what it&#39;s like to be troubled about aesthetics.  i had PPT with Dr. Wittenberg too in July.  So i&#39;m 1 month post-op. Dr. Wittenberg did an amazing job and i was so happy with her work and my aesthetics after my surgery. She even put my photo on up her website.  However, I had a complication with swelling too and all the stitches on my left labia majora all popped (so theres a huge wound separation, and you can see a huge chunk of muscle tissue underneath) my inner left labia minora became detached on the bottom as well. So i can completely understand where you&#39;re coming from.  I am less troubled about it now, compared to a week ago. What helped me alot was talking to my brother and aunt; and I just cried and balled my eyes out to them. I cried for probably that whole week when the PA told me that I might need a revision.  So i do suggest confiding about all this in someone who you feel safe talking to, and to just cry your eyes out if you need too. Right now I feel ok and better about it.  I do and trust that our bodies are still healing and that our aesthetics will look different in a couple months.

Looks better than mine did at 2 months and I had the same issue. It only took me 4 years and 3 more revisions to get it repaired. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have that kind of a problem because your fourchette has held up well. Trust me, in 6 months it will look completely different (better).

Is this with the labia created with sutures or her newer method of using shaft skin to create the inner labia? She gave me until my surgery day, just had my preop, to decide.
