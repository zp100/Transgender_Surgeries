Iâ€™m not sure if my concerns are valid, I have asked the nurses about them but they said itâ€™s normal
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The area is super swollen, not just the actual surgery site but also the lower stomach. I am not able to close my legs or walk in a normal posture because of this.
</li>
<li>
There are large areas of bruising, yellow and purple, covering from the upper thighs to lower stomach
</li>
<li>
What should be the clitoris area is entirely black
</li>
<li>
I am only able to walk or stand for about 10 minutes before I have to lie down. Otherwise I feel that Iâ€™m going to pass out
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Please let me know if all of these are normal in your opinion.

Its normal I had some scabbing as well with bruising, I know how it might make you feel uneasy but my best advice I can give you is to take it easy as healing takes time best not to stress during healing also keeping in contact with your surgeon, communication with surgeon is always good sending them photo references and they will be better at determining healing process and questions.

Omg that bruising on the upper thigh at the back of the leg, I had similar and it was excruciating. I hope yours is not too bad pain wise. All the bruising will go eventually, mine took a few weeks to go to skin colour, the swelling several months and it&#39;s still getting better at 8 months post op.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s really strange that you have such noticeable bruising in the same place as I did. I thought it was because they essentially dug a hole into my pelvis and I thought that was the cause. Maybe it&#39;s the removal of the sperm tubes, nerve chords etc as far back into the inguinal (spelling) canal to prevent them causing issues years down the line ?
</p>
<p>
Looks good though, congratulations x

Itâ€™s quite concerning that you said the swelling is still present at 8 months. I though I can go back to normal at 6 weeks so I left 2 months for recovery. I know I will probably not have the same energy level but at least I expected to be able to walk normally. I will discuss this with my surgeon at post op appointment.

I don&#39;t have a massive amount of swelling left it&#39;s just the large labia. Thankfully they are getting smaller and thinner / shrinking as time goes on and the swelling didn&#39;t stop me doing anything important. You will be running about in no time ðŸ˜‰
</p>
<p>
I also had a complication with neuropathic pain that you thankfully don&#39;t have, that&#39;s why I mentioned the bruising on the back of your leg / bum crease.
</p>
<p>
Congratulations again x

Swelling is totally common. I had a little bit of swelling in the creases where my hips and pelvis meet. If I remember correctly, my mons and lower abdomen were very swollen.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not much bruising for me. I had drains in until 3 days after but I also had a huge bleeding issue that Iâ€™ll get to next and may be the reason I didnâ€™t bruise much.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
So. Thatâ€™s a clot. I had the exact same thing. In the exact same place. I had an active bleed after surgery to the point where it was likely I was going to be taken back into the OR. My clot was there until my second post op - and it was taken off at that appointment. There was no aesthetic damage to my clit and I was able to orgasm at 48 days.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
This is probably due to your other complications - or what you see as complications. You could and probably are anemic from the blood loss associated with your blood clot.
</p>

I mean, a scab is still a blood clot. Itâ€™s just platelets clumped together.

Makes sense. I understand scab as a type of blood clot that is entirely exterior

Sure. I have not found much about my surgeon. I was a UCSD student, and my pcp recommended her. The waitlist was only several months, so I decided to go for it.

Hello there, hope you&#39;re feeling better! Do you have any updates you could share with us? Also, I know it maybe to soon to say, but would you recommend Dr. Jennifer Anger based on your experience thus far?

Iâ€™ve been healing ok. Swelling is still a problem. The scab seems to be falling soon. Other than these issues, everything is healing really quickly. I can stand and sit on a donut pillow for hours. Bruises are mostly gone too. I will make another post after the scab falls off.
</p>
<p>
I think Dr. Anger does a good job keeping everything functional. I would not say sheâ€™s best at creating an aesthetically beautiful vulva but that could just be my case. Iâ€™ve seen results at consultation that look really good, but unfortunately every person presents a unique case. The upside is that it only took me a little more than 3 months to get from initial consultation to surgery.

I&#39;m happy to hear that you&#39;re healing is coming along. Yes, I could imagine the swelling to take the longest in healing.
</p>
<p>
I was referred to her by my therapist, but haven&#39;t seen much of her work, your the second case that i&#39;ve seen pictures of. I&#39;m looking to get vaginalplasty but still not sure with which surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Btw, did you get electrolysis/laser hair removal?

UCSD health does not release those pictures. You will see more at consultation only.
</p>
<p>
I only did home laser + hair removal cream for about a year. I still had some thin hair going into the surgery but most are gone. Dr. Anger does not require full hair removal for vulvoplasty but Iâ€™m not sure for vaginoplasty.

Yes, I&#39;m currently doing electrolysis hair removal. And am hoping to get SRS this year(hopefully). Still unsure if it will be with Dr. Anger. But I&#39;ll see how my next consultation with her goes.
</p>
<p>
Wish you get better and better, everyday in every way!
