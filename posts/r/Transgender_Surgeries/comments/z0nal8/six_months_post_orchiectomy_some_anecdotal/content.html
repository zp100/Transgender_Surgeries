I had my orchiectomy in May and going into it, I had a hard time finding much info from people who had had the procedure. I wanted to throw in my 2 cents for anyone else considering the same. This was coming after about 2 years of 50mg daily oral bica. I also upped my estrogen dose from 1mg sublingual to 4mg just before the surgery, that that is a bit confounding to the results. Overall, I am very happy with my decision and I would not do it any other way.
</p>
<p>
I probably should not have been, but I was on my feet by the next day (I had a family memorial service that I really wanted to be active at), but for the month following surgery my energy level was quite low.  I took one full week off work and teleworked an additional two, working about 75% of my regular full time hours. Six weeks later I was bike commuting to work (with my surgeon&#39;s blessing)
</p>
<p>
Since the surgery, my overall energy level has been a little lower, but nothing crazy and I have adjusted by improving my sleep hygiene and dialing back some activities. 8 hours per night is pretty mandatory for me now.
</p>
<p>
<span class="md-spoiler-text">
My libido is basically on the floor unless I&#39;m with my (now ex, f&#39;s in the comments) girlfriend. It&#39;s very rare for me to ejaculate during orgasm now, and the physiological response is much more in line with the AFAB experience, which is highly affirming. My erectile function is actually more consistent now than it was pre surgery, but that might be from more confidence and gender euphoria than my medical state.

<p>
I was warned that some weight gain was inevitable, but I have not found that to be the case. I have developed a bit of a mons pubis but (fingers crossed) no fupa has formed. That could change. I did notice a pretty drastic drop in appetite and I have adjusted my caloric intake accordingly. Plus, I bike/climb/run most days so the high activitly level may be preventing me from gaining much weight.
</p>
<p>
I have developed a more femme fat distribution, but that may be from the extra estrogen.  My butt has filled out a lot and my breasts went from practically nonexistent to a a nice A cup.

Thanks a ton for sharing! I&#39;m seriously looking into this right now as I&#39;m having issues with Spiro taking me very hypotensive in order to get my T low enough. Sadly, being in Alaska, no one in state does them, so I&#39;d likely be flying to Seattle to get it, then flying back after.
</p>
<p>
Question for you, if given the above, would you rather fly (~4hrs, then 45 min drive to home),  the day of/day after, OR do you think it&#39;s worth the money to spend a week or so in a hotel before flying?
</p>
<p>
Had you had a vasectomy in the past? If so, how would you compare the pain and recovery?
</p>
<p>
(My vasectomy was SUPER not at all painful), then a like 2/10 the week following, only taking an anti-inflammatory for the pain. That said, I&#39;ve recently day through a 10hr tattoo appointment, then went back for another 4 the next day, and got my ears x2 each side, and nose pierced and wouldn&#39;t say there was any own involved. ðŸ§±
</p>
<p>
I really appreciate your sharing!

I didn&#39;t mind a two hour drive home after my procedure, outside of some jerky maneuvering by my ride.  I&#39;d ask your doc about flying. I could see the pressure change being pretty unpleasant but I have no clue

I did a 4 hour car ride immediately after, and whereas it was certainly not the most comfortable thing by the end, it was doable. The only thing I could see being an issue with flying would be waiting in line to board. Standing in place was rather uncomfortable for a week or two after. Though oddly walking was fine.

I&#39;d likely fly first class, to AK, it&#39;s often only like a 20% difference, and I often eat the difference want the Alaska lounge, which you get access to on Alaskan with a first ticket valid that fast. Being Autistic, it makes a world of difference to my anxiety levels, which is the main reason I get it.
</p>
<p>
I have not flown since transitioning, in the past though first+precheck has made security easier. I&#39;m honestly terrified if that part until my name and gender are legally corrected, and documents match.
</p>
<p>
In this case, preboarding, a shorter walk, and a further recline, and a larger cleaner in-flight lavatory a few feet away would probably be good if I need to check on dressings or anything. OOOH! Maybe I can get a ride on the golf cart thing at the airport, too!

I didn&#39;t comment on the pain levels at all. I had none. I was prescribed some serious painkillers but didn&#39;t even need Tylenol during my recovery.  there was some moments where I moved in a way I shouldn&#39;t have and a pain told me to stop, but more of a &#34;don&#39;t do that if it hurts&#34;

well, six months in it definitely was firm enough. I have not had the opportunity in the last month.

Mine was just over a year ago, and can confirm this sounds like my experience.
