Since I couldn‚Äôt find a lot of recent information on UCLA‚Äôs Gender Health Program or any program/ doctors in the SoCal area, I thought I would post my experiences thus far.
</p>
<p>
Background about me, I am a 26yo MTF, started HRT February 2021. I started out with going to therapy before I started HRT. I wanted to make sure that I was clear-minded and this was a decision I really wanted. I knew something was wrong about my biological sex growing up, but I just put it off as a ‚Äúphase‚Äù. Therapy really help me come to my own decision, and I am glad about how I did it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
HRT My hormone replacement therapy is done through Dr. Shira Grock at UCLA Endocrinology Santa Monica. I got to her after inquiring through the ‚ÄúRequest More Info‚Äù link on the UCLA Gender Health‚Äôs website. It started with them getting my insurance info an my background info to see how they can help me get started. Dr. Grock is a busy doctor, so my first appointment with her was maybe 2-3 months out from when I first inquired. So if you are looking to go with her, make sure you dont miss your appointments. I chose to go with Dr. Grock solely because she is a endocrinologist, so hormones are her specialty. I felt safer knowing a specialist will be managing my HRT. You do have the option of seeing one of their Primary Care Providers for HRT, but I personally just wanted to go with Dr. Grock. First appointment with her was pretty extensive and informative. She started out with asking about my background history an transition history. She then asked about my goals, expectations, and plans regarding my transition. Dr. Grock was super informative in explaining the process, how medications work, and the effects (both positive an negative) of HRT. After some labs, I was able to start HRT once she got my baseline hormone levels. Dr. Grock has been easy to get in contact with and responds fairly quick on the myUCLAhealth (UCLA‚Äôs medical patient portal). I would recommend Dr. Grock 100000%!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
-Top Surgery Once I got a year into HRT, I grew up to maybe a 36A. Dr. Grock put my referral in and I saw Dr. Ginger Slack. Getting an appointment for my consultation was fairly easy. I was able to get in maybe a few weeks after I called her office. First impressions were that she super nice, super informative, and really knowledgeable which is a key factor for me. After the consultation her surgery coordinator called me about 3-4 days after to set my date. The process that I was told is that they will book a date an time to reserve an OR. Once I submitted my letters the coordinator will then submit to my insurance for pre-auth and send my surgery packet. My pre-op was booked a week before surgery. I was told I have a wide breast bone (5cm/ 2 1/2in) so that might give me a gap between my implants. If anyone else had this similar to them, how do you like you results? My surgery was booked about 3 months after my consultation.
</p>
<p>
-Bottom Surgery I had my consultation with Dr. Gladys Ng in Burbank. I couldn‚Äôt find much info on her online. But she was also super nice and knowledgeable. Some information she told me was that she kind of does a penile inversion method and uses parts of your peritoneum to add more depth. She told me that the ‚Äúperitoneum pull through‚Äù method is a myth or misinformation that is going around. She also told me that there really isn‚Äôt any ‚Äúself-lubrication‚Äù. Dr. Ng says that any ‚Äúlubrication‚Äù you may experience most likely is your neovaginal discharge, and it will stop eventually. I‚Äôm not sure how up to date or accurate any of this is, so if you have more info I‚Äôd like to hear :) During the consulation she will examine your penis to measure and look at the skin and hair. She gave me a list of dermatologist at UCLA I could call for hair removal through  insurance but the derm office said they dont do hair removal any more. So IDK if her list was outdated. She says that she will not book the surgery until all letters are submitted and that they are booking a year out. Post op she also says 6-7 nights in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
I hope this info helps someone. If anybody has anything else to addd or share, I‚Äôd love to hear from you üòÅ

I think you may have misunderstood Dr Ng   I saw her three months ago.  She said there‚Äôs a lot of misinformation out there  but PPT isn‚Äôt a myth just too much wrong info out there .   The process and everything else you  said is spot on
</p>
<p>
I see Dr Amy Weimar and she is my GP and handles my hormones too
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been trying to get to see Dr Slack for forever haha  I‚Äôll try Monday

I definitely could have misunderstood her. There was so much information given that I kind of blanked out half way through the visit. I love how informative she was though. Have you gotten bottom surgery yet? If so was it with Ng?
</p>
<p>
And for Dr. Slack, she only does consultations on certain days.

And yes finding a place that‚Äôs does electrolysis is a challenge    One place is Beverly Hills Hair Free ‚Äî  they do  lidocaine shots before hand  and then another one -  Dana Elise electrolysis ‚Äî same with lido    Hard to pin down for a call back
<br>
Beverly Hills claims they bill insurance  but unsure  - haven‚Äôt been there yet

Also going through UCLA gender health program; haven‚Äôt looked into SRS just yet as I‚Äôm getting FFS first but thank you for sharing this information! Extremely insightful. It would be HUGE to get laser/electrolysis covered, looking into that myself right now as well.

Yep, BSCA covers my face/neck electrolysis. Interestingly they don‚Äôt have any in-network providers so you pick the provider and submit a coverage request letter and BS clears you for a number of units (1/2 hour time periods). After treatments I pay upfront, get a SuperBill, submit it, BS deducts the co-pay and sends me a check.
