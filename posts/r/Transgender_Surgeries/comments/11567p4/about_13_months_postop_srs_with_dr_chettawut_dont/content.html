Very nice results and you must be totally satisfied.  I couldn&#39;t tell anything but perfection,  not a scar standing out or anything. Just absolutely woe and if only I will be as lucky. Very big congratulations to you.

13 months so you&#39;ve had a some time to get some test drives in. Is it as good as we dream of?  No answer required if that uncomfortable.  Thank you for sharing.  Made my night

Thanks so much for your kind words love!  And other than self clitoris stimulation, I haven’t tried out much lol.  I know I know I’m quite surprised myself that I haven’t actually been penetrated lol.  But the self orgasms from clitoris stimulation are amazing.  I do plan of actually having sex soon……maybe.
</p>
<p>
I just purchased the 2 biggest soul source dilators in order to prepare as I don’t believe that Chetts biggest dilator #4 is thick enough to allow me to have painless sex.

This is a lot for me to admit but I&#39;ve been married a few times to sis women for over 30yr ofvmy life and have never been with a man &gt;(yet)&lt; but I have fantasized and dreamed about it much whole adult life of 55yr and being a woman and after so many decades I am ever closer to these dreams becoming real and I have been 100% single and no sex now for 7 yr while I soul-searching and finally taking the big jump to fulfill these dreams and about 7 weeks away from reaching my 1yr HRT mark and then srs like you and I&#39;m proud, happy and a little scared with my dream is closer than I realize and with my luck assuming I will ever be able to me the first man he will be Kong Dong hung like the biggest thing I never new was possible without a penny&#39;s experience in this being a complete virgin and especially already not having any sex in almost 7yr of any kind its something I really planned and I look forward to losing my virginity but not by a monster. Lol if this makes since. 🤣 karma has been rough on me but fair. I have it coming.  So that&#39;s why I&#39;m really curious about others incounters because our dreams and fantasy are probably all pretty close and wondering how they compare.  I know I&#39;m a dork 🤪  but an excited one.

Thank you and don’t worry yours will be even better.  The recovery wasn’t bad at all.  Of course at times the bleeding (not really heavy bleeding though) would freak me out.  There was a time when I’d bleed after pee’ing when I first woke up in the mornings and after my dilations.  That stopped at about 2 months though.  Other than that, the just having to take it easy part sucked lol.  All of that was normal though so it really wasn’t that bad!

Awww thanks so much that makes me feel good.  In doing my research looking at cis vaginas, I’ve learned that no 2 vaginas are similar or even perfect and that’s why I love mine and feel like it passes.  If you’re thinking about going for it, you definitely should!

Hey sis, glad I could put you at it.  At first I was worried myself being that obviously the lips would be darker than most but I’ve learned that this is very normal with not just cis black women but all shades of cis women.  Also our darker skin definitely helps with scarring as you can see which makes it undetectable lol.  Go for it, it’ll all turn out great!

Do you experience any natural lubricant?  I am considering PPV because of a desire to have some natural lube.
</p>
<p>
How much pain?
</p>
<p>
How much effort to maintain the depth?
</p>
<p>
I keep wondering if I am going to end up no depth because I don’t have enough time to do the dialation

I have some natural lubricant, I don’t think it will be enough for sex though and I’m ok with that.  Me personally, I don’t think I’d like an always wet or moist vagina because I think that could lead to smells.  I know I’ll have to use lube for sex and I’m ok with that lol.
</p>
<p>
I honestly never had any pain as their pain management system was top tier.  Even right after surgery there was no pain.  I believe they had me on morphine, an epidural and pain pills too so I was good lol.
</p>
<p>
The first 3-4 months are crucial for dilation.  That’s when you really want to try REALLYYYYY hard to stick to whatever schedule your doctor gives you, preferably the first 6 months.  But I understand how difficult they can be.  I did my 3 times a day religiously for almost the first 4 months, then I went back to work so I started only doing twice a day which was before and after work, then I would go back and forth between twice a day and once a day.  Then at some point I just started doing once a day lol.  A couple of times a week I skip a day and haven’t had any issues.  I actually skipped last night lol.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is definitely a chore that you have to commit to though!

If I eat seafood it does which I hate that smell honestly.  Other than that, I don’t have a smell at all which I enjoy honestly!  Very minimal discharge too, enough to not be completely dry down there, but not enough to have an ugly site to see after taking off my panties for the day.

My urethra is kind of low unfortunately, it hasn’t caused any problems though so I’m ok with that.  I hear most of Chett’s urethra placement is typically lower.

Beautiful results. So very naturally, feminine. You mentioned clitoris play. Does she “rise” and appear in the way that a cisvagina does when aroused?

Hmmm good question.  I don’t know if she appears on her own because I normally just rub over the hood through my panties, I don’t get all the way in there.  Maybe if I was actually in the act with a man and a lot more turned on she would, but I haven’t experienced that yet.  Honestly I wish my clitoris would of been a tad bit bigger, but again I haven’t even came close to finding out the full potential of my kitty because my sex life doesn’t exist lol.
</p>
<p>
But sometimes even when I’m spreading my lips, she’s not so easily exposed so I’m not sure how it will be when aroused during fore play with a man.  I definitely can feel her throbbing when I turn myself on so I believe she dies rise, just not sure if she can find her own way out of her hood though lol.

This looks amazing. I see a few other people on here with Dr. Chettawut&#39;s work and I was wondering how long from calling to schedule a consult, to the consult, and then surgery if you don&#39;t mind me asking? Everyone here in the US seems to have 4 year long wait lists... and I really want to get in by the end of the year.

I got mine in 3 weeks, but I was in Thailand already and said I want the earliest booking spot. Which he provided as I was serious - I wanted my SRS done asap for my mental health. So they can be fast. Their hospital is state of the art! best experience, now im looking at getting fox eyes, but lets see if I really need it lol

I have my surgery scheduled with him in June! Was really happy to see how quickly I could get in over there. Going over to thailand early to have some of a vacation before sitting in the hospital for a month. I cannot wait!!!

You are looking fantastic now, I&#39;m basically 16 days post op, have a dehiscence just under the V, the size of a small finger nail and feel completely drained dilating 3 times a day I do hope this all gets better.

Thanks sister.  Are you a Chett girl too?  Trust me the 3 times a day is definitely a chore but you’ll get through it.  Just try to stay as positive as possible.  Watching really good shows that I was into helped me out a lot during dilating.  Since I had to do it so much, I had shows that I only watched while dilating so that I wouldn’t binge then all too soon lol.
</p>
<p>
As long as you’re not in any pain while dilating, there’s really nothing to be too upset about.  Think about it like you’re performing maintenance on your tool or instrument that you’ll be able to use for the rest of your life that will cause you fulfillment!
</p>
<p>
If I can help you with anything else, let me know!

I had Chett’s good ole Non-Penile Inverse lol.  It’s an older method, but definitely TRUSTED!  I know there are newer methods out, but I’m happy with mine so far.
</p>
<p>
And no he actually suggests that you don’t get electrolysis or laser beforehand as he removes all the hair follicles during surgery.  I have a few hairs about 1 inch into entrance of my canal but not in my canal itself if that makes sense lol.  I’m actually about to start getting laser down there because I notice that since the surgery, shaving down there breaks me out sooooo much worse than before the surgery for some reason!
</p>
<p>
For the surgery itself, I paid about $14k in American dollars which is like half a million or something in Thai Baht.

The $14k was just for the surgery.  I paid about $4k for the first class flight, and another $3k for the hotel.  I was there for 5 weeks.  Maybe another $500 in American money for food and additional supplies throughout my time there.

Looking fantastic, I hate the waiting so long before I get her, I can see it&#39;s worth it in the long run, but the wait ahhh. Sorry to ask, so you get a depth of your original when flaccid or aroused? Xx Tam

The wait im sucks but definitely worth it.  So I originally reached out to them in January of 2019 if I’m not mistaken.  And due to life, work and whatever else, I didn’t have mine until January of 2022.
</p>
<p>
And no I believe due to years of HRT my original length was shorter than the depth I got.  Chett uses more of your scrotum skin than he does the actual penis with his method so your before length really doesn’t matter!

I have had an orchiectomy, but am scared to go forward with full bottom surgery. I am in my seventies, so certainly not young. However I am slim and very fit and active. Do you have to keep dilating all your life or can you stop at some point. Thanks Kim

I am not post-op but have done tons of research and thought I&#39;d share with you what learned. From what I&#39;ve read, surgeons always say you need to dilate for life. Some surgeons say that sexual penetration can be substituted after 1 year or so.

<p>
From reading many posts from post-op women, many talk about reducing to a few times per week or less after 1 year or so. I have read a few posts from 1 year+ that say they stopped dilating completely and if I recall in those cases, they were having regular sexual penetration.

Any specific reccs for Black girls? In terms of healing, creams, just anything? I’ll be going to Banks in June and don’t know what to expect.

Im a chett girl too. Was the process of sizing up easy? The #3 dilator just won’t go in. I fear if I push too hard, I’ll tear something. It’s painful. If u had similar issue, how did u deal with it?

Honestly.... it&#39;s brutal. Tramadol, Diaz beforehand to relax me. Then I push it as far as I can, wait 10minutes, a little more. Sometimes taking it all out let it relax, put more lube and go back. Push the pain barrier (I know it sucks) but it&#39;s the only way. cry if you need. BUT know even if you don&#39;t get to depth the first try, take it as far as you can. Then go back. few hours later, do it again - go a little deeper. And repeat until you get to the depth you need to. Remember, the pain though can feel unbearable is your only route! Eventually it does go away, that I promise you.

Hi, I had tbis surgery about a year ago, I lost 4 inches and am still having to dilate to get it back. I only have a little over 2 and a half now, im not sure, I just know the dilator won’t go up to the first dot. I’m scared and desperate, can you tell me about your experience or link me to someone who can help me?
