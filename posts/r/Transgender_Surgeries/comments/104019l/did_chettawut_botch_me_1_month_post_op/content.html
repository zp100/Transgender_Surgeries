Looks very swollen. You can only wait and see what happens. If these issues do remain it looks like the kind of thing a revision should be able to easily sort out, but I‚Äôd heard quite a few cases where Chettawut refuses to do them.

Well if he/she refuses tell me why people even use someone like that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I&#39;m only on 9th month HRT and am a ways out for srs and unfortunately without insurance for time being and do no much about any of the Dr. except what I read about from you guys and I just wouldn&#39;t want a Dr. That pretty much rules out revisions that doesn&#39;t even sound like good practice. Like I build th400 transmission for racing and off road and I stand behind what I do because sometimes things just happen and go wrong without anyone at fault so to say but I have no problems with a redo not that I&#39;ve had any but my own but anyway would you want to spend $3-$5-K for me to build you a transmission and when you pick it up say here you go it&#39;s your baby don&#39;t break it good luck.  ?
</p>
<p>
Sh!t no you wouldn&#39;t and neither would anyone else and I&#39;d be done doing that.  To me just that kinda attitude would be a flag  and if people stopped using this Dr. I believe that attitude would change especially if They  wanted to continue this line of work. Is this DR. So good he/she can have a mindset like this. I&#39;m sorry but I could never have any dealing with someone like that.

Saw your comment above on a post from awhile back. In these cases, do you have any impression as to whether Dr. Chettawut was refusing to do the revision for free or refusing to do it at all even with additional payment?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got an email discussion going with his team right now and this is what they said when I asked them about revisions:
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<em>
Once everything is healed, Dr. Chettawut can perform cosmetic revisions if necessary. However, this can be considered after 6 months post-op and may incur an additional fee.
</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Thanks for any insights you may have!

That was a while ago, a bit hard to remember. However, I do recall one case of refusing even with additional payment.

I&#39;m sorry the other comments are correct I think you&#39;ll likely need a revision, the only upside of this is you have a lot of good tissue for the revision and it&#39;s better to be going into a revision with too much tissue than not enough. At least you won&#39;t need skin or tissue taken from legs or stomach.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had this treatment and I wish you the best in the future ‚ù§Ô∏è

Still swollen, but I suspect you will want an aesthetic revision.  The plus aide is that you seem to be healing well.

My opinion : it‚Äôs only botched if it doesn‚Äôt work , as in issues with the canal , urethra, clit and inability to orgasm. You‚Äôre still recovering. Give the swelling some time to go down , then test your new vagina  After the swelling has gone down it might look different and if you‚Äôre still not happy with the look getting a revision is definitely an option, you have options don‚Äôt worry
