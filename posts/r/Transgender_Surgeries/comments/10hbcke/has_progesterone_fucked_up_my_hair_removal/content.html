I&#39;ve recently started P4 (a few months)  and my pubic hair seems to have grown back completely. I was getting laser and electrolysis to remove it for srs but all the work seems to have been undone now. I&#39;ve been pretty inconsistent with taking the progesterone. Could the fluctuations in levels have made the hair grow back?

It’s possibly the laser. Electrolysis permanently kills hair no matter what; laser in some cases just stuns it. Hair that has been properly killed can never, ever return. It’s also possible that you’re seeing a new cycle of hair growth. It takes 12-18 months of full electrolysis clearance to permanently clear an area of hair. How long have you been having the hair removal?

over a year now and it&#39;s only recently started to grow back thick. The hairs were becoming thin and light coloured but they seem to have suddenly come back with full colour.

They shouldn’t be becoming thin and light colored; they just shouldn’t be coming back at all. It’s possible you’re not getting adequate treatment. By a year you should see very considerable reduction. If it’s all coming back I would get a second opinion with a well regarded electrologist with a lot of trans experience, because that’s not a good sign. I would not risk laser for this.

I&#39;ve only been getting 3 hours of electro every 6 weeks and because of my lack of pain tolerance it hasn&#39;t been very productive. There was very good hair reduction with some pretty big patches gone completely with only a few white vellus hairs left. Some patches still are but the majority seems to have grown back.

That’s not good. I strongly suggest finding a provider that can offer totally clearing every session. There are places that can do local blocks and totally take away the pain, allowing them to totally remove all the hair from the surgical area in 4-6 sessions and be done. If, after a year, you’re getting a ton of hair growth now then something isn’t right and I’d get a second look. There have been a lot posts from people this week alone who failed to get adequate hair removal and now have internal hair growth. Luckily you’re still in a place where you can prevent this. Good luck!

Where the hell do I get this in the UK? How do they remove the pain? I already use massive amounts of anaesthetic gel and other painkillers and they hardly do anything.

In the UK I don’t know. In the US I went to 2 different places. I had injectable anesthesia, not topical. It made a world of difference. With the injections I felt nothing, once the numbness set in. It was expensive and there was a bit of recovery because I had a lot of work done at once, but one clearing achieved better results than many, many hours of conventional electrolysis did. I had to pay out of pocket. I wish I could offer better advice but I don’t know much about the medical system there. Maybe ask your surgeon or GP for advice or referrals.

This usually is done with local injections, similar to when one is at the dentist. I&#39;m from Austria and closest to me is 2pass Clinic in Antwerp, Belgium. So might be the same for you, if there is no one in the UK. Flights to Brussels are usually really cheap from Austria, Train to Antwerp is 10-20€ depending if you fly to Brussels Central or Brussels Charleroi. 1 night in a hotel in Antwerp, 1/2 day appointment from morning to noon, then flying home again.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I cried there too the first time, but simply because of the relieve of having no pain at all. Having done over a year of mostly 1,5h sessions electrolysis because I couldn&#39;t stand the pain, this is my biggest relief right now. I actually find it very hardful to tell anyone that you just need to hold tight. People usually say electrolysis without injections is even worse than genital surgery or FFS.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the money: for me it seems to be on par with doing it locally, since the electrologist can work so much faster. Before, I twitched, needed a brake every few seconds, was completely worn out afterwards. With local injections it&#39;s more like &#34;oh, 4 hours have passed? well thanks, see you in a few weeks!&#34;

Look in the wiki here, there’s lots about controlling pain for electrolysis.
