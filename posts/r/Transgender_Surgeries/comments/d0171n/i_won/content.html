Completely meaningless post for many, but I won. I posted on reddit a few times about the issues I was having with dilation. The pain, how it would take several minutes, sometimes over 30 minutes to get the dilator inside the vaginal canal, and also the unfortunate odor from the mix of lube and whatever that would come out of the canal during dilation.
</p>
<p>
I won because I didn&#39;t give up dilating. I wanted to, I wanted to stop so badly. It hurt, it was messing my mind up, I was dreading dialting every day. Plus, I am a professional when it comes to giving up on things. But I didn&#39;t, somehow. This time I didn&#39;t give up.
</p>
<p>
And things improved! Sure, there still is a bit of pain when getting past the tight entrance of the vaginal canal, but it is nothing like feeling like my skin is being ripped apart at various places like before. The god awful odor is gone, and I can get the dilator inside in two, three minutes tops, which still isn&#39;t ideal but I will take that over several minutes of boredom and pain. And a plus is that I didn&#39;t need to increase the number of daily dilations for things to improve. I would be hating my life if I had to dilate three, four times a day. Two is already too much, IMO.
</p>

Thanks for reading. I needed to share this.

So happy for you...and a good reminder that dilation is HARD, but if you just stick to the regimen things get better for most.

Absolutely. I thought I was prepared to deal with it, but I wasn&#39;t. The most difficult thing is that it takes a long time. You don&#39;t dilate for two weeks and then that is it, so sooner or later you will most likely feel exhausted mentally and perhaps physically (many times I felt soreness in insides of my canal due to frequent dilations). It is definitely hard.

My time to depth numbers are still in the 1.5 to 3 hour range üò≠üò≠üò≠ I&#39;m two months post op Dr. Bank. It&#39;s not so bad though, it doesn&#39;t really hurt at all, just takes a long time to get all the way to depth.
</p>
<p>
But congratulations!!! Keep it up!!!

I heard Suporn and Banks patients have a longer and rougher recovery, so perhaps that is not unusual. I am hoping things improve soon for you!

This is true, I have lots of friends from my time there and while mine is definitely long, it&#39;s not the longest and after 3-5 month I usually drops off pretty quick. Best wishes!

That&#39;s wonderful, I know how hard you were finding it so I&#39;m just so pleased things are improving for you. Hopefully you&#39;ll keep on making improvements, you&#39;ve earned it with your persistence. You should be really proud of yourself!!!

I ended up in emergency the other night after work with a soft lump I&#39;d had overnight on one of the outer vulva incision lines. It&#39;d burst during the  day and had bled a little but no pus and turned out to be a stitch abscess so I&#39;m now on antibiotics.

I didn&#39;t expect it to be this hard. What I was worrying about the most before surgery was the trip back home, because I had surgery in Bangkok, and I live in South America. Like I expected, the trip was not fun.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, not everyone has a lot of trouble with dilation, maybe you will get lucky.
