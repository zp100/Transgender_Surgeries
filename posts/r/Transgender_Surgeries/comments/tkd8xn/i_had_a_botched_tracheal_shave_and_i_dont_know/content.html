<strong>
UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER (SEPT 2023)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I got a lot of messages so I decided to post an update. It got a lot better.
</p>
<p>
I went for a second opinion one year ago. This doctor also told me I have overactive false vocal cords, probably because of the operation. He said that my false vocal folds are overactive, because my real voice muscles are probably weakened after surgery. Either because of the operation itself or because of the anesthasia air pipe. This doctor told me to do (careful) singing exercises to make the real muscles stronger, so that if I go to higher pitches my false vocal folds don’t want to help anymore because they don’t need to. I tried doing this for over a year now. It definitely improved my voice. There seems to be more improvement to make still, but I&#39;m working on it. So my advice to anyone in the same position as me two years ago: first get checked by an ENT looking inside your throat and take conclusions after that, otherwise you don’t know what could be causing the voice problems. Good luck and I wish you the best.
</p>

<strong>
ORIGINAL POST EARLY 2022
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had my tracheal shave 4 months ago. The visual result is great, but I&#39;m left with voice problems.
</p>
<p>
In the first two weeks after I had the worst possible voice, but it came back mostly within that period. Unfortunately there are a few things that did not recover till this day (not even one percent):
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I lost my upper pitch range.
<ul>
<li>
Above 230hz: Low quality
</li>
<li>
Above 270hz: No sound, only air
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I completely lost my ability to reach falsetto (sing high notes)
</li>
<li>
My voice has some weird sound to it when I&#39;m tired
</li>
<li>
Sometimes at normal pitch, parts of a word can change into air
</li>
</ul>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I went to the ENT doctor who operated me, 2 months after the surgery. She did laryngoscopy together with another voice specialist and they said everything looked good. But they did say I have a lot of muscle tension and my false vocal cords are overactive when trying to reach higher notes. She says that&#39;s the cause for my pitch loss, but I think she&#39;s wrong. I think these false vocal folds just want to help because I can&#39;t do it anymore since my tracheal shave surgery.
</p>
<p>
I tried sooooo much already, including voice therapy with a specialist, but nothing seems to work or change anything in my limitations, not even one percent.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m completely lost. Anyone who has advice for me what to do now? Or any success stories in which it healed later on? Or any explanation on why the doctors diagnosis after laryngoscopy could be either the cause, or the result of my voice loss after tracheal shave.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
PS1: Incision is high up
</p>
<p>
PS2: I have a video of the laryngoscopy for any specialist who wants to double check my vocal folds

Thanks for your reply! I&#39;m happy for you it recovered. Yeah it&#39;s a hell mentally.. How was your recovery? Was it suddenly or slowly? Did you do something specific for healing? Have you had an ENT doctor look at your vocal folds at some point, and did you get some sort of diagnosis?

Thank you. Last question: Was the incision right on the adam&#39;s apple, or more above in the neck? Because if it&#39;s right on the adam&#39;s apple it could have been either skin adhesion or excess scar tissue for you. Scar tissue can take years to heal.
</p>
<p>
For me the incision is more above in the neck, so adhesion isn&#39;t a problem, but I do feel there is scar tissue tho. But I can&#39;t find any reason on why that would be a problem for the voice when the scar is so high up.

Not to say you&#39;re wrong, but I come from classical singing and know a lot about the impact of vocal strain. It&#39;s possible you tried to go back to falsetto/girlvoice too early and wore out your larynx.
</p>
<p>
Have you had any extended periods where you rested your voice, speaking as little as possible, and, when you do speak, doing so in comfortable deeper &#34;boy&#34; register? I know that can suck but it sounds to me like strain injuries more than surgical ones. I had a similar thing happen after my tracheal shave, where I got scared about not being able to falsetto or girlvoice anymore and overdid it. Voices are really delicate, and especially after surgery any amount of strain can do a lot of damage.

Thanks for your reply! In the first 2 weeks after surgery I couldn&#39;t talk, but I whispered when I needed to say something, because I didn&#39;t know that was a bad thing at that time. In the first two months after surgery I rested my voice as much as possible in the hope it would get better, but it never happened.
</p>
<p>
If I did strain my voice that way, shouldn&#39;t it be visible somehow through laryngoscopy?
</p>
<p>
And If I did, is it able to heal itself and how long would it take if that&#39;s the case? I do feel a sore throat a lot.

Btw, how long did it exactly take for you to heal? And how did you notice? Was it slowly getting better over time, or you suddenly realized you had higher pitch again at some point? I&#39;m asking this because for me I haven&#39;t had any improvement in 4 monhts.

Not sure this helps at all but I remember Samantha Lux did a video on her trachea shave correction surgery - took her a long time to figure out what was wrong - and TransVoiceLessons did a thing about trachea shave complications. Can&#39;t remember if they reference specific surgeons who are knowledgeable on this or not

Thanks. I watched Samanta Lux her video before and I understood that she found out her voice problems came through adhesion of the scar to the underlying tissue. Her scar was right on the adam&#39;s apple. She also had trouble swallowing. For me, the scar is on the upper neck, so adhesion cannot be the cause.
</p>
<p>
I also watched the video of transvoicelessons, and altough it greatly increased my knowledge about what can happen after tracheal shave, It didn&#39;t seem to give a clear picture on what I could have. I mailed her with some questions also, but I didn&#39;t get an answer.

I had a trachea shave and I did not experience this problem. My incision high as well. I  don&#39;t think the surgeon should do anything that changes anything on the inside of your trachea. I talked to my surgeon at length about this prior to my surgery and he said that it should not alter my voice at all and it did nt.

My surgeon assured me they only worked on the outside of the trachea and not the inside. Also they never had someone with voice problems after the surgery, yet here I am :(

If they had to put a ventilator in you to to do this I&#39;d say that&#39;s it, two friends had covid and had ventilators, their voices were eft up for about a year, I had hernia surgery and had ventilators all 3 times and I had a hoarse voice for a long time afterwards.

I did think about this, but I kinda ruled it out after I did laryngoscopy, because I thought it should be visible through laryngoscopy. I might be wrong though.
</p>
<p>
Do you know if your friends, or yourself, had laryngoscopy and noticed something during the time these voice problems were present?

Actually the attending nurse for me said my voice would come back in time but she said it could take up to a year, but it took only 3 months, one of my friends though  waited a year for his voice to come back fully, neither of us had laryngoscopy .

But shouldnt the damage you&#39;re talking about be visible through laryngoscopy then? Cause they said I had healthy vocal folds and assured me they did the operation carefully.

I&#39;m mostly scared this is the issue, because not being able to put more tension on it causes the sound to change into air at higher pitch. But I thought this was called &#34;Anterior Commisure Detatchment&#34; and I thought this was visible through laryngoscopy. Or am I wrong and is this a seperate issue?

Rest your voice, stop trying to force it, and speak a little as possible, traquea shave surgery does not give this complication, intubation May do it

This is counter to what Dr. Rosen at UCSF just told me, and he&#39;s an oto surgeon and trach shave expert. Can you provide some more explanation?

Thanks for your reply. Dr. Thomas indeed has a page about Anterior Commisure Detatchment. Altough my limitations are the same, he says on his website that endoscopy should reveal &#34;convex vocal cords&#34;. I have had an endoscopy and they told me it looks fine, other than muscle tension and overactive false vocal folds.

It&#39;s been a while but I remember seeing a video where a girl had the same issues after a trach shave. It ended up being skin sticking to the larynx so reaching a bright resonance and high frequencies was harder if not impossible.
</p>
<p>
She fixed it with a simple revision tho.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Found the video:

Edit Edit: Saw that someone else mentioned this before.
