I‚Äôm just going to put this here, and not discredit this man any longer after all is said. I made a post a few years back advocating for Dr. Jess Ting in regards to my GRS experience. Not only have I lost depth after dilating constantly since my operation, but the scarring and aesthetic of my neovagina is unbelievable. It has completely ruined my confidence as a woman and thank the universe that I can still be sexually active. A difficult task but still able. He claims to be the best in his field but I truly think this man is tired and full of himself. He will make empty promises and provide ‚ú®less than mediocre‚ú®results every time. I am fully withdrawing my praise for him as a ‚Äúleading‚Äù surgeon in this field of medicine. Unless you want a lopsided, botched, and poorly revised looking puss, then I suggest you consider some other options for GRS. This is your body, your choice! Please don‚Äôt make the wrong choice. üíú

Had a bunch of weird advocates for this surgeon on a previous thread praising this surgeon to no end... So sorry to hear about your experience with this surgeon. The other thread I&#39;m speaking of was regarding FFS, but I think surgical skills can be translated to other areas as well.

Yes! I‚Äôve seen so many people gassing this man up like he‚Äôs the only one who can help.. On top of that he just  gives off weird cocky vibes. Never was into it and never will be. I found some amazing surgeons who do great minor revisions!

Based off his credentials, he is just a surgeon! Based off true patient stories‚Ä¶ he is a mediocre surgeon who does a half ass job at actually reconstructing peoples bodies. Explore other options people!

Bowers too. My housemate had surgery with Bowers a couple of years ago, she called Bowers office reporting an infection, she was told that‚Äôs impossible, Bowers patients don‚Äôt get infections. It wasn‚Äôt until my housemate‚Äôs fever passed 104 degrees that she was given antibiotics. She could have died.

God. Bowers has always come across as so toxically-prideful and full of herself. This doesn‚Äôt surprise me in the slightest.

I&#39;m sorry you feel bad about your surgeon. And forgive me but I&#39;m going to play devils advocate. But your surgeon is not in control of how your body heels.

Yea so, definitely true when you say that they‚Äôre not in control of the healing itself, but unfortunately they are responsible for the majority of the outcome after all wounds have healed. My surgery was 4+ years ago and I just continue to lose depth little over time no matter the aftercare we have to upkeep. He promises nearly perfect results, and very cocky about it too. Well he shouldn‚Äôt be because he even did my revision and my puss looks like it was ran over by the bandwagon itself. People just need to do more research and get more opinions. He is good, but there is GREAT. If you can afford and have the luxury of going to Ting, then you can definitely afford to look around before settling. (speaking generally)

I&#39;m sorry you have had a bad experience. My pi surgery was performed by Dr Rachel Bluebond-Langner and Dr Zhao at NYU Langone Hospital in 2017. I lost depth. So I went back to them and had PPT revision surgery almost 11 months ago. Everything turned out fine.

Yeah, it sucks that OP isn‚Äôt happy, but no one is perfect. My partner is a Ting patient and her results are pretty great and her friend is also a Ting patient, also very nice results (from what she says, I don‚Äôt go around scoping out my girlfriends‚Äô friends genitals lol).

I thought you were happy with results in your original post?
</p>
<p>
Is it just how it‚Äôs healed you‚Äôre not happy with the issues you‚Äôve faced? As you seemed happy with him and the results early on.

I definitely was coming down from a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù in a sense that I was very proud that I had gone through this process. I was boasting about my experience and having the body I always dreamed of, but can clearly see now that I was just needing a way to vent. I did have a wonderful experience with my entire stay in NY, but looking back, Dr. Ting had promised me specific results that just seemed too good to be true. Again, nothing but mediocre results. I have seen extraordinary SRS results with other surgeons and I just want people to know to explore their options!
