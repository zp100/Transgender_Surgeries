Uncommon at 19 days, but you&#39;ll be fine, I swear it. They will close and heal. Keep everything clean and far from bacterial, fungal infections,  erc. My dehiscences were 40% of the suture points, from middle to the comisure (perineal), and both labia were extreeeeemely swollen (full of a massive blood cloths that reansorbed 4 months later). It looked really nasty and &#34;permanently botched&#34;. It helped really nice, then. Our body is amazing...
</p>
<p>
But I can tell you&#39;ll be fine in like, 2 months, if not before. Eat plenty of protein, and water, lots of water.
</p>
<p>
Long hug, stay calm, this is what it is, and it will PASS SOONER THAN LATE.

You should familiarize yourself with healing by second intention. This is the trajectory the your recover is likely to take. I agree that it will heal better than you anticipate, but it will also take longer. The following is from wikipedia and I found it to be a basic roadmap for serious wound dehiscence.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Secondary intention
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Secondary intention is implemented when primary intention is not possible because of significant tissue damage or loss, usually due to the wound having been created by major trauma.
</li>
<li>
The wound is allowed to granulate.
</li>
<li>
Surgeon may pack the wound with a gauze or use a drainage system.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Granulation results in a broader scar. * Healing process can be slow due to presence of drainage from infection.
</p>
<p>
Wound care must be performed daily to encourage wound debris removal to allow for granulation tissue formation. * Using antibiotics or antiseptics for the surgical wound healing by secondary intention is controversial. * Examples: gingivectomy, gingivoplasty, tooth extraction sockets, poorly reduced fractures, burns, severe lacerations, pressure ulcers. * There is insufficient evidence that the choice of dressings or topical agents affects the secondary healing of wounds. * There is lack of evidence for the effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy in wound healing by secondary intention.

If your surgeon was anyone else other than Marci Bowers, I might be concerned.
</p>
<p>
But look: You just had yiur procedure done by the premier gender affirmation surgeon in the country--and certainly one of the best in the world.
</p>
<p>
Truly, don&#39;t worry. If she says it&#39;ll get bettering not to worry, who else on the planet is better qualified to tell you that?
</p>
<p>
This is the most important moment in your life. The end of a very long and tough journey. You got the RollsRoyce of gender reassignment surgeries, done by a doctor whose already a
<a href="https://legend.It" rel="nofollow">legen It
</a>
&#39;s like getting s heart transplant by DeBakey.
</p>
<p>
Holy cow!!!
</p>
<p>
Drink in this wonderful time of your life. These are moments you&#39;ll alway6sb remember and cherish over your lifetime. Try really hard to9 actually enjoy the pain, the discomfort, and yes, even the worry--because your surgery is really special, performed by someone who is already hugely important band special in the rarified world of gender affirmation surgery.
</p>
<p>
So hang in there, girlfriend. It WILL get better.
</p>
<p>
You are incredibly brave to have come this far. Hold on for a few work weeks or months or whatever,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so excited for you. Mine is scheduled in a month in San Francisco, and I am already so freaking over the moon about it that I can hardly sleep.
</p>
<p>
This really IS the time of your life!!!!

Marci Bowers is one of my life heroes.
</p>
<p>
What a shame you feel it necessary  to shit on my opinion about a wonderful woman and a fabulous surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I feel sorry for people like you who feel compelled to do emotional strafing runs on  others --and on purpose...

It&#39;s perfectly fine for you to idolize Dr. Bowers. But that reply was so over the top it comes off as insane.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d also like to make sure any patient is actively encouraged to get cyclical feedback from their surgeon instead of assuming everything is fine.

Ok. Your opinion. This woman asked for reassurance, and that&#39;s what I was trying to give her.  The fact that she has one of the top gender surgeons in the world on her team does indeed make a difference, whether you want to admit that or not. I don&#39;t believe I told her not to check in with Dr. Bowers when it is prudent to do so, I simply said that if Dr. Bowers tells her not to worry, then it makes sense to believe her doctor up to a certain point and NOT to worry so much and calm down a bit.
