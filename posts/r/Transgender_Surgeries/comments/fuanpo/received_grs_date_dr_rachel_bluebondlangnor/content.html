Agreed it is a distant appointment, however, I was assured that once I complete the genital electrolysis I can ask placement on the surgery cancellation list for an earlier surgery opportunity.

<p>
I have come to understand that when you want to roll with the best in the world, you have to be willing to wait. To answer your question,

Can you describe what she wants for electrolysis? She is who I would like to go with as well, and preparing for the pain I‚Äôll endure is all I can do at the moment. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

If you use a numbing cream you won‚Äôt even feel it. But the shaft, one since around the base and all of your scrotum pretty much.

I‚Äôve read other posts on this sub about how painful these treatments can be. As a result, I‚Äôve arranged appointments at the Papillon Center for genital electrolysis with anesthetic administered by Dr. McGinn. I hope the extra cost will provide a lesser margin of ‚Äúdiscomfort!‚Äù I plan to post about the experience.

That‚Äôs totally an option too! For me, I was not about traveling that far and dishing out that much money at once. Numbing cream worked for me. I was able to fall asleep.

I chose the Papillon Center for several reasons.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Because, at the time, I could not find a reputable salon that provides genital electrolysis treatments anywhere in my state. I sure came across a number of shady folks who were happy to take my money, though! üò≥
</li>
<li>
Because it is the center established by Dr. Christine McGinn, a world renowned GRS surgeon, and if anyone would have the experience to help me achieve the results I have to have, it‚Äôs her staff.
</li>
<li>
The Papillon Center will provide a receipt that is correctly coded to meet insurance requirements for obtaining reimbursement for the treatments.

Sorry for the delayed response. Dr. Jun told me all the penile and around the base have to be removed, including the scrotum and the entire perineum. I had electrolysis appointments scheduled with the Papillon Center for April and May which were canceled (understandably) because they closed. I‚Äôm hoping my June appointment is still a go.

Covid-19 has nothing to do with the over a year wait.  My surgery date was a year and a half after my consult (Consult March 2019, Stage 1 September 2020).  I&#39;m jealous that OP&#39;s was only just over a year.

Wait, really? I had my consult March of last year and a surgery date of early Fall this year - so basically 18 months in total. From the look of things, you just had your consult, so that would be 13 months total. My understanding was that her wait list was increasing, not decreasing - and that was *before* coronavirus threw a curveball to scheduling.

To quote from the movie A Few Good Men, ‚ÄúThese are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.‚Äù Please understand, the last thing I want is to come across as arrogant. I put myself out here like many others on this sub with the intent to help our community by sharing lessons learned on my journey to living my Truth.
</p>
<p>
I am aware my circumstances may not be the norm, or maybe the stars just suddenly aligned in my favor. In my opinion, this all started rolling for me almost immediately upon submitting my surgery package to NYU-Langone. While I waited for many months to qualify time wise to obtain the final letter I needed, I worked very hard and ensured every single box in those 25-some pages received a ‚úîÔ∏èmark. I submitted a complete, well organized package. I was determined that by the time of the original consult date (February 2021) I would give no reason for Dr. RBb-L to not take me on as a patient.
</p>
<p>
As it turned out, with the exception of having the genital electrolysis (related to difficulty getting insurance to approve the treatments, which were clearly covered in their 2020 benefits brochure, a whole other story) I strived to be a solid candidate and Dr. RBb-L rewarded my efforts when she told me she approved me as a patient on Tuesday, this week.
</p>
<p>
I am humbly grateful things turned out the way they have. I intend to share my experiences in the hope it helps others by providing encouragement that you CAN do this, and avoid my missteps along the way to living their truth. I wish for you all that Life treats you kind . . .

Oh I&#39;m not accusing you of anything. It&#39;s just really surprising. I walked into my consult basically all ready to go (all 3 letters in hand, just doing maintenance on electrolysis, etc.), got the actual surgery date a week after the consult, and have been waiting on the surgery cancellation list since then (to no avail, unfortunately). And since she seems to only be getting more popular, I would have assumed the wait list would be *at least* as long now, and likely even longer with coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;ve gotten so many different answers about scheduling when I&#39;ve tried calling about surgery dates opening up, so who knows? Maybe you got lucky ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
