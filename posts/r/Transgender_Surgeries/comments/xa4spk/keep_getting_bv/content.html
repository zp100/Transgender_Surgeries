Hi all, I keep getting Bacteria vaginosis (BV). I am not sure what to do and neither do my doctor&#39;s. I am on an oral Vaginal probiotic from Olly. I use a perry bottle with warm water after dilating. Is there anything else I can do?

I&#39;m presuming your doctor has prescribed an ANTI-biotic at some point?
</p>
<p>
You can try switching to cheapie saline for a bit? Get yourself some jugs of distilled water, add some iodine-free salt (often called Kosher salt in some countries) at a ratio of 10 grams per liter. Saline does not cure BV but it reduces symptoms and would make you much more comfortable.

Salt in the douche water stops the smell almost straight away.

Anecdotal evidence from some random person on the internet, but I was getting BV regularly for months but then I had read that boric acid suppositories can help. Seeing as how metronidazole and stuff weren&#39;t really working I said why not I&#39;m desperate and sure as shit the boric acid helped. Did it make it stop permanently? Nope. But when I notice it coming back I just use the suppositories for a few nights and am good again.
</p>
<p>
Coincidentally I read in one of the above comments about the surgilube and I&#39;m still using that myself. So what the poster said could indeed be the case. I&#39;m going to try switching from surgilube to something else to see if that helps prevent the bv from coming back.

You can try this. Mix 3% hydrogen peroxide and water in a 1:5 ratio and use that whenever you occassionally douche, and use that in your peri bottle whenever you need to give a quick outside rinse. It&#39;ll kill off some of the unwanted bacteria while helping you establish a healthy bacterial flora.
</p>
<p>
Long story short, some of the good bacteria, lactobacillus, tries to keep the unwanted stuff in check/balance by producing small amounts of peroxide that changes the environment slightly enough so the bad stuff can&#39;t survive, letting the wanted bacteria settle in without, and you can help this process along a bit with diluted hydrogen peroxide. It needs to be diluted though, so that it doesn&#39;t just kill off everything and also cause harm.
</p>
<p>
Also if you are using a lube with glycerin in it, switch away from that. The glycerin breaks down into sugars that promote yeast or bv.

I use Surgilube. It is a lubricant made of natural water-soluble gums that also contains the antiseptic chlorhexidine gluconate. I was told to use this because it is a thicker lube.

This explains some actually. Surgilube is great for use when you are recovering because it is what is called bacteriostatic. That means it kills off bacteria, helping with recovery because there&#39;s less chance of an infection in the healing tissues before they fuse healed fully. It is basically nuking the bacteria on the surface of the vaginal canal every time it is used.
</p>
<p>
However, if you are recovered and still using Surgilube every time you dilate, then it is also likely preventing the establishment of a healthy bacterial flora because it indiscriminately kills off the good with the bad, and that means when cleaned out afterward, the unwanted bacteria that survived on the exterior surfaces have a nice new empty non-hostile environment to move into and flourish unimpeded by the removed good bacteria, and this happens over and over. While yes, this kills the bad stuff too, the bad stuff is all that can recover after, which you don&#39;t want.
</p>
<p>
You can try switching to a pH balanced lube like Good Clean Love&#39;s BioNude and that should help. It is a liquid lube so it is not thick like the Surgilube gel, but it should help fight your issue. One thing to be aware of is that a tiny bit of liquid lube will go a long way and last a long time, so don&#39;t pour a ton on the dilator, just start with a small amount and add more only if you need more.

Update: July 25 I had granulation tissue treated with silver nitrate. The area was inside the vaginal canal. The dead tissue never came out and stayed inside and caused the BV.  During my metronidazole treatment I noticed gray specks coming out on my pad the next day.

Hey there :) I know I’m responding very late lol, but I’m in a similar boat as you were before. Once you were treated with silver nitrate, did the BV symptoms come back? Did you need multiple treatments?

Oral probiotics are useless for your vagina.
</p>
<p>
Unless you&#39;re getting poop from your own ass into your vagina, those probiotics are never making it there.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know why so many doctors seem convinced that this works. It doesn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
If you want to use a probiotic for the vagina get one designed for the vagina and put it in the vagina

They tested my flora in my vagina before starting the probiotic and it was group b strep. And they told me to start this probiotic. After starting the probiotic I had less symptoms of the group b strep.  I think the main reason I&#39;m having the BV now is because I have granulation tissue. My provider took the swab in the area of the granulation tissue.

If it&#39;s a straight forward PI then the skin is essentially the same as it was pre-op and doesn&#39;t magically transform into mucosa or something.
</p>
<p>
Personally I use salted water and it stops smelling. I honestly can&#39;t see how it could support cis type flora as it is not the same environment.
</p>
<p>
It can however support a flora environment that is similar to a natal vagina with BV. That&#39;s why it needs cleaning when it smells.
