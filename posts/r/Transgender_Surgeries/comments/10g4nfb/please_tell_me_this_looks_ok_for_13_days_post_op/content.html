You definitely walked around way, way more than you should. It‚Äôs essential that you‚Äôve avoid bending and straining and anything that could tear stitches or raise your blood pressure. Let your doctor know and make sure that no damage was done. However, two weeks is very early in the healing process and it‚Äôs perfectly normal for things to still be swollen and look pretty crazy. I still noticed swelling decreasing for about six months. I would say the results that look ‚Äúnormal‚Äù at two weeks are the exception rather than the rule.

No, not the surgeon. It‚Äôs really the person. Some people just don‚Äôt swell much and heal really fast. There is really nothing the surgeon can do another that. I‚Äôve seen people at 10 days after surgery that looked better than I did at 6 weeks. This can create a false idea that this is to be expected when really it‚Äôs sort of an outlier and there is a range of what is normal. Now, obviously, a really bad surgeon might cause more bruising or something but that‚Äôs outside the scope of this.
</p>
<p>
I totally understand the isolation thing, just be careful. Nobody‚Äôs saying you have to hide in bed, but you don‚Äôt want bad scars or a revision. I am convinced I caused my breast implant failure by being too active because I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äútoo bad‚Äù for example; and it took a long journey to fix. And I thought I was being pretty cautious. Happy healing and I hope this helps.

If I&#39;m ever blessed enough to get my surgery, there&#39;s is nothing on this green Earth that would make me stray from my after care. At that point, I&#39;ve waited way too long and invested way too much to risk it.
</p>
<p>
Hope the rest of your recovery goes well. ‚ù§Ô∏è From what I understand and have seen (I&#39;ve researched for literal years) swelling is normal for a very long time for most.

Yea, it helped a lot with my swelling.  Still sore down there at day 22 for me, but ice helps a bit with pain and swelling.  Just don‚Äôt leave it on too long or you could delay your nerves waking back up

Well, it looks to be healing well considering the walking.  When the swelling goes down you will have a better idea of what you got.  It looks like you may want to consider a cosmetic revision in the future.

Rule 1. Be respectful to others, including identity and choices in surgery. Be polite and engage in civil discourse.
