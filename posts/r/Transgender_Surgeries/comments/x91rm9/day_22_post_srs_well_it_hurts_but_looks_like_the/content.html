I&#39;m always worried when you say you are in pain, which seems to be quite a good amount. Pain is really hard on healing as it triggers body stress responses. Are you getting enough pain management?
</p>
<p>
Make sure you are advocating for yourself. No one knows what you feel, and it&#39;s typical to try and push too hard early on and hurt your healing. You need to be hyper selfish for awhile.

When I say pain, is something tolerable. Because if it isn&#39;t then I would have already entered the hospital again. So don&#39;t worry to much, I&#39;m fine as far as it goes. There&#39;s times that it hurts a lot and I scream but those are just a few times a day and it&#39;s when I do a bad move or something I shouldn&#39;t.

An area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe labia minora of the vagina that goes down until it is very close to the urethra. And that&#39;s necrosis.

Is the necrosis a natural part of the healing process?

No, it&#39;s a complication. So yeah I had the bad luck of having it. But the surgeon told me that it would fall down alone with time and that I should clean it very well 2 a day till 19 September when I have a revision with him. And this Monday I have a date with a surgeon here in my city where he is gonna take a look and tell me if everything it&#39;s fine. And I keep contact with my surgeon and send him photos if I see something strange.

Make sure that you are taking in protein to help with the healing.  It does look better, but still is concerning.  Keep your head up girl.üëç

I wanna piggy-back this with how much we all appreciate you sharing this extremely personal and difficult experience you‚Äôre having with all of us.
</p>
<p>
We all know there are complications but we don‚Äôt often hear anything beyond a word salad explanation to tell us what it‚Äôs like to go through it.
</p>
<p>
We really are cheering for your success!

Thank you so much. It&#39;s hard but it&#39;s going, and yeah... I see a lot of good posts and no complications surgeries here. So I thought about doing a daily view of the recovery so people can see that with complications things don&#39;t have to go wrong all the time.

I notice in previous post you say you didnt finish electrolysis‚Ä¶‚Ä¶please keep vagina area clean since you see necrosis.
</p>
<p>
That will fall off‚Ä¶do not peel off. Necrosis hopefully stopped. Structurally your clitoris and inner labia and urethral are affected‚Ä¶so sorry this has happened to you. Your doctor did not help you and he should be avoided future trans feminine people getting surgery in your area.

My doctor is helping me with everything he can. I&#39;m not from the place where I did the surgery. I have revision with him on 19 September. And the electrolysis, well... Are u gonna pay it for me? I&#39;m poor and thanks to social security here in Spain the surgery was free. And like I said I know a girl who got the surgery the day before me and she didn&#39;t have any complications and have a beautiful vagina. I got a complication, things happen. But you don&#39;t have to say that because one person got something bad because of my body, that&#39;s fault of the surgeon and that he shouldn&#39;t do any more SRS. I contact him every time I see something strange and he replies, I&#39;m just 23 days post op. It&#39;s not like the end of the world and just go look throw the 22 posts of my surgery and u will see improvement. And of course I&#39;m cleaning my vagina everyday twice a day and changing everything post dilatation so I keep it clean.

That is great!  Looks like the necrosis is indeed very self contained with attached tissue looking very healthy!  This is all a really good sign.  Huggles!  Just keep doing what you&#39;re doing and you&#39;ll be okay!
