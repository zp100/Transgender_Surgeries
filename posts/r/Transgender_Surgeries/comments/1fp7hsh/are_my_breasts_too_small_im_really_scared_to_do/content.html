If you weren&#39;t on this subreddit - I would have presumed you were cis. That is just my gut instinct.
</p>
<p>
If you want to do more with your body well... its your body. But at the same time, it looks good - and you shouldn&#39;t go for anything you don&#39;t feel 200% comfortable in doing.

go to
<a href="/r/normalnudes">r/normalnudes
</a>
and take a look.  Your boobs are well within the range, shape, and size of cis womens. Another way to check is the range of bra sizes. you fit. But if u want to go bigger do it. Just be mindful of the risks. And implants only last so long. Fat transfer is a safer option.

I have had a fat transfer to my breasts, going for a second round in a few weeks. Don&#39;t expect implant like results in one go because that is just not possible but you can still achieve very nice results... It will cost a lot more but if you are done then you are done for the rest of your life because it is your own tissue and you don&#39;t need replacements every 10 to 15 years like with implants

Same... honestly every woman I&#39;ve spoken to with larger areolas typically end up with phenomenal late stage breath growth.

nah girl, you&#39;re gorgeous! Only you can tell you if your breasts are too small. If it would make you happier to have larger ones, do it! If you are satisfied as is, love your body and live happy!
</p>
<p>
Focusing on your own happiness instead of your body and how it is perceived is the path to the holy land of fulfillment and joy.

Not at all tbh. Your body reads as cis female, I think they fit your frame. Chest size varies a lot for cis women so it’s completely within reason to have a smaller chest.

Honestly, in my opinion you look great.
</p>
<p>
But it’s about how you feel. If you are still having dysphoria it might be something to consider. My doc said best to wait until after three years have passed before seriously considering any procedure because they will Continue to develop in that time.
</p>
<p>
If you are still working with a therapist they may be able to help you find ways to see yourself in a better light.
</p>
<p>
I decided to not have the procedure myself. My friend had one and she said of the available gender surgeries, the BA was by far the easiest on her.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: no, You aren’t too small. I would say Only Do the surgery if it will help with your dysphoria

It&#39;s up to you and in some respects why would you ask us?!
</p>
<p>
In my opinion they look pretty good on you and you can dress them up, dress them down and do whatever you like once you&#39;ve got boobs that size. A friend of mine can make hers look like DDs with the right bra and secret help. It&#39;s whether YOU want your boobs to be a bit bigger or firmer or whatever YOU want all of the time.
</p>
<p>
There is no such thing as too small, and yours definitely aren&#39;t, and I&#39;d kill for a boost to that cup size from the fried eggs I&#39;ve got at the moment...

All breasts of all sizes and shapes are amazing!
</p>
<p>
The only person whose opinion matters on them is the person on whose body they are.
</p>
<p>
If you want to change them, then that’s the right call. If you don’t want to change them, then that’s the right call.
</p>
<p>
I would encourage you to not feel you have to change out of insecurity - anybody who doesn’t appreciate your body for what it is doesn’t deserve you.

They look fine with wonderful areolae. Don&#39;t cut back on the E because you have had the surgery. They will grow some more yet. Add progesterone if you don&#39;t use it already.

If you feel bigger suits what you want more then you should go for it ♥️
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;m biased and think bigger is always better lol (within what one feels comfortable with of course). I think your body could definitely suit larger, but small boobs work just fine too

They look absolutley fine to me. Maybe what mine looked like about 3 years on HRT. Recently i have put on a bit of weight and stopped running. It&#39;s mostly gone to my breasts and was a lot cheaper and was painless compared to a BA.
</p>
<p>
Tbh i would swap some of my cup to have your areola.

I couldn’t believe it when I saw the sub.  Your body is really beautiful as it is right now. If you’re scared of doing another surgery, don’t. Your breast have a normal size. You look 10000% cis

you look perfectly fine to me. this is anecdotal but a friend of mine&#39;s breasts went up like a two cup sizes in the year after her bottom surgery and I&#39;ve heard of that happening to several other girls as well. give your body some time to adjust and see what happens before you decide on any surgical interventions.

Likely 50% of natal females in the entire World have breasts the same size as you and much smaller.  You are doing well. Your areola shape suggests you gave much more to come and you’ll fill out much more.  Be careful what you wish for. Our bodies are a process of stages over our lifetime and you the rest of your life to find out.

Your complete body looks feminin. And the size of your breasts fits perfectly with your bodyframe. In combination with those beautiful aureolas nobody would think otherwise then that you&#39;re a girl. You rock this babe!

There&#39;s no right answer to this question.
</p>
<p>
Some folks like big boobs. Some folks like small boobs. Some folks like ALL boobs.
</p>
<p>
Do you like your boobs? Do they feel small to you OR are you actually fine with them but feel like others will think they&#39;re too small?
</p>
<p>
If
<em>
you
</em>
feel they&#39;re too small then it&#39;s not unreasonable to get them enlarged if you can afford it. It&#39;s a pretty safe surgery AFAIK.

Only my opinion, but I feel your breast fit your body really well. Also they look great!  Love how dark and large your areolas are. Wish I had a bit more of that.

No. I wouldn&#39;t have any idea you&#39;re trans. So if you make them bigger that is not trans thing in my eye but same thing when cis women make their boobs bigger. But in my eye your current size fits to your body well.

Breasts come in all shapes and sizes, whether cis or trans. There&#39;s nothing here that reads male if that&#39;s your concern.
</p>
<p>
Plenty of cis women get breast augmentations too. It&#39;s perfectly fine to want that, but you certainly don&#39;t NEED it.

I know you’ll probably roll your eyes, but I’ll do the mom thing and say that the only thing that matters is what makes YOU feel good about your body. If you’re happy with them then great! If not, then go for surgery if that’s an option for you! We all start off transitioning for ourselves and it’s easy to get lost in the opinions and perceptions of others.

You look like a smaller breasted cis woman. There’s lots of them. Unless it’s really important to you (rather than an objective question of passability) I would be leave them. If you want bigger breasts you could always try gaining some weight. Looking at your body type I imagine the weight will go into your breasts and hips. It’s ultimately up to you.

You have a similar issue like me. Our areolas are large and our breast are decent size, not very large. This difference contributes to our breast looking smaller. I’ve considered implants but everyone tells me that my areolas will stretch more with implants. Your size is fine to me.
