Hello everyone I am writing this post in hopes of helping my community of transgender people. I write because I want to tell the truth once and for all about what is happening to us transgender women and which unfortunately many of us are still missing. I write in the hope of avoiding new traumas like the one I suffered and which unfortunately others like me, like us, have suffered. I had my SRS operation in that hell of a hospital called KAMOL and I am still very traumatized and shaken by what happened. The very famous Dr. Kamol is actually a real butcher who has no respect at all for the dignity of us transgender women. I lived a real hell in that hospital, a life waiting to make my dream come true but what I found between my legs was anything but a vagina. It just looked like a penis cut in two and reattached without the testicles, my urethra was positioned completely incorrectly causing me great discomfort, the labia of that thing Kamol created between my legs were practically malformed crooked, the the functionality of that thing was non-existent and the look was absolutely disgusting. Unfortunately like me there are many, too many women who have suffered this real usurpation, and all of us then found ourselves asking for help from the real angels of the Amani Thailand team and Dr Theerapong who daily receive requests for support from transgender women like me botched by dr Kamol and other pseudo fake surgeons. Unfortunately the world is full of surgeons like Dr Kamol ready to steal a lot of money from you and with it our hope of finally living in the body we have always wanted. Girls, I tell you all this from the bottom of my heart because I have really seen with my own eyes the disasters that Kamol and other pseudo surgeons have done to me and to many other girls like us. Fortunately and thank God there is a light at the end of this horrible tunnel, a light that can simply be reached by following the truth and reality of a company made up of big-hearted people like Saphira and the Amani Thailand team and the very sweet and very professional Dr. Theerapong. After my traumatic experience with Kamol I was really destroyed and had lost all hope. But thanks to Saphira&#39;s unconditional sweetness and love and excellent professionalism, I finally came back to life. Saphira and her team with Dr Theerapong accompanied me with great love and affection during my second restorative surgery and Dr Theerapong really managed to recover what seemed unrecoverable. I will never stop thanking Saphira and the Amani Thailand team because if I am still alive today and able to smile it is solely and exclusively thanks to them. Please, my beloved transgender community, make the right choice and rely on Amani Thailand and you absolutely will not regret it. If any of you need to have more information from me about my terrible experience with Kamol and my rebirth thanks to Saphira and Amani Thailand, do not hesitate to contact me and I will be more than happy to tell you in detail and support you in taking the right path . Kamol the butcher and other horror doctors must stop causing more victims in our community, together and all united we can do it girls, for all of us and for our much sought after identity. Thank you for existing Amani Thailandüôèüíï, thank you for being a special being Saphira   and for helping all those transgender women who like me are victims of botched surgery all over the world to be reborn. Finally, thank you from the bottom of my heart to the very professional and sweet Doctor Theerapong ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hi, thank you for your kind words. I didn‚Äôt had any FFS, what is BA sorry? The original horrible SRS with the monster Kamol was in June and I had the Vaginoplasty by the Angel Dr Theerapong in October so 5 Months of gap. I stayed 2 weeks in Bangkok for the vaginoplasty with Dr Theerapong and the process was: 2 long and very satisfactory consultations with Dr Theerapong the 2 days before the surgery, constant aftercare and support received by the lovely Saphira and her fantastic team who were available all the time. 3 follow up post surgery consultation with Dr Theerapong. Hope I answered your questions üí™‚ò∫Ô∏èüíã
