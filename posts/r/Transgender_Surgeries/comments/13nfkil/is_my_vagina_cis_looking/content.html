Cis vaginas come in all shapes and sizes so there‚Äôs nothing to really compare to. Yours is always going to be unique just like another cis woman. It came out great though!

It looks beautiful! And I don‚Äôt think anyone would think it isn‚Äôt cis.
</p>
<p>
Even among cis women vaginas are all super different. Every single one of my cis friends/gfs has felt like their vagina doesn‚Äôt look normal at some point and all the ones I‚Äôve seen look completely fine. And yours is no different. And honestly most of them I‚Äôve talked to are self conscious cause their vagina doesn‚Äôt look more like yours. I really wouldn‚Äôt worry it looks amazing.
</p>
<p>
Also that scar healing is amazing. I didn‚Äôt even notice it til you pointed it out!

There&#39;s no such thing as a &#34;virgin look&#34;. It&#39;s a myth. I am afab and comparing my natal bits to fishing bait feels extremely body shamy and gross. Long labia is normal. Short labia is normal. There isn&#39;t anything wrong with either and post birth things go back to normal.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never birthed anyone, and my junk looks like how you described. And looked like that when I was a virgin. I&#39;ve always been very self conscious about my anatomy there and well...it stings differently seeing my anatomy being talked about like this by another trans person.

Unfortunately not. But if you get with some guys they won&#39;t even notice. Most guys are not even anyways or they wouldn&#39;t care. As long as you&#39;re happy that&#39;s all that matters

Ignoring the scars which you said you‚Äôll be getting laser on the main thing that would make me think ‚Äúnot cis‚Äù is the fact I can‚Äôt see your clit. I think someone who knew what to look for might be able to tell but the majority of people would not think twice.

The great wall is fantastic for showing off variety amonst cis women, but it does also contain results from trans people so I think it needs a mild disclaimer there. But it&#39;s a good thing; we&#39;re normal for being trans and it doesn&#39;t make us women any less so we should be included. Even if it&#39;s not &#34;cis-passing&#34; (however you want to define that) it&#39;s still normal and looks good, so the only other considerations are personal safety and satisfaction.

Depends on who&#39;s looking I&#39;d imagine (I wouldn&#39;t have a clue even being trans). I highly doubt most men would be able to tell, they get to look at vaginas so much less

It definitely looks
<em>
like
</em>
a vulva, I just have never seen a vulva that looked like this (yes, I&#39;ve looked at labia library).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not saying it looks bad at all, I think this is a good outcome. I just don&#39;t think it looks &#39;cis&#39; which is what OP was asking.

I get what your saying but i think in this case because no cis vulvas look the same while there is a general idea there is no exact baseline. also I thunk to most cis people this would be near indistinguishable from a cis vulva.

The problem is we&#39;re getting into the unhealthy part of passing discussion that can turn a bit too hugboxy. It&#39;s a good looking vagina and contributes to the variety of vaginas out there. But we can spend all day discussing how cis vaginas should look like, and all that does is reinforce the idea that you have to be cis-passing. Which is an impossible bar to set and only really gives trans women more dsyphoria.
</p>
<p>
Like I don&#39;t think saying &#34;most men are uneducated on how vulvas look&#34; is really helpful for trans women looking for feedback? I dunno.

I get what your saying completely, im really sorry if what I said came across that way that was not my intention, what I ment and was evidently not what was convayed (I sure do love having horrible communication skills) What I was trying to say is similar to what you actually said (at least I think) what I was trying to say and should have just said is that because there really isnt a ‚Äòstandard vagina‚Äô as long as OP is happy with it, how cis it looks (which being non quantifiable really is quite silly come to think of is) really isn‚Äôt important, she does have a good result and thats really all that matters
</p>
<p>
I just realised i started both of these comments with I get what your saying, probably best to ignore me Im just a silly sleep deprived anxious person who isnt very good at making a coherent sentence

it looks pretty above average for a trans vagina. But no trans vagina looks quite like a cis vagina, the tension causes a very different appearance to the labias. ppl will downvote and come for me, it‚Äôs just the way it is.

Not true. My endocrinologist said vaginoplasty results have fooled gynaecologists.

so not ur experience, or the experience of the person who told u that, but of unnamed doctors in an anecdotal structure. rock solid evidence! take a sample of neovaginas on this sub and compare them to vaginas on a cis female sub with vaginas and get back to me :)

Yes, my experience. Yes, the experience of the person who told me that. Yes, the experience of my cis wife and previous sexual partners.

You need to work on your internalised transphobia.

There&#39;s about 10,000 different variations of vaginas.. They&#39;re all vaginas... Your vagina looks like a vagina.. it looks very good actually who is your surgeon..?üòä‚ù§Ô∏è

I would say the lack of definition to your labia minora and the inability to see your clit is what would clock you as not cis if someone was staring intently.

If someone wasn‚Äôt looking to examine or transvestigate it, on first glance it would seem like a cis vagina, which will probably be the majority of interactions other people will have with it.
</p>
<p>
If someone was trying to really analyze your vagina to determine if it was natural, I‚Äôm sorry to say you would probably get clocked. You don‚Äôt have a visible clitoris, (unless that protrusion IS your clitoris, then you don‚Äôt have a normal looking one.) Your labia is also pretty small (which you could probably just pass off as being a virgin or having had cosmetic surgery, unless you don‚Äôt have inner labia, then you could ONLY pass it off as cosmetic surgery.) but it‚Äôs primarily missing a visible clitoral region and shape. (Which if you‚Äôre having sex with the average guy who can‚Äôt find the clitoris anyway, probably won‚Äôt be obvious to him. If you have sex with a woman though, they might notice.)

</blockquote>
<p>
Sorry, but any connection between labia size and virginity is absolute BS.
</p>
<p>
I say this as a transmasc dude who has happened to only ever have sex with people born with vulvas, &#34;virgin&#34; and &#34;not virgin&#34;. I&#39;m guessing by &#34;virginity&#34; you mean vaginal penetration from a penis/ dildo, and I
<em>
promise
</em>
that kind of sex changes nothing about the inner or outer labia. People&#39;s labias can be absolutely any size no matter how often/ if they&#39;ve had penetrative sex, trust me lol. Some people have no/ basically no inner labia to speak of naturally, and outer labia can also be really, really small naturally.
</p>
<p>
And OP, my two cents is that the only thing that I don&#39;t see is a clitoris, but you&#39;ve already mentioned that you have one so it must just be this photo. With a visible clitoris I wouldn&#39;t think twice seeing your vulva.
<em>
Maybe
</em>
I&#39;d think you had an inner labial reduction/ removal because of how smooth the area is, but tbh my first assumption would be that your vulva was just another natural variation.

Yeah, I have to agree. As a Trans man with literally NO labia minora on the lower portion and minimal on the upper portion even after having a child, virginity and sexual acitivity have nothing to do with labia. I do think OP would look slightly more cis if she had longer labia minora, but her results are excellent aesthetically, and many cis women would love to have less visible labia.

Looks beautiful! It honestly looks a bit tight, like if you had your hand on the pubic area and were pulling everything upward. Idk if that&#39;s for the pic or if that&#39;s in a resting state. Absolutely authentic looking.

ü´• i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth to say the truth or if you would take it as a direct offense ad-personam. its not my intention to hurt your feelings, and i wholeheartedly understand that this is probably the best you could achieve and that between : choosing to be potentially suicidal an dysphoric for the further 10 years while setting up things in order to find the right surgeon, the fly, the stay, and money if it isn&#39;t covered from insurance,  and settling for the best you could achieve as soon as possible with the nearest/ covered from insurance surgeon you found, but at least in exchange, relieve your dysphoria,  you&#39;ve choosen the second. but unfortunately it isn&#39;t cis looking because i don&#39;t see little labia nor clitoris. you can be happy anyway, because if you chosed to have this now, it means that you couldn&#39;t manage to be like before anymore, and this result is the best you could achieve giving your personal situation, weighting your pros and cons. happyness doesn&#39;t depends upon how much a genital is cis looking or not, functional or not, etc. these are all relatable goals, if i could&#39;ve born a cis man i would&#39;ve chosen it without regret, but i&#39;ll have to settle for too. happyness depends upon doing the best we can with what we have/can afford/achieve.
</p>
<p>
after all this maximum philosophic text maybe it&#39;s only that you&#39;re sitting in a position that doesn&#39;t allow me to view objectively the entire situation, so if it&#39;s the case feel free to correct me üòÖ anyway, for what concerns non-sexual related situations, such changing in the changingroom labeled for &#34;women&#34;, you absolutely pass and nobody on earth would say otherwise, because depending on the shape of every individual woman, there are women with such tiny little labia&amp;clit and such developed mons/big labia that it&#39;s all hidden if they stand up naked. if this was the situation in wich context you want to pass, you absolutely pass.

I think it looks cis if you‚Äôre wearing pants or standing up. Upon close inspection though no neo pussy looks truly cis to someone who is educated about cis vulvas and vaginas. There are definitely differences and I wish everyone could be ok with that but I get it‚Äôs not easy.
</p>
<p>
That said you have a great vulva and it‚Äôs amazing what these surgeons are capable of! You should be happy with it if you can, you‚Äôre very lucky!

Just try to get them to give you more labia majora around the forchette area. The vagina hole is just too seen if that makes sense. Beautiful clit hood ! Please don‚Äôt feel down either . Trust me it can be so so much worse. Much love

Not cis looking no, but it does look nice! It really doesn&#39;t look bad, but it seems like you&#39;re missing definition of lips and clit. Those can be subtle but they usually show as a bit of color variation at minimum and I don&#39;t see a clit or a bump of one at all. That said, it does look pretty and smooth and feminine at least!
