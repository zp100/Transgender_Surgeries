I just met with Dr. Rodriguez and I really like him, but its a little alarming that there is not one first hand patient review of their experience with Dr. Rodgriguez. This strikes me as odd. Does anyone out there have a first hand experience with Dr. Rodriguez or know anyone that you can put me in touch with?  Please help. Thanks!!

He is my surgeon. I havenâ€™t gotten it done yet. But the girls I know who have had remarkable results. He is more than a surgeon. He is also a Maxio-Facial specialist and is one of the only Plastics Surgeons who has done an entire skull transplant. He is an artist and is very patient. I have three separate surgeries scheduled, bone and structure, soft tissue then finally ears. It takes longer, but I have seen a lot of surgeons and nobody gets results like Dr. Rodrigues.

Thank you Beneficial, for your post.  I&#39;m a week out of having my top surgery with Oriana Cohen, who has studied under Rachel Bluebond-Langner, and Dr. Cohen and her team have been fantastic, caring and warm.  Yesterday, was my 1week Post-Op, and I couldn&#39;t be happier.  Dr. Cohen, recommended Dr. Rodriguez, who happens to be the head of Plastic Surgery at NYU Plastic Surgery, and she said that he does beautiful work, and your post brought the biggest smile to my face! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!

I haven&#39;t used it myself, but people keep telling me there are trans groups on Facebook that are great for networking.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, he might be good.. but not being able to easily find any prior patients should be a warning sign. I mean, do you want to go in blindly hoping to be his &#34;first&#34; brag worthy success?

There has been a verifiable flood of new docs getting into trans surgeries since insurance started to cover our procedures.  So he may have few to no patients under his belt.  That said Drs. O &amp;  Zukowski had to start somewhere BITD.  You may want to check RealSelf to see if he has ANY prior patients.

There are a couple of girls in one of the fb groups I&#39;m in that went to him and seem very happy with the results. I can send you a link to the group if you want! Just DM me.
