How long till your surgeon will allow you to wash?  Try some summers eve wipes.  They&#39;re pretty good at cleaning and have an ok smell. Honestly, for a good couple of months, the stink I had was rotting bits of skin and tissue that needed to slough off.

Really depends. T changed my BO to that of a cis guy. Estrogen produces a different smell. Could be that.
</p>
<p>
A unhygenic cis vagina smells like fish. A clean one subtly sweet.

You&#39;re only a few weeks post-op, chances are that&#39;s a little bit of necrotic tissue that you&#39;re smelling. Just make sure to do your iodine douches and keep flushing out the material. It&#39;s going to take a few months as everything heals up.
