I have had nothing but bad experiences with him and his staff.
</p>
<p>
I still have a stage for a capsular contracture that needs to be resolved, but won’t do it because they keep coding it as stuff for a cis woman instead of a trans woman .
</p>
<p>
I’m also not entirely happy with the job they did is removing excess skin for my body due to losing 200 pounds .
</p>
<p>
My scars aren’t even the same on each side they’re totally different which means that they took a different approach and thus that’s why my sides are not even.
</p>
<p>
I had scheduled GCS with them years ago but like two weeks before the surgery or maybe it was a week they called me and let me know that not only are they moving my surgery back but they all of a sudden can’t do my surgery because I’m intersex and I wont have enough depth
</p>
<p>
The whole experience was so shitty and disheartening that I just said fuck it I live with it all this way
</p>
<p>
I hope your experience is better but maybe not, since this was a revision

I am aware of two others who have had serious complications with this surgeon (fistulas that were mismanaged by the surgeon - met online because I also had a (much less serious, and correctly managed) fistula). I&#39;m so sorry you have had this experience.

Like for the longest time, I thought there was a lump in my left breast.  Multiple times I would go get a scan and everything check it out. They would say there’s nothing wrong just might be a weird mass.
</p>
<p>
But after 2 1/2 years of it bugging me, and then I was noticing recently some pain in my chest in the area and my boob is significantly harder compared to the other.  Capsular contracture, clearly from their shitty job.  I decided to go see him now that I have moved back to the East Coast and can just walk in after making an appointment of course.
</p>
<p>
He takes one look at it and he goes. Oh yeah, that’s the top of your implant.   I was absolutely stunned. Like why the fuck is the top of my implant sticking out visibly?
</p>
<p>
This guy absolutely sucks and should not be touching trans people.  I also know that the one person who had even started all this with him left as well.
</p>
<p>
But what is done is done and we can’t change the past, so we can only try to inform those around us to make a better decision

Personally, this is somebody I would never go to. I am aware of several life-threatening complications with this doctor that were horrifically mismanaged. As mentioned above, this includes fistulas and life-threatening infections that were misdiagnosed and callously disregarded.

Hope the healing goes well! Curious to see how it looks after the swelling has gone down.

My experience so far with Dr. Ramineni has been wonderful. His staff has been incredibly ontop of things for me and he has been always quick to respond to my emails and setting up appointments for me when needed.
</p>
<p>
This revision was mostly cosmetic and he explained to me he really does prefer to do two stage surgeries but not everyone wants the two which is their choice.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry that people have had negative experiences but I honestly would 100% recommend him. Even swollen I have exactly what I asked for and I&#39;m incredibly happy with the result so far.

I’ll second this! Dr. Ramenini has been absolutely nothing but supportive. He’s answered every question I’ve had, scheduled appointments last minute to alleviate misplaced anxiety, and always responds very prompt to email.
</p>
<p>
His staff is also excellent and friendly. I had my initial surgery with him the same day as OP and just had revisions on October 19th. Revisions were all completely cosmetic and I’m happy with how things have turned out.
</p>
<p>
You have to make choices that are best for you, but every surgeon is going to have some less than optimal outcomes. I would 100% recommend Dr. Ramenini based on my experience.

How long were you hospitalized for the revision?  Was it expensive? What did he do exactly enhance clitoral hood, make more defined labia minora, better labia majora, close the posterior commissure so the vaginal introitus (entrance) is enclosed by the labia.  Are you in much pain?

Pain is just like an annoying sore. Like 2/10 pain most of the time.
</p>
<p>
I got my labia minora more defined and clitoral hood more present. Closed up the commissure and removed an annoying flap that healed in a way that made dilation annoying. I also got my depth redone since I messed up and stopped dilating because of the annoying flap. So Monday I&#39;ll find out how much depth I have again.
</p>
<p>
I went into the hospital at 730, I left at 5 pm same day and flew home to Boston. No issues and relatively mild pain on the trip. I have a cathedar in for now and I follow up Monday for removal and packing removal.
