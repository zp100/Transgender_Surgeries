I‚Äôve been meaning to write one of these to share my experience but I haven‚Äôt gotten around to it until now.
</p>
<p>
I had breast augmentation surgery with Dr Lee on October 23, 2020. I am very happy with the results. At first I was terrified that his recommended implant would be too big for Me, but the results were exactly what I wanted down to the very last detail.
</p>
<p>
I had holidays with my family and oddly enough, my female family members were curious about the results and it shocked them and me. Everyone continues to tell me ‚Äúomg who‚Äôs your surgeon, they look so natural‚Äù (thank god).
</p>
<p>
In total I paid $7700 for the procedure. I had implants under the muscle, I think it‚Äôs called submuscular implants. 350cc. Days 1-3 were painful ish but nothing unbearable.
</p>
<p>
Warning: I did have a really bad reaction to the prescribed medication.  Severe Hallucinations and dizziness up until almost a month post-op. He prescribed me a pill cocktail (completely normal) I don‚Äôt blame anyone for my adverse reaction to the medication. I‚Äôm just saying that it can happen since it happened to me.
</p>
<p>
The nurses and staff were very nice and welcoming. I don‚Äôt if it‚Äôs just me but to me Dr Lee seemed to be a little cold. It didn‚Äôt bother me at all. All in all, the man definitely lives up to his reputation and I have every intention of going to him for FFS in the next few months
