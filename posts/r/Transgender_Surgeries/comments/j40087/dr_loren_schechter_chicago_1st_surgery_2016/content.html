Hey all I just wanted to share my results from a colon-vaginoplasty that was done by Loren schechter in Chicago. I had a one step colon-vaginoplasty at the age of 17 ( I’m 21 now) due to me being so young and starting hormones at 14 I had virtually no penile tissue to work with, and so almost all the surgeons I had spoken to said they either couldn’t help me ( aka didn’t do 1 step colon-vaginoplasty / didn’t feel confident in my body’s anatomy to do a skin graft - as I’m super skinny). It’s to my knowledge that I’m one of very few patients in the US who’s had to do this method as it’s super invasive and generally reserved for either revision of penile inversion or in rare cases like mine when a patient transitions super early and doesn’t have enough penile tissue/length to do normal inversion or inversion with skin grafts.
</p>
<p>
-Some quick facts -
<br>
- I had a revision surgery in 2018 to address the issue of a ring of scar tissue that had formed around the connection from the vagina to the vaginal canal( aka sigmoid colon- in my case ascending colon due to my sigmoid being severely damaged from my previous battle with anorexia). The surgery was successful and I was able to dilate fully and have penetrative sex
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I have experienced mucus from the colon actually building up in the vaginal canal, which had to be removed/ flushed out in minor surgery by the colon doctor( this is sadly due to the use of ascending colon as it naturally produces much more mucus than the sigmoid colon does ). The minor surgery has gone well the both times I’ve had it(once in 2017/ &amp; recently in August of 2020) I now use a catheter to douche/cleanse the vagina at home once a month to truly remove any and all mucus build up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I am able to self lubricate a good amount when turned on sexually and sometimes haven’t need lube when being penetrated by either past boyfriends, my current boyfriend , or the random guys I hooked up with in college.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I have sometimes gotten questions about being trans due to my vagina but it’s only happened 2 times, and both times the guys had taken a class on sex and gender where they actually discussed the surgery in detail. Otherwise I’ve not had any issues and it hasn’t been questioned by multiple hook ups from college.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
overall the experience was super painful , but I’m glad I did it because it was worth being able to be in the right body, and not feel so uncomfortable in my own skin anymore. It also helped boost my confidence because I felt so much more secure in myself and my body( however, this was most likely due to going to therapy more than surgery as surgery doesn’t magically change your life/current circumstances ).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you have questions for feel to personal message or dm me and I’d be happy to help answer anything you need. Also I’m aware my vagina isn’t porn star level in looks, but I’m growing to accept this seeing as most cis women don’t have porn star vaginas either.

As far as I can see, your bowel is connected to the skin directly at the entrance to the vagina. If so, then the scar ring was in this place. Right? Or was this anastomosis ring inside the vagina? How was the ring revised? Was it an incision or was the ring removed completely and a new anastomosis of the skin and bowel was made? I had primary colon vaginoplasty in Delhi with Dr. Kaushik in 2018. The proximal part of my vagina was created from the penile skin and a urethral flap, and the sigmoid colon was attached at a depth of 1.5-2.0 inches. Therefore, the bowel is not visible from the outside. In the first 9-10 months after the operation, I had no problems with the vagina. I could fit the dilator up to 2 inches wide. But then a sharp narrowing of the scar of the bowel-skin anastomosis began. A tight ring has formed. As a result, I can hardly use a ~1-inch wide dilator. And even with this, there is a slight injury to the mucous membrane. Vaginal sex is basically impossible. I would like to understand how it is possible to permanently remove a narrow scar ring (stenosis of the anastomosis) so that I can be sure that this ring does not reappear. There are a lot of trans women who underwent penile-scrotal skin vaginoplasty, but not colon vaginoplasty. It seems that for me you are the first who writes about the same problem.

I think you should ask your doctor/gyno about it if you&#39;re concerned (I sure would be!)

I also had the colon vaginoplasty. My problem is I always bleed after intercourses and painful sometimes. Maybe it’s the ring that has problem.

Hmm that’s super interesting if you would like to dm let me know because I’d be very interested to hear about your results and experiences in more depth. However, I feel you on the pain during sex part it sometimes can happen to me. I also sometime bleed but thankfully not too much

The depth is supposedly well over 6/7 inches as the colon is very long. Also it depends my current boyfriend had a larger than average penis and can’t fit it all the way in sadly, but we are working on it. I am able to both self lubricate and orgasm very well. Hope this helps.

Looks nice overall..  Was it done laparoscopically or robotically? Is there a large abdominal scar?  Do you have discharge and need to wear pads? How many inches of skin do you have at the entrance ? Do you dilate before sex?  Are eating and bowels normal?
</p>
<p>
Do you have feeling inside the vagina or only at the entrance?
</p>
<p>
You wrote that the experience as painful? Was there post op pain or not much?

Thanks so much! It was in fact done laparoscopically and yes I did have abdominal scars not big per say and most faded except one that keloid badly. However, I did have to endure a year of steroid shots and a minor scar revision surgery so if you scar badly then it’s possible to keloid. Also I do have discharge but I no need for pads just super light panty liners I technically don’t even need them I just prefer them. I have chronic stomach pain sadly it’s a risk of the surgery since if u are skinny and don’t have a lot of fatty tissue in the stomach region to block or act as a barrier to the normal level of internal scar tissue which results in surgery. Not sure how many inches of skin sorry to say but I can fit all my dilators in perfect to the base of them. I do sometimes dilate before sex to make sure my vaginal muscles are relaxed and prepared but I’ve had good sex without doing so before too. It’s mostly just preference as to whether or not you want to dilate before sex. I do have feeling in the vagina as well. Yes there’s post op pain as there is with any surgery I won’t sugar coat it, you will be in the surgical icu for about a week 6/7 days then they transfer you out for another week in Hosptial and then the first 2-3 months expect dramatic weight loss ( I went in to Hosptial at 5ft 8inches &amp; 116 pounds and left at 94 pounds - this was due to having my entire GI system shut down during surgery and being on an all clear liquid diet for many days in Hosptial) so the post op pain is actually mostly your stomach and from the weight loss in my experience rather than the vagina itself. I hope this helps
