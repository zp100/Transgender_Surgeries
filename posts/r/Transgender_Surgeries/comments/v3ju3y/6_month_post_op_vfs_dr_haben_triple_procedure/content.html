Hey all, wanted to post a quick update as I&#39;ve passed the 6 month mark since my voice surgery, and my voice quality and tone have changed quite a bit.

Have you tried singing? (I have bad voice dysphoria but I love singing, so I’m worried I’ll lose that ability if I do something like this).

Yes, and I am quite limited in that regard. It may improve a little as I get closer to the 12-month mark, which is what&#39;s considered fully healed. I&#39;ve also been working with a speech therapist who&#39;s been able to help me expand my range for singing a little bit. But because I had the CTA I will never have a full singing range again. It&#39;s definitely something that I am sad about sometimes, because I very much love singing. But for me it has absolutely been worth the trade off.

It&#39;s mostly the surgery, honestly. I did absolutely zero voice training before surgery. Post-surgery I have met with a speech therapist who specializes in trans women who have had voice feminization surgery. I&#39;ve met with her three times so far and they&#39;ve definitely been helpful but Even prior to seeing her my results were pretty similar. She&#39;s helped me with being able to not slip back down into lower ranges and also being able to access even higher ranges by getting loud and working on breath support and placement of the larynx and formation of vowel sounds and how I shape my mouth and those sorts of things.
