For those unsure on bottom surgery, how did you come to a decision?

I would really appreciate any insight because I feel really stuck, it&#39;s not too dissimilar to when I first realised I might be trans and weighing up transition.
</p>
<p>
For context, I am a trans woman, 19 months HRT, sometimes passing (not that it matters too much), and kinda feel like I&#39;ve got through gaydolescence, am confident in my womanhood and very much just living my regular life. Except for this big decision.
</p>
<p>
Do I have bottom dysphoria...yes. is it crippling? Probably not, but it ebbs and flows. I don&#39;t like looking at it, it doesn&#39;t really get used that much, I now have atrophy so sexual functionality is limited, I don&#39;t have any attachment to it at all.
</p>
<p>
Whilst I think having a vagina would be a better option, it doesn&#39;t feel like this &#34;I need this&#34; thing. If I could click my fingers and it&#39;s there, great. But surgery scares me, the recovery long, the after care seems insanely time consuming, and results vary. Also, with HRT, the safety net of being able to stop was there, while the irreversibility of this is daunting
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in the UK so surgery would be free but also would limit the surgeons I can use (haven&#39;t really looked into them yet)
</p>
<p>
Deep down eventually, I know id probably be happier, but just the amount of effort and graft and risk...urgh. Are there trans women who weren&#39;t absolute in their thinking, or suffering relentlessly from dysphoria able to make this decision? I am due for counselling soon to try work it all out but I was just curious

I flip-flopped on bottom surgery for about the first five years of my transition because I think it&#39;s hard to quantify how much something bothers you until it&#39;s gone. My pre-op genitals were the source of a ton of negative self-talk and anxiety that I think I had internalized as normal. At the beginning of the pandemic I got out of a three and a half year relationship, my best friend moved away, and I was unemployed for three or four months which finally gave me the time to work through my emotional issues and I found that bottom dysphoria was at the root of a lot of them. Cut to now, I&#39;m only two weeks post-op but I already feel so much more at ease with myself and I feel very confident pursuing surgery was the correct decision.

That first bit sounds tremendously relatable with HRT tbh...I thought I was okay as a &#39;guy&#39; but didn&#39;t realise how much underlying pain there was and how much happiness I was missing out on.
</p>
<p>
How was the recovery been? Honestly the constant dilation and being bed bound is what is concerning me. I&#39;m a lesbian and im not even sure I&#39;m bothered about having depth for what it&#39;s worth

The hospital had it&#39;s ups and downs but once I got discharged things have been surprisingly easy. I&#39;ve been largely self sufficient and since I&#39;ve been home I just have my friend come by once or twice a day to help do some of the things that I&#39;m not quite up for yet (like taking out the trash, get groceries, etc.). Dilation is a pain but as of now it&#39;s the only thing I have to do all day so I can make it work.

May probably consider minimal depth if you cannot committed to dilation and are truly not interested in penetrative sex. Dilation may not be a simple task, especially when you don&#39;t have the motivation to do it. You may also want to read other posts on potential difficulties associated with dilation, depth issues, and complications related to the internal part to get an idea of want to expect from a full depth version v. a minimal depth version.

I have decided against having bottom surgery for a few, very specific reasons.
</p>
<p>
1) What I have works and doesn&#39;t make me feel like shit.
</p>
<p>
2) I have forearm tattoos that are sentimental and I really don&#39;t want them on my dick, so phalo is out.
</p>
<p>
3) Phalo is extra super out because I don&#39;t want a scar that public to broadcast that I&#39;m trans to people that know what to look for.
</p>
<p>
4) Both kinds of erectile devices scare me
</p>
<p>
5) Meta is out because if I&#39;m going to go through the trouble, I don&#39;t want a micro penis.
</p>
<p>
As much as I would love to have a dick, it just isn&#39;t in the cards for me. Unlike the miracle that is GRS for trans women, the science and results just aren&#39;t there for what I want. A vagina is fine, too.

Don’t make any rushed decisions. Research different surgeons as much as you can. I transitioned 5 years ago and still haven’t decided, although I know to which surgeon I’d go if/when I do SRS.

there is a choice of 4 or 5  surgeons through the NHS , although  for some people  the  transphobia and fatphobia of Brighton Nuffield may  push you more towartds Bellringer / Rashid   at  Parkside

If you go with the NHS I’d say go with Bellringer as he has the most experience. Tina Rashid is reputed to be a nicer person, but has a reputation for botching surgeries quite badly. I’d join the Facebook group “patients of Charing Cross” if you haven’t already, there’s people posting quite negative experiences/outcomes of NHS SRS and it’s what made up my mind for me that if I go for SRS I’ll go to Thailand

Because while a good SRS result would improve my life a great deal, a bad one would make it much worse, and I haven’t seen anything to give me confidence that I would get a good result from Bellringer or Rashid.

you are still  young and you want to have the Bert outcome, start saving now, and go overseas in the next few years when you decided. I will never rely on nhs for this such big surgery and you really need to live with the  just ok result. This is how my own process :)

Honestly I feel silly for it being a reason but I&#39;d just like to wear underwear without it making me dysphoric. I&#39;ve invested in tucking underwear as I&#39;ve never done it the old school way. They&#39;re great but it&#39;s pretty limiting in terms of they&#39;re literally the only underwear I can wear

Research is the best thing.  It will spur your thinking and decision making - one way or the other and it does change over time. You don&#39;t seem to be in a rush or anything so you have plenty of time to look around boards here and especially the information they contain on the sides.  Enjoy.

I don&#39;t know if you watch the YouTube channel Technology Connections, but there&#39;s a line in his latest video which unintentionally echoes a lot of the trans experience:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The general aversion towards spending time, effort, and especially money on things which could materially improve your life often causes folks like me to just accept a clearly sub-optimal situation as... Fine
<sup>
TM
</sup>
.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
By all means, take as much time as you want to make your decision. But since you feel that bottom surgery will make you happier despite the risk, don&#39;t be afraid when the time comes; the freedom of it being over and done will make you wonder how you lived any other way.

I was in a similar situation so I understand. Except I am pretty scared of everything, was scared to come out, scared to start HRT, scared to do vocal training, scared to interact with people as myself, scared I was too old, etc. I was terrified of everything so SRS fear was just another thing I wanted to do despite my fears.
</p>
<p>
So, to get over my fears I just think about me on my deathbed, and how I want to look back on my life with no regrets. With that perspective what I want to do becomes clear, and knowing putting things off only increases risk of complications as I get older, so I just keep moving forward because logically I know its the best decision.

It is not because I hate my male genitalia pre-op. It is not because I really want a female genitalia, either. I even did not know what a vulva looks like before planning the surgery. I&#39;m indifferent to my genitalia. It is because I don&#39;t feel comfortable in many aspects without a female genitalia while being a girl in the society. Also, I don&#39;t want to live openly as a trans girl. I just want to live as a girl. If I were living in vacuum and no one has that kind of expectation, I would not need the surgery. I just want to be accepted as a girl and live comfortablely without worrying about being discriminated against.

I did have dysphoria about the old parts and wanted the operation for multiple reasons....
</p>
<p>
Tucking was ok but I was constantly self conscious about any bulge in my clothes.
</p>
<p>
I grew more and more dysphoric during intimate times with my female partner to the point of avoiding it. I didn&#39;t want to ruin what we had with a big floppy clit getting in the way even though she didn&#39;t really care. I couldn&#39;t stand having it out and kept it hidden under tight underwear.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t like being naked.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to feel comfortable going swimming and exercising.
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t going to do it out of fear, no that&#39;s wrong I was terrified to my core about getting it done but eventually it mostly happened on autopilot. I think I disassociated during the months weeks days and hours leading up to it to deal with the stress and it got me to the point of going through with it. Remember that when you get the pysc opinions for surgery it seems a lifetime away then all of a sudden you are in the hospital signing the final consent form.
</p>
<p>
If you are not 100 % sure get more counseling and talk it through with them. I did it the wrong way round and it&#39;s way more difficult putting the pieces back together after the fact rather then reinforcing them before the damage is done.

Heya! Old post I know, came across this and it&#39;s resonating a lot with me. I was wondering, your comment doesn&#39;t say whether you were glad in the end that you made the change or not. Could you elaborate on that when you find the time? (feel free to DM). And like, how did it affect your sex life etc.?
</p>
<p>
Much like past you, I hate being naked and often wear underwear during sex even though my partner does not care. I can&#39;t see this changing and a life of sex where I am not comfortable with how I look just seems... sad? But I am simultaneously afraid of the operation ruining sex in other ways.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, would love to hear about where you&#39;re at now, if you don&#39;t mind! :)

I&#39;m in a similar space regarding not having alot of bottom dysphoria and considering bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s important to realize that results vary alot between different surgeons and techniques. My approach is to research what kinds of surgery results are possible and available to me and think about whether I would be happier with those than with my genitals as they are now. So far I&#39;ve figured out that there are some results that would make me happier than leaving my genitals as they are. What Dr. Suporn in Thailand does looks good to me, but my insurance wouldn&#39;t cover him and I can&#39;t afford to pay out of pocket. So now I&#39;m trying to figure out, if there are any surgeons that do something that I would like similarly well in Germany. I&#39;m looking at Dr. Schaff at the Moment.

I&#39;m better with it than without. I have a strong preference for non-op transwomen, and I not a fan of the other two orifices.

Regret rate is very low, depends on the surgeon but with good surgeons it&#39;s typically no higher than 2% and often lower. Botched surgeries are also rare if you get a surgeon with a good track record. You do need to be sure before going into this though, it requires a lot of discipline and strength.

19 months HRT   doesn;t actually  tell  us a great  deal with current UK  scenario is that 19 months of properly supervised   HRT with effective T suppression of  19 months of DIY? GGP with  poor T suppression ...
<br>
if it;s not effective T suppression may  well confirm or deny  your current position

I haven&#39;t yet, im not on hrt too. But what i want to say is this maybe experiment, yk like think about scenarios, you have time, it&#39;s a big surgery and no one has to go really quick at it, when I realises that i havw time and it&#39;s okay, I would defo prefer a vagina over a penis but take your time.

I researched as much as I could and tried to imagine which one would make me happier in the long run. Sure, surgery and recovery will suck, but only for a few months. And when I think about things like the clothes i like to wear, how I like to have sex, and what I want my body to look like, I think a vagina would work better for me. And the costs of that are worth it in my eyes.

Not sure if I got dysphoria but I&#39;m certain I&#39;ll go with bottom surgery- I keep it simple, I decided and so be it.
</p>
<p>
But I guess you&#39;re still so young,  you may need a while to be sure 😊
