I&#39;m keeping a diary of my time at GRS Montreal and sharing it here for you lovely folks to read. I&#39;ll answer any comments or questions I get. Otherwise, just enjoy the show.

So yesterday got a little crazy, huh? I&#39;m not gonna waste anyone&#39;s time apologizing or promising it won&#39;t happen again (except for the &#34;little slut&#34; part, that needs an apology). Bad days happen, no point protending they don&#39;t, or that they won&#39;t happen to you. I do want to thank everyone who offered kind words and let me scream my feelings into this tiny pocket of the internet.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the journey sucks ass and it really IS all about the destination, especially when the destination is some bomb-ass new genitals.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, moving swiftly onto today... nothing happened. Pain is low (while lying down); I&#39;ve not taken anything stronger than Tylenol for a few days now. I&#39;m back to my usual 2 poops a day with stool softeners (look we&#39;re way past TMI warnings by now). It was raining all day so I just stayed in bed all day except for my perscribed walks.
</p>
<p>
So I figured I&#39;d pad today&#39;s post with some other random stuff. I counted 15 beds: 11 single rooms and 2 with a roommate. I have a roomie, not sure if I&#39;d prefer a single room or not. I think I&#39;ve seen 9 other ladies and one gent, though I&#39;m sure I just haven&#39;t seen everybody. Also, one guy told me a few months back &#34;It&#39;s like trans summer camp, you&#39;ll all be buddies by the end.&#34; He was a liar. I&#39;ve heard things used to be more lively pre-COVID, and maybe it&#39;s just my batch, but I think all of us just stick in our rooms mostly.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also been having phantom sensations a lot. Like my entire crotch is very sensitive so there&#39;s like a void where my penis and scrotum used to be, and my body is still trying to process that by making me feel... something. Or sometimes I&#39;ll get a distinct feeling in a distinct location, and I wonder is it a phantom feeling, or a real feeling in a new body part that my brain is still locating in the old place? Weird stuff.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s all I got for today. Tomorrow is the grand underessing! Honestly, I think I&#39;m more excited for the sutures to be gone and to shower than to actaully see what things look like down there xD Catch you then!
</p>

Today is the last of the really bad days.  Packing and shower tomorrow, stent and hopefully catheter the day after.  Then youâ€™ll be focused on dilation and aftercare which gets easier each day with practice.
</p>
<p>
You got this!

The phantom sensation must be so weird. Wish you well for your recovery.

I&#39;m sure a day that had nothing going on didn&#39;t feel like it was worth posting, but I for one enjoyed hearing that you had a somewhat quiet day. Not having booked anything myself yet, but knowing someday I likely will, reading about the suffering and mental struggles associated, makes me pause and question if I&#39;m ready.  Knowing that there could be some relief within the first week makes the hill seem a little more climbable.

Thank you for letting us all hear about your journey. It is really giving me a wonderful insight on what to expect when my day of surgery gets here. Keep being strong! You are awesome!
