Week 12 after gender confirmation surgery and it’s uncomfortable. I’ve made it to the size 6 inch dilator soft from soul source but it’s uncomfortable and painful at the entrance and then once about half way in. I have small pink discharge. What do you do to make it easier. I figured by week 10 this would be a breeze especially since I’ve been doing it everyday now for like 8 weeks!

i think months 3-4 were the hardest. i&#39;m at 8 months now, and it doesn&#39;t hurt at all, nor is it uncomfortable at all.  it&#39;s just a chore that i have to do

I didn’t expect 8 months. Dummy me for thinking by week 10 it’d be easier. I realize it’s a large surgery but every surgery I’ve had by like week 6 it’s nothing. GCS isn’t for the faint of heart. Thanks for the support babes

In my initial consultation packet my surgeon recommended buying a specific type of vibrator (le reve slimline g pink -
<em>
not
</em>
the regular slimline) as an option for dilating with and i&#39;m so glad I did bc it&#39;s been a godsend. It&#39;s shaped almost exactly like the soul source dilators so I can use it in place of them on occasion, but what&#39;s been
<em>
really
</em>
helpful for me is using it as a warmup. I stick the vibrator in for about a minute or so and it relaxes the muscles enough that I can take it out and easily slide in the green dilator, which was previously too painful to insert.
</p>
<p>
I think the specific model has been discontinued so it&#39;s not on amazon anymore but some sex shop sites still have leftover stock for the time being. If you aren&#39;t able to get that exact one, any type of vibrator that goes inside might be helpful for warming up

I&#39;m at about 13 or so months and it&#39;s starting to get a lot easier now. I had a complication that I got fixed around nine months that I had to pause dilating for though so I lost some progress then that I had to make up later, so it may get easier much sooner for you if you aren&#39;t having to deal with something like that.
</p>

Edit to add: I wrote up dilation advice around two months post-op that you might find helpful:
