This is a bit of info that I gathered about Brazilian and Argentinian surgeons. I&#39;m shopping around so I thought I should share.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Brazil
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
Cláudio Eduardo de Souza
</strong>
. Plastic surgeon. City: Blumenau. Trained under Dr. Leis in Philadelphia. I have no first-hand accounts but from a TV show I watched recently, he&#39;s done very few vaginoplasties so far (~30). His clinic has an FFS surgeon as well. Vaginoplasty + hospital fees costs around BRL 35k.

<strong>
Márcio Littleton
</strong>
. Plastic surgeon. City: Rio de Janeiro and Lisbon/Portugal. Trained under Dr. João Décio Ferreira in Lisbon. He&#39;s renowned in trans surgeries in Brazil and frequently does reconstruction for botched/unsatisfactory procedures. His vaginoplasty technique uses a jejunum mucosa graft as vaginal lining, which reportedly doesn&#39;t smell like colon nor constantly lubricates like peritoneum (his patients confirm this in his facebook group). Another advantage mentioned is a shorter/easier dilation schedule. Does phallo/meto as well. Vaginoplasty + hospital fees costs around BRL 42k.

<strong>
Matheus Manica
</strong>
. Plastic Surgeon. City: São Paulo. Trained under Dr. Bowers. Few stories/references available but usually praised for his commitment and bedside manners. Vaginoplasty + hospital fees costs around BRL 38k.

<strong>
Tiago Rosito
</strong>
. Urologist. City: Porto Alegre. Trained under Dr. Walter Koff, one of the pioneers of SRS in Brazil. He&#39;s one of the surgeons that do vaginoplasty through the public health system, and has large mileage, claiming to have conducted over 200 surgeries in the past ten years. However his poor technique (no labia minora or clitoral hood) and awful bedside manners are often criticized, and there are a few horror stories confirmed. Unknown if he uses the same technique and manners for paying customers. Not recommended.

<strong>
Cesar Fidalgo
</strong>
. Urologist. City: La Plata. Pioneer of SRS in Argentina. Very large experience, praised a lot for his results and bedside manners. His old-school style of communication might be offputting for some. Vaginoplasty + hospital fees costs around USD 8k. No website.

<strong>
Javier Belinky
</strong>
. Urologist. City: Buenos Aires. Very sweet person but no info floating around about his results. Vaginoplasty + hospital fees costs around USD 10k.

How are surgeons in other countries viewed by transwomen in Brazil and Argentina? In particular what do they think of Thailand and the various surgeons there?

From what I gather from Brazilian trans girls I met, the only international surgeons mentioned are Kamol, Chett and Fidalgo. The talk is frequently more about the cost than results, with Chett being considered top of the line. Kamol is known as #1 destination for girls leaving sex work life, which might explain his word of mouth popularity. Of the five women I met that had botched surgeries and had to redo the procedure later, two went to Kamol. Yet I also heard many post-op women being enthusiastic about their results and him. This is what I know from women who I met in the public health system, so they&#39;re usually poor/hard working women with little formal education. I&#39;m unsure if other international surgeons are known/considered in higher wealth/education strata.

Hey, I greatly appreciate you gathering all this info! Do you have any more information on Dr. Manica? Mostly experiences from other women who had their surgeries with him, and if possible photos of results.
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much &lt;3

Glad it was helpful! I&#39;ve been trying to get more info about him, but didn&#39;t find anything so far. I have an acquaintance that had surgery with him ~4 months ago, still couldn&#39;t get details from her but she was super happy when we last met. When we catch up I&#39;ll try to post any new info, I&#39;ll let you know ^ ^

Can you tell me which Facebook group has reports about Dr Litletton? Do you have a link? I think his surgery was the best done, but there are few photos of the results.
