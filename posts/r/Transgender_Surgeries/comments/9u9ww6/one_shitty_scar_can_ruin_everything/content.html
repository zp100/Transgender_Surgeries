I put this image together today that documents one single scar from my GAS revision last November 2017. It seems fitting since
<strong>
it&#39;s now been a year
</strong>
since that surgery and the scar remains a problem.
</p>
<p>
Instead of making an entirely new home for this image I just added it at the top of my revision story.
</p>
<p>
The lesson here is pretty straightforward. No matter the surgeon or the procedure --ASSUME NOTHING. Know exactly where every incision stitch, flap, hole, mesh, pocket, fold, snip, and latch is going to be
<strong>
before
</strong>
you put a single precious toe inside that OR.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
I Most Definitely Hate This Scar

There are lots of new surgeons popping up these days to fulfill the increased demand for GRS surgery. Unfortunately they don’t have the accumulated experience yet to deliver consistently good results.

You have hit the nail on the head. Don&#39;t expect THEM to tell you this, however. They will sell their new GRS skills like they&#39;ve been working at a Japanese steakhouse for 20 years and can split a pea from 30m.

The other problem is that good or bad, without a decent public track record you&#39;ve no way of knowing.

This is something that I have been noticing. Unfortunately, there doesn&#39;t seem to be much of a desire for good practice to be shared between surgeons- or if it has then it is very limited.

Holy crap, that&#39;s scary :( I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re going through this bullshit. Like, yikes. Should I even do this?
</p>
<p>
If you had seen something like this when you were considering surgery, would you still go through with it? Like I&#39;m obviously going to avoid this surgeon, but like, how would you factor that into your decision making?

Oh, I&#39;ve seen a lot worse than this. I&#39;m sorry I had to go through it too. It&#39;s screwed up my life. There are lessons to be learned here about mitigating risk no matter who does your surgery or the type of procedure. This is why I&#39;ve taken the time to put this information together to help other people can mitigate risk no matter who the surgeon is. I&#39;ve gone into detail about how I let myself get sucker-punched before.
</p>
<p>
PROtip: If you call a surgeons office and ask questions or submit insurance information and during that call you detect a condescending attitude or they say they will call you back and they don&#39;t.  Forget them. If they can&#39;t manage the easy stuff on the front end, there&#39;s little hope you&#39;re getting it when you really need it on the back-end.

I am sorry to hear about this, did it happen after a revision? Have you considered consulting with someform of dermatologic surgeon?

I have been trying to get a recommendation for over three months now. I figure a urologist might be a good idea. It&#39;s not Like I need some complicated procedure. I just need the alien creature removed from under the scar.  I live in a big city, there are tons of surgeons of all types.  I keep writing my PCP and asking for a recommendation and so far I&#39;ve got nothing after 12 weeks of trying. Gallagher went so far as to falsely claim she made a recommendation to Dr. Unger in Cleveland or Dr. Schecter in Chicago. She didn&#39;t and there&#39;s no documentation of these recommendations. (My PCP even Checked). Why on earth would I need to go all the way to Chicago or Cleveland to have a scar fixed?

I chose her because she was local and available. I had a window of opportunity. I let my guard down on the experience issue. I was about 8th to 10th maybe. About 90 less than I would have preferred but I made no demands in terms of minimal number of bottom surgeries. The vast majority of gender related surgeries have been FTM top. She&#39;s been quoted in articles claiming she&#39;s done over 200 &#34;gender-affirmation&#34; surgeries, but doesn&#39;t distinguish between FTM top and MTF bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t speak for other people, I can only speak to my own experience. The fact that my 8 week surgery experience turned into more than 12 months of torture and depression and still remains unresolved should be big red flag. She&#39;s refused to answer a single email addressing a myriad of issues. Her Coordinator told me they would be happy to see me if I made an appointment. Of course once when now broke from extended recovery and January rolls around and all my deductibles kicked back in appointments aren&#39;t cheap. Trust me I&#39;m glossing over a lot of details here.
</p>
<p>
Hey, anyone you want&#39;s to see some results, I pull no punches. I&#39;ll tell you one more thing. I would be highly skeptical of any MTF online reviews on Surgeon sites. When I put the first half o my surgery experience online, I&#39;ll put it on Realself.com too.

As for the money, This was done in a US hospital, so it&#39;s all billed in Monopoly-money health-scrip that has no relationship to real $ value. Trying to decipher the actual cost would take an army of accountants weeks and even then it wouldn&#39;t be accurate. But unlike other surgeries I&#39;ve had out of the US, here they charge for everything, every time and in every way possible, no matter who&#39;s fault it is. I&#39;ll have to pay all for the surgery to get this scar fixed too. It&#39;s quite the racket.

I wouldn&#39;t describe her as irresponsible or careless or even a bad overall surgeon. I have nothing but respect for people who can accomplish the goal of becoming a board certified plastic surgeon.  I might sound charitable here considering the situation but there&#39;s a number of layers to this and the issues that made me walk away from her practice had more to do with her unwillingness to communicate details and fabricating reasons for dismissing me months later.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think I would have let her operate a third time after making it crystal clear the revision was the last surgery I wanted to have. I&#39;ve had a lot of previous surgery elsewhere.

As I wrote in the link. I had no idea those incisions would be there much less the scars. She never explained any of the W-plasty procedure. She didn&#39;t even tell me she did a W-plasty until after the revision surgery. The entire time leading up to the surgery including all the layers of intake nurses I met the morning of surgery referred to the lot as a labiaplasty. The one thing I didn&#39;t even have. And yet no one will even discuss that problem at the hospital.  This is how they actually handle problems like this at Indiana University Hospital Downtown, they just put you on ignore until you get tired and go away.

I agree completely. I was not happy about the W-plasty scars or her solution for fixing my Vulva that involved folding it all into my Vulva canal. I was livid. I don&#39;t see any way of undoing that, I&#39;m stuck with a gaping hole.
</p>
<p>
The worst part was when I asked her why she did that to my Vulva? She said,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
That&#39;s what I do for other girls.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I was at a loss for words at that point.
