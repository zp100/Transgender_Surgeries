I thought i was crazy seeing a spider in there and SCREAMED!!!!  Thanks for posting this comment and telling me &#34;I wasn&#39;t&#34;. Read other comments and learned new things.
</p>
<p>
Good luck on your SRS OP. I am hving my SRS consultation on July and I still researching tons of information.

What was done was cutting the ring in the canal and replacing it with buccal tissue.  plus some other fixes.  Recovery with catheter and tampon a week and 2 days.
</p>
<p>
I would add that psychological support in such operations is actually necessary.  What I&#39;ve learned is that pain is a huge factor that practically cuts off your ability to use your brain.
</p>
<p>
Stay safe!!!

True.  Still, I like that people post examples of buccal graft vaginoplasty.  PIV and PPT got too &#34;standardized&#34; and nobody bothers to look at what&#39;s been done for cis women for ages, and the pros and cons of that.  Buccal grafts are arguably relevant for repair or addition.  I always wondered about the aftermath.  You only see very glazed over surgeon outcome descriptions and pictures in articles.  I never saw self-reported patient feedback before, about healing.

I have read back through their posts and it seems like a ring of scar tissue forned around the vaginal opening. I think it was excised and replaced with tissue from the inside of their cheek ?

Honestly, it immediately made sense to me with no research, but I have a medical background (not formally, just autism special interest)

What was this for? What is &#34;the ring?&#34; I&#39;m very confused. Would this be something that should concern everyone?

Scar tissue ring around the vaginal canal as a complication of GCS. The mouth picture is where the surgeon took a graft. My friend had 3 surgeries to fix hers before she gave up.

People with a tendency to large scars have this complication. Forms a ring of scar on entrance which makes dilitating pretty much impossible plus it&#39;s quite painful as well.  I had a few places that needed to be improved. The tissue from the cheek is the tissue has less complications when it comes to scarring.

It&#39;s a very small amount of graft for vagina lining.

Glad to hear this. I with surgeons would solve this ring problem or give some guidance. This happens far too much.
