BACKGROUND
</p>
<p>
I deleted my old posts because of harassment but I made a fresh account, I apologise for any confusion, I am the same person.
</p>
<p>
HYPERGRANULATION
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve contacted GRS MONTREAL about the hypergranulation and they have given me no course of action or anything to try. Didn&#39;t even address is even though it&#39;s one of my main concerns right now. My forchette simply refuses to heal.
</p>
<p>
HARD LUMP
</p>
<p>
Additionally, (see pic 4 and 5) I have a hard lump that refuses to settle. It might be sitting on a nerve because every time I move my legs it feels really really uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
SWELLING
</p>
<p>
My swelling seems to be abnormally high compared to others at this stage as well. Just seems like I&#39;m not healing. Even compared to 2 weeks ago, not much has changed.
</p>
<p>
PAIN
</p>
<p>
Fortunately my pain slowly went away week 4-5 and now I&#39;m finally able to go on short walks and care for myself.
</p>
<p>
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
</p>
<p>
Does anybody have suggestions RE: hypergranulation? It makes dilating really awful. Also I have no idea what to do about the hard lump and they just said to massage it.

Hey! I&#39;m around the same time post op, and very similar results! Healing takes time! Just keep taking it easy and air dry. Keep on with the routine. Check in with your GP.

Looks really nice IMO!
</p>
<p>
For the granulation, silver nitrate I believe.

How is dilation going?

From the beginning, I had trouble dialating. At GrS Montréal they start you on the big orange dilator, which is the biggest there is. They seemed upset with me for using the blue one, which already hurts and is too big for me.
</p>
<p>
My pain was so wholly unmanaged that after getting home (and 30mg if dilaudid daily) I was in so much pain (7/10 - 10/10) that I did not have the energy to dilate. I was doing at least 2 dilations per day and 3 only if I could manage. I couldn&#39;t walk or take care of myself for 4 weeks. If my pain was better managed, then perhaps I would have been better off, but they refused to help me in any meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
Right now I am doing 2-3 per day on average. Very painful. Always takes forever to get it in fully. I&#39;m taking 15 minutes just to insert it all the way whereas others get it in within 10 seconds.

You are through the worst of it I hope.  I am going to be at GRS Montreal next year for mine ... and I must admit I am kind of terrified.

How much are you icing?  At six weeks, I was still doing about ten minutes per hour, almost every hour.

Unfortunately my life is far too busy to ice regularly. I haven&#39;t since week 4. I can&#39;t barely keep up with dilations. It really is hell for someone with severe executive dysfunction.

This is a really good result. It’ll be a few months before things settle.
