I am actually booked for a consultation with two clinic morath and markovsky in early next year then need to make a decision on which clinic so really good timing :-D
</p>
<p>
Questions that I have 1) when you go for consultation, do they show pictures of past results? as I am struggling to find any on the wiki or on reddit.  2) what was your reasoning for picking Scholl over Morath?  3) why did you select this particular this clinic over other clinics offering combined method? (aka Team Markovsky)  4) why did you pick the combined method over others?  5) morath and Scholl uses a lot more of the urethra track, did you get any self lubrication?  6) how long was your recovery?

did a fantastic series of post about her surgery with morath, so it&#39;s would be interesting to know if your experience matches her&#39;s

Yeah, they showed me some results and i was flashed after that. I knew, these are the doctors i want to make me my vagina.
</p>

<p>
The reason was time. I was asked if i want the operation with schöll so i could have a earlier date to have the procedure. I said „I don’t care who is making my vagina“ That was the only reason. I trust them :)
</p>

I just only had a consultation with morath and schöll and my feeling in the stomach told me, that they are the team for me and i was happy with the shown results, so i don‘t had any other consultation with other surgeons.

Bc they took all of the skin, so it would look „naturally“ and i had the hope to not need lube.

Recovery… Hm… So i went to work 3 months afther and was out of the hospital at day 16. I think i was fast with my recovery. I work in a kindergarten, so it isn‘t just sitting and working on computer. If i would work in the office, i think i could return earlier in my normal life back.
