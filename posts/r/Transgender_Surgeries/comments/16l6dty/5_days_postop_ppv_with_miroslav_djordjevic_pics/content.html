I got discharged from Belgrade Genital Surgery centre today. I had peritoneal pull-through vaginoplasty on Tuesday the 12th September and an emergency revision on 13th September.
</p>

</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Two friends of my wife have been here for their surgeries and are very happy with the outcomes; this, along with the price of €17,000 (for everything done at the hospital), and Dr Djordjevic&#39;s background were my motivations to come here specifically.
</p>
<p>
I arrived in Belgrade on Saturday the 9th September and a taxi driver sent by the clinic collected me from the airport and brought me to the apartment. He let me in, showed me all of the information booklets, how to use the phone, how to use the wifi... His prices seem quite expensive, however he also drove me to the hospital which I did not pay for, and given that he gave me all of the bonus information I was quite happy with the taxi fee from the airport to the apartment after getting over the initial annoyance that I thought it was all paid in advance as part of my medical bills. He charged €35-40 from the airport to Old Belgrade, but we did the same journey on Car:go (Uber in Serbia) for like.. less than half that. He is available for other trips but I personally haven&#39;t used him for anything else outside of these trips due to his pricing, but again happy paying it from the airport to the apartment due to all the extra-curricular stuff.
</p>
<p>
The apartment had UK to EU adapters so I could use all my electronics as well. The apartment is fantastic, it&#39;s very spacious for me and my partner and there are a lot of stores nearby though we are having some difficulty finding fresh meat to buy (as the supermarket sells.. meat that does not seem fresh). There are lots of local independent stores including a 24 hour bakery a 2 minute walk away which is amazing. There is no oven, only a two-stove electric hob and a microwave.
</p>
<p>
I had a lot of communication with Miro via email, as well as his anaesthesiologist Gradimir Korac and another member of the medical team Marta Bizic. The communication was decent, though sometimes I felt a bit left-in-the-dark; though retrospectively these were things like.. waiting a few days to receive payment confirmation, when they are a very busy medical team. There were no pre-surgical consultations via Skype or anything, and Dr Miro only looked at me anatomically when I prompted him to ensure my pubic hair was okay (as I have had no hair removal performed down below). It was a little disconcerting to have to ask &#34;is my pubic hair okay for PPV?&#34; for him to say &#34;As long as it&#39;s not like this...&#34; without him checking that - what if my hair had been unsuitable and I hadn&#39;t known to ask?
</p>
<p>
I had a day in Belgrade and Dr Marko from the surgical team registered mine and my wife&#39;s passport with the local police station (legal requirement in Serbia for tourists). We did a small amount of exploring the immediate local area and bought some essentials. Serbia has some beautiful architecture and seems really cultured - there was a market at the local mall which seemed to be small independent makers and the likes.
</p>
<p>
I was advised on the night before surgery that I would be collected at 8:30-9am the following morning to be admitted to ST Medica Hospital to begin bowel prep and undergo pre-surgical assessments.
</p>
<p>
--------- SKIP TO HERE FOR ADMISSION  ---------
</p>
<p>
I was driven to the hospital by the same driver and admitted. It was very smooth, and I underwent some blood tests and then a thorough physiological examination by a doctor. I was brought laxatives and tea and told to drink and to.. well, let the laxatives do their work. They work. Thoroughly. Jesus.
</p>
<p>
I met the anaesthetist and he discussed the anaesthetic plan for the following day, as well as the risk of transfusion. He said I&#39;d need a transfusion if I lost a lot of blood, but hopefully not. Then I met Dr Miro and he walked me through the full surgical procedure. It was a fairly quick run-through of &#34;we&#39;ll first remove your entire penis, then your testicles, then we&#39;ll cut some ports in your abdomen..&#34;. Not quite that fast but there was no preamble, which I somewhat appreciated. He said surgery would last around 4 hours. He also told me that I needed a final psychiatrist sign-off as my previous therapist approval letters were kinda old and technically only for an orchi. This took me off-guard as I had been told my 2 orchi letters (from 2021 and 2022) were sufficient. I saw a psychiatrist in the evening and she had read my letters; we discussed why I had changed my mind and how I felt about everything and that I understood what I was undertaking. I received antibiotics via IV drip. I went to bed in the late evening.
</p>
<p>
--------- SKIP TO HERE FOR SURGERY ---------
</p>
<p>
I woke up early on Tuesday and was told surgery would be at 11am. I went to the toilet again and waited, and eventually I was told it was time. I walked to the surgical theatre and was gestured to take off my gown and climb onto the operating table. I did so, had another IV placed, and Dr Korac made some last preparations before saying &#34;bye bye Winter, see you later!&#34;. The next thing I remember is him calling my name, and it sounded very faint and distant, and I felt deeply asleep, and then I was back in the recovery room in bed with a nasal canula, and surprisingly little pain. I think I lay there for an hour with my eyes shut, just letting myself come around. I was very woozy. Surgery had taken closer to 7 hours.
</p>
<p>
I was checked on a few times, by Dr Miro, Dr Korac and Dr Marko as well as all of the nurses. Some bleeding was noticed and another Dr came in and redressed the wound, applying a lot of pressure. They were very calm and kind, and I felt safe in their care. This was all happening during the night. By the morning the bleeding had gotten worse, and around 11am I was told I would need another surgical procedure that should only take maybe 15 minutes, but they wanted to do it under anaesthetic because my urethra was bleeding and it would be uncomfortable to do it under a local or regional anaesthetic. I went into surgery an hour later, after laying in a pool of my own blood for a while, and eventually went back into the operating theatre. Again greeted by Dr Korac, but this time wheeled in on my bed and asked if I was able to climb across to the operating table; I felt like gollum doing that. This time I was awake for far less time, and the lights went out quickly. I woke up a while later with less grogginess than the day before and there was no more bleeding. 3 hours after I had gone in for my 15 minute operation
</p>
<p>
Dr Miro came to see me a few hours later, and told me that I had a problem with my urethra bleeding and that every time he fixed one part, another started bleeding. Apparently I have a very healthy heart! And apparently I made a bit of a mess squirting blood everywhere. But he fixed me up, having performed a revisional urethroplasty and I received two units of blood as well.
</p>
<p>
Then just.. recovery. It is ongoing, obviously, but today I was discharged to the apartment and Dr Marko drove me from the hospital to the apartment with my things. I have a tiny amount of bleeding from my vagina I think, but Dr Marko is visiting again tomorrow to redo my wound dressings. My next big hurdle is pooping... pray for me.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The nurses were absolutely amazing. They spoke varying amounts of English, from near-fluent to.. &#34;Water?&#34; &#34;Walk?&#34; &#34;Food?&#34; but they all took amazing care of me and I felt very endeared to them.

All of the doctors were amazingly reassuring, felt exceedingly competent at their roles and kept in close communication. I felt so very well supported here in Belgrade.

Thank you so much for posting this, I want to go with Dr Djordjević and seeing this post is reassuring. Though he&#39;s been very slow in responding to my emails. Do you know approximately how long it took from first contacting the clinic to getting a specific surgery date?

Have had all of the doctors on WhatsApp whilst here. They&#39;re very good at responding, usually within an hour or so. I get the impression they&#39;re all very busy. Especially Miro. But they also all seem to care, and have their own ways of caring which is amazing.

Sure. Keep in mind everyone heals differently though and you can Google laproscopic scars; they&#39;re pretty standard.

Why did you choose peritoneal over penile inversion and colon vaginoplasty?

Wish you a quick recovery.

I had a pretty small dick, having barely gone through any puberty (think I have something akin to mild androgen insensitivity syndrome - my grandfather started puberty only in his 20s and my dad needed it induced at 16 by injections because there were no signs of starting - though androgen insensitivity is passed down maternally so not sure exactly what it is). Additionally, I was not keen on the results I had heard of for PIV.
</p>
<p>
Colon vaginoplasty being additionally invasive was scarier than PPV to me. The idea of also healing a section of my colon back together in amongst everything quickly put me off the idea and I didn&#39;t investigate much further down that route. It&#39;s also more expensive iirc?

I know this post is old, but I hope you will reply to me. I have to have a revision with a sigmoid colon, since I had a first operation which however had the complication of vaginal stenosis, I only have 10 cm of depth and the vagina is so narrow as to prevent sexual intercourse. I&#39;m scared reading your review.... I hope I can make it and not die

All surgeries come with risks. My level of bleeding was exceptional and significant.. and I lived. With no real long-term consequences either, I just need to get my iron back up.

I get about 12-14cm depth depending on the dilator I use. I am currently getting granulation tissue treated and it is helping me HUGELY with getting in larger dilators. A month ago I was struggling to fit the blue dilator in me, and now I&#39;m making progress on the green all thanks to granulation treatment. You might not be struggling with granulation but the feeling of having treatment and then dilation going so much better is incredible. It&#39;ll be worth it! You&#39;ll have an amazing time, I&#39;m sure.
