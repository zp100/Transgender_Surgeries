A great many of us have heard the horror stories about getting bottom surgery (MtF) with Dr. Rumer. Sadly, I can confirm they are true from personal experience. I will try to give what information I can in the hopes of helping anyone considering Dr. Rumor

Neo-vagina:
</p>
<p>
Healing took a while, It was about 6 moths before I felt comfortable to move around without much limitation. She&#39;s functional, I have sensation and I can even get a little wet if given enough foreplay. Depth is a little lack luster but most days when I have to dilate I&#39;m able to push myself to the final dot. Aesthetically there is a lot left to be desired, there was some labia die off, and because of the way she did the surgery there is some pretty bad prolapse. Because of the way everything is exposed I can get rashes, blisters, eventually bleeding along the labias and vaginal opening just from wearing underwear.
</p>
<p>
Pre-op experience:
</p>
<p>
She can come off as enthusiastic and genuine showing you her best work from the
<strong>
hundreds
</strong>
of people she has worked on. She leaves most of the details to her staff who can be a little less than forth coming, kind of like they expect you to know what to do both before and after you get surgery.  The only pre-op consultation for my expected results and what she would do came about an hour before my surgery after I had changed into the surgical gown and on the bed in the Operating Room lobby.
</p>
<p>
Post-op experience:
</p>
<p>
I only saw someone from her staff when they escorted me to and from my room. taking pics both days. They gave me instructions to see her in a week to get the extra plumbing removed. She was not genital about removing the drains the left side has a bigger scar because of it. She was also pretty rough with the dilator. Honestly, the whole time I felt like I was keeping her from other meetings that she had. She was in and out in less that 20 mins, gave me some general BS about how she did all she could and the final results were up to me and how i took care of it. At the 8 week consult I mentioned how things looked prolapsed and the necrosis felt a little excessive. She batted away my concerns, told me to do kegels for the prolapse, and that some die off was expected. At the 16 week mark I mentioned that I might need a revision. She told be she does not do revisions and shut-down the conversation.When I contacted her office about getting my paper work they told me it would take a month+ to gather and have it shipped to me. the paperwork never came. I went to see a specialist and she, while inexperienced with post-op MTFs, was aghast at the care that was given to me. It took a few weeks, but she now has my records from the procedure, but nothing else. No initial contact or follow up notes were given even though I signed for every document they have.  I&#39;m currently on the waiting list for a revision the surgeon i originally wanted to fix what Dr. Rumer did to me.
</p>
<p>
Emotions:
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I was super dysphoric leading up to the surgery. While I was and still am happy that I had the surgery, I just wish it was with someone more competent or willing to address the issues that arose. Overall I am dysphoric about the results. Yes I can have fun with her, and yes it is better than the alternative for me, but most days I still disassociate from that part of me. I cannot in good conscious recommend anyone to Dr. Rumer. She has been called a butcher by many on the community, and has been sued many times for results and scars she leaves people with.
</p>
<p>
My hope is to spare others from the same treatment I received. Not many have shared their experience with her so I want is shown somewhere. Yes, I am aware that there are a few exception that have had good results with her, and I am happy for them. However if this is even a 50/50 chance are you willing to risk going to her?
</p>
<p>
EDIT: a few people have asked about research so here.
</p>
<p>
Prior looking to have surgery I had the general gist of what it entailed, I had talked with a few people about their experience in passing and it all seemed pretty standard, like no real deviation besides who you went to (by the gods was I wrong). I had been transitioning for 2.5 years and tacitly thought about getting surgery. Yes, I wanted to get surgery someday but i didn&#39;t know when...then the dysphoria hit me hard (Word to the wise if you are remotely thinking about surgery, start as soon as you can, give yourself the option for who you want). I was panicked about needing surgery and trying to search for both a surgeon and a hospital that were in-network (they both have to be or you get screwed on the bill). I found a few surgeons and consulted my budget, Rumer was the only one that kept popping up (I hate how this is the system we live in). I tried looking up reviews on google, reddit, facebook (i never went into the groups), susan&#39;s place,...everything seemed to give the same &#34;meh&#34; overview so i scheduled something. I told a few friends and they researched her but nothing screamed &#34;don&#39;t go to her!&#34; or &#34;these are my results&#34;.  (my guess is that she threatens sites to take down unwanted info). By the time all my paper work was in place I was mentally committed to getting the surgery, anything short of that would have been suicidal.
</p>
<p>
Learn from my mistake kids if you want surgery start making plans and appointments, It will give you the option down the road when you want to have it.

Thank you for your continued vulnerability.

I&#39;ve met someone in person who shared their traumatic story about this surgeon.  You aren&#39;t alone as a victim of their work. While I was in Ga she was the only option I had through my insurance.  I really hope from the bottom of my heart that your revision goes well and you get to a point you are happy.

Ugh, I&#39;m so sorry.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t mind me asking- what led to you choosing her as a surgeon? Were you aware of her reputation? I can totally understand that dysphoria or insurance issues can limit options, and you&#39;ll just take whatever you can get.
</p>
<p>
Wishing you all the best, and thank you so much for sharing such a difficult experience.

at the time no, it was only after my surgery that information started to surface for me. You hit the nail on the head, insurance and dysphoria were they two main factors in my decision. It sucks, having your choices ripped from you by a system that only cares about their bottom line. anyways, there is no use crying over it now, she&#39;ll get fixed i just have to be patient

Would you mind expanding on the state of your knowledge prior to surgery? I spend a lot of time online and I have the I impression that there’s a lots of seperate trans communities that don’t interact much, and I’d like to understand better how to share our experiences.
</p>
<p>
Did you research online prior to surgery? If so, how and where? We’re you a member of any online communities? Any in personal local communities? Who, if anyone, reccomended her?

Updated.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not a big facebook user and since so many of they are behind a join and validation it just didn&#39;t seem worth it. I really like the idea of people posting and updating the wiki with personal account of results/treatment. it also makes it easy to share as a giant list.

Thanks. You wouldn’t find much on Facebook unless you got lucky. Facebook doesn’t allow post-op photos and search doesn’t work very well.

yeah, I&#39;m just starting to realize how messed up her practice is. Doctors have lost their medical careers for half of the stuff she has done. I&#39;m surprised she has not inadvertently killed someone.

Thank you.  It’s been over two years and the hurt is still there.  Did Kathy question your mental health in your records?

nope. If she has any records, she didn&#39;t send any of them to the specialist I went .

Also sorry to hear how much pain she has caused you.

There’s lots of people that enable this behaviour.
</p>
<p>
Let’s not forget that she also presents at trans conferences and is a prominent advertiser at “trans” sites.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dr. Rumer is a regular sponsor of and presenter at transgender conferences, including the very popular Philly Trans Health Conference.

And while there’s a few surgeons who have spoke out against her, there others who support her

</p>
<p>
Insurance companies are not known for ethics, but lastly, she still has a license to practice medicine.

I’m sorry that Dr. Rumer  botched you too,  but thanks for being a stand up woman and letting the community know what happened to you.  It’s better to wait a year or two to get a good surgeon.  I worry because of the folks who take chances with almost predictably incompetant surgeons like Rumor.  There is one example in the Wiki that would be comical if it didn’t reside on a human being.
</p>
<p>
I had a hard time figuring out what is going on with Your result, but it looks like a revision with a skilled and experienced surgeon will work wonders on your “business.” 👍

I am happy to hear that you are getting a revision, that is awesome! I am sorry you went through this and thank you so much for sharing this information with the community. There should be more that could be done. I wonder if you could report her to a surgical board for malpractice there is no excuse for this type of treatment.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best of luck going forward warm thoughts and cozy feelings ❤️🤗.

Hi she appears to be in PA. I did a license search for her to verify she actually does have one. It seems she does so that means you can file a complaint with the state board. They will investigate. I highly recommend putting any information in there including that there is more than just yourself this has happened to. Maybe that she has an extremely bad reputation within the trans community.
</p>
<p>
Here is the link.

Just click “file a complaint”.

Oh geez! I’m so sorry you didn’t get better results and have a better experience! Unfortunately, she does get a lot of business because she’s on a lot of insurance plans — my insurance tried to offer her to me and I immediately told them “not just no, but
<em>
hell no
</em>
!”
</p>
<p>
I’m dismayed that she readily rejected any revisions - that speaks volumes for where her priorities lie. If she were in this to help trans people, she’d be all over trying to make things better when they can be made better; instead, it’s about keeping the pipeline flowing so the money keeps rolling in.

pretty much. Insurance companies like her because she does not force then to cover hair removal as part of her pre-op. And she has been sued enough times that the word revision triggers her. tbh the notes part was the most telling for me. She only does the bare minimum of keeping surgery records.

Thanks for sharing, it’s not easy when things don’t turn out well. I feel very sorry for you but I see you have a very positive attitude so you will overcome this. You already have. Hope everything goes smoothly when you fix her! Good luck!

I am 1 week post op with Rumer and never heard any horror stories. My roommate went to her and basically worships her... says that hers isnt butchered since she gets so many guys with it 🙄🙄🙄
</p>
<p>
Im terrified though. I mean I think mine looks like it was just cut open and stitched up... obviously... but I feel I might have just fucked up my entire life from now on... 🥺🥺

So im genderfluid afab, mostly just here learning about various surgeries in case my fiancée decides she does in fact want to medically transition. Im mad and sad for you! I cant believe the way you were treated! I really hope a different surgeon can fix you up proper. And I hope youre not too badly emotionally scarred from this whole situation.

I&#39;m lucky enough to have really good internal support and I should be ok so long as I know she will be fixed proper.
</p>
<p>
the wiki here is becoming a pretty good resources of results and experiences.
</p>
<p>
should your fiancee get surgery hopefully I&#39;ve provides a decent cautionary tale about who to avoid and what to be mindful of. I wish you both the best in figuring this out.

I&#39;m so sorry your surgeon was being so careless. You could file a lawsuit for her negligence to your complication. She should consider a revision even if a problem arised hours after surgery. I&#39;m guessing her victims always need revisions, so she&#39;s being lazy. I wonder how she made it to the top of the surgeon&#39;s list, especially if she doesn&#39;t take insurance and does this. That&#39;s very sad.. I hope everything works out.

Hun, I am so sorry this happened to you. No one should receive this type of treatment. Have you considered doing a revision with Dr. McGinn?  She has a great reputation, she is in Pennsylvania, and her waitlist may be a lot shorter.
</p>
<p>
Hope all is well and wish you a speedy recovery. Xoxo

that would be great but I don&#39;t live in PA, and no offense but I think I will go with the original surgeon I had in mind, but insurance and dysphoria at that the time were not lining up.

I don&#39;t understand why people still go to butcher Rumer despite many saying she is a butcher. It is like someone is minimizing the botched jobs she has done and sends others for the slaughter. And then there is those despite being warned they still go. Did you know before hand that she was a butcher? If not then you are a victim if you knew then why did you go? It&#39;s suicide going to surgeons you knowingly botched others.

I tried to research her but couldn&#39;t find much on her, good or bad...hence my post. mostly i just came to the conclusion that I was rolling the dice and would get a revision afterwords if it was bad. I just didn&#39;t realize the odds of a successful surgery were so low.  Had I been warned in passing but i could never find anything concrete or from someone who went to her I even asked here several times before my surgery and never got a response.
</p>
<p>
at the time my dysphoria was so bad that a 6 month turnaround from consultation to surgery was too good to pass up and I would rather get her fixed after the fact if things would be bad. however, I never could have anticipated that she would be so prideful that she would flat out refuse to do any revision and blame any botched results on her patients.
</p>
<p>
You seem to be rather passionate about spreading the word of her destruction. So please, compile your research and post it so that others here may benefit. Hell, include my post if it will help.

You should sue her. There was another botched grs here by Alexander Sinclair and they started their claim. You should do the same.

Unfortunately to sue a GRS doctor youd have to have another one willing to speak out against them... good luck with getting anyone to talk about the negatives of another person performing a very specific, very exclusive surgery, that they also perform.

Yes that&#39;s true for any surgery. But I&#39;d rather encourage the OP to try and seek justice than give up on the bat. If she won&#39;t sue. Atleast report butcher Rumer to the medical board.

I can say their are many factors that are at play in healing. Diet is a huge factor. And some other things. I had a consult with her and while she was not warm and fuzzy she seems to be at the top of her game.

As someone who is post-op I can definitely say if this is the top of her game then she needs to retire. She leave butchery in her wake and from my understanding any good result is a fluke. Seriously look at the wiki.
</p>
<p>
You seem to be cheer leading for her, but to address your points.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Post-op I was on a vegan low fat, high protein diet (medically the best for surgery recovery).
</li>
<li>
My PCP was concerned about my healing, yet she gaslit me at every instance.
</li>
<li>
both a gynecologist, and the surgeon for my revision expressed concerns but lamented there was little they could do outside of a full revision because of how much she fucked up.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Honestly how can you look at the above pictures and say she a good surgeon?

People go to her because she accepts insurance andmher office helpsthe whole thing along.  The other two in Pennsylvania in the Eastern  region (McGinn and Leis) prefer to be paid up front and will help you get reimbursee by insurance.

I&#39;m pretty sure she is upset about her result, and she did mention sensation.
</p>
<p>
Kind of feels like you didn&#39;t read her post and you don&#39;t understand the reputation of this surgeon.

I see no proof, and while a little odd, I see no harm.

Your account is suspicious, there is potential harm if the accusations are false, and I’m more inclined to ban you.
