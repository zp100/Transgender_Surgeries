Hi !
</p>
<p>
My girlfriend has surgery since 2 days.  Today, nurses told us that every painkiller they gave her CAME WITH A COST !
</p>
<p>
They said that she has to pay for every painkiller!!
</p>
<p>
Ephedrin, Epidural, ...  But what ? She already paid EVERYTHING !!!!
</p>
<p>
How can we do ? We don&#39;t have enough money !  Pay for every painkiller ?  Each shot is more than 160$ ! Whaaaaaat ?
</p>
<p>
Was that the same for you ?
</p>
<p>
Thanks
</p>
<p>

I was there in October and was never told that painkillers had a cost but I&#39;d already paid everything in advance and bought the 10,000 baht hospital voucher so maybe it was coming out of there? I&#39;m not sure to be honest.
</p>
<p>
I did have to buy a second voucher (it was a smaller amount, I think 2500 baht but I can&#39;t remember) when I was there, about 10 days before I went home, but I was having 3 meals a day minimum + extras from the cafe and all of the extra dilation supplies so I think it adds up correctly. Dilator number 5 is way more expensive than it needs to be as well. No way was I paying $160 per painkiller shot though. I only had three but even one would have gone through my voucher almost immediately.

I think this makes sense actually. I was there in September and I didn&#39;t pay anything for extra pain killers that I was aware of (although granted didn&#39;t take many extra other than the provided medication, and only one shot/IV pain killer) and my voucher did run out sooner than I was expecting.
</p>
<p>
I never got told so I don&#39;t know but if it came from there I wouldn&#39;t be surprised ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I paid everything in advance and probably over payed a bit with estimating currency exchange.  I wasn‚Äôt charged anything extra till about 6 days post op I think?

Was the extra cost disclosed to you before you this point? In anything you signed, on the website, etc.

Yeah. It&#39;s about $150 USD for another epidural (the one that goes in her back)
</p>
<p>
Additional pain killers are taken out of the voucher that you paid for, it should be about a 10,000 baht charge somewhere. If you need more pain control then you paid for upfront, it will cost more.
</p>
<p>
As far as I can tell the IM/IV shots for pain cost about 1,000 baht. So if you need extra pain control, that&#39;s about how much it will cost.
</p>
<p>
They will probably suggest that you need to buy another voucher for $10,000 baht once you are close to running out of that money.
</p>
<p>
This is also the money that you can use to buy pads, lubrication, food from the cafe, extra dilation supplies, etc.
</p>
<p>
I also have needed &#34;extra pain control&#34; so I have had to buy a couple of vouchers due to some wound dehiscence.
</p>
<p>
I had both GAS and FFS, so ive needed to pay a bit more due to dealing with pain from both of those.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps.  I&#39;m here right now and this is as much as I&#39;ve figured out lol

Part of the feedback I‚Äôm going to give the hospital is that there needs to be a lot more information given when you first arrive. I just go back home yesterday and can‚Äôt fault my result, but sometimes the hospitals communication leaves a lot to be desired

I tend to agree. There&#39;s also very wide quality in the nursing staff. I work in healthcare and I&#39;ve just noticed a lot of relatively small mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I had gas 2 weeks ago and ffs 5 days ago. One of the nurses was giving me shit about the IM med being potentially addictive. Ma&#39;am I&#39;ve had 2 surgeries in less than 3 weeks. Give me the med please. She also can&#39;t count to 6 on a clock. I asked for a q6 pain med after 7.5 hours and she said it was too soon. I told her to check her math. She&#39;s also the one who takes my blood pressure with the artery line not lined up and the cuff over my joint sometimes. She might need to go back to school lmao.
</p>
<p>
Sorry this legit just happened today so I&#39;m a little heated lmao.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the nursing staff are great though in my experience.

Yeah totally agree on the variability. Sri was saying that they‚Äôve recently had a big influx of new nurses that they‚Äôre training up, presumably so the poor lady can have a day off!

I got charged for medicines that I requested on top of what would normally be given. So I had to pay for diazepam that I asked for and pragabalin. I didn‚Äôt have to pay for pethedine shots though and I had lots of those. I was always told how much things cost though and it came out of the 10000 baht credit line

$150 for the epidural was money well spent. I only needed one, either 2 or 3 days postop. After that, tramadol (cheap or included?) was enough.
