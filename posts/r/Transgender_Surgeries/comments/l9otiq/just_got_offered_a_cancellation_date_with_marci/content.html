Due to restrictions where I live, I have only been able to have a session of laser hair removal with zero electrolysis. There is not a single hair removal option in my area due to COVID lockdown, and it does not appear things will open anytime soon. I still have white hair on parts of my scrotum, shaft, and perineum.
</p>
<p>
On the phone with Robin, she assured me that Marci scrapes hair during surgery and nearly 30% of their patients have zero hair removal at all. She claimed that they have never had complaints about internal hair due to their use of scrapping and surgical electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
What should I do? If I turn it down, I may not have another offer for nearly a year according to Robin since Marci is taking lots of time off. Bowers staff seem confident that it&#39;s not a big deal and it&#39;s quite common not to have hair removal completed beforehand, but that does not convince me fully.
</p>
<p>
Anyone have insight? If I turn it down, I will have to wait another year, go through the insurance authorization all over again, and there&#39;s no 100% bet that covid lockdown will get better enough to resume my hair removal for SRS.

That&#39;s a lie. I&#39;ve had issues after 18hrs of electrolysis and let them know about it.

I&#39;d be interested in hearing your story as well. I&#39;m scheduled with Bowers in May 2022 and am just getting started with electrolysis... I&#39;m worried that I won&#39;t be clear in time before the surgery, so curious what other&#39;s experiences have been.

Personally I would wait. Just my opinion but I moved my original surgery date back due to not finishing electrolysis in time, also due to Covid. When I have surgery I want to make sure everything is as right as I can make it. If it means being patient a little while longer to have better results I will wait. I made it this far already after all.
</p>
<p>
How far out is your surgery date?

Dont let this happen to you!!  Marci Bowers bowers abused my trust in her and destroyed my sex life as a result.   You might not think this is a big issue until you start having partner issues  because of your low sex drive and realize this even affects your ability to fall in love like a normal adult because sexually she left you like a kid again. To not go into much details, let&#39;s just say she overly reduced the size of my clitoris and a few more things against my will...  the only reason I&#39;ve not sued her is because the whole thing is humiliating to me and I don&#39;t want the negative publicity on this surgery as I don&#39;t regret the surgery, what I deeply regret is the surgeon!!!!!!!
<br>
She has left me a nasty reminder of her betrayal that will probably last a lifetime! Don&#39;t trust this surgeon at all!!!

I had like, 20+ electro sessions before seeing Marci, so I&#39;m likely not the best person to advise. That said, I did still have plenty of hair left over, and I seem to be more or less hair free inside.

I heard on other posts here that they can&#39;t remove any internal hair after surgery. Is that not true?

It is true. We can do some work on the outer labia, but hair inthe canal formed by the penile inversion method  grows inward and there is extremely limited access to this area for obvious reasons. You are also limited to thermolysis treatments (trust me you dont want lye in you vaginal canal!) and thermolysis requires a highly accurate insertion to accomplish the ill of the follicle, and such accurate insertions are impossible given issues with access.  Edit: I&#39;m an electrologist and one of the better known ones with regard to GRS prep  hair removal.

From what I&#39;ve read on here it seems like an actual gyno will likely have tools to get internal hairs while most electrolysis clinics won&#39;t, but it might be a good idea to reach out to some near you and see if that would he an option.

Gynecologists dont remove hair:) Elecctrologists do. gynecology is a very distinct field and there is literally no call for hair removal in it other than in transgender cases.

There are literally no laser hair clinics or electrolysis providers allowed to operate in my region due to COVID. When they called me, I explained my situation and they claimed hair removal is not necessary, just recommended and that 30% of their patients never had any hair removal at all.
</p>
<p>
They claim they&#39;ve never had a case of internal hair and im just trying to get more info from others who may have been in a similar boat.

Acceleration may not work well as follicles have different phases. By squeezing it into one short period, you will attack follicles only in 1 state. Even if you zap them all, you will have hair in &#34;waves&#34; (time wise).

Listen to your gut! What’s yours, will always be yours. there is nothing worse than the regret of having surgery you knew you should have waited for. It’s hard to forgive yourself afterwards. I wish I could go back but I can’t.

I have a small amount of hair at the lower end of the shaft, and a couple dozen white hairs on my scrotum and between my perineum. I respond super well to laser so one session on their highest setting removed 50% of my hair, and almost no colored hair remains.

Are you in the San Francisco Bay area? If so there&#39;s a few electrologists in the area who could do a couple of quick sessions this week to remove what&#39;s there. That would give you 3 weeks before your surgery.

Also remember, if it&#39;s just a few hairs the surgeon can scrape  or cauterizer them in the procedure.
