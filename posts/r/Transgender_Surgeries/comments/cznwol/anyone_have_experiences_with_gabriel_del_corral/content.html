Exploring alternatives for my MtF vaginoplasty and wanted to know if anyone could provide illuminating details on Gabriel del Corral at MedStar.

Just curious how you feel about the quality of the care you received, I&#39;m between him and someone with a much longer wait time so I wanna try to compare

I feel very positively about the whole experience. Now, some of that is probably just straight-up luck, but still.
</p>
<p>
I had no complications of any kind. It wasn&#39;t exactly pleasant for maybe 10 days, but I always felt like I was in good hands. The nurses were responsive and really encouraging. My SO was able to stay on a pull-out bed in the hospital room with me, which was so nice. I think I saw Dr. Del Corral once a day for a brief check-in. After I went home, I had his personal number but I never used it because things always went as expected.
</p>
<p>
He said at the consultation that there were some details with the clitoral hood and such that he preferred to hold off trying to add until a revision surgery because details are hard to get right during the main one. I was fine with that, and honestly I&#39;m happy with how it looks now. Still, I&#39;ll probably go ahead with a small revision to do that and tighten up some skin on the sides and even a couple things out. It&#39;s covered, so why not?
</p>
<p>
But even as things are, I&#39;m very fond of what I have down there now. It feels like as much a part of me as any other bit of my body. I think Dr Del Corral did a good job, and I&#39;m grateful to him for that and for making me feel cared for at every stage of the process.

Reasons: He was covered by insurance, local enough that I could go straight home after a week in the hospital, I felt like the results I saw from him were within the range of other more well-known surgeons, and I liked him a lot at the consultation.

Was your consultation in person or on the phone?
