I&#39;m so sorry to hear this. I remember your original post [when you tripped and fell during recovery] and had hoped you received good medical care in Sydney. So disgusted to hear how you were mistreated.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not able to advise on dilation - but have you considered a report to Anti Discrimination NSW regarding the maltreatment you received at Concord hospital? If it&#39;s something you would consider, the Inner City Legal Service has an amazing Trans and Gender Diverse legal service. They provide free telephone sessions that can offer advice.
</p>
<p>
On a positive note, you sound like a strong resilient woman. Applauding you for that and hope that continues üôå

Yes, just after i posted that, reddit banned me and kept me banned for more than 6mths. It was devastating for me as you lot were my only life life for information and sanity.
</p>
<p>
I wrote an email to the hospital and to the gender centre. The hospital gave me a bunch of bullshit about how it was an accident and the Drs (there were two seperate discharge reports written for me) were from another culture and sometimes they get him/she mixed up! Yep it was like that. The gender centre did nothing!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m done with it all, I don&#39;t go to dr anymore as I&#39;ve found all my issues are related to me being trans. Broken arm; oh that&#39;s because your trans and had surgery OS. Every single time, a medical situation boils down to i&#39;m trans. We have a long way to go. I do have my first appointment with a Gino in April, so fingers crossed I found a human.
</p>
<p>
And yes, it&#39;s mostly behind me now. I don&#39;t have labia minor and she is not what I wanted, but we have lived together for a while now and we good! At 48, no more surgery&#39;s for me.

I stopped dilating reguarly sooner than it was orderd from my surgeon. I only dilated when I wanted to play with my vagina, which was maybe 2 times a week. Nowadays(3 years post op) I dilate maybe once a month while playing with her. My depth is maybe 3inch(7,6cm).
</p>
<p>
I am mostly asexual, and I dont like penisses near me, so I don&#39;t regret it.

Thank you for your reply.
</p>
<p>
From what I&#39;ve gathered she is like a muscle, I&#39;ve lost my depth, but if I every want to start dilation again I can and I can stretch her once again.
</p>
<p>
I have dilated twice since I stopped, but only used a size 2 and was over the feeling rather quickly. I fee like it will be ok if I want to put the effort in again.  üòÅ

I asked my surgeon what would happen when i stop dilating. She said i would lose depth and it would narrow down. Nothing as serious as i was expecting.
</p>
<p>
The only thing she mentioned was regretting it in a few years.

Same, but from the information I&#39;ve gathered, I can stretch her again if I wanted to. Depth will always been gone, I&#39;m ok with that.

This is so horrible üòû I hope you get things working out and find you some local friends maybe to help keep.you company.  About the dilation I haven&#39;t made it this far yet to have hands on experience with it or the pain. I have watched all of Dr. S. GALLAHER and Dr. Heidi Wittenberg  videos on the importance of this and procedures and actually Dr. S GALLAHER today about near failure with a few patients frome not following the rules they set forth and the number one thing slacking off or totally stopping dilation and when that happens it is pretty much done with all the skin and work and the pain you have suffered already and well I don&#39;t have to tell you because you should have been told all of this. She said if worse comes to worse at least go down to the next smallest one you can use as far as you can to keep from losing the depth because she said there&#39;s no getting the depth back but the width you can. If you could get even the smallest of improvise with something that&#39;s safe to get up there to keep from losing depth even if it&#39;s small width and work back up at a pace you can tolerate.  Right or wrong before I just let it go I would use lidocaine like I have for laser treatment and numb it up since it sounds like your almost done with it anyway and maybe it would help you enough and buy some time for you to maybe get some clearer thoughts and the will to fight back and say IVE GOT THIS. Depression can be a tuff thing and I&#39;m sure if you could find you a support group close of even you care person who you was supposed to have for the first few months during the hard time straight out of surgery.  I just hate to hear this is happening to you. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t know anything that I havevto offer you.  I hope you reconsider and at least not lose all your depth.  I&#39;m praying üôè for you.

Do things that feel right for you and if stopping dilation is one of them, don&#39;t hesitate.

Uh, great advice for life in general, but I&#39;m not so sure I would apply this to medical stuff.
</p>
<p>
I am not saying that it will happen as I am not qualified on the matter but if I stopped dilation and then there is necrosis, I would definitely have regrets.

Some women change their minds after the surgery and that&#39;s fine. Sometimes having depth isn&#39;t worth the pain and tears.
