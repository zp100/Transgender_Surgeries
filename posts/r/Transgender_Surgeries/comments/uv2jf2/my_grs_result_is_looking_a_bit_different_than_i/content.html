My GRS result is looking a bit different than I had anticipated; I&#39;m not sure what to think.

First of all, I just want to say that knowing that my GRS was just several weeks ago, it will take a while before it really looks like what my final result will be.
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect and I honestly haven&#39;t seen very many vaginas up close.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what to think.  I am of athletic build; I&#39;m on the tall side; and a lot of cis guys would have been happy to have a penis the size of mine.  When I saw Dr Burin at Preecha Aesthetic Institute for my consult before my surgery in Bangkok, he remarked that there was plenty to work with.
</p>
<p>
I was a bit squeamish about looking at the result because of all the bruising and swelling, but I did look around my new vulva a little bit before I left Bangkok.  I noticed that my labia minor are very tall (I want to say much taller than any vagina I&#39;ve seen in person) and I was not able to retract my clitoral hood (owing to the temporary stitching) and to this day, I still haven&#39;t seen my clitoris.  I wouldn&#39;t even be certain that I
<em>
have
</em>
a clitoris if it wasn&#39;t for me asking Dr Burin about it at my final in-person consultation.  He simply said, &#34;Your clitoris is right here&#34; as he placed his finger on a sensitive spot.  I would have thought that with everything else on the big side, the clitoris would be big and prominent.
</p>
<p>
Weeks later, I still don&#39;t often touch my vulva much owing to the soreness (which was not helped by my contracting a UTI that I&#39;m still taking antibiotics to clear).
</p>
<p>
I want to say that I couldn&#39;t see one particular thing about my vulva that seemed wrong or out of place, but it just seemed
<em>
different
</em>
and not in a positive way.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I read the Wikipedia article on &#34;vulva&#34; and found the description that there is variation between individuals regarding length between the vaginal opening and the clitoris; my distance would be on the extreme end being well over 3 cm (but I haven&#39;t actually measured.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just wondering if what I described suggests that there is something unusual about my body or something odd about my surgical outcome.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m trying not to borrow trouble, but even if I didn&#39;t get the best outcome, it sure is nice to be free from my old bottom dysphoria.

My labia minora was pretty swollen after surgery too at the time I was anxious about it but looking back it was kinda cute. While they have shrunk quite a bit I do still feel like they are thicker than the labia minora on a natal vulva. I don‚Äôt really care though, they‚Äôre also asymmetrical because my body is a bit of a meanie.
</p>
<p>
I actually specifically asked my surgeon for a tiny heavily hooded clit, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be happy with a big or prominent one and while I got exactly what I asked for I am often anxious about it because I feel like it‚Äôs not might make oral sex and other stuff challenging (I am not in a relationship and don‚Äôt plan to be, also only like men). I can orgasm just fine but I don‚Äôt want my vagina to put me under any ‚Äúscrutiny‚Äù and I suspect a clitoris that is very small and can‚Äôt be felt during sexual acts is rare in cis women. I also don‚Äôt want someone spreading me open to get to it. Still though I‚Äôd probably have issues if it was bigger too. I‚Äôm not sure there is a ‚ÄúGoldilocks‚Äù situation when it comes to SRS as there is so much to do, I‚Äôm kinda glad my surgeon focused more on not puncturing my insides.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been where you are when it comes to scrutinizing and worrying about your vagina‚Äôs appearance and in a lot of ways I‚Äôm still there. I was actually going to write a post about it but I think they‚Äôre not enough post-op folks here for it to end up being a helpful thread. I‚Äôm not even sure if this comment is helpful. Your vagina looks different to you because you know it‚Äôs different. You know it was created not through a meticulous nine month process but through a surgery that tried to recreate that process over several hours and if you‚Äôre anything like me you probably feel a bit shitty about that and it can be a hard feeling to navigate. I try to keep in my mind that I am still healing as it‚Äôs not been a year.
</p>
<p>
From what I‚Äôve gathered from my own experiences and from I‚Äôve seen from others, there isn‚Äôt too much I can tell you to make you feel better if you‚Äôre committed to feeling down about it, but what really helps me is just living (not in the working 9-5 grind way but in the doing things that make me happy and fulfill me way). I‚Äôm very privileged because this surgery has given me so much that I take for granted everyday, before surgery I literally had no idea what it was like to be comfortable in your body, I was always trying to shape myself in ways that would let me avoid dysphoria. Now I finally understand the relief of taking off your jeans after a long day or the bliss of sleeping nude and it makes me sad to think that if I‚Äôd been alive just 60 years ago or born in a different country that this comfort and ease that most people are just born with would likely not be with me. It‚Äôs something that I have regardless of how thick my labia are or how high up my clit is and no one can ever really take it from me now.

Your labia are big likely because they are swollen. Size will go down tremendously when swelling goes away and it will be easier to expose the clitoris when they are not swollen anymore. When things have settled you can still decide if you want an aesthetic revision. Also, how would you estimate the distance between your vaginal opening and clitoris if you don&#39;t see where it is and it can also be influenced by swelling. So first give it more time to heal.

It‚Äôs really gunna take a few months for swelling to get to a good place, start exploring
</p>
<p>
Also you can get a labiaplasty after like 6 months if you want
