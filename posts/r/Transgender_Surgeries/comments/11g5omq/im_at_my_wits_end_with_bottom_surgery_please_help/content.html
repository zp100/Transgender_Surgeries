UPDATE: IT WAS AN INFECTION  CANESBALANCE LACTIC ACID. 3 TREATMENTS AND ITS GONE 😭😭😭 THANK YOU EVERYONE
</p>
<p>
Y’all, I’m literally at my wits end I have no clue what to do anymore. This surgery has absolutely ruined my sex life.  ￼ I had surgery in 2020, and since 6 months post op I have been experiencing brown and feces smelling discharge on the end of my dialators. So we would think it’s an anal fistula, right? That there’s some sort of hole in my canal?
</p>
<p>
Well, no because I did a CT scan at the hospital and they found no signs of fistula or anything wrong with it at all, and they were actually surprised by my result.
</p>
<p>
It’s gotten to a point where it’s completely pointless, having sex, Im not even letting anyone touch me down there, because 99.9% of the time it literally smells like they put their fingers in a dirty anus￼. I’m not able to have casual sex. I’m not able to even act on my attraction to anyone at this point.
</p>
<p>
What the actual hell could this be?  Is my lining not thick enough and the mucus is getting through?? I’m literally having to give up on sex at this point and the Hospital doesn’t have any suggestions. I’m asking for the CT to be sent to my surgeon.

Good advice. A plain (without contrast dye) is a poor test to try to find a fistula with. It might show up, but it might not. Even with contrast no test in medicine is 100% accurate. Things can and will get missed. This needs either a contrast CT (with oral contrast) and/or someone to actually look inside and see what&#39;s going on. Also needs swabs to look for various possible infections.

I did a contrast, and had it internally examined. I believe I also had a swab. I think I need to stop douching for a few days in order for whatever it is to come up on a swab because they said there was nothing.

MRI is far superior than contrast CT for fistulas. Have ur MRI in a very competent hospital

Cost. MRI is almost always done as a second to a CT and mostly only done if the CT thinks it saw something. My 2¢

Maybe ur doctor is not that good. Look for a better one. Yes MRI  is more expensive but it couldve saved a lot of time and trouble if u were advised to have it in the 1st place

I thought that’s what I was going in for and then they did the contrast CT. I’m gonna make my doctor do an MRI, the contrast enema and everything I can. I just got the CT results back not too long ago and faxed them over today. No real answers. I just keep thinking it’s going to go away on its own and my lifestyle won’t allow for surgery right now 🥲ughhhh

Exactly so I don’t know why they’re acting like it’s a mystery. I was referred to women’s college hospital, which is one of the only two places in Canada that has bottom surgery available. I was examined by someone who does surgeries and they were stumped. Would I need to have a revision if this is the case?

Yeah, it&#39;s second opinion time. If it looks like a duck, smells like a duck, then I think there might be a duck pooping in your vagina... (or y&#39;know, a fistula.)

Basically, you just want to clean out the poop from your system. A few days fast with only water, and mild liquids like clear broth, apple juice or whatever should do it. If there’s no poop, snd you still smell bad, then it’s something else. If the poop smell goes away, then there’s a fistula they just can’t see.

It’s most likely an infection by Enterococcus Fecalis and other bacteria that belong in your bowel but not the vagina. This is very common, the problem in your case seems to be that it went unchecked for a long time and it got really bad.
</p>
<p>
Don’t despair, the infection is treatable fairly well, you just need to get thee to a good gynecologist and be your own advocate. Sometimes they don’t cultivate all bacteria in a swab, sometimes they fuck up the swab, basically it’s a certainty there is some bad bacteria in there so you need to work the medical system until they identify it and give you treatment. Antibiotics, both topical and systemic.

I don’t know about Canesten. I think that’s for Candida, so more fungal, although weirdly sometimes these can work as well.
</p>
<p>
One thing that works is called Macmiror Complex. Google it to find out the ingredients. It comes as oral pills, cream for the vulva, and intravaginal globules. You can really hit the infection from all directions with it :)
</p>
<p>
Another product that worked really well is dequalinium chloride intravaginal tablets. That took care of it quick.
</p>
<p>
Now the unfortunate thing is that it tends to come back. Because neovaginas don’t have lactobacilli in them, or not enough. Lactobacili and the lactic acid they produce protect against this unwanted bacteria in natal vaginas.
</p>
<p>
Probiotics could help, but I had only partial and temporary success with them. Again you wanna use both oral and intravaginal. I heard good things about lactobacillus crispatus, so try to look for something that has it.
</p>
<p>
I also have a really awful diet at the moment so that isn’t helping, I bet. I think, or rather hope, that with a really good diet and ongoing probiotics use, this can be resolved for the long term. Not in a place, mentally, to try that, tho. So I treat short term with the things I mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!! 🍀 I hope it works out for you and you get better ❤️

As others said, additionally trying probiotics may be an option. And after all is healed, a number of people phase out douching eventually.

Have you tried probiotics and other vaginal suppositories? Have you been checked by your original surgeon? Try douching more, and no vagina smells like an anus including neovagina.

In all seriousness, though, I haven’t tried probiotics or any suppositories… Do you think coconut oil would help? At this point I’m just convinced that it’s mucous leakage.

Asked a gynecologist friend and she said it sounds like a classic presentation of fistula; since it’s not showing up on CT, you should request either a sigmoidoscopy or an MRI.

As per the above, and given your original CT was with contrast the next possible steps could be:
</p>
<p>
Repeat internal exam (vaginally) Sigmoidoscopy MRI Contrast enema CT More swabs for a wider range of organisms
</p>
<p>
What order people do those in is highly variable, and likely different people would do things in different orders. Where I work MRI is the most easily available off that list other than examination, so I&#39;d get that first. Probably next I&#39;d go to contrast enema CT, but by that point it&#39;s well outside my normal practice so in reality it would be down to whatever the gynecology team suggested.

That actually sounds like far to much, esspecially so late after surgery. U am ofc also no specialist, but how is your vagina supposed to build any kind of biome or resistance if you douche almost daily

I have let it go more than a few days before, and the only difference is that it just gets worse since it’s accumulated.

Have you tried any good bacteria like probiotics as a suppository?
</p>
<p>
I normally recommend fermented products to other trans girls like fermented milk or sauerkraut

I&#39;m sorry to hear about the thing involving your ex, that sucks.  I really hope you figure it out soon ❤️
</p>
<p>
I think in parallel with tracking it down with more imaging, it&#39;s worth doing some flora rebuilding, as others have mentioned.  There supposedly are suppositories with I think lactobacillus, or just a bunch yogurt or kefir, and easing off on the douching.  Just my theories.  I&#39;m still waiting on ohip.
