Beyond your result (it&#39;s very good), I love the design of your nails, What model are they?

I‚Äôm exactly 12 weeks post op with Bella and I‚Äôm super swollen still too. It‚Äôs not really noticeable most days but I can really feel it sitting down especially if I try and keep my knees together.

You should join us on the Sinai discord if you‚Äôre not there!

The same happens to me. Some days it‚Äôll be fine, but then on other days it‚Äôs so puffy. I‚Äôd love to be a part of it! How can I join? A link?

Looks fantastic! I have surgery with Bella this August.
</p>
<p>
Do you have any advice for the first few weeks of healing?
</p>
<p>
How was your hospital stay?
</p>
<p>
If you had pain was it well controlled with medication?
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s something you found invaluable to have during recovery?

Do as little as possible. Really. When Bella says be a couch potato be a couch potato. Make your caretaker do everything for you.
</p>
<p>
Hospital stay was great at NYEE. Was very comfortable.
</p>
<p>
My pain hovered between a 0 and 1 with just base meds, no oxycodone. Ymmv here.
</p>
<p>
Buy a peri bottle. It‚Äôll be your best friend.

It&#39;s been a year for me and mine are also puffy. At this point I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s simply because of my initial size. It&#39;s fun to play with!
</p>
<p>
Friends and partners call it a &#34;fat puss&#34;. I kinda like it.

I&#39;m 10 months in, Bella was my surgeon too. My labia are still a bit puffy but the swelling has gone done significantly. I feel like it was around 6-7 months after my surgery before the swelling started to really improve. The skin heals pretty quickly but the internal healing takes a long time!

So I&#39;m contemplating going with Ting or Avanessian.
</p>
<p>
I have a host of questions. Please feel free to answer or not if they are too personal. Also, apologies in advance I ask a lot of questions. It&#39;s a big decision haha.
</p>
<p>
How has your recovery time been?
</p>
<p>
How long were you in the hospital?
</p>
<p>
When could you return to normal-ish life?
</p>
<p>
How were they to meet with ‚Äî did they make you feel comfortable?
</p>
<p>
How long was the wait between making the appointment and going to surgery?
</p>
<p>
Have you noticed having self lubrication, etc?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve only seen the tunica brought up a few times. Is it for lubrication?
</p>
<p>
Did you have any type of asthetic conversation with them? Or is it just kind of whatever shows up shows up?
</p>
<p>
How long would you say it took for you to have positive sensation?
</p>
<p>
I think that&#39;s it for now. Thank you again in advance üôÇ
