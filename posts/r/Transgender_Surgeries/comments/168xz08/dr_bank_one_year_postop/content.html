This may be the best aesthetic result I&#39;ve ever seen. Hopefully everything is working properly. Congratulations!

This has to be one of the most perfect results I’ve ever seen. Your clitoral hood, and clitoris are as natural as they come.

A little over the one year mark. Overall I&#39;m very happy with my result, however the majora are a lot larger than I&#39;d like and I will be
<del>
seeking
</del>
<em>
looking into a potential
</em>
* revision to address this, as well as possibly some work to the posterior and maybe anterior also.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who are thinking of going with Dr Bank, bear in mind that he tends to do majora on the larger side (sometimes far larger side). I asked for &#39;not too big, not too small&#39;. If I were to do it again, I&#39;d ask for only slight, mostly flat majora.
</p>
<p>
Recovery for the most part was ok, however dilation for me was hell for months. At one point it was taking me hours at a time just to get to depth and this was when I was still dilating 2 and 3 times a day, so my life was dilation (painful dilation at that) for many months. I am now down to once a day, get to depth in around 15 to 20 minutes and can comfortably skip days here and there. I&#39;m hopeful that I&#39;ll be able to reduce frequency to every other day soon enough.
</p>
<p>
- Thank you for all the lovely comments and messages. Rather overwhelmed and surprised at such a reaction and so many people saying how good it looks, looks cis etc :P x

Honestly, it may be your dysphoria talking when you&#39;re considering your majora. Obviously you should do what makes you happiest, but this is seriously the best result I&#39;ve seen. Everything is in perfect proportion in this photo.

not at all. i would honestly just assume it’s the line/border where the hairy skin on the outer labia ends and the really soft skin begins, forgive me for my rough terminology 😅

Yes, but generally cis women aren&#39;t having surgery to give them a vulva/vagina? The person I replied to said they would have thought I&#39;m cis and I was saying do my scars not give away that I&#39;m not cis i.e have had SRS. Also just to add that sometimes things heal so well that the scarring is basically invisible.

I think your scarring is such that you can see it if you’re trying to look for it, but to 99% of people it’s just a vagina. Congrats!!

Wow, the best result you&#39;ve seen? Thank you for saying. I think the pic where I&#39;m stood up maybe is just favourable lighting, as they do appear a little larger in different light. I should clarify that I&#39;m not 100% set on a revision. I&#39;ll be getting in touch with Dr Bank soon to discuss my options and whether it&#39;s worth doing anything or just leaving as in - which I think I&#39;ll be happy to if it sounds too involved to address the majora.

I&#39;m not 100% set on a revision just yet, but I will be discussing things with Dr Bank and deciding what to do from there. It is just the top of the majora (which are very prominent when I&#39;m stood up) and the posterior that I want addressing, I&#39;m ecstatic with everything else.

I don&#39;t think the pictures convey just how large they are, as they do flatten out a lot when my legs are spread. When I&#39;m stood up or sat down with my legs together they do appear very large/fatty (especially at the top) and certainly a little larger than I&#39;d like if I were able to perfect things.

It’s safer to err on the larger side as it’s so easy to reduce it in a revision. The other way around is a problem. Having said, that I can’t really see it.

Oh yes, of course, however I just wish they were a little bit smaller and then it&#39;d save me the hassle of potentially having further surgery. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way someone would consider mine too small, not by a long shot (especially when seen in person, it doesn&#39;t fully come across in the pictures).

Sounds like we&#39;re in agreement, but they key point is you can&#39;t know how its going to turn out before or during the surgery, so they take the safer option. Lots of women go to Suporn Clinic with the intent of having revision anyway, but you seem to have an unusually good result - from these photos its hard to see what a revision could offer apart from this one issue. It seems Bank just keeps getting better over time.
</p>
<p>
It does looks like you have some internal hair.

Oh absolutely. In a perfect world I&#39;d like them a little smaller off the bat, but I don&#39;t blame Dr Bank for making them too large. I know it is what it is and you can always reduce as oppose to increase their size (at least as easily).
</p>
<p>
Also wow, an unusually good result of Bank&#39;s? Coming from you I&#39;ll take that as a massive compliment as I imagine you&#39;ve seen your fair share of them.
</p>
<p>
I do have a little yes. Planning on getting electrolysis soon to try and sort that.

wait, which majora? it&#39;s jsut looks like a innie?? they are not big at all!
</p>
<p>
it jsut looks perfect! what technique did he use?
</p>
<p>
regardless, great results and thank you for the spread picture - the only question I have is: do you have hair inside the canal, or does it only look like that (4th picture)?

Thank you - yeah I suppose it is just quite a pronounced innie and it&#39;s not that I&#39;m upset with my result or anything. He only uses the one technique, which was developed by his predecessor Dr Suporn (hence The Suporn Clinic, which is where he&#39;s based).
</p>
<p>
The in depth explanation is on their website, however the short version is they use a scrotal graft (and tunica vaginalis if you opt for it) for the canal, the glans is repurposed into the clitoris and the penile skin is fashioned into the labia minora, hood etc.

I do have a small amount right in the entrance yes, however considering I had no hair removal whatsoever I&#39;m overall just pleased that there&#39;s not more. I&#39;ll be shortly seeking out an electrologist who can zap those for me (not looking forward to that lol), however I would definitely recommend getting hair removal in the areas they suggest prior to surgery if you can.

Thank you for your answer sofar! I have some more questions, if its okay
</p>
<p>
How is it, like, how does it feel, can you actually feel stuff inside, like tactile experience/perception? Can you compare it to something? (like contrast between arm or finger, or mouth inside, or previous genital parts/sensitivity)?
</p>
<p>
Can you use your muscles to &#34;hold&#34; or &#34;pull&#34;? Like this benwa balls and other stuff? And how elastic/stretchy is the vagina?

No problem :)
</p>
<p>
Yes, the canal is sensate, however it&#39;s hard to describe. The skin itself is soft and smooth, sort of like inside of cheek but a bit different also.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve not tried anything like benwa balls but I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be able to as I can engage my pelvic floor muscles what feels like along the length of my canal. I don&#39;t think mine is all that stretchy unfortunately. I believe this is one of the limitations compared to a natal vagina - less elasticity.

I honestly skimmed your first paragraph and misread it as “the majora are a lot smaller than I’d like.”
</p>
<p>
I then went to the top and scrolled through your pictures, thinking to myself — yea, I can definitely see them being too small, I would want a revision to make them larger if possible too.
</p>
<p>
I then re-read your comment, and I can honestly say that you look totally fine! Your results are gorgeous, and I have to echo
<a href="/u/Starlight_171">/u/Starlight_171
</a>
. It’s our tendency to gravitate towards tiny details, to always feel like we’re never good enough. But the truth is that people tend to fixate on and gravitate towards fixing things that objectively don’t need fixing. I know how much the dysphoria sucks; just know that your results are beautiful.

Genuine question, how much depth do you actually get from surgery like this? Cause for me I&#39;d also want to be able to &#34;use&#34; my pussy if I got the surgery
</p>
<p>
Yours looks amazing though!! I&#39;m glad it turned out so well!

I&#39;ve around 6 inches of depth and this seems to be a fairly common depth with Dr Bank, though some people get more and some get less. Though I don&#39;t think he gets less than 5 (unless I&#39;d imagine there was a complication or something).

I heavily advise against revision. Your vagina appears 100% cis and it&#39;s pretty too! It&#39;s not worth the risks to do another vaginoplasty to remove some of your best and healed skin.

I&#39;m not totally set on a revision just yet, but I will be speaking to Dr Bank to see what he says and will base my decision on what he says he&#39;d need to actually do to make changes to the majora. If it sounds like majora work with another long recovery I&#39;ll likely leave it.

I&#39;m trying to book with bank too, I just can&#39;t get over how perfect the aesthetic looks. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re not completely satisfied with the appearance but what about everything else? Sensation? How do clothes fit now? That&#39;s a huge source of dysphoria for me. Also how many tries did it take you to get a date? This will be my second time applying.

I would definitely recommend them based on my experience, however bear in mind that once you leave Thailand you have to communicate via email and they&#39;re sometimes not very helpful. Other than that though, whilst I was there I felt very cared for. You&#39;re in the hospital for a week and then afterwards have daily nurse visits at your hotel. They make you stay at one specific hotel, so it&#39;s a bit like a trans woman resort lol. It was nice to be surrounded by others going through the same stuff and we would meet up for breakfast and dinner most days if we were feeling up to it - made it quite a special experience.
</p>
<p>
Sensation is mostly as it was, just rearranged of course, however because of this, there is one particular spot/sensation which is a bit harder to get to. Head space is certainly more important now, but everything works and feels good.
</p>
<p>
Clothes fit wonderfully and I still get euphoria lmao, even happened today just before heading out the door.
</p>
<p>
I missed out on my first try, but said I was open for any cancellations and a week later got lucky with a date two months down the line. Fingers crossed for you that you get a date soon :)

How much would you say you had to communicate with them once you&#39;d returned home?
</p>
<p>
Does whoever you take with you stay in that same hotel? Also I don&#39;t suppose you remember if they had vegan options in the hotel?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a little worried about losing what little sensation I have now tbh, I&#39;m still debating on whether or not I should go through with it. Its a lot of money I don&#39;t have 😅

I had a bit of back and forth with them as I was desperate for anything that might have helped improve my dilation. There unfortunately wasn&#39;t anything - just time and gritting my teeth...and tramadol haha.
</p>
<p>
They can stay with you but they&#39;re also of course free to go and stay where they like. It&#39;s just the patient that needs to be there, so the nurses can easily do their daily checks on everyone.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure about vegan options, however I&#39;d imagine they might not have any. They seem to have a bit of a different concept of vegetarian and vegan and if I recall correctly someone asked for something vegan, but it was cooked in oyster sauce, which as I&#39;m sure you can guess, is not vegan lol. The food selection from the hotel was OK (fresh fruit was my fave), however they also allow you to order from the restaurant on the ground floor and that has much more choice. Again though, I doubt much if anything is going to be vegan.
</p>
<p>
Sensation of course is going to be unpredictable. Some people report more, some less, some little or no change. There&#39;s a lot being rearranged and nerves have to reconnect, which may not always happen. Nerve zaps early on are funny. Sometimes they&#39;re intense but I found them reassuring that stuff was healing and reconnecting.
</p>
<p>
I know it&#39;s a lot of money, but compared to a lot of other surgeons they&#39;re very reasonably priced or even cheap. The outcome and level of care I got, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have gotten close to in the UK for the same price (if at all) - it&#39;s a month of daily nurse visits, one or two check-ups a week with Dr Bank (I forget) and we even went down to their beach house, had some food and (non-alcoholic) drinks and then had a Thai massage. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s still tough, but it feels like they do actually care and try to make such a major ordeal as pleasant as they can.

I&#39;m not looking forward to dilation 😅
</p>
<p>
Believe it or not there&#39;s actually a pretty intense debate amongst vegans on whether or not non sentient animals like oysters are acceptable to eat considering they lack the ability to suffer 🤷🏻‍♀️ I guess food is something I&#39;ll need to figure out separately before I go 😊
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad to hear how positive a level of care they seem to afford every patient, and yeah, the price is high but compared to others it&#39;s actually incredible. You&#39;ve been a massive help, thank you very much 😁

Most people had a much easier time than me, so honestly don&#39;t expect your experience to be like mine - you&#39;d have to be very unlucky to. A lot of people do experience some discomfort and pain of course, but there are others on the other end of the spectrum, who seemingly breezed through it (not jealous at all lol).

This is absolutely incredible and has basically single-handedly sold me on seeing Dr Bank. Congratulations on an AMAZING result! If I may ask a few questions, does Dr Bank have any BMI restrictions? What was the ballpark figure for the entire thing, flights, hotel, surgery, anaesthesiologist, aftercare etc?

I imagine he would have a BMI restriction yes. If I&#39;m not mistaken the limit is usually around 30 for a lot of surgeons, though ofc double check this with them.
</p>
<p>
The surgery itself cost me around £13,000 and then I&#39;d say I probably spent another £3,000 or so for my flights, accommodation for the month and food - maybe a little bit more. The accommodation was also a little more than it could have been, as I got a somewhat fancy room for me and my partner (though not the most expensive they offer).

Thats all-in about £6,000 cheaper than just the surgery in the UK! WOW! Also, thanks for responding so quickly. Was there any part of the process and/or recovery that you didn&#39;t know ahead of time that you&#39;d have wanted to know(?) or advice you&#39;d give to people looking to get this surgery with Dr Bank?

Yeah, didn&#39;t the prices in the UK recently go up from like 15k to 25? Umm, nothing I can put my finger on, but it&#39;s all a bit of an unknown until you&#39;re actually going through it. For anyone that does actually get a date, I&#39;d advise them to join the unofficial discord. That&#39;s been great, very useful and supportive (and I&#39;m still frequently in there to this day, chatting with both people who I met whilst out there and those who I&#39;ve not met personally).
</p>
<p>
As for advice, there&#39;s a like 200+ page pdf that may be floating around on here somewhere, but is also on the discord. That&#39;s got pretty much everything you could ever ask covered. Plus I guess also, be clear on majora size lol, but also be prepared that they may still be a little on the larger side. There may also be some things you want touching up but that&#39;s what the revision, or what they&#39;re now coining cosmetic improvement period, is for. The recovery is also longer than you&#39;d expect and even at the one year mark, there&#39;s still some way for me to go in terms of dilation improvements (time to depth, frequency of dilation).

I hear ya. Good to know about the discord server. And yeah the price has shot up lately. Probably have the Tories to thank for that 😒. Yeah I saw elsewhere in the comments some discussion over Dr Banks propensity for creating sizeable majoras. FWIW I think your results are absolutely beautiful, but at the end of the day what matters most is if YOU are happy with it.
</p>
<p>
As for recovery period, yeah I&#39;ve heard the method Dr Bank uses is a lot longer recovery but generally slightly superior results to PIV overall. Thanks again.

OP&#39;s result is INCREDIBLE and I&#39;ve heard Dr Bank is consistently a very high performer for aesthetics as well as function, but it would be a disservice to many other surgeons and their patients to unintentionally imply their results are bad, hence my use of a somewhat tepid descriptor. Dr Bank&#39;s results are just frequently exceptional.

Look on this page, but you absolutely must use a browser or you won’t see everything. Reddit is full of bugs.

The flight back was actually fine, as they send you back with a slew of pills, including some strong sleeping ones. I took either half or a full one of those and slept for most of the flight. I&#39;ve got around 6 inches of depth, though &#39;girth&#39; I&#39;m not so sure about. The large dilator they provide is 34mm in diameter (which I use during each dilation) and I have occasionally tried my orange soul source dilator (38mm in diameter), however that was a little large for me at the time. It&#39;s been a while since I tried that though and plan on trying to size up soon.
</p>
<p>
The surgery was all paid for by myself - just saved up over time for it.

Ughhhhhh lol. My usual brand Estradot are wonderful. They&#39;re so small and sticky, but because of that they go out of stock so fast. The larger one is Estraderm and my god, they&#39;re shit haha. Massive and not very sticky.

Thankyou for sharing. The aesthetics are really amazing and also inspirational. I’m just flying back home from Thailand now after 53 days post with Bank, and it’s great to see such amazing results. Fills me full of hope x

Absolutely fabulous results and it’s not surprising that it’s so difficult to get into surgery date with them ( earliest I heard was 2025 plus  I would have gone there ( I did actually visit there and met Nicola there ) but money a real issue for me and even worse was time due to my age  So happy for you !!! 😊😊😊 As for the labia I feel mine is a large size  - which is your observation of yours yet looks perfect to me and I m wondered if this has become a sort of fashion with the Thais ( I had mine 2 months ago  I m told swelling will go down  My depth is good at 7.5 inches which I know is good

Nikki is lovely ^.^ and yes, unfortunately can be tricky getting in with them as there are so many trying at once.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s really great depth and quite a bit more than mine :P

Really amazing results! Congratulations on hitting one year! 🥳 I&#39;m so happy for you. You sharing your story/experience has been really helpful, so thank you for doing that too. I was curious as you mentioned in the comments that early nerve zaps (as nerves reconnect) are funny. Why funny? What did you mean by that? Also you described the sensations being intense too. How so? What&#39;s it feel like?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s wonderful you had such care afterwards with daily nurse checks for a month! That&#39;s incredible they offer that and I wish more surgeons did. How long would the nurse spend with you each day? Was there any communication barriers/struggles when you were with them in Thailand? That&#39;s a big fear of mine with the thought of possibly having my surgery outside of my native country. You&#39;re very brave to leave your own for it! Thank you again for sharing! :)

Thank you and you&#39;re welcome :)
</p>
<p>
I meant funny kind of like weird. They&#39;re not painful per se, but they&#39;re literally nerves firing off as they reconnect - and nerves in sensitive areas at that. Sometimes they can be particularly strong and made me go &#39;wow, ok&#39; and pause for a moment - the odd time they even stopped me in my tracks. It was a novel experience, for me at least. The sensation itself I can&#39;t entirely remember and it would be hard to describe anyway but um, you&#39;ll know them when you feel them, trust me haha.
</p>
<p>
It was only 5 minutes or so, as they were doing their rounds of other patients too. They do a visual check of things, ask how everything&#39;s been, make a note of your dilations, how long they took and the depth you achieved, check your blood pressure and make sure you have all the meds you need (and provide you with more if you need any).
</p>
<p>
There was a little bit of a barrier with some of the hospital nurses, but if they had an issue they would just go and get someone who spoke better English. You&#39;ll be in a little microcosm where they&#39;re dealing with foreigners all the time, so the majority of people spoke at least enough English to get through to and a lot of the clinic staff (and all of the clinic&#39;s own nurses who do the visits) spoke great English.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve always been a bit of a traveller and have been to Thailand a few times before anyway so I felt relatively comfortable going, but especially so as I felt it was the best feasible choice of surgeon I could make, given my own circumstances (and you can probably guess, I&#39;m very happy I chose as I did ^.^).

Omg your results are incredible! I have surgery booked with him for next year so this has made me incredibly excited.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask how old you are? (No pressure to answer) just as I’ve seen some of the best results seem to be on younger women and generally I’ve heard recovery is easier the younger you are? Just concerned that I’ll be 28 at the time of surgery and wonder if that’ll have any affect on healing and results

Nice outcome post op - I’m still dealing with Kamols mess of 2019 - Got my canal fixed by Theerapong 2022 and works good but aesthetically Theerapong did nothing for me couldn’t even get a personal Consult and it appears Ghosted by Interplast now , they all have hard core EGO’s these surgeons - Supporn/Banks have the skills I’d like to deal with them but they’ve stopped taking on any external aesthetics from other surgeons - It’s a real problem if not almost impossible - I could have results close to this but when nobody wants to touch it your basically screwed - I’m fixable but try and find someone ?

I had a consult with Kunaporn but he’s talking graphs from my groin and if the graphs don’t take I’ll have a worse mess ? - if it was hidden between labia minora and majora I’d risk it - surprisingly I have No visible scars at all from Kamol originally - it would take a real artist to truly fix it - all Theerapong did was external soluble stitches that disappeared pretty quick and revert’d totally back the way it was before of Kamol’s original mess (
<a href="https://imgur.com/M3HeIDn" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/M3HeIDn
</a>
) and Theerapong’s supposed fix , absolutely not acceptable here (
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/BEt3mYc" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/BEt3mYc
</a>
) since I complained it’s bruised his EGO obviously so I’m back at square one - not one of them will touch this in Bangkok except maybe Kunaporn in Phuket , that’s it ! And another $15,500 Cad dollars not including flight and time off work all over again - sick and tired of donating money to Thai Surgeons quite frankly and not getting what I want done properly ?

Well ? There’s good surgeons in the US but everyone of them want US Insurance - Min Jun basically Gas lit me and he’s a cosmetic plastic surgeon to boot wouldn’t touch it - Wittenberg/Bonnington wouldn’t touch it - it seems it’s American Insurance and they pass the Buck off to someone else “ Go Away “ Self pay they don’t want to deal with it appears and my emails sending images I guess appears aggressive to them - they want to be the hero’s and if your knowledgeable it goes against a person - in other words they want you to be a suck up and stupid so their EGO’s flourish ?
</p>
<p>
Canada is  like at least 30 years behind the US and Thailand quite frankly despite supposed acceptance Government wise but a joke just for Political browny points  and only do “PI” Brassard in Montreal of PI same with Vancouver. There’s no options 1 st time like Jejunum , Sigmoid or PPT plus Canadian OR time in surgery is an issue of cost why they only offer the 70 year old “PI” which has proven not having good aesthetics post op and dilating till your sick of doing it - Penile skin is not a good permanent surgery , my bias is Sigmoid and Jejunum to really have something that works properly in the finality post op - Ontario’s Women’s Hospital you have to live in the Province - Doctors in BC have “0” knowledge and always want to send a person to the Vancouver Bullsh#t Gender Clinic and I’ve said my piece against them - the skills are a joke here !  This is why I’ve traveled , but even Thailand is becoming impossible , there’s so many now wanting SRS they’ve become picky like Banks/Supporn , Chettawat , etc.

Congratulations! Looks like a great result.
</p>
<p>
I am strongly considering SRS with Dr. Bank. At 1 year out, may I ask how often you need to dilate now and how long it takes each session? I read all of your post early post-op when it took an hour and I&#39;m very interested to know if the time has gone down as well as frequency.
</p>
<p>
Thanks much if you have a minute to reply.

Thank you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m pretty much at the point where I can dilate every other day, but might not quite be ready for that, though I do seem to be way behind the curve on that and plenty of people who had surgery around the same time as me have been doing every other day or even less frequently for months by this point.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately I seemed to have a particularly bad dilation experience, so we&#39;re not talking an hour at my worst. At my worst point it was taking me between 3.5 to 4 hours to reach depth (and sometimes I failed to even after that long, at which point I just gave up) and I was having to do that three times a day. Takes me around 15 to 20 minutes to get to depth now - though and there are plenty of people where it takes them 10, 5 and even less. Some basically get straight to depth as quickly as they can push the dilator in (lucky bitches lmao).

Thanks so much for sharing and I&#39;m sorry to hear your experience was so rough. 3.5-4 hours per day X 3 sounds brutal.
</p>
<p>
Getting straight to depth just pushing the dilator in sounds like winning the GRS lottery!!
</p>
<p>
On a different topic, do you have any recommendations on what kind of clothes to pack for the trip? I&#39;m guessing loose fitting is best in recovery but would be great to know what you think from your experience.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

It was absolutely brutal, but somehow I got through it lol.
</p>
<p>
Umm, depends on what your style is, but ultimately you want to prioritise comfort, plus it&#39;s a hot country. So I&#39;d suggest either dresses, or thin and loose pants.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s pretty much all I wore, though towards the end of my trip I was a bit adventurous and wore some rompers a couple of times. Of course, not recommended if they&#39;re a tight fit lol.

Umm, depends on what your style is, but ultimately you want to prioritise comfort, plus it&#39;s a hot country. So I&#39;d suggest either dresses, or thin and loose pants.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s pretty much all I wore, though towards the end of my trip I was a bit adventurous and wore some rompers a couple of times. Of course, not recommended if they&#39;re a tight fit lol.

Thank you for sharing!
</p>
<p>
From what I&#39;ve read in your posts and others it sounds like there is a lot of variability from person to person in terms of how hard recovery is. I am wondering if you noticed if older people tended to have a more difficult time or did age not seem to be a factor?
</p>
<p>
I am wondering because I am 46 years old, well under Dr. Banks age limit but still wondering what to expect.
</p>
<p>
Thanks much for any insights you may have.

Looks great! Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
If you are up for sharing, I am curious, how many times did you apply to the Suporn lottery before receiving a surgery date. I have tried three times with no luck and am just trying to get an idea of how long it has taken for others. Thanks much.

A VERY respectable (and beautiful) result. Ultimately, I&#39;d go for neat, slim bush, though. Nice work, Gal!!

Rule 9. No sexual complements.
</p>
<p>
No sexually suggestive compliments or comments that may be interpreted that way. Examples: - Nice - Daddy - Looks hot - Gorgeous
</p>
<p>
If the mods need to check your post history to see your intention then its not appropriate.
</p>
<p>
This is a surgery sub so lets keep comments clinical.
