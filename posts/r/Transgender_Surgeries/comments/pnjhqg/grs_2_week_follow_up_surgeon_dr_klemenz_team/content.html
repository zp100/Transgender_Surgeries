First week is
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/pjizdv/grs_1_week_follow_up_surgeon_dr_klemenz_team/">here
</a>
</p>

Pictures for week 2
<a href="https://lensdump.com/a/9npmv/?sort=date_asc&amp;page=1">here
</a>
</p>
<p>
So let&#39;s get into the 2nd week which wasn&#39;t really better then the first üòÖ
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 8
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I had problems with my poop and wasn&#39;t able to except this 1 time. So I&#39;ve got an enema. Now it works üòÖ. Movement and especially sitting is really exhausting.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 9
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now it&#39;s time to stop my targin, haven&#39;t really had much pain in the last few days and it&#39;s an opiate, so... They pulled out the clips today and I was in pain again :/ also I had circulatory problems again cause of this.  They found a wound separation at my perineum and they use lavanid to heal it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also found another way to shower and am now able to relax again.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 10
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So the lavanid is better on the right place I&#39;ve gotten compress. Also the separation is only on the surface.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 11
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The chief doctor is having a look at me on the gynecological chair this time. Also he said I just should feel the inside of my vagina by myself. And oh girl that&#39;s so fucking great, especially when playing with the muscles there.  But back to negative things. Wound separation is strongly pronounced. The strings that were still in there were removed.  Also my vagina might have healing problems, so I get filled up again.  Remove of catheter and dilation are postponed. Changes of healing are good but it will take way longer.
</p>
<p>
A direct 2nd surgery might be needed.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 12
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since now i have to get on the gynecological chair daily (I haven&#39;t even had a free day since day 5). In addition to wound separation they now found pus inside my vagina. (Totally great news. Not) And Ive been filled up again.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 13
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Wound separation is getting bigger, but there is already new skin there which indicates that it heals. And I&#39;ve got a smear test cause of the pus.  And getting filled up again. With even bigger stuff.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 14
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My surgeon saw my on the gynecological chair the first time. He removed the catheter cause I was in slight pain while he was using the vaginal mirror to open up my vagina.  My urine is getting test cause it also might be infected.  But he saw something. At the very end were no one has ever looked there was a hematoma, that&#39;s now open. Also there was never douched, while I was on the chair, and to make it worse. The filling again and again might have been worsened the problem.  No I am getting antibiotics and I shall finger myself more üòê (not His direct words but close enough).
</p>
<p>
Also today I was the first time on the toilet without a catheter and it kinda worked. After 3 times they made an ultrasound examination of my bladder and yay only 47ml left inside. So bye bye catheter. üéâ
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps again and if you have any questions don&#39;t hesitate to ask :3

She looks kind of angry with all this happening.
</p>
<p>
Is more swollen on the sides or do you think is it just fluid ?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m concerned a lot because by 10-14 days it is normally flat or almost all flat and pink in all the results I have ever seen in person and in photographs (including mine).

BTW - My family originally came from Lorraine about 5km from the border near Saarlouis.

It&#39;s fluid or artealst doctors are saying this üòÖ
</p>
<p>
Wow really? From what I&#39;ve seen they are flat after 1-2 month, if lucky :o maybe it depends on technique? Cause this was not a classic PI, but also not a PPT nor colon.

Can&#39;t say that any surgeon in Germany uses this
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s nowhere specified so I can&#39;t denied nor affirm it

Okay. Thanks. I&#39;ve been trying to understand this technique vs PPT that provides you some level of lubricant.
</p>
<p>
You mentioned being in the hospital for 4 weeks. Was that due to an unexpected complication?
</p>
<p>
BTW, your newly renovated genitalia is beautiful.

2-3 weeks is normal in Germany (we don&#39;t stay in a motel but in a hospital for the full duration, not like in the US)
</p>
<p>
I had the complication i mentioned in this thread and the first one and cause of that i was there for 4 weeks, yes it was an unexpected complication but one that happens more often then ppl might assume and is 100% on the individual body
</p>
<p>
Thanks :3

Way better especially on the wound separation part. It&#39;s healing good. Problem now is that I also have a problem at the top of my vagina, but this might be just slow healing. Don&#39;t know much about that now cause it was discovered just 2 days ago. Maybe I know more tomorrow and would include it in my 3 weeks post op thread
</p>
<p>
Swelling is kinda going down sensation is definitely there and yeah.
