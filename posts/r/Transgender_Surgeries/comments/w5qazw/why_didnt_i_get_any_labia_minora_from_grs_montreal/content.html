You can report chasers to the admins as harassment or gender based hate as appropriate, and possibly get them banned from the site.

I didn’t get any either. I don’t even know anyone that has gotten any from them on their first surgery unfortunately. &amp; same on the hair part. One of my lips is completely covered in hair &amp; the other one is bare LMAO

This is very common from my understanding in Montreal. It&#39;s to short a surgery but done right it can be all done in 1 surgery that&#39;s why I went to Thailand to have it done. Hope everything works out.

A lot of people don&#39;t seem to understand that the 2hr estimate Montréal strives for has little to do with the expected outcome. That doesn&#39;t mean they are deliberately doing shoddy work, they just have a different infrastructure for any given surgery than some places. For gcs at Montreal there are three actual surgeons in the room doing different tasks simultaneously. The lead (brassard or Belanger) is right there in front of you doing excisional work, then the final grafting and closure, someone else is doing debridement/cautery and helping with retractors, tools, etc and another is working on the graft tissue doing the hair cauterizing. That&#39;s how they make it all happen fast. The goal there is to reduce time spent under anaesthesia and limit your risk of compartment syndrome from lying immobilized on the table. They also really want you to move as soon and as much as possible to get your blood moving. It&#39;s to keep you safe. The added benefit is that they can do it five times per day for each surgeon/surgical team. They recognize that many people wait their whole lives for this and their needs are urgent so of course they would want to design a procedure that maximizes efficiency. They definitely care.

Many single-stage vaginoplasties don&#39;t result in any or significant inner labia; a second procedure is often required to create or enhance their appearance.
</p>
<p>
Not as cis-women have significant inner labia either, variation is wide.

Older first stage techniques didn&#39;t include urethral spatulation, or create a hood. That&#39;s why second stage was recommended. When I say old i mean prior to the early 2000s, before which &#34;single stage&#34; wasn&#39;t really available because the general expectation was a two stage process.

It may be an option to discuss a revision with them.
</p>
<p>
And if you are from Canada,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/country_specific/index#wiki_canada" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
might be some local resources and it may be an idea to talk with a few others about what they did.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise a number of other surgeons may also do revisions,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
for example was a discussion. It may be an idea to make a few photos and ask a few surgeons in case.
