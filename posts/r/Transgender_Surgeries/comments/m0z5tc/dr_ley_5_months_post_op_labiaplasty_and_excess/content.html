Ok thank you for speaking up about excess erectile tissue, I read your previous posts and you helped me put words to the sensation I&#39;ve been feeling since having GCS two years ago. When I&#39;m turned on things swell up down there to an uncomfortable degree and the swelling partially blocks the vaginal canal. I am definitely curious now about a possible revision, and might also pursue some fat grafting to my outer labia as well. Thank you so much for posting and sharing your experience!

I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome so my skin is funky in the way it heals.

Being turned on doesn’t feel uncomfortable anymore, in fact it feels more pleasurable???

The labia fusion doesn’t really bother me or my partner, it is something I will eventually get fixed but I am in no rush.

I saw your previous posts and you and I had some of the same issues of excessive erectile tissue left inside and I also have some around my clitoris....my clit needs to be moved more outward and one of your previous pics your labia majora looked like an empty scrotum sack (mine does as well) I will be getting it all fixed by Marci Bowers next summer. Your results are beautiful

Seeing there&#39;s not many choices in AZ, would you still recommend this surgeon, despite complications?

I would. Although Dr. Ley is moving to San Francisco, I had a friend who saw also went to the meltzer clinic. She actually had Meltzer do the surgery on her and she had no complications and fantastic results. Probably helped that she didn’t have a connective tissue disorder.

<p>
I have a more recent post of a labia revision I posted last night you can take a look at too.
