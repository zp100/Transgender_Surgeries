My wife is looking into US SRS surgeons and McGinn seems to be at the top as far as aesthetics go. One thing we haven‚Äôt been able to suss out is whether or not her vaginas do any self-lubricating at all. If you‚Äôve had SRS with her, do you always need tons of lube?
</p>
<p>
Also how is sensation - does she tend to leave any ‚Äúdead‚Äù spots that never regain sensation even after years of recovery? There doesn‚Äôt seem to be much info available even on the wiki of these kinds of issues with her. Any input is welcome!! üôè

Thank you, that‚Äôs very helpful! I have two questions.
</p>
<p>
1) Why did you choose McGinn over other surgeons? Was it for purely practical reasons (location, cost, waitlist time, etc) or was there something about her (technique, results, etc) that made her stand out from other surgeons for you? And if it WAS a practical decision, if all conditions had been ideal for you to go to anyone anywhere in the US, would you have gone to someone else instead? We‚Äôre trying to compare McGinn, Bowers, and Bluebond, for context.
</p>
<p>
2) Do you feel like you‚Äôve received enough/quality help from McGinn (or her team) with any issues or questions post-surgery? I‚Äôve read some stories about surgeons going MIA after the surgery, even when people experienced complications, and I can‚Äôt imagine a scarier thing than not being able to get ahold of your doctor after such an invasive surgery D:

Seconding that Mt Sinai is hard to deal with and impersonal.  I gave up on Avanessian for the same reason.

I can vouch for the GAIA Guest House and the Papillon Center staff. PA Krystal is one of my Earthbound Angels‚ù£Ô∏è I consulted w/Dr. McGinn for BA and Tracheal Shave. Due to being retired military, I am familiar w/and like her ‚Äúno nonsense‚Äù approach. She has a good sense of humor as well, as demonstrated by walking in and the resulting exchange of comments that took place while Krystal was administering my lidocaine injections in preparation for genital electrolysis. Btw, Dr. McGinn offers a military discount to Veterans for her surgery services‚ù£Ô∏è

Almost two years out here. (Went with McGinn December 2018)
</p>
<p>
Sensation is perfectly fine, no issues there.
</p>
<p>
Self-lubrication; yes, its there, but probably not enough to go without lube during penetrative sex.
</p>
<p>
No regrets though, would recommend.

Same two questions for you, if you‚Äôre willing to answer! :)
</p>
<p>
1) Why did you choose McGinn over other surgeons? Was it for purely practical reasons (location, cost, waitlist time, etc) or was there something about her (technique, results, etc) that made her stand out from other surgeons for you?

I didn&#39;t have any complications beyond very minor granulation, (so I can&#39;t speak to that) but I had a 3 month, 6 month, and 1 year follow up. They also made it clear that I could reach out to them if I had any issues.
</p>
<p>
McGinn has a reputation for poor bedside manner, I asked her about it directly and she is aware of it and can see why people would feel that way. Her support staff and PAs are wonderful in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
I picked her largely off of reputation and results I had seen. I hadn&#39;t seen much from Blueblood at the time, but I would have been just as willing to go with her had I known more about her when I first setup my appointment.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in the southeast and I wasn&#39;t happy with any surgeons nearby so McGinn was definitely out of the way for me.

I‚Äôm five weeks to go with Dr. McGinn. Thanks so much for all the information. I‚Äôm only slightly anxious. Mostly just can‚Äôt wait.
