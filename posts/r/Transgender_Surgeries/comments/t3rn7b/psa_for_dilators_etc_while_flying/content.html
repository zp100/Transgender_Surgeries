Call TSA Cares ahead of time on 855-787-2227 or fill out online form at
<a href="https://tsa.gov/contact-center/form/cares">https://tsa.gov/contact-center/form/cares</a>
</p>
<p>
Give them your flight info, dilators being medically necessary etc. and they will alert the security checkpoints at airports where you need someone to have a heads up about bringing dilators etc in carry-on. Hopefully that avoids any potential trouble/embarrassment at checkpoints.
</p>
<p>
Will update this thread if IRL goes different day after tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Spoke with TSA Cares twice today and both times it was super duper sweet and courteous folks!

I&#39;ve never had a big issue with this. All that happens is that it goes through the machine, they pull it aside, pull one out and go &#34;Oh. I see.&#34; before letting you go on your merry way. That&#39;s only been in America and Korea so far for me too, no issues anywhere else.

Which is why I started taking my dilators out of my luggage and and placing them on top. If they  want to inspect them, they don&#39;t have to go through my whole bag. I don&#39;t give a crap if they want to see my dilators, I just don&#39;t want to have to stand there for ten minutes while they divert my carry-on for hand inspection.

Yeah, I mean, to their preception, I look just like a normal person traveling. I&#39;m not in a uniform or flashing my badge or anything.

Maybe you should start doing that, flash the badge. They work below you technically cause without you, they don’t have a job!! Just because we work there and not in uniform doesn’t mean we can’t use our ID Badge to get through quickly.

I worked for the cruise line before and used my crew badge everywhere. An used my TWIC Card through the TSA checkpoint. Just in case which should help indefinitely, get yourself a TSA Precheck &amp; Global Entry card!! It literally pays it self over 5 years!! Speed Through Security for the Next 5 years. An especially your working as an employee, look to see what discount you may get. Even if no discount, it’s still worth it traveling all over the world.

I fly multiple times a month, and have completely gotten over any embarrassment of them getting flagged.  I&#39;m way more concerned about passing through security quickly and getting to the lounge so I can start knocking back French 74s.  This is what I do, but again, this is geared towards getting through security quickly with as little hassle as possible.  If you&#39;re deathly afraid of people handling your vagina widening sticks, try something else.
</p>
<p>
I never check bags, I always carry on or personal item, and my dilators go in one of the mesh pouches on the
<em>
outside
</em>
of my backpack.  This makes it so when they inevitably get flagged, which has been about 70% of the time, they don&#39;t have to go digging to fish them out, they can just pull them out of the mesh pouch.  My last conversation went like this.
</p>
<p>
Me:  &#34;Those will be in the outside pouch, I try to make it easy for you guys because they get flagged so often&#34;
</p>
<p>
TSA:  &#34;Thank you.&#34;
<em>
pulls one out
</em>
&#34;What are these?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Me:
<em>
completely straight face
</em>
&#34;They are medical dildos&#34;
</p>
<p>
TSA:  &#34;Oh...&#34;
<em>
slides them back in the soulcource pouch and puts the pouch back in the mesh bag.
</em>
&#34;Have a nice day.&#34;
</p>
<p>
While they can notify their employees that someone with dilators will be coming through, employees don&#39;t know what the fuck a dilator looks like, so I&#39;ve found they flag them anyways.   I say let them look and get me on my merry way.

Because, yeah dilators are clearly a weapon... &lt;smh&gt;
</p>
<p>
<em>
&#34;Do exactly as I tell you, because I have a set of dilators and I know how to use them!&#34;
