Text was removed for some reason, will copy here:
</p>
<p>
I’m 1 month after surgery, still early, but some general results are already visible, so I want to share
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Waist slimming aka Rib modification aka RibMold aka Kuzdaev’s waist slimming method
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is relatively new surgery, originated in russia, but now performed in other places. Idea is simple, doctor makes few cuts on floating ribs, bend them in and after surgery patient wears corset to make ribs heal in this bent state to make waist slimmer
</p>
<p>
Surgery is simple, healing is brutal - you wear corset for 3 months 24/7, shower allowed for 5 minutes once in 10 days. Corset is TIGHT - I originally had 90 cm waist (stable through weight gain/loss), my corset is now closed to 66-68 cm and doctor wants to keep pushing as much as possibleRight now without corset my waist is ~78 cm. It won’t stay that slim, there is always a rollback after few weeks without corset. It may get back +2 cm, it maybe +8cm (maximum in my doctors practice), depends on a person. But it looks very different now and I hope to get good results after 3 moths
</p>
<p>
The change in waist on a picture is almost only from ribs, lipo in that area removed very little and hips didn’t got a lot of fat either
</p>
<p>
<strong>
BBL + lipo
</strong>
</p>
<p>
It was my second round, first one was very conservative and mostly from the back, so I wasn’t very happy with results. I’m almost 40 now and for most of my life I struggled with belly fat, previous surgeon told me he don’t want to touch it because it will make muscles visible (???) and I thought he knows what he’s doing, buuuut… After 2 more years I really wanted to get rid of it
</p>
<p>
This time dr was experienced in liposculpture and didn’t just removed the fat, but made whole area look better. Very happy with the results so far, but still swollen and want to lose some weight, so hope that final results would be even better
</p>
<p>
He also removed fat from the hands and the tights, but here they’re not visible as I press them against the body and they look bigger then they are
</p>
<p>
Previous BBL was mostly on hips, this time it’s more about projection and fixing previous flows. Had no time to make good pictures and there is still time for ‘fluffing’ stage to kick in, but I think I will get desired results, it looks rounder and fuller
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
First days of recovery were brutal, I thought I will give up on waist, closing corset on lipoed torso is no fun, and doctor who’s coming everyday to close it 2-4cm more is like a nightmare. Few nights I wasn’t able to sleep, if not daily visits and encouragement from dr and his assistant - not sure how I would keep up. You also can’t sit because of BBL and it’s really uncomfortable to sit on BBL pillow in a corset, so everything sucks 24/7 for the first 2 weeks before you get used to corset
</p>
<p>
Now it still not fun, but at least no pain, body got used to corset, standing table helps a lot and I figured out positions to sleep comfortable. 2 more weeks I can sit, 2 more months to corset free
</p>
<p>
About corsets, they ask to buy special corsets from people who do them for this surgery, but it’s actually pretty regular corsets as people on
<a href="/r/corsets">r/corsets</a>
wear. Dr said he won’t take responsibility for result in different corsets and I for sure won’t buy ready to wear corsets for this surgery, but I think in some cases they might work better. Corsets their tailor made is hard and solid, so 1. You don’t want to wear them in a summer or anything warmer than +18C, 2. I saw people complain that they might be too rough and uncomfortable, and other corsets are better. Don’t know, I got used to mine and happy I did surgery in winter

Thank you! Not many of the girls post their body contouring experiences. You love great! How did you feel waking up from surgery, did they give you medication immediately or did you have to wait?

I think always after surgery you have some painkillers and for 2 days I was in hospital I had IV with medications. So first days are not painful, just groggy and uncomfortable

It&#39;s a perfect storm...
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t sit because of BBL, so swollen legs and discomfort working or even watching something for a long time. And corset restricts mobility, so you can&#39;t lie comfortably. Faja + corset are warm, so walking or just being on sun sucks. Corset is also tight, so it rubs the skin or leads to bruises. It&#39;s not terrible, but makes life harder
</p>
<p>
At the same time, without corset ribs hurt. For this corset is awesome, very good support

Thank you for the post. I have this surgery scheduled in SF in May, so it&#39;s coming up soon. Frankly I&#39;m nervous about the recovery.

Good luck. If you have some one with you it may help, closing corset alone after surgery is hard

Agree, I know another doll who had a botched bbl by aslani, and if I remember he threatened her so she wasn’t able to like speak out. Anyway she ended up needing to get another 2 rounds because the first bbl was uneven etc

I’m surprised this didn’t get more attention. It’s one of those surgeries many of us are interested in yet afraid to get. I really appreciate you making such an in depth and informative post about it! I’m currently looking into this procedure and this was probably the most helpful post I’ve seen thus far.

Thank you. While researching I also seen that there is no information in English about this surgery, so I decided to show result and to write all I know
</p>
<p>
I will do another post in May, after I remove the corset

This time it was less painful and I got more painkillers I think. IMO, lipo is not that bad. First days sucks like all traumas, but it passes fast and you left with just soreness
</p>
<p>
Also this time they were very into physiotherapy and I had all kinds of laser and ultrasound treatments, so maybe this also helped
