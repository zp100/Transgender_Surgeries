Title. I just hit my one month mark and I&#39;m pretty much completely numb everywhere down there.. Getting kind of worried.
</p>
<p>
Any insight?

Up to a year
</p>
<p>
Healing goes differently for each person.  Your surgeon would have discussed expectations in the consultation.
</p>
<p>
One month is very early.

I see. Is this something you personally experienced? Or are you just telling me what the book says?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been told this &#34;healing takes up to a year&#34; thing a lot, but every time I ask, people have had at least
<em>
some
</em>
feeling
<em>
somewhere
</em>
by now. I have nothing.
</p>
<p>
I knew loss of feeling and sexual function would be a risk, but I&#39;m just covering my bases and starting to prepare for that possibility.

At a month, I&#39;m not surprised.  Two? See your doctor.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I had ffs and remember feeling coming back quickly in some parts, and being completely numb in others.  Usually where I had significant swelling.

I had surgery in early June (2018) and the feeling didn&#39;t really start to come back much until the end of August. No need to panic just yet.
</p>
<p>
I was getting random twinges of feeling and sharp pain throughout most of the summer months. It also took forever for my bruises to go away. I think the whole area was purple for like 3-4 weeks.

I have no bruising left, no blood anywhere in the vagina, no smell coming from either my scars or the inside, and my incisions have healed already to the point that the new skin is pink. That&#39;s why I&#39;m so worried. If everything is going so well, why don&#39;t I have any feeling whatsoever? :(

Everyone is different. I&#39;d say that if you&#39;re still not feeling anything in another week or two you should talk to your doctor. You should have a follow-up around this time anyway. I think I had them post op at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.

If it&#39;s any consulation, I was fully healed and around 7 months into recovery before I had my first orgasm, and I had little to no feeling prior and the feeling I did have tended to be painful and oversensitive.  Around a year later though, I can say sensation has returned fully.  I&#39;ve read stories of individuals reporting it sometimes takes years to get to that point.
</p>
<p>
The nerves in that area take a ridiculously long time to reconnect fully, for some it&#39;s longer than others, but I wouldn&#39;t panic.  What you&#39;re experiencing is very normal, I&#39;d give it time and reach out to your surgeon if it becomes too concerning in the future.

How did you manage the pent up sexual frustration in the meanwhile? I&#39;m having a hard time.

It was one of the most difficult things I have ever experienced, I&#39;m not going to lie to you it was very depressing for me for a long while.
</p>
<p>
However, as cliche as it sounds, distracting my mind from sun up to sun down helped a lot - I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s quite healthy or recommendable but that&#39;s what I did. Gaming, being around friends and my partner, making art, hiking, working, so on and so forth. I also had a really great therapist at the time, and that helped immensely.
</p>
<p>
I also didn&#39;t stop exploring myself sexually at all during that time either. Even if there wasn&#39;t much sensation, even if it was discouraging and painful at times, I didn&#39;t give up and honestly that was very much worth it in the end. Exposing my body to it&#39;s new normal really helped get it back in order, and when the nerves fully healed everything just kind of fell into place.

I hope that I can feel something soon. Like I said, I&#39;m worried that I don&#39;t even feel pain. At least if i felt pain I&#39;d know that I wasn&#39;t ready, but as it is.. How can I touch anything down there if I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to completely screw everything up?

Definitely ask your surgeon or their team if it&#39;s okay to explore! I waited three months to start exploring, when I was cleared to do so around month one - which in hindsight might&#39;ve delayed my healing even further.
</p>
<p>
Again, being numb, with little to
<em>
no
</em>
sensation at all around where you&#39;re at in healing rings as being normal to me - but double checking with your surgeon is never bad. I just wouldn&#39;t feel too discouraged yet, because you&#39;re only a month in, and you honestly have
<em>
so
</em>
much healing ahead of you.

By so much healing, you mean only nerve healing and the rest of the edema, right?

Yep! It&#39;ll take a long while for that to fully relieve (around a year or so) your main components of healing, like involving your sutures, healing of the internal grafts, etc. should be well underway by this point though (as ya already described).
</p>
<p>
It&#39;ll honestly probably be about 6 months - 1 year before the final aesthetic, and functional aspects will be fully healed, with some people even reporting longer than that.

You might try a low dose of antiandrogens.

Yeah, that might be something worth considering asking your doctor about. I forgot to mention that my doctor prescribed amitriptyline (it basically is a medicine that helps with overactive nerves) and that helped immensely too with libido/sexual frustration.

I know this post is a bit old now. Hopefully your recovery is going well.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t remember exactly how long it took for me but it was long enough to start becoming a bit scary. I&#39;m fine now and everything is working properly.
</p>
<p>
I just wanted to drop a message to say that it&#39;s good to keep trying. Even if it feels like you&#39;re getting nowhere, stimulating the nerves can help in their regeneration. Even once I had sensation it took a while longer to be able to reach orgasm and I was really scared I&#39;d never heal properly.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s all okay now though, I hope things work out the same for you.

Thank you so much. I&#39;ve developed a lot in these past few weeks, and I was even able to orgasm. However, I still have zero feeling on the labia. I don&#39;t expect to ever get it back, especially when I consider that my BA healed the exact same way. I guess I&#39;m just predisposed to healing poorly in that regard.

So glad to hear you&#39;ve had such an important gain since you first posted. You never know honestly, your body might still surprise you. I had numb triangles from just below nipples down to the incisions on my BA that lasted for a really long time, I want to say possibly even a couple of years.. and I just grew to accept that&#39;s how things were. At some point the sensation came back.
</p>
<p>
Same with weird nerve stuff after a nose job, there was a patch of skin on my bridge that if I touched it felt like it was under my eye. Thought that was a quirk I&#39;d have forever and now I don&#39;t even know when it finally fixed itself.
</p>
<p>
A couple years back I accidentally cut through all the nerves and tendons in a finger and had to get it all put back together and that&#39;s still not as sensitive as it used to be but you never know. Might surprise me one day. lol
</p>
<p>
All the best with the rest of your recovery. :)
