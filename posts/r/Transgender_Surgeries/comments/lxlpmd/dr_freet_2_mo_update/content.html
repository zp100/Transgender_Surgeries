So at 2 months,  I&#39;m in a decent place.
</p>
<p>
Fistula exam turned up a small fistula, that was easily dealt with in office. I had 2 stitches by my clit that had refused to dissolve, that got removed finally. Those things felt like needles digging into her! I had minor graft rejection, which is healing on its own. Neuropathy in the scars is an issue, it occasionally feels like a burn or cut, but I&#39;m on medicine for that. My leg is still suffering from nerve pain as well, though that&#39;s mostly just me. Nerve pain can take months to dissipate... My only small complaint is, the Doc nicked my clit with the edge of the removal tool, and caused it to bleed a little. And even then it was a complete accident, as mine is slightly larger than he&#39;s used to working with.  Over all, I&#39;d still give him 10/10. He&#39;s very warm, and sweet. The only reason I came back to see him,  was because he wanted to make sure that the pain was just normal nerve regeneration, and nothing more. :)

I got to my 3 month check up on Tuesday. Will be great to have the surgeon looking at things up close and not just via pictures and a video check in.
