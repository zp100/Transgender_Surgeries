Question for other women and amab-nb who&#39;ve had bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
My most comfortable sized trusty dilator is a little worn, after a year of use, and I replaced it with one that&#39;s 0.13&#34; larger diameter. Close enough to be comfortable-ish the first couple of times, but after a week I&#39;m a bit sore...
</p>
<p>
Like it says in the title, what was your experience with sizing up?

Totally curious how a dilator gets â€˜a little wornâ€™ lol. Mine are made from some kind of indestructible high density plastic that would probably break the floor if I dropped it, not the dilator. I canâ€™t imagine it ever wearing out. Archeologists will be digging these things up in a thousand years time and theyâ€™ll still be good as new ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
</p>
<p>
Oh, and on a serious note when I sized up from green to orange I dilated with the smaller one first for 10 minutes or so and then 15 with orange. Now Iâ€™m just on the bigger one without issue.

Mine are clear Lexan plastic from abt. 1997. Round tips with no taper. Largest is 1.5&#34; exactly.
</p>
<p>
Even as hard as they are though, they can
<em>
clack
</em>
together and heat unevenly when washed in hot water and develop internal cracks in any direction, a little like flaws in diamonds.
</p>
<p>
I also have the largest one from SoulSource (all are tapered about the last inch) and about 1/64&#34; less in diameter (though advertised as 1.5 inch). It is Trumpian Orange.
</p>
<p>
I stopped dilating for a long time and the taper on this SoulslSource helped me overcome the last &#34;level up&#34; to largest Lexan again. The abdominal muscle would not stretch otherwise.
</p>
<p>
After I healed completely &amp; with regular use only the 2 largest are usually needed.

Ha! It&#39;s silicone with a pointy-ish tip. All that washing eventually made the tip a little pitted, which makes it more difficult to keep sanitary.

I use a liquid anti-bacterial soap on my Lexan an SoulSource dilators. You make your cleanser sound like Comet or Ajax or is your dilater a soft silicone ?

Just a question for someone with the time to answer, what&#39;s a dilator? I&#39;m afab so I&#39;mma end up going a bit of the opposite way. (only if anyone is cool with answering btw, bottom surgery is quite the personal business and I don&#39;t wanna be an asshole)

Itâ€™s basically a stiff, smooth dildo. Theyâ€™re frequently hard plastic, but can be rubbery. After the neovagina is formed the surrounding tissue tries to contract, so we have to stick the dilator in and leave it there for a while to stretch the area out. Right after surgery you end up dilating 4 times a day, and eventually it drops to once a week or so, but you have to do it forever or the neovagina will shrink.
</p>
<p>
Since it is stretching, you start with a smaller one and work your way up. Personally Iâ€™m a little over a year out and my dilation routine involves 3-4 sizes, takes about an hour and a half, and I do it every other day, but I have very tight muscles and my impression from other women is that thatâ€™s rare. My partner only uses the largest size for 20-30 minutes, every 4-5 days. If youâ€™re having regular sex, that can take the place of dilation.

Have you tried any pelvic floor therapy? It sounds counterintuitive that strengthening your pelvic floor would help make your vaginal muscles less tight, but it does. My surgeon recommended it and I started around 6 months post op. It helped tremendously!

I have, and it helped. I am able to get up to the #4 Soul Source dilator now, as long as I work up to it. Right after surgery I was having trouble with one about the size of the #P2 and actually had an episode where I clamped down on that so hard that the pain left me shaking for over an hour afterwards. I was improving pretty steadily until roughly 6 months out, but I had a complication and between that and general pandemic stress, Iâ€™m still not back to where I was.

Every month I would develop a cyst just below the vaginal opening. Once it appeared it would grow for about a week, until it was about the size of the end of a pinky, then burst. It was painful, I had to wear pads afterwards, and one time it made my entire groin swell up.  Happened every month for 9 months straight, but the timing wasnâ€™t consistent enough to get in to see the surgeon before it blew. I eventually went in a few days afterwards while it was still a gaping hole and she was able to cut it out, but it did it twice more, then just stopped and hasnâ€™t come back.
</p>
<p>
I was having trouble with spraying urine too, so I had a revision surgery a year after my original, but the cyst wasnâ€™t visible at that point so the surgeon just trimmed the urethral opening a bit to redirect things and left the rest alone.
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s a shame. I was happy with the aesthetics and functionality after the first surgery healed, but between all the extra scar tissue and the revision, it looks worse and the entrance is a lot smaller and tighter now.
</p>
<p>
I did a bit more physical therapy, but havenâ€™t stuck with it.  Largely still at the same place I was a year ago: working up through 4 dilators over an hour or so every 2-3 days.
</p>
<p>
I had a breast augmentation at the same time as my first surgery, and while it looks decent, I completely lost sensation in my chest and it never came back.  The combination has left me pretty hung up when it comes to sex, and Iâ€™ve shelved plans for FFS, though the pandemic contributed to that too. All in all itâ€™s been a very mixed bag. It did help my dysphoria though, so itâ€™s not all bad.

Dear not a Wazoo,
</p>
<p>
It is something to help make a small hole stretch to be a larger hole. A gynecological speculum is a levered example as are post GRS solid wands (some with rounded ends only and others also with a taper from one diameter to a larger one - such as from SoulSource).
