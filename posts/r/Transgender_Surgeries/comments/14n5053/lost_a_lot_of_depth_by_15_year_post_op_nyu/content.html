Do the smaller dilators go in further? I don’t even use orange cause I bleed from it and haven’t needed bigger than green for sexual things and it doesn’t go in that far without insane pain but I have my original depth with green and below.
</p>
<p>
I’ve never had a need to fit anything bigger than green so I really cba at this point.
</p>
<p>
There is a way to get orange to go to full depth for me if I use a Nora vibrator for like 20-30 minutes since the tips a bit bigger than green (I think the tips even slightly bigger than the tip of orange but it’s squishy) and it rotates which basically is like super dilation and makes everything very open  but it’s not worth the hassle.
</p>
<p>
I’m surprised vibrators that rotate don’t get mentioned here more since it basically feels like cheating to get more depth and width temporarily but 🤷🏻‍♀️
</p>
<p>
Edit: for anyone curious I just measured the circumference of the widest part of the tip of the Nora is roughly as wide as the soul source orange but its silicone so it’s squishy and it can rotate the widest part in a circular motion. For depth it’s the same size as to the 5th dot on orange

I&#39;m so sorry for your loss. Hope it gets better as you keep dilating more to regain depth.

I have about the same amount of depth as you and it’s been causing a lot of depression and feeling defeated at 1 year post op.  My doc says I am still within average depth, though. I’ve been having a lot of trouble with dealing with fact that even dilating perfectly and doing everything “right” I still lost a good amount of depth.  I really don’t want to do another surgery and risk more complications , and since I had PPT I can really only try colon.
</p>
<p>
I was able to have really good satisfying, vaginal intercourse, really for the first time yesterday with someone who was really well endowed and having about 4 inches of depth really wasn’t as limiting as I thought before.  It has really lifted my spirits and made me realize that your partner matters, and trying with the right person is important to really explore and have a better sexual experience.  Surprisingly, we were able to get more than 4 inches in because when I was really aroused and more stretchy.  The best angle in a position was crucial to having a better experience.
</p>
<p>
I just wanted to share my thoughts in hopes that it helps you because I’ve been struggling dealing with similar issues.  I still wish I had more depth and didn’t lose that one and a half inch,  but I am actually, surprisingly content since yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I just wanted to add that I think it’s not talked about enough that if you still dilate perfectly, you still might lose depth from healing and how everyone’s body is a little different.  I researched everything but I just assumed if I dilate and follow the surgeons guidelines then there should be no reason to consider losing depth. I also think it’s more common to lose 1-2 inches of depth despite regular dilating then it seems to be.

Some days are easier than others, it gets overwhelming, thinking about the rest of your life, like this, which I can dwell in sometimes. I am hoping in the future, there might be some alternative procedures to increase depth. I just learned about a  new technique called Kereciticis, using amniotic cells of fish(tilapia skin) that is being done only at standford or OSHU atm for a graft, which sounds promising and cool, so something to look at.
</p>
<p>
Try not to be too hard on yourself, easier said than done I’m sure. I focus on the positives, it’s not ideal, but it’s working if I put in the effort, looks good and functions well for the most part.  The hardest part is dilation. It’s always a reminder and just a pita to do everyday for me. I also have a mental block with feeling sexy about my vagina cause it’s been so clinical with taking care of it. But every time I see myself in the mirror, I’m still so happy to have it and feel euphoria, so I thank that counts a lot for me.  Sending positive vibes and hugs 😊.

umm that&#39;s a lot of depth?  I can&#39;t get to the first dot on purple and my surgeon won&#39;t revise because I meet their standards of acceptability

This is not a lot of depth for a typical NYU result. If she can’t get purple in all the way chances are she’ll need a revision to fix it.
