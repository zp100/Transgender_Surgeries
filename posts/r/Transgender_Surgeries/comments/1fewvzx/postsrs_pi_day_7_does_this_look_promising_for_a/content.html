Yeah, didn&#39;t get to meet her face to face unfortunately. I guess one of the things of having it covered by public Healthcare is not getting the same treatment as you would privately....
</p>
<p>
EDIT: my mom just told me when she&#39;d been get called by the surgeon she was told she had visited me, and it is true many medics have visited me, so I guess I just didn&#39;t recognize her, so many faces in so little timeðŸ˜©

.. such a personal, and invasive surgery and you don&#39;t even gat to speak to the person. That is wild.
</p>
<p>

Yes, but only through one of their study publications on the internet, and it&#39;s pictures of the immediate result at the end of the surgery... Otherwise there was no other way for me to see results. I could only trust in my country&#39;s healthcare, which is pretty nice.

true, apparently they visited me the day after the surgery in the morning, like the whole team, and apparently I was so drugged I just didn&#39;t open my eyes, and I don&#39;t remember shit
