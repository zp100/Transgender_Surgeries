I&#39;m kinda wondering how you mean resonance when you say this, as its worth noting resonance is a ubiquitous thing, sorta like pitch resonance could be described as high or low
</p>
<p>
in your post you mentioned that things like gasping for air is when you notice it especially
</p>
<p>
when we are gasping for air we are likely opening up space in the throat, assuming this is like a voiceless gasp? it would definitely be a resonance thing audio example
<a href="https://voca.ro/1eDV2sTTp0uv" rel="nofollow">https://voca.ro/1eDV2sTTp0uv</a>
but yeah I went into it a bit more in this clip so maybe this could help?

Yea listening to the differences in these clips both the breathing and the talking ones it strikes me as resonance related differences
</p>
<p>
For what it&#39;s worth your running breathing example sounds at &#34;worst&#34; androgynous to me

Almost all VFS do not address reonance, are they going to decrease volume in your sinuses, mouth, tongue size, diameter of your esophagel tube, decrease resonance from the chest, usually VFS does not do anything for these structures.   I did the research also, I had Dr. Kim do the surgery (that is all he does vocal) not a surgeon that adds it as an adjunct to the many other surgeries they do.He does work on a vast majority of Asian singers.   I was out of his normal age range (&gt;60yrs old), went from 169HZ to 230HZ and I am still healing and my pitch is increasing as the botox is wearing off..   My voice could still pass before, now definetly no question.   So, if your surgeon says they are changing resonances, it would only be the bare minimum if any.  Best to not get too invasive doing anything to the vocal cords.  I found no one in the US that could compare to Dr. Kim  PS Involuntary sounds, coughing, sneezing sounds more feminine now also.

VFS should be the last surgery as intubation can damage your vfs results.

You are lucky enough that a pitch altering procedure will possibly benefit you. Transfeminine folks who have androgynous voices or better seem to benefit from VFS than suffer complications from them. I had/have a very deep and borderline bass voice, and one of the most aggressive approaches that was supposed to alter my resonance and pitch only made me voice worse. I ended up with a smoker and high pitched masculine voice that it drove me into depression for more than a year and I truly regret it. I have no volume, and I get anxious all the time when I have to talk at work or answer the phone. I have done training too and before surgery my voice was way more malleable and passed better on a good day as long as I&#39;m not stressed or forced to position my neck/torso in a way that forced my vocal tract becoming larger.
</p>
<p>
I hope a conservative procedure won&#39;t cause complications. I didn&#39;t need VFS and still had it, and you probably don&#39;t either. I wish you the best if you still decide to proceed with surgery. My voice was already feminine enough that they asked me if I was really sure with proceeding at the pre op appointment. And it was so bad that at the follow up appointment even the surgeon gave up on me. After going through all this and ultimately being stuck with a broken voice, I really feel like someone that ate healthy and exercised, but died from a heart attack anyway.

Hi, I know you went to FT for ffs but do you know the names of the surgeons who worked on your forehead and nose please? Do you happen to have a full face pic post op or jaw chin before and after pics? Are you still very happy or would you change anything?

Is this for SRS?
</p>
<p>
It shouldn’t matter, but it really depends in what the surgeon says. The new WPATH Standards of Care 8 say you don’t need to stop, but not all surgeons will follow it.
</p>
<p>
If you’re on oral or transdermal the estrogen will be out of your blood failrly quickly, which is why you take them everyday.
</p>
<p>
If it’s VFS it’s barely even surgery and I’m surprised the surgeon cares.

It’s for vfs I’m at yeason now, having surgery in two day. Basically he explains on a video on YouTube that the larix can swell with progesterone and oestrogen, so it’s important to come off two weeks before. I’ve been off it for five days now so hopefully should be enough. I’m going for my consultation tomorrow so I’ll find out when they put a camera down my oesophagus. 🤞
