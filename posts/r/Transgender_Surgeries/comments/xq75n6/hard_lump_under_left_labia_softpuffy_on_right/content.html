I think my healing has been going OK, but my left labia is giving me concerns. Unlike the right the swelling (if that&#39;s what it is?) Has not gone down. In a photo they look symmetrical, but the right is soft and puffy (good) while the left is rock hard (bad!). My left labia is responsible for 90% of my residual discomfort right now. The skin is movable over what appears to be a solid lump of flesh that is not movable. Discomfort from this area has been increasing. I believe that this would be causing real pain if it were a haematoma, but I do seem to have a high pain threashold. The lump is towards the back, eg to the left of the vaginal entrance, at the front, both labia are soft and puffy. Discomfort increases when sitting or lying down Vs when standing up, this discomfort is a feeling of significant pressure in the area. I also note a solo stitch in this area, perhaps from laparoscopic access for the internal stitches? Maybe increased trauma this side is responsible for the lump? I have Obv asked by surgeon, but thought I would ask here too. 12 Days Post Op, Tina Rachid, Parkside, London. PI technique.

I suspect a hematoma, go see your physician.

Would that not be squishy rather than hard though? Awaiting response from gender nurse before going to GP.

yep. I had a hematoma after my surgery, and it felt rock hard. My surgeon drained it out, and I felt a lot better immediately after (the hardness stuck around a few more days).

Former army medic seconds this as most likely. I also expect that it&#39;s harmless, but I wouldn&#39;t let it go.

This sub is nice for setting expectations and all, but I wouldn&#39;t use it for medical advice. Really your surgeon is the only person who&#39;s opinion matters, here.

You look fairly new - swelling under the labia can and does feel like hard lumps. Like, really hard. Nothing looks discolored and nothing looks unusual - I had a similiar instance where my left labia got soft very quickly and my right one remained really hard (especially towards the bottom of the labia). Some consistent massaging after a bath + time has been really helpful.
</p>
<p>
You’re definitely still swollen. There’s nothing residual about your swelling yet. I’m at 16 weeks and still have a little swelling.

Thanks, that&#39;s basically what the gender nurse just told me. I&#39;ll keep an eye on it least I have a baseline photo to compare against. I&#39;ve had such an easy ride so far that maybe paranoia re it all unravelling is playing it&#39;s part! Wish I had a bath at this point. Shower does not cut it!! I am making do with a sitz bath.

Looks like I need to investigate this further! Assumed ingrown hairs would just cause a wee localised  bump! What&#39;s underneath feels rock solid though?

It might not be don&#39;t get me wrong it was just the first thing I thought when I read your post as well as the person above! Usually they feel really hard and you can sort of move the skin on top and around them but it feels like a marble underneath? Definitely worth getting checked out by a Dr but could be a freak ingrowing hair!

I second this, as a natal vulva/vagina owner I&#39;ve had ingrowing hairs cause enormous lumps, one that had to be drained professional that was around the size of one side of my labia, I have a 2cm scar from the drainage.
</p>
<p>
I do have EDS so I get ingrowing hairs more often than other people but surgical ingrowings are a possibility

Ouch! Pre trans I had one too, which was why I thought it. But I now have a home hair removal device, not a razor lol, innza D-1176 which seems to have reduced growth and thickness of the hair where I don&#39;t want it xx stay safe

I just had a labiaplasty revision. Dr. Stiller performed a fat graft into both outer labia. Now both feel like they have a hard lump in them, which I am thinking those will eventually integrate and soften up, but will take a few months to do that.
