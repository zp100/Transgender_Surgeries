Hi @ll, thanks to be accepted here. My name is Emilia and im from Germany. Age 53 yrs. joung. Just wanted to post my experience of SRS PPV in Kamol Clinic / Bangkok. I arrived here at April 10th and stay here until May 14th. 2022. I did my SRS PPV on 13th and shortly after that my entire FFS and tracheal shave. All surgeries were perfect without complications. Especially my SRS was much less pain than expected. Only 2 days of problems with gas but thats normal and no problem. My neovagina has 7 inches and is free of pain right now and im fully mobile. Many thanks to Dr. Kamol and his wonderful team. Special thanks to Darcie Silver who helped me organizing this trip at tricky Covid times and was on my side here whenever I was down or weak. Ill never forget. The nurses are angles here and I feeling perfect in this safe space. Im so happy to be reborn here and now at home in my right body. Now doing dilation 2 hrs a day and already at size 2. If anybody has questions please let me know. I went here based on a recommendatuon of a friend who was here for her SRSPPV and all Info about experience was very helpful for me. Will send out some pics of my live changing surgeries later.  ‚ù§ Emilia

Hello, do you have any further updates? I&#39;d love to see photos if you are comfortable with that.
</p>
<p>
I had an intestinal graft, which has had complications as I later went on to develop Crohn&#39;s disease. Not caused by the surgery, but because it&#39;s the same tiisue, the problems I now experience with my intestines, I&#39;m also experiencing with my vagina, so seriously considering seeing your surgeon to see if he can replace graft with graft you had.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m told PPV self-lubricates -is that ever a problem with lubricating unnecessarily? At the moment, I&#39;m not seeing a downside to it, surely there must be some pros and cons?
</p>
<p>
Thanks! üòé

Hi, hope you are well. I would ask the Doctor directly if it is possible to replace the one graft by the graft which is used in the PPV. Maybe its a chance for you for resolving the problem. At my current stand of recovery I cannot say too much about the self lubricating characteristic. As i try to be very cautious with my neovagina i use lubricating jelly for diilation. But i can say that all feels good and looks phantastic so far. Which Kind of photos do you mean. I have no problems to show pics of my facial feminization but im somewhat reluctant to post genitals on a public platform. Thats something for personal exchange. Kind regards Emilia

Yes, I&#39;m curious, but I thought that might be a bit uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
I would definitely be interested in seeing the results of your FFS procedures, though... I started hormones at 19, by which time my face had masculinised, though not as much as if I had managed to keep delaying transition until I was over 30, as my mother had begged me to, so I think I could probably benefit quite a lot from FFS.

Hi Emilia first let me say congrats and I can only imagine how happy u feel. Bravo. I‚Äôm in the middle of choosing my surgeon and I did go to meet Dr kamol. It made me a little worried about how the hospital wasn‚Äôt air conditioned well and the smell of the place. Second I wasn‚Äôt able to get much words out of the doctor and possibly due to language barriers. Third I can‚Äôt really get clear photos of before and after I mean the photos they have on the website are so old and nothing of his recent work. I‚Äôd like to know as much as possible about your experience about the results about the professionality of the team just basically about everything and also about ffs and it‚Äôs results . That‚Äôs of course if it‚Äôs not a bother to you. You must be still tired and recovering so if it‚Äôs too much I do understand. And if you can help that would be highly appreciated  Thanks üôèüèª

Hi, choosing Bangkok for surgery means chosing the hottest city of the world. Temperatures of 34¬∞c at day and 26- 28¬∞c at night are normal, so you have to live with air condition. The rooms in the hostpital and also in K Garden have separate aircondition and that works pretty well. The public areas are sometimes warmer but you stay only for short time during your presence there. I found it percect and as i am a child of the sun and the heat i liked it very much. The cleanic and the recovery hotel are kept extremely clean and the infrastructure and equipment is high end. It is much better than hospitals which i know partially from Germany. Theres no specific smell. If you cross the streets of  Bangkok you can experience the smell of the markets, and streetfood. For me i can say I love it. SRS PPV: Worked very well, more or less painless beside of 2 days gas problems. No complications. 7 inches deepness and dilation works perect  (using soze 3 now). My vagina ,ooks like a vagina of a biological woman. A little bit swolle still but getting better every day. My urologist here in GY was excited about the results. FFS: I did forehead, eyebrows, rhinoplastic, chin, jaw and adams apple reduction. Operation worked well with no complications. In comparison to SRS its more painful. Cannot do a final evaluation as it needs months until swellows are gone. But what i see until now is really nice. Language: Fluent english is very helpful if you dont speak Thai. If you are not so fit it makes sense to think about somebody who speaks english and accompanies you in the first 2 weeks. Dr. Kamol and team.  I was excited about the professionalism of the team,  i felt in best hands and that was the reason why i decided to make my FFS sponaneousely in addition. Dr. Kamol is phantastic and im so thankful for his help. If i forgot a question in a visit or it was not fully answered i received a lot of help by the nurses to get the information and also Darcie was on my side and helped me at any time. Im very happy so my report is like that. But I tink there are a few points which you should have in mind : You need some organization to enter Thailand (Thai Pass, visa if more than 30 d) and your travel is subject to Corona rules. Aftercare is an issue, because the PPV is not done by many clinics. So in case of complications you have to go vack agsan. Health care insurance might make problems in taking over the costs. Now, 51 days after my surgery i can say, it was the best decision of my life. Hope that helps. Please let me know if you need more info .Emilia
