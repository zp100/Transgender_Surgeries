I may post my results eventually, but they won&#39;t be included in this post, unfortunately. I want to thank everyone who has shared results, though!
</p>
<p>
Also, this account is meant to be private and anonymous in case I ever do post my results. If you&#39;ve met me in Thailand you&#39;ll probably know who I am, so please keep my identity to yourself in the comments. You&#39;ve probably already seen my results lol.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve copied most of the checklist for surgery posts from the wiki, and will be adding any extra details I think are relevant.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Why did you choose Dr. Bank?
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
After exploring almost the entire wiki, this subreddit, and anywhere else on the internet that I could find information, I found that the Suporn clinic produced aesthetics most similar to natal women according to my own research. They also are reputed to produce good sensation and good depth in almost every case, and I personally really liked the secondary sensate organ.
</li>
<li>
I started hormone blockers somewhat young (14.5) and did not have a lot of donor material. The Suporn Clinic gets good results despite the lack of material. Dr. Bank commented on both my small penis and small scrotum during my consultation, although was happy that I was uncircumcised.
</li>
<li>
I also considered GRS Montreal, as they would&#39;ve been free as a Canadian (Drs. Brassard, Belanger, and Laungani). I found that their aesthetics fell short in many ways, such as the labia minora ending in a fourchette before the vaginal entrance (a very common issue for any surgery that involves penile inversion, including PPT hybrid surgeries). Other surgeons considered at the time were Wittenberg, Bowers, McGinn, and the Meltzer Clinic. My research was done a year ago, and if I couldn&#39;t go to Dr. Bank for whatever reason today (2022), I would probably go to Wittenberg/Bonnington for full PPT (not because I&#39;m fully sold on its benefits, but because they produce better vulvar aesthetics in this case), Bluebond Lagner (I think she&#39;s improved a lot since when I was researching), McGinn, and Brassard or Belanger. Currently, Dr. Bank would still be my top choice of surgeon, even if money was no object.
</li>
<li>
I would have also gone to Dr. Suporn, but he retired just before I had surgery so this is a bit of a moot point. However, I believe that Dr. Bank is an amazing surgeon in his own right. When I booked my date there was less information on him, and I considered him to be an extension of Suporn. However, everything I&#39;ve seen here, on the discord, and here in Thailand (including my own results and experience) has convinced me of his excellence.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Would you recommend them to others?
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Yes, but I think it&#39;s more important to do your own research looking at results, testimonies, and techniques rather than to take my own word for it. My experience was wonderful and my results are great in my own opinion, but I&#39;m just one person and am inherently biased.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
What did it cost? If insurance was used what company?
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Around $23,000 CAD, but you should email the clinic for up-to-date pricing. They gave me exact quotes in response to my first email last year. I tried and failed to get my provincial insurance to cover them. This price includes (as far as I can remember/think of):
<ul>
<li>
All or almost all of your medications while in Thailand and the ones they send you home with. These include antibiotics, painkillers (including opiates), stool softeners, sleeping pills, anti-inflammatories, and whatever you get in the hospital.
</li>
<li>
About a 2-4 week supply of everything you&#39;ll need (condoms, lube, pads, etc.). I&#39;m starting to run out of a few things, and you&#39;ll need to buy them from stores when you run out. Different supplies run out at different times, for example, I&#39;m already out of pads but I have like 2 or 3 weeks of lube left.
</li>
<li>
Your entire stay in hospital (from the day before surgery to one week after). Anesthesia, medications, and food are all included. I&#39;m vegan and the hospital was very good about it, but the food was disgusting (this is a common experience for vegans and non-vegans alike)
</li>
<li>
A set of 4 dilators (small, medium, second, less breakable medium, and large). You can buy more dilators from the clinic, which I&#39;ll probably do because I&#39;m paranoid about losing or breaking them.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
How long was the wait list?
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The clinic doesn&#39;t operate on a waitlist, dates are first come first serve. They fill up quickly though, but I was lucky enough to get a date on my first try. I decided on this clinic in April of 2021, booked my date in June 2021 when new dates were released and had surgery at the end of May 2022. Around a year altogether, but I was also booking around my schedule at university so I could recover over the summer.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
How was the pain?
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Incredibly well managed, I had and have virtually none. I had a &#34;combo&#34; spinal block and general anesthesia. Right now there seem to be 2 anesthesiologists, one that prefers spinal and one that doesn&#39;t. Mine preferred spinal, but she still gave me a choice. I met her the day before my surgery and she was incredibly friendly and competent, with 25 years of experience. The last thing I remember on the morning of my surgery was seeing Dr. Bank in the OR, and curling up for the spinal block. I felt the needle, but there was no pain, and I was on so many drugs that I wasn&#39;t anxious at all. I don&#39;t remember actually being put under, but the patients I&#39;ve talked to who got only general do remember. If you get the regular general anesthesia, you get a morphine pump after surgery, but I was on morphine tablets and dynastat injections as far as I remember. I barely remember anything my first day, I don&#39;t remember waking up or anything. My dad tells me I slept a lot and threw up a lot, but I only remember throwing up once. I couldn&#39;t even use my phone because I was seeing double. I couldn&#39;t fully distinguish my dreams from reality and didn&#39;t really register that I&#39;d had surgery. The next day I was much more lucid, but I remember feeling like I&#39;d lost an entire day. There was no pain at all in the hospital, only slight discomfort, like a tight tuck. As far as I know, I was on morphine the whole time, and dynastat for the first day or 2. By the end (days 5-7), they were reducing my dose of morphine I think. They give you cups of pills after every meal, and wouldn&#39;t tell me what they were unless I asked. I took whatever they gave me because it was working, and well, but other patients were able to customize it a bit by just asking.
</li>
<li>
After the hospital, I was sent to the hotel with Celebrex (kind of like Advil), Paracetamol (acetaminophen/Tylenol), paracetamol with codeine, and tramadol. I take the celebrex twice daily as instructed, and occasionally I take paracetamol, especially after I had a little revision and was experiencing soreness (see: any complications?). I&#39;ve taken tramadol 3 times since hospital, twice was to try to pee (bad decision and didn&#39;t work, see: any complications?). The third time was for some fairly intense nerve pain I had one night, and it worked really well. I&#39;ve never taken the codeine, but if I ever have bad nerve pain again I might just to compare effectiveness. I haven&#39;t been avoiding the opiates, I&#39;ve just barely needed them. I&#39;m barely ever in pain unless I move the wrong way or sat too long earlier in recovery (and I want to feel that kind of pain so I can adjust). I get twinges of pain here and there, mostly in my clitoral area it seems, but they&#39;re very infrequent.
</li>
<li>
Dilation is a bit painful but manageable. Since starting dynamic dilation, it&#39;s really only the &#34;last inch&#34; that&#39;s painful, but nothing I would need strong painkillers for. This is normal for the first month, it famously gets worse in months 2 and 3. When I was doing static in week 2, the scar ring around the entrance was also painful, but that&#39;s mostly gone since starting dynamic and moving to 3 times a day. It&#39;ll come back with scar contracture.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Any complications?
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Very slight clitoral necrosis. This is common and should really only be aesthetic, but it was so minor for me that I doubt that will even be an issue. I can still feel my clitoris (Dr. Bank has a habit of poking it and the Chon organ at most checkups).
</li>
<li>
During my surgery, I apparently had some sort of issue with skin thickness on one of my labia minora, requiring Dr. Bank to suture some skin together in a way that caused a bit of a dog ear. He told me this the day after my surgery in his morning rounds and that he&#39;d fix it before I went home. I was picturing the worst, but it really didn&#39;t look that bad. Dr. Bank is a perfectionist though, and he performed a small revision last week to remove the dog ear. It&#39;s hard to describe what it looked like, but if I ever post my results I&#39;ll point it out. I still have sutures where he performed the revision, but it looks smooth. The revision was unpleasant but very minor.
</li>
<li>
I had to get re-catheterized 24 hours after leaving the hospital. Out of the whole surgery, this was probably the worst experience so far (not getting the catheter back in, but not being able to empty my bladder properly). I could pee well enough immediately after having the catheter out, but soon felt that my bladder wasn&#39;t fully emptying. It came and went the day I left the hospital. When the nurse came by in the afternoon to help me dilate, I told her about it and she said to keep drinking more water and tell the clinic if it got worse. It actually got better for a bit, and it wasn&#39;t until that evening and the next day that it got really bad. This is when I was taking tramadol to try to force pee out of my swollen urethra (bad idea, you shouldn&#39;t push), and that didn&#39;t work much, but I was desperate. It&#39;s hard to describe, but the pain in my urethra and the pressure of my full bladder was the worst feeling I think I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I made it until my clinic visit the next day at around 2 pm, and at that point, the catheter was a relief. I had tried to pee with some success before leaving, and an unfortunate situation where the external end of the catheter wasn&#39;t secured during insertion (yes, I sadly peed on Dr. Bank, not my proudest moment lol). Given all of that, I still filled up the catheter bag with 1.2 Litres of pee, meaning my bladder was more than full despite being able to pee in small amounts the whole time. I got it out again a week later and peeing has been fine ever since, but I was honestly a bit traumatized from the first time and I was scared it would happen again, so I almost cried happy tears when it didn&#39;t. Having the catheter in for an extra week was annoying more than anything, especially by the end, but it was nowhere near as bad as barely being able to pee even with a full bladder. I would suggest being less stubborn than I was, and not try and mask your inability to pee properly in any way. I thought that because I could pee a little I was fine, and as a result, didn&#39;t fully tell the clinic all the issues I was having out of a desire to keep the catheter out. In the end I still had to have the catheter put back in, I just also had many extra hours of suffering that could have been avoided.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
How does it look?
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
In my opinion, great, as far as is possible for primary SRS. My penis was 3.5 inches hard preop, though uncircumcised, so I was very concerned about aesthetics. Dr. Bank commented on this in my consult but said that it shouldn&#39;t be an issue. I have full-length labia minora that run down past my vaginal introitus and curve together to end about a centimetre apart (I think, haven&#39;t measured). My minora are still swollen, especially on the side where I had the revision, but they&#39;re already starting to look crinkled and natural. They are very well separated from my labia majora, with a deep interlabial sulcus. I think they&#39;ll heal to look very natural. The inner surface is pink, and the transition isn&#39;t as jarring as I thought it would be. I have a clitoral frenulum, but I haven&#39;t really seen it because I&#39;m not supposed to spread. My clitoris is on the smaller side for SRS, probably on the larger side for cis women, but I think it looks good the times I&#39;ve seen it when Dr. Bank points it out. My vulval vestibule looks a bit messy right now, especially my urethra, so I can&#39;t really comment on how it&#39;ll turn out yet. It&#39;s also too early to comment on my scars.
</li>
<li>
I can already see how an anterior commissure revision would benefit me, as my majoras diverge at the top. This isn&#39;t a huge issue and I knew it going into surgery. It&#39;ll probably look better the more it heals, but will always be this way unless I get a revision. I also have some hairs on the inverted perineum skin portion of the vaginal opening, which I knew would happen going in. I&#39;m actually somewhat pleasantly surprised by the inverted perineum skin, because there aren&#39;t as many hairs as I was expecting and it looks pinker than I was expecting. Still, it does look unnatural and it is probably one of the most unnatural-looking parts of the Suporn method. I&#39;ll probably look into electrolysis and getting the posterior commissure done if I come back for a revision. It&#39;s too early to say whether or not I&#39;ll come back for a revision and if I did, what exactly I&#39;d get revised. I know my results would look better with a revision, but it&#39;s more about the expense and the bother of coming all the way back to Thailand, so I&#39;ll have to decide if it would be worth it.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
For SRS, what was your depth?
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Originally 6.5 inches as measured by Dr. Bank. I now dilate at around 7.25 inches with the medium (31 mm) dilator, and I&#39;m trying to work this up. I was pleasantly surprised by the 6.5 inches, as I had a very small scrotum. Dr Bank recommended using the tunica vaginalis in my case because of this, and said that before the introduction of tunica, my &#34;V&#34; incisions would have had to be extended further up to harvest more skin.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
For SRS with surgeons that are not well known, how many surgeries have they done? Its interesting as there&#39;s a higher complication rate associated with less experience.
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Last I heard, around a few hundred. This number should be going up quickly though, as he currently does 4 primary surgeries most weeks.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
What would you like to have known before having surgery?
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Honestly, what a positive experience it would end up being. There have been many rough patches, but everyone on staff seems to know exactly what they&#39;re doing and have a system so perfected that you never really fall through the cracks (in my experience, of course, this is not the case for everyone). Additionally, I underestimated how helpful it would be to be surrounded by other trans women going through the same process.
</li>
<li>
This is something I knew going into surgery, but last year I almost went through with surgery at GRS Montreal without knowing it. You absolutely should not expect natal-identical results. SRS is a reconstructive surgery, and there will always be differences from biological anatomy even when done well. Choose a surgeon carefully to get the best results possible, but don&#39;t expect perfection.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
How is sensation
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
It&#39;s too early to really know, I&#39;m still in the &#34;no sexy thoughts&#34; and no self-exploration phase of recovery. In check-ups, he tends to poke the clit and Chon organ with tweezers and I can definitely feel that. I can also sometimes feel twinges of what feels like what used to be my foreskin (now the inner surface of labia minora), and sometimes I get light &#34;jolts&#34; of feeling that I can pinpoint to different parts of my preop anatomy (for example a side of the glans or the frenulum). I haven&#39;t done enough examination to figure out where these parts are now, or what&#39;s really causing them. We&#39;re not supposed to be feeling around or spreading things open at this stage, but I&#39;ll probably post further updates. I&#39;m not worried though, so far I haven&#39;t noticed any numbness.

This is a great thread that goes into some of the best detail exploring srs with the suporn team, thankyou for taking the time to write all this up.
</p>
<p>
A little advice from a past patient:
</p>
<p>
Try not to bend or hunch when you are sitting, or any stretches that pull from the nape of your neck to your pelvic bone. Its probably the one thing they did not specifically mention in their manuals or in consults. (Instead they say &#34;dont dilate with your legs up, be careful getting out of hot showers&#34; but it also applies to walking up stairs). Everytime you lift your thighs at a right angle to your body, it will stretch the fused skin at the base of your vaginal entrance, which over the course of the full 12-18 months, creates an affect of the skin being pulled up.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to message me for visual references and further explanations on this. Its simply a limitation of any srs technique that involves suturing skin downwards (That tucking feeling you felt in hospital).
</p>
<p>
If you do decide to share photos, that would be great. Here or anywhere.

It takes over 12 months for the all the skin to completely fuse. Obviously the clinic isnt going to include &#34;dont lift your legs for over a year&#34; though because that would be ridiculous and no one would.
</p>
<p>
But unfortunately the reality is that your skin has been pulled down and has been sutured to stay there, so when things start to fuse, contractions take place whereby the merging of the tissue binds and becomes tighter, we stretch it out with dilation and other activity but of course, general physical activity isnt really taken into account for how this will affect the long term (2-10 years onwards) result.
</p>
<p>
CW: potentially uncomfortable information
</p>
<p>
In a natal vagina, the whole vulva has grown naturally and so they can be bouncy and puffy, but secured naturally in the lower perineum, close to the anus, because of this, its not affected by the bodys pushing and pulling, because its centered to that location. During srs, especially with when labia minora are created, the graft creates a pulling effect, which can cause the skin below entrance to be anchored to the naval/clitoral hood, and by the process of contraction, over time, it will try to pull that skin up.
</p>
<p>
So when you bend over, with straight legs (forming a U shape when you touch your toes) or backwards, it will try to pull this skin down over the vaginal entrance. After the skin has fully fused (and i mean fully) this kind of movement won&#39;t affect you.
</p>
<p>
(If you&#39;re post op and want to see what i mean, try setting up a camera and take a photo of your behind on all fours, arching your back and pushing your ass up)
</p>
<p>
This is also a more likely issue to occure in people who are taller and skinnier.

No worries!
</p>
<p>
And thank you, I&#39;m trying. Do you mean that it involves stretching the scars where the minora meet the perineum, or that it just causes them to move up with time? I know a lot of girls who caused separation by sitting too much/moving too much early out of the hospital.

<p>
Yeah, other people sharing photos really helped me, so I want to give back. I guess I just didn&#39;t anticipate how scary the permanence of posting online, even anonymously, would be.

I&#39;m only at around 2inches soft and I&#39;m circumcized so I&#39;m concerned about that is being circumcised a problem for Dr.Banks? Also if I did desire a revision how long do you have to wait to get it? Very helpful post btw! (Edit:my mother won&#39;t stop telling me Thailand is dirty  so how was Thailand?)

I had srs with banks in April and I&#39;ve travelled quite a bit in Asia. Overall chon buri was pretty good for Asia. But honestly, you&#39;re unlikely to be travelling around the city much. The hospital, hotel and clinic however are extremely clean. The hospital was equal to any private hospital I&#39;ve been to in Australia, and better than many.  The hotel is lovely. excellent staff and pretty immaculate. Again, I travel a lot and it was not any different to a 4 star hotel in Melbourne or Sydney.

I believe that their current policy is that you can get a free revision at 1.5 years post surgery, and that Dr. Bank sometimes will do minor fix-ups for you in the 30 days post surgery, during your stay, if possible and warranted.

The other replies are accurate. Chon Buri is definitely a different environment, but I don&#39;t know what one would mean by &#34;dirty&#34;. As another commenter said, the hospital, hotel, and clinic are all clean which is what matters. You won&#39;t be able to do tons of exploring while here, and definitely don&#39;t need to if you don&#39;t want to.
</p>
<p>
Being circumcised will somewhat affect your results, but you can still get surgery and still get good results compared to other surgeons, in my opinion. The inner surface of your labia minora won&#39;t be pink, and you may not get a clitoral hood or frenulum. I was around 1.5-2 inches soft I think, and have full length labia minora that run past the introitus, so I wouldn&#39;t worry about that.
</p>
<p>
As another commenter said, any revision Dr. Bank thinks is necessary while you&#39;re in Thailand for primary SRS is entirely free. You can also book a free revision between 12-18 months post-op, but travel and hotel aren&#39;t covered just like primary.

What was you opinion on Dr Bowers? You mentioned the rest regarding your priority, but left her out. Thanks!

Originally I considered her to be better than GRS Montreal, but her waitlist was quite long and I didn&#39;t think she was worth it. I still think she&#39;s good at penile inversion, but to be honest some of her work is underwhelming (I think her best work is post-labiaplasty). I don&#39;t love penile inversion as a technique, just because it seems to place a lot of tension on the vulva, and means that penile skin can&#39;t really be used for the construction of the vulva.
</p>
<p>
I think she&#39;s definitely one of the better surgeons in the U.S., I just preferred Dr. Bank.

Can you please explain what do you mean by the anterior commodore? What is it? What does the revision do?

No worries!
</p>
<p>
The anterior commissure is basically the &#34;top&#34; of the vulva (clitoral hood area). The revision involves pulling the labia majora together and narrowing the clitoral shaft/hood.

My goal with SRS was to end up with a result as cis passing as possible, one where I could potentially have sex with someone and not need to disclose. I tend to think that the appearance of the vulva is more important for passibility than the feel of the vagina, or even that a PPT canal vs. a skin graft canal would feel all that different. Even more so because most PPT surgeons do a penile inversion followed by peritoneal tissue, so you&#39;re going to end up with skin in the vagina either way. I would love to hear people&#39;s experiences with this, but I doubt a penis or finger would really be able to feel the difference between a scrotal skin graft canal and a peritoneal canal. My vagina is pink, and feels slick and soft as it is. Additionally, tunica vaginalis (peritoneal tissue) was used in my surgery to supplement the scrotal graft, so theoretically I&#39;d already enjoy some of the supposed benefits.
</p>
<p>
I think that the Suporn clinic/Dr. Bank currently produces the most anatomically correct vulvas, which is what I thought would matter more for a passing result than the type of tissue used to line the vagina. This is a guess though, I don&#39;t really have a way of knowing how important the lining of the vagina is for passibility. I&#39;d love to hear other opinions on this :)

In Thailand you can get a full PPV/PPT version instead of the hybrid technique you described.
</p>
<p>
As long as you are happy with your results that is what matters in the end really.
</p>
<p>
Also there are surgeons out there that do make their vulva&#39;s anatomically correct as well in Thailand. Suporn/Bank and Chet are just the most spoken about for girls going there internationally.
</p>
<p>
Still happy that you are happy!

It was Ontario. I&#39;m not sure about BC, but good luck!
</p>
<p>
I was fighting with OHIP for a bit, but eventually gave up and decided that it was more worth it to get the surgery and pay out of pocket rather than waiting potentially years, maybe still with no success.
