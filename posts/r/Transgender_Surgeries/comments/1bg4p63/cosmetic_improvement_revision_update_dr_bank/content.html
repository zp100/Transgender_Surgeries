No. Only in the opening where it is only a cosmetic issue. The issue is so minor I haven&#39;t bothered getting electrolysis there.
</p>
<p>
Inside the vagina however there is no hair. Dr. Bank used a speculum to look inside and it was 100% smooth and pink.

Oh wow, the darker and wrinkly scrotal skin can actually turn into that texture naturally? How long does this process take?

They scrape off layers of the skin and stretch it out, so it isn&#39;t the same thing we typically think off with scrotal skin. The layer with all the hair follicels also gets scraped off.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how much it transforms after surgery or any timing.

I think the revisions at this clinic is more like a cherry on top an already excellent primary result. Only you can decide if it is worth it. My main reason was to get rid if the raphe line. The revision was free and I got a nice little mini-vacation for it. So it was worth it for me.

Will the revision add new scars? Or does Dr. Bank have a way to hide it?

I think the only visible new scar will be on top of the clitoral hood. But I don&#39;t think it will be very noticable once it heals.

Thank you so much. Your articles have helped me along the way, from primary surgery to revision. How was your flight home compared to your primary surgery?

I am still in thailand so I have yet to answer that!

However I bet it will be easier. I don&#39;t need a pillow to sit on and recovery is much much easier than primary.

Hi love! Your results are amazing ! I have a question regarding the opening of your canal.. I had my srs and so far I am happy just some aesthetic stuff I‚Äôd like to fix.. mine is more like this
</p>
<p>
(( )) &lt;- outer and inner labia O &lt;- the vaginal canal opening right below it. (the inner labia sort of connect together right above it )
</p>
<p>
Where as I find for cis women it typically looks like ( ( o ) )
</p>
<p>
The opening within the labia minora.. Is this something that can be fixed?  Or is this normal and I shouldn‚Äôt worry

Hi! Having the labia minoras extend so far down that they cover the vaginal entrance is very hard to create in SRS. Most surgeons can&#39;t do it because the high risk of the lips dying off after surgery. That&#39;s why most srs patients usually get the vagina entrance a little below the lips.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think you should worry about it. Even in cis women the diversity is big, and in my opinion this is just a very minor cosmetic issue. I haven&#39;t heard anyone fixing it in revision, so I can&#39;t answer if it is possible.
</p>
<p>
I have the ( ( o ) ), but that&#39;s just because I was lucky enough to go to a very skilled surgeon with a specific method.

How did you talk about what you wanted from the revision with Dr Bank? I&#39;ll have my revision soon and don&#39;t know how to start discussing it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also curious how sex or sensitivity was before your revision. Not that I think the revision made it worse - I&#39;m just curious about how the healing process improved as time went on.

Early on I had a problem where I would have to dilate beforehand otherwise it was too tight. But that problem has diminished a lot with time, as I have to dilate less and less.
</p>
<p>
It feels super amazing though. It really is as good as I hoped it would be. After a year post op it is the best way of intercourse.

Does it stimulate the clitoris? Or is it a different feeling? Have your orgasmed from penetration?
</p>
<p>
How far after surgery did it start to feel good?
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Sorry if I&#39;m asking too many questions. Just super anxious about my own vagina and it&#39;s recovery.

I think it indirectly stimulates all the other sensitive spots, like the lips and clitoris. Yes I have orgasmed from it. But tbh orgasming isn&#39;t important to me. It feels so good that I don&#39;t really care if I orgasm or not.
</p>
<p>
I think 6 months after I was comfortable enough playing around.

I researched and asked other patients what was possible to get done. Then I made a list if what I wanted.
</p>
<p>
I sent the list to the clinic with pictures. During the consultation we discussed the list and I told him what I wanted. Dr. Bank can also make suggestions and explain things.

The first one is free with the warranty. Otherwise it is 40000 Baht. (Pretty cheap tbh).

Are you able to describe how they removed the raphe line? Was it a cut and stitch job? Would love to see the afters photo if you don&#39;t mind showing.

My lubrication is really good. It can even be enough for penetration. Have had no issues. Sometimes I use lube because of convenience though.
</p>
<p>
Tbh I wouldn&#39;t want any more lubrication because I feel it would start to drip out lol. I am perfectly happy with what I got.

I&#39;m super bad at anatomy and stuff - where on the picture is the entrance to the vagina? Is this at the bottom of the vulva, where the stitches are?
</p>
<p>
Do you have stretch for width? Or are you &#39;limited&#39; in what kind of circumference you can take?

Hi! It is just above the bottom stitches. I am not limited to a specific size. If I dilate bigger I can take bigger.

Sorry for late comment, but would you mind specifying what the revisions on your clitoral hood specifically entailed? I&#39;m interested in bank for surgery but I do have some concerns in that specific area, so I would love some more information

Hi :)
<br>
was wondering if you are ok to answer some questions about your revision now that its been a few months and things have healed? Ok if not or if u want DM me that would be appreciated :)
</p>
<p>
I about 5 months out of my primary with Dr Bank and while I have a while before I would get a revision I am thinking about getting very similar things done as you have and so was wondering how things are going now?
</p>
<p>
So:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Removal of the raphe line -
<strong>
I definitely want to get this done, is there much scaring with this being removed and have you found dilating any different with it gone?
</strong>
</li>
<li>
Posterior comissure -
<strong>
I actually had this done in my primary so I wont need this but was this the only thing stopping you from dilating? If you got all the others done but this do you if you would still have needed to have a break from dilating?.
</strong>
</li>
<li>
Creating a more pronounced clitoral hood -
<strong>
How has this healed? is there much scaring and are u able to slide it up and down like dr bank mentioned? Also if it isn&#39;t too personal have you had any issue with hygiene with it? as I guess its another area for things to get stuck under
</strong>
</li>
<li>
Getting a more enhanced frenulum -
<strong>
was this at the top of the labia minor (around the clit) or at the bottom and part of the posterior comissure?
</strong>
</li>
<li>
Smoothing the urethra and reducing it size. It is now more symmetrical and I can also pee a little straighter -
<strong>
any issues with this in terms of irritation?
</strong>
</li>
<li>
I got the &#34;pockets&#34; fixed up too. (The crevice between labia minora and majora. I had 2 small barely visible holes before. -
<strong>
I have something similar but figure its easy fix so I don&#39;t have any questions :)
</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Sorry if this is alot or feels too inquisitive there aren&#39;t that many post about revisions and what were done (most post about dr Banks&#39;s work is the primary) so was hoping you could help me in sorting out my own revision.

Hi! Good luck with your upcoming date!
</p>
<p>
So to answer your questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
There is almost no visible scarring at all on me from this procedure. And it didn&#39;t affect my dilation once I got back into it.
</li>
<li>
This is what made me stop dilation for a month to let it heal with less risk of seperation. Once I got back to dilating I didn&#39;t notice a difference.
</li>
<li>
Not had any hygiene issues. It does slide up and down like dr. Bank said.
</li>
<li>
It was around the clit. The bottom of the clit id connected to it. It is not a big difference since before but I still think it got improved somewhat. I am happy with it.
</li>
<li>
This was so easy to recover from. I didn&#39;t experience any irritation or problems, and I could pee again directly afterwards without help.
</li>
</ol>

Amazing, thank you for responding ‚ù§Ô∏è

<p>
You have eased a lot of my worries. Just a follow up question if that&#39;s ok. With the clitoria  hood is their much scaring? And if there is, is it noticeable?

The small scarring there is is really not noticable at all. It just blends togheter to look like skin.
</p>
<p>
I think once I have time I&#39;ll make a new updated post with the final healed results.

I have the same type of revision on clitors hood and I am kind of worried about the scar or reduced sensation, I have the exact same type of sutures as you also.also are you still able to reach the clitors.

Yes I am able to reach it. It is not attached to the clit so it can slide up a little bit. Also I have not lost any sensation.

Hii! This is 2.5 weeks post-op revision with dr. Bank at the suporn Clinic. It has not healed yet, still got swelling and stitches. But it is good enough to explain what I got changed.
</p>

<p>
Looks great! Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
If you are up for sharing, I am curious, how many times did you apply to the Suporn lottery before receiving a surgery date. I have tried three times with no luck and am just trying to get an idea of how long it has taken for others. Thanks much.
