Hi everyone, I had type 3 forehead reconstruction with Dr Bensimon in Montr√©al last October! Feel free to ask me anything or dm me.  I am extremely impressed with the results!! It looks exactly like it did before going through the wrong puberty! My dysphoria is completely gone, everywhere, like somehow that one thing solved all the other dysphoria too. It was expensive, and the recovery absolutely sucks the hardest. But I have full feeling and motion back. The scar is healing well. He is a super passionate guy who I truly believe cares about his patients, knows how life saving this stuff is, and loves his job. Anyways, he did a great job with me, and I liked him a lot!
