May I ask when you had your sutures removed? How was mobility and discomfort at the one month / 4 week mark.  I’m looking at SRS myself and trying to figure out a path to recovery

So most of the sutures came out in their own or were absorbed, but at my last follow up appointment which is at the 1 month mark the doctor took out some of the remaining sutures.
</p>
<p>
I think the one month mark is about where I was getting more mobile and able to go on longer walks, and a lot of the discomfort started to dissipate.

Thank you you&#39;ve be generous in responding. I&#39;m was planing on having surgery mid June, but I&#39;m concerned that I&#39;ll be recovered enough come even Sept for several 5 hour drives in early Sept and wondering if I should be waiting a good month before flying and giving it a good 3 months before those kind of drives. Sept is a busy month for me :(

So my surgery was a 4 hour drive away from where I live so I&#39;ve been fine riding in the car on the way home from surgery and for my follow up appointments, but I had someone else doing the driving during those trips. But I have my next follow up this week and am planning to drive up on my own for that. I&#39;ve been able to drive around just fine 4 weeks after surgery, but that was for 15-30 minute drives at a time.

You look great for 6 weeks post op! Aside from the minor revision everything looks like it’s healing well with minimal scarring. It’s perfectly understandable to be bummed about the revision but the hardest part is over and there’s just a little bit left to go. You got this girly pop!

Looks great! How long did it take for you to schedule the surgery?
</p>

I had a consult with Dr Kassis a few weeks ago and just started hair removal.
