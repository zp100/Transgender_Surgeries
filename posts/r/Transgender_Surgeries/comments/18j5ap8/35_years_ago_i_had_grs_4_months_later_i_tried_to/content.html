A recent post about feeling suicidal post srs has prompted me to share my experience and my advice for how to handle post op depression and the mental fallout of having serious complications.
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery right before the start of the pandemic, and when I had serious complications, I was not able to go back to my surgeon. I was left to fix the complications all on my own which was not pretty. it definitely caused serious trauma, and the depression became unbearable over the following months. It was compounded by how painful dilation was. But there was nothing as bad as having to dilate in a psychiatric ward.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I did have a medication overdose and I cut my wrist. Thankfully I recovered but it wasn’t without the help of a taboo substance that you may have heard about recently in the news for PTSD and suicidality treatment. It was psychedelic therapy, specifically mushroom therapy. I found a psychedelic therapist through an organization called MAPS and I was able to heal these traumas through taking this medicine and then integrating my experiences. I did also have a revision surgery, but it was not until over a year later when I had already overcome suicidal depression from the complications revision surgery was brutal, but it did help a lot as well. Also, I am still healing, but I have come so far. Never give up hope

Incredible to hear. Anyone else reach this kind of help after a bad FFS or persistent dysphoria? I feel like the community always has such trouble helping with these tough situations because there’s often no easy solution.

I would also like to know this. I’ve found that my trans friends and I tend to have an abundance of trauma, which psychedelic medicine is incredibly helpful for if treated with respect &amp; not abused of course

Six months after my ffs, I made an attempt. The post op depression was so bad it made my ptsd flare up every day to the point that it has left me just in a constant exhausted state. I want gcs, but am barely hanging on as is, and fear this happening again.

I&#39;m so sorry, you are definitely not alone. I would wait for grs until you&#39;re in a better headspace and I&#39;d try to have as much support around you as possible. You can always message me if you want to chat. Take care

Ya, definitely waiting on it. Had ffs and vfs this year and absolutely tired. Two -three months off work would be hard for me to not feel cooped up and stir crazy.

I did the same therapy for my trauma (abuse). PTSD, trauma, depression, and anxiety occur at higher rates in the trans population than the general population. Healthcare also causes trauma that makes many trans person avoid healthcare.

I hope that the therapy was able to help your trauma. I definitely think that trauma, depression and anxiety are high in our population because of how much adversity we face when we’re just trying to simply exist

Thank you for sharing your experiences. I save posts like this to ease my troubled mind. I&#39;m glad that things have been getting better, and that you were able to find the care that you needed.

I am not pushing aside anything already said but just want to add that anytime there is an inflammatory process going on there is a danger of depression. Research over the recent past show that the products of inflammation are actually depressants themselves.

I second this sentiment. Psychedelics saved. My. Life.
