In what way is it damaging your hair? If there’s adhesive sticking to your hair I’d use baby oil/ vaseline to soften it when removing or replacing them. Most doctors don’t allow for patients to wash their hair while incisions are still fresh, but you can always trying shampooing and conditioning with the product diluted in water. I’d suggest speaking with your surgeon/ their nurses so you don’t risk infecting your incision sites.

Its just being stuck wrapped up in bandages all day/night. I probably was very restless the first few days which rubbed it all. Idk if you ever wore a wig cap, but it&#39;s kinda like that. Honestly I&#39;m almost two weeks out, I don&#39;t have to wear it during the day, just while sleeping but still it&#39;s bothering me, my hair is curly and prone to tangling. I&#39;m almost out of it but it still bothers me

Overall I&#39;m very happy with the entire process, he was extremely professional and his staff is amazing. I don&#39;t have enough good things to say about his head nurse April, she was very friendly to me. I got my consultation very quickly, and my surgery date came a few months after that. I believe we had three consultations before the surgery. Dr.Mittermiller was very patient with me, he listened to my concerns, he didn&#39;t over promise, and he made me confident in my choice. I had a pretty extensive operation, I believe it was over ten hours of operating. There is a part two to the surgery scheduled for February, to do the more subtle changes ie trac shave ect, but he left my face in a place where I&#39;m happy for the time being. I recovered very quickly, my procedure was on the 7th of November and by thanksgiving my bruises and swelling were not noticeable. I know it will take a while to fully heal but I can see my new face already and I&#39;m happy. My hairline lowering scar is very subtle and the only visible scar, my hairline was already receding but he made it nicer. My advice to anyone considering ffs is to really communicate, ask questions, bring pictures of yourself and women who have features you like. I did not go into detail I just told him to do what was natural for my face given my masculine features pre-op. He reduced my chin more than I was expecting but again I did not talk very much about my wishes. I just told him that my chin and forhead bothered me. I am 34, I had a very masculine face/hairline, I&#39;m still healing, there is a part two of my surgery, I still have a lot of electrolysis to do, and also I liked my male face, these are things that I have to keep in mind regarding my results.
