<p>
So I&#39;ve been in contact with the Belgrade centre and have now had a consultation with Dr Miroslav Djordjevic.
</p>
<p>
To start the cost - for me I was told €12000 but this is likely to increase due to current issues in inflation as well as rising practice costs and wages. It is recommended you stay in an apartment organised by the Belgrade centre that would cost €60 + tax a night which is very similar to renting property in the short term in Belgrade. All of your travel once arriving at the airport is handled by Dr Miro&#39;s team so taxi costs are sorted. You still need to pay for your own food but in the apartment you&#39;ve got all the appliances, WiFi, television, gas and electric etc.
</p>
<p>
The stay - so I arrive two days before surgery. The first day is acclimation and familiarisation with the surgery team. Day two is the final run through and health checks to make sure you&#39;re healthy and confident to go through the procedure. Day 3 is a four hour surgery following a spinal general anaesthetic. Days 4-7 you remain in hospital as this is when most complications can occur. Days 8-21 are at the apartment (or your chosen accomodation) and Dr Miro&#39;s team will come and check on you every day and then change the packing when appropriate (I was told it&#39;s frequent at first but then can be removed between day 15 and 17). Finally the catheter is removed between day 19 and 21 as urethral difficulties are a very complex matter and taking unnecessary risks isn&#39;t appropriate at this point. After this I can head home.
</p>
<p>
Recovery - physically I recover from injuries and tattoos incredibly quickly but having not been through surgery before this is new grounds for me. A return to everyday function with Dr Miro ranges from 3-4 weeks in which walking and light exercise is possible. However, I&#39;m going to allow at least 6 before I return to some more strenuous stuff and probably around 3 months before more intense exercise. Pretty much the point being made to me is that I can go back to work on my return to the UK.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions I can answer what I can and ask the surgery team anything that didn&#39;t come up in my consultation.
</p>
<p>
My only difficulty now is to get a surgery referral letter as my faith in the NHS has wained through years of waiting and working for them. I would love to get this sorted so I can focus on work and university to secure my position.

I&#39;m just chatting with him about getting PPT, he is so nice, and replies so quick. But there is so little info from his patients, even the ones who posted on here never reply or do updates. So please share your experience.
</p>
<p>
One thing that surprised me is the time he takes to remove catether, 19 days, you say? Don&#39;t other suregons do it in like 5 days post op?

So it&#39;s up to 14 days after hospital release, but you are right it can be removed earlier. Usually it&#39;s 5-8 days after but this is one of the largest areas for immediate complications

Initially I was looking at surgeons in the UK as I live here currently, I wasn&#39;t very confident in the results and considering the costs in the UK it&#39;s just not viable.
</p>
<p>
I asked around and looked on the trans wiki and looked into options for a similar price range but better results. Thailand and Serbia came up a lot. One of my colleagues in the NHS recommended a Dr in Benidorm from back in the 80s but he&#39;s retired now. But Dr Djordjevic is quite a bit name especially within Europe, when I got his direct number and email communication has been excellent and he&#39;s walked me through a lot which even the UK doctors wouldn&#39;t tell me

Amazing, I hope your experience with him continues to be good, and you get great results. I know he has many patients from Ireland, and that he did operations in New York last year. Also the quota he gave you is not unreasonable. I plan to go and see him ( I live in a nearby country, so I have insurance cover it) and then will decide if I go with him (hopefully becuase of proximity) or go to Thailand.

Uhhh - that sounds like a good place to start off with a surgeon!
</p>
<p>
&amp; is it a classic PI or some sort of combined method?

For the most part it&#39;s a classic technique but the advancement is the complete penile disassembly enabling the use of all components

That would be so good as that&#39;s £300, which relatively speaking is good. I&#39;ve emailed the surgery team to ask about what referrals they accept
