Truth be told, based on the pictures here, I actually think he has some of the nicest results. I might even rate some of them above Suporn.
</p>
<p>
But all of the reviews seem to be written in the same bad English advertisement voice.
</p>
<p>
- &#34;Thanks for making my dreams come true&#34;
</p>
<p>
- &#34;So natural&#34;
</p>
<p>
- &#34;Now I feel like woman&#34;
</p>

The pictures don&#39;t seem to be fake. Those are definitely transgender patients who underwent SRS. The photos don&#39;t seem to be taken from anywhere either because I would have noticed if any other surgeon had such good results. I believe those are real photos, so what&#39;s up with all the dodgy reviews?
</p>

Were they written by the staff there using real photos of real patients taken during surgery? Hence they all sound the same?
</p>
<p>
Or were they written by patients who were asked by the staff to help post a review on an English forum called Reddit, and the staff either gave them some standard sentences to use?
</p>
<p>
Or perhaps they were real stories written by patients, but in Thai? And the staff simply translated them to English and posted it under different accounts.
</p>
<p>
Does anyone know what&#39;s up? If you&#39;re a staff that works with Dr Kanit, now would be a great time to clarify. I think Kanit results look great, but all these weird posts make me suspect something is up.

THANK YOU!!!! I’ve been seeing this for a while.
</p>
<p>
The other thing to point out is, most accounts posting reviews, like 80-90%+ of their posts are somehow related to Dr Kanit. No posts on other trans topics. It makes them look like shills to me.
</p>
<p>
I’ve brought this up with a mod, and they said they’ve noticed it too, but are afraid to take any action that may appear to be favoring/disfavoring a specific surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I think it’s some combo of all his patients being Thai (hence the questionable English), and either being incentivized by the doc to post reviews, or straight shills taking real surgery pics to advertise.
</p>
<p>
If anyone is considering him as a surgeon, this fuckery would convince me to RUN!

I&#39;m not afraid to take any action, its a matter of ethics. I talk about it in the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/index" rel="nofollow">wiki
</a>
.

<strong>
About Me
</strong>
When I started out on reddit I used to post my opinions on surgeons just like anyone else, but I&#39;ve pulled back from that and mostly stopped. This wiki and moderating has given me more attention and influence than I&#39;m comfortable with, and I don&#39;t think its fair for me to influence anyone&#39;s choice in surgeon beyond providing links to resources. For all these reasons if/when I have surgery I&#39;m not going to post about it under this account.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I do however collect links to posts like this and add them to the wiki.

Sorry- “afraid” was probably the wrong choice of words. And I 100% support your stance btw!!
