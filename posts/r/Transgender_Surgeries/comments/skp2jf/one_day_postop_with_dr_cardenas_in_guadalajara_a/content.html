Best way to describe my feeling right now: I feel like I look like I&#39;ve been through a car crash. But I feel like I look like the woman I&#39;ve always meant to be... going through a car crash.

Cool!  Wishing you a fast and successful recovery.  It‚Äôs always amazing how much faces look like a Gamorean after surgery.   A little more green, and you could audition for Book of Boba Fett!
</p>
<p>
I hope you‚Äôre laughing, but that it doesn‚Äôt hurt.   Laughter is the best medicine.   Well,
<em>
morphine
</em>
is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù medicine, but yeah‚Ä¶ laughter is good.   Looking forward to an update when you‚Äôre healed and happy.

Dr. Cardenas is on my list, how has your experience been with him, and his team? Is there anything you thought could have been better?
</p>
<p>
Wishing tou a speedy recovery, hopefully they offered you good pain managment, and you aren&#39;t in agony.

So far it&#39;s been great. I&#39;ve had other woman complain that his bedside manner could be better. But he&#39;s just very serious and takes his job very seriously. The cardiologist told me that he basically reads about surgery, performs surgery, and exercises. And that&#39;s what I want in my surgeon.

His team has been pretty fantastic and I&#39;ve felt almost no pain so far. But the tinkling in my toes indicates that the anesthesia is starting to finally completely wear off 1.5 days after surgery. I had not been under anesthesia before so I had a less than great experience where I threw up a few times after I woke up. But they gave me medicine to help with that and had no way to know how my body would react. They had me under pretty heavy watch when it was happening.

There&#39;s gauze around them, so not as uncomfortable as you&#39;d expect. But still pretty uncomfortable, lol.

I hate to ask this how much was the FFS surgery you had? I&#39;m still fighting with my insurance company. As it&#39;s too expensive to pay for it here in the US.

Hiya,
</p>
<p>
I hope you‚Äôre healing nicely.
</p>
<p>
Wow! Your forehead does look rather ‚Äòflat‚Äô- exactly what one wants! Go you! :) I don‚Äôt see a ‚Äòbefore‚Äô to compare with and know you‚Äôre swollen but thats a cis-female‚Äôs forehead alright!
</p>
<p>
Would you mind if I asked what you got done please? I‚Äôm due to be operated by Dr Cardenas mid March 2022 and will be getting a type 3 forehead, revision rhinoplasty with possible augmentation, fat transfer to cheeks, under eyes, chin and jaw contouring, lip lift and fat infiltration to the lips.
</p>
<p>
Cheers xx

Apologies- just went through your previous posts for a ‚Äòbefore‚Äô. WOW! I‚Äôm incredibly happy for you! Huge difference already re the forehead! :) Can tell when the swelling is down, you‚Äôre going to have a beautiful, harmonious profile where the nose flows with your forehead! :) Congrats xx

I got a type 3, brow reduction, hairline lowering, Rhinoplasty, chin + jaw contouring, upper lip lift and fat infiltration into lips. Similar to what your are planning. The worst part is definitely the Rhinoplasty; and today is the day of maximum swelling, lol.

Thank you for that. Its exciting and I know what to look-forward to! I‚Äôm actually admiring how ‚Äòclean‚Äô those stitches are too. :)
</p>
<p>
Max swelling sucks- especially when one shouldn‚Äôt be blowing their nose, etc. Hang in there! It looks like you‚Äôre really going to enjoy what you‚Äôll see once the swelling goes down. :)
</p>
<p>
Out of curiosity, did he tell you he couldn‚Äôt give you a completely ‚Äòflat‚Äô forehead? :) I was told he couldn‚Äôt give me a completely flat forehead but will do his best to make it as flat as possible with the Type 3.
