I haven‚Äôt tried tucking yet because the incision is still a bit sensitive but I can tell its going to be much easier. Most of my bulge is gone and its now just a matter of pushing my penis back

No pain at all and swelling is nearly all gone. At this point, there is only slight tenderness at the incision sight. No complications of any kind.
</p>
<p>
I can‚Äôt express how badly I needed this surgery. I feel more comfortable in every way that a girl can fee comfortable. I feel so light and clean and feminine. More than anything, I wake up each day grateful that those awful things are finally gone. I feel more comfortable with my body than I thought possible. I love being a woman and I love being trans.

Are you planning on having SRS eventually? I&#39;m debating on whether to have an orchi.

In some types of SRS they might use ‚Äútunica vaginalis‚Äù tissue for self-lubricatin neovagina. It is impossible to keep tunica vaginalis and remove testicles only.
</p>
<p>
So, if there are no medical reasons for orchi, and one is going to stay open to all SRS techniques; orchi might be not just unnecessary but counterproductive.
</p>
<p>
But if it‚Äôs personal aesthetics preference ‚Äî it‚Äôs a different story, of course :)

I am getting an ochi and was concerned about not being able to get the Supporn technique. However my surgeon mentioned that this was not an issues. Where did you get this information? I am curious!

If your surgeon(s) (who is going to perform the SRS) is telling you that there is no issue - plz trust them.
</p>
<p>
Info was from one of the &#34;pre-requisite&#34; lists on one of the SRS-clinic sites. If I find it again - I&#39;ll give you a link.
</p>
<p>
Just curiosity: is it for aesthetics or to get rid of antiandrogens?

Since you had yours by itself first can I ask like what swelling is there and from what really the insecion or from cutting the cord? I really wouldn&#39;t have thought there would be anything it&#39;s just very thin layer of skin and a small cut and then the white bubble of whatever they are encased in and snip and tie cord and that&#39;s all correct? I&#39;ve seen it on YouTube and I have literally cut thousands of pigs and they looked just like the humans on YouTube but a lot smaller being cut at 6 weeks old. Thanks

You can definitely feel the ends of the swollen cords for about a week or so. It isn‚Äôt too bad ‚Äî more like a throbbing and a soreness. After about a week, they go down and you cant feel them. I had some bloating the first two days that made it more painful than usual.

I really wish I could get mine done, that would be another great baby step towards my goal but insurance has to come first and hopefully I will have that obstacle behind me after the holidays.

Yes, I want to get SRS for sure. I have a consultation planned for February. For me, orchiectomy was absolutely essential (I had it at 10 months HRT) and I couldn‚Äôt wait for SRS in order to get rid of them. I had profound, debilitating dysphoria from my testicles and I knew I couldn‚Äôt live with them as long as I can deal with my penis. I would definitely recommend orchie if you feel you can‚Äôt wait for or don‚Äôt want to get SRS
</p>
<p>
And nice! My orchie was done at Griffin Hospital in Derby, but I‚Äôve spent a lot of time in Ansonia

I can still get erections easily, though they aren‚Äôt hard enough to penetrate. This was the case with HRT before my orchie but I feel like they have gotten softer since.

Was it easy to get this procedure? What is the order of operations needed to get this done? What state or location? I&#39;ve always wanted an orchi but I dont even know how to start the process. So many restrictions seems like .. Appreciate any insights and thanks so much in advance. Btw looks amazing!!!

It depends a lot on where you live and what insurance you have.
</p>
<p>
General rules are 12 months HRT and two letters from mental health professionals ‚Äî one of which must be at the doctoral level. However, the new WPATH requirements only ask for 6 months HRT and one letter. Some places are going by the old rules and some are going by the new.
</p>
<p>
I had mine done at 10 months HRT. It was not easy. I had to see two different urologists and only the second would agree to help me before 10 months. Before that, my therapist and primary care physician had to write very serious letters detailing that I was a suicide and self-harm risk if I was denied surgery any longer ‚Äî and this was true. My testicles were making hard for me just to function. If i saw them or felt them too much, I would get nauseous and cry. My therapist and doctor ‚Äî both of whom are trans ‚Äî took me very seriously and fought hard on my behalf. Even so, there was a good chance my insurance wasn‚Äôt going to cover it before 12 months ‚Äî and I‚Äôm a bit amazed that they did. I had state Medicaid and had this done in Connecticut.

Looks good and to those searching for a doctor stay away from Urologist Aaron Grotas of Mount Sinai, NYC. He is a butcher/ botcher with the worst bedside manner or follow up care.

What kind of orchi did you get? I can&#39;t even see the incision.  I got mine 3 weeks ago and my incisions are waaaaayyy more pronounced.   They aren&#39;t infected but I&#39;m a little concerned

I had a scrotal incision. It is hard to see, but the incision is that little groove toward the bottom of my scrotum. It had decreased a ton since surgery.
