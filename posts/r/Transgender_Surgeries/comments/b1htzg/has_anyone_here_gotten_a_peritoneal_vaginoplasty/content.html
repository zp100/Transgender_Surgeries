I&#39;ve been hearing a lot lately about this surgery and how promising it is with guaranteed lubrication, no need to dilate, shorter operation.  I was wondering if anyone here has gotten it and would be willing to talk about it?
</p>
<p>
I would get it if I had the opportunity but it isn&#39;t offered everywhere.  Im getting standard penile inversion in 2 months and Im hoping I can get peritoneal revision in the future when it becomes more mainstream.

There are a few people I know who have gotten it, and I&#39;ll be having one in a few weeks. There seem to be some misunderstanding here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You absolutely still need to dilate to maintain depth/width. The only vaginoplasty that doesn&#39;t require dilation is a no-depth vaginoplasty because, well, there&#39;s nothing there to dilate.
</li>
<li>
Lubrication is not guaranteed, AIUI. It&#39;s likely to be better than a standard penile inversion, but the technique is still pretty new and most surgeons aren&#39;t guaranteeing this in my experience.
</li>
</ul>

I see, that&#39;s definitely a misunderstanding on my part.  Perhaps it&#39;s moreso LESS dilation and MORE lubrication, not guaranteed for both.
</p>
<p>
What has the experience been like for your acquaintances?

Everyone seems very happy with the result! Most have mentioned having good lubrication and no issues so far, though it&#39;s only been a year or so for them.

I just want to point out that the additional lubrication offered by peritoneal vaginoplasty is
<em>
not
</em>
tied to arousal.and in this way it resembles the colon technique but with lower risk.

I&#39;m now 16 months post-op with Dr. Bluebond-Lagner and was one of her first patients using the peritoneal tissue as I didn&#39;t have a lot of material due to an intersex condition. Here is my detailed information about what it was like 2 weeks after surgery (with robotic information link/video):
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/7dmdm3/i_am_just_over_2_weeks_postop_from/">https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/7dmdm3/i_am_just_over_2_weeks_postop_from/</a>
</p>
<p>
The robot is pretty neat as it mainly goes through the belly button (and 2-3 other small incisions in the stomach). There isn&#39;t even a scar there now. The robot aid in more finely defined sutures and attaches the vaginal wall from the inside. The result is much less scaring in the vaginal canal. I had almost zero granulation as a result.
</p>
<p>
The technique of using the Peritoneum tissue for vaginal reconstruction is nothing new and has been done for over 40 years for cis women with MRK Syndrome. What&#39;s new is it being applied to transgender women for GCS. Google
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Peritoneum+grafts+vaginal+reconstruction&amp;oq=Peritoneum+grafts+vaginal+reconstruction&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.13947j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">&#34;Peritoneum grafts vaginal reconstruction&#34;</a>
and you will come up with a lot more. One long term study (
<a href="https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(14">Long-term results of vaginal construction with the use of Frank dilation and a peritoneal graft (Davydov procedure) in patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster syndrome</a>
02264-X/fulltext) ) found that the long term results were extremely good for cis women who have had this procedure.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I&#39;m glad this method was used vs using a skin graft from my thigh or bikini line (as that was the only other alternative for me.) The big advantage is that I&#39;m self-lubricating which is really nice. I still need lube for dilation, and sometimes even for some toys (as does my cis wife), but it&#39;s never dry down there.
</p>
<p>
No matter which option, even with the colon method dilation is still needed. This has more to do with training the muscles there than stretching skin/tissue. In dilating, the muscle in that are are being trained and need to do to having no opening there for so long.

It&#39;s a technique that uses the peritonuem, which is the skin lining the inside of your abdomen, as the lining for the neovagina

Thank you. I didn&#39;t know that was a thing. I knew there was one surgery that uses part of your colon or something like that but not this.

One of my partners is having a non-standard SRS with Wittenberg, and since she’s keeping the penis, they need to do the peritoneal pull through because there wont be enough tissue to form the vagina.

That sounds super interesting, actually.  She&#39;s going to have both a penis and a vagina concurrently?

I&#39;d like to ask why, if that&#39;s ok.  If you prefer not to answer that&#39;s totally fine!
</p>
<p>
Also will she maintain the urethra running through the penis or will she have it moved?

Why do any of us have the surgeries we have? Because it&#39;s what we feel comfortable with. My wife might also end up having this procedure, because she identifies as non-binary, and this &#34;fits&#34; her idea of what her body should look like.
</p>
<p>
And for you second question, my partner will maintain the urethra running through the penis.

Understandable.  I will freely admit I have never thought about surgeries for non-binary folks.  That&#39;s pretty awesome, actually, that there are non-standard SRS versions to help her match her internal identity.

Could you explain to me what the process is like for getting nonstandard SRS? I know a handful of people interested, but we&#39;ve always been under the impression it&#39;s impossible without going to a back alley in a foreign country.

Here in the bay area, you usually just ask. Bowers, Whittenberg, Satterwhite, and Crane all do non-standard SRS.

Oh, I had no clue - most people tell me every surgeon in the US who does bottom-surgery follows WPATH standard protocols only. I was also under the impression Dr. Ting and Dr. Bowers only did peritoneal if there wasn&#39;t enough material otherwise with penile or scrotal skin grafts.

I could probably really enthusiastically enjoy  the idea of becoming a surgically created Futanari myself, if not for two reasons that would be issues for me... 1) I&#39;m old as dirt and couldn&#39;t make enough usage (perhaps capitalize on) of the combination. If I were a lot younger, I could make a heck of a name for myself in the erotica business :-) and 2) Since I was very young, I wanted to be able to wear tight fitting sexy shorts, pants, bathing suits, etc without having to tuck my junk away and...my naughty side wants to be able to wear short skirts and dresses &#34;commando&#34; and not have my junk hanging down.

There have been a couple of women on reddit who said they had it and while there was some lubrication, it wasn&#39;t in all cases sufficient for sex without additional lubrication. So I think &#34;guaranteed lubrication&#34; is not accurate as of yet. I think the leading surgeons working on this, especially Bowers and Bluebond-Langner, would classify the surgical procedure as a work in progress and long-term results are still being compiled and reviewed.

The only technique with guaranteed lubrication is the sigmoid colon vaginoplasty. It is also the only technique that doesn’t require dilation at max depth. But there are a lot of downsides to it too.

I just got a pull-through peritoneal vaginoplasty with Dr. Sidhbh Gallagher in Indianapolis on the 29th. I was her first peritoneal patient, although she was helped by the chair of the urology department (Dr. Michael Koch) who had a lot of prior experience with the peritoneum. There were no complications and overall the recovery is going quite well. Let me know if any of y&#39;all have questions.

Hi. I&#39;m starting to learn about srs and natural lubrication is of course a big desire for me in the outcome. Would you be willing to share more about your results in a post of your own?
</p>
<p>
If not, I&#39;d like to ask you some things here. It&#39;s been 3 years, what is the lubrication like for you now compared to a year post-op?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard that the self-lubrication is not linked to self arousal. Does your body just lubricate at all times? Does this mean there is leakage throughout the day, such as when standing for longer periods of time?
</p>
<p>
And lastly, how would you rate the aesthetics of your results?
