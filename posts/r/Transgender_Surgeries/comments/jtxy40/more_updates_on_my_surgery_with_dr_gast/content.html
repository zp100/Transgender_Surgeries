Hey y&#39;all, I had a
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/jmtrmj/is_there_a_support_group_for_botched_surgeries/">recent post here discussing how I had some pretty big issues post-surgery with Dr. Gast recently</a>
. Well, I got to see her in person finally for an appointment instead of the other plastic surgeon I&#39;ve seen since post-op. So I thought it&#39;s time for an update.
</p>
<p>
Before we begin: she agreed to a revision to help me out, likely outpatient so there&#39;s a slim chance it might not get canceled due to COVID. I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed because I&#39;m really going to need this to happen sooner over later. For reasons I&#39;ll explain shortly.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
So, talking to Dr. Gast was actually far easier than I thought. Armed with some VERY helpful info from my pelvic floor therapist (GET ONE IF YOU CAN AFTER SURGERY SHE WAS A LIFESAVER FOR ME) I was able to go in and discuss my issues.
</p>
<p>
So, my issues with surgery may not be Dr. Gast&#39;s fault, but moreso bad luck with my body.
</p>
<p>
I discussed I had some actually severe tightness previously. Like, the dilators get stuck very bad levels of tightness and are rough to ever get in. I have some VERY rough hypertrophic scarring all around the entrance to the vagina. My pelvic floor is fine (in fact, both doctors have confirmed it&#39;s apparently impressive even, and internally I have zero scarring at all) but not the entrance.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been getting tighter, and even with multiple massages daily (which is awkward as hell) I&#39;m struggling to use more than my medium-sized dilator.
</p>
<p>
However, Dr. Gast is going to do some work to help open things up and make that a LOT better for me hopefully. Since everything else is healing so well, this is a minor deal. I can do the surgery and go home that day. Hopefully, it won&#39;t be too bad, and I won&#39;t need too much more work to fix this particular part of the issue.
</p>
<p>
But yeah if this isn&#39;t fixed, things will get EVEN tighter and I would legit have issues fitting anything in.
</p>
<p>
As for the weird skin-bridge thing I got going, separating the upper part of my vagina from the bottom (you can find pics in my post history) is also potentially the same kinda scar tissue. She seems to think that can be fixed as well, and without it there my labia won&#39;t be pulled out way too far so I actually have a lower labia.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
So two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
If anyone&#39;s had experiences with a lot of hypertrophic scar tissue like this I could use advice, as searching has given very little.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;ll keep people updated on how it goes if surgery isn&#39;t canceled (supposed to be on December 7th)
</p>
</li>
</ul>

If you have a propensity for forming keloids, there are things that can be done when they are removed to prevent their return.  Dr pimple popper has some patients that have had keloids and does a few things to prevent their return when removing them.  I don&#39;t say what they are because I don&#39;t remember what they are and don&#39;t want to tell you something wrong.  Look it up and discuss with Dr Gast whether any of these would be viable for you.

And I‚Äôm glad Dr. Gast is taking responsibility. üëç. There have been too many recent reports of women with complications getting next to no post-surgical help.  So I hope things work out for you.
