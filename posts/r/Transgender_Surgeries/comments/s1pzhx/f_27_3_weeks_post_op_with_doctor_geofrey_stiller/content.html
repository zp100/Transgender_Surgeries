Hiya so basically I had my consult on the phone in March 2021 due to covid just to talk with stiller and so he could submit to insurance for approval I also had an  in person visit I was approved by insurance after towards the end of May then stiller set my Surgery date to December 21st 2021 and a pre op visit on the 20th started electrolysis in late June luckily I&#39;m not a very hairy girl neither is my mom my dad was very hairy tho lol anyways I only had to do about 18 sessions the only pain with electrolysis is the nerve blocking shot but it&#39;s pretty painful 10+ shots in the genital areas is no fun but I got thru it. Electrolysis would be hell without the block i stayed in spokane for 2 weeks medicaid payed for my airplane tickets from Seattle and set up my transportation scheduale they also paid for my lodging wich was actually  perfect place called Stratford suites they had a full apartment style motel basically full bathroom full kitchen living rooms 2 bedrooms it was perfect you have to have a caregiver of choice with you to help you  I had my mom thankfully

I&#39;m glad yours went so well...now, mine is cancelled, and no idea when it will be again. I&#39;m on a wait list for people who cancel is the most that I know

Yes iam too beyond pleased with everything he&#39;s a amazing person for what he does and how he got started doing these surgeries is a pretty great story you can read about him too he specifically wanted to start doing them specifically when only a handful of doctors had the knowledge in the United States I&#39;m so sorry to hear Bout your cancelation and it really sucks for you to have to wait do you know why it was canceled?

I&#39;ve heard nothing but good things about him (results and personally), but I&#39;ve only met him for like 10 minutes back in May for my consultation.
</p>
<p>
The hospital told them to cancel cases in February because of spiking COVID cases in the ICU again, and mine was canceled. Just shy of 3 weeks prior to surgery...I. Am. LIVID.

Omg thats is such bs I was just there 3weeks ago it cant be that bad now after all the vaccinations and such whatever I&#39;m sure they will reschedule it for a sooner date don&#39;t worry ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚  I doubt they will make you wait too long I hope they get back to normal soon because iam waiting for approval from insurance for a rhinoplasty and brow lift I&#39;m stealthy and pass but those areas really bother me still personally so hopefully I get approved and can get on a schedule for that

You&#39;d think so..they told me my only hope was to get somebody&#39;s spot that cancelled. Otherwise I&#39;m likely looking at July, which would be 15 months after my consultation.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, I&#39;m sorry for derailing. I&#39;m excited for you about your results and I&#39;m glad you were able to have your surgery. Mine will happen at some point, just not now
