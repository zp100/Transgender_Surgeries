Writing to say I got my top surgery done by Dr Rumer back in February and she left a sliver of my nipple down by the scar line.
</p>
<p>
There is a noticeable little brown semi circle on my right side and I was very unhappy about this because I paid almost $6k out of pocket for this.
</p>
<p>
I went to Dr Rumer to ask about a revision and she told me it wasn’t actually my nipple just a part of the scar. Not only would she not admit wrongdoing but she tried to gaslight me into believing my nipple wasn’t there.
</p>
<p>
She eventually agreed to do a revision “to make me happy” but I do not think I will be returning to her.
</p>
<p>
Also the hospital staff where she operates out of have absolutely no transgender sensitivity whatsoever. Even though my ID and my paperwork said Male I was repeatedly called “she” by many of the attending nurses

Oof... Yeah Kathy Rumer is awful, just the worst. Jezebel did a whole writeup on how awful she is.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for your troubles, brother, I would PASS HARD on her having any sort of hand in your treatment going forward.

I would say at this point it&#39;s pretty commonly known that Kathy is a detestable doctor and has no bedside manner neither does the staff at the hospital. I&#39;m sorry that you had to go through this, I&#39;m so sorry. I thought about going to her for bottom surgery a couple of years ago just so I can get it done quickly and I&#39;m very very happy that I decided not to and decided to wait for Dr BBL. I wish someone would take away her license because I can&#39;t imagine how many trans people she butchers in a year.

Also  she needs to stop being referred to as a doctor.   ‘Killer of dreams Kathy’  is more like it.    First rule of doctors is to do no harm  and she does way too much.

People don&#39;t listen to the warnings about her. There are plenty including pictures. No don&#39;t go back to her for revision. Rumer bad.

People don&#39;t usually listen to what they don&#39;t wanna hear. So even if we warn them they still go.

I have done extensive phallo research. Time and time and time again, I cannot find any comprehensive reviews of Rumer that don&#39;t sound like an absolute nightmare, tbh. And this is for every type of trans surgery she does.
</p>
<p>
All I hear are bad things from her (former) patients. Same thing with people who decided against going under her care after not feeling right about her. I would most definitely to everyone at this point: stay away from Rumer!!!

Also I think it needs to be said, don&#39;t see Kathy Rumer for any surgery at all. She has a notoriously bad bedside manner while also being horrible at all the surgeries she provides.

I had the same type of surgery for gynecomastia. Even though I am not transgender myself , she even put that in the operative report. It&#39;s the worst mistake anyone can make going to her for ANY surgery because she doesn&#39;t do ANYTHING right.That&#39;s the truth. She caused me countless problems over the years and I am still suffering as a result of her nerve injury. Speaking of nipples, she even made a retarded comment of saying &#34;your nipples would look artificial if they were perfectly aligned&#34; when I complained how off they looked (one nipple size off)  what a comeback to make them look off. This butcher needs to get the justice she deserves and people need to report her.The more victim&#39;s voices, the better.

People are scared to speak up due to her frivolous legal threats, as reported by jezebel.com. people still need to speak up.

Where is the frikkin&#39; AMA? What good are they if they continue to let her engage in malpractice. They&#39;re as culpable as her in my opinion. They are there to protect the public from unscrupulous and incompetent medical personnel. So where are they? Smh

she should really lose her license. iv&#39;e read it time and time again how she gaslights patients or blames them. so many of these stories are the same, even across multiple review sites. wtf?

She has a lot of civil cases pending against her. You&#39;d think she was uninsurable at this point? I mean, who&#39;s giving this person malpractice insurance? What kind of vetting process could they have? You would think any insurance company&#39;s forensic dept.  would identify her as a risk not worth taking. I simply don&#39;t get it. In the days of the google you&#39;d think they&#39;d get a  clue....smh

Daaamn everyone is shitting on her here. I&#39;m extremely happy I came across this because I was thinking about seeing her for bottom surgery and I&#39;m glad I saw this before I did anything. I&#39;m very sorry for everyone that has gone to her and had bad results, she seems undeniably terrible

Sorry to hear that she messed you up.  Rumer actually seemed to do fairly well on FTM top surgery.  I guess that is now on a par with her other “work.”  You are smart not to go to her for a revision.
