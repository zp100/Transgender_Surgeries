I’ve heard such polarizing experiences with Brassard. I am so glad it’s working out for you

I think they happen with all surgeons just want to be transparent for everyone to show what can happen, I will say the public flak brassard gets compared to how he acts In person is completely different, down to weekly contact and follow ups and very compassionate care toward making sure I&#39;m recovering to his best ability even though I&#39;m not in the same province anymore.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also glad how well its healing I&#39;m extremely lucky after the bad luck I did have.

I always think ymmv with all surgeons. I feel its sorta like dating, it’s important to have chemistry so they can give you the best outcome possible for you. That personal connection is important tor me at least
