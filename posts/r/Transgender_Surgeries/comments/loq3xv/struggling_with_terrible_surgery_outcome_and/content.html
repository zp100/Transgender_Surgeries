I&#39;ve posted on here a bunch of times about how it seems like the results of my surgery have gone from terrible to somehow even worse but it&#39;s really starting to affect me in a horrible way. I&#39;ve been trying to find support or other people who have gone through these issues but am coming up completely short.
</p>
<p>
Things down there keep hurting, I can&#39;t even try to spread my labia in any way to enjoy the fact that I at least have a working clit without it burning. Heck, my clit hurts pretty bad too with most direct stimulation in any way. My urethra constantly stings these days so I can&#39;t even just try to forget it exists for a while.
</p>
<p>
Not to mention things are no so incredibly tight that it&#39;s like I have a damn second belly button where my vagina is supposed to be. I have to fucking pick out lint so it won&#39;t get stuck in there. It&#39;s dysphoric and downright humiliating.
</p>
<p>
I regret ever getting surgery. I would give anything to go back in time and reverse this. Fuck, I&#39;d try getting a damn phalloplasty at this point but I can&#39;t even figure out if it&#39;s just as likely that I would end up with just more extreme levels of pain because of more surgery.
</p>
<p>
Seriously, it sucks because every time someone makes suggestions they aren&#39;t even helpful.
</p>
<blockquote>

Get into therapy and get help

<p>
The reality of this situation is basically no therapists know how to approach this situation. My regular therapist who is usually amazing has been useless and even people my hospital tried to recommend literally have no idea how to begin helping someone with bad surgery results. When even a therapist shrugs, it makes you feel hopeless beyond all measure.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Revisions exist and can help
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yeah, the doctor wants to perform a vaginal obliteration (seriously, that&#39;s what it&#39;s called) to completely close up my vagina forever. But either way trying to figure out at least making the aesthetics better so it&#39;s not an ugly mess could make everything down there hurt EVEN MORE making sex even worse.
</p>
<p>
No one is going to look at what I have and find it remotely attractive or even close to normal. So I&#39;m left between a rock and a hard place of hating how I look or likely being in more pain. (Though how could I know when there&#39;s basically no information on this kind of shit for me to find).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Talk to friends and get support
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This one is the worst part of all. Even trying to discuss issues with surgery or regrets has straight up gotten me practically blacklisted in trans groups I&#39;m in. People refuse to speak to me, are incredibly rude and hurtful, and do anything they can to change the subject when I just need help.
</p>
<p>
It just feels terrible in every way. There&#39;s no one to help, no support groups where people understand, and basically no hope of things getting better. I&#39;m just stuck with this painful terrible vagina I hate beyond all measure now and will be the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s made me become so dysphoric I now hate everything feminine I once enjoyed and don&#39;t even want to interact with it anymore. It&#39;s like realizing I&#39;m trans all over again but a million times worse.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what to do anymore. I can&#39;t keep having major emotional breakdowns over this every other week and still try to function. I&#39;m not sure what this post will do to help but I can&#39;t just keep balling up these emotions inside anymore and I need help

I struggled with bad surgical results too, although mine was related to FFS and not GCS.
</p>
<p>
My original surgeon tried to tell me most of my face was &#34;fine&#34; and said there was no way to correct the scarring that he had caused. The solution he proposed was just to try to hide it with hair grafts.
</p>
<p>
I did my due diligence and consulted some other surgeons. No one else believed it was unfixable. I picked a different surgeon for my revisions and got a lot of the problems I had fixed.
</p>
<p>
The point of this is I think you need to seek more opinions and not tacitly accept what you&#39;re surgeon is telling you at this point. You need to talk to Rachel Bluebond-Langner and Marci Bowers and see what they think. I don&#39;t see any reason why colon or peritoneal tissue should scar the same way as a skin graft. There is still hope to cling to!

It would be cool to try to see them, but truthfully it&#39;s unlikely I could ever afford to do so. I only got surgery at all because state Medicaid suddenly covered it here. I&#39;m disabled, there&#39;s no chance of the money being saved up otherwise.
</p>
<p>
It makes things incredibly difficult as it seems like most people refuse to touch anyone else&#39;s work.

What about GoFundMe? I&#39;m sure you&#39;d at least raise enough for the consults and they might agree to take you on as a charity case.

Maybe? I don&#39;t know honestly. I don&#39;t have a lot of people in my life that&#39;d donate to get me in for that. If it wasn&#39;t somehow a pure charity deal, there&#39;s just really no way I could pull it off and I wouldn&#39;t have an idea how to convince them to even do that for me.

i&#39;ve heard RBL&#39;s office fights like hell to ensure their patients are covered and she&#39;s said she&#39;s pretty much never done a single out-of-pocket surgery. there is still hope, and honestly your only two options are accept this current result, or go somewhere to fix it. either way you have to make a decision and move on with your life as you can&#39;t turn back time and being hard on yourself won&#39;t help anything.
</p>
<p>
also im sorry there isn&#39;t adequate support. this surgery is so stigmatized by cis people that a lot of trans women completely shut down when you mention the negatives. there def needs to be more training/support centered around botched surgeries.

I am really sorry it happened to you. I can only empathize and send you all my love and support.  I don&#39;t have a solution unfortunately, but if you need to speak, or just vent, I am here! Don&#39;t hesitate to reach out.

CONSULT WITH MORE DOCTORS!!
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t accept the status quo at this point. Other providers can help you. I understand that the cost seems like an impossible barrier, but I promise you it&#39;s not. Many, many surgeons have resources to help you through the cost, especially for a case like this. Your doctor was human enough to fuck up surgery - they&#39;re human enough to incorrectly think it&#39;s impossible to correct.
</p>
<p>
You will get through this if you get the right medical attention. You can consult with practically anyone in the world for a very limited cost. They can tell you what your options really are.

Call their offices and see what they can do for you. It&#39;ll depend on the provider.

&#34; Yeah, the doctor wants to perform a vaginal obliteration (seriously,  that&#39;s what it&#39;s called) to completely close up my vagina forever.  &#34;

Tbh, if it&#39;s not fixable this is a fair option. Right now things can get stuck inside but then it&#39;s impossible to get out and that could lead to dangerous infections that would require surgery.
</p>
<p>
But I don&#39;t disagree with you here that if I want to hope for something better, seeing someone new likely is required.

That is probably the worst bit of it. People angry because I&#39;m scaring away people or whatever else when I just honestly need the help. Didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d lose friends over something like this.
</p>
<p>
And I don&#39;t want to scare you, or anyone else, but yes it&#39;s possible for all this to be worse. I was told about side effects and issues but no one made it clear something like what happened to me could be a thing. Even my own doctor was shocked by how severe things became.
</p>
<p>
Still, just remember that I&#39;m a very rare case here. It&#39;s part of why I can&#39;t find many people to help to be fair. You likely won&#39;t encounter any of this.

You aren&#39;t rare, welcome to the club. Not the regret club, but the GRS difficulty club. I understand where you&#39;re coming from. It consumes you. You can&#39;t run from it and you don&#39;t just get over it. You have to find the solutions to alleviate the pain both physically and mentally. If you&#39;re on Medicaid you probably have a managed plan. Have you looked into seeking help through an advocate or a case manager?

I didn&#39;t even know that was a thing. What would someone like that do in this situation? I honestly could use someone with my for appointments or whatever else because I&#39;m usually at crying capacity very fast.

Check with your insurance company and see what kind of services they offer. I would imagine most of the larger health insurance companies have something similar.

It&#39;s not quite a company, it&#39;s more of a government thing. Which is a whole headache in general but I suppose not impossible to ask about.
</p>
<p>
But, if the doctor themselves won&#39;t take it, that makes it moot. Which is where it seems like I&#39;m at.

OK, sometimes it&#39;s insurance companies that manage your medicare policy. I don&#39;t know how that breaks down as to who goes where.

</p>
<p>
And there is a FB group called Transgender SRS with about 3k members and additionally looking there may also be an option.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.glbtnearme.org/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
is the largest lgbt database in the US and it may be possible to look up a few places close to you.
</p>
<p>
I hope a few of those work for you.

I&#39;ve tried facebook groups, but honestly, those are dead ends too. In general, any group with just trans people will outright ignore things about failed surgery or even get mad about it. No one wants to even think about it because it could be them.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll look at these other things though, in case there&#39;s something there.

Imo priority may be to deal with a possible infection, and then start dilating again. As said some people use a metal rod, and on
<a href="https://www.soulsource.com/collections/grs-vaginal-dilators" rel="nofollow">Soulsource
</a>
there are also dilators in small sizes. First dilating for depth and later for width may be a good idea.
</p>
<p>
Creams and antibiotics may help with an infection and they could help soften the tissue.
</p>
<p>
And as said trying to install a healthy flora can help fend off infections. Its also included in the first link, a number of surgeons recommend it. Its included in unsweetened yoghurt.
</p>
<p>
A long term strategy usually is to try to install a natural flora, and after all is healed, phase out douching eventually. Permanent douching can leave the tissue prone to infections.
</p>
<p>
Do you have a supportive ObGyn where you are, or a NP ? Asking at local support groups may be an idea, they may know a few med persons who are aquainted with trans peoples treatment and could also be helpful.

I had a pelvic floor therapist that was really kind, but that was about it. I never got to seeing an ObGyn because, well, there was nothing for them to be able to see or do anything with.
</p>
<p>
Even looking at the Soulsource&#39;s smallest sizes, I no longer think they&#39;d fit. I legitimately don&#39;t think I could get something the size of a pencil in there anymore. Not to mention the excruciating pain it would cause.

They can as said also help with prescribing creams and antibiotics. Cis people also have issues like vaginitis and infections, and an ObGyn who has experience with the treatment of trans people may be helpful. A number of people said they found someone who was knowledgeable and willing to help. Some consulted surgeons and a local med person helped them do things according to their advise.
</p>
<p>
And as said some people used a small metal rod first. They may not fit now and it may be painful but that may improve with meds like antibiotics and creams.

I suppose I&#39;ll have to send some messages to try and see if anyone will take me on for this. I&#39;m really unsure who would work best in my area, especially with wait times and covid. But it can&#39;t hurt to try.

I personally would reach out and ask a number of local med people. And I would also ask at support groups, someone there may also have had a surgery and could give a referral.
</p>
<p>
And I would also contact a number of other surgeons.

Im so terribly sorry. I wish that there was some way to help you other than kind words on my end. I hope with all my heart things get better for you, or at least easier. Maybe some doctor somewhere has experience that can help you sort this out. At the very least I hope you can stop being in pain and find peace, even sometimes.

Currently as it seems function is impossible, pain and aesthetics seem like the focus points purely because, well. If I have to be stuck with this, I&#39;d like it to at least not look obviously bad to partners.

It really sounds like never going back to this surgeon is the way to go. I hope you’re able to find other professionals that accept your insurance because this person clearly did you wrong.
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry to hear that this happened to you and that you’re lacking support. I wish you the best in finding the emotional and medical support you need! You definitely deserve better than what you’re currently getting

I don’t know if any I say will be helpful, but I’m glad that you used this post to express the pain you’re feeling rather than bottling it up. I’m so sorry that you feel alone in this situation. And I’m so sorry you’re having to live with both physical and emotional pain as a result of a poor surgical outcome. I’ve not personally had GCS myself yet (or my consult) so I feel unable to provide you w/ resources on support groups since I’m still learning stuff myself.
</p>
<p>
I won’t refuse to speak to you. I’m sure how helpful I can be, but I’d like to offer what support I can.

I am so sorry that you are dealing with this. But I am pretty sure that a peritoneal revision or colon could fix your vagina cavity (with a reputable surgeon) im aware that you dont have tbe money now, but what about creating a go fund me and telling your story in the internet so we can donate money to you

From discussions with my surgeon, it&#39;s not really possible to fix now. My body has managed massive internal scarring that constricts itself to extreme levels. There&#39;s no reason to think it won&#39;t happen again if we make any other attempts.
</p>
<p>
In all honesty, I also don&#39;t think I could emotionally handle trying to do this all over again if it failed once more. That would break me too far to reasonably recover. I&#39;m unsure it&#39;s worth the risk.

Hum but, colon or peritoneal tissue have nothing to do with the scars you got right now, and that tissue cannot form scars itself, it is not like epitelial tissue (penis skin). Also, please, go to another surgeon, yours does not seem to be really helpful on this.

The issue would be where I already have depth now, the scar would have to be &#34;relaxed&#34; to allow anything else to go there. It would tense up around anything that was put there like it did before. Or at least that was how it was explained.
</p>
<p>
Basically was told even if we tried, sex would be so beyond painful it wouldn&#39;t be worth it.

Thats why dilation is necessary, to relax the muscles and stretch the skin surrounding colon or ppt. I had colon, and my vagina can be tight, but after dilation it relaxes

That&#39;s my problem, it&#39;s so tight not even a dilator can get inside. Not even the smallest one we could find, or someone&#39;s pinky. I doubt even a pencil could get in there without it being so horrendously painful I couldn&#39;t stand it.
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s the point of stretching if it would take somehow literally using lidocaine for lube?

Girl. After they RE-open you, and put the colon or peritoneal tissue there,  YOULL HAVE ENOUGH space for dilation. And it will be painful for the first month, after that, it would only hurt when you size up dilators. Happened to all of us, and forget about your CURRENT hole. After revision, it will be completely different. There&#39;s hope❤

Maybe I&#39;m missing something here. Like, they&#39;d just completely remove whatever was in there now so it&#39;s not even there to do this or something?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d still need to somehow also get my previous opening to, well, open. I assume? Maybe I don&#39;t understand the procedure well enough. I can&#39;t see this working unless somehow literally everything can be removed and basically try again fresh.
</p>
<p>
And even then of course, it&#39;s scary because if it went wrong the second time I don&#39;t know if I could emotionally handle it right? Like, if I can barely hang on now, I couldn&#39;t if that happened.

Yes they do a fresh hole basically and put the new tissue there, but Id advise you to look for a different and reputable surgeon.

I guess I would have to try. If somehow everything could be fresh, entrance area included because it&#39;d basically have to be, I suppose it&#39;s a possibility. Just really not looking forward to that recovery if it also turned out bad.

This and scar softening can be done with corticosteroid creams or injections (like Kenalog). Very commonly used to treat hypertrophic or keloid scars.

This would be lovely, but as it stands I don&#39;t think we could even reach the area to do that as treatment.
</p>
<p>
If anything, seeing that there are way more options than what I was even offered, it&#39;s very clear I need to try to see a different surgeon at a bare minimum.

Yes, there is reason to think that.   Neither peritoneal nor alimentary tract grafts have the healing tendency to contract like skin does.   Is your scarring keloidal?

I am unsure, the surgeon had explained it as being something to a level she&#39;d never seen before.

Internally, there&#39;s a ring that is so tight that pushing past it at all is torture. And the entrance to everything is like, so tight it&#39;s trying to pull itself into the vagina as weird as that sounds. (I can confirm that just by trying to touch, it&#39;s the strangest thing.)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never had this kind of issue with a surgery before. If anything my scars take a long time to heal, not heal to this extreme.

I feel the person who suggested a patient advocate had a good idea.  This is a thing you could not have caused, a serious complication.   Is the state covered the cause, they will surely cover the fix.  And it really should be a far more minor fix than the first go around, really I&#39;m sure you need a second opinion.  Advocate would I&#39;ve no doubt help you find that.

They would cover the fix, that&#39;s not a problem. The issue is that no other surgeon who does this work will take my insurance in this state, so it doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;d be supportive.

I&#39;m a doctor, but I don&#39;t do anything like reconstructive surgical medicine or hormone therapy. I follow this sub for my own education and to better understand my patients.

Do you potentially have an autoimmune disease? Any personal or family history of chronic fatigue syndrome, connective tissue disorders, or anything &#34;kinda different&#34;? I tend to see people with bizarre conditions that no one else could figure out and were instead labeled as &#34;fibro&#34; or &#34;psychosomatic disorder&#34; or some other non-committal nonsense (most corporate employed Docs lack time to do a proper investigation)... you might have something underlying your extreme bodily response to surgical scarring. It&#39;s my experience that even great surgeons have virtually zero knowledge of medical conditions outside the basics, especially things like autoimmune or genetic diagnoses. This might be worth investigating. Feel free to contact me privately and I&#39;ll see what I can do to help you out or at least suggest possible people to help. :)

I didn&#39;t have SRS but FFS and butcher and murderer Bart Van de Ven botched me. He did it on purpose cause I didn&#39;t want my entire face worked on. It&#39;s been over a year and I still retain the damages he has done to me and I have my okay days and my horrible days. I don&#39;t know what to suggest but to let all your emotions out and cry as much as you need. These failed surgeries definitely change our future for the worse but we have no choice but to continue living. I also lost my job and because of it could not get any sort of revision done and to be frank I&#39;m scared. I hope you feel better soon and find a surgeon who can fix your issues. I&#39;d not go back to the surgeon who failed your surgery twice. Good luck!

Atm the following might be an option :
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://marcibowers.com/transfem/gav/post-op-care/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
were some hints concerning complications,
</p>
<p>
and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ada9t5/nsfw_finally_my_first_orgasm_since_bottom_surgery/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
were a number of additional hints by someone who also had issues.
</p>
<p>
And trying to install a natural flora by eating probiotic yoghurt immediately. It can help repopulate the digestive tract with a natural flora after antibiotics etc., and also a neovagina. Many people said it helped fend off an infection.
</p>
<p>
Trying to solve issues with infections first may be necessary now, and step by step trying to dilate.
</p>
<p>
Some people use a metal rod for dilation, only use rounded ones at the end, and they should not be too small in diameter. Use a condom and safe materials etc. Maybe it would be possible to have one custom made of stainless steel, it should not be much at local crafts places.
</p>
<p>
Talking it through with your med persons in case may be an option.
</p>
<p>
Asking another surgeon about their opinion may be a good idea.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
might be an option, Wittenberg may be another possibilitiy. It may be possible to at least ask for advice. Their contacts are in the wiki.
</p>
<p>
And some people who had issues with scar contracting try different lubes ... coconut oil has small molecules and can make for a softening, some people try estrogen cream,  testosterone cream could also be tried, and some people carefully use Suporns method of dynamic dilation.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fayd3p/srs_with_dr_suporn_pdf_5th_edition/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
it was described, and also effects of coocnut oil ( P. 136 : &#34;it penetrates and moisturises the skin it&#39;s said to accelerate healing times considerably&#34;. Its not sterile though so considering when to use it may be necessary. I personally have used it after electrolysis and never had issues, and there was a very noticeable difference with and without with healing and also swelling etc.)
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com//r/DrWillPowers/wiki/compounded-medicines#wiki_genital_atrophy_reversal_cream" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
was a hint to cream :
</p>
<p>
&#34;Post SRS it can be used weekly during a dilation session (by coating the dilator) and sometimes can help achieve additional depth due to increasing tissue elasticity. &#34;
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/hqp13c/im_a_partner_of_an_awesome_transwoman_but_im/fz1twnb/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
might be some additional hints. And looking into Contractubex and Cicaplast may also be an option.
</p>
<p>
Hope you find a few ways that work for you.
</p>

<p>
Imo surgeons should test for this and discuss measurements for people who have issues. People who know they scar heavily could either use less scarring techniques, or try to do a few things like integrating some features from a dynamic dilation.

The other surgeons to potentially see are a possibility, but everything else from flora to lubes can&#39;t really do me much of anything as I can&#39;t even physically get something inside there under any capacity. Seriously, a needle would almost be too thick at this point. That is the extremety of the tightening.

Well if things are infected they may also be swollen. Using some creams and possibly also antibiotics may help with swelling and they may help soften the tissue. From this point on, as said, some people used a small metal rod and worked their way up from there. Talking possible meds through with other surgeons and as said also with a supportive ObGyn etc. may be a good idea.

I&#39;m not sure where to even get a rod small enough to fit anymore, and I suspect it would take extreme amounts of pain medications as well.
</p>
<p>
If things are going to hurt this badly, it&#39;s been my thought that there&#39;s little point in trying to maintain depth. What&#39;s the point if I could never use it without excruciating pain you know? I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s possible to make things not being painful a reality and I lack the mental fortitude to dialate while feeling this terrible if there&#39;s not a clear chance of things getting better.

Well the pain usually is caused either by an infection or by granulation. If those are improved by meds like antibiotics and creams, it should be possible to dilate again, first with small dilators only for depth.

I suppose, but how is that done if we can&#39;t even get inside?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not just internally now either, the entrance to everything has literally pulled in on itself to make it so there&#39;s like, barely a pin sized amount of room. I am unsure to describe how extreme this is, I&#39;ve never read or been able to find someone with this level of an issue.
</p>
<p>
I very much want to be able to manage something, but with covid... it feels like by the time I could see a doctor for a second opinion it&#39;d be too late to even consider with how rapidly it progressed. It was less than two weeks after the second revision where I tried to fix this before everything became basically inaccessible.

Imagine a muscle cramp. There are meds to relieve cramps. There are antibiotics, and it may be possible to apply some creams step by step.
</p>
<p>
Things were not as they are, and it may be possible to make for improvements.
</p>
<p>
You could send an email to various other surgeons and ask what could be done, and also phone a few. They could give hints to meds, and they could give hints concerning what else could be done.
</p>
<p>
And I personally would also ask a few local ObGyns.
