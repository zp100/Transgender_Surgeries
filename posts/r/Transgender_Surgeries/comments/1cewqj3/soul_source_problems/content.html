Hi again, when I was at PAI I got two dilators, size 1 and 2. I was told to go with soul source if I wanted the whole set of sizing, but there’s an issue…
</p>
<p>
The soul source dilators are curved. The PAI ones are not. I’ve been having horrible issues getting the curved end in. When I start to push it in, it feels like it wants to twist (I was told I’m supposed to have the curve pointing up), and I can’t get it in far AT ALL. This is with the size 1 dilator.
</p>
<p>
I worry that I’m gonna tear something by forcing it in, but I know I’m going to have to use them for sizes 3 and 4, but I don’t know what to do. I don’t even get how to insert it properly
</p>

Def curve up, and some slight twisting (or perhaps rocking is a better word) can actually be really helpful to get the tip through the hole in your pelvic floor muscle.  Don&#39;t force, massage.  Pull out a bit and try to go in again.  This helps to draw in more lube.  Whatever you put on the tip, gets wiped off by the time you&#39;re just a couple inches in and it gets sticky and painful.  Massaging it in and out helps redistribute the slippery.

Hmm
</p>
<p>
The straight one just goes in so much easier. Maybe I need to find a set of straight dilators
