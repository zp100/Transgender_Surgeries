The people who have complications are more likely to come back with discussions (often repeatedly) than the people who have perfectly normal results and don&#39;t post about it at all or make a single &#34;yeah it was all great&#34; comment.
</p>
<p>
That applies to every surgeon.

Agreed 100%, I myself picked a less than popular surgeon and am very happy with the results. Just seems there would be a few positive posts floating around in the last year or so.

And I wouldn&#39;t even say Chet is a less than popular surgeon, he performs SRS 4 or 5 times a week. That&#39;s a lot of people and yet very people complain of complications considering the number of surgeries he does.
</p>
<p>
I would choose him again.

Oh I wasn’t saying Chet was less than popular. The reason I am asking this is that he is so popular. I was talking about my surgeon Dr Schechter being unpopular.
</p>
<p>
I got a lot of crap for choosing him but would recommend him in a heartbeat.

I guessed you weren&#39;t implying he&#39;s unpopular, he&#39;s after all probably the surgeon at the moment doing the most number of surgeries per year.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know anything about Schechter but I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy... 😊

I don’t have exact numbers but I’m pretty certain that Brassard beats them all for the most surgeries per day...

From what I’ve heard, he even pushes the envelope to the point of doing them under narcosis and epidural instead of GA.... I wonder if the old saying that quantity doesn’t fit well with quality is true in that particular case...

Anyway...

yeah he rarely does GA. Each surgery is about 2.5 hours.
</p>
<p>
Having been under GA for 7 hours for FFS, I&#39;m quite glad not to have been put under a second time for SRS. I couldn&#39;t even focus enough to read a book for weeks bc my cognition was so mangled after FFS. SRS recovery has been much harder, but at least my brain has kept working!

I hear you... I’ve been put under twice in 5 weeks (6+ hours each) and inherited a severe case of AADD, this in 2011 and I still suffer from it to this day... :(
</p>
<p>
Has for my previous comment about quantity over quality, maybe doing so many bring an extra level of experience that allows great results...?

Well I know for a fact Chet does SRS usually five times a week, maybe some weeks he might do a large FFS procedure and only do SRS four times. This was a question I specifically asked.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not going to argue over who does the most operations but I don&#39;t think any surgeon is likely to be doing more SRS ops than Chet and it&#39;s specifically SRS ops I&#39;m refering to.

Brassard does more and has done more in his career. Last I heard he has surpassed 5,000. This is because his surgeries are much shorter, less than half the time Chettawut takes. Not a reflection of quality, just how they each do it.

Because he&#39;s one of the most experienced surgeons in the world, experience gained during a time when hospitals in the US refused to perform any type of surgery on transsexuals.
</p>
<p>
I went to him and cannot recommend anyone do so. The vast majority of his patients urinate out of their vaginas and are too ignorant of their own anatomy to know this is incorrect and unhealthy. He literally communicated this to me in writing after another surgeon who examined me thought it was the result of a fistula. His outcomes are intended to approximate a serious complication...

Not sure that the vast urinate from their vaginas...? What do you mean by that?  I’m a chett patient... I urinate from the inner labia, but since it’s swollen and closed. It feels to be partly coming from “inside” the vagina. But it’s really just hitting the wall of the vaginal canal... nothing more. How’s yours coming from the vagina?

How would urine be hitting the wall of your vaginal canal if the urethral opening is in the correct location? Is it doing a full 180 from the meatus? This is what I mean by ignorance. I suggest you look at a diagram of a vulva.

Thanks for the clarification! It did get me worried (and other girls whom I share the same whatsapp group with). We checked weather we were peeing from the inside of the vagina. But the same girl referred to me as ignorant and not knowing my anatomy well.  I also had to look into the pictures I took after the surgery to see if my catheter was placed inside the vaginal canal. But wasn’t the case, else I wouldn’t have been able to dilate.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t do research on the anatomy prior to my surgery with Chett (which is something I regret a little). I knew he’s one of the most celebrated surgeons internationally. People all over the globe go there for surgery, so any complications that could occur is hard luck, and could be tackled with revisions.
<br>
I’m 7 weeks post op, on a heavy dilation schedule because I happen to be tight.  But I’m very happy with the esthetic result so far.

Ah you’re very kind!  I’ve had like a bone-thing closing my vagina in the morning. When I lay my legs flat and parallel, it disappears... but it shows again after I bend my legs for dilation (so I lubricate and get my fingers under it). It goes away after the second and third dilation, but is always present in the morning. I’ve been wondering about other dilators, because I’m not super happy with those glass dilators.  Your recommendation is awesome!!!  Do you get to twist those 180 degrees once reaching maximum depth?  I dilate 6 hours a day!! As per chetts recommendation... and I can certainly see improvement.

I think Chettawut has very successfully positioned himself in recent years as not only a solid alternative to the western penile inversion method, but also a more affordable alternative to the Suporn Clinic.
</p>
<p>
I think it is important to recognise that first in order to properly contextualise recent criticism of him, or the practice. Yes, he positions himself as an alternative to the west in terms of technique, but this also flows over into the kind of service he offers. You’re safe. Everything is above board. It’s a clinical, hygienic practice. However, it feels very different to what one might experience, or expect in the West. As such, some people can feel disappointed, or let down by the service. This is especially relevant in relation to after care.  It’s not a matter of quality, just a matter of expectations.
</p>
<p>
This, coupled with the fact that he has positioned himself as a somewhat more affordable alternative to the Suporn Clinic, can create certain potential mishaps in terms of expectations, which, really have very little to do with his proficiency as a surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery with him in 2017. Though I am careful to appreciate how fortunate I was in terms of my aesthetics, he’s a generally very competent and considerate surgeon.

Yeah, seconding that he does 3-4 surgeries a week and there are barely any reddit posts. I&#39;m a chett patient with no complications. Tbqh, most of the complication posts are things a surgeon can&#39;t control such as failed skin grafts, granulation, etc. He did a great job with me, was extremely empathetic and kind, and the nurse aftercare was amazing.
</p>
<p>
No offense, reddit, but before my surgery I was terrified of Chett and second guessing and panicking because this was one of the few places to get information and I&#39;m gonna tell you reddit is NOT a good representation of the experience with him. He&#39;s done over 3,000 surgeries and there are maybe barely over 100 posts? Less than half of that with photos and not even 10 with 1-2 year results?
</p>
<p>
Not saying don&#39;t trust reddit posts, just saying to keep in mind that those posts are 3% of his patients and at least half of those posters are happy or content.
