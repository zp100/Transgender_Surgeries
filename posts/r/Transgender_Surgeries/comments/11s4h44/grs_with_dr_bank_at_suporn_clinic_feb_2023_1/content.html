<p>
I&#39;ll write a more detailed post in 6-12 months time, but for now, I&#39;ll post my 1 month post-op photographs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
About me:
</strong>
non-binary transfemme; I started HRT 2.5 years ago. I&#39;ve wanted bottom surgery for about as long as I can remember. Since I was very young, my genitalia felt like an alien species attached to me.
</p>
<p>
For a decade before I transitioned, I used CBT (the kink) as an outlet. It was only as I begun to discover myself that I finally stopped viewing my body through the lens of a kink. The kink was a cry for help, but it was the only way I could make sense of the disconnect in my brain between my inner-understanding of my body and the reality.
</p>
<p>
As I begun to transition in 2020 (good time for reflection 😅), I finally felt the weight lift off my shoulders; I could finally be in control of my body and my destiny.
</p>
<p>
After several months of researching surgeons, I emailed Suporn Clinic. Dr Suporn&#39;s along with Dr Bank&#39;s approaches were matched with my goals: aesthetics, sensation, and use of as much donor tissue as possible to create a vagina that fit within the realm of natal variance.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this being in the middle of global pandemic, this reduced my ability to fly without great difficulty. Thailand had closed its borders.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t want to hang around, I wanted to speedrun my transition! I decided to book in FFS in 2021. This was a massive improvement in my confidence, but it only made the disconnecting inertia with my genitals worse.
</p>
<p>
Throughout 2021, I had tried booking in twice with Surpon Clinic, around this time Thailand had relaxed its entry requirements. Unfortunately, on both attempts I failed to get a date.
</p>
<p>
In early 2022, I would refresh the clinic website daily to see when new dates would be coming. Finally, after much perseverance, I got a date 1 years time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
This gave me plenty of time to start saving:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Surgery with Dr Bank: 575,000 THB / £13,760
</p>
<p>
Hotel costs: 69,977 THB / £1,674
</p>
<p>
Food and travel costs for 1 month for 2x people: £400
</p>
<p>
Flight costs for 2x people: £2150
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Experience
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Staying in the hotel is rather fun. Popping down for breakfast each morning and chatting with other trans folks and their support partners. It was like a cool queer commune!
</p>
<p>
The hospital staff are lovely, extraordinarily dedicated and caring. There is a language barrier, but with Google Translate it never felt too tricky to convey if I needed something. The hospital food is less ideal: there is a Western and a Thai menu (I opted for the latter), which started off tasting pretty good, but eventually the smell of blood, cleaning chemicals, and the total lack of any flavour makes the food extremely unappetising. I have a psychosomatic reaction to even thinking about it now, simply the trauma of the smell of 🥴.
</p>
<p>
When Dr Bank took the packing off the new vagina, I barely felt any sense of emotion. It was just like my brain finally stopped having the fear response to my own body, and finally relaxed. I&#39;ve continued to feel this calming zen for almost my entire recovery so far. The absence of stress, the beauty of my body aligning with oneself, the inner calm. It&#39;s real 10/10 stuff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pain
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I am very lucky (or the decades of CBT prior have elevated my pain tolerance to a ridiculous level) but I&#39;ve not found there to be a significant amount of pain in hospital, or through recovery currently. At most, I needed ibuprofen + paracetamol and I&#39;ve only taken tramadol once.
</p>
<p>
My approach has always been to take as few painkillers as I can get away with, and to not need them from pretty much the moment I was discharged from hospital has been really lucky.
</p>
<p>
That being said, I maybe should have taken a couple more tramadol, as there was a period of about two weeks where all my nerves started reconnecting: a fuzzy fun feeling, moving up to a cattle-prod poking you over and over and over again for hours. Adding the antiseptic creams and washes to your skin only exacerbates this sensation. I had to stop using antiseptics early, and heavily reduce my use of silverderm cream.
</p>
<p>
Pain mostly resonates from being unable to sit without a doughnut pillow. It&#39;s like every position is sitting on a pointy rock heading up your arse. As swelling reduces, this gets easier and easier each day (I&#39;m writing this from my office chair without any issues now!).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dilation
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dilation is a weird discomfort. I had never really been keen on penetration for a variety of reasons I won&#39;t get into, but the first few times I experienced dilation... I hated it. It was awful. I disliked the pressure, the feeling, it made me extremely angry how this would be my life now.
</p>
<p>
...but I realised that I was beating myself up over something I&#39;d never done before. I could hardly expect to be excellent at something I&#39;d only done a few times.
</p>
<p>
Today, a month in, and dilation is something I really don&#39;t mind doing. I&#39;ve watched through so many films and TV shows that have been in my to-do list, that now I really look forward to it!
</p>
<p>
What terrified me about dilation was the potential for hours long time to reach depth, with excruciating pain attached to it. While I cannot rule out if scar contraction will make this my reality in a few months time (as this is apparently something that can happen), for now, my average session time-to-depth is 6-10 minutes. I can usually shower, reach depth, dilate with both the medium and the large, and shower and clean within 40-45 minutes.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been working at home since I arrived back, so it hasn&#39;t been a huge burden for me so far. When I&#39;m busier in April and May, perhaps I&#39;ll have a different view?
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
One month post, and I&#39;m back to walking 10,000 steps a day, going out to a coffee shop, eating a nice meal in a restaurant, going to the shops to pick up supplies: I want to try and regain the muscle strength I lost in hospital, and to brighten up my days. It improves my mental health no end!
</p>
<p>
I have tried to remain really positive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Issues
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dr Bank is brisk and to the point. His English is good, but sometimes my inability to convey a specific detail would cause a lot of confusion. I often found the clinic and Dr Bank would contradict each other, be it via a recommendation of a certain medication, or when to begin or stop something in the healing process.
</p>
<p>
I had tiny bit of necrosis around my clitoris which cleared up after a week. This has not impacted sensation and is a common complication. There was also a little more necrosis on inside the left inner-labia, but this cleared up after a week as well.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>

Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have either here or via DM. There are no silly questions!

I feel like you. I&#39;m trans fem, questioning being nb, my crotch always felt alien too and I&#39;ve had vaginoplasty 5 weeks ago in France. Plus my result looks very similar to yours hehe. I&#39;ve had a middle depth (no scrotum graft for vaginal depth, (because I&#39;m attracted to women and wasn&#39;t sure I was ready for the complexity of full depth). But you&#39;re much more active than I am!

Cock and ball torture framed through castration / eunuch fantasy fiction that played with &#34;forced feminisation&#34;. You must realise that the concept of transition and trans representation was almost zero when I was growing up. It was the first thing I found when searching on the internet when I was around age 8 or 9 that I could identify with, because I didn&#39;t know I could do anything about my gender.
</p>
<p>
CBT was an outlet for something that confused me and frustrated me, it was only 15-20 years after discovering it that I realised it was essentially a form of self-harm and not helpful to continue with.
</p>
<p>
Viewing yourself through the lens of a kink, only seeing your body through sexualisation: this is not helpful to your mental health. It was frustrating to me that this is how things started, and I&#39;m really happy for younger trans people growing up today who have better representation, access to resources and, hopefully, healthcare. Gotta fight for it still, sadly, but hopefully decades from now, things will be even better.

I’m getting my masters now and I’d be one month post op like you in the future. This gives me hope that I can still do my masters and finish on time. Luckily I’m walking distance from uni but the sitting down for 3-4 hour lectures is mad. I’ll have to see about getting extensions on assignments cause I’m sure with dilating and still healing that’ll consume time.

I was able to sit down in a coffee shop on a wooden chair for a few hours yesterday. I actually surprised myself by being able to do it; I even skipped the 2nd of the three daily dilations!
</p>
<p>
Of course, every time I go out and do a 10k walk, visit friends and go places: my canal tightens; my TTD goes up; and inflammation increases — I&#39;m trying to balance how often I go out and exert myself.
</p>
<p>
I was personally able to walk without too much stiffness around week 4-5, and now we&#39;re near week 6, I&#39;m sitting fine, walking well, moving a lot less carefully - it&#39;s almost like being back to normal, until you stretch or lift something and you remember nooOoOpE!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also not been doing a lot of work since I got back. Mostly working from home on a few projects a few hours a day, but otherwise taking it easy. My April and May will be much busier, so I want to ensure I&#39;m really well healed by then.
</p>
<p>
So you might be okay. Perhaps it&#39;s a bit of stress needing to be sitting for a long time if it&#39;s still painful, but it could be doable!

Good to know. I don’t see myself walking 10K. Just to and from uni. Maybe mini errands like groceries. Study at the library if needed. Def don’t want to injure myself. I will try not to skip dilating either and look into assignment extensions so I can balance everything.

Hi! This post was a major factor for me choosing Dr. Bank. I&#39;m currently in contact with them and hoping to get a slot next year. I would be really interested in hearing about your healing experience, if you&#39;re ok with that?? Thx!!

I saw your post from awhile back your mention of CBT. I am also into CBT, though have paused as I&#39;m hoping to have SRS soon and don&#39;t want to take any risks. Would you be up for chatting? Haven&#39;t met any other trans women with this particular hobby before.
</p>
<p>
Hope your recovery is going well!

How difficult was it to get an appointment there? I know their surgery slots tend to go quickly after they release each batch, did you have to try more than once to get a surgery date?

A couple times in 2020-2021, but I missed out on these, combined with the pandemic limiting long-distance travel. I would refresh their website every day to check when they would next release dates, and, eventually, around Jan/Feb 2022 I secured a date for Feb 2023.
</p>
<p>
The small upside of waiting was Thailand opened its borders again to tourists. If I had visited in 2021/2022, I would have had to quarantine in the hospital for (iirc) an extra week, at a cost of £1,000. I didn&#39;t have to do that for my date fortunately!
</p>
<p>
Do make sure to make a patient profile with the clinic if you&#39;re interested in a date. Regularly check the website for when new dates will be opened up, and just make sure you&#39;re there the second they release. Good luck!

Just wondering, do you have to commit anything when you book your surgery date?
</p>
<p>
If it takes more than 1 year before booking and the surgery date itself, I am thinking if I should book the surgery when I have 80-100% of the required amount. By the time I go for the surgery, I should be able to pay in full.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to wait for years to save up and years on the waitlist when I have the money.....

When you get a surgery date you want, you need to pay a deposit of 115,000 THB / £2,770 (this may change depending on pricing in future years of course).
</p>
<p>
Around about the same time, I booked my return flights (economy going to Bangkok, and business class return for 2x).
</p>
<p>
So I would ideally want around £3000-6000 available right now to book in depending on your flight costs, if you&#39;re bringing a partner etc.
</p>
<p>
You can then pretty much keep saving as much as you can throughout the year. You can pay the final balance a month before you arrive in Thailand for surgery.
</p>
<p>
Hotel costs were paid for with card when I arrived. Food costs are very variable depending on what source: hotel room service is 2-3x more than it would cost on Grab (like Uber Eats), and Grab is around 1.5-2x more than eating out on the street.
</p>
<p>
I used Grab a lot, it&#39;s inexpensive and convenient and nothing beats a human on a moped delivering you fresh coconuts for £1.50 in 20 minutes.
</p>
<p>
I saved up over the course of a year using Monzo 10x roundups on my bank (I saved £2000 this way without trying), I would put £500 into my Suporn savings pot every month. The shortfall at the end I ended up selling a little ETH and BTC I had bought 5 years ago.
</p>
<p>
If you have the majority of the money already, then I would pay for what you need now, and stick the rest in a savings account with the highest rate you can get.

Considering this is only a month, she looks really well. You must be really pleased. Thank you for sharing your experience and information, I found it particularly helpful. Hope your recovery continues to go really well.
</p>
<p>
Did you have a second choice or any UK surgeons your were considering or was Dr Bank your first and only choice? (I&#39;m also UK based and considering to wait for the NHS or look into Suporn).

I was on the waiting list for a couple years for Dr Bellringer at Parkside. I think his results are really good and have friends who’ve been to him. I went with Suporn in the end because I wanted to just book a date in and plan my life around it.
</p>
<p>
Of course, about two weeks before I was due to leave for Thailand, I got a call from Parkside offering me a consultation (lol good timing NHS).  I had already paid for everything by that point!
</p>
<p>
While I could have paid privately to go with Bellringer in the UK, the cost was about the same overall, and ultimately, Dr Bank is one of the several top GRS surgeons in the world (not saying Bellringer isn’t getting good results, but Suporn is publishing papers on this and if you’re going to pay then why not).
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Other things that swayed it: I love Thai food and have been there previously, and it ended up being quite a fun little holiday in parts ✨
</p>
<p>
If you’re happy to wait of course, then £0 and staying in the UK is a very good sell!

Your results look wonderful so far!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m trying to decide between getting it done on the NHS or going to see Dr. Bank. You said you&#39;ve done a lot of research on UK surgeons and beyond - would you say money and waiting lists aside Suporn clinic is a significant step up from NHS?

<p>
Bellringer and Rashid by extension have an adapted penile inversion technique that borrows elements of Suporn&#39;s: using a form of peno-scrotal flap / scrotal island and tunica vaginalis.
</p>
<p>
There are cosmetic and positioning differences: Suporn&#39;s positioning would be more typical of a natal vagina, vs. PI which tends to be higher.
</p>
<p>
The UK and Thai surgeons have different cosmetic approaches as well, so it&#39;s up to you who you prefer the results of more. For me, non-inversion enabled more customisation in the primary surgery around labia size (puffiness or flatness).
</p>
<p>
Suporn also gives a free cosmetic surgery revision within 2 years - which means I can have the top and the bottom of the labias joined together to make them appear similar to a natal equivalent. This would presumably cost money as the NHS would not pay for this unless there was a medical problem.
</p>
<p>
Depth is limited by your OG anatomy with PI, whereas Suporn&#39;s technique is limited by the space up to your pubic bone. Some end up with huge depth gains despite their small size, although this wasn&#39;t something I cared much for.
</p>
<p>
I would imagine sensation is pretty much the same between the two, and ultimately we&#39;ll never know. However what I did find reassuring around Suporn&#39;s/Bank&#39;s technique was he uses as much of the original tissues as he can - so much so there is something called the &#34;chon organ&#34; essentially an extra bit of the glans from the penis which is buried under the new clitoris. If, in the unlikely event you were to have full loss of the clitoris, you could still retain sensation via the chon organ, and in a revision this could be repositioned. I do not know what the NHS doctors do to prevent this, Dr Bellringer reports full loss at 2%. I tried getting a number from Suporn, but I just got &#34;it&#39;s very rare&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Healing from PI is supposed to be much faster than non-inversion. Friends who have gone to Bellringer have bounced back very quickly within 3-4 weeks. Suporn uses a scrotal graft in the canal, this creates a significant challenge to healing and dilation comfort, as this graft is constantly trying to contract. It makes dilations harder, although my experience has not been too bad so far. Most sessions are pretty routine and without event, however I hear that 2-4 months from now I can experience very significant scar contractions...who knows, I&#39;ve had a smooth journey so far!
</p>
<p>
So ultimately, is it worth it is up to you. UK surgeons have their benefits: local, free if you&#39;re on the list, longer term complications can be sorted locally, language barrier isn&#39;t an issue, generally less stress not needing to travel 14-18 hours there and back, and less long term healing pains and maintenance.
</p>
<p>
The downsides are less cosmetic control, potentially sensation could be impacted with complications, positioning to a degree.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s why I never say there is &#34;the best surgeon&#34; because that&#39;s a very personal opinion, and there is no certainty in medicine.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps, let me know if you have any more questions.

this is so incredibly true.

i was there in June of 2022, and i still am in contact with some of the friends i made there.

all in all, it was an A+ experience, and Dr Bank is an artist

It’s a really nice atmosphere and everyone is very helpful. I enjoyed the chats over breakfast, movie nights, going out to restaurants. A very supportive space that allows you to talk about vaginanxiety for a month without anyone batting an eyelid ☺️

Congratz on your results!! This is my #1 GRS surgeon right now because his aesthetics are absolutely incredible. Did dr. Banks tell you what kinda of depth was guaranteed? I’m very small and I’m worried about this.

I didn’t really care about depth, so I was just like… ‘I don’t mind, whatever you feel would be safe and provide the smoothest healing’. I think he said around 5-6” is typical. It’s entirely based on how large your inner anatomy is: the space between the vagina and the pelvic bone basically, rather than your old appendage size.

I&#39;m gonna be financing my surgery with him probably so knowing that it was actually far cheaper than I was expecting for 2 people to stay for a month helps. One thing you might not be able to answer is if the clinic or hotel provided any vegan options for food. It&#39;s essentially my biggest worry in going over there rn 😅 looking good for only a month post op btw 😁

I was staying in the ’one bedroom suite’ as well, if you were staying in the double rooms then you’d save a bit more. I wanted the larger room as I wanted to make my sleeping space for sleep, and the living room space could have a dilation station in it.
</p>
<p>
I’m not vegan, and I only recall one woman who was there who decided to allow fish into the diet. I think the reasoning is a lot of food has fermented fish sauce added to it as a salt/flavour enhancer. It seems hard to ascertain what ingredients are in everything, especially if you’re eating out or ordering on Grab.
</p>
<p>
There was another woman who seemed to order a lot from (iirc) Jimmy’s Salads, she said it was good, but I’d probably go out of my mind if I had to order from there every day.
</p>
<p>
The hotel room service maybe has some vegan options, but I tended to use Grab for everything, where it’s hard to figure out what ingredients are in what.

I think I&#39;d opt for the single room suite too for the same reason tbh.

Do you remember the name of the hotel by any chance? Also I agree, ordering the same thing every day would drive me nuts 😅

Rattanachol Hotel. it&#39;s the hotel the clinic has an agreement with. tell the clinic what type of room you want, and they will make the reservation, you don&#39;t do it yourself.
</p>
<p>
and i highly recommend the one room suite, for the very same reason as above.

As of right now I&#39;m booked in for ffs in October and will be financing that through a company specifically geared towards financing medical costs. Thats not necessary though, just take out any loan you can get from a reliable source with as low an Apr as you can get. I think this companies is lime 9.9% which is pretty good. I haven&#39;t actually contacted them yet though, this is going off the advice of my surgeons admin team but financing a surgery works pretty much like any other loan as far as I can tell.

Looks great! Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
If you are up for sharing, I am curious, how many times did you apply to the Suporn lottery before receiving a surgery date. I have tried three times with no luck and am just trying to get an idea of how long it has taken for others. Thanks much.

I know I&#39;m a little late but ur results are incredible and I had a few questions please describe in detail if it&#39;s not rude to ask  1. Kinda weird but what does it feel like to pee now I can&#39;t find an answer and I&#39;m really curious 2. Do you feel more confident and if so how so 3. Another kinda weird one but what walk around with one in clothes and without I can&#39;t seem to properly picture it 4. How does sex/masturbation feel with it is it better or worse if that&#39;s even possible 5. How was recovery
