Hey there, to preface I&#39;m a mum and I&#39;m going to mum at you. (We are in Australia so it&#39;s mum instead of mom in the US)
</p>
<p>
My daughter had her surgery with Sutin in mid January, I was there for every step. I also know several girls who had surgery with him over the past decade.
</p>
<p>
I 100% promise you that you look exactly right. I know you look almost identical to my daughter at that stage, and the same as her friend who went two weeks earlier.
</p>
<p>
My daughter was not great with cleaning or touching for a few weeks, I&#39;m guessing a big part of that was the numbness. She was getting me to do her washes the first week in the hotel so she didn&#39;t have to touch herself.... That is totally ok and normal in my opinion. You have a whole new you to get to know, like dating someone new, it can be best to take things slowly.
</p>
<p>
I can 100% promise you that if you take daily photos and then do a comparison in a week that you will see a ton of progress that you aren&#39;t going to notice day by day.
</p>
<p>
My daughter also swelled a lot like you have, that&#39;s totally normal although unpleasant. Her (and her friend who went just before) both look extremely natural now. By about week 4/5 both girls you couldn&#39;t tell that they were neo vaginas if you ignored the stitches.
</p>
<p>
I know it&#39;s super hard right now and it&#39;s going to stay really hard for a bit longer. I wish I could say otherwise but I&#39;m always super honest. But I also know for a fact that you are super brave and strong and can handle this.... You were so brave and strong and true to yourself from the moment you decided to live authentically. You can handle this, it&#39;s hard I know but I have complete trust in the fact that you are brave and strong. You are going to be so happy in a month that you did this. I promise.
</p>
<p>
If it helps at all you can message me directly and I&#39;m even happy to video chat and give you a pep talk if you need it.
</p>

you are such a good mum ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹ it warms my heart so much to know that people like you exist. i think and hope my mom will be like you too if I someday get surgery (hopefully) but it can be a little awkward opening up to her about trans stuffâ€¦

I wish my mom supported me like this.. thank you for being a good mom! I can tell you from experience it means a lot when your parents support you through the hard stuff.. because mine didn&#39;t support me at all and it hurts so bad. Thank you again for being a compassionate mother and being there for your daughter.

You&#39;ve done so much good with your words without even knowing the extent.
</p>
<p>
1: My parents rejected me, and even being almost 40 with my own kids, sometimes the feeling of, &#34;I&#39;m an orphan&#34; sets in.
</p>
<p>
2: You took time out of your day, and seemingly continue to do so now for our community (and your daughter is so incredibly lucky to have you).
</p>
<p>
3: You remind me of my Aussie friend Julie who went through similar things with her daughter. I remember how she and I talked years ago when her daughter came out, and she sounded just like you; supportive, loving, and had a profound urge to learn all she could to help.
</p>
<p>
Thank you, ma&#39;am. You&#39;ve made my morning brighter for having read your reply.

Iâ€™m just over 3 weeks post from Dr Sutin as well.  What you are feeling is the same as I am now, that everything feels weird.  From what I can tell thatâ€™s normal.  Nerves and all that still need to wake and even at near 4 weeks it feels weird.  The pinpricks will be some nerves waking, and also the dissolving stitches, though I doubt it will be those yet.  Wait till you have bits of string coming out during dilationâ€¦
</p>
<p>
From what Iâ€™ve been told it will take about 6 months to start feeling normal again, though results can vary.

IMO don&#39;t risk it unless you&#39;re going to be ferried and pushed around everywhere! SRS is a major surgery. You wouldn&#39;t go on vacation or tour with someone just a month after they went for a heart or brain surgery!
</p>
<p>
Priorize and do every thing in your power to ensure you heal well first! You don&#39;t want to accidentally rip stitches. You can always come back to visit Thailand but you only have one chance to heal correctly after surgery. This is coming from someone who had to have 3 surgeries to get things right

Girl you are looking good and well defined, she will look great and not to worry. Anytime you are cut for surgery nerves will need to recover. There is a lot that the area went through and things for your body to realize and rediscover and takes months. You got thisðŸ¤—

Totally normal ,numbness reduces over time and the pain pricks whilst uncomfortable and painful are a great sign that nerves are reconnecting. I&#39;m at six weeks post myself , this is just the new normal  tou get used to it , I still haven&#39;t seen my clitoris it  is well buried and completely numb still ,up until this week my mons was too but I have touch sensation coming back now . Every one heals at their own pace ,give your self time listen to your body and if in doubt ask your surgical team .

Was this your first surgery? Because most time there&#39;s this feeling of things not fitting well and deep numbness. A surgery such as the one you went through - reconstructive procedure - is probably the weirdest of this kind when basically all things have been rearranged. Dont you worry about it, keep in mind why you did it in the first place and trust the process. No surgery would feel ok within only a week, trust me, our body tend to take more than a month to start getting rid of the swelling and thats when it starts to feel good again.

Sister, it already looks good. Look at that clitoral hood, you&#39;d be so happy when you heal.

You&#39;ve got this! I am sure it must be totally unsettling and foreign to feel a part of your body that feels like it doesn&#39;t belong yet, but it will take the nerves time to heal. That feeling won&#39;t last forever!
