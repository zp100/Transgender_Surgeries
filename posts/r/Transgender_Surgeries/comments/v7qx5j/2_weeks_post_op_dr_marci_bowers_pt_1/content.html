Here to share my experience with Bowers. I know that she is a focal point of interest conversations and also pin ðŸ“Œ to this page. Not defending her since everyone has their experience that is true to them. This is about mine, from a point of view of an immigrant white Mexican trans woman.
</p>
<p>
Even though my surgeon was Bowers there will be similarities with any surgeons like exhaustion from walking, bowel movements, pain, bulb extraction, etc.
</p>
<p>
*Why I chose her. Experience, trans, and previous medial focuses. I had seen Dr. Meltzer, Dr. Dugi (OHSU) and Dr. Esmonde (during BA and orchi) before with free consultations and both said the same thing.  &#34;Lots of skin to work with&#34;. I didn&#39;t want a two-step so I put myself on the OHSU waiting list. I wanted surgery soon so I decided to be on two waiting lists. I was between Dr. Wittenberg and Dr. Bowers. I thought it would be silly to be in three so I just pull the trigger and chose while making a phone call. From what 3 surgeons told me I was comfortable putting the deposit without an appointment.
</p>
<p>
*Waiting list, insurance, prep  Getting on the waiting list is pretty simple, pay $1000 and wait to be called. So I did exactly that and send an email 4ish months later to ask about a very loose guestimate on the surgery date, late 2022 or early 2023 with a scheduled surgery date in late 2023.  I was called within a year and a couple of months  Out of the blue they ask me if I could be there in 4 weeks. I said let me see my work schedule and put them on hold. I talked it over with my partner and decided it was too fast for everyone and stressful for me. I had not gotten my psych letter because it had to be dated within a year and where I live there&#39;s a massive shortage of folks who write those letters and I also have a toddler. I call the office the next day and say I couldn&#39;t make it and to please give it to someone else but that I was ready for the next opening.
</p>
<p>
I went on turbo mode and contacted anyone in the state of Oregon that could ride that letter. Found someone in Portland that could do it via telehealth within a week. So grateful for technology. A week or two later I had a new date 6ish weeks away, filled the paperwork sorted workhouse stuff, and started planning the trip. We drove there because of COVID, kid, and my anxiety about getting COVID and having to postpone surgery. We arrived there on a Saturday with a surgery date on Wednesday.
</p>

For prepping, I had electrolysis ever since I made my mind up. That was every week for a little over a year, so at least 52 hours most likely more. Didn&#39;t keep track.  After my BA I had a very painful first bowel movement aka poop. Probably the worst pain from that surgery. I did not want to risk it and be as constipated for this one due to proximity so I started taking fiber (metamucil) before they even called me. Apparently, your body needs to get used to high fiber, or else you just feel bloated and nauseous. I was just taking 3 scoops a day. Once I was called I slowly increased to 6 scoops a day. I was happy I did it even if I didn&#39;t have surgery, the easiest poops I ever had. THIS PAID OFF BIG TIME. At the hospital, it only took one Miralax to start my guts moving, and never took the oil. I hight recommend this even for daily living.  I also kept an eye on my weight and try to get rid of some pounds. This was hard and I am a person who eats their feelings and prepping was stressful, fiber help since it makes you feel full. Now I am considering fat but not over the BMI that most surgeons start to think about surgery. I also didn&#39;t lose weight for looks but mostly for a faster recovery since most studies have that correlation. I end up losing about 10 pounds nothing crazy when I am 235lbs.  If needed I can make another post later of a list of things I took to San Fran only will do this if there are comments.

*Pre-op appointment Meet Dr. Bowers on Tuesday. It was supposed to be Monday but she had an emergency from what I gathered was a COVID exposure and had to test due to hospital policy. Surgeons were visiting from Denmark and I was asked if they could be in pre-op and surgery just as viewers to learn. I said yes and signed the consent form. Bowers has good bedside manners, easy to talk to, and knows her stuff (my Physician assistant partner had all the questions and didn&#39;t read any of the website or paperwork), and she wears cool glasses very similar to mine. She was a little fixated on look outcomes which u weren&#39;t I don&#39;t but I feel like lots of folks want a nice-looking vulva so I guess that&#39;s normal. She kept talking about how beautiful/pretty will be while I just want the penis gone and to stop having dark intrusive thoughts. Her being an older white trans woman fit the way of talking and beauty fixation that I have seen on other folks in that category. Not saying it bad just pointing it out. I also think that it is a generational thing too, felt like I was talking to my mom&#39;s friend who focuses a lot on looks. I never got a hint of transphobic, fatphobic, or just catering to beautiful folks of people that meet her criteria. I chatted with an older trans woman in the waiting room who was having surgery too, a black fem patient came out while chatting and they were younger than me. I&#39;m 30. That is a good range of folks all of us with different body types.

I&#39;ll make another post this is getting long. Will try later today or tomorrow morning.
