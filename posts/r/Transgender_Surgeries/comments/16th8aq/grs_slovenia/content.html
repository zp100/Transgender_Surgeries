Good morning,
</p>
<p>
I’m from Italy and sorry for my bad English :(. I’ll have my grs in a month and I’m so anxious. I choose Dr Milos Petrovic in Slovenia with skin graft technique. Do you have any advice/tips for me? I’ll be there with my mum for 10 days after surgery maybe but I need to work from home when I’ll leave hospital. Do you think I’ll be able to work from my bed? I’m so afraid of pain and so afraid to have complications, doctor said to me everything and every risks but I’m so scared. By the way, I can’t wait to wake up from anesthesia and found that finally I’ve made my Grs. Thank you so much
</p>

You don&#39;t have to say sorry if you don&#39;t think your english is good. Anyway, if your work will not require you to move around and if you can really work from bed, up to you. But really, doing professional work can be stressful mentally even if you would only be on your bed. If you can at least take a leave from work for about a month so you can focus solely on your recovery and then probably after that you can go back to work from home. You have come this far, don&#39;t risk your recovery process after the surgery. Good luck! xx

Listen, I will be honest with you, this sounds fishy! I&#39;m from Slovenia, and no one has ever mentioned him to me as an option. EVER! Medical professionals usually cite Djordjevic as the top dog. I have never even heard of SRS being done in Slovenia. Dr. Trombetta is someone I have heard horrible things about, so that doesn&#39;t feel me with confidence either. Do a detailed research about him, and conditions in Slovenia.

Really? He works with Djordjevic in Belgrade Clinic! Some Italians girls have been in Slovenia for srs (originally in Fabian Clinic but now he does grs only in Izola Hospital)

He lacks experience and possibly skills. I think Dr. Miroslav Djordjevic is better.

I don’t think anyone has ever posted here about having surgery with him. Do you have a link to any info about him? It’s quite risky choosing surgeons for which there’s no information. Why did you choose him?
</p>
<p>
I’d try looking on Facebook.
</p>
<p>
Why did you choose him?
</p>
<p>
There’s some info on srs here

You MUST use a browser to view that, NOT  a reddit app, or you won’t see most of it.

I search a lot of surgeons. I can’t move to Thailand for my job. He works with Dr Djordjevic and he worked for 10 years in Trieste with Dr Trombetta, he made 200+ surgeries in Belgrade, Trieste and Slovenia. He showed me results and I met 2 girls that had surgery with him. I choose him cause it’s quite close to Italy and if there’s any problem I can drive to him.

Thanks, I&#39;ll add this to the wiki. I don&#39;t know if you care, but the photos on this site are not very good. I&#39;d look for a different surgeon.
