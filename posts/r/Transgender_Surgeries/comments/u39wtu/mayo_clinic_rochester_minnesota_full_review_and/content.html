That looks great. If I decided to get the procedure done, it&#39;s nice to know someplace near me (that would be covered under my insurance) does good work.

It was pretty good overall the surgeons staff was amazing through and through but the post op nurses left a lot to be desired from me (could have been a bad batch that day), you should start now tbh if you’re even considering because they take FOREVER to vet the people to come through.

Oh yes I’m in the process now and it’s taking forever! I called in January and just now at the end of April have my intake stuff with the endocrinologist and everything. Surgery makes me anxious so that’s kinda where I’m stuck in the stress
</p>
<p>
How long did it take to schedule surgery?

Had mine 11 days ago, just had a checkup today, so far only complication is that the lower stitches have strained but thats my fault because of how i was dialating. Was told for now to let it heal naturally it would just take a little longer! Other than the usual mental breakdowns because I cant do anything besides walk I haven&#39;t had a single issue.

congrats girl, welcome to the club! learning to dilate is really tough. i&#39;m nearly 6 months post op and still really tense down there. i gave you permission to dm me, so if you&#39;d like my input on anything don&#39;t be a stranger. there aren&#39;t many of us fahradyan patients yet

girl i only have two real questions, one how tf do you handle the pain of the nerves mending with the clit without heavy pain killers. and two what is the best way to avoid straining the stitches, because other than that, im only struggling with not being able to help myself with anything.

<ul>
<li>
<p>
Wear baggy pants, sit on your side instead of your butt with a pillow between your legs, and make sure she gets fresh air at least once a day, not including dilation. This applies to dilation as well, but consider buying a plushie to squeeze through the pain. Pillows just aren&#39;t the same. My bunny was the mvp.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Insert the curved tip of the dilator at a slightly higher angle, before slowly bringing it horizontal for the rest. Press downwards as you push in to open your vaginal canal. Don&#39;t force anything. It can be hard to tell the difference between normal recovery pain and &#34;I need to stop doing this&#34; pain, but it gets easier. Generally the latter feels like tension or a sharp jolt. If it doesn&#39;t hurt too much lift your butt while pushing, as your body weight puts pressure on your pelvic floor. You&#39;re not committed to a single position. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re familiar with butt stuff, but the same action that relaxes your butt will relax your vagina, as well.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did you bring someone with you? Relying on someone to fetch you things will suck but it&#39;s really important that you have the support of someone you trust right now, even if it&#39;s someone from the hospital. I hope this helps &lt;3

I got my girlyfrand with me and plenty of stuffies! believe it or not dialating is surprisingly easy for me, the nerve pain is an absolute destroyer to me though, it has only been 11 days since surgery. but thanks for the advice on getting air, I&#39;ll give that a try along with the ice!

Be careful with ice! The pain sucks but you still need blood in the area to heal.
</p>
<p>
As your for your clitty that sounds like it will just be a matter of time, but it might not, I can&#39;t see so I can&#39;t tell you. Definitely let Dr Fahradyan know what you&#39;ve told me if you haven&#39;t already. Congrats again love

i already asked Dr. Fahradyan about it, and about the ice, he said that it&#39;s fine on the ice for 10 minutes on and 20 minutes off, as for the clit I&#39;m fairly certain it&#39;ll probably be ignoble by tomorrow, usually out of sight out of mind works for me, i had my checkup today so he was checking the feeling on everything and it drew my attention to that area because the sensation is rather strong.

Another thing I forgot to mention about dilation! Make sure your butt and bladder are empty before dilating, too. The presence of waste will create pressure in your pelvic floor and make insertion more difficult. It seems intuitive but didn&#39;t really occur to me until getting the feel for how things move down there.

It didn’t hurt too bad surprisingly, they had a rectum surgeon go in and fix everything stitched it up and vacuumed any excess feces, for now I’m not full depth. They softened my stool and I will continue to outside of the hospital. I’m waiting for the rectum injury to heal to continue my surgery which happens to be around 6 months.

Was your rectum issue cause by the surgeon making a mistake? Or was it just due to your body or something rare they didn&#39;t think of or something?

Both, it was something my surgeon was aware of due to my chart; but I have very weak systemic tissue.
