Circumcision and srs?
</p>
<p>
Hey I&#39;m a 19 year old trans woman. On hormones 8 months uhm things are good but I guess I have a problem that I&#39;ve only found conflicting answers too.
</p>
<p>
Im not super comfortable with my downstairs so I&#39;ve never paid much attention to it. However I got a girlfriend 7 months back and was actually excited to explore with her. Anyways when we got down to it she was a little surprised about my penis. Specifically the foreskin. I guess in my 19 years I didn&#39;t figure out that you&#39;re supposed to be able to pull it back (like to clean and such) since I never really touched it. So anyways cue alot of awkward internet searches to find out I have phimosis. I went to a urologist who after an extremely uncomfortable appointment, that involved trying to pull my foreskin back and some of the white stuff from underneath coming out of it he said circumcision was the only solution. I know that srs works better with a foreskin but honestly I&#39;m kind of insecure about this and specifically with my girlfriend. I know like when I take my panties off or play with it that I can uhm smell it and I guess it&#39;s not super hygenic. Should I just get them to circumcise it and then deal with srs later or do I wait with this gross, overly sensitive thing until I get srs.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of that, since the foreskin is so tight can they even use it for it?

Hi there, I&#39;ll just post some general information on treating phimosis. From my understanding of the procedure, the tissue would be useful whether or not the foreskin itself is tight.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://phimosisjourney.com/">http://phimosisjourney.com/
</a>
(NSFW Photos, non-pornographic)
</p>
<p>
<a href="/r/phimosis">/r/phimosis
</a>
</p>
<p>
First step is to identify the type of phimosis, the first website has examples. Next, try Googling &#34;foreskin phimosis stretches&#34; to learn more, typical treatments for phimosis include stretching and topical cream prescribed by a doctor. See what type of phimosis you have, then start stretching. After you get a prescription, the topical steroid creams will accelerate progress. If your doctor makes no mention of a topical cream or stretching exercises, see a different doctor, as this is the universal first step in treating phimosis.
</p>
<p>
Not all doctors are properly trained to handle phimosis, especially in the US, and may refer to circumcision first, in this case, find another doctor. Even in the most severe cases, today there are procedures which remove little or no tissue (z-plasty, dorsal slit).
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

In addition, the &#34;white stuff&#34; is smegma, and can be removed with hot water, and mild soap during a bath. If you are able to retract the foreskin readily, you can do this over a series of several days. If it does not come off with mild soap, applying a bit of coconut oil, or baby oil, should help it come off. Smegma is a natural part of human genitalia, but can accumulate unchecked when phimosis is involved. Once it&#39;s gone, you should be fine!

Typically, removal of smegma for both men and women(!) is trivial, even in the worst of cases. If it&#39;s at all possible to manage now, I would definitely suggest making a habit of cleaning your own smegma before long before SRS, if only because its good hygiene. Even with pinhole phimosis, the most severe form of phimosis, it should be possible with some patience.
</p>
<p>
If you cannot do this for other reasons, you will be alright! The surgeon and their staff will be able to clean it easily, don&#39;t worry.

Circumcision is
<em>
definitely NOT
</em>
the only way to deal with phimosis. You can stretch the foreskin daily (maybe several times a day) until it can comfortably retract. Stretching can be made easier with the use of topical steroid creams. It doesn&#39;t make sense to undergo an extra procedure with extra risks if you&#39;re just going to get SRS in the near future anyway.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea how being not/circumcised affects SRS.

That&#39;s not what people mean when they say &#34;Will circumcision affect SRS&#34;, they want to know if being circumcised will mean that they can&#39;t get SRS at all. Please refer to rule #5 in the sidebar and don&#39;t comment in trans subreddits if you don&#39;t actually know what you&#39;re talking about, this is not For You.

<p>
If I wanted to know whether it would mean I couldn&#39;t get SRS, that&#39;s what I&#39;d ask.
<br>
OP even mentioned having it done now and dealing with SRS later, which seems to indicate they know it&#39;s an option.
</p>
<p>
If I were to ask &#34;Will circumcision affect SRS&#34; I&#39;d definitely appreciate

There are surgeons where circumcision will make an aesthetic difference, in particular Suporn. There&#39;s also a mention of phimosis if you search in this pdf

</a>
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how common it is where it makes a difference, but personally I&#39;d try to find another way of dealing with it.

I would not recommend circumcision if you are planning on SRS, you could always look into getting a dorsal slit to buy time. I was circumcised myself and had penile inversion and didn&#39;t have any issues.

I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about here, I was circumcised after birth. I wonder if it would be possible to get some sort of nozzle and VERY GENTLY sort of ease it under your foreskin and flush out some of the worst stuff. Just use plain water. Or, if you can&#39;t ease the nozzle under your foreskin, try pulling your foreskin forward a bit and sealing around the nozzle, and again, VERY GENTLY squirting water into the closed area.  I would agree with the daily stretching bit. Again, talking without knowing anything (never stopped me before, why now?) I would suggest several ten minute sessions every day, adding some lotion or perhaps a steroid cream, and gently pulling open as far as you can stand, and keeping it there for several minutes. Repeat several times in one session.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I wish I had not been circumcised.

If it&#39;s not causing you any problems I&#39;d forgo doing anything about the foreskin until you&#39;ve talked to one or more vaginoplasty surgeons. It may be in your best interests to leave it alone and wait for GCS.

Well I think its probably unclean. My girlfriend said its not exactly the best to suck / play with since I haven&#39;t been able to pull it back and wash. When I went to the urologist, he had the nurse hold my legs gently and was able to get it about 3/4ths of the way back. He wiped away some of the stuff but it was super painful. He said essentially when they circumcise me they&#39;ll clean it off while I&#39;m numb so it&#39;s not painful.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also really sensitive. I usually ejaculate in about 20 seconds.

Definitely try to talk to a GCS surgeon first. That tissue can be used during various parts of the procedure and once it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s gone.

I&#39;d definitely working on cleaning it, and recommend manipulating it more. That&#39;ll help with being overly sensitive, though the foreskin is actually there to help preserve sensitivity. I wish I still had mine. Also, just like the other commenters, if your doc is immediately jumping to suggesting circumcision as a first attempt to correct problems, you need to find a new doc. Unfortunately, you may need to try several in the US, as routine infant circumcision is so common here....

If you’re looking into GRS then I would not recommend circumcision, although it is correct that it depends on the surgeon and method used by them. I haven’t read testimonies yet that mention a function difference but I have read several where aesthetics are badly affected by this, mainly by tone difference, parts lighter or darker than the rest.

My advice would be to not get circumcised. AFAIK, the tightness of the foreskin won’t impact SRS, and the more highly innervated material you have down there for SRS, the better, IMHO. I don’t know how long ago your urologist appointment was, but as someone who also has phimosis, it’s super sensitive when you first start pulling the foreskin back and cleaning it, but it gets better as time goes on. At first, even letting the water in the shower hit the head was super painful, but after a couple of weeks it was fine. One of the other things that helps me is to wet down one end of a Q-tip &amp; stick it (gently!) under the foreskin to clean it.

I have slight phimosis and ive discussed it with my surgeon. He said it wont be an issue for surgery (hes also a urologist). I recommend against circumscion and tbh, that urologist is a bit dumb if he said that circumscion is the only option. Its not. There are stretching methods you can try. Foreskin can help with vaginal length, and the nerve bundle in the foreskin should be helpful too. Basically, dont worry about it too much, if you can kind of fill your forsekin like a water balloon in the shower, hold the end so theres water in there, give it a sqeeze around etc, you should be good to go.

it seems like a health issue so i’d probably get circumcised unless you’re getting SRS very soon. it may work better with foreskin but plenty of circumcised trans women get SRS and end up just fine
