<p>
I wanted to share my positive experience with surgery in Thailand by Dr. Theerapong. I got a laparoscopic PPT vaginoplasty. The surgery took 7-9 hours. I stayed in Thailand for 4 weeks post-op.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Post-op care
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I did not go via siam transformative but directly with the interplast clinic. I booked extra nursing care for 2 weeks post-op and they had someone take care of me and who spoke English. I used a hotel that is just 2 minutes walking to reach the clinic, so I could easily get help there when needed. In the hospital I was alone but I think it would have been possible to have the nurse of them there if arranged prior. I think the care they provided was sufficient for a good recovery and communication with them worked fine via WhatsApp (and still does post-op). They did not provide the extensive care like massaging in the hospital or being there with long talks for emotional support as I read in other reviews about siam transformative. With the extra care I booked I was getting help twice daily with wound care and dilation in my hotel and they brought me things I requested. For food I mostly ordered via grab.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Aesthetics
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I am not sharing pictures right now because there have been several posts in the past weeks/month of early post-op results from him and mine are in line with that. I met one of the other girls who shared her experience with pictures here in the hospital. I might share pictures when I have my final result where all swelling is gone and possibly when I finished revision surgery once I decided if I get that.
</p>
<p>
I am so far happy with the aesthetics. Currently there is still some swelling left which is most visible in my small labia, or that is where it bothers me the most. So right now they are too big and don&#39;t have a wrinkly look yet, but I expect them to be fine when swelling is 100% gone. Also Dr. Thee told me I could get revision for free (except hospital fees) if they end up undesirable, and given that he left lots of material (as I wished) I am not worried about their final look, but just impatient. The other parts of the surgery look good to me already. The stitches are very well done and the scars heal good. The stitches that I got on my belly from a laparoscopic appendectomy are much worse in comparison and I can tell he did a great job. Also the surgical team was able to reuse these previous incisions so the only new scars on my belly are two very tiny ones on the side which will likely fade to practical invisibility within 2-3 years. The external scars that he left are protruding almost nowhere. Comparing that to my older appendectomy scars on the belly I am relieved, as those do protrude a bit. The only place where I have that now is a slight bit on the very top of the incisions next to the big labia. The remaining external scarring is basically flat already and only needs to lose its redness. I apply silicone scar gel since week 6-7 and massage the scars which I think reduced the slight protrusion already further since then. When I don&#39;t spread my legs these scars hide inside the skin folds of my thighs. There are stitches between the small labia and the big labia which are not visible externally as they are covered by skin even when my legs are spread.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Overall it was physically and emotionally a hard experience. The long surgery left me feeling really exhausted physically. The 7 days in hospital sucked but the morphine delirium in the first 3 days made it bearable. Pain was okay. I did not need pain killers directly after hospital at day 7, but a week later I developed an unpleasant persistent pain in my lower back which made me take the tramadol I was given because I simply needed a break from the pain to get rest. I think it was related to my new anatomy mostly for which my body needed to adjust and maybe partially to lying around a lot. The pain at the surgical side was not bad at all. The worst pain was due to the abdominal injuries together with gas/bloating post surgery. The bowel issues only started to resolve completely after stopping the antibiotics 2-3 weeks post-op (don&#39;t remember exactly). Knowing that I would recommend to have simeticone drops and maybe a laxative available to help with these issues in the post-op time and avoid unnecessary use of pain medication due to abdominal pressure.
</p>
<p>
Emotionally it was hard being there alone sometimes, but easier than not getting surgery. The hormonal disruption was noticeable and made me very weepy, even though I did not stop hormones. That was against the instructions of the clinic but I discussed this with my GP who also told me there is no evidence supporting this. My next injection would have been on the day of surgery, so I basically just skipped one. I started to apply a low dose of gel 3-4 days post-op and resumed injections after hospital. I still had gotten some heavy night sweats which resolved 2-3 weeks post-op. The recovery and not being able to do a lot of things gave me slight post-surgical depression. Resuming my ADHD meds at home and regaining more energy and abilities has helped me to feel better recently.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dilation
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dilation was and is a rather easy experience for me when compared to what others report. I followed the surgeons instructions which where twice daily dilation for 10-15 minutes per dilator. I was told to use the size S smallest one (25mm) to reach full depth and then the largest one I was currently using with as many steps in between that I need. I never needed any steps in between and dilation is straight forward and without pain, but also I have a rather big pain tolerance. First I was told to only use the small one during most of week 2. I then was cleared for going to the bigger dilators with 28mm (M) and 31mm (L). The switch to M was not noticable, it rather felt like the S dilator was too slim and M just fit exactly without stretching my width, so I directly used the L one. I got about 6.5&#34; depth which stayed the same since surgery. After about 3 weeks I started using the XL (35mm) dilator. So dilation took 20-30 minutes and that twice daily since then. 10min on S and then 10-15 min on XL. After dilation I was told to douche with saline solution mixed with iodine antiseptic. For the first 4-6 weeks there was additional cleanup of wounds with cotton tips/pads. At week 7 I ordered the orange soulsource dilator and started to only use that one for 15minutes as I can reach my full depth with it. Starting now at 8 weeks I am cleared for dilating only once daily instead of twice and will see how that goes but don&#39;t expect much problems since I skipped one dilation once or twice after week 4 and did not notice any more difficulties the next day after that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Sensation
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Regarding sensation and nerve healing: I had a numbness in my big toe and upper part of my left foot post surgery. For that the doctor prescribed me a vitamin B complex I think and it is slowly resolving. It has feeling again and I can feel light touch but it still feels different. On my vulva I have full sensation in the skin above my clitoral hood and my big labia next to the clitoris. With full sensation I mean I can feel the slightest touch on my skin as much as pre-surgery. The outer skin on my clitoral hood and small labia still feels numb, so I cannot notice light touch (e.g. with a feather) there although I think a little bit of sensation is slowly starting to return. The skin being numb does not mean I feel nothing as with a firmer touch including pressure there is sensation in deeper parts of the tissue. Also I have some nerve healing sensations and I think that sensation is slowly getting better together with the swelling. I am taking a vitamin B complex supplement and uridine monophosphate to aid the nerve healing, but don&#39;t know if it helps or not.
</p>
<p>
My clitoris and the inner part of my small labia and the clitoral hood are more sensate. I was initially worried about not having enough sensation and because of all the numb spots, but now that anxiety has lifted. A few days ago I was able to reach orgasm for the first time and could repeat it and get there basically as fast as pre-op just using my hand (and a bit lube). So now I am more relaxed about the nerves taking their time and hope the numb parts will resolve too. Also above the clitoris there is some internal structure which feels very nice when stimulated. During consultation the surgeon told me that he does not discard any parts of the glans but uses it to create more sensate clitoral structure. I think he puts it inside the small labia below the clitoris. Maybe there is also something above the clitoris as it has great sensation there too, but I don&#39;t know.
</p>
<p>
At 8 weeks I still have slight discomfort when sitting in an upright position so that I need a pillow. When I lean more backwards sitting is okay without pillow as it puts more weight on the rear part of my butt which has fat and muscles. The healing has just reached a point during the last week where it does not feel like an injury anymore. Walking around and sitting leaned backwards at my desk chair was fine since I am back home, but after longer periods of sitting I need to lie down a bit.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask any questions.

I preferred PPT surgery. My German insurance only covers German surgeons and only by jumping through many hoops I&#39;d prefer to avoid and no one here offers PPT. Also I was not convinced about results of German surgeons and able to afford Surgery in Thailand without jumping through hoops. Surgery in the US is not affordable without insurance, so my realistic options for PPT where Dr. Djordjevic in Serbia, Dr. Kamol and Dr. Theerapong. Between the Thai surgeons I had a better feeling with Dr. Thee, as he has a lot of realistic pictures online, is not doing aggressive advertising on the homepage, has a very good reputation in Thailand, and also because I like his aesthetics which allow larger labia minora and a well hooded clitoris. Between him and Dr. Djordjevic I decided for him because there was more information and pictures about his results and because the communication worked better. With Dr. Djordjevic it broke down and after asking twice he did not tell me a price and when he answered the next time I already had booked with Dr. Thee.

Very interesting, thanks for the reply. Been communicating with Dr.Djordjevic and his replies have been very quick &amp; prompt. But yeah insurance a nightmare here as well (Central Europe too) so might go to Thailand, aswell.

Regarding surgery time I think Dr. Thee spends a lot of time for the external structures and there are more surgeons involved doing the work for the abdominal part. I don&#39;t remember exactly how long surgery took as things are a bit blurry. I remember asking him afterwards and getting the 9 hour answer which I also see in my message logs from surgery day. I think the 7 hours was what I was told before as what was planned. Also started two hours later than planned at around 4pm.

From one Thee baby to another Thee baby, Congrats! How was the communication with Ocean from Interplast? I went through Siam Transformative because I had communication problems with him and Interplast never mentioned about extra nursing care (wasn&#39;t on their website either). How much did the extra nursing care cost?

Thee baby here too and went with Siam Transformative too because i had communication issues with interplast and i know personally someone who went directly with interplast and she had no assistance with dilations or any assistance with food or anything and there was no mentioning of hair removal pre surgery either
</p>
<p>
Siam Transformative i think works out cheaper and has more thorough after care , plus i had someone during my whole stay in the hospital , they picked me up from the hotel and took me for a consultation we went to have dinner and then to my accomodation which they found me them selves , we went on trips to see Thailand too and basically eveeywhere i had to go they drove me like hospital admission, psychiatrist visit , follow up appointments and they brought me food daily literally everything its like having a family in Thailand that looks after you.

Ocean went with me to the psychiatrist too and also to the hospital for admission. We met at the clinic and went there together. I had assistance with dilation for two weeks after the hospital stay. For follow ups it was easy since the clinic was just 2 minutes away. I think the hotel would&#39;ve helped me if I needed it to get there.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had someone in the hospital, but I think that could&#39;ve been arranged too. There where no dinners or trips though and for food I used grab. They did bring me groceries that I requested though.

Hey, thank you and also congrats 🙂
</p>
<p>
Communication was fine for me. I was always answered very quickly with all my questions. The extra nursing care I got from asking. I said that I will be coming alone and that I therefore needed nursing care. I payed about 30000 thb for the extra care. Also I was advised to get the hotel near the clinic, just 2 min walk so I could get help from there easily.

What is the depth you are having now？ do you notice any lose of depth? How is the lubrication?

The depth I also wrote above is about 6.5&#34; and did not change since surgery. Lubrication is hard to say. It does feel moist and I can stick a finger inside without lube. Since I still dilated twice daily so far with a douche afterwards I don&#39;t know how much of that moisture is coming from me. Also I think the peritoneal tissue might still change its behavior during the first months. There is the lubrication coming from glands when aroused same as before surgery but now is secreted directly above the vaginal entrance. For inserting bigger things like the orange dilator I use lube as that is more comfortable, not sure if it is possible to force it in without but will not try to avoid hurting myself. I just need a little lube though and it feels like moisture is well retained.

I think they can be pretty quick but I already booked last year June, originally for end of February. Due to omicron I was scared my entry without quarantine would not work out so the date was moved to March in January. So I think that means they were able to get a surgery date booked with hospital and surgeons within less than 3 month. Don&#39;t know if it takes longer for an initial booking.

Thank you so much for such an informative post.  I started communicating with interplast directly and in the end just felt more comfy looking elsewhere, like the US...but now I am back to this as the aesthetic results from Thai surgeons seem so much better.
</p>
<p>
I am on considering Banks, but the waitlist is too long, and I think Theerapong is the best alternative.  Do you have any idea whether Theerapong uses any of the tunica vaginalis tissue?  This is the peritoneal lining inside the scrotal sac.  I have been reading about this being used at Mt Sinai and a few other places, and there are some interesting things about it, but mainly that it is the same tissue that would have lined the vagina had I been born correctly, and that if it is grafted in, gradually it will migrate to populate the entire vaginal lining.
</p>
<p>
Based on your post going with Siam Transformative sends like an easier all around way to do approach this.

I am two months post op PPT with Dr Theerapong. I have the same swelling and look to my labia minora you describe. How did this look after 6, 12 months? Happier or did you opt for a revision?

Neat. Also, not to double dip, but you didn&#39;t stop your hormones around surgery. Did they check your E levels ahead of it? I&#39;m also planning to not stop my hormones and I kind of want to know how easy it is to get away with.

Not to my knowledge. I had blood taken during my hospital admission check, so I don&#39;t know what they checked exactly. But I think it was just a health check mandatory before surgery for checking things like coagulation. They also took an x-ray and EKG.

I would, however, advise to not take estrogen pills, as they do have evidence that they increase clotting risks. Also not sublingual as still some estrogen is swallowed.

No it&#39;s okay, I use implants and sometimes transdermal gel if I need to.
