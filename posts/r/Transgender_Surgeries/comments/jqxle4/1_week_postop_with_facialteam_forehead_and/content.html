Thank you! ❤ You&#39;re in good hands! A few tips:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Learn a little bit of Spanish if you have dietary requirements or other specific requests. Sometimes there&#39;s a bit of a language barrier with nursing staff. Also it&#39;s just nice to know some common phrases when you want to greet or thank people.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bring a support pillow / neck support. The accommodations at La Villa, although great overall, don&#39;t have the best beds for allowing you to sleep upright after surgery (I still recommend La Villa though because of the regular nurse visits and their arrangement with FacialTeam; meaning they&#39;ll arrange all transportation/taxi for you)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Remember to fill out travel forms to be able to enter Spain during pandemic (can be done 48h before arrival):
<a href="https://www.spth.gob.es/">https://www.spth.gob.es/
</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Start using some good FFP2 or N95 masks and avoid meeting people a few weeks before the surgery to make sure you don&#39;t catch Covid and have to reschedule.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Go for long walks and eat healthy before the surgery. The doctors were surprised at how low my swelling was and I bet it was partially cause I had made regular 10-20 km walks every other day before the surgery.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Good luck in February!

How are your energy levels after a week? Have you felt up to going out and exploring the city?

I added some more tips haha
</p>
<p>
My energy levels the first 3-4 days were very low. But around the 5th day I started getting a lot of my energy back and was able to go explore the city. Now (11 days post op and back home) I&#39;m back to regular 5-10 km walks every day and feel really good :D

Another tip:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Don&#39;t stop drinking lots of water after surgery and keep your genitals warm during winter. I just got an UTI 3-4 weeks post-op now which was not very pleasant (peed blood painfully for a few of hours; now on antibiotics). Apparently the risk of getting a catheter-related UTI is still high weeks and even a few months after surgery.

Silly question - how are you looking forward to it? I have the option of going in a few weeks and I am... paralysed with fear. I&#39;d love to turn that into positive excitement somehow. Could change my life, as opposed to chickening out.

I go between nervous and wondering if I am wasting my money to being excited and preparing all the things to do beforehand. I think it would be silly to have absolutely no reservations, it is a lot of money and surgery after all, but most of my niggles are about whether I have left enough time for HRT feminisation to occur and whether I should have other priorities (I need a hair transplant and could have more done via FUE then via Facial Team&#39;s simultaneous process).
</p>
<p>
Despite all this I know it is the right thing to do; I am leaving FFS until Feb so I have 7 months HRT and I know bone won&#39;t change so I will want FFS anyway, I can always have top up hair transplants in the future and having simultaneous now shortens the overall timeline the most, and the money will be worth it to be more at peace with my appearance.
</p>
<p>
In summary, it&#39;s okay to be a little apprehensive just remember why you want FFS and why you are transitioning in the first place :) Hope that helps!

Yeah, FacialTeam&#39;s hair transplant is super expensive. I really wanted to get it, but it actually costs more than the forehead reconstruction! Price doesn&#39;t even vary with number of grafts transplanted like at most clinics.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fizrlr/facialteam_quotes_is_every_face_unique/">It&#39;s fixed at around €7400
</a>
regardless if you need 500 or 2000 grafts. So I&#39;m getting that done elsewhere in the future.

My hairline could eat up however much is harvested, and in comparison to a high quality transplant where I am (London) it is about on par. IMO for people that need it being able to get it done at the same time as FFS it makes it very worthwhile. I guess it depends on your individual needs/head :D

Yeah that makes sense. If you need maximum hair transplant it&#39;s probably worth it. But for any patients with smaller needs it&#39;s probably not worth it.

Thing is I believe with coronal incision you&#39;ll be losing those hairs anyway if you don&#39;t move them?

Yup. The strip of skin they remove is wasted, but it honestly doesn&#39;t seem like you lose much. My hairline seems to be mostly in the same position as before.

Yes I am concerned that the 1500 or so grafts from facial team will not be enough. I saw another hair transplant person who recommended FUT and 2500 grafts. Also a bit worried that coronal approach raises the center of the hairline a couple of mm, really don&#39;t need that!
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t you need to shave your head for FUE 0.0 ?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been on HRT for 2 years now and pretty sure my skull isn&#39;t going to change shape lol. Am a bit concerned it won&#39;t affect my life as much as I hope it might. £35k is a lot of money!

I completely forgot about that, even though it was a concern for me as well before the surgery. I haven&#39;t even noticed a change in hairline height 🤔

I rationalise that FUT has worked and is still promoted by many surgeons either in general or for specific uses. I do know that if you are considering multiple transplants it is recommended to go FUT first, as it is harder to do later and repeated FUE can result in thinner hair from the donor site. Regarding the slight raise in hairline, if you are concerned about this they take the donor area from further back and allow the elasticity in your scalp stretch so the hair line doesn&#39;t move too much.
</p>
<p>
For FUE, you can do it with a part shave (they buzz only the donor area and let your hair cover the donor site) but I don&#39;t think that they can take 2500 easily and have you hair cover it without obvious shaved spot in your head.
</p>
<p>
Based on these two (plus that you can get a hair transplant + FSS within a year)  I think it makes sense to go with simultaneous and then use FUE in a year to &#39;add-on&#39; where needed. To me that makes sense, haha! What do you think?

There are probably trendy ways (I&#39;m a bit alternative anyway) of styling a shaved bit, sidecut, undercut etc.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t like the idea of needing multiple transplants though, neither does my purse! (I almost said wallet then, one of the weirder ways to misgender myself)

There definitely are ways to style it, but I believe they nearly exclusively like to take transplant hairs from the back of the head so you are some what limited in that regard...
</p>
<p>
I understand the appeal of a one-and-done procedure, but the impression I got during my research is that it isn’t unusual for people to have multiple. It can be done to change the hairline or improve the density (they are limited by how many transplants they can crowd at a time). I am not saying a second will be required, just that they can have value.
</p>
<p>
Regarding cost, aside from the Facial Team nearly every hair transplant clinic offers pricing on a per graft basis, so the combined cost would probably work out about the same.
</p>
<p>
Have you spoken with the hair surgeons at the Facial Team? I was able to speak with one (I forget which) and they gave me confidence to go with them

No, I spoke to one doctor in person in my original consultation who was pretty trustable and great, and had a virtual consultation to answer a few other questions and honestly the second guy didn&#39;t fill me with confidence... He was for example really dismissive of people who said that a trach shave with them had busted their voice and stuff. He seemed like he was just saying whatever you get me to hand over the euros...
</p>
<p>
Didn&#39;t really talk about the transplants at all though.
</p>
<p>
I think I need to get over this idea that there is a hundred percent correct person and way to go about this...

That&#39;s very fair, if you wanted to reach out to the coordinator they can probably put you in touch with the hair surgeon. I think exploring all the options (techniques, surgeons, risks, etc) is important, it is your face after all!
</p>
<p>
I am a little unsure about damage done by trachea shaves, reddit can amplify the voice of the minority that did have a negative response - it is medicine and there are risks. Having looked up studies many people don&#39;t have permanent issues with their voice (
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6250475/" rel="nofollow">link

). I&#39;m by no means an expert though!

<p>
What is FUE? And what does it mean that you could have more done with FUE than with FT’s simultaneous hair transplant?

Essentially the difference is how the hair follicles are gathered, surgeons can either remove a strip of skin from your scalp and cut the follicles out (FUT) or use a hole punch (FUE) . I think FUE is generally considered the more modern approach - you can gather more hair up to about 2500 grafts I think and it has a smaller impact on your existing hair. However you can&#39;t have a hair transplant within a year to FFS because blood flow can be interrupted and hair can die.
</p>
<p>
The facial team have a process that is essential FUT called FUSS, because they remove a strip for forehead surgery they can basically do FUT at the same time, there are fewer hairs gathered but it happens at the same time as your FSS (you can read about it here:
<a href="https://facialteam.eu/ffs-surgery/hairline/" rel="nofollow">https://facialteam.eu/ffs-surgery/hairline/

)

Yes I’ve been thinking about FT for a while. It’s FUE that I was intrigued about. So FUE has potential for more hair but you have to wait. Though wouldn’t FT simply remove a larger strip of skin from the scalp if you needed more hair follicles?

Thank you for the update! Glad to hear you are recovering well :) do you still have much swelling?
</p>
<p>
Travel is the main concern of mine right now, I am in the UK which has limited travel to many places. I am considering travelling to a country that can still fly to Spain, quarantining for 2 weeks, then heading to Marbella.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t booked any thing yet, but unless travel restrictions are eased I don’t think I’ll have much choice. The uncertainty is causing a little bit of anxiety

<p>
Nah, it&#39;s mostly gone. The only noticeable swelling is on the tip of my nose which gives it a bit of asymmetry, but it looks like a normal nose :P The nose usually takes the longest for the swelling to go down from what I&#39;ve heard too.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Yeah travel was my biggest concern too at the time. If there are any covid-related restrictions you can rest easy knowing that FacialTeam won&#39;t charge you for those and will happily reschedule the surgery (you can confirm this with your coordinator). However, I strongly suggest having backup flights on the ready and go to Marbella a day or two earlier than needed just in case your flight gets cancelled (like 50% of flights are cancelled nowadays). [+ it&#39;s therapeutic to walk along the beautiful beaches before surgery]
</p>
<p>
Making sure not to catch covid is also a big challenge, especially on the plane when it&#39;s so crowded. Start using FFP2 masks that fit properly a few weeks before travel, during travel, and till the day of surgery. It&#39;s a hell to breathe through them, but that just means they&#39;re working.

I never thought I&#39;d need FFS but seeing recent pictures of me that show me in profile was a bit of a sucker-punch...

<p>
your post actually gives me real hope that, should I really opt for FFS, I&#39;m not facing an impossibility.

You look great! Never would have guessed it was only a week post op. I was supposed to go to them in June but the travel ban on Americans has forced me to delay indefinitely... as of right now until June. I guess that gives me time to learn Spanish.

We were staying at La Villa so we always had breakfast delivered to us (you get a decent list where you can check what breakfast options you want).
</p>
<p>
For food we often ordered through La Villa&#39;s partnership with a nearby restaurant Da Bruno which had a pretty big menu as well and delivers to your hotel. I got addicted to their tomato soup during recovery because it was perfect for my sensitive stomach and lower appetite :P
</p>
<p>
A lot of restaurants were open as well so we ate out a couple of times. You have a really good diverse selection of nearby restaurants to choose from. Near the coast they often have large patios, so social distancing usually isn&#39;t a problem.
</p>
<p>
As vegan I was uncertain about finding food there so I also brought my own

powder. But I definitely could&#39;ve gone without it.
</p>
<p>
Good luck in Marbella! Make sure you have backup flights! I arrived a day earlier just in case the flight got cancelled.

You look gorgeous! I&#39;m looking forward to getting my forehead done by dr Capitan as well. I wanted my nose as well but they didn&#39;t want to do it since it is minimal change and already my 3rd rhinoplasty. They are really professional and don&#39;t want to oversell surgeries just to get some extra cash, which ultimately made me chose FT.
</p>
<p>
Wish you the best and congrats for this amazing step! ❤

Thank you! ❤ I only met Dr Capitán once for like 5 minutes as he was very quick to the point, but his results were awesome! (I bet he&#39;s just a busy person since he does the majority of foreheads at FT). Dr. Bellinga was wonderful though and spent a lot of time chatting with me :D (so were the other doctors and nurses)

I am currently so close to pulling the trigger on seeing them soon, but I am kind of terrified. How stupid am I being? Been saving up for years and now it&#39;s so close I can almost touch it I&#39;m an anxious mess.

<p>
I&#39;d be getting forehead and rhino, plus jaw trachea and hair transplants.

First 2 nights will be uncomfortable. But shortly thereafter you&#39;ll start feeling soooo much better. And within a week I already realized it was totally worth the few days of &#34;pain&#34;. There&#39;s actually not much, if any, pain involved. It&#39;s just uncomfortable stuff like headaches, nausea, removing stitches, catheter, etc.
</p>
<p>
I just sort of let it happen without thinking about it too much and recovery went pretty great. So think about other stuff to avoid stress/anxiety.
</p>
<p>
If you want you could start with fewer procedures to make recovery easier. I was put under for 6 hours; so afterwards it felt more like a hangover.

I&#39;d be having a few more things happening, so probably a bit more of a bumpy recovery, not sure I&#39;d want to split it up though.
</p>
<p>
For some reason I can&#39;t really see past the anxiety, hassle, stress and trauma of it to the happy future beyond!

I&#39;m in pretty much exactly the same boat. I&#39;ve been saving for years and I&#39;m pretty much at my target, should just probably save a few thousand more as a safety net. Now I feel I&#39;m close and it might happen soon all the worries about if its going to be worth it and how difficult recovery might be appear.
</p>
<p>
Still pretty certain I&#39;ll pull the trigger its just odd going for a major goal for years to suddenly being worried about it.

I know very little about this process (mostly just what I see on this sub), so I apologize if this is a silly question - where were the incisions done? I scar pretty easily/badly which is a concern of mine looking at FFS in particular but these results are encouraging.

The incision for the forehead surgery is at the top of your head, so your hair will easily hide the scar after the surgery. You may lose a bit of hair along the incision, but within a few months people have said it usually recovers.
</p>
<p>
For the nose, I had an &#34;open rhinoplasty&#34; so the incision is in the nasal septum (the tissue that divides the nostrils). I have a minor scar there now, but it&#39;s hardly visible and should fade eventually.

I&#39;m sure you had more procedures done? Jaw surgery or lip lift maybe?

I have minor swelling in my eyelids, nose tip and forehead, but the doctors did say it was surprisingly little. I attribute it to a healthy lifestyle before surgery 😁 (regular 10-20 km walks)

Keojampa. And right now I am properly miserable. So no. When the swelling goes away and all the feeling comes back. And I am all healed up, probably sure. I will most likely love it.
</p>
<p>
I am just super tired and can barely breathe.  anesthesia makes it so you can&#39;t get properly o2 % sat. My nose finally opened up enough to use it since my operation.

<p>
Basically now me hates past and future me. Absolutely loathing. Past and future me is thankful for the now me pain.
</p>
<p>
In the end now me just wants to sleep and breathe easily again. Also the the feeling come back is super annoying.

Holy crap :0 Where is/was this pain located?
</p>
<p>
I was never in any pain in the hospital. And back at the hotel 2 days after I was just taking regular Ibuprofen, Amoxicillin, and Omeprazole for a week without any pain. Just mild headaches and nausea from time to time which subsided after 8-9 days.

Forehead and jaw. My nose was aggressive. It was a skilled nursing facility. So no not the hospital. I am taking percocet 5mg. Every 4 hours. It may be the Staples. They are causing me pain.

BTW. I have a lot of emotions right now. Sorry.l about that emotional dump.

I won&#39;t be able to see better results for a couple of months. So I won&#39;t really know till it heals.  And that process is painful.

I would extend that time by a few days... At least a week of recovery. I felt pretty exhausted for the first 4 days and could not possibly imagine getting back to work that early 🤔

Anyway, good luck to you!

very lovely results.  nice that even at one week the change is noticeable and the result is already something to dream about.
</p>
<p>
(i had a friend who at four weeks the swelling was such that the before and after were similar).
</p>
<p>
i normally don&#39;t think about getting the forehead work, but looking at your results really tempts me tons :)

Surgery cost:  €18,600 (forehead = €7,200, rhinoplasty = €4,600)

Accomodation + FT VIP package: €2,721

(accomodation was double comfort so included a full-sized apartment with 3 bedrooms, kitchen, 2 bathrooms, living room, etc.)

Is the larger size of the apartment you get the accommodation price, or VIP price? Would love to know a little more about how that breaks down (:

Good question, I have no idea... I just said I had my mom accompanying me and then they gave the cost for double comfort room. If it&#39;s a romantic partner I&#39;m sure you can go with a single comfort room and share a double bed. I&#39;m sure both include the &#34;VIP package&#34; which probably refers to all the taxi arrangements, etc.

Thank you.  My optometrist helpfully (no knowledge on his part I am trans at all) quipped my features were Neanderthalic, my brow ridge was quite a shed roof for my eyes, and that I was apparently bred for head butting...
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
...So I&#39;m always on the lookout for a Type III that went well.  If there was type IV, I&#39;d need it.
</p>
<p>

Your result is excellent.  Any lip lift?  Or is that an accessory result of the rhinoplasty?

There actually is a Type 4, but it&#39;s probably inferior to Type 3 because then they just fill the frontal sinus with bone cement,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/emp72a/alert_experience_forehead_reconstruction_2pass_vd/" rel="nofollow">which can have multiple problems
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Thank you! ❤ Nope, no lip lift, even though I wanted one. Not sure if I will get one now though. Even Dr. Bellinga discouraged it a bit (because of the visible scar it&#39;ll produce).

Oh.  You&#39;re right.  That is not a Type IV which would interest me.

I&#39;d say no, no reason for a lip lift.

Interesting that Dr. Bellinga discouraged the lip lift for the scar! He said the same thing to me..
</p>
<p>
But...... now that I&#39;ve had my vaginoplasty and discovered that I can literally remove any evidence of the scarring that I have with laser scar removal (uuuh it&#39;s called the Lumenis Ultrapulse laser I think, the second best option being Fraxel laser - basically super strong lasers for scar ablation).... Now I&#39;m totally reconsidering getting that lip lift and getting laser scar removal as soon as the scars become stable (like 1.5 months or 2 months post ffs)!
</p>
<p>
Maybe this could be an option for you, too? ❣️

Donno if you&#39;re near FT still, but maybe call them up and ask if they can do a quick lip lift on you? They can do it while you&#39;re awake with local anesthesia and it takes about 5 minutes (at least that&#39;s what Dr. Bellinga said last time... Haha).  x

If you live in the EU it&#39;s pretty easy. Ban on non-essential travel was lifted a few months ago. Just sign
<a href="https://www.spth.gob.es/">this covid form
</a>
online before you go. FT also provides a medical certificate so it should count as essential travel if restrictions were re-imposed.

You can&#39;t from America, but can from other places.

FT has made it possible for US and Canadian patients to get travel authorizations, it’s actually easier now than for UK travelers!

Just had my consultation with Dr Bellinga as well. I was recommended to go for the forehead/brow, rhinoplasty and, if I wanted, hair transplants.
</p>
<p>
He suggested that I undergo the type III forehead revision. If you have the titanium plates and stuff, how are they and does it feel noticeable?
</p>
<p>
Notice much difference/presence?

Hope it went well! Dr. Bellinga is so nice 😀

<p>
So you already had forehead work and want a revision?
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Day-to-day I don&#39;t notice it. If I do touch around my forehead I can feel it a bit, but that&#39;s because I have some pretty deep acne scars on my forehead since before (the skin is very thin in some parts). If your skin is thick and healthy without scars you shouldn&#39;t be able to feel the titanium plates/screws at all.
</p>
<p>
Personally I wish FacialTeam would&#39;ve accounted for my acne scars and used titanium mesh in these areas as it isn&#39;t as noticeable as screws. But I don&#39;t go dwelling on it as otherwise I&#39;m happy with the results. I might consider transferring some fat or using CO2 laser resurfacing in these areas later.

Sorry, I meant to say reconstruction - haven&#39;t had anything done yet : ]
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the reply, I wasn&#39;t aware a mesh was an option. Will have to ask :p
</p>
<p>
It goes without saying that you look beautiful. Well done! :D
