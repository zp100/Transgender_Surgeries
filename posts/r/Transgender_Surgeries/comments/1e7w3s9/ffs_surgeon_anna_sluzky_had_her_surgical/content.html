I have written about
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/1c5vq29/nightmare_ffs_experience_with_ann_sluzky_of/">my experience of FFS with Ann Sluzky
</a>
AKA Анна Вадимовна Слуцкая. Unfortunately since making that post it has become increasing clear that I was also a victim of ghost surgery. After being tipped off by another unhappy patient who saw my reddit post, I discovered one year post op that the man introduced to me as Sluzky&#39;s surgical assistant, whom I now know to be a Dr Edgar Fridlender posted photos and videos of me taken on the operating table to his professional social media without my knowledge or consent. The posts included one that used a thumbnail image of Fridlender working on my nose whilst someone out of shot assists him along with multiple before and after photos and videos of my un-obscured face. Also posted were before and after posts of several other FFS patients faces which were obvious from the bandages for their forehead work. I contacted Dr Fridlender to remove the posts including my face, of which there were several, politely asking and thanking him when he did so. Whilst initially obliging the request, Fridlender started giving me a bad attitude about my request despite him having violated my privacy as a patient by not having consent. Which is a clear breach of medical ethics.
</p>
<p>
This surgeon&#39;s social media presents him as a rhinoplasty specialist with no mention of Facemaker/Sluzky, or facial feminsation surgery.
</p>
<p>
I can confirm this person is me due to the forehead bandage from the forehead reconstruction I had performed, the date (a few days after my operations) and how many times Sluzky remarked at the shortness of my hair stating that she had never done the forehead procedure on someone with such short hair. It is very, very obviously me as other photos taken at that time can confirm.
</p>

<p>
As you can see this surgeon, Edgar Fridlender, is not mentioned on my surgical report as even being present during my surgery.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
It would be one thing if the work performed was good. Unfortunately the now fully healed result is both aesthetically and functionally poor, with internal valve collapse, unflattering changes that I had not agreed to with Dr Sluzky and defects related to overzealous work. Dr Fridlender seems to follow the barbie nose social media trend, a completely different style to the noses Sluzky shows on her website and what was shown to me in Sluzky&#39;s simulation of my FFS. Regardless of the changes being inappropriate for my face, I am not a fan of his work at all and would never have chosen it for myself. He also appears to be very new to this surgery with zero long term before and after results posted to his social media, indeed as you can see one of his employers describe himself as finishing a medical residency as recently as 2023 (my surgery was in early March 2023). I paid and walked into the surgical theatre expecting to be operated on by a surgeon who lists over a decade of experience and having specifically trained in feminisation rhinoplasty, instead I was operated on by this slimy Instagram chancer.

Wow the people talking shit. In this sub of them all.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know a ton about surgeries, but what I do know is that the doctor that&#39;s supposed to do your surgery shouldn&#39;t have other people doing it. wtf. Imagine this was a heart surgery or something? Why is it that there are people talking shit and basically saying &#34;get over it&#34;, when this is obviously a huge deal.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so sorry you went through this, and I think it&#39;s really important that you are trying to make others aware of this. It&#39;s completely unethical.

I am right there with you!! I had a student to my type 3 brow bone work without my consent after a year of consultation with the primary surgeon Dr. Laura Garcia-Rodriguez. She does not mention anything but what she will do for you but then magically in your records you find that some unknown to you student has done all this work while “supervised” and you never get to see what they look like to meet them before or after surgery, just fucking ghosts!! Totally unethical and surgeon like this should be fined and censured!!!

I always say before the surgery: you will be doing the procedures, right? Especially that I go for renown surgeons. I pay premium price for their hands.

Wow. In the US HIPAA protects patients from things like this. And informed consent. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any law like that where you had this done?

This happened to me when I went to a university hospital near where I live. I felt completely violated, with no mention of this other doctor, no consent given. Nothing.
</p>
<p>
It took me years to finally decide to continue my transition journey and attempt to trust any doctor again.

It’s hard to tell from that one note exactly what happened. Notes in the US have to be much more detailed. So I look at My surgical note for Example and I can see what steps my surgeon took and when. It also Specifically states who did what. If a surgeon does a major contribution to the surgery they need to write their own note.
</p>
<p>
If you were in the US I would say time to Do something (get a lawyer, call the insurance company, etc…) because it looks like fraud. But I don’t know the laws where this occurred so may be accepted practice there.

Oh I don’t doubt it. But I don’t want to pass myself off as knowing about something that I don’t. As an RN in the USA I am familiar with our laws and regulations. So I could speak to those and be confident I knew what I was talking about.

Please don&#39;t victim blame. Like every nationality there are bigoted people and unbigoted people. As badly as I have been treated I do not think bigotry was the reason for it.

Armenia and Russia are best friends and part of their military CSTO. I would expect nothing good from them.

You&#39;ve had a revision with facialteam now, and seem to be healing really well. Is it not better for your own sake to leave this behind?
</p>
<p>
What do you hope to gain from this? I understand raising awareness for potential future patients, however it seems a bit excessive. Having read your expectations of your Rhinoplasty on your other post it seems your expectations were extremely high, and not realistic. Except perhaps from an expert who only does rhinos.
</p>
<p>
You and I both went at around the same time with Dr Anna, and Edgar did my nose too. The breathing functionality is greatly improved, and it looks much more feminine, is it perfect...who&#39;s rhino is? Is it good? Yes. It&#39;s normal for surgeons to delegate work to their assistants. She introduced him to me as her assistant. From that point I expected he would do some of the work, as is normal with cases like ours where multiple surgeries are done at once. It&#39;s just basic time management really.
</p>
<p>
I have to be honest with you, did you really expect to go to a foreign country and expect procedures to be followed in the exact same way they would be in say, the UK, or other supposed &#34;1st world countries&#34;? That&#39;s just not realistic, other places do things differently, and to expect otherwise is kinda ignorant. You went as far as to complain about the hospital not having any food, when we all know hospital food is awful and there is a late night supermarket less than 100m from the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Also if you had the money to go with facialteam in the first place and felt uneasy about Dr Anna before your surgery, why did you not decide to cancel it?
</p>
<p>
At some point it&#39;s better to just move on.

You&#39;ve already made several lengthy posts about your FFS with Sluzky and you make a new one every few months. So not really sure why you&#39;d object to me making 2 posts in total about mine. It&#39;s a bit strange to call that excessive.
</p>
<p>
My expectations of the rhinoplasty were that I would have a proper discussion about it and consent to the changes made to my nose and that Sluzky would perform the bulk of the work, the clue is in the word &#39;assistant&#39;. None of those things appear to have happened and *my* breathing is impaired, the skin of the inside of my nose literally sticks together to the point I have to pull at the side of my cheek to breathe through it properly. It sucks. Is it too much to expect your surgeon to be the one cutting open your face? I have now had a partial revision with Facialteam (of the forehead) yes, but I will likely have to live with the shitty rhinoplasty for a long long time as I cannot afford to fix both, *if* a satisfactory fix can even be performed after so much bone and cartilage has been aggressively removed and reshaped in ways I didn&#39;t consent to. You were lucky enough to not get a botched nose though so I guess that makes me unrealistic?
</p>
<p>
Again I&#39;m not sure why you and maybe 1 or 2 other people feel the need to comment on my posts, to put words into my mouth or to pick on small facts I included in the post I made previously which was simply intended to provide as much information as possible. Perhaps you feel insecure about your own outcomes, perhaps it&#39;s due to a parasocial relationship with &#39;Dr Anna&#39;. I did not feel uneasy about Sluzky prior to travelling. Only as much as I would have felt about any such life changing surgery. Trust me I wish I&#39;d originally gone to Facialteam instead and would love to be moving on from this. Would much prefer not being targeted by unhinged people after my surgeon attacks me on instagram but yes, I think it&#39;s important people are aware of this serious mistreatment and frankly incompetence. No ethical surgeon would be attacking unhappy patients on social media or introducing someone who will be doing your surgeries as their assistant and then falsely crediting herself with the work in the surgical report (both claims I&#39;ve provided evidence of). That isn&#39;t how medical ethics work. Not in the UK. Not anywhere except in the operating theatres of butchers.
</p>
<p>
Weird gaslighting nonsense... as if I don&#39;t have every right to complain about abusive surgeons who left me with a caved in sinus wall and breathing problems amongst everything else.
