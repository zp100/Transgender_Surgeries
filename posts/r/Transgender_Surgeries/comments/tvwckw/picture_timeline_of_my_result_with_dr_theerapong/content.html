I had my surgery 1 month ago with Dr. Theerapong through Siam Transformative.
</p>
<p>
Its been 1 month and i almost forgot what it felt like to have a penis at first i felt like i was very well tucked but after the swelling started going down my body and brain was like okay we have a new body part.
</p>
<p>
Think of it as an app taking sometime to install lol.
</p>
<p>
Now i dilate with a bigger size dilator i can fit all of it in im about 8 to 9 inches deep dilation doesnt hurt at all it feels like pressure but relaxing my pelvic floor muscles makes that pressure to significantly decrease.
</p>
<p>
I already had my first orgasm on week 3 i took an nap and i had a wet dream and i woke up during my orgasm so it works already. Having an orgasm with a vagina is nothing like a penis it literally lasted about a minute and was all over my body and after that i wanted more but i knew i cant masturbate so early so i didnt touch it.

If you had srs previously and you where left with little to no skin and you went in with high expectations then im not surprised that he refused to perform a revision. Dr. Thee seems like an honest doctor based on my experience and he told me what he can and cant to after i told him what i wanted and i think that is great id rather have an honest surgeon than someone who lies to keep my expectations high only to face disappointment down the line. As far a Siam goes they only go by what dr Thee says and my experience has been nothing but positive not only for me but from other girls i saw and met in Thailand as well who had after care package with them i legit could not do it without them.

I disagree , just because you have been botched by one thai surgeon that doesn&#39;t mean all surgeons in Thailand are the same. Also what you say about dr Thee and Kamol being friends because they trained together even if you know for a fact that dr Theerapong trained with Kamol which i highly doubt based on the different aesthetic results you don&#39;t really know if they are friends or not for sure you are just assuming.  I don&#39;t want to sound offensive but this is why we do our research before going under the knife with a specific surgeon.  I was supposed to go to Suporn and i decided against it because of the long waiting list and because some girls complained about feeling uncomfortable during arousal because he leaves too much erectile tissue behind. Then i considered Kamol but i didnt like the aesthetics and i also read some bad reviews on reddit about him so i stayed away and i finally found dr Thee he gives one of the best aesthetic results in my opinion. I know dysphoria can make someone desperate for treatment that they dont bother with research but doing research especially for a surgery as delicate as this one is very important regardless if that surgeons clinic has influencers promoting which in my opinion is one red flag. If a surgeon is very good they dont need promotion like that you learn about them from word of mouth.

Im sorry you had to go through this. Iv seen the pictures you linked and he left you with no tissue thats why i would be quite catious going forward with a revision if i were you at this point. Another thing i wanted to say Dr. Thee performs revisions i had a discussion about that months before going to Thailand with Siam Transformative.  I don&#39;t think is because he just doesnt want to deal with you that he refused i think that if you went in with very high expectations from a revision wanting something very specific that could of been , its easy to work with extra tissue and remove some in the future but adding back tissue that is lost its very hard so i would be a bit cautious with this surgeon in Brazil who said he can do everything no problem.
