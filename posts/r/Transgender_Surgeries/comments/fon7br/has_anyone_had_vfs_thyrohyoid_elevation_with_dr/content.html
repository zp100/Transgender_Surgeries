Hey, this is me being totally honest as a
<em>
cis man
</em>
, no &#39;asspats&#39; or fakery to make you feel better. You sound like a smoker, but definitely a female smoker. If you called me as a stranger, I would instinctively call you ma&#39;am. That&#39;s genuinely the truth, you dont sound like any man I&#39;ve spoken to or heard. It may not be what you hoped for, but to me you sound similar to my wife, who is also cis and has a lovely (in my opinion sexy) husky voice. Hang in there!

It doesnt matter really, loads of non smokers sound like smokers. My wife doesn&#39;t smoke. Husky is a fairly normal type of voice and many women are born with it. Sorry if I&#39;m being insensitive at all but I dont think it&#39;s nearly as bad as it sounds in your head

You should 1000% go back. I had a granuloma from a migrated stitch that was actually causing my voice to nearly cut out whenever I got sick (removed by a local otolaryngologist, went through the original incision), and getting rid of it really helped. I also went back for 2 rounds of laser, and not only was he able to raise my average speaking pitch a little bit (already in the lowish-middle part of the female range, but I wanted a little more) but he was able to correct asymmetries in my vocal cords that was causing some hoarseness and &#34;breathiness&#34; and really helped it go from &#34;meh&#34; to &#34;pretty damn good&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Other than gagging a bit, the treatment is pretty much painless. He sprays that numbing stuff down your throat, he sticks a video probe down your throat and has you hum &#34;eee&#34; at different pitches to see where your cords might be bulging out, and then once he finds the problem areas, he goes back in with the actual laser to zap the problem areas. The whole thing is over and done in roughly an hour.
</p>
<p>
I know how depressing it is to have your initial result be lackluster - even beyond questions of passability, my voice was far and away my biggest source of dysphoria. But there are pretty effective ways for him to tweak things once he figures out what the problem is, so don&#39;t give up hope &lt;3

I just want a bright, vibrant young sounding voice. Even Dr Thomas said that i am in a male range rn, and somehow ive lost my upper register as my new surgical voice is lower than my trained voice.
</p>
<p>
Voice is the most important part of this entire process. That is why it was my first surgery. It was supposed to put my passing over the top. Now ive just gone backward because of it. I feel really foolish and hopeless currently

I know how much it sucks and how hopeless you feel - I&#39;ve been there. But please go back to him and let him get a look up close and personal. There are plenty of reasons why your voice may be raspy and lower in pitch than you wanted, and many of them are quite fixable.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a process, you&#39;ll get there.

Hi. I know this is late, but i just wanted to say thank you. I was feeling pretty hopeless back then due to voice and what i am now seeing was an emotionally abusive relationship. I am scheduled to go back out there in early October, exactly 11 months from my surgery date. And reading your comment again in a much better headspace really inspires hope. Thank you so much!

Oh sure, no problem! I&#39;m glad it made you feel better, and I&#39;m especially glad you were able to get back out there to see him again! He&#39;s a very smart guy, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be able to offer you some insight into what&#39;s troubling your voice.
</p>
<p>
Good luck, I hope everything works out!

I&#39;m sorry that your voice is having so many issues. I&#39;m also doing the laser fixup in May, while my voice is generally Pretty Good, I have trouble singing because my vocal cords healed a bit asymmetrical, and because they don&#39;t perfectly line up my voice leaks air a bit which affects the tone
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d trust Dr. Thomas, I&#39;ve never met a doctor who was more Real about his results or his commitment to make sure you&#39;re happy with your voice; he&#39;s not like some of the GRS surgeons who cut and run the second things aren&#39;t going well (:cough: Chett :cough:) Fixing voice problems is his Job - like, separate from trans issues, he fixes all kinds of voice problems from people who have really damaged voice boxes

I cant sing at all. It was my number one reason for doing this. Was so i could go to concerts and sound 100% female. Now i cant even sing. My voice just doesnt register. It cracks out like a boy going through puberty. I feel my range is extremely diminished and my overall vocal quality is even worse than prior to surgery. My voice is always cracking, raspy, and just lacking power. I am always clearing my throat now. Like i cannot even be heard by 1 person in the same room. I want to use my voice even less than i did prior to surgery. But it seems so many women who have this surgery with him have this amazing, life changing results. It is extremely depressing. Dr Thomas said i still sound male when i sent him my recordings and my voice was still in a male range.
</p>
<p>
I cannot see how a laser treatment is going to fix this. I just cant. Will it make me sound bright and vibrant? And not raspy? Will i be able to sing and sound cis? Will i be able to just sound cis?

<p>
If something like granulation is on your vocal cords, it totally makes sense that laser would fix it. Like, imagine a guitar, but there&#39;s like some junk on the strings muting them - it would sound really bad and unreliable! Knocking off that extra stuff would make it
<em>
much
</em>
clearer. It really depends on what&#39;s going wrong, which Dr. Thomas will be able to see with the endoscope.

Thank you. I checked your profile. Your voice sounds great. I was hoping for similar. Can i ask how old you were when you had VFS with Dr Thomas? Im wondering if i was too old at 36 to get it done.

You are just making me all kinds of hopeless today. I did this surgery to sound bright and vibrant. Like my trained voice, but better. Like many of his amazing examples i posted about in my other thread. Now i somehow have lost my upper and lower registers. Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool.
</p>
<p>
I mean cis and like someone my age or younger. I dont mean sound cis like someones great grandmother. Because that is how i think i sound....much older than my actual age. Much much older.

I had the same procedure with Dr Thomas in August. TBH I think my results sound pretty similarly to yours, but I&#39;m actually happy with my voice. Your voice does sound very raspy, but (being totally honest here), it sounds like a broken female voice, not a broken male voice. I definitely coded you as female right from the start. I&#39;m kind of in a similar boat where I hoped for something much better than what I got, but the voice that I ended up with at least allows me to pass on the phone and such, which is all I expected. I&#39;ve gotten used to it.
</p>
<p>
Of course that doesn&#39;t help you in your situation if you&#39;re not satisfied with your results. :( I&#39;ve talked with Dr Thomas about doing a laser revision for my voice, but I haven&#39;t decided yet if it&#39;s worth the cross-country trip and the week of voice rest. If my GCS gets pushed back to next year (which is likely), then I&#39;ll probably do that in the fall.

Im also cross country (Philly) and im supposed to go back next month. On......4/16. As long as it is not cancelled. He said two weeks ago that his April appts are still on, but that he did cancel all of his March appts. I know it is a fluid situation, so I am keeping in contact with Dr Thomas and Jody.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
He didn&#39;t mention any voice rest, so I will have to be sure to check on that. And thank you. I get missed and ma&#39;am&#39;ed as well. But I think it has more to do with my looks and name than anything else. But yea, I definitely sound broken, imo. Im glad you are happy with your results though. I had hoped for something more along the lines of his many examples. I was hoping for an outcome like
<a href="https://www.voicedoctor.net/sites/default/files/140%20B%26A%2002_0.wav" rel="nofollow">example 140

.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I wish I followed my instincts and realized that I was too old for this surgery. The best examples are people in their 20&#39;s and early 30&#39;s. Im 36, and I asked him about that. And he said that that was false, and many people much older than I am come out sounding 100% cis. IDK.....

Okay, i lied earlier. This is the most depressing thing i could have read. Voice was the most important part of this entire process for me. And now it feels like everything is ruined. I took my shot and i lost. Fml. Idk how i am going to recover or move forward aside from not moving forward and giving up. None of this matters if i dont have the voice i need.

fwiw, I can still sound pretty fucking loud after VFS, I don&#39;t think that this is universally true. I might have to work a little harder in a bar but it&#39;s definitely not the situation that is being painted here.
</p>
<p>
The singing is a thing I&#39;m hoping to correct, but even now, I can still sing, I just have a shit range because at higher pitches, the asymmetry gets in the way (the thing I want to fix with the laser).
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t give up hope!

I know this is really late like i said to some other commenters above, but thank you for this. I was not in a great place when I originally wrote this for a variety of reasons, including voice. I was scheduled to see him in late April, but covid cancelled all of his appts. So now i am scheduled to go back out there in early Oct for laser treatment. I am hopeful that things will be improved. Thank you so much for your kindness ti me!
