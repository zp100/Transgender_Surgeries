Cant speak for other surgeons, but Dr. Brassard actually encourages us to douche daily for the rest of our lives. I was surprised to hear that for the same reasons you mentioned! I suppose some surgeons think its necessary in some cases?

And then there are plenty of surgeons (such as Marci Bowers and my own) who don&#39;t want their patients douching after the first few months post-op unless instructed otherwise. In fact I think it&#39;s far less common for American surgeons to require their patients to douche after the first few months than in other countries.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not entirely sure why there&#39;s such a big discrepancy, but considering Bowers wrote my surgeon&#39;s recover instructions and she&#39;s trans herself, I stopped douching at 4 months as instructed. I&#39;m 15 months postop and have had zero issues.

So glad that you&#39;ve had no issues!! Totally agree, Dr. Brassard seems to be an outlier regarding douching guidelines..most surgeons seem to suggest only doing it for a few months I think?

I can&#39;t tell you what to do, but FWIW, my ex had GRS with Brassard. After about 8 months she got tired of douching and just kinda gave up on it. Almost 3 years later and she&#39;s had zero problems.

That&#39;s great to know! I think I&#39;ll probably do something similar tbh.

The medical consensus that douching is unnecessary is for natal vaginas. For neovaginas, many surgeons recommend douching. I do it once a week with a 4:1 of water and vinegar.

It&#39;s a
<em>
very
</em>
different environment than your hands, though. You&#39;re touching things and using your hands constantly throughout the day -- they&#39;re going to end up
<em>
way
</em>
dirtier than most parts of your body (hence why humans have developed the habit of washing our hands often.) Marci Bowers doesn&#39;t want her patients douching after the first few months, so that&#39;s when I stopped (she trained my surgeon and they use her recovery protocol); I&#39;ve had zero issues and I&#39;m almost a year and a half postop.

What kind of lube are you using? I initially used KY Jelly and I was highly sensitive to it. When I switched to another one, that helped it clear up. However, my granulation tissue was treated with silver nitrate. That’s a standard treatment for granulation tissue.

Sylk, though I&#39;ve been meaning to swap to another water-based lube sans glycerin (ie. Slippery Stuff). I used Aquagel (thick KY-style) when immediately post-op. I did have a small amount of external granulation tissue, which was treated with silver nitrate at my post-op appt. Perhaps my current granulation is too far in for that treatment?

I’ve had some internally too. My surgeon used a speculum to get in to mine.

natal vaginas are really sensitive &amp; douching can screw up the ph balance and cause other issues down there. as a trans guy i can’t speak for what neo vaginas are like, but if your surgeon’s team recommended douching then i’d listen to them. i’m pretty sure the main risks of douching natal vaginas don’t apply to neo vaginas so there shouldn’t be a problem. i hope the granulation clears up soon! try not to stress too much about it ♥️

Since you&#39;re trying to clear up a specific problem, it&#39;s a good idea to listen to your surgeon&#39;s instructions, at least until the granulation tissue is taken care of. Once that heals, you shouldn&#39;t need to douche anymore.

Douching can help clear internal granulation up as my surgeon said! I had to douche with vinegar and water to clear up a case of BV that I had dealt with previously.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to douching outside of medical need though, YMMV with this. It depends on the technique used and your personal anatomy. I had hybrid peritoneal and PI vaginoplasty, and I&#39;ve noticed when I douche on a regular basis I tend to rid my vagina of any healthy bacteria and develop odor kind of similarly to what cis women report with regular douching. My doctor and surgeon also personally don&#39;t think it aids in my case, but in general if you feel douching your neovagina is necessary there&#39;s no added harm really.

I reduced douching after looking through this wiki (and surgeons&#39; sites) - and found an improvement in terms of odour (much more &#39;natural&#39;). But if douching is medically necessary for granulation, I shall do it.
