That could be it, during my two follow appointments I was very adamant about asking them if it looked okay and they said yes, granted at the time the clitoris was covered by some dead tissue so maybe they didn‚Äôt get the full picture.
</p>
<p>
Is a revision just as intense as the og surgery or is it a more straight forward recovery

My revisions have been much easier than the primary surgery - but my primary surgery recovery was very difficult.

I had a catheter for one of my revisions, but that revision was moving the urethra multiple centimeters. In my experience JP drains are worse than catheters.

Sorry, I didn&#39;t answer your question earlier:
</p>
<p>
The primary surgery took probably six to twelve months to heal.
</p>
<p>
The first revision was electrocautery due to aggressive hyper granulation tissue after my first surgery. Innumerable silver nitrate treatments didn&#39;t work for me, so they put me under and zapped it. Took about a week to get back to work (from home).
</p>
<p>
The most recent revision was peritoneal graft, urethroplasty, and excess tissue removal. Part of the peritoneal graft was a failure, but the tissue removal/urethroplasty unexpectedly resulted in improved labia definition. I am still healing from this one. It has been about a month and I suspect it&#39;ll take three months resume normal activity.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d give it a year until seeking revisions, but your surgeon may know better.
</p>

That sounds like a lot, I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that, must be such a headache juggling all of that on top of work, I have as much time as I need right now to heal but in the future I feel like I would be pressuring myself to potentially get a revision and then back to work asap

It was. Without support and my work&#39;s benefits (unions are awesome) I would not have been able to do it. It may seem daunting, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Try not to get hyperfixated on it because that leads to some bad places. After all, it is always better to have too much tissue than too little. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è

I haven&#39;t had mine yet but have seen hundreds it not thousands of results and yours I&#39;m a little concerned about.  It seems like the clitoris is too big and even off on its own.  I would check in with Dr. Praying for everything üôè.

How was your experience with him? I&#39;ve heard very negative /concerning things about Mt. Sinai in general and him in particular. I&#39;m curious how they were for you.

I like him, he took a lot of time before and after for me to ask all my questions and wasn‚Äôt pushy at all, i mostly choose him for his past experience and based on posts on here that looked really good, maybe I didn‚Äôt luck out as much but I‚Äôm not at a point where I feel resentful in any way, just anxious to have him get another look at it

That&#39;s good to hear. I appreciate your taking the time to share your experience. Hopefully things will improve as swelling goes down, or you will be able to get a revision.

it is big, unusually so. i could see how if it&#39;s still swollen that it might recede between the vulva but i would be worried as well at 6wks.

It might be big for most srs but it‚Äôs not super big compared to how big some clits are. If it was properly hooded I would not mind that result at all.

i agree with you- as an ftmasc my clit is huge and it&#39;s ideal for me. unusual doesn&#39;t mean bad, just, not typical. i&#39;m assuming OP doesnt like it or she wouldnt have posted this

Yeah and that‚Äôs understandable. I just wanted to mention that it‚Äôs not necessarily bad. I‚Äôm actually interested in bottom surgery with a more prominent clitoris (though needs a good protective hood) and I usually see results where it‚Äôs completely hidden or buried which I could handle but is not ideal for me. If OP wants a more typical result she deserves to have that. And either way I think having an exposed glans can be really painful for some people and she definitely deserves a free revision to fix that.

I don‚Äôt think a big clit is a bad thing or always abnormal, but it is too exposed. There isn‚Äôt any hooding. I would bring this up to your surgeon.

We can‚Äôt see the inside- but everything else looks okay on the outside.

I‚Äôm a little concerned with the result.. I haven‚Äôt seen a neo vagina looks like this and having seem some of Jess Tings work and having consulted with him years ago, I‚Äôm a little upset that this is what he delivered on your body..
</p>
<p>
I totally understand your feelings about wanting your vagina to look as cis as possible. Having had mine for 7 years now, I‚Äôve learned that no matter how unclockable we may think our vaginas are or want them to be.. they will always have a slight nuance. So please don‚Äôt be hard on yourself.

Once the vagina is healed and your vaginal canal is healed post initial dilation routine, vulva revisions are typically quick procedures with faster recovery. I hope you get your revision at a timely manner üôèüèΩ

My Surgeon had me wait 6 months before my revision on my clitoris, in Montreal. I had a stitch under the hood that didn‚Äôt dissolve and it was causing discomfort. I also had a skin tag / fibrin thing on top of my clit under the hood that formed as a result of this tiny piece of stitch that was inside the tissue. All of it was addressed with general anesthesia. I didn‚Äôt have to undergo another epidural. I hope the same for you.
</p>
<p>
Knowing how Jess Tings wait times are, I would really push for it. If it‚Äôs really bothering you express this to them, they should to prioritize your well being. Please update on the matter. I would love to know how they handle the matter.

Congrats! That‚Äôs exciting, and Major Congrats on your Vagina üíó I hope they can address any issues or concerns you have during that surgery.
</p>
<p>
Be sure to express the physical discomfort and emotional stress it‚Äôs put you through. If you make it seem purely cosmetic, they may drag out the revision. I know the office usually has a tight schedule. Just a tip, that came to mind. We really have to advocate for ourselves in these instances, because sometimes the surgeon will really push to stand by his work and say nothing is wrong..

I did a revision around my urethra, clitoral hood, and labia minora at around 10 months and recovery was easy. It was outpatient and most healed after 4 weeks. Much less intensive and scary than the first surgery. You&#39;ll want a revision for your situation, but I wouldn&#39;t sweat the recovery too much. It feels easy compared to initial recovery at least. You&#39;ve got this. &lt;3

You opinion is the only one that counts!  If you don‚Äôt like it tell the doctor.  She may want to evaluate the surgery at 3 months to see if the swelling goes down.  If your still not satisfied go for a revision.

So at 6 weeks it shouldn‚Äôt be that swollen still‚Ä¶the good thing about a large clit though is SENSATION. Some surgeons do them too small and I‚Äôve heard of some people losing their clit due to not enough circulation to the area. From what I can see the only issue so far is that your clit is really big, but they can always fix that in a revision. Other than that it‚Äôs a really pretty üê±

The clitoris may recede as swelling goes down, but I wouldn&#39;t count on that. I would contact the surgeon immediately with my concerns.

Hi there, that‚Äôs great to here, if I may ask did yours look similar to mine at the 6 week mark and did you ever need to go back for a revision.

Update: just got off the phone with my surgeons office, I explained the situation to them and they were very understanding and said that if need be it would be a very simple revision to either reduce the size or add more to the hood, beyond that they did say what I expected which is the fact that it is still pretty early to determine what the actual size is, which is fine because I kind of agree with that myself. I‚Äôm gonna keep thinking positively and at worst I‚Äôll just have to run back in for a touch up later down the line.

Thank you all for your feedback, I don‚Äôt post a ton so it is really nice to here from so many of you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I would be happy with that clit size for sensation. As swelling goes down, I would imagine your clitoris will retreat into your vulva. Your labia is wonderful, and your vagina isn&#39;t so long, which is one of my personal biggest pet peeves with some neovagina post op results ive seen.

After maybe 10 weeks, healing has been much slower but i have seen the swelling going down. I have an opposite problem: my clit hood is very swelling and I can‚Äôt see the clit, but my surgeon said its normal and should be ok at about six months (that‚Äôs also the earliest she would be able to do a revision if I needed it).

Looks wonderful to be honest. Most of that is swelling but you can already see this will be a great result! Hang in there!

I think things look good. Personally I like big clits on partners and I&#39;m sure when swelling goes down things will even out.

It doesn&#39;t look like other results, the technique looks quite outdated, let&#39;s wait until you are fully recovered.
