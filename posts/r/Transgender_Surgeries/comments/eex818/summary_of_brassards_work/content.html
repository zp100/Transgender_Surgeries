Hi all,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m considering GRS with Dr. Brassard (because I&#39;m Canadian and it will be free).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been poking around in the wiki, but I&#39;m curious to hear some discussion around the general opinion about Dr. Brassard&#39;s work.
</p>
<p>
A concern of mine is the lack of inner labia that his technique produces - although it seems like only Suporn and Chett really get this right?  From what I read, though, most people are pleased with the sensation and depth Brassard produces.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, any sort of general consensus about Brassard and his work would be helpful.
</p>
<p>
(Fwiw, im weighing Brassard vs. paying out of pocket for Suporn or Chett.)

Hey. What do you mean hit or miss? Like some patients get them, some dont?
</p>
<p>
Are you at all willing to privately share a more recent picture? I&#39;m so sorry if that&#39;s a request that makes you feel uncomfortable.

No need to apologize at all. :)
</p>
<p>
All other results of the procedure are satisfactory for you? People do seem generally quite pleased with Brassard&#39;s work.

Thanks for that recommendation.
</p>
<p>
Tbh most of what ive seen of Brassard&#39;s work on the wiki here doesn&#39;t do it for my aesthetically. But this could also be that the photos all seem to be only a few months into the healing process?

It’s probably quite difficult to separate satisfaction with his work from the fact that it’s free. Maybe if you could look at those that pay to go to him and compare to those that pay to go to Thailand, but I’m not sure that’s possible.
</p>
<p>
There have been a few Canadians get the government to pay with Kamol in Thailand, but I don’t think it’s an option with Chettawut or Suporn.

That&#39;s news to me! My understanding is that no foreign doctors will be paid for.
</p>
<p>
Do you have any more information on those cases?

Thanks!

My understanding is that now that BC has the Vancouver clinic, they are not funding anything out of country.

Look at Kamol in the wiki for Danica Rain. She also posts here sometimes, and she’s got some sort of medical tourism business.

@katesvulva on twitter is a good example of 1~ year vag views. I’m at nearly six months and pretty bloody happy. The orgasms have been great. I’m a little chubby and it helps the appearance a lot. Super natural looking!

There may be another option.
</p>
<p>
A number of people had surgery in Thailand with Kamol covered. You might look up Danica Rain. And there was another thread with someone who was to Kamol and may also answer a few questions.
</p>
<p>
He basically offers three techniques, PI, a full graft surgery and colon methods. A full graft surgery using scrotal skin to line the canal may be an option.
</p>
<p>
From a number of other people who were there it seems that its a big place and it can be a bit anonymous at times, and there seem to be internal misunderstandings from time to time when transferring to different stations. And they may be using pain meds sparingly in the beginning so making clear that enough pain meds should be used may be a good idea.

I&#39;ll look into it though I&#39;m pretty sure BC won&#39;t be paying for any out of country surgeries now that there&#39;s a clinic in Vancouver.

You might look into it.
</p>
<p>
You could say a number of things : waiting time there is less than 4 months and it may be an idea to ask a therapist to attest strong dysphoria. And it may be possible to say that it is a more advanced technique because it is a full graft surgery and you are entitled to state of the art methods. And it is cheaper there. They even save this way. The hospital itself is internationally accredited, which only a few in southeast asia offer. It was pre authorized by OHIP. And offering to pay travel expenses out of pocket may also help.

From what I&#39;ve heard, their waiting list has gotten quite long compared to GRS Montreal.
</p>
<p>
For GRS Montreal, I believe you need to get the OHIP authorization done and sent in to Montreal, reach out to them, and send in whatever else they ask for. If your HRT provider is experienced with trans care, they have probably gone through the process before.
