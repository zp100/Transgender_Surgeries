Do you mind if I ask how long it took from consultation to actual appointment do you know how far out they book?

Well when I went to consultation they wanted me back in two months. Dr. Pang isn&#39;t booked out that far right now and that&#39;s a big reason why I went to him. Id guess at this point he may be booked 6 months out. But then again when I thought it would be delayed the next opening was two weeks. People drop all the time for whatever reason, which is how I got bumped up two weeks to begin with. The sooner you can get in, the better.

Thanks. The nurses and doctors told me there were no complications and I had no bruising. I am pretty excited at how meticulous Dr. Pang is with his stitch work too.

I feel a lot. A lot more than I thought I would. I feel my clitoris and my labia and I can feel sensations through clothes. As I work on my muscles and using them in new ways, I suspect I&#39;ll have full sensitivity soon enough. Still a lot of swelling too and as that passes i&#39;ll have even more feeling to gain.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Pang uses the same technique Dr. Ting uses. He is one of Dr. Tings partners. I had my consultation scheduled for last September. It probably would have been about this time that I would have had that final consultation with Dr. Ting if not longer. I&#39;m 31, and in incredible shape and health, so time is a factor in that decision to see Pang. But also his results were great from what I saw. Dr pang is really nice too and he has really good bedside manner.
