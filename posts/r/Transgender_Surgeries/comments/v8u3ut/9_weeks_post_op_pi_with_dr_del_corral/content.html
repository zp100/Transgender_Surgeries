<p>
how does the clitoral area feel? and how has your life changed regarding clothes? that&#39;s what bothers me the most...

I&#39;m just starting to get feeling and my clitoris now. It&#39;s a bit weird because it seems like the top of the hood is the clitoris, as opposed to being its own thing inside the hood. But it probably just needs more healing also. I don&#39;t think much has changed for clothes except that I&#39;m less panicky about tight skirts or spandex.

Yes - more healing definetly!  My surgery was 8/4/2020 and while I think I have all my feeling back NOW, I swear I keep getting more as time progresses. Also, there&#39;s always been numbness in the labia majora, but lately I&#39;ve been noticing that seems to be almost resolved too.

Are you happy with the results?
</p>
<p>
What made you choose Dr. Del Corral?
</p>
<p>
Will you get revision in the future?

I think so. It&#39;s still not fully healed, so still waiting to see what it ultimately shapes up as. It&#39;s puffier than I expected and my clit seems a bit odd, but I didn&#39;t have any major complications, so that was a relief. I haven&#39;t looked into revisions at all.

He was close enough that I didn&#39;t have to in a different state for weeks at a time. He was covered by my insurance, and didn&#39;t have a three-year waiting list. And I also just saw pictures of his work and thought it looked good.
