That looks amazing! Also really appreciate the thorough write up. I contacted Amani(Saphira) about another surgery and ended up not going ahead with it but she was super helpful even at that early discussion stage so I&#39;m not surprised and glad to hear they were excellent.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m planning to go for the same surgery with Dr Theerapong in the next 9 months or so and am in the stage of finishing up laser/saving. If you don&#39;t mind answering: How did they confirm your laser was done enough? and how much should I need all up, including the surgery/flights/accom/expenses etc?

Thank you!
</p>
<p>
For the laser/hair removal, Saphira just relies on you to give an honest answer. I checked visually about 6 weeks after one of my later laser sessions and there were no signs of regrowth, and got another 2 sessions after that to be sure üòÖ
</p>
<p>
Total medical expenses, including a few optional extras and Amani&#39;s/equivalent care package (dilators, home medical supplies etc) are ballpark 700,000 baht/$19,800 USD I spent about $900 USD on flights, and $800 on Airbnb. I spent perhaps $600-$700 on food and souvenirs; food is very affordable and there are lots of options.
</p>
<p>
Ballpark total about $22,000 USD minus my Blepharoplasty :)
</p>
<p>
Edit: PIV surgical fee is 300,000 baht, and colon vaginoplasty sits somewhere between these iirc*

Amazing thank you! I assumed as such, i&#39;m at around 5/6 sessions so far and its already 90% gone but yeah probably worth doing at least another 6 or so just to be sure. That&#39;s also pretty close to what I guesstimated so I&#39;m happy i&#39;m in the right zone. Thank you for sharing!

Seems very good. Couple of questions if I may. Yoummentions that you dealt with both letters there after single consultations with the appropriate professionals? How was the years lived experience captured? As part of the psych consultations? Sounds like you spent 6 days in post surgery recovery in the hospital and then a period (10 days?) recovering off site. How was the plane trip back 2-2.5 weeks after a big surgery on the area you were going to be using intensively during that flight? (How long was the flight?)

I didn&#39;t need to provide any proof of RLE/lived experience. The Psychiatrist appointments were very easy. Each appointment was ~5 minutes, and they asked very conventional questions (eg. How long did I want to be a women, what toys did I play with as a child, do you have a boyfriend etc.). I answered honestly, but as long as your answers are close enough to what they want to hear, you will be fine! They also want to make sure you understand this surgery is permanent and irreversible. It was honestly very easy, definitely not worth worrying about üòä
</p>
<p>
I spent almost 7 full days in hospital, with surgery on day 2. It will be 18 more days in Thailand; my flight is later this week üôå I dont expect my flight to be a problem. You&#39;ll have a doughnut cushion to sit on, and a lot of the pain is gone shortly after the stitches come out. I&#39;ve also been given some medication to help me sleep on the plane.

I Am definitely considering this for end of 2024 or early 2025 now. I‚Äôs like to maybe look at losing some weight first and hair removal takes some time. Maybe you‚Äôd be so kind as DM with how I can get hold of the resources you‚Äôve been using when you get back to the US. Another big concern is how the flight back is, so you‚Äôll know that them as well.

Hi, I did 14 sessions of laser hair removal in total iirc, starting in September 2022. I will 100% keep an eye out for stray hairs, but Dr Theerapong and Saphira weren&#39;t concerned at all. I&#39;ve done electrolysis for facial hair which worked incredibly well, so I would definitely consider this option too if available. From my understanding, electrolysis will take 12+ months too. Best of luck!

Time wise, how far apart did you have your laser hair removal sessions? I see you said 14 sessions total. When did your last one happen?

Thank you for writing all that up. I love reading detailed accounts of such a life changing experience. It&#39;s wonderful you&#39;ve been treated with such care, respect, and empathy during the process. I hope the rest goes well for you and safe travels back home when the time comes. ‚ù§Ô∏è

He can do good work if he wants to , Nice job post op , Lucky all I can say - I wasted my time going to him last year for aesthetics but the Sigmoid Canal I got  I give him works well at least , one thing appears fixed But ? - the rest is just a mess really with anything aesthetically done by Theerapong - I‚Äôve been hard  core ‚ÄúGhosted‚Äù which is basically telling me to Fk‚Äô! Off ! Nicely !- never would talk or give me a consult before my 11 hour and blood transfusion doing a Sigmoid Vaginoplasty , all I got was a 1 hour at most physical exam with 4 other people hanging around but No private consult Wow ? - It was my Experience dealing with him what can I say - He‚Äôs better than Kamol for sure - choose well the 1 st time because no one wants to touch another surgeons mess quite frankly post op original !!

I&#39;m sorry to hear that, and I hope you manage to get the result you&#39;re looking for in the future. I&#39;ve heard mixed things about going direct through interplast, and I got let down by my coordinator for my FFS; it hurts, and just makes the whole experience even worse.

I didn‚Äôt go through Interplast directly, it was through the old Siam Transformative and became the problem for me Wow !! , everything was caused by this greedy first name starting with ‚ÄúBecky ‚Äù just a snarky lying SOB !! When I 1 st met this person I sensed this from the git go  really !! - It was shear garbage to get me in the Mali Hospital to secure her little profits and I literally never had not once a talk/consult with Dr. Theerapong and never met this other surgeon either , such bullsh#t going on .
</p>
<p>
This ‚ÄúBecky‚Äù said my physical was my consult and could have asked at this time , just crap ! It was all about securing her profit - I have almost exactly the same mess originally from Kamol 2019 , looks like nothing aesthetically was even done ?
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs been over a year and I can tell you Theerapong doesn‚Äôt give a fk! Was my experience caused by &#34;Becky&#34; for a past patient obviously ?? He knows !! And he‚Äôs far from being a Stupid surgeon and what is most disturbing is it appears everyone else that gets surgery from him he takes the time to really talk to you and show diagrams etc. how he‚Äôll approach a revision etc. I got nothing !!
</p>
<p>
Supposedly he‚Äôs a gentle nice person , never experienced it ? - it&#39;s not what I got ?  just Bullsh#t , the hospital staff were fine all I can say but ?- my experience was crap and being deliberately Ghosted by him Interplast/Theerapong‚Äù personally now tells a lot about him to me ! so if this is the way they&#39;ll deal with me post op 2022 I‚Äôll ‚ÄúSLAG HIM‚Äù Sorry , he‚Äôs not worth a ‚ÄúSH#T‚Äù Then ,  Wow ! really ?
</p>
<p>
If this is his attitude toward a patient who wanted to ‚ÄúTRUST‚Äù ? then he‚Äôs just a cut just above Kamol nothing better sorry to say !  - and I have  a mess still because of this asshole ‚ÄúBecky&#34; sticking her nose in my business and is  basically just a bloody Taxi Driver out for profits for the old (Siam Transformative) which is now defunct as a business that is an idiot who caused all my problems because of greed.
</p>
<p>
I get the impression she told ‚ÄúTheerapong ‚Äú I didn‚Äôt want a Consult and just do the surgery in Thai to secure her money by getting me quickly into the Mali Hospital, something is not right  with this Bitch ! being an ‚ÄúEX‚Äù US Texas Patriot who grew up in Bangkok because her father was in the Military early 1960‚Äôs so she learned full reading/writing in Thai Language in a Thai school growing up in Bangkok and became the interpreter for Siam Transformative.
</p>
<p>
Who‚Äôd be stupid enough to have an 11 hour plus blood transfusion Sigmoid surgery without a consult.   ‚ÄúI guess me‚Äù    something had to have been ‚ÄúSAID‚Äù  by this bitch ‚ÄúBecky‚Äù in Thai to  ‚ÄúFORGO‚Äù   a one on one consult with Dr. Theerapong I never got !!     a lot of money Spent including flight 29k Canadian dollars Wow!  and nothing done Aesthetically and I‚Äôm still smoke‚Äôn mad over a year now because of this sh#t going on at the time with this ‚ÄúBecky‚Äù charlatan money grabber !!   and to boot now I‚Äôm Black Listed !!

Hey,
</p>
<p>
Amani Thailand recommended a few options; some hotels, and some Airbnb&#39;s. I had a browse and picked my favourite (Airbnb in my case), and sent the booking details over so they can drop you off from the airport, and so the nurses can visit for aftercare.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps :)

How much was the surgery care package? Was it part of the 600k baht or was it on top of that?

IIRC, 70k total (50k for the care package, and 20k for nursing care 2x per day, for 10 days post op). This is on top of the surgical fee.

Worth every penny for me :)

Yeah, about that depending on exchange rate!
</p>
<p>
I came alone. I was hobbling for the first 2 weeks, walking uninhibited after that, and 99% back to &#39;normal&#39; and sitting without a doughnut cushion after 6 or 7 weeks.

<p>
There&#39;s no guarantee of a super speedy recovery as everyone heals differently, but this was my experience.

Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Only other thing I can think to ask is about hair removal. I&#39;m just about done with my facial electrolysis and was gonna start down there once I&#39;m done. I want to clear it as quick as possible though, so specifically what does need to be removed and what can stay? cause I wanna keep as much of it as I can.
</p>
<p>
And I may dm you at some point it i need help booking, lol üòã

The midline tissues make up the new vulva, so you&#39;ll want to clear the base of the penis, the scrotum (perhaps a 2&#34; strip down the middle) and definitely the perineum; this makes up part of the vaginal canal. This last bit is incredibly difficult to remove later on if not cleared beforehand.
