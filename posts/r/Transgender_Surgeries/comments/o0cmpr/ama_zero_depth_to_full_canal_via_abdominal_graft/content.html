Congratulations! Your abdominal seam should heal up and mostly vanish if you take good care of it, so be gentle on yourself, keep it covered when you go out and about, and as soon as it is healed and fused start using whatever scar cream or gel or covering your surgeon recommends. The ends will be the most susceptible to scarring, so be aware of them.
</p>
<p>
Above everything, just be very careful moving around, it will be very easy to hurt yourself without realizing while on meds, because almost every motion you make from getting up to walking to lifting things to sitting or laying back down involves the abdominal muscles a bit.

Thank you for this!  I will be super careful.
</p>
<p>
My team does all our office build outs, and we are wiring two new offices in August and I&#39;ve already planned to have an additional person with us to pull wiring as no way I will be doing it!  There shouldn&#39;t be anything that causes me issue with it I hope - wife and daughter have taken my chores and I&#39;m on STD for 8 weeks so I could hopefully be good!  üòÜ
</p>
<p>
I will ask about what to put on the seem but wander what others used?  I have a supply of vitamin e oil already.

I tried vitamin e oil for a bit but it was so messy I gave up on that quickly. I ended up mostly just using Scar Away silicone gel for mine, which seemed to work semi-effectively. There are some expensive topical anti-scar gels that I haven&#39;t tried cause of the price, but I hear they may work well.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately for me, just due to how my body tends to heal up (I am prone to healing too fast and getting permanent marks), the ends of my abdominal line are rather scarred, with the middle area across my abdomen being almost invisible these days. The ends have been very slowly smoothing out over time tho, so it&#39;s not rough, just visible. If you go gentle on yourself you hopefully shouldn&#39;t have to worry about similar.

Thank you!  Yeh I heal fast too - fortunate my zero depth vagina scars did very well - I cant see my canal or my labia now so not sure if there is extensive healing that needs done there now...  but I will absolutely keep on my abdomen and make sure it heals well!  I actually have a decent shaped body and I wanna enjoy bikini seasons ü•∞

Best of luck! Once it heals make sure not to let the sun touch it and to keep it hydrated,  the scar will be barely noticeable if you treat it right!

So. Wow. They can use abdominal skin for the graft? What made you decide on that? As opposed to using colon or peritoneal tissue? Im still up in the air of whether I want/need srs. But knowing stuff always helps. I wish you a speedy and complication free recovery.

Oh wow. That&#39;s strange to hear, as peritoneal has been used since the 70s iirc.
</p>
<p>
I do know one woman who had it recently, and the ppt tissue did shrink at the join near the introitus.
</p>
<p>
I actually didn&#39;t know a graft was an option. If I do decide in the future. I see if the surgeon can chick in a tummy tuck while their at it lol.
