Hi all,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m trying to find out the current cost of SRS at Supporn&#39;s Clinic.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve emailed them and they didn&#39;t reply. On their website is says they don&#39;t publish the costs, which seems odd.
</p>
<p>
So can some kind person please tell me what Supporn is charging in 2019? I appreciate that by the time I might get an appointment, it may have gone up, but this will help me decide where to get the op done.
</p>
<p>
Thanks very much in advance.
</p>

700,000 Baht is about $23,000 USD so you don&#39;t need to do the conversion.

This seems like the current standard price for GCS without insurance.

Thanks  very much everybody.
</p>
<p>
And I  just got a reply from Supporn clinics, so yes I was just being a bit impatient.
</p>
<p>
Current prices in baht.
</p>
<p>
Date Jan-Jun 2020
</p>
<p>
Suporn 650,000
</p>
<p>
Dr Bank 565,000
</p>
<p>
Dr Prae 550,000
</p>
<p>
So Supporn still cheaper than the London Transgender Clinic, which is my other choice option as I am in London, and they have an excellent reputation too.
</p>
<p>
London Transgender Clinic is circa ₤29000. Supporn is circa ₤17200 in 2020 and both operations are very similar I understand
</p>
<p>
But then factor in the additional costs of an extended stay in Thailand, for myself and my husband, and it would soon be the same or close to the same cost, as having the op in London. Time to think.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again.

<p>
I think they are quite different operations as these things go.
</p>
<p>
Have you looked in the wiki here?

19k was my total cost. I probably could have spent a little less but I enjoyed my room service a lot.

Which doctor did you do SRS? How much time remained after surgery? Are you satisfied with the result of the SRS?

Have you done Non-Penile Skin Inversion Technique?
</p>
<p>
I looked at your photos and it looks good. Have problems with dilation?

I don’t know exactly what method they use but dr bank used whatever method suporn created.
</p>
<p>
Thanks! I’m mostly happy with it. It’s not perfect and the angles I show don’t really show off some of its flaws. But the sensation is nice and I’m overall happy with it!
</p>
<p>
Dilating was harder for me than most people who went to suporn/bank it seems. The first three months I was dilating like 8 hours a day
</p>
<p>
Now I dilate in like 20 minutes no problem

When you corresponded with the clinic, they did not ask which SRS technique do you want to choose? Or in the clinic itself?
</p>
<p>
You are a pretty girl and I am happy for you.
</p>
<p>
I regret that I did not start HRT at 24, but only seven years later.

Ummm the only talking about which method I’d use was with dr bank himself when I got there for surgery. They are easy to correspond with before hand though so if I had questions or requests I could have made them before the trip was scheduled.
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much ☺️
</p>
<p>
Everyone wishes they started HRT earlier. That’s the curse of it all. And even if you’re the worlds youngest person to start HRT then you’d still just wish you were cis anyways. Don’t let negative thoughts like that get in your way! Transitioning is doable at any age 💕 Pretty sure my hips already fused by the time I started cause I have had like 0 growth in that department.  I made due with what I have though.

Sorry, I didn’t understand, did you choose the SRS technique or did you use the method that they use by default?
</p>

Thanks for the support. I have a long way to go.

I went with what they use by default. The suporn method is different that what they use in the west.  ☺️just take it one step at a time.

They take 2 or 3 days to respond, from my experience and what I&#39;ve read from others. It does seem to go up about 15-25k per six months?
