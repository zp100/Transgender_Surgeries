Had rhinoplasty, trach shave, fat redistribution done on the 29th with Tommy Liu.
</p>
<p>
This was the first day I&#39;ve worn makeup since surgery. Feeling really good I&#39;ve been very low energy but it&#39;s starting to come back.
</p>
<p>
I want to thank everyone on here sharing their journeys and perspectives. This sub has been a treasure trove of information.

You look great! I’m very happy for you. Trying to get on new insurance so I can go see him myself since they dropped Medicare patients. Happy healing.

Yeah it was very upsetting. His work is incredible and has the natural look that I want. I also need some functional nose work which I think he does as well. Anyway, happy healing and I’m so pleased that your experience has been so good. I live in Washington state as well so Seattle is not terribly far from me.

Seriously hoping things work out for you. People should have their choice of surgeons it&#39;s so dumb.

He fixed my deviated septum. I may need a revision on my brow lift because one eyebrow/eyelid is a lot more droopy than the other but other than that I&#39;m pretty much stoked.

It all comes down to insurance. I have Medicare, and even though it’s possible to get coverage it’s hard. He did take it but then dropped it. The reason I was so upset is because when I called to book my appointment he did take Medicare, and his office assured me I was covered. I waited for months and got the necessary psychological evaluation, and then they called me 10 days before my visit and told me they had decided to drop it. I understand that insurance changes, but I do feel like they should at least have seen all of the patients they already had booked. I hear they now have a new office staff though, and I feel like this is probably more of an issue with the previous team. Also, I’m trying to get on my partner’s work insurance which covers pretty much everything so I am super hoping I can go see him using that. I think his work is just great.

You look beautiful, congratulations! My suggestion, as an aesthetician, go get your eyebrows micro bladed. It will highlight your eyes better than your current shape.

Thank you! I&#39;m doing well at this point. Had a lot of surgery last year. Thankfully I get a break from surgery till November. I got my ass kicked by that first round of FFS.
</p>
<p>
I swear to God when they took my brow bone off they scrambled my brain up or something because I was pretty much just a puddle for a solid month. I had a really hard time with top surgery too. But that&#39;s another story.
</p>
<p>
This year is all about enjoying my new body and having fun.
