not really! I&#39;ve heard concerns about this but honestly recovery has been easier than I thought- the &#34;t-rex&#34; arms Dr Eppley describes seems to be more of a guideline than a rule, though it&#39;s tough to say for certain given my pain level.
</p>
<p>
In office he talked about 3cm being the maximum a clavicle fracture could occur without losing range of motion, so that&#39;s what he did here.

well, that&#39;s probably up for you to decide in my photos, but I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ve got more weight to lose- since I&#39;ve been at a hotel I don&#39;t have a way to see how close to my finals results these are weight-wise, though the shoulders are pretty clear side-by-side

Sorry to hear about the misgendering. It&#39;s unfortunate, that he and his staff seem to be the only surgery team that I&#39;ve heard of deliberately misgendering trans patients. If they are doing that, it&#39;s because they choose to do it, not because it&#39;s a medical procedure.
</p>
<p>
Not that I would go to Eppley for anything, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a deal breaker for a lot of trans people, whether he&#39;s a good surgeon or not. It&#39;s disrespectdul and unnecessary. Especially when you&#39;re personally footing the bill to the tune of 40k. I&#39;m glad you mentioned it.

3cm combined on both sides, meaning he took off 1.5cm per side or 3 cm on each side adding up to 6cm?

Actually it&#39;s not that normal, especially for medical professionals to be so rude and misgender ppl.
</p>
<p>
I live in the southern part of the state near Louisville. So, no this is not typical behavior for Drs.

well, I don&#39;t know if it was purposeful, the anesthesiologist corrected himself a couple of times, and my voice was probably not great early in the morning anyway. it was unpleasant, sure, but he&#39;s one of the only guys out there doing this stuff so I guess he does what he wants :/

Ok-
</p>
<p>
He followed up with me today and to his credit gendered me consistent with my presentation, so I don&#39;t want to make him out to be a bad person if he was better about it today and all; his staff is just sort of more unwelcome gender-wise than other places I&#39;ve been for surgery, even in the midwest!

Hey, know this post was a few months ago; I&#39;m considering getting one or both of these operations with Eppley. Do you have any idea of cost? Also, how are you doing? Has it all been ok? :)

Based on reading ur full story on imgur, I must say that it v much isn&#39;t a safe practice.
</p>
<p>
Prescribing dangerous doses just to be spiteful is not professional or medically safe. None of those ppl should be practicing medicine if they aren&#39;t willing to uphold their oaths.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad that ur safe and r recovering well, especially after up-dosing u on meds, bc they wanted to be aholes and deem u someone ur not, even when medically it wasn&#39;t save for them to do. They could end up killing someone if they use the wrong dose especially anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
I feel like I would love to have this done on my back ribs, if I was going to do anything to my body, but with them prescribing meds like u described, even with the purposeful misgendering IDC abt that, but meds, especially rit before, dure, after can kill.
</p>
<p>
If the slightest thing goes wrong u can sue for malpractice, just bc of how they handled ur medications.

<p>
I wanted to clarify this part as someone who works in anesthesia. The doses for medications are not always calculated and given in exact increments. They are usually given based on body weight, age, and sex as an approximation. I highly doubt the anesthesiologist was being malicious. There was essentially zero risk of them killing her with anti-anxiety pre-medication. It was most likely the benzodiazepine midazolam that was given. The worst that would happen is she stops breathing, but by the subs of it she wasn&#39;t close to that point. Furthermore, if she had stopped breathing, she was under the care of an anesthesiologist whose bread and butter is making people stop breathing and intubating them afterwards.
</p>
<p>
I felt compelled to write this because I didn&#39;t want OP to feel like her life was in danger. I definitely agree that it was beyond shitty that they misgendered her repeatedly. That is inexcusable. They did not almost kill her though.

Absolutely, thank you for sharing your expertise! I didn&#39;t mean to make it sound as though I was at risk of death due to a misgendering on their part; it just meant, as you pointed out, that they upped the pre-operative benzodiazapines for when they laid me down to make all the marks on my back.
</p>
<p>
Benzos are in my experience serious stuff which is why I was surprised that it happened, but I think you&#39;re right that if you&#39;re going to OD on a depressant medication it&#39;s best to do it in a medical setting!

Thanks for your reply, I was worried after I wrote it that I had &#39;well ackshually&#39; vibes and didn&#39;t want to be an asshole. Your post did not make it sound like your life was in danger. It was the top comment on your post that many people were upvoting that made it sound like you could have died. I have seen a lot of misinformation on Reddit surrounding anesthesia and try to correct it where I can.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, it&#39;s horrible that they were misgendering you and you could absolutely make a complaint based on that, especially because your legal sex marker is female. I&#39;m sorry you had to deal with that, but I am so thrilled for you that you had incredible results. Good luck with the recovery and all the best ❤️

Hi! You may remember me as the person talking about shoulder and ribs removal a few months ago, and yesterday, I finally had surgery in Indianapolis with Dr. Barry Eppley!
</p>
<p>
Heres the imgur link with more of my thoughts and processes so far- I recommend taking a look if you&#39;re curious about the details:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/ATc1NOl">https://imgur.com/gallery/ATc1NOl
</a>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m super excited even at just day 1 back at the hotel, so I&#39;m going to post a few of my favorite comparisons I have from today and yesterday and do a write up like I did for my FFS on imgur before.
</p>
<p>
And hi, haters at TERF Twitter! You were wrong, I&#39;m not &#34;permanently disgusted&#34; I just want to look and act in a way natural to me and have a body a boyfriend could actually want- I&#39;ll get there! :)
</p>
<p>
And after all, how couldn&#39;t you be happy with results like these? There are so many tank tops and bathing suits I can pull off now that it&#39;s...finally the end of summer :P
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if you have any questions or comments not covered in my imgur, please post them! In my one day of experience (but a lot of happiness so far) I hope that someday this becomes an MtF staple just like FFS became, because I&#39;m so happy to not have to stare a linebacker back in the mirror anymore, which I&#39;m guessing isn&#39;t a feeling only I have. So if there&#39;s anything
<em>
not
</em>
in the imgur step-by-step I posted, please let me know, I&#39;ll answer what I can :)

Congrats on the surgery! You said you want a body a boyfriend could want, and I just wanna say you don’t need any surgeries to be appealing to men, you do these things for yourself and to be comfortable in your body. There’s plenty of men who would be attracted to you pre surgery. I understand tho, I sometimes feel undesirable too. Anyways happy healing

He was really, really nice up to this point, like in my profile history about my setting up a consult and doing it with him; I was honestly taken aback because even when I didn&#39;t pass as commonly as I do now I was gendered consistent with my presentation by my past surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Besides, what was I going  to do, say no and lose my surgery fee? I just hope the future of trans care is better, more sensitive, and much more well understood.
</p>
<p>
Case in point- I&#39;m arguing with a random imgur guy about whether your chromosomes or your neurotransmitter sites bind to you neurotransmitters! There&#39;s a heck of lot of illiteracy out there.

Honestly, I&#39;d have taken the hit on the surgery fee. I&#39;ve been botched by surgeons before and misgendering is a major red flag. You only get one go at this. You can earn more money but it&#39;s pretty hard to unfuck surgical mistakes.
</p>
<p>
Also, Eppley is known to have pursued  a libel case against a patient he botched to the point where she killed herself. He&#39;s kind of known for being a dick.

Well, take my opinion with a grain of salt, depending on how much proper gendering matters to you- my dad has ever gendered me correctly in my life, but that doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t sometimes do nice things like by me birthday gifts. It&#39;s sort of a give and take, in my mind, ifthat makes sense?

Proper gendering is a sign of basic respect and human decency. People that misgender me are no longer part of my life.
</p>
<p>
Any surgeon that markets their procedures to trans clientele should understand that. I&#39;m honestly flabbergasted to hear they would do such a thing. I wouldn&#39;t have put up with that bullshit.

I must be making it sound much worse than it is, a little &#34;he&#34; or &#34;him&#34; there doesn&#39;t bother me hugely if it&#39;s for $40k worth of surgery to make me pass better to
<em>
different
</em>
people- you know what I mean?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to grad school next semester and I don&#39;t want to be instantly clocked by zoomers/millennials who know how, so that kind of thing cuts deep as not a respect thing for me but as a &#34;uh-oh should I be concerned?&#34; thing. Does that make sense? That&#39;s my approach, anyway

I&#39;m genuinely happy it worked out favorably for you. Based on your photos I don&#39;t think you were highly clockable before. Cis women have all kinds of body shapes.
</p>
<p>
I understand your motivations, but consider this for the future. If a surgeon cannot be bothered to respect your pronouns why would you trust them to cut you open and operate on you? That person doesn&#39;t view you as a human being worthy of respect, they see you as a paycheck or a slab of meat on their operating table.

The sugereon is a surgeon, not a gender studies major, I don&#39;t blame him for calling it like he sees it- I don&#39;t want to to be tip-toedaround to be made fun of behind my back all my life for being-what appears to them to be-a man in a dress.
</p>
<p>
Like, I&#39;d rather not assert my pronouns- i know some people like that buti would rather just be assumed to be female andove on with it. If I&#39;m making any sense?? sorry, it&#39;s late!

Eppley didn&#39;t just wake up yesterday and start operating on Transwomen. He&#39;s been at this a long time. I bet he didn&#39;t didn&#39;t address you with male pronouns during your virtual consult? No, of course he didn&#39;t. He waited to show total disrespect for who you are until you were past the point of no return with fees paid and safely parked in his office. No one should blame you for not walking and getting what you paid for at that point. You went into it blind and I&#39;m glad you had the courage to tell that part of your story.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, let this be a lesson for the next person that seeks out rib removal and shoulder reduction. Based on the OP&#39;s experience, you can expect Eppley and his entire staff to completely disrespect your gender and the very medical condition for which you are seeking treatment. How&#39;s that for irony and --Do No harm?
</p>
<p>
At least you know
<strong>
up-front
</strong>
now, what you are getting yourself into.

Do we really have to judge Eppley, here? I care far more about results and minizing risk than getting misgendered at his office.

No, you&#39;re making perfect sense. The person you&#39;re replying to isn&#39;t respecting your point of view. What works for you is your business, and that other person trying to convince you that misgendering is enough of an issue to throw away life-saving, gender-affirming care (which, as you know, takes years to get and and the deposit is no joke) is being rude.
</p>
<p>
What kind of surgeon you&#39;re willing to work with is a subjective experience, so there&#39;s really no point in this person telling you that you should do it their way.

She wouldn&#39;t be &#34;throwing away life affirming gender care. Eppley is not the only surgeon who performs this surgery. At worse she would have been delaying care. Ending a relationship with a surgeon that doesn&#39;t have your best interests in mind, no matter how difficult that might be, is better than being botched. And don&#39;t pretend she&#39;d just lose all her money, that&#39;s not how this works. I&#39;ve had FFS twice and paid cash both times. If you cancel you don&#39;t lose all your money, only a fraction of it. In terms of losing money that&#39;s nothing compared to what it takes to fix surgical errors.
</p>
<p>
OP is free to go to whatever surgeons she wants and allow them to treat her however she wants, I&#39;m just offering my perspective.

God, Imgur can often be such a cesspool of ignorant bigots, I am so sorry! I hope you won&#39;t go out of your way to argue with people who aren&#39;t acting in good faith and willing to actually have their minds changed. If I were you, I&#39;d change that photo gallery to &#34;private&#34; so randoms just browsing the site are less-likely to see it from there, but we here can still view it with the link you provide.

<p>
Anyway, my jaw dropped and my jowls popped seeing your spectacular surgery results, congrats! Thank you for sharing, I&#39;m really happy for you that you&#39;re happy, and you look incredible! I wonder if after the post-surgery swelling is fully gone in some months, the reduction of your shoulders and waist could become even more prominent.

As much as that would suck moving forward with a surgeon that botches you will be much worse. Ignore red flags at your own peril.

wait... wait... you can do that?! Like is it safe? Does it make the body look weird afterwards? Like the rest of the body doesn&#39;t fit? Is this often seen as a medically necessary surgery for trans people? For an example if all trans care was included in a Medicare for all bill and it passed, I could get this? Like my shoulders are like a linebackers. Mostly because of my wide chest and back.

Sure they can do it!

<p>
As for disfigurement, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had any based on my pictures so far yet- and don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll make another post if something does go wrong:
<a href="https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ATc1NOl" rel="nofollow">https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ATc1NOl

As for how it works:

</a>
</p>
<p>
And no, I extremely doubt almost any insurance company would cover this surgery, especially since most places don&#39;t even cover FFS, a (probably?) more important tool for relieving gender dyshoria.
</p>
<p>
It sucks, but I imagine the public backlash would be crazy if someone were to sign such a mandate into law or something!

It was already in a bill that passed the house. It was Bernie sanders Medicare for all bill and during his campaign he said that all trans care will be covered in his Medicare for all bill.

I&#39;m happy that you are satisfied and feeling better with yourself. After all, that&#39;s the ultimate goal of every procedure. The photos you posted here seem to have been taken from different distances, but even so it seems there&#39;s massive difference based on your hair. In the imgur ones I don&#39;t see such a drastic different, possibly due to the different clothing. Again, when I pay attention to the hair, big difference. I honestly can&#39;t see differences in the waist, but that probably has to do with you wearing a blouse.
</p>
<p>
Now, what I think is unacceptable is to have a doctor and their team misgender a patient. He doesn&#39;t have to be a gender specialist to treat people with dignity and respect. I think it&#39;s very good that you&#39;re talking about your experience here and I hope no one goes to him again. In your place I&#39;d also have swallowed and moved on, since you&#39;d paid the fee already.
</p>
<p>
He clearly has no respect for trans people and I&#39;m tired of doctors who just want our money.

You may not have any short term issues, but it&#39;s the long term issues you may have with this surgery is a concern. If this was a completely safe surgery more surgeons would be doing it and it would be a standard surgery offered for trans patients. Changing the geometry of your shoulders will functionally change how you body works.

I contacted him by Email a few month ago. He sayd the operation is not that complicated and he allready did it to other Trans persons. I m living in Germany and so i have to pay for this surgery by myself. The costs will be around 12 to 15k in €.

No, not really. I&#39;m even unsure If i will do this surgery since that i lost a signifikant amount of muscle mass on my upper body in the last few month. I have plans for a few surgerys next year starting in January with a nose job,  jaw/chin in March and so on. Clavicle shortening is IF i do it on the end of my list.

Oh, that is fantastic news! I&#39;d be very interested in this (going to the US for this seems both very expensive and inconvenient, given how restricted you are during convalesence).

I&#39;m very tempted to do rib removal out all the other cosmetic surgeries because i also think my waist line is limited by it flaring out. Would you be willing to answer questions on that a bit more?
</p>
<p>
Like cautionary statements from your physician for post op? Recovery? Scarring? Can it actually help narrow your waist more? I mean most people are like it exposes more of your important organs removing ribs...... but i mean literally you&#39;re trying to avoid blows to the chest that would cause damage anyways..... but most of the damaging blows are that are substantial enough to do damage.... causes damage. Is like car, you want to avoid causing damage to it at all costs anyways lol.

Sure, the cost of the both procedures was about $40k, cheaper then they would be otherwise since they could come during the same day and same anesthesia
</p>
<p>
Recovery is supposed to go on for about a month, with the range of motion of your arm to gradually increase. But honestly my back/rib pain has been worse even if I bump my arm out of position.

You look great.  Just please be careful healing up.  Shoulder resection can make the bone really weak for quite a while and any damage to the area can result in needing additional surgery/repairs!
</p>
<p>
Also if your shoulders full width originally was 16 inches, I&#39;m envious.  Think my shoulders are 18-19inches &gt;.&gt;

Being able to speak freely about my eating disorder and my feelings on weight has helped me acknoewledge I have a problem, but I can imagine having the kind of language I use with myself bleed over into talk with someone else in a harmful way.

I didn&#39;t mean to offend you at all, I spoke unconsciously- I&#39;m sorry I did! I&#39;ll edit it out.

Thank you for sharing so much! I quite appreciated reading your experience and while it’s frustrating they misgendered and prescribed the wrong dose, your results are great! I had no idea either surgery existed so it’s very cool to see both the procedures and the outcome. Cheers!

Yes, and it&#39;s a concern I had going in too, but while even when you&#39;re sore you still have your range of motion past the elbow, you&#39;re free to insert and manipulate a dilator.
