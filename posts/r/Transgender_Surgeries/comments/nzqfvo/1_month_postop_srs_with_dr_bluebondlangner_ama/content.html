Can you go into details about your hair removal process?

Yes! So I had one session of electrolysis, hated it, and decided to do laser instead. Dr. Bluebond-Langner only requires some hair removal so I was able to do about 6 sessions of laser, which cleared most of the hairs I had (for reference, I‚Äôm very fair with lighter, finer hairs), and whatever I couldn‚Äôt get, was scraped during surgery. And that was enough! I highly recommend doing laser over electrolysis if your hair type/time frame permits. It was SO much better than electrolysis.

Thx for the detailed response! People always say that you should do electrolysis over laser, but Dr. BBL‚Äôs office assured me laser would be fine too. I‚Äôm definitely doing laser. Congrats and wishing you a speedy recovery :)

I agree. I think for the technique they use at NYU, electrolysis isn‚Äôt necessary. Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

You hated it because of the pain? Have you done it with local anesthesia or nothing? I‚Äôm doing laser down there and I already find it really painful so I don‚Äôt know if I could stand electrolysis...

What kind of wait time did you have between your consult and surgery date? I have a consult with them in August! üíú

Not OP, obviously, but I&#39;m going to go with Dr BBL, my consult was in April 2021, and they scheduled me for Februrary 2022. Depending on your hair removal and letter progress, you could get in sooner if they get you off the waitlist. For example, they cleared me for surgery in November. Hopefully, I get off the waitlist. For another reference, Dr. Avanessian saw me at the same time, but offered November 2021 for a surgery date.

Feb 2022?!  My date is February 10th! (Finances are the only reason it wasn&#39;t in Oct this year).

Hopefully you can get in sooner, but if not I&#39;ll be there at that time üòÑ

So my consult was in February of 2021, and because I had all of my letters and hair removal and stuff all ready for surgery, I was offered a cancellation date for May of 2021! Very short notice and insanely lucky, and I‚Äôm so grateful! But I believe they‚Äôre currently booking out into like fall of 2022/early 2023. So start that hair removal now!!

Congrats!!! How are you healing so far? Did you have any complications and were they treated? How are you feeling in general at this point? Are you happy with your depth and aesthetics? Happy pride! Wishing you the best with your recovery &lt;3

So healing is going very well! I had some sloughing which is to be expected, it‚Äôs more so just ugly to look at, but that‚Äôs improved a lot already, and they provide aquacel, which is like a sheet of super absorbent cottony kind of gauze that you apply to it and it helps the healing process. Other than that, no complications or complaints. I‚Äôm feeling soooo amazing. The first week was the hardest, and every week since has gotten MUCH easier. Even with the swelling and healing and stuff, I feel so much more comfortable in my body, and I just feel correct. It‚Äôs a really beautiful feeling and I‚Äôm so happy with my choice to go with Dr. BB-L and Dr. Zhao! My depth is really great. About 8+ inches, which is def above average. I can get to the thumb notch on my dilator when dilating. Aesthetics are really good, considering how early in recovery I am. Obviously there‚Äôs still a lot of swelling and healing going on, but it is already INSANELY improved from just a couple weeks ago. But it‚Äôs symmetrical, today, and cute! Which is what I wanted. The only thing is that the skin is a bit wrinkly which I think is from the swelling going down and the skin just has to tighten back up. But if anyone reading this has any tips for that, let me know! Thank you! Im very happy with my decision and I would 10000000% recommend Dr. Bluebond and her team for SRS. She‚Äôs amazing. And Dr. Zhao is really kind and talented as well

Amazing! I already booked my surgery with another surgeon but when I‚Äôve seen dr. BBL results I was stunned and almost reconsidered it. If it wasn‚Äôt for the long waitlist I would have loved to go with her. Really happy for you though!

I too had surgery with Dr. RBL and Dr. Zhao, the day after my bday, on June 17th. I am also getting the dilator to the notch as well (~8 inches depth - which was a shock given the material she had to work with), and I am also experiencing the same issue at my suture line as you. Like you said, gas pain was the absolute worst because they pump air in you for the laparoscopic robot. It was unbearable the first night,  but peppermint tea helped me the most.
</p>
<p>
I was wondering if you could DM me just so I can chat with you about the &#34;sloughing&#34; as I&#39;m curious to know if it&#39;s what I&#39;m dealing with at my surgical site as well,  as well as questions on the labia minora. They all seem to say my results are great, but if course I&#39;m very OCD and a perfectionist. I&#39;m at my 30d mark today.

Happy Pride to you! Did your insurance cover it? I feel like I got some assurance from their office that everything was going to be fine with insurance, but I really feel antsy about it. Like, is it really going to be as easy as all that or what?

Personally, my insurance did cover it. It‚Äôs definitely one of the more stressful things about preparing for surgery. But once they approve it, it‚Äôs great! Good luck to you!!

Now that you&#39;re one month post-op, how mobile are you? I assume you&#39;re still &#34;in recovery,&#34; but are you comfortable going on walks and the like, or are you mostly hanging out at home?

Congrats! I have my consult with her next month. Is there anything you wish you would have known -- about SRS generally or specifically with RBL -- prior to surgery? Really heartening to hear your experience with hair removal. I&#39;m really worried about electrolysis, but have had five sessions of laser already and am seeing good results that way.

Hmmmm just that the gas pain really is a bitch. For me, it lasted the whole time I was in the hospital. Just really be mentally prepared. It‚Äôs gonna be probably one of the hardest things you‚Äôll ever go through. It‚Äôs not something to take lightly. Be excited, but don‚Äôt be so excited that you go in unprepared. But it is worth it, I can tell you that

Thanks! Could you tell me a bit more about your experience with gas and anything that helped? Also, if you aren&#39;t from the area, how did you comply with the three week requirement to stay in the area (e.g., stay in a hotel, rent an apartment, etc.)?

So really all you can do is move, and wait it out. I took walks as soon as a could and it helped a bit but really you just kind of have to suffer through it. It also made me extremely nauseous so for 3 days all I could eat were saltines and ginger ale. It was really bad, but the more you move, and the more you wait it out, the better it gets. And I‚Äôm from out of state so my mom and I stayed in a hotel nearby. It was the best western plus hospitality house on 49th

Ooooooh exciting!! Start that hair removal now! Get all of your things in order ASAP and you might get an earlier date for surgery if you‚Äôre lucky! Good luck!

I had robot assisted Standard PI with peritoneal graft. I‚Äôve got amazing depth (8+ inches) and my aesthetics are really good for being so early in recovery. I believe this is the only technique they preform, but I may be mistaken.

Currently I believe they‚Äôre booking out into late 2022/early 2023. But there‚Äôs always cancellations and stuff. I got a surgery date for 3 months after my consult, so you never know

Yes! My vulva is pretty much perfectly symmetrical as far as I can tell lol. RBL is an artist, for sure. Good luck with your surgery!

I am just wondering I live in Australia and don&#39;t know who to see or where to travel to get srs. Any thoughts? Covid might complicate things as well.

Most Australians get SRS in Australia or Thailand. Look in the wiki on this sub.

From my experience, the dysphoria has just increased over the years, and now deeply regret not having the courage to come out and having the surgery to transform from male to female.  Mind dysphoria effects us all in different ways, for me it&#39;s been very very strong. I only recently came out and.told my wife,  which naturally shocked her. She said had she known she would have divorced me years ago, or better still never married, we did marry and the result was 2 beautiful daughters 3 granddaughters a grandson plus 5 great grandchildren phew so there was some compensations , my love üíìand thoughts are with each and every one of you, who suffer from dysphoria
