Hey! I just found out my insurance will pay for my surgery with my chosen surgeon. That being said, I have two of the three necessary letters. I just need a psychiatrist for the final letter. Does anyone know how I can find one? I searched mental health and psychiatry on my insurance and I couldn&#39;t find anyone near me who is a phd. I just need a few sessions to get the diagnosis and letter so I wouldn&#39;t mind going out of pocket too much. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

This is a website that has a list of therapists that offer to do letters for free. I used it to get my second letter.

Psychiatrists are always MDs; PhD/PsyDs are psychologists. Double check with your insurance to see if you need the letter-writer to have a particular qualification.
<del>
Either way, ZocDoc is pretty good â€“ they have a feature that lets you search in-network by insurance plan.
</del>
Edit: Realizing that is not going to be specific enough! :P Contact a local LGBT center or trans clinic for local recommendations. Right now because of the &#39;rona, some states are letting doctors (MDs) with out-of-state licenses practice locally. I know the LA Gender Clinic therapists do informed consent letters.

I just had a PsyD write me the least professional letter I&#39;ve ever seen. Going to an MD for a real letter in addition to the one from my original therapist. YMMV.

Ask your therapist for a recommendation.  Mine recommended someone at the LGBTQ clinic I already went to for my endo (they also have a mental health team, though my therapist doesn&#39;t work there).

I got referrals through my HRT clinic - maybe try calling some of them if your not seeing them, they should have lists of trans friendly/appropriate folks.
