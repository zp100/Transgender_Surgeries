is a link describing my 1st appointment experience‚ù£Ô∏èü§ós
</p>
<p>
Friday, 5/8/2020: This morning I received a surprise call from the Papillon Center in New Hope, telling me they were resuming providing services. I was offered the choice for one of two available appointments next week. I asked what precautions the Center has taken to reduce the possibility of COVID-19 exposure for their patients. I was told the entire interior of the building was sprayed and ‚Äú. . . was probably the cleanest building in Bucks County.‚Äù It was explained the esthetician will be gloved, masked, gowned and wearing a face shield. I previously arranged to have lidocaine injections and I understood they will be administered by Dr. McGinn.
</p>
<p>
Background: I had three 4-hour electrolysis appointments lined up with them beginning early April. When Pennsylvania closed March 19, Papillon Center canceled the April appointment. They subsequently canceled my appointment for May.
</p>
<p>
Instructions: I was told to bring my own mask. Upon arrival I‚Äôm to remain in my vehicle and call the Center to let them know I‚Äôve arrived. They will let me know when I can enter the building. I am the only one allowed to enter. Their waiting room is closed and my wife cannot come inside with me and wait. If there are no appointments following mine, I‚Äôm told the session can be extended to 6-hours.
</p>
<p>
We arranged to stay overnight following the appointment at Dr. McGinn‚Äôs GAIA Guest House, figuring if it is anything like the Center, it is the cleanest place to stay. We celebrate our anniversary next week so this is a small treat to ourselves. I plan to Post to share my experience and let you know how it all goes. Much ‚ù§Ô∏è to you all‚ù£Ô∏è ü§ós

Wow congrats! I have been looking into their services and was wondering how much they charge/if you know of people getting insurance to cover it? Good luck!

The price for the electrolysis service is $95/$130 (wo/w lidocaine anesthetic injections) per hour.

Once Papillon Center worked out the insurance coverage, within about two weeks I had three appointments scheduled. I was told in the phone call on Friday (5/8/20) that right now they are scrambling to reschedule all the canceled March/April appointments.

The Papillon Center does not accept insurance. Strictly pay up front, or at time of service, depending on what you are having done. For a $45 fee, they will work with your insurance to obtain pre- authorization. They then provide you with an insurance compatible receipt for you to pursue reimbursement from you insurance company.
