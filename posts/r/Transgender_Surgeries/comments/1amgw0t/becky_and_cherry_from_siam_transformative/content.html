*Trigger Warning: Racism, Transphobia, Body Shaming and Theft.
</p>
<p>
Theerapong girl here, 2.5 years post-op after having the open sigmoid-colon technique, please see my review and pictures posted some time ago. Whilst some girls may have had positive experiences under Becky and Cherry&#39;s care, I am alarmed and gravely concerned that they are both still working with us, trans and intersex women, a misunderstood and vulnerable community.
</p>
<p>
The start of my experience was pleasant, however, I noticed red flags early on in my five-week stay and recovery in Bangkok. Becky’s ignorance towards women of trans-experience is antiquated and damaging. For instance, when I was undergoing my pre-operative psychological evaluation, the psychiatrist enquired about my intimate life and Becky retorted, &#34;She has sex like a lady-boy.&#34; Yes, I am aware these terms are culturally relative, however, for Becky, a American from Texas, it&#39;s embarrassing that she would use this word, a slur in the Western world and a potential gender-dysphoria trigger.
</p>
<p>
Several girls have discovered that Becky, the driver and interpreter for Siam Transformative, would grossly inflate surgeries, pocketing this for herself without the Interplast Clinic&#39;s or Dr. Theerapong’s knowledge. She and Cherry also house clients in Nawamin which, one day, took over 2 hours just to go one way to the clinic (downtown Bangkok) for a follow up appointment with Dr. Theerapong. They do this because “Cherry” (nurse) lives there and it’s convenient for her to visit clients close to her home, completely disregarding the safety implications of being so far away from your surgeon and also sitting in a car for 4+ hours in one day after having surgery just to see your surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I originally planned to do the Sigmoid-Colon Laparoscopic Technique (580,000 Thai baht) but Dr Theerapong suggested the Sigmoid-Colon Open Technique (380,000 Thai baht) due to greater benefits. I had already paid for the Sigmoid-Colon Laparoscopic Technique and given that the Sigmoid-Colon Open Technique was lower in cost, meaning $6,000 was owed to me. Becky remained quiet about money owed to me, hoping I would remain silent, compliant and overwhelmed by everything that happened. It was only once I asserted myself twice and then returned to the West did Becky returned my money.
</p>
<p>
Becky&#39;s transphobia and views on trans people were evident from the outset, I recall both her and “Cherry” (nurse) remarking I was the &#39;prettiest one they&#39;ve had..so far,&#39; out of their clients, objectifying me like I was a Pokemon. The comparisons did not cease there, both Becky and Cherry felt comfortable telling me how previous clients behaved and reduced their womanhood to nothingness, pointing out their masculine features, stating &#39;a lot of them&#39; smelled and acted like &#39;sloppy,&#39; men and &#39;they will never be women&#39; despite all the surgeries. Perhaps Becky felt comfortable around me enough to reveal herself as a bigot, on one occasion, a Filipina trans woman, residing in Norway was due to have surgery after mine, this client was early in transition and both Becky and Cherry had no reservations in joking she looked like a man! They later made fun of her “man underwear” having holes in it and decided to gift her women’s panties so she could “act like a lady for once”. They had nicknames for all her clients and I later recall how degrading she was about a vulnerable, young client from Cyprus, whom she regarded as a nuisance. I learned later that this woman was struggling with anxiety after surgery.
</p>
<p>
I am pretty thick-skinned, however, I became privy to Becky thinking it was amusing that I felt dysphoric about showing Dr Theerapong or her, my previous genitalia during our consultation and proceeded to gossip about this. I became aware of Becky informing Cherry and other staff about my &#39;massive&#39; pre-op genitalia, again objectifying me. It was after this consultation and reluctantly showing the doctor my genitalia, that Becky&#39;s manner changed towards me and on a few occasions she misgendered me, correcting herself, thinking I did not hear. Passing is a relative and sensitive topic in the trans/intersex fem community, however, my ability to pass whether in rough parts of London or my father&#39;s native Spanish Harlem, New York has never been up for question, I have been able to navigate the cis-gendered world as an attractive and cultured, female in a long-term heterosexual relationship. I can only assume Becky&#39;s behaviour towards me changed after seeing my pre-op genitalia and her bigotry increased.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m unsure if Becky&#39;s Texan background influenced how she engages with people of colour, particularly those of African descent! On discovering my partner was black, Becky&#39;s staff informed me both she and Cherry made jokes insinuating my partner was my pimp and referring to me as a N
<strong>
<em>
er lover. Unfortunately, Cherry also outed this worker’s HIV status to me as well. I can’t even begin to unpack this until this day. As an ambiguous-looking, mixed-race woman post-George Floyd, being called a N
</em>
</strong>
er lover was disappointing and exhausting, Cherry expressed disgust at the texture of my long, thick hair, something I inherited from my Afro-Cuban father. My hair and Latin features aside, Cherry could also not make sense of how fair/&#39;white&#39; my skin was, speculating if I &#39;bleached&#39; my skin, a phenomenon in her native, complexion-obsessed Philippines. Other clients have since expressed concerns about Cherry and her projection that she is being mistreated or patronised on the premise of her being Filipina, again, as another woman of colour, this is untrue.
</p>
<p>
My resilience allowed me to recover and complete my stay in Bangkok, however, upon my return and having complications, Becky, in true form, did not disappoint! I recall messaging her team, telling her I was experiencing loss of blood, Becky responded sarcastically, snarking, I was “having my first period”, completely dismissing my medical crisis and fragile emotional state. It was after this interaction, that I ensured it would be our last. In closing, Becky and Cherry are not safe people for anyone to be around, let alone trans people.
</p>
<p>
I want to reiterate that, while some people may have had positive experiences with Becky and Cherry (interpreter/driver and nurse) from previous company Siam Transformative (now guised as “Siam Transformation”?), please don’t invalidate those who had negative experiences in the hands of Becky and Cherry.

I Myself had the same BS from these 2 useless scammers Sigmoid Open also - Becky is a Narcissistic Oportunist - my experience was &#34;Sick&#34; also from the lying Snarky one - BY the way &#34;Transformation &#34; is not a Registered Permit Company in Thailand - this allows hidding money from Thailands &#34;King&#34; and the US Tax Man systems on purpose and also being a none Thai citizen despite being married to one - She&#39;s still  cheating as an Ex Patriot from Texas against Transwomen as of my post - dirty as hell this one !!!!
</p>
<p>
I started a site to make my point on Google called (
<a href="https://www.siamtransformation.com/">https://www.siamtransformation.com/
</a>
) Slowly I&#39;ll fill it with legit information ! IT WILL NEVER BE REMOVED AS LONG AS BECKY LIVES !

Aside from being a hard-core bigot from Texas &#34;Becky &#34; being a lying, aggressive Narcissist, has maneuvered her way of being able to speak Thai fluently, convincing &#34;Interplast&#34; FB to put her Cell # as a contact with them at their clinic - a disaster she&#39;s allowed to create being part of DR. Theerapong and his skills - she&#39;s a weasel - just a Leprechaun hoarding her scammed gold from patients !!

Thank you for posting this compilation of information. All of this is incredibly disturbing. The part where Becky is pretending to be a trans woman looking for surgery and in the next post is announcing she&#39;s working for Theerapong, and in the next post she&#39;s bashing you as herself??? What on earth?????? I had been warned before by other girls before about the stealing but this well exceeds my worst nightmare. I hope Dr. Theerapong is realizes this. He seems like a really good person. I&#39;m trying to give benefit of the doubt that he was unaware of how toxic these two are. Thank you for taking the time to spread awareness and protecting us from these dreadful women. Really, your efforts are appreciated.

I posted about my experience months ago with these two theives. This is why Siam Transformative dissolved in the first place. Greedy bigots, marking up surgeries and pocketing off the top, def not an ally to the trans/non-binary community. Making jokes about other patients in front of me. Misgendering me and &#34;it&#39;s okay because you&#39;re used to it&#34;. I would be very cautious moving forward with anyone who continues to use the brand or any version of the brand Siam Transformative/Transformation, etc. They don&#39;t have a registered company. This is all public knowledge on Thailand&#39;s business registration sites. I was never reimbursed the money they owe me. Disgruntled ex workers of Siam (Becky and Cherry) are all over Reddit attacking their own previous patients with genuine concerns. Why did I not see the &#34;wound care nurse&#34; once? I had massive incisions. Ex patriot Becky from Texas is apparently a respiratory therapist in geriatric setting, not a qualified wound care nurse and not a nurse at all. I&#39;m happy to hear some people are having positive experiences with these scam artists but it&#39;s likely because they would isolate themselves if they continued to behave like the bigots they are. I had a horrible, lonely experience in &#34;Bangkok&#34; (really 2 hours outside of Bangkok/the clinic, where they keep their patients out of convenience). If I wasn&#39;t going to see the nurse at all, I would have rather stayed in the city where there is civilization. Please don&#39;t invalidate negative experiences of surgery patients under their care. Every story is valid.

I must say everyone in Thailand should be truly grateful for this post in fair details #socialjustice #transcare where so many Asian countries lack care policies and transparent reporting, and corruption (here abetted by foreign expats)
</p>
<p>
Having left Asia for good...gratefully dead I hope to those old school countries, I seriously can&#39;t imagine why Transformative Siam clinic or after care would have Becky the Texan on transcare... don&#39;t get me wrong, I do have Texas friends but selectively....if the position was open to international applicants it makes sense to select from States like Oregon, California, western shores. Here&#39;s a link
<a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps" rel="nofollow">https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps
</a>
that highlights more Trans friendly locations. Curious where weirdo &#34;Cherry&#34; is from...

Oh yeah if it&#39;s your first visit to Southeast Asia it might be surprising, the N word being a slur isn&#39;t public knowledge in the area. There&#39;s pretty much no black people in the region but people still listen to US music so they know the word but not the cultural history of it.
</p>
<p>
Racism in general is also very culturally ingrained and not really seen as a big taboo like in North America.

You have a valid point, however, the person saying the slur is an American from Texas so that changes the context a bit. An American calling a woman a N*** lover is cringe.

Hi AliceInAcidland (love the name btw!),
</p>
<p>
You may have misunderstood my post! It was not a South East Asian who was racist but Becky, the lady whom used the N slur grew up in the segregated/Jim Crow South, so she clearly has residual feelings from that era!
</p>
<p>
I’m also aware of the nuances in Asia regarding race, my dad was a marine engineer in the US Navy, so I’ve been worldly from a young age.
</p>
<p>
Have a wonderful day.

Darling,
</p>
<p>
If you notice, I recommended their interpretation skills on premise of the language barrier. Nowhere else in my post (nearly 2 years ago) did I mention or recommend anything else, aftercare, sensitivity towards vulnerable patients  🥴 Please read my post again.
</p>
<p>
So many ladies have come forth with the same concerns and I want to share my feelings. If it helps other ladies make the right choice, I’m happy.
</p>
<p>
Kudos to you though dear 👍🏻 when a vulnerable minority come forth sharing shocking experiences, now really isn’t the time to try and wax your debating skills.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy your day 🌞

I doubt the validity of your post due to not only my own experience with Becky and Cherry but that of my other two friends who used their services. Their care team use to include Saphira but she wanted a bigger cut of Cherries pay.  This didn’t sit well with Becky and Cherry since Cherry was doing all the after care work and Saphira was only doing part time office work.  Saphira then went and locked them out of the website and took the client list. Since then Saphira has been throwing all sorts of accusations around on Reddit.  The age and posting history of your account makes me suspicious that this is more of that.  I am truly sorry if that was your honest experience and I’m incorrect.

Thank you for expressing any doubts you have, whilst simultaneously attempting to victim shame me. As I told you earlier, this isn’t an opportunity for you to wax your debating skills girl; the community in all its varying degrees and expressions have come forward and echoed my sentiments.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Your experiences as a recent and late transitioned person (as your pictures show) would of course differ to mine due to my own early experiences as a young, trans Latina female from the hood; so of course my perspective and surgical journey differs to yours girl. Now in my early 30’s I’ve lived this life for nearly 20 years and when a trans healthcare provider is off/shady, I will speak out on this. Your opinions are welcome; however, discounting and minimising mine do not change the truth. To reiterate, the experiences of older, white people who lived as cis males deep into their mid 30s in relative privilege usually mean they go into these situations naive and with rose tinted glasses, I’ve had several late transitioners of the demographic I’ve just described, tell me they sought gender-affirming care, only to get a rude awakening! I’ve seen it all and this experience was horrific.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I’m unaware of whatever’s happened with Saphira or their politics, I’m nobody’s pawn, especially for cis people that provide gender-affirming care for trans people. I’m assuming Becky has reached out to you and wanted you to do ‘damage limitation,’ playing the martyr, please refrain. The Filipina patient they had who was doing sales for her, was the same patient they were misgendering to her FACE. Also laughing and calling her a man. Do not think you’re exempt from their abuse.
<br>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The age and post history of my account? Again, please don’t try to gaslight me; I had my surgery on 19th November 2021 and made my first post-op review in august 2022.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Anything else whilst you’re still here?

Girl, who said you looked like a dude? Steven Tyler actually identifies as gender non-confirming and uses She/her They/Them He/Him pronouns fluidly - Google her, her pictures, Steven Tyler is Non-Binary! Here you go again, undermining someone’s lived experience - please stop already.
</p>
<p>
Of course you wouldn’t regard me as a class act? I’m sure Miss Becky, portrayed me as the ‘Puerto Rican whose mobster boyfriend in jail paid for her pussy’ as she told other people.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy your weekend mami ❤️😊

Comparing someone&#39;s looks to someone else&#39;s on a post about comments causing dysphoria is kinda crappy hypocrisy.

Hi Koukla Mou,
</p>
<p>
I’m so sorry this was your experience. There’s an old saying, if you catch a quick glimpse of someone’s eyes for the first few seconds of meeting them, you’ll see their true intentions before their mask goes right up. That saying rings true for Miss Becky Pickles, I saw right through her the first night; conniving, slippery and sly. She assumed we’d all be so doped up, scared, vulnerable and unsure that we wouldn’t notice her relieving us of our money.
</p>
<p>
It was so strange, she’d slander you being a diva, dreading you coming with your mom and how sensitive you would probably be.
</p>
<p>
Karma will surely deliver.

Sounds like a plan, hey, if you like it, I love it 🤭
</p>
<p>
Girl, before you do ‘go about your day’ telling people a ‘nice’ lady said you look like Steven Tyler, I’d suggest you crawl back to Miss Messy Becky Pickles with your tail between your legs and tell her your vapid, middle-class attempt at trying to discredit &amp; victim shame my experience failed 😊
</p>
<p>
As aforementioned, stop being used as a pawn, it’s pitiful, what did she do to inveigle you as a flying monkey girl? Gift you hemp material covid masks or other knitwear she does 🤣
</p>
<p>
Finally tell mami I want my 2.5k back she stole, as do the other ladies she swindled. Though I really couldn’t care about the money anymore - Interplast are very aware, as are the community.
</p>
<p>
No Justice, No Peace!

I&#39;m planning on having a peritoneal pull-through vaginoplasty with Dr Theerapong in future. Are or were Becky and Cherry employees of Dr Theerapong? I&#39;m unclear on what their connection is to Dr Theerapong. Is Siam transformative separate from Interplast Clinic? Which I think is the current clinic Dr Theerapong works for.

I have a question though you were Siams T. very first client how could you possibly know stuff about me and the other girl from Norway?  How would you know that they had nicknames for all their clients when you were the first one. Just curious about that because it doesn&#39;t add up.

Very valid question and here’s my response;
</p>
<p>
You were both in contact with Becky and co when I was out there.
</p>
<p>
Again, breaking your confidentiality, she’d show me pictures of you both and already had cast judgment. The Filipino, they’d blatantly misgender to my face and discuss how they’d struggled to gender her correctly due to her appearance. Yourself, Becky was dreading you coming out due to you ‘asking too many questions’ and giving off a very ‘anxious, nervy’ disposition. She was also against your mother travelling with you that coming March.
</p>
<p>
When BOTH of you arrived and we were still in contact due to me waiting on my money, they gave insight into both of you, which again was inappropriate and several times I’d change the topic. I’m assuming they saw me as someone to vent to and I’m surprised she didn’t vent to you about me.
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer anything else you want to know 🙂❤️

Thanks for responding and not taking personally the question above. I really hope they get what they deserve for exploiting women like us and thank you for taking the time to make everyone aware about those 2. ❤️🙏
