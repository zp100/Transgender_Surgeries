Hi folks,
</p>
<p>
A while ago I was reporting a story for CNN on Dr Thep Vechavisit in Bangkok and what patients were getting with cheap surgery. The article is now published:
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/asequals/cheap-gender-affirmation-surgery-thailand-as-equals-intl-cmd/">https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/asequals/cheap-gender-affirmation-surgery-thailand-as-equals-intl-cmd/</a>
and there is a corresponding video here:
<a href="https://youtu.be/O8cI8ysUFFU?si=xYAMz6BF1p1dyX3T">https://youtu.be/O8cI8ysUFFU?si=xYAMz6BF1p1dyX3T</a>
</p>
<p>
CNN&#39;s editorial process was vigorous. There were things I had seen or heard that couldn&#39;t be published because I could find no hard proof, or what I had didn&#39;t meet their fact-checking standards. I also have photos from inside the clinic they didn&#39;t publish which are on my personal website if anyone is interested. These were taken with patients&#39; written consent.

<p>
The majority of patients I spoke to who were in the waiting room waiting for their operation didn&#39;t realise the
<strong>
surgery was done completely under local anaesthesia, although patients are given a sedative.
</strong>
This is a big reason why the surgery is so cheap. I think this is an important thing to know and consider ahead of time, if you&#39;re deciding whether Dr Thep could be the right surgeon for you. I hope this is helpful to someone.

Local anaesthetic only that is so wild. Those women are incredible.

Dr Thep is in the wiki and is notable for costing just over USD $2k for SRS. Very few western women go to him so it’s difficult to find out much about him.

Thanks. That is a wonderful positive story. I think it’s very fair about potential complications and it sounds like Dr. Threp is very good at what he does, given what he has to work with.
