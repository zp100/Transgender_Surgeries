What are your impressions of her/the clinic? I have a consult for FFS with Mundinger at The Crane Center Austin this August. Looks great!

Everyone from her staff was amazing
<strong>
af
</strong>
. I
<strong>
did
</strong>
have a problem with the packing and had to make an emergency appointment that they happily made for me. Turns out I was just super anxious/stressed and everything was fine.

The Crane Center was amazing!  The insurance verification process was brutal and annoying... I had to call and email them like 5 times to make sure my insurance went through. Seems to be the norm tho.

Iâ€™m super nervous about insurance verifications/appeals etc. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re doing well now! Another question, what do you have to pack when itâ€™s a zero depth. Iâ€™m also consulting with them for an orchi but may decide to fully transition at a later time. Zero depth sounds nice since Iâ€™m not attracted to males and wonâ€™t have much use for it. Plus, I donâ€™t want to have to constantly dilate for the rest of my life.

Oh gosh I went through the same insurance issues. Was able to get it sorted out and have surgery scheduled for this fall with her!!! Did you get your surgery done at the hospital next to 360 &amp; 2244, or at the Arise medical center to the east on 2244?

I had surgery right next to The Crane Center, on Bee Caves. Westlake Hospital. Grats on getting a surgery date!! That&#39;s exciting!! Dr. DeLeon was incredibly friendly and wonderful in person, too! Everyone at the Crane center was affirming and friendly and great! I don&#39;t know your sexual orientation, but the girl who works the front desk with tattoos is

My surgery date is in April of next year with Dr DeLeon. On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with the results? IE how does it feel and look to you? I understand if you donâ€™t want to answer, just havenâ€™t found a ton of her old patients to ask. Thank you in advance

I&#39;m happy to share pictures if you&#39;d like? I only deleted this post because I kept getting gross DMs from guys creeping my profile after I shared my results here.

I completely understand!! If you would like to share, that would be great, but again only if you feel comfortable with it. One other thing I was going to ask and forgot, where did you stay after you were discharged from the hospital. I know Dr DeLeon wants to see you every week for 3 weeks after discharge, so I was think an AirBnb or something like that, because the cost of a hotel would be through the roof for that amount of time. Again, thank you so much for getting back to me.

I stayed in an Airbnb for 10 days when I flew to Austin. I found one near the hospital. I informed Dr. DeLeon and her office that I was coming from out of state. She said that I only needed to stay in town for my first week. I had to be
<strong>
in person
</strong>
for the 1 week follow-up appt. She conducted my 2 week appt and my 3 week appt over the phone. She had me send several pics to her office and then she reviewed them and called me at a scheduled time to discuss them. That&#39;s how I did all my follow up appts. She was super cool about it! She&#39;s honestly awesome and her bedside is great! I did end up dropping $900 on that 10 day Airbnb, fyi. I also just Ubered to and from the Airbnb and the hospital. I tried Ubers&#39; promo where you get 1 week free of reduced fees and I cancelled it on the last day from the app, so I got all my Uber rides reduced in price while I was there!

Thank you so much for the info. Iâ€™m going to have to call and see if I could do the same thing. I was literally looking at almost a extra $3500 for housing while there. Really donâ€™t want to be away from home that long. Ten days would be awesome, and a lot less expensive!! I canâ€™t wait! April canâ€™t come soon enough.

I was drunk when I answered this. Dr. Santucci is actually the
