I don’t regret my decision but just wanted to share my personal experience. Personally for me it has been incredibly painful. I can’t stand for a long period of time. I can’t sit normal. The only time I am at easy is when I’m lying in bed.  Not only the vagina but my butt also hurts I don’t know why? I just wanted to be honest and be transparent about how severe and extreme this surgery and it’s recovery can be. Nonetheless it’s a painful blessing. Staying at home for 2 months and not being able to do much is going to be extremely boring. My friends who had srs told me it took 3 to 4 months for the pain to subside. I can’t wait to get back to my old self. Again I have no regrets but I feel there should be more honesty and transparency in the community. I personally felt that within a few weeks I’ll be fine. Anyway it’s just about patience and time now. Transition has taught me patience and I just hope I am able to make it through

I’m sorry you’re going through it still, it’s great after it subsides. It takes time but you’ll forget most of it.
</p>
<p>
I agree the pain is often way understated… there were points where I felt like I had lost my mind due to how much pain I felt. My vision and hearing went away in those moments, it was crazy. Just. Pain. So bad I couldn’t even register the concept of pain. 100%.

not denying your experience at all, but mine was much better. within 2 weeks post op, i was walking over a mile each day. and no issues with pain, really.
</p>
<p>
the point is, you (generic you) need to prepare to prepare for not being able to take care of yourself for a while, because that is the worst case, but also, it may be significantly better.
</p>
<p>
also, side note: a donut pillow, if you haven&#39;t tried one, might make sitting easier.

after getting discharged form the hospital, and doing dilation in the recovery hotel, i did have one night where my new vag started bleeding after dilation. it didn&#39;t hurt, so much, but i was terrified and crying, thinking i had broken my new vag, and it was all done.
</p>
<p>
my fiancee who was with me, called the nurse support line, and she was able to follow their directions to apply pressure and stop it, but i was still crying and terrified, and ended up crying myself to sleep in her arms.  that was a scary night!
</p>
<p>
happened again two nights later, but it wasn&#39;t so bad, and we just dealt with it.

i was at the Suporn clinic. you stay in the hospital for 7 days post op. on the morning of the sixth day, the Doc takes the packing out and that night he does the first dilation for you, static dilation.
</p>
<p>
that may definitely account for the differences.

yeah, that would definitely be more healed by the time you start dilating.

a lot of girls talk about the post-op bleeding as like experiencing their first &#34;period&#34; but imo it&#39;s actually more akin to having a baby. although obviously not the same thing, a lot of my post-op recovery tips and things to expect i actually learned from postpartum folks. peri bottles, aloe padsicles, the unyielding perineum pain, what undies to wear, discharge, that first poop
</p>
<p>
and yeah me too. i wish it was more clear about the pain. not to scare or dissuade but to say this is a major major surgery. you won&#39;t feel like yourself in the first month. maybe not even the first 3 months
</p>
<p>
and yes the bootyhole spasms n pain. i&#39;ll just be laying down enjoying my netflix then out of nowhere the shooting booty pains 😭

I guess it depends on the person and the pain management they get. For me pain was barely there during the first few days . What was annoying is the nerve zaps when the nerves try to reconnect with eachother but that is like lasting 30 seconds tops if it happens and as you move through the recovery it gets easier and happens less frequently.
</p>
<p>
I hope they didn&#39;t make you go off hormones i see girls having a slower healing time when they go off estrogen.

My advise for anyone going for GRS is to prepare mentally, physically, at home and at work for the absolute worst and thank your lucky stars if you get an easy ride! Preparing physically such that you are best possible condition going into surgery increases the likelyhood of an easy ride. It&#39;s also worth noting that getting GRS can only ease dysphoria, it can be a rough ride mentally and aside from (obviously) dysphoria your mental state will need to be good to cope with it. Also get some support ideally someone who has been through the surgery themselves - online is fine.

My core muscles were “the largest and most dense I have ever operated on…” the surgeon said. She had to cut a path through them to give me any kind of depth as all. Needless to say the recovery of cutting and reshaping muscle is intensely painful. On the up side, I can shoot an dilator 5’+ through the air with just squeezing my vagina after dilating! Everyone’s insides will be different and that difference is the main factor for pain and length of time for recovery. Healing muscles can spasm… I have experienced a lot of that and it’s painful. Sometime it even bruises afterwards. So hang in there and take it easy. Everything will heal in time :)

IT was painful in the beginning, and I didn&#39;t tolerate the morphine so good (I was nauseous and vomited). Even with Tramadol, it was painful. Took the flight home around 5 weeks postop, and it hurted like hell. (I booked business class so that I can sleep during the flight).
</p>
<p>
It was less painful at week 8, then at week 10, I managed to be at the office all day without so much trouble (Thanks to the pillow and the position that I found).
</p>
<p>
The difference between week 8 and week 12 was enormous. It was like day and night.
</p>
<p>
I tried sex at week 14, and it was kinda uncomfortable. Tried it a month later, and it was much more pleasurable.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t regret taking the surgery. Just be prepared for the pain adn the postop depression
