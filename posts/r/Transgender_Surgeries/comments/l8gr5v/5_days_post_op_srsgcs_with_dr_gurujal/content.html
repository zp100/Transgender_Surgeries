When you get all of that out of you, you should feel a ton better because it&#39;s gone. That&#39;s not to say it&#39;ll be a cakewalk afterward yet, but just having all the packing out and no longer having to haul around bags of liquid with you/hanging off of you, will ease up a lot of the restrictions you have on your movement, and that will be a major step at which recovery feels like you are actually recovering. That stuffed feeling that you currently have will not be there anymore.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, it also marks the point in your recovery when you will start to take a more active role with your recovery. You will be shown how to dilate and it will be up to you to keep that up on a schedule. Without the catheter you will need to start using the bathroom to relieve yourself of urine again, which means you will have to relearn how to pee and clean up afterward. You won&#39;t have padding pulling on you with every movement, with a tradeoff of not having the protection from the bolster pad covering the whole area, so you will have to be careful when moving around so as not to pop any stitches. You&#39;ll start using maxi pads in order to avoid the mess from discharge getting into everything. You will resume showering (honestly I felt showers to be the best part of recovery) and also start douching as instructed to clean out inside of you. You will need to apply ointments and do post-op care on your incisions as they continue to heal, following your surgeon&#39;s instructions.
</p>
<p>
That all may sound scary, but it&#39;s really not so bad, it&#39;ll just be hard at first because it takes effort to do it all, but it&#39;ll get easier as you recover and build up a routine and ways to make things easier, like keeping a stock of cotton swabs next to the ointment, having a couple packs of baby wipes near the bed and in the bathroom, keeping pads and clean extra underwear in all bathrooms and by the bed and in your purse, etc.

Congratulations! I had GCS with Dr. Grujal in October. He is the absolute best. Are you going to get hyperbaric treatment in Daily City?
</p>
<p>
You will definitely feel better when the stuff is removed and you can get a good look at it. I actually started crying.
</p>
<p>
Edit to add more detail.

I actually love how sweet and patient he’s been with me. I had good vibes from day one, and feel like he’s already done a great job, even without seeing it. The nurses at Post Street Surgical were really great with me too.
</p>
<p>
He suggested it, and my insurance covers it. I want to but the thought of even leaving my hotel and being in an Uber is nauseating. So possibly after my first post op appointment? Did you? If so do you recommend?

Yes, I went and I definitely recommend it. I did 30 treatments and I believe it really helped me heal faster. The staff at 8th Element (the hyperbaric treatment center) is fantastic. I&#39;m having FFS with Dr. Grujal in March and plan to go to 8th Element again.

Thank you again for the love. I don’t even remember posting these when I did. I was on some drugs hehe. I haven’t met many people on here who have gone to him, but I absolutely love my results. I’m still very swollen about 7 weeks out now.
</p>
<p>
I might get ffs with him too. Hope you’re doing well and to here from ya again.
