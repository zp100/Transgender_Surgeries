I&#39;m 7 weeks out as of yesterday:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Sensation. No numb spots, I had my first orgasm two days ago and my second yesterday.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lubrication. It&#39;s definitely wet in there, and a little slippery around my labia minora, but I would not dilate without lube and I haven&#39;t noticed much if any increase when I&#39;m turned on. I don&#39;t leak.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Aesthetics. I like how I look! As for how cis, well, AFAB people with vags have a really wide variety of vulvas. Have a look at my photos and tell me what you think :)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Technique. She uses penile tissue and scrotal tissue to construct most of the canal, and then uses a robot to create cone essentially of peritoneal tissue, the thin but mucosal tissue that some surgeons construct the entire canal out of. This cone is sutured to the penile-scrotal canal, so you have penile at the entrance, scrotal in the middle, peritoneal at the end.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Depth. I&#39;m probably about 7/7.5 inches - I can see the thumb divot on the orange, but it&#39;s definitely right at the entrance.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As for good questions, I recommend asking about what care you need, what hair removal she wants, and if you can give her an idea of your desired aesthetics. Tell her what&#39;s important to you.

Thanks so much for this information ! It’s been very insightful and honest :) tyyy !
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Congrats! You are looking nice :) does she have a standard look ? Is it close to Thai doctor results ? So hard to find online
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Number 4 ... what’s the purpose of the peritoneal just at the end ?

Thanks! It&#39;s patient dependent, but her results are consistently good aesthetically as far as I can tell.
</p>
<p>
So peritoneal tissue is thin, and it isn&#39;t enervated in the same way as penile or scrotal tissue. This is a hybrid method to give you additional depth, and some lubrication, while keeping the sensation you get with penile/scrotal vaginoplasty.
