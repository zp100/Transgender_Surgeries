Hello all!
</p>
<p>
This is my review for Dr Chettawut for FFS for anyone thinking of getting FFS from him.
</p>
<p>
So  I planned everything with work during the month of December to have 3  weeks off for surgery in the coming of January and thankfully they have  allowed me to. My First contact with Dr Chettawuts financial manager (Ms  Som) was back in 2014 when I traveled to Bangkok for SRS with Dr  Chettawut as I&#39;ve had friends from different parts of the world whom did  their SRS with Dr Chettawut which was a success, no complications. My  SRS experience with Dr Chettawut:
<a href="https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php/topic,177094.msg1595892.html#msg1595892">https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php/topic,177094.msg1595892.html#msg1595892</a>
</p>
<p>
And  so after 4 years have gone by, I decided to contact Ms Som once again  but this time for FFS. She had requested left, right, and front angles  of my face so that she would be able to show Dr Chettawut on what facial  surgeries is recommended for best FFS results. As 3 days passed, I  finally got an email from Ms Som with Dr Chettawuts recommendation which  were:
</p>
<p>
1.      Forehead/ Brow Ridge Contouring + upper forehead augmentation2.      Jaw and Chin contouring3.      Upper eyelid surgery4.      Buccal fat pad removal5.      Liposuction under the chin &amp; neck area
</p>
<p>
Of  course, i was hesitant since at that time I havent saved up enough so I  informed Ms Som that i would need one year to save up financially for  the total amount I would have to pay for which I did. Once October came  around I once again contacted Ms Som through email and informed her that  i was ready to pay full price and wire transfer the money to Dr  Chettawut. First few things that were required were blood test and chest  and skull x-rays which were needed just to make sure I was healthy  enough to endure medications and make sure I was not ill or had any HIV  or diseases. Once all documentations were sent over, my date was  confirmed for January 5th, 2019 as my day of surgery. I was also told  not to take hormones 2 weeks before surgery and stop taking any kind of  blood thinning medications 1 month before surgery and to stop smoking 2  months before surgery which doesnt apply to me cause I do not smoke  ever! NOTE: Always follow what instructions are given to you. if you  don&#39;t then it&#39;s the reasons why you would end up with complications or  sometimes die on the operating table. So please it&#39;s important to follow  instructions months before surgery!
</p>
<p>
When December came around,  me and my partner was able to pay for our roundtrip flight to Bangkok  and reserved our Hotel at the Novotel Bangkok Bangna Hotel which was one  of the 3 hotels that is affiliated with Dr Chettawuts clinic. We were  also able to save up enough to buy some gifts for family and friends for  Christmas (Thank Goodness).
</p>
<p>
When
<strong>
January 2nd
</strong>
came around, we finally flew to Bangkok at 11:45am and landed in  Incheon, South Korea airport at 5:45pm January 3rd. Since Bangkok is one  day ahead, we got there at 12:20am on january 4.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
January 4th, 2019 - Consultation - Bangkok, Thailand
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Day  of my Consultation. Woke up and had to go to the lobby at 8:30am and  was picked up by Dr Chettawuts driver. Once we got to Dr Chettawuts  Clinic, Dr Chettawut informed me the procedures and what he will do on  my face to make sure I have the best results for me. Since I also had  SRS in 2014, Dr Chettawut took a few pics of my vagina and breast as I  did both back in 2014 at the same time. He seems so happy with the work  he has done after seeing my vagina and breast. He was like a man who won the lottery as he was proud that what he was seeing was his own  work and was extremely happy, it came out beautiful!
</p>
<p>
After  consultation I was given more documents and omg, I was so excited. In  the instructions for the next day, it said, &#34;You must completely stop  taking water, all kinds of beverages and food at 7:00am&#34;
</p>
<p>
This  made me so ecstatic as I was so hungry and wanted to eat before I went  to surgery. it wasnt like SRS where I had to go on laxatives a day  before surgery. So i went with my partner and we ate all day and went to  visit the mall nearby and of course went to Patpong Night market to buy  fake goods lol.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
January 5th, 2019 - Day of Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This  was the day. I was picked up at my hotel lobby at 10am and was brought  to Dr Chets clinic ready to be knifed in the face. Of course, my partner  was worried but we kissed and said our goodbyes as I informed him that  everything would be well and I would see him again 2 days after surgery  back at the hotel.
</p>
<p>
Once I got to the clinic, Dr Chett drew on my  eyelid as that was the first surgery he did. Was then brought in the  surgery room and laid on the operating bed. They then numbed my eyelids  and didnt put me under anesthesia. Then I had to close my eyes and Dr  Chett did his work while I was awake with my eyes closed throughout the  whole eyelid surgery. I could smell the burning skin and hear the laser  cutting up my eyelids but there was no pain. I was a bit squemish but I  knew that if I did any major movement, it would mess up Dr Chettawut and  I would have messed up my eyelid surgery and looked like a cyclops lol.
</p>
<p>
Once  the procedure was done, i was assisted with the nurses to go back into  the room next door, I was told to open my eyes and they&#39;d help me walk. I  laid on the bed for about 30 minutes and then it was time to go in for  my major Face Surgery. As i was brought to the operating table again,  that is when they have added some padding on my face area and strapped  me down and then administered anesthesia. I was then feeling tingling in  my arms going towards my chest and then the next thing you know,  everything became blurry and I was knocked out cold.
</p>
<p>
I was then  woken up after the surgery and was assisted in the other room where I  slept and took meds and threw up until the next day where I had to walk  with the nurses holding me up to go downstairs into the recovery room  where I slept and did the same, threw up, and take meds. My partner came  to visit me to make sure I didnt die on the operating table and once he  saw I was recovering, he then left where I&#39;d meet him back at the hotel  the next day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
January 7th, 2019 - Back to my hotel
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Once  I got back to my hotel at around 9am, I had a band around my forehead  and a face bandage that wrapped around from my chin to the top of my  head (I was not given the titanium screws and plating to my forehead  surgery since I had a small frontal sinus and instead was given a  synthetic bone substitute (calcium hydroxyapatite) to cover the small  bone defect. There is no titanium sheet applied to the reconstructed  area (C2-Method which is explained on Dr Chettawuts website). Also had  drains connected from under my jaw to my chin. For the whole day, I  rested while my partner slept on the bed next to my bed as he was afraid  he would accidentally hit my face while he slept. I was given vitamin  B12 complex, electrolytes, as well as pain medications and swelling  medications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
January 8th, 2019 - January 12th, 2019 - Recovery Week 1
</strong>
</p>
<p>
During  this time I had alot of swelling and numbness and my lower lip was very  fat and swollen as well as looking like a chipmunk with fat cheeks and  jaws. Everyday the nurses Mrs Sri and Mrs Tair came by and checked on my  wounds and healing progress.On
<strong>
January 8th Tuesday
</strong>
,  nurses came to take out my drains. Had my partner, go buy soft foods  and clear soups and juices and more water to prepare for the week of my  soft food diet.On
<strong>
January 9th Wednesday
</strong>
, nurses came by to take out my stitches on my eyelids.On
<strong>
January 10 Thursday
</strong>
, just full day of rest and was able to eat yogurt, milk, juice, and still clear soup.On
<strong>
January 11th Friday
</strong>
still very swollen and numb but I noticed my lips swelling have been  decreasing slowly, still numb on my chin and i can feel little sensation  on my left side of my lower lip, good sign!On
<strong>
January 12th Saturday
</strong>
,  my partner had to leave early for work or else no one would pay the  bills lol. Said my goodbyes and we FB video chatted and spoke with each  other through FB video and calling everyday until I returned home. My  swelling has gone down a bit more.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
January 13th, 2019 - January 19th, 2019 - Recovery Week 2
</strong>
</p>
<p>
On
<strong>
January 13th Sunday
</strong>
,  my swelling has gone down more. I can finally talk better as my lower  lip is not too fat to restrict me from talking too well. Felt lonely and  was alone since my partner left back home. Tried to make contact with  any girls in any of the three hotels by posting on here and Reddit to see if anyone wanted to meet or hang out.On
<strong>
January 14th Monday
</strong>
Nurses came by to remove my stitches from my head and I was not able to  shower for 3 days so I was told to shower early in the morning before  they removed my stitches. My healing is getting better, still have  chipmunk jaw and cheeks but getting better, I was able to travel to  Patpong market to buy a few fake goods to bring home and was able to eat  soup with rice and fish in it. I was still afraid to eat any solid  foods.On
<strong>
January 15th Tuesday
</strong>
, I went walking near  the pool, heard walking helps with swelling and also get somewhat some  healthy walking to get blood going. Later that day, I got a Grab (also  known as Uber before) and rode to Central Plaza Mall where a supermarket  was also located at the bottom of the mall, bought a few hygiene and  snacks and juices.On
<strong>
January 16th Wednesday
</strong>
, My  lower lip still swollen but it decreased and I can finally almost talk  normally now but not quite there yet. I finally got a message on Reddit  from another girl (Jenny) who had SRS done and was located at the Rama  Hotel where I used to be back in 2014 for SRS also. Agreed to meet up  and also met another girl who had SRS, Laura, I rode Grab to the Rama  Hotel and we hung out until 12 midnight and then I left home. Laura was  leaving the next day and Jenny left on Friday. We had so much to learn  from each other. Same night, I ate some really good room service Green  Thai Style Curry but it was so spicy omg (this is a story for the next  day that caused issues)On
<strong>
January 17th Thursday
</strong>
,  woke up at 4am and my lower right back side was really painful and my  stomach started hurting. Dunno why. I went to use the bathroom and then a  few minutes later, the pain travelled to my lower abdomen, thought it  was my appendix, kidney stones, or something else. Couldnt go back to  sleep so I waited until the Clinic opened at 7am and informed Dr  Chettawuts nurse that I was not feeling too well and if one of the  nurses can come by my hotel. The nurse sent a message to Ms Sri, one of  the nurses who visits all the patients in recovery everyday but the  other nurse informed me to go to the hospital nearby called Sikarin  Hospital. I rode the cab to Sikarin Hospital and once I got there, it  was pretty nice to have a few of the staff and nurses there know English  but I could have gone to the Bumrungrad International Hospital 45  minutes away from my hotel where they speak fluent English and have 80%  of tourist go there.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, had to sign papers and the docto  could not speak any english at all but glad the nurse who accompanied me  spoke good English and translated for me where the pain was. The doctor  ran some pressure test and also did a blood and urine test only for it  to come back negative on all test. So I was told if i wanted to see a  gynecologist to check why I have pain in my groin area. I refused and  headed back to my hotel. The pain at this point was minimal, but I still  could feel it. It wasnt my appendix cause then I would be in lots of  pain to a point where walking would be hard, it wasn&#39;t UTI as I would  have felt a burning sensation if I went to pee which I didnt, and last I  thought it could have been kidney stones but it associated with burning  sensation when peeing so I was wrong again. Later that night, I ordered  room service for Tom Yam Goong Pla (Somekind of Soup with rice and fish  in it, it was so good!). Once I ate, all the pain subsided and my sides  and my groin area wasn&#39;t hurting anymore. Note to self: DON&#39;T EAT SPICY  FOOD!
</p>
<p>
On
<strong>
January 18th Friday
</strong>
, My lips, chin and  where the buccal fat was removed is not as swollen as much but still  numbing on my chin and lips have some sensation to them when I touch  them, its a tingling feeling. Where buccal fat was removed, still  showing swelling but not as bad. Still wearing the bandages which I have  to wear for 2 - 3 months when going to bed or the whole day when Im at  home.
</p>
<p>
Also had my last check-up today as I changed my flight to  leave on next day instead of Sunday. Dr Chett was worried and asked if I  was still hurting. Mrs Sri was the nurse who came to pick me up today  and explained to me that I had those issues because I ate some very  spicy Thai Curry which messed up my stomach and I confirmed that i did  eat spicy food the night before and then she said that if I ate  something again, it would make the pain go away and she was right. Dr  Chettawut said the same but he checked my wounds and told me that my  healing is doing great and that I&#39;m ready to fly back home but to make  sure to always use the face bandage to support my chin for 8 weeks and  the forehead bandage to support my forehead for 3 weeks to prevent any  skin sagging. He told me that the healing process will take up to a full  year to see the complete results but I noticed my forehead and brow  ridge results right after surgery.
</p>
<p>
On
<strong>
January 19th Saturday
</strong>
,  I woke up at 5 am as Dr Chettawuts driver was to arrive at 6am to take  me to the airport. Had already most of my things packed the night before  and only had to do my makeup and hair then headed downstairs to wait  for the driver. When 6am came around the driver took me to the airport.
</p>
<p>
When  I finally got home, I was relieved and my partner was happy to see me.  It&#39;s now the 21st and my swelling has gone down drastically, I can feel  sensation on my lips but there&#39;s still a tiny bit of numbness. My chin  is still numb and my buccal fat area is still swollen but very minimal.  Overall, it&#39;s only been 2 weeks and 2 days. I return to work on Tuesday  but so far Im very very extremely happy with what I see already.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the weeks and months, I will update this post.
</p>
<p>
Any  questions, I&#39;m willing to answer to both SRS and FFS to the best of my  knowledge and everything I went through with my experience with Dr  Chettawut on both SRS and FFS.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
NOTE
</strong>
:  Throughout my stay, I always tipped taxi drivers, the hotel servers,  and also bought a nice big gift basket that cost me over 200 bucks to Dr  Chettawut and his staff and nurses and drivers for the outstanding care  and work they have done. When I caught the cabs, if my cab fare was  $3.40 in Thai currency, I just gave $5 in thai currency, it&#39;s just out  of courtesy as these people are also trying to make a living. I have not  done this back in 2014 until I finally left which I tipped Dr  Chettawuts driver and just left a tip in his passenger seat just as I  left to walk into the airport so he wouldn&#39;t run back to me to give me  back my money that he thought I have left. I regret this back in 2014  but this time, I was able to have the opportunity to be courteous and  tip and be thankful to the people of Thailand.

I know it’s been a while since this post, but are you still happy with the forehead augmentation? The surgeon I’m going with suggested augmentation with hydroxyapatite, but I guess I feel concerned about side effects (infection, etc.).

Apo9logies if this have been posted a while back and only now I am replying but to answer your question, I am extremely happy with my ffs and forehead augmentation surgery. After 6 months of healing and an additional 6 months, my face have become more feminine and my forehead is smooth. I dont have to hide my protruding brow bone or masculine features on my forehead especially when Im out and the sun is hitting my forehead lol.
</p>
<p>
I have not had any infections but just followed the instructions on healing. I am very satisfied. Dr Chettawut did a great job. My forehead is no longer high, its contoured and smooth.

That is far less than I was expecting!
</p>
<p>
The contouring and forehead augmentation were bone work right?

Thank you, this gives me hope!

Well he has 3 methods depending on your frontal sinus and forehead. I had a small frontal sinus which is only 10% of patients who he had worked on so far and so he did method 2 on me which is without the titamium plating amd titanium screws. He used a synthetic bone called calcium hydroxyapatite. So far im loving my forehead, it just shines so beautifully under the light and i no longer have a shadow where my browridge used to cast on my face. As for the chin and jaw contouring, still awaiting for all the swelling and numbness to go away but so far im seeing minimal results but still have to wait maybe a few more weeks.

I was on the fence about FFS.  But even if it cost me another $10K over that, that is so worth it
