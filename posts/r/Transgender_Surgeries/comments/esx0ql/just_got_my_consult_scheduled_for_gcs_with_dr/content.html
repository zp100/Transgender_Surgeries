The consult is pretty chill, they will likely check down there to see what they are working with and check for hernia. He&#39;s a really nice guy and did my surgery last March

He&#39;s a super nice guy. I had my consult last October, and my surgery is in about 3 weeks ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
He gave me extra time to talk about BA as well and answered all my questions. I asked about recovery times, most common complications, how soon I can take a bath, how long are you kept in the area right after the surgery. A friend of mine had a list of questions for him and sent me a picture of it. I&#39;ll see if I can find the picture to share.

I couldn&#39;t find the picture but she sent me the list. From what I&#39;ve heard they don&#39;t have the transition house set up yet.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
How long off work. - 6 weeks
</p>
<p>
How long on light duty - 6 weeks
</p>
<p>
Transition house - yes will have one by then. Few blocks away. Cost of hotel at worst.
</p>
<p>
Self lubrication - some
</p>
<p>
Specific method - penile inversion
</p>
<p>
One step or two step - one step
</p>
<p>
Revisions (separate charge? Covered?) - Less then 5% need one and it&#39;s no charge
</p>
<p>
Granulation - he will cauterize if needed at 3 months
</p>
<p>
Dilation schedule / lube - 30mins 3 times a day, more is better. Any water based high quality lube.
</p>
<p>
Baths - no submurgance for a few months
</p>
<p>
Schedule:
</p>
<p>
Day before, pre op and meeting
</p>
<p>
2-3 hours surgery
</p>
<p>
2 days hospital
</p>
<p>
6 days in recovery house
</p>
<p>
Follow up
</p>
<p>
Another week in recovery house
</p>
<p>
3 month follow up
</p>
<hr>
<p>
I also asked about stimulation and sex while I was there. He said like 2 weeks for stimulation and about 3 months for penetrative sex. From what I remember at least.

After the 2 days in the hospital, do you have to stay at a recovery house or can you stay at a hotel/home?

I just got a call about some of the specifics the other day. I&#39;m going to have to stay in a hotel room for about 2 weeks after the couple day hospital stay. You could probably stay at home if you live close enough. I&#39;m coming from Port Angeles, so that&#39;s not an option for me. Hehe

Two weeks!!! Whew. That is a long stay. I&#39;m in Pasco. Two hours away from Spokane, but I dunno if I&#39;ll be in a condition to sit in an uncomfortable car seat for that long. :(

Yeah! Ive been trying to gain weight since I got on e its been slow and an up and down battle. Ill be sure to ask. Maybe ill reach my goal thro this 112 to 130 or 140lbs. Thought e would help me gain weight but seems it has had little to no effect on my ability to gain weight.

Hi, I know I&#39;m a bit late on this, but I&#39;ve been considering surgery with Stiller and have been debating colon VS inversion. If it&#39;s not too invasive may I ask how much starting material you had to work with? Did you have to ask him specifically to do colon or did he recommend it?

Wow!!! Thank you. I actually only have a week before I head for my consult. I&#39;m so excited amd nervous. Can I ask if its not to personall how did they check the stuff at the first consult. I was told they check it. At my Drs office they did everything in a manner that would be done if I had a vagina. They laid me down covered me and had me do all the exam of it that way to make it as easy and cause as  little dysphorua as possible. Oh should I dm u or is here fine?

Here is fine.  The exam itself was very um...minimal?  He took a look at what we had to work with and presented some options to me.  I had lost a lot of length on HRT so he was clear we would need to use the skin of my testicles for some depth.  My partners and I had a long list of questions and he was happy to answer them all and present options. If you haven&#39;t started hair removal that will come up too.
