Has anyone had an Orchiectomy before SRS who minds sharing their experience?  I’m curious about how the recovery went, the sudden hormonal shift, any long term feminization that happened as a result of the surgery?

Hi yes I’ve had an orchiectomy last summer. Having srs next November. You’re welcome to message me. The recovery wasn’t too bad but you had to waddle like a penguin for the first week. I was too weak to stand taking a shower for the first week but it wasn’t a bad recovery. My friends and family noticed more facial feminization. I haven’t noticed any other differences though. I had an orgasm maybe a week after surgery, that was the hardest per about recovery. Not being able to get off. I went super slow and it hurt a little but it got easier and easier. Didn’t really affect the ability for things to “work”. Seems about the same as when I started hormones.

I had a complication from my orchiectomy that eventually resulted in a second surgery. so I basically have one side done simple, the other done inguinal.
</p>
<p>
AMA.
</p>
<p>
Here was my description of the complication:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/e1kv57/orchiectomy_recovery_issue_and_whining/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/e1kv57/orchiectomy_recovery_issue_and_whining/
</a>
</p>
<p>
I have no regrets except that -- had I known I would have complications (an impossible imaginary variable) -- I think I would&#39;ve gone for the full inguinal on both sides. However, I have no intention of getting SRS at this time. After 6 months of recovery from the inguinal version of my surgery, I still have a pretty prominent scar, and there&#39;s still a ridge from the incision. This month is a year on from the simple procedure, and I feel no discomfort or pain on the simple side, or at the incision site for it.

I had an orchi about 6 months prior to GRS (the short version is that I was on the GRS waitlist for a year and a half and had been bumped twice, so I had no idea when it would happen. Had an orchi in November of 2018, then got a call in January of 2019 that my GRS date was the following April.)
</p>
<p>
At any rate, the recovery for orchi was pretty simple. I just hung out on the couch for a couple days, and then avoided any heavy lifting or exercise for couple weeks. Never really had any pain, it was just kinda sore for a few days. Totally manageable with ibuprofen.
</p>
<p>
My testosterone was almost nonexistent prior to orchi, so there was no &#34;sudden hormonal shift&#34;. I did it to help alleviate dysphoria, and so I could get off spiro. I didn&#39;t notice any &#34;extra&#34; feminization after surgery, at least not that I would attribute to surgery itself.

So I&#39;m set up for an orchi at some point (waiting on the surgical consult and date).
</p>
<p>
The scrotal saving orchiectomy should not interfere with SRS at all, except that there is a small risk of the skin shrinking a little.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m fairly sure my scrotal sack has already shrunk a little as cypro seems to have caused my testicles to retract more often than not.
</p>
<p>
The shrinkage is very minor (and my balls were pretty big) so it likely wouldn&#39;t cause any issues.
</p>
<p>
Basically, it&#39;s very unlikely it could cause any issues with getting SRS if you get the right kind of orchi. If you&#39;re worried about shrinkage and/or the skin losing some stretchiness I&#39;ve heard some anecdotal suggestions about massaging and stretching the skin daily/regularly.

I’m not too worried. I’m scheduled for a simple Orchiectomy.

I had my orchi in March this year, and my GCS is scheduled for 2023 (or maybe 2022? Don&#39;t remember but it&#39;s far out) :(
</p>
<p>
The orchi recovery was pretty ok overall, I was waddling around for a couple of days but it got better quite quickly, other than soreness at my upper groin area that took 2-3 months to disappear.
</p>
<p>
I asked my surgeon (Dr Bowers) if orchi before GCS is ok, and she said there would be no issues. My main purpose for the orchi was to prevent &#34;regressions&#34; and stop using AAs (I&#39;m aware that it&#39;s possible to stop AAs without the orchi too but I wanted to remove my T-producers completely).
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t really noticed extra feminization happening (although Dr Bowers said I might). My boobs are rounding out but I think that&#39;s due to me taking P than the orchi but who knows?
</p>
<p>
Also, things down there still work the same as before!
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer any other questions you may have!

I&#39;m waiting on date for grs this winter, and had an orchi last fall. My surgeons for grs haven&#39;t had any issue. They looked at the skin i have and were pretty happy with the situation, said it would be plenty and would go well.  Having the orchi was well worth it.

Orchi recovery is easy and tbh if you can I think it&#39;s a great option - GRS is already super hard to recover from, and having an orchi beforehand means that you won&#39;t have to deal with both GRS recovery
<em>
and
</em>
hormonal changes.

(I&#39;m going to assume you meant hormonal shift)  For me, it was fine, I actually felt better. I think that the people who feel bad are people who were on Spiro for years and are actually suffering from the effects of stopping Spiro rather than the
<em>
actual
</em>
hormonal changes.

In all honesty I don’t believe this to be true. I thought this as well before a doctor corrected me. She suggested an Orchi if the wait of SRS was too long (looking like at least a year out).  I can’t see how a small incision could be so detrimental to SRS.

I think it depends on the type of orchi, but I&#39;m not sure which is detrimental.

How is there a loss of skin when it’s a cut to open and stitches to close the same incision?
</p>
<p>
Where does the skin tissue become less?

So you’re talking about shrinkage from the tissue no longer having the weight?  But does that necessarily mean the tissue is gone or did it just retract a noticeable amount?
