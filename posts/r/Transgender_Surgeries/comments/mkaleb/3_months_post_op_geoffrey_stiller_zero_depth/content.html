Was the second stage colon op planned from the beginning or it that something you decided to pursue after this result? If the second stage was planned, maybe he used some technique in preparation for the 2nd surgery? Maybe.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s definitely an unusual outcome and the odd labia hanging looks like it detached at one end. I understand why you feel the way you do. As for the revision. What you want, is a surgeon that sees the same problems that you do and can provide a very detailed and specific treatment plan on how to achieve those results. If that&#39;s Dr. Stiller, then it&#39;s probably worth sticking with him. If he&#39;s gaslighting you with compliments, pretending like there&#39;s nothing to see here, then he&#39;s not listening to you. I don&#39;t know what kind of surgeon he is, but if he&#39;s anything, he&#39;s the #1 authority on YOUR vagina. He&#39;s already aware of the plumbing and knows where everything is. That&#39;s a significant advantage for further surgeries. Just make sure you both see eye to eye on your expectations.

So it was planned originally to be two stages. Also I’ve been wondering that myself. I can’t imagine a surgeon would leave THAT much skin for the labia and think “yep looks right”. So maybe it is some sort of technique to prepare for the second stage.
</p>
<p>
I definitely have been planning along the same lines. I want to get his impression of the work first so I can see if he’s thinking the same as I am as far as the quality of the results. As much as I want to discuss things I dislike about my results and future revisions I also want to get a feel for whether or not I can trust him moving forward based upon his reaction to the results of the first surgery. If I do decide to move forward with him as my surgeon I definitely want a detailed explanation as to how he would revise the issues I have with the current state of my labia.
</p>
<p>
I just wish I wasn’t put in this position of having to sus out my surgeon and figure out if he actually cares or not. Thank you for the solid advice though, I really appreciate it.

Here&#39;s some more solid advice. There&#39;s only one person that&#39;s going to look out for what&#39;s best for you --that is YOU. You should already be addressing these issues with him or his staff. Communication is key here, it&#39;s important that they know how you feel about the results so he can answer any questions that you have. This is your vagina we&#39;re talking about here. Something you&#39;re going to to have to live with for a very long time. Don&#39;t wait for issues to pile up. Put them on the table so they can be addressed ASAP. No surgeon wants to hear their patient has spent three months being anxious and disappointed about their surgery results.

Thank you, 100% agree. I’ve already been in contact with his office and made sure to communicate my dissatisfaction with the surgery results. I’ve also sent them pictures and explained in detail what made me uncomfortable. So I’m hoping that this next appointment will put me at ease and make me feel comfortable trusting him with the revisions.

I had asked that they show Dr. Stiller the pictures when they said they put them in my file and would also note that I was unhappy with my results, but other than that they didn’t give me any real feedback and I haven’t received anything else since.

You need to schedule a follow-up directly with the doctor and ask him about this. Don&#39;t rely on staff to accurately communicate with the doctor.

So sorry you had to go through this!

I appreciate your sharing your pictures as I&#39;m considering Dr. Stiller. If you are up for sharing, did he fix thing for you in a revision?

I honestly am at my wits end with gender affirming surgeons. I literally cannot tell if they’re good people trying their best, or if there is some serious sociopathic levels of manipulation and mistreatment.
</p>
<p>
No. Dr. Stiller never successfully addressed any of the concerns I had with the revisions. Each time it was made to sound like a simple fix, but this last revision I had with him earlier this year left me in the ER having lost 2 liters of blood and an expensive bill for a ambulance ride to a state hospital to be treated (at least I can say I’ve ridden in an ambulance lmao). They couldn’t even determine where the source of the bleeding was comingfrom and had to use a severe clotting agent to get it to stop.
</p>
<p>
I am not negligent and I take my recovery very seriously. During both revisions he seemed to rely heavily upon sutures and stitching to address my concerns, and I can’t say for certain, but I am almost positive that both times the revisions failed due to his stitching just coming undone.
</p>
<p>
I don’t believe he’s a bad surgeon and plenty of other people have been satisfied with both stage one and two of his technique.  I definitely felt as though I was a nuisance every time I brought up that I wasn’t satisfied. I did feel at times I was just part of an insurance mill.
</p>
<p>
However I’d like to clarify that this is my own anecdotal experience, and I’m sure the risks are the same with any surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Just try to keep yourself informed and TRUST. YOUR. GUT.

OMG, that&#39;s tragic! My heart goes out to you. For them to make you feel like a nuisance on top of the problems with the procedures, that&#39;s just awful. Nobody should be treated that way.
</p>
<p>
I agree with you that it&#39;s not necessarily specific to Dr. Stiller - there seem to be a lot of surgeons who don&#39;t seem to handle it well when problems occur. Did he charge you for the revisions? Horrible situation either way I just wonder about the insurance mill aspect like you mentioned.
</p>
<p>
Because of these concerns, I actually recently decided to go with a zero-depth procedure to reduce the risk of serious problems. May I ask, when you had the last revision that resulted in an ER visit were you still zero-depth or had you done the stage 2 colon vaginoplasty at that point?
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much for sharing your experience.

I&#39;m so sorry about your outcome, you thankfully have plenty of skin for a better revision result. I&#39;d recommend getting second opinions before getting it revised with him.
</p>
<p>
I currently live in the pnw and I consulted with this surgeon for an srs revision and tbh I was pretty unimpressed with him. It felt rushed, he didn&#39;t really engage me or answer my questions, and he made suggestions I didn&#39;t really agree with fully (and suggested other things I liked too tbf) anyways maybe it was because it was virtual that it felt that way but I ended up searching elsewhere.

I am 3 months post op zero depth with Dr. Geoffrey Stiller and I&#39;m really disappointed with the results. I feel like I&#39;ve been left with extremely saggy skin with no coherent design or aesthetic. I mean one of my “labia” literally is hanging off of my body. I have random folds of skin as well as just random wrinkles literally everywhere.  I have an appointment for an in person visit in May 14th about revisions and I want to express my discontentment with the whole experience and in particular my results.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m terrified that if I choose to receive a revision from him along with my second stage surgery (colon technique) that I&#39;ll end up even worse off than I was before.
</p>
<p>
I need opinions and advice. Should I just hold out and try to get in a with a more reputable surgeon who can handle revision cases?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just angry and disappointed. At this point I wish I never had surgery with him at all. I feel even more dysphoric than I did before hand.

Thanks for sharing your experience, I’m glad you were able to get satisfying results with him. Also thanks for your advice, I’m really hoping to get a revision with him that I’m satisfied with. I guess I’m just scared of it being something I’m not happy with either.  On a side not I had no idea he offered hormone pellets

Hi there, thanks for getting back in touch with me about the pellets! I’m so glad you had such a good experience. I would be shocked too if my T was that low! Thankfully I produce a steady 30-40 ng/dL otherwise I would absolutely share the same concern. Low T can be brutal from what I understand. So glad they caught that though!
</p>
<p>
In regards to Dr. Stiller and the surgery, I will definitely be meeting him in about a month to discuss a revision. I’m hoping that he did indeed leave extra tissue for step two. I called again to see if I could get in touch with him directly, but unfortunately it doesn’t seem very possible or practical. He’s usually in surgery or busy with stuff and it seems like the gals in the front office communicate everything to him and they assured me he knew what was up. I do have his personal number, but I felt like I really shouldn’t text him or call him.
</p>
<p>
Definitely not writing him off yet though! I just plan to see how things go during the next meeting I have with him. Thank you again for updating me about the pellets!

I wanted to say I think the aesthetics spread is really nice personally!!
</p>
<p>
I do see the problems aesthetically otherwise because droopy or long labia is fine but this is definitely a lot plus one side looking like it partially fell off.
</p>
<p>
How has your recovery been otherwise? You look like you’ve healed well at least? It’s good that you have too much skin rather than too little since that makes it something a revision can help quite a bit with.

Just my opinion: I think it looks good and natural, because I&#39;ve seen some cis women with labia like that or even longer, especially when it comes to inner labia. But I understand that this could not be your ideal outcome. Just talk to your surgeon. :)

Yeah I wouldn’t mind if it was my inner labia that was long. I wouldn’t mind that at all, it’s the fact the it’s my outer labia that’s hanging off my body that bothers me.
