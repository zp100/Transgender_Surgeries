Getting it off your chest will certainly at least help. Do you have any friends there with you? People you can vent to online? That sort of thing can certainly help a great deal!!

My DMs always open if you just wanna blow off some steam or get your mind off things :)

Hang in there. It gets so much easier week on week. This is the worst bit and you’re in a strange place. Keep thinking of home and the end result xxx

You&#39;re almost there, it gets better. Honestly, dilating is more of a major annoyance than anything. Once you get another 7 days or so in, you&#39;ll see the light at the end of the tunnel.
</p>
<p>
Just breathe, try to relax, and know that you are going to heal. You are going to be on cloud nine so, SO soon!!!
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ve got this!!!

You had the strength to get here, you will get through this too.  I had challenges my first 10 days. I found it so necessary and helpful to have someone with me especially upon my release from the hospital. Things will get better, I am 10 weeks postop and while dilating today and touching myself, I had my first orgasm. Oh my goodness, better indeed…just know each week things will get better.

You&#39;ve already accomplished a LOT. Just focus on one step at a time from here. You&#39;ve so got this (your post on what to pack was great BTW). That hospital will be in the rear view mirror soon enough.

I hope this will give you some hope , i felt the exact same as you during my hospital stay being in bed all the time while hooked up to iv , drains and catheter. Just focus on the fact that the hard part is over and now you are gonna be feeling better and better , try to think a bit forward this situation is only temporary and your life will get so much better down the road. In a few months this will be nothing but a memory while you are going to be out there living your best life and feeling comfortable in your skin.
</p>
<p>
You got this.
</p>
<p>
I spend most time sleeping during the hospital stay if you can do that it will help pass time there quicker.
