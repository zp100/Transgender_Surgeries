If anyone can comment on the amount of swelling, let me know. I did send some photos in yesterday morning to the Urologist and they said it looks rough but not hemotomic, just ice and bedrest
</p>
<p>
Edit: I posted my daily blog and made a reference to this sub, I can&#39;t thank you enough for making me feel better about all this.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I know that my swelling is worse than most so I really needed a bunch of folks to help me out, thank you all so much &lt;3&lt;3
</p>
<p>
UPDATE:
</p>
<p>
The swelling has gone down a little bit since the most recent photo but is still significant. I was told to watch out for fever and discoloration and stuff like that and none of that is really happening except just it looking significantly awful. Though it is more the size of plum versus a pear.
</p>
<p>
Also there&#39;s not a significant amount of pain and I imagine if I had a significant hematoma I would be feeling it more and it would not be getting better like it is. The doctor said sometimes people get mild hematomas and then they just let them rest without having to go back in. I cannot afford to go back in and take any more time off so hopefully I can just stay on my back and be good soon.
</p>
<p>
This recovery has been significantly more intense than I imagined. But I&#39;m staying strong and I want to thank everybody for all the support in this thread, it&#39;s made a world of difference. I felt kind of isolated and not very good and it was nice to speak to so many wonderful transpeople cheering me on :):) Thanks!!!!

I had mine done 19 days ago.
</p>
<p>
You look fine. You are swelling a more than mine, but nothing out of the ordinary. It looks rough for the first 2 weeks no matter what.
</p>
<p>
Get ready for the newly exposed nerve endings at the end of your cords to be SCREAMING at you.
</p>
<p>
There was a period of about 3 days where it felt like I had white hot marbles in my hips.

I can&#39;t tell you enough how much I appreciate your response here.
</p>
<p>
Yeah the swelling is going down and it&#39;s not really getting worse but the pain is significant. I didn&#39;t know what that cord pain was I thought it was just tummy pain until you said so.
</p>
<p>
It definitely feels like a significant aching on the side of my pubic bone kind of more near my Abdominal V
</p>
<p>
I see some people don&#39;t have much swelling at like 7 days on the subreddit, I wonder if they got that through there abdomen or inguinely I think is the term.
</p>
<p>
Again, I have never had any surgery or anything like that so I am very insecure about this, your comment made me feel better than any pain pill. Thank you!!!

Yeah thats where the pain is, in your advominal V. Just behind your pubic mound.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m at 19 days, and even my bruising and swelling isn&#39;t entirely gone. But at this rate, it&#39;ll be looking perfect in the next week or two.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, I&#39;m here to be a resource.

Yeah I&#39;m reading about this woman who said she was going to go bike riding after 9 days lol, which is a bad idea I think anyway but I couldn&#39;t imagine having the desire to do that as I can barely stand up :p
</p>
<p>
Hopefully in a day or so I can actually move around a little bit more I am very slow and tired at the moment. Tbh i am most worried about going to the bathroo. For the first time, but I took a stool softener and ill be ok &lt;3&lt;3 Wish i had less stairs :p
</p>
<p>
Thanks again, really &lt;3

I just had mine a week ago. (See my post from this morning) You definitely have a lot more swelling than I did, but I don&#39;t any reason to be consured yet. Lots of ice and rest. A compressive pair of shorts to hold everything in place helped me recover.

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the surgery or just the exhaustion or hormones but whenever I see people post op I just super want to cry at how beautiful they are and stuff &lt;3
</p>
<p>
Thank you I&#39;m a little cautious about the actual underwear situation because I&#39;m so sensitive but I think I&#39;m just going to stay on my back today I had to do a lot of moving the last couple days so hopefully I can really get a head start on the healing.
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much for reaching out and helping me feel better about this!!!!

A pair of volleyball shorts + ice pack + laying on the couch playing video games made for a fairly quick recovery for me. Just finished my first day back at work yesterday.

Glad to hear some of the swelling has started to go down! I&#39;ve got mine tomorrow morning, and I&#39;m a little but nervous. Just hope they are willing to give me some stronger pain killers for afterwards (I have a feeling they&#39;ll only give/recommend paracetamol 😬)

They gave me 10 fives of oxy so that&#39;s about as good as it gets in my opinion it&#39;s Roxy though so it&#39;s not that great but it still works.

Unfortunately I&#39;m in the EU, and they seem to be a bit stricter about handing out oxy. I&#39;ll be lucky if they even give co-codamol! 😕

Holy shit, mine barely swelled at all. I didn&#39;t think it could get this bad.

How is the pain? For me it was a contender for the worst pain I&#39;ve ever experienced.

I didn&#39;t get my oxy prescription until the next day. You talk about one long White Knuckle night, my partner kind of abandoned me so I didn&#39;t have ice or anything like that. It was the worst night of my entire life.

I didn&#39;t have any pain medication for the first like 18 hours or so due to travel, I would say it was about a six but I&#39;m not really great at measuring pain I&#39;ve been injured a lot so like my 6 is someone elses 10?
</p>
<p>
I got oxy tho and still hurts lot when i move in anyway, I think my main issue is is I didn&#39;t ice it enough initially so it kind of got out of control.
</p>
<p>
I showed the doctor and they said it wasn&#39;t like medically necessary for me to come in so I should be okay just I think I&#39;m going to get it worse than other people I am also very small framed so I think it just looks worse than others.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been writing my story and &#34;I didn&#39;t think it could get so bad&#34; is a great title, thanks &lt;3

You&#39;re quite  bruised and swollen. ICE the area frequently for two days and always wear support. Stuff you panties with a clean sock or gauze under your scrotum to fit tightly which will limit further  movement nor should you sit too long.
</p>
<p>
I had an orchie on the 18th and only had bruising around the incision but am sore in the inguinal canal area. We are all different and recover differently.
</p>
<p>
Rotate the ice packs frequently and rest.

This actually happened to me. I felt a vein inside me pop. My doctor had to reopen my incision and keep it opened and stuffed with some sort of string to help me bleed out properly. It was kinda shitty. I was in bed rest for like 2 month. Not gonna lie, mine looked exactly like this.

I didn’t have a pop, bleeding was slow over 6-10 hours.  Like cayssss I needed the hematoma drained.  Like 3 visits over a month.
</p>
<p>
My groin was sore about 2 months post drain and scrotum tender for another 4-6.  I’m a year now and all is good.

I&#39;m glad it all is well now, that sounds rough!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just going to go over some thoughts in my head if that&#39;s okay.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been dealing with this the whole weekend I got my surgery on Thursday and it is getting significantly smaller and better. I don&#39;t have much pain anymore and no fever. My scrotum is starting to wrinkle and while it still looks pretty bad, it&#39;s getting better. I imagine if the reason why it looks like this is because of a hematoma, and it has looked like this all weekend, hasnt gotten worse, my abdomen is less tender, theres more spread in the swelling but good, uniform spread... and i&#39;m not like, in stitches, I think I just got a lot of extra swelling and the small hematoma i probably had will go away on its own. He said sometimes there are small ones that they just let go and I did show them some pictures on Friday and they didn&#39;t tell me to come in or anything.
</p>
<p>
I think it also looks really huge because I&#39;m a very small person in the leg area.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a sex worker so the idea of not being able to eff for like 6 months is not a great prospect :( Thanks, will send pics to the dr. Tomorrow!

You are more than welcome to type thoughts and ask questions.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like you are in better shape than I was and shrinking is good.  My hematoma didn’t shrink much without being drained so all is good news for you.  If the healing stalls much definitely make an appointment and advocate for your health.
</p>
<p>
I had sex about 2 months after the draining was complete or shy of 3 months after the procedure.  I was reasonably healed but the scrotum itself remained tender for awhile after that.
</p>
<p>
From a general activity level I took 4-5 days downtime.  Once I had the hematoma laying around wouldn’t do much good.  Movement was limited but worked the hours I could (office).
</p>
<p>
Take care and here’s to quick healing ❤️‍🩹

No I didn’t. I just had internal bleeding. He reopened it to remove the hematoma. Regardless that’s all it is. It doesn’t happen to everyone but it does happen.

I had my operation on a Friday and mine started looking like that on Saturday. I had to wait till Monday to have the blood removed. I did feel weak for weeks. It was hard to walk and stuff for like 3 weeks maybe even a month. It’s been 5 years since I had mine.

If not already, get yourself a fabric hot/cold water bottle, fill it about half full of cold water and place in the freezer.  Do NOT let it freeze solid!  Check in about 30 minutes by squeezing, if you can hear ice shards crunching it&#39;s ready.  Wrap the very cold water bottle in a towel.  Lay down spread legs and place it against the scrotum carefully.  Your relief from discomfort will be near immediate and may relax you until you doze off.  Keep repeating the process until all swelling and any discomfort no longer occurs.  IF THAT DOES NOT START TO WORK WITHIN 24 HOURS, GET YOURSELF BACK INTO THE DOCTOR&#39;S OFFICE ASAP!  Many people say get the frozen peas but they are not so soft as the fabric water bottle, I know from experience.

I’m right in the middle of making my mind up about  orchi or just wait for full SRS. I’m laying awake at 4am just thinking about it right now. How long did they keep you? In the office? Or did you have to spend the night? Do I need to take a full week off from work? I don’t lift anything heavier than a phone so I’m hoping not long? Today is one of those day where I wish I still drank…😂

I&#39;m an alcoholic, I haven&#39;t drank in 3 years. Never in my life will there ever be a day where I wish I still drank. I would be careful saying stuff like that :/
</p>
<p>
I was in the office goor 5 hours, from 12:00 to 5:00. I&#39;m an adult performer and writer so the amount of time I have to take off of work is going to be different from you.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re seriously considering it watch some videos on YouTube and stuff!

I was just making a little joke. I’m an alcoholic too. 2 1/2 years sober. So I get it. I am so glad I don’t drink anymore. I finally realized there wasn’t enough alcohol in the world to fix me. So I quit and started Transitioning. Now I feel great. I’m just a boring old lady now.😂
