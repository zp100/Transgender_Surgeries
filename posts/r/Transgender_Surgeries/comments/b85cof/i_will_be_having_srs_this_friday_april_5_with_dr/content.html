I&#39;m going to use this comment thread to journal my days. So here goes:
</p>
<p>
Day 1, April 1 2019:
</p>
<p>
Arrived at Bangkok airport around 1:00 pm (local time). Grabbed our luggage and went to wait in the immigration line. Made it through immigration and customs with no issues. Kind of a strange experience as the immigration officer did not say a word to me. Exited customs and found the driver from the surgery center waiting to pick us up. He drove us to our hotel where we checked in and he gave me a little envelope with a letter inside it detailing what to expect. Tomorrow he will be back at 9am to pick us up for the consultation where they will go over everything. The letter also outlined visitation hours and how long I will be in the surgery center (4 days total). Unpacked, laid down to rest my eyes, woke up 8 hours later...whew! It is now 3am and I am wide awake :P

Day 2, April 2 2019 11am:
</p>
<p>
Just got back from the consultation. There&#39;s a lot of information given to me on paper. The gist of it is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Liquid diet starting now. (broth, gatorade, juices without pulp like apple or grape, soda like coke or sprite, etc.)
</li>
<li>
Tomorrow (April 3) I have to do the first part of a bowel cleanse which consists of taking two laxatives at 5pm and then an enema later in the evening.
</li>
<li>
Thursday (April 4) I have to do the second part of the bowel cleanse which consists of drinking 45cc of swift in the morning and then again another 45cc in the evening.
</li>
<li>
Friday (April 5 day of surgery). Stop drinking anything at all after 7am and then my surgery is around 1pm.
</li>
<li>
I get transferred back to the hotel room next week April 9
</li>
<li>
Packing comes out April 12
</li>
<li>
Catheter comes out April 17
</li>
<li>
I can resume eating solid foods April 12
</li>
<li>
They will be taking us to the airport when we leave on April 27.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also the place inside looks really clean and tidy.

Day 3, April 3 2019 3pm:
</p>
<p>
Today we took a 2 hour drive out of Bangkok to go visit the Damnoen Saduak floating market. It was fun and felt like the jungle cruise ride at Disneyland. I got to drink coconut water from a coconut! Also saw several monitor lizards swimming around and crossing the streets.
</p>
<p>
In 2 hours time, I have to take the laxatives and then later on administer the enema.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow is the second part and I won&#39;t be able to go anywhere which is a bummer. For anyone reading, if you want to actually see things around town, I suggest getting here a few days or even a week earlier if you can.

Day 4, April 4 2019 2:17pm:
</p>
<p>
Today is bowel cleansing day. I have done bowel cleanses before. So far this has not been as bad as others I have done. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s still awful, but not as bad. It&#39;s a pretty boring day today. Just watching movies between many bathroom breaks. In 3 hours I take the final piece of the cleanse and then it&#39;s waiting until 1pm tomorrow for surgery. My emotions are a bit of a roller coaster. I&#39;m sad that I am stuck indoors and can&#39;t see the city. I&#39;m glad that I went out yesterday and got to do something fun here. I&#39;m scared of the surgery tomorrow. I&#39;m excited for the results of the surgery tomorrow. It&#39;s just a waiting game now.

I changed my mind. The bowel cleanse was pretty awful. My body rejected the second portion of swiff; i threw it up. So far I have lost about 3kg (6.6 lbs) since April 2. Once I am able to eat again, I will be eating all the fattening foods. In 30 mins, I have to stop drinking any liquids. Then it&#39;s just a waiting game until they pick me up at 1pm.

Day 10 April 10 2019 2 pm
</p>
<p>
The last couple of days have been pretty bad. I had several panic attacks in the recovery room at the hospital. My arms and face were completely numb for awhile and I was incredibly sleepy. The soup I was trying to eat made me feel very sick. It was not a pleasant experience.
</p>
<p>
I was moved to the hotel yesterday and I am doing much better now. I am able to eat soft foods like bread and scrambled eggs. On Friday the packing comes out and I can finally eat what I want. Catheter stays in for another 7 days which sucks though.
</p>
<p>
Also I do not know how anyone does this alone.

Everything is much better now that im back at the hotel. The recovery room they put you in is a little clostrophobic. They also give you lots of meds. Visitation hours are only a few hours long and i slept through most of them due to the meds. I think all that combined with being away from loved ones is pretty scary which is why i was freaking out a bit.

Mostly all the mundane stuff you take for granted. Like opening your hotel room door for room service/cleaning, moving bed covers around, getting snacks at a nearby market, getting dressed, washing yourself, etc.
</p>
<p>
Also the recovery room at the hospital has no windows so it gets a bit lonely and clostrophobic.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m able to walk but its very slow and i still have a catheter i have to lug around so without someone around to help things are a little more difficult to do.

Did you just consult over video chat initially? Or did you consult in person?
</p>
<p>
Chett, as well as as Suporn/Dr.Banks and preecha is the top surgeons I want to go with,  but I’m traveling to Thailand in June to consult in person because I’ve never been to Thailand before and I’d rather have a feeling for how long the flight is (I’m in the U.S too) as well as what the hospital and facilities are like for such a major surgery,
</p>
<p>
If you did just do it over video chat, have you been to Thailand before?

I did not do any consults or visiting of Thailand before this :&lt; I relied on others experiences. I also have an acquaintance who just got hers done in November 2018 who had a positive experience.

Let me know what you think! I&#39;m interested in knowing how nice the facilities are too and how your consult goes but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to make a trip to Thailand just for that.
</p>
<p>
If you want to see parts of the hospital Dr. Bank works out of then Ally Telly on YouTube has some videos after her surgery that show the room as well as the lobby area.
</p>
<p>
Let me know how it goes and if you like it  I&#39;ve heard really good things about the hospital in Chonburi.

Thanks for sharing! As someone who is currently undecided about who to go to for surgery following stories like these is incredibly helpful.
</p>
<p>
What made you decide on Chett?
</p>
<p>
How long was the waitlist?
</p>
<p>
Are you nervous?

<p>
I have heard from others that it is worth it. Also, the results I have seen (both on here and on his site) looked really good compared to other surgeons I was looking at. Additionally, I am in the US and the cost of having it in the US was more than having it here.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Way shorter than I thought lol. I was expecting at least 1 year. However, I initially contacted them in September of 2018 and their earliest available was January 2019 which was actually too soon for me :P So I chose April because it aligned with my schedule better. They had no issues with that date either.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes. I am also excited; more excited than nervous actually. It will be my first major surgery ever so naturally I am going to be a little nervous/scared. However, when I think of the end result, I get excited and happy.

The price in 2019 is 398,000 THB (inclusive of scrotal and/or groin skin graft). I paid a little extra because I paid via credit card which they tack on an extra 4% fee for.
</p>
<p>
The hotel I am staying in is the Dusit Princess. I got an executive suite for 2 people (my wife is here with me). It&#39;s 5000 THB per night, but every 11th night is free. It includes free wifi and free breakfast (except for the free 11th night). The breakfast here is really good; it&#39;s all you can eat. You can get eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, toast, a few pastries, some sort of noodle soup (haven&#39;t tried it yet), various juices, and coffee.

No OP, but  average cost of SRS is Thailand is around 400,000 bhat (or roughly $12,000-13,000)
</p>
<p>
That’s just for the surgery, extra costs would be the stay in Thailand (most people stay for about a month to fully recover before heading home) so that’ll bring us to an extra $4,000 roughly for 30 days
</p>
<p>
Food and other expensive including flights ect I’m gonna round up to around 6,000-10,000
</p>
<p>
Right!
</p>
<p>
So a
<em>
rough
</em>
estimate of the total cost of SRS would probably be around $27,000 out of pocket
</p>
<p>
So all in all, it’s probably roughly the same cost as getting it done in the U.S since there would be less travel and hotel costs,
<em>
But
</em>
IMHO Thailand has better techniques.

Yeah, for me I paid about $24000 USD:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
2 Economy tickets to BKK: $982.00
</li>
<li>
2 Business tickets home: $5,654.00
</li>
<li>
Hotel Dusit Princess (Exec Suite) - Check in Apr 1 - Apr 27: $4,151.93
</li>
<li>
Surgery (including extra 4% fee for using a cc): $13,052.27
</li>
<li>
Total: $23,840.20
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can save a bit of money by not getting the executive suite and by cutting your hotel stay in two: the 4 days before surgery and the days after surgery so you aren&#39;t paying for a room while in the surgery center. I opted to get the executive suite since my wife is here with me and it has a little living room area which will be nice to have once I am back here recovering.

Is that including airfare and other costs or just the surgery?

Was the cost of having it in the US more than having it there even after things like the flight and hotel?

In the US they did? Or in Thailand?
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure just by the number, I’m only familiar with the prices in Japan and Korea

In the US, the surgery prices started around $23,000 USD just for surgery. For just my surgery in Thailand it is around $13,000 USD (but I paid by cc so it&#39;s 4% extra).

Nice! I do have a couple of questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
About how long was your SRS surgery?
</li>
<li>
Any tips I should know about before going in?
</li>
</ul>

I went in early . They to the most uncomfortable thing. The nurse shaves you down there with some odd liquid then go see doctor and get anaesthesia . I went in I think around 11 or so. Woke up later at night time.  I believe it takes about 8h. I didn&#39;t need a skin graft. Fell asleep right after surgery. Didn&#39;t feel discomfort just super tired. They do make you walk down some stairs with the nurses. To resting room . I had mine Sept 10. Left Oct 1st. Stayed in dusit princess . They have a pretty garden . And a pool you can&#39;t use after surgery ._.
