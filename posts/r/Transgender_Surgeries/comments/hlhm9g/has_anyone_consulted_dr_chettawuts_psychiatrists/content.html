I have no local psychiatrists that aren&#39;t transphobic to get SRS recommendation letters from. I&#39;ve been on hrt for more than 2 years and have had VFS. I already have the surgery scheduled for next month and the only option I have is to consult their thai psychiatrists for the letters.
</p>
<p>
And on Dr. Chettawut&#39;s website it says &#34;wearing feminine clothing and light make-up&#34; would help??? It makes me think that the consultation would be 50/50 and I&#39;d be at the complete mercy of them risking a lot of money. Has anyone experienced getting their letters from Thai psychs?
</p>
<p>
Any advice or experiences to share? :(

I actually had to go to one of the psychiatrists over there because Dr. Chettawut claimed that signature on one of my letters was too faint. Happy to answer any questions you have.

How were they? Were they strict at all and what kind of questions did they ask? Also were you presenting female? Thank you so much!

I was nineteen years old at the time, which probably would have meant that if they were likely to be sensitive, then they would have certainly been with me given the safeguarding issue for younger people. That being said, I had been socially transitioned for six years at that point, having been on puberty blockers and later HRT too. I was very clearly female. In fact, I was passable enough for them to question if I was even biologically male.
</p>
<p>
The language barrier was fairly significant, so be prepared for some awkwardness. I had 1/2 letters, so I only needed one. Dr. C’s office were very helpful with arranging this, in fact one of the nursing staff goes with you to a nearby hospital.
</p>
<p>
It is a fairly swift process, though with all of the travelling it takes up about half a day- so, be prepared for that.

Oh okay. Well I’ve been technically presenting female for a few years now just not overly feminine with heavy makeup and skirts. And I’ve been on HRT for more than 2 years closer to 3 plus I’ve already done one gender affirming surgery, I’m 22 and I haven’t been misgendered in over an year so maybe I’m passing enough. So I guess it’ll be okay. Just anxiety I guess.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing your experience with me. That was really helpful. I think I’ll need both letters from them.

Have you been discussing this with them? They are probably best suited to answer any procedural questions. If you have any more personal ones though, don’t feel afraid to message me.

Well I tried getting them locally from my psychiatrist first and found out today that she doesn’t really do trans stuff :) so I’m gonna talk to them about this now. And thanks I will.

You’re a minor in Thailand until 20. Not sure that counts for much, but you’d  think they would be more careful.

prior to that piece of legislation, surgery was regularly performed on those 16 and above with parental consent. As such, there is still a culture of sympathy towards trans young people. Dr. C and his clinic were just very eager to help.

I’ve never heard of anyone being refused. Just play along.
</p>
<p>
Make sure the anaesthetist knows about your VFS.

It’s just I know that if I do so considering I’ve already had a gender affirming surgery the chances are it’ll be okay. But the uncertainty until I actually arrive in Thailand is giving me anxiety attacks :(

I understand the anxiety, but there’s no chance you’ll get turned down if you behave normally. I’m pretty sure you could turn up presenting male and still get it if you had a good story. If you come across crazy you might have a problem, but I’ve never heard of that either.
</p>
<p>
Getting into Thailand at all is a bigger problem.

Getting into Thailand part I’m talking with the clinic and it’s going fine so, I hope everything will go fine.
