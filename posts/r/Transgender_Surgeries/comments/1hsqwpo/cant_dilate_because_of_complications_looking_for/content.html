So I&#39;m just about 2 months post op, and because of a couple complications, I haven&#39;t been able to dilate.  At all.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?  If so, did you have to have a revision to open everything back up, or were you able to start dilating at some point?
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

This is a serious problem and you need to try your best to dilate. Look here

You MUST use a web browser to view that. Do not use a reddit app or you wonâ€™t see all of it, and thereâ€™s a lot.
</p>
<p>
If you canâ€™t fix it youâ€™re probably looking at another major surgery, like colon vaginoplasty. Itâ€™s not a small revision.

Yeah, another major surgery is my concern.  I&#39;m just worried because I have a fistula and my skin graft failed.  I got the short end of the stick.

Thereâ€™s a section in the wiki on fistulas.
</p>
<p>
A fistula is mainly related to the surgeons skill. Who was it?

I haven&#39;t been able to dilate, on my surgeon&#39;s instructions, since the surgery about 7 weeks ago.  I did once, and then my skin graft completely failed and fell out.

So sorry for you they said itâ€™s 1% that got fistula but so many girl got it , skin graft? Like they did what to you , I did the basic technique so I donâ€™t know what is it , maybe they recommend revision ðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜“

Sorry you had this experience. Keep being strong! While I havenâ€™t had any complications in mine. I would say first talk to your surgeon and see if thereâ€™s anything you could do complication wise or if they can fix it.
</p>
<p>
Another thing would be. What method did you have done? Was it PIV, PPT, etc.? I think I know of some surgeons that can do revisions

It&#39;s PIV, and my surgeon says he wants to wait two months (which is next week) to see if the fistula is healing at all on its own.  On top of that, my skin graft failed, so I&#39;m kinda up shit creek.

You are strong and keep your head up! Praying and hoping your fistula heals. Your surgeon might be able to fix it, if not:
</p>
<p>
For revision surgeons, You could look into Dr. Littleton who uses a graft from the small intestine for a possible revision. Also Bluebond in NYC uses peritoneal graft.

I&#39;ve heard of them, I&#39;ll look into them.  Thanks!  I&#39;m also deciding if I want to trust my surgeon again after my fistula heals/gets repaired.  He seems adamant that there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;ll heal on its own.
