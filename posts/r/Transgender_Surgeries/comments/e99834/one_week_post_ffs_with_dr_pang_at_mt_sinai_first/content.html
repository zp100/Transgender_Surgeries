Hi Everyone,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a week out from FFS with Dr. Pang and wanted to do a post about my experience as I know a lot of people are interested in him as a newer practitioner. It&#39;s obviously super early in my recovery experience, so I wont be posting any photos quite yet, but so far my experience has been really great and I wanted to share. I had: forehead reconstruction, rhinoplasty, brow lift, small fat transfer to upper lip, my chin decreased in size and shaped, and my jaw muscles shaved down, to preserve my jawline but give it a more slender and feminine appearance. I&#39;m terrible at remembering the technical names of everything.
</p>
<p>
I had a consult with Dr. Pang about 3 months ago, and time really flew to my surgery day. Two weeks before I went in for standard pre-surgical surveys and blood giving, talked shortly with the doctors, then that was that. Day of I arrived very early in the morning (first surgery on the schedule for the day!) and filled out more forms, then got changed into hospital garb in the waiting area, where I spoke with the anesthesiologist, Dr. Pang for one last overview of what we were going to do, and an assorted group of nurses and assistants. Everyone made me feel super comfortable, answered all my questions, and made me feel like I was in good hands. This has been my second surgery with Mt. Sinai, and I have to say patient comfort and hospitality was something they did incredibly well both times. I found everyone really did what they could to be kind and caring throughout, and it&#39;s really incredibly appreciated as a patient.
</p>
<p>
Before I knew it I was laying on the operating table, then waking up in recovery, high as a kite. A nurse fed me crushed ice and i just kinda laid there. Surgery itself took 11 hours, door to door, and I&#39;m not sure how long I was in the recovery room but I next woke up in my room. A nurse came in to bring water, ice, juice and jello and drugs as needed, and I mostly dosed in and out of sleep with a very swollen feeling head. Nurses checked in and helped often, I drank a ton of water, and before I knew it it was breakfast time. My girlfriend came in and hung out until I was discharged around 2pm. I felt remarkably well in recovery with little pain, and my nurses commented that I was taking everything extremely well, which might have been flattery to keep my mood up, or I just handle post op pain well. Either way I felt well enough to go home, we took a short cab ride, and that was the surgery day.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Just remembered one important tip: somewhere I saw to bring Aquaphor advanced therapy healing ointment for my lips, and it was a lifesaver. You breathe through  your mouth a lot and you will really be happy you have it!

At home I laid in bed. My face was super swollen, especially my chin and eyes, but I felt alright. I mostly spent the first few days laying in bed with tv or movies playing in the background but mostly I was napping. The days passed pretty quick, especially at first. I thought I&#39;d do more reading and playing video games, but tbh I was pretty exhausted and didnt have the energy for much. After two days I started to take baths, being sure to keep my head and bandages dry. Eating during this time is very annoying, as my chin and mouth are numb, and there are stitches inside that I have to avoid, but it is luckily not painful. Eggs, jello, fruits, soft foods with a little body so they dont get everywhere are your friends. Sleeping is annoying as well, you must sit up at all times, and with the packing in your nose it is necessary to breathe from your mouth, so I mostly slept in small chunks throughout the day.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I had my one week follow up and had my bandages taken off, which was a huge relief. having the packing removed from my nose felt amazing. I&#39;m still very very swollen, but I&#39;m super happy with my results as I can see now. My nose looks lovely, even with the cast still on, and my brow was able to be taken down and is now very smooth, looking forward to seeing the swelling go down as well. I think my eyebrow positioning is now perfect, and my eyes are rounder and more open. My chin and jaw are still super swollen but I&#39;m looking forward to seeing them.
</p>
<p>
When I look in the mirror I really love what I see so far. It feels a little weird sometimes, cause I simultaneously feel like a whole new person, and like myself, just as I should have been. It&#39;s kinda weird to describe. I was a little scared of feeling too different, while at the same time not wanting to look like the same person (obviously). I feel really comfortable so far.
</p>
<p>
Any questions feel free to ask!

I&#39;ve been very surprised to find my pain very low and manageable. During my hospital stay I was on a lot of pain meds I&#39;m pretty sure but since then Ive found I haven&#39;t had to take my high strength stuff much, and can mostly rely on motrin / tylenol and a low level prescription pain killer. I have oxycodone for if I get severe pain, but after the first couple days I&#39;ve been going off it as it didn&#39;t seem like I need it. I don&#39;t know if this is to be expected, or if I&#39;m just quick to recover.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that I&#39;ve been on two antibiotics, stool softeners for bowel health, and a prescription mouthwash (I have stitches in my mouth and cant brush my teeth with them there) It&#39;s a lot of meds but I just keep a little list with my times written out to track them.
