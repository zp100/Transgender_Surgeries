Hi everyone! I recently had a consult with the team at M Health in Minneapolis for bottom surgery with Dr. Pariser and I wanted to share my experience! I was originally scheduled to have my consult with him in November but recently a NP on his team has started taking on patients.
</p>
<p>
First off the facility, It is so nice! the check in process was a little strange. You check in at the front desk of the floor you&#39;re visiting and they give you a badge (not sure what they were for) and then you wait in one of the lobby alcoves related to the department. The space is wide open and there are gendered restrooms as well as all-gender. It wasn&#39;t long before a nurse called my name for the intake process where he took my blood pressure and went over my medical history. Then walked me to the exam room.
</p>
<p>
The NP arrived shortly and we spent the next 45mins talking about the procedure and Dr. Praiser&#39;s approach. She was incredibly easy to talk to and I voiced all of my questions. They told me that Dr. Pariser does full depth as well as minimal depth vaginoplasty. He can do either PI or PPT for the full depth and is somewhat on the cutting edge of vaginoplasty. He uses a combination of robotics and hands-on surgery to work from the abdomen down and from the crotch up. He builds the vaginal cavity over a dilator template and uses peritoneal tissue if there isn&#39;t adequate depth with the genital tissue. The NP informed me on the hair removal process and recommended places in town that they work with. There are some folks that ask for revisions but most of the time it&#39;s for aesthetic reasons like the hood changing after the swelling comes down. He also sees quite a few folks wanting revisions from other surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I was given a list of contacts with the surgery team with their phone number and pronouns. They told me to call if I had any additional questions. We will be scheduling the follow up appoint for when I finish my hair removal and the surgery will be schedule 3-4 months from that appointment if the hair removal is adequate. I am feeling really good about choosing this team!
