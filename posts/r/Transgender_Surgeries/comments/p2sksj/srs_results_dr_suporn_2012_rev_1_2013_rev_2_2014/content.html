AMA I guess. I decided to share those &#34;for science&#34; and cause I think it turned out pretty damn well.
</p>
<p>
I had some complications and 2 revisions.
</p>
<p>
Most notably I had a partial clitoris necrosis. It was reconstructed in the first revision. However I asked for it a second time as I could not identify it visually. I was told it is still there by my Surgeon just deep retracted below the skin. I decided to not let him tweak that any further as the sensation is definitely there.
</p>
<p>
Other complications were fistulas between the labia minora that were fixed later.
</p>
<p>
For the things that were done during the revisions:
</p>
<p>
1st
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Clitoral reconstruction,  Labia minora reduction,  Anterior commissure,  Fixing 2 fistulas, Asked for clitoral hood (it&#39;s meh but that&#39;s fine)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
2nd
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Anterior commissure,  Posterior commissure/fourchette, Raphe line reduction, Removal of excessive urethra tissue
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sensation: I had zero nerve damage and could feel everything as soon as they took of the packing. It took a while to heal and was swollen but it felt right immediately. Sensation is very good, inside and outside. I can climax multiple times in minute intervals clitoral and/or vaginal.
</p>
<p>
Recovery: The main surgery took an entire year to heal and dilation was an absolute nightmare. for up to 9 months.
</p>
<p>
Sex: Works perfectly fine and I do not need lube at all if I&#39;m in the mood. I get wet from in and outside. The 6 inch are more than enough.
</p>
<p>
Maintenance: Zero. I stopped dilating entirely after the 4 year mark and checked if I lost depth by being abstinent for 6 months. I still had the original depth and same girth. I don&#39;t douche either unless the smell is off which happens rarely. I have a good amount of natural discharge which likely comes from the embedded urethral tissue and tunica vaginalis (unconfirmed as of now). I suspect the skin might have changed too over the years. This was a meshed skin graft and as you can see it&#39;s definitely pink and mucosal like inside.
</p>
<p>
I will not go as far as calling it unclockable but I am very happy with it for what it is.

The V scar tends to have a different color if that is what you mean by it going around the labia. From most I&#39;ve seen so far with surgery results if it&#39;s there it tends to go inside.
</p>
<p>
cis women have that line too but it doesn&#39;t go inside or around. It either isn&#39;t there or blends into the labia minora.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure how he did it exactly. He told me he can do it but it&#39;s gonna cause scar tissue. I told him that&#39;s fine by me.  I would assume he just cut it out where the orifice was and yes there is some scar tissue but it&#39;s barely visible and due to the revision there probably turned into a much more favorable color.

I have some questions: You said you came back for revision surgery to minimize and clean your inner lips, what was the original result like? From almost all the photos of results that I have seen from various surgeons, the inner lips were always quite neat, small and almost (or, in some cases, completely) invisible, not that I don&#39;t like that look, but personally I would prefer a &#39;butterfly&#39; aesthetic more, such as on larger, more pronounced inner lips. That is something you think is achievable or is it even the norm before the revision? Is there a margin of accommodation to personal preferences in a surgery? Dr. Suporn asked him what kind of aesthetic would he prefer, for example?

I did not ask for anything specific initially.
</p>
<p>
I actually asked him to reduce the size of the inner labia twice which he did on top of fixing the fistulas. They did definitely look butterfly like. Unfortunately I do not have any pictures from back then and asked to have them removed from their servers later.
</p>
<p>
I do prefer a more tidy look.
</p>
<p>
Suporn developed his own technique. It isn&#39;t a PI, It isn&#39;t the standard scrotal graft and it isn&#39;t PPT. A meshed (arguably) graft is used primary for the vaginal lining. It is supplemented by urethral tissue and (as far as I know at the moment) in a case by case basis the tunica vaginalis. Therefore the entire shaft is available for reconstruction of the labia minora. They tend to be rather big with his technique.

Hello, thanks for the answer, I have a question: How common do you think it is to achieve results like this (with very long labia minora)? That is one of the main reasons why the suporn technique attracts me, I also have a doubt Being circumscribed and the previous size are factors in that, I am not, but I do not know if the &#34;thing&#34; is big enough to be able to have the result that I would like to have.

The labia minora are decently sized (more than mine after 2 reductions now) with all results I have seen from bank and suporn. I am in their server (exclusive for the clients). Circumcised or not. If that is what you want he sure is the perfect choice. I&#39;ve seen people with micropenises there getting 6 inch depth and getting very natural aesthetics. Suporn and Bank do very well with little material available.
</p>
<p>
As I said, the entire shaft is available to create the labia. This tends to be way more than enough and Suporn in particular doesn&#39;t like to waste anything.

what part of it do you feel like is clickable though? i&#39;m just wondering because i want to be able to understand these things for my future surgery
</p>
<p>
i personally don&#39;t think anything is clockable about it though. its the best result ive ever seen. i love how tidy/streamlined it is, and suporns secondary sensate organ technique is chef&#39;s kiss.
</p>
<p>
i wish he did tunica vaginalis grafts though

The second sensation organ is visually clockable and nothing I was looking forward to. You can see it and it does not belong there. Totally a giveaway. The vestibule gets more firm due to it and some leftover tissue as well. This is not natural and you could feel it when you pay attention.
</p>
<p>
Then you have the lack of a clitoral hood. Or lets say a poor attempt at making one. The clit would start where the inner lips start on a deeper level on a 3d pane. It would be surrounded and kinda burried. They would go slightly to the side and form 2 notches where they fuse with the frenulum of the clit that continues into the rest of the inner labia. Naturally this is far more detailed.
</p>
<p>
The inner labia are thicker around the upper side than the natural equivalent and you can see the texture change. inner side of the inner labia pink, outer side of the inner labia skin color. It&#39;s an immediate giveaway. color differences are normal but it would be a gradient.
</p>
<p>
Then you have the urethral meatus which is massive compared to any cis equivalent. It mostly wouldn&#39;t be visible except from the urethra.
</p>
<p>
There is also the fact that the inner lips don&#39;t meet below the orifice completely. Normally they would do so and continue neatly into the raphe line. It&#39;s not too bad since I had a couple revisions but that is a huge giveaway.
</p>
<p>
The anterior I&#39;d argue about. Still to wide for my taste. But that objectively falls into what is normal.
</p>
<p>
The labia majora tend to gap more than everyones I have seen so far. I&#39;m thinking about fillers because of it. I suppose it&#39;s a certain lack of fat tissue in them. Not too bad but noticeable.
</p>
<p>
See people say there is a big variety and that is true. Sometimes posting the wall of vaginas which notably has some srs results in it (few know). The structures fundamentally all follow the same rules and if they don&#39;t you could tell.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not unhappy. It&#39;s a great result for what it is. Few would notice what is off in the heat. But for example a gyn should be able to tell and I&#39;d expect other women with some experience being able to as well.
</p>
<p>
btw he does tunica vaginalis grafts on a case by case basis. You might have to ask though.

im surprised about the gyn comment though. ive heard a ton of girls say their gyno literally could not tell at all ever.
</p>
<p>
also to be fair the SSO is the part of the surgery that is kinda done as a modification to cis anatomy in a way to make it &#34;even better&#34;

SSO?
</p>
<p>
Well yes I know about girls who say their gyn can&#39;t tell... I don&#39;t believe it. sorry. More likely they wanted to be nice or didn&#39;t actually look close. It&#39;s at least painfully obvious to me for every single outcome. Yes there are very good ones and they look pretty but still. I&#39;m not even a gyn although I spend a good amount of time learning about the techniques in case I wouldn&#39;t get the surgery. DIY so to speak.
</p>
<p>
My gyn raised an eyebrow and seemed genuinely impressed but I did not force him to give any comment. He just told me it&#39;s pretty damn good. So like... I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they be a little more kind than necessary.
</p>
<p>
I had some cis people figure some of the things I mentioned too. They wouldn&#39;t have told me if I didn&#39;t ask for it. What they figured was always the secondary sensation organ (and being rather tight)

What is a &#34;meshed skin graft&#34; exactly?
</p>
<p>
Regarding the discharge, anecdotally, a friend of mine had PI with wittenburg several years ago, and wittenburg expressly said once that she does not use urethral tissue for the inside canal lining.  My friend has somewhat of a discharge from the inside of her canal, she speculates it may be because she was uncircumcised and the former-foreskin (which is typically kinda wet) might be giving some discharge.  Or maybe the skin on the inside changed properties and now emits a bit of discharge.

The foreskin does not produce any fluids. Idk about the details, it&#39;s an entirely different technique. The reason is probably something else.
</p>
<p>
He takes scrotal skin graft and meshes that (apparently by hand) besides the other things already mentioned. This leads to it covering a larger surface area and is less likely to fail due to blood building up between graft and the canal. Downside: Recovery time.
</p>
<p>
Actually... just google it. It is done for various purposes.

Thanks, from googling it looks like &#34;skin mesh graft&#34; means it&#39;s just skin but with small incisions cut along it, mostly to make it larger surface area, also to make it &#34;take&#34; better.
</p>
<p>
Unrelated question: is your vaginal discharge linked to arousal or is it constant/static (i know there&#39;s some pre-cum from the urethra but I mean from the vaginal canal specifically)?  Do you need to wear panty liners?

I need panty liners from time to time.
</p>
<p>
Meaning there is some passive lubrication that however increases a lot when I&#39;m aroused.
</p>
<p>
And yes I&#39;m specifically talking about the vagina, nothing that comes out of the urethra.

Probably one of the best results I&#39;ve seen, period. You&#39;ve healed incredibly well and honestly I&#39;d say it&#39;s damned near unclockable. Super happy for you and super jealous! 😊💜

A quick question, how much healing and recovery does it take with revisions? Is it similar to the GRS operation or is it less?

The revisions were not very painful or limiting at all. Those healed within 1-3 months. Not comparable to the main surgery.

Holly sh*** thats the most realistic result I&#39;ve ever seen. Is that hecause of the skin color that u cant see the scars that much? Did it become so beautiful after mamy years or was the surgery just an overall perfection? Since most before and afters I&#39;ve seen were actually 1-2 years old.

The scars faded quickly and healed really well. You can still see them when you look close, they&#39;re faint dark lines on the labia majora. I don&#39;t think there was much change after the 2 year mark. It&#39;s not the skin color, I&#39;m rather pale and caucasian. Scars tend to be visible. I&#39;m surprised too that it healed that well.

I told Suporn to do his best right before I passed out from anesthesia and he delivered.

They changed their recommendations and I would advise you too to remove the hair especially around the perineum.
</p>
<p>
No I had no hair removal at all and I&#39;m hair free inside.
</p>
<p>
But it did happen to a handful other people who went there and while in most cases it isn&#39;t deep, like 0.5 inch max and still can be removed, it would have been a lot easier before.

Wow, you got a really great result, thank you so much for sharing!! I haven&#39;t seen many post revision results from him, but yours definitely lives up to the &#34;hype&#34; lol. As someone booked with Bank at the moment, this is really great to see. If you don&#39;t mind me asking, during the labia minora revisions, did you ask to have them thinned out at all or just trimmed? A lot of his labia minoras can look a bit thicker than their natal counterparts, but yours look very natural. You also mentioned some necrosis of the clitoris followed by reconstruction, I assume from the Chonburi organ. Did you lose any sensation during this process, either due to the necrosis or the revision? Finally, you mentioned fistulas in the labia minora. I&#39;m assuming these fistulas presented cosmetic issues only, not functional?
</p>
<p>
Again, thanks for sharing. If my vulva turns out half as good as yours I&#39;ll be extremely happy.

I did complain about the labia minora being too thick, especially towards the anterior and wanted them trimmed as well. I think he did both although they&#39;re still rather thick.
</p>
<p>
Fixing the fistulas was only cosmetic if you consider sticking a finger horizontally through both of them acceptable. It didn&#39;t cause issues.
</p>
<p>
My clit was reconstructed from the chon organ (I wanted it gone) but as far as I can tell failed again. I can&#39;t tell you if I lost sensation per say. The necrosis was only partial and early. I still feel a lot where it is supposed to be. It goes deeper than just the tip which was affected. Like It is way more than enough.

Unfortunately yes. The first time they gave me a stick to bite into and I passed out from pain. The second time I asked for sleeping pills and alcohol on top of the local anesthetics and that at least made me pass out 30 minutes into the surgery.

No not at all. Those usually work great. But I think local anesthesia is nowhere near sufficient when the doc cuts deep. I lost my sense of hearing in the moment and the second I asked the nurse if this was normal my vision went monochrome and I passed out.

Naa I felt every single cut and told him. He kept pumping anesthetica into the tissue but that just didn&#39;t help at all. I was in agony for about an hour. That wasn&#39;t just a single cut that made me pass out.
</p>
<p>
Would do it again. My pain perception is messed up since that happened.

In my opinion you almost guaranteed need one. There are always 1-2 things that aren&#39;t perfect and some steps that cannot be done in the first surgery.  Unless you just don&#39;t care that is.

I suppose it depends on an individual&#39;s perception of it after healing. Can I ask, is the bottom photo after the initial surgery? x
