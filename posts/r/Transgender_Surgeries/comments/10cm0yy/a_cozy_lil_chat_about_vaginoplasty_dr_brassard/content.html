hi
</p>
<p>
I had good ol’ fashioned full-depth vaginoplasty with Dr. Brassard on October 12th of 2022 and lately, I’ve been wanting to write about the experience. I know there’s already one fantastic and thoroughly comprehensive guide for this surgery at GRS Montreal on the subreddit, but it’s from a few years back and I figured—hey—before my surgery, I  was feverishly combing
<a href="/r/Transgender_Surgeries">r/Transgender_Surgeries
</a>
for every scrap of info I could get about Brassard so it wouldn’t hurt to pay it forward and make a post. The other guide does a really great job of walking the reader through the step-by-step process of putting your application together, getting your date, the months leading up to the surgery, etc. This isn’t going to be that. Consider this more of a chitchat with your bestie at the slumber-party and less of an instruction manual. Concision is not my strong suit. This will be long and rambly. Everything in here is purely my opinion based on my experience and everyone is valid in thinking what they want and  all that lovely stuff :)
</p>
<p>
<em>
Pre-Op
</em>
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen a lot of posts from people who are either assembling the application or who have just applied asking others about approximate timelines for when they can expect to hear back and get a date. I first applied in late September 2021 and I was contacted in January 2022 with an offer for an early March slot. For a variety of reasons that wasn’t gonna work for me, but I told them that I would much prefer August 2022 and they said
<em>
Yes Ma’am&lt;3
</em>
and they marked that down in my file. They were extremely amenable to making that time slot work for me and I highly suggest thinking about what slot would work best for you and communicating that with them. It seems pretty ambiguous what their scheduling is like, sometimes it’s faster and sometimes it’s slower. Don’t wait around. Make it work with your life. It’s your day.
</p>
<p>
Anyway. I did get a date for late August but I got COVID at the beginning of the month and my date ended up being pushed back to October.
<strong>
Take COVID seriously in the two to three months preceding your operation.
</strong>
You don’t want to get a date and have it pushed back (for bureaucratic and emotional reasons), and you can’t be sure how it’ll affect your health going into the operation. I have been fortunate and haven’t experienced any long-COVID symptoms but I really recommend doing all you can to stay safe beforehand.
</p>
<p>
You should also generally try to follow the pre-operative instructions as closely as possible. They are very clearly written in French and  Google-translated into English but my pre-op nurse was very helpful in answering specific questions. My nurse would usually respond to my emails the same day, and a few times we scheduled calls when I had more questions than could neatly fit in an email. I have heard from the clinic itself that they’re planning on stopping the required three weeks of HRT sobriety before the operation, which should help a lot of people going forward. You’re not supposed to eat garlic but I ended up eating some of that garlic sauce from Boustan two days before the operation. Yum. Oops. It was fine.
</p>
<p>
Emotionally, take stock of your life. Prepare in the ways that only you can. I hacked every handheld video game console I’ve ever had and loaded them up with games that I never played in convalescence. I hiked regularly and meditated and read a lot of poetry. I found a song that I  decided was going to be my Surgery Song and I listened to it a million times. Prepare the room that you’re going to be dilating in for what will feel like the entire geological period. Scrub, wipe, and disinfect that space with the intensity and thoroughness of Ms. Clean—my headcanon’d trans girl version of Mr. Clean. Stock up on the supplies listed in the care booklet and also personal comfort items. It’s a great time to invest in a new stuffed animal or boyfriend body-pillow. Take a deep breath and shine, baby. You always do.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Montreal
</em>
</p>
<p>
My biggest general piece of advice for this surgery is to expect the worst and be pleasantly surprised when things aren’t as bad as you were expecting. I have pretty severe medical/hospital anxiety and I was
<em>
dreading
</em>
so much of the surgery. I was scared about the epidural and the  IV, about waking up halfway through the surgery since they don’t use a general anesthetic, and I was absolutely terrified of the blood drain and the catheter. None of these things were anywhere near as bad as I  was expecting. The epidural was a cold pinch, the IV was a bit painful but fine, and the removal of the blood drain was admittedly pretty uncomfortable but the nurse made the experience quite funny in retrospect by asking me who my favourite actor was and I was all anxious and babbling about wanting to smooch Oscar Isaac and oh—it’s over.
<em>
It’s done?
</em>
Yup.
</p>
<p>
I’m saying this because the worst part of my time at the clinic—without question—was my last day. The day before that I had had my catheter removed and was able to pee on my own for the first time, but I was also a little too eager with Mr. Orange the Terrifying Dilator that evening and unintentionally caused more swelling which meant I couldn’t pee the next day which meant I had to have the catheter reinstalled. Which wasn’t as fun as you might expect. And because I hadn’t really mentally prepared for it, I ended up crying inconsolably and the clinic had to bring in their emotional support staff member and it was a whole affair. For what it’s worth, the nurse told me this happens to about one patient each week, and they do three to four surgeries per day. My Friday the 13th moment. But this is why it’s best to mentally prepare for every worst-case scenario. Expecting to be awake for the surgery and being pleasantly surprised when you wake up to the nurse telling you “It’s done—the surgery was a success” is a great feeling.
</p>
<p>
The clinic itself is pretty nice. I didn’t experience anyone being rude to me and I only spoke English même si je parle un petit peu français. I  was really pleasantly surprised to learn that a few of my nurses were themselves trans—one of my favourite moments was chitchatting with my nurse who was just gushing about her t4t boyfriend while she changed my dressing on those first few days. For most of my stay, I was in a  private room with a pretty nice window overlooking the river and I’m fairly certain that this was just my good luck charm moment. The other rooms looked nice as well but it felt a little bit like I was at a  quaint boarding house or something.
</p>
<p>
That said, the vibe change from being in the hospital proper to being moved to l’Asclépiade was intense. In the hospital, you’re almost constantly being looked after and taken care of, but like a day later in Asclépiade you’re on your own to get your own water and schedule your own walks and generally take care of yourself. The nurses are there, and they’ll help you learn the ropes of taking care of your body now, but they do take a bit of a hands-off approach. I think some people don’t realize this and then think the nurses are being standoffish when they’re just doing their job. The reality is that as soon as you’re back home, you do have to take care of yourself, and I think Asclépiade is a bit of a  trial period for that. It’s kind of a masterclass in agency and independence—if you can handle filling your own water pitcher several times a day after bottom surgery then you can handle anything, haha.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Brassard himself is a bit of an enigmatic figure but I found him charming in the same way that you might find a dad who regularly posts Youtube videos about something he&#39;s really into. He can be a little bit off-putting and he’s clearly quite busy but the three or four times I talked with him were all memorable and made me feel comfortable. During my pre-op appointment, I asked him if we could get a selfie together and he happily obliged and now I have this incredible picture burning a hole through my phone at all times. I remember being quite anxious during that appointment and I was spinning around for some reason unable to find a place to sit and he was just like “Hey. Don’t be anxious. Sit down. Let’s chat.” I didn’t speak to the other surgeons there so I can’t attest to them.
</p>
<p>
<em>
My Vagina lol
</em>
</p>
<p>
It probably seems like I’ve been tiptoeing around this. I love my vagina and I’m extremely happy with my results. Do I have a “perfect”, like pornstar-esque coochie? Nope. Have I had some post-op complications that have slowed down my healing? Yup. Would I go back to GRS MTL again if I  was still pre-op? Absolutely. My bottom dysphoria was pretty bad but never dissociate-in-the-bathtub calibre crippling. Going into this surgery, I didn’t have any aesthetic hopes for my results. It was way more about just making sure I didn’t have that thing that was there before. I don’t want to seem high and mighty about people who might want  more defined labia minora or whatever, but I do think that vaginas are  as unique as faces and generally my mentality was “whatever I get is  what I get.” There is no perfect vagina. It’s wonderful that the government covers this surgery for clinics outside of Canada for people who do have specific aesthetic considerations but, if you’re in Canada and you just need this surgery done so you can move on with your life,  this is the best choice in my opinion. To me, the fact that I even have a  vagina at all is like…a divine miracle or something, like the advances in medical science and the body’s seemingly innate ability to just roll with the change is actually so beautiful that even just writing this, I’m like tearing up a lil bit.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had some hypergranulation tissue at the base of my canal, and a little bit of wound dehiscence. I’ve had one silver nitrate treatment and the next one is in a few days but even after one treatment, it looks a lot better. The swelling has gone down dramatically in these three months.  Of course, healing isn’t linear, but seeing the difference between my labia minora now and from when I first got back home is night and day.  You really do have to trust the process as much as possible in those weeks after getting home. It’s exhausting and boring and stressful and it can painful too, but it’s also an experience I’m grateful to have had—there’s a certain wisdom to be gained in this journey (there’s that word) that feels entirely unique. I’m truly in my Orlando: A Biography era.
</p>
<p>
Generally, at least in terms of dysphoria/euphoria, I’ve been equating this procedure with like, laser eye surgery. I had a specific problem beforehand that this surgery corrected. Now that the problem is resolved, I don’t suffer from it anymore. I forgot what “before” felt like after a few weeks. The main sources of post-op joy for me have come from being able to finally wear Lulu leggings and shorter skirts and cute undies and tight jeans and generally rediscovering my wardrobe. Another great feeling is just…sleeping and having my legs pressed together, it feels like how  I’ve always felt but without something in the way. It’s hard to describe that feeling but I imagine this crowd will pick up the vibe. Prepare to like your body a lot more. Prepare for other parts of your body that you do feel dysphoric about to take centre stage. I’m still pretty far from done with electrolysis and it’s occupying my brain way more than before. This isn’t a panacea—it’s a treatment for a specific anxiety.
</p>
<p>
I’ll briefly touch on sexual stuff too. TMI ahead. I can still orgasm, and the actual climax is very similar to how it was before i.e. not amazing for me personally but I think my problem is mental so consider my bias.  Clit stimulation doesn’t do a lot for me but I have one of those rabbit vibrators and canal vibrate-y stuff combined with kegels combined with the clit sensation I do have is like, bonkers. The freedom of being able to explore your body is beautiful and it feels a little like being a  teenager again and rediscovering that initial feeling of “oh this does that and that does this” but finally it’s just…right. Also, there’s still a lot of nerve damage at three months so I’m hoping that I develop a bit more sensation as the years start to pass and nerve connections reform. I haven’t had sex so I can’t speak to that. I don’t self-lubricate or anything but I do seem to get wet after an orgasm.
</p>
<p>
<em>
reddit, slander, malpractice— oh my!
</em>
</p>
<p>
I  was pretty scared to go with Dr. Brassard. Like you, I read the negative posts and I was terrified about ending up with a dead clit and a  sealed canal and necrosis and all the horror stories. I do not want to downplay or diminish the experiences of those who have had bad results from GRS MTL, that isn’t my intention here despite my cheeky facetiousness. The reality though is that the vaaaast majority of people getting this operation do not post on reddit afterwards regardless of the outcome. I personally almost didn’t. As I said earlier, they perform three or four surgeries a day. They also do other surgeries of course, but there’s like thousands and thousands of Brassard girlies out there. There’s nowhere even close to that posting about it seemingly anywhere online. I think if the odds of your surgery not working out were higher, we’d know about it. I trawled through this subreddit a lot beforehand and I saw like four or five accounts with bad experiences
<em>
tops
</em>
, and I never saw an actual picture of a bad result. Again, this isn’t to say bad results aren’t a possibility, and when I say “bad” I do mean like, in terms of your body’s ability to function, not purely aesthetically. This was also compounded by the fact that every person I  spoke to in real life who had the operation done absolutely glowed about it. To me, a girl who is certifiably Very Dumb and Not Good At Math,  after a great deal of number crunching, this all calculated out to: pretty good odds of getting great results so let’s go for it. So I went for it and now I have a vagina and I’m happy and I can go forth and find my dream lumberjack husband and live in a cute cabin in the mountains out west and sew my own dresses and with great pride and intensity, permanently delete reddit from my phone and generally just exist in the world as a girl that has a vagina. Sorry if this is overwritten lol it’s pretty late here. I’m sure I missed about a million things but feel free to ask questions and I’ll do my best to answer in the comments! love ya lots good luck shake a leg have fun love each other stay safe!!!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
tl;dr
</strong>
surgeon with decades of experience is pretty good, who knew?

Omg okay i didnt read yet but I was just thinking last night &#34;I wish there was another in depth guide to vaginoplasty on here&#34;!!! :D Gonna read it now
</p>
<p>
Edit: Thank you so much for this!! I love your writing style btw :)) It&#39;s quite similar to mine, it felt like I was reading my diary. I&#39;m currently in the process of getting my letters from professionals so that I&#39;m eligible. I still have a small bit before I can fully start the process but they told me I can open my file with them early so that once I get my HRT paper from endocrinologist, they can start the process quickly. I hope to get surgery by August or September too (knock on wood).

I’m glad it could help!!! we love a public diary entry 💕
</p>
<p>
My therapist wrote a beautiful, detailed letter about my Transgender Journey and my doctor wrote like two sentences saying he suggested me for the surgery. The clinic then turned down the letter from my doctor and I had to contact him again and ask him to rewrite it with a lil more meat on its bones lmfao. I’d keep this in mind at the stage you’re at :)

Great post and it aligns with my experience in Montreal.  My only criticism of the clinic is that I wish they were more proactive with mental health support.  A friend, who is a psychologist in Montreal, visited while I was there and it made me realize that there was a gap in delivery and post-op care there.  I had a good conversation with Dr. Laungani about it.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with finding your lumberjack, I recommend checking out Port Alberni for high numbers of them.  🙂🏳️‍⚧️

I very much agree with this. The mental health worker they had on site that came to talk to me when I had my catheter reinstalled was a little bit clumsy and ended up doing more harm than good in the moment. That might be more of a “sensitivity to being vulnerable with a new person” thing though.

Thank you for posting your experience at GRS Montreal.  I have my Video call next week with the nurse.  So excited.  You are right their scheduling is a little of a mystery.   I could have had my surgery by now, but put it off because I have FFS booked at the me of the month.  Looking to book for late April or May.  They have been great at accommodating friends of mine to fit into their schedules and needs.   Thanks again for your prospective of the whole process.

OMG thank you so much for this amazing✨ post!!! It will still be a couple years (or more 😢) before I’m able to get bottom surgery, but seeing as Montreal is virtually my only option this gave me a lot of hope (obviously there’s still a chance things go wrong, but knowing what to expect definitely lowers anxiety). I was literally crying when you were describing being able to wear cute tight clothing and whatnot. (Also I wish you luck in your hunt for your lucky lumberjack husband🥰)

Thank you for sharing your story. Your happiness and relief really come across. I was curious,
</p>
<p>
-Did you go into surgery with any particular expectations or goals about the results, did you discuss this with Brassard?
</p>
<p>
-what was the after care like? Do you feel like you can get in touch with the clinic if you need to? Do you feel assured that have everything you need know for your care?

No specific aesthetic expectations or goals, but I did talk with him about which complications are “normal” and kind of expected and we chatted about a few things specific to my body—I had a birthmark down there that they removed surgically and we talked about that.
</p>
<p>
They have been attentive with emails afterwards and they were the ones that told me I have hypergranulation after I sent them a picture. They sent me a bunch of documents I could show to my primary care provider to get silver nitrate treatment done. I’ve also had two phone calls with post-op nurses about the healing process and they were schedule pretty promptly. All things considered, not bad post-op treatment.
</p>
<p>
They make a little cute basket with supplies for you. It’s got some lube and your dilators and medical undies if I recall. You can’t take the basket (lol) but everything in there is yours. Most other things you have to supply yourself. Get lots of soap and find a good connection for lube. I get mine at a medical supply store cuz I want the Good Stuff, haha.

Thanks! I don&#39;t have the time to read it thoroughly yet, but I did a quick skim and this seems like a valuable resource for me.
</p>
<p>
I JUST got approval a week ago and I&#39;m waiting for Connect-Clinic to send my info the GRS Montreal (I have no idea what&#39;s taking so long). So I&#39;m right at the point where this info is super relevant.

Yeah but they&#39;re still processing the surgery referrals they sent before the closure. I already had someone reach out to tell me I was approved but to wait for them to let me know that the paperwork was sent to contact GRS and I&#39;m still waiting 😂

I actually just had mine with Languani so I feel that! But I’ve had no issues with dilation or anything and honestly even with me being fresh and about to head home tomorrow I feel great! I do wish they would see their handiwork before we leave though, if anything go make sure things are Okedoke. Like I’m personally okay but still

As someone who is currently on the waitlist at GRS Montreal (still working on hair removal down there, but hoping to be ready by the end of the year), I really appreciate your insight! It&#39;s certainly given me some peace of mind.

<p>
Please keep us updated!

This is super helpful, thanks for posting! I’m actually going to be having my consultation tomorrow so the timing is perfect! Do you have any things you’d recommend asking about in the consult?

I&#39;d recommend not stressing too much regarding like, coming up with a list of questions to ask them. You&#39;ll be able to stay in contact with them between now and your operation pretty regularly so anything you remember next week that you didn&#39;t ask today can still be answered. I remember the consult was a bit of an info-dump and the questions I asked were catered to my own medical history/personal comfort questions, that kind of thing.

Thank you so much for sharing! I’ll be accompanying my partner sometime this year so this is a great in depth guide.
</p>
<p>
A few questions if anyone wants to answer! ☺️ (We’re commuting from another province for surgery)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Did you have someone stay with you the whole time in Montreal? Visiting everyday? Would you have wanted daily company or were you pretty much passed out the whole time?
</li>
<li>
Was the care at Asclepiade enough to manage your own care? Or do you think you would have benefited from an extra person visiting everyday to help with daily tasks?
</li>
<li>
Transportation: post-op, did you drive/fly home? Which is recommended? (For example, we would have an 8hr drive versus a 1.5hr flight)
</li>
<li>
Any other recommendations for a support person? Was there anything specifically that helped your recovery from your support person?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thank you all so much! This community is such an amazing resource for everyone ☺️

I know its been 1 year since this post but for those who are looking for more up to date. Im 6 weeks post op and have pretty much word for word same as op experience. My only issues so far(knock on wood) are a little granulation and my urethra got blocked twice by the gauze(easy fix) and an infection from necrotic tissue.
