What is a skinny BBL?  Why get one instead of a normal BBL?  Who did your surgery? How much did it cost?
</p>
<p>
You look great!

Basically I didn‚Äôt have enough fat before surgery to get a normal bbl, but I had enough for the body feminization aspect so they took all my back and stomach fat that I had and put it in my thighs/upper buttox. Altogether I paid a little over 10k and went to Boston Medical Aesthetics however I do not recommend him after the incredibly terrible care I received post-op. They will try and charge you way more if they know you‚Äôre coming from the US but luckily my dad is a Mexican citizen so it was a little easier for us to negotiate. Hope this helps!

Thank you. Any chance of some more thigh pics as I want the same (most don‚Äôt get it and so their legs look weird as woman‚Äôs legs and too slender).
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm confused - BMC is in Boston USA but you said they‚Äôll try to charge you know if you‚Äôre coming from the USA and you were lucky as your dad us Mexican.

She said in an earlier post that her focus was on her hips not butt. I think she achieved exactly what she wanted.

This is amazing. You look great.
</p>
<p>
This is exactly what I need because I&#39;m to thin as well for a regular bbl.
</p>
<p>
How is the healing and comfort/feel of it all now?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for posting this.
</p>
<p>
I really want a bbl and body fem surgery. But there is so much about it being dangerous or not possible of your too thin.
</p>
<p>
I only way 115 pounds at 5&#39;8&#34;. So I thought I would have to deal with implants and I&#39;m not sure about that.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I also want a surgery that focuses on my legs and how wide my hips are. Another comment said that&#39;s what you had done. If so, what type is that?

Yeah I definitely understand your concern. I think if you‚Äôre looking for boobs implants are going to be your only option, but I love mine! All of my cis friends are jealous about how natural/perky they are haha. I got a fat transfer from my back and stomach to my thighs. It took about a month to no longer be in pain and then another month not to be uncomfortable anymore. It was really hard after surgery because I had like no fat left in my stomach or back and was extremely bruised from the lipo. I also flew 4 days after surgery which is EXTREMELY dangerous and I could have had major complications but it was an emergency situation. I couldn‚Äôt sleep on my side for 2 months which was the hardest part. In terms of sex I can have them squeezed and they feel completely natural.

How come you decided on the armpit incision? I want it, but many say it&#39;s not the best option. It looks great.
</p>
<p>
How long have you been on hormones? I think i might get BA before the 2 year mark!!

I started HRT in December of 2020 but that was just blockers. I didn‚Äôt get on estrogen until June of 2021 and got the surgery 6 months later. My surgeon almost never does this but I had already 50 grams of fat in each breast which was enough for the 350cc silicone implant.  I chose the armpit because it‚Äôs hidden 90% of the time and even when the scars aren‚Äôt hidden I‚Äôm proud of them!

That is why I want the armpit incision as well, but some claim the implants can move with that method, Also you picked the perfect size, these are the implants I want, as well.

You look amazing! BBL and BA together really give you the hourglass figure. Do you have tips for sleeping after both at same time?
