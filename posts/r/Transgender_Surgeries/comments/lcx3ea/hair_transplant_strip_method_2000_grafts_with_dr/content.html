Procedure didn&#39;t. The recovery is hurting like fuck though since they cut a solid strip of scalp off the back of my head. But I&#39;ll be fine in a couple of days and I&#39;ve got painkillers until then

So with the strip method it will leave a scar since they basically cut out a portion of my scalp to harvest the grafts from. It&#39;s sutured up now since I just had the surgery yesterday. From what all the docs I&#39;ve talked to have said the scar is visible if you have a buzz cut but with any longer hair nobody will ever know. FUE which is a different method doesn&#39;t leave a linear scar and is an easier recovery but it&#39;s more expensive and the extraction process is more traumatizing for the follicles so a few more of the grafts fail. If you want the densest result possible the strip method/FUT is better. It&#39;s also better if I want any future procedures done in like 10 years because the remaining part of the scalp on the back still has full hair density. FUE is better for smaller grafts or maybe just filling in a thin area.

Mine did, because I was a dumbass who was too stubborn to tell them when the anesthetic was wearing off. They realized it when they saw I had rivers of tears streaming down my cheeks and I couldn&#39;t talk =&gt;

She charges about $6. The strip method is cheaper than FUE and also better for some patients, like me, who want to better preserve the back of my head for any future transplants I might need in 10 or 20 years. The only downside is the recovery is a lot rougher for a couple of days

Sorry what is FUE?
</p>
<p>
Edit: let me google that myself-&gt;
</p>
<p>
Follicular Unit Extraction, also known as FUE Hair Transplantation involves the individual extraction of follicular units from the sides and back of the scalp. It is a very labor intensive procedure that allows the patient to keep their donor hair very short with no linear scar after the hair transplant procedure.
</p>
<p>
In traditional follicular unit hair transplantation (FUT) or “strip harvesting”, there is always a small linear scar where the hair is removed that is covered by the surrounding hair. If the patient later shaved their head or crop it very short the linear scar may be visible. This is not the case with FUE’s since every follicular unit is individually extracted leaving the donor area virtually scarless.

Yeah since this is very much a cosmetic procedure insurance is pretty unlikely to cover it most places. American trans healthcare is actually really great IF you have insurance AND you don&#39;t live in the middle of Arkansas or somewhere but this was all out of pocket for me. By far the most expensive thing I&#39;m likely to do as part of transition since I doubt I&#39;ll need FFS.

Nice! Be sure to follow their instructions to the letter, you wouldn&#39;t want to lose those grafts :)
</p>
<p>
I had mine about 6 months ago and the &#34;new&#34; hair is now about the length of your hairs on the side. Felt like the density was too low but it&#39;s actually just the difference in length that makes it noticable.

Hi FTM here and I had no idea or even thought about the fact that this is a procedure that would be done! Can I ask how last they long? Or is it permanent?

So most people who get this procedure done are cis men who want to get some hair back after male pattern baldness. I&#39;m AMAB and my hairline started receding pretty early and I really didn&#39;t crack my egg until last year. So doing this was one of my biggest sources of dysphoria and one of my first priorities so I can grow my hair out. My hair isn&#39;t quite as bad as this pic makes it look since it&#39;s all combed straight back in the pic which isn&#39;t how I ever styled it.
</p>
<p>
To your question- the transplants are permanent. The hairs on the back of your head don&#39;t have the androgen receptors that make the hair on the top of your head vulnerable to male pattern baldness. So once these hairs are transplanted, they&#39;re there to stay. They might thin with age just like cis women&#39;s hair thins some with age but they won&#39;t be vulnerable to male pattern baldness.
</p>
<p>
The only caveat here is that if you get a transplant done, the transplanted hairs will stick around, but the ones behind it might not! So if you&#39;re on T and it&#39;s causing your hairline to recede, you want to make sure your hairline has stabilized before doing this. Or you just end up having a touch-up done in a few years, depending on how much good donor hair is on the back of your head. Since I&#39;m on estrogen now, I&#39;m not likely to lose any more hair to male pattern baldness.

I got mine 2 months ago, 1500. Impatiently waiting for results now.... Glad at least i don&#39;t have to be paranoid about touching them any more. Was weird when they all fell out.
</p>
<p>
When I was getting them done was pretty surreal as I was high and half sedated and vomiting blood from a rhinoplasty... Good times.

It continues. I had quite a lot done, and have asymetric swelling around my jaw particularly. Hopefully that will continue to reduce. Things look quite different than they did a month ago.
</p>
<p>
As for the transplants, the area is still red but hairs are starting to poke through!

This is great and I&#39;m happy that you had a successful procedure. I have a hairline that is similar to how you started so I&#39;m definitely looking at getting some transplants as well in the future. How long did the entire process take and were you awake at the time?

It was a full day, about 8 hours. Local anesthetic was enough to keep anything from hurting during. They gave me a xanax before starting tho so I probably napped through half of it haha. The recovery pain is a bitch but the procedure itself was pretty easy.

About $12K for 2000 grafts, about the middle of the road for price quotes I got. I liked Dr. Houssock a lot. Of the four docs I consulted with she was the only one who really met with me for a good 30-40 minutes to discuss what I wanted and how the procedure would work. She&#39;s also worked on a lot of trans patients relative to most docs who do this. I was a little nervous simply because of the fact that their clinic does a lot of other procedures in addition to hair, but it does seem like hair is a pretty big portion of their business. She can do top surgery and FFS too but I&#39;m only 2 months on hormones so it&#39;s still too early to think about that. She called me herself the day before the procedure to go over prep with me and ask if I had any questions. The day of (yesterday) all of the staff were super kind and really put me at ease. The procedure itself was really pretty easy and painless but recovery hurts like shit since I did the strip method rather than FUE.  Since they work with a lot of trans clients they&#39;re all super gender-affirming and it was nice to be asked what pronouns I used, even though I&#39;m still boymoding and using he/him outwardly for now. It was a refreshing contrast since obviously most people who do this procedure are cis men and most docs have done a few on trans clients but I think Dr. Houssock has done over 150 on trans women. I can&#39;t speak to the results of the procedure for another six months of or so of course but overall working with her was a really positive experience and I&#39;d definitely recommend them for the processionalism and standard of patient interaction.

That’s great information! By any chance did you meet with Dr. Scheiber? Dr Vogel/Housak were also recommended to me by a friend who loved their work. So if that’s an indication you should be great!
</p>
<p>
Being in the general Baltimore/Philly area would you recommend any of the others

I didn&#39;t. I think Dr. Vogel is actually retired so it&#39;s just Dr. Houssock running the practice now. My other consults were with Dr. William Lindsey who seemed like he definitely knew what he was doing but was also kind of an asshole, and another Dr. whose name I&#39;m forgetting now but who was booked through June and was more expensive. I&#39;m in the DC area so Baltimore was about my northern limit for searching.

Thanks so much again. I’m in PA so trying to keep the Philly/Bal area as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
BTW. As it grows use a Biotin based shampoo and possibly supplements to strengthen hair. Also consider asking your doc for a Finesteride script to go along with your HRT. You want to keep DHT at a minimum. I was straight bald and regained much of my hair over the past 2 years. Still need a procedure to fix the hair line. My temples are recessed similar to yours but the crown came back nicely.

That&#39;s great! I&#39;m amazed at the results some women can get with their hair on E. I hope I didn&#39;t jump the gun on getting the procedure done now but I&#39;m not sure I can wait a year plus to start growing my hair. I&#39;ve been on Fin for a couple of years and it definitely slowed it all way down. I&#39;m not doing spiro, just E, so will have to watch, hopefully I&#39;ll get adequate testosterone suppression from just that, it seems like most people do.

I went all in.... Microneedling, supplemts, etc... I regained my natural male hairline which, like you, included temple recession. I did note that when adding progesterone I saw a general thickening. Something you may want to consider as a weak AA to help.

Give it time. You got this... you’ll look awesome. I saw her results first hand on a cis woman and they were amazing. If you ever want specific details on products DM me.

Did you also have transplants to thicken up the middle part?

I know this is 5 months old but I&#39;ve been watching to see how this goes. I have a quote from a consult and very seriously thinking to do this. How do you feel now and how are the grafts holding up?  Any recommendations on things you wish you&#39;d have considered with getting this done?
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

Five months in- I&#39;m not near seeing the full effect yet so it&#39;s hard to say. Not all of the hair shed after transplanting, although most did, so theres some long wispy bits in the transplanted area, and the rest is just starting to come in. It&#39;s still thin- too thin to style or make a difference in how I can style my hair, which is a bummer, I&#39;d like to do proper parts rather than something that still feels a bit like a combover. My hair is still also a very male length so it&#39;s hard to say what will change from getting it longer. What I CAN tell is that my scalp isn&#39;t very visible on the transplanted sites now. The effect is to blur my hairline so there&#39;s no longer an obvious &#34;M&#34; shape, which is a very good start to pulling off a more androgynous look for now.
</p>
<p>
Tl;Dr if this is all I get I&#39;m going to be disappointed, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m even very close to seeing the full effect yet- that can take up to a year and a half for cis men, and it will probably take longer for me just because I&#39;m trying to grow it long. I&#39;m still seeing a lot of progress every month and I&#39;m optimistic about how to turned out.
</p>
<p>
When I was searching for surgeons, most of the good ones seemed about the same in terms of price and what they recommended in terms of what I do. I paid probably 10% more than I could have because I wanted to go with someone who made me feel comfortable, and mine had a fair bit of experience working with transfemmes. The surgery itself was a really positive experience. Pain lasted 3-4 days before tapering off pretty quick, I took a few of the codeine pills to deal with it even though they always make me feel icky. But the healing was pretty straightforward, even though I could tell it took 2-3 months for the wound to FULLY close up, my wife said she couldn&#39;t even find the scar when she was looking for it after the second week.
</p>
<p>
Also, the top of my scalp was pretty numb for a month or two, apparently that&#39;s normal and it went away.

Thank you so much for the writeup!  I liked hearing the part about how it blurts the hairline at this point. I ha e baby hairs that won&#39;t grow - blonde - in that area and I&#39;ve been half tempted to color them dark to get that blended look but I dont think there&#39;s enough for that to work.
</p>
<p>
My quote is 3k grafts for $12k - was referred to him by my gcs surgeon as our areas best option, although I cant find anything on reddit about them. I felt comfortable with him and he seems to have worked with several transgender folk before.  Im working on my ffs first I think (really want that and my ba one this year as I just met my insurance deductible and my dr for those two said my insurance will cover them - hoping to do them while having met that deductible!)

That&#39;s not a terrible quote at all, at least not where I am. Good luck! For me this was the first thing I wanted done, my hair has been so important to me my whole life and I&#39;m looking forward to being able to grow it out and feel confident
