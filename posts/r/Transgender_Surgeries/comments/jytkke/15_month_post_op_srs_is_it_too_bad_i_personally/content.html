It doesnt look botched at all. Just looks like scar mis coloring which can and usually does go away with time. And other then the miss coloring it looks like a great result.

I agree. I also think there’s still more swelling than OP realizes.

I&#39;ve never seen the miscoloring go away on any timeline, do you have any examples of that happening? it settles down with healing, sure, but it doesn&#39;t suddenly gain a smooth gradient

I dont have anything but personal anecdotes about scar fading. My scars usually are very mis colored when the first develop then slowly change and fade over time.

How has your recovery been so far? Who was your surgeon? (only if you want to name it), it looks good to have a month, it is a good result and when it is fully healed it will look good, and if you do not feel well you can undergo a labiaplasty or a medical tattoo, just give it time to heal.

The mottled coloration seems unusual.  Apart from that it looks great, entirely nominal+ at least.  It&#39;s not &#34;botching&#34; if this is what it is, but a small and random number of people will be &#34;tattooed&#34; internally by blood/bruising breakdown products.  Very rare and the surgeon has no control over it.  I think there is a laser treatment that can break down the pigments trapped in the skin.  It&#39;s also very early still, no reason to worry about it yet.  Seriously 6 months to  year out you&#39;ll know, and even if the coloration remains, it&#39;s a fixable issue and  a matter of bad luck, not botching.

If you are talking about pink area on the left, that looks like that because i had an infection in the skin

Actually referring to the darker vs lighter areas, didn&#39;t notice any pinkness.  If the original skin was darker, then it&#39;s definitely just fine how it is by me.

<p>
I&#39;m not you, if something is wrong, it&#39;s wrong.  Everything I&#39;ve read says it will take 6 to 12 months to fully heal.

It doesn&#39;t look botched. It looks swollen and is still healing. It takes a least a year before you can get final results. Perhaps aesthetically, it may not be what you want right now, but that can be corrected.

Hun, it looks great. I&#39;ve seen far, far worse, and yours is one most transwomen I know would want. Just give it time for your bruising to go away and your body&#39;s chemicals to realign, a surgery like that can really put a body out of whack for awhile

I gave you upvote because I am unsure too and its annoying to see people giving downvote when u give ur opinion which is &#34;not positive&#34; for the result. The one that attacked you with downvote should seek psychiatrist help to check if his reactions are normal. I never gave anyone downvote except when someone was hating really hard or similar situation
</p>
<p>
Edit: Sometimes saying lies to comfort someone won&#39;t give good outcome at the end and she might experience mental breakdown if someone whos cis forms opinion like me.

I&#39;m sure people are downvoting for the same reason I did, because they disagree with the comment. Which is what downvoting is for.  Personally, I don&#39;t think the results look unusual or botched. There is some discoloration that is mostly due to the fact that it isn&#39;t fully healed and will most likely go away with time. Even if it doesn&#39;t, plenty of cis women have dark labia. Overall, I think the results are really good.

This is old but it&#39;s a misconception that downvoting means you disagree with the comment and it&#39;s a huge problem with reddit in general. The down vote button has never meant disagreement, it&#39;s supposed to be for weeding out things that are IRRELEVANT to the conversation at hand. Therefore I don&#39;t think the comments above are being downvoted fairly.

Give it time. For one and a half month I&#39;d say it looks okay. Not necessarily great, of course, but extensive surgery like that takes time to recover.

Hi :)  Of course, I am no surgeon, but from what I see, you are still very swollen. And it is perfectly normal after s such short period of time. I don’t see any visible complication, you seem to heal well and your clitoral hood already looks pretty nice! Give it time. If you stick to your post op routine, in a few month, it should look amazing. One piece of advice : take a picture everyday. When you will look back, you will be see how much it changed for the better.
</p>
<p>
Also, if you are not sure about your results, don’t hesitate to send pictures to your clinic. I don’t know what their post op care  is but they should be able to reassure you and be able to say if something needs their immediate attention or not.
</p>
<p>
Take care! You are doing fine :)

Give it time to totally heal and it will look fine. 6 weeks is not lone enough to heal and recover from SRS.

This is definitely botched. Your surgeon has literally left you with just a line, it doesn’t look like you have a labia or vestibule.

No problem. Your comment was helpful. I gave you a flair.

The discolouration isn&#39;t great but there are ways to solve that, from getting the surrounding color tattooed onto the lighter skin or the skin lightened all together. There is definitely a lack of outer labia but that could be somewhat due to swelling. I can&#39;t speak for the internal workings but the clit area and vaginal entrance looks good.

I think this may not have been exactly what you were hoping for but I feel that all the cosmetic changes that may need to be made can still be done. Even if you have smaller lips, they can be created.

<p>
Don&#39;t fall into despair, just heal up for a year and re-evaluate your options. I&#39;ve seen botched and this is not it. The results look good except the pigmentation and lack of labia majora which can both be fixed when it&#39;s fully healed.

I think it looks good considering the time frame.

Too early.  Plus botched would be dealing with the more functional aspects.

It’s too early babe. You’re still healing. Wait until after month 6 to month 7 to start thinking of revisions
