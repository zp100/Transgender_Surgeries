That really is the dream we all have though right. A nice romantic bath with our lady bits. Maybe some nice music....realizing that we made it.
</p>
<p>
Q) so any other surgeries on the horizon? Bbl ?

Congratulations! Your journey has definitely calmed some of my anxieties about getting zero-depth. Just one question, would you say it’s easier to orgasm now with the canal or is it just a different way than before?

It is many times easier with the canal!  Also I recommend not doing zero depth if you have any questions or doubts.  If you think its worth just adding later, you need to do it up front.  There can be complications and it has a chance of coming out not so well being added later.  Plus - there should be a lot more feeling having it added up front!
</p>
<p>
However, if there are reasons you must go that route then it is a good route to go.  It does relieve dysphoria ( at least for me ) by a huge amount!  But it left me needing more.

Thanks for the advice. My main reason for zero depth is my inability to keep up with dilations; I’d rather not risk having it close up and have complications that way. I’m sure I’ll miss having the full experience but I don’t see it as practical for me yet.
</p>
<p>
I hope you figure out the minor issues you’ve shared, and good luck with continued recovery!

I personally think the inability to keep up with them isn&#39;t really an issue. I&#39;m still less than a year out from the canal addition and I dilate once a week at this point. However, it is important at first for sure, keeping up to a good degree with the schedule.  However, I missed a LOT of sessions. I&#39;m a busy IT Executive, so my job has kept me from the schedule.  However I&#39;ve had no issues keeping it open and to depth.  I just had my last rehab session for pelvic floor therapy and she said I am perfect down there.  She said provided I dilate once a week, or have sex once a week, there is no need to do anything further.

Just to share my thougths on this. I just had minimal depth with Dr Chettawut 3 weeks ago. I am asexual and not interested in penetrative sex at all. Also very worried about dilation and associated complications. Have a very realistic expectation for surgery and not obsessed with anatomical completeness. I don&#39;t have the motivation for dilation, so the huge time commitment makes no sense to me, as I will not use it anyway. If full-septh, maintenance time will be longer than actual use time, which is meaningless. A full depth canal to me is just to please a hypothetical non-asexual partner,  but it will never be important to me. I&#39;ve never had any sexual partner and I&#39;m not keen on finding one. Happy to be single lifetime.

I had a zero depth and I&#39;m considering adding a canal in the second surgery. How does this recovery compare to the first recovery?

Its a bit harder to be honest.  More of a struggle to get back into moving than it was with zero depth. It seemed to take longer to get back to full speed than zero depth. I was off 6 weeks both times - the zero depth, I felt like I could go back to work around week 4. With the canal addition, 6 weeks felt too short!
</p>
<p>
Overall though it wasn&#39;t bad. I didn&#39;t have a lot of pain save for the first few days after surgery, in the hospital. Since I had abdominal skin graft, it was quite difficult to simply move, let alone getting up out of bed!  With zero depth, I could get out of bed same day but they requested that you don&#39;t.

I&#39;m curious why you had a revision to add a canal.  Right now I&#39;m leaning towards zero depth and I&#39;m always curious why people get revisions to add canals, just so I don&#39;t have to go through it twice 😅.  Sorry if this is personal, you don&#39;t have to answer.

Not at all - happy to help.
</p>
<p>
I had no want or desire for a canal from the start of this process. It wasn&#39;t necessary as I&#39;m a lesbian. However, the drastic reduction of dysphoria had me wanting something more after the zero depth. I ended up needing to do the canal for myself to feel both complete and to try and achieve sexual things (toys, vibratory, my fingers, etc.)  So I went for the canal and have no regrets doing so. My I ly regret overall is I should have had the canal done up front.
</p>
<p>
My recommendations - If you have ANY questions AT ALL, get the canal from the start. If you don&#39;t and end up needing it, it could cost you a LOT of mo ey as well as downtime.

I do not think its a good idea, even if money isn&#39;t a problem. You will regret it if you are thinking it will save you time. Downtime for both is the same. Recovery for both is about the same. The only real difference is dilating afterwards. And to be honest, dilating isn&#39;t that bad. The first few months you really gotta keep up with it pretty rigorously.   I&#39;m 10 months from having surgery and I do it once, maybe twice a week at this point.
</p>
<p>
Why risk having to pay out of pocket for a 2nd procedure just to save potential time?  Instead of 6 weeks down, now you are 12 weeks (zero depth was 6 weeks recovery and canal addition was another 6 weeks recovery)  I was fortunate and got my insurance to pay for the 2nd surgery but not without a lot of stressful fighting too.  Also your doubling your risks by having two surgeries. And then, if your surgeon isn&#39;t close to home like mine is, you have another trip involved as well.
</p>
<p>
I do NOT recommend having zero depth and planning on canal addition later. If you feel you want the canal at any point, then you truly need to do this all at once.
</p>
<p>
If you are wanting zero depth, you need to be absolutely sure you don&#39;t want a canal. The risk of not being able to have it added later, the risk to your health for another surgery, the risk of having to pay out of pocket, etc. Is all there.

Who was your surgeon? I&#39;m going to have this exact surgery done too. I had zero depth vulvoplasty due to the given time off from the last job I had before the covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
I know in the future I definitely want my vagina, but didn’t expect this pandemic to last as long as it has so far. I am planning on having my vaginoplasty done as soon as I can, this time with the vaginal canal.
</p>
<p>
I will be having the surgery at Kaiser West LA Hospital with Dr. Melissa Poh. 😊Did anyone of you had surgery through her?
</p>
<p>
I had my vulvoplasty done at OHSU Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon with Dr. Daniel D. Dugi III in October 2019. I live, work in Hawai’i and was allowed to fly back in December just three months before Covid Pandemic arrived.
