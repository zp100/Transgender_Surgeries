I had vaginoplasty 4 months ago now and I haven&#39;t stopped bleeding still. A month ago my nurse at my bottom surgeons office told me I could see my GP about it, so I did, and with the equipment they had there they couldn&#39;t tell me what was wrong. They gave me a referral to a gynecologist who I saw yesterday, and told what was happening, and how I&#39;m 99% sure it&#39;s due to excess granulation tissue. And I told him that at this point I shouldn&#39;t still be bleeding, at least as much as I am. He basically said &#34;I don&#39;t know what is normal or not, talk to your bottom surgeon&#34; and he didn&#39;t even bother to take a look at. I emailed the nurse I&#39;m in contact with at my bottom surgeon office and I&#39;m waiting to hear back, but I&#39;m frustrated and looking for advice from anyone who&#39;s had the same problem.
</p>
<p>
I am almost certain that it&#39;s due to granulation tissue, because I can feel it when I put a finger inside, and sometimes I&#39;ll have a little piece of granulation tissue come out. I&#39;m currently dilating 2x/day and when I miss one the next one will be a LOT more painful and a lot more bloody. So like I said any advice from anyone who&#39;s been in a similar situation would be great, and possibly any advice on how to get a gynecologist to actually see me and take me seriously would be great too.

I feel your pain and frustration.   Trans people are uncommon.  Your pcp and gyn probably havelittle to noexperience with this.  Find a pcp with other transwomen in their practice. Go there

Attempt to get another referral to a different gynecologist and request them to take a look inside of your canal to see if there&#39;s severe granulation tissue. Don&#39;t bring up if you think its normal or not, just say your GP recommended a checkup to see if there is severe granulation tissue in the canal. They probably haven&#39;t worked with a neovagina before but seeing if there&#39;s granulation tissue in the canal shouldn&#39;t be a difficult process.

Maybe you can see if there&#39;s a local surgeon that performs GRS and would be willing to treat granulation? It&#39;s usually pretty simple to treat if they know what they are doing.

I&#39;m on the 5 and half month mark, and sabe situation like you. Obgyn won&#39;t take a sprculum and see what&#39;s there. They refuse again and again. Bleeding every Dilating session 2x a day. My surgeon told me &#34;we can control it&#34; but didn&#39;t said anything much. He expects i message saying &#34; I&#39;m bleeding twice than before&#34; or something.
</p>
<p>
I feel worried and scared because they won&#39;t touch there to see what i have! I live alone,  no family and friends don&#39;t know what to do for me. Hope the best for you and everyone having to face rejection from medical services :(

I&#39;ve talked with a nurse at my bottom surgeons office and she waid that she&#39;d talk to the doctor about starting on a steroid cream that might help. You could talk to your doctor that, see if he will start you on that. I hope the best for you, hopefully both of us won&#39;t have to deal with this for much longer

I didn&#39;t have much granulation tissue, but I had it removed like 5 times in follow-up appointments. You&#39;re probably right about what&#39;s happening &amp; you just need to call lots of places and see who will treat it with silver nitrate. Make multiple appointments with multiple doctors &amp; cancel  the remaining appointments when you get a doctor or nurse practitioner (more often get-stuff-done types) that actually treats you.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not going to get better on its own.

and

might be some resources. Talk it through with your med persons in case.
</p>
<p>
And looking for local med people who are experienced with trans people may also be recommendable. Asking at lgbt places or support groups for a referral may be a good idea.
