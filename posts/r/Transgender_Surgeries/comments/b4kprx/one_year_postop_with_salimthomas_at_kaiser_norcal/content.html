A year ago today I underwent SRS with Drs. Ari Salim and Carl Thomas of Kaiser Permanente San Francisco. I&#34;m going to try and capture some thoughts about my experiences in the last year. (FYI, I use the term
<strong>
pussy
</strong>
now and then, I don&#39;t know if that bothers some folk.)
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Decision---
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Leading up to the surgery I had a lot of back and forth and worry about whether this was a good idea and was right for me. I had begun my transition less than two years before, so this felt fast. At Kaiser there is this pipeline effect. You get in the system, it goes well and they ask you what else you want. I hadn&#39;t considered FFS but they offered it and it turned out great. Then the question was SRS. After the 2016 election I had serious concerns how long I would have Obamacare insurance available to cover this stuff so I accelerated things pretty seriously. So I had the consult and got on the waiting list, figuring well, let&#39;s get in line and think about it. I was given a date nine months away so that was fine.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d never been especially dysphoric about my genitals in the way some trans people describe, so I questioned whether it was something I &#34;should&#34; do. However, I found over time in transition that they were increasingly incongruous and frustrating to me. The effects of HRT on sexual functioning were such that I came to believe I&#39;d be better off in the long run having SRS. I was %1000 percent sure I had made the right choice in transitioning and if I was going to live like this forever then I said, &#34;Let&#39;s take these genitals and turn them into something I can work with&#34;. From what I understood, reconfiguring the nerves and tissues would lead to better sexual pleasure and a sexual experience closer to what I desired. At this point my primary sex partners are cis men and I wanted penetrative intimacy in my genitals. I could easily imagine the sensation and I felt like my body was asking for the change.
</p>
<p>
So I wanted it but then had to contend with the stories of complications and difficulties. As you know, there are many dramatic stories and SRS can sound like a real nightmare in some cases. I had several friends who had long uncomfortable recoveries due to granulation issues, excessive swelling, and in two cases having to surgically re-open a vagina that had closed up due to poor dilation as a result of painful healing.  To make matters worse a friend had recently surgery with a different Kaiser surgeon supervised by Dr. Salim and had a really rough recovery, so this was all very much on my mind. I couldn&#39;t afford to be miserable and in pain for a year and the idea of living with regrets for a lifetime was awful.
</p>
<p>
I drove myself crazy with this in the two-three months before surgery, having lots of circular conversations with friends, writing and meditating on it, attending support groups, thinking it out. I was worried that I wasn&#39;t excited enough. People would say, &#34;Oh! Congratulations! You must be excited!&#34; and I&#39;m like, &#34;No, I&#39;m terrified I&#39;m making the wrong decision, but thanks...&#34;
</p>
<p>
I came up this this metaphor.
<strong>
&#34;SRS is like taking a trip to Paris for the first time. Everyone tells me it&#39;s amazing, but it&#39;s a really long, hard uncomfortable journey and I won&#39;t know if I like it until I actually get there!&#34;
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Finally, I made the decision to have faith. Dr. Salim was supremely confident and very talented. Because of Kaiser&#39;s privacy policies there isn&#39;t much online about Salim/Thomas, but I had heard 95% great stuff from other patients here. So about three weeks before surgery I simply decided everything was going to BE FINE and that&#39;s what I went with. So when I showed up for surgery the last thing I said to Doctor Slim was &#34;You are going to make mine the best vagina you&#39;ve ever made! You&#39;re going to brag about it at cocktail parties and show it off at conferences!&#34; He laughed and said. &#34;I&#39;ll do my best&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Going into this surgery with a massively positive mindset is no guarantee of positive results, but it can&#39;t hurt. Healing is a mental and spiritual process as much as a physical experience.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not going to go through the whole play by play. There&#39;s lots of that out there, you can ask questions if you like.  I had a boyfriend at the time and he was amazing in helping me get to the hospital and being helpful afterwards, although I sent him away fairly quickly. I spent a week in the hospital and found that I really only wanted the nurses at a certain point. I was uncomfortable and irritable and just wanted to rest and have the professionals take care of me. Friends visited but I kept that minimal. That first week is weird, because you are on lots of pain meds, you are attached to a catheter bag, you can&#39;t see what&#39;s going on down there because it&#39;s all wrapped up and sewn together. I think my main takeaway was that waking up after SRS was fine and I didn&#39;t have that &#34;OMG what have I done&#34; reaction I sort of feared.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, there were no complications.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the week they come up and remove the stitches holding the labia together, then remove all the packing inside the vagina. Huge relief. The pressure inside the abdomen is intense, especially combined with the constipation from the drugs. They immediately do the first dilation, coaching you through it using the smallest dilator. Not as bad as I feared because you&#39;ve just recently been stuffed with gauze, so it gets harder after as the swelling takes it&#39;s course. Once you have your first successful pee they can send you home. A friend of mine showed me the accupressure point on the outside of the little toe to trigger urination, and that worked fine.
</p>
<p>
I will never forget the relief I experienced at the unveiling. All things considered, I thought it looked
<strong>
fucking great
</strong>
and I was pleased that I felt so bright and happy. I have a video of my reaction after, and in it I look so happy and I simply say &#34;It&#39;s good! It&#39;s really, really good.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Home
</strong>
</p>
<p>
So I was released at 4pm. Turned out to be scary because we immediately got stuck in rush hour traffic and I&#39;m lying in the passenger seat praying that my first pee outside the hospital isn&#39;t in a gas station or the break down lane on the Bay Bridge! But I made it home fine. Whew.
</p>
<p>
I had people around the first few days and the boyfriend was helpful for the first week or so. I am a fairly self-sufficient person and a bit of an introvert, so I was solo at home fairly quickly, but had people stop by every day to help with chores, food, and emotional support. I could move around by myself slowly, I had a comode chair for the toilet with was a life-saver. Having armrests to support you while you use the toilet was really helpful. Then mostly spending time in bed and of course dilating.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dilation
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The first few weeks of dilating were pretty tough. It&#39;s like pushing a baseball bat through a wall of meat., The tissues are really tender and swollen and the muscles are trying to close up when you are training them to be open. But I was very determined and after SRS dilation is your
<strong>
ONLY JOB. Do not fuck around!
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
The surgeons give you a vagina. It&#39;s YOUR job to turn it into a pussy.
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
So I pushed to full depth every time, and if it took 15 minutes and a lot of moaning, chanting and praying to get there, so be it. After a week I was on the second size as prescribed and within 6 weeks I was on the largest orange dilator at full depth. I would say dilation was only
<strong>
painful
</strong>
the first 2 weeks and then it wasn&#39;t until maybe five months that it stopped being
<strong>
uncomfortable
</strong>
. After that, to be honest, I enjoyed it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
How&#39;s It Look?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Great! I had swollen labia for a couple months, but really not too bad. The area around the clitoris kind of had to grow new skin, so it was pretty messy for awhile, but not bad. I had a few incision points here and there that were raw and healing but mostly I did fine. If we have learned anything in the FOUR major surgeries this year (FFS, SRS, Facelift/BA and SRS revision) my body heals very well. I think that&#39;s important to remember, some bodies handle this differently.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetically, there were some surprises. Doctor Salim&#39;s technique preserves as much of the glans as possible, and you can really see it. There&#39;s a small clitoral bump that he creates and then under that there is, in my case, a mass of tissue about the size and shape of the tip of my index finger and that is the rest of the clitoris which is formed with the outer rim of the head of the penis. I worried about this a lot because I do this it&#39;s unusual and you don&#39;t see that in most cis vaginas. At rest it is covered by the labia minora, but when you spread it open there&#39;s definitely this structure there that I can recognize as the former head of my cock.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not posting pictures but I did a drawing of the structure so you can see what I&#39;m talking about.

</p>
<p>
<strong>
Did you say Revision?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes. I did have a revision mainly to reduce the length of the urethra. Everything worked well with urination, but the urethra was too prominent for me. There is still erectile tissue surrounding it and it does get erect when aroused. So we reduced it by about 1/4 inch, which was better, but it&#39;s still something I&#39;m aware of then aroused. It&#39;s especially irritating if a partner confuses it for the clitoris.
</p>
<p>
The revision also involved some cosmetic labiaplasty, including tightening the clitoral hood and labia minora  to better surround the glans structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Orgasms
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had my first manual orgasm about six weeks after surgery. That was a huge relief. In the months since I have learned more about how I work and as things healed up it did change and evolve. My general takeaway is it&#39;s awesome. Taking all those nerves and bundling them together inside the body makes for a new orgasmic experience for sure. It&#39;s much better than what I was experiencing with an HRT affected penis. How does it compare to a penis on testosterone? Hard to say. I feel like for me the clitoris and vagina is more satisfying and pleasurable, but there&#39;s no doubt that the original genitals worked very well as they were designed. The human penis is a very efficient and straight-forward thing.
</p>
<p>
Orgasms can be elusive and tricky for all women, and for me that is the case. I have yet to orgasm with a partner. I enjoy sex with partners and feel a lot of pleasurable sensations but I can still only orgasmically climax when I am alone. But that&#39;s similar to how I&#39;ve always been. Masturbation is for me, and sex with another tends to focus on them. That&#39;s how I&#39;m wired.
</p>
<p>
However, I am at the point now where I can get myself off within five or ten minutes. All I need are my fingers and a good nasty Tumblr blog (what&#39;s left of it) and I&#39;m good to go. I&#39;m still learning. I have yet to have those sort of long amazing body convulsing orgasms some women describe. I was never really great at getting pleasure from the prostate and I think that&#39;s where the magic really happens. You have much more direct access to the prostate through the vagina and there are times when the combination of penetration and clitoral stimulation are really really good and I can see where the orgasm might come from, but it still eludes me. I use a Magic-Wand sometimes and that can be good, but honestly my best results are with my hands on the clitoris and sometimes a dilator inside.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Reaction from partners
</strong>
</p>
<p>
No complaints. Guys seem happy to see it and excited to play with it. So much so that sometimes it makes me feel weird. Like, they expect you to react the same way as cis women, so they do whatever their go-to move is and so far nothing has really connected with me. A little oral sex is nice, but I get irritated and bored after awhile.
</p>
<p>
Penetration is great. I have 6 to 61/2 inches of depth and that&#39;s fine for most. Some guys have expressed frustration at reaching that back wall and not being able to go as deep as they are used to. You adjust. I find that cowgirl position is best for me, it put less pressure on my body.
</p>
<p>
I always have to do a bit of a dilation first. I worried I&#39;d have to do 20 minutes, but really just a minute or two with the big orange dilator and I&#39;m good to go. A year into this and I experience no more discomfort from penetration.
</p>
<p>
I waited six months to have penetrative sex. That&#39;s what the doctor&#39;s advised (although they were surprised I followed the advice, haha). I think you really have to accept that this is a process. The first few times I had sex I viewed it entirely as an experiment. I didn&#39;t worry about much about pleasure or orgasm or whatever. Just see what it&#39;s like, what works, etc. My first partners were people I had no attachment with. Just guys I met who seemed to be responsive, caring, guys who could follow instructions and work with you. For me that was the right choice. Later, I had more romantic sex with someone I cared about and it was superior for sure, but I&#39;m glad i didn&#39;t have romantic or emotional entanglements with my first few partners.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dating
</strong>
</p>
<p>
While I &#34;pass&#34; I don&#39;t consider myself to be a candidate for full stealth, so on my online dating profiles I am upfront that I am a post-op transwoman. It&#39;s irritating to disclose that much information, but I hate having disclosure conversations with guys who want pre or non op transwomen. I will say that some of the meanest and most transphobic things that have EVER been said to me were said in relation to SRS. It&#39;s rare, but when you run across someone who is truly bothered by it they will really let you know it. That&#39;s why I would never attempt stealth, because the negative reactions can be intense. I won&#39;t even have a
<em>
cup of coffee
</em>
with you unless I know you are cool with SRS ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think having the surgery makes you more attractive to the majority of straight cis men. Most of them are weirded out and phobic in general and having a surgical pussy makes no difference. In a way it makes it harder because (it seems like) most trans-amorous guys (not to mention chasers and fetishists) are famously in it for the full chick-with-a-dick experience. I think that cliche is a bit over-stated, though. I&#39;ve had plenty of interest for sure, although I don&#39;t want to be on anyone&#39;s sexual bucket list. And the rude and disgusting things men say about pussies is really shocking, particularly when it&#39;s your pussy they are talking about.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think anyone should do this to try and please any man. This is about you and your body and how you want to spend the rest of your life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Finally
</strong>
</p>
<p>
In general, this reinforced my identity as a woman way more than I ever anticipated. It&#39;s much more than reconfiguring nerves and tissue. I think it&#39;s a deeply transformative experience and I feel very much like I have been placed in a new body. Interestingly, I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted breast augmentation until after SRS. I immediately felt like I needed to improve my breasts once I had SRS. All in all I feel great and I&#39;m happy to be here. Every now and then I wake up and think &#34;Holy Shit, I&#39;m a fucking transsexual&#34;. After so many years of wondering about it, being afraid of it, swearing that wasn&#39;t me....here I am, and it&#39;s pretty damned good.
</p>
<p>
Hope this has been useful in some way. Thanks for reading.

I just started kaiser but I’ve been on hormones for over two years and living as female for 1.5. Do you have any advice to navigate their system? I’m almost done with their “gender assessment” which freaks me out they even need to do one. I’m living female and I pass really well, but I want surgery.
</p>
<p>
How was navigating the system for you? How much were your copays? Do you still attend therapy, either group or one on one?

Hey there. I have had no problems, I use the Oakland MST cljnic. Minimal gatekeeping and very helpful. YMMV. There’s a support group Tuesday nites. I have a high deductible plan so the copays were stiff, but I got financial aid from Kaiser to help with that! So paid virtually nothing for surgery. I don’t do groups anymore, but they were nice for community networking. therapy coverage is kinda thin but they will try to help.

Financial aid! I didn’t even realize they’d offer that. That’s super useful information :)
</p>
<p>
I went on a date with one of the women from the group here in San Diego. 2nd date tomorrow :)

Hey RobynAgain,
</p>
<p>
I was supposed to get the surgery with Salim this September, but due to extenuating circumstances I didn&#39;t. I know this might be random, but maybe we can chat it about surgery stuff on social media.
</p>
<p>
my IG is @spaghetti_monstah
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still very nervous thinking about the surgery and it&#39;s implications and all that. It sounds like your experience has been overall really good. I also live in the Bay Area, maybe we can talk about it and stuff.
</p>
<p>
I hope you are well,
</p>
<p>
Sarah
