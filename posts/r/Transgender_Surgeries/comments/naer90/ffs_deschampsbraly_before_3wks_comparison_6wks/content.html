Forgot to mention: I&#39;m 30 years old, 1.5 years on hormones
</p>
<p>
edit: I should also mention I spent the last 9mo at work on a skull-drilling robot project, so I&#39;m a little desensitized to the squeamish gore factor of FFS

- the big gnarly forehead bone one (intra-op photos of this are insane)
</p>
<p>
- hairline lowered
</p>
<p>
- rhinoplasty (disappointingly not a rhino horn, just a nose job)
</p>
<p>
- lots of bone removed to reduce / round the chin
</p>
<p>
- a little bit of bone removed to round the corners of the jaw
</p>
<p>
- a probably unnecessary trachea shave thrown in as a &#34;meh, fuck it

Everything harmonizes so well and looks amazing but what he did with your chin is just incredible. It helps a lot to see this; thanks for sharing.

yes! thanks, I forgot to mention specifically
<br>
the brow lift and hairline lowering seem kind of &#34;secondary&#34; to me, since they&#39;re with the soft tissue that has to get moved around for the forehead bone work anyway (but they are treated as separate procedures fwiw)

the clinic asked me not to share price, since it can vary so much based on the procedures and the individual, but Deschamps-Braly is on the upper end of the range (worth it imo, very happy)

Deschamps-Braly is the clinic, in San Francisco!  They asked me not to share cost figures, since it can vary from person to person (e.g. &#34;rhinoplasty&#34; isn&#39;t the exact same thing on every nose!)

Yes, that make sense, but just to have an idea on order of magnitude: let&#39;s say, forehead shaving and v-chin is every of these like from 5k to 10k? or more or less? =)

I actually never got an &#34;itemized&#34; price list for each procedure tbh
</p>
<p>
a relevant consideration though is that there are a lot of &#34;fixed&#34; costs associated with surgery.  cost of things like anesthesia, operating room time, and inpatient recovery stay don&#39;t have much marginal cost per-procedure (if that makes sense)
</p>
<p>
for example, anesthesia + OR + inpatient hospital stay is probably ~$10k excluding the surgery!

I love your results. Your eyes look so much more open and the way he shortened/reshaped your chin is impressive. The browbone and forehead change is amazing. So excited for my surgery date with him next month

You look great and serious goals!  Thank you for sharing and offering up an AMA. 💗  FFS scares the bejeezus out of me but the most likely surgery I’ll need.

the peak awfulness was higher than I expected

the duration of awfulness was shorter than I expected

It was really really rough for the first week tbh, I&#39;m glad I had a friend staying over full time.  A little over a week out, I turned a corner and suddenly felt much much better.  I think it was related to getting the nasal splints out and being able to breathe through my nose...

I wouldn&#39;t mind sharing, but the clinic asked me not to share cost numbers since things vary from person to person.  Deschamps-Braly is on the upper end for cost in my research, but definitely worth it for me and I&#39;m very happy I went with them.

You look great now, and if you’re only a few weeks into recovery prepare to be amazed at how good you look as the swelling goes down.

nervous is totally normal, I was CRAZY nervous leading into it.  I think the week before is the least I ever wanted FFS, uncertainty was very intense.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
hairline scar seems obvious to me, but I&#39;ve found that I have to point it out to others for them to see what I&#39;m talking about, even with my hair pulled back.
</p>
<p>
scar healing is an up and down process of weeks and months, but the fact that I literally have to point and lean my scalp at people for them to see what scar I&#39;m talking about means that I don&#39;t worry about it at all.
</p>
<p>
fwiw it probably varies a lot from person to person based on your skin!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
first week healing was so. damn. rough.
</p>
<p>
I borrowed a nice adjustable back + knee pillow set from my dad to sleep comfortably upright, and I think that was extremely helpful.  it&#39;s pretty awful having your nose plugged with splints + gauze, and super swollen numb weird jaw impeding your mouth breathing.
</p>
<p>
I had a lot of soylent, and it was real difficult to get it down.  The nose blockage and jaw numbness + swelling made it a real challenge to get liquids in my mouth and swallow them, but the soylent was a satisfying enough &#34;food&#34; for the first week to keep me living.
</p>
<p>
frustratingly I couldn&#39;t play video games to pass time, because I couldn&#39;t really wear my glasses.  I watched some movies with a friend, and cranked my kindle zoom up super high to read books.  lots of walks: the rec from the clinic is to walk for 2 HOURS PER DAY, which is a lot when you&#39;re in that rough shape.  I was super thankful for nice weather during my tough week, because it made going for walks pleasant!
</p>
<p>
if you have other questions I&#39;d be happy to elaborate, but the clinical team also did a great job preparing me!  they went over all kinds of suggestions I hadn&#39;t thought of to make recovery easier, organized all the (overwhelming) number of post-op prescriptions, provided a handy cheat-sheet, and gave me a little gift bag of little stuff I might have forgotten to stock up on.  You can tell they&#39;ve done this a lot; I think when I went in October Dr. D said he had done &gt;950 FFS forehead procedures (he gave an exact number, I can&#39;t remember).

Having the exact same procedures done in September (including the &#39;eh, why not&#39; trachea shave)! How was recovery for you? I&#39;m pretty nervous about that particular part of this.

I just elaborated on general recovery a bunch in a comment above, but the trachea in particular I didn&#39;t even notice!  It was pretty weird; I had expected that one to hurt a lot for some reason, but it was no big deal.  Maybe I was just distracted with other wound healing XD

there was a lot of chin swelling for a bit, and it was pretty uncomfortable, but it has gone down a lot!  it was still bothering me at 2-3wks, but is totally fine now :)
</p>
<p>
nervous is very normal, I thought I was gonna lose my mind with anxiety the couple weeks before.  glad I pulled through though, feeling great about it now.
