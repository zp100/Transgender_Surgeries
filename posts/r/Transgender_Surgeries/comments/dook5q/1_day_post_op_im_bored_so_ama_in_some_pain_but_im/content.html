Which type of srs did you get? Sorry if that&#39;s not very specific or offensive to ask or anything. I&#39;m still at the beginning of my transition and don&#39;t know much about the surgery portions yet.

I got the good ole penile inversion vaginoplasty! (This is the most common if you have enough length to work with)
</p>
<p>
I didn‚Äôt have a problem with length so was able to get 15cm (6 inches) of depth!

I am so terribly envious of you my darling. I meet my top surgeon next week. Its all I can think about. Because I know that once these Zepplins are gone I shall have so much to smile about. You are beautiful and I hope you are painfully blessed with health, love, and happiness. üíôüíô

Very exciting and best of luck to you!! It‚Äôll be great! I completely understand how you feel! Waiting for bottom surgery seemed like it would never come but it came so much faster than I expected and here I am! :)
</p>
<p>
Thank you again, I am very happy currently and kind words like yours makes this moment so much better. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Update!
</p>
<p>
4 days post op. Pain has been constant for me but bearable with pain killers. I had my first bowel movement today and it felt great! Feeling super gross from not being able to shower but gauze/packing/catheter comes out tomorrow morning (post op day 5) and will be going home from there. Cannot wait to shower as well as see my vagina!!!
</p>
<p>
Honestly this week has been rough - mostly being bedridden and not being able to stay entertained. Mostly been binge watching Rupauls Drag Race UK!
</p>
<p>
AMA! :)

Hi there! I got my surgery done with the transgender healthcare team at the University of Utah. Surgeons were Dr. James Hotaling (Urologist) and Dr. Isak Goodwin (Plastic Surgeon). They are fairly new but it worked out well for me as it is close to home and family. I saw immediate post op pictures and super happy with my results. Will post frequent updates as I heal.

So going into surgery I was definitely nervous. This was my first time going under anesthesia! I got bottom surgery before getting my wisdom teeth out haha!
</p>
<p>
Surgery took 7 hours, I woke up with soreness/pain in my lower back. Doctors said it was due to position of the surgery. My throat was super dry and scratchy from the anesthesia and felt mostly groggy coming right out of surgery. Today I am more alert and actually get to feel my happiness. :)

That&#39;s some good going if you&#39;ve never been under before! 7 hours is a long ass surgery, seems like they wanted to get the best possible result though. The dry mouth and throat is normal though, that&#39;s nothing to worry about. Your throat and stuff should be fine soon. Grogginess will go away with sleep and eating etc. I&#39;m glad you feel happy though! Have they said when you&#39;ll get out of hospital?

Yes my surgeon showed me an immediate post op pic and it looked great so I‚Äôm very excited!! Today I feel great and grogginess and dry throat has completely subsided and pain is tolerable so now I can actually focus on my emotions and I‚Äôm very happy to say the least. :)
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôll be here for another 4-5 days depending on how well I heal. The ‚Äúbig reveal‚Äù where they take off my packing and catheter will be on this day so I‚Äôm very looking forward to it! If I feel comfortable enough at this point I‚Äôll post post op pics üòä

They can show you a photo?! Damn, I&#39;m gonna ask for that when I eventually get SRS myself in 4974803 years üòÇ I assume it looked swollen but good? Remember that your emotions might be really heightened given what&#39;s just happened so it&#39;s ok to be up and down. Try to look after yourself emotionally as well as physically. They go hand in hand after all.
</p>
<p>
I hear getting the packing out Sucks‚Ñ¢ but it&#39;ll be worth it. If you&#39;re happy to share, I&#39;d love to see some photos when you&#39;re ready ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Yeah I think my surgeon was very proud bc I didn‚Äôt even ask he just showed me and I was very impressed! It was swollen so I can‚Äôt wait to see what it‚Äôll look like once swelling and bruising goes down. Thank you so much for the advice and wishing you the best of luck with your journey! :)
</p>
<p>
And yes, I‚Äôd be happy to share my results as soon as my packing and catheter comes out!!

That&#39;s awesome! The swelling will go away after a while, you just need to be patent is all. No need to thank me, just what I&#39;ve learned over the past couple of years of researching. Thank you though for sharing and thanks for being so lovely!
