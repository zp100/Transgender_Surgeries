I&#39;ve already been there and done my FFS with them, but I fell in love with Argentina whilst I was there, so I&#39;ll be heading back again as soon as possible!

Before surgery, I hired a Lime scooter and went to La Recoleta cemetery, and just checked the place out. You
<em>
have to
</em>
go to La Recoleta cemetery if you visit Buenos Aires. If you don&#39;t know anything about it, google it. It is one of the most awe inspiring places I have ever been. Because I arrived on a Friday afternoon, my first venture was on the weekend, and there was also a crafts market right outside the cemetery, which was wonderful to look around.
</p>
<p>
Post surgery, after I was mobile, but whilst I was still not up to walking around for 8 hours, I spent one day doing a tour of the city on the CityBus.  It&#39;s a hop on hop off bus with an all day ticket. There&#39;s a fleet of them that do fixed routes, with an English speaking tour guide that tells talking over the speakers to let you know where you are and what you&#39;re doing etc.  I used that and hopped off at a few interesting places, but mostly just toured the city in air conditioning :)
</p>
<p>
I took the Buquebus to Uruguay, and did a day trip of Colonia del Sacramento. It&#39;s a little city, with a tiny historic village. The village is still active though, and has lots of cafes and a little beach etc, so you can take your time and wander around at your own pace, resting when needed.  I even had a pub lunch there which was just amazing!
</p>
<p>
I also did a Tigre Delta tour on a boat, that then dropped us off in Tigre to look around at the amazing Tigre markets.  The Tigre delta is like nothing you&#39;ve ever seen before.  An entire town, built on a river delta. School boat instead of a school bus, garbage boat instead of a garbage truck etc.  Honestly, I want to retire there :)  After the Tigre delta, you end up at Tigre, which is a tourist city, and they dropped us off at marquetta de Puerto de Frutos, which is a huge tourist and farmers market, again with lots of places to stop and sit when you need to.
</p>
<p>
Of an evening, we mostly had dinner at El Perón Perón, which is walking distance from anywhere within the area Amanda asks you to book accommodation.  It&#39;s a bar for Peronistas, which is the left leaning political party of Buenos Aires, and a sort of shrine to Juan and Evita Peron.  That&#39;s neither here nor there, but it&#39;s a friendly bar with welcoming inclusive staff, and great food and drinks.
</p>
<p>
I also spent a day basically riding around on the subway. You have to see Jauregui station (It was called Santa Fe when I was there, but has since been renamed). It&#39;s pretty gay :P.  I also hopped off at Florida subway station, and explored the central shopping district there. It&#39;s very much the &#34;heart&#34; of Buenos Aires.  Lots of malls, shops, coffee etc.  Basically, the area between station and el obelisco
</p>
<p>
Before I was up to full day activities, I was really close to Distrito Arcos, which is basically a fancy upmarket shopping mall. If you&#39;re from America, it will have a few brands your familiar with (Wendys, Starbucks etc) and was a nice place to just sit and have a coffee only a short walk from where I was staying.
</p>
<p>
The Centro Cultural de la Ciencia (a science museum) is literally across the road from Distrito Arcos, but I never ended up getting there.
</p>
<p>
Some general tips and tricks.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
It helps if you&#39;ve got some Spanish. Whilst I don&#39;t speak conversational spanish at all, I have enough Spanish to navigate stores and basic purchases of things like tickets, which helped a great deal.
</li>
<li>
You have to be willing to be pretty self sufficient with these things, as you&#39;re on your own organising them, and you&#39;ll be wandering around (possibly alone) in a foreign country, where you probably don&#39;t speak the language. Amanda said she was surprised at how adventurous I&#39;d been, as most people sort of feel a little bit intimidated and don&#39;t venture out too far.
</li>
<li>
Give Amanda permission to pass your details on to any other girls that are staying there at the same time as you. She won&#39;t give you their details if they haven&#39;t already given permission, but she&#39;ll happily give your details to them if you ask. You can organise that before you even arrive, and start chatting to other girls that might be there.  I met a couple of people these way, and all of my &#34;we&#34; statements about the things we did was because I did all of them with another girl who was also in recovery
</li>
<li>
Your credit card will be useless to you. Most places won&#39;t take it, and those that do will require you to show your passport, and it will be a huge ordeal, especially if you don&#39;t speak Spanish. Cash is King in Buenos Aires, especially US dollars.
</li>
<li>
Amanda will give you a phone to use. Make sure you ask her for the number to that phone, that way you can use it to sign up for Glovo or another similar delivery services. They will deliver anything, from pharmacy items, to fast food, to groceries, and they were a LIFE SAVER when I was in recovery for the first few days. Amanda makes sure you don&#39;t lack anything essential, but I was able to spoil myself a bit without needing Amanda or someone else to go shopping for me, by using Glovo.  Those services are one of the few ways to use your credit card to pay for groceries etc too.
</li>
<li>
Everything in Buenos Aires starts late! The place doesn&#39;t kick off until 10 or 11am.  I arrived at the markets on Saturday at 11am, and assumed I was too late, as half of the stalls were being disassembled.  Turns out, they were actually still being assembled, and I was there at the beginning of the market day.
</li>
</ol>

Well, day 2 and 3 of recovery are brutal. Day 4 you start to feel human again, and can probably venture out a little bit on day 5 or so.  By day 6 or 7, you&#39;ll be right to go! One week out, you&#39;ll still look like you&#39;ve been bashed, but you&#39;ll feel fine :)
</p>
<p>
FFS recovery is a strange one, because those early days are truly brutal, and probably the hardest surgical recoveries I&#39;ve ever done. Not painful, but you are just so helpless and uncomfortable. You can&#39;t see properly, you can&#39;t eat properly, you&#39;ve lost sensation in various places due to the surgery, and when you look in the mirror, you won&#39;t believe the swelling and bruising you see. But then, just like that, you turn the corner and suddenly you feel perfectly fine. You&#39;re still recovering obviously, but the difference between day 3 and day 4 for me was like day and night.  And once you&#39;ve turned that corner, you&#39;ll be up and ready to start exploring again :)

So, about 6 months post FFS, I was in despair, and felt like it had failed. I looked at myself in the mirror and it was too subtle, and it was clearly my old face looking back at me. Similarly, all of my friends and family who knew me before hand were also underwhelmed. None of them
<em>
said
</em>
that, but you could tell, because every one of them had understated reactions.
</p>
<p>
It took me a long time to realise though that the problem wasn&#39;t my surgery, it was my own ability to see myself accurately and truly. I gradually came to realise that I genuinely cis pass now, and getting close to 2 years post surgery, even though I
<em>
still
</em>
feel like my face hasn&#39;t changed, I only have to compare a photo of me now vs a photo of me before to remind myself that my self perception is the issue, not my results.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, I&#39;m very happy with my results, but it was quite a journey to get to that point because of all sorts of internalised baggage.  Not everyone goes through that, but many of us do, so be prepared!
</p>
<p>
And Amanda and Dr Rossi are both just amazing, wonderful people! I can&#39;t say enough good things about them and the service! I plan on returning to Buenos Aires in the next year or two, and plan to catch up with Amanda without being a patient :)
</p>
<p>
Also, I&#39;m happy to share photos via DM.  Drop me a message if you&#39;re interested
