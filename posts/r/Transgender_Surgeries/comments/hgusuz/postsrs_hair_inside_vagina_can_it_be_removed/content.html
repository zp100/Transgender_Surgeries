After recently reading this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Although the hairs on the graft were cauterized during surgery, it is possible to notice hair regrowth inside the vaginal cavity. This may occur due to many factors, including age, hormonal changes, and certain health problems. Most of the time, the presence of hair can cause hygiene problems and increase the risk of infection. Some hairs can come off and form a ball that can end up at the bottom of the vaginal cavity.
<strong>
If the presence of hair causes side effects, there are different options available to remove it
</strong>
. Please contact us.

I had renewed hope that maybe the hairs inside my vagina can be removed. Anyone who&#39;s had SRS with Dr. Brassard in Montreal know about what are these different options? Thanks!

It went well.  The hair at the front is gone. The ones at the back are gone right now, but come back I want to say maybe 3-6 months later after getting them removed? But every time they are removed it feels like it takes longer for them to come back.

Hi! I have the same problem (different country different surgeon, but irrelevant by now). I wonder if that solution worked for you.  Thank you so much!

Well that&#39;s good enough I guess.. by now I&#39;m a literal pussy spitting hair balls and it&#39;s awkward as hell... Now it&#39;s just a matter of finding a gynecologist who&#39;ll do it. Thanks!!

Hair can be removed surgically however the added scarring could cause additional issues

On the flip side, not needing to do a year of expensive, painful, and dysphoria-inducing electrolysis is one of the major reasons I&#39;m thrilled to be going to Dr. Brassard!

Brassard doesn’t need you to do electrolysis because if you have hair it’s your problem and not his. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of anyone who’s actually managed to remove deep hair, although some say it is possible. Kind of risky.

It&#39;s appears all penile inversion surgeons have cases of internal hair no matter what they tell you. It&#39;s a risk if you don&#39;t do electrolysis.

Could you make a post about your surgery when you&#39;re done? I think it would be the first and could help others.

July 2021 is probably enough time if you’d start right away. Wouldn’t be much left by then.

Im curious why did you pick Hart?

Hey, congratulate yourself on learning this in advance and taking care of it.
</p>
<p>
I naively went with my surgeons recommendation to do no hair removal (plus a &#34;guarantee!&#34; of no hair after surgery, thanks champ) and now I have the pleasure of needing to find someone who can deal with them post surgery which is just wonderful lol.
