Hi everyone. Hope it‚Äôs ok to post, I just need some reassurance that what I‚Äôm feeling is a perfectly normal stage of recovery.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm nearly 9 weeks post penile inversion with Ms Rashid in London. Generally feeling ok, no complications but I‚Äôm getting a lot of discomfort around the glans/erectile tissue that was kept. I can only describe it as feeling like extreme tucking, like my old appendage has been crammed into a space too small for it. If I‚Äôm stationary it‚Äôs generally ok but moving about, particularly from lying down to sitting up, can really hurt as everything gets squashed together. First thing in the morning, getting out of bed, is a real struggle‚Ä¶horribly uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs been like this for over a week now and doesn‚Äôt seem to be easing. It‚Äôs starting to get me down as it makes me reluctant to move about plus I‚Äôm putting on weight because I‚Äôm not moving much. Then eating to comfort myself‚Ä¶a familiar cycle‚Ä¶üò¢
</p>
<p>
It would be reassuring to know that other folk have had this and that it does pass?  Thank you!  x
</p>

I felt a &#34;tight tucking&#34; sensation at the beginning of my recovery, but I felt it more in the canal itself and it went away at some point within the first month. I did also feel something around the clitoris, and that was especially when getting up (and especially when getting up from dilating), but it was never painful, and I haven&#39;t noticed it as much recently (3 months as of tomorrow).

If I&#39;m understanding the feeling you&#39;re describing, it&#39;s what I think of as a sort of &#34;tightening&#34;? in that area. It is something I experienced from time to time during my recovery, among (many) other discomforts. But I don&#39;t think I felt this as consistently or as often as you&#39;re describing.
</p>
<p>
The surgery team are generally good at answering questions in my experience so I&#39;d send them an email to ask their opinion. Hopefully they will be able to offer advice, and either let you know if it sounds concerning, or put your mind at ease a bit!

Thank you. Yes I have my follow up appointment on Monday and I‚Äôll mention it then, I just wanted to hear the collective thoughts if this group too.
</p>
<p>
It is a kind of tightening I guess but more of a squashing as I experience it most when transitioning from, say, lying to sitting or sitting to standing. When I‚Äôm at rest I hardly feel it at all. Thanks.

This is happening to me too.  I‚Äôm about a month out and when I stand up it feels like I get a ton of pressure on my clitoris and my brain interprets it as ‚Äúextreme tucking‚Äù.  My follow up nurse explained that it has to do with how gravity effects the swelling in the area.
</p>
<p>
It sucks ass.  And not in a fun way.

Yep, totally not fun. Did your nurse give any indication of how long it lasts?  Thanks

A couple of weeks at least.  It all depends on how long it takes the swelling to go down.  I‚Äôve started using an ice pack at night and that‚Äôs helped.

8 week PI here I have the same it&#39;s normal as your tissue and scars are starting to harden for a few weeks you can have it then it will soften again and you should be ok.
</p>
<p>
I could describe it as a permanent standing dickü§£

I&#39;ve read about this happening and it&#39;s temporary, however you can talk to your doctor about taking anti androgens for a few months to help. I think it&#39;s some kind of &#34;WTF&#34; response from your body that tries to produce testosterone.
