It’s been about 4 months of HRT if I’m reading that right, I know in my state it needs to be at least a years worth of HRT before one can even consider GRS or FFS or even BA

Oh yea I totally get that, research your doc too cuz I know some require at least a year of laser hair removal /+ electrology for a year down there to even consider surgery on your bits too so look into that as well!

In Ontario, you can have one letter from your GP and another from a mental health professional. This sufficed for GRS Montreal as well

For bottom you need 2 letters from therapists and a 3rd from your endocrinologist. And 1 year hrt. And the letters must be dated within a year of surgery date. And most bottom surgeons have long wait lists. Dont jump into a random surgeon because youre dysphoric. Get it done right

If your endo is willing by all means it&#39;ll work. Not ideal though. It needs to be someone with mental health and gender experience. I had to get a gender specialized psychiatrist Dr.helma Seidl at &#34;making a difference&#34; in central ottawa. I paid out of pocket and saw her maybe twice and she was like YEAH IDK WHY YOURE HERE
<em>
signed paper
</em>
She told me I was one of her last patients because she was retiring but she MIGHT be doing online stuff ? Try reaching out maybe ?

Edit. You need more than Endo. Sorry. I had to get a letter from my Endo, GP, and that mentioned psychiatrist. (Wasn&#39;t expensive either btw)

I think any doctor that&#39;s known you for over a year can attest. All she really needs to do is confirm you are physically capable to get surgery and that she&#39;s known you for over a year. Maybe she has the wrong idea

I have the ontario ohip srs forms printed out and wpath guide on how to do the letter.its sad thinking a non doctor like me has to walk her through it.i am with a caseworker Tristan from Centretown ottawa trans health unit.maybe I should get them to be in contact with each other and for my doctor Dr.low to direct her question to them?I will fight for this letter of readiness as I know the girl I am.you know how the system tries to set us up to fail.which is sad.

Tbh when I started transitioning back in 2015 my gp knew nothing. I was her first trans patient, but she took it upon herself to learn and now is one of the most knowledgeable people I know.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t give up. This process is also designed to test your perseverance and motivations. It took me nearly 2 years from when I applied till when I actually got a surgery date. I was denied the first time because one of my doctors wasn&#39;t comfortable with me going through the surgery (hadn&#39;t seen him in 3 years... I get it)
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s alot of hoops to jump through and the system is for sure broken, but most things are. Don&#39;t give up &lt;3

Ontario requires the primary letter to e written by a physician, nurse practitioner, or endocrinologist that is wparh certified, the second can be from a qualified  physician, nurse practitioner, endocrinologist, or psychiatrist.

So like my trans physciatrist/psychologist Jesse Bosse of Tall Tree Psychology who is wpath certified and trained would do the first letter and my endo would the second letter and sign it  all off and make sure everything their and send off the documents and hopefully approved?

So you need approval from your HRT doctor, and 2 psychiatrists. Your psychiatrist will get you an appointment with a 2nd psychiatrist so it can a sober second thought essentially.
