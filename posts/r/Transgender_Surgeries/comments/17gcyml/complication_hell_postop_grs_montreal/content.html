I had a minimal depth vaginoplasty with Dr. Brassard last Monday. The initial convalescence period was difficult mentally for me, to the point where I was sobbing everday, dying to go home. Well now I&#39;m home in the GTA, and I just spent all day yesterday in the ER due to projectile bleeding from the incision site.
</p>
<p>
A Hematoma has developed on the right labia majora, and despite it not hurting, it&#39;s likely to cause further complications if not addressed. The ER Urologist wouldn&#39;t drain it because he didn&#39;t have the expertise. Now GRS Montréal wants me back in Montréal tonight to have a revision operation tomorrow morning. And I&#39;m sobbing again, desperate to not go back, terrified of the 6+ hour car ride there. But they&#39;re insisting no one in the GTA can help me. I don&#39;t know what to do, I don&#39;t know where to go, I don&#39;t know how to hold myself together. Bottom surgery was the worst decision I&#39;ve ever made in my life. Someone save me
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: So I got back to Montréal, its been hell, stressful, horrible. I had the hematoma drained this morning. Fine, everything was getting better. Now GUESS WHAT! It&#39;s coming back and they might want me in surgery again tomorrow!! Wow!!!!!!!!!!! This is horrible, just horrible. I understand they&#39;re doing what they can but I&#39;m miserable
</p>
<p>
UPDATE 2: Hematoma didn&#39;t come back significantly, doing wayyy better now. Heading home today finally. Knock on wood all stays good

I&#39;m sure a revision surgery wouldn&#39;t be nearly as bad as the original. I&#39;m dealing with an infection complication from FFS and worried I may need more surgery to deal with a recurring abscess. It&#39;s scary and frustrating but you gotta trust your doctors.

Same. I had a surgery last week, almost five weeks after my FFS, to take care of an infection. I have to go back in like two or three months to get it all fixed again and it’s gonna be just as invasive as the first one. I’m not looking forward to it but it’s the best course of action. It sucks and is very frustrating.
</p>
<p>
BUT
</p>
<p>
While they did have to basically peel most of my face off for a second time and remove a piece of bone, my recovery this time around is way less terrible. Revisions seem to be significantly less awful than the surgery itself. OP trust the doctors and know that with patience it’ll all work out. Just like every other aspect of transitioning, you have to “hurry up and wait.” You can do this. Also it helped me to realize that post-op depression is a sneaky bitch and makes everything seem worse than it really is.

Go to Montreal ASAP.  You could take the train instead of driving.

Please come to Montreal for this. I know it&#39;s scary, but it&#39;s best that Dr. Brassard tries to fix this himself

I had the same complication (same spot too) after my minimal depth vaginaplasty. Judging by time, youre probably back in Montreal now. It sucks to have to do. and makes an already really fraught time really difficult. But you will 100% get through this. I had my hematoma drained under local anesthetic (that kept wearing off). It was lowkey a lil traumatic at the time and i had no idea how i was  going to be okay. But now i am. you’ve got this.

You should have stayed in Montreal 2 weeks after your surgery so that they could operate you as soon as possible. You should have rented an airbn bachelor and kept yourself close to your doctor. Grs Montreal should also have a hospital hotel for patients who had their surgery recently. I had three surgeries so far and the first months is crucial after the operation

Girl, it&#39;s not like anyone told me that in advance. The normal discharge timeline for minimal depth vaginoplasty is 5 days, how was I supposed to know I shouldve hung out longer?

Most American surgeons require their patients to stay local to the hospital for 2-4 weeks and I&#39;m sorry GRS Montreal doesn&#39;t have that policy because this is why other doctors do it, and your experience is the real life example of why.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with the revision, if its just a hematoma it should be pretty quick to fix, even if its going to look a bit gnarly for the next few weeks it will heal up all the same.

Absolutely do what your surgeon tells you and go back to them for revision. Yes, it’s stressful, but not following directions might lead to serious and potentially devastating issues. It will be virtually impossible to find a local doctor that has any idea how to fix this.
