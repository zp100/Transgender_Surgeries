I am asking because I want to know/be prepared for what is ahead, following my surgery. During my recent consult, Dr. RBb-L was very clear that full dilation was a 15-minute requirement. But (understandably) nothing was said about session cleanup/aftercare.
</p>
<p>
What is your recommendation for cleanup/aftercare when finished dilating? Is it an issue if the lubricant remains in the vagina? Is douching necessary? Recommended? If the lube remains, does that lead to an odor issue? Are there ‚Äúleakage‚Äù issues? If so, how do you deal with those matters?
</p>
<p>
Many of you who have posted especially about how life immediately upon release from the hospital and for a prescribed number of weeks after, seems to revolve around the required 4-times a day, 15-minute-per dilation (not counting the time it takes to achieve entry and full depth each time). But little has been shared about the aftercare of these required sessions.
</p>
<p>
What is your after-dilation regimen? What suggestions or tips make cleanup/aftercare easier for you? Please share‚ù£Ô∏èü§ó‚Äôs and Much üíï for taking the time to share‚ù£Ô∏è

I am 2¬Ω years post-op from Dr Rachel Bluebon-Langner. After you are discharged you are given post-maternity underwear and pads as you will be leaking some blood for a number a weeks, but it wasn&#39;t as bad as I expected. After you dilate you only need to wash the dilator with warm soapy water. (Anti-bacterial soap is recommended.) The pads will take care of any leakage. Once a day, usually after your last dilation of the day, you douche with a saline solution. The hospital will give you a starter kit with the solution and douche kit, but tap water can be safely used when that runs out. (You can also mix a very very small amount of distilled white vinegar in the solution. (1 tablespoon / 2 cups ). They will also get you extra pads for your bed so you don&#39;t mess up your sheets with dilating. I suggest getting
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disposable-Underpads-100-Count-Incontinence-Protection/dp/B06XS446GP">extras from Amazon</a>
. After month or so, just a towel can be used without any issues.
</p>
<p>
After each follow-up appointment, Dr BL would decrease the amount of douching needed. It went from every other day after a few weeks and eventually once a week for a while. You will be wearing regular pads after a few weeks for an additional month or two depending on how you heal. I have never had any odor issues at all and now I only douche once a month.
</p>
<p>
After 3 months occasionally I would need to wear a pad and I would just wear the ultra-thin ones. This would depend on physical activity at the gym, sexual activity, hormones (I inject), lube used and arousal.
</p>
<p>
Once you dilate once a day then period underwear or pads I would wear at night. (I prefer period underwear on nights that I dilate now which is twice a week.
</p>
<p>
Here was my dilation schedule but it might have changed slightly since then:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Month 1 - Dilate 4 times a day 3-4 hours apart
</li>
<li>
Month 2 - Dilate 3 times a day with next size dilator if possible
</li>
<li>
Month 3 - Dilate 3 times a day with next size dilator if possible
</li>
<li>
Month 4-12 - Dilate 2 times a day with the largest dilator if possible
</li>
<li>
Month 12+ - Dilate 1 - 3 times a week with the largest dilator if possible
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Dilation will seem like a chore the first month or two, but it does get a lot better. Now it is just maintenance and no big deal at all.

Your welcome and you are in excellent hands with Dr Rachel Bluebon-Langner and Dr Zhao who does the urology work.

I know this is well after your post, but this information was extremely helpful. There is a lot of information about grs on this sub, but this was the most specific info I saw regarding RB-L specifically. My consult is coming up, and this helped ease my mind a bit ü©µ

Glad I was able to help. I have now reached a point where I can go a week or even more between dilating. The most critical part is the beginning since you are training your muscles more than anything else.

That&#39;s awesome! I&#39;m a very physically active person (sports, gym, fixing stuff around the house, etc) so the dilation schedule has been the most intimidating part. I think the dilation itself didn&#39;t bother me, but the thought of constantly having my schedule interrupted by it. Dilation really does seem much more manageable than I originally thought.
</p>
<p>
Congrats on your surgery though, you must be very happy üòä. I can&#39;t wait for mine!

All that in 15 minutes? What about after 12 months?

Figure about 20 minutes with prep and cleanup. After a year, dilation is needed about once a week and now over 5¬Ω years later I dilate once every 2 weeks if I am using it at least once a week with penetrating toys (strap-on or fun toys). It really is going to depend out how you body is afterwards. I know trans women who have gone for month after many years of dilation without any issues.

For me I had a sigmoid colon surgery after a botched first surgery and currently still in the recovery. I have to dilate 3 times a day for 10 min.  After that I take a light shower but no soap or other things are supposed to touch the vagina. I can point the shower at the vagina to clean.  For me this is recommended since I produce a bit of mucus on my own. I have no leaking or odor. After that I can tap it lightly dry and done.

I understand from reading the accounts of other women that at first, starting dilation is a significant adjustment. I appreciate you sharing your method. Thank you‚ù£Ô∏è

I&#39;m just over six weeks out from GRS surgery with RBL, and my dilation/douching schedule is a little different. The instructions I got had me dilating 4x a day for at least 15 minutes, then 3x from week six until week twelve, then 2x daily until month 9, then daily until one year, at which point it goes down to weekly. I can send you my instructions if you like!

(also my vinegar/water ratio is 1:1)
