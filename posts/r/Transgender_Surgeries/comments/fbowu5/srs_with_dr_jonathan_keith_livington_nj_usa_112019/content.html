My insurance screwed with me the day before the surgery at no fault of Dr. Keith.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Keith advocated for me and fought for me against the board to pay for my insurance and also connected me to NJ Equality to help pressure the insurance companies to cover me as they should.

Do you mean he&#39;s no longer there?
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s still listed there and his personal site says he&#39;s there.

He quit rutgers over my bottom surgery due to how bad rutgers fucked me over, among other things, but what they did to me was the final straw. They also sent a letter saying he&#39;s gone (showed him, he was pissed as they were supposed to tell his patients where he went). He works with a Dr at rutgers still, who&#39;s also going to be leaving soon if he hasn&#39;t already.
</p>
<p>
He still gets residents from there though

Sorry, I didn&#39;t read it properly the first time. I&#39;m trying to do too many things at once.
</p>
<p>
I added an entry just for Rutgers so people will see this in post the future

Rutgers offers all other surgeries but when I last spoke to them in October, they no longer had a Dr that can do bottom surgery
