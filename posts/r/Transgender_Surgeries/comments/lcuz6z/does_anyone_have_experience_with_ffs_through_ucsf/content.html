I just had my FFS with Dr Hoffman on December 29th! Overall I’m really happy with my results. He totally understood that I wanted to still look like myself after surgery and so far I’m seeing that he did a really good job with that. I had a scalp advancement, forehead reconstruction, brow shave, buccal fat pad removal, Botox into my jaw muscle, osterioplasty and a jaw shave (I think that’s it lol). I just got the hospital bill and it was $100,000 in total, and I feel really blessed to have been able to use my parents insurance+met my deductible so I ended up having to pay nothing. I don’t know much about the other surgeons, but I think the most important thing is that you feel comfortable with whoever is doing your surgery. Hoffman has over 35 years of craniofacial surgical experience and that was enough for me to be comfortable with him, and I didn’t really do much research beforehand-it was kind of just a random matchup. Only complaint would be that I got deadbamed and misgendered in the hospital after surgery, but I was so whacked out and have been putting up with that for 5 years lol. I’d also say that I wish he were more involved in my aftercare, but he’s a busy surgeon who works on a lot of patients. He also takes his time in the consultation appointments so I ended up having to wait about 45+ minutes for my consultation and usually around 15 minutes for follow ups. Usually I’d be pretty peeved about it but everyone in the office was really nice and it gives me piece of mind knowing that he cares enough to take his time with patients. Let me know if you have any other questions :)! Or if you want before and after! I was planning on posting some maybe at my 3 month mark, because I’m still not super thrilled with how my jaw/chin look.

Thanks for sharing, that is helpful for me! If your surgery happened in the Zuckerberg Hospital in SF then I know exactly the nurse you are talking about. I filed a complaint when I was there for a different procedure.
</p>
<p>
Also if you are up for sharing pics, that would be helpful to me. UCSF is my only fully covered option for FFS, so I am looking at the different surgeons there. You can send me a PM if you are comfortable with that.

Nope! Wasn’t any specific nurse. I don’t really know how nursing works or what their shift changes are like. All the nurses who directly took care of me were really nice. It was whenever Id call on the little phone thingy in the room and they’d immediately open up with my dead name, so any misgendering probably had to do with that lol. My ID says my new name and is marked F for female, but my name on my insurance is my old name. It was at whichever one the parnassus hospital is! A short drive from where I live too so that was really nice.

Hahaha no worries. I get it though! I’ve had so many people give me tude during my transition and luckily I’ve just been able to apathetic towards it. Good on you for reporting that nurse though! She was probably doing a little projecting of her own..
