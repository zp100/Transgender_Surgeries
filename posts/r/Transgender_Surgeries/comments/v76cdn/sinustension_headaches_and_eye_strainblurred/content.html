For y&#39;all that have had FFS, did you experience things like tension/sinus headaches and eye strain after FFS?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m about two weeks out and these have just started a couple of days ago. I also have nauseas and dizzyness but I think this is probably caused by the antibiotics. It just seems weird because the pain immediately up to 1.5 weeks post surgery felt like nothing compared to this.

Ya I experienced that too around the time. Can’t say if it’s normal or not but it did get better after some months.
