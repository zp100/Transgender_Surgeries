üéâ I was born in Wisconsin too and their rules for changing gender on your birth certificate are ridiculous so I won&#39;t be doing it but I&#39;m happy it&#39;s worked out for you. ‚ù§Ô∏èü§çüíô

It was super easy, I wrote a letter to the court with a notarized letter from my doctor saying I got surgery. You should look into it!!

Eh, I honestly don&#39;t care what my birth cert says: they did the best with the available data they had at the time, y&#39;know? Thanks though!

Did you do consults with any other surgeons besides Dr Gast? Any particular reasons you ended up going with her?
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve also read varying accounts of girls that went to her- mostly related to a somewhat cold bedside manner. It sounds like you had a very positive experience with her though!

I looked into Dr. Schecter in Chicago. I got recommended Dr.Gast by my HRT doctor and she said that she‚Äôs had a lot of patients go to Gast and had amazing results. I went to a consult with my mom and she was so nice and very close in proximity to where I live and we decided Gast would be perfect.
</p>
<p>
She can be cold. I will admit that. Her team is fantastic though! The nurses and other doctors were amazing.

I‚Äôm waiting until I‚Äôm sure I have my final results before I post my own write-up of my experiences with Dr. Gast, but FWIW she‚Äôs had excellent bedside manner with me in every interaction I‚Äôve had with her. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt describe her as cold. I had a complication, so I have had to interact with her and her team quite a bit, and they‚Äôve have all been friendly, caring, and responsive. I know one other person who consulted with her and another who had surgery with her who both had personality conflicts with her, but in both cases they described the interactions and it was clear their own lack of social skills were a significant factor.
</p>
<p>
My partner had her surgery in Montreal with Dr. Brassard, and I went with her for it, and that experience was a strong influence in my staying more local for my surgery.

I know I&#39;m replying to this a few months after you posted, sorry. If Gast will not operate on you, you should get a letter from her office to give to your insurance. This might allow you to see a different surgeon. I would research other surgeons you are interested in first, and then submit the letter with your out of network authorization request with your primary care doctor.  (I used to work for an insurance company)

This was a very fascinating personal review of your past year or so, Nicole!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure that everyones would love to see your timeline of recovery images, myself included, but only do what you want and be sure to have as great a year as you are able to have.

She was on my short list before I shelved the entire idea as the recovery timeframe wouldn‚Äôt fit with being a parent of two young kids.   I want the surgery but just scared of a botch surgery and months of horrible recovery
