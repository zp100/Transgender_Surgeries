I was originally scheduled for consult Christmas Eve of 2019, which I booked in Feb. of 2018. Yeah, it was a tough reality to wrap my head around for a couple of months there. I then threw myself into self betterment and controlling what I could by working out, healthy dieting, going out of my way to get 3 letters instead of 2 just cause, things like that. I ended up meeting another transwoman at the end of the year who had scheduled a consult AFTER me, yet somehow received a cancellation call before me (for added context, I live a few minutes away from the hospital, had active health insurance, etc. That&#39;s why it didn&#39;t make sense to me). I called OHSU and [*respectfully/politely*] asked for any insight as to why that might have been the case. The woman I was speaking with couldn&#39;t figure it out either, but offered to bump me up to Jan. of 2019 regardless. Had the consult in Jan., and since I was already prepared as I could possibly be, I got a phone call shortly after for a cancellation spot in March. Fast forward 6 months, here we are.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s important to acknowledge I&#39;m lucky enough to live in Portland (after a personal battle to get here), a city with easier access to trans health resources that was able to help me take care of the back end stuff pretty early on, something that might not be the case for everyone. The bottom line:  my humble advice is control what you can, acknowledge the mountain in front you yet, make it your bitch, and take things one day at a time. When you speak to any receptionist/Dr./nurse/whoever, be polite and respectful which will get you ahead in life. We&#39;re all pissed at the state of trans healthcare in the United States of America, not the receptionist we&#39;re speaking to as a person. Too many times along my journey did I see people in the community treating these workers like garbage just for doing their jobs. They&#39;re human beings too, and I&#39;m thankful they&#39;re here and want to help us.

Coffee fueled unsolicited rant. Hope this helps my friend! You&#39;ve got this!

Wow! It looks great! I also had Dugi, I‚Äôm about four months post op now. It‚Äôs so cool to see someone ahead of me, it was really hard to find any info online about Dugi. Do you mind if I follow you?
</p>
<p>
P.S. is that pink part at the top your clitoris, or is that your labia minora and clitoral hood? My clitoris is so hard to see and touch because it‚Äôs very hooded.

Not much to follow but go ahead lol. The part you&#39;re referring to would be the clitoral hood/labia. It looks a little pink and swollen because I should have picked a photo not taken right after sex with my partner in hindsight lol.
</p>
<p>
Edit:  Also, if I were to pull back the hood, there&#39;d be no missing my clitoris lol. It&#39;s big! Nothing about my end result bothers me in any kind of way. I&#39;m 100% content and thankful that I was able to receive this surgery in my lifetime and have absolutely nothing but great things to say. As always, saying that comes with acknowledgement and gratitude as not everyone can say the same.

Ok! Do you mind if I ask a couple questions? If not then feel free to just ignore me.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Have you had an orgasm since your surgery?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Did you have a lot of wetness/discharge? Has that stopped or slowed down 6 months out?
</p>
</li>
</ol>

1.). I‚Äôve had them just about everyday starting at the 3 week mark lol
</p>
<p>
2.). To be honest, I‚Äôve had 0 complications with my recovery, though around June/July yeah there was a moment where I had a slight uptick in discharge. This is because I started dilating less frequently. Body got used to the new schedule shortly after and I‚Äôm back to 100%. I get a taaad moist when aroused but really, really wet after i orgasm ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I almost went to dugi but in 2019 was given a consult date of June 21, 2020. I moved down to Kansas City and am currently in the hospital recovering. They have only done 47 ops so far and I have no complications as of now, 5 days in.
</p>
<p>
If anyone wants to take over my appointment with dugi in June 2020 dm me and I&#39;ll get you switched to my consult date. (Itll take a 3 way call with you and his clinic)

Wow this is actually the first time I&#39;ve seen a picture of dugi results, congrats btw! Looks great :)
</p>
<p>
I had a consult with him January and was very impressed with him and his team. Unfortunately I think I fell through the cracks because I haven&#39;t heard from his office since.

Where are you in your electrolysis process? That might also be a factor if you still have several sessions to go yet. If the logistics are in your favor (support network, travel, recovery supplies, completed electrolysis, etc), consider calling and requesting a spot on their cancellation list. When I had my consult in January, I was told based off of their current schedule to realistically expect a call for surgery scheduling by the end of summer 2020, even though I had already completed electrolysis and had everything lined up. That said, they had a cancellation in Feb and I got the call; had surgery in March.
</p>
<p>
Make a polite phone call next week and follow up with them, never hurts!

Can‚Äôt recommend them enough. Amazing care and results. There‚Äôs a reason OHSU is one of the go to hospitals in this area of the country, not just for trans healthcare.

Hii, I know this is an old post but, I just recently had mine done by dr duggi. Thanks for sharing this with us!! I am definitely healing slow. I still got a lot of stitches, a lot swelling and a lot wounds that still bleed a lot. Which isn‚Äôt unexpected. Are you doing any specific exercises or something to that helps to heal faster? üòäüòáü•∞ thank you!!!
