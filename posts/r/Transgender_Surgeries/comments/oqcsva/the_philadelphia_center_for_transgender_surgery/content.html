My wife just got hers done with him. I&#39;d tell you to go elsewhere. The hospital was stingy with pain medication. Then we got shuffled to the outpatient center (aka apartment where he sees you once a day and the rest of your care is up to whoever you brought with you)
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s judgemental, rude, fails to properly explain things and educate you, and really creepy. Like... Bandage you up, slap your wounded pussy, and blow you a kiss creepy (yes, that happened).
</p>
<p>
My wife cried because she feared he&#39;d hurt her due to lack of due diligence. She had severe wound separation and I had to pry information out of him to help her. I learned more on Google than what he was telling me. I seriously thought about taking her and leaving to just about anywhere else for better help.
</p>
<p>
Go literally anywhere else. Not kidding.
