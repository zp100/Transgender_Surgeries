I would like to document this whole journey on Reddit, so I don’t forget any details when I look back on it. Feel free to ask me anything that I have included. And I will keep updating this daily. And if some parts don’t make sense, I’m sorry I’m on drugs lol.
</p>
<p>
I was able to get a pretty quick surgery date. I did my consult in February. I had previously done a consultation at Crane center, but I really didn’t feel like they cared about me and they were hard to get a hold of. But Hanna Gender Center was the complete opposite. He took the time to listen to all my questions and answers versus he could, the patient care coordinators are amazing, and the staff at Carrolton regional has been great as well.
</p>
<p>
I drove up to Dallas on Tuesday, May 30 and went to a nice dinner. Wednesday was Bowel prep day. It actually wasn’t too bad but it definitely drained all my energy. They have you mix an entire bottle of laxative into 64 ounces of Gatorade, and drink it all.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I think the worst part about the bowel prep experience was not being able to eat all day lol.
</p>
<p>
DAY ONE (surgery day)
</p>
<p>
I went to sleep and arrived at the hospital at 7:15 AM. I was taken to the prep room really quickly where they gave me wipes to wipe down my whole body for disinfectant reasons, I changed into my gown, and talked to all the nurses. at this point, I feel like I should mention that I’ve never had a surgery or anesthesia or anything before so I was a little bit nervous. Dr. Hanna came in and talked to me a bit about the procedure, answered any questions I had, and then he left. In about 15 minutes, the anesthesiologist came in and gave me a muscle relaxer through my IV which felt excellent. I started spacing out pretty quickly after that. They wheeled me to the OR, and I remember, transferring to the OR table and laughing, and making jokes with all the nurses, and then the anesthesiologist came in and gave me the rest of the anesthesia. I was out instantly, and it felt like I just blinked and was in the recovery room. It was hard to wrap my mind around.
</p>
<p>
I was pretty disoriented when I got to the room, but after a few hours I started feeling better.
</p>
<p>
I was able to order food, which was actually really good as soon as I got to the final room.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think my pain has ever been above a five out of 10 which has been great. I took a little bit of Oxsee and some Tylenol but my plan is to take the pain meds as little as possible. I own a company, so I’m trying to be as clear headed as I can, so I can work remotely.
</p>
<p>
As of right now, it’s 10:15 pm so about 12.5 hours after the surgery started. At this point my pain is about a three. I just feel this crazy pressure like I have to pee. Everything is still pretty numb down there though.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me anything. I’ll either update this post or Make another one tomorrow 🙂
</p>
<p>
DAY 2
</p>
<p>
I didn’t sleep very well because the nurses were coming in and out every hour or so last night to check my vitals, do bloodwork, etc. Dr. Hanna came in to talk to me around 7:30 am.  Today was actually harder than yesterday. The anesthesia is worn off by now so things are a bit more painful but still mostly manageable. My pain has been steady around 3-5 on the pain scale today, but there was one point where my nerves were reconnecting, and it felt like I got tazed in my hoo-ha, 9 or 10 on the pain scale. Not fun. I can also feel my stomach and digestive system waking up which is a little uncomfortable. I still haven’t been allowed out of my bed and I can’t really move my legs, so I’m getting very restless. I’m hoping to be able to get up tomorrow, but it could be as late as Sunday. I think I will feel much better when I’m allowed to walk around.
</p>
<p>
DAY 3
</p>
<p>
I needed some heavier pain pills to sleep last night, but I was able to get about 6 hours total. My biggest issues since yesterday evening has been gas buildup in my stomach. It’s been deeply uncomfortable and causes some nausea every once in a while. I can’t let it out because my body is numb from laying in the same spot since Thursday afternoon, so it’s just turning in my stomach. I really can’t stress enough how difficult it has been to not be able to move.  It’s also been difficult for me to eat today, but I’ve been in less pain. Mostly just focused on my stomach issues. Dr. Hanna came in and said that he would come in first thing in the morning tomorrow and take my dressing off and I can walk after that. My lower half is still in what is essentially a body cast. The nurses here are wonderful. We’ve been trying to blend of different meds, and I was able to take a three hour nap today. It’s been really rough and hard to stay positive but I’m getting through it. My mom just left to get me a smoothie in case that would help. I am hoping I can find a good cocktail of drugs to where I can get better sleep tonight. Edit: the smoothie saved my life. I got a super food smoothie from smoothie king and it was the most satisfying thing I’ve had this whole stay. I’m pretty much feeling better tonight. Can’t remember my last pain med. I’m cozying up with a movie. I’m gonna try to get some good sleep, as tomorrow is a big day getting the dressing off and walking.
</p>
<p>
DAY 4
</p>
<p>
I slept a lot better last night but the gas pain was still really really bad. I pretty much needed painkillers to sleep. Woke up this morning and still cannot stomach any food so I got more smoothie king and that helped a lot. Dr. Hanna came in at about 10:15 AM and took my dressing off. That sort of hurt but wasn’t a huge deal. I got to see my vagina for the first time and it looks incredible. My mom set up a mirror at the end of my bed, and I just sat there staring at it for almost an hour. I expected it to be really bruised and bloodied, but it was neither. It just looked really good. It was very emotional for me and it is taking a lot of brain power to process that this is actually mine. He wanted me to rest for a few more hours, and then get up at 2 and try to walk for the first time. I got some nausea and pain meds and passed out again. When I woke up, the nurse came in and helped me get up. This was by far the worst, most painful part of everything. My whole body was fatigued from laying in one spot, and it felt like every way I moved pulled on the surgical site. It took me about 10 minutes to get sat up on the side of the bed, and I had to sit for a little bit, because I got lightheaded. With the help of two people, I was able to eventually stand up and grab a hold of a walker. My mom said I went ghost white and I genuinely felt like I was gonna pass out. I slowly made way to the bathroom where I was finally able to take care of my stomach issues which felt a million times better. They switched out my sheets and I got back in bed and took a pain pill. After the pain from that experience subsided, it actually went down to about a 0 or 1 on the pain scale. Clearing my stomach made the biggest difference. I’m supposed to get up again this evening and I feel like I might be able to do that a bit easier. Tomorrow I’m discharged and go back to the hotel, so I really hope I’m ready to make that walk. Today was crazy but seeing it for the first time and seeing how good the results were made all of this worth it. I’m so incredibly happy. Day 4 edit: I was able to get up a second time and it was about 1000 times easier. I feel much more hopeful for tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
DAY 5
</p>
<p>
Discharge day! I asked the nurses last night to bother me less so I could get a good night&#39;s sleep. Since my vitals have been stable the whole time, they obliged. I was able to sleep undisturbed from 11pm to 5am when they came in and drained my catheter. I went back to sleep till 7 at which point they all came in to wake me up for vitals, meds, drain check, and breakfast. I ate about half an omelette (first solid food I could really stomach in 2 days) and watched TV. I got up and went to the bathroom which was surprisingly easy. I also changed out of my gown and into an extra oversized t-shirt in anticipation of the ride home. I sat on my donut pillow in the hospital recliner for the first time which was surprisingly comfortable. They came in and said I was ready to leave, so I packed everything up and waited on them to come by with the wheelchair and discharge paperwork. Dr. Hanna was off today so he didn&#39;t personally discharge me, but I got a call from one of his staff and he emailed me all the info I need. They were originally not gonna send me with a walker but I told them there was no way in hell I could make it to my hotel room without one so eventually they sourced one that I could take home. They brought me down to the entrance in a wheelchair at which point I got into my moms car. I had the seat all the way back so I was sitting on my tailbone and not the surgical site. We drove about 10 mins back to the hotel which was fine, but i was sort of using my legs and arms to lift myself up when she went over bumps. Having the window down and getting fresh air was AMAZING. I was able to walk from the car to the hotel room, but that definitely drained my energy for the day. I laid in bed for awhile with some pillows under my knees, and ate some chicken tenders from cane&#39;s which went down well. I was feeling REALLY good most of the day. Sadly, after getting up from the hotel bed about an hour later, I was in excruciating pain. I think I was putting more pressure on the surgical site than I realized, because it felt just as bad as it did 2 days ago. I made it to the bathroom and cried, a lot. I got myself to the office chair and have been sitting on my donut for about 30-45 mins which has been more tolerable. I think it will take some work to figure out how to be in bed comfortably. I&#39;m pretty wiped today, and I really look forward to getting these drains out because I think they are my main source of pain when moving. As far as the surgical site, I still have basically zero bruising, it hasn&#39;t swelled up much more than it was on day 3 when the packing came off, and it&#39;s only been bleeding a little bit which is a relief. That&#39;s about it for today, I&#39;m gonna go try to rest and find a way to get comfortable and get a good night&#39;s sleep.
</p>
<p>
Day 5 part 2 (night). Adding a second update for this day, because I had a significant breakthrough after posting the first part. I tried to rearrange my mountain of pillows and finally found an extremely comfortable position in bed. I had two pillows under my knees, and a weird slope of about 4 pillows behind my back, similar to the incline of the hospital bed. Once I was able to get into that spot, I started feeling amazing. My pain went down to a zero and for the first time, I felt happy and at peace. I played xbox and just enjoyed being comfortable and having all my comfort items around me (blankets, stuffed animals, music, games, etc). I got the best sleep I&#39;ve had all week! I passed out around 10 and woke up about 4 am needing to use the bathroom. I was scared to get up, but it was pretty easy (comparatively). Made it to the bathroom, and ended up walking around the room for a good 20-30 minutes which is definitely more than I walked before. All with no pain! As for the surgical site, my swelling has honestly been about the same since the end of day 3 which is great. Still no bruising really. There is a bit of bleeding from the canal area (I got minimal depth so I have like a 2-3 inch canal) but that has slowed quite a lot. I got back into bed and achieved all of that with minimal pain. Definitely took that as an accomplishment!
</p>
<p>
DAY 6
</p>
<p>
This morning was great. I feel like these updates will be just about the same until my next milestone in 2 days when I get my drains and catheter out. I woke up this morning and again had much more improvement in my movement, and also my mental clarity. I worked on my laptop at the hotel desk and took calls from 8:30 to 1:30 which was great. I needed to catch up on work badly. Around 1:30 though I felt drained and took a nap. My mom helped me wash my hair in the sink since I haven&#39;t showered in 6 days which felt AMAZING. I had my best friend come visit for awhile in the evening, sat on the couch for an hour or so (improvement there too), and now I&#39;m getting ready for bed. I&#39;m experiencing some increased swelling in the area above my vagina and it&#39;s currently my biggest source of pain but still very manageable. The swelling was putting tension on where the drains were taped down, so i re-taped the drains with more slack and that helped a bit. I sent an email to the clinic with a picture of the swelling just to be safe. I&#39;m very excited for my post-op appointment because these drains and this catheter are driving me absolutely insane. Overall, today was much better and I feel much more myself.
</p>
<p>
DAY 7
</p>
<p>
Today was about the same as yesterday but the big difference was that mentally I had much more energy. It was the first day I was able to work the whole day which was nice. I moved a lot less than I did yesterday because I felt like I overdid it and my swelling was bad. It’s been better today for sure.  I’ll have much more to report tomorrow after my post op. I think I’ll do updates tomorrow and the day after to document my journey home, and that’ll be it for these updates. I may make another post with a list of things that made it easier for me in the hospital and during the first week of recovery.
</p>
<p>
DAY 8 / 9
</p>
<p>
this is the last update that I’ll do on this post. I went to my postop appointment, which was my first time at Dr. Hanna‘s office. I got to meet all the other stuff that I have talked to on the phone for these past few months. Everyone was so sweet! I went into a room where he put my legs up in stirrups and talked to me about everything. This was a fun, lighthearted conversation. He pulled the drains out which I didn’t even feel, then pulled the catheter out which hurt but it was immediate relief when it was out. He handed me a mirror and pointed out different things to keep an eye on. It looks like I’m healing good so far! He also gave me some gel to apply daily to help with swelling. After that, I got dressed and went to the front where he took a Polaroid picture with me and gave me a copy. I got to choose a spot on the wall in his office for his copy. I had a pretty emotional moment where I hugged him and got to thank him for changing my life. It felt like an amazing way to finish out this first chapter of my recovery.  I went back to the hotel and could not believe how much easier and less painful everything is with the drains out. Huge difference! I took it easy though, as I was pretty tired, and woke up the next morning to do my 3 1/2 hour drive home. The drive was OK, I sat on my donut pillow with the seat pretty reclined and I made it fine. Note that I was a passenger, I didn’t personally drive. We only had to stop once.  I am now back home, and I feel thrilled to have made it through that week. That’s all for now, but feel free to comment on this at any time and ask me any questions I didn’t cover. ❤️

How did you prep for hair removal? I did my consult with him and he kinda said I don&#39;t need to worry about laser or electrolysis. I&#39;m probably going to do PI with as much depth as he can get (a blessing and a evil for sure).
</p>
<p>
Do you mind if I DM you my discord or Facebook? I&#39;m going to be getting my surgery either late this year or early next and have lot&#39;s more questions!!
</p>
<p>
Your 3-day post op looks amazing. So happy and proud for you (and jealous to be sure)..

Thank you! To me, having the canal was not even close to worth all the extra trouble that it is. I only date women, and have no interest in being penetrated. This way, I don’t have to dilate or do hair removal. Seems like the quickest recovery. I own a Business so I just wanna get back to my life as soon as I can

I have no idea honestly lol. I didn’t really ask many questions. I’m super happy with the results though and I’m only three weeks in! I would 1000% recommend him to anybody

Thank you! I’m not even sure the different methods of minimal depth. I think I have like, two or 3 inches depth maybe?

I guess what I mean is the process, like what parts he uses to create different parts and what if any does he throw away

I gotcha! Yeah, no idea. I will say though I don’t think he used much if any scrotal skin which I’m happy about. I’ve seen some results were the labia majora have the texture of a scrotum and that’s just not appealing to me. I posted my results on my profile too if you’re curious. Wish I knew more!
