Does any have experience with Dr. Bastidas in New York City?
</p>
<p>
I had work done with his last year and have had some miscommunications. Hoping to speak to someone who has worked with him!

stay away. multiple friends have had repeated complications and revisions with him. I lucked out with minimal issues, but only because I chose to have minimal work done with him in the first place.
</p>
<p>
his entire team is terrible about handling insurance paper work, scheduling follow ups, misgendering you both pre and post op, the list goes on; it&#39;s an office run by transmisogynists. I wouldn&#39;t let Bastidas anywhere near my face again.
</p>
<p>
I had a second round of more detailed work (lower third) done by Dr. Rodriguez at NYU 6 months later and I sincerely wish he&#39;d done everything; not a single issue with him or his team from consult to post op appts.

This is crazy. Right now the bottom of my chin has been leaking pus because of a reaction to a titanium plate I got for genioplasty. His office forgot to submit the request for insurance coverage. Then they did send one when I called 3 weeks later and they lied saying it was my insurances fault. But my insurance said they received nothing. When they finally sent it they made mistakes and it got denied... and they didn&#39;t bother submitting an appeal until I annoyed them on the phone. 6 months later its approved but they haven&#39;t called for scheduling the surgery. It&#39;s been so stressful

yep, same exact thing happened to me with Bastida&#39;s office &#34;forgetting to submit&#34; my insurance docs. I, too, waited 3 weeks before finally figuring this out and their response was &#34;we tried calling you&#34; (they never did).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really sorry to hear about the genio issues you&#39;re facing. my friend had a similar issue with the titanium mesh plate in her forehead (type 3 forehead reduction) dislodging completely and creating a literal square bulge in her forehead. Bastidas denied any wrongdoing, complication, or fault for months.

largely shit work; unskilled, negligent, and sloppy bordering on malpractice from what I&#39;ve seen and heard lately. and of course, he allows medical students to practice on us without any consent or disclosure. I&#39;ve told everyone I know to avoid him entirely, and wouldn&#39;t recommend his work unless you&#39;re ready to experience complications followed by multiple rounds of revisions.
