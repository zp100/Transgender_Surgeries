The big news in this update is that my vaginal canal is finally close to healed!  Gyn reports seeing no granulation tissue which I find amazing.  Here are two pics from my gyn visit 12-16:

Compare that to these various pics from the last few months where the entrance was so red and swollen it showed up in external photos.  I can no longer get a picture of the entrance from any angle I try because the swelling is down so much:
</p>

</p>
<p>
8-31 was one day before stopping steroid cream.  By 10-19 it had gotten so much worse.  I had little trouble getting in the blue dilator when I was on steroids but once I stopped it got harder and harder to reach full depth. Yet it didn&#39;t hurt too much to push it in so I just kept going with it thinking it would loosen back up eventually.
</p>
<p>
12-1 is after 3 weeks of estrogen cream.  I stopped using the blue dilator 11-9 and stopped the larger purple 6 days later and started steroids again.  So now I&#39;m starting with the smallest purple and then the orange dilator.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy beyond belief that it&#39;s finally looking almost normal.  Even though there wasn&#39;t much pain when it was looking so terrible, the fact it looked so damaged and unnatural bothered me deeply.  I didn&#39;t think it could ever look normal and I&#39;m so grateful it was able to heal so well.  Gyn says the tissue is still thin in the first couple inches of the canal, so there&#39;s still some pain during dilation, esp towards the entrance, but it&#39;s getting gradually less and it&#39;s never been above a 1/10.  I&#39;d describe it as &#34;sore&#34;.  But she says the tissue deeper in looks great and my labia skin is looking good too.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also happy my labia pain has been way down.  Some days there&#39;s no pain at all.  Sometimes it feels stiff but doesn&#39;t hurt.  Generally if I sit to drive it gets a little irritated or if I pull the lips apart to soap between it gets more painful to touch but never above a 1/10 anymore.  But sometimes I can drive for hours and not notice any pain getting in and out of the car and that never used to be true.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been peeing straight down more often and that&#39;s also surprisingly nice to experience.  It feels so much more natural than when it goes off to the sides.  I think this means swelling is down and I seem to pee straight down most consistently shortly after using ice on my labia.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been wearing panty liners again to monitor how much discharge there is and it&#39;s much less than before the gyn visits.  Amounts are definitely small enough to be caught without liners.  The color is often more light yellow than light brown, which we think means there&#39;s less &#34;old blood&#34; or dried blood mixed in.  I think a lot of my discharge before gyn was likely coming from granulation tissue rather than transudate.  The discharge used to make my labia sticky but that&#39;s pretty much entirely gone now.  Things also smell a lot better.  The smell on my dilator is now faint whenever I&#39;ve checked and it used to make my nose crinkle.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve continued dilating only at night.  This didn&#39;t cause things to tighten up as it always used to with the larger dilators and every dilation session has been about the same level of ease to reaching full depth.  It still takes 3-5 mins to get it in all the way and I&#39;m very careful not to push when I feel pain.  I feel like I have a lot more time in my day when I don&#39;t have to always start with an hour of dilation.  Unfortunately, Megan did say once I start trying to size up again it might go faster to return to twice a day.
</p>
<p>
12-4 I decided to inject estrogen cream before dilation instead of after.  I leave the injector in for 1-2 mins, hold my legs closed to keep it in while I lubricate the dilator, then quickly remove injector and plug the canal with the dilator.  This should keep more of the cream inside and the dilator should help it spread and get deeper.  The gyn said I should also put some on my finger and rub it in around the first couple inches where the skin is thin.  I had to trim one of my nails short to do this.  It was the first time I&#39;ve put a finger in there and it actually felt really nice.  So smooth and the sensations were pleasant.  Unfortunately, I can only rotate my finger about 30 degrees both ways so I felt like I wasn&#39;t really rubbing it in everywhere.
</p>
<p>
I later tried putting two 1cm long lines of cream on the smallest purple dilator and inserting it so the lines fit between the labia so they didn&#39;t completely rub off on the cream before it reached the vaginal canal.  Then I get the dilator in a couple inches of the canal and rotate it to rub in the cream.  I think it works better than the finger.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of rotation, I wonder if my tendency to rotate the dilators to spread lubricant was also making it more likely to wrap a hair around the dilator and pull it deeper.  Then it would get caught on sticky granulation tissue and get pushed deeper every time I dilated.  I was also given steroid cream that is really thick and sticky and could have made it more likely to catch a hair and draw it in.  It still really bothers me none of the doctors have heard of hair getting stuck in there.  What makes me so special?  There was no new hair at the last gyn visit since I&#39;ve been taking photos before every dilation.  I still find a hair that could potentially get pulled in by the dilator once or twice a week, though it&#39;s been a few weeks since I found one really curled up between labia.  Maybe less sticky discharge is preventing them from getting pulled in like that.  I also switched from using a &#34;furry&#34; blanket that traps hair to using a microfiber blanket that hair doesn&#39;t stick to.  Since I put the blanket between my knees when I sleep on my side, I hope this means fewer hairs getting near my kitty.
</p>
<p>
EDIT:  Someone in the comments below said they spoke to docs at Planned Parenthood who&#39;ve seen hair compaction in cis women so it&#39;s not as unheard of as it seemed.  But Dr. Wittenberg started as a GYN so it&#39;s weird they haven&#39;t heard of it, or maybe she just didn&#39;t tell Megan.  I&#39;m surprised cis women would be pushing things all the way inside often enough to get hair compaction but maybe it builds up very slowly with vibrator use or something.  I&#39;m going to ask my GYN next time if she&#39;s ever seen it before.  She acted surprised when she found it in me so I assumed she hasn&#39;t seen it but maybe I misinterpreted.
</p>
<p>
12-8 I had the 9 month followup with Mozaiccare.  Megan said she&#39;s never heard of hair getting compacted in the vaginal canal, either.  She said a lot of patients have done internal PT even with granulation tissue and it didn&#39;t seem to cause problems.  She didn&#39;t want to completely go against the gyn&#39;s advice of waiting till dilation was completely pain free but said I should start internal PT in a week or two if pain level didn&#39;t change.  She also said they haven&#39;t noticed thinning of vaginal lining with prolonged steroid use and that most patients continue it for about 3 months, so my 2.5 months of use wasn&#39;t overkill like I thought.
</p>
<p>
12-15 the physical therapist noticed the scars on my belly from the surgery and started working on them.  She found a painful lump to the right of belly button around where the nearest scar is there.  She worked on it for quite a few mins, sometimes hurting up to 4/10.  She worked on the scar on my left side but it didn&#39;t have nearly as much scar tissue internally.  The two scars near my hips didn&#39;t really need any work at all - she couldn&#39;t feel scarring beneath them, nor did she do much with my belly button scar.  Although I&#39;ve never had belly pain after the surgery, she said getting rid of the scar tissue there was important because it could cause problems long term.   She also said I could massage my belly at home in small, firm circles.
</p>
<p>
After finishing the belly work, it barely felt sore.  She applied heat and TENS and when I got up my belly felt oddly stiff but not painful.  The sensation mostly went away after ~20 mins but when I got home and lay on my back, I reached towards my feet for my blanket and when I pulled it, a muscle around where she worked most tightened painfully and wouldn&#39;t release for about a minute.  It wasn&#39;t as painful as a charlie horse but hurt maybe 3/10.  It didn&#39;t happen again even after other visits, though I had to be careful not to use that muscle much the first few days.
</p>
<p>
12-17 PT did internal work for the first time after gyn said it was ok.  She spent about 10 mins, took a break, then 10 more mins.  Gyn said not to stretch the diameter of the tissue (I think PT sometimes involves putting in two fingers and stretching them apart) so she used a single finger and pushed at various places internally.  It was hard to tell exactly what places she was going for but I&#39;m guessing places that felt stiff, tight, or hard.  I felt the usual soreness when she first inserted, and as she pushed things it hurt up to a 2 or 3/10, but after a few mins it was never over 1/10.  After awhile it started to feel kind of good and I had to really focus on my breathing to try and prevent getting aroused which I was afraid would make things more tight.
</p>
<p>
At some points she told me to tighten the pelvic floor or try to push her finger out.  Then she told me to relax and I could feel the pressure releasing around her finger.  She said I did well with that and a lot of people take a lot longer to learn to relax.  I&#39;m starting to learn to do the same thing when I dilate, though it doesn&#39;t help all that much so far.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the second session she found some blood so we stopped.  That eve there was no unusual pain or blood on the dilator.  I asked if it was possible to do internal PT at home and she said not really.  Though I&#39;ve seen online videos where therapists tell people to do internal stuff...  but things are probably too delicate with me so far.
</p>
<p>
12-20 more internal PT.  It was hurting labia more than anything whenever she rotated her hand around so I asked her to put lubricant on the labia and that helped a lot.  Unfortunately when she put her finger back in she did it too quickly and there was a somewhat sharp pain.  Then there was a little blood so she stopped after only 5 mins.  She messaged the gyn asking if she should continue under those circumstances, then worked on labia.
</p>
<p>
She said it wasn&#39;t really blood but &#34;
<a href="https://www.osmosis.org/answers/serosanguineous">serosanguineous fluid</a>
&#34; which is thin, watery, and pink.  It&#39;s released by tiny capillaries near the surface of healing tissue and has some blood and other fluids mixed together.  I showed her the picture the gyn had taken with the speculum in so she could see where the fluid might be coming from.  I think that made her confident enough to try again.  She kept going another 5 mins or so and get less fluid but didn&#39;t want to keep pushing it.  She said it&#39;s pretty typical to get some of that fluid during internal PT but she still worried in my case.  Again, no dilator blood or pain that night.
</p>
<p>
I emailed Mozaic asking if I should stop steroid cream since gyn hadn&#39;t found granulation and they agreed it would be best to stop, so I didn&#39;t use it last night.  Now I&#39;m worried things might tighten again like last time, but hopefully not.  I&#39;ve got 3 more PT visits and one more gyn before I switch back to Kaiser insurance and then I&#39;ll have to get used to a new set of doctors.  Fun.  I hope they authorize me to continue PT because it&#39;s helped a lot.

1-18-22 update (45 weeks, 10.4 months post-op):
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/m9a2s68q0jc81.png?width=1425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ccc6b6476427bd9546850201e55c7530b5449c9">https://preview.redd.it/m9a2s68q0jc81.png?width=1425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ccc6b6476427bd9546850201e55c7530b5449c9</a>
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t wanted to post an update because I injured myself and it made me very depressed to think about it so writing an update was too painful.  I also wanted to wait until it resolved so I could talk about the healing process and how it led to a happy ending, but it&#39;s been 4 weeks since my last update and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely that waiting another week will make much difference.
</p>
<p>
Around Christmas I had more free time than usual so before bed I decided to masturbate.  I didn&#39;t have my vibrator so I wasn&#39;t sure I could climax, but I came in around 15 mins with just my finger on my clit and it was pleasant.  I haven&#39;t had a really powerful orgasm since my first one after surgery, for whatever reason.  So self pleasure has become a really minor part of my life.    Reaching climax used to be pretty important but now the combination of estrogen and advancing age have made it feel generally unnecessary.  Even when I&#39;m with other people I don&#39;t feel much need to orgasm and it usually seems like more trouble than it&#39;s worth.
</p>
<p>
The next night (12-25) I still had free time so decided to masturbate again.  This time little things kept distracting me and breaking the mood.  After 45 mins I really broke the mood and got up to pee feeling really frustrated that it was so easy the night before and thinking I should give up.  But when I got back in bed I foolishly decided to continue.  I tried really flicking my clit fast mostly left and right using a finger that had my nail trimmed down to nothing so I didn&#39;t think I could hurt myself.  I lost track of how long I spent but I reached this odd state where touching felt really good but I still couldn&#39;t climax.  I stayed in that state for a few mins and then it slipped away and I felt fairly sated and decided that was enough.
</p>
<p>
After going to shower I came back to find a three-inch-wide pool of blood in the bed.  That was scary so I took photos and couldn&#39;t see where it had come from other than a really tiny red spot right of my clit.  Nothing hurt.  Looking at the clock I&#39;d been rubbing myself for about two hours total that night.  I went to bed disturbed.
</p>
<p>
12-26: Still no pain but it got really red and swollen to the left and right of the clit and the labia looked swollen too.  I finally felt some pain after dilating that evening, maybe because the estrogen cream was irritating the red skin.
</p>
<p>
12-27: Sometimes when I stood up I would feel a burning at both sides of the clit that could last a couple mins. Went to physical therapy and did internal work as normal.
</p>
<p>
12-28: Clit had tilted to point about 30 degrees to the right.  I hoped this was just swelling that would go down.
</p>
<p>
12-30: Clit still pointing right.  Saw PT and gyn who both said they thought it would go back to normal when swelling went down but couldn&#39;t guarantee it.  I sent a message to Mozaic asking if the problem was permanent and if I could do anything to heal it right.  As days went by my mood sank lower and lower, feeling I&#39;d gone from finally healing well to creating what might be a permanent injury.  All because I foolishly kept trying to reach orgasm.  But I also felt a profound sense of unfairness.  It hadn&#39;t hurt and I had no idea I was damaging anything.  I returned to various dark thoughts and frequent depression...  I don&#39;t dare masturbate and even getting aroused made me nervous the first 2+ weeks.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Mozaic replied on Tue, 1-4 basically saying the same thing gyn said and only suggesting ice and ibuprofen as possible things that might help.  I felt a little better they didn&#39;t say like &#34;oh you tore something and it will require surgery to fix&#34; which is what I was afraid of and why I didn&#39;t email them sooner.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/krnh2j3cfzc81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04666dabda874d6d383d5c2b65fd4e364c08a268">https://preview.redd.it/krnh2j3cfzc81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04666dabda874d6d383d5c2b65fd4e364c08a268</a>
</p>
<p>
But now it&#39;s about two weeks later and there&#39;s still little sign of improvement.  Some days (like 1-11 above) the clit is turned at least 60 degrees, and this happens most after driving so I&#39;ve been afraid to sit when not absolutely necessary.  Instead I lay on my back with legs spread hoping it will help but it doesn&#39;t improve things much.  Most often it looks about like the 1-3 photo.
</p>
<p>
1-13: I was sitting at an odd angle in my car to use my laptop to the right of the steering wheel while waiting for someone for about two hours.  At some point my clit area started hurting and I had to keep shifting trying to alleviate it.  When I got home there was blood towards the top of my panty liner.  I couldn&#39;t tell where it had come from in photos.  But that broke me again and had me crying in SO&#39;s arms for awhile.
</p>
<p>
Feeling with my finger, the area to the right of the clit is still swollen/harder and can still hurt a bit to push on.  But if I push it enough I can get the clit to pop forward again so I think it&#39;s the swelling there that&#39;s messing things up the most.  On 1-2 I started gently pushing that area for a couple mins each night during dilation because the PT had said you want to push skin a bit during healing so it remains pliable but don&#39;t push too hard so it can&#39;t heal.  I&#39;ve probably been pushing too hard because it doesn&#39;t seem to have changed much the last two weeks.  I realized I was pushing harder and longer each night as I grew more desperate to see any sort of improvement so I have to force myself to back off and maybe only push a little twice a week.  EDIT: My former PT responded to an email and thinks I shouldn&#39;t push on it at all.
</p>
<p>
I do think there&#39;s been an improvement in how easy it is to get clit to face forward and I think it stays forward longer (like, maybe until I put my legs together) now than it used to, so I have at least a little hope but also a lot of fear that it will prefer to tuck itself sideways forever.
</p>
<p>
Because of my health insurance change I haven&#39;t been able to see another doctor and I think a PT is the only one that might have some insight on how to try to help healing.  As of last Fri, PT referral was still pending.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Besides all that bad stuff, my 12-30 gyn visit went well.  Labia and skin inside entrance looked much better.  She was able to stretch me farther and see in deeper, which revealed some granulation deep in that she treated with silver nitrate.  I asked if she&#39;d ever seen compacted hair in another patient and she said no.  She said despite the granulation I should stay off steroids.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/daquralfazc81.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3106190c489ea481ac71995e94485b6fc29d81cd">https://preview.redd.it/daquralfazc81.png?width=1356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3106190c489ea481ac71995e94485b6fc29d81cd</a>
</p>
<p>
I still feel like she&#39;s not doing silver nitrate the right way because it left a lot of damaged looking skin on the inside, far from vaginal canal (see 12-31 pic).  The evening after silver nitrate I found blood on my panty liner and in photos it was lingering around the canal, possibly because of moving around playing Beat Saber?  I wasn&#39;t bleeding the first time she did silver nitrate.  Either way, it all resolved over the next few days.  I skipped dilation for 3 nights after the nitrate and didn&#39;t lose depth when I returned to it, but it was more painful than usual for about a week.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve only ever found a hair really bunched up between my labia once since I started watching for it, and that was shortly before the first silver nitrate treatment.  So I&#39;m wondering if the granulation tissue oozing sticky crap was the main reason hair was getting pulled in and stuck between labia to then get pushed up into the canal by dilation.  I do still get panty liners sticking to my labia even now, less than before, but I discovered that giving them a swipe with the anti-friction stick will prevent sticking for the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m growing frustrated by lack of progress in other areas again.  Labia don&#39;t usually hurt much but their pain level hasn&#39;t changed obviously in the last month.  My dilation experience also seems stagnant.  Some nights it hurts more than others but it never fails to hurt at least a little, nor does it seem to get any looser/easier to get the dilators in.  Sometimes I think the skin inside feels tougher in some way when I spin the dilators around to spread the estrogen cream but it&#39;s hard to tell.  I&#39;m afraid to try to size up without getting another gyn exam.  I think the big labia scars have softened in the last month by rubbing them every other night.  And cleaning labia in shower is finally pretty consistently pain free for whatever reason and that feels quite nice.  I&#39;ve also had a lot fewer days where I notice labia pain when I roll over in bed or get up in the morning.
</p>
<p>
Also, I felt like it was misleading to label this entry as 11.25 months post op because that means I would hit 12 months on 2-8 which is about a month before the actual 12-month anniversary of the surgery.  So instead of labeling each entry as if each month is 4 weeks long, I now assume each month is 4.345 weeks long which is the true average number of weeks per month.  I also added number of weeks since surgery to each entry and multiply number of weeks by 0.230136 to get the number of months.

This is SO thorough! Thank you for taking the time and sharing this!

Currently debating between Wittenberg and McGinn. The PPT is obviously main reason for Wittenberg but McGinn seems to be known as the “vagician” so I’m still figuring that out haha (any advice appreciated of course!)
</p>
<p>
I am curious about the required hair removal…? My understanding is PPT requires less but was curious your experience with that.
</p>
<p>
How was working with Wittenberg and team in general? (I know this post is much further along than that but curious if you don’t mind! 🥰)
</p>
<p>
Congrats hun!!!!!

Since I was determined to get peritoneal, I didn&#39;t look at McGinn.  The only thing I seem to remember seeing in passing is her bedside manner is terrible (she came from a military surgeon background) but she does good work.  Unless I&#39;m confusing her with someone else.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, everything with Dr. Wittenberg has been great.  The only significant complaint I can think of offhand is they should have said seeing a local gyn was mandatory instead of just a suggestion, but they&#39;ve actually changed their policy on that so all is well.  Maybe they should also stress more how important it is to do some walking and sitting after the first couple months of healing or you get scar tissue and need physical therapy.  It&#39;s better to cause a little pain during healing to avoid long term pain.  I was terrified of dehiscence and kept too sedentary.  There&#39;s a fine balance between enough movement and too much, especially early on.  Plus with 3 hours of dilation per day it&#39;s really hard to have time for walking as well once you&#39;re trying to return to work.  But I could have done some sitting.
</p>
<p>
If you look back at my part 1 entry I think I talk in more detail about my pre-op experience with Mozaiccare.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think Dr. Wittenberg requires any hair removal for PPTV at this point.  At the very least she said if my hair removal wasn&#39;t complete by the time my date came around, it was fine.  There is no medical reason you need hair removal for PTPV.  For me, I&#39;m super glad complete hair removal was not needed because I would have waited probably another year for surgery.  My body seems especially good at making more hair and I&#39;m still getting facial hair regrowth after two years.
</p>
<p>
If you look back at my part 1 there&#39;s a link to a research paper I wrote about PPTV.  I strongly recommend it and it&#39;s certainly worth picking among the surgeons that offer it.
</p>
<p>
Thanks and good luck!

I admit that I haven&#39;t read the entire post, but I really need to get to bed, so I&#39;ll have to do it in the morning... BUT
</p>
<p>
Why was your mind set on peritoneal?

Awesome update as always! I’m in the process of fighting with my insurance about hair removal :/ despite getting all the prior auth BCBS is still trying to say it’s not medically necessary.
</p>
<p>
As for the internal hair, I actually showed your last update to a couple of providers I work with (planned parenthood) who acted like it was completely normal and have seen compacted hair in more than one cis woman’s vagina. If that’s worth anything lol.

Thanks so much for letting me know about the hair!  I was starting to feel like a freak of nature to be the only one with that problem.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m surprised Blue is fighting you on hair removal.  I had no trouble getting it authorized but Blue has zero electrologists in their network.  They say to see a dermatologist but I looked into about 30 of them and only one did electrolysis.  Then after fighting with the dermatologist for hours on the phone to accept it was medically necessary hair removal (they said their system wouldn&#39;t allow them to mark it that way and bill insurance) they finally just gave me an appointment and said let the doctor decide if they want to try to bill insurance.  When I finally spoke to the doctor, she said they haven&#39;t done electrolysis in a couple years.  And if you go outside Blue&#39;s network they don&#39;t cover the hair removal until you reach your deductible so it&#39;s pretty useless.  This is a big part of why I&#39;m returning to Kaiser with electrologists in their network.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if you&#39;re getting PPTV then hair removal really isn&#39;t medically necessary so maybe that&#39;s why they&#39;re fighting it?

Surprisingly getting an in network dermatologist was the easiest step for me, I get my HRT through Washington university and my doctor had a referral in the same building. Although they’ll be performing laser and not electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
I have BCBS MO and not CA so idk if that changes anything. I’m hoping once we get this appealed and the ball starts rolling the next steps will be easier 😩 ironically they had no issues covering my second video visit with Dr. Wittenberg last week.
</p>
<p>
I just looked at the letter her office sent me in regards to hair removal and the exact wording is “I require, along with most gender-affirming surgeons, that patients undergo 6-12 months of genital and perineal hair removal in order to prevent post-operative complications.” so I can’t imagine my insurance being savvy enough about different vaginoplasty procedures to deny it for being PPT.

Finding dermatologists who offer laser hair removal isn&#39;t difficult with Blue here either, but laser is not permanent enough for penile inversion and won&#39;t affect light or thin hairs.  So you need electrolysis.  And my electrologist warned me once you do laser you should wait 6 or 9 months before surgery because laser is more likely to damage hair follicles but not kill them so they grow back 6 or 9 months later.  If you do laser at the proper power level the chance of regrowth is a lot less but lots of places like to milk you (or insurance) for money by using low settings so you need more treatments.  With electrolysis, as long as you don&#39;t feel a pain when they pull out the hair you can be pretty sure they did it right.  Laser offers no such way of knowing other than you need the right power levels.  If they&#39;re using an Alexandrite laser, make sure they&#39;re willing to go up to 21 or 22J.  Most places won&#39;t go that high and will make all sorts of excuses but don&#39;t believe them - they just want more money.  If they don&#39;t use Alexandrite and you have dark hair and light skin, look for another place.  Other laser frequencies are not as effective.
</p>
<p>
But if you&#39;re going for PPTV then laser hair removal is fine even if it ends up being not that effective long term.  It&#39;s waaaay less painful than electro and way faster.  But laser still needs to hurt to be effective long term.  Places that brag of being painless won&#39;t keep the hair away for long.

Yeah I’m happy about PPTs hair removal requirements, I’m only having 6 months of laser (gentle max pro) and should be fine. My pre auth cleared for 12 sessions but I guess it’ll just depend on how many we fit in before June. The provider who did my first visit seemed earnest but thanks for the advice!

Gentle Max is a good option since it has both Alexandrite and YAG lasers to handle multiple shades of skin.  That reminds me a big problem with using laser on genitals is there is a lot of variation in skin tone down there and more areas of darker skin than you find on the face and other body parts.  So you generally can&#39;t go as high power without burning the skin (as I showed in one of my entries) and so it&#39;s not as good at killing the hair down there permanently.  Burning skin pigment a little isn&#39;t necessarily bad because it will heal and leave the skin a lighter tone, but it can be overdone and cause white spots on the skin.  A lot of practitioners won&#39;t go into burning territory at all for fear of patient backlash but the laser person I work with has done it for 20+ years and has worked with me for around 2 years at this point so she knows I won&#39;t get angry if I&#39;m burned a bit.

Thank you for all your updates. ^_^ I had the same surgery with Wittenberg at the end of November, and am recovering now.

It&#39;s going ok, so far. It&#39;s been about a month since surgery. I
</p>
<p>
have labia minora separation at the entrance to the vagina, but otherwise am very pleased with how things are looking. That said, I&#39;m trying to wean off full time icing, as well as gabapentin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, and I think I might have gone a bit too quickly. Things feel very swollen, sore and achy, whereas they felt fine a week ago.
<br>
I was cleared to start up-gauging starting yesterday. I got the purple #1 dilator in full depth (The last dot towards the handle is about ~.75cm from the entrance), which was great. But now things are so sore and achy that I&#39;m not even bothering with the purple one, and I&#39;ve even cut back my walking a bit. I&#39;m going to up the OTC pain killers again for a few more days.

I feel like I know you so well after reading this whole odyssey. This is an incredible resource. Have you collected all this in one place for a better format? Anyway, I am deeply impressed at your consistency with documenting basically almost a year of surgery and healing. This is/was an amazing read, so thank you for all the work you&#39;ve done with your documentary here.

Thank you.  It&#39;s been a lot of work.  I try to write in a diary anything significant that happens, highlight things I want to talk about on Reddit, and then I read through the diary when I&#39;m updating reddit to make sure anything important gets talked about.  Sometimes I wonder how many people will find it and bother to read it, but it still feels worth it even if only a few people are helped.
</p>
<p>
I do plan to post some sort of summary with what I think is most important to know but I don&#39;t feel like I can do that till I&#39;m fully healed and dilated to a reasonable size.  What I thought was the right thing to do for healing when I started is rather different to what I think now, and I&#39;m about to start new health insurance with new doctors that will probably teach me even more.
