Figured I’d share this:

It’s a negative review of FFS by Jeffrey Spiegel but upon further investigation, the surgery was actually performed by Sarah Saxon and not Spiegel

Yup, she was a resident with Spiegel. Dr. Saxon once was high up on my list of preferred FFS surgeons, but that review was a enough reason for me to delete both Spiegel and Saxon from the first tier.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, my initial contact with her back office (which was before I learned about that particular review on RealSelf) was less than underwhelming, to put it cautiously.

Hi! I know this is a super old post, but can you share more about your contact with her? I looked into her work recently and am on the fence about moving forward with a consultation with her (which is $300).

For anyone else checking this realself review
<a href="https://www.realself.com/review/boston-ma-chin-surgery-ruined-face?sort=oldest" rel="nofollow">ruined my face - Boston, MA
</a>
, Dr Saxon is named in the followup &#34;A little update&#34; image as one of the surgeons
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A little update, here are portions of my surgical notes I requested directly from Boston Medial Center. The resident is all over them in every portion. My interaction was mostly with the resident not the surgeon I hired. This might explain why my jaw is uneven and lopsided. It also states that JS was president during “critical portions” of the case. I have still yet to get it revised. I planning to do so soon. Going here was the biggest mistake.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And the op&#39;s comments in the image says
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
These are my surgical notes I requested directly from Boston Medical Center
</p>
<p>
Note where it says Surgeons: Sarah Saxon is a resident and I was unaware she would be touching my face
</p>
<p>
Also in the surgical notes from BMC, Jeffry Spiegel was present for &#34;critical portions&#34; of this case.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There&#39;s been quite a few complaints about Spiegel for this reason. Apparently he runs a business teaching FFS. More in the wiki.

Thank you for the engagement! Someone else got on me for “doxxing” Her office manager and reported me to the mods. I didn’t see it that way and maybe it’s my ignorance around doxxing but this offices Employees as well as Dr. Saxon’s info is all public as healthcare providers. Just wanted to share for anyone who can avoid this exact issue. I was lucky in that I was told by many surgeons before that I didn’t need much… Dr. Saxon however really fed on my Dysphoria abs would have done just about anything I feel

Twitter is broken right now but once it comes up, someone else had major complications with Sara Saxon that will cost 30k to fix. She has a whole thread pinned on her profile

Where did you hear of this Dr? Unfortunately there are a lot of surgeons right now who are trying to capitalize on gender affirming care.

She was actually recommended to me by a surgeon I trust. He was unaware of quite a few things I’ve now told him about and has stopped recommending her.

I&#39;m sorry. I definitely would recommend (if you&#39;re comfortable) sharing your story on the big Facebook FFS groups.
</p>
<p>
Looking into her background, Dr. Saxon is a facial plastics surgeon. Keep this in mind for the future.
</p>
<p>
FFS is not plastics alone. Plastics is manipulation of soft tissue. FFS is facial reconstructive surgery and you want surgeons who specializes in oralmaxillofacial/Craniofacial surgery as well as having a background as an ENT as they will be working on your sinus and airway as well.
</p>
<p>
A single fellowship from Jeffrey Spiegel is not a qualification. Just additional training on a singular way to perform said surgeries
