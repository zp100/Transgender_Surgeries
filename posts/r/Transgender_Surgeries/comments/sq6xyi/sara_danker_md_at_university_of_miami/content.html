For anyone using a LARGE organization like UHealth.
</p>
<p>
Get the provider(s) you’re seeking/using business card. S/he or their aide/fellow/nurse/scribe/tech will return your call.
</p>
<p>
Having used UHealth in the past I know firsthand that the “office” is in Miami/Cuban. Staffed by some very socially conservative people.

Looks like a new surgeon. Pretty risky.

Just had a consult with her today. From my understanding, she&#39;s not the one who performs the surgery, she does the urology work. I believe Dr. Fein does all the cosmetic work during GRS (at least for FtM procedures). Dr. Danker seemed very knowledgeable on the subject and seemed to know a lot about the procedure itself and I know that her and Dr. Fein have done a few publications on GRS, so I don&#39;t think they&#39;re inexperienced. I was told that they are not allowed to post photos online due to disclosure agreements, though I do wish that I could at least find some results on TransBucket or here on Reddit. I should have my consultation with Dr. Fein soon, so I hope that she will be able to show me some results since I was told they have done both quite a few surgeries. I&#39;ll likely make a post here once I get some more information together.
