I think they don’t want the extra work involved.

I&#39;m not sure why one would want them but I would say others are right and they may decline on the grounds of being a biohazard. I know mine had a biopsy after my bottom surgery. (It was interesting reading their findings.) I would say most first world surgeons probably would object on one way or another.

Chiming in here. I don’t begin to understand OP’s thought process on keeping body parts that one goes to such great lengths to eliminate, but, to each their own.
</p>
<p>
Will share that my ENDO facilitated the surgery arrangement. Beside the fact I hated them, mine were removed to relieve constant pain. All I wanted was to be rid of the damned things. Good riddance. I didn’t care what was done with them. They subsequently were biopsied and the report was made available to me in my medical records. Since the orchiectomy, I’ve never looked back.

I wanted to be rid of the bastards too because I never wanted them in the first place. It amused me to read the biopsy report and to think about how they were dissected.

No idea about that. I looked for the post and couldn&#39;t find it. I&#39;d say you&#39;re likely to have an uphill battle on this though.

Do a followup if you can! I&#39;ve actually been thinking about keeping mine after I get an orchi, for the very same reasons. Wishing you luck! &lt;3

Most surgeons send them off for a biopsy once they’re removed, plus they’re considered a biohazard. I really wouldn’t get your hopes up- it’s a huge thing to ask for.

Keeping body parts is a religious thing for some people and I doubt surgeons will refuse them. There’s defiantly been posts where people have taken them home.

I kept mine. It isn’t up to your surgeon— the hospital should have a chaplain who can help you if you want to keep them for religious reasons.

I would reach out to the chaplain independently and try to remove the surgeon from the convo entirely— I’ll be happy to dm you about details of my surgery specifically though

Surgeons probably going to be pretty annoyed at that point it’s very questionable having surgery with someone you’ve just upset like that.

Fair enough, I guess a more accurate and detailed way for me to say that would be:
</p>
<p>
The hospital probably has to examine your tested for cancer along with all the other organs they remove from people, before they would give them back to you. So you would be getting them back from whatever medical waste treatment area/dept the hospital has/uses, not your surgeon. The chaplain would probably be a good person to help make your claim for your organs back, and to allow you to communicate directly with the hospital department you would actually be getting them back from. In that sense, it really doesn’t concern your surgeon.

It&#39;s definitely possible to keep removed body parts. I got to keep my wisdom teeth in a little box after surgery and was actually asked if I wanted to keep them by the doctor, and my parents still have part of my umbilical cord somewhere with the very first outfit I wore as a newborn. My mom also has a polaroid picture of her uterus right after it was removed.

Is that legal in the US? I know in my country the protocol for disposal of biohazard residues would make something like that ilegal.

It doesn&#39;t matter, they are yours and if you are paying for the surgery, screw them and the ah that are asking you why. I don&#39;t have an opinion 1 way or the other...but they are yours, and if you want them...go for it
