I am scheduled for January 11th 2024 with RBBL and Zhao. She is incredible. I can’t imagine having anyone else do my procedure. I have a close friend who I have known since I was 16 years old. She had her procedure done by the “Butcher of Philadelphia”. She has to go back for nitrate strips and some vascular capsulation which is causing skin granularization. She also was given an OD of pain meds while in post op and needed Narcan to be revived. Her roommate had to try to revive her because the nurses were not so quick to respond. She was on a drip as well as being given oral meds. I wish I could have talked to her about what surgeon to use before she made her decision. Now she is in pain all the time and the final answer may need to be cauterization or some other very unpleasant procedure.

Pain meds are working well, I only took the full dose for the first day, by day 3 I only took one dose and hoping not to need any today.
</p>
<p>
I felt pretty prepared reading this forum from others experience, and the pre operation meetings they have for the patients. The only thing I didn’t buy that I feel I should have is a small usb fan, for whatever reason I was getting hot and cold and the fan would have helped while I was sweating. First day was more rough than I was expecting but I have been progressing very fast

Is it actually possible to actually move up in the schedule after attending their informational session and submitting your letters? My consult is scheduled for March 2024. It also sounds like even after the consult it will be another 12-18 months to have the surgery scheduled. There were over 100 people at the informational session and it just seems impossible to get in.
</p>
<p>
I had hoped to have another option besides Dr Kautzanis in Colorado, but it looks like if I want to have it done, he is the best option for me.

It is possible, I called almost daily to check on cancellations. However once I had my consult and they gave my the surgery date I really needed the time (18 months) to get all the laser hair removal done, I even had one last session two weeks prior to surgery. But if you are getting that done now I would say there are cancellations and the surgery date can be moved up. Good luck!

Yup! I originally submitted my information in September 2020, with an initial consult date of September 2021. I kept calling the office every week for cancellations, and in March 2021 I was able to find a consult for July 2021. My surgery was then scheduled for November 2022, and I kept that date. For reference, I had all of my letters initially and I had started but not yet completed my hair removal as of my consult date.

Hi! I had surgery with them last Thursday, so I&#39;m also happy to answer any questions. I&#39;m only a week further out, but I can tell you it&#39;s so much better every day you&#39;re out of the hospital.

What type did you opt for?  Hopefully the pain meds are working well.
</p>
<p>
Also, how prepared do you think you were now that you&#39;re on the other side?
