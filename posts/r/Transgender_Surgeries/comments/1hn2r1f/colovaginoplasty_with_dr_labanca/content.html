Hi, I am having a Colovaginoplasty in about a month with Dr labanca at IM clinic, and I would more than appreciate seeing or hearing results.
</p>
<p>
Generally from what I have heard she is supposed to great, that&#39;s what I saw generally in reviews, that&#39;s what a surgeon in my country told me when he asked who am I going to, that&#39;s the vibe I got from her every time we talked, and that&#39;s what I heard from the few people I found that did share publicly, and I even met one girl at Spain that told me that she got a Colovaginoplasty with Dr labanca, and that she did such a good job with her vagina, that no one she has ever been with was even able to tell that it wasn&#39;t a cis vagina. but even with all of that I would love, love, love! if someone would agree to show me theirs.
</p>
<p>
And yes I am planning to share how mine turned out.
</p>
<p>
(also I have one picture taken directly out of surgery of someone else if that&#39;s interesting to anyone, so dm me)

hi :) sorry for the late reply - i wanted to this before NYE but i didn&#39;t get @ :)
</p>
<p>
i had surgery at IM clinic in Barcelona on 14.11.23 with Dr. Labanca and Dr. Manero.
</p>
<p>
short story - i&#39;m extremely happy with the outcome.
</p>
<p>
long story, divided into short sections, since the long story is truly long :))
</p>
<p>
a) the pussy looks amazing, and i&#39;ve had this confirmation from everybody i&#39;ve shown her to. even my gynecologist was amazed of how natural it looks, so what more confirmation would i need, than from someone who&#39;s seen pussies for a job for her entire life?
</p>
<p>
b) the pussy gives amazing sensations - even though i couldn&#39;t get it myself to work except for a few times. luckily there are others who take care of this ;) i&#39;ve had a few orgasms during the last two years, but just two were by my own hands.
</p>
<p>
c) the clinic where the surgery took place is, for all intents and purposes, like a 5 stars hotel. the nurses were all amazing, even though they were spread kinda&#39; thin when i was there (i&#39;ve heard they got more people on board, so maybe that was solved in the past two years)
</p>
<p>
d) the doctors - both of them - were super professional and they did their job &#34;by the book&#34;, albeit their one-on-one time was limited, since they were performing surgeries around the clock. i got to see Dr. Labanca once, online, before the surgery and Dr. Manero on the day of the surgery. i didn&#39;t get much say in how i wanted the final result to look, but as i&#39;ve said in the beginning, the outcome was excellent, so i don&#39;t think my input would&#39;ve changed anything but, as i&#39;ve seen on reddit, people like to say what they want before surgery. if that&#39;s the case with you, maybe push a little for that - otherwise let them do their job and enjoy the results.
</p>
<p>
e) make sure to book an air bnb in the small town - sant antoni - close to the clinic. they suggest you book the apartments just by the clinic, but from my experience i wouldn&#39;t recommend those, since they&#39;re not close to ANY restaurant and the food delivery there is lacking to say the least. i mention this, because i didn&#39;t know it when i was there, so i booked a hotel room close to the clinic, just of the highway and for the two weeks i was there, i only ate grilled chicken breast because it was the only thing i could order online which i was allowed. had i been in the city, maybe i would&#39;ve had more options (from the very limited ones they allow you when you&#39;re discharged).
</p>
<p>
f) make sure somebody accompanies you and stays with you for the entire duration of the recovery. you can&#39;t do a lot of simple things for the first two - three weeks after. also, if you don&#39;t speak Spanish, bring someone who does, because when i was there, there was only one nurse who spoke a few words in english, so that could&#39;ve make things much more difficult than they had to be. luckily i was with someone speaking spanish and i found i nurse speaking romanian - so that helped a lot.
</p>
<p>
g) follow the instructions they give you to the letter - unlike me :D - if you want your recovery to be the safest, fastest and with the best possible outcome. i did start smoking one month after the surgery and, related or not, i had complications with some annoying granulation and a little wound dehiscence. they did solve it in a follow-up   surgery, at no extra cost - but that was no fun. in the end, my recovery took almost one year more than what they told me at the beginning, but i don&#39;t blame the IM clinic in any way. i was my weed/tobacco addiction which screwed things up.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot more to say about this, but i&#39;m trying to keep thins short and on-point.
</p>
<p>
Just as a POST SCRIPTUM - i heard while i was there, that Dr. Manero and Dr. Labanca are the go-to doctors in Europe for fixing other doctors&#39; screwups, so that&#39;s saying a lot by itself.
</p>
<p>
I wish the best of luck to you, and my you find exactly what you&#39;re looking, after the surgery. For me, even with the extra complications and extra off-line time, i can say without any doubt, that choosing IM Clinic and they staff was by far the best decision i&#39;ve made vis-a-vis my transgender journey, which started 7 years ago.

Thank you! So far I talked with Dr labanca 3 times in video calls and she is well aware of what I want, I did book the apartment next door, and I don&#39;t have someone who speaks Spanish sadly...
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t understand what type you had, cause you were complaining about having nothing but grilled chicken, and I was told that post and pre op I will have a low residue diet (that mostly allows grilled chicken with my pickiness)... And what do you mean one year more than they said it would take? How long they said?
</p>
<p>
I really appreciate another good feedback right before going there next week, so thank you very very much!
</p>
<p>
Edit: I saw your posts, and you can&#39;t really see how it looks from the one you have a picture at, I would really appreciate if you would agree to share with me in dms, but would 100% understand if you wouldn&#39;t want that...
