I did my research on this dude. He is very experienced despite being new. I will need to be in hospital for 3 days and 4 days at a hotel nearby. No need for electrolysis before surgery as he will take care of pubic hair during surgery. I‚Äôm stoked! I‚Äôm super relieved because like I can‚Äôt keep going with the wrong parts anymore üòé

I‚Äôm very concerned about the fact he says that there is no need for electrolysis, I‚Äôve seen on this sub Reddit many doctors (who I won‚Äôt name publicly) say they will take care of it in the operating room and then the patients end up having some major internal hair complications down the road.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm not saying this to scare you but just be certain that you are aware that it can be a risk, hopefully it doesn‚Äôt happen!

Please be careful, there&#39;s a reason 99% of doctors tell you that ALL the hair must be gone. Those &#34;barely&#34; hair might re-grow after the procedure and at that point they&#39;ll be infinitely more difficult to deal with.

No him he constructed my urethra because he had a ‚Äúurology ‚Äú background  he dismissed everything from day 8 post op when the issues started occurring and made it seem impossible for it to be happening refused ct and MRI  one thing after the next dismissal after dismissal honestly post op it was hard to speak to her (dr rumer)  and the only way i know for fact is because i have my operative report listing him and the voice memos of him stating what part of the procedure he did and dismissing these at the time very serious complications  but every surgery goes different i pray the best i had great results to for 1 week and trama for 2 years later and he helped regardless in the process ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i cant just blame one i have to blame both its only fair because he was the only other ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù listed

I‚Äôm confused, he is the one that constructed your uretra but is listed as an assistant? Something doesn‚Äôt seem right. I‚Äôm sorry your experiencing this. But I think your anger is directed at the wrong person.
</p>
<p>
I had the best experience with him and am very happy with my result

There is a reason he left Kathy Rumor. Every interaction I‚Äôve had with him and his office has been nothing but pleasant. I‚Äôm so sad that this is still being mentioned even after all the positives mentioned about him. He‚Äôs had other training as well PLUS he‚Äôs a urologist.  Please post an update after your consult.

Yes but i have him on recording saying what part he did in the surgery he admitted he constructed my urethra so would not any urine related problems be pertained to him just like when my allomax graft fell out it pertained to Kathy Rumer because she did my canal you have to READ  an operative report so you‚Äôll know who did exactly what and you‚Äôll see why doctors go to hell and back to protect them because that dictated report will make or break a case of malpractice

I‚Äôm so sorry about what you are going through, may I ask, was Dr. Hanna specifically negligent to you like Rumer?
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Also, just because Dr. Hanna worked with Rumer doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs her; he has done other training elsewhere and isn‚Äôt corrupted by Rumer! Still, always good to be cautious!

If anything i felt like i had more trouble and argued more over the wrongs with Hanna then anyone he was rude arrogant and dismissive idk what more to say then his demeanor is just as they just rumer as but weirdly she was the one that tried to play sweetheart until the allomax skin graft (WHICH SHE WILL USE AND NOT TELL YOU) she used rejected out and then she started to act just as described by every Rumer survivor i have no reason just to randomly throw Hanna under the bus unless i had paper proof he had parts in my botched surgery
