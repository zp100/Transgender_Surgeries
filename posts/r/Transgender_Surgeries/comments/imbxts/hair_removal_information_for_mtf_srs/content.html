My experience:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
4&#39;ish Laser Sessions in 2018
</strong>
mostly bikini area not on shaft or below, but still 2 inches around shift/scrotum which helped.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
This year:
</strong>
5 sessions for the first full clear, about 8.5 hours total, actual may be slightly less due to prep time.
</p>
<p>
7 Years HRT seemed to help make the hair more sparse and not as thick. I was also never super hairy, to begin with.
</p>
<p>
My goal is to have surgery in January 2021 which I&#39;ve been told is likely. If they okay me for surgery at that time then I wouldn&#39;t have followed the timeline laid out in your post (5-7 month cycle). Would this be a mistake on my surgeon, or electrologists end, or what&#39;s the deal then?
</p>
<p>
I was told 6 full clears, then the electrologist okays me and 4 weeks after my last session for a hair check with surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Also, I wonder why each doctor has different requirements? Is it surgical techniques or do they have different beliefs about hair.

Plenty of surgeons say you donâ€™t need hair removal, or not much, and plenty of people end up with hair inside. I donâ€™t trust surgeons on this topic and would go for a conservative approach.
</p>
<p>
As you noted thereâ€™s a lack research in this area, and personally I donâ€™t think the research Iâ€™ve read makes much sense.

Right, I didn&#39;t mean to imply &#34;why should I listen to you over my surgeons&#34;. Sorry if I did.
</p>
<p>
Surgeons are falible though so I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a lot of evidence that things aren&#39;t being done right and need to be questioned.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll ask my surgeon about how often people have complications with hair inside ðŸ™‚.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your post, it was insightful.

I just spent the last 15 years on lasing my face and other body parts. The last 5 years I have been getting the bottom dome to prepare for the final transition.  I can recommend using Topicane 5  1 hour before lasing. It makes life during lasing sooooo much better. You can find it on amazon.

One thing that helped immensely for me was 4-4-8 breathing.  Google it.  I tried that in my two electrolysis sessions this week, and the pain was night and day.  There&#39;s still a decent amount of pain and discomfort, but it&#39;s far more manageable than previously.
</p>
<p>
Putting this here because this thread is referenced a lot.

Or you could laser 80% of it off so that it doesn&#39;t take as long to do electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
It does take time, but I started hair removal three years before SRS.  For anyone transitioning, you get hrt asap, and then immediately start hair removal.  That&#39;s what I recommend.

But that&#39;s important bc not everyone wants, or can do marathon sessions.  In my area, they won&#39;t do more than one hour per pt.
</p>
<p>
And you know they do follicle scraping, right?

Follicle scraping is not a replacement for hair removal.  But they do it no matter what I&#39;m order to be sure nothing gets inside.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m saying even if you miss a few dormant hairs during electrolysis, scraping will take care of this

Had I known this would end up in the post getting longer....

You do excellent research.  I really recommend writing a one to three paragraph summary in the future, with a link to a Google docs or something for people who want the full read.

Good job!

In practice a really large post has to be broken up as thereâ€™s a 10k character limit on posts and it looks terrible if you split it up into the comments. I ran to that problem before I started doing the wiki.
</p>
<p>
Part of the problem with surgeons is their idea of whatâ€™s acceptable and ours is not necessarily the same, and they donâ€™t tell us the actual rate of post-op hair so we can judge for ourselves. So Gallagher thinks 7% is just fine, but is it really? Iâ€™m sure it fine by her since she doesnâ€™t have to suffer for it. On top of that they donâ€™t disclose to people the consequences of post-op hair and most people will know next to nothing about any of this. Youâ€™re a rare exception.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™d argue there is no informed consent for the surgery.

I like the way youâ€™ve written it. Itâ€™s a clear summary and itâ€™s looks easy to understand.
</p>
<p>
If you have more material it would be good if you can post it. Iâ€™ve already added this one to the wiki, and size limit there is far higher.

In Germany only females can get their hair lasered below the bikini line.... And if there are people who do that , they charge you double...for being amab. At least in my area... I&#39;m doomed. It&#39;s different in big cities but...
