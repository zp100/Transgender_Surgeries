Girl, if you got clocked by it, the guy who did it is probably thinking about trans people
<em>
constantly.
</em>
Like seriously, it&#39;s a small scar in the neck, there is no way in a million years that is a clockable feature.
</p>
<p>
I know it sucks to get these things out of our minds, but really, don&#39;t worry. There&#39;s nothing absolutely clockable in there at all.

I&#39;m gonna agree with this. I had a friend (cis girl) who has the exact same scar from thyroid cancer removal. That guy was blowing out his ass and just feeding his own confirmation bias (i.e. he probably thinks that a lot but doesn&#39;t mentally note down all the times he&#39;s wrong, only the times he&#39;s right, feeding into a false perception of accuracy)

How can you tell how someone clocked you anyway.   You just make assumptions, I don’t think anyone asks people right?
<br>
I saw a trans girl on the subway the other day and the only way I could tell was that she held her neck in a weird way for a woman.  She was pissed that I clocked her, so sorry for that, but it might not be that you got clocked for your neck scar.
<br>
You should definitely cover the scar with a little foundation.    Cis women would do that almost automatically I think.

you could also look in to medical grade tattooing to camouflage the scar.

A combination of V-Beam vascular laser and old fashioned Fraxel did wonders on a very similar surgical scar I had. It’s best done as early as possible in the healing process and you need more than one treatment. Mine was done at OHSU in Dermatology so you might check there.

They do V-beam pretty much at any dermatology place. I also had my SRS scars, which were older, and a very old surgical scar on my foot and arm treated. They also responded well, so it’s worth a shot. The foot and SRS scars were especially impressive; the foot scar was very raised and red, and is it’s almost invisible. The SRS scars were actually white, and somewhat repigmented which is hard to achieve. In all cases it was a combo of the lasers that helped.

It’s still pink and can take up to 7 years to loose this.
</p>
<p>
Scar treatment. Silicone gel sheets or the tube  with the gel.  These are amazing.. “personally used them both.
</p>
<p>
Or  Cosmetic/dermatologist micro needling, laser treatment to cause a micro trauma which makes your body produce more collagen and smooth out the scar..
</p>
<p>
Also sun protection spf50 even in winter

Any scar can take up to 7 years. Just depends on genetics, health and also the area. Yours is a restricted area “tight”.
</p>
<p>
Also vitamin C high strength is good for collagen production.

Your surgeon does not know how to properly do that surgery.
</p>
<p>
The scar should be in the mental crease up under and just aft of your chin.  Even if you had poor healing, in that location,  it is almost impossible to see unless you look strait up at the sky.
</p>
<p>
Yes.  It takes much more extensive training, skill, and time to &#34;do it right&#34;.
</p>
<p>
A really good plastic surgeon can probably mitigate that scar with a scar revision.
<br>
Sorry you had this happen.
</p>
<p>
Others should take note and learn from your experience.

yes,  but Dr. Schindler did the incision in the wrong place.
</p>
<p>
The &#34;easy&#34; way to do that is to put the incision directly over the Adam Apple.   But that is a very visible location.
</p>
<p>
And any scar there automatically calls attention to the scar because every time you are at dinner sitting across from someone and you swallow - - the scar bounces up &amp; down on your neck like q waiving flag.
</p>
<p>
If it was up under your chin in the mental crease then it would not be noticeable unless you voluntarily looked up at the ceiling.

My SIL had a tunor removed and has the same scar. One of my closest friends had a stroke during her pregnancy at 24, she had a trach placed, has the same scar. Its shitty that this person you were with ONLY associates that scar with being trans.

Hey/ I’d use a bit of makeup and bam 💥 done. Also start using silicone gel like Silagen… or even Mepitac strips at night or when your not out. Will significantly reduce it 💕

Use scar gel when not in public and makeup when you are. Eventually, you won&#39;t have to!

I im rly good at removing scars but try using bio oil and if you want to hide it use a corrector that is the opposite colour followed by foundation matched to the surrounding skin

Scar cream will help with the redness. I use mederma for scars that turned into keloids and it helped the redness go away.

Did your doctor use a laser on it post op? I had my trachea shave done 8 months ago and then 3-4 laser sessions post op and now I can’t tell where the scar was.

I have seen some folks in States have their scars microbladed/ tattooed to match their skin tone to make scar blend in and or  be less visable .. sure it works better in some cases than others.

I&#39;ve known cis women with nearly identical scar. I&#39;m also trans(masc) and literally did not know this scar existed as a part of trans surgeries. I wonder if this person was looking into tracheal shave for themselves or something bc I can&#39;t come up with a reason a guy would just happen to know this scar exists as a trans thing unless he has lots of transfem friends who&#39;ve gotten this surgery, which seems unlikely since he was rude?
</p>
<p>
anyway just want to say that that guy is absolutely an outlier, most people would have no idea what that scar is and hopefully be too polite to comment or question it. it&#39;s rude to comment on people&#39;s surgery scars, you have no idea if it might be due to something traumatic. sorry you were told that by this guy, it absolutely is not a &#34;giveaway&#34;

Maybe you can treat it with stuff for scars? It can get less visible for sure just treat it with proper products for scars

Sounds like that’s a fairly common scar.  I have one there from when I broke my neck and had a spinal fusion surgery.
</p>
<p>
It was red and angry for a couple of years and now just looks like part of my neck.  I’d guess that it’ll be fairly invisible in a couple years.

First, I don’t think tracheal shave is the only surgery that can leave a scar on the throat so I think some cis girls have scars there as well and secondly your neck really is smooth, may I ask if the tracheal shave had negative impact on your voice ? Best wishes to you

This is why I always recommend the girls to get the under the chin scar instead.
