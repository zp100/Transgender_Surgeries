It&#39;s funny how when I woke up after 1. GaOP (might GRS) the it all felt to me like if I was female assigned at birth who had regular vaginoplasty (that&#39;s procedue that AFAB do have for various reasons), and any thought that I might have non-female genitalia before was feeling absurd and unacceptable. I woke up and there was this crazy harmony between me and my body. I felt so peaceful, and I still do, it didn&#39;t go anywhere. I love sex a lot, and I do crave sex a lot, but I&#39;m so distracted right now with how peaceful I feel, and how I just want to relax.
</p>
<p>
I had my 2. GaOP &amp; BA just three weeks ago, and you know, it all looks nice, but it again, just doesn&#39;t feel like my body was adjusted to my gender. I just feel all the time that I was assigned female at birth, and all these operations are just nothing unusual to have for some cis women. Yes, I feel very pretty, and I do love that. It&#39;s just it doesn&#39;t make me any more female. It just makes me sexy, and pretty.
</p>
<p>
Being transgender while sometimes being very tough, but I find it beautiful and unique experience. We definitely are needed in this world ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

can you give me a rough timeline of your interactions with dr. schaff? Contacted him via email a week ago and haven&#39;t received anything yet... I know that&#39;s not a lot of time but I can 100% relate to your descriptions and I really
<em>
need
</em>
that surgery more and more...

I know how you feel, and I really hope you will get what you really need.
</p>
<p>
If you contacted Dr Schaff office, they will respond to you as soon as they can. I think they are very busy right now. Please, arm yourself in patience.

Do you know whether Dr morath will exactly continue with Dr Schaffs work also regarding quality of results?
</p>
<p>
I think I want GRS, but I don&#39;t feel that I would really have to/want to rush it at the moment and I am a little worried that when I want GRS that either Schaff does not do it anymore or that I may get less good results. (What you described with being able to get wet and squeeze penises etc. sounds very impressive, great that you have so good results)
</p>
<p>
Best wishes :-)

Yes, the result is literally as if I was born with it üòâ I don&#39;t know what Dr Morath offers. I know she offerse GaOP Combined Method, same technique as Dr Schaff. However bear in mind that Dr Schaff is experienced microsurgeon. Although I have no actual idea how exactly he did my operation, I know one thing is that I have great sensation (or at least I had one before my revision three weeks ago - still healing).

There&#39;s only one problem: There&#39;s only one Dr Schaff in this world. I wish his ways were practiced widely in medical society. It&#39;s not only about the technique. There&#39;s number of surgeons in Germany who perform that technique. Dr Schaff is much more than just technique. He&#39;s devoted large portion of his life to our transgender community, he cares about us, he has full empathy for our feelings. And also he is true artist, everything he does is just beautiful. We really, really need surgeons like him.

Interesting read, also nice to see that there is a good surgeon in Munich. I would love to see some before after pictures of his work, I know it is difficult in Germany though.
</p>
<p>
I wonder how his method compares to Dr Chettawut for instance which is on the top of my list at the moment. For instance does he divide the tip of the penis in different parts, or does he goes for the slightly larger clit strategy.
</p>
<p>
Do you know how much the procedure cost without insurance coverage?
</p>
<p>
Sorry so many questions. I loved the article :-)

I have consciously chosen Dr J√ºrgen Schaff and not Dr Chettawut as I expected better results.
</p>
<p>
I have posted here on s/Transgender_Surgeries pictures before and after my recent revision.

I shared that already in other posts. I paid for the bundle top + bottom. It&#39;s two surgeries GRS and then revision with BA six months later. It was altogether ‚Ç¨40k, and included three weeks stay and one week stay respectively in the clinic. I also needed to pay for travel five times, as I had two consultations before getting GRS, and then one checkup in June, and of course two times for operation.
</p>
<p>
Given that this is what you gonna live with till end of your life I think the price you need to pay for it is fully justified.
</p>
<p>
Note that Dr Schaff is an expert of GRS and BA.

He certainly did impressive work. Thank you for sharing this information and pictures. I really like what he did. I only saw one picture of the BA. Are you as happy with it? Did you manage to have clivage? Since the space between boobs is the usual issue for us. For the price I understand, I‚Äôm saving up for FFS at Facial team so Inunderstand it is expensive. :-)

Id be very interested in total cost, as id be coming from overseas, coz it sounds like your surgeon is now the best in the world. Then again, i should just give up, im never gonna be able to afford it.
