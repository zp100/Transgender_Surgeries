Congrats on getting to this point! I want to commend you for being thoughtful on results being subject to change. Even if they don&#39;t turn out quite right, the most important thing is that, well, the most important things were done correctly. Mostly the structural and nerve related stuff. Aesthetics are waaaaaaay easier to have touched up, or even completely redone.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve come to understand that revisions aren&#39;t a sign of failure, either. This surgery is difficult to get 100% correct the first time, and you never know how healing will turn out. Revisions are just another step in getting the right results. I know I&#39;ll almost definitely be getting some minor changes to mine!
</p>
<p>
Good luck on healing! I know you didn&#39;t ask for advice, but I&#39;ll just give a little bit I think is really important: even if you feel physically great very soon after to start moving and stuff, settle yourself down and rest. I moved more than I should have and I tore some stuff within the first few days of getting home because I was too eager to walk. Please don&#39;t make the same mistake.

Hun, she looks great!  I had my PPT with Wittenberg 7 wells ago. Go check out my posts. Very similar.
</p>
<p>
Remember, your üê± will get worse before she gets better. Swelling is real!  Trust the process!  Listen to Megan and Dr Wittenberg for your after care and don‚Äôt deviate. And don‚Äôt over do anything. Relax and recuperate this next month. You‚Äôll be fine. ‚ù§Ô∏è
