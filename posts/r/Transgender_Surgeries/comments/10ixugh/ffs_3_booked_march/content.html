I agree with the rest of your post, and would never challenge your decisions that feel right for you.
</p>
<p>
But I have to disagree that all surgery motivations are the same. For most people that get FFS it&#39;s really medically necessary to treat gender dysphoria, which is most likely a developmental brain disorder. It
<em>
should
</em>
happen because it&#39;s the only treatment available.
</p>
<p>
Dysmorphia is something else, and while I&#39;m not an expert, my understanding is that more surgery is not the medically recommended treatment plan.

I see what you mean about the forehead. If Dr Bart Van De Ven from 2Pass was still alive, he could probably carve out your eyes further. That man could definitely cut bone, despite having a few bad cases tho

I found a doctor who is trying to get his name out there that he is doing trans patients and I&#39;ve seen a few girls go through them there&#39;s passable, then there&#39;s that little extra. He seems to do that.
</p>
<p>
Just like dr. Braly or Dr jumaily or Dr Bart would do.
</p>
<p>
I know there&#39;s a safety spectrum but if you got great skills you should be able to push any forehead type back without worrying about safety spectrum.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not here to bash Cardenas or Spain, but Cardenas was tackling his first type 3 with me and Spain only fixed some issues from Cardenas that arose but stayed in the &#34;safety&#34; spectrum.
</p>
<p>
Did both doctors improve my case? Of course. Am I in it for alot of money you betcha!!
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t fear surgeries.
