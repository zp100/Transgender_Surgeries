Is anyone here from nc and have experience with Dr. Keelee MacPhee? Partially her work with orchietomys. All I can find online is the offical testimonies  and I was looking for an unbiased opinion about her work

I did mine with Sherie Hope at Cosmetic Concierge. Highly recommended.

She was my surgeon.   So here are some facts.
</p>
<p>
I continue to hear people say that she trained under Marci Bowers. This is incorrect. Per Dr. Bowers own staff today via phone call, they did not know who Keelee MacPhee is. (650) 570-2270 is Dr. Bowers number call and ask for yourself.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bowers does occasionally train fellows out of Mount Sanai, however that list is very small and Keelee Macphee is not on it. New and up/coming surgeons routinely *observe* Dr. Bowers perform surgery, but Keelee MacPhee has never actively trained as a fellow or resident, under Dr. Bowers (again per her own staff).  She likely observed Dr. Bowers in the OR, but was not trained in an official capacity by Dr. Bowers.
</p>
<p>
Please ya&#39;ll do your homework. I didn&#39;t do mine.
</p>
<p>
I assumed internet wisdom was right in making my decision to go with MacPhee two years ago. Had I to do this all over again would definitely gone with a different and more experienced surgeon. I&#39;m actively planning a revision with Bowers or McGinn, that Macphee says is not advisable.
</p>
<p>
Basically, my surgeon left excess erectile tissue under my labia minor. When I am aroused a stump of what was there before appears. It&#39;s hugely dysphoric and in spite communicating this, my surgeon says she will not consider a revision.
</p>
<p>
Keelee was awesome up front and law of probability says she has probably had a few raving success stories. I&#39;ve since been in touch with other Macphee girls who have the same complication I do. So do your homework!

She performed my tracheal shave and GRS
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s an awesome surgeon and one of the best when it comes to aftercare
</p>
<p>
What questions do you have?
