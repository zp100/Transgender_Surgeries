*NSFW* Breast aug results:)Dr. Zukowski. A phenomenal surgeon with most kind and caring staff especially for trans. I couldnâ€™t be happier with the result and experience. I cannot recommend him enough. These are early stage in recovery pics. I will be posting more once the bandages come off :)

Congrats!! What size/placement/implant type did you get??

Also, how was scheduling with him? I recall hearing that some office staff were a PITA to deal with.

Omg I have absolutely zero complaints or problems with him and his staff they made me feel so comfortable and cared for. But scheduling was very easy Cole was always easy to reach and if I couldnâ€™t reach him he would call me as soon as he was available. But they fought the fight getting my breasts covered by insurance and spent lots of time and effort for me ðŸ’– but I started out with a 36 A cup and I havenâ€™t been able to try on a regular bra and theyâ€™re still swollen but I presume theyâ€™re a small - med C cup. And I got 380cc in one and 420cc in another because of my asymmetry. They were smooth moderate profile saline implants with pariareolar incision.
