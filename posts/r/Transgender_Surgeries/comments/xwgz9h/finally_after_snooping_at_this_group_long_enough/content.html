Thank you for sharing üòä I know there are some strong opinions on Brassard s results but yours looks great.  You are right about the picture thoughüòã .  I had my surgery with him in April of this year and everyday I feel she is looking better and healthier.  I am very pleased as well.

Would you mind elaborating on the strong opinions on Dr. Brassard? My partner, who is transfemme, will be searching for a surgeon soon, and it would be cool if we can stay within Canada because travel is difficult until she gets her permanent residence application processed

The strong opinions are from people who do not like the aesthetic or have  had complications or just aren&#39;t happy about his techniques, the speed of surgery and etc..  I am personally very happy with my results. I know that,  as with any surgery( especially one of this magnitude) both,  have a drastically different experience with the surgery and heal at their own pace.  I felt fortunate and it was still probably the most intense/unique experience of my life.  I felt well cared for physically in the recovery house. Mentally, I was alone and dealing with my dysphoria in the ways that I do but felt like it would have been better to have a therapist to check in with.

The opinions are based on a typical 4 to 6 hour surgery being done at Brassard&#39;s clinic in less than 90 minutes. I have spoken with women who have been there and clock watched and from the time they were ushered into the operating theatre to the time they WOKE UP and it was less than 90 minutes. The results speak for themselves. You may get lucky but I have heard of a lot of complications and if you complain to them, they will make it your fault......infections included. In other words there is no aftercare from what I have been told, and the clinic does not stand behind their work unless really pushed. We all have an aesthetic that appeals to us, so I can not speak to that for anyone else. Most results I have seen have scars half way to your navel or further. Not for me thanks

Mine is to be scheduled yet but hoping for late spring next year. Be a month at least yet for OHIP in Ontario to come through. But I‚Äôve seen his results in person and I will be pleased as a kitty if my kitty looks like that or yours. Beautiful üòª

I&#39;ll likely be going to GRS Montreal within the year but I&#39;m still worried about the functional aspect of results. If you don&#39;t mind me asking, how is your sensitivity? If it returned or improved, how early after the procedure?

It didn&#39;t take long for sensitivity to come back.

What‚Äôs the depth? It seems that the depth definitely has an affect on the quality of work?

Just found my tape measure as I was cleaning my apartment.  It&#39;s just over 5 inches.  Not bad considering I was extremely tiny down there pre-op and was worried I would have needed a skin graft
