So there&#39;s a good chance a Dr. Tobias Pottek could be my surgeon some time in September fingers crossed. He&#39;s based in Berlin but I&#39;ve not found much on him besides his website which is in German. I wouldn&#39;t suppose anyone has any knowledge on him?

No no no please don&#39;t go to him! He has failed so many SRS and so many transwomen have to live with a terrible result because of him. So much people just call him &#34;The Butcher&#34;. If you have Facebook join the group &#34;TGG Transgender Germany&#34;. There are so many reports about his terrible work.

+1 to this comment. There are so so many good surgeons in Germany, many with totally acceptable waiting times. As someone who has seen pictures of Pottek&#39;s results all I&#39;m gonna say about them is that you might aswell take a knife and do the surgery yourself. That&#39;s how bad they are. Look into some experienced surgeons like Dr. Schaff, Dr. Liedl, Dr. Morath, Dr. Taskov, Dr. He√ü, Dr. Krege/Dr. Bohr, Dr. Riechardt, Dr. Klotz. There are enough options available that nobody should ever consider Pottek.

I had a consultation and he seemed fine to me but in the end it looks like I&#39;m going with Dr Richard Fakin in Madrid.

well, he does know how to talk and that&#39;s how he gets his patients by seeming knowledgeable about it. But keep in mind that the many many trans people put a lot of research into their surgeries and as a result could talk about them in the exact same manner that many surgeons do. But I am pretty sure that you would not want to go under the knife of a random trans person, right? And in his case, yes, he does have a medical degree, yes, he is a surgeon, but he absolutely does not have the skills to create a result that would ever make you happy and he also does not even seem to have the motivation to fix his very apparent issues. There a tons of women who suffered severe nerve damages because of him and tons of women who&#39;s genital area does not even remotely look like a vulva. And as stated above, this is not just hearsay but those malpractices are documented by people in that facebook group mentioned. Dr Fakin seems like a much safer choice. :)

Reading people&#39;s opinions and experiences definitely factored in to my final decision overall and the reason we contacted Fakin. I feel more confident about Fakin. Thanks.
