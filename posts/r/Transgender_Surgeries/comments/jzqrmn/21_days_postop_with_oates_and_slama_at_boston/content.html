So I&#39;ve survived 21 days post-op, here are my observations. Also, the more general topic for this post is that I have run into some complications, more on that below.
</p>
<p>
So last week I posted about some stitches coming out and a medium size wound opened up. Since then, I had some more dehiscence (splitting open of a wound). My left labia is the major culprit. Basically, the bottom of my left labia became detached from a skin graft that sat below and next to my left and right labia. Lots of pink tissue healing (but its all healthy tissue). How often does this happen? Dehiscence is not uncommon, and they&#39;ve seen it happen in cases before.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Slama told me he wasn&#39;t happy about it, though it was something we could rectify. What this means for me is I potentially needs to go back into the OR to do a revision before six months. He noted that I was doing reasonably well, as most people probably would be pretty freaked out about it. I have another appointment in two weeks to make a decision on whether or not I need a revision sooner rather than later. I think I&#39;ve generally had a good deal of swelling, and perhaps a minor infection, which could have contributed.
</p>
<p>
I am healing well, generally speaking. I have little pain. A 1-2 on a scale of 10. There is a lot less discharge or bleeding, which I am happy about. Dr. Slama accidentally poked my clitoris, and I
<strong>
definitely
</strong>
felt that. In terms of dilation, I am on the second dilator and getting a fair amount of depth. It&#39;s still a tiny bit painful, but no bleeding. I am moving around pretty okay. Sitting hurts a little, laying down for me is still preferred.
</p>
<p>
Look, so here&#39;s the thing. I am generally a person who tries to not worry about things outside my own control. My body needs time to heal, and the decision for a sooner revision has to wait on my body healing up some of these open wounds. I have no control over my body healing (which, I am lucky that  it heals fast), and I really have to trust Dr. Slama and his team. And he has been great so far.
</p>
<p>
Things are pretty messy down below still. But I am happy with the results, aside from my left labia looking like a sad panda right now. It&#39;s obviously not perfect, but I was not expecting perfection at every step of the process. TBH, vagina&#39;s all look different (and honestly, sometimes weird), sooooo yeah.
</p>
<p>
Anyways I&#39;m trying not to stress out about it (its really not worth my energy to be honest), and mostly everything is working fine.
</p>
<p>
Just wanted to be transparent with my results: they are not rosy, but its also not &#34;botched&#34; or a disaster.
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer questions folks have! I&#39;ll be posting a follow-up after my next appointment with Dr. Slama.

I hope everything heals well! You&#39;re 6? days ahead of me so I&#39;m reading your posts as the warnings of what might be to come lol. Glad to hear your pain is down and the dilation is progressing!

Aw thanks. I did wonder who was in line behind me, haha.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d be a lot more upset, say if I I wasn&#39;t feeling any sensation and if I was having a hard time dilating, but that&#39;s not the case. For me, it&#39;s just an inconvenience. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
Also wishing you best of luck in your recovery! It does indeed get better. üòä
