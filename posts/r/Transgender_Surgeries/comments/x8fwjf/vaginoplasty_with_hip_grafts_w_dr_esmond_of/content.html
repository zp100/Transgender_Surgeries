hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
I wrote most of this around 2 months post-op, and I’m posting it at 5 months. I hope it’s helpful. I’ll tryyy to add pics soon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Insurance
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
I had surgery in early April in Portland, fully paid for by Oregon taxpayers, on state medicaid. Dr Esmonde is a fairly new surgeon and has just started a satellite branch of the Meltzer Clinic in Portland. Most people don’t know that there is another option for GCS in Oregon besides OHSU, which has astronomical wait times for surgery. Quick primer: The state medicaid plan is Oregon Health Plan. Then there is a whole flow chart of options but most people default into being covered by an insurance contractor named CareOregon, which at this time only contracts with OHSU. If you switch from CareOregon to Legacy Pacificsource, you gain access to care at the Meltzer Clinic and OHSU at the same time. This is current information as of Spring 2022, and it might change. It’s really hard to figure out this information and really frustrating that it’s so hard to piece together, so I figured I would lay it all out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Surgeon:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have so far found Dr Esmonde to be really trustworthy. He’s really transparent about the risks of surgery and realistic about the struggle of recovery. He has a really good bedside manner, which I found to be really important actually? He’s careful to ask consent about looking and touching, without being awkward.
</p>
<p>
I should have written stuff down at the consults because there was so much information and I ended up asking for a few follow-up consults to clarify and press for details. Here’s a link to a surgery consult question-asking resource I found helpful.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
He checked in and was really present with me right before and right after surgery and visited me almost every day I was in the hospital so major points for that. Also right before surgery I was listening to some beautiful trans hype music with my gf and he asked if I wanted it to be playing in the operation room when I was going under, which was super cool. I don’t remember that part so whatevs, but I’m sure it was great for me at the time.
</p>
<p>
(for anyone interested that would be

)
</p>
<p>
He was pretty good with being responsive to my needs and prescribing meds. There was some gate-keeping around opioids for pain control, which I personally find annoying because I am exceptionally lucky to have zero problems with opioids and I really respect papaver somniferum the plant. Also, while they did constipate me a little bit, I used a lot of yellow dock, miralax and Smooth Move tea and I was pooping fine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Preparation:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had a running and yoga practice for the two months before surgery and I think it made such a big difference for my body’s preparedness. Unfortunately a solidarity project that I was involved in collapsed and imploded in a really messy, bad way in the months before surgery and I got enmeshed in the fallout as I tried to support everyone else through it. That experience left me fairly bitter, jaded and cynical, with my mental health and sense of wider meaning and faith in humanity shaken and cracked and fragile. That was NOT a good way to go into surgery, because it led directly to some fairly intense post-op depression, despite having a lot of social and emotional and material support to draw on. So, don’t do that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Morning Of:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
My gf and I woke up at 4:30 or something so I could shower and be at the hospital at 5:30. I was completely empty after a whole day of fasting and lots of fluids and pooping the day before. There was clarity to the emptiness though. I remember being utterly calm. It was definitely a heightened state. I checked in and then barely had a few minutes of sitting before we were whisked along to the next stop and the next. The nurses asked a lot of questions, sometimes the same questions, over and over. I was super glad I had legally changed my name recently so I didn’t have to keep deadnaming myself.
</p>
<p>
It felt like being on a train that had already left the station, as if I was just letting go and letting the process take over, as if I was just a passenger aboard something enormous and inevitable, which I myself had not only set into motion, but unceasingly pushed and shoved forward, long ago. It was rolling under its own momentum now, finally.
</p>
<p>
Having my girlfriend’s accompaniment for this part was so so essential. It would have been so much harder to enter this portal alone.
</p>
<p>
There were two waiting rooms and a pre-op room. I changed and got into the rolley bed and that’s when they put the IV in me etc etc. The anesthesiologist and the surgeon both came through to say hi. I was set. The last thing I remember is being wheeled out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery in the hospital:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
TLDR: manipulate your catheter tubing to make it drain
</p>
<p>
I wake up slowly, to a nurse talking tenderly to me. I am super woozy. I can barely open my eyes. The surgeon comes to say hi and I muster some intelligible words. They’ve put me in a really nice big single room with a view and its own bathroom, but I don’t see it for a couple days because of the drugs. For the first day or two I barely register any of my surroundings except the bed. I have a little button that I push every so often when it lights up, and sweet sweet pain relief floods me.
</p>
<p>
My new pussy is pretty swollen, but mostly numb. It’s stitched together and my vaginal canal is stuffed full of gauze. It’s a really weird sensation to be so stuffed full.
</p>
<p>
There’s lots of drains and tubes in me, which is a little disturbing, but I push that down.
</p>
<p>
There is significant pain from muscle cramping because of lying in one position under anesthesia for so long in surgery.
</p>
<p>
There is also discomfort from the catheter. I feel an urge to pee that doesn’t go away. Eventually one of the nurses shows us how to manipulate the catheter tube so that it drains properly. Turns out not every nurse knows this. My catheter comes out of my crotch, loops up towards my navel, and then travels down to the bag hung on the side of the hospital bed. To drain it, I have to constantly bend one section of the tubing so that the pee in it keeps moving according to gravity, then bend the next section to make the pee drain into the bag, which then draws more pee out me and into the first section of tubing which I have to re-bend. Repeat, ad infinitum.
</p>
<p>
There is a foldout bed next to mine, luckily. My girlfriend stays by my side for two whole nights. I can’t overstate how important her presence and support are during this time (girls, it’s haaaaard. I thought I was ready, but this process chewed me up and spit me out).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Food
</strong>
</p>
<p>
TLDR: Crowdfund for takeout money. Food is medicine and the first several weeks are the most crucial. That said, the first two days were pretty much a liquid diet (bougie green juices and smoothies, hello?).
</p>
<p>
I set up a Mealtrain beforehand, which was a blessing, because that hospital’s food sucked. One friend wanted to order me pho the first night, but I basically didn’t eat anything the first night in the hospital, just sipped some bone broth (important for rebuilding tissues).
</p>
<p>
The biggest thing that prevented constipation from opiates was my diet. I cut loose and bougie-d out for stuff that made my stomach feel amazing.
</p>
<p>
Dark leafy greens and dark-colored berries like blueberries have lots of anti-oxidants to reduce swelling and help bodies repair wounds.  I really liked acai bowls and green juices in the morning, and pho or congee or sushi in the evening.
</p>
<p>
Congee recipe stolen from another source:
</p>
<p>
“The term congee comes from Ancient India, from the Tamil people. These overcooked grain porridges are a healing food used around the globe, so recipes vary wildly depending on the place and culture. This is used as an easy to digest, low impact food on the digestive system so the body can focus on healing.
</p>
<p>
Ingredients: 1 cup of uncooked whole grain (rice, wheat berry, millet, amaranth, quinoa, oats, corn, barley, sorghum) 1 cup uncooked lentils or split peas - soak overnight in 6-8 cups of water (this step is optional, but recommended). In some cultures, adding a little whey, yogurt, or sour milk is added to the grains the night before, allowing them to slightly ferment overnight. If you don’t have time to soak the grains / lentils, at least rinse them in cold water for a few minutes. 8 cups of water or broth (chicken, bone, vegetable) Some aromatic spices: ginger root, lemongrass, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom - whatever combo of spices you enjoy! Optional: add one cut up carrot, sweet potato, some kale or collards, onion or garlic. Instructions: Soak the grains / lentils overnight, or about 8 hours. If you don’t have time for this step, at least rinse the grains in cold water for a few minutes. Chop the veggies if you’re adding them. Fry the diced onion in 2 tbsp oil until translucent, about 10 mins. Add the garlic, stir for 30-60 seconds, then add the other chopped veggies, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes. Add the grains / lentils and 8 cups of water or broth. With a lid on, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Note - the amount of liquid to grains can really vary, so feel free to add more if you want a soupier consistency. Simmer on low, stirring occasionally, until the grains break down to mush, about 2 hours. Alternatively, you can cook this all in a slow cooker / instapot. While it’s cooking, add some warming spices, commonly ginger, garlic, onions. You can add: slices carrots, sweet potato, kale, or collards. Add them early on in the cooking process so they are also very very soft. Garnish with green onions, sesame oil, salt, lactofermented vegetables like sauerkraut, shredded meat, egg.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Nurses:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
TLDR: Don’t be afraid to ask to have certain nurses assigned to you or forever un-assigned to you! And plan around shift change (ask for stuff you need before, or delay asking for stuff until after). Also, bring a whiteboard marker to write your pronouns on the white board.
</p>
<p>
Almost every nurse messed up my pronouns at least once. Having my girlfriend there to interrupt that shit was super helpful.  You have to nip that in the bud IMMEDIATELY. She also wrote my pronouns big on the white-board.
</p>
<p>
My first overnight nurse was great. She helped me figure out the catheter thing. She was super responsive.
</p>
<p>
The first time I decided to try to poop was right before shift change, day 2 or 3. Big mistake. I was still on IV painkillers and I couldn’t stand up or walk yet, so I asked for a bedpan and the nursing assistant looked at me like : / which I was like, um what’s that look? She basically brought me the wrong version of bedpan then abandoned me without any instructions or idea of how to use it or what to do. When the nurses came in for shift change they had to document the remaining amount of narcotics in the IV pump so they ignored me for 10 minutes while I struggled with the bedpan and tried to interrupt them and get their attention. Those two were not my favorite.
</p>
<p>
Lesson learned: Try to get your needs met before shift change or wait until after. If you are really relying on a medication (like painkiller, for example), make extra sure that the next scheduled dose doesn’t fall within an hour of shift change or make a plan with your nurse so they can get it for you early.
</p>
<p>
There was only one nurse that I asked to never be paired with again. The night they changed my pain medication from IV to a pill, the nurse didn’t tell me or warn me about it. She was really unresponsive and took a long time to get me anything. She was also really gatekeepy with the pain meds that night and I was really out of it, so I didn’t advocate for myself, just meekly submitted, and then I woke up in pain in the middle of the night and laid there for a long long time, not able to think or come up with a solution or understand that I could do anything about it. Finally I hit the button to summon a nurse, and asked for my pain medication. And she took another long time to actually bring it.
</p>
<p>
Don’t expect your nurses to be healers. They are technicians. Don’t expect a hospital to be a place of healing. It’s a rigid bureaucratic institution of instrumental medicalism.
</p>
<p>
The next day I asked to talk to the charge nurse and let her know I didn’t want to be assigned to that nurse again. She didn’t even ask for a reason, which was a relief.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pain control:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
TLDR: stay ahead of the pain. Especially at night! Take the meds at their scheduled intervals. Religiously.
</p>
<p>
From that experience I learned to ask my overnight nurse to always bring my pain meds whenever they were scheduled to next be available. I was on 5mg oxycodone every 3 hours, so I asked for the night nurse to just wake me up every 3 hours to give it to me. And I also set my own alarm so I could ask for them every 3 hours. Soooo much better than waking up because the meds have fully worn off and the pain has gotten too bad to sleep through!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Peeing and Urinary tract infections (UTI)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
TLDR: an over-the-counter med called Azo/pyridine, plus D-mannose supplements, plus keeping it dry down there as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
Peeing is such an important part of being alive! It’s so so so easy to take it for granted if its always been easy for you. I will never take it for granted again.
</p>
<p>
I had a UTI when the catheter came out. I had an entire day of discomfort before I asked the surgeon and he told me about Azo/pyridine. Then I had another one at 3 weeks. Then I had another one 10 days later. After that I got really really careful, because they suck SO much.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had to take antibiotics for those, which I’m not a fan of. Some doctors say that your urethra is sterile and so antibiotics have no effect on your urethral microbiome but if you do a cursory google search you can find that this has been disproven and is fake news. Which means that every time I’ve taken antibiotics I’ve nuked my urethral microbiome and wiped away all the bacteria, both good and bad, and made it MORE susceptible to future infection.
</p>
<p>
My current protocol is to drink lots of fluids so I pee every 2-4 hours. I always pee after dilation, and I never use lube that has parabens or glycerin in it. I pat my urethra dry with toilet paper several times after each pee.
</p>
<p>
I also take D-mannose supplements (which is the sugar in cranberries that’s good for the urethral lining) and try to drink a glass of cranberry juice or hibiscus tea every day.
</p>
<p>
My urethra is still healing and changing. It’s gotten a lot less inflammed over the last couple weeks. I don’t really know what the final result will be yet. Right now about 40% of the pee comes out as a bunch of different rivulets and drips all over the place and 40% of the pee comes out as a inch-wide stream that pulses unpredictably but aims somewhat forward and down, some of the time. The remaining 20% of the pee comes out in a random spray pattern. It is CHAOTIC.
</p>
<p>
If I am squatting to pee in the woods, some of the spray sometimes flecks on to my shoes. It hasn’t soaked my socks yet, for which I am grateful, but you never know. I’ve heard of that happening!
</p>
<p>
And now I always have to carry TP, wherever I go.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dilation:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
TLDR: Slippery Stuff lube is the best. Also, breathing.
</p>
<p>
There’s a lot of dilating info in other posts so I will try to not repeat too much.
</p>
<p>
Bottom line: dilating once or twice isn’t that hard. Going for a week isn’t even that hard. But when it gets to be weeks and weeks, and your vagina is sore and you don’t have a break from it, and you just have to keep going, that is when it gets overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
The first week or two of dilating was easy! The surgeon told me to dilate for 15 minutes and it took less than a minute to insert the dilator, so it was only a 16 minute affair.
</p>
<p>
It’s only as the tissues have begun to heal more and tighten that it has become more difficult. I’m 7 weeks out as I write this and I am currently beginning with the #2 (tapered), leaving that in for 5 minutes, then inserting the #3 (tapered) for another 5 minutes, then finally working up to insert the full #3 dilator for 15 minutes. This process takes about 45 minutes instead of 25, though, because they don’t just slide in. I have to rotate them and take deep, intentional breaths, and work them in bit by bit.
</p>
<p>
Before surgery I went to a bunch of pelvic floor PT sessions with OHSU physical therapists. They work with lots of trans girls and they were awesome. They identified that while I am pretty good at clenching my pelvic floor muscles, I am not great at relaxing them. They gave me a bunch of pre-op exercises to help me develop this skill. They told me some stuff and I spent a while just Google image searching “pelvic floor” and “diaphragm” and “inhale exhale” to help me imagine what it looks like.
</p>
<p>
Basically, they said, we have 2 diaphragms—the respiratory one and the pelvic one. When you inhale a breath, both diaphragms move down. When you exhale, they both move up.
</p>
<p>
What has been a little harder to figure out is whether the pelvic floor is more relaxed on an inhale or on an exhale—and which is better to push the dilator in on. I encourage you to figure this out for yourself, with your own body. For me, its easier to work in the dilator when I am exhaling. But your body might be different!
</p>
<p>
So I guess what I want to emphasize here is that dilating feels like you are being told to punch yourself in a really tender sore spot over and over while simultaneously being told that your only job is to heal that tender, sore spot? It’s like running a marathon but taking one step backwards for every two steps forwards. Exhausting.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I figured out was that I have a small pelvis and narrow hips and that means that the opening for my vaginal canal is small! It’s bounded by the pubic bone above and my perineum below. So to get the biggest diameter dilators into my vagina, I have to press them ‘down’, into the perineum (once it is fully healed!) and stretch that tissue, to get them to slide inside. The pubic bone is not going to stretch at all, so it’s useless to press ‘up’. I hope that makes sense to you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Herbal support:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
TLDR: Gotu Kola, Calendula, Lions Mane. That was MY protocol, for MY body. That said, those are really safe herbs that work for 99% of people.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I leaned on the most for herbs and supplements (expensive but easy to accidentally walk out with in your bag):
</p>
<p>
-Vitamin C (time-released) supplement, 1000 mg/day (your body can’t form collagen/rebuild tissue without it!)
</p>
<p>
-Omega 3 fatty acids. I took fish oil, 1000 mg/day. Regrowing nerves need it to make their myelin sheaths.
</p>
<p>
-Gotu Kola for tissue healing, circulatory stimulation. Tincture: 1/4 tsp 3x/ day or Tea 1
</p>
<p>
teaspoon / cup, 3x/ day
</p>
<p>
-Lions Mane for nerve regeneration. Tincture: 1/4 tsp 3x/ day. You can find this in capsule
</p>
<p>
form if that&#39;s preferred. I like the brand Host Defense / Fungi Perfecti and the website
</p>
<p>
vitacost.com often has the cheapest prices. Recommended dose is 1-2g / day.
</p>
<p>
-Calendula for tissue healing and lymphatic circulation. Tincture: 1/4 tsp 3x/ day or Tea 1
</p>
<p>
teaspoon / cup, 3x/ day
</p>
<p>
-Acetyl-L-carnitine (supports peripheral nerve regeneration).
</p>
<p>
Recommended daily dose is 1g-2g and people see best results after taking it 6-12months.
</p>
<p>
(1000mg = 1g).
</p>
<p>
-Smooth Move tea and Yellow Dock tincture for opioid constipation.
</p>
<p>
-I also used St Jon’s Wort oil topically to help with nerve regrowth.
</p>
<p>
-Bone broth for collagen, to supply my body with the building blocks for new tissue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Strange sensations and chaotic nerve regrowth:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
TLDR: to paraphrase my surgeon “weird, anomalous symptoms happen in surgery recovery and 80% of them subside without you actually figuring out what was causing them.”
</p>
<p>
About 1 week post-op, the numbness of my vulva started to wear off and I began to get a sensation right behind and around the clitoris that felt like...how do I describe this?…it was a sensation that felt slightly reminiscent of when I would push the tip of my flaccid girl-dick inside my shaft and invert it and roll it up like an unwrapped condom (???), but it also felt super twisted. Which isn’t that different from what the surgeon actually did, right? That sensation was persistent for a week or two, and then resurfaced a few more times, and then by week 7 has faded completely.
</p>
<p>
4 weeks post-op I began to experience a really really really weird sensation at my mons pubis, right above my clitoris. It felt like a muscle spasm. A really intense muscle spasm. It got worse and worse for 6-8 days and then slowly subsided. It flared most painfully when I was walking. When I was lying down it would abate. I spent 4-5 days mostly in bed.
</p>
<p>
I asked my surgeon for narcotic painkillers but he gave me gabapentin—and that actually worked really well. He also told me that there was no muscle where the sensation was coming from. What it probably was, he said, was the neurovascular bundle that supplies my clit with sensation and circulation, which used to run along the shaft, and which he had made a little U shape in (since it doesn’t need to be as long as it was) and tucked away under the skin.
</p>
<p>
Nerves do crazy things when they are healing and when they aren’t sure where or who they are anymore. They send off all sorts of weird signals.
</p>
<p>
Another weird sensation that was happening a lot during the first few weeks post-op but has mostly subsided now is in my labia. They are made of scrotal skin tissue. And for a few weeks, even though they were mostly numb, the sensation they were giving  me when I touched them felt JUST like I was touching my scrotal sack pre-op. It was NOT a nice feeling. I didn’t like that part of my body—it felt sort of wormy and sick to touch before. After the initial shock and trauma wore off, the nerves thought they were still part of the scrotal sack, so that’s what they were trying to tell me.
</p>
<p>
Now, at the end of month 2, they are slowly settling in and re-attaching and learning who they are all over again. Now they feel like labia.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Perineum
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
TLDR: this area is really prone to splitting open. Be really careful to not put much tension on this area during the first month or two.
</p>
<p>
The most persistent granulation and the slowest healing was around my perineum, not just because of dilation but also because this area gets the most mobility and movement from walking. Also, when I spread my cheeks to sit on a toilet seat or my donut pillow, it actually pulled on this area. The donut pillow was almost more trouble than it’s worth because of this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Hormones:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
They make you go off of hormones before surgery, which sucks, because then you are dealing with both painful recovery AND an endocrine rollercoaster as you try to get your levels stable again. It sucks, but just don’t let your Dr use surgery as an excuse to lower your dosage afterwards. Especially not in the first 4-6 months. Low and unstable levels really made recovery harder for me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Mental Health, post op depression and not spinning out:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
TLDR: Lean heavily on your friends. Oh, that’s not your usual MO? Oh, showing vulnerability or dependence is uncomfortable and asking for help is a really intense edge for you? Yeah, same here. But you know what?  This can be a really lonely process to go through and there’s only one thing you can do about loneliness. Lean. On. Your. Friends.
</p>
<p>
There was this continuous pattern I experienced where a new complication or stumbling block would arise, then I would feel majorly daunted and start worrying that it was permanent—Oh well, I guess this is my life from now on, sux2suck! Cue despair and total abjection. And then...hours or days or weeks later, I would heal some more and it would smooth over, or I would find a way around it.
</p>
<p>
Every time this happened, the most helpful thing I did was confiding my fear to my gf or to a friend who had been through this procedure before me, because they inevitably responded with: “It’s still so early. You’re still healing. It gets better.” Also, they helped me advocate to nurses and the surgeon to get my questions answered, or to get a medication that could help ease the symptoms in the short-term. And they helped me google stuff.
</p>
<p>
But far and away the most important message to hear was this reminder that I am still healing, this won’t last forever, be gentle with yourself.
</p>
<p>
Week 3-4 was about when my last reserves and patience ran out and the pain exhaustion set in. That’s about when the pain meds my surgeon prescribed for me to take home starting to dwindle as well. And that’s also about when the crowd of support from friends started to dwindle and people started to forget about me or get distracted by their regular lives.
</p>
<p>
And this is also about the same time when the pain turned mostly invisible—because I was able to walk short distances, and stand for short amounts of time.
</p>
<p>
One day my roommate asked me to walk a few extra steps to close a door, and I got so mad at them for what I perceived as not taking my pain level into account.
</p>
<p>
The pain exhaustion was just this overwhelming loss of patience with the constant grinding low-levels of pain. Even though my pain rarely went over a 3, enduring it constantly 24/7 drained me all the same. And I hit a wall where my capacity to endure it just...sort of ran out?
</p>
<p>
I’ve kind of gotten used to having scream-sob-crying melt-downs at this point, where I clutch a pillow and say things like “I can’t do this anymore” and “absolutely fuck me” and “I don’t want to exist anymore” and “I just want to leave” and worse stuff. You are fully allowed to say something even if you aren’t sure if you mean it. You are fully allowed to break tf down, and be broken. What else is a transformation?? How else would you even do it?
</p>
<p>
The most significant help has been remembering that I stand on the shoulders of amazing trans women who have come before me and made this all possible and shown the way—including how to endure the unbearable, how to walk through the longest desert and keep walking. Sybil Lamb’s writing has been particularly resonant in this time (especially this:
<a href="http://www.trannypunk.com/TSPX/fire1.html">http://www.trannypunk.com/TSPX/fire1.html</a>
)
</p>
<p>
Ironically, the post-surgery depression settled in right as the pain exhaustion started to fade. Around week 6 I started to feel this crushing weight inside me, and nothing seemed meaningful anymore, and I lost all my motivation to write or make art or hang out with friends. I started to tell myself a story that all my friends had forgotten about me, that I was alone, and it drove me further into self-isolation.
</p>
<p>
Post-surgery depression is stigmatized, especially for gender-affirming procedures. You are supposed to be euphoric, right? No regrets, right? Yeah, I didn’t think it would be a problem for me, either.
</p>
<p>
I’m lucky to have a trans therapist who also happens to be a good therapist. Not that he was able to do much for me besides help me feel like I made sense and so did my depression.

On top of that, anesthesia is a really intense thing for the human body, and it took me months to come out of the traumatic dissociation response that it triggered in my nervous system. If you struggle with dissociation, like I do, make sure you set up some tools and supports for that to happen post-anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
Being physically immobilized and in pain was such a big deal for my mental health, but it’s not like I could DO anything about that. This was such an intense thing to go through and there was nobody else going through it with me, that I totally got stuck in a deep state of alarmed aloneness for weeks and months. This loneliness is something I COULD do something about, but I was in such a state of frozen despair and metabolic, cellular exhaustion that it was really hard to do anything about.

The human brain circuitry that pertains to drive and motivation (named the SEEKING circuit by neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp) runs on dopamine. It is suppressed during depression by a sort of evolutionary adaptive stragedy when the brain feels trapped and helpless and decides it needs to preserve and conserve energy by going into a low-power, emergency-battery-saving mode. There’s not a quick fix for the kind of deep, lifelong loneliness that many trans people have inflicted on us by cis supremacy (
<a href="https://sarahpeyton.com/get-started/">https://sarahpeyton.com/get-started/</a>
this stuff is more relevant for that). However, I found that building routine into my life that was full of small accomplishments and tasks and mundane rewards—the kind of rewards that activate many little dopamine releases in my brain—was enough to re-activate my SEEKING circuit and bail me out of post-op depression. For me that was working at a kids summer camp around month 3-4, and then going on a little weeklong trip with a friend to stay in a cabin in the woods and give each other stick-and-poke tattoos, weave willow baskets by the river, cook amazing vegan food, and harvest and dry seaweed.

I’m so glad I got this surgery! It messed me all the way up, but so worth it.

Pls can you explain about the use of hip grafts, like why and how deep - and sensation, etc. I searched but couldn&#39;t locate anything in text about them.

hip skin grafts are an option that the meltzer clinic offers as an alternative to undergoing a year of electrolysis to remove hair on the scrotal skin. hip grafts take a full thickness graft of hairless skin from right above the hips, a strip on each side about as long as the distance between my middle finger tip and my wrist, a straight clean scar. Its only been 5 months but it looks like a really well healed top surgery scar from like 5 years ago, but just above each hip. i think they look kinda sexy. i wanna get them tattooed. That skin is now what composes my vaginal canal, instead of the scrotal skin, which i guess they just threw away or used to create my labia. there&#39;s basically no sensation difference--it doesn&#39;t matter where the skin comes from. The skin that forms my canal has definitely changed from being inside me, which is hella cool. The hip graft scars were basically painless from day 1 and super fast healing. The only thing that took a while was for the stitches to dissolve and fall out.

Obviously this has been a good while, but I’d love to hear if you have an update to this! I have mine scheduled with dr Esmonde in September

I had my consult with Dr. Esmonde recently and really liked him but I’m looking for firsthand accounts if you’re willing to share?

Well, the short version is that he’s been an absolute delight to work with, and while I’m in the hospital now for a revision it’s entirely because of my body’s tendency to overproduce scar tissue rather than anything related to him. He did a fantastic job and I couldn’t be happier with having gone to him

Would you mind if I DM’d you? I have a lot of anxiety around surgery obviously and I haven’t talked with anyone that’s seen Dr. Esmonde yet and this has me really encouraged

How does it look? I can’t find any result pictures and I’m getting my surgery done with him later this year and I’m scared because I don’t want it to look crazy.

Were you able to post pictures at any point? I haven’t seen examples of Dr. Esmonde’s work for vaginoplasty
