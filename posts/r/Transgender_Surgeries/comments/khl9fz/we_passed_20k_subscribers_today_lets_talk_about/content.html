Comment here if you&#39;re like to discuss anything about how the sub is run, how it might be improved, and so on.
</p>
<p>
We did one of these
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fyomtc/lets_talk_about_the_sub/content.html">8 months ago</a>
, and the sub has grown considerably since then. We had about 8500 members
<a href="https://subredditstats.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries">this time last year</a>
and 3250 the year before that so growth is approximately doubling every year.

You’ve been doing a great job moderating this sub and maintaining* the wiki HiddenStill. I know it can’t be easy and I wanna recognize the work you do.
</p>
<p>
One of the big things I’ll say is that sometimes I’m annoyed by repetitive questions and posts. It feels like almost every two weeks someone asks a question they could’ve answered themselves by using the search bar.
</p>
<p>
While I get that two different threads can provide you with two different perspectives many of these questions have the same answer no matter how many times you ask it. That being said I’m on this sub a lot so it may just be me seeing it.
</p>

Thanks.
</p>
<p>
I think people go through phases in the way they interact with reddit, starting off replying to lots of questions, but eventually getting tired of the repetition, to dropping out completely. One of the reasons I setup the wiki was so as not to keep writing up the same information again and again - usually I just post a link now, or just say look in the wiki.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure why people have trouble finding information. Apart from google I put a link in the sidebar, although that’s not really visible in apps, and about 50% of the views here are apps. There’s even a message when you subscribe to the sub saying to look in the wiki.
</p>
<p>
However not everyone’s here for information, people like talking, support, etc. Not really my thing though.

I disagree with you. A question can be asked in a thousand different ways. So it may not be as easy as you say to find CERTAIN questions you are looking for sometimes. Also, new question, new perspectives, new answers and things a previous post about it may not contemplate.

Well-informed questions can definitely be asked different ways.
</p>
<p>
However, there&#39;s definitely a problem (at least that I&#39;ve seen) of new posters being
<a href="https://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/">help vampires</a>
</p>
<p>
When someone comes in with a question like &#34;Hi I&#39;m in California and want SRS. Who are the best surgeons near me?? Thanks!!!&#34;, it&#39;s really hard for good conversation to result. Posters really need to do at least the base level of legwork before making a post for useful discussion to result.

Probably related are those who seek help, but don’t offer anything in return. Along the same lines deleting useful information so that discussions become useless to others in the future.

<p>
It’s disappointing, but what do you do.

We could perhaps put together a template of basic questions that would be nice to be covered in all consult write-ups.

Hey! I’d love it if you posted your write-up! I’ve got a consult with her in March and I’m getting pretty anxious.

I&#39;m planning to post it by the end of the week or so. I just don&#39;t want to gloss over anything if I can avoid it, so a list of bullet points to hit on like they&#39;re suggesting would be nice.

I’ve no issue with that, but I’m not sure any intersex people have an interest in posting here.

<p>
A related thing is where you occasionally see cis people post in trans hrt communities for help.

Hmmm... I am not sure how I feel about opening the space up to cis people*. But I&#39;ve seen a fair number of intersex and cis people coming here for advice from time to time, over the years. And they&#39;re treated respectfully and we try to help.

I think more broad insurance posts would be helpful. I&#39;ve been transitioning for 3 years and stuff like
<a href="https://dfr.oregon.gov/laws-rules/Documents/Bulletins/bulletin2016-01.pdf#:%7E:text=gender%20identity%20or%20gender%20dysphoria%20by%20an%20insurer,the%20treatment%20is%20gender-affirming%20treatment%20for%20gender%20dysphoria.">this document</a>
(about Oregon insurance coverage) is still pretty difficult to find.
</p>
<p>
The fact is, most trans folks are so absolutely certain that insurance
<em>
won&#39;t
</em>
cover stuff that they don&#39;t even try, when in my case, I have found that almost everything is covered (with my insurance) once I asked. Granted, I&#39;ll never know until after surgery, amirite?

Great job on the mod part this sub feels super safe!
</p>
<p>
The only thing I&#39;m missing (and I might just be super dumb and we already have this) is a unified flagging system so we can find things quicker. Like every post about a certain topic has to be flagged the same so if someone was looking for example for top surgery or vaginoplasty results it would spit back all pictures of results.

I did the FTM ones in blue as an experiment. The vast majority of what&#39;s left is MTF.
</p>
<p>
Reddit has very limited options when it comes to controlling flairs, and I didn&#39;t want to have a free for all where everything is in all sorts of different text and colors. I find the flair in subs that do that distracting, and I makes the flair less useful.
</p>
<p>
The problem with the way its setup now is that I have to set them manually.
