Uhm, I would ask your surgeon why he thought that was the right place for it. Iâ€™m sure you could have it moved in a revision. Ngl, that would freak me out too.

This is quite upsetting, and Iâ€™m sad to inform you that you have found yet another man who cannot find the clit

Yes, there is a revision for this. Look at Dr. Littleton in Portugal. Good luck.

Ask about revisions for hoodplasty, clitoroplasty, labiaplasty.

When i met him before the surgery he helped quell my nerves but after I barely saw him and only communicated with his team. The hospital he works out of however was a horrible experience due to him only working out of/renting the hospital, the nurses seemed to be annoyed with me even thought I was in horrible pain, taking 30 minutes to come after I hit the buzzer, plus none of them knowing english definitely doesn&#39;t help (although Im not expecting them to learn an entire language for me lol). Another girl i am speaking with had horrible complications to the point where he almost killed her and she is considering a lawsuit. He also hasnt spoke to me in months. Other than that my Vulva looks okay other than my labia minora being fused and the clitoris being jn a weird place which can be fixed with a revision. Just waiting on sensation now, although my recent mental state is not helping with the recovery of it. In my opinion you should do more research for other surgeons before you decide but the price point and informed consent were big pros for me.

That looks like the kind of thing that easy to get a revision, but I&#39;d find a different surgeon. I suspect there&#39;s other issues you could take care of at the same time.

I&#39;m AFAB and my clit does sit like that, although it is longer so it kind of covers the whole vulvar cleft when viewing from the front like in your photo. It did that pre-T, and it was even like that before puberty. It was unusual that mine was so big even before puberty though, I had natal cliteromegaly.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/04/11/a-former-bikini-waxer-says-there-are-five-different-types-of-vaginas-6567048/" rel="nofollow">This article</a>
describes different vulvas, as seen by a professional bikini waxer. The kind I have would be &#34;Ms Horseshoe&#34; in that typology (Mx Horseshoe to her, but w/e.) It incorrectly identifies the exposed part as &#34;labia minora.&#34; Correct vulva anatomy is something even a lot of cis women don&#39;t understand well (I mean she also calls them &#34;vaginas&#34; but what she illustrated was vulvas) but people have a special blind spot to that part of the vulva, it isn&#39;t even labeled on all medical charts because of the extent of the cultural blind spot. It&#39;s called the corpus (or body) of the clitoris, and is the homologue to the shaft of the penis. The hood (aka prepuce, the clit foreskin) also naturally descends from that just as the foreskin naturally descends from the shaft of the penis--so the exposed bit in the &#34;Ms. Horseshoe&#34; vulva is both clit corpus and clit hood as one piece of soft, hairless skin.
</p>
<p>
So even though I personally do have natal cliteromegaly and now growth from T, there are lots of cis women who have a similar vulvar appearance who have the pretty average &#34;Ms. Horseshoe&#34; vulva.
</p>
<p>
IDK about the pros and cons of revision, that&#39;s something to discuss with a doctor, I do think there&#39;s still room for improvement (it sticking out front doesn&#39;t seem bad to me because mine has always looked like that and I&#39;ve seen other natal vulvas that look like that, but what I would notice about it is the clit being a little shorter than usual with that type of vulva and not filling the whole cleft, and the tip being a bit asymmetrical). But minmaxing that might not be worth messing with sensation if that&#39;s at risk--I can&#39;t say whether it is, I&#39;m not a doctor.
