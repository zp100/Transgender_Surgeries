Sorry to hear you had a bad result. I had FFS with FacialTeam in November 21 and my nose turned out super well, but it&#39;s just as important to spread awareness of how they deal with bad results.
</p>
<p>
Hope you can get a revision you&#39;re happy with.

I am so sorry to hear that. I think like you FT give free surgeries for some Spanish ‚Äútrans celebrities‚Äù in order to get visibility and use a huge commercial marketing policy, but the results are not as good as what they promote‚Ä¶ moreover they are so expensive!  I personne recommend Dr. Coiante in Paris. He did my FFS and I live stealth today. Also they are more option in Spain.

I mean rhinoplasty alone is a much less invasive surgery than FFS. That is most likely why the post operative care was different. Also the fact FFS is multiple procedures that add up in cost. Remember at the end of the day, it&#39;s all about money.

Lol facialteam is such a waste of money and Dr Bellinger the rhino surgeon has a terrible attitude. Their foreheads are terrible they really need to change their philosophy &amp; employ 1-2 trained craniofacial surgeons.

I am conservative with using the term ‚ÄúBotched‚Äù because there are so many variables.   But this is a clear case of a botched surgery.  To be honest, FT‚Äôs work has never impressed me.  Most of their work is too subtle for my tastes and your nose is a product of incompetence.   You are smart to seek revision elsewhere, and I would look for am experienced ENT rather than an FFS surgeon.  Sorry you have this result and experience.‚ô•Ô∏è

I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t see you post the year anywhere before this comment so I just provided a common reason.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, I think this is mainly your body dysmorphia speaking, as the pictures show very minor visual details that the average person wouldn&#39;t bat an eye at. People have highlighted this to you several times before as well I see:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/168vf74/comment/content.html#jyy29an" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/168vf74/comment/jyy29an/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a>
</p>
<p>
Surgery is never perfect, and this should&#39;ve been expressed clearly. Nose jobs in particular have some of the highest revision rates because small errors tend to stand out.
</p>
<p>
Of course this is not an excuse for bad treatment. Can you show any document proving that they sued you? If they&#39;re as bad as you say they are, a lot of people on this sub who are going with FT would like to know.

Did you follow up with facialteam about your width issue? Would be interested too know what they said to you. Also are you happy with their other work with jaw/chin etc? Your results look pretty great apart from what you have mentioned here, thanks

not the first botched rhinoplasty results I&#39;ve seen feom FT, i wonder what technique they use to mess it so much.
</p>
<p>
that being said, in my opinion your main concerns at this point shouldn&#39;t be about your passability, but about your facial harmony.

I had ffs with them in 2020 July. Rhino healed slightly weird. 90% perfect but the nostrils were slightly off. Kinda annoyed but ima just live with it I guess. Apparently though they sometimes just heal not 100% sadly
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs really hard to see what‚Äôs exactly wrong with yours as the pictures are so close, can‚Äôt really see what‚Äôs going on

Idk why ppl waste their money in facial team . With half the amount of money you can find many good surgeons in Iran , Russia and turkey. They can create an alive Barbie.

I took SRS/GRS in Spain/Barcelona (IM Clinic) and I am very satisfied. But haven&#39;t read much about FFS yet, since SRS was my first priority. But know they have FFS too.

What other good ffs surgeons are there in Europe? I feel like the reason we‚Äôre seeing a lot of dissatisfaction with FT is because of the sheer amount of people they operate on. It‚Äôs like ten a week so it‚Äôs a law of numbers. I had no complications and am very happy other than the increase in hairline height due to coronal incision.
</p>
<p>
Having said that of all the bad things I‚Äôve heard about FT it‚Äôs mostly rhinoplasty, but then again rhinoplasty is by far the cosmetic procedure associated with most regret with all aesthetic surgery.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt think people want to go with someone in Russia / Iran / Turkey who has practically no reputation‚Ä¶ The other main FFS surgeon in Europe was Bart / 2Pass and he was a butcher; he is dead now anyway.
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs a few in the UK but they have essentially no public results.

<p>
Anna Sluzky looks good but not enough published results to seem safe imo.

I&#39;m sorry this didn&#39;t work out as you were hoping. I wonder how much things will improve in time with healing.
