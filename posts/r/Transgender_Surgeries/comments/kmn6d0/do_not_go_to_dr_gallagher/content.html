Earlier this year, I was strung along for months by Dr. Keith&#39;s team in New Jersey. His partner urologist, Dr. Bhalla, missed consultation after consultation, delaying surgery by many months.
</p>
<p>
About a month ago, the team at Gallagher Plastic Surgery offered to fast-track something given how much of a toll this was taking on my mental health. I was supposed to have a consultation on the 23rd, which they missed. I am in the worst mental health crisis of my life.
</p>
<p>
I heard nothing from Gallagher until today (6 days!) and they&#39;re now emphasizing the importance that I get mental health treatment instead. What&#39;s making me suicidal is surgery always falling apart. There is no treatment that can fix that other than GCS.
</p>
<p>
This is so absurdly wrong. Even the surgeons who perform bottom surgery won&#39;t recognize its life-saving importance. Instead I just have to be tortured endlessly by the agony of genital dysphoria.

Any GCS surgeon you go to will require documentation on your mental health and that you are not suicidal. Of course trans people can be super depressed and suicidal, but you have to be mentally stable before having this surgery because the most common mental health concern after surgery is post-op depression. Surgery does not alleviate depression, it alleviates dysphoria. However, why didn’t you just lie and say you’re fine? They do the psych evaluation because they know what they are doing and want you to be in a good headspace before you go in through a big, life changing and life saving surgery.

I&#39;ve seen some comments of you mentioning a suicide attempt. She can&#39;t operate on someone who is mentally unstable. You have to be confirmed mentally stable by multiple health professionals to be able to have something as big as this. I was in your shoes a while ago and was pissed I couldn&#39;t because of mental instability and being told that I wasn&#39;t mentally stable enough to have a major surgery. Now I understand why. If she operated on you without letters of you being mentally stable and meeting the requirements x y and z, out of her best judgement it&#39;s not smart to operate. It might piss you off now but it&#39;s not her fault. Unless you&#39;re mentally stable she will not do treatment. If anything this makes her a good surgeon, she won&#39;t operate on just anyone. Unless I&#39;m missing something this isn&#39;t exactly her fault.

I have those letters and mental health professionals who will back up that all of this is just caused by delays in surgery
</p>
<p>
I’m not even mentally unstable, I just keep getting fucked over by this process
</p>
<p>
It took me being shamed by a big blue checkmark on Twitter about wanting to to travel to get surgery during the pandemic for me to even attempt anything.
</p>
<p>
I just need surgery.

Either way, a suicide attempt is a suicide attempt. When you do something like that they&#39;re even more convinced your unstable. It&#39;s her own private practice, she doesn&#39;t have to operate on everyone. It&#39;s really risky operating on someone who has just done something like that, no matter the circumstances.

I did attempt suicide several days ago, and now that&#39;s being held against me, but you may be right.
</p>
<p>
This is just such agony, and I&#39;ve been trying to make it happen for so long. It&#39;s supposedly been close for months now and I&#39;m just completely falling apart.

Well less is more. No doctor will provide surgery if you just had a suicide attempt documented. That’s what it is.

Yes it actually is tru any surgeon has the right to judge the mental capacity of the patient and deny service if they feel that the surgery could further jeopardize the health and safety of the patient. They are not trying to get sued

That’s very different than what you said, and, in this case, what’s jeopardizing my health and safety is 6 years of failing to make surgery happen

I mean, her team acknowledged and recognized I was undergoing a mental health crisis from surgery being delayed and then proceeded to miss a consultation right before going away for almost a week.

You have to understand the emotional toll and trauma srs will place on your mind and body. No surgeon would be willing to operate on you in less they know you will be able to handle post surgery recovery. Ask some of these girls commenting, Some of them have posted suicidal Reddit’s like every other week post surgery.

Again that is non issue specially if you are repeatedly telling them youre having mental breakdowns. You wonder why the pushed and then stopped your surgery. Girl we are in a national health crisis and you are pretty much telling your surgeon don’t give me surgery because I’m emotional unstable, maybe  not be able to handle the recovery, and maybe commit suicide. Like what do you think was going to happen. 🤦‍♀️ sis LESS IS MORE!!!!.

Relatable. Had 2 foiled attempts, but after the consultation, when COVID-19 hit and all &#34;non-essential&#34; surgeries got canceled. In my case, the surgery had been in works for close to 9 months. I suggest peope not judge other people&#39;s own experiences. We are all different.
</p>
<p>
I do suggest you to try to get things pulled together. Try to get a date, work on the hair removal. Just these two things should improve your mental health.
</p>
<p>
Also, another advice to look closely at Dr. Gallagher to see if she is really the right choice. I personally know a couple of people whose surgeries she botched.

They’re honestly right. You need to get your shit together first. If it’s this easy for you to enter into crisis mode, I can’t imagine you’ll survive post op recovery. It’s rough on the mind and body. You gotta be in a good headspace.

I’m so sorry. I can’t imagine how much this fucking sucks right now. I understand your desperation and I’m sorry that most of the world, and your surgeons do not. I hope the message they sent you at least hinted at potentially allowing you to get surgery once you can get access to mental health treatment.
