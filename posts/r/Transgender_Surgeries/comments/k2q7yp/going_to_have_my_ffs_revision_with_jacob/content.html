Girl, I&#39;m so excited for you! I am 12 days out of healing with Dr. Kuperstock and I am SO thrilled I decided to go to him. I promise you, people in a year or two from now will be talking about him just like Madirossen and Keojampa.
</p>
<p>
His work on my hairline was so so good. Prior to him I was unaware that temple recession can be fixed with FFS but by god he did it, 80% of my temple recession is taken care of and if I want, for a couple thousand I can get hair transplants to polish it off.
</p>
<p>
Here is my before, and then my most recent after:

I&#39;m 12 days out right now.

Thanks!
</p>
<p>
Just curious - When did Kuperstock require payment for your cheek implants? I ask because I’m thinking about calling his office next Monday to ask if it would be okay with them if I put down a deposit of $3,000.
</p>
<p>
I see from your posts that you are into weather, especially that for the DC area, and WWII. Me too! I’m researching about German military officials during the war.

I think it might have been like 1 month or 2 weeks before? I just put all of mine down as soon as he let me.

Thanks Erin for the helpful info. How long did it take for CareFirst to approve your FFS?

The back and forth took about a month.

Thanks again. That gives me about a month of wiggle room before my surgery.

Sadly, I had to postpone my surgery till March 24th contingent on new additional lab results as I have had to contend with other health issues.

I didn&#39;t know it was possible to fill in temporal recession with scalp advancement; thought you needed hair implants for that.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think jaw contouring is necessary; you don&#39;t even have a strong jaw or chin. Reducing bone from the jaw can also cause your lower face to sag prematurely.
</p>
<p>
I think the nose, if done properly, will make a big aesthetic difference.
