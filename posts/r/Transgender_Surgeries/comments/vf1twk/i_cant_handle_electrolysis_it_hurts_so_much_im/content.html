I know exactly what you are going through. I could not handle genital electrolysis and no amount of pain killers or prescription numbing cream would reduce the pain for me. Luckily there are electrologists that work with physicians to provide injectable local anesthesia. It makes a world of difference.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s kind of expensive. I pay around $12/cc of marcaine. It takes around 30cc to fully numb the area. This plus the hourly rate of my electrologist makes one session $500 - $600. But it&#39;s the only way for me to get pubic hair removal besides laser so I have to do it.
</p>
<p>
Also, if you use local numbing cream before the injections they don&#39;t hurt that bad. I barely feel them at all. It turns out it&#39;s the current and heat my body doesn&#39;t tolerate well and not the needles themselves.
</p>
<p>
But definitely do laser first, especially if you have fair skin and dark hair. Laser will greatly reduce your need for future electrolysis and the hair removal is permanent.

I hear constantly varying things about laser being permanent, is there any evidence either way?

<p>
The people who claim laser isn&#39;t permanent don&#39;t understand the caveats that go along with that statement.
</p>
<p>
Because this comes up every single time this is discussed I&#39;ll address it up front: yes, electrolysis is the only FDA approved method of permanent hair &#34;removal&#34;, whereas laser is referred to as hair reduction.
</p>
<p>
Laser treats a wide swathe of hair in one setting. Hairs that are in the active phase of growth, known as anagen, are susceptible to being killed by the laser when it&#39;s delivered. Not all hair is in the anagen stage. It is impossible to tell what stage a hair is in just by looking at it. So when laser treats an area some of the hair will regrow. That regrowth is not dead hair growing back. It&#39;s due to the fact that at the time of treatment not all there hairs were in the active growth phase and therefore not all suspecptible to the laser treatment, and even among those hairs that are actively growing the treatment is not 100% efficient for killing every single hair. So the hair will come back, but it isn&#39;t dead hair returning. It&#39;s dormant hair growing back in plus hairs that weren&#39;t killed in the previous treatment. So you need to go back a certain number of weeks later to catch the hair when it&#39;s in the active growth phase again.
</p>
<p>
How long active growth happens varies with different areas of the body. A good laser tech or electrologist will know when to have you come back for another treatment to be maximally effective.
</p>
<p>
The same thing is true for electrolysis, by the way. If an electrologist zaps a hair that isn&#39;t in anagen it will still come back. Sometimes they can tell because the hair will come out of the follicle easily when tugged with tweezers, but that isn&#39;t perfect. Also, electrolysis isn&#39;t 100% efficient either. There are different settings and modes of treatment the electrologist can use to try to kill the hair and whether or not the hair actually dies depends on them getting those settings right.
</p>
<p>
So even if you to an electrologist and have an entire area cleared you will still get hair coming back. This is because of similar reasons as discussed above. Some of the hair was dormant when the treatment was given and thus not available to the electrologist to treat, some wasn&#39;t even in the anagen stage, and some just weren&#39;t killed during the previous treatment for whatever reason.
</p>
<p>
You can also add in the complicating factor that everyone has vellus hairs and those hairs mature into terminal hairs and there&#39;s no way to stop it. So even if an area is completely cleared of all terminal hairs there are likely still vellus hairs that will mature later and need to be treated.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a complete myth that laser isn&#39;t permanent. A hair that&#39;s dead is dead. It doesn&#39;t matter if it is killed by a laser or an electrolysis needle, it&#39;s still dead.
</p>
<p>
I think this myth continues to be perpetuated by older trans women who were told for years that laser isn&#39;t permanent and isn&#39;t effective. Today&#39;s lasers are much better and more widely available than those several decades ago and the results they deliver are very real.
</p>
<p>
Some electrologists (the honest ones, anyway) are now recommending 6 - 12 laser sessions up front before moving on to electrolysis. Laser tends to have diminishing returns over time and at that point it makes sense to transition to the more focused approach that electrolysis offers.
</p>
<p>
I hope this makes sense.

I need to jump in and offer a contrary opinion. Full disclosure: I am an electrologist. I also have a background in chemistry with a strong emphasis on physics and spectrometry, so I do understand how laser works.
</p>
<p>
I see a wide variety of outcomes with regard to laser, even in clients who are considered &#34;ideal&#34; candidates. Unfortunately, there are so many parameters (skin pigmentation, pulse width, wavelength, etc) that it&#39;s hard to generalize, particularly because clients often have no idea what was done to them. Contrary to what I hear, there has been very little advancement in laser hair treatment, at least as far as the physics is concerned. Modern lasers have things like epidermal cooling, several wavelengths superimposed, ergonomic handpieces, touch screens, and so on, but the actual lasers are the same. I will admit that I don&#39;t see scars in the shape of the laser handpiece across the face anymore. I think this is largely due to more operating training with regard to pigmented skin.
</p>
<p>
The typical outcome that I see is that the follicles get miniaturized. Rather than a mustache composed of thick hairs, for example, the client is left with a mustache of little wispy hairs. In some sense, that&#39;s a win (it looks fine on Instagram) but for me, as an electrologist, those hairs are a nightmare to remove. Imagine sliding a thin needle alongside a thick hair. That&#39;s pretty easy–the follicle is huge. For these little hairs, my accuracy plummets and I have to take my time.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, for many clients, dark hair loses its pigmentation, and I&#39;m left a face-full of little blonde hairs that are impossible to see without cross-shadowing techniques. This result is pretty well documented in the literature, but the reason why this occurs isn&#39;t clear. I speculate that the laser has destroyed the cells responsible for pigmentation (as that&#39;s where the chromophores are), but left the rest of the germinative cells alive. In any case, these hairs often increase in thickness over several years, and I have many clients who have lasered their faces 20 times or so, and they looked pretty good for about four to five years. Now they&#39;re starting to get these thick hairs coming back in, and they come to see me.
</p>
<p>
Other issues are that lasered hairs are fucked up. They are often dystrophic with a tapering root and a lack of a root sheath. Sometimes they snap off when manipulated with the tweezers. They generally are more difficult to remove, and sometimes I feel like I&#39;m pulling teeth. One of my electrologist colleagues has claimed that the laser &#34;spot-welds&#34; the follicle in place, making it extremely hard to extract. I think that metaphor is a bit strained, but generally speaking, virgin hair pops right out, whereas lasered hair is a challenge. (This isn&#39;t always the case. I&#39;ve had a few post-laser clients who were remarkably easy to treat. They&#39;re a minority, and I don&#39;t know why they are different.)
</p>
<p>
Regarding treating hairs not in anagen, electrologists absolutely can treat hairs in telogen. Laser can&#39;t, because the mechanism is optical, and telogen hairs generally lack pigment. For electrologists, we&#39;re just concerned with hitting the dermal papilla. The papilla doesn&#39;t disappear. It&#39;s just situated a little further down from the base of the telogenic hair. Just go a little deeper and hit the area with lye.
</p>
<p>
Regarding depth, have your electrologist use galvanic for the deep ones. The lye will flow throughout the follicle. I generally find that laser isn&#39;t ideal for these incredibly deep hairs. The light attenuates pretty rapidly as you move down the shaft, and very deep hairs are often unaffected. This is why I see a lot of laser girls with plenty of coarse hair on the chin, particularly the sides where they&#39;re deepest. Cheeks and sideburns tend to clear up okay, but the goatee area is rather resistant. (Actually, have your electrologist try galvanic in general; most find it much less painful.)
</p>
<p>
All this being said, I&#39;ve seen plenty of horrible electrolysis, and as someone with electrolysis scars, I also don&#39;t recommend that people just blindly go to their nearest electrologist. You also mention that electrologists are recommending that clients go get a bunch of laser first, and to be honest, I don&#39;t see that happening. Mainly because when you think of hair removal, you immediately think of laser. Most people don&#39;t know what electrolysis is. Furthermore, the standard advice that you see on Reddit is that you should get laser first. Consequently, about 90% of my new clients have already had plenty of laser. They&#39;ve given up on it. No one is advising them to get more.
</p>
<p>
As a final observation, the people who are most eager to give hair-removal advice and send people to laser are simply parroting what they read a few years ago. I see a lot of very authoritative-seeming recommendations for laser, and later on, I see the same user say something like &#34;Well, laser works for me. I&#39;m six sessions in, and I&#39;m 50% clear&#34;. You very very rarely see advice from people who are actually done with hair removal.

This is also valuble information.  There are so many variables among individuals.
</p>
<p>
The amount of time recommended for hair removal (1-2 years by some clinics and electrologists) provides time to adjust the approaches (which might include both laser and electrolysis) and time to catch all hair follicles cycling.

I don&#39;t have the background to dispute most of your claims except your claim that electrolysis treats hair in telogen. This is incorrect according to most sources online. Citations:

I can also tell you from my own experience that I&#39;ve not seen any of the negative effects of laser that you described.
</p>
<p>
And from my experience no one is ever truly done with hair removal. See my above statement on the maturation of vellus hairs. Even cis women will have thick hairs come in on their faces over their lives.

Yes, I&#39;m aware of what other electrologists say about treating telogen hairs. They&#39;re just repeating what an instructor told them long ago. The information on this has shifted in the past 5 years or so. Mike Bono, a blend electrologist in California, has a decent video on this (I don&#39;t have a link handy, but it&#39;s easily searchable).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m done with hair removal. I don&#39;t grow anything. The trans women I know who did extensive galvanic treatments in the 90s are similar, 30 years later.
</p>
<p>
Vellus hair matures when estrogen levels drop and the ratio of T-to-E becomes a little more skewed towards T. This commonly happens in cis women as they near menopause. I have no intention of undergoing menopause. Furthermore, much of my vellus hair has already matured, and it&#39;s been killed. Cis women generally have much more vellus hair when they&#39;re my age, because they haven&#39;t had 20 years of androgenic development.

I can understand what you are saying. But for me I think the best option is to clear most of the hair with laser and then finish the rest with electrolysis. Because if I go full electrolysis I know for sure, even with creams and all I couldn&#39;t handle the pain. I mean with emla I ended up crying just with like 20 hairs off or less.
</p>
<p>
So that&#39;s what I think my best option is. At the end I have dark hair and pale skin. I did laser on my face and with 9 sessions I already have lost 85-90% of my facial hair.

I just looked at your post history, and you have surgery in two months? To be quite honest, I turn people away if they are looking to start that close to their surgery date.

Well, u didn&#39;t read everything then. I&#39;m trying to talk with my surgeon and endocrine to ask if I can postpone my surgery one or one and a half years so I can do it all. But the bad thing is that it could be that I have to wait years and years and I don&#39;t want that. They told me not to worry because the will cauterize all the hair while the operation so it will not grow up inside.

Thank you for taking the time to write this up. This is actually as I also suspect, but I&#39;m not a laser scientist. Like yes I&#39;ve had regrowth on my face after laser but I think that&#39;s new hairs maturing rather than follicles that have been killed a year ago resurrecting.
</p>
<p>
I think this is also clouded by &#39;lasers&#39; like IPL being completely useless. I&#39;ll reconsider a laser pass before finishing up with electrolysis.

Great response. I actually did exactly that for my surgery prep... I did about 12-14 Lazer treatments, and when I went to my electrologist, it only took about 4- two hour sessions to finish. When I went to my consult, the surgeon was so impressed with my progress, that he bumped my surgery by over a year, and said that he had very little scraping of hair follicles during the surgery. Laser hurts, a little... but I couldn&#39;t have made it through the electrolysis if it hadn&#39;t been for the laser first!!!

Yeah it makes sense. I heard about that too that it isn&#39;t permanent. Well I have done 9 sessions on my face and there&#39;s not much hair growing back. A lot of my mustache chin and face are now clean. Yeah there&#39;s still hair but with time I think it will end up disappearing. Yeah probably will need revision every now and then but I will say that the 85% of my facial hair is already gone.

Yeah I know about the injections. But like I said sadly there&#39;s a lot of my hair that are to deep for the needle to reach them so it will be ineffective. So I will pay for nothing. And the creams don&#39;t work for me. Today I used emla one hour before the session and 600mg of ibuprofen and nothing. It hurts so much and I can&#39;t handle.
</p>
<p>
And about the injections, I searched it where I live and no one does it. There is like just 4 or 5 sites where they do electrolysis in my city and going to other places it&#39;s impossible for me. I&#39;m just a student living with my mother and we live very tight with money so I can barely pay the sessions. Here at least it&#39;s pretty cheap like 30€ per LHR session on the surgical zone. My face I could do it because a friend of my cousin does it and it&#39;s just 50€/4 sessions.

Where can I find these services? I&#39;m in Florida and I couldn&#39;t find anything like that anywhere :(
</p>

Not to mention I have found out the head laser technician and owner of the best practice near me... is transphobic (or at best just tolerates trans people for their income).

I mean... Florida, right? You may have to travel out if state for this service. Many people rave about Electrology 3000 in Texas but I&#39;ve never been there. You could probably find this service in major cities like NYC, Chicago, and LA if you research.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it&#39;s up to the individual electrologist what areas of the body they&#39;re willing to work on and whether or not they partner with a physician to offer anesthesia services. I can tell you that I live in a major city and there are only two trans friendly electrology clinics that I&#39;m aware of in my area. I&#39;ve called around to other electrologists nearby and was mostly told they don&#39;t like to work on trans women because we have &#34;too much hair&#34;, or that they would not do pubic electrolysis at all.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately Florida is one of the worst states to be trans.

Where in Florida? If it’s north Florida, then yea, it is difficult. Jacksonville is the only place with electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
Central Florida is almost a wasteland outside of Orlando and Tampa/St.Pete. I live in St. Pete and have an amazing electrolysist and there is another in Tampa who has like 75% trans clientele and there are 4 laser places within walking distance of me right now, they seem to be on every corner.
</p>
<p>
South Florida is easy. The Miami area has EVERYTHING you need to transition. Laser, electrolysis, and gender specializing surgeons

I&#39;m in the Orlando area but most places don&#39;t do electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
The whole anesthesia during it is another service I&#39;d be very interested in.

<p>
Can you send me the place in Tampa? I&#39;m willing to drive if they&#39;re supportive.

Not all surgeons require permanent hair removal prior to a vaginoplasty. Maybe you should look change your pursuit to one of those surgeons.

Penile inversion doesn&#39;t necessarily require permanent removal. I had that but what my surgon did was he cauterized the skin durning surgrey in order to prevent internal hair growth.

I to have been struggling with electrolysis so I first started with trying TKTX numbing cream it helped alot. But I was still struggling with the discomfort and pain of the upper lip and near nostril.
</p>
<p>
So I looked into other numbing creams and I came across a life saver called need to be numb which claims to be 2 times stronger ger than the TKTX.
</p>
<p>
I honestly could not big this cream up enough it has made my treatments so much more bearable and more progress can be made with out stoppages so please get your self some 😊 x

For those like me who are blonde or otherwise do need electrolysis but find it too painful: I highly highly recommend large volume. There&#39;s a few places that do it so likely you&#39;d need to travel, but they work with a physician who can administer an IV anesthetic and then use local injected anesthetic after it kicks in. They&#39;ll generally do &#34;everything&#34; in ~7 hours and then you come back in 3-4 months and they do it again. It takes 4 or so sessions because of how hair growth cycles work.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a lot of up-front costs but, at least based on the math I did for my personal experience, I
<em>
think
</em>
it&#39;s cheaper or about the same in the long run. They can do face and genitals at the same time. Honestly it&#39;s a godsend.

Ye. Being Latina, I opted for LHR because the roots of my facial hair are so thick and coarse and deep that I could never do electro, despite it being more permanent.
</p>
<p>
My greatest hope is that they can one day invent some kind of drug or cream that targets facial hair specifically

In my case I started LHR on my face 1 year ago because I didn&#39;t know that electrolysis exist until 2 weeks ago. But well with what they told me today about my hair I doubt I could have done it on my face too. So well LHR it&#39;s my only option right now. At least I can take like 80-90% of the hair and when they operate me they can take the rest by cauterizing them.
</p>
<p>
And yeah I hope for that too. One day people will be able to do what we have done without having to suffer.

That’s honestly ur best bet, laser is actually pretty sufficient to me I’ve got six sessions done on my underarms for example and it’s barely any hair like one spec maybe and if they scrape the hair follicles u should be good honestly.

Mitra plus is what you need! Apply thickly and wrap in cling film for 1.5 hours It helps a lot!!!! Or even get Emla which is half strength

Mithra plus works. And if you are looking for GRS, then electrlysis is the way to go. As I did laser for 10 sessions they came back again.
</p>
<p>
For other area, laser is a good option for quick and fix

Well laser depends on the hair type. Lucky me I have the best duo, black and thick hair and pale skin. So laser works the best on my body, 9 sessions of laser on my face 85% of my facial hair already gone and didn&#39;t grow up. And like I said she told me that there is hair to deep that the needle can&#39;t reach the hair so it will be pretty ineffective.

Okie! I wish you all the best. I have the same skin color and hair color as you. However, if you are looking for bottom surgery, electrolysis will have to be only way to go when comes to hair removal for vagina canal.

My surgeon said that when they do the surgery they will cauterize the hair of the skin. If I do some laser sessions and then the surgery, there should be no problem no? I mean I can get ride of the most of the hair and they just cauterize the rest.
</p>
<p>
People are telling me that just electrolysis, but like I said I can&#39;t, it&#39;s impossible to handle the pain. Not even with creams. It&#39;s really the only way?

Yep, you don’t want to live in regret and hair in the canal  even Suporn clinic recommend electrolysis, and give our skin 6 months rest period before the surgery.

Did you try mithra + ?

OK, you seem to be missing some ESSENTIAL information. IPL equipment can be had for a relatively inexpensive financial outlay (less than $200)....and, as YOU perform the &#34;application,&#34; you&#39;re not paying anyone for &#34;labor.&#34; I procured mine about a year ago...and my torso and legs are pretty much 100% hairless by this point (and with VERY little discomfort through it all). Laser or electrolysis can &#34;send you to the poor-house!!!&#34; Not only that, but the lamp in the &#34;gun&#34; is good for some 300,000 flashes!!!
</p>
<p>
About the only downside...that I can see...is that if there are hairs (in certain areas) that are not dark, IPL won&#39;t do much (e.g., at my age, hair on my face is kinda gray)...and that you
<strong>
ABSOLUTELY
</strong>
must follow the protocols (such as use of the dark glasses provided with the equipment)...and not overdoing on a given area of skin. This is powerful technology and you MUST not be SLOPPY about use of it. Frankly, as a doctor myself, I&#39;m kinda surprised that &#34;regular folks&#34; can get their mitts on it. It CAN be risky...if misused!!!!!

I can handle laser hair removal with diode that is the best one of all LHR. But electrolysis it&#39;s impossible to me. I couldn&#39;t handle 15 mins of it, not even 20 hairs out. Lucky of me I have dark hair and pale skin so I&#39;m the ideal type for LHR so that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do. It&#39;s cheaper and I can pay for it. But electrolysis is 60€ an hour, and if it&#39;s ever 3 weeks it&#39;s impossible for me to pay it.
</p>
<p>
So I think LHR it&#39;s the best for me. People says that with creams you can handle the pain. But not even with emla I could handle the pain. So impossible with something a little bit better. I don&#39;t have the money right now to pay for everything. And well like they told me, there are hairs that the needle couldn&#39;t reach so it&#39;s a no from me I don&#39;t want to pay if the results are not gonna be 100% like they said.

Because I already done LHR on my face and I think it&#39;s the better for me. And well it&#39;s cheaper where I do it. Like 25 € session.

I have some annoying blonde hairs on my face. Electrolysis just made me cry. Painful plus the dysphoria was just too much. Sometimes I could hold it in until I got to my car and then would just break down. I hit it with laser every 3mo for 120$. Don’t have to shave for weeks then maybe once every few days toward the end of the few months. No one can see it, I just want my face perfectly smooth. I literally don’t know how people make it through electrolysis.

I thought they scraped the hair folicals away during surgery.

Yeah they do but there could be hair that didn&#39;t grow up or hairs that they miss and that could end up inside the vagina. So better be prepared.

I asked my dermatologist to prescribe a 10% topical anesthetic  and it helped much better than the over the counter 5%

It&#39;s not just the unbearable pain. Here in my city there&#39;s just a few places where they do electrolysis. And like I said today they told me there&#39;s follicles that the needle can&#39;t reach. So there will be a lot of difficulties and ineffectiveness and they recommended me to do LHR. And then on the surgery they will cauterize the rest of the hair.
