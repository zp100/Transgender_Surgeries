<p>
I’ve talked about the issues I’ve had with Dr. Jun and my Vaginoplasty but what occurred yesterday caused me even more harm. I asked for a post-op appointment because my quality of life is terrible even 5 months post op. I pee absolutely everywhere (all over my legs, rear, etc regardless of sitting position), my canal is extremely painful especially at the entrance where there is excessive scar tissue making every dilation session hell, and aesthetically its just not correct. Regardless of what had happened I needed a post-op with the original surgeon, I need my life back.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to talk to Dr. Jun before the appointment to clear the air a bit and for me to feel comfortable opening my legs up in front of a doctor who had verbally abused me in the past. Instead of this happening he barraged me in the meeting by saying he was not comfortable ever operating on me again regardless of revision needs. I was a mess and just broke down crying in front of all 3 people in the room. This lasted for awhile and eventually we got to the point of the exam. I should have left before this, but having three medical professionals standing in front of you telling you to do something while you feel vulnerable is a hard situation.
</p>
<p>
The next part is one that is causing me a lot of pain. After I got undressed and Dr. Jun, his PA, and a nurse all came back in, instead of performing an exam on me Dr. Jun retreated to the corner of the room. Suddenly his PA was the one between my legs, and Dr. Jun made clear he was not comfortable performing an exam on me.
</p>
<p>
I would have never showed up to see this doctor who had treated me so badly if I had known this was the case. I was only there due to being in severe pain and not being able to pee outside of my own home. When your quality of life is this bad you can forgive a lot to try to get the care you need.
</p>
<p>
I felt so ashamed with my legs wide open and my surgeon standing at a distance, unwilling to even examine his own work or take responsibility for these significant complications. I’m ashamed of my body, and looking at my genitals is now a reminder of broken promises and significant trauma.
</p>
<p>
I’ve said before that Dr. Jun is not the right doctor for anyone. I should have followed my own damn advice but I had imminent issues and setting up care with a new GCS surgeon takes a long time. But instead of receiving care I need, I saw a doctor who played the victim and made me feel ashamed of the genitals he had created. I’m broken over this experience, and it will take a lot of therapy and time to get over what has happened.

I had the exact same thing happen at my preop, there was a stunning lack of empathy and care from the doctor and his PA, they had me undress and then measured me and proceeded to lecture me. I left the office crying and no one has followed up since that day. The lack of care shouldn&#39;t be allowed to continue.

I had a very similar experience at my first ever consult almost a year ago, it felt like the surgeon didn’t even want to be there and almost like they were rolling their eyes at my questions , and furthermore they gave incorrect information about what insurances they take prior to our appointment so we couldn’t go with them anyways, I also ended up in tears on the way out with my mom and it ended up being a huge waste of time in the end. Now I have a consult in 2 days with Dr. Pang at align surgical and it seems better so far and I’ve heard good things so here’s hoping he’s like an actual human with empathy lol

Thank you for sharing; I&#39;ll be sure to mention this to others, in hopes of protecting them from the same kind of treatment.
</p>
<p>
For similar &#34;disinterest / lack of concern&#34; reasons, I
<strong>
do not
</strong>
recommend Dr. Benny Tan in Jacksonville, FL.

yep, if you look at the Wiki, there are
<em>
ton
</em>
in Florida, and they&#39;re almost all terrible.  Florida&#39;s laws, when it comes to medical malpractice, are a dream for shady doctors/surgeons.  I live very close to Florida and looked through every single surgeon there, and yeah... I&#39;ll be flying to either CA or NY to get surgery.  Not Florida.

Not gonna lie I didn&#39;t check I was just surprised with the current discourse in the states with Florida being in the lead when it comes to making things awful for anyone who isn&#39;t the gender they&#39;re  born with or looks like that

There are two which my insurance would (have) pay for; one, in Jacksonville, Dr. Benny Tan (don&#39;t go to him; I really didn&#39;t feel comfortable with him for several reasons) told me &#34;I&#39;m too old&#34; (look at my profile picture;
<strong>
<em>
I&#39;m
</em>
</strong>
<em>
too old??
</em>
); that, &#34;one of his last patients was 59 and had a lot of problems&#34;.
</p>
<p>
That doesn&#39;t tell me what physical condition the patient was in; what their motivation / level of desire was; if they followed post-op protocols, etc etc.  Tan made me have 3 visits over six months (half a year, in my book) - when he knew what my age was prior to my first appointment.  Personally, I think it was merely income generation from the cost of the visits.
</p>
<p>
The other surgeon?  I saw some of the typical &#34;before and after&#34; photos, and his work looked like
<em>
Uncooked Thanksgiving Turkey Butts
</em>
.  And, even when I was a 15 year old virgin and a change in the direction of a breeze would have aroused, um, my attention - I would have said
<em>
No, thank you, I&#39;m good
</em>
- If I had seen this guy&#39;s work.  So, there&#39;s that...
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I&#39;ve recently seen some pictures of work done by Dr. John Whitehead, in Miami - and, OMG, what - just...
<strong>
<em>
natural
</em>
</strong>
... results he achieves!  I&#39;m going to make an appointment to see him; if mine comes out so nice, I&#39;ll just look in a hand-mirror all day instead of ever looking at porn again!

If you can make it to Spokane WA I suggest consulting with Dr. Stiller. (Stiller Aesthetics) to see if there is anything that he can do for you.

He was up and coming 2 years ago and obviously has changed his demeanor, I was gas lit by him on a 35 minute video consult - he bragged he’s had worse than mine for revisions and yet wouldn’t touch my issues/needs - there web site wants to know your American Insurance 1 st , I was Canadian self pay , obviously he knew it was not the way he’s used to making his money - self pay was a joke to him , he’s not stupid quite frankly - I was gas lit told to be on my way !

Let some time pass, so you don’t make any decisions while your emotions are a wreck. This work CAN BE FIXED! I’m the meantime begin researching for other surgeons that correct the mistakes of others. You will need to calm down and take charge of your situation. Yes, it sucks I grant you. Make new plans. The past is gone and that’s it. You have the future ahead of you. Get plenty of advice from trusted people, make lots of surgeon visits. Happiness IS going to happen, time is your friend! Slow your emotions down! You need to have a clear head to make great plans. I wish you the best, everything WILL work out. Promise!

Not from US. But accountability is missing here as well. We need to use reddit and other tools to inform everyone of the malpractice like this. Ideally stickied, constantly updated thread

Yeah, not exactly. The issue with this is that he can argue he isn’t at fault because of ‘circumstances’ beyond his control. So he could say that the recovery process didn’t go as planned. It’s actually very hard to prove medical liability and sue surgeons.

I went into diabetic ketoacidosis because of jardiance, and went into the emergency room five times over the course of about a week. I was acting drunk, my heart was pounding, I couldn’t eat or drink, and I was exhausted. Jardiance wrecked my insulin resistance, and basically made my diabetes progress to the point of needing injectables. After the ER finally saw my blood was acidic and unsafe, they said I’d need to be on insulin for life. They talked about how I wouldn’t have lived another day, and the ICU battled it out with the ER staff to determine if I needed to be in a medically induced coma. Keep in mind, this is the same ER five times in a row. 1-4 they told me I was fine, it was a cold or something, just drink fluids. Government healthcare. No lawyer would take my case, I called easily a dozen.

I can relate to this, but he shamed my mental state, not my physical body. I had an appointment with Dr. Jun in San Francisco recently, but this was a pre-op of sorts. He wanted to take a look at my appendectomy scar and get a feel for what he needed to do to give me a good PIV result, but he ended up refusing to operate on me. The reason? He didn&#39;t feel comfortable giving me additional scars based on the fact that I felt terrible about my appendectomy scar. Which...what? Like, yeah, I hate my scar. Guilty as charged. Most people with a scar like mine would absolutely hate having said scar. It&#39;s pretty fugly. But that&#39;s not a reason to cancel a scheduled surgery, especially when said surgery would resolve a much greater problem. Nothing I asked or said mattered at all, though. He smelled a future malpractice lawsuit and ran for the hills, plain and simple.
</p>
<p>
By the way, this all happened after he essentially downgraded me from a PPT to a PIV over a video call in response to my questions about how my prior surgeries might affect the result. He left it up to me, ultimately, but he absolutely pressured me to change to a PIV. He was probably right about PPT being risky for me, but it&#39;s a pattern, you know? Dude

away from anything he perceives as a potential threat to his practice.
</p>
<p>
Also, the Crane Center kinda just sucks ass in general. I lost count of how many times I had to tell them the same things, answer the same questions, and update the same information over and over again because nobody over there seemed to believe in actually writing anything down or making any changes to their records.

I am so sorry, and I think you hit it on the nose. In the words of my psychiatrist today “he was scared.” But playing the victim while serving a vulnerable population prone to trauma will not get you very far.

Please submit a complaint, if more of us do it it’ll help. Jun is a DO so it would be for the Osteopathic Medical Board of CA. If you need any help DM me. We cannot allow this behavior to continue. Jun’s NPI aka provider ID is 1093056574 for when you have to enter that.

Ugh, so its a situation that if you&#39;d kept quiet he might have offered help? That&#39;s not cool. It&#39;s not like you wouldn&#39;t go back and say what a great job he did fixing it. Revisions are sometimes necessary.

Yup, he even mentioned my reddit posts as “concerning.” But I will never stay quiet when it comes to this community, I care about the care we all receive greatly. And whoever fixes this will certainly get a glowing recommendation from me, as they should. We need providers who care more about their patients health than personal vendettas.

Jesus I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you. He was the one US doctor I was srs considreing ):. BTW if your having issues with tightness at the opening due to excessive scar tissue this could be an easy pretty non invasive fix to get done in the meanwhile while u look for a revision

Not long at all, he has hired multiple people to work at his clinic using his methods. I use Dayna and she’s fantastic. You don’t need to see Dr. Powers directly.

Not sure why people are downvoting. I’m familiar with the op and she has not had a great track record for turning everyone against her wherever she goes.
</p>
<p>
Dr Jun did a fantastic job for me and people who are dissuaded because of one person with a bad experience need to know that for every one person unhappy with his results there’s 200 happy patients.
</p>
<p>
Surgeries are complex and healing varies person to person. People: do not trust a single patient. Trust a pattern. And even then be skeptical because often more people complain than praise.
</p>
<p>
Many more people are happy with Dr Jun than aren’t. If you downvote me you are saying my happiness with my surgery is not valid.

In the right hands its incredible. And I’m still very glad I don’t have a penis anymore. I regret my choice of surgeon deeply, but don’t let one bad surgeon detract you from other excellent choices.

And Dr Jun was trained by BlueBond Langner and still talks to them all the time. They use the exact same method. Don’t know too much about some of the others but Dr Jun is a great choice too.

Consider zero depth. Much faster recovery, less invasive. I&#39;m 64 and that&#39;s only thing I would consider.

FWIW, sexual function is ABSOLUTELY possible with zero depth. Penetration is not the only form of sexual pleasure. I am able to orgasm quite comfortably with my zero depth vaginoplasty, for example

If you want to be rid of the penis, don&#39;t want months of recovery and repeated revisions, zero depth is worth considering. You forget or don&#39;t mention anal. Yeah it&#39;s really a thing.

Zero depth has both function and feeling. The only function it doesn&#39;t have is the ability to have penetrative sex (ideal for ace folks or lesbians who don&#39;t enjoy penetration). Zero depth is a 100% valid choice for folks who want faster recovery times, no dilation, and an overall less invasive surgery.

I&#39;m completely sorry for what this evil being did to you!
</p>
<p>
I understand you so much, after a horrible experience with Javier belinky in Buenos Aires ARG in 2021. You can check my long post about it. It took me so long to be able to openly speak about how bad he and his team mistreated me and left me helpless with complications and verbally abusing me all the time!
</p>
<p>
I posted a Facebook Review in his fanpage but it doesn&#39;t shows, because it&#39;s the ONLY review he has. Many other girls surely are afraid of speak out of the same abuse &amp; mistreatment he gave them like he did to me (I know this from a extremely reliable source).

Dr Jun&#39;s work isn&#39;t and was never aesthetically good. I recommend everyone to go to Thailand to dr Bank. In the US you are not a person, you are just a number. Dr Bank offers top quality service and his results are 100% cis looking. I know many girls from Switzerland who went with him and there are not differences between their vaginas and cis vaginas.
</p>
<p>
The same for ffs. In the US you will look like a feminine Trans. In Europe and Korea you will look cis. Soft, natural and feminine.

I’m going to disagree with you about what looks 100% cis. The Thai doctors seem to have a bit of a different look but dr jun has an excellent aesthetic in my opinion. Many other us doctors do too. To make a blanket statement like that is very irresponsible and invalidating for all his patients, especially the ones who are happy with their results.

No I went to Dr Jun because I think his aesthetic is very good. NO surgeon is 100% cis. It’s not possible for a few reasons but Dr Jun gets very very close. It may not be what you are going for. Thai surgeons have a different look. But it’s still excellent and saying you’re a perfectionist as if I’m not is still rude.

All the patient outcomes I’ve seen aside from what is being said here, thus far, have been very good in terms of aesthetics.   I still have yet to get a call back from Dr. Jun but I was blown away by how real his work looked

Sorry but Dr Jun&#39;s aesthetic is not good in my opinion. Once you open the legs and stretch the lips it is clear it is an ok neo vagina and definitely not a cis one. Again the only important thing is your happiness.

What surgeons make a defined labia minora with pink inside (from urethra probably)? I don&#39;t think I saw any photos like that, but I may have missed it as there are a lot of photos here...

And Dr Bank Labia Minora is pink and the inside is totally cis passing. All my Swiss friends (4) went to him and their vaginas look exactly the same. There is also a Discord group for Bank patients and future patients and the very majority of results are cis passing. When I say cis passing it is really cis passing. There are a very very small group of girls who have PERFECT results but not cis passing, because they were circumcised or for any other reason. Dr bank always offer free aesthetic revision for the fourchette, labia minora, inside in order for the vagina to look completely cis.

The tissue is pink if you are uncircumcised as he uses the prepuce tissue for the  labia minora. Looking at that tissue right now on my body it’s pretty darn pink and that’s what he uses to make the inner labia minora.
</p>
<p>
Edit; the mucosa tissue from inside the canal comes from your tunica vaginalis tissue not your prepuce btw

I know very well vaginas and Dr Bank results are 100% cis passing, at least those I saw in person in Switzerland and on Discord. I don&#39;t know how he manages to make the tissue paper thin and so soft and pink.

In Europe people don&#39;t show their results online. There are many completely unknown ffs surgeons in Europe. Even very masculine faces turn out completely cis French model face. But you should have insurance in France, Switzerland, Spain... etc it is much more expensive than in the US.

I&#39;ve had multiple people reach out to me due to my posts who feel the same way and who have had similar issues. This includes some seeking further legal action against Jun and/or the Crane Center, this is not an isolated incident. Oftentimes people in our community are afraid to speak up against providers. And so I feel it is right to express exactly what happened to me.

You have a new account with no user history. You&#39;re post are irritating and unkind. You sound like someone who is making excuses on behalf of Dr Jun&#39;s practice by casting doubt about someone else&#39;s surgery experience. I&#39;m leaving your comments in place so everyone can see what&#39;s being said but most appear to feel pretty negative about your comments.

She is lying about some very wonderful people her experience her in her own invention. Ask yourselves why a doctor would require not just 1 but 2 witnesses be present for a basic examination op is trying to frame herself as this big victim when it’s very clear she has been the problem. I’m not making any excuses but she is living in a fantasy world where she can do no wrong.
