I was able to get the sutures off my nose (still have the internal ones, they&#39;ll dissolve) today, as well as half the staples. I&#39;ll get the other staples out on the 12th. I was able to take the nose splint off for a bit today, but they recommended I keep it on for another week just to protect my nose bridge from having anything bump it and knock it out of shape.
</p>
<p>
Overall, pain level is pretty easily manageable. My hair is wet here because I was finally able to wash my hair after a week. It was so damn gross and it feels wonderful to have clean hair again. The incision is from ear to ear, over the top of my head, so it runs through my hair and can&#39;t really be seen.
</p>
<p>
My hairline was moved up a bit relative to my skull, but the distance to the eyebrows is the same, so proportionally, my hairline hasn&#39;t moved. Nose looks *totally* different and I&#39;m honestly quite impressed. I can&#39;t wait to see when the swelling goes down more!
</p>
<p>
(Swelling in the cartilage of the nose can take up to a year to fully go away. One of my nurses had had a full rhinoplasty and she said her nose didn&#39;t look like what it does today until about a year after her surgery.
</p>
<p>
I will say this, I have no touch sensation in my forehead from my eyelids to the incision on my scalp. It feels deadened, like when you get Novocain. Part of that is due to the surgery still being so recently done and part of it is because I had some accessory nerves coming out of my brow ridge that shouldn&#39;t have been there. So due to having to remove the bone they were coming out of, they couldn&#39;t be salvaged. I expect I have to wait for my brain to adjust to having the number of nerves that area was supposed to have rather than those extras.)

Totally strange about the extra nerves!  That will take some time to adjust to!  Does that mean your brows are a bit numb right now?

From my eye brows to the scalp incision is basically numb. There&#39;s a section in the center of my forehead running up and back that isn&#39;t. It&#39;s really weird feeling.

I&#39;ve been debating if I could deal with numbness like that which might not go away.  Looking better is always a plus but ooof the feels.  Big huggles I&#39;m sure things will equalize over time, but I imagine it will take months before things feel normal.

Oh, it&#39;s starting to regain feeling again. It&#39;s very bizarre and I love getting to feel things like this. The first time I ever had an IV it was a saline solution and I&#39;d been doing a fitness test in boot camp. I got dehydrated and was overheated and I could feel the saline going into my arm and then crawling through my veins. Like, the temperature difference made me aware of the inside of my arm and it was one of the most awesome experiences of my life. (As crappy as that sounds for being a life experience, I&#39;m utterly fascinated by all things related to human anatomy, physiology, and psychology lol)

Thanks for sharing. I have FFS with Mundinger in May. Update? Are you still happy with the results?
</p>
<p>
He warned me about the numbness in my scalp/forehead. I had to think long and hard about that one!
