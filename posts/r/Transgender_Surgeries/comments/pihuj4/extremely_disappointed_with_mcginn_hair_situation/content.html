Surgeons generally have a very poor understanding of how long it takes to remove hair. Seven months is simply not enough time to remove hair in multiple cycles and to verify that it won&#39;t come back. I&#39;m a member of several private electrologist forums, and the members are all frustrated with the misinformation that surgeons provide. Clients tend to want to believe MDs--despite their lack of hair removal expertise--over electrologists.

Sigmoid avoids it. Peritoneal typically still requires some hair removal. If you want to ensure no hair, start your hair removal now. Give yourself plenty of time.

I wonder if it’s at all possible to even have 0 hair if you were initially furry. I’d love to hear what other people say.

This is hard because hair growth is so different from person to person. With different hair cycles, among other factors, hair can appear to be gone but often comes back. It is best to make sure you have no regrowth for a few months.  And its hard to say how many hours of electrolysis you need as that varies, again, by person. Im surprised, because during my consult, and in the papers, it was made clear to me that all hair cannot be guaranteed to be removed.
</p>
<p>
Either way, Im sorry to hear that this happened to you. It is possible that over time, the hairs may stop growing as a neovagina isn&#39;t exactly hair friendly. Kind of like many people lose the hair on the back of their calves because of pant friction. Are the hairs like full maturity and thick, or soft and more subtle? After most of my hair removal, the remaining hair I have is almost more like fuzz than hair. I&#39;m still gonna do some more electrolysis, but I figure it couldn&#39;t be too bothersome

I&#39;m sure all surgeons know about this and few if any of them will tell you of the risks. I don&#39;t understand how you are expected to consent to surgery when you&#39;re not aware of the risks, but here we are.
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s very time consuming to get rid of it properly, and most people don&#39;t have a problem post-op. That&#39;s fine if you understand the risk you&#39;re taking by not spending the time (and money/pain), but few do. You can see this every time this subject comes up.
</p>
<p>
If its beyond the depth an electrologist can work I believe its possible for a surgeon or gynecologist to (electrically) cauterize the hairs, if you can find one who will do it. There&#39;s a limit to depth for electrolysis due to the angle the of the probe against the skin.
</p>
<p>
Possibly the hair follicles can be cauterized with silver nitrate by a doctor, but best be careful with that stuff. I’m not sure it’s possible to cauterise to a sufficient depth to kill the hair with silver nitrate.

Everyone is different. That’s why they can’t guarantee that you would have absolutely no hair. I wouldn’t trust a surgeon who made an absolute statement like you’re looking for. Yeah, it sucks, but you probably should’ve done a little more research to know what a reasonable time frame would be for maximum hair removal.

I know an electrologist who will go in with a speculum and get them.

There&#39;s a limit to how far deep you can go with an electrolysis probe due to the angle of the probe/hairs.
