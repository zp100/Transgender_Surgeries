So about a month before I had surgery I lurked through here like crazy. I freaked myself out because there was post after post calling Brassard a butcher, complaining about complications, and dragging his staff through the mud. There was all sorts of post op pictures that looked like horror stories and I was terrified. I don&#39;t come from the kind of money to afford any surgery out of pocket and I&#39;m lucky enough to live in Canada where he was covered and so it was my only option.
</p>
<p>
I made this account for the soul purpose of this post because I didn&#39;t have complications. Not a single one. I don&#39;t have any crazy scars, the staff was very nice with me and I&#39;m thrilled with the result. I felt obligated to make this post for people like me who are nervous about their upcoming surgeries. Leading up to it CAMH made me read out a list of everything that could go wrong and explain that I was aware of all these things and still wanted surgery and it turned out to be nothing but a scare tactic. Im 8 weeks post op and from the outside visually I&#39;m fully healed. In the recovery centre I was with about 15 people who had the same surgery as me and only one person had complications. Her complications were because she refused to get out of bed, didn&#39;t drink water, wouldn&#39;t go downstairs to eat and was ignoring her aftercare like crazy. Other than that every person I was with had a relatively easy recovery.
</p>
<p>
Im not saying it wasn&#39;t difficult it was the hardest 2 weeks of my life, the pain is incredible. The humiliation of pooping yourself or passing out and throwing up and so many doctors and nurses looking at your naked body is a lot but the people I encountered there were so nice about it. So accomadating. Im really happy with my experience in spite of all those things.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I hope this helps anyone who is freaking out like I was

Thank you. My date is coming up in May. It seems like a lot of people report their bad outcomes and experiences with Brassard, which certainly makes me nervous. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è

If you&#39;re having standard penile inversion, you should not expect to self lubricate enough for penetrative sex. There&#39;s just no internal biological mechanism to make this happen, and very few people lubricate enough via their urethra for sex. This is a reality and known limitation with penile inversion. I get incredibly wet when I&#39;m turned on, but it&#39;s not internal and not enough for penetrative sex -- I have to supplement with lube like 99% of other penile inversion patients.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not trying to be a downer, but you need to be realistic about it. This is one of the reasons folks are excited about newer techniques like peritoneal, but very few surgeons perform that yet, and it&#39;s not time-tested.

Using lube during sex really isn&#39;t that big of a deal. If you use good lube, you don&#39;t need to reapply very often and it doesn&#39;t interfere with anything. My favorite for dilating is Slippery Stuff Gel, and it&#39;s my fave for sex too. It&#39;s affordable, doesn&#39;t contain glycerin, has zero smell, and cleans up really easily. I&#39;ve tried lots of different lubes, and I always go back to it. In the US you can get 2x 16oz bottles (or one 32oz bottle) on Amazon for about $25.

Hey so I&#39;m not sure about the specific technique your talking about. What I was told is that he has changed his technique recently. Apparently after working in tandem with Maude Belanger her suture technique was so advanced he modelled his surgeries off of her improvements.
<br>
I was talking with nurses in the recovery centre and they all said since this change post op need for pain meds was significantly lower and that people have been recovering faster. I hope that helps

Lack of
<em>
internal
</em>
lubrication is an issue with standard penile inversion regardless of surgeon. Having a different surgeon isn&#39;t going to change the way you self lubricate
<em>
unless
</em>
they&#39;re using sigmoid colon or one of the peritoneal techniques, but those are
<em>
not
</em>
standard penile inversion. How much you
<em>
externally
</em>
self lubricate is completely down to your own body and how much it produces.
</p>
<p>
As far as I know, Brassard doesn&#39;t perform any of the peritoneal techniques. I only know of like four US surgeons that do, and
<em>
maybe
</em>
one in Europe that I&#39;ve heard things about. It&#39;s a
<em>
very
</em>
new technique in the world of GRS.
</p>
<p>
Asking questions is a
<em>
very
</em>
good thing, especially when it comes to major surgery. I&#39;m in the US, so my knowledge of Canadian surgeons is limited. I do know that there are finally more surgeons in Canada coming into the picture (and at least some of whom were trained by Marci Bowers), which is fantastic, but I don&#39;t know anything about them.

Toronto is up and running, they did their first bottom surgeries in June with Dr Bowers, and have started doing independent surgeries since then. Their baseline technique is a modified penile inversion, just like Dr. Bowers.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m scheduled for surgery with them in the 25th, and I plan to post updates afterwards. Feel free to ask me anything in the meantime.

I was including using tunica vaginalis, since it is a type of peritoneal technique. That&#39;s why I avoided stating peritoneal Pull-Through specially. But at any rate, you&#39;re right in that Drs B-L and Avanessian are some of the only surgeons currently performing those techniques. Ting does too, and Bowers does, but AFAIK only when she&#39;s at Mt. Sinai. I don&#39;t know of any other surgeons in the US who are performing why kind of peritoneal techniques, although I would assume at least some are training to. I&#39;ve heard others stating that they kinda want to give it a little time first to see how those types of grafts hold up in the longer run, especially when it comes to penetrative sex.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Funny enough, Dr Brassard trained Dr Bowers who developed the PI with peritoneal graft, and Dr Bowers trained the new Toronto surgeons.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That&#39;s only partially accurate. Dr. Stanley Biber trained Dr. Bowers, and she ended up taking over his practice here in Trinidad, CO in 2003 (she&#39;s since moved to CA, but she&#39;s returned here many times over the past couple years to train surgeons at Denver Health, who did my GRS.) At any rate, Dr. Bowers wanted to improve on Dr. Bibers techniques, which she eventually collaborated with Dr. Brassard on, and he showed her some of his techniques. He did
<em>
not
</em>
train her as a GRS surgeon overall though, she already was one.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know that Bowers developed the PI with peritoneal technique, at least not entirely. I actually think it was a collaborative effort among a few folks, namely some of the other few surgeons who offer it. She
<em>
has
</em>
trained some of the new Toronto surgeons though, which is cool. She also trained my surgeon (Dr. Jennifer Hyer at Denver Health) and she does fantastic work, so the new Canadian surgeons should do great work too.

as far as depth goes, I make it to the second last dot on the #3 dilator and the 3rd last dot on the #4 dilator.Most of my swelling has gone down so thats probably the final depth.
</p>
<p>
Self lubrication - Maybe this is TMI or NSFW but I gave my boyfriend head a couple days ago and pretty much ruined an expensive pair of panties with how wet I was.

Very curious - what technique did he use to allow you to become that wet?  I&#39;m just learning what options there are as I&#39;m finally to a point that this is a near future plan of mine.

here to bump! dr brassard was actually super caring. nurses were pretty much all amazing, two in particular I&#39;ll never forget because they helped me through crises. I did have a pretty scary complication the first night, but by the second night I was basically on my way. probably the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever been through too, but I have nothing but positive feelings for brassard and his team

When you do as many surgeries as Brassard does, there are bound a small very vocal % of people who are not happy, had complications, or had expectations way to high.
</p>
<p>
The people that are happy with his results don‚Äôt really post about it on the internet, it‚Äôs the people with bad experiences who do. So the ratio with good to bad reviews with him isn‚Äôt correct on Reddit.

yeah re reading the way I wrote it, you&#39;re right it was problematic. I just found in my personal experience they made me go to two separate appointments with them and explicitly tell them I could die, it was me sitting in a room with 2 extremely gatekeepy cis men pointing out the obvious and making me very uncomfortable. Yes this surgery is a risk but when you have a heart attack they don&#39;t make you sit down with a panel of doctors and explain how dangerous it is they just cut your heart open. I feel like just applying for surgery really should be enough and it really took a lot out of me to have these men police what I could and couldn&#39;t do with my own body. in those appointments they really made me feel like it was my job to prove I was trans enough, to the point I felt so badgered by them I started dropping words like my boyfriend every other sentence. They would do stuff like ask me if I tucked (as I sat there in front of them in yoga pants) it was invasive and left me pretty bitter about their whole process. All it really did was freak me out before I even got there which really doesn&#39;t help anyone even if complications do happen and I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that.

yeah I was going to them both before and after Zucker was removed and on the surface they appear to have fixed the problem until you actually end up in a room alone with these people in which case it feels like the appointments are designed to convince you out of having surgery. They way they worded things was really designed in a way that made all these complications/death feel inevitable. I did my research later and I don&#39;t think brassards killed people ever. After those talks I went into surgery convinced I would loose feeling, get a rectovaginal fistula and all it accomplished was turning me into a hypochondriac who called the nurses 3-4 times a day.

Thank you. I&#39;m 61 days away (Jan 15). So very excited.
</p>
<p>
With respect to the pain, did the pain meds not help enough? Is it going to be &#34;that bad&#34; regardless?
</p>
<p>
Did you get perineum electrolysis prior?
</p>
<p>
Did you fly after getting discharged? If so, How did that go?

I had a severe reaction to Dilaudid and oxy the first few days. It made me hallucinate (like I&#39;ve done psychedelics before and this was like acid x 10 I was full on delusional) so they wouldn&#39;t let me use any of the heavier pain meds and switched me to traumadol. Because of this I was in more pain then the majority of people there. Most of the people who could take dilaudid or oxy were not in the same pain I was. Regardless this is a major surgery. the worst was when I blacked out from going up the stairs, when I came to I was so scared I threw up and the force of throwing up was the craziest pain I&#39;ve ever experienced nothing prepared me for that. At 3 weeks I was able to switch from the heavy pain meds to just vaping pot. at 6 weeks I was completely sober and in no pain other then a little discomfort dilating.
</p>
<p>
I had no electrolysis prior and haven&#39;t noticed any hair in or around the surgery site. there is a clear line of where the hair starts and nothing past it. I am too early to do a speculum so if there is any hair deep inside I&#39;m not aware of it.

Im lucky enough that I live a 20 minute uber from the recovery centre because even going over potholes was painful

oh and in regards to pain, as the nerves re-attatch they fire. sometimes that firing causes all the nerves to have a chain reaction. There was one day this happened around my clitoris and there was a solid hour of really crazy pain (my friend had to crawl into bed with me I was a mess) but it was a one time thing and once it was over it was over

no this is my first time using it. My body has strange reactions to medicine though, I had another unrelated surgery years ago and needed 7 times the amount of anesthetic a normal person needs before I passed out the doctors were stumped. I also had a severe allergic reaction to several types of antibiotics while I was in the aslepiade and after reacting to penicillin, cypricol, and clyndamiacin they decided it would be safer not to take any antibiotics. My oxy/Dilaudid reaction was so weird. I thought there were police and doctors coming in and out of my room telling me my insurance had lapsed and I owed the government 20,000 dollars and had to keep asking my roommate if people were in the room and we were alone it was terrifying.

I see. I&#39;m like you were, set to go to Brassard but wary about the horror stories. Aesthetically, how did it turn out? Did you have any experience with (cis) girls before in your life? How would you say it ranks, in terms of cisnormativity?

it exceeded my expectations aesthetically, but its still a little bit swollen (it can take up to 6 months to completely loose the swelling so its very very early for that). I think compared to the cis vaginas I&#39;ve seen in my life its definitely in the normal range but also there is such a huge variance in cis women vaginas that thats not saying all that much. its definitely reaching a point where I could be naked in front of a cis person without it outing me as long as my hair is long enough to cover it.  Im super curious how the appearance will change once the swelling goes away. Other than that, everything is where its supposed to be and I just have two very thin pale scars running along either Side of it (I&#39;ve been really really OCD about massaging the scars with vitamin E cream two or three times a day and it really does seem to be making a difference)

and stay on top of your ice! you can apply it once an hour and its your best weapon in bringing swelling down. (also super key when it comes to making sure you don&#39;t leave the hospital with a catheter still in those things are pure evil). they give you an aftercare pamphlet, follow it as closely as possible its good information I was so careful to do exactly as they said.

Very blunt question - did the procedure result in labia minora? I&#39;m not seeing very developed labia minora in some photos I&#39;ve seen of his work and this is an aesthetic concern for me.

Sure, but you have no post history. There is no way to fact check you, or source check you. Without a history we cannot even determine if you are who and what you say and for all we know you could be a staff member trying to drum up business and repair reputation. I am not saying you are, but creating an account for the sole purpose of leaving a glowing review that contradicts all the others is a pretty good indicator of false flagging the trans community.

There are plenty of people who have had great experiences with Brassard, my ex girlfriend being one of them. I&#39;ve been actively participating in trans subreddits for several years, and there really haven&#39;t been an abnormal number of Brassard patients with bad outcomes or complications. What I
<em>
do
</em>
notice is people spreading the &#34;Brassard is a butcher&#34; line just because they heard it from other folks without even having examples to back it up. He&#39;s not like Rumer, who
<em>
does
</em>
seem to have an abnormally high rate of complications that are posted about online. Her bad reputation is easy to back up with examples.

<p>
Part of the frustration with Brassard is that he&#39;s responsible for nearly every trans woman getting bottom surgery in Canada.  There&#39;s a power imbalance there that needs to be addressed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oh sure, I&#39;d totally agree with that. But there
<em>
are
</em>
more surgeons finally coming into the picture in Canada, which is great news for a lot of reasons. I know that at least some were trained by Bowers, and if they&#39;re anything like my surgeon (who is newer to GRS, but spent a year training with Bowers), patients will be very happy.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The fact that he tells his patients not to have hair removal done before surgery is irresponsible.  The follicle scraping during surgery doesn&#39;t always work for everyone, and Brassard is one of the only North American surgeons left who doesn&#39;t outright require hair removal beforehand.  That&#39;s a problem.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, ultimate I think it should still be left up to the patient, and that not doing it shouldn&#39;t be an automatic disqualifier.
<em>
However
</em>
, patients need to be made very aware that scraping is unlikely to be 100% effective on its own, so they need to understand the risk they&#39;re taking if they choose not to do it. I definitely think people
<em>
should
</em>
do it, and I was super lucky in that Medicaid covered electro for me because it was surgical prep, but I understand that some people can&#39;t. I think in some cases the risk of internal hair is acceptable if someone&#39;s genital dysphoria is bad enough that going ahead with surgery sooner is the better option. But again, that should be up to the patient, and they need to be made aware of the realities in no uncertain terms, instead of it just kinda be glossed over like some surgeons seem to.

Unfortunately it seems they only do MTF bottom surgery, though. I think trans men in Canada are all still stuck with Brassard, which kinda sucks. It&#39;s scary because I can&#39;t find ANYTHING about his phallo online.

Oh yeah, sorry. I don&#39;t know anything about the state of FTM bottom surgeries in Canada, but I know even in the US the options are a lot more limited than for vaginoplasty. Both surgeons at the hospital where I had vaginoplasty are also training in phallo (or metoidioplasty, I forget), but unfortunately that doesn&#39;t help you. But since Bowers is helping train them in phallo here, maybe she&#39;ll help train some of the newer surgeons in Canada too? One can hope, at least.

No problem at all! I wish getting bottom surgery in general was a lot easier for everyone, because even under the best circumstances now it can still be a huge undertaking to pursue.

I was one of the girls he operated on (i.e. 2005) who ended up having significant hair growth inside the vagina. I went ahead with his recommendation pre-op and did not do electrolysis. I regret it but nothing I can do. Everything else, I&#39;m mostly happy with except maybe the depth of the vagina...vulva looks pretty awesome and close to the real thing. Works great, amazing orgasms, I lubricate and ejaculate plenty (due to adding T), also clit is very orgasmic and sensitive. Pee fine, all good. I have no regrets about going to him. I think he&#39;s one of the best. Just do electro before SRS. ;)

I guess I&#39;m relatively new I only ever checked this place a month before my surgery because I didn&#39;t know any trans people prior (probably the biggest drawback of living stealthy) and had absolutely no idea what to expect. a lot of what I came across really terrified me.

also I just thought of this but wouldn&#39;t openly trashtalking CAMHs screening process as a nurse or staff involved make me liable for all sorts of things? what about my comment recommending pot as a painkiller as an alternative to traumadol (they personally told me they can&#39;t recommend smoking pot because no clear medical studies have been done since its been legalized)
