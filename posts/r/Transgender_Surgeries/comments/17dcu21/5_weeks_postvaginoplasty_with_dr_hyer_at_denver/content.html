I had full-depth penile-inversion vaginoplasty with Dr. Hyer at Denver Health 5 weeks ago. I&#39;m super happy with the process and my results! The whole team at Denver Health has been very supportive from the start.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had very little pain since the procedure, and I was able to manage it with over the counter Ibuprofen and Tylenol. Honestly, the most painful part of the whole thing was the sinus headache that I got in the hospital ðŸ˜†. Dilating has been pretty smooth and painless, with the exception of a few days in which I went up to the next size (but even that has been manageable). I have a sedentary work from home job, so I went back to work half-time starting at three weeks post-op. My main barrier is just time for dilation, so going back early lets me stay at half-time until I&#39;m fully recovered (12 weeks) and only have to dilate twice a day.
</p>
<p>
Although I&#39;m only 5 weeks post-op, I&#39;m very happy with the appearance and functionality of my vulva. Still healing, but very much healthy-looking and functional. I had my first orgasm post-surgery yesterday, from penetration alone as I still haven&#39;t started exploring my clit.
</p>
<p>
All in all, I&#39;m very, very happy with the procedure and would highly recommend Dr. Hyer and her team to anyone in the Denver area. It was much easier than I expected. My wife took four weeks off work to help me during recovery, but I was doing so well that she ended up being bored most of that time. It was a nice time of bonding for us!
</p>
<p>
Edit 1/5/2024: I&#39;m fully recovered and have been for almost a month! There&#39;s still lots of healing to do, but it&#39;s a big relief to not have to do the sitz baths and midday dilations anymore. The last half of the recovery period was pretty easy. I developed some granulation tissue that made dilating uncomfortable, but the NP was able to treat that pretty well at my appointments. I&#39;ve also had good results using topical antibiotic ointment to accelerate healing around the vaginal opening.
</p>
<p>
The only (minorly) disappointing development has been that my clitoris healed over almost entirely. I did everything they recommended to prevent this, but it happened anyway. I say it&#39;s only minorly disappointing because there&#39;s no loss of function; I&#39;m still able to orgasm and feel pleasure very easily. It&#39;s actually much, much more sensitive than I was before surgery, so I&#39;m kind of glad that it isn&#39;t more exposed as that sounds overwhelming. Even now a vibrator can be a bit much if I use it directly.
</p>
<p>
Edit 6/8/2024: Well, it&#39;s now almost 9 months since surgery. Dilation has gotten super easy, and I&#39;ve healed very well, hardly any scarring. Things have still change in appearance since my last update - it&#39;s now clear that I actually do have labia minora! They&#39;re little, but obvious now that things have settled.
</p>
<p>
The big exciting update is that I self-lubricate! I don&#39;t know how Dr. Hyer made that happen with PIV, but it&#39;s consistent over the last five months or so and enough to do penetration if I&#39;m turned on, so hooray for me!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to answer any questions!

How long from consult was surgery scheduled?  Was there anything you felt unprepared for? Was the 12 weeks their recommendation for time off/full recovery?

I had my consult in May and surgery was in September. I was pretty well-prepared for everything except how annoying the catheter was going to be. 12 weeks is their time frame for &#34;fully recovered&#34; and able to do things like exercise again. I think they recommend taking 6 weeks off from work, depending on what you do.

Great! They say my healing is fantastic. I had some minor granulation tissue which they treated at my 6 week post op. Those spots are improving now. Other than those areas, my vulva looks and feels really nicely healed. It&#39;s looking like I won&#39;t have much if any scarring.

Thank you! For reference, I also went to Dr Hyer and I am not happy with my results, so I was wondering if we could swap photos. But totally get it if youâ€™re not ready.
