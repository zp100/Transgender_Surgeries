<p>
I&#39;m now almost 3 weeks post-op from my surgery and I&#39;m very satisfied with the results. I would recommend Dr. Rolfes to anyone considering FFS. I think he&#39;s a very kind, down to earth person and he produces exceptional results. I&#39;ve seen comments about his tendency to be conservative, but that wasn&#39;t my experience. I gave him examples of outcomes I wanted and he was able to be aggressive where needed.
</p>
<p>
I have a longer face and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be unclockable, but I already feel extremely confident, more feminine and more beautiful. Since the 2 week mark, I&#39;ve felt very comfortable being out in public without makeup as well as on camera for work. I&#39;ve gotten a lot of positive comments from friends, family &amp; coworkers, and I can&#39;t wait to see where things are at in a couple months.

<p>
Here&#39;s what I had done with my perspective on the results:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Hairline Advancement: My receded temples were closed but Dr Rolfes felt there wasn&#39;t enough give to my scalp to get the advancement he initially thought possible. My hairline was my biggest source of dysphoria and I was disappointed to have it only partially resolved with the procedure. I&#39;ll probably look to hair transplants to fully address my hairline.
</li>
<li>
Forehead, Brow &amp; Orbital Contouring: He did an amazing job and it was everything I had hoped for.
</li>
<li>
Rhinoplasty: Again, amazing job. The result was exactly what I asked for.
</li>
<li>
Cheek Augmentation with Malar Implants &amp; Fat Graft: He was able to fill the dark bags under my eyes and give me a round, full midface. My cheeks/cheekbones are something I&#39;ve consistently gotten compliments on since my procedure.
</li>
<li>
Lip Filler with Fat Graft: I&#39;m neutral on this one. I think the lips look great at rest, but they look a little unnatural when I&#39;m smiling.
</li>
<li>
Jaw Contouring &amp; Neck Liposuction: Overall, I think my jaw/chin look fabulous. I was hoping to reduce my chin height a little bit more, but it&#39;s close enough that I wouldn&#39;t touch it. I&#39;m also very glad that he was able to get rid of the under chin sag that&#39;s developed over the last couple of years.
</li>
<li>
Trachea Shave: He softened what little protrusion I had from my thyroid cartilidge, but I actually think my trachea looks a bit more prominent now because of the lipo under my chin. Not something I&#39;m going to dwell on, but maybe something for others to consider when planning their surgery.
</li>
</ul>

<strong>
Consultation &amp; Scheduling
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 37 and a little over 1.5 years on HRT. Prior to surgery I felt like I passed well enough to be comfortable in my day to day life when I was wearing makeup. The the only feature I felt extremely dysphoric about was my hairline which was quite receded at the temples. My goal with FFS was really to feel comfortable without makeup and with my hair back.
</p>
<p>
My consultation with Dr. Rolfes was great. He came off as a very straightforward, honest surgeon who was there to understand my goals and develop a plan with me. He was candid about what he thought was the best approach and why, but ultimately left the decisions to me. I left feeling very confident that I wanted to move forward with him. He is also local and works with my insurance (BCBS) so it was kind of a no-brainer to go forward with scheduling a surgery date. There were a few stumbles from BCBS on the prior authorization for the surgery but the Omni Cosmetic staff were great at handling those while keeping me informed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day of Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The day of surgery I was excited that the day had finally come and a little anxious, but I had never had surgery so I had no idea what I was in for. I got changed, the nurse gave me some meds and inserted my IV. Next, the nurse anesthetist came in and gave me the rundown on general anesthesia. Then Dr. Rolfes came in to go over the plans with me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen a number of folks mention his tendency to be conservative so I provided him a couple of photos of what I wanted my results to look like. Specifically, we discussed the results of
<a href="/u/drain64">/u/drain64
</a>
since we have similar profiles and he provided her with amazing results. He then mentioned they would harvest fat for my cheek augmentation but wouldn&#39;t use it all, and asked if I&#39;d like it used to fill my lips. I said &#34;yeah, if you think it&#39;d look good&#34; and he added it to the plan. It wasn&#39;t a super impactful decision but, in retrospect, I didn&#39;t like making a decision without time to really think about it.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after Dr. Rolfes left, the nurse returned and brought me to the OR. We were chatting about how I used to work near by while I laid down on the table, the nurse anesthetist said she was giving me something that might make me feel weird... and then I woke up in a recovery room 8 hours later.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/X2GGkWh.jpg">Days 1-3
</a>
</p>
<p>
The first night was miserable.  I got a scratched cornea at some point so I couldn&#39;t open my eyes. I couldn&#39;t breath through my nose so I couldn&#39;t sleep either. I basically spent 12 hours nodding off and waking up every couple of minutes.
</p>
<p>
I returned to the clinic the next day and my bandages came off. I&#39;ve seen a lot of people say they loved their results immediately. I didn&#39;t... I looked crazy. I could see the massive difference in my eyes and nose, but everything else just looked like a mess to me. Thankfully I was stoned enough on percocet to not really stress about it. The Dr took a look to make sure everything looked good, the nurse slapped the jaw bra on my head, and off I went.
</p>
<p>
Day 2 was when my swelling peaked. It was as miserable as day 1. My lips, hair, cheeks were all covered in Aquaphor. Still couldn&#39;t breath, and eating/drinking was a real challenge. I wasn&#39;t really in pain (maybe 3/10) other than a dull throb in my jaw. Finally, on day 3, my nose started opening and I was able to get real sleep. I slept for probably 12 hours that night.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/9FgfE3u.jpg">Days 4-6
</a>
</p>
<p>
By day 4 my swelling had gone down considerably. I was able to eat more and rehydrate. I decided to take a shower, untangle my hair and rinse some of the Aquaphor out of it. The next couple days I felt at about 90% energy. I had stopped taking the percocet and started just doing 500mg Tylenol each AM/PM. Also, I weighed myself before my shower and found I had lost 12 pounds over the course of the surgery and recovery!
</p>
<p>
On day 6 I returned to the clinic to have my staples and stitches taken out. I was amazed to see that the incisions on the side of my head were completely closed as was the stretch along the middle of my forehead. The only spots that hadn&#39;t closed were at the corners of my hairline. Still was not in love with how I looked.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/8drwq8I.jpg">Days 7-13
</a>
</p>
<p>
I read a lot of FFS stories before my own operation. The physical part of recovery and results are talked about a lot. I felt like I was physically back by day 7. I had stopped using any sort of pain relief at that point. Now, I was having a hard time mentally/emotionally. My face looked very different, I didn&#39;t like how I looked, it was impossible to produce my feminine voice, my hormones were bottomed out, etc., and I felt deeply depressed. I cried... a lot... over everything!
</p>
<p>
It wasn&#39;t until I shared my results with a couple friends and got very positive feedback that my mood started to recover. The combination of having energy, eating solid food, doing my E injection, and starting to normalize my face also helped a lot. By day 13 I was feeling pretty positive about my results.
</p>
<p>
Physically, I&#39;m still healing in very minor ways. The biggest annoyance at this point is the stitches in my mouth which are kind of jabby and uncomfortable. My hairline incision is all closed up and I&#39;ve started on the scar cream. The numbness has started to resolve over my right eyebrow, but the left side of my forehead, scalp, and lower left lip/chin are all still numb. My cheeks and jaw have no pain/discomfort at all.

Oh don’t worry, they didn’t share any unflattering pics. I was blown away by a post of yours so I saved it and we discussed that in pre op.
</p>
<p>
So glad you shared your experience though because I think it was a huge difference maker in my results!

Thank you so much for this post! Might I ask how long you waited between initial consult and surgery?

Basically 6 months. I consulted in October and had surgery scheduled for the end of April. Then my surgery date moved up 2 weeks because another client didn’t pass their pre op physical.
