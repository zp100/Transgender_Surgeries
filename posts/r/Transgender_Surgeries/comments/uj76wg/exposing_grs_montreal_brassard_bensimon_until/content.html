Exposing GRS Montreal( Brassard/ Bensimon) until investigation is publicly announce. Pictures, recording, emails from lawyers. Lies to to the boards of doctors. Lobbying preventing more coverages. Minions here say surgeries are 2-4 hours. Lies from minions. Justice for Canadian girls starts now.

What? My surgery results were excellent and everyone I know who&#39;s gone to GRS Montreal has a pretty good experiences. There are some issues but still much better than a lot of other places. After doing surgeries for 20 years, you get faster and more adept. This screenshot tells nothing, pretty normal. Penile inversion doesn&#39;t take that long, mine was 2 and a half hours.

Looking at your history, it just seems you are trying to play victim with all your surgeries (FFS and GRS), poor results happen and it&#39;s just the risk of surgery. It&#39;s a fallacy to think the 2 hour surgery was the problem when so many other girls get 2 hour surgery&#39;s at GRS Montreal and turn out amazing. It&#39;s bad luck and there&#39;s much not much to do but reflect, get revisions and spread your story and move on.

Wow. Really I try to play victim when they pushed me to the hospital for suicide attempt. When girl actually committed suicide? When the coverage in Canada hasn‚Äôt changed I years while in other countries deemed less open to lgbtq people offers more?
</p>
<p>
When grs Montreal takes parts of you using false document and without a clear knowledges so that they can promote themselves.
</p>
<p>
I play victims because a girl who recently has surgery like you claimed it‚Äôs amazing. When am increase number of girls are starting to have issues later on due to a garbage surgery?
</p>
<p>
The reality is that I am not a victim but someone who hates that surgeons has put in place a system and use their influence. To keep control over all surgery for us.
</p>
<p>
That 100‚Äôs of code of conduct complaints are not being addressed and dismissed without a proper investigation.
</p>
<p>
That bunch of girls who claim they are happy about it on forums. When discussing with them are looking into revision elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
That CMC is charging enormous price to provinces for minor corrections who should no even happen if the surgeries weee not rushed. And that the names of those corrections are clear on documents but on provincial invoices are generic so that reporting cannot trace or see  how it is ridiculous to subit a 5k invoice to remove a skin tag? Which can be done 300$ elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
How many millions have they pocketed in abusing funding that never went to trans girl?
</p>
<p>
That contractually for transparency cmc and grs Montreal are not authorized to approved surgeries but that for some reason it happens all the time? And always seem to happen when someone complain after their SRS. Kinda I‚Äôll make sure you get free boobs. If you shut up. Making the reality of their garbage surgeries less obvious because of all the free things they give that they actually are not authorized.
</p>
<p>
That woman‚Äôs clinic in Toronto says they get bunch of girls in Montreal due to the crappy technique that kills clitoris Montreal does.
</p>
<p>
That the only technique available to girls in canada is still a cheap penile inversion. Because offering other options would take more time.
</p>
<p>
So girl say what you say.
</p>
<p>
I will bring facts and people be the  judge.  As I would have liked that someone do for me.
</p>
<p>
And claiming that they do bunch of surgeries does not clear their constant malpractice. As I don‚Äôt know any other surgeon who still has the right to work that has such a poor ratio of satisfaction vs unsatisfactory.
</p>
<p>
So I‚Äôve been thru a lot with them. I‚Äôve dealt with their lawyers, I‚Äôve talk to super groups, to universities, to the director in charge of the investigation team of le coll√®ge des m√©decins.  To 100‚Äôs of girls.
</p>
<p>
So to say that I just want to complain because I want to be a victim well if you want I can‚Äôt give you an email from their lawyer telling me they are not sharing my medical info because they know I‚Äôll post online and would rather want me to discuss with them and maybe get something. I‚Äôve been ask what I wanted to shut up.
</p>
<p>
So no I got my life destroyed by them and I‚Äôm a pretty resilient person so I‚Äôm doing it because ive I suffered and witnessed so much dishonesty from them that I cannot conceive how someone more fragile would survive. And guess what. Now I know  some that didn‚Äôt.
</p>
<p>
So I did my  diligence and I think I‚Äôve done enough research and have enough proof that I am entitled to share my findings so that people know what type of place it is.
</p>
<p>
And you are entitled to claim it‚Äôs an amazing place because your 4-5 friends that had surgery are somewhat satisfied even tho it‚Äôs not perfect.

It&#39;s definitely not perfect but no surgery place is perfect. I&#39;m sorry that surgery has pushed you to try to attempt your life. That&#39;s fucked up and I hope that your life and your view of your pussy gets better with reflection and corrections. Just looking at your precious posts I think your vagina is pretty nice. Vaginas aren&#39;t pretty and having the expectation that your going to have the pretty pussy is unfounded. I learned this the hard way and also had post-surgery depression but it was only through reflection that I realise that it&#39;s actually super functional and super nice as far as vaginas good.
</p>
<p>
Surgery expensive, especially for specialist transgender care, I&#39;m not surprised that the privitized protions go well above market average for cisgender corrections but that is the nature of not having any competition.
</p>
<p>
In regards to the Toronto surgery, let&#39;s say Brassard does 3 surgeries, 7 if you include all the other surgeons a day. Over 15 years to be conservative, assuming 1% of individuals had nonessential complications(preferential to be resolved) and 0.01% had complication which had to resolved to be functional (aesthetically or performance wise) that means 38k individuals had surgery. 3.8k had nonessential complications and 380 had mandatory revisions. Those surgeries will obviously stack up on the Toronto surgery centre as those 380 individuals have no trust for GRS Montreal so it&#39;s no surprise that there&#39;s an influx. Its just the nature of the beast.
</p>
<p>
GRS Montreal is in no way perfect but 1 experience doesn&#39;t mean a majority of surgeries won&#39;t be proficient. I have had some complications but when getting this surgery I&#39;ve accepted it as the way it is and treat it accordingly. The hundreds of complaints are expected from the loud minority, but under the hood, tens of thousands of girls are kicking ass out there with a Montreal made vagina.

No actually  Pm me cuz I would like for you to explain to the family and friends of people that took their lives following their experiences. And not just based on results but On how they tried to get revisions and they were denied by Brassard &amp; Co because let‚Äôs be honest if he give revision to everyone that actually needs one. It would not really look good. Not sure if you understand but if 20% of patient needs revision. And someone audit the data. It‚Äôs pretty obvious the technique used  in The first place is not working. And he doesn‚Äôt want that because he wants to do them fast.
</p>
<p>
So you tell the family that it‚Äôs not that bad because in the end the ratio is not that bad. That their traumatized experience leading to suicide is the price to pay  because brassards does so many.
</p>
<p>
Do you know that if someone takes their own life and that you can prove that an individual played a part directly or indirectly that lead to the decision to move forward with it. That it‚Äôs can be considered and offence under the criminal code?
</p>
<p>
Or maybe you don‚Äôt want to tell their family that and would prefer to  tell them what you pretty much told me. That even though they were followed by psys prior to surgery and were approved and deemed ready. That they should have also considered being botched and prevented from getting proper care and now be thinking their life is over since it looked like they will never be able to get help.
</p>
<p>
Maybe that is the solution. Cuz it‚Äôs seem that Brassard can destroy people life‚Äôs regularly as long as he is under a threshold without any consequence?
</p>
<p>
I guess that the girls who were used and rapes by Epstein don‚Äôt have have to complaint. Because he was so good for others. Right? I mean that‚Äôs what your telling me.
</p>
<p>
So girl PM me and I will our you im contact with them. And we will see how your arguments stands in front of them.
</p>
<p>
I might end up taking my life because of them. And what they did to me. But until then you can be damn sure that I‚Äôll do everything I can to make sure that girls know who they are dealing with. And that because of that. They should be able to choose their surgeon and not be forced to go to someone who does them sometimes in ridiculous time and that if it happens to them to be ready be destroy mentally because they will do everything he can and prevent you from getting care that would actually show that maybe he should stop those. 1:30 minutes surgeries.
</p>
<p>
So maybe follow me and you will learn my whole experience. And you tell me once you know everything. How they acted. How they actually are.  And then multiply that so you get the number of time it happened.
</p>
<p>
And then tell me that they have the right to brag about actually caring about us? Because between you  and me. Calculate how much Brassard makes per year? And I can assure there is many surgeons  that would also smile in you it face knowing they will have millions. The difference is that they won‚Äôt have a track record of destroying peoples life and having strategic influence needing to protect them constantly.
