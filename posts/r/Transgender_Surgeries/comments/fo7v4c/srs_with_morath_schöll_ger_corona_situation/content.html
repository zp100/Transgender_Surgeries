Since some of you may want to have this information: all surgeries until April 19th are cancelled/ postponed. The situation will be re-evaluated after this timeperiod. So surgeries after this date aren’t necessarily safe, but atleast there is hope things will have calmed down by then.
</p>
<p>
I called because I have a date on the 13th of May for the big snip. Wish me luck...

Figured as much. Not that I&#39;m far enough with the whole therapy Waldorf dance with getting all the paperwork to be able to have an appointment...
</p>
<p>
Btw once you&#39;re through the whole process, could you post at least your experiences here (or text them to me)? I want to have mine with either Morath or Schaff and I&#39;m unsure whether Morath is good enough yet (and there&#39;s rumours Schaff is too old to operate despite still doing so, but that might just be intentionally bad press from an unsatisfied person I know). My main point is to have his extended method, since it&#39;s said to be superior and there&#39;s no compromises in a one-time chance.
</p>
<p>
Ohh and did you have it partially covered by insurance? How much do you have to pay yourself these days?

Sure, if the surgery happens I would gladly give you a review :) As far as I know she is pretty skilled at this point and has enough experience under her belt.
</p>
<p>
It’s covered by my insurance except for the 3000€ “cosmetic fee”.

I&#39;d really appreciate that because you basically get no recent info, especially not on the competence of newly reassembled teams. And since the rumour is that Schaff is dropping the extra 3k in his new workplace, I figure a lot of people would flock to him and clog his waiting list even more. I&#39;m already past breaking point so I&#39;m planning ahead as much as I can, and waiting longer is not an option, but neither is a drop in quality.
</p>
<p>
A recent report on the new Morath situation would probably help a lot of transwomen living in Germany.

I had surgery with Dr Schaff June last year when he was still working with Morath and I&#39;m very happy with the results. As far as I&#39;m aware, both Surgeons are still producing good results, but I can&#39;t comment whether there is any significant change since Schaff left and opened his own office.
</p>
<p>
My feeling is he is still very capable, but the more years that pass from now, the more of a risk there will be. In the past Schaff and Morath always did the surgeries together with one of them taking the lead. I have no idea if them no longer performing surgery together changes anything from a results point of view.
</p>
<p>
With regards to Dr Schöll, I haven&#39;t seen any results where he was the lead surgeon, but I have spoken with him on several occasions and he came across as very competent and knowledgeable.

Went for a consult with Schaff last month - he has indeed dropped any extra payment, so it is now entirely covered by insurance. As far as I understood he didn&#39;t carry over any patients from the old practice, so as someone who had all of my papers in order (as in indikationen und die kostenübernahme) he literally said &#39;I could have you on the table tomorrow&#39;. Corona will undoubtedly fuck with the waiting times, particularly if people aren&#39;t able to get surgery for the next six months/remainder of the year, but as of yet the wait list doesn&#39;t thus seem to be very big at all. Can&#39;t speak to age, but just based off of the consultation I had a much better impression, including two key facets that were entirely ignored by my consultation with Morath (/her assistant, in reality) last year which could&#39;ve resulted in a bad result.
</p>
<p>
As for Schöll, my understanding is that he has almost no experience as the primary surgeon, so do exercise proper caution.

Waiiiiit whaaaaat... You&#39;re kidding, right? Do you maybe have an up to date number, so I can ask him about cost and waiting lists? And also... Shit. I was already collecting donations. If that&#39;s all true, then oh boy... (I might discuss with my handful of donators if I can just use the money for the consultation fee and supplies. The upside to not yet having a lot of donators)
</p>
<p>
Did you ask for any recent results in pictures? Because if he&#39;s really OK on no extra payment and waiting time, there remains the question of viability. Maybe I&#39;d just ask him upfront and tell him about the badmouthing.

No consultation fee either ;)
</p>
<p>
Well, that&#39;s not entirely true. No consultation fee in München, but there is in Berlin, as that is a private clinic (?). His new website, which opened on like the 4th of January or so? is here:
<a href="https://drschaff.de/" rel="nofollow">https://drschaff.de/
</a>
</p>
<p>
and his page on the München clinic site is here:
<a href="https://www.doctolib.de/plastische-und-asthetische-chirurgie/muenchen/juergen-schaff" rel="nofollow">https://www.doctolib.de/plastische-und-asthetische-chirurgie/muenchen/juergen-schaff
</a>
, with phone number and ability to book consultations online. Unfortunately people&#39;ve started to get wind of him moving, where he&#39;s moved to, and the lack of the 3000€ fee, so consultations have booked up quickly. And the pandemic and all. Worth phoning them up to see what&#39;s what.
</p>
<p>
It also sounds like you&#39;re not aware of the &#39;transexuelle und angehörige nach F64.0&#39; (I know..) site, which is entirely in German in case that is a problem? but is the best place I&#39;ve found for German surgeon result photos. You have to make some sort of post to get access, but I&#39;m currently following the developments of at least one recent Schaff result. Also, fair warning, the environment there (as the name suggests) is not the very best, with heavy criticism of any non-Thai surgeon, but it is nevertheless a very useful resource
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t think I got any recent pictures in the consultation, just the standard ones from his powerpoint. If you haven&#39;t read the three academic articles he&#39;s published which seem to be about his results, do give a shout, as those&#39;re worth a read and have some results in too, as well as some impressive stats

How bad is the botched Schaff one? Is it just the person
<em>
thinking
</em>
it&#39;s bad or has it actually gone bad? (Btw if you&#39;ve got telegram, you can @ me @lillywho if you&#39;d like)

Oh bloody heck, that site seems a bit... Well, it&#39;s got something up its arse... Beyond the usual German degree.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Die Selbstauffassung und Ausrichtung von &#34;Transsexuelle &gt; und Angehörige&#34; entspricht der Definition von Transsexualismus im ICD10 mit Betroffenheitsgrad tendenziell „soweit wie möglich“ und wir identifizieren uns mit dem Zweigeschlechtermodell.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ICD 10... That&#39;s horribly outdated and they identify with
<em>
this being called a mental illness
</em>
? Wow. Wtf. And leave the poor nonbinaries alone. Seriously...
</p>
<p>
Edit: OK I&#39;ve just read the rest of the paragraph. They&#39;re horrible. I&#39;m the exact opposite of what they apparently, implicitly praise as normal. I&#39;m not &#34;transsexuell&#34;. I&#39;m a real girl who&#39;s had a bit of bad luck body-wise. If you look at my personality, I&#39;m indistinguishable from so-called cis-people. They disgust me.

Yeahhh, a little morbidly comical, huh. As said, just a place to browse for surgical results.. ;x
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to speak ill of someone&#39;s result, but they have expressed dissatisfaction with how things have been dealt with by the hospital post-op so far, with Schaff seeming difficult to get ahold of, and also corona-related troubles meaning no disinfectant and stuff.

Yes! After 10 days I think I can give an fairly accurate review! So check in was a Day Pre- OP and a bit of a waiting game. I was dumped in the waiting area for like 3 hours and they checked my vitals/ asked me to fill out forms and then have the pre-op consultations. What followed was bowel prep, ususal poop fest for most of the day / evening. Nurses were already very accommodating and helped me through any discomfort - as I got a bit nauseous.
</p>
<p>
Following day - Wednesday 8.7  My roomie got pushed in first. I had to wait for her to finish and then it was my turn. 11o clock approached and I was given a sedative to relax my nerves. I was moved to a different “bed” given my IV and monitored.  Soon after I was put to sleep. It took like 3 seconds and I was gone. Woke up in the dedicated “awakening room” and pumped full of opiates to feel less discomfort.
</p>
<p>
I got pushed back to my room and the nurses closely monitored my surgical site and checked in with my condition.  I remember my girlfriend being happy to see me and not much besides that.
</p>
<p>
Part II coming soon!
