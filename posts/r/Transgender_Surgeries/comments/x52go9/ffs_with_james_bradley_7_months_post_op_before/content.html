Hello love!
</p>
<p>
First, let me start off by saying your results came out beautifully! I have Amida Care and I‚Äôve been doing my research on all the doctors that are covered by my insurance &amp; it‚Äôs been tough because I haven‚Äôt been able to see their work (when it comes to FFS) at all really. Dr. James Bradley does accept my insurance &amp; I‚Äôve heard great things about him &amp; you are a prime example of that!
</p>
<p>
If I may, I wanted to ask how your experience was with him?
</p>
<p>
Was there a long wait to for a consult &amp; how long did it take for you to get your surgery?
</p>
<p>
Do you feel like he executed the exact look your were going for?
</p>
<p>
Is there any area of your surgery that you would recommend he not work on or do you think he‚Äôs good for full FFS? (Ex. Forehead, jaw, nose)
</p>
<p>
Again, your FFS came out more than satisfactory to me &amp; now look forward to getting work done with him. Look forward to hearing back! You look a gorgeous girl!
</p>

Would you recommend them both?? Where are they located ??

So with this round of FFS I really wanted to get a rhinoplasty,  I‚Äôve seen some of Dr Bradley‚Äôs nose work and was honestly impressed , so I decided to go with him over bella solely because I haven‚Äôt seen her work on noses .
</p>
<p>
I would definitely recommend both ! I feel like james Bradley is a bit more aggressive when it comes to facial work which I personally like we did ALOT but I still look natural
</p>
<p>
Bella Avanessian is amazing , I feel like she does much more subtle work .
</p>
<p>
With james Bradley I had my forehead shaved again , jaw shaved , subtle eyebrow lift , rhinoplasty , genioplasty
</p>
<p>
They‚Äôre both located in NYC

Looks amazing. You said you had your forehead shave ahead; did he go through the same coronal incision from the first surgery? Was it a type 1, 2 or 3?

I am happy that ur result came out good and this post was one of the reasons i decided to have facial fem with dr Bradley, so here is my experience. i am not happy at all, my jaw is uneven heights on the left side and right side. my left jaw has a dent, my jaw has an overall octagon like appearance. I told him to keep my mandibular angles prominent but narrow my chin. I have the opposite, my angles are gone and my chin is robust. As for my nose, yes my nose was really big before surgery so my nose is somewhat an improvement overall, but it is not well done. My tip is over done and my left side has a scooped out like appearance and my septum is deviated I&#39;m having breathing problems. My forehead i can not complain, there&#39;s nothing particularly wrong, its just not very dramatic of a difference. My brows were not raised enough, i still have excess skin in my brow/upper lid area so its not like he didn&#39;t have enough elasticity to pull brow higher. My hairline is also still sguare but i understand that they can only do so much each round, so I&#39;m not faulting the surgeon for that one. im just really confused tho, because i asked for a very subtle difference in the mandible area and a very dramatic difference in the brow region, but i have the complete opposite of what i asked for on top of the fact that the work is not well done.
</p>
<p>
Im also not sure how much of my ffs was actually preformed by Bradley, i know Bradley was present for my surgery as i saw him before the surgery and in the O.R. as i was being sedated. but i also saw other surgeons besides the anesthesiologist and nurses. i didn&#39;t think anything of it as as it was only a couple of seconds before i went under. on my third day recovering i was going to have my first post op with the surgeon dr Bradley but he never showed up, instead two young drs showed up who were at most in there mid 20s doing there practical&#39;s or fellowship (don&#39;t remember exactly) came to see me, i was really confused and as i didnt know who they were and why the nurses kept on calling them my drs when in did not consent to them performing or being present during my procedure. aslo all my prescriptions were ordered by a plastic surgeon that was not dr Bradley which also made me really confused and gave me unnecessary anxiety as noting was explained to me at my most scary i couldn&#39;t even see my eyes were swollen shut. the whole thing was a mess also my post op scheduling by Brianna was a mess too. they gave me appt in a different location in the wrong office i had to cancel and reschedule they also cancelled my rescheduled appointment only a couple hours before the appt time. i had to take of my own nose splint as it was coming off on its on and smelling sweaty as they couldn&#39;t schedule me in to see the dr Sam/Sabrina did wind up calling me later that night and calmed me down as i already new i was not happy with how the tip of my nose turn out or the lack of my mandibular angles so she was nice at least. but yea whole thing was a nightmare.
