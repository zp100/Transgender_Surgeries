I would like to ask a couple of questions since I had a zero depth done there and a horrid experience.
</p>
<p>
Did their staff respond to any of your troubles after the surgery? If they did how did that go?

Hello, I first want to say I am so sorry for your negative experience, nobody deserves to deal with something like that when it comes to such a beautiful and delicate journey. So far the staff have been very kind and very responsive. We have been communicating via text, and they usually respond to concerns within 20-45 minutes or so. Longest Iâ€™ve seen was around an hour. I am currently pretty low depth in my initial results which is a little scary to me. But I also didnâ€™t have a large amount of material to work with prior if you know what I mean, so Iâ€™m not sure if that was even avoidable. Although they have ensured me that with dilation they are hopeful I can get to my desired depth.

Am glad that you are having a better experience overall, I was given minimal to zero depth due to having hirschsprung which is probably what made the recovery process difficult. When you have messy lower intestines, being wrapped up and unable to use the restroom can be excruciating.

My friend at the time was helping me address the aftercare and while some of the staff were nice, the surgeon and male receptionist were cruel to my help. She was nervous and the male staff were often upfront about how much of a failure they thought she was, even to her face :/

I too had the most incredible experience with Restore Medical and Dr Whitehead and Dr Ramirez. I underwent bottom a year ago and BA this year, very happy.
