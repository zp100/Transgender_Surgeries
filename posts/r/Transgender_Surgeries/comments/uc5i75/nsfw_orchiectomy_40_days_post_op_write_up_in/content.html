See this thread for my orchi consultation experience
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/rcm4hw/i_just_had_my_orchiectomy_consult_its_finally/">https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/rcm4hw/i_just_had_my_orchiectomy_consult_its_finally/
</a>
</p>
<p>
My orchiectomy was truly an exceptional experience and one of the best decisions I have made. I had no idea how much more I would appreciate the new configuration and a majority of my genital dysphoria is now gone. Dr Lucioni was truly a professional and had a remarkable bedside manner. The incision was made along the raphe as to keep the material in good shape for future bottom surgery if I choose to.
</p>
<p>
The day of the surgery I was in really good spirits. I showered and assessed my testicles one last time. I sort of said my goodbyes in a way and just took an inventory of where I was. My son&#39;s mother saw me off and me and my girlfriend drove down to the surgical center where I would get the procedure. She wished me luck and into the pre op lobby I went.
</p>
<p>
Before long I was called back and asked to strip down and get into a surgical gown. Everyone in the surgical center was absolutely wonderful. I was properly gendered and I felt respected the whole time. We confirmed some paperwork, and I signed some more stuff for the surgery. They gave me a mild pain pill / chill pill and my surgery was about to start.
</p>
<p>
The doctor came in right before the surgery and we spoke and confirmed a few things. He was absolutely great and I would recommend him to anyone in the Seattle area. He left to finish getting the surgical team ready and a few minutes later they carted me back into the operating room.
</p>
<p>
They moved me onto the bed and introduced themselves. The entire team was incredibly respectful and I felt really good about everything. I did not have any additional anxiety outside of normal preoperative jitters, I have been under anesthesia several times before and this experience was just like the others. The anesthesiologist came over and he administered the anesthesia. I was out in a matter of seconds.
</p>
<p>
Upon waking up I felt no pain and it was actually one of the better experiences I have had on the other end of a surgery. The previous two times it took me a good while to come around, this time I felt much more with the program and much sooner. Pretty immediately I felt a difference downstairs, just the absence of them was wonderful. They had me pee before my girlfriend came and let me get dressed. Everything down there was really tightly packed with athletic support and a bunch of pads. I was told to maintain that for 2 weeks and ice and pain pills as needed.
</p>
<p>
Upon moving around a bit and getting in the car I realized the pain was truly minimal. It felt like I strained my groin, not like I had major surgery. I followed instructions and iced regularly. I did not need any narcotic medication, Ice, tylenol, thc, and ibuprofen were plenty to keep the pain manageable. On the third day I got to the size in the post surgical picture and the size I would stay for a few weeks. It was not trivial swelling, but it was still much smaller than the previous arrangement. I was quite able to do minimal walking around the house. I was having to catch myself from wanting to do more than was advised, I was really feeling pretty good.
</p>
<p>
The following weeks were fairly smooth sailing. The spermatic cords were still fairly swollen but as time progressed they got smaller and have since all but retracted to the canals. If they don&#39;t retract anymore I would actually be fine but I suspect they will tuck away when it&#39;s all said and done.
</p>
<p>
Once the month was done and healing was more or less finished me and my girlfriend finally got to be intimate again. I can say this was the most surprising experience. With less dysphoria I am now much more in the moment and it&#39;s a far superior experience. Everything still works with the help of a blue pill and I truly have no complaints on that front. This was an unexpected but welcome change.
</p>
<p>
At my post surgical appointment my doctor was quite pleased. Everything seems to have healed wonderfully. I have been given a clean bill of health. I thanked him for his wonderful care and told him how much it meant to me. He and his team were truly wonderful, if you are in the Seattle area I would highly recommend him.
</p>
<p>
Where I find myself now is in a really good place. I am very pleased with the result and lack of complications. The scar healed nicely and my dysphoria is far better. I can finally wear the jeans I want and I am truly loving every minute of it. I would be lying if I said I thought the excessive skin was attractive but I need to keep the material for GRS and I think it is kind of unavoidable considering where I started.

Operative report
</p>
<p>
March 14th Operative Report Operative Date: 3/14/2022
</p>
<p>
SURGEON: Alvaro Lucioni, MD
</p>
<p>
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gender dysphoria.
</p>
<p>
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Gender dysphoria.
</p>
<p>
NAME OF PROCEDURE: Bilateral simple orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
ASSISTANTS: None.
</p>
<p>
ANESTHESIA: General.
</p>
<p>
FLUID REPLACEMENT: Please see Anesthesia note.
</p>
<p>
EBL: 5 mL.
</p>
<p>
URINE OUTPUT: Not recorded.
</p>
<p>
SPECIMENS: Bilateral testicles.
</p>
<p>
DRAINS: None. INDICATIONS: Patient is a lady with history of gender dysphoria. After careful discussion of the options for management of this, she would like to proceed with a bilateral simple orchiectomy. Risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with her. Risks including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, injury to any structures such as vascular or nerve structures, risk of chronic pain were discussed with the patient. Risk of hypogonadism and side effects of that were also discussed with her. She understands that some of the hormones could still be produced by the adrenal gland. She also understands the fact that this procedure will render her infertile and that this is not reversible. Informed consent and sterilization consent was obtained. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Bilateral testes appeared normal. No masses noted. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room. After general anesthesia was obtained, the patient was placed in the supine position. She was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A VM pause was undertaken where she was identified by name and date of birth all staff participated. The patient received Ancef 2 g IV x1 prior to the procedure. At this point, a 4 cm midline incision was made in the scrotum right at the raphe. We first started with the patient&#39;s left side. We took the dissection down to the left testicle. Once the left testicle was exposed, we then took down the cremasteric muscles fibers off the cord. The cord was then split in two and hemostats placed proximal and distally and we cut in between. Using a 2-0 silk stick tie, both ends of the cord that had been split were suture ligated and then we used a regular 2-0 silk free tie for suture ligation twice as well. Hemostasis was confirmed. The right orchiectomy was done in a similar fashion. A total of 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine was used as a local anesthetic for cord blocks bilaterally. The dartos was then closed using 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion and then the skin closed with a 4-0 chromic in a running fashion. Dermabond was placed over the incision. A scrotal support and ice were placed. The patient was then awoken and taken to the recovery room in stable condition. PLAN: 1. The patient will be discharged home today with oral pain medications. 2. She will see us back in 1 month or earlier with any issues or concerns.

Fabulous. I am trying to get rid of my evil twins in the U.K. but every surgeon and clinic I’ve approached has slammed the door in my face. I really appreciated the medical reports, that is something you don’t see, thank you for sharing 🙂

That was the most thorough breakdown I&#39;ve ever seen.  Thank you.  I&#39;m expecting to have mine done in the next couple months so it&#39;s fantastic to get such a good walk through of your experience.

I just had mine 4 days ago! It&#39;s also been really smooth recovery for me, I&#39;m GLaD to see I can expect it to probably go well from here out as long as nothing unexpected pops up :3 thank you for sharing!!

I go to my FFS surgeon in August for a consult. This and FFS are the two most important ones for me as well. Of course tracheal shave and hairline along with top/bottom surgery will be addressed but if I needed to step back for a time I could totally be pretty content with just those two.

Thanks for the thorough write up! :) I&#39;m having mine at the end of this week. Excited and a bit nervous haha I was wondering if you know about how long it took from entering the operating room to being discharged from the hospital?

If you don&#39;t mind sharing, did you go through insurance, and what was the breakdown of costs?
