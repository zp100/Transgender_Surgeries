Hey friend! I&#39;m exactly one month ahead of you; mine was with Brassard on May 8th.
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m rounding up on month 2 now,  and I&#39;d say halfway through the second month was when the pain basically vanished.
</p>
<p>
Started introducing pants again around that time too.
</p>
<p>
I get through dilation one day at a time lol.  The step down from 4 per day to 3 per day was huge,  because it gave me a block of time to work with that I could actually do a thing.  You&#39;re just about there I think! My next big one is dropping the sitz baths... omg am I looking forward to re-establishing my relationship with baths lol.
</p>
<p>
I find it still feels like a surgery site though.  Just because it&#39;s not painful doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not overly sensitive still.

Hey!!! I was with brassard April 25th!  I had complications where I went to the ER in Montreal with shock.  Once I got home things got better as the months have gone one! Take it slow and listen to your body! I&#39;m a week past two months now I think and I just wore mom jeans and panties for the first time and went for a walk with my friend that was really long! Take it slow!
</p>
<p>
Also I have had two glorious orgasms listening to my body. But don&#39;t push it!!! Everyone is at a different place! 1 month is a long time and lots happens over that time! Just follow the instructions!
