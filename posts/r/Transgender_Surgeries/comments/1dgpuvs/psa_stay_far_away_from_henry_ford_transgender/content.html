Are you willing to say who your surgeon was? I had heard some good things on here about one of the surgeons there, Laura Garcia-Rodriguez.

But if you had a bad experience with her, that would be helpful to know.

Yes, lies about who is doing the surgery, know now that you will be worked on by a student (fellow) and they will probably fuck you up!! If I have indoor lighting you can see the indentation they left on the right side of my brow and the rest looks like chewed bubble gum so I have a raised brow due to the interrupted tissues under the skin they were careless with. I am 9 months post op and nothing about that part has changed since month 4.
</p>
<p>
She only moved my hairline 2cm, like why the fuck did I even get charged for that!!
</p>
<p>
My eye brows life was not even a lift they are in the same positions pre op!! Again why am I charged for this!!?!?
</p>
<p>
Lip lift was bogus!! Plastic surgery standards yep there are some!! State that female philtrums are between 12-14 mm from bottom of the nose to the top of the lip, male are typically 14-15mm so my “lip lift” was a beautiful 17.5 mm like again what the fuck as I paying for!!!!
</p>
<p>
Lip augmentation looks no different from pre op need i say it again!?!?
</p>
<p>
I had a CY scan done for my 50-70k out of pocket revision by a real professional this coming spring, the results were only the frontal bone was changed nothing was done to the orbital bone structures, and again what the fuck?!?!? Did she actually do the orbital rim contouring that I got charged for!?!?
</p>
<p>
4 hours in the OR, I was off pain meds on day four because the only thing that hurt was my scalp the she only moved 2 fucking centimeters !!!!
</p>
<p>
Yeah, unless you have no other choice I would find someone else. I have gotten juvederm injections to try to make up for the fat transfers to my cheeks that were a total $2800 failure!!!
</p>
<p>
Thats only the surgeon even the shitty nurses that come in the middle of the night and say oh oops I forgot something or damn I am sooooo sick right now and on and on and on!! Also if you question her she will not take well to that at all “god complex”!! She removed my ability to message her after I questioned her work and she told I have no right to criticize her work!!!! LMFAO!!! It’s my fucking face and I cannot criticize a shit show from a so-called professional!?!?!?
</p>
<p>
Fuck her!!!!’
</p>
<p>
Yeah and the funniest part that I should have ran from the consultation, I ask about getting rid of the brow bone area protruding from between my eye brows it makes a very dark shadow that gets me clocked male on 90% of my outings (the ones during the day) and 100% of females don’t have it it’s totally flat in that area for them. She told me if I wanted it smoothed out she would put BONE PASTE to make it go away?!?!?
</p>
<p>
WTF!!! So you want to add mass to a mass affected skull to create a female look? She’s a fucking quack!!!
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the long post but I have even more shit that will amaze you.

I just saw a post from your profile. I think ensure that your insurance will cover certain codes get a lawyer. I used Jay Kaplan he is a free resource from the ACLU really awesome guy!!

I will be using Dr. Mardirossian since I see more appeal in his vision of a female face and he does not use “I will do”, “I will make”, or “you will look like the sister you never had” statements!! He just says I do work that looks like those who are picture on my site and it’s raw data that you can make a judgement from!!!
</p>
<p>
There are not many pictures Laura likes to share or her patients, I shared the shit out of mine because it’s shit work!! I even have friends and family that say yeah you have  a lot of masculine features still and I am glad they don’t hug box me like a ton of people did on this forum and we’re dumping for here but never even went under her students knife!!!
</p>
<p>
I hope you find a great person to work with, this time it out of pocket and going to cost 1/3 of my retirement savings that I have right now! But at least I will be happy!!

The GCS team is not much better they were ok with doing the PPT technique through a hernia repair that another surgical team I thankfully chose due to the shit FFS treatment will not even do because of the complications that can come from it. So Henry Ford was going to risk my health doing a procedure that another team from another clinic that has done over a 1000 GCS procedures when that Henry Ford team has maybe done possibly 100 or less!?!?
</p>
<p>
Yeah fuck Henry Ford transgender health care!!!
</p>
<p>
In case you are wondering about the HERNIA, an umbilical hernia is repaired using surgical mesh. A PPT vaginoplasty is done through the umbilicus since it is in the median of you body where the surgeon want the vaginal canal.
</p>
<p>
Operating through a previously operated on section of your body is not good to begin with but when you add mesh that has bonded with your body in unknown ways that adds more complexity and possibly for complications. With a surgery that is difficult enough to recover from adding a his addition unknown is why I find it utterly irresponsible of Henry Ford to conduct a surgery like this. I am happy I have found professionals that see the risk and will not put me through more horror than I have already received.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, again fuck you Henry Ford Transgender health care!!

why would a hernia have anything to do w PPT?  I have a congenital hernia and not
<em>
one
</em>
of my surgeons ( Pariser, RBL, HF, UCSD) who I consulted for SRS said it would  be a problem. it sounds like  your other surgeons just didnt want to do PPT for you and gave you that reason.

i&#39;m sorry, this is misinformation. a hernia has nothing to do with PPT. the actual peritoneum comes from the bladder area not where a hernia is. any surgeon who tells you this, is just telling you they dont want to operate on you in so many words.
</p>
<p>
these are research studies showing it is safe to do surgery after hernia repair. all the surgeons i spoke to, who do PPT, said a hernia would NOT cause any issues. which surgeon told you otherwise?

Nope not misinformation! Proper information surgeons that want to do no harm! Tepper does not even care if your vagina looks human or not!! I have plenty of people I know that are pissed off at her quality of work!!

Look up umbilical hernia repair and you will see that a mash is used to repair it and you should never go through that or risk more possible damage. Being told by 2 leading class GCS surgeons that they would not do PPT due to unneeded complications with the umbilical hernia  immediately during my appointment is a statement that I trust rather than a surgeon that does not know me and says yes this is fine in the first 5 minutes of the consultation.
</p>
<p>
On top of that I know plenty of GCS patients that are very unhappy with both Tepper and Shakir. But mostly Tepper because she apparently does not know what a vagina looks like while being an owner of one since birth!

i am very familiar with what umbilical hernia repair entails bc i have had 3 surgeries to correct one. including seeing specialists who just deal w hernias only. i provided links to studies about abdominal surgery after hernia repair. Please provide evidence based studies that PPT after hernia repair is dangerous. if you dont have any evidence, then as a fellow patient who has mesh, who is your surgeon who told you otherwise, so i can consult with them?
</p>
<p>
FWIW, i sent the NYU team an email asking directly if my history would prevent PPT. Dr. Zhao replied &#34;we perform complex abdominal robotic surgery in patients with prior mesh hernia repairs often and there is no increased risk for PPT due to the mesh&#34;. So there is that. i am sure other NYU patients can confirm.
</p>
<p>
yours is the *only* review of henry ford&#39;s SRS program on this sub that is negative. im scheduled w dr pariser so its not really my concern but it is plain misinformation to flat out say &#34;you cannot have PPT if you have had mesh&#34;. if you wont share your sources thats your business, but i am beginning to think you dont have any.
</p>
<p>
good luck to you
