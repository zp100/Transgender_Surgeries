So I had a breast augmentation just over a year ago (03/2019) and I’ve had a lot of concerns and I’m wondering if anyone can relate/share some advice.
</p>
<p>
So first of all, I can see my natural breast tissue over the implant. It’s kind of like a weird line of demarcation where my boob goes from round implant to the HRT pointy boob. I wonder if it’s because the implant was too big (the surgeon went bigger than I wanted, and did many other questionable things but that’s a story for another day).
</p>
<p>
Along with that, I have really bad scarring and had really bad stretch marks (that are now mild but still visible) that started appearing around 2.5 months post op. Again, I think he went too big. But now the scars make another weird angle that makes my boobs look really weird and geometric.
</p>
<p>
I’m wondering about revisions with a different surgeon. I want to go smaller but I’m not sure how that works now that the breast tissue is stretched out. And I’m wondering if maybe a fat transfer either in place of/along with a smaller implant would be beneficial. Can anyone speak on this?
</p>

The line is often referred to as a double bubble and is an indication that the surgeon messed up. Either the procedure, implant profile or implant size was incorrect. Only solution is revision surgery. A good surgeon could easily fix this.
</p>
<p>
Whilst this can happen in CIS women and does it highlights my recommendation to go seek out surgeons who perform BA&#39;s on transwomen. There are some suttle differences. A

I’m not sure I’ll let you know what the surgeon says once I talk to him later this week. Hopefully it’s easy to fix rather it be placement or a different type of implant

It does sound like maybe they&#39;re too large. I would get a second opinion as soon as this covered thing blows over to confirm that first, because you need to find out what the problem is before you can find out what your solution options are.
</p>
<p>
It sounds they were placed over the muscle instead of submuscular?

I have the same exact issue besides the scarring issue; I’m going to bring it up to my Dr in a few days.. because  honestly while I like the size of them right now it’s kind of made my boobs wonky

Yes!! I feel like maybe my surgeon wasn’t as educated on trans surgeries as he said he was. Kind of feels like I was just a cash grab for him

Mine specialized in trans care (kaiser) and I went against his advice and went with under the muscle because I had always been told it was better, and I felt that I didn’t have enough breast tissue to warrant over the muscle. However, he went with moderate profile under the muscle... now the separation of breast tissue from implant is visible and it drives me crazy

I also had moderate profile. I wonder if this problem is due to getting an under the muscle implant with not a lot of natural breast tissue to “blend” with it

Hi there! Sorry to hear about your situation. It&#39;s very odd that the surgeon you mentioned who seems to be board certified failed to do your surgery correctly. If you&#39;re based in the US why not go see Dr Dubrow from Botched. They had an episode where they helped a woman with double bubble and they are used to transwomen and other members of LGBT. Dr Bryan Rolfes also does a lot of breast augmentation and FFS and has very good consistent reviews. If I was in the US I would have gone to these plastic surgeons as they seem to care about their patients.

Great! I hope it gets sorted soon and that he can fix the problem for you.
