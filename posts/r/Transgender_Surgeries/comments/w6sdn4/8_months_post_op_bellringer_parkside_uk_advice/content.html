8 months post op and would like some advice please.
</p>
<p>
I had basic PI and have been left with what is shown in the pic.
</p>
<p>
I am hopefully having a revision with a different surgeon at some point just waiting for the consultation.
</p>
<p>
You can see the pouch much more clearly now with my finger puling it away from the entrance. Do you think it will look better if this is removed ? (The pouch, not my finger lol)
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;m worried that it will show the penile skin indicated and be much more obvious. Is there a way to make this look smoother as to me it looks a lot like foreskin and I really don&#39;t like it.
</p>
<p>
Do you think it&#39;s reasonable for me to request / possible for a surgeon to fix it so that everything is &#39;hidden&#39; by labia majora especially when I&#39;m standing up. I just really don&#39;t like seeing it all open with excess skin bulging at either side.

Is that skin superior to your canal? I’m a bit confused but just might be dissonance with my own post surgical anatomy

In it&#39;s relaxed position it is in front of the entrance and collects urine. When dilating I have to push / stretch it down to get the dilator in which is painful.
</p>
<p>
A previous post shows it in the relaxed position

Ok yeh. Now I remember you.
</p>
<p>
That’s seems like an unnecessary piece of tissue unless I’m missing something? So. It’s like attached to almost the entrance to your vaginal canal?
</p>
<p>
Definitely not expected. I just checked my own pussy lol. Have you mentioned this to them? Why they placed it there or if something like a stitch popping or something would have released that tissue from an internal position?
</p>
<p>
Definitely a curious thing

I had granulation there that was treated with silver nitrate at 8 weeks and told the surgeon would not need to see me again (I really don&#39;t like him now if that&#39;s not obvious).
</p>
<p>
Anyway it kept getting worse so I contacted the hospital several times just to be told to keep putting steroid cream on it. It ended up looking like this.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m seeing a different surgeon anyway but I would just like input from other girls that have had it done before I meet with her. I want to have a good idea what is / should be possible so I can ask the right questions and not expect too much of its not viable.

It&#39;s reassuring to know that I&#39;m not the only one with this problem but sorry that you have it as well :(
</p>
<p>
Tbh I probably wouldn&#39;t be bothered how it looks if I didn&#39;t have the urinating issue or I could climax but it just feels like one issue after the other.
</p>
<p>
Really not what I was lead to beleive it would be like at all, I&#39;m quite disappointed and starting to think it&#39;s a mistake that I had it done.

Sorry but it&#39;s the urination issues due to the pouch that has formed that I asked for advice on.
</p>
<p>
I couldn&#39;t care less about how the labia minora look ok when I do not have clitoral sensation and I can&#39;t urinate properly. Plus the scars and bulging tissue that are meant to be labia Majora are disgusting and nothing like any cis vagina I have ever seen. To me they look like small testicles when I&#39;m standing up as they project forwards and hang down to either side of the opening.
</p>
<p>
The fact that the penile skin as indicated on the picture looks like foreskin also really bothers me, it does not look like the lining of natal vagina and sticks out like that all the time. The only reason it is hidden at the moment is because I have that pouch that needs to be removed.
</p>
<p>
Stealth dating has never even crossed my mind, I&#39;m engaged to my girlfriend and while she doesn&#39;t mind what it looks like it does bother me.
</p>
<p>
To be completely honest I also don&#39;t like being hugboxed and told it looks good when I am really not impressed at all. It doesn&#39;t look like a natal one. Dilation is painful even 8 months post op and I cannot climax. It&#39;s crap.

Sorry about misunderstanding your concern. The peeing thing sounds frustrating. I genuinely thought your concern was about looks, and in that regard I stand by what I said, I think it looks great. But I was insensitive about function. I just didn&#39;t get it. I&#39;m hoping a revision may solve that.

Yeah this comment was pretty gross to be honest. You&#39;ve just tried sweeping her issues under the carpet. It may be a non issue to you, but things have gone wrong here, as they have for a lot of people, but we&#39;re discouraged from talking about it because when we do, we get the &#34;BuT iTs sOoOo PreTtY 😍&#34; pre op gang.

I know you’re unhappy but I think your results look amazing and I hope mine looks like yours. (I’m a bellringer girl at 6 weeks post op)
</p>
<p>
With regards to the pouch, if it’s collecting bacteria and urine have a slight revision to amend it. Your scars are similar to my BA scars, they do fade 🤍 Sending love x

Thank you so much and good luck with your revision!
</p>
<p>
I have quite bad scaring from my swelling, it did quite a number on my initial stitches but I’m going to try c section cream at 3 month post and pray!
</p>
<p>
My BA scars were similar to yours but they have faded to basically invisible after a few years with no treatment but I put it down to my pale skin.
</p>
<p>
Keep us updated x

That&#39;s why Tina leaves the compression bandage on for an additional 24 hours, Bellringer ripped mine off without warning at 21 and just left me there crying my eyes out in pain.

Your scars are looking better and I think your vulva is looking really good for PI technique actually x I think Bellringer’s own research states only 75% of his patients can reach orgasm so it’s not uncommon at all
