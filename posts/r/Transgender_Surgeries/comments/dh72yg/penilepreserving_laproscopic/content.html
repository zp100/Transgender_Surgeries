<em>
(see post history for previous entries about this surgery)
</em>
</p>
<p>
This (belated) post covers week 6 post-op. It&#39;s about nerves, dilation, stitches, and moving past the &#34;surgery&#34; mindset.
</p>
<h1>
Swelling
</h1>
<p>
I can sit down without feeling pressure, unless I lean forward. I think part of this is just me regaining my (substantial) leg/butt muscle but also less swelling.
</p>
<p>
Also the lopsided swelling/healing has started to fix itself, phew. Not completely but hey it&#39;s progress.
</p>
<h1>
Dilation
</h1>
<p>
It&#39;s all slooooowly stretching out again after the retraction phase. My insides are starting to re-accommodate it all. I can also dilate right after extending walking sessions without much additional trouble. Still on purple, though.
</p>
<h1>
Stitches!
</h1>
<p>
Oh boy - I think I broke a stitch or two in the last couple weeks. I didn&#39;t notice it because I assumed broken stitches == separation. But yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure now that the stitches are starting to come apart/loose/break/whatever. But because it&#39;s all healed pretty well, they&#39;re stuck inside instead of popping out or whatever.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, they&#39;re starting to
<em>
annoy
</em>
me. I want them out. Now. They restrict my range-of-movement, which is kind of a Big Deal with my ASD. The pain of them poking outside/inside me doesn&#39;t cause near the suffering as being hindered. And I feel like my healing has got to the point where I don&#39;t need them anymore. So, next week I&#39;ll check in and see if I can get permission to do something about it.
</p>
<h1>
Nerves
</h1>
<p>
Feeling is officially come back! Most of this involves awkward pain and itchiness. Like, I can feel the ends of the broken stitches under my skin poking inside if I mess with stuff in certain ways. It&#39;s pretty bad pain I guess? I&#39;d put a second-degree burn on your palm at a 5, and this is at the same level. Like, bad enough you have to address it.
</p>
<p>
Also, I&#39;ve really been noticing how I feel &#34;fuller&#34; down there. The feeling inside &amp; outside is returning and I guess my nerves are getting used to all the new
<em>
stuff
</em>
. It&#39;s pretty cool &amp; gender-euphoric.
</p>
<h1>
Discharge
</h1>
<p>
Same as before. No update unfortunately. There&#39;s a last spot of dead skin from the graft that&#39;s going away but it&#39;s basically just a tinted clear stickiness. There&#39;s alot of it. Pretty nice.
</p>
<h1>
Life
</h1>
<p>
This last week I&#39;ve been getting past the &#34;surgery&#34; mindset (as shown by my late post!). I think it&#39;s healthy mentally, to be switching back to &#34;normal life&#34; mode. It helps that I&#39;m not working yet ofc. I also am 99% sure I&#39;ll dodge the &#34;post-op depression&#34; shtick everyone says is inevitable (though it might just be due to different neurotypes).
</p>
<h1>
Conclusion
</h1>
<p>
A good week! I&#39;ll post again next week. As always, feel free to AMA.

Alot of these questions are answered in my previous posts, have you read those yet? I&#39;ll answer the non-redundant questions though:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Do you ever feel like omg I actually did this or is it... Whew, I actually did it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&#39;s neither. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been much emotion at all about it. I guess I&#39;m just glad that it&#39;s done with so I can get on to other things. The lack of emotion isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s just how I respond to properly-executed plans. I suppose maybe it&#39;s all vaguely annoying?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How often do you have to go to the doctor for follow up?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Every three months for the next year.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Does that cost extra or is it part of the costs of the procedure.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think it costs extra, but it&#39;s still covered by insurance. The appointments aren&#39;t billed until you have them, but it&#39;s billed to insurance.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What would you do different to prepare for the procedure that you wish you would have done?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think I prepared well. I wish the pre-op bowel instructions had worked with my system better but besides that everything was fine.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How about recovery?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Same - I planned well, and it worked out well. I think it would&#39;ve been nice to have had more alone-time though.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Any lessons learned there that could help someone?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This has been touched on in previous posts, but here&#39;s a couple things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
There&#39;s no magic to this (that isn&#39;t in your head). No special nonsense. It&#39;s just a surgery, changing your genitals.
</li>
<li>
A neovagina isn&#39;t the same as a cis vagina. It will never be the same. This is a truism, and I don&#39;t get why people have such trouble with this.
</li>
<li>
Anecdotes or claims from random online strangers mean very little. We have educated and useful authorities (doctors, surgeons, scientists) that should be held above random internet people. Likewise, we have actual published research that is more authoritative than posts or comments or whatever.
</li>
<li>
(linked to above) Acceptance bias, confirmation bias, other biases, and flat-out lies are too common online, including in trans* spaces. It&#39;s embarrassing. Scientific literacy and critical thinking is needed more than ever. Don&#39;t accept baseless claims, even if 1) you like it 2) it&#39;s been gilded and upvoted. Random internet points have no bearing on accuracy or truth, especially when everyone is anonymous and free from responsibility.
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Of those that know, Do your friends, family or co-workers treat you different now in any way?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If I wasn&#39;t already confident/open with being a bit separated from normal society, people would have a bigger problem with hearing about this. People mostly see it as just more proof I&#39;m an Alienâ„¢. One family member supports/trusts me, but most are even more uncomfortable with me than before. Co-workers don&#39;t know.
</p>
<p>
Friends took it well and are supportive in the &#34;yeah it&#39;s something
<a href="/u/the_weird_stuff">/u/the_weird_stuff</a>
would do&#34; way. They see me daily (we live together) and since our interactions haven&#39;t changed, they quickly moved past it. I think they enjoy witnessing how different/&#34;unbelievable&#34; my life is compared to theirs.

You mentioned having compatibility issues with the bowel prep? I&#39;m curious what they were because I had a super rough time with it too.

Yeah I mentioned it in my first post I think. Basically, it didn&#39;t really take effect until Day 1 post-op...so I was in the hospital, having not slept since surgery, having diarrhea and cramping for hours. It was the low point of the whole thing for sure.

Ah, I just had a terrible reaction to the magnesium citrate. Migraine, full body chill and sweats, aches, etc, but it was all better by morning of surgery.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I was allergic to one of the inactive ingredients x.x but my vision wasn&#39;t good enough to read the fine print on the bottle.

Heh, the taste of mine was actually pretty good. But the flavoring had the allergen.
