Maybe an &#39;&#39;OK&#39;&#39; surgeon but ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE PERSON.
</p>
<p>
Best described as the typical devaluating, mistreating, and gaslighting of a narcissist. Never you could imagine that YOUR SURGEON will mistreat you like THAT, in THAT way.
</p>
<p>
Specialized  surgeons are usually jerks and feel like a &#34;god&#34;, and the worst are the ones tied with Psychiatry or with their friend &#34;gender psychiatrists&#34; because the mix between Freudian ideology, and the grandiose ego of such a surgeon, makes a inhuman combo.
</p>
<p>
Belinky and  part of his team and friends, colleagues (like DiMaggio) are absolutely  evil people (one young guy was kind but, he&#39;s on the doctor&#39;s side...)  and I&#39;m believing they can (for... Reasons) botch your body  purposedly  but to extent to not get sued. Smart moves to recommend you do things  that will make your recovery worse, and &#34;anyway it was your decision, i never  told you to do that&#34; kind of patient-doctor relationship.
</p>
<p>
They know how to lead you to unhealthy outcomes but not in a way that will make them accountable.
</p>
<p>
1st Day, 8pm at my room, happy, some unpleasant sensation in my dry mouth but doing WELL. Only at midnight, a deep sharp pain in my right shoulder appeared, and I shut the lights and tried to rest. The pains made it to the omoplat, and started to radiate to the other shoulder. I was completely tired and starting to getting nervous at 3am.
</p>
<p>
At 5am resigned myself to sleep, and waited for some nurse to tell that I have a hard pain in my back, etc. They did nothing.(1st, 2nd, and 3rd DAY, the same, being I called for a GP or someone of the staff....they did nothing)
</p>
<p>
Called Dr. Belinky on wednesday 8 am to tell him that I was
<em>
&#39;&#39;Doc, I&#39;m unable to rest yet, due to a pain in-
</em>
</p>
<h1>
&#39;&#39;Belinky: OK STOP. STOP. LISTEN. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND A THING. YOU ARE ON A PRIVATE CLINIC OK? WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME? THERE IS A PROTOCOL, IT&#39;S A PRIVATE CLINIC AND I HAVE NOTHING TO DO NOW. CALL A DR THERE, IT&#39;S THEIR JOB TO ATTEND YOU OK? DON&#39;T CALL ME AGAIN OK?&#39;&#39;
</h1>
<p>
me_ I called a Dr! and I was-
</p>
<p>
Belinky: _OK,
<strong>
KEEP CALLING
</strong>
. YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND WHAT I&#39;M SAYING, I&#39;M OUT OF THIS, OK?
</p>
<p>
me:_ yes..but..
</p>
<p>
Belinky:_ BUT NOTHING, DON&#39;T CALL ME AGAIN (SHUTS THE PHONE and leaves me talking alone).
</p>
<p>
****************************************************
</p>
<p>
This was the start of the hell for me.Day 3 post-op and unable to sleep for almost 4 days in a row. I asked for some sleeping pills. Then at night appeared a psychiatrist and she walked like if &#39;&#39;it was contagious&#39;&#39; and told &#39;&#39;are you sure you want sleeping pills? well you have to take this and this, to have a rest&#39;&#39;.We had a brief chat and when I checked what pills she ordered, there was an antipsychotic, so I said &#39;&#39;NO WAY, I&#39;m not gonna take this, I&#39;m not psychotic, I have a real pain&#39;&#39;. I slept that night and next morning I was feeling like waking up from a long night,
<strong>
super well rested
</strong>
and telling the nurses that it was right to take sleeping pills, as my shoulder pain wasn&#39;t a problem while I was sleeping artificially.
</p>
<p>
But Javier Belinky doesn&#39;t thinks I had to have a good rest and starting to enjoy the journey. He came then to do more gaslighting and BLAMESHIFTING. The thing here escalated more and more and it was HELL.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;ll  blame it to
<strong>
<em>
&#34;your fucked up mind, you&#39;re mentally ill, etc
</em>
</strong>
&#34; as those exacts words that dr Belinky  repeatedly said to me in the 5 first days on the clinic. Then at the hotel, then when I was home in my province.
</p>
<p>
Fucking asshole, he tried to hide a deep sharp pain (momentary nerve injury,  cervicobrachialgia, OR WHO KNOWS WHAT, BUT HE MUST&#39;VE HELPED ME) in my shoulder that leave me insomniac for almost 4  days, never ever gave me help with sleeping, and he said
<strong>
<em>
&#34;it&#39;s your head  that makes your pain, I won&#39;t say the pain didn&#39;t exists, but it IS IN  YOUR HEAD&#34;
</em>
</strong>
then tried to make me take antipsychotics FFS, to try for 2nd  time to make me shut my mouth of 3 days in a row calling to the staff  &#34;please help me with this pain I CAN&#39;T SLEEP!&#34;. I wasn&#39;t screaming, but it felt like an inner scream for surviving, I was exhausted, couldn&#39;t breath properly, the bandages were too much tight so I couldn&#39;t sleep also for that, couldn&#39;t relax.
</p>
<p>
They treated me like a  psychotic patient all the time. The nurses were all by his side even  they aren&#39;t from his team, just the clinic staff. But they covered his  dirty ass. One nurse was constantly saying with a fake sweet tone &#39;&#39;you make this pain you feel, is not real OK? you are anxious and thus creating the pain, you have to relax ok?&#39;&#39;. Then another nurse told me that the other was talking BS, and that she didn&#39;t believed I was psychotic faking a pain in my back.
</p>
<p>
(then the moment when he started to attack me:)
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
&#39;&#39;OK listen, I&#39;m not telling you are crazy ok? but your head is fucked up, you are mentally ill OK?&#39;&#39;
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
(repeated those hurtful words like 3 times and I couldn&#39;t believe what I&#39;ve heard, WHY he has to be such an agressive coward instead of helping me with my sharp shoulder pain! totally unexplainable because I was on a fucking VULNERABLE POSITION. Maybe he enjoyed see me struggle and having the nightmare of my life)
</p>
<p>
Then after blaming me for
<em>
&#34;creating the pain&#34;
</em>
he gaslighted me every day saying
<strong>
<em>
&#34;you fucked up all  your recovery, you&#39;ll got open wounds now, they&#39;ll become infected,  you&#39;ll loose all the surgery work, many bad things will happen OK?&#34;
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
He sounded like, not a possibility but eventually will happen, for real. And they happened step by step. Then blamed me.
</p>
<p>
Again.
</p>
<p>
But....he  never held accountable for the agression I received from day 2 when I  asked for alleviation of my shoulder! They NEVER HELPED ME,  instead...started a dirty psychological devaluation that put me into a  STRESS SHOCK, then I started to feel bad, really bad and they do started  to say
<strong>
<em>
&#34;are you OK?  No you are not ok, you seem to have something bad  in your head, right? Yes, there&#39;s something bad in your head&#34;
</em>
</strong>
... All with  a dark smile and scary tone...
</p>
<p>
(All  this was provoked me to enter a state of vigilance because I never  expected of being psychologically attacked by health personnel, especially YOUR surgeon who performed SRS on your body)
</p>
<p>
So  basically they covered up their responsibility for my shoulder pain,  covered up some complication in the rectum, all while doing this dirty  gaslighting to provoke me to enter on a SHOCK emotional state ... a  state that they used TO BLAME TO ME!
</p>
<h1>
This is classic narcissistic BLAMESHIFTING abusive behavior.
</h1>
<p>
What a  sickfucks! He should stop taking too much
<em>
white stuff
</em>
and start to be a  human being! The day 5 the 1st dilation, he was HIGH AF. Throwed the 3-dilators kit  in bed, like if it were garbage. His mood was dirty, aggressive, psycho,  and constantly devaluating.This put me in STRESS AGAIN  and it took me  several days in the hotel to recover in again. Then he continued the  GASLIGHT through WhatsApp and phone calls. He&#39;s really a psychopath. I have MANY phonecalls recorded with him doing abandon of person and gaslighting, telling hurtful words. I know the coward takes white shit and then start to act like a sickfuck, but he only does it when he&#39;s on it...coward...
</p>
<p>
(Other  ex patient told me the same about he getting high! So it&#39;s not my  ideation, he really changed mood in the same pattern as the sniffers.  You can put a car in your nose no problem, but
<strong>
this doesn&#39;t allows you to  be abusive with your patients
</strong>
you sickfucks and cowards, because you do  it only WHEN HIGH).
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re a  vulnerable human being when in the OR and while you&#39;re trans, but there  are horrendous people there aimed to put you on stress, you feel very  very BAD, then they blame it to your &#34;bad mental health&#34; they themselves  created!
</p>
<p>
Classic psychopath  behavior and this happens not only in health system, but it shouldn&#39;t  be! You go to the OR to expect leaving in your best state, not worst!
</p>
<p>
I  don&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t went to get SRS to be devaluated and pushed down, and  abandoned in the hotel. I TRUSTED MY SURGEON LIKE NEVER. I was mindfucked by him and then he blamed me for the stress he &amp; his team  provoked on me.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re from  another country and bring
<strong>
USD DOLLARS in the hand
</strong>
you&#39;ll be treated like  the Queen of Windsor. This way they evade paying taxes to the State.
</p>
<p>
If  you&#39;re a local and bring local Peso (ARS) and with no accompaniment  you&#39;ll be mistreated, pushed down, pissedof, attacked, gaslighted and  abandoned.
</p>
<p>
Just warning locals of DiMaggio and Belinky. Horrible persons both.
</p>
<p>
******************************************************
</p>
<p>
This was hurtful to write and to transcribe from the recorded phonecalls and whatsapp voice notes. I&#39;m recovered now thanks to few only friends and other compassionate SRS surgeons, but he left me with PTSD and I needed to get helped by a CBT psychologist and a psychiatrist to treat it.
</p>
<p>
I was in tremor while I was writing down the phone calls and remembering the worst moments at the clinic (IADT). I
<strong>
DO NOT have fear
</strong>
anymore of some people here trying to save his dirty ass, or defend him in any way, I&#39;m here to give advise NOT to risk your life &amp; health leaving them in dirty&#39;s Javier Belinky&#39;s hands.

DiMaggio at first seemed like a cool guy, but then he started to act with self grandeur and weird. Super insecure, and he&#39;s afraid to death of his public notoriety. But he blames you for it. Anyway, when I had respiratory troubles with the inflammated glottis (a complication due to intubation) he said &#34;you need a psychiatrist&#34; and things like that.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Fidalgo offered a solid help but I couldn&#39;t afford it due to being at 800+ kms from La Plata. He gave me many recommendations even I&#39;m not his patient, and the same with dr Lizzi from Rosario. They both helped me A LOT with just wsapp messages and made my recovery less miserable. You can even notice in their voice that they really were worried about my state. The human factor is the most important thing in a major surgery. Tysm!

Oh I&#39;m so sorry you had to have that horrible experience also, I know there are more of us damaged by this surgeon, at least 2 more from my province, and even more.  He just tries to sugarcoat himself in interviews, to appear humanly caring, but he&#39;s really a sadistic psycho. Can I DM you for a talk?
</p>
<p>
Hope you&#39;re doing better, best healthy wishes!

I&#39;m so sorry to hear this. We make ourselves so vulnerable as patients and it can be deeply damaging if surgeons behave like this. I hope you have people to support you through this. And even a good therapist to help you process this. Sending positive thoughts

It was worst than what I wrote here, I just can NOT write everything that happened with him and the people surrounding him, like &#39;&#39;Flor&#39;&#39; (a nurse from Colombia or Dominican Republic or whatever she was from),  that gaslighted me all the time and covered his shitty ass. She tried to blame me for everything that it was going bad saying &#39;&#39;you have so much fear, that&#39;s why you provoke the pain&#39;&#39; and stupid things like that!
</p>
<p>
Fuck off foking monkey, I wasn&#39;t in fear until they started to mismanage everything, but blamed ME for their own fails and mistreatments.
</p>
<p>
When a sadistic/psychopath person wants to ruin your life, they do this: they gaslight you and make you go into a state of hypervigilance, they notice your fear and then shock you more to make a point. That&#39;s when they start to say &#39;&#39;oh look at you, you seem to be fearful, right? yeahhh you&#39;re oh so fearful&#39;&#39; and then they sustain your bad state enough time for their convenience, because the more shocked you are, the more they have to their advantage to SHIFT the things and say &#39;&#39;see? you are full of fear now, you are mentally unstable&#39;&#39;, when THEY THEMSELVES CREATED YOUR FUCKEDUP MENTAL STATE.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I was really happy of having this surgery, never felt fearful of something, until they started to mistreat me. Then all went horribly bad for me when I noticed they were trying to hide something wrong...they said things that were contradicting themselves once and again, and that was the moment when I started to feel in fear, because I expected them to take care of me, not this horrible gaslighting and abandonement

I second this, a while ago I had a consultation with him bc I was interested in having an orchiectomy. He was incredibly weird during the appointment, telling me he only did orchis on ppl who had trouble taking  antiandrogens. Sounded like he was trying to convince me I didn’t need an orchi which is something I didn’t felt when I spoke to other surgeons.
</p>
<p>
anyways, this thread is very old but I hope you’re doing better!

Do you live in argentina?
</p>
<p>
He shouldn&#39;t mind if you need it or not, he should just do it, end of story.
</p>
<p>
In the argentine circle of surgeons, he&#39;s very well known for being interested ONLY IN THE MONEY, like his friend DiMaggio. They both are jerks and imbecile people who only wants the shitty money. They don&#39;t care at all of you, ONLY THEY CARE when it&#39;s convenient for their advantage and reputation.

Yes I live in Argentina and you&#39;re absolutely right there&#39;s no need for him to know why I want an orchi.
</p>
<p>
Weirdest thing is, after we engaged in a brief discussion about if I needed an orchi or not he suddenly changed his mind and told me &#34;I don&#39;t really mind removing your testicles&#34; don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but he used a rude tone that left me with a bad taste in my mouth. After that he supposedly put me on a waitlist but he never asked about how to reach me if my surgery was ever going to be scheduled. Needless to say it&#39;s the most uncomfortable experience Ive had with a surgeon.

It doesn&#39;t surprises me, that&#39;s his classic way of answering, rude, impolite, not serious but angry. You do know? He hates trans people, he only wants MONEY from us, that&#39;s why he&#39;s always angry. He only gets &#39;&#39;cool&#39;&#39; when the patient shows up with their relatives, friend, partner (not alone) and requests a SRS which is more money for him.
</p>
<p>
He surely told you that, as a way of dodging your request and leave you.

Tactical answer frrom a person who&#39;s only interests are the BUSINESS, not the person. Be sure that if you offer paying him in &#39;&#39;USD in hand&#39;&#39; he will schedule your surgery immediately.
</p>
<p>
Truly a horrific inhuman person.

My husband got top surgery with Eduardo Angheben, he just had his last check up today and asked about genital surgery because he was diagnosed with endometriosis and needs surgery (he will ask for an histerectomy and meto surgery for the phallus as he will already be having surgery down there). We asked the doctor for recomendations and he said we should talk to Belinky so we googled him and came across this post. It all sounds awful! Do you have any info on better doctors for these kind of surgeries?
