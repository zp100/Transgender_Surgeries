Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors for SRS? Do you recommend Dr. McGinn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Are you planning to undergo any revision surgery or medical tattoos? How was the stay in New Hope? How was Dr. McGinn&#39;s aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery
</p>

Ok. Now I can respond. Dilating while I do this. Lol.  I 10000000000% recommend Dr. McGinn. Idk why anyone would go elsewhere.  Not many can say that their vagina and vulva has passed fingering, penetration, oral, etc. and not been clocked at 9 weeks post op.  So yes I recommend her very much!!
</p>
<p>
I am consider a labiaplasty . Mainly just being picky and particular.  Probably gonna do a fat transfer to make vulva more puffy.  Maybe tattoo if I feel I need it. At this point any additions will be to perfect.  As I said, looks wonderful. Surpassed my expectations.
</p>
<p>
I chose Dr. McGinn because I‚Äôve been following her career for almost a decade now.  She‚Äôs one of the only surgeons who does srs and is trans herself. She is one of a few who started doing reconstructive/plastic  surgery from the beginning of her career.  Some surgeons do plastic surgery now but they didn‚Äôt start off doing that. I wanted someone who knows the in‚Äôs and outs of reconstructive surgery.  She‚Äôs truly a master. The pics on her website are NOTHING like things look.  They‚Äôre old and early on in her career.
</p>
<p>
So if money isn‚Äôt an issue. Go to New Hope and get it done there.  PI, in my opinion is the most natural way. PPT is still too new and the tissue is too thin that there‚Äôs risks of it tearing in future. I just wouldn‚Äôt risk that.  Also I do get wet, idk how or what but dripping wet.  I squirt, idk how or what but it happened.  I don‚Äôt have a cis mucosa and idgaf. Only a doctor going in there would notice. Otherwise my kitty stays wet. Just use ‚Äúgood clean love‚Äù moisturizer. Etc. Organic and wonderful. Keeps your natural flora smelling like good ole vagina. And keeps the Ph balance. etc etc.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetically speaking‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt go off of photos that you see here. Like the vulva looks sooooo much better in person. Ppl here post ugly photos with bad lighting and too much of a close up that makes things look odd. Not always but usually.   But yeah. Her aesthetics are wonderful and she does free labiaplasty. Only time you pay is if you have to go under anesthesia. But typically you don‚Äôt. Honestly all good things to say about doctor McGinn.  She‚Äôs a badass.   I DID NOT meet with any other surgeon. I did my research but deep down I knew she was it. My intuition never fails me. And since I had been following her career for so long. I just knew it was her. Also the waitlist is short. If you pay cash like I did, prob can get it done within 4-6 months.   I actually didn‚Äôt even meet her face to face until the day before surgery. And not once did I have hesitations. Because they‚Äôre all so damn wonderful and helpful. Just be patient. They are super busy so don‚Äôt expect them to baby you.

I answered some of these in my other posts. I stayed in new Hope for a month. And everything has been incredible. As I said in previous posts, I‚Äôve been having stealth sex for a month now.  Yes that early. And yes Dr. McGinn knows I had sex early. She said not to tell girls to do it but that for some ppl like myself it‚Äôs ok since I healed fast. Just gotta listen to your body.
</p>
<p>
Aftercare is amazing. Nothing but good things to say. Cosmetic etc etc. all good. Beautiful and clearly Cis looking enough to be having stealth sex.
</p>
<p>
And thank you!!  Sorry I‚Äôm like responding to everything quick. Lol forgot I posted this and I‚Äôm on my way out.

I got a couple üôà I am about to hit 6months HRT and wanted to get a head start on SRS prep and stuff. McGinn is the one surgeon that makes me consider out of state but I happen to be close to Dr. Wittenberg in SF as I am in the Bay Area myself currently.
</p>
<p>
1.)How long from when you first reached out to when you had the surgery? 2.) If from out of state, what did you do for recovery before returning home? 3.) How long did you do hair removal for/what did the hair removal ‚Äúplan‚Äù look like in preparation? 4.) Did you meet with any other surgeons before deciding McGinn?
</p>
<p>
Thank you and more importantly congratulations sis!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I am from out of state. I flew in to PA and stayed a whole month. Surgery at the time could be scheduled 4-6 months out I if you had your letters and everything out together. Which I did. But still waiting 2 years to do it because I wanted to finish school before doing it. And I got them done as a graduation gift.
</p>
<p>
No I didn‚Äôt meet with any other surgeon. I had been doing research for a decade. And she was always on top based on the things I mentioned in the above comment.
</p>
<p>
I did full body hair removal. Keep in mind I‚Äôm not very hairy. But I did about 7 sessions. Cost me around 3 thousand( but was full body) . Then I did 2 electrolysis session just in genital area. And that was plenty. I would suggest doing some laser first and then do electrolysis on the stubborn hair.
</p>
<p>
Recovery. Like I said I was there for a month. Financially speaking, money wasn‚Äôt an issue for me so I know I went about it differently than most ppl. I had everything done for me and delivered etc. like anything I needed or wanted I got.  So it made things easier. And fun.  However, I would definitely recommend having someone with you at all times.  At least for 2 weeks which is the recommended.  Also I would totally totally totally suggest first class tickets if you‚Äôre flying‚Ä¶ also you‚Äôll need a rental. Make sure the other person drives and can drive you. Also make sure to arrange transportation at airport. So you‚Äôll use a wheelchair and be taken around and skip lines and such.
</p>
<p>
Before surgery. The days prior. PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS. GIRLS DONT LISTEN AND ITS SO IMPORTANT.  You bitches better take notes üòÇüòÇüòÇ
</p>
<p>
The weeks prior. Buy the pre surgery ensure drinks. Drink a shit ton of it. DRINK DRINK DRINKS. eat healthy. Go on runs etc. get your body in prime shape. Also but the presurgery clear drinks. They will prevent nausea after anesthesia. That‚Äôs prob why my recovery was easy. I didn‚Äôt suffer through the liquid diets cause those clear drinks are approved and have tons of calories. Just keep them super cold. BUT THE DAMN DRINKS!!!  I liked them. If you don‚Äôt, suck it up. It will change your life. Seriously!   Buy a shit ton of bed pads, buy jumbo maxi pads.  Also. LUBE‚Ä¶ just use the good clean love almost naked brand. SERIOUSLY. It‚Äôs the best. Organic.. ph balanced. Very wet and will keep you healthy down there‚Ä¶. Also buy a big bottle of Tylenol.  I didn‚Äôt even take pain meds. Just Tylenol sufficed. Also when you‚Äôre in hospital the first two days in morphine drip. Click that button every chance you get. Lol. Every time you can press it. You‚Äôll sleep most of the two days and before you know it. You‚Äôre off the pain meds. No pain and good to go.  Be sure to have someone get you a silk pillow case. Youll thank me later. Hair will be a fucking mess so braid it or something.    There‚Äôs many more things but that‚Äôs the main things I can think of. Just don‚Äôt stress it. It‚Äôs seriously not bad. Just stay healthy and don‚Äôt get obese. And don‚Äôt smoke. And go run and move around. Stay active.

How old are you by chance? I feel like the younger you are the better you could handle both at the same time.

A breeze.  I had someone with me for a whole month. So I didn‚Äôt really have issues.  I didn‚Äôt start dilating till the second week due to swelling. But I moved up quickly on dilator size. Was on the biggest one by 4 weeks post up.   Currently still dealing with fatigue‚Ä¶ waiting for the testosterone to kick in so that my body gets more energy. I feel almost 100 but still get exhausted and need rest a lot.

How&#39;s the pain level? I can&#39;t do pain at all and this is why I&#39;m terrified of the surgery.

Avanessian and McGinn are, in my opinion, the top two surgeons in the US right now. I also did nearly a decade of research on McGinn and thought I was going with them for surgery, but I ended up choosing Avanessian. Your experience and results seem to closely mirror mine.
</p>
<p>
I think you can‚Äôt go wrong with either of them, they are both good phenomenal!
