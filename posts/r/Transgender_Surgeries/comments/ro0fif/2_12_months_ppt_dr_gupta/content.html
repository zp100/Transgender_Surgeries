Hi all! So if you&#39;ve been following my posts I had a really not so great tear.
</p>
<p>
So after weeks of putting off getting a skin graft, I needed it for the inside. So I bit the bullet, got the graft. IT REALLY SUCKED. However it&#39;s helped tremendously with everything. I should have just did it when he first suggested it. He really does have your best interest and care in mind. So had surgery again on the 3rd of December. No dialating for a week. They put a catheter in and wrapped it into place for the stitching.  Also having a stint in you sucks. You have one when you come out originally but there&#39;s so much going on you don&#39;t really realize it. The week they kept everything wrapped up I knew it was there. Also sleeping was very difficult.
</p>
<p>
Back to dialating I needed to start back at the very smallest 2. Swelling has gone down a lot and my dialator sits usually between the middle dot to the second to last dot. No pain at all, no bleeding either. I was getting both of those prior to second surgery but wasn&#39;t bad.
</p>
<p>
As for the outside he&#39;s been putting a treatment of something he called magic gel. It stays on for a day we&#39;ve done 2 applications, during that time frame it just stay in place for the day. Yesterday was second application and today it looks really good! I&#39;m very happy. He&#39;s very happy. So much that we&#39;re now going 6 weeks to next appointment from once a week or so. Things are finally swinging in the right direction.
</p>

Thank you for posting!  I&#39;ve been following your recovery as Gupta is a contender for me (now if I could only quit stalling and start hair removal).
</p>
<p>
Looks like things are healing up nicely, congrats!
