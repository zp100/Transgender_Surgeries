Use a browser to look at that, not a reddit app, or you may not see much.

I live in Barcelona and went to IM Clinic for a BA consult, I had extremely bad experience. No reference images, no asking what i wanted, just a &#34;I&#39;ll make you nice breasts, trust me&#34; with nothing to back it up. I went to Sanza Clinic for my BA (also in Barcelona) and I&#39;m super happy with my result.
</p>
<p>
I know that at least one other very high ranking prominent FFS doctor has very low opinion of IM Clinic, so take that as you wish.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t have surgery there.

When I was there, I also mentioned GRS, which I&#39;m planning to have through the public healthcare later this year. The IM clinic insisted that public &#34;only makes the canal!&#34; (as in no vulva) and I&#39;d be much better off doing it through them instead. That is definitely not true - the hospital I am going to even offers robotic assisted ppt.... just seemed pretty scummy all around, they were definitely more salesmen than surgeons imo......

If you feel like something is not right with this surgeon, trust your guts. There are other plastic surgeons specialised in vaginoplasty for transgender people in Barcelona/Spain with whom you can feel safe and well-informed. I wish you good luck!

It&#39;s not that I&#39;m saying you shouldn&#39;t go there, but to just be careful that he is focused more in the money part than in the treating well the patient part.
