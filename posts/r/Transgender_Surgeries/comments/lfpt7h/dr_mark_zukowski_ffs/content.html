Dr zukowski should retire.  He is botching too many girls . I got a lip lift from him in 2014. I’ve had 4 revisions since ! He cut into my nasal sills and completely deformed my face just from a simple lip lift! He is a terrible surgeon. I would recommend every one to stay FAR away from him . I personally know 4 other girls he botched too .

Yes ! I feel felt the same way . He set me back in my transition because I had to use the money to get reconstructive surgery to fix what he did . I hope future girls realize this and stay far far away from him.

Could you please explain a little more? I know that you’re upset but I honestly see nothing wrong, there’s nothing that can’t be fixed. You’ve come this far, go a little further x

I miss my old nose so badly.. I hated it and now I want it back. I wish I could jump into a time machine and undo this mess. I can’t breathe right anymore, I’m not eating, I’m just wasting away now..

He ruined my nose, I wanted a more refined and thinner nose. I ended up with a wider bridge, that’s all bone, not swelling. I’ve already checked with other surgeons to confirm this. The tip of my nose has a massive indent. It looks 100x worse than it ever did. I can’t go on like this, he has changed my life.

Okay so if it’s bone then that can be removed, just like before. How long has it been since the surgery?

It’s been about two weeks,  yes I know it’s very early. I’ve already had consultations with two other plastic surgeons that have told me that this isn’t a temporary defect. This is the underlying bone and cartilage showing through the swelling and as the swelling subsides , it will likely become more noticeable.

It pretty much the only work he did. She got nose, chin, lip and fat grafting. Nose being the center piece to that.

Omg!!’ I got my nose done back in 2009 and he did a great job on me, however, I want back for a BBL in 2011 but he didn’t give me the ass I wanted. I had it redone in Miami. I’m so sorry about your experience. I’ve heard he has been fuking up a lot in the last 8 yrs. Its sad. I would never go back to him personally.

You might feel better and more in control it you try to focus on planning your revision. Give it time heal and start preparing to get it fixed.

Just a very good advice from me, check Dr Tolga Bilece or Dr Ali Evlice for your nose.
</p>
<p>
And Dr Jumaily or Dr Ben Talei for your lip lift and undo the bad work

I’ve heard that Dr.Jumaily is great with revisions in general. Never heard of Dr. Tolga Belice Or Dr.Ali Evlice I need to look into those. Are they experienced with completely destroyed noses?

Dr Ali Evlice and Dr Tolga Belice do the most perfect gorgeously feminine noses I&#39;ve ever seen. And I&#39;ve seen almost all rhinoplasty surgeons results in USA, Europe, Turkey, Iran, Venezuela, Colombia...etc I&#39;m addicted to noses!
</p>
<p>
And yes they do revisions. Even almost impossible revisions.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know in which order you should go, if first nose or lip lift correction, but start contacting Dr Jumaily. I love him. He does one of the most perfect lip lifts, scars are so thin and invisible after a few months.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Fortunally&#34; I think Dr Z did a poor job on your nose and lip lift scar only. Very easy to undo. Overall your face looks more soft and gorgeously feminine. But you have to be very careful in choosing your revision surgeon because if you start doing a lot of revisions on the same problem it will make it worse!

He only did my chin, and fat grafts aside from nose and lip lift. So he didn’t do a whole lot thankfully.  I actually have a consultation with Jumaily on the 26th on this month so I can’t wait!

Please I want you to keep me updated on your progress
</p>
<p>
I should also add that your face is still super swollen. But we can see already how radient your face is certainly because of the fat grafts, and how soft and gorgeously feminine it is. You only need revision on your nose and a very minimal revision on your lip lift scar.
