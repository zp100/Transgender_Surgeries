honestly, it was great! i had some complications whereby the day after surgery my coronal incision had a minor clot which bled a lot but from 60 minutes of noticing it, i was all stapled up and back in bed resting! (the clinic was 10 mins away from where i was staying lol). he‚Äôs really great and so are the team, i would absolutely recommend i could not be happier and i have 0 facial dysphoria now. 10/10 experience

good luck with your surgery by the way!!! the wait is excruciating but it is so worth it. i‚Äôd say just make sure you stay consistent with your painkillers. i used about 1/2 of my prescription which was more than enough for over a week of consistent narcotics üòÖ. i imagine it helped a lottt

I have my date with him in December. So I will be recovering over Christmas and was wondering how well the pain is taken care of as I&#39;m very much looking forward to the surgery but not the pain lol. You have great results and I can&#39;t wait. I was wondering about the Coronal vs Hairline incision. Is that because you chose that or it was because you didn&#39;t need a hairline advancement/rounding like I am getting? I&#39;m getting type 3 /hair line advance and rounding/eye brow lift/rhino. My worry about a coronal suture for me would be obvious hair loss as it thinned a bit on top before I started HRT. It&#39;s not obvious but there&#39;s not enough to get like full hair extensions as of last year at this time... which is when I last got a haircut hah.
</p>
<p>
Our forehead profiles are similar pre-ffs so if he does me as good as you my god I would be so happy.

yeah so as far as pain i was barely in discomfort with my forehead. a few aches during recovery but the pain meds he prescribes are great. i chose coronal because i‚Äôm happy with my hairline. i did end up picking at the right side of my incision and have had some hairloss there. nothing major, totally invisible to everyone but me when i part my hair along the incision. on the other side where i didnt pick at it i had no hairloss and the scar has recovered great you can barely see it! i had type 3, orbitals &amp; brow lift too so hopefully that gives some context. feel free to ask anything else &lt;3

If I ever get FFS I&#39;d want it to be with him - what is the procedure for going through insurance?  How much was it in total, what&#39;d you have done?  How was the aftercare so far, and how fast was the recovery?  Does it feel different, as in can you feel a difference in your face that&#39;s noticable?  Any damage to the nerves?

im not sure how insurance works as i paid out of pocket (i‚Äôm from the UK). i essentially had a type 3 forehead reconstruction and a pretty aggressive sliding genioplasty. overall it was $35,350 however i had a quote for jaw work too that was in the early 40s. aftercare was super easy honestly i just kept up ice, my mouthwash and bandage changing! my sister and mom were there by my side for the whole thing so maybe they remember it different but because i had coronal incision i didnt require any kind of polysporin application as you would with a hairline incision. i am 5 weeks post op now and feeling great, if you want i can send more pics of before vs after and the healing process but it‚Äôs completely up to you!
</p>
<p>
i have quite a lot of nerve damage, which is to be expected lol. most of the feeling in my mouth has returned entirely now and i‚Äôm beginning to feel my forehead, however the incision in my hair is completely numb. my face barely feels different though!

hii! i had a very atypical experience paying without insurance &amp; from the UK. i had type 3 forehead &amp; sliding genioplasty. dr. m adds lots of other procedures like brow lift and some other fancy words which basically just describe surgery but yeah, 2 procedures essentially. it was $35,350. i also had time restrictions so i had my consult last july and surgery this august but it was out of my own choice to wait that long, so i‚Äôm not sure how quickly he can get you in if you want ASAP. sorry! &lt;3

Gosh that is long. I suppose it‚Äôs worth the waiting time right. Did he give you a Barbie nose by any chance? I wanted to go to a rhinoplasty surgeon but if I can get everything from mardri I won‚Äôt need to.

TLDR is that the first 24 hours of recovery are terrible, and you‚Äôll look like trash for at least a week (
<em>
especially
</em>
for the first few days). Your physiology may prevent you from being able to meet your goals (for example, my trachea is so big that even after a tracheal shave I still have a larger-than-cis-male-average Adams Apple). Swelling is long-lasting, even though many people‚Äôs pictures make it seem minimal (your swelling feels bigger than it looks, and looks bigger to you and people who know you than strangers on the internet).
</p>
<p>
That‚Äôs the ‚Äúin general‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Dr Mardirossian is amazing, kind, and
<em>
very
</em>
good at what he does, and all of the support staff (hospital, nurses, anesthesiologists, etc) are incredible. The tough things I outlined above have nothing to do with them, and everything to do with the surgery generally. I would recommend him and his team to
<em>
anyone
</em>
who is looking for FFS

I&#39;m only doing forehead+rhino and from my initial call to their clinic to setup the initial consultation to when I will be having my surgery will have been roughly ~6-7 months? And from Consultation to surgery only ~3. That is mostly because I&#39;m only having forehead/hairline/rhino and could make a certain date otherwise it would probably be about ~5 months from the actual consultation (or more I&#39;m not sure again I&#39;m only having a few procedures).
