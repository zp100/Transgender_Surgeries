Yes. I had surgery after having a web glottoplasty elsewhere. The anesthesiologist said a 5.5 might be too small as it was what was generally used for a child and it might put too much pressure on the chest (?) He did use a “smaller” one on me and was careful taking it in and out, and my voice surgery is just fine. The vocal webbing isn’t just a single stitch holding normal cords together; they cut out the muscle and sew the raw edges together, and it does heal. It’s a permanent fix over time. I think once it’s been healed for a year or so it’s about as permanent as it’s going to get. You just don’t want to try and shove a giant tube in there and tear something during the healing phase. My doctor gave me a letter to give to the anesthesia team which emphasized that they should be careful inserting and removing the tube as well.

Thank you so much, I’m glad that it worked just fine! I assumed there must be a way otherwise nobody would go for a voice surgery. Perpahs they used 6 or 6.5 but the key is to carefully insert and remove. I sent a message to Yeson to confirm this because I would hate to go through so much expenses and not talk for a month only to set the voice back.

It was a 6. It was smaller than normal. I went to Dr. Thomas. Also, for some small procedure I had after VFS they were able to do it under deep IV sedation with a laryngeal mask that did not involve a tube down the throat. Not only did this not put stress on my surgery, I also had a faster recovery. This is only available on some minor procedures though like cosmetic things, not for major operations. But even when I had general with a breathing tube my voice surgery was just fine, the anesthesiologist was just careful.

Thank you for clarifying that it was 6mm tube! Did you have just the vocal cord shortening procedure with Dr. Thomas or the invasive one? Also, how did you like the results of the VFS? If you have a recording shared somewhere or willing to share, please let me know where I can listen to the before and after, of course only if you feel comfy to share that! Thank you so much!

I’d also like to hear about your experience with Dr Thomas!

How was your overall experience? What was the surgery like? Are you happy with the visual and audible results?
</p>
<p>
I’m planning on seeing him next year. They’re insisting it do my FFS first even though I could do VFS this year and it’d still be ~6 months or more between surgeries.

Oh that sounds good!
<br>
I&#39;m going for the FEMLAR, since I still need that reduction.
</p>
<p>
Do you buy chance have a before/after somewhere?

I&#39;m having bottom surgery first before I go to Yeson for my VFS. This way I can avoid intubation problems.
</p>
<p>
This is the way I suggest many people do it. This way you have time to heal from bottom surgery and then do VFS as the final surgery so that you don&#39;t need intubation for a long time if ever again.

I thought about the same but for bottom surgery I have to wait at least a year for a proper hair removal and also the wait in general but the voice is such a dysphoria that I get misgendered like 100% on the phone and 0% in person that I want to do it ASAP. I also want to make sure that it&#39;s safe to have intubation in the future, we all hope we don&#39;t need it in the future but it&#39;s life, but life is unpredictable and I want to make sure after a year or so once it properly healed there is no danger of ripping the stitched area back to how it was and drop the voice. Good luck with the bottom surgery dear!

That&#39;s the same thing I was wondering. I had VFS in germany at MEVOC.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
To be they said maximum tube size should be no more than 6 and well in 3 months I am having my SRS so I am a bit nervous about this to be honest.

I haven&#39;t had voice surgery but during GRS they used a tube up my nose rather than down throat.
</p>
<p>
No idea why, I just seen it on my medical records.
</p>
<p>
My teeth are sound and I don&#39;t have any issues with my mouth. Perhaps I had clamped my mouth shut as I took ages to go under and remember being very scared and wanting to stop it before my memory blank kicked in.
