Thanks for your reply ðŸŒž
</p>
<p>
I get the impression they don&#39;t push a hard sell for additional procedures?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve a strong jawline and have always disliked my chin, so it&#39;s something I&#39;m definitely going to do. I&#39;m coming to this from the perspective of trying to have the least surgeries possible, which is why I am on the fence with the nose.
</p>
<p>
So they didn&#39;t say you needed work on chin/jaw? Do you think their working style is too conservative?
</p>
<p>
How has healing and pain been for you the last few months? How long before you could eat?
</p>
<p>
Have you still got numbness?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a little early to say if you still have bruising, but how similar to your virtual FFS (if they made one for you) is your result?
</p>
<p>
Do you find any facial dysphoria you may have had has gone, and overall do you feel satisfied with the results?
</p>
<p>
Do you think (again maybe too early to say) you might want revisions?
</p>
<p>
How many FFS surgeons did you consult with prior to choosing Facialteam, and why did you decide Facialteam was the one to go for?
</p>
<p>
Sorry loads of questions, if you would rather DM me please do! ðŸ’—

Incredible response, thank you so much, this is really helping the anxieties of this entire process.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just super worried I&#39;ll do this and end up feeling dysphoric still (and have spent a considerable sum doing so), but then it&#39;s better than doing nothing I guess! ðŸ˜¬
</p>
<p>
So glad that things have worked out for you, and I wish you a speedy and smooth recovery ðŸ’—
