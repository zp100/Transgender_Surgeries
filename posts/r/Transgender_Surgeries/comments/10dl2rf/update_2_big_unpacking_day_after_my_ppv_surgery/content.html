Heyy everyone,  i just wanted to give an update on my Journey with Siam tranformative and dr theerapong in Bangkok. Today was finally day of my unpacking, i have to say nothing was particular painfull for this part just maybe a little uncomfortable. I am really pleased with my result so far, i am already sensitive in my clitoris (so happy with that). The doctor said that the results were even better then he expect cause i was circumsed. During the whole day i was feeling nausea so i couldnt eat much since this was the first day i was allowed to eat solid foods again by the time the girls from siam tranformative came to pick me to go the appartment and i had to get up, i fainted 2 times after laying on back the whole time. But the girls from siam and my husband where able to get me up and by the 3rd time i was able to sit up straight, get up and sit in the wheelchair. When  i got in the appartment was finally able to eat something so i already feel much better. I couldnt have done this without the help of Becky,Cherry, Reyanna and Meridith from siam tranformative and of course my lovely husband.UPDATE i just had my first dilation and i have 7 inches of depeth!
