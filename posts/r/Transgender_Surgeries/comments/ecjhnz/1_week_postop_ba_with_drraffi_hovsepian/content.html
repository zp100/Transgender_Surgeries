About 8 years, and yeah I was on spiro, but at this point I‚Äôm on a very low dose.
</p>
<p>
Right now I‚Äôm doing BioTE pellets for HRT but it‚Äôs just for maintenance, I stopped developing after around 5 years
</p>

Edit: why am I being downvoted for answering a question?

Thanks for answering my question. Sorry that you got down voted. It‚Äôs quite easy to do by accident on the phone app.
</p>
<p>
I  wanted to say that you should be happy with your results. I‚Äôve dreamt of having breasts perhaps for 40+ years and I‚Äôm envious.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure of the  difference but it wasn‚Äôt round so I‚Äôm gonna assume it was anatomical?

First 4/5 days are pretty rough since I wasn‚Äôt able to shower and I was told to to keep my arms by my side and not move them too much.
</p>
<p>
Also the surgical bra hurts like hell, but my doc gave me soft sports bra today at my post op appointment and it‚Äôs much easier

Worse tbh, mostly because I‚Äôm a really active person and at least with FFS I was able to stretch and move my body, with this I was basing stuck in bed playing my switch for 4 days.
</p>
<p>
I was so bored I played and got through the entirety of assassins creed Black flag from the beginning  üò´

You are honestly not the first person to tell that. Well I for sure didn&#39;t handle FFS well, so  I can&#39;t wait for this one lol. Maybe I&#39;ll finally beat something in my backlog of gamesüôÉ

Gummy bear implants/Silicone under the muscle and the incision was as small as possible (I think 1‚Äù?) right under the breast.
</p>
<p>
Make sure your surgeon is skilled and I‚Äôd ask if they specifically have done it on trans patients. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs 100% necessary that they have.. but I flew to a different state for this surgeon because I felt very confident that he could get a natural looking result even through I‚Äôm not a biological female
</p>
<p>
Oh and I‚Äôd also ask if you can do fat redistribution.  TBH I would have done that instead and I consulted with about 4 surgeons who specialize in it.. but unfortunately they said for my case it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it because I have almost no body fat.
</p>
<p>
If you have the right body type for fat redistribution it‚Äôs prob a much better and safer option.. implants don‚Äôt last forever but a fat transfer should since it‚Äôs using you‚Äôre own body‚Äôs material

Im going to Boston medical center for mine. My surgeon does most trans patients in the area since BMC and masshealth are partners. Ive always been a skinny girl so i dont think fat redistribution is something i could do. Thank you so much for the info. Ill have to remember thede questions for my consult:)
