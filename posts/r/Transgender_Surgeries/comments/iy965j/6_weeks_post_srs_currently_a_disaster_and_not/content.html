You do seem to have more swelling than average but if you had wound separation I can imagine it would take longer to go down?
</p>
<p>
I had noticeable external swelling for 3-4 months after surgery and an enlarged/swollen clit for at least 6 months.
</p>
<p>
On the whole ball-bag-labia thing, that is something I was majorly worried about too but it is something which will (very slowly) improve. I am a year post op now and it has taken that entire time for the skin to tighten up.
</p>
<p>
Also as a more general point, my advice to girls going for surgery would be that you should
<em>
expect
</em>
to hate your result for at least a little while. It takes a long ass time for everything to settle and for things to look good.

I think we see too many posts at one year.  If I turn out ok, I want more women to see these kinds of posts and know it&#39;s ok to be disgusting after two months.
</p>
<p>
Very experienced people have said that there&#39;s nothing out of the ordinary, it&#39;s just going slow.  That&#39;s helping a little.  Emotionally, this is hell.  Not much helps, lol.
</p>
<p>
And bc of wound separation, icing, walking, and compression were more difficult.  I also had medication that increases edema, and a higher initial inflammation.
</p>
<p>
Thank you ☺️

You had clit swelling that eventually went down?
</p>
<p>
I just passed 4 weeks post and it’s something I’ve been concerned with ever since my surgeon told me a few days post-op that I had swelling in my clitoris but “that’ll go away in time” but couldn’t give a timeline cause... well swelling is hard to predict after all.

Yep! It felt like a marble under the skin for absolutely ages. Initially I thought that was just size of the clit but then I noticed one day (maybe at around 8-9 months?) that it was a lot smaller and I couldn’t feel any sort of lump under the skin any more.

Don&#39;t stress out. Even in the worst case, labiaplasty is
<strong>
way
</strong>
easier than fixing anything on the inside. If everything is functioning then everything else is very very fixable, and tbh, 6 weeks is wayyyyy too soon to know anything

I don&#39;t think you should worry about this too much. Its a hassle, but excess tissue is easily revised. Suporn in Thailand tends to excess tissue on on purpose so that it can be revised, and his patients have heaps of revisions - it&#39;s when you&#39;re lacking it you have a problem.

I went back and looked at how I was fairing 6 weeks out when I had my surgery. You&#39;re looking pretty good imo. It&#39;ll need more time - I know it&#39;s hard day-to-day, but patience is key.

If I come out ok, I want people to see the 4-8 week marks.  We usually see the first few, and then bam, four+ months.
</p>
<p>
Feeling normal helps with the patience.  But it&#39;s hard when most of what I&#39;ve seen from others has been different

I can fully appreciate your current dismay at the results.  Let the healing finish, and if you&#39;re really unhappy with your surgeon, see if there is another who can do a cosmetic correction.

I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m unhappy with my surgeon, it seems most don&#39;t have much involvement after it&#39;s over.  And the surgeon is very good.  I would take any random result.  I think I just got very unlucky.
</p>
<p>
The only way I would go with someone else for a revision is if the surgeon tried to say it&#39;s normal or that all vaginas are different.  No vagina looks like this, none.
</p>
<p>
And as far as being told to wait for a revision, it just makes things worse.  It&#39;s not possible to live a normal life like this, and thinking that could last 6-12 months more is devastating.
</p>
<p>
So personally, I would save mentioning a revision for people who ask, what can I do about this or if a revision is possible.
</p>
<p>
Thanks :)

I have been told to wait at least 6 months before thinking of another surgery, lets be patient, are you walking enough? Also try to gently massage the area

Please don&#39;t massage the area. They tell you really not to fool around until the surgeon give you the go ahead.
</p>
<p>
Mine looked like a nightmare at 6 week. Now it looks more or less fine. I&#39;ll get a revision when things open back up, but not anything like I thought I would need.
</p>
<p>
Just relax and follow the surgeons post op care instructions. Everything will get sorted out in time and you can make any revision decisions when the time for that comes.

Very good. I just don&#39;t think massage is a good idea until the surgeon give you the all clear for more touching.
</p>
<p>
I just want to fix a bit of asymmetry in my labia majora and also get an anterior commissure.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s part of the reason I choose Suporn Clinic because the revision is included.

If I got to the point where the commissure was my concern, I&#39;ll be thrilled.

Also, I thought usually it was the posterior one that was usually lacking.

Labia minora has a seperate issue on one side, I also want the anterior commissure that Suporn clinic does.
</p>
<p>
And good luck with your healing! Honestly I wish I had more pronounced labia majora, so yours might look amazing in a few months or a year.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get to a better place in healing soon enough :)

I&#39;ve talked through my depression with a friend.  I want a new job, and I want a bf.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t leave my current job bc I&#39;d need to stay for the insurance.  And I don&#39;t feel comfortable dating looking this way.
</p>
<p>
The stress and anxiety from working a job I don&#39;t like, with the pain of not having love for another year, is what has me distraught.  Not the actual vulva (though I still think it&#39;s gross right now).
</p>
<p>
Thinking of what my real problems are, rather than blaming it on a 6 week vag, has helped some.  I can think of other solutions.
</p>
<p>
But you and everyone who&#39;ve said that it&#39;s normal for where they were, helped even more, thanks again

As others say, have patience.  I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re not getting more support from Dr. Wittenberg and her team.  Are you doing the 3-month follow-up in person?

Yes, I will
</p>
<p>
Again, this isn&#39;t meant to call out my surgeon.  I&#39;ve heard other stories of people whose surgeon never saw them again.  The staff and Dr Wittenberg are very patient and supportive up until it&#39;s time to wait for things to heal.
</p>
<p>
They don&#39;t photograph or monitor between week 3 and week 12.  But if they did have pics of this time period, that&#39;s something that could help.  This is not what I believed was normal.
</p>
<p>
Again, them not helping during this time doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not good.  Just as they state, contact your obgyn, or pcp.  I did, and they have no clue if it&#39;s ok or not.  So there isn&#39;t anyone I can go to.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I get the impression that they don&#39;t understand dysphoria or the struggles with not being able to have a normal life bc of a physical defect.  This is getting off the point a bit, but it&#39;s probably why I get the impression they&#39;re not concerned with the aesthetics until 12 months.  Some of the things that have come up show that they see our issues from a cis perspective, and that hurts.

From what I&#39;ve heard, even trans surgeons like McGinn don&#39;t necessarily have the best empathy for their patients.  I do understand that the external appearance changes a ton from 2-3 months to 1 year, and that they don&#39;t want to prejudge the results, but at the same time I&#39;d think they would also understand that we haven&#39;t been through this process all the time like they are, and that it&#39;s our bodies going through this.
</p>
<p>
Are things better for you now in terms of emotional and practical support?

No, I had all the support I needed and then had to move, and the pandemic hit.  Plus I went stealth.  One person stuck through things practically, but is worse on me emotionally.
</p>
<p>
Going into BA will be different, since you don&#39;t have to be be trans for that.  I can depend more on my new friends.

If you want to DM me I&#39;ll tell you about what sort of issues I faced with mozaic, since you&#39;ll be going there.  But I still recommend her fully.  I mean, my favorite steakhouse once brought me a burned ribeye.  Things happen.

You are healing very nicely, tbh. I looked much worse at 5 weeks. At 13 weeks I look much better. Don&#39;t panic yet. Speedy recovery!

I&#39;m still healing. The definition of the
<em>
good
</em>
result is very subjective. There are results published on surgeons&#39; websites showing their work. Realself may also be a good source.

Okay, I&#39;ve not had surgery, but I did see a lot of Vs when i got into my aunt&#39;s gynaec books.  My first thought when I looked at it(i took a look before i read anything here) was it looks like an outie vagina..  I come back read about the timeline and swelling, I suspect it&#39;s the swelling and the once that heals and goes down, you&#39;ll get a better judgement at it. I wouldn&#39;t feel too pessimistic yet, and wait a while for complete healing..

If my inner labia remain this way, but the outer went down, yeah, I&#39;d say it&#39;s an outie.  That&#39;s referring to whether the labia minora are longer or shorter than the majora.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not the best angle for showing projection, but the outer labia project away from the body substantially, from start to end.  They should be level with outside the vulva and gradually build up.
</p>
<p>
And it&#39;s not swelling, bc I can depress the area with a finger and it&#39;s empty.  This is just from having tons of detached skin.
</p>
<p>
I can understand being behind in healing, but it&#39;s been this way for a month.  I should be seeing improvement, but I&#39;m not.  Which to me indicates that I&#39;m close to the final result and just got a baboon vag :(
</p>

Thank you for your input ☺️

You are very far from the final result. Take walks like 1 mile every day. It is healthy for your recovery. It improves blood circulation, let nerves recover, and reduce swelling.

I am walking every day now.  I had been walking around my apartment the first four weeks.
</p>
<p>
With the wound separation and swelling, it was too painful to walk outside, in case I couldn&#39;t get back.  But once that went down, I started walking 15-20 mins 3x daily.
</p>
<p>
A few times a week, I go on longer walks to improve stamina, and bc walking is no longer an issue.  It hasn&#39;t improved anything yet, but I will keep going.
</p>
<p>
Ty.  I was also surprised you thought yours looked worse at this point.  If you have a pic you don&#39;t mind dming me, I&#39;d like to understand better what others looked like at 5-7 weeks.

I&#39;m sorry for what happened, but it seems you&#39;re still positive.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask if your swelling was more severe or prolonged?
</p>
<p>
Did you have above average size before surgery or hormones? I have a weird theory that they underestimated how much my tissue was used to expanding and that could be the culprit.
</p>
<p>
What did they do for the revision? Did it help at all and did any doctor ever tell you why yours came out that way?

Dr won&#39;t let me put any creams on the scars 😒

The ball sacky is the worst part.  I seriously expect to find a leftover testicle on one side.  People keep saying it tightens up but I still haven&#39;t seen one like mine that turned out normal.  For now I&#39;m trying to take everyone&#39;s word for it.

Hi, sweetie.  I&#39;m assuming that you have no problems dilating at this point?  While everyone&#39;s vagina looks different (neo or natural), I have certainly seen first hand vaginas looking similar to yours with the excess skin.  Of course that is not to minimize your unhappiness aesthetically; what concerns me the most is the lack of support from the doctor.  He should be offering at least some level of support or options.
</p>
<p>
Have you thought about contacting another surgeon about revision or any other options?  I&#39;m not sure what good an OB/GYN would do just right now other than routine yearly checks.  I remember I had a little fissure at the bottom end (the &#34;chin rest&#34; are as I affectionally call it), but my surgeon told me that it was normal because that are takes a beating with the dilation schedule.  Cleared up in no time.  I remember although I was ecstatic right after surgery (especially when my bladder came back from vacation), I was a little freaked out with the appearance at first.  As long as everything is working the way it should, that is a good thing, yes?  :-)
</p>
<p>
How are you doing emotionally?  I am a doctoral candidate in psychology with a specialization in behavioral analysis, and although counseling is not my forte, any time that you would like to talk please let me know.
</p>

It looks like a poor result to me too, but like the others, give it some time.  On the positive side, it does look like it’s healing well.  Most of the problem seems to be too much outer labia skin.  That should be an easy fix.  The rest may fall into place over time.

What criteria are you using for your determination?  Because I&#39;ve been through this with many confused people who leave pissed off because they end up backed into a corner when they answer.

You&#39;re the least sane person I&#39;ve seen on this thread. I hope that you get the help that you need, maybe see a therapist to fix whatever is wrong with you. If everyone else is telling you that you&#39;re wrong, and you&#39;re not listening, then clearly you&#39;re the insane one.

Rule 3. Report trolls and hate speech. Do not engage, let the mods take care of it. Arguing with trolls encourages them and makes moderation more difficult.

True but I do hope to at least encourage some of these folks to see some clue stick.  You are right that 99% of the time it doesn&#39;t work and wastes your time.  Sorry!

You are saying you wonder what a man&#39;s penis looks like after this surgery.  This was never a man&#39;s penis.  It was a woman&#39;s penis.  The distinction is very important in a sub called TRANSGENDER_surgeries.  Come on.
