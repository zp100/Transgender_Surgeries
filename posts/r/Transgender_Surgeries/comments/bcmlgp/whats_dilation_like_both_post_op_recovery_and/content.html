Whatâ€™s dilation like, both post op recovery and long term?

Iâ€™m getting GCS next month and was curious about this. Iâ€™m prepared for it to be pretty painful for the first few weeks after, but I was also curious how the long term is for this. A common concern I see pop up is that people are afraid of the lifelong commitment to dilating, but from what I understand, isnâ€™t it just 2-3 times a week for like 10-15 min a session (with penetrative sex counting towards that) once youâ€™re completely healed? The lifelong commitment doesnâ€™t sound any worse than my lifelong commitment to shave my legs or brush my teeth, just another basic hygiene step that needs to be done a couple times a week (if Iâ€™m not sexually active).
</p>
<p>
Are these expectations accurate, or is dilation worse than I realize?
</p>
<p>
Edit: Iâ€™m having mine done with the peritoneal penile inversion technique if that makes any difference. I heard dilation is slightly less needed with this method, but assumed it would still be mostly similar.

Yea I definitely didnâ€™t think it would be fun, but does needing to dilate in the long term feel like a significant impact, or does it feel more like a minor annoyance?

It&#39;s a necessary annoyance. It gets less painful over time. If you&#39;re consistent with session times it gets easier. Annoying when you have to plan each day around it.

That makes sense. So you have to do it daily right now, and how long since you got the surgery if you donâ€™t mind me asking?

How painful was it at first? And roughly how long before the sessions didnâ€™t hurt too badly?

Thanks, this actually sounds like what I expected it to be like. My schedule is super similar to this, 3 times a day for the first 8 weeks, the twice a day for the following 8 weeks, #3 and #4 for sizes after building up to it (canâ€™t remember how soon after post op, but I think a few weeks or so). Thatâ€™s interesting to hear about the sex part, Iâ€™ll ask my surgeon about it. Do you think once a week, even if it is for the rest of your life, will be that bad though?

Good point, Iâ€™m not looking forward to it obviously, but hoping it doesnâ€™t feel like more than a minor pain in the long run ðŸ˜¬

Yea recovery sounds pretty awful. Iâ€™m super dysphoric about my downstairs parts so itâ€™s definitely not something thatâ€™s making me reconsider even getting the surgery but still yikes... and itâ€™s good that itâ€™s a temporary issue, but sorry you have to deal with that.

Feels like dilation is quite heavy on many other doctors around the world. Here in Finland the surgery technique is made to make the dilation less required, if I recall correctly. I don&#39;t remember the details of it, but the dilation is started 1 month after surgery, and was probably like once a day for few months. I remember reading experiences that around after a year most people had stopped dilating, and occasional sex or whatever was enough. I&#39;ve yet to experience this personally tho, just couple more months to wait..

For me, dilation was twice a day for thirty minutes, and then gradually backing off that to where I&#39;m at now which is twice a week, half hour at a time. That&#39;s definitely been enough to get to the largest size dilator.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, it&#39;s just another chore. It&#39;s never really hurt, although moving up sizes was uncomfortable.

I just had peritoneal penile inversion with Bluebond-Langner last Thursday, and have been dilating for several days now. I don&#39;t have the most experience with it yet, but I can definitely speak to the immense timesuck it is at first.
</p>
<p>
My schedule right now is 15 minutes 4x/day. I&#39;ve settled into doing it around 6-7AM, 12PM, 4-5PM, and 8-10PM, with douche and shower around 11AM. I know it sounds like a lot already, but it turns out to be a LOT MORE than it sounds. It is a marathon and a more-than-full-time job.
</p>
<p>
That 15 minutes quickly becomes 45 minutes to an hour once you figure everything in: putting down pads, gathering supplies, taking the time to insert the dilator, cleaning your body, and cleaning up the site. This is in addition to the routine wound care (douching, washing, ointments, etc). Add to this that you&#39;ll start immediately after getting discharged from the hospital, while you&#39;re still sore and achy head-to-toe with limited mobility...it&#39;s rough. Doable, but rough. Have a good support system in place, especially for those first few weeks.
</p>
<p>
Painwise, it doesn&#39;t really hurt in my case. Some people have complications that lead to painful dilation, but if everything goes smoothly it&#39;s painless. I&#39;m keeping a log on a throwaway account, and you can see what dilating looks like on day one in the links from
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/bav18q/level_up_sounds_4_days_post_mtf_srs_with_dr/ekmx1x9/?context=3" rel="nofollow">this comment</a>
. I know, I know, it looks so painful! But aside from some stretching and squeezing, there&#39;s not any pain. Probably because the nerves are still figuring themselves out in there, lol.

I&#39;m glad you find it helpful! I&#39;m going to try doing a post every week, with pictures, updates on mobility, etc, and AMA. I was frustrated by the lack of info on my surgeon, so I&#39;m doing what I can to fill that void in :)

Dilation was initially *incredibly* painful for me. I&#39;m going to skip details because I don&#39;t want to scare you, and I was in the minority, and, after two months, this pain finally reduced to what appears more typical for other trans women, where it&#39;s more &#34;intensely uncomfortable&#34; rather than tear-inducingly painful.
</p>
<p>
Each session of dilation is 30 minutes, split between 2-3 dilators. Each session requires setup. Each dilator takes a few minutes to lube up and work in before I &#34;start the clock&#34;. And the each session requires clean-up. I take just under an hour per session.
</p>
<p>
Initially, when I was dilating four times a day and still exhausted from surgery, my life was eat-sleep-dilate-repeat. Now I&#39;m down to three times a day (once when I wake up, once after work, once before bed) and back to working, it&#39;s still a huge time commitment in my life. I&#39;m looking forwards to hitting my six-month mark when I can hopefully reduce dilation to twice a day.
</p>
<p>
Even when this drops to twice a week, I don&#39;t spend two hours a week shaving my legs or brushing my teeth. Dilation is a BIG commitment.
</p>
<p>
That said, removing genital dysphoria is totally worth that commitment.
