Hello everyone,
</p>
<p>
I am from the Czech Republic and last November I had a genital reconstruction surgery (scrotal skin graft) in Brno with Dr Jiří Veselý and the results are just terrible. I am not even going to talk about aesthetics because there&#39;s no such here, but I have a bunch of other problems which need to be solved and apparently here, in the Czech Republic, the plastic surgery is quite backwards when it comes to this type of surgeries. I tried to go for a lawysuit and get reimbursement but the lawyer and the forensic doctor said it&#39;s a lost case and I better use my money for a revision abroad.
</p>
<p>
Generally, I would need labiaplasty and correction of the clitoris since I am a lesbian and I don&#39;t really care about depth (which is 7 cm at best in my case), That said, to me the aesthetics is of an utmost importance, along with sensitivity. Another issue is a huge clitoris which is more or less a penis head left almost as it was, and additionally, incontinence issues.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen a lot of good feedback here from people who had their surgeries in Lubos Klinik in Munich so I would like be very grateful if you can provide me detailed feedback.
</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance!
