Like I feel like it would be the most painful thing ever. How does it compare to laser/electrolysis for your face?

I&#39;ve had it done on my face and the genitals. I&#39;d say it&#39;s around the same as the face, a little less painful. The only part that was borderline unbearable for me was around some scar tissue on the scrotum from my orchiectomy.

It&#39;s been a
<em>
long
</em>
time (decades) since I did laser in the &#34;Brazilian&#34; areas, but it wasn&#39;t as bad as other places I had done at that time: arms, back, chest, face (which was the worst).
</p>
<p>
A couple of years ago, I went to a place that used the Soprano Ice to do chest and back again and it was almost completely painless. The technology had
<strong>
really
</strong>
improved. If you can find one of those lasers, I&#39;d bet genitals would be a breeze.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I&#39;m also doing electrolysis for face now because of all my gray.
<strong>
THAT
</strong>
hurts like an SOB.

Far less painful than the face.  Haven&#39;t done electrolysis.

Yeah.  It’s not fun, and some parts are a lot more sensitive than others, but overall easier than the face.

My facial electrolysis was rather painful without injections. Especially under the lip and on the neck. I had lidocaine injections for my SRS electro. The injections sucked, but the electrolysis itself wasn’t too bad. Get injections for that area.

Laser, weirdly, hurts more, but that&#39;s me. I don&#39;t have a super great system for dealing with pain there yet.
</p>
<p>
Electro isn&#39;t that bad in my experience. I lidocaine (4%) up about 1:30 beforehand, then 600mg of Advil 45 minutes before. Then you basically just feel hair being plucked.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve only done laser on the face, and it&#39;s a bit worse downstairs. Both are painful, unfortunately.

I’ve done both for electrolysis and personally thought face was more painful. I can’t tolerate anything on face wo injections. Some genital areas I can handle with only emla cream

I&#39;m having it done for SRS right now and
<em>
holyfuckingshit
</em>
it hurts so bad in some areas.  I&#39;m on a mix of two different numbing creams, up to 15mg norco, and 800mg of ibuprofen.  The worst part is the skin on the pubic bone, by far.
</p>
<p>
Still though, worth it to yeetus this peenus

Scheduled for June, contingent on the hair being clear.  I&#39;m going twice a week for 2 hours at a time, but it&#39;s slow going because I&#39;m sensitive T_T

It&#39;s supposed to take 6 months to a year, depending on how often and how long you can go for.  4 cycles of hair growth at the minimum.

I&#39;m not sure about laser, but I did genital electro and it hurt like hell. I&#39;ve been doing laser on my face for two years and it&#39;s always been tolerable, but pre-surgical electro on my genitals was painful as fuck.

Less painful than the face, so long as you can get them to ice it before zapping. I&#39;ve also had electrolysis down there without numbing creme for a two hour session... That was pretty bad, and it left me sore down there for a while. It was worse for some hairs more than others, like there were more nerves attached to some, I think.

I&#39;m getting my brazilian area done now (I&#39;m post-op) and was surprised that newer lasers are nearly pain free. I&#39;m having it done with the LightSheer Desire.
