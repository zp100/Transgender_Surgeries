It seems that I am in the minority of patients that suffer with a lot of pain after GRS, specifically vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Had a morphene PCA for 12 hours after the spinal block wore off and was then expected to manage with paracetamol and ibuprofen.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say I have been in agony until on day 13 I got hold of some oromorph (oral morphene liquid). Only taking an average dose and I feel like a different women. I have managed to sit up in bed and eat properly for the first time without being on my side. I actual feel alive again and it doesnt hurt üòÅ
</p>
<p>
I would love to know what pain meds you were given after surgery or what you had to do to cope with the pain?
</p>
<p>
Was your surgeon or care team understanding or did you have to fight for pain relief ?
</p>
<p>

<strong>
<em>
Update
</em>
</strong>
**&#34; After I posted this my doctor got back to me and prescribed Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain in my femoral nerves. Paracetamol and ibuprofen are not effective at treating this pain. Probably caused by being stretched, im quite small 62kg and 5ft7 so probably a bit too much of a delicate waif. Could explain my particular issue though, not much muscle or padding to protect the area. She said it could take months to heal and I may need physio if I&#39;m still having difficulty walking.
</p>
<p>
**
<strong>
<em>
Update a week later
</em>
</strong>
** I&#39;m updating this just in case it shows up in a search later. The Amitriptyline is working for the nerve pain but now I also have wound dehiscence / stitches at the base of the wound are coming apart and it&#39;s painful to move, toilet and dilate. Doctor phone appointment again and I have now also been prescribed Tramadol. I don&#39;t think she has seen the result of SRS before and wants a look on Monday ha ha fair enough. I said I would make an appointment if the pain meds work.

It varies depending on the surgeon. Some don‚Äôt have any problem giving out strong painkillers.
</p>
<p>
Personally I would avoid any surgeon that refused to prescribe strong painkillers when needed, and speaking of which would you mind naming yours.
</p>
<p>
I think you‚Äôve been mistreated.

Thankyou for your reply.
</p>
<p>
I will not be naming them here as other than the pain their work is the best that I have seen and it looks amazing... As in if the stitches were not there it would look like I was born with it and it&#39;s been less than two weeks.
</p>
<p>
I will however be contacting my doctor today to get a prescription for something and writing a letter to the surgeon and hospital after my next checkup in a month.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking what others were given, so that I can pass it on to my doctor and include it in the letter.

They know what drugs are available, it‚Äôs all standard stuff. Some surgeons, and even more so, some countries are against painkillers.
</p>
<p>
Some people are luckily and don‚Äôt get much pain post-op and some suffer horribly for months afterwards. I‚Äôve read enough such stories that it‚Äôs one of the criteria I have for surgeons. No way I want to find out too late I‚Äôm one of the unlucky ones.

During my time in the PACU I was given a tiny amount of fentanyl, but it did nothing for my pain. Other than that I was on strictly 5mg oxycodone every six hours for the first two days then as needed for the remainder of the stay. On the fourth day of my stay I took half a tablet (2.5mg) of oxycodone for catheter pain but it did little for the pain.
</p>
<p>
When I was discharged, my surgeon gave me a few 5mg oxycodone tablets and a dozen 100mg gabapentin. Other than that it has just been acetaminophen and ibuprofen. They don&#39;t do refills on the opioids, maybe the gabapentin but probably not. Getting another prescription for the latter two is useless as I can get them OTC with much less hassle.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just over a week post-op and I have to say the pain can be excruciating.

Thank you for your reply. Sorry to hear you are in pain and hope you feel better soon X
</p>
<p>
Just in case you haven&#39;t tried... When laying down put a pillow under your knees. Also a cool pack on the inner thigh / femoral nerve (that&#39;s where my worst pain is). Standing in the shower letting warm water flow over it / I don&#39;t have a bath, bath would probably be nicer.
</p>
<p>
Lots of hugs xx

The pain can be exhausting, and it can also make dilating much more difficult, but I knew what I signed up for. NYU is extremely stringent about narcotics (I was only given IV pain meds in the PACU, once I was moved into my hospital room it was strictly pills).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve found that just sitting down with my feet up and leaned back so all the weight is on my butt is the most comfortable. It&#39;s how I&#39;ve spent most of my time since surgery, even while I was in the hospital‚ÄìI found the reclining chair next to my bed more comfortable than the bed itself.
</p>
<p>
Bath is probably not a great idea, at least for a few weeks until your incisions heal. That&#39;s what my surgeon told me anyway.

i know this sounds daft cos obviously fentanyl is hugely powerful but it might be worth trying ibuprofen on top of it.  for period pains, it is literally the only thing that stops a particular sort of pain (i say this as someone on a lot of strong prescription opiates too)
</p>
<p>
but yeah the mechanism of it being a muscle relaxant adds to it. you maybe already tried it but if not, give it a go together, and keep a regular regimen of it- i can have pain free periods only off i take it regularly- if i give the muscles a chance to start cramping, it sets off a domino effect.
</p>
<p>
maybe take some of you wake up in the night when you‚Äôre body is still a bit more relaxed, have some and then top up when you wake up in four hours.
</p>
<p>
if you can get a good thing going with this, it‚Äôs gonna be really helpful because getting too friendly with fentanyl is not what you need rn, or ever

I was only given fentanyl in the PACU, once. Otherwise the only opioid I was given was oxycodone. Which I haven&#39;t touched since 2 days post-op.
</p>
<p>
I take a lot of ibuprofen, it&#39;s the most effective painkiller I am taking (gabapentin is a short second with acetaminophen a distant third).

i dont know that last one you mentioned.
</p>
<p>
hows your stomach do on the ibuprofen?
</p>
<p>
buscopan is another one ppl take for period pain - its more a stomach ache thing, but its another of those drugs where the exact mechanism isnt known, weirdly- but its a very chill drug in terms of effects/side effects
</p>
<p>
having no had any such surgery i cannot give direct experience tips , but being as all those muscles and areas are connected, something that settles the stomach may help, even just as a break from taking too much of on thing or the other, and as a pretty mild  drug, is probably worth a go, in working out a regimen that works

<p>
also careful with the gabapentin- i was spredcribed it for my back, took i daily for a month and it didn‚Äôt do anything so i stopped- big mistake, horrible withdrawals that were similar to benzodiazepine withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
they are designed for nerves and epilepsy after all.
</p>
<p>
so yeah, if you have a script on that, careful how you come down- half it, then half it again, taper for a few weeks and don‚Äôt let yourself run out cold, without an amount to taper down.

Nerve pain is exactly why my surgeon prescribed it. There is quite a lot of nerve pain as the tissue heals and the nerves begin firing again. NYU only provides you with a dozen tablets, enough to last less than a week post discharge so titrating down slowly is impossible.

Former medic, current hospital admin staff, sufferer of chronic pain. I have OPINIONS on this question.
</p>
<p>
First up: I think your surgeon did you very wrong here. Expecting people to go to OTC painkillers like that so early after major surgery seems nuts. Even after dental surgery, most places will give you a couple days of hardier stuff. GRS isn&#39;t exactly a wisdom tooth. Now, it&#39;s absolutely worth it to try and keep the dosage of things like trancatives and opiates limited, you don&#39;t want people to get addicted, but heavy duty short term pain is literally what those things are FOR.
</p>
<p>
Counterpoint: pain management is a hard beast. Some people are more pain tolerant than others. Some people get nearly no relief from opioids. Heck, there are folk tales backed by science that your hair colour can be linked to needing extra pain relief. But there are so many other options than just plain old over-the-counter NSAIDs (including paracetamol/acetominaphen and ibuprofen.) And everyone reacts differently to different medications - I could theoretically take something and it&#39;d feel like tictacs, while you&#39;d be passed out and floaty. Or vice versa.
</p>
<p>
To answer your question, GRS Montreal&#39;s protocol: Acetominaphen (base NSAID painkiller), Celebrex (another painkiller, COX2 type), Pregabalin (Neuropathic pain relaxer), automatically. They openly told you not to be a hero, and gave out Tramadol (a synthetic opioid) for pain spikes.
</p>
<p>
That said, it was crap for me, I was in agony. I went back onto my standard back pain painkillers on day 2 and they were so much better for me even though they weren&#39;t opiates... because I&#39;d already gone through the trial-and-error phase with my regular GP. So I recovered primarily on Meloxicam.
</p>
<p>
I will mention that your doctor&#39;s use of Amitryptylene for neuropathic pain is interesting - Absolutely valid, but interesting. It&#39;s primarily an antidepressant, and it does boost the effect of NSAIDs generally (so keep taking the para and ibu next to it), but its direct effect on neuro pain is limited. That said, it&#39;s part of my personal emergency pain relief mix, and it helps me. I hope it does for you too. But if you find it&#39;s not doing the trick, don&#39;t be afraid to ask for something more suited to you. Again, everyone&#39;s pain relief works differently. Aaaand again... the lowest dosage that makes it tolerable for you is what you want. The fewer painkillers you can get away with the better.
</p>
<p>
I will add, pelvic physiotherapy is a huge thing that&#39;s being recommended more and more. I have a friend who went to it and she swears by it.

Apologies I missed this reply, thank you for taking the time :)
</p>
<p>
You mentioned hair colour ? I have natural red hair and have read some studies that conclude that red heads feel more pain and some can require up to 20 percent more anastetic to go under properly. Wish I had known this before or that the staff actually listened to me.
</p>
<p>
Also the neuropathic pain.. I&#39;m sure I read that if it is treated quickly then recovery is faster, something to do with brain chemistry going crazy receiving constant pain signals over a long period makes it worse ?

I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve heard anything specific about neuropathic pain, but I believe it. All pain is a trauma, and long-term pain you can&#39;t do anything about suuuuuuuuucks. I can say for sure that I&#39;ve had some instances where pain has made me partly insane myself.
</p>
<p>

Hopefully your pain has receded now? At least to the point that tylenol *is* cutting it?

Well it is only uncomfortable now (rather than painful) when laying still and feels like I have large stones under the skin In my bum / leg crease so I suppose that is better than it was before.
</p>
<p>
Walking any distance is impossible due to the pain, 0.5k and I have to stop. Amitriptyline is making me dizzy and I&#39;m running out of Tramadol so just given up and staying horizontal unless I need the toilet or food. I wish I had the catheter back in if I&#39;m honest. I&#39;m just trying to keep dilating it so it doesn&#39;t get worse.
</p>
<p>
Physio is meant to be contacting me but I&#39;m not holding my breath with COVID etc.

I understand. If I&#39;m reading this right that you&#39;re at about 6-8 weeks, I was still in quite a lot of pain at that point myself, but you&#39;ll likely show some improvement pretty soon. Dilating is an utter chore, but it gets better from here.

My care team was quite serious about pain management. I came out of recovery in agony primarily from bladder spasms with the catheter.
</p>
<p>
My spinal wore off while I was still in recovery. I had been told it would keep me pain free from the waist down for the first 24 hours. Nope.
</p>
<p>
I got ibuprofen, Tylenol, OxyContin, and dilaudid for as long as I needed it. I quit the Dilaudid two days post and quit the OxyContin when I was discharged five days post-op. I also quit the Tylenol because that garbage is as useless as a screen door on a submarine. That left me with ibuprofen, which I use PRN for a previous cervical spinal injury anyway.
</p>
<p>
I quit ibuprofen this past Tuesday to see how I‚Äôd manage. So far, I have pain at my wound site and nerve pain, but it‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt handle.
</p>
<p>
N.B. They also tried to give me gabapentin for nerve pain, but I rejected that bizarre shit straight out. I‚Äôve seen family members on it and their response was truly bizarre. Turned them into stumbling, falling down idiots. No thanks.
</p>
<p>
I hope you get relief, and soon. Pain, as I used to tell juries, is a seat at a picture window into Hell. You have to self-advocate. Unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
All this is a function of the lack of standardization in Trans Medicine. To one degree or another, we are all Guinea Pigs.

My doctor just got back to me and prescribed Amitriptyline to try before gabapentin. Hopefully it does the trick.

Seconding caution towards Gabapentin. I had a neurologist who&#39;s only solution to a crippling pain problem was to just up the dose on this to obscene amounts... I still wonder if that&#39;s what caused my social anxiety that I then had for about 15 years, that snapped off again just as suddenly as it started.

I was given gabapentin acetaminophen and ibuprofen. I also had opeoids available too but didn&#39;t need them. My pain tolerance is extremely high though so I didn&#39;t need much more than that. Everyone&#39;s threshold is different so don&#39;t beat yourself up too much over it. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re in such pain and I hope it subsides soon. Immediately after surgery it really helped for me to lay down with my legs propped up on something to take pressure off my groin.

I was given morphine and fentanyl during surgery, fentanyl via IV in the recovery area, oxycodone and ibuprofen pills during my 1 night in the hospital, and sent home with prescriptions including oxycodone and gabapentin. I was totally off the oxy at 10 days, and managed pain with only ibuprofen and tylenol from then on. Stayed on the gabapentin as needed for 2-3 months for nerve pain.

Thankyou for your reply. Good to know that the nerve pain resolved after a few months.

Yeah, the nerve pain gradually became less frequent until eventually it was so rare, I stopped needing the gabapentin. Nerve pain did flare back up a bit when I went back to work, probably because my job involves a lot of standing and moving around. But went away again after a few weeks of being back at work.
</p>
<p>
Sidenote that at one point I got a UTI and didnt realize it for several days because the gabapentin was also blocking the pain from that.

After a morphine drip immediately post-op, Paracetamol and Ibuprofen was all I was given in hospital and continued to use at home for a couple of weeks after - due to some severe granulation.

Yes I was the first 3 days it was horrible 9/10 on a scale (since renal colic is a 9/10 from what I know and I had one a few years back I can definitely say it was as bad for me)
</p>
<p>
Also yes I helped definitely I hadn&#39;t felt any pain down there since then.

Was this a uk surgeon? If so I think I know the one and with them in January. This is my biggest anxiety at moment knowing this is what&#39;s offered. Others said they were fine with it but I have sensory issues and low pain tolerance.

‚Äúminority‚Äù?  they said it‚Äôs a minority? sounds like they are being shits about prescription because how on earth a vaginoplasty wouldn‚Äôt hurt‚Ä¶ not to mention everyone has at least ‚Äúdiscomfort‚Äù dialating

I spoke to one of the girls in hospital that had the op a day before me. She seemed to be dealing with it a lot better than me but she had surgery several times before and was not at all worried.
</p>
<p>
Honestly it just made me feel pathetic crying myself to sleep, like what the hell is wrong with me. Really not a nice frame of mind to be in on top of the post surgery depression it&#39;s a good job the windows only opened 6 inches.

some people just have a lot of luck with their nerve positioning, also state of mind can have a lot to do with it and some people will get a big high- and also some people will talk it down in a mind over matter thing, or trying to make you feel better yourself by showing you that they are okay so you‚Äôll be okay too.
</p>
<p>
which when you‚Äôre feeling very sensitive after a big thing like this, had the opposite effect to that.
</p>
<p>
it is an insanely big surgery and it is no failing from you to be in pain.
</p>
<p>
God, if you can‚Äôt be in pain after that then when can you?
</p>
<p>
have a look at my comments elsewhere on here just now, might be handy

Sorry to hear you had such a bad time, i guess it really is different for everyone, i had peno-scrotal vaginoplasty with bellringer, i had surgery only with spinal and a sedative, no general anaesthetic. I was first surgery on a saturday morning, blockers wore off mid afternoon, i didnt take any pain killers until that night when a burning sensation was keeping me awake so i took a shot of the morphine that was already there. didnt use anything else except occasional paracetamol after that which relieved the soreness where i pulled a few stitches, no real pain to speak of otherwise as long as i kept still. moving could be painful sometimes in the first week, but after a couple of days i could walk about fine and sit in a padded chair, by two weeks i could drive for an hour or more, by the third week i was back to my regular routines.
