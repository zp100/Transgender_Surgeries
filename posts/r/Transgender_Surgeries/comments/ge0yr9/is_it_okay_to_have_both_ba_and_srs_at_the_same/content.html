Lots of people do this.
</p>
<p>
Upside: get two things done in one go.
</p>
<p>
Downside: the recovery sucks that much more.

Lots of surgeons will do a BA at the same time as GCS. So yes they are done one right after another while under anesthesia on the same date.

In some cases, you can have the BA done at the same time as GCS so that your OR time is not prolonged, i.e. one doctor doing BA while the other does GCS.

I had ffs and under muscle ba at the same time. It sucked pretty bad because I was not allowed to lift my arms.  I guess it&#39;s even harder with srs. You for sure will need a lot of help the first week(s) post surgery. Getting over muscle implants would make recovery from ba a lot easier. At least my surgeon told me so

I had BA, over muscle, done 10 days after my GRS and it went just fine. It hurt a lot and I could barely move the first couple days, but after that it gets much easier. You&#39;ll definitely want someone to help you with everything.

I had BA and GCS two days apart in March of this year. Honestly the BA recovery is really minimal compared to GCS. The first few weeks are a bit rough because you don’t have much upper or lower body strength and getting up/sitting down can be rough. The upside is that you can get all your recovery done at once and you get to enjoy a pretty major transformation of your body in a short time. I chose this to limit the amount of time I’d have to take off work and because I have good insurance right now (and who knows when that would change)?

Rule of thumb: the fewer times you have to go under general anesthesia the better.
</p>
<p>
Each time you go under makes it trickier for the anesthesiologist to manage since folks often change their reactions to the anesthetics with repeated exposure.

It depends on where you go. For example Kaiser will absolutely not do both at the same time and you have to wait at least 3 months in between.

I had SRS + BA done at the same time and my recovery was fine, it’s a bit harder but as long as you’ve got someone to help you during recovery you’ll be fine.

I can only imagine it’s a lot and will be demanding on your caretakers. That said, if you can manage it I think it would be great to get knocked out and wake up with the right parts :)

I’m scheduled for both. Now let’s hope they don’t cancel a third time.

Tnx! One thing I was told that I found interesting was that my breasts will probably hurt way more than my bottom surgery. Like an elephant sitting on my chest my dr said.

I don’t see why not? Seems smart tbh. You’ll save time, money, &amp; effort by doing two surgeries at the same time under one anesthesia. One stop shopping &amp; win win I’d say. I’ve heard of many people, especially trans girls undergoing both grs/srs (or orchiectomy) &amp; breast implants in a one day setting. Only downfall I could think of is what others wrote. A more painful recovery with your bottom half &amp; chest.

I wouldn’t. I once did bA revision and large volume facial electrolysis a week apart and I was sick forever. Was too much on my body
