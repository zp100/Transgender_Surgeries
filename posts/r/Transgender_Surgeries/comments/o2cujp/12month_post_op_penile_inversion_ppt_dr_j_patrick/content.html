I had robot-assisted peritoneal pull through (PPT) penile inversion vaginoplasty (etc.) with Dr. Selph exactly 1 year ago today. He is a surgeon at UAB in Birmingham, AL. and is a  reconstructive urologist by training.
</p>
<p>
For more details, see my previous post:
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/kbirbt/6month_post_op_penile_inversion_ppt_dr_j_patrick/content.html">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/kbirbt/6month_post_op_penile_inversion_ppt_dr_j_patrick/</a>
</p>
<p>
Changes since my 6-month:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dilation depth is about the same, 12 cm or so for blue and purple dilators, a bit less for the green dilator. I haven&#39;t tried the orange yet, might give it a go in a month or so. I dilate once per day, usually about 5 days a week (some night I&#39;m too tired and just don&#39;t bother). I could probably dilate even less, honestly.
</li>
<li>
I have a very stable urine stream now, no issues at all there
</li>
<li>
Discharge is almost entirely gone. I&#39;ve got a tiny bit of granulation near the clitoris that is producing some discharge still. I expect to get that fixed at my next follow up, in about 3 weeks.
</li>
<li>
Aesthetically I&#39;m pretty happy. I&#39;ve got a bit of labia minora (you can see it in the second picture the best).
</li>
<li>
Puffiness in the labia majora has gone done considerably between the 6 and 12 month mark. It just seems to take quite a while for that to subside.
</li>
<li>
I have absolutely zero libido (likely due to the lack of testes). I intend to adjust my hormones a bit at my next HRT appointment to maybe get some back. Seems silly to have gotten the surgery and not even wanting to use it üòÇ
</li>
<li>
Sensation seems fine. If I had a sex drive I could probably orgasm, but I haven&#39;t yet
</li>
<li>
Dr Selph has done at least 30 of these surgeries now. There&#39;s about 12-15 of us in a Discord group and his results seem relatively consistent
</li>
<li>
I didn&#39;t do any hair removal pre-op, and I haven&#39;t spotted any internal hairs. I&#39;m going to have the doctor take a look at my next checkup.
</li>
<li>
Granulation has been a real source of annoyance, I&#39;ve had 3 different patches of it now. Luckily it doesn&#39;t hurt, it just produces a lot of discharge and occasionally bleeds. I&#39;m crossing my fingers that this will be the last round of granulation I have to deal with. This vagina really wants to go the extra mile and pretend I have a uterus, even if it&#39;s just a few drops of blood every few days üòÇ
</li>
</ul>

Yes, I was very surprised and happy to learn there was a surgeon in AL since I live in Huntsville, AL. And a surgeon that uses cutting-edge methods too!

Thanks for sharing! I don&#39;t see too much about bottom surgery farther out than a few months it feels like. Sounds like everything is going relatively well! ‚ô•

<p>
Sure!
</p>
<p>
The big highlights of the last few months have been some additional healing. In particular the color has started looking quite nice, and isn&#39;t so blueish grey anymore.
</p>
<p>
Also orgasms finally happened around the 13-14 months mark! I&#39;ve gotten pretty decent at it too.
</p>
<p>
Granulation finally got sorted a few months ago, and I finally felt comfortable ditching the liners. I used the liners to keep an eye out for bleeding, but that&#39;s no longer necessary.
</p>
<p>
About the only trouble I&#39;ve had has been my width isn&#39;t great. I can use the purple and blue soul source GRS dilators well enough, but the green I can&#39;t get in very far. It&#39;s not a huge deal to me though, what I&#39;ve got already totally works for me anyways.
</p>
<p>
Once I hit the proper 2 year mark in a couple months I&#39;ll do a final round of pictures I think.
</p>
<p>
Overall I&#39;m very happy with the results!

Thanks for answering fast, are you aware of any percentage or anything that can suggest the revisions needed? I will probably have to travel to US(nearest) and revisions can become an issue.

<p>
So I&#39;ve talked to about 25 Selph patients and I&#39;d guess about 20% or so seek revisions (i.e. 4-5 out of the ~25 I know about)
</p>
<p>
Also if you&#39;re traveling I highly recommend planning to stay about a month. That&#39;s the time period where complications are most likely to arise

I didn&#39;t have too many questions for mine. Whether they require hair removal is one I can think of off the top of my head

In your previous post you mentioned you did not do any hair removal. Since you didn&#39;t have many in the &#34;bad spots&#34; anyway.
</p>
<p>
May I ask what these &#34;bad spots&#34; are? I think it&#39;s quite common to actuall mix PPT with penile inversion (tho, I don&#39;t know why), I can imagine that that&#39;s pretty much the only place you might have to consider hair removal (penile skin), isn&#39;t it?

I&#39;m not really sure. Selph does hybrid PPT, so it uses a lot of the same tissue as PI as well. He does use a bit of scrotal skin somewhere, so I imagine that&#39;d be the place that would need the most hair removed if you did want to do it in advance.

Thanks so much for sharing your results and experience so far. I&#39;m just now finding out about Dr. Selph and I&#39;m in the southeast U.s.
</p>
<p>
Anyway you would invite me to the discord group? I&#39;m hoping to learn more and more about the surgeons currently on my wishlist.
