Has anyone heard about Dr. Joshua Roth in Indianapolis? He is the urologist the Gender Clinic in Indy refers to, and my daughter needs to see a urologist. When she was researching surgeons for SRS (still planning), she found something that set her against him, but now I can&#39;t find it. Anyway, if anyone has had any personal experiences with him, it would really help me to know whether to encourage my daughter to take another look or to run away quickly to a different urologist. Thanks so much!

My experience with Dr. Roth is that he can be
<em>
very
</em>
difficult to get along with, but produces exemplary work. I get the sense he is deeply invested in his work and takes a great deal of pride in the service he offers, and so might take anything that comes across as criticism quite personally. My only complaint, really, is that some of the guidance he provides post-op can be quite nebulous; he seems to expect his patients to trust him and just go with the flow, and
<em>
in fairness
</em>
I can’t say that trust would be misplaced. Most notably, my recovery was exceptionally quick and easy (insofar as recovery from GCS can be “easy”).
</p>
<p>
I’d recommend him. In fact, if I had to start over again I’d choose him again without a second thought. I’m honestly surprised he and I didn’t get into a fist fight during my hospital stay, but it was worth it. Most of your interactions with him will go through a very attentive nurse navigator anyway, and the convenience factor of that alone cannot be understated.
</p>
<p>
It really depends on your priorities, but TL;DR based on my experience alone he’s worth looking into further.

I agree with your description of his personality and bedside manner. It&#39;s spot on. He&#39;s way too sensitive and takes negative feedback or complaints far to personal. I think he&#39;s probably better with younger patients and inexperienced surgery patients who don&#39;t already have their bullshit meter cranked to 11 after being treated like shit for 3 1/2 years at the same Hospitial.

I was kind of hoping she might see him for a current issue and find she was open to srs with him, but this is not sounding promising. She is scheduled for a consult with Min Jun in October 2023. I’m a little terrified of being so far from everything we know and are familiar with for her recovery period and I worry about the travel and the cost. I was hoping maybe she’d connect with someone closer to home.

<p>
For what it is worth, Dr. Jun would have been my fallback option, and many of my friends have positive things to say about his practice.
</p>
<p>
Travel for GCS is not uncommon simply due to the scarcity of providers, but it’s not something I can comment on. For reference, I am from Chicago, and the car ride wasn’t as bad as I’d thought it would be. That said, if you gave me the choice between getting on a plane 1-2 weeks post-op or walking to the tempo of “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” across a bed of hot coals, I’d have to think about it. Another consideration is that she wouldn’t just be traveling for the surgery itself— I don’t know of any providers that do not require multiple follow up appointments post-op.
</p>
<p>
Finding a surgeon that you are comfortable with is very, very important, and everyone is going to have different priorities. However, recovery from GCS is not to be underestimated— surgery is the easy part. In terms of difficulty, I’d rank recovery as more difficult than Army basic training but not as difficult as being the parent of a rambunctious toddler, if that paints any sort of meaningful picture.

I&#39;ve done both of those comparisons, so that is helpful. Min Jun will require she stay in area for a month. Honestly, I am a little scared for her. This sounds like such a tough recovery. I want her to be happy and healthy and we&#39;ll do what we have to do to get her there, but, man, this is overwhelming.

I know I’m a year late, but I definitely would recommend not seeing this person. I have read handful of handfuls of terrible mutilations and him, ignoring any concerns a patient has.
</p>
<p>
his office knows that after he does a bad surgery either way most patients will still come to him for for the HRT and therefore he’s still getting insurance payouts

I&#39;m seeing him for my bottom surgery. My consult went fine. He was very careful to make sure I understood everything and the gravity of bottom surgery, as well as giving me all the space and time I needed for my questions. From things I&#39;ve read paired with my experience, I think he is just not a surgeon who is very focused on his work and your care and not the type of doc who kinda acts like your friend. And even with that, he was very nice. Imo, I think he&#39;s a really good doctor. My orchi went super smooth and I look forward to my PPT with him. I understand some ppl have had not stellar results, but every bottom surgeon has patients who have had not stellar results. He&#39;s no Rumer.
</p>
<p>
Also, his DNP Amanda is truly amazing. My post op check in with her went fantastically.

I had experiences and a revision with him starting in early March, 2020 until Dec 2nd, 2020. I wish I could say it was a pleasant time, but it was not. I went to him with bad epidermal cysts from my GRS surgery with Gallagher and left with a chronic wound and an epidermal cyst  10 months later. Dr. Roth said he didn&#39;t have the expertise to deal with my chronic wound.
</p>
<p>
I used the word &#34;shit&#34; as in, &#34;I&#39;m tired of this shit&#34;, during my last appointment and he reprimanded me like a child and accused me of cussing him out. He also accused me of pressuring him into scheduling surgery against his better judgement by &#34;breaking down in his office&#34;. I am amazingly persuasive.
</p>
<p>
He turned out to be a spiteful drama queen in my opinion. He didn&#39;t live up to the promises he made about anything. He couldn&#39;t even follow through on the treatment we both agreed to multiple times. When I finally pressed him on it he retaliated by writing petty garbage in my medical records. I&#39;ve posted about my experience with him before. It&#39;s in my user/sub.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s currently the only one doing GRS in the State of Indiana. Based on what I&#39;ve seen he seems like he&#39;s doing decent PPT surgery. I haven&#39;t heard any complaints about his GRS, personally. Some local folks have told me I should give him a pass because he&#39;s all we have in Indiana. We? Ummmm....no. Sorry, I still won&#39;t recommend him based on my experience.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend any surgeon who blames their patients for making decisions they outright admit are against their better judgement. No fucking chance that&#39;s happening. The nerve of that guy.
</p>
<p>
Maybe it&#39;s time to break out the Roth Emails so people can see exactly why we don&#39;t trust our healthcare providers. They are a lesson in frustration while dealing with someone who clearly viewed me as a lesser human being. It was all just another shitty chapter added to my GRS tragedy with Gallagher, and IU-Health.

Thank you for this. I can guarantee my daughter would not do well being treated like this.
