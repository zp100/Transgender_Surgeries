Hello all, I report on LGBT+ issues for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and am researching this issue for a potential story. I hope you don&#39;t mind me commenting on the thread. I&#39;m in touch with Mount Sinai and Facial Team, among others, but I&#39;d also like to hear from people who have had their affirming surgeries delayed/cancelled recently. If anyone does want to get in touch the best way is email: [
<a href="mailto:rachel.savage@thomsonreuters.com">rachel.savage@thomsonreuters.com
</a>
](mailto:
<a href="mailto:rachel.savage@thomsonreuters.com">rachel.savage@thomsonreuters.com
</a>
). But you can also find me on Twitter and my article profile is here:
<a href="https://news.trust.org/profile/?id=003D000002WZGYRIA5">https://news.trust.org/profile/?id=003D000002WZGYRIA5
</a>
I hope you&#39;re all doing ok and staying well &amp; safe.Take care, Rachel
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Here is the finished article. Thank you again for allowing me to post here, but most importantly thank you to everyone who shared their stories with me. I couldn&#39;t include everyone, but everyone I spoke to helped me to, I hope, better understand this issue. I hope you&#39;re all doing well! Thank you, Rachel

I hope you will be careful in the framing of this article. A similar article from Vice caused a nasty transphobic backlash on social media, so I would encourage anyone who considers participating to think over their words really carefully.

Thanks for your thoughts. I can&#39;t control how people react to my articles, but I of course understand the need to be sensitive, especially at this difficult time for everyone.

absolutely this, OP. bored transphobes stuck in isolation are just chomping at the bit to find online content to further drive hate. make sure (at the very least) to state we understand patient prioritization and are simply disappointed. not in uproar.

Thank you. That is what I&#39;m hearing from people I&#39;ve spoken to, that they understand why this is happening, however disappointing it may be. It&#39;s not my job to put words in people&#39;s mouths and I&#39;ll do my best to take care

Pointing you to a few materials that could help you build up a report. Please try to show trans people in a positive light. It is one of the most straining conditions on this planet because people can have a feeling that things are wrong on a number of levels. There can be a feeling that parts of the body should be different ( this can go as far as having phantom feelings that other parts should be there ), people can feel wrong on hormones of the gender assigned at birth ( and many usually have a feeling of relief on hormones of the gender they identify with ), and there can be social preferences like preferences for pronouns etc. All of those are along a spectrum.
<a href="https://www.genderbread.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Genderbread-2.1-1600.jpg" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
is a graphical explanation that might help make it more relatable.
</p>
<p>
There are more and more studies showing that this condition has a biological connection.
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24377907_Sexual_differentiation_of_the_human_brain_in_relation_to_gender_identity_and_sexual_orientation" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
is one study, and
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d9KKqP9IHa5ZxU84a_Jf0vIoAh7e8nj_lCW27KbYBh0/edit?pli=1#gid=0" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
is a spreadsheet with a multitude of others. There are more studies in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
The current government has collected people in councils that said they will try to stamp trans people out of existence. You know what it is called to try to stamp a group of people with certain features out of existence. So at least hinting to the fact that there are studies showing that there is a biological connection could be helpful. It can also help make it more relatable for people who do not have this condition. For them its often some kind of nebulous random idea anyone could have.
</p>
<p>
The suicide quote of trans people is between 41 and 60 percent, according to a
<a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Suicidality-Transgender-Sep-2019.pdf" rel="nofollow">study
</a>
by the William Institute, depending on age, social group, etc. A 2010
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19473181" rel="nofollow">meta-study
</a>
, based on 28 previous long-term studies of transsexual men and women, found that the overall psychological functioning of transsexual people after transition was similar to that of the general population and significantly better than that of untreated transsexual people.
</p>
<p>
One of the best
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872188" rel="nofollow">long term studies
</a>
done in Sweden including all applications for sex reassignment surgery from 1960-2010 reports a regret rate of 2.2%. For comparison, Lasik procedures have a regret rate of 5.5 percent.
</p>
<p>
Since treatment including surgeries often enables people to contribute to society and give back by being able to work and live a normal life, it can even be cheaper in the long run. There are calculations that it is much cheaper than keeping people on antidepressants and in living conditions that include homelessness and unemployment. The rates for trans people are staggering in those regards, studies from the Williams institute also include numbers.
</p>
<p>
So for many people treatment can be life saving and postponing treatment can be very straining for them.
</p>
<p>
Concerning surgeries themself the methods have improved vastly the last years and continue to improve. In the US surgeons including at Mount Sinai start to use peritoneal tissue, which is self lubricating, in some other countries it is also introduced.
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ew4zi7/jan_2020_lecture_by_thai_surgeon_showing/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
is a video showing comparisons of the inside with natal tissue and with various techniques. This could put the rumors of it being like an open wound to rest.
</p>
<p>
Those materials could be used to make a balanced and truthful report of trans people that could further peoples understanding and that could be helpful for trans people having treatment in the future. As said I would appreciate if it would be done in a way that would be positive for trans people.
</p>
<p>
You can PM me if you have questions or concerning more materials.

Thanks Rachel, seems sensitive to the community of people in a gender transition. In regards to providers, it is different for each sector and country, but I think the article sheds light on how a lack of healthcare access can be particularly painful for LGBTI people yet there are indeed professionals finding solutions and preparing for a better tomorrow.

Thanks Lilia! And thanks for talking to me for the story. We decided to focus on the stories of people who&#39;d had their surgeries cancelled, but it was really useful to talk to you about Facial Team

Thanks for the update. Somehow I missed it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve updated the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/exrxnh/rule_6_posts_from_those_with_a_commercial/" rel="nofollow">original post
</a>
about commercial users on this sub to say something about their verification status.
</p>
<p>
Would it be possible to post your reddit user name somewhere on your official communication channel so that its possible to easily verify your reddit account. I understand that this point its extremely likely you are who you say you are, but I like to tidy up loose ends. I&#39;ll update that post if/when you do.

Hi there, I&#39;ve added my Reddit profile to my Twitter bio - unfortunately I&#39;m not verified on Twitter either!

I could also send you an email from my Thomson Reuters email address if that would help? If you&#39;d like to private message / Twitter DM me an address please do. Or ask for my WhatsApp/Signal if you&#39;d prefer to send it to me securely. Any other way of verification, please do let me know thanks! Rachel

Thanks, that&#39;s pretty good. I think you&#39;re high profile enough that its extremely unlikely the twitter account is not real. And clearly people are talking to you without even that.
</p>
<p>
No need for the email, anyone who&#39;s that paranoid will no doubt want to do it themselves.
</p>
<p>
I should have mentioned it before, but since the original post was 11 days old very few people will have noticed when you updated it. Due to the way reddit works there&#39;s a very short attention span and conversations here tend not last more than a day or so. You might like to make the update as a post so that people see it. Perhaps it will help for next time.

I watched her linked videos on Dr. James Makokis. It was pretty good.

I understand where you’re coming from, but if you’re going to make such a big deal of it I think you should back it up with some evidence. It’s easy to research her.

I didn’t do a lot of investigation, but what I did do looked good. I’m very busy lately or I’d probably dig into this a lot more. Why don’t you take a look at see what you can find, and post it here.

<p>
Facial Team did post on Facebook about her.

Without wanting to interrupt your conversation, if anyone wants to ask more questions about this or my work in general, feel free to ask or DM/email me. (And, as someone whose job often involves being cynical, I am pro people doing their research before deciding whether to trust people!).

You’re free to take part in the conversation here. People can see who you are and the rules of the sub are posted in the sidebar. I expect you can offer a unique perspective if you choose to.
</p>
<p>
As you may have noticed reddit can a bit rough, and there’s little moderation/censorship here for things that help the community. I have done some moderation in this conversation, but it’s mainly for rule 1.
</p>
<p>
You posting here falls more or less falls under rule 6, although it’s not the kind of thing I had in mind originally. If it’s of benefit to the community it’s allowable.

I’d suggest you update us with the article you’re working on when it’s released if you want to build up a relationship with the people here.

Thank you for explaining, that&#39;s really helpful. And for being understanding.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still quite new to Reddit, but will take all the rules and advice on board. I will update when I can (although I should say that as with all articles I work on there is always a chance that they won&#39;t be published - which has happened in the past for numerous reasons out of my control!).

We mustn&#39;t push people away if they want to represent us. How will they know how to write truthfully and impactfully if we won&#39;t speak to them?
</p>
<p>
All journalists: come and chat! We love to share understanding and acceptance

Because they sell those stories to society, and that is how society will see us. You make an impression with every action, to both journalists and wider society, so try to make them good ones? Journalists are people too. Not all of them are out to get us.

Just because I don&#39;t control something, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad. And judging journalists on their track record? Sounds like stereotyping to me. And we know how much stereotypes damage the trans community

Stereotype: A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re basing the worth and future conduct of one journalist you&#39;ve never met on the actions of some controversial ones you heard about in the past. Stereotyping.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not a journalist. My story won&#39;t get heard on its own. My options are to say nothing, and preserve the state of the media as a transphobic space.  OR I can tell my story and perhaps make a little positive difference. Hostility doesn&#39;t help anyone here. Dialogue does.
