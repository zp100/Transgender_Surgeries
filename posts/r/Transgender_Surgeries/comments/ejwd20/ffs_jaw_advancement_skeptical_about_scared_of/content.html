I would just say read some reviews of Dr Bart. Some results look amazing but there are some horror story reviews, including nerve damage.

If you don&#39;t want to have additional risk for lip numbness, you could opt not to do the jaw advancement and get a lower facelift after surgery at some point.
</p>
<p>
I had ffs with facial team with chin work and have a small amount of excess skin which can give me a double chin at unflattering angles, but if I&#39;m upright, it&#39;s not a problem at all. Idk your situation though so I can&#39;t really say how your surgery would go.

I had FFS with Facial Team (FT) Oct 2019. In addition to the feminization aspects, I had a jaw advancement for purely cosmetic reasons. I have had no loss in sensitivity in lip, jaw, etc. Doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t happen. FT accessed my jaw through openings they made in the interior of my lower lip. Those healed quite nicely. I did have some &#34;tension&#34; in my jaw muscles as the jaw-moved-forward created muscle tension. It&#39;s been three months since my surgery and the tension (minor aches) are 90% gone. Of all my procedures at FT accomplished at once (orbital/forehead shaving, upper lip shortening, hair transplant and jaw) that was the least complicated from a healing aspect. Nothing they did was a
<em>
HUGE
</em>
difference (nor should it from my perspective...I still want to look like me, just a more feminized version). But collectively, the changes were just what I wanted and caused persons who knew me, but didn&#39;t know about my surgery, to say things along the lines of &#34;you look really good...new makeup...new hairstyle?&#34; etc.

I went with FT because they are constantly refining procedures and publishing in peer-reviewed journals on their techniques. I&#39;m sure there are many other surgical groups that would be equally competent. One thing I did like is that there were a pair of surgeons who worked together and each specialized in one part of the face. I&#39;m always a bit suspicious of &#34;I can do it all types&#34; though there may be many good ones. FT has good facilities, great and supportive care and the fair-sized medical team is skilled. I speak Spanish but didn&#39;t need to--surgeons and staff speak English and the surrounding area is a huge British retirement community so many locals speak English. I actually wanted a trash-shave--they said they&#39;d be happy to do it, but that I really didn&#39;t need one (they were right). How many cosmetic surgeons try to talk you out of a procedure?? I had one doctor for my forehead, another for chin/jaw and a third for lip lift (and a little fat injection). This was followed by a hair transplant right after surgery while I was still unconscious or semi-conscious. It was all scheduled for one session so surgery lasted maybe 5hrs? So four surgeons, extensive support staff and all done at once. This was followed by two nights in the hospital. My face was not super-masculine so my changes were subtle. Not trying to steer you to FT, just some feedback from one person who had FFS. I wish you the very best of luck with whatever procedure you need and whoever you select to do it.

I just saw a new post on susans about 2pass discussing a possible class action against him. It sounded pretty bad. I was going to post a link, but it seems to have disappeared - susans tend to do that.

I don&#39;t quite understand how how jaw advancement would prevent sagging skin, if anything it would make it even worse as it&#39;s a more aggressive procedure than a simple contouring.
