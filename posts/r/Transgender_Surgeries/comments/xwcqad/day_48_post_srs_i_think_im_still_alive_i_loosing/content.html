Take it slower, be easy and take your time as Lily has said.  I do think the reality of how rough your first surgery was; you probably will need a second revision surgery to get things looking really fantastic.  I&#39;m sure things will calm down more as time goes on, but you had it ROUGH there girl!  Honestly we&#39;re jut glad you&#39;re okay and your vajayjay is still attached and didn&#39;t split or have some of the worse thing that can happen when necrosis hits.  It will be okay, its just going to take a while!  Big hugs Bunny!

Thank you... Yeah, at least the worst already happened. And yeah probably I will need a revision, my surgeon told me that if it&#39;s needed there&#39;s no problem with that. So I will just wait ü´Ç‚ù§Ô∏è

I think the one thing you can take in solace here is, your surgeon definitely seamed to handle the situation right and I don&#39;t think it was any fault of theirs that it happened.  I&#39;m just hoping your treasure trove recovers quick so you can find your happy down there!

Yeah, I know my surgeon is not at fault. I mean I have a friend that did the surgery with the same surgeon one day before me and she looks perfect. Sadly I got the complications, but he knew how to act. But I got messages of people telling me to sue him and that he should touch a trans girl never again. I think people doesn&#39;t know that complications happens even with the best surgeons.

No absolutely, it sucks but its literally as simple as you had a blood vessel that didn&#39;t make it through the surgery causing the necrosis.  There is no way surgeons can guarantee every time there is zero necrosis with vaginoplasty.  You just have to hope your surgeon is good enough and smart enough that necrosis that does occur is superficial and for the most part yours was, and that they can react accordingly if there is an emergency.

Well you are in here sending pictures talking to us and doing the only thing you can while recovering!  Very few people could have handled what you went through better!  Honestly I look forward to your updates just knowing you are getting by and hanging in there Bunny!   So keep posting updates even if it&#39;s just a text update so we all know you are okay!  None of us here want to loose our Cute Little Bunny!   Huggles for you üíï

I read through your saga‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry over the awful ride you‚Äôve had. It‚Äôs a sobering truth that even good surgeons doing their best don‚Äôt have a 0.00% complication rate. Biology is just frustratingly messy. I went to Suporn and had complications including some necrosis, and later had two revisions a couple years apart, and still need/want a third.
</p>
<p>
I had an absolutely miserable time with dilation for endless months. I‚Äôm gonna give you the hard-won advice that would‚Äôve saved me great pain and hundreds of hours of my life which you or others may also find helpful:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
1) Get wearable silicone dilators, two kinds:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
-She-Ology sells two series of tapered ones that are too short for actual dilation, but are perfect for stretching the entrance and scar ring, and have a flared base so you can wear them while sitting. The small series is probably too small to be useful, ignore that one. Not being too long, they can remain comfortable to wear for hours. Makes the first few inches a breeze at your next dilation session especially if the scar ring contraction gets really bad.
</p>
<p>
-Fuze makes a series of five cylindrical silicone dilators up to 1.5‚Äù diameter and 5.75‚Äù insertable. The first couple are probably useless, but the latter three (1‚Äù, 1.25‚Äù, 1.5‚Äù diameter) are perfect for wearing overnight with a couple tight pairs of underwear. If you start losing hours a day of your life just getting to depth, having a dilator inside for many more hours a day will make a huge difference.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
2) EMLA cream.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
-This must be considered
<em>
very carefully
</em>
, but a SMALL amount of EMLA numbing cream (prescription only) can be applied to the tip of a dilator, especially the large one, to attenuate how painful it is. Even better stacked with at least acetaminophen/paracetamol (don‚Äôt make ibuprofen a habit, it‚Äôs very rough on your digestive system). In case you have terrible pain tolerance like me, you‚Äôre not fighting this battle on a level playing field with those with higher pain tolerance. You‚Äôve suffered enough already; this is an accommodation to make it a little more bearable. (Edit: forgot to clarify, EMLA cream is quite effective when used internally, so it‚Äôs easy to over-numb and not realize you‚Äôre hurting yourself.)
</p>
<p>
After all you‚Äôve been through already, it might be more difficult to psychologically ‚Äúbond‚Äù with your new anatomy. That said,
<em>
you‚Äôre early in healing and the final result with no revision is at least a year away
</em>
. A revision can work magic later on. Assume you WILL get the vulva you desire even if it takes longer than many. If dilation gets harder as it often does in months 2-3, it‚Äôs easy to become demotivated if you‚Äôre not happy with your result, and then slack off on dilation.
<strong>
Don‚Äôt let it happen!
</strong>
That‚Äôs the one thing that is fully in your control right now. I slacked off around month 5-6 because I wasn‚Äôt happy and lost some depth and width, and only recovered it millimeter by millimeter following what I wrote above.
</p>
<p>
Disclaimer: obviously not medical advice, and you‚Äôre probably just barely at the point in healing where this is safe to do, depending on the type of graft you had internally. You need to maintain rigorous hygiene, ie waist-down showers after every dilation session, and try to pee every time you take a worn silicone dilator out to avoid a UTI.
</p>
<p>
Edit2: thanks for the award kind stranger!

Thanks for the tips. It&#39;s bad that I&#39;m showering before the dilataton and no after it? I mean, after the dilatation I always clean the canal of the vagina with water like my doctor told me. But I don&#39;t know why I prefere to shower before and no after. Is bad to do it? Should I shower after? And the emla... Well I&#39;m just 3 days post start using the big dilatator. It hurts the first 5 mins, then it burns for 5 more mins and then it doesn&#39;t hurt anymore. I think the first days or weeks its normal to hurt, no?

You definitely want to shower after especially this early on. Assuming you‚Äôre using enough lube, you almost certainly need to shower after. And by ‚Äúshower‚Äù, I mean water-only, waist down otherwise you might irritate your skin. UTIs are very unpleasant, and are best avoided with really careful hygiene especially this early in recovery.
</p>
<p>
If it‚Äôs just 5 min of pain here and there and you find it tolerable, no worries. I just generally reject the normalization of pain when it‚Äôs easily avoidable (and I do mean ‚Äúpain‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúdiscomfort‚Äù). Subjecting yourself to something painful several times a day for weeks to months can be very hard on a human, especially if you have low pain tolerance or are otherwise very sensitive to such things.

<a href="/u/Cut3LittleBunny">u/Cut3LittleBunny

also want to add to this fantastic comment by
<a href="/u/unexpected_daughter">u/unexpected_daughter
</a>
, that you should definitely check out clobetasol steroid cream for internal granulation. The pain you are experiencing is 100% granulation. That&#39;s exactly how it feels when I get it. Mount Sinai (Dr. Ting/Dr. Avanessian) prescribe it post-op for breaking up the stalled granulation healing cycle so that things can heal fully. I had a revision recently and started getting some granulation occur when I sized up to the orange soul source dilator at day 28 post-op. The plan is to put some clobetasol inside me with a lube injector once a day, for 3 months. Cannot recommend it enough.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: ALSO homemade CBD anal suppositories!! I got a silicone carrot shaped mold off amazon, a bunch of CBD flowers from my local cannabis shop, a jar of high quality coconut oil, and followed a youtube video on how to make CBD butter in my InstantPot pressure cooker. I keep them in the fridge and pop one up my booty twice a day, an hour before dilation. Super relaxes the muscles and hopefully promotes healing.
</p>
<p>
EDIT2: omg lol, daughter, I literally just recommended clobetasol in another comment to you too. üòÖ I promise there&#39;s no conspiracy.

Thanks for all this excellent advice!
</p>
<p>
Quick question: so whenever I do a particularly ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù dilation session, I find I need to wait at least a day if not two to do it again. It actually gets easier if I wait (about ten years postop though, different situation). If I go ‚Äúnon aggressive‚Äù I can keep it up every day just fine. Also sound like granulation?

Well now it doesn&#39;t hurt or burn. It&#39;s just a little bit uncomfortable. I think it&#39;s just because of the change of size. I mean the little one was like 1.5 cm of diameter and the second one 3 cm of diameter. Now I don&#39;t really feel anything more than when I use the little one.

Well now it&#39;s just uncomfortable the first mins. But then it&#39;s all okay. So I think its just because of the first times doing it.
</p>
<p>
And the showers. Yeah, now I&#39;m doing it after the dilatation and not before. Thanks for the information ‚ù§Ô∏è

To be perfectly honest, having seen where you came from I think you healed through it better than I could have imagined. May want a surgery for labia definition but you‚Äôre pretty impressively recovered from a month ago.

maybe slow down, everything is still new and healing. don&#39;t hurt yourself. if the larger dilator hurts, maybe try using one of the smaller ones until it doesn&#39;t hurt and then go back up to the larger size.
</p>
<p>
also, every vagina is different and this one looks exactly like your vagina, even if it doesn&#39;t look like someone else&#39;s vagina.

I can&#39;t postpone more the largest dilatator... I&#39;m 2 weeks late to start using it... I mean, the first 5 mins it hurts a lot, the next 5 it burns and then it doesn&#39;t hurt anymore.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, ik that every vagina looks different... But just look at my clitoris. Right now it doesn&#39;t look nice. It&#39;s too swollen.

Obviously listen to your surgical team, but also bear in mind that dilation instructions vary
<em>
wildly
</em>
between surgeons, even for similar methods. I didn&#39;t start using the big #4 soulsource dilator until 4 months post-op and I had PI with a graft.
</p>
<p>
Making sure you dilate and maintaining depth is more important than girth as you can slowly train girth but training depth can be much more difficult if not impossible. Talk to your team if you can, you might be able to take it slower provided you&#39;re still getting to depth. There&#39;s a variety of reasons you could be in pain and some are very treatable, but you&#39;ll want someone to take a look inside your vagina if they haven&#39;t done that recently, especially if you&#39;re still getting discharge.

I had a little pain spot inside the vagina and couldn‚Äôt handle the orange dilator (#4) so just used 2 &amp; 3 for about three weeks. Had some pain at same spot, but got back to #4 a couple of weeks ago and it‚Äôs ok now. Don‚Äôt think I lost depth. Just hit 3 months. Hang in there, it‚Äôs a long hard slog, but worth the effort. Sending eHugs.

Keep at it and stay positive. You have made it this far and come through some pretty hard times. Like many folks I have been following your story. It WILL all come right in the end.
</p>
<p>
Regarding dilation, throw everything you can at it. Relaxing music, wedge cushion, create a relaxing ambiance and don&#39;t try to rush. My own dilation hurts if I am ever in a hurry with it. I&#39;ll post the method I use earlier on my profile lest it helps others.

Well I have no experience with what your dealing with but the body is amazing and maby as time passes youll be blown away I do know when there is an infection healing slows down because its focusing on fixing they infection first, now that your infection is gone your body can foucus on further healing.

Keep at it kiddo, everyone is here for you. The saying I like is: it will all work out in the end and if it still hasn&#39;t worked out.....then it&#39;s not the end. Stay strong

I genuinely think yours looks like a vagina. I don&#39;t think it looks that bad, but obviously we are our worst critics and you&#39;re going to be harsher on yourself because this is a really big important thing for you and you want it to be the best outcome as possible. As things continue to settle and maybe after a revision, I hope you will be happier with it.

Worst case is u might want a small revision, but it‚Äôs too early to tell. I think u shoukd shave a bit to show it more. It‚Äôs very pretty, it just may need slight tweaks at worst case. We‚Äôll see as it heals more.

First 3 months it will look nothing like what it looks like 9 months post-op. So much swelling and bleeding still. Just give it time. This is coming from someone 3 years post-op.
</p>
<p>
Just, take it from me as someone who doesn&#39;t like their end result: keep at it, don&#39;t stop dialatong consistently or anything. It WILL look worse if you get discouraged at all. Try to remain positive and it will turn out great.
</p>
<p>
Fwiw: it looks amazing right now, especially for only a month and a half
