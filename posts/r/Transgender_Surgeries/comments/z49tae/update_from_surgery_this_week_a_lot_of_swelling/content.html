Vaginoplasty
<em>
is
</em>
exhausting like nothing else Iâ€™ve experienced. Before it I had two rounds of FFS under general anesthesia and two rounds of hair transplants under local anesthesia. I thought nothing could be worse than my first FFS, which left me able barely able to see and difficult to breathe for several days following my surgery. I thought I was ready for vaginoplasty but this surgery still wiped the floor with me both mentally and physically.

Congratulations on your surgery and I hope you have a speedy recovery!

Looks like swelling from a hematoma. Had the same thing happen on my labiaplasty revision. It should deflate over time as the swelling and wound heals. Does icing help?
