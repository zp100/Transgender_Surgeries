I am 6 months post-op and I have discharge. it is a bright yellow mucus. My surgeon said it is normal and that even cis women have discharge. My surgeon gave me a steroid cream for my granulations and it cleared up the discharge, but it came back. Has anyone experienced this?

Update: I saw my provider at the LGBTQ clinic, who is familiar taking care of post op transwoman and she said that I have a lot of granulation tissue and that is where the discharge is coming from. She took a sample and sent it to the lab to see if it is bacteria, just in case. I will be using the steroid cream for two weeks and follow up with her and she will take care of the remaining granulation tissue.

I added this post to the wiki. It would be helpful if you could update again when you know more.

Update: my provider did a bacteria culture and the results are : the discharge is from a Group B strep infection. She prescribed me antibiotics.

I have similar discharge at 6 months. I think the yellow discharge comes from granulation tissue. I&#39;m hoping my surgeon will do another round of silver nitrate if it doesn&#39;t go away on its own soon.
</p>
<p>
I base that on what I read here:

Maybe that is why the steroid cream helped. It helped clear up the granulations and the discharge.

That&#39;s a good possibility. I had some spots of granulation around the outer areas (near the urethra and by the perineum where I had some wound separation) at the 4 month mark that my surgeon took off with silver nitrate. But the internal stuff it harder to treat since the trauma of dilation every day is essentially aggravating the whole area. Once dilation slows down it should be less of a problem I&#39;m hoping.

No, that is not normal. Females may have some clear discharge that&#39;s a bit sticky, depending on where they are in their cycle. Colour is not normal!

I donâ€™t want to speak with certainty, but you might think of your cleansing/dilating lubricant method. Are you douching regularly to Clean out the accumulated lubricant? Are you bathing in the tub as opposed to just showering? Have you tried Good Clean Love Restore? Your surgeon can give better advice. But the mucus may be build up from healing and lube that is fermenting inside you.

I was told to douche with baby soap and water by my surgeon, but that dried out my vagina and caused it to bleed. I don&#39;t take baths. I use a Perry bottle with warm water, by my surgeon, to clean out my vagina. It cleans out the discharge, but it comes back.
