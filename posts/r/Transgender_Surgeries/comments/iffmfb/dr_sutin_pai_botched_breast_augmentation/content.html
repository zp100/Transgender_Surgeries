Iâ€™d stay far away from Pai! I went there in 2018 worse mistake of my life. I went there for SRS with dr Sutin when I got there the place was dirty and the staff was rude. I had already paid in advance and they would have taken over half my money in cancellation fees so I let him do my breast. Like I said worse mistake of my life. He placed one breast on top of the muscle and the other under. Cost me $6000 I paid $8600 for SRS so a week later I went to get my $2600 refund that was owed to me. They put me through every hoop not wanting to give me my refund. It took me 3 days of fighting them luckily the last time I went dr Preecha was there letâ€™s just say the building was cleaned that day along with the staff having a friendly face and I got my $2600. I would have complained about my breast but I didnâ€™t notice until I got home they pumped me with Saline along with swelling making them look like they were even. When I emailed them they said my breast were fine and the dr made no mistake. Take my advice to heart think very carefully before going there. I now am going to have to pay $10,000 to fix his botched work. If you look on real self youâ€™ll see more complaints about Dr. Sutin. Itâ€™s took me two years to show this. Iâ€™m so ashamed I donâ€™t let my husband see me naked. I went through a severe depression once I got back to the US due to what he did. I stopped eating for 2 weeks and was hospitalized. Iâ€™m just trying to warn you ladies PAI isnâ€™t what they seem.  The pic doesnâ€™t show whatâ€™s truly going on. I have pains all the timeðŸ˜©

I feel so sorry for you, I hope the second surgery gives you the results you want and deserve. Stay strong and remember youâ€™re worth it

Dr Sutin said he did nothing wrong. That I needed to massage my breast. I went to another plastic surgeon he confirmed he purposely botched me. One breast on top the under one under. It had to have either been done on purpose or I had two different surgeons working on me and they werenâ€™t communicating. Either way knowing what I know now I wouldnâ€™t let him touch my dog!

Maybe a consult a lawyer. This is well outside the realm of normal operation/results.

Yeah and I couldnâ€™t tell you what that generally is. Iâ€™d guess somewhere around 2-5 years.

No I backed out from having my SRS with him. I was told only a couple of days before my flight to not let him touch me by a girl who also got botched by him. I wish I would have just let him keep the surgery fee. When I got there it was nothing but bad vibes!

Yep I know. Thatâ€™s what I was going by but maybe just maybe heâ€™s racist because the other girl he botched is black also. Coincidence?

Probably not, Iâ€™ve read about him and some botched srs results as well.   Dr. Preecha maybe needs to get a little more hands on.  He had a good reputation when he was practicing.
