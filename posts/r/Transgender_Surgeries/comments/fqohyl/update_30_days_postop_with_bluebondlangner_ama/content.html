Well, this has been a wild ride. I had my second follow-up appointment and we left NYC to fly back home just in time. This is not a good period to be recovering in, so, solidarity with other people in early recovery and I feel extremely lucky that my surgery was before they started cancelling. To everyone affected, I&#39;m sorry, it may be an &#39;elective&#39; surgery but I know how necessary it is. It&#39;s going to be okay.
</p>
<p>
So, my recovery so far. I had one major bleeding incident - I dumped about five cups of blood in about 15 minutes and we rushed me to the ER. One of my surgeons, Dr Zhao, happened to be finishing up in theater and was able to come give me my first speculum exam - he determined there was no active bleed, so this was all old blood. It makes sense, you swell a lot, and all that blood and fluid has to go somewhere.
</p>
<p>
I am still bleeding a little when I dilate, and since now all my nerves are waking up, the pain is more noticeable when I dilate, but Tylenol and ibuprofen keep everything manageable. I&#39;m really happy with the aesthetics but I think it&#39;s going to be a long time before I can get any kind of erogenous feeling, everything is still too sore.
</p>
<p>
Any questions, feel free and I&#39;ll answer.
