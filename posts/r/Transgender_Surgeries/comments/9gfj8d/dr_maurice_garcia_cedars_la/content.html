would very much appreciate if you have had your surgery with Dr Garcia and would comment on your experience (pre and post operation) as I&#39;m interested in scheduling an appointment.  was he your first choice? wait time? were your results as expected? better?  Thanks!

Having surgery with him was the worst decision I’ve ever made in my life. He completely botched my genitals and has done this to countless other women. It won’t come out, looking anything like a vagina, and I now have to have surgery to correct the mess that he created he’s a complete butcher And a soulless evil narcissist

insurance coverage is the primary reason and also, hardly any wait time was also my rational. still, I&#39;m not comfortable. my spouse has strongly expressed her so far, unfounded concerns that also prevents me choosing him.
</p>
<p>
also tried to get more info from my primary who practiced with him at UCSF and she would not comment definitively.
</p>
<p>
if you move forward, please keep in touch. I&#39;d like to hear how you are and what he did. all the best.
</p>
<p>
Travel safe..

This is also something I&#39;m curious about. I&#39;m not letting myself get fast-tracked, or else I would have just gone to Bowers (lol). But I can&#39;t find anything about him, not even pictures (which is the make-or-break for a lot of these guys). So I&#39;m not sure.

Just exchanged email with a former patient of Dr Garcia at Cedars. From her account of her tragedy at his hands, I&#39;ve firmly decided not to ever consider him for surgery or anything else.

This is part of her account of suffering: &#34;...they said their surgeons can&#39;t do anything to do it because its a general rule that surgeons wont do anything to surgeries that were done by another surgeon, the original surgeon has to address any issues, both times I was in the local hospital for infection they tried transferring me to but they said they wont do anything, the original surgeon has to fix any issues, as a general rule they don&#39;t want to deal with &#34;other doctor&#39;s work&#34; so to speak, I wish they would have because I trust them way more than I trust dr. Garcia, the obgyn at the local hospital here was way more helpful than dr. Garcia, and when I spoke to dr. Garcia last time he didn&#39;t even believe me that I had an infection, he said the pain was probably just from general healing, even though at the hospital here they did cultures of inside the vagina and bloodwork, etc and diagnosed it as an acute infection and had to give me a special antibiotic because the bacterias from the culture were resistant to almost all of the antibiotics like vancomycin, I told dr Garcia that they did extensive tests, I was in intense pain and having brown liquid discharge 24/7 throughout the day, the gauze that I had on my vagina I had to change like 5+ times a day because it would be wet with brown liquid discharge which turned out to be from the infection, E. coli and the VRE vancomycin resistant enterocculus and when I told dr Garcia that he didn&#39;t even believe that I had an infection, he said &#34;bacteria and E. coli are everywhere, I could culture this table right here and you would find bacteria and I told him yeah...&#34;
</p>
<p>
garcia gave me the same crap about skin infections and he also pressured me to take a no depth vagina; because I think, after hearing from this girl who has really suffered, he isn&#39;t skilled enough to get the work done correctly and we just become another body for him to attempt to improve his skill as a surgeon.  If WPATH standards are enforceable he should possibly have his medical license revoked.

She is, from what I know by her email, just getting along. The issues with her vagina and her clitoris apparently will continue to bother her greatly until she can, one day, get those corrected.

the one photo of his work that I saw reminded me of John Waters mustache. there must be others so assumed it wasn&#39;t entirely representational and tried not to be judgmental. Bowers as far as I know doesn&#39;t have the wherewithal (right now?) to produce work like Dr Ting in New York. Garcia suggested using colon orperitoneum tissue and offered to go in stages producing a neo vagina with no depth then follow up with a vaginal canal that could potentially self lubricate. I&#39;m constricted by time and money so surgeons like Bowers no matter what her rep aren&#39;t a possibility - thousand dollar deposit&#34; two year waiting list? Unfortunately, no thanks. Getting to where I&#39;m needing to fast track soon. Travel safe.

Can you go in-depth about this? you had an in-person consult with him, right? but he only showed one photo of his work? I&#39;m having insurance hassles, so I haven&#39;t yet had a meeting with him, but I want to ask him if he&#39;d be capable of doing a peritoneum graft, and if he suggested the colon thing perhaps he can
