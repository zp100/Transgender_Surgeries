I think it was about 8-weeks for me. Better to be safe and make sure the skin is in best condition for the surgery, it takes a battering after! Lol X

I&#39;m having my last session 2 and a half weeks before surgery. I&#39;m doing it all through McGinns office. They recommend waiting 4 weeks between your last session and surgery though. I&#39;m only doing this out of necessity

Does McGinn&#39;s electrologist bill insurance (or at least have an NPI so you can try to get reimbursed)?

They don&#39;t bill insurance directly at all. You have to pay out of pocket then submit a claim for reimbursement

I made a bad choice and went two weeks before. But that was it of necessity because I was coming back from college.

I had to do it 3 weeks prior to SRS because of COVID-19 closures in the spring. This was the earliest and the closest I could get (6 hours drive one way). COVID-19 had a huge hit on SRS preparations. I remember in April I found an open place that was still open just within 19 short hours of drive only to get a call from them when I was within 1 hour from the destination that they had to close urgently due to COVID-19.

I have to say that electrolysis machines are different. The one that was used right before the surgery was one of the most modern. It wasn&#39;t very painful and I healed quickly after that. The machine with 2 dials is bad.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I healed very well after the surgery. So, doing it 3 weeks before the surgery was not an issue for me.
