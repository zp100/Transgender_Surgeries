As the queen of wound dehiscence, I say -- not that bad. Now if all the sutures let loose and the incisions come apart all the way through, that&#39;s another story. You don&#39;t seem to be anywhere near that.

Emma, I assure you that I have somethng awful and can&#39;t post it yet. Fifty % of wound separation. Swelling slowly going away and that&#39;s the reason for suture points to &#39;&#39;get closer&#39;&#39; and start to join themselves from deep inside, but the hematoma inside stops the process...
</p>
<p>
Now with a creme 2x a day (silver sulfadiazine, Vit A) and less swollen, it started to glue. But there are separated and bleeding, Cleaning with soapy water makes bleeding. Just water, not.
</p>
<p>
And candida is making my urethra to hurt, reedness, can&#39;t dilate anymore. I&#39;m fearing again loosing my VJ.
</p>
<p>
3 days ago the fluconazol gve me hopes but yesterday urethral redness is burning and can&#39;t past 2 cms of the dilator in....
</p>
<p>
any ideas?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
blessings for you

I&#39;m hesitant to suggest any intervention involving medications or creams that I have never used personally. IANAD, I&#39;m just someone who shares their own experience as I struggled with excessive complications and indifference. Your situation sounds different in the way it&#39;s unfolding and the fact that your surgeon is intervening with treatment. Where we seem to be crossing paths in our recovery from wound dehiscence is painful dilation and the fear of our vulvas closing or becoming too impeded by restrictions. This I can totally relate too. It&#39;s nothing short of torture.
</p>
<p>
I documented how I dealt with this in this post.

Have you had a discussion with your surgeon about the ramifications of healing through second intention? It can have a huge impact.

Hi Emma thank you. The surgeon asked for the sulfadiazine silver creme and letting it heal for itself, it was day 10 I believe. Then, he said days ago that white plaque was &#34;hygiene issues&#34;. Even one friend said &#34;that&#39;s fungal!&#34;.
</p>
<p>
My gp here identified it first sight, gave me fluconazol. He didn&#39;t saw the new redness site (deeper, urethra). Tomorrow will call the office to see him again. I couldn&#39;t put a creme for burns the surgeon asked for. It&#39;s too deep hidden. I called him today because I am concerned for not dilating fearing damage to urethra, and he went like crazy and told me nothing, no support.

Did anyone do a culture of the wound to actually find out what the fluid or seepage? That seems warranted at this point. Maybe your GP could do that and send it to a lab?
</p>
<p>
What do do mean when you say &#34;he went like crazy&#34;? Can you be more specific. What would be the point of you not getting support? Your surgeon doesn&#39;t benefit from you having a bad outcome. I can assure you of that. The question then becomes WHY are they not helping you with aftercare?

Hope tomorrow I can get a visit to the same dr, and yes he can do a culture. Surgeon started to act like crazy when I wasn&#39;t able to sleep due to a deep pain in my shoulder 6 hrs after surgery. They thought I was hallucinating the pain and then all went bad. He blamed me for the extreme swelling but the swelling was there from day 1. I requested many times a sleeping pill with no answer. At day 3 they have me one and I was able to sleep finally. But the team was awful, &#34;be patient sir&#34; and things like that. It&#39;s not a gender clinic, just private and the surgeon uses his team there. Nurses, one told that I provoked the pain in shoulder with my &#34;fesrs&#34;. BS I had another surgery 2 years ago and had the same shoulder pain and heavier than now.... it&#39;s some cervical/spinal condition. They wanted me to take haldol (they thought the pain was hallucination). I told them they were not giving humanly care too me and everything went bad from there. I know some surgeons or teams don&#39;t want to take accountabilities so they blame you for their bad praxis to avoid lawsuits. Why? They don&#39;t care and at this point the surgeon is looking for a way to cut relationship to avoid any legal action. I askee him tons of questions that weren&#39;t answered, or discarded coldly. Or answered 2 of 10 questions.
</p>
<p>
I asked why I have a lump or balloon in the internal, in the rectum, because stool was stuck there, he was nervous and deviated the talk with agressivve wording, devaluating speech and hateful tone. I asked again what it was, because it was swelling. I was never told the canal will obstruct the rectal that way. It feels like a hard balloon near sphincter. The assistant told me &#34;it&#39;s the internal edema&#34; and then changed to &#34; that&#39;s the the hematoma, it will go away, see your leg? This will go&#34;  but I was talking about the INTERNAL BALLOON not the bruising on legs, and they evaded this question every time. Why they shouldn&#39;t tell me what it was? It&#39;s really the vaginal cavity protruding the rectal wall? I can poo but it feels different now. I&#39;ve never ever heard of read about something like this. With rectal tact you can touch. You know what the surgeon asked me? &#34;Ok take pics of it and send it to me&#34;and I said &#34;how I could send pic from something that&#39;s INSIDE MY BODY?&#34; And he went crazy again, devaluating &amp; despective speech, wording, etc...denying everything, avoiding to answer and going on circles using shock speech (devaluating, depreciative) to put me down and cut the phonecall.

The lateral sides and the bottom more or less seem ok. But the medial incisions along the inner labia and the midline are open. I’m trying to be gentle with dilation, but don’t know what else I’m doing that might be causing the incisions to open.

Sometimes you don&#39;t have to do anything. In my case I have a sensitivity to VICRYL sutures. A week into recovery after their use and my body just says, No, get yout! From there it&#39;s just ugly. Typically wound dehiscence happens in the first 7 to 10 days. Twenty seems a bit long. This would have given your incisions more time to heal and resiste coming apart all the way. Is your surgeon concerned at all?

It started at day 14 when I tried the blue dilator from soul source. I was able to dilate fine with it, but the next day I noticed the incision was opening. So I have only been using the purple since then. He wasn’t concerned initially, but since it keeps opening I’m not sure if his opinion will be different. I have an appointment in a few days and was going to see what he says…
</p>
<p>
The sutures that are opening are all chromic

Here&#39;s the unfortunate reality here. There&#39;s little chance that anything can be done at this point other than to let it heal through second intention and then address any loss of width and depth then. This is the shitty part of the deal --if that is indeed the case it will at least double the recovery time. I&#39;ve been through hell and back with this very thing but I just don&#39;t see the same level of wound dehiscence as I had. This is a good thing. A very good thing. I had to back off the dilation as well and then deal with massive granulation problems. I wouldn&#39;t wish that on my worst enemy.

You might want to do a little research on Chromic sutures. Apparently they are more prone to inflammatory response than VICRYL or synthetic sutures.

yours isn&#39;t that bad, i&#39;m 12 days post op and all the stitches on one side of my vagina popped because of swelling and this damn heat,  my vagina looks so scary right now but i know it&#39;ll heal well. i have an appointment with my surgeon this wednesday i&#39;m hoping she&#39;ll say my wound dehiscence will heal fine. just comparing yours to mine, i think you&#39;re lucky

Thanks for your reassurance and I’m sorry for your sutures popping. I don’t think I’d be as concerned if this all happened at once, but it seems like it gets a little worse every time I dilate. One person had said on another question is that things get worse for a week so I’m not sure what else to expect.

The wound dehiscence started small, on day 14, and over the last 5-6 days just keeps getting worse and worse. I don’t know what I could be doing better…

Also allergic to vicryl sutures.  Heck, my vagina lining fell out and I had to keep going dilating.  No matter what happens it will look much better as things heal.

I had it after SRS, and I had it after Labioplasty. My friend had it too. There is way worse wound dehiscence cases.
