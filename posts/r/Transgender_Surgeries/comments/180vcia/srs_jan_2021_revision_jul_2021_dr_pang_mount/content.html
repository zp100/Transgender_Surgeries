I had SRS in January 2021 and a revision in July 2021 with Dr Pang while he was still at Mount Sinai in NYC.
</p>
<p>
I have consulted with Dr Márcio Littleton and made plans to have revision surgery with him hopefully next year, if I can somehow save the $20k in that time. Our surgical plan is to replace the collapsed/scarred canal with a jejunum graft, revise the labia majora to meet in the middle at the posterior fourchette and have more inward tension at anterior fourchette, reposition clitoris to be lower and more enclosed within vulva, remove excess erectile tissue. I am worried that the labia majora won&#39;t ever look normal because of how Dr Pang shaped and attached the scrotal graft; my hope is that creating two diagonal incisions at the bottom, meeting in a V below the labia minora, and tensioning the scrotal graft along them downward and inward, would fix it, but I consulted last month with Dr Bluebond-Langner and she said this wasn&#39;t possible. I think there is enough tissue there for it to be possible, and Dr Littleton said the same thing, but now I am having major doubts and worries. What do you think?

I don&#39;t have any advice unfortunately, and I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re not happy with the results.
</p>
<p>
All I can say is that from the photos you posted, the results actually look quite good to me! ✨
</p>
<p>
I hope you&#39;ll be able to have it the way you want very soon!

Hi! Thanks for responding.
</p>
<p>
I had a vaginal infection for most of 2021 and intense pain and scarring that made it such that by the second month after surgery, it would take up to 2 hours every time to get to full depth, and then another hour to size up. This process got worse until eventually I wasn&#39;t able to dilate. During the revision, Dr Pang reopened the scar rings and I was able to dilate again, but the same thing happened. Now I can only fit a finger in width/depth, but I&#39;m trying to stretch with Milli and Ram Balloon.
</p>
<p>
I also had another complication where the electrocautery machine malfunctioned during surgery, and burned me twice. This doubled my surgery time, because the surgical team decided to interrupt surgery to cut out the two burns on my mons and thigh and sew things back together before proceeding with surgery. I think this is part of why I had so much leftover skin, as the swelling likely increased more than they were used to during this time.
</p>
<p>
I definitely do need to see a therapist, lol, and my feelings about this are very intense and my ideas for revision are hyper-specific, but I disagree that it looks normal, and beyond this, it feels very uncomfortable, especially because of the lack of connection of the two labia majora at the bottom, but also because of the excess erectile tissue which swells upon arousal and because the clitoris is buried deep under the mons instead of nestled between the labia minora.
</p>
<p>
I appreciate you taking the time to reassure me and talk about this with me. It&#39;s a very isolating experience.

Imo your aesthetic results are reasonably good and I agree with closing the fourchette. but, you are not some lost cause here, especially if your results are functional. Aesthetic revisions are much less invasive, you already have a vagina. Genuinely I think you fall well within cis norms for labia. IMO. Sorry you are hurting. ♥️

If you’re interested in Dr Avanessian still she took over Pang’s patients when he left so you’d be able to get a revision with her.

Hey, thanks for the info! I asked about switching to Dr Avanessian for revision while Dr Pang was still there, but I was told she doesn&#39;t take patients from the other Mount Sinai surgeons - nice to know that&#39;s changed. I&#39;ll keep that in mind.

Yeah that’s still the case but an exception was made once Pang left. You can see either Avanessian or Horesh.

Your vulva is not as bad as you think it is. Do not try to spend thousands of money repairing the outside and inside co-currently, it&#39;ll just make it more difficult to get the outside to heal properly due to increased swelling and then dilation. Much of the reason many have this &#34;gaping open&#34; is 100% intentional, it prevents prolapse and can always be corrected later. Now I don&#39;t believe you have that, in-fact your vulvar anatomy is quite pretty, better than most. However, try to get the canal replaced with insurance, and worry about external aesthetics after you&#39;ve healed from that, around a year later. You&#39;ll save money and end up with a better result if you just wait.
</p>
<p>
It is genuinely a better result than most. I would also recommend fat transfer, it can help with labial connection and appearance.

Thanks for your insights and reassurance.
</p>
<p>
In the intervening time since making this post, I have come to similar conclusions.
</p>
<p>
I am trying to get at least partial (posterior commissure, excess erectile tissue) external revision first, then secondary vaginoplasty and any remaining cosmetic issues in a final revision.
</p>
<p>
I have been planning to do it in the opposite order of what you suggested - external revision domestically with insurance and internal revision with Dr Littleton, as he does the jejunum graft, which I like because I want an intestinal graft but I don’t want to sacrifice my colon. He also specifically has an excellent anterior commissure technique that I want, to complete everything. But we shall see how it works out.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again!

Thats good but let me inform you that the posterior commissure may have to be corrected after the vaginoplasty canal change, as that kind of opening will still be needed to be prevent prolapse and aide in dilation until healed. You can get the excess erectile tissue removed during a revision vaginoplasty, for everything else external wait.
</p>
<p>
I plan to go to Dr. Littleton for an external revision, possibly, if I want/need one. Which location do you think you&#39;ll go to? Brazil or Portugal, I wonder which would be more economical/safer.

Is that true even if I give the posterior commissure time to heal completely before secondary vaginoplasty?
</p>
<p>
Would you have the clitoris moved in my position? It feels and looks to me like it’s too far up on the mons.
</p>
<p>
Ah! Have you had SRS already, or you’re still planning it? He seems to be a great surgeon. I consulted with him and he’s also very kind and respectful and knowledgeable. I haven’t decided yet if I will go to Brazil or Portugal… I’m leaning slightly toward Portugal because I have friends there, but we will see.

The posterior commissure should be done after, doing it before will create issues, it&#39;s better to ask a very honest surgeon about this. What could happen during secondary vaginoplasty is that it gets opened again surgically for necessity and remains opened for dilation. This really does depend on the surgeons specific method but most would not do extensive external revisions until after the initial secondary vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
If the surgeon can position it further down, then sure, but they may not be able to.
</p>
<p>
And I have not. I have my date booked right now. It is for later this year.

I have not yet had surgery, but I find your revision surgeon choices very interesting because they are my top two initial surgeon choices. I&#39;m wondering which you&#39;ve picked and why, if you don&#39;t mind me asking?
