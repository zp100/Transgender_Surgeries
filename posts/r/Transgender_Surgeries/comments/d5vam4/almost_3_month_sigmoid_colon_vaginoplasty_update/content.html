Will be three months on the 20th. aesthetics wise , it&#39;s still a little swollen but it looks 100% natural , very defined labia majora and minora, and I was circumcised.
</p>
<p>
im mostly painfree and sitting is easy but I still use the donut on hard surfaces. discharge isn&#39;t alot , only sometimes after dilation a blob comes out. after srs i didn&#39;t notice much of a smell but after 2 months or so I started noticing it. it smells bad , not like what I imagined it to smell, because it&#39;s colon vaginoplasty I expected something like poo (how silly), but it smells nothing like that even though it&#39;s so bad. It doesn&#39;t smell that strong though , the other day I got a whiff of it because I just took out the last dilator (normally the discharge comes like 30 mins later for me) and as I sat up it came out lol. I don&#39;t find the discharge to be that inconvenient because I just make sure I always wear liners or a pad and I don&#39;t really feel when it comes out.
</p>
<p>
I tried masturbating about 5 times , orgasmed two out of those 5. first time there was contractions there and I assumed that was the orgasm so I was kinda let down and not actually sure that i had one but when I actually had the orgasm it was amazing. i can see it feeling a bit uncomfortable because it feels like wetting the bed , like there&#39;s a waterfall between my legs lol. haven&#39;t had sex yet so not sure on this but I think lube might still be needed or it will be uncomfy getting the penis in. from what I&#39;ve noticed it only starts lubricating by itself when there&#39;s something already inside.
</p>
<p>
dilation is still uncomfy and a bit of a hassle , I don&#39;t like it at all. my dilators are really wide and I remember reading that dilators need to be extra wide for colon vaginoplasty. the depth is alot because the dilators almost go in all the way and they&#39;re quite long.
</p>
<p>
my bowel movements are mostly back to normal and I eat like before. sneezing can be painful depending on the position I&#39;m in when I sneeze.
</p>
<p>
overall I&#39;m extremely happy with the results and would choose my surgeon again if I had to do it from over.
</p>
<p>
oh I also had VFS and tracheal shave. my voice sounds 100% natural even though I was afraid of CTA, my results are great. it has a bit of a husky quality to it , not a masculine type of husky but a normal feminine type. I was worried before about it sounding high pitched and cartoon like. I was told it will change more over the next few months
</p>
<p>
feel free to AMA

A few questions. Who was your surgeon, what depth do you have, and how often do you dilate?

Dr kaushik, olmec clinic
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll measure my dilators later but if I have to give an estimate I would guess around the length of a 30 cm ruler? idk.
</p>
<p>
according to surgeon twice a day for 6 months but I dilate once a day for a long time. those dilators are really fat , can&#39;t see myself doing that twice a day. I&#39;ll also dilate occasionally after the 6 months to be safe

Thanks, there&#39;s not much info available on Kaushik. I&#39;ll add this to the wiki.
</p>
<p>
Would you reccomend him to others? Any positive or negative points?
</p>
<p>
What did it cost and how long was the wait list?

Genital Surgery Cost= PACKAGE FOR 30 Days= 9700 USD (includes to and fro- airport to hospital pick up and drop,  wi-fi, medicines, and consumables for surgery, dilator set and 30 days hospital stay).     Breakup for cost for Complete Genital SRS is as follows-- Surgical cost- USD $ 7300,    Additional charges-   1.      Stay - 50 USD per day (required stay is 30 days)= 1500 USD. 2.      Medicines after surgery- 300 USD (as per requirement) 3.      Food charges as per total consumption-  300 USD 4.      Investigations 300 USD (if done here)

<p>
Voice Feminization; 850 USD plus 18 percent GST Tracheal Shave costing :850 USD plus 18 percent GST
</p>
<p>
this is prices I was sent few months ago
</p>
<p>
positive points are all mentioned but for negative points i would have to think hard. first one that comes to mind is how challenging the recovery is. for the hospital itself it&#39;s hard to think of any negative points really. I was lucky enough to have my surgery after they moved to the new building , apparently the old one was not very nice
</p>
<p>
wait list wasn&#39;t long because like. I booked about a month or two in advance to the date I wanted

Would you mind sharing your costs for the procedures?  I&#39;m currently planning out my bottom surgery but it seems like many people are doing multiple procedures at once.  Therefore I would also like to consider doing the same since that&#39;s an option.

yup it&#39;s his standard procedure. he also offers another one that I forgot the name which is essentially another part of the bowel but only does that if the colon can&#39;t be used
</p>
<p>
I chose this procedure because lubrication and depth was important to me , and having a vagina as close as possible to a cis one. as for choice of doctor I admit affordability was the main one. other doctors charge way more than penile inversion for this

I want to first see how it will look after 6 months before I decide ! I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a time frame. I read from some people&#39;s experience that the doctor normally does it in the last week of your stay there assuming you stay a full 4 weeks but I had to go after 2

Thanks for write up.. I thought dilation is not painful with this type of surgery.. is it very tight? Can a larger dildo or penis fit?

<p>
it&#39;s not
<em>
that
</em>
painful , more like really uncomfortable. mine is very tight at first but the first dilator which is very small and made out of foam helps to initially open it abit before the other dilators, and it can stretch ALOT. don&#39;t know if all sigmoid colon patients need to do this too but the dilators we&#39;re given by olmec are really really thick. fat even. I assume it&#39;s to stretch the scar tissue and something to do with the peritoneal muscles or something like that pressing on the graft so I think width of dilators is more important than length for this procedure
</p>
<p>
the only times dilation is painful is when , idk if this is normal I been lazy to ask what it is but I assume it&#39;s a wind , sometimes creates like pressure towards the end of the vagina tunnel if I can call it that and then I feel like squeezing contractions that force the dilators out. but this doesn&#39;t happen often and I noticed happens less when I lay flat on my back (I sometimes dilate with my shoulders propped up on the wall behind me )

Are you cleared to try intercourse?  Can you replicate a feeling like the tip of the penis or urethra?  Does vaginal dilation feel good yet?  Curious about ongoing updates!!
