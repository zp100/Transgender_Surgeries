BBL is highly capable, she did my SRS. She and Dr. Zhao had already done two revisions before they got to me on Surgery Day.
</p>
<p>
As far as what to do? Not a medical expert, but try to maintain as much width and depth as you can. Which dilator are you on? It might be too wide at the end, where loss of depth and width first manifest according to my team. Another option is to use a smaller dilator for the first 5-10 minutes, and then finish with your normal size. If the smaller dilator causes less pain, I would personally recommend using that instead until you can get in for a revision. Best of luck, hon

SS also makes a P2, one size smaller than blue.

How often did you dilate and did you keep up with it?  For the first problem was it always like that?
</p>
<p>
For the second problem you could look for a trans friendly gyno/women&#39;s health and they could take a look inside. Maybe you have granulation or something deep down, it shouldnâ€™t hurt how you describe

I tried to dilate as much as I could but I ended up have a lot of separation on both sides of my labia. Like, a lot. It was really painful just to exist for a bit as I was bed ridden from the initial recovery for almost 3 months.
</p>
<p>
Yeah I&#39;m searching around for a trans friendly gyno. The one&#39;s I&#39;ve been too so far, while not against lgbt people, would just deflect onto another surgeon/gyno than try to help.

I&#39;ve heard of revisions to fix the tightness at the entrance.
</p>
<p>
Have you had an internal inspection for the pain at depth? Sounds kind of like granulation.
</p>
<p>
Who was your surgeon?

That&#39;s pretty poor treatment by Bowers.
</p>
<p>
Have you tried putting lidocaine cream on the dilator for the internal pain? I don&#39;t think your normally supposed to as it can interfere with healing, but you&#39;re well past that point.

I don&#39;t have anything to add, but I am curious about the last 2&#34; comment.  What technique did your surgeon do?  Is that just standard PI with scrotal skin at the end or was another material used?  When getting the last 2&#34; does it hurt at the very end, along the entire length, or say along a scar line?
</p>
<p>
Has it hurt like this for the last two years and never got any better?
