<p>
I&#39;m back home now!
</p>
<p>
I just wanted to share my thoughts now that I&#39;m decently over 1 month post OP. I feel like everything has gone fairly smoothly for me, that said, I think my results aren&#39;t anything out of the ordinary and talking to the others I think most girls who are young, fit and healthy will have pretty smooth sailing.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Dilation hasn&#39;t been that bad for me - it&#39;s a hassle and a chore, but I don&#39;t find it particularly painful or difficult. Maybe that will change in the next few months, apparently months 2-3 is when it tends to peak in difficulty for most people but it varies. I should also mention I had a stitch that was dragging on the dilator that was extremely painful, and when I told Dr. Bank about it, he removed the stitch for me at around 3 weeks which made it 10x better, so if you&#39;re having issues make sure you mention it because it might be an easy fix. The speed at which dilation difficulty peaks is dependent on how fast you heal, so if you&#39;re a fast healer dilation will be more rough, but presumably you&#39;d also be able to cut down on dilation faster.
</li>
<li>
Aesthetically, it looks absolutely amazing! Honestly I was already impressed at D10, but at 1mo+ I&#39;m even more impressed! Swelling has improved dramatically. I think my results are quite standard for uncircumcised and no major complications. Frankly, my results basically blow everything that isn&#39;t Suporn/Bank out of the water. There is simply no comparison, and no surgeon in the world even comes close. I can say Dr. Bank is hands down the best SRS surgeon in the world, he is just on a different level to everyone else. Caveat - if you&#39;re circumcised you will not get nearly as good of a result, more on that later. But that also applies to most other surgeons as well. Maybe I will post a picture on a throwaway account some day....
</li>
<li>
Complications - I had some minor trivial necrosis of my clit and labia, which happens to about 30-40% of people. I also had about 2-3mm of detachment of the tip of one of my labia, Dr. Bank threw a stitch in a week before I left and it reattached without issues. I also had a lot of urethral irritation which made me want to pee all the time and also made it hurt to pee. I did wonder if it was a UTI, but I had no bladder discomfort and the clinic agreed that it was urethral irritation. That&#39;s settled down now.
</li>
<li>
Circumcision really affects your result - I saw the result of two other girls&#39; who had been circumcised when I was there and there really isn&#39;t enough tissue to build all of the structures to the same degree as if you weren&#39;t circumcised. I also suspect that girls who are circumcised will also have more issues with pain, granulation and necrosis as both of these girls had quite a number of these issues, and it was quite evident that a big part of that is due to simply insufficient tissue and higher tension on the stitches to get everything to close properly. Dr. Bank also mentioned the same thing. Unfortunately this is just the nature of the surgery and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much the surgeon can do to fix these issues.
</li>
<li>
Pain and suffering - the pain isn&#39;t that bad per se, but the combination of constant cleaning, dilation and constant pain is exhausting and I was going a bit crazy at 2-3 weeks post OP whilst in Thailand. I feel much better now, but I still need to take paracetamol, celecoxib, and 1-2 tramadol a day.
</li>
<li>
Social and supports - I went by myself. I really missed my partner, but I didn&#39;t feel lonely. You will meet some lovely people as long as you don&#39;t go around the times where the clinic has its holiday shutdown period. There&#39;s always about 20-30 girls around at all times (but I feel like half of them hide in their rooms haha.) I think it&#39;s a very lovely and unique experience since only Suporn clinic keeps such a big number of patients around for such a long period of time. I feel like we take up half the hotel and it felt like living in a dorm of trans girls. The hotel has buffet breakfast included and we always had breakfast together, in addition to quite a few social events that we self organised through the discord (movie nights, dinner together, etc.) I definitely made a few friends that I will keep in touch with for life. The clinic also arranges for you to go on a beach house trip during your stay.
</li>
<li>
Recovery - apparently I am made from nails, but I went out to buy dinner at a restaurant just outside the hotel on the day of discharge, and by d14 I was regularly walking to the nearby supermarket (700m round trip). You&#39;re not allowed to walk for 5 days after surgery and I was actually very wobbly and dizzy on D6 which is when you&#39;re allowed to walk again, that took about 4-5 days to resolve. I used a walking stick until day 14 and walked very slowly. I was also constantly sleeping and exhausted post OP and only started getting my energy back by week 3. By the time I was leaving Thailand I could easily walk several kilometers unaided, although I&#39;m still pretty sore. The clinic staff told me off for walking so much and all the other girls were calling me crazy but anyway. . . The clinic recommends you order food using Grab delivery or use room service for the first  7 days after discharge. I flew economy home (10 hours to Australia) which was totally fine, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to fly economy if I lived in Europe or America.
</li>
<li>
Time off - I work as a junior doctor in a hospital, so I have no intention to go back to work until I cut down my dilation to once a day, which is usually 6 months. It&#39;s quite common to be on my feet all day, and also end up staying at work for 14+ hours and having to go back to work at 8am the next day, so trying to manage dilation twice a day and work at the same time would be suicide. If I was working from home or I had a desk job and also could dilate at work, I could probably go back to work right now.
</li>
<li>
Depth - approximately 14 to 15cm. Suporn technique depth is limited by the physical depth of your pelvic cavity, he basically keeps on going until he hits bone. I am quite short in terms of height so 14/15cm is about right. Most cis women actually have about 9-15cm of depth (average is probably around 12cm) so if a guy can&#39;t fit in you he&#39;s not gonna fit in 90% of cis women. Most of the other girls got more than me - some 18, even 20cm because I&#39;m so short.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
â€‹
</p>
<p>
4 Minor aesthetic differences regarding the results compared to natal vaginas. Caveat - I am a doctor, so I&#39;m probably more familiar with vaginas compared to the average person. Aesthetically I still think my vagina looks great, but I think it should be pointed out. These are the features that I would describe are &#34;evidence&#34; that I&#39;ve had SRS, and these are also very distinct of the Suporn technique and you will see them on all girls who have had the Suporn technique.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The posterior (butt end) of the vulva isn&#39;t shaped correctly. Suporn technique uses a flap of the perineal skin to form the posterior wall of the vagina, so the labia minora kind of form a triangular shape rather than touch at the posterior end. The perineal raphe will also be visible going into the vagina. The reason for this is the tips of the labia are too delicate to tolerate the stress of dilation so there&#39;s a small gap (approximately 1.5cm.)
<strong>
This can be sorted in a free revision, and is a very common revision
</strong>
- you can&#39;t dilate for at least a month afterwards, so it is best to have it done at least 1 year after the primary surgery. The raphe can also be removed in a revision. There was one girl whose old appendage was very large, so her labia actually do meet, but most girls will have this issue.
</li>
<li>
Prominent urethral tissue - the urethra sticks out a little because of the way the surgery is done. Imagine you got a rubber tube and turned it inside out, you&#39;d get a bit of a donut shape. Most girls will have this issue,
<strong>
and can also be fixed in a free revision
</strong>
.
</li>
<li>
Chonburi organs - the remainder of the glans that isn&#39;t used to form the clit is stitched together and placed under the clit. It looks like two small sausage shaped bumps just under the clit. For girls with a large appendage, this can be quite a big structure. It&#39;s unique to the Suporn technique, and whilst aesthetically some may complain that it looks different to a cis vagina, it has the advantage of preserving as much sensation as possible. In the event of clit necrosis, it can also be used to reconstruct the clit.
<strong>
This can be removed or reduced in size in a free revision, but you will lose sensation
</strong>
.
</li>
<li>
Wide anterior fourchette - the labia minora are made from dividing the penis down the middle (vertically). For many girls the point at which the labia touch at the top can be a bit wide. My appendage was quite petite, so I didn&#39;t have this issue.
<strong>
Can also be fixed in a free revision.
</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you get all 4 aesthetic differences sorted, and presuming you don&#39;t have necrosis, you&#39;d end up with a vagina that looks 100% cis except for the scars.
</p>
<p>
These differences in my case are both minor, and purely aesthetic, so I&#39;m still undecided as to whether I do want to go for a revision, but Dr. Bank said he&#39;s happy to have me back in a year&#39;s time haha.
</p>
<p>
I probably will post a 3 and 6 month update on sex and what not.

I knew Dr. Bank was great, but gosh your experience sounds amazing. Iâ€™m currently saving up for it and ffs. I am definitely recommending him to other girls. I canâ€™t believe the revision is free. To good to be true.

Do you know if it&#39;s possible for Dr. Bank to prioritize a thinner anterior fourchette (as you described) if that&#39;s a concern? Out of all of my concerns with the aesthetic results that&#39;s the one I&#39;d really like to not go for a revision for if I can help it.

You could ask him, but I don&#39;t think so. Mine was quite narrow because my old appendage was quite small.

This post is definitely helping me to understand the postop problems. Despite the differences compare with cis women, his aesthetic of vagina is incredible and most beautiful I ever seen. Thank you so much. But I still got some problems. I saw their website mentioned two recommendation letters(referral) are required in order to have the surgery. Is the clinic offer one of the letter? And how can I get another letter from psychosexual psychiatrist? Are online meeting and digital letter accept?

Thank you for sharing your experience and your thoughts as a doctor! Iâ€™m now reconsidering SRS now. Iâ€™m very sad to hear about the experience with other girls who were circumcised before. I am circumcised and have experienced a significant amount of shrinkage. Iâ€™m under 2 inches now flaccid ðŸ˜ž

Hi!  I know this is an older post, so I hope you don&#39;t mind me popping in with a couple questions.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Hearing about circumcision is saddening as I am circumcised.  However, would that be offset at all by genital size?  You mentioned being on the smaller size there but if someone were 7&#34; or so (erect), would that make a difference with the amount of tissue to work with?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Some of these revisions sound like they were after 2 weeks.  Did you just stay around for a long time past the 2 weeks or fly back for revisions or...?
</p>

Did you ever get an answer to your first question?From what ive read from suporn&#39;s paper i dont think genital size would make up for being circumcised:
</p>
<p>
&#34;the inner layer of the prepuce has similar texture, color and quality as the inner surface of the labia minora in a genetic female. Prepuce is also innervated with erogenous sensory receptors. The prepuce of penis is considered to be the most appropriate donor tissue for the inner surface of labia minora reconstruction, not only for the satisfactory aesthetic result but also for enhancement of sexual sensation&#34;
</p>
<p>
Still, in the same paper he says 43% of the patients were circumcised, but only 27% of all patients had to undergo type B labia minora reconstruction (the one that doesn&#39;t use the frenulum, so they still make do with the little tissue there is in circumcised patients

I notice that lots of doctors on the west really donâ€™t like tramadol. Itâ€™s got quite a reputation as a dirty drug. I think Tapapentadol is supposed to be the alternative, but canâ€™t say I ever tried it.

I don&#39;t like tramadol. It&#39;s an old drug that has been superseded by tapentadol if we are after a dual action opioid analgesic. I never prescribe tramadol as there are just better options. But in Thailand I took tramadol and codeine because it&#39;s what the clinic had and it&#39;s included in your surgery fee, if you want other opioids you have to pay out of pocket and it can be a bit expensive. I&#39;m not even sure if tapentadol is available in Thailand, even in Australia it&#39;s quite expensive.
</p>
<p>
The traditional teaching is you start off with a weak/moderate opioid such as tramadol or codeine, and if that isn&#39;t enough then you give a strong opioid. But the current understanding is that tramadol and codeine both have their individual issues. As you mentioned tramadol is a dirty drug - it&#39;s an SNRI in addition to being an opioid and can cause issues in combination with antidepressants. In addition, the analgesic effect can be unreliable, as tramadol itself has no opioid receptor affinity, and rather relies on metabolism to desmetramadol to be effective as an opioid painkiller. Codeine has similar issues to tramadol in that it too requires metabolism to morphine in order to exert its analgesic effects. I.e. both tramadol and codeine are prodrugs, and when you&#39;re dealing with something like opioid painkillers it&#39;s not ideal for them to have such an unpredictable response.
</p>
<p>
The reason why tramadol and codeine was used was concerns for addiction with stronger opioids, but the reality is the solution to preventing addiction is wiser prescribing rather than resorting to inferior drugs. They also have a much lower dose ceiling, so if you&#39;re not getting pain under control with these drugs you have to switch opioids, which is a pain (literally.)
</p>
<p>
I will always prefer to prescribe a lower dose of a strong opioid (e.g. oxycodone, morphine, tapentadol) over tramadol or codeine. They are more reliable and it is easier to titrate the dose if we aren&#39;t getting adequate analgesia. Tapentadol also has less SNRI effects which reduce the risk of side effects.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Bank provides most of the medical care and makes most of the decisions regarding prescribing. The facilities are state of the art, and obviously he&#39;s a great surgeon, but as you can see, I&#39;m not particularly impressed by his prescribing skills hahaha. To be fair, surgeons generally aren&#39;t great at this kind of stuff even in Australia... Apart from my gripes with tramadol and codeine, they also prescribe pethidine which is a very old fashioned drug. Basically, when it comes to the medical prescribing, I&#39;d say it&#39;s 10-20 years out of date. I asked one of the clinic staff who Dr. Bank asks for advice, and she said Dr. Suporn, so I guess that explains it. Other than that, the nurses and in hospital care was great. I wrote more comments about the issues I had with the medications in my last post. I could go into a lot more detail about all the little gripes about Dr. Bank&#39;s medication prescribing... but that will take forever. I mean, pain management is a whole specialty on its own. Ultimately though it&#39;s not a huge issue, I mean you&#39;re there for the surgery not for Dr. Bank&#39;s prescribing skills, what he had was adequate and I didn&#39;t want to rock the boat too much.
</p>
<p>
In regards to how good the healthcare system is overall, I can&#39;t really comment from the perspective of a patient as I didn&#39;t have any complications or issues at the end of the day that required any serious medical input apart from what Dr. Bank was already doing. However, I can comment on the healthcare system since I actually did a placement at Chulalongkorn Hospital as a medical student, and it was truly state of the art. Although Chula is probably the best hospital in Thailand, I&#39;m pretty confident if there were any major issues I&#39;d be in good hands even in Chonburi.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t see any post revision results in person. There are a lot on the Suporn discord servers but you have to have a confirmed booking date with the clinic. The results are about as good as you&#39;d expect (i.e. very good.)

This is moreso regarding the process of applying for the surgery in the first place, but I haven&#39;t been able to find any reliable information anywhere else. How many times did you apply for a surgery date before you were actually selected? And did you apply every available opportunity, or just every once in a while? I&#39;m trying to gauge how long the average time it takes for someone to actually selected.

I&#39;d say email the clinic since it&#39;s always changing. My surgery was actually booked pre-COVID and was postponed by 2 years so I can&#39;t really give any input on this.
