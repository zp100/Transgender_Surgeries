<p>
for me its about 12.5 to 13 cm depth (which is enough for dilating since apperantly i can take lager things like my boyfriend when erect😅)
</p>
<p>
Also changed dilation plan to only include number 5 and 5LS
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 20
</li>
</ul>
<p>
was at my gynecologist again. She said it all looks pretty good and is thrilled cause of the good outcome outside and inside. She also said that i have  mucous  inside and thats good and its feeling natural and healing is also good.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 21
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I might have come to a connection between my E3 gels and the discharge i have especially in the morning (but dont wanna stop using it for my scars and therefore still have to deal with it)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 22
</li>
</ul>
<p>
i dont have any trouble inserting 5 Ls anymore, i mean depth is over for me but width is also good now :3 (planned to introduce the Number 6 sometime)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 23
</li>
</ul>
<p>
nothing interesting happend
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 24
</li>
</ul>
<p>
changed dilation plan to Vagiwell Number 5 and 5 LS, 25 min each, 1 time a day
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 25
</li>
</ul>
<p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
tried to changed dilation plan to 5LS 25 min 1 time a day (was okish, only have done it yesterday so time will tell  😅 )
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What i want to be done in revision (2nd stage) (last picture in imgur link with the marks)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
the scar on the right side (in pic) is shitty, i guess i have done to much to early and its not nice and kinda hard, also hurts sometimes and on tension pretty much 24/7
</p>
<p>
the vaginal opening, maybe so i dont have to go from top to insert stuff but just in a straight line, also scar correction cause of my wound separation
</p>
<p>
Labia minora is going inside the vagina from top, i want that they are on the outer side like the should be.
</p>
<p>
labia majora on the upper side, both are kinda balloonish and its shitty and sometimes dysphoric cause sometimes it just look like my balls are just up there now. Most likely to much fat tissue or other stuff in there and not swelling (skin is elastic and it dont hurt on touch)
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What they want to do in 2nd stage (according to
<a href="https://www.lubos-kliniken.de/fachbereiche/transgenderzentrum/mann-zu-frau/einzelschritte-der-op/">website (german)
</a>
)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Enlargement plastic of the vaginal entrance
</p>
<p>
building Mons Pubis
</p>
<p>
making clitoral hodd
</p>
<p>
correction of labia minora and majora
</p>
<p>
(if necessary) remove erectile tissue and widening of urethra
</p>
<p>
So this was my Recap for month 3 to 6 (week 13 to 26), hope you liked it, if you have any questions i am going to answer them and then see you soon in May (there is my revision) where i am going to do weekly updates again

Your welcome :3

I&#39;ve seen some others made a good in depth post (this is years ago) and I kinda tried to do the same so I am able to get the most value out of my threads :3

2nd surgery is end of April.
</p>
<p>
I am definitely going to share the results to and will make weekly threads again. And most likely write about the pre examination in the first thread too. :3
</p>
<p>
Also thank you very much :3

Does one even have to accommodate all of them for it to turn out healthy? Maybe it&#39;s the picture&#39;s perspective, but the size seems a bit sex toy fantasy like rather than any real equipment.

The 5LS is like my boyfriend in all regards. But sex was already possible with the 5. It&#39;s just in case and the 6 would be if revision hasn&#39;t done to much so he can insert easier.

Well, have fun I guess I can only say. My husband&#39;s dead, so... Just relish anything you can. Even the smallest, asexual things. I wish you well.
</p>
<p>
I just realised that dilation and a mild penis phobia will not go well together. Woupps. Some days are worse than others. Sexual trauma and frustration at once, it&#39;s a spicy combination. I hope not constantly being confronted by one helps.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I&#39;ll skip on the 6...

Are you diligent about hair removal or is that hair removed prior to/during surgery?

That is a good thing (not having hair inside the vagina). I am hoping to keep hair on my mons/around my neo-vagina just wondering about what surgeons tend to do.

Thanks for all the details!!!
</p>
<p>
I had my appointment with Dr. Markovsky two weeks ago and he told me that wetness isn&#39;t a thing with their method.  Is there a way to explain your wet kitty after your week 14 dream? I&#39;d like to have that ability too and am therefore hesitant to choose Markovskys team over Taskov or Morath... Again thank you for all the information! ❤

It&#39;s ymmv, if you are able to get wet pre surgery it&#39;s most likely you will have the ability post op.
</p>
<p>
The organs (prostate) is still there and able to produce fluids.
</p>
<p>
I guess they mean with it that it&#39;s not like wetness in a cis vagina.

Thanks :3
</p>
<p>
I mean I was on the dryer side already with HRT and have to admit that this wetness was a 1 time thing till now. Squirting yes but without lube penetration isn&#39;t fun at all.
</p>
<p>
Also schaff&#39;s method is similar in this regard. You can&#39;t just get wet out of nowhere :/

Oh ok. :/
</p>
<p>
Yeah I know that &#34;out of nowhere&#34; wetness isn&#39;t possible at all, sadly. But a baseline wetness seems possible with other methods. At least according to other girls I talked to. Idk...
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t wanna bother you any longer. :&gt; Thanks for your answers.

You don&#39;t bother me at all :3
</p>
<p>
It all comes down to your prostate. Schaff is then using urethra lining in the vagina and Liedl between urethra and clitoris. That&#39;s the major difference.
</p>
<p>
Dunno how this should even achieve a baseline wetness and would also guess schaff just had got marketing again with his procedure compared to liedl.
</p>
<p>
Also those are the only 2 major methods done here in Germany so 🤷‍♀️

Taskov is also using the urethra lining inside the neovagina.  Markovkys explanation why this shouldn&#39;t help with wetness seems quite flawless to me.... My next Appointment is with Taskov next week. I&#39;m very interested how his explanation on this feel like.

Which also is a ymmv if you are dry like a desert in the first place nothing can be done about it  And since a lot of cis women also need lube it&#39;s not as a big deal in my opinion

I have 0 clue how it was developed but she said it&#39;s there, also kinda hard to explain cause English isn&#39;t my first language and I translated it from German &#34;Schleimhaut&#34;.

I still think the labia minora shouldn&#39;t connect to each other like they do, I would talk to the surgeons about this, this is not anatomical correct at least for natal born

Nope they didn&#39;t told me, but I did it anyway cause I noticed that I got more depth till that timeframe
</p>
<p>
And I was on 5 when I got released already, and then I was keep going.
</p>
<p>
Didn&#39;t noticed anything with delayed healing in this regards.
