It happened to me too after ffs.  most of it has grown back, and I‚Äôm still getting some new growth along the incision margin 18 months later.  I think having the hairline advance and stretching the scalp to reduce the corners near the temples thinned the follicle density.

I am happy if this could illuminate some things for you. I will say I think I am on the more rare end of possible side effects and I wouldn&#39;t really say its likely to happen from everything I had ever seen on here and otherwise. Most of the time hair loss is really just around the scar. Now if that is just bias because people haven&#39;t reported it or what I don&#39;t know üòï.
</p>
<p>
Given what I know now though I would definitely discuss it with your surgeon and see what their after care is like and what things could be done to mitigate it if you are worried about it. It was definitely so shocking to me because I had never really had issues with my hair before and didn&#39;t really even give a second thought to the possibility of this happening.
</p>
<p>
Again I would totally still do it again, I hope things go well for you!

I can‚Äôt imagine how distressing this would be. üíú But can totally imagine the vicious cycle of anxiety causing loss / inhibiting regrowth.
</p>
<p>
Best I can offer is an anecdote: A friend of mine had her hairline advanced/ forehead reduced about 6 months ago. She abruptly lost about a third of her hair, diffusely spread across her head. Her Dr said it‚Äôs not unusual but also not common. After 6 mos she‚Äôs having okay regrowth using nutrafol (or similar) and not minoxidil or finasteride.
<br>
Trouble is, hair is so slow, it‚Äôs hard to notice positive change‚Ä¶
<br>
Wish you well hon, and Really Appreciate you sharing!

Thanks so much for the positive vibes, it means a lot!

That definitely gives me hope, my deepest fear is definitely that it just won&#39;t come back. I will definitely have to check that out, I am pretty close to just trying anything haha.

i had a case of alopecia when i was stressed with school work and my mom passing away. the doctor said the stress could‚Äôve caused my body to prioritize other parts and my hair was not a priority for my body.
</p>
<p>
i was given some anxiety meds and my hair started to grow back! but!! it‚Äôs now permanently gray. i dye it nowadays but if i let it grow out, i look like a skunk with a patch of my grays on my head.

Yah, my doctor mentioned that as well. I have never had surgery before so this was definitely a first for me. I am guessing I am just unlucky at this point haha.
</p>
<p>
Honestly anxiety meds may not be a bad idea, it is definitely hard just not to fixate on it and of course hair is so dang slow growing lol. Having a cute gray spot is cool, you can have a neat Rogue vibe going on :)

Hey you! Check out this link:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321590#:%7E:text=Telogen%20effluvium%20is%20a%20form,loss%20disorder%20called%20alopecia%20areata">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321590#:~:text=Telogen%20effluvium%20is%20a%20form,loss%20disorder%20called%20alopecia%20areata</a>
.
</p>
<p>
What this is, I&#39;m pretty sure, is something I went through too after FFS. It&#39;s called Telogen Effluvium, and it&#39;s essentially
<em>
temporary
</em>
trauma induced hair loss.  You should expect this to recover in about 6 months.
</p>
<p>
As a fellow trans woman that suffered from hair loss, I&#39;m so, so sorry this happened to you.  So for now, focus on your other options - wigs, hats, scarves - and with any luck you&#39;ll have your beautiful locks back in no time ‚ù§

Given the extensive hair loss in such a short period and the occurrence right after the compression wrap post op it is more likely to be pressure-induced alopecia. Telogen effluvium is a more gradual shedding that occurs over time usually several months after the stressful event, whereas PA is often more acute and occurs within 3-28¬†days following a pressure event. Additionally, with TE, it is usually less than 50% of the hair that is lost at a time.

Fair enough, but either way it&#39;s temporary, no?
</p>
<p>
I was just personally disappointed that the doctors didn&#39;t even mention TE when I asked specifically about hair loss.

I can definitely see how that would be disappointing for you. I&#39;ve had an unexpected and significant side effect from a medication before because a doctor failed to communicate the risk I specifically asked about.
</p>
<p>
For the question, is it temporary, the answer is a little more complicated than yes/no. The alopecia in PA is the result of ischemic injury (inadequate blood flow) to the skin resulting in hypoxia (absence of enough oxygen to maintain cell function). Depending on the degree of hypoxia, it can result in scarring. Studies of other surgeries that have resulted in PA show that while it is often temporary (non-scarring alopecia), scarring alopecia resulting in permanent hair loss can occur.
</p>
<p>
With TE it is reversible as the hairs have simply entered the telogen phase at a higher rate, greater than 10% whereas normally 6% to 8% are in the telogen phase at any given time.
</p>
<p>
Either way, the solution is often to consult with a dermatologist and then wait and see.

Totally get that, good news it I think what happened to me is on the pretty rare side. Most likely it seems like around the incision is more common, but still temporary. I can&#39;t say for sure just yet, but I have been told everything should grow back and I would assume even if this did happen to you the follicles would still be okay and things would go back to normal with time without another transplant.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully I will have some updates by april (hair grow so dang slow lol) so hopefully that could ease some fears for you! Overall thought I wouldn&#39;t worry and I am sure things will turn out well for you &lt;3

Thanks so much, the support really means a ton &lt;3! I would definitely be lying if I said I was strong all the time, its definitely hard, but being negative won&#39;t fix anything ü•≤! Hopefully this can help someone in the future üôÇ

Wow.  I am so terribly sorry.  I love that you are staying positive, and that will help your hair grow faster!
</p>
<p>
On hair regrowth tips, my guess is you could write a doctoral thesis on it with all your research, but anecdotally, exercise, sleep, and a good diet (lots of protein) helped me.
</p>
<p>
I also use a embarrassingly large amount of minoxidil - and it has helped me a lot in re-growing the area around my temples.  Like after 12 months, you cannot tell there used to be no hair there.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I wish you healing.  Thanks for being you :)

i am so sorry this happened. this is my worst fear. i have FFS in a few days and i‚Äôm prepared for this but hoping for the best. i have decided that if my hair is to fall out to this degree i will 100% shave my head and wait for it to grow back. wishing you maximum regrowth!

Thanks you! Best of  luck on your surgery, I am sure it will go great! I wouldn&#39;t stress too bad, it sucks but time has made it easier and thankfully hair will grow back. Things could definitely be worse.

It happened to me as well. I started taking multi vitamins. Biotin and liquid iron. When I started taking the iron I noticed right away how my hair stopped shedding. So I will recommend to take iron that will help to stop further loss and with regrowth. While you wait for the everything to get back to normal you can get a nice hd lace wig. Dm me if you want help with wigs. üòâ
