<strong>
Please note, there&#39;s an extensive and detailed set of points re sigmoid-segment SRS below - which are not commonly understood. I should have included/referenced in the title.
</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Going as &#39;pink&#39; as possible isn&#39;t a neovagina &#39;feature&#39; trans girls commonly consider. I didn&#39;t give it a single thought. However, I would now rate it as at least equal #1 priority. If you want to look natural, you might consider &#39;pink&#39; and what I explain below.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Few things are more cis female-like than pink. Hence why it&#39;s a slang term for pussy.
</p>
<p>
For instance, consider the image below, which is from a published paper featuring a cis female who&#39;s had a neovagina canal created with a sigmoid-segment (her labia and clitoris and vagina canal opening are natural). Notice how very &#39;simple&#39; and minimal her labia are (not even any labia majora to speak of) - but that the amount of pink makes a huge difference and just makes everything look so very aesthetic and cis female natural.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The only trans girl neovaginas with noticeable pink tissue which I have seen are PI, and able to be done by only one or two surgeons.
</p>
<p>
2) Re: Sigmoid-segment neovagina: Don&#39;t think a trans girl sigmoid-segment based neovagina will necessarily be as hidden as the cis girl above (who obviously already had an existing vaginal opening, just not a vaginal canal).
</p>
<p>
In contrast to the above image, the main issue with a sigmoid-segment is that it is bright cherry-red and commonly quite visible (though not always, depending on surgeon&#39;s technique). Bright cherry-red is not pink and bright cherry-red is not typically associated with vaginas in most peoples minds.
</p>
<p>
As per my other main posts in this sub, though my case was extreme, for many trans girls who&#39;ve had sigmoid based SRS, the same issue exists - i.e. that the segment and it&#39;s bright cherry-red color is visible.
</p>
<p>
The reason for the visibility of the sigmoid-segment is several-fold:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Most surgeons bring the sigmoid-segment right to the outside tissues - where they suture/fix it in position. To achieve this, the area where the segment is sutured to the outside needs to be of adequate width, which creates an unnatural flatness to the neovagina entrance - and which for various reasons is often positioned below the labia (and thus the labia are not able to hide it/the canal entrance). Given the larger flat area required (for attaching the segment) along with the attachment area typically needing to be below the labia, this canal opening area becomes more visible and difficult to hide/obscure - which in turn, means the segment is more visible. For some, the result they are left with is just a large visible opening with cherry-red tissue showing.
</li>
<li>
A sigmoid-segment is a substantial &#39;tunnel&#39; of tissue. It&#39;s double-walled, with a few millimeters between the walls. The segment is typically fixed/sutured at the back, at the sacrum - and then as above, to the outside tissues of the neovagina. So there is a distance between these two points. However, the distance between the two points (likely) changes slightly depending on bodily position, for instance, whether sat, laying flat, squatting, kneeling, etc. But the sigmoid-segment length is fixed - and is a fairly robust &#39;tunnel&#39; of tissue. Thus depending on position, its frontal edge therefore moves forwards and backwards slightly. Meaning that though its cherry-red might not be visible in one position (say laying on back), in another position such as sitting or squatting, it will become visible because it&#39;s front edge will push forward. [Note the same changing distance/length issue doesn&#39;t affect PI or PVT as they are very thin tissues and don&#39;t form a substantial/semi-rigid tunnel of tissue.
</li>
<li>
Being double walled, though the outer wall of a sigmoid-segment might be sutured in place, the inner wall is still relatively free to move/slide a centimeter or so forwards and backwards.
</li>
<li>
As detailed in one of my previous posts, in most cases (though not all) the surgeon a trans girl books for her SRS surgery will not be the surgeon doing the work with the sigmoid-segment. Rather the main surgeon will contract in a colon surgeon (who the patient will likely never meet and/or might never even know about or vet). Re this contracted-in surgeon&#39;s task, because the effect of cutting the sigmoid-segment too short would be a show-stopper in multiple respects (such as restricting blood flow), there is a natural tendency for them to allow a &#39;margin of error&#39; and make it longer than its ideal length. This will then mean the segment&#39;s cherry-red will likely be more visible.
</li>
<li>
The surgeon at OLMEC had a very rational and smart idea. Do a semi-PI and attach the sigmoid-segment higher up inside (to the PI sheath). However, five years back when I managed to follow-up approx 4-5 patients (as I was considering going there), most of them still had the cherry-red of the segment visible. I presume this was because this issue of changing distance between front and back attachment points still affected visibility (i.e. even if the forward attachment for the segment is made &#39;inside&#39;, in certain body positions, it still pushes forward enough to be visible).
</li>
<li>
Sigmoid and PVT essentially have little to no (inherent) pleasurable sensation to them inside, aside from a sensation of pressure (arising from adjacent tissues mainly). I never had PI, but I imagine there is sensation from the inverted sheath - which is a significant plus. [Some surgeons claim they are able to &#39;route&#39; nerves from the penis and attach to the sigmoid or PVT canal, but I don&#39;t have experience of this in terms of how well it works.]
</li>
<li>
A huge proportion of people have undiagnosed digestive system issues. If there is even the slightest issue in this respect, it can cause &#39;run-on&#39; issues with a sigmoid-segment used for a neovagina. The segment is still connected nerve wise to the digestion system, and any signals of inflammation, signals to produce excessive mucus, etc  will be forwarded to the segment (which will respond accordingly). Such signals will also likely lead to odor (as excessive segment mucus doesn&#39;t smell like daisies).
</li>
<li>
Taking a section of sigmoid to create the segment is a high risk surgical procedure. Though relatively uncommon, some girls do end up returning home with a stoma bag.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Taking all factors into account, if I was starting out again, then I would find a surgeon who can do &#39;pink&#39; and go for PI.
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, if a sigmoid-segment SRS works out really well in all respects, then it might be said to offer the most advantages of all SRS types. However, girls for who this is the case appear to be few and far between.
</p>
<p>
Given the above, imo, it therefore makes the most rational sense to go for PI first - presuming one can find a surgeon who can do &#39;pink&#39;. It&#39;s the least risky of all types; it utilizes the penis tissue in the most efficacious manner (rather than much of it being binned); likely has the most sensation - and still leaves other SRS methods in reserve in case they&#39;re required. And is the lowest cost.
</p>
<p>
I realize there are studies showing that bacteria associated with bacterial vaginitis are quite common with PI neovaginas (and the original reason I didn&#39;t go for PI - plus ofc the dilation requirement). However, I&#39;ve had no less issues over the last 4.5 years - and I would feel more confident addressing such an issue with PI than what I&#39;ve had to deal with.
</p>
<p>
However finding a surgeon who can reliably create &#39;pink&#39; with PI appears not to be an easy thing at present. But maybe with raising insight into the huge aesthetic advantage of pink - it will become more requested and thus eventually more available.
</p>
<p>
Misc notes:
</p>
<p>
Studies I read a while back, showed that sigmoid SRS via laproscopic technique leads to better outcomes re avoiding potential prolapse.

I’m not sure what you’re getting at with that photo. It’s a standard good aesthetic cis vulva. I see nothing else. But it’s not just the colour, but the texture of the skin and shape that makes the difference. No surgeon can reproduce that photo.
</p>
<p>
Come to think of it, I wonder why no one has tried cosmetic tattoos to improve things.
</p>
<p>
As for Olmec, note that lack of post op photos and reviews here. Got to wonder about that.

I&#39;ve actually had 4 rounds of medical tattooing on my outer labia to improve the color gradient and hide the scars. Some medical tattoo artists are used to doing this work for cis women who&#39;ve had labiaplasties, so the skill set is already there.
</p>
<p>
As for the pink coloration OP is talking about, that can be partially achieved by using excess urethral tissue to line the interior of the vulva. It&#39;s pink and mucosal, which is exactly what you want there. I really wish I saw more surgeons doing that!
</p>
<p>
I do think you&#39;re right about shape though-- I&#39;ve never seen a trans vulva with inner labia that well defined.

Dr McGinn has a girl who will tattoo it pink. I  talked to them. I didn’t get a price without going in for a consultation. I’m not really for that yet. But I was curious.

Yes, that very intriguing re there being a lack of post-op images from Olmec. It would be presumed there&#39;d be stacks. As I mentioned, when I was able to follow up with 4 or 5 girls who&#39;d had sigmoid SRS there, none of them matched the images on the site - and most showed the sigmoid-segment visible in the image (which was ironic given the method he claims to provide).
</p>
<p>
I sent the surgeon there the images and asked him if he might explain how come. He cancelled the booking and sent back my funds. Though tbh, I might have raised the issue in a more diplomatic manner.

Dear
<a href="/u/HiddenStill" rel="nofollow">u/HiddenStill</a>
, thank you for providing the opportunity to clarify why I&#39;ve included the above image.
</p>
<p>
The girl has minimal labia majora. Her labia minora are well defined but very simple and spaced apart with a wide gap between.
</p>
<p>
To my sense, given the otherwise &#39;minimal&#39; nature of her vagina, it&#39;s the large amount of pink tissue which immediately provides for the impression of a cis female vagina - and imo, a highly aesthetic one, albeit its simpleness and lack of various (more complex) folds.
</p>
<p>
The image is from a paper looking at the creation of neovagina canal with a sigmoid-segment in the cis girl. When I first read the paper, I presumed it was a trans female in the image and I wrote the surgeon asking how he created so much pink - and whether he could achieve the same on me! I presumed it must be some tissue from inside the tummy, etc.

I don&#39;t think you can choose the color of your neo vagina, even choosing the type of aesthetic is kind of impossible, just go to a surgeon that gives the type of results you like and hope for the best, in srs the goal is to preserve as much nerve and not causing damage to produce functionality. I just realized you are the girl that had complications, l hope that everything worked out for you with your last revision, sending you love and support ❤️

. There is pink tissue available, just it&#39;s usually binned.
</p>
<p>
The present standard and consistency of trans female SRS is not at all what it should be imo. It&#39;s like playing Russian roulette. It can&#39;t be excused.
</p>
<p>
As can be read on this sub, very significant suffering is being caused to some trans girls by sub-standard surgery (and surgeons who either haven&#39;t continued perfecting their skills, are careless and/or who couldn&#39;t care less if they get the dollars). As per the images I&#39;ve posted re my own case, it took me over 4.5 years to sort and tens and tens of thousands of dollars.
</p>
<p>
Trans girls are often so desperate to get the surgery they excuse what shouldn&#39;t be being excused.
</p>
<p>
Of course I realize you mean well and I&#39;m not meaning to be abrupt, and it&#39;s true that most surgeons can only offer a cookie-cutter result which is often sub par. It&#39;s not often that real surgical artistry is visible in a trans girl&#39;s neovagina.

You know that result is not representative of the standard of SRS? It’s an excellent result by possibly the best SRS surgeon in the world, and far far away from average. And it’s still not cis looking, although better aesthetically than average in many ways.

Subs like this will hopefully inspire the next generation of SRS surgeons to at least meet or surpass Dr Bank&#39;s standard. And for trans girls to demand a higher standard.
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about how most of the Thai SRS surgeons have profile images that are 40-50 years out of date. I turned up expecting a fresh young and dynamic surgeon, and was met by a geriatric in a golf cart.
</p>
<p>
Says it all. Haha.

There&#39;s definitely been an improvement in the best surgeons over the last 10 years. I&#39;m not sure if the the rest have changed though.
</p>
<p>
Its not clear to me how Western surgeons will compete with Thai surgeons as there&#39;s very different costs in the two countries. Thai surgeons can spend a lot more time and care and its still affordable. On the other hand surgeons in the USA get to use robots and stuff that may not be accessible in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
I suspect there&#39;s probably lots of younger Thai SRS surgeons, its just we don&#39;t know much about most of them in the West/English sites. Bank is younger and got well known quickly because of Suporn. Maybe we&#39;ll see more of that if/when Chettawut etc retire. PAI did the same much earlier and now Sutin/Burin are well known.

So basically one should consider medical/cosmetic tattoos, because not everyone can afford to go with Bank.

One surgeon I was speaking to recently did mention in passing that there&#39;s a section of colon which isn&#39;t cherry-red. Do you know where the segment was taken from, and are you able to enquire from the surgeon how he avoided the cherry-red part - or maybe in you the sigmoid is flesh colored?
</p>
<p>
In another post I linked to a site I published on SCFAs and colovaginoplasty and it has
<a href="https://diversionneovaginitis.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/after-hi-res.jpg" rel="nofollow">this image</a>
on it, of a trans girls neovagina - same color as yours.
</p>
<p>
Btw, was in laproscopic or open surgery you had?

I don&#39;t know which color it is as its inside me but i know its sigmoid. Also the tissue visible is urethra and stuff , my vagina for the first 1 1/2 -2 inches is lined with skin on the side (left and right ) is scrotal and bottom is perineum ( the skin between the testicles and butt hole)  The top part is not skin is mucus membrane but im not aware if its urethral mucosa or something else but that i know its pink.
</p>
<p>
I had laparoscopic. I think the color depends on maybe the person too like different people have different colors ( pink or red )

So is the pink tissue showing the sigmoid-segment or is it another tissue positioned at the entrance (with the red segment behind it)?

No the pink tissue is where my urethra is , under the pink tissue is my v entrance which is still surrounded by labia minora its just not a &#34;gaping hole&#34; so its hard to spot i guess. My surgeon uses this technique to avoid the colon being exposed because &#34;it would look weird&#34; his words. Iv seen pictures of results of his without adding a skin graft at the entrance with the colon exposed and it did look a bit odd hence why he developed that technique. The skin graft is about 2 inches long the rest is colon tissue.

I just came to say - excellent write up.  I think we need more push like this from the community itself for what we want, vs leaving it to the &#34;pro&#39;s&#34;, very few of who bother to care. ❤️

Yes - the pink color is always an indicator of cis vulva. It’s just another world. I don’t get how some people claim they had their vagina examined by a gyn and they could not tell. I went to suporn with those crap claims going around on internet. I’m not sad about my results but no way a gyn wouldn’t be able to tell during the first few seconds of looking at it.
</p>
<p>
That being said, I’m pretty sure there is not even a single SRS result in the world that is unclockable.
</p>
<p>
The provided picture is one of the most ideal and beautiful vulvas I’ve ever seen. Very simple, pink and cis-like.
</p>
<p>
I asked for the pink color from my surgeon (dr bank) he did provide some but it does not look uniform at all. I’m happy I am not the only one having issue with the lack of pink tissue inside SRS results. All vaginas are pink inside, even women with very dark skin colors and vaginas have pink color inside, period.

At least one of those &#34;crap claims&#34; is real. I was getting my SRS scars covered by a medical tattoo artist who&#39;s worked on countless vulvas, both cis and trans. While I had my legs spread and she was all up in my business working on her color matching I realized she had no idea I was trans. When I came out she was absolutely shocked and did a quadruple take looking back and forth between my face and my vulva. She then detailed all the ways she can usually tell the difference between a natal and neovagina and how mine looked natal in every aspect. I was really confused though because what on earth did she think the scars were from?? Turns out my scars are exactly where you&#39;d expect them to be after a labiaplasty on a cis woman.
</p>
<p>
Of course that&#39;s not to say no one could clock my vulva, I&#39;m sure some gynos probably could. But I&#39;ll definitely take the win and the confidence boost!

Good for you. I hope she was not trying trying to give you a boost confident and really meant it. I’ve never seen a single SRS result that is cis in every aspect and I’ve also never seen any cis vulvas that makes me think it’s SRS. You might think it’s cis if you look at it from distance with lips closed but you 100 percent can tell when you open the lips. Anyone that can not tell, is either being nice or unknowledgeable. My surgeon Dr bank said himself that no SRS result is Cis in all aspect.

How wonderful we have the same experience given such aesthetic simplicity. And such an unusual instance given she has a sigmoid-segment canal.
