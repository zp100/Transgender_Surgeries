<p>
After 3 revision consultations with 3 separate doctors I appear to have quite a few issues with my initial surgery results, both in terms of my GCS and my tracheal shave. I figure Ill go through my story step by step so yall can form your own opinions.
</p>
<p>
I had my initial GCS/Tracheal shave with Marci back in April 2022. She seemed super friendly and super confident at our consultation so she felt like a safe choice, especially considering her role in WPATH. I had done about 9 months of hair removal prior to surgery and at my consult she said that everything should be more than adequate in the hair removal department (despite having a few thin stragglers.) I also spoke with her about aesthetics/depth. I stressed that depth wasnt very important to me because Im a lesbian, but aesthetics were very important to me. She was confident that we could get adequate depth and aesthetics despite my rather small amount of donor tissue (roughly 4 inches, I was about 5.3ish before shrinkage began with HRT.) At the consultation she was pretty proud of her technique where she leaves some urethra tissue on the outside to create a bit pinker of a vulva, which sounded super cool to me at the time.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to immediately after my surgery, the first thing she says to me and my mom once Im awake is &#34;I had to pull everything super tight but we got the 5 inches of depth.&#34; This should have been a massive red flag at the time, but I trusted her. A handful of days later and we are at the hotel room recovering, I take a look at the results with my mirror and notice that my labia minora is getting fairly greyish, so I contact her office and they tell me to forward her a photo of it. She seems super confident that everything is okay, so I go about recovering and hoping for the best. Fast forward a little bit more, at this point it looks like my labia is just dead skin hanging on, but I get cleared to go home. By the time I get home and look at everything again, its incredibly obvious that my labia is starting to rub off, as well as a bunch of tissue around my vaginal opening is starting to turn greyish. I send her a couple photos and she informs me that she believes that necrosis is starting to happen and that I should try Oxygen therapy to try to stop it. My mom and I pack back up and head out to SF again, and the doctor at the eighth element (the oxygen therapy clinic) confirms that I am in fact having a fair amount of necrosis.
</p>
<p>
I cant speak highly enough about Eighth element, at this point in my recovery I was pretty low, and these people felt like the only shred of hope in my recovery journey. Bowers office regularly wouldn&#39;t respond to my messages and would even ghost me, so having a doctor on hand at the Oxygen therapy clinic was a blessing. One time I sent a photo of a glob of white discharge that came out that was roughly the size of a stick of trident gum, and Bowers quite literally responded with &#34;Yuh nasty.&#34;  After a couple more weeks of oxygen therapy I had a follow up with Bowers, she met me at her office after hours to try to accommodate our schedule which I really appreciated. My mom and I took the opportunity to ask her why she doesn&#39;t just send everyone to oxygen therapy straight away like some other surgeons do and her response was &#34;when your work is good enough, you dont have to.&#34; She said that healing appeared to be going well and that we should keep up the therapy. Oxygen therapy was such a blessing, and it clearly made a big difference in the speed at which I was recovering. After a couple more weeks I got the go ahead from Eighth element to go back home and resume my life as best as I could while I waited for a revision.
</p>
<p>
I got in contact with Bowers office to get on the waitlist for a revision, after taking my deposit they informed me that my revision was scheduled for December 2024. This news was pretty devastating because at this point in time, I was aware that my labia that died, as well as some erectile tissue that was becoming more and more apparent every day and was making dilatation and arousal feel very uncomfortable. I took the appointment because at that point they had already taken my deposit, but I decided to start looking for another surgeon to handle my surgery because by 2024 I wont have insurance (Im turning 26, woohoo America and being self employed.)
</p>
<p>
At this point my tracheal shave was causing this snagging on my muscle that was really tight and uncomfortable. After messaging Bowers and her office and initially being ignored/ghosted again for quite a while, she got back to me and told me to try massaging it. She also made sure to mention how this was the very first time it had ever happened with one of her patients. I wanted to get another opinion because of all of the nonsense at this point. I spoke with my OBGYN who handles my HRT and has worked with quite a few trans patients to ask her about getting a a referral for a revision, and she told me that Im not the first Bowers patient who was ghosted which was somewhat unsettling.
</p>
<p>
My first consultation was with Dr. Min Jun, he seemed like a super lovely guy, but after taking a quick look at my vulva, he asked me if he could draw on it. He proceeded to draw a bunch of lines in the places that he would make incisions to try to fix things, but informed me that he had never done a revision that dramatic before, he said that he COULD do it, and it would probably turn out similar to how I wanted, but that it would be somewhat of a first and that he would recommend going to Ellie Ley at the GCC. He also said that he didnt feel super confident removing the erectile tissue, and to quote him &#34;thats something that important to nail the first time.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Fast forward a couple months and I have a consultation with Dr. Dev Gurjala at Align surgical associates. Their office was VERY speedy with getting a consultation booked which was a blessing, and the consultation went fairly well. He seemed pretty confident about his ability to fix my issues, he also pointed out that due to &#34;pulling everything super tight,&#34; my skin had healed over my vaginal opening and was collecting a bit of urine when I go to the bathroom, which was probably the source of my chronic bacterial infections from this last year. He also seemed to think that the tightness might have been the reason my labia died. When I told him that I had an appointment for another consultation, he asked if I minded sharing who it was with, and when I told him that it was with Ellie Ley, he seemed relieved and told me that if I chose to go with her, that I would also be in good hands. Between his response about Dr Ley and his ability to point out the issue that Min Jun hadnt, I was feeling somewhat confident about his abilities, but I wanted to be sure about who I went with so I still went on to have my third consultation.
</p>
<p>
My final consultation was with Ellie Ley. She was amazing and I cant speak highly enough of her. She was so kind, so compassionate, listened EXTREMELY well to all of my issues, and she really tried to inform me about how she would go about fixing things, she also explained everything in a way that just made sense to me which was nice. I showed her some photos that I had shown both Min Jun and Dev Gurjala that had some decent examples of the amount of erectile tissue left behind and how big things get when Im aroused, after I showed her the pictures she went on to explain how Bowers and a lot of other surgeons put urethra lining down the center on the outside, and how that typically leaves quite a bit of erectile tissue, to quote Dr Ley &#34;urethra tissue only belongs in the urethra.&#34; She asked if I felt comfortable sending her the photos so she could try to convince surgeons to stop leaving urethra tissue on the outside. Apparently shes already been going around at different events and has been trying to convince people to change their technique for quite some time. To fix my situation, she recommended two surgeries, one to fix the urethra tissue/erectile tissue, and one to fix my labia. She said that if we try to do both at once that it has a much higher chance of failure because the skin would be pulled two separate ways, but that if we do in in two stages, that shes very confident that she can fix my complaints, Ill just have a few extra scars.
</p>
<p>
I decided to go with Ellie Ley for my revision, mainly because of her desire to get surgeons to stop doing what Bowers did to me, and the fact that she recommended splitting up the surgery to avoid risks. She values my safety, and she wants to get it right, not make the situation worse in an attempt to save time. We are currently waiting on UHC to stop dicking us around, last time it took a couple months, but Im excited to finally start working towards leaving this chapter of my life behind me. Her office has been super friendly, but a couple times now there have been delays due to negligence on their part (not checking the right box when processing my paperwork, not communicating between departments, ect) but despite those setbacks I think Ellie seems worth the wait, and the office staff has been super friendly. As far as the Tracheal shave, the general consensus is to try massaging or for a WHILE and hoping for the best.
</p>
<p>
The final update at the moment is that at my last Gyno appointment, my doctor informed me that there were quite a few EXTREMELY thin hairs on the very back wall of my vagina. Im pretty upset about it, especially considering how much electrolysis I went though and how confident bowers was that it should be enough. I wish that she would have been honest with me and told me to delay my surgery and get a bit smoother results from the Electrolysis first. I also wish that she would have been honest with me that PPT would probably have been a better idea considering my size and desire for aesthetics. Especially after Min Jun told me that he would recommend going wither another surgeon, it really confirmed to me that not every surgeon is a good fit for every case, and seemingly, she wasnt a good fit for mine.
</p>
<p>
If you took the time to read through all of this, I hope it at least somewhat made sense, Ive been to a lot of appointments and spoke with a lot of doctors this last year, and its hard to condense. If youre considering Bowers, I wouldnt say NOT to go with her, but be careful and I wouldnt just blindly trust what she tells you like I did. If you went with Bowers or any other surgeon who failed you, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and sure, my results probably wont looks as close to cis genitals as Id like, but they work, and after a couple revisions and a few new scars, they should finally feel comfortable and look at least in the ballpark of what they are supposed to.

I&#39;m so sorry you had a bad experience. Once something goes wrong with initial surgery, it&#39;s difficult to correct it later. I am aware that Marci Bowers caused Jazz Jennings a great deal of issues, even after undergoing colon revision with Marci and Dr. Ting, Jennings was unable to dilate and gave up. She cannot engage in vaginal sex. I may travel to Thailand to have a colon vaginoplasty. Thank you so much for sharing. 🙏

Bear in mind, in Jazz&#39;s case she came in with the genital development of a prepubescent 11 year old.  That&#39;s far from the typical case.  Bowers was working in uncharted territory trying to make
<em>
something
</em>
from
<em>
almost nothing
</em>
.   She subsequently came out and dared to say that full puberty blockade might
<em>
not be
</em>
the best medical advice, and that some amount exposure to puberty might lead to better surgical outcomes, and then she got shit on for that.   So she&#39;s been getting shit on by the anti-trans assholes and by the trans advocates.  Something, something rock/hard place

Bowers is adamantly anti PPT in 99% of cases, That&#39;s why her recommendation is to go through puberty. I did go through puberty, and I still had the lack of tissues issue. She&#39;s insistent on using an old method that doesn&#39;t work nearly as well when there is a lack of tissue.

This is a serious consideration as I don&#39;t have much donor tissue either and I don&#39;t want colon procedure.

There’s other surgeons who can do an excellent job in Jazz’s case. Just because she famous doesn’t mean she knows what she’s doing. She also consulted with Salgado.

He&#39;s never been on my radar, but a quick glance at the wiki shows some horrific sounding outcomes from him as well.  He&#39;s also much more of a generalist.  I want a specialist for something like this.

I’d suggest someone with an excellent record is what to look for. Nothing else much matters.

All doctors are highly qualified, yet some of them are butchers. What are qualifications worth? And he medical profession doesn’t care about standards so you need to look out for yourself.

Who would you suggest and bear in mind that many have just a short track record at this point as many have come online in the past 5 years.

<p>
Not true.  For most people cost matters, so they have to consider whether they&#39;ll take your insurance.  Wait time also matters.  I have 17 months of Cobra ahead of me and then I end up on ACA in Texas where almost no one is in network and those who are, are also seriously suspect.   Just getting in for a consult with Bluebond-Langner would carry me outside my window of opportunity.

Bowers weight list is about 2 to 3 years typically, most other surgeons are under a year. If you&#39;re taking wait time into account Bowers is absolutely not a choice to make

Thank you for your very detailed explanation of what clearly has been extremely traumatic for you.  This helps all of us immeasurably , as I plan to discuss this eurithra issue with my surgeon on my next pre-op visit (I have my initial GCS this September).
</p>
<p>
Best of luck on your revision, I&#39;ll pray for your success.

Thank you for taking the time to read through it c: My experience with this whole process has taught me a lot about myself and it&#39;s also taught me a lot about how to pick a surgeon.  Not sure who you&#39;re having your pre-op with but hopefully they listen, I&#39;ve talked with quite a few other Bowers folks who balloon up when they get aroused because of the urethra tissue, which IMHO isn&#39;t an ideal outcome.
</p>
<p>
And thanks! I&#39;m going to be documenting things as we go and I&#39;ll provide before and after photos to hopefully help people make decisions of who they want to go with once everything is done 🤠

I&#39;m using Dr Purohit at Mt Sinai who I know was mentored originally by Bowers.  But he has had other training as well.  But believe me it will be a specific question.

Hi just finding this old post but I feel compelled to say I am also a recent Bowers patient and have had basically all of these exact same issues (excessive erectile tissue, labia necrosis, getting referred to 8th element, urethra issues, internal hair growth). I&#39;m really happy it seems like you have found a way forward to start addressing some of this stuff. I was way too willing to defend Bowers for too long, she and her team have been extremely dismissive of my issues. I am no longer in California and my insurance is limited, so I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever be able to afford a revision that would adequately fix things.

I&#39;m so sorry that you have had the same experience, their office definitely was dismissive until it was too late in my case. I defended Bowers for a long time, and then the ghosting started. If you ever have the opportunity to go with Ellie Ley she literally worked miracles for me. After two revisions with her, everything is literally perfect. I couldn&#39;t be happier with the current state of things. The erectile tissue is gone, my minora is here and defined. I&#39;m really thankful to be on the other side of everything now.

Thanks for sharing this.  I&#39;ve seriously considered going to her.  She is one of a handful of the most experienced surgeons out there.  I don&#39;t understand why her bedside manner is this way.  I might expect it from a cis doctor.   I&#39;ve seen her presentations a couple times and she always comes across as cocky and detached from the patient experience.  She knows firsthand what we have to go through.
</p>
<p>
Assuming you didn&#39;t just blindly trust her and had taken it upon yourself to go get the oxygen therapy (assuming that&#39;s even possible without referral) do you think your outcome might have been different?

I realize you said this right before, but this is just her opinion and it is commonly done, and people report fine results.  I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;s basing that opinion on.  You only have just so many tissue options for making things look right.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck with you revisions!  I worry because my plan specifically says one per customer.  My assumption is they only included that so they&#39;re never on the hook for detransition, but who knows how some random claims adjuster might choose to apply it.

You should look in the wiki, there’s nothing new or surprising in this post.

I have, and followed her work for years.  It&#39;s hard to get a bead on.  Obviously when you&#39;ve done thousands, there are going to be some less than stellar outcomes.  It&#39;s hard to figure out what percentage that is though.  Unhappy people tend to be much louder than happy.  The only thing that seems to be consistent is her less than stellar manner.

I don&#39;t understand the desire to defend bowers at all costs. She clearly isn&#39;t the absolute worst, she clearly has a lot of fucking issues though. The amount of negative reviews on hers is similar to a Rumer. It&#39;s not normal to have an absurd amount of negative reviews, sure there will be bad outcomes from time to time, but the sheer number of them from Bowers, the consistency in what goes wrong, and her inability to separate herself from her ego and make the decision that&#39;s right for the patient, it&#39;s pretty obvious.
</p>
<p>
Being told by Min Jun &#34;I can do this but I&#39;m probably not the best bet&#34; changed my perception of Bowers, part of what makes a good surgeon is knowing when something is out of their wheelhouse. Trans kids shouldn&#39;t be forced to undergo puberty so they can have a slightly better chance at penile inversion, they should just have PPT. It&#39;s not rocket science, but Bowers wants to be good at everything.
</p>
<p>
All of this doesn&#39;t even scratch the surface of her interviewing with the what is a woman clowns and fueling the fire saying that she thinks there are a lot of trans trenders, having the leader of WRATH agree with what they say in their little clown show of a documentary was the last thing our community needed.

This is the same conclusion that I came to as well. I researched her incredibly thoroughly and had myself convinced that the unhappy people tend to be much louder than the happy people.
</p>
<p>
After looking incredibly deeply into a ton of different surgeons, and meeting with a bunch of different surgeons, it&#39;s a little more than just bad bedside manner and a handful of unhappy outcomes from Bowers. The ratio of positive to negative reviews in her wiki page are vastly vastly worse than all the other surgeons that I have consulted with, Ellie Ley seriously had like two negative reviews, they weren&#39;t even complaining about her, they were just talking about normal things that happen with surgery results or complaining about her staff at her old office, one of them even went out of their way to say that it&#39;s not her fault, and that she has a condition that causes her skin to heal worse, she also got taken care of almost immediately and had the whole botched surgery remedied quickly and compassionately. I know that she does a lot of surgery so her chance of having botched results is quite a bit higher, but her insistence to pull everything tight to try to make the depth that she wants has a habit of causing the the labia to heal over the opening of the vagina, hair in the vagina is a very very very normal Bowers result, because she always insists that she can do the follicle scrape and the in operating room hair removal, and she always says that it&#39;s okay with a little bit of hair. A lot of surgeons will just tell you no, or tell you that you will have hair, but she tries to say &#34;almost all of our patients have amazing results with this.&#34; She also has so so many cases where she leaves too much erectile tissue, it&#39;s a common Bowers issue.
</p>
<p>
Calling ghosting a patient bad bedside manner is an absolutely absurd take, bad bedside manner is making the patient feel unheard, not completely fucking ghosting them. That&#39;s medical neglect.

I didn&#39;t.  I said her manner is a consistent complaint.  I don&#39;t know that neglect is consistent theme.  Anyway I really hope you find a path through.  I had a similar year of hell after a botched FFS so I know fully what that that is like and I&#39;m not trivializing your issues at all.  Your grievances sound completely legitimate.

It&#39;s more than just bedside manner, it&#39;s an absolute disregard of what I told her going into surgery. I clearly stated to her that I wanted aesthetics over depth, and then she sacrificed my aesthetics to try to make depth. She stretched everything too tight and caused me to need multiple revisions to fix it, because she refused to listen to what I told her at our consultation.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s hard to say if it would have made a difference or not, but the people at the oxygen therapy clinic said that they have had lots and lots of really incredible recoveries, and as I was reading about it, it sounds like it really would have saved my tissue if we would have sent me there right away. Some surgeons send their patients there literally the day after surgery, and I genuinely believe that if I had done that, I would have not lost nearly as much tissue as I did.
</p>
<p>
As far as urethra tissue, not all cis women have bright fucking pink vaginas, some of them have vaginas that are pretty universally the same color. You don&#39;t have to make the center strip look neon pink to look like a vagina. Especially if it comes with the risk of causing pain when you get aroused, and distortion in your genital area every time you get turned on or dilate.

Thanks for sharing your experience…I recently had FFS with Ley, she’s absolutely amazing. I’m consulting with her again soon for body feminization and bottom surgery.
