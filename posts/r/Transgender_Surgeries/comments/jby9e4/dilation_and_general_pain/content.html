We all went through that pain, some people had more, some people had less. I had a ton, trust me, the day dilations stopped hurting, and now I can say it was worth it. If possible try to buy an urological lube, it may contain some anesthesic it really helped me a lot, also, you are too soon in your recovery, DONT forget to take the pain medication, even if you dont feel a huge pain and you think you can with it, I did that, and the pain went worse and worse that it was too late to calm it with my prescription, so I spent more time in pain than I should have because I thought that I was strong enough.

You got to get some. There&#39;s some people who have to take it for months, and its unacceptable that you only get two days worth. Oxy&#39;s not great long term as its quite addictive, see if you can get some Tramadol. Its not as addictive, but not everyone can tolerate it.
</p>
<p>
And for anyone wondering, Dr. Avanessian is her surgeon.

One day&#39;s worth for me
</p>
<p>
You should have been on pain meds for at least two weeks.  If it hurts mostly during dilating, that&#39;s a little different.  Do you exhale as you push in?
</p>
<p>
If I do it while watching something funny on tv, it goes much better for me.  I don&#39;t worry about trying to get it in quickly, and start the timer when I notice I hit the back.

You’ve just had a major surgery, and it’s entirely plausible, even normal, to experience some depression afterwards. The pain can feel overwhelming, leaving you wishing for it to stop more than anything else in the world. If you’re in NYC, I’m going to assume you went with either Bella Avenessian or RBL. Talk to them about some topical anesthetic you can use for dilation. I was given some lidocaine. Yeah, dilation hurt like HELL for more than a month after surgery for me. It gets better as you heal. Be patient, and be kind to your body while it heals. And oh lord, it all came back when I was sized up. But now, at 5 months PO, even the large dilator doesn’t cause any discomfort at all. I promise you sister, it gets better. Stick at it, and the rewards will be well worth reaping.

It was uncomfortable and painful for the first 4-5 days, but after that, it became so much easier. After 2-3 weeks it was neither uncomfortable nor painful for me. Give it time and push through it.

I&#39;m sorry that you are currently going through this. I&#39;m also about to have surgery wth Avanessian. I hope you are able to get through this.

Ask for help! Tell the surgeon your pain is terrible and you&#39;re having trouble dilating. Like another poster said, topical lidocaine can be great. Do you have a relationship with a therapist, like someone who wrote the letters? Ask for an appointment! What you are going through is the hardest part of surgery, you deserve help and care to get through it..
