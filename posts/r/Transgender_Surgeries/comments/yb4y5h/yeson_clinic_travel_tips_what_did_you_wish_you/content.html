I stayed at ALOFT.  They had a very nice breakfast daily.  Visited all the Buddist temples and did a food tour.  The have a really amazing underground mall with bakeries and gourmet food court.  Gyeongbokgung Palace is amazing , bukchon hanok village is another must visit.  You will have plenty of time.  Enjoy!  The surgery is pretty simple to go through, the no talking is the hardest part. They are very propane detailed.  A nurse puts your hair in pigtails and you have to eat ice cream after words.  Just had a sore scratchy throat, no true pain.

I think we are planning to stay at Aloft!
</p>
<p>
Was their breakfast buffet?  When I look at booking the room, you can add $22 a day for breakfast, does this cover the two people in the room or would that be per person?

It was per person, I had my son with me.  And yes the surgery DOES work!  You just have to find your new voice.

Ok great!  ( not the price per person for breakfast that us haha )
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so glad to hear!  I can&#39;t wait to find out for myself!  I&#39;m more excited about this than any other procedure I&#39;ve had ( although if I had this first I&#39;d probly say that about having GCS next? )

Question - traveling from Aloft to Yeson seems like a fairly short enough walk. Can you tell me how you went back and forth from there?  I feel like walking is fine but if its raining, or if going back to the hotel after the procedure isn&#39;t easy after anesthesia, then I wanted to plan ahead with a taxi or bus.
</p>
<p>
BTW I&#39;m booked!  I&#39;ve got my flight and hotel stay at Aloft ( going to try for Entra yet but I think they are booked... )

Unless Yeson has moved has moved, definitely not an easy walk.  I actually did this once wanting to see the city, it took me over an hour.  I  usually got a taxi and downloaded a translator app to communicate with the driver.

Ok thanks!  I was actually able to get into the hotel near the clinic!  For some reason on Expedia it had no rooms available during my travel....if I logged out of my Expedia account, it did....so I started booking it outside of my account and then logged in to make payment and that seemed to work.

Hotel entra, very nice, not very expensive.  Lot of restaurants/shopping within walking distance.
</p>
<p>
I never had a meal, but the restaurant that stood out was Scopa the chef, amazing meal.  It&#39;s a very expensive area though, think Beverly hills, rodeo drive.
</p>
<p>
The after care packet they give you is really confusing, they give you a thumb drive with recordings to follow, but they skip all over the place in the time stamps, supper confusing.  They will go over it all with you, and it makes sense when they go over it, but after a month some gets lost to the memory good, so just take good notes.
</p>
<p>
I was there alone, went to a few parks and just wondered around for the days before the surgery.  After the surgery i just slept for like 2 days straight.

Hiya, I&#39;m 4 months post op, going great so far.  Noticable 20-30 pitch difference so far.  According to the surgeon it will continue to rise through the year as things heal, so fingers crossed.
</p>
<p>
Surgery and post op was a breeze.  Woke up groggy, had ice cream, then some really nice sweet potato soup.  Slept a lot.  Hardest part is staying silent, especially when you first wake up and are still half out of it.
</p>
<p>
Dr Kim kept reinforcing how delicate the sutured structure is, which had me support paranoid.  I have really bad allergies, and now and then a sneeze/cough would sneak out, which scared the crap out of me, but it was totally fine.  Just listen to their care instructions ðŸ˜€
