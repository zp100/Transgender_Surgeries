As promised a few days ago, here comes more from my experience with Dr. Morath in Munich, having had my GCS a couple of days ago.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day -1
</em>
I was admitted to the hospital the day before my surgery was scheduled. There was not much of notice during this day and I only had to be admitted so to “clean” my intestines before surgery with a very strong laxative. So that day I unpacked, had a chat with Dr. Morath and other doctors, including the anaesthesiologist, in preparation for the surgery the next day, did some paperwork and visited the toilet quite many times.
</p>
<p>
The experience was overall positive but I had some problems communicating and with admin issues because of my lack of skills in German and due to that day being a holiday in Germany. The lack of English-speaking personnel was (and is) somewhat annoying, more so when the clinic gives such an international appearance and accepts so many foreign patients, but I could in the end start to defend myself in the language and communicate more clearly. Other than that, I felt calm and in good hands. In the end of the day I was offered a sleeping pill and could sleep the whole night without problems.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 0
</em>
My surgery is scheduled the first of the morning. A nurse woke me up at 6:30 and I took a last shower before going in. I was rolled into the OP section nearly an hour after that. They prepared me for anaesthesia and after what felt a couple of minutes I was waking up in recovery, some 4-5 hours after. A couple of hours more there and then I was rolled back to my room.
</p>
<p>
During the rest of the day, I was comfortable and didn’t feel so much pain as I felt the pressure of the vaginal stent they place down there (pain was like 3/10). I was in quite good spirits and received a couple of visits. Surprisingly, there was barely any swelling in the surgical area and the doctor removed the ice pack within a couple of hours. I have some nausea and dizziness but they gave me some medicines for it and the sensation quickly went away.
</p>
<p>
The night wasn’t the best. Pain started to be stronger later in the night (I’d say it ranged between 6-8/10) and it prevented me from sleep. It took some complaining and a few trials but at around 4:00 I got a painkiller that actually worked and I could sleep for a few hours.
</p>
<p>
I also got a chance to take a look (a nurse helpfully offered to take a picture) during a change of bandages and results already look amazing on the day of the surgery. I don’t want (for now) to publish any pictures, but the results are too-notch! Really happy with them and hoping nothing will go wrong down the line.
</p>
<p>
Oh! And my left arm was pretty much gone after I seemingly was out in a weird position during the operation. Doctors say sensibility and control should come back on its own in a couple of days. I feel it slowly getting better.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day 1
</em>
I woke up in quite a bit of pain but the issue was easily resolved with some extra painkillers in my IV. I had been running a fever and having nausea (apparently a common side effect from anaesthesia), but when I complain on this I’m always given some medication to counter these side effects. They’re annoying, but manageable.
</p>
<p>
Today there’s some more blood down there but changing bandages helps keeping it all clean. Results are still looking good, perhaps a bit more swollen but barely. I tried standing up with the help of the nurses twice but I’m still too weak and get dizzy after trying to walk a few steps. I hope I can start recovering my stamina soon! Dr. Morath and other doctors stop by to check how recovery is going and they seem to expect a quick recovery.
</p>
<p>
I’m again hungry and start eating more in the dinner, even some solids! Recovery food is a bit bland, but it isn’t like I would want anything else. After this, even eating takes quite a bit of energy and I have to eat really slowly.
</p>
<p>
I also had a pain peak (again, 8/10 or so) during the afternoon and even they took a little longer than I would’ve liked, I got some extra painkillers which made the pain sort of go away (to 3-4/10). I also had a painkiller with dinner which, interestingly enough, doesn’t seem to make the pain go away but makes me not care about it, which is equally relieving. After the the afternoon down with pain, I was back in good spirits once painkillers diminished it. I had some trouble again with fever and nausea in the night but medicines and sleep helped to get rid of it. My left arm seems to be coming back to life slowly, although I still can’t fully control it.
</p>
<p>
That’s all for the first couple of days. Feel free to ask any questions and I’ll answer whenever I can :)
