I swear he’s the best in the states in my opinion he does a mix of the suporn method so I fully get wet already and it feels and looks more natal in my personal opinion!

I know it seems impossibly but it’s definitely possibly. I would establish yourself with a therapist and psychiatrist as soon as you can! I also spent about 2,000-3,000 dollars total on housing and food while I was there so make sure to have that saved up and you must have a person with you to help take care of you! I know there are also trans housing centers there so that may be an easier and cheaper option. I wish you best of luck on your journey!

I feel like some hype up results when they generally don’t look like that good, but when I tell you just for seven weeks, that looks beautiful I can only imagine how you look when you’re into it, also personally do you think dilate with the big dilator? Because if I ever get my SRS, I really don’t see myself going past the third dilator I’m not really into well endowed people LMAO.  Also, I don’t know your particular situation, but I was told that being uncircumcised really makes a difference for surgery, do you think so?

So I am only on the second dilator rn I just started, my goal is to make it to the green before the 12 week mark. My bf is definitely well endowed so I’m just a little nervy about being able to have sex if I don’t make it to the orange. However generally patients at my surgical center only get to the green and they have assured me that dick size isn’t really a concern because green is big enough to work with pretty much any penis since they are more squishy and moldable unlike the dilators. Most of the people who really want to get to orange is for toys and stuff. As for the difference between circumcised vs un, I’m not sure I was circumcised when I got mine done but I guess there is mores there if you are uncircumcised

Awesome to know, yea penises are obviously more squishy and moldable than a dildo or dialator. That’s why I was wondering if u could stay in the smallest one for like a while and slowly work ur way up, bc I feel like sometimes with these surgeries they make it seem like ur on a time crunch to keep getting to the biggest size and I looked at the second size and I’m like that seems big enough for me😂 but idk, maybe I’m wrong but I would just be concerned about ripping stiches so I wouldn’t wanna be trying to go so big so soon.

Yeah no they definitely wanted me to be to the biggest since my 8-10 weeks but I will at most be at green by 10 weeks if that and I basically didn’t move up to blue until they told me to try to lol

I lowkey feel like they shouldnt tell ppl that, what if that how people get complications? Like u should respond to ur body, and go slowly, little by little. I saw a video where girl got her srs and she said that the vagina naturally adapts to size better once healed and idk, going that big so soon seems crazy😭

with suporn/pang method you have to upsize early because it&#39;s prone to scarring.

How exactly? Wouldn’t u make ur self more prone to scarring if ur forcing ur self to insert something so large that can rip ur stiches and be very painful?

I&#39;m not sure exactly. I was a Pang patient at Mount Sinai, and at that time he told me that he makes the vaginal graft fitted for the orange dilator during surgery, so it&#39;s already that size when you come out of surgery and start dilating, and it&#39;s better to keep it that size than to try to stretch it later on.
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t able to keep it that size, and my vagina scarred down and got stricture, despite dilating to his instructions. The Suporn method is known to have this risk, and this is true of Pang&#39;s work too (I&#39;ve seen a number of other girls on here who have had the same problem).
</p>
<p>
As I understand it, because the vaginal graft isn&#39;t made from one tube of tissue, such as the penile skin or intestine, but rather is multiple flat grafts that must be shaped into a cylinder, it results in more incision and suture lines, and therefore more capacity for scarring.
</p>
<p>
I will say though that my vagina self-lubricates a lot and is very sensate, and I am sad that I will have to have the graft replaced with peritoneum or intestine during revision.

Yeah I totally agree they kept telling me once it’s healed it will be harder to stretch but I just don’t really get that because like it’s still healing and it’s so sore and stiff for the first 10 weeks like how am I supposed to move up so fat I’m just taking it slow and trusting that i will be just fine to have sex once im comfortable and will be able to fit any size eventually

Dilation was brutal for like 3 weeks but the first week wasn’t bad because not much feeling back. I did have some complications with bleeding so they had me not dilate for 6ish days and starting back after that made it a bit more difficult but now it is getting so much easier! I just started blue 3 days ago but I can tell I will be progressing much quicker now it really is like I took turn for the best this week! The process wasn’t easy but I have orgasmed multiple times now and been intimate (without penetration yet obviously) and it has made it all so much more worth it!

Aaaaaand he dropped all his NYC clients on short notice (yes, even those with surgery dates) when he left! Great guy!

I’m sorry you had that experience with him! I’m definitely happy with the results I wouldn’t ask for anything different but I guess maybe he just got a better offer in SF but shitty that he left his patients in New York like that

Yes, it does suck that he left. I was with Callen Lorde for a long time but all the drs moved on. I feel it may be the same there. Maybe it is the nature of medicine today. Anyway, I had a friend who had the surgery by Pang at MS and she was ecstatic but I didn&#39;t think she looked very natural, maybe it was her body type, tall and thin.  All I can add is that BB/Zhao has a much more sophisticated team IMO.

would agree, I have friends who have gone the BB/Zhao route and all of them are much happier than otherwise.

Just so you know. He didn’t drop his patients on short notice. He wrote all his patients a letter explaining why he was leaving from April, months before he left. Mt Sinai didn’t send his letter out to any of his patients, so they found out late.

Fucking amazing. I have my first consult with him next month and this is the second recent post I’ve seen that looks incredible. I’m so happy for you.

<p>
If you don’t mind me asking, how long after your first consultation was your surgery?
