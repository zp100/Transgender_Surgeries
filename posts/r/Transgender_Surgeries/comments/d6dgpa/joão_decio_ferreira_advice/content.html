I am having a consultation with Dr Ferreira this week who is apparently the most qualified SRS surgeon in Portugal. The wiki here does not mention him however. Has anyone had SRS with this doctor or knows more about him? There isn&#39;t much online about him and the lack of info is making me nervous.

Dr Ferreira was very friendly and talked me through the method of surgery (jejunum method), he answered my questions as best he could (his English is there but rusty).

Did he show you any photos of his work?

He did show me photos but I didn&#39;t take any, his method involves a keyhole operation to extract a portion of the jejunum which is then used to construct the vaginal canal. He then uses penile tissue to construct the labia, this is what I understood from our consultation. He taught Dr Littleton too, they both use the same method.
</p>

I probably won&#39;t persue SRS for another 2 years but if I do choose Dr Ferreira I&#39;ll post an update.
