So weird after reading so many of these posts being the person writing one.
</p>
<p>
As far as I can tell, things went swimmingly.  The nursing staff at GWU are
<em>
incredibly
</em>
nice and helpful, and the food is surprisingly good based on previous hospital experience.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m on Tylenol and Meloxicam, no narcotics needed yet, spending most of my time reclining in bed but I&#39;m able to get to and from the bathroom without too much pain, and can deal with stairs if I have to.

Congrats on the successful surgery and smooth recovery so far! I‚Äôll be having the same surgery toward the end of next month. Hoping my pain levels and mobility are as good as yours!
</p>
<p>
Question: what did you bring along for your stay in the hospital? Anything you wished you brought? Anything you could have left behind?

Thanks!
</p>
<p>
Note that the bits about hospital offerings are specific to GWU - if you&#39;re going somewhere else, YMMV.
</p>
<h2>
</h2>
<p>
What I brought with / did I use it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Deodorant / YES
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Hair scrunchy / YES
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dry shampoo + Brush / YES
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Grippy-slipper-socks / YES (they give you some, but they were oversized on me and kept sliding off in bed)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A paper book in case of phone battery or eyestrain issues / No - I was mostly sleeping or watching tv or occasionally checking phone, but my stamina for close-up focus was pretty low.  But if the phone had any issues, this would&#39;ve been sanity-saving.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Very large and relatively loose hi-waisted underwear for discharge / YES
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
General change of clothes for discharge / Yes (basically the same overalls I showed up in, and a fresh shirt.  I wore a blue one to drive down, a purple the morning of admission, and pink on the way home.  Because I am a nerd ^_^ )
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Toothbrush/paste/mouthwash / No (they provide you small travel size of these)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
100% non-metallic/acrylic earrings / Yes (They will not want you to have jewelry, but I didn&#39;t realize when I got my piercings that I had to keep them filled 24/7 for 6 months - these were acceptable for hospital staff and me)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Phone, phone charger,
<em>
long
</em>
cable / YES (You can&#39;t be sure which outlets in the room will work or be used by medical equipment.  I used my phone a
<em>
lot
</em>
- though there is a TV with DirecTV in the room, many of the channels were flaky due to weather, and daytime tv, you know.  There is
<em>
so
</em>
much shooting in Hawaii 5-0.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Big &#34;donut&#34; seating cushion / yes (only for the 3+ hr ride home)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Forgot:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Electric razor / I
<em>
sorely
</em>
missed this - my facial hair removal is only about 70% complete, and 3 days of (mostly white, fortunately) growth was definitely uncomfortable both dysphoria-wise, and comfort, since my hair would catch on it sometimes)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mirror / On the fence on this one.  The surgical dressing, which was basically like a slightly hard foam chastity belt glued on to me, meant I couldn&#39;t see results right away.  But when they took it off, I forgot to ask.  It might be affirming to see it ASAP when swelling hasn&#39;t kicked in much yet, but I definitely have big angry suture lines, so dunno.  Frankly, just looking down and not seeing
<em>
anything
</em>
when I first used the toilet in the hospital was pretty good.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Small personal fan / my room was private, and had its own thermostat, though it is not controllable from the bed, so you&#39;d have to ask staff and/or visitors to change it for you.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Flushable wipes / What they had available were large sanitary wipes generally meant for dry baths.  They are explicitly not flushable, and large enough that they may dip/fall into the toilet water since your dexterity with wiping may not be great due to dressings, soreness.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

Reminder: I had minimal depth, YMMV!
</p>
<p>
Pretty great!  At 5.5 weeks out, still plenty of swelling, but my pain is minimal now unless I&#39;m doing a
<em>
lot
</em>
of standing/walking.  I can drive short distances with no problem.
</p>
<p>
I had to get scheduled for a brief in-office follow-up visit on 9/20 because I was having some concern about seemingly detached tissue poking out of the upper portion.  It hurt a
<em>
lot
</em>
and was worrying me (this was the only time I&#39;ve had to dip into the oxycodone rx), but turns out it was just a loose suture only connected on one end that had picked up a lot of &#34;material&#34;, so when I was standing gravity was pulling painfully on the connected end.  Dr. R snipped it and all was much improved immediately.
</p>
<p>
Still have to wear a pad 24/7, but I can use ultra-thin L5 ones (I get mine from rite-aid and use the store brand).  Bleeding has almost entirely stopped and now it&#39;s basically just drainage.  I&#39;ve found pretty-cold-water showers help with both swelling and drainage.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t done any experimentation with stimulation yet, but I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s awake now, as I get occasional stirrings in that area?  :D

Minimal depth also - hope I can drive a lot sooner - though work is only 2 miles away. Pads are for drainage from the sutures? Or draining urine?

I think the first time I tried driving was around 4 weeks?  If I&#39;d
<em>
needed
</em>
to I probably could&#39;ve managed earlier with a soft cushion, but it would&#39;ve been unpleasant.  Basically driving is a matter of being able to sit upright - most of my sitting comfort had come from being able to recline as much as possible in bed, car seats or lean-back office chair - and being confident you have the mental focus depending on tiredness/pain/meds.
</p>
<p>
The donut turned out to be not super helpful honestly?  The one I got was memory foam, and stiff enough to keep the center parts elevated over the hole/cut-out, but it was
<em>
so
</em>
stiff that it put stretching/compression pressure on the surgical area from how my butt was settling.  If I did need to sit upright I had better luck with a super-soft fleece blanket folded up multiple times.
</p>
<p>
The drainage is from the sutures, yeah - aside from blood, there&#39;s been a lot of I-don&#39;t-know-what, sort of beige-yellow slurry.  It&#39;s apparently normal and been gradually improving, but definitely gross.  Peeing has been basically fine since I got out of the hospital, no problems starting or stopping.  Messiness there has been improving (I have a lavage bottle I got from Amazon), but still nothing as pristine as that first time in the hospital before swelling started.

Thanks - I&#39;m a cyclist and have had to recover from several rather serious accidents so I&#39;m not worried about handling the pain. I&#39;m not planning on getting on a bike until next spring.  Good to know about all the drainage - will add pads to the list of stuff I need to get. I have 3 daughters to take care of me - I&#39;m older - they are staying for the 1st week then I&#39;ll be generally on my own but will have friends and business folks checking in on me.  Did you have any major issues that you could not handle alone - that&#39;s one of my concerns - especially because one of my daughters will not handle blood but I have a friend who is fearless for those times  ;-))
</p>
<p>
Has your swelling got down? Seems like that is rather common.  BTW: thanks for chatting - it&#39;s good to know more of what to expect.

FWIW, the bleeding and drainage for me was a
<em>
lot
</em>
in the beginning - I started out using &#34;maternity pads&#34; that they let me take home from the hospital, which are like double-maxi-pads I guess.  Along with mesh underwear (also from the hospital, though I bought more from a medical supply place later) that barely feel like anything so don&#39;t put pressure on swelling, but are good enough to hold pads in place.  I think it was about week 3.5 when I was able to switch to the ultra-thin pads (and was confident enough to stop using a washable bed-pad under me).  Pro-tip - make sure you have a big wastebasket with a closeable lid in the bathroom, and even so, be prepared to get used to the smell of your own blood mixed with whatever.
</p>
<p>
For the first couple weeks, I wouldn&#39;t say there was much I
<em>
could not
</em>
handle, but it was better if I didn&#39;t?  Getting in and out of bed was a mild chore, and I was exhausted from blood loss and so-so sleep, and the recovery orders include not lifting anything remotely heavy, so things like laundry or taking out trash are right out.  Standing around in the kitchen to prepare meals was also pretty hard unless it was literally a 45-second microwave, and some even then, so I bought a bunch of easy options ahead of time so my wife could easily heat them up, and had a box of protein bars in the bedroom next to the bed, plus a big water bottle, for while she was at work.
</p>
<p>
2/3 of my first showers after getting home, I got super-lightheaded and a bit nauseated afterwards - after the first one we bought a shower chair, which made me feel a lot safer.
</p>
<p>
Swelling has gone down by maybe 40-50% at this point, but there&#39;s clearly still a lot.  As soon as my period-proof swim bottoms come in I&#39;m going to try swimming again for ROM and to encourage things to keep moving along.  Probably waiting at least another 3 weeks to go back to aerial classes.  :P
</p>
<p>
And of course!  The only reason I wasn&#39;t a mess of anxiety during all of this was the obsessive research I&#39;d done beforehand - just paying it forward.  ^_^

Hey - Thanks for the advise - it&#39;s given me a better understanding of what I&#39;ll be facing.  I&#39;ve added several things to my list! Oddly, I suffer from not experiencing anxiety mainly because like you, I also obsessively research but having it come from someone who has &#34;been there and done that&#34; shines a light that you cannot get anywhere else. Need to focus to drainage and mobility.
</p>
<p>
BTW: it seems your spouse has accepted your transition? My daughters have been great though my ex has no idea and that&#39;s long over anyway.

My wife and I both have therapists and we&#39;ve done a lot of work with them and with each other.  The bottom line is that we deeply love each other and do not want to live apart, so we won&#39;t.  But also my wife&#39;s orientation is not flexible, so our relationship is now open so she can fulfill her needs (and I can too when I&#39;m done healing).
</p>
<p>
Even with that last bit, I still consider myself very lucky - anecdotally, marriages that survive transition at all are the exception, and I am fully committed to my wife.  If she had been completely unable to accept my transition, I probably wouldn&#39;t have gone forward (which I know isn&#39;t healthy, but it is what it is).

Yes - transitions are very difficult.  Frankly, I used coming out as gay as the easiest way to get out of a marriage that was already dead.  At least you are trying to make it work.
</p>
<p>
I think that eventually we all need to transition to find fulfillment - we can try denial but in the end we will either live a miserable life in the closet or find the happiness we all are seeking and we all deserve.  I do hope it works out for both of you but it is a challenge.
</p>
<p>
Told my daughters a year ago and to my knowledge my ex does not yet know - since it has been 25 years since we split, I no longer care what she thinks.  I&#39;ve got 22 days until surgery - it can&#39;t come soon enough. XOX

Huh, it&#39;s rather odd for them to have you on Meloxicam (an NSAID) so soon after surgery, usually surgeons wait a week or two or three before clearing patients to take NSAIDs again, due to increased risk of bleeding.
</p>
<p>
Not necessarily a bad thing to be on it, just makes me a bit curious about the timing.
</p>
<p>
Meloxicam is a rather strong anti-inflammatory med, so that should help a lot with keeping your swelling down during recovery. It definitely helped a ton when I was able to resume it 2 weeks after my surgery.

Yeah, was a bit confusing to me too.  I was on both Meloxicam and Humira before surgery for Psoriatic Arthritis, and the surgeon&#39;s office said it was ok to stay on both.  But Humira is an immunosuppressant and my Rheumatologist recommended stopping it two weeks out, so I did.  The Meloxicam I stopped a couple days out.  They actually had me on Celebrex while I was in the hospital, and combined with the compression from the surgical dressing I had almost no swelling while in the hospital, so I started meloxicam right back up the first night I got home (they did not give me a home Rx for Celebrex).  I did have a bleeding incident the first time I pooped while in the hospital that was pretty alarming to me, but the nurses were very chill about.  But beyond that it&#39;s been very minor.  Possibly it being minimal-depth makes this a little less of a concern?  :shrug:
