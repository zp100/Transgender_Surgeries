I think your result looks excellent considering the time you&#39;ve had since surgery. When you&#39;re fully recovered, it will look completely perfect

Wait wait wait wait!! :O FINALLY more Dr. Prae&#39;s results. Just the day before they begin their third lottery selection of the year, no less.
</p>
<p>
I hope I&#39;m not being too disrespectfully straightforward here, it&#39;s just that I want to get as much information as possible before tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
So... I just don&#39;t understand what that big amount of wrinkled pale skin going down to the bottom is. It looks like skin from the scrotum. Shouldn&#39;t the minoras be these thin pair of pink skin strips? To me, it looks as if you had two pairs of minoras: one were this clinic usually places them, pinkish, made of skin from the penis&#39; body; and another pair of minoras, pale in color, surrounding the first pair, and apparently made of scrotum skin. Is that a really swelled up clitoral frenulum? Is that what some people are saying they&#39;re doing different now?
</p>
<p>
You also talk about how they make the posterior commissure now if you&#39;ve got enougy available skin. But up until now, that was always somethig that was left for revision because, supposedly, the posterior commissure would break open while dilating. So why do they do it now? Has something changed? What do they do differently now?
</p>
<p>
Aaah, how I wish information was less scarce and arrived much fasteer...! ;(

<blockquote>
<p>
what that big amount of wrinkled pale skin going down to the bottom is
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&#39;s labia. And it&#39;s very swollen because it&#39;s only 2 months post op. Once swelling goes down it will be much thinner. It will still wrinkle but this is a
<em>
good thing
</em>
since most cis women also have loose/wrinkly minora a bit.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It looks like skin from the scrotum.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No. There is no scrotum skin there. That&#39;s used for the canal.
</p>
<p>
They slice the dick from base to tip but leave the last centimeter of foreskin unsliced intentionally to create the general structure for the minora with a posterior commissure that has no stitches down the middle of it because it was never sliced to begin with.
</p>
<p>
The structure is sutured down the sides of the vulva and around the vaginal introitus. The inside of the minora are lined with a mix of interior foreskin and urethral tissue to make the inside pink.
</p>
<p>
So basically the minora are a super tightly tucked sliced up dick with urethral tissue lining the inside.
</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
OP has confirmed this is an artifact of swelling and some specific necrosis she has along a scar line. Once swelling goes down it will likely no longer be visible or be very minor IMHO. The swelling really accentuates stuff like that.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is that a really swelled up clitoral frenulum?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nowhere close. OP has a clitoral frenulum I think but it&#39;s
<em>
barely
</em>
visible and only in the 4th and 5th pictures. It&#39;s way too subtle of a structure for me to explain you should just look it up. It&#39;s an attachment under the clit not over it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is that what some people are saying they&#39;re doing different now?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What is different now is the posterior commissure. You can Google some anatomy charts to see what and where that is but I also kinda already explained it above.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So why do they do it now?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Different doctor. Different preferences. Cynically they probably also wanted to cut down in revision requests.
</p>
<p>
Doctor Suporn retired and Dr. Bank took over. He began experimenting with different attempts in early 2023. By mid 2023 it was standard for like 80% of uncut patients and 20% of cut patients.
</p>
<p>
There is still a high rate of the posterior commissure not fully working out but you get weekly checkups. If yours becomes detached he&#39;ll usually stitch it up a few times till it heals.
</p>
<p>
If that fails then he reverts to the old Suporn method of suturing it to either side of the canal and doing the commissure in revision.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Has something changed? What do they do differently now?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bro I have no idea how any of us are supposed to know what Dr. Suporn tried &amp; failed with on a few patients in the early 2000s. What are we even supposed to compare it to? Dr. Bank is the first surgeon to be doing this consistently as far as any of us know.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
The information has been out there but you&#39;ve maybe been missing it. Some of it has been posted to this sub by me and others. The rest is all over the discord server for those who have dates.

Thank you for the anwers!
</p>
<p>
Just two things though. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s usual for native English-speaking people, but please don&#39;t call me &#34;bro&#34;, I&#39;m a woman.
</p>
<p>
Also, I know there&#39;s lots of information there in the Discord server... And that&#39;s precisely the problem, that when one needs certain info the most is BEFORE getting a date. But still, I&#39;m very thankful we have women like you willing to help and answer questions :)

Heh no lol. They&#39;re often depicted like that in porn because of gross reasons, but most natal vaginas are some variation of an &#34;outie&#34;. I recommend taking a look at this to see how natal vaginas realistically looks

Plus as the other commenter said, I&#39;m swollen af so the thickness will go down a lot once I&#39;m healed.

<p>
I have one set of minoras done in the typical suporn way. What you are seeing is the suture line where they connect the outside of the minoras to the inside of the minoras. I have a lot of swelling so they look a bit like separate structures. You can see the same in a lot of the suporn girls. The most upvoted pussy on this subreddit also has the same swelling as me in her earlier posts 😅
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>

<p>
Idk what changed tbh, but it is still pretty common for the posterior commissure to separate. I was lucky to have a lot of skin so my posterior commissure &#34;healed perfectly&#34;, to quote Prae.

I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to criticize the looks of your vulva at all, I was just surprised by something I didn&#39;t understand what it was. And since you were operated by Dr. Prae, and you posted this just the day before they offered a new &#34;batch&#34; of dates, I was worried and really wanted to know what that was. If you&#39;re telling me they&#39;re just really swelled up minoras then I can rest easy Dr. Prae isn&#39;t doing anything I might not like, and so I shouldn&#39;t be afraid to be operated by her! It&#39;s all about my future vulva, so it&#39;s very important to me.
</p>
<p>
I should still say that, surprises apart, yours truly looks really pretty and natural. At the end of the day, having lots of skin is what counts the most.

I do have more swelling than most, especially in my left labia which got an unfortunate combo of necrosis, irritation, and a hematoma. You can see that it is almost 3 times as wide as my right minora 😅 from other people&#39;s results I expect the pink &#34;second minora&#34; to completely flush in with the rest of the minora and inside the vulva :&gt;
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t be worried about going with Prae, she seemed very professional, and as far as I saw, both for me and other patients, she was competent and comforting. If I had to say one thing about her it would be that she seems a bit eager to take out stitches. There might also be a slightly higher risk of complications due to her having less experience, but I don&#39;t have any data on it so I can&#39;t be sure

Thanks for posting. Looks different to Dr Banks work, but still good. Please post at 1 year also.
</p>
<p>
She’s doing the same fine work with sutures. I wish more surgeons did that.

Banksy girl here. This actually looks a lot like mine did at 2 months post-op last year. Including the posterior commissure.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s just maybe a bit more swollen than mine was but swelling timelines are really random and individual IMHO.
</p>
<p>
I think the main reason why this one looks different to you is because most people don&#39;t post their results, he only started doing this technique about a year ago, and not all patients (esp. cut) have the right starting material for it.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: the one thing that looks a bit different is maybe Dr. Prae is experimenting with doing the clit hood a bit differently? Like making it more defined rather then blending it right in to the minora. A year ago Dr. Bank didn&#39;t try that and outright said it was not possible.

I asked for slightly puffy majora, but I forgot to tell her I wanted slightly bigger minora so it was a nice surprise to see the size. I still have a lot of swelling, especially in my left minora and the underlying tissue so they look a fair bit bigger than I expect them to look in a year :&gt;

Mine looked like that at 2 months. Now that I&#39;m at a year they&#39;re way less swollen like, really just like natal labia. And floppy/loose enough to do fun little batwings with too haha you&#39;re gonna love it most likely

The swelling will still go down a lot in the next 6-9 months. The minora  swell takes a long time.

It’s easy enough to remove if she had wanted to, but it also goes all the way around the posterior which is most unusual. I didn’t think it was possible. It gives you a lot of scope for a revision if you ever want one.
</p>
<p>
Inside looks very good also.
</p>
<p>
I wonder how Bank and Prae are influencing each other.

They do the posterior commissure in the primary surgery now which is why my minora meet at the bottom. It&#39;s a relatively new thing they do if the patient has enough skin :&gt;

Also a suporn clinic girlie. Cost was around $17,000 USD for surgery + 2,000 for room and food + flights.

1 year post op with Dr. Bank here and looked just like OP at 2 months. I&#39;ve been waiting nearly a year for girls to start posting their results because I think the posterior commissure is a game changer, but I am not comfortable posting my own publicly on a trans subreddit.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: the one thing that looks a bit different is maybe Dr. Prae is experimenting with doing the clit hood a bit differently? Like making it more defined rather then blending it right in to the minora. A year ago Dr. Bank didn&#39;t try that and outright said it was not possible.

Bank girl here and can confirm. I&#39;m also right around 2 months and had the posterior in primary. Looks very similar to her.

<blockquote>
<p>
it also goes all the way around the posterior which is most unusual
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I mean, it&#39;s only unusual for neovulvas. Cis vulvas usually have this feature though.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bank started doing this some time in early-2023 and has been perfecting it ever since. At the time Prae was on hiatus.
</p>
<p>
This is very much Dr. Bank influencing Prae, not the other way around. The thing is he can&#39;t do it for every patient, though. I imagine the same is true for Prae.
</p>
<p>
If you are cut, have skin that isn&#39;t very stretchy, or don&#39;t have much material he usually has to do the old Suporn method of suturing the minora on either side in primary and fixing the gape in revision.

Not really, I have seen some results from Dr. Bank with large labia minora, but the only thing I think is different is the fourchette (looks more defined)

The anterior fourchette or posterior? If anterior yeah I agree. It looks like she&#39;s giving almost like double minors at some point which looks like maybe a new way of doing the hood.

I think it&#39;s just a mix of swelling and necrosis. I had quite a bit of necrosis in my suture line so there&#39;s a depression along that line which looks more prominent because of all the swelling. It might go away completely, but if not I&#39;ll ask to get it fixed in a revision

I doubt you&#39;ll need a revision for that, if it&#39;s even visible at all once swelling is gone. Looking at it now it doesn&#39;t even look like a mistake. I thought it was an intentional attempt at constructing a different variety of hood
</p>
<p>
But I guess if you&#39;re already getting one &amp; it&#39;s still bothering you by then maybe

Thank you for posting! Going to Dr. Prae in 14 days :D It&#39;s amazing to think I could look like that in less than 3 months.. It looks so good already that it&#39;s easy to forget that this is a very early photo in the healing process and it&#39;ll change a lot, still!
</p>
<p>
Did you get to talk with Dr. Prae about what kind of aesthetics would be important for you?
</p>
<p>
Congratulations for an amazing result and a fast healing process!

How do you think her results compare to Dr. Bank&#39;s? There is a painfully severe lack of information about her.

From what I&#39;ve seen I think the esthetic is basically the same quality. They use the same method and she hasn&#39;t practiced long enough to have developed her own style imo. This is just based on my limited experience, but it seems like she might have a slightly higher complication rate? I&#39;m not sure tho, and I wouldn&#39;t worry about complications like separation, necrosis, or bleeding as all of them are extremely common for both surgeons

Looks excellent. I really wish Thai surgeons would combine their current technique with a PPV. That would be the best of both worlds.

thank you &lt;3   I will probably go for a revision just to fix some small damage from necrosis and possibly reduce the width of my hood if it doesn&#39;t go down much, but I&#39;ll wait to see how it looks once all my swelling has calmed down :&gt;

I think the main difference between Dr. Prae and Dr. Bank is Dr. Prae&#39;s surgery isn&#39;t quite as symmetrical as Dr. Bank. It&#39;s also possible Dr. Prae has more issues with necrosis than Dr. Bank given presumably she isn&#39;t as well practiced as Dr. Bank.

Thank you! 🥰 It was the suporn technique which uses a cut down scrotal graft and tunica vaginalis for the vaginal lining. Dilation has been rough as expected, but I think I&#39;ve had a slightly easier time than most. The suporn technique usually results in a harder recovery because you get a lot of scar contractions in your canal that you gotta work through.
