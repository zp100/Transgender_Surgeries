Think of it like the concept of passing. How many of us look like cis women? For those of us who do look like cis women do we look like cis women to everyone all the time? For some of us the answer is  yes, for others the answer is no. It’s also very context dependent a pre-op trans woman who might pass on the street likely won’t pass naked in a locker room. A woman may “pass” when you’re not looking at her closely or don’t know she is trans but once you know or get a better look you might find things that “clock” her.
</p>
<p>
It’s pretty much the same with our vaginas, I’d say about at least 85-90% of us pass au naturelle in standing contexts (locker room, changing room, open foreign bathrooms etc) which historically I’d argue was pretty important with how privacy was structured, even now, look at the ruckus at trans women in women’s locker rooms/changing rooms, I’d argue that about 60% of that has to do with the fact that they worry about a penis being in that space. As long as you pass, I doubt you’d have issues in a female locker room naked once your post-op because most people are not going to look at someone without a penis and assume that they once had one/had surgery. Especially if there is no reason for them to do (lack of scars/scars hidden by pubic hair, passable body and face etc.)
</p>
<p>
However, I know this question isn’t about locker rooms and being able to pass naked in casual contexts. It’s about sex, it always is, can post-op trans women have sex without arousing suspicion from their sexual partners, do their vaginas “measure up” to the “real thing” and allow for them to do that. Many people will be annoyed with me for saying this but I think that answer is complex.
</p>
<p>
I won’t go into it now just because I think it’s not worth it, but I will say that there are good deal of post op woman who have discussed having sex with both men and women without disclosing and have been fine  these posts just often get deleted because they get taken to the transphobic sites and brigade/harass the original poster. There are also a good deal of post op women who discuss being clocked by partners they didn’t disclose to and while there is usually something else there (they had noticeable scars, said something off etc.) it is a reality we tend to ignore. Passing in sex seems to depend on a lot more than the intricate looks of your vagina  (though this is important) but the context of the sex as well, is the person really into you/it, how low are the lights, how confident are you for your age/shared experience etc.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately no one can really guarantee that you will be able to have a really passable vagina. Even Supron (who I feel is often treated as a god in surgery spaces) has made vaginas that have been clocked. However, I feel like the whole thing is akin to the way no one can guarantee if you will pass as a woman when you first start to transition the only difference is that the stakes are higher and it’s a bit harder to test out.
</p>
<p>
I think a lot of us view SRS as a way of shedding the trans marker on us and in a lot of ways it kind of is at least in the contexts I mentioned initially, but in reality I’d argue that you’re just exchanging one permanent marker of transness for another, exchanging one hyper visible experience of transness for a more mysterious individual experience of transness . Is that exchange worth it to you and what surgeon (depending on your specific needs and goals) will help you make it best?

Well written, some mods are by far too sensible concerning healthy discussions about trans topic, and they censure as strongly as their enemies (which is bad, really bad and does not help any cause), especially in
<a href="/r/asktransgender" rel="nofollow">/r/asktransgender</a>
. Even if an opinion on the topic comes from a transwoman, you can get immediately banned (without second chance), if you write the wrong words, which do not follow the mainstream opinion.

If you’re in the US, the only surgeons who creat vulvas that resemble natal equipment are dr. Rachel bluebond Langner/ Dr. Zhao, &amp; Dr. Min Jun. Dr. Bella avenessian is pretty close but she can’t create a V shaped clitoris aka the frenulum. Every other surgeon is not worth it. Even Dr. Wittenberg makes clitorises that are the size of a thumb.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Dr. Suporn has one of the best aesthetics ever tbh as he makes inverted v shaped clitoris’ and makes sufficient minora that goes around the entrance of the vagina.

<h3>
Long Read Ahead!
</h3>
<p>
This is something I&#39;m conflicted about sharing but I feel like because my experience is tied to others I&#39;ve met irl in group, it&#39;s something that&#39;s kind of important to me.
</p>
<p>
Mine doesn&#39;t look anything like I thought it would look like. I convinced myself it would from doing the same thing you did, asking people online, because at the time I didn&#39;t live in an area with lots of trans people. Everyone, including my doctor assured me it would look like very &#34;real&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had multiple prolapses, which is an awful experience and is something that my new doctor in NY said happens often.
<strong>
Still it would almost be worth it if: 1. I had any feeling at all. And 2. It looked like an actual vagina.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I went to Florida where they have many of the best surgeons in the country and idk if we&#39;re allowed to say the doctors name but he&#39;s in the top five recommended for bottom surgery in mtf trans women.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
All that&#39;s to say, do your research! Don&#39;t take other people&#39;s, word for it, even mine. Look into it!
</strong>
I wish I had actuayl taken the time to find testimonials from real live people in the real world and read up on short term and long term symptoms. At the time I was basically in go mode.
</p>
<p>
You can PM if you have any questions, I help run a group for supporting trans women and have learned my experience isn&#39;t uncommon. But because we&#39;re always afraid to share negative things online in the fear of giving transphobes ammo, you&#39;ll likely only hear glowing recommendations from people that haven&#39;t even had the surgery.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Since people are assuming this is just a one time issue with this one surgeon, I had multiple consults with surgeons in States outside of FL, NY and PA, who said my results were typical. If you look into groups of trans women dealing with these issues, you&#39;ll hear similar experiences. It&#39;s insane considering the small number of trans women that actually get bottom surgery.

Dr. Salgado in Florida is Nelly Beans surgeon. Like she said, do your research, and look for more patients than usual if you are considering this particular surgeon for your vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Now that I know this I want you to please give me permission to share your story, without your name, so people can be warned. Or you can share it yourself, so people can be warned.

Thank you, and thanks for reading it too!
</p>
<p>
This is something I talk about once a week and I honestly, truly, do not want to scare you or anyone. It&#39;s just my truth.
</p>
<p>
No matter what, it still helped with dysphoria, so I don&#39;t 100% regret it. I just wish I didn&#39;t have blinders on going into it and had been properly prepared for the outcome.
</p>
<p>
I wish the best for you in whatever you decide to do.

You can msg me if you want, I don&#39;t wanna get in trouble with Reddit rules or get sued.
</p>
<p>
I should also put it out there that even if he did something wrong, I had consults with multiple other surgeons, one in FL and one in NY, not to mentions the various other dr.s I&#39;ve had to see because of complications. All who said this was normal, which seems insane to me.

This made me laugh. I know one of those &#34;renowned&#34; GRS surgeons in Florida.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Some basic rules to avoid getting sued
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Be truthful and honest when writing about your experience.
</li>
<li>
If you make a claim, be able to back it up even if you don&#39;t post the documentation.
</li>
<li>
It&#39;s ok to be wrong. It&#39;s not ok to defame someone with deliberate, false allegations.
</li>
<li>
Focus on your own story without speaking for others.
</li>
<li>
Avoid making threats whether they are of legal consequence or otherwise.

</ul>

You aren&#39;t violating either of those things, also you kind of owe it to us after telling us about how bad your surgery was. Do pretend rules (of your own design) matter more than keeping someone from getting hurt by this surgeon?

Just frighten people and offer no warnings about who actually botched you. Super cool. It would have been better if you said nothing. Now girls just have to avoid Florida altogether if they can. Nice.

No, they don&#39;t &#34;have to&#34; avoid Florida, but it might be in their best interest to look a little deeper if they are.

please considering naming your surgeon publicly so that other women who find this thread can be informed. you may not always be able to respond.
</p>
<p>
also, there’s nothing against the rules of reddit or this sub on naming the doctor, it’s really encouraged.

The results your describing are not representative of a competent surgeon, but there are a number of surgeons who regularly turn out bad results. Unfortunately it can be hard to fix. There&#39;s some others who have posted here with serious complications so perhaps they can give advice.

<p>
I don&#39;t know who you went to, but if you look in the wiki you can see there&#39;s no top 5 SRS surgeons in Florida, unless they paid to get that advertised somewhere. And there are some bad surgeons who do pay to get promoted on sites trans people find when they search for surgery.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_florida">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_florida</a>
</p>
<p>
I can guess who it is, and if you look at the reviews you may find the surgeon has a bad reputation and a large number of bad results.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of bad surgeons in Florida (and deaths from BBL), and its because the law is heavily biased in favor of surgeons.

Another commenter posted the name, you can look him up yourself.
</p>
<p>
Ya know, it&#39;s funny, this is what I&#39;ve been told over and over again by lots of trans people onions who haven&#39;t even had the surgery themselves, while those that have in real life, have usually been in support groups like mine who have had the similar experiences.
</p>
<p>
But the thing is, I went to not one but two board certified surgeons in the US afterwards, who both in their own words told me this was a &#34;typical&#34; outcome.
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t botched, as per their words not mine, it just doesn&#39;t look like the real thing and the complications were awful. The bar is just so low and they&#39;re getting away with this because no one gives a shit because it&#39;s happening to trans women.
</p>
<p>
I know the impulse to wave this off is strong because no one wants this happening to our community but this is why other trans people have a hard time speaking up when something bad happens. The rush to diminish and undermine their words as if it somehow helps other trans people is sad.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon was competent, the multiple doctors and nurses I saw afterwards for consults and complications were competent.

I see it was Salgado, as expected. He&#39;s got a terrible reputation. I can quite believe its normal for him, and a  number of other surgeons.

I don&#39;t believe its representative of a good surgeon. I&#39;m fairly well informed on this topic. I have met a lot of post-op trans women, and seen a fair number of results in person. I&#39;m in Australia so its not from USA surgeons. I have seen hundreds, if not thousands in photos from around the world - I made the wiki I linked above.

I know it happens and no one is going to do anything about it. We need to do it ourselves. I made a post recently,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ppaazz/moderation_on_this_sub/" rel="nofollow">Moderation on this sub</a>

I just want to say right now that your work has helped me immensely so far in my search for competent medical care and I am deeply appreciative of what you’re doing and I am in awe at the many different trans people who come here, post their results, answer questions, and share the real side of things. It’s a collaborative thing but you’ve made this space and moderate it well.

<p>
It’s true across the board, not just surgeons, but everything from HRT, to general practice medicine, not only do trans people get forgotten but many medical professionals can also be made fun of by colleagues just for helping us. The practitioners who do care about us themselves are frequently stigmatized.

Again, he&#39;s a
<strong>
board certified surgeon
</strong>
, he&#39;s one of the few most qualified in the states for vaginoplasty. So what does that tell you?
</p>
<p>
And it&#39;s not just him, what about the several other surgeons and doctors I saw after that told me this was normal?

It would tell me not to rely on a surgeons qualifications. Did you read the reviews in the link? He’s got one of the worst reputations in the USA, and that’s before the recent scandal.

My point is that&#39;s the gold standard of care for the highest qualified surgeons. Those are the most well known and recommended surgeons in the US. If you can&#39;t rely on qualifications then obviously something&#39;s wrong here and with the small minority of trans people actually getting surgery, those are who these people are seeing.

There is no highest qualified surgeon for gender-related surgeries by the
<a href="https://www.abms.org/member-boards/specialty-subspecialty-certificates/" rel="nofollow">ABMS</a>
. The closest board certification would probably fall under Urology, but I&#39;m not a medical professional. Personally, I would love to see a board cert that covered trans-related surgery, but right now it&#39;s the wild west out there. Even an oral surgeon can call themselves a highly skilled Gender Surgeon. For the most part, people aren&#39;t making choices based on some Gold-standard medical qualifications as you claim, that&#39;s only an afterthought or it&#39;s simply assumed after their choice has been made.
</p>
<p>
GRS selection criteria anymore comes down to the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Insurance coverage
</li>
<li>
Geographic location
</li>
<li>
Previous patient outcomes
</li>
<li>
The surgeon&#39;s availability and waiting list
</li>
<li>
Out-of-pocket cost
</li>
<li>
Consultations
</li>
<li>
The quality of the Trans-medicine program involved
</li>
<li>
Surgeon outreach and marketing/community interaction
</li>
</ul>

May I ask where you got this information about his qualifications? He may be board certified in ENT surgery but there is no specific Board Certification for Vaginoplasty, or Transgender Surgery. There&#39;s also no qualitative ranking system for surgeons anywhere that would provide a comparative assessment --as in ratings or the most recommended. These categories based on some arbitrary skill levels don&#39;t even exist. It&#39;s all just word of mouth. It&#39;s possible you have extrapolated this information from the marketing hype on your surgeon&#39;s website or your choices were limited to a specific health network or geographic area through insurance limitations.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, I&#39;m the last person that would dismiss your surgery difficulties and complications, I&#39;ve lived them.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/emmalake/m/grs_disaster/" rel="nofollow">I&#39;ve documented</a>
my experience right here in
<a href="/r/Transgender_Surgeries" rel="nofollow">r/Transgender_Surgeries</a>
in detail for years now. It&#39;s obvious your hurt and angry about what you&#39;ve been through, and you&#39;ve discovered there&#39;s very little recourse when it comes to post-surgery support for trans-people when the wheels fall off the bus.
</p>
<p>
As far as providing support, what are some ways forward to raise the bar for Trans-surgery from your perspective?

Not that their statement about it not feeling like the real thing inside is very much based on what surgery you get. Penile inversion lines the canal with skin tissue, so obviously it feels a little different. I&#39;ve had colon graft though and it feels more or less like every other vagina i&#39;ve ever messed with beyond the fact that i have a very tight pelvic floor.

Post op here, mine looks very convincing. Everything is in the correct place and there. The only odd thing is I have some untreated hyperthrophic scars on my leg/butt area next to the canal, but the scars further up aren&#39;t really that noticeable as my surgeon did a good job of hiding them and cutting carefully. I&#39;ll have to get some steroid injections for  my hyperthrophic scars probably. Everyone who&#39;s seen it said it looked convincing

Continue your stand NellyBean. It is not a purpose of you to name and shame. In fact in some cases to causes undue harm, particularly in cases where you may not be fully aware. You have set a reasonable answer by going to direct chat
</p>
<p>
Now to address the issues Not all surgeries prolapse  (vaginal prolapse) it is directly related to surgical technique. So many of the US surgeons have been trained by current practitioners. By haighly respected surgeons ( on the surface at least. They haven&#39;t been taught the fixing surgical style or been unwilling to take it up. It really is a simple step - you simply need to stitch th3 outer vaaginal wall to surrounding tissue (use more than one stitch

<p>
Btw, as a point of disclosure, I work directly with leading trans surgeoes for Gender Dysporia. I will disclose who.
