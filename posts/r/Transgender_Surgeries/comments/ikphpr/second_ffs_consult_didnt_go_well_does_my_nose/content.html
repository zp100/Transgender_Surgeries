Second FFS consult didn&#39;t go well. Does my nose look &#34;gender congruent&#34; to you? Asking here since they apparently hate when you consult with other surgeons. How is medically necessary defined vs cosmetic surgery? [So-Cal Kaiser] [Consult - Dr. Liu] [FFS]

I really dont get doctors attitude. You have every right to get a second, third or forty different oppinions. FFS it&#39;s your face and your life so it&#39;s important that you get the results YOU want from a surgeon you are happy with.  Agree with donut, yes gender congruent and despite a deviated septum quite a nice looking nose! Good luck, but honestly girl you are streets ahead already.   üòÅüëåüåàüéÄüíôüíú

Yeah me either. I was really excited when I got the consult so fast, but as soon as it started with that attitude my heart sank and I knew it was gonna be an uphill battle.
</p>
<p>
I mean, what does gender congruent even mean? I only know what I see in the mirror every day, and it feels large and masculine.
</p>
<p>
Tried looking up some differences online for male and female noses:

He also told me I didn&#39;t have a deviated septum lol. I&#39;ve already been transitioning for close to 8 years now and I&#39;m just exhausted having to advocate for myself and fight with health care.

<p>
Thank you btw

I had an almost identical experience with kleinberger at kaiser nor cal, his results were underwhelming and I don‚Äôt pass better than I did before. He also immediately opened up by telling me to lower my expectations because ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt LA.‚Äù Honestly I really advise not going through with a surgeon that is immediately trying to lower your expectations or write off your goals as ‚Äúcosmetic‚Äù, I did the same thing because I‚Äôm poor and needed to pay for it but now I have to put myself at risk and go through another painful and invasive operation to pass. Part of the problem with the surgeons at kaiser seems to be that they focus on technical aspects of the surgeries but completely neglect sense of aesthetics and also write off procedures that can add to a persons ability to pass as ‚Äúcosmetic‚Äù.

Hey, I&#39;m sorry for being bitchy yesterday.   I really intended to set realistic expectations for you so that it would help reduce your frustrations.  Not to be antagonizing.
</p>
<p>
And I&#39;m sorry for turning that into asserting my general views onto you.
</p>
<p>
I meant it when I said good luck, and still do.  Take care.

The real problem is who gets to define what&#39;s gender congruent and what isn&#39;t? To me, yeah, sure... your nose and forehead can pass in the right light and with makeup, but they aren&#39;t in the average range for female features so no, they aren&#39;t feminine. It&#39;s not even about the rotation of the tip. It&#39;s that to me, your nose looks over-projected, and too big, especially the dorsal &#39;hump&#39;. Sure, SOME women have noses like this, but not very many. I think it&#39;s insane for a doctor to say &#34;oh well, technically like 5% of cis women have a nose that looks like yours so it&#39;s fine.&#34; I don&#39;t think your moron Kaiser doctor also takes into account that your nose is going to look BIGGER after you have work done on your brow. You should at least have it done to keep things in proportion.
</p>
<p>
I had a similar experience up in the Bay Area. Dr. Kleinberger (KP NorCal) refused to do any revisions for me because according to him, everything was perfectly feminine and revising any of it would be &#39;cosmetic.&#39; I got a second opinion which said my features were still too masculine, then a third opinion that agreed with the second opinion. The revision would be covered, but I still don&#39;t trust them to do what needs to be done to relieve my dysphoria. Fuck Kaiser and their conservative assed surgeons. They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. They have minimal experience. Don&#39;t waste your time with them.
</p>
<p>
My advice is that if you want them to do what you really need, get a consultation with an expert surgeon with some serious credentials. Get numbers, objective measurements. They&#39;ll respond to data. When I went to the second KP surgeon, I had already gone to Dr. Deschamps-Braly for a second opinion and came armed with real objective evidence. Dr. Facque (KP) agreed with DB&#39;s assessments over Dr. Kleinberger&#39;s and they offered me a revision. And even if he didn&#39;t, I would have fought them on it because he would have been going against the medical opinion of arguably the most reputable FFS doctor in the field currently practicing. DB has done more FFS procedures than almost anyone, and has had more publications in peer reviewed journals than most KP doctors have had patients.
</p>
<p>
Now I have documentation that my revision is &#39;medically necessary.&#39; I just need to change insurance companies and get it done with a decent doctor.

Toby Mayer in Beverly Hills is one of the longest practicing FFS surgeons around. He&#39;s also an expert in what makes noses feminine and does some of the best septorhinoplasty in the country. He even does free skype consultations. He has a pretty huge ego, but when I had my consult with him, he seemed reasonable and pretty nice. He did throw a lot of shade at other doctors though. He&#39;d probably be willing to at least give you a statement. Ask him if he&#39;d do an in person consultation and take measurements for you. My quote for having FFS with him was the most expensive of any doctor that I talked to so he&#39;s totally out of the running for me. But I think he&#39;s worth talking to.
</p>
<p>
If you have medi-cal, I&#39;d think about switching out of Kaiser. I think that the BC/BS plan available through the state covers FFS too, and you might be able to pick a better doctor. You may have to jump through a few more hoops, but I think Justine Lee, Thomas Satterwhite, Angela Rodriguez and a few others work with that plan. Obviously do your research, but my experience with Kaiser has been very &#39;meh&#39; and at some times pretty antagonistic. I think a lot of their surgeons are very new to doing trans surgeries and most of them are low quality and lack significant training.
</p>

<p>
Also...wtf? So poor people aren&#39;t entitled to a second opinion outside of their HMO? I&#39;d go anyway and say it was free. Prove it wasn&#39;t...I&#39;ll wait....lol Who&#39;s going to investigate this anyway? Pretty sure HIPAA assures your right to privacy; I don&#39;t think the surgeon&#39;s office can even tell anyone you were there without a court order. The state of CA really has the resources for that? What a joke.
</p>
<p>
Edit: You mentioned in another comment that you had an opinion saying the rhinoplasty was necessary from one on HMO doc? Can you ask for measurements and a consult note? It might be enough to change their mind.

Gender congruence is bullshit. That&#39;s just a way of him saying he doesn&#39;t think you should have the surgery.
</p>
<p>
If you feel your nose isn&#39;t feminine enough that is gender incongruence a priori.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry that you had a bad experience though. Fyi I understand there are some Kaiser trans specific groups like fb you may try for specific ways to navigate the system (I am not on Kaiser ). If rhinoplasty is important to you for ffs I would def find someone who would do it. I can think of several ways to build a case for it but there is probably a &#34;best&#34; way within Kaiser.

No, the patient does not get to define what&#39;s necessary if insurance is paying for it.  They require a doctor to prove it is outside of cis standards, or they won&#39;t pay.
</p>
<p>
In the case of Kaiser, their doctor&#39;s jobs depend on making decisions that are in line with the adjusters. Kaiser will deny the surgery if the doctor writes down, but the pt was really sad and wanted it.
</p>
<p>
This is why patients go out of pocket for ffs.  Bc I agree, it&#39;s super important.  It&#39;s worth paying for.

What is necessary is what is necessary to you. A doctor may not think it is necessary but that doesn&#39;t mean that doctor is correct. This is actually a major problem with a fully vertically integrated healthcare system like Kaiser. There is a perverse incentive for the doctors to not provide care as a cost savings measure.
</p>
<p>
The argument that a nose is &#34;outside of cis standards&#34; is a ludicrous one. That is in fact a huge problem with transcare, determining service in such a backward, transphobic fashion.

Agree that it&#39;s large and asymmetrical, but also gender congruent.  Surgery would be cosmetic.  You&#39;re in an hmo, this is kinda expected.
</p>
<p>
That one Dr seemed like a jerk.
</p>
<p>
Yes, your incision will be visible.  That&#39;s a little surprising that you didn&#39;t know that if you&#39;ve been looking into ffs before your consultations.

I was under the impression that the coronal incision approach would mask the incision underneath the hair opposed to in plain sight incision on the forehead.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t understand how it would be considered cosmetic. I&#39;m not choosing a preference, but instead trying to reduce my gender dysphoria.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll willingly break my nose if that&#39;s what it takes. They&#39;ve said that they do work on nose but only if trauma or breathing issues.

I&#39;ve had consult in the past with non-hmo surgeon who agreed with me on my nose. I&#39;m not sure why Kaiser deems it not medically necessary ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The coronal incision is not used as often.  I think maybe facial team does it?
</p>
<p>
Not everything you don&#39;t like about yourself is gender dysphoria.  Insurance companies have defined what they consider it to be.  Anything else is cosmetic.  The size and shape of your nose is within cis standards.  You&#39;re likely comparing yourself to a portion of the female population and not the whole.
</p>
<p>
Ok, then you&#39;re crazy.
</p>
<p>
Bc a non HMO surgeon gets paid.  Kaiser is paying.  It&#39;s the difference between a car salesman telling you what to buy vs your accountant or spouse.

Right. I&#39;m crazy for having gender dysphoria and having the audacity to question insurance companies arbitrary standards of medical necessity for trans surgeries.

<p>
That non-hmo surgeon was being paid from the same bank account as the hmo surgeon, medi-cal. I would have gone to him if he wasn&#39;t a creep, but I digress.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure why internet posts always turn into arguments. I try to stay away from social media but wanted to let off some frustrations... so let&#39;s just agree to disagree. Congrats on your surgery btw, hope recovery is speedy and goes well, I plan to have mine at the start of 2021.

Gender dysphoria is having a physical trait that belongs to the other gender.  Not everything that bothers you is gender dysphoria.
</p>
<p>
Insurance companies get to determine that bc they are paying for it. If you disagree, you go pay for it.  Stop playing the victim.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re crazy for threatening to break your own nose.  But please, let your surgeon know you&#39;re willing to do that and watch them deny you any surgery.  Bc you have to be of sound mind in order to have it, and you&#39;re demonstrating the opposite.
</p>
<p>
Medical was never going to pay for your nose job.  It&#39;s probably good that you didn&#39;t go with that doctor either, it would not have worked out well.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not arguing with you, I&#39;m trying to help you be realistic.  It would save you some frustration if you could be.

<p>
Gender dysphoria is distress caused by having traits you perceive to be out of alignment with your gender identity. It is perfectly valid for someone who identifies as a woman to have dysphoria about something that technically falls within a typical female range, both because it can still cause distress, and because gender identity can be more specific than male/female. OP&#39;s gender dysphoria is not imagined -- the distress is real, regardless of your evaluation of how feminine her nose looks, or a doctor&#39;s evaluation of the same, and a rhinoplasty could alleviate that distress and is in that sense exactly as medically necessary as any other common ffs procedure.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re parroting an inaccurate understanding of what gender dysphoria is, and using it to support an oppressive narrative that is far-too-frequently used to deny transgender people access to necessary medical care.

Feel free to call gender dysphoria what makes you feel good.  Her nose job is as necessary as Botox or a French manicure.

Feel free to reference the DSM-V or current WPATH literature. You&#39;re literally wrong. I gave you the actual medical definition of gender dysphoria; you&#39;re just making one up to support your backwards views.

Yes both in Kaiser. My experience with Kaiser RNs have been fantastic. When I had the non-hmo Medi-Cal, my RN Case Coordinator were frustrating.
</p>
<p>
They would take weeks to call back, and would simply never call back and I had to call repeatedly to get through. Then they would randomly close my case and I had to make a fuss and not accept opening a new case and waiting several weeks.
</p>
<p>
With Kaiser they have a TG line where you can call 7-30am to 5pm AND you can send a message via the KP website. Response within same day, but they have up to 24hrs.
</p>
<p>
The non-hmo Medi-Cal only had one surgeon in network for FFS, GCS, And breast augmentation. I had to call other surgeons myself to ask if they would accept Medi-Cal, had a long spreadsheet. It felt like a full time job.
</p>
<p>
Kaiser has its quirks but at least they have a department just for us and will help you every step of the way.
</p>

My problem with the &#34;there are cis women with X&#34; logic is that there are cis women with masculine features, true. But usually it&#39;s only one or two features and feminine in other areas.
</p>
<p>
It seems like a unique trans woman experience to have a handful of masculine features. Brow, nose, chin, hair, height 6&#39;+ tall, broad shoulders, voice, trachea, etc then being told that one of the things that can be changed via surgery isn&#39;t covered because SoME CIS WoMEn have big noses too. It feels condescending from doctors in particular.
</p>
<p>
I agree that the point should be empasis on dysphoria. Thank you

A piece of the puzzle here btw is that Kaiser Is a fully integrated healthcare provider. It doesn&#39;t just have in network doctors. All in network providers are employees of Kaiser which is distinct from in network hmo providers generally.

First impression of your photos: your nose says &#34;female&#34; to me. It is not a typical nose, in the sense that it&#39;s not the upturned, petite, button nose that everyone is contouring on Insta these days. Your nose has personality, but it is a feminine personality.
</p>
<p>
Forehead work would be needed to achieve feminization, and to a lesser degree jaw work, while the nose is just the cherry on top.
</p>
<p>
This is where the dilemma is: if your doctor is directed by the insurance company to merely provide you
<strong>
feminization and nothing more
</strong>
, then yes, your nose work is strictly speaking, not necessary. If you wish to make yourself prettier than you already are, then your nose could use some straightening. But that would mostly be cosmetic work, which, for an insurance company, may be further than they&#39;re willing to go.
</p>
<p>
Regarding forehead scars: different docs use different techniques. Some of them hide it in the hairline, some of them do it right in front of the hairline and advise you to get some hair transplants to cover over. Your best clue is to look at the before / after photos in the portfolio of the doctor that&#39;s going to be doing your work.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t pay much mind to the doctor&#39;s grumpiness; this is a huge life decision, you be as thorough as you want to be about the process.

Thanks for the constructive feedback, I appreciate it :)
</p>
<p>
I actually avoid all photo-based social media, including and especially Insta lol. But I get your point. I just want to be able to look in the mirror or stand to see a picture of myself.
</p>
<p>
Kaiser will work on the nose if it&#39;s due to damage, broken, or trouble breathing. But my surgeon said I didn&#39;t have a deviated septum and my nose was straight. shrug
</p>
<p>
Going to have a third consult soon, in person, so hopefully, that goes well. I really want to have a positive conversation with a friendly surgeon who seems genuine. Oh and with a preferred technique that hides the scars.

<p>
And I&#39;m seeing Dr. Stacy Francis for the third consult soon. She&#39;s on the first link as well. I&#39;ll probably make a post for her so it&#39;s searchable. I&#39;d like to put as much info with my experience with KP Kaiser on here because I couldn&#39;t find much myself when trying to research.

And I&#39;ve been hearing good things about Julie Ames for FFS in a private B group too.

Thanks, I added them. I didn&#39;t spend long on this, but it looks like they don&#39;t have much experience in FFS. There would be risk associated with that.

Yes, I think Kaiser recruited a bunch of cranioplastic surgeons to fill in the demand. But I guess they have to start somewhere...
</p>
<p>
Any specific questions you recommend I ask during consult?

The risk you take is having unfixable problems. Things get so much harder when you‚Äôre looking for revisions to surgery. It‚Äôs best avoided if at all possible. I understand with insurance it‚Äôs likley take it or leave it.
</p>
<p>
Personally I don‚Äôt trust surgeons and would have already pretty much decided before meeting them from independent reviews, which is impossible in this case. I‚Äôd try to find out how much experience they actually have with FFS, and their personal complication rate, post-op photos. Anything to reduce the uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Maybe mention you‚Äôre going to post about it all right here afterwards. Might make them more careful, who knows.

Very true, thanks for your advice. I&#39;ve been trying to get these surgeries for almost a decade now and I&#39;m just ready to get them done and hope for the best. It&#39;s been exhausting advocating for myself all these years.
</p>
<p>
I had a bad experience with BA w/ a private surgeon for aftercare and whatnot so that&#39;s why I am giving Kaiser a try. Despite their inexperience (relative to world-class surgeons), I feel like they will take care of you as best they can and have good intentions.
</p>
<p>
At the very least I need to get my bottom surgery done and may look outside Kaiser for FFS if need be. I feel like my life is on an eternal hold due to gender dysphoria and I&#39;m close to 30 yrs old now and I need some relief so I can move on with my life.

The second doc sounds crazy unless they are in the same practice.   Then Docs get funny about stepping on another‚Äôs patient.  I can see where they would say your nose is gender appropriate, but I also see where it could be improved.

Thanks. I&#39;ve got some ideas as well, but I&#39;d love to hear yours. Feel free to pm or message me here.
</p>
<p>
Despite donuts belief in the infallible insurance system, I&#39;ve been transitioning for almost 8 years now and nothing was covered when I started
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had my fair share of grievances, and being persistent until things change because I know that insurance isn&#39;t always right or looking out for our best interest.
</p>
<p>
Things are better with insurance, but can also be better üôÇ. I feel like I&#39;m so close now which is why I&#39;m extra on edge and easily upset with these decisions.
