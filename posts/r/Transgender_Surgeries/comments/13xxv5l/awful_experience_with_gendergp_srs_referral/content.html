Hi, my friend and I managed to get lucky and got our surgery booked with dr. Bank. As you may know Suporn Clinic requires those who wish to undergo SRS with them to provide a surgery referral letter.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately in our country it is really difficult to get such a letter due to it not being a common practice and practically no one knows even what such a letter is and how to write one, so we did some searching and learned that GenderGP can provide us with such a letter for a fee of 150GBP per person.
</p>
<p>
While our assessment interviews went well and the interviewer/psychologist was very nice that was pretty much the only thing that went without an issue or a problem, so here is our overall experience with them:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
My letter took a month to process from the interview to me getting the digital copy. Granted I had my interview 10 days before holidays but I finally got it on January 13th, while my friend got hers within a few days from the interview (she did hers after holidays)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They wrote &#34;I feel that we qualify for the diagnosis of gender dysphoria&#34; which suporn did not like and told us to ask GGP to change it to &#34;I confirm&#34; because &#34;I feel&#34; is not a definitive diagnosis, with which we agree. GGP agreed to &#34;edit&#34; my letter without questions but not my friends.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
2.1 GGP referral letter is made of sort of two parts - the short description and the complete description, both parts contain the exact same sentence regarding the diagnosis of gender dysphoria. They only agreed to change the one in the complete description, saying they cannot do it in the short one because it&#39;s a &#34;template&#34; (whatever that means), they also refused to delete the short description for the same reason.
</p>
<p>
2.2 They only agreed to edit my friends letter (in the exact same way as mine) after she provided her F 64.0 diagnosis of gender dysphoria (which she got from our local psychiatrist and which we both have and which was her suggestion after multiple attempts to come to a compromise), they did not ask this of me.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
They charged my friend twice the amount to send the physical copy with a wet signature compared to me, she asked them a bit over two months after I did and they have yet to send it even though she paid on March 30th.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They repeatedly misnamed my friend using the nickname from the email address that is not even a real name anywhere, even though she told them her name on many occasions, it being in the letter and her name also being shown every time she sent an email with them stopping only after a complaint.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
To be clear while most things are simple inconvenience, the &#34;I feel&#34; part and their refusal to change it in all parts of the letter even after providing them with proof of gender dysphoria diagnosis is the main reason we would not recommend using them to get your referral letter if you have a surgery with Suporn Clinic. In the end the clinic sort of did reluctantly accept our letters after we forwarded them the entire back and forth we had with GGP regarding them not wishing to change it in the first part of the letter but it did not feel secure so we had to find a different place to get our letters from (which we are still in the process of finalizing at the moment of writing this). In the end we wasted 5 months and 337GBP (for both of us) trying to get what we want from GGP and getting a half-assed result in the end which we are not even sure would really work.

Not surprised at all :( With this &#39;&#39;I feel&#39;&#39; part it actually feels like a scam.

Yeah, I saw another post with a similar issue. I didn&#39;t get a date with bank this go around but when I do I won&#39;t be using ggp, I barely trust them to provide my hormones. Did the suporn clinic give a template for the letter that you could show to a psychiatrist so you don&#39;t need to go back and forth with them to get the correct format?

They shared some requirements but we still had to go back and forth asking them if the wording is ok or not several times

I guess its a good thing there&#39;s about a year wait between confirmation of the date and surgery. Good luck with everything!

Yeah, I can imagine, and I&#39;m sorry for the money you both lost on it. I&#39;m glad you were able to sort it eventually and hope there aren&#39;t any more speedbumps along the way

my question is: was it signed by Gender GP or by the person you had the assessment with?
