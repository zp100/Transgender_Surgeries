I had a consultation with him back in February 2018. It was $59,832.00 for forehead contouring type 3, brow lift, sculpt advancement, genioplasty, jaw tapering, rhinoplasty, upper lip lift, fat grafting and tracheal shave.
</p>
<p>
I know it‚Äôs not 2022, but it gives you something to work off of.

If I had to make an educated guess likely close to six figures, possibly more. Of course depends what you mean by &#34;full&#34; ffs but certainly north of like 60 or 70k

Wait are you freaking kidding me?
</p>
<p>
I was told 40-60k only like a year ago from someone who had just had surgery with him.
</p>
<p>
Are his results really worth that much?

He wasn&#39;t $40k since pre 2017/2018. Since 2018 and on its been 50k (low end for browridge, rhino, genioplasty, lip lift) to 60-70k if you wanted to add tracheal shave and fat grafting. I have been the caretaker of over a dozen friends who went to him. Most top surgeons are now 80k-100k. Keojampa, Mardi, Jumaily, DB, etc.
</p>
<p>
Yes his results are worth that much as are all top surgeons. He is probably the most qualified surgeon in terms of formal training and education too. His patients always recover 2-3x faster from surgery than other surgeons and he works faster too in the operating room. His stitches are cleaner than any other FFS surgeon I have seen the results of in person.

Yes but the facility charges and anesthesia is subject to change as listed in the contract. So if inflation goes up it will continue to go up. Their fees will remain fixed. Cost is more like 80k-100k+. 60k-80k was early this year.

All the top US surgeons cost that much. Keojampa is actually more, Jumaily is higher, mardi is around the same.

Why...are these prices going up so much? I&#39;m truly worried that I won&#39;t be able to afford by the time that the actual consult happens, even if I&#39;m prepared for what it was when I scheduled the consult. WTF.

Inflation. DB was the slowest to increase his prices. He did not increase them until summer of this year, Full FFS (brow ridge, lip lift, rhino, genioplasty, and tracheal shave) was about $62k. Similar surgeons at the time wanted 80k-88k, You will be paying similar prices with keojampa, jumaily, mardi, etc. DB actually is a deal considering he operates in San Francisco and his patient care and treatment is better than any other.

Oh if you don&#39;t have insurance at all, forget about it.
</p>
<p>
Fact: you generally can&#39;t make the kind of money you need to afford FFS if you&#39;re visibly trans working a professional job--they won&#39;t promote you high enough.

Not true. Engineers do not care. They care about skill and talent more. I am a trans engineer though I passed before FFS. I hire new grads for $170k-$230k. My company&#39;s insurance covers FFS too.

, I was going to say (but then didn&#39;t) that engineers are the one exception to this rule; unfortunately, not everyone can be an engineer--and it fucking sucks to me that being good at math is a requirement for getting medically essential surgery.
</p>
<p>
The reason engineers are paid so much is that most people can&#39;t do the job at a high level--it requires both innate talent and early exposure to certain concepts. Well...I deserve FFS too. I&#39;m not an engineer, but I deserve it.

FYI math ability is almost totally irrelevant to the job of most software engineers (at least for web development), as long as you can get a job without getting a Computer Science degree (e.g. via a coding bootcamp).
</p>
<p>
Not to say
<em>
anyone
</em>
can make it work (you probably need some aptitude in abstract logical thinking and complex problem solving, and a willingness to spend a lot of time working through major confusion). Just want clear up that misconception, speaking as a college dropout who is paying for FFS via a software job.

No, I acknowledge that! that&#39;s what I meant by not everyone can make it work.
</p>
<p>
I just specifically wanted to dispel the very common misconception that math abilities are a prerequisite for a coding job.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone can do it, but I think probably a lot of people who think it&#39;s beyond their abilities are indeed capable. And you don&#39;t have to be a rockstar coder (I&#39;m def not) to get a job that can make it possible.

Any ideas for making the cash or coming up with something for it? I think insurance considers it optional so they don&#39;t cover.  Because yes...let&#39;s not cover the thing that could give a lot of us a ton of gender dysphoria

No it is designing frameworks, designing the architecture of software, discussing optimal methods to implement certain things to meet requirements or processing availability or space, etc. Coding is a small part of it. Almost every job codes these days like accountants, statisticans, chemist, bio engineers, etc. but they do not have the skills to build software for the most part.

Dont listen to her unless you want to look like the typical traditional model who has very broad shoulders and masculine facial traits to show up in photos because that is what she likes.

It has absolutely sod all to do with models and masculinity and everything to do with how forehead shapes are naturally along with eyebrow height. But there‚Äôs a reason certain females are picked as models and that‚Äôs because there‚Äôs objective components that make an attractive face.
</p>
<p>
Stop cherry picking what i say and taking the absolute extremes. If you look at most female foreheads ( excluding Asians who have very flat glabellas ) the brow bone isn‚Äôt 100% flat and the eyebrows aren‚Äôt yanked up over their head like DB does, which creates a very uncanny valley effect especially if you are broader shouldered etc. I have seen countless Caucasian female skulls from 14-30 years old and almost everyone I come across has some subtle protrusion in the brow region. Even in child‚Äôs skulls. It‚Äôs not 100% flat.
</p>
<p>
Regarding ‚Äúwhat she likes‚Äù it‚Äôs not what I like it. It‚Äôs universal in western culture that‚Äôs it‚Äôs unequivocally what 95% of men and woman like. Granted if you live in Asia of different regions of the world those cultural preferences start to shift.

Are you kidding me? Models still have generally extremely feminine foreheads lmao. And they&#39;re cis anyway. Most of us that had male puberty need agressive work. Moreover, femininity and beauty overlap a lot and they would not be models if they were not particularly beautiful.

And i&#39;m sorry but 99 % of cis women or models have incredibly set back foreheads and soft features compared to most trans women even after conservative ffs

Look at her posts history. She like the typical European models which have sterotypical masculine traits. These are liked because they show up in photos.

Jumaily, keojmapa, and Mardi are more money despite operating is cheaper cities.  DB has better care and better communication. His patients recover faster than any other generally. His team even send a bouquet of flowers to you when you are recovering. I did not go with him but another but I have taken care of over a dozen friends who went to him. He has the most education and the most training of all FFS surgeons yet he still does not have the highest prices despite operating in the most expensive city in the country.
