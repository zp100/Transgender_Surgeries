Girl, your result looks excellent, Dr. Sutin did an excellent job, especially with your labia minora, when you are completely recovered it will look perfect, thanks to results like yours I chose Dr. Sutin as my surgeon for SRS.

Advertising.  Furthermore, in North America, insurance covers a large part of the surgery and Bank, Suporn have been operating for many years.  Also the sutin diamond technique is quite new.  I would have surgery with him but unfortunately I cannot spend 18 days in Thailand.

I&#39;m 6 weeks post revision from Dr Sutin and all I can say is that the swelling will keep going down and appearance will continue to change. Just try your best not to rip any stitches!
</p>
<p>
I have a similar issue as you where the labia minora keeps trying to separate from the labia majora. Even earlier this week I still ripped it a bit despite being 1.5 months out...though I&#39;m a revision case so the skin is far, far tighter than yours.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been using medical tape to hold the labia tightly closed and packed together so it&#39;ll heal up without much separation. Especially on days when I need to leave my house and walk around. When I&#39;m home I just try to keep my legs tightly together as much as possible and walk like a snail.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What probably won‚Äôt is that the labia minora doesn‚Äôt meet at the fourchette, it just goes straight down. Irritating, but not the end of the world and not nonexistent in cis women.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Also I&#39;ll count yourself lucky on this! I remember just a few years ago where the most common complain is that the labia minora stops short and ends just before the vagina, and people were looking for surgeons that extended the labia minora all the way down!
</p>
<p>
Your results look absolutely amazing and you&#39;re going to have so much definition when it heals up!

I will also undergo revision one day ,I had my original surgery also with sutin, how many weeks you need to stop dilating after the revision, I am only 2 years post op and afraid of Losing depth if I skipped dilating for a longer time, also do you have additional noticeable scars after the revision

Dr Sutin recommended at least 4 weeks. I said I haven&#39;t dilated in years so I&#39;ll just go 3 months without dilation, which is the time required to heal before having sex.
</p>
<p>
No noticable scars yet. Dr Sutin&#39;s stitches are very clean in that even I have trouble finding them and I need to press on my skin to feel the stitch. Still, it&#39;s very early and the scars might still pop out later. I will be using silicone gel sheets anyway to reduce/prevent scars.
