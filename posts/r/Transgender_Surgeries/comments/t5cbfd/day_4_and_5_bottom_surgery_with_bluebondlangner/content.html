day four continued. it was a big day. every morning you get a visit from either or both the urology team or plastics team. usually resident doctors. good news for those in Chicago, one of BBL trainees is going to start a practice similar to NYU&#39;s so expect that in the future. i think the Resident said her residency was finishing this June or July. if shes anything like Jun, then i think thatll be another really great option for us.
</p>
<p>
early in the day i had the wound vac taken off. this was a not fun experience. i think in my last post i mentioned my skin kind of blistered from the taping at my abdomen. so that sucks. the worst part about taking the woundvac was actually the cutting of the outer packing around the catheter, it just didnt feel very good. very warbly and icky. i expected a lot more pain from removing the tape, but idk, maybe im just kind of numb right now, as it didnt hurt so bad.
</p>
<p>
my appetite kind of came back with a vengeance and so that was really nice. i was still nervous about nausea so kept up the nausea medicine and gasx regimen. my nurses kind of halted my senna regimen which a resident found odd. just goes to show you really need to advocate for yourself when it comes to the &#34;optional&#34; meds.
</p>
<p>
i walked about five laps on day four. i really recommend moving. for a few reasons: moves gas and fluids in you, wakes up your bowels and gets them moving, and SUPER IMPORTANT, reduces swelling (and clot risk) and helps wake up your bladder. day four is when you get the woundvac off, the catheter out, and you shower. big day. if you cant empty your bladder enough over the night they have to put it back in before you leave. i was super worried about that because it doesnt feel great coming out, going in sounds not fun. if you are concerned, you can actually train your bladder long before you get into the hospital: exercise, drink fluids, and pee when you need to. holding pee in kind of trains your bladder to expand and not really dump everything, so if you are in the practice of peeing whenever you have to, this sets you up for success. they told me that 30% of patients need the catheter back in.
</p>
<p>
if you have blisters ask for barrier cream for your shower. its a thick paste that wont easily come off and it will keep you from stinging. the shower is kind of uncomfortable. i get really shaky in these scenarios, and its kind of cold in the room, and youre in soggy socks. idk, still was nice to rinse.
</p>

day 5, today.
</p>
<p>
really decent sleep, catheter came out 10pm the night before. i peed at 3am and 6am, and after my first dilation. the day started with dr Zhao coming in at like 6am ish to take out the packing. yes. its a weird feeling, and you will bleed a bit, and it feels kinda nausea inducing. i didnt enjoy it lol. i def needed a breather. but after thats out, you feel a bit more comfy.
</p>
<p>
later checked on by zhao and bbl. i had some pain inside my vagina which they said was normal and like a giant clot of blood came out, which BBL snagged. you will bleed a bit. its kind of like having your first and last period at the beginning here. theyll tell you how much is too much blood (soaking like 3 pads in like an hour).
</p>
<p>
kevin is amazing. really. he does a great job easing you into dilation and teaching you how to do it without making it hurt. im surprised with how much pressure is needed to get it in. if you can, start doing yoga now to learn how to manage your breath and relaxation. his opinion is that it should be a mandatory pre op thing to do, and i kind of agree. anyway, you do a dilation, then he leaves you alone ti recover a bit, he returns and teaches you to douche, ez pz. then you dilate, are given a huge set of goodies and prescription, and are ready to go home. i left the hospital at like 11:30a.
</p>
<p>
as far as results. its a little beat up, but honestly, kind of perf. everyone was saying how it just really fit my body, and how surprisingly not swollen it is. im looking forward to seeing how she heals.
</p>
<p>
I curse nydot for not fixing their roads.
</p>
<p>
anywho, overall, glad to be out. kevin suggested that if you get as nauseous as i do (post operative nausea and vomiting) theres a patch they can give you. i forgot what its called, but i wish i knew that. best advice is to (politely) stay on the nurses, bring snacks because mealtimes are just not convenient and its better to graze, try to move around, prepare your body beforehand, and stay positive. you got this.
</p>
<p>
feel free to ask me any questions!
