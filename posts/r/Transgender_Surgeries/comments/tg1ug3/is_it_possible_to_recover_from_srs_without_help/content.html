I‚Äôm unfortunately in a position where I don‚Äôt really have people in my life who could look after me for awhile. My friends and family are very far away and struggling with their own problems. I will be living on my own soon. Is recovery something I could do alone?

Strongly advise against it. I was bed ridden for a month and could not have done this alone. I couldn‚Äôt stand for more than 10 seconds.  You never know if you will be okay or not so make sure someone is there.

Some people will tell you that they did it alone and it was fine, but it requires luck for it to play out like that. SRS is one of the most invasive surgeries you can get considering the proximity to various important parts of the body and direct impact on things like peeing. You can&#39;t know for sure you won&#39;t need help, it&#39;s a huge gamble to go alone.

I could not have recovered alone. It would have almost certainly been the death of me.
</p>
<p>
There is no words to describe how powerless and feeble I was following my surgery. My partner was with me, and she was my literal lifeline.
</p>
<p>
You won&#39;t just need physical support, you will need emotional support. I got my grs procedure at 39yo, and I&#39;ve been waiting since I was 16yo. (Thanks insurance for finally catching up!) You&#39;d think I was more ready emotionally but I was not. There was so many emotions that I was not prepared for. You also have to assume complications- of which I had a few.
</p>
<p>
Get a support structure if you can. Make arrangements. Make friends. Find trans groups if you must. You will need help.

I spent the first month alone in a hotel. Walking around, taking showers, going to the bathroom, etc. sure is a pain in the ass. It is doable but very exhausting. I had the room service bring me the food to my bed but worst case would have been able to get it myself. Walking isn&#39;t the painful part. Bending over or moving your knees up is. It does get better relatively quickly. I had mine with Suporn. So probably the worst possible recovery time you could end up with for reference. It took a year until my energy levels were back at 100% but could care for myself within the first 1-2 weeks.

I strongly advise against it.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
With sufficient forethought and some extra cash, you can pre-plan around most stuff (Paper plates to prevent dishes, for instance) but you need everything to be ultra-clean. Bleaching the bathtub several times a day for one. Changing bedsheets regularly. Laundering towels.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know where you will be living but many large cities have some sort of trans recovery agency that you can get a room in for a month. If you have enough cash saved up you could look in to general recovery hospices, or just hire a maid to visit once a day to take care of at least some of it.

An especially if you tear a stitch in your new vagina while dilating, yes, pending how serious the tear is, you may need to be rescued ( ambulance EMT ) and be taken/sent to the hospital for immediate surgery. Better to be safe than sorry.

Unfortunately there is no definitive yes or no here.  My aunt came with me to surgery itself, but she was only in town until the day after I was discharged so I only had her for literally 24 hours.  The next 3 weeks I stayed in town I was living alone in an apartment (Airbnb) and I was able to take care of myself.  First couple of days were rough energy wise and just getting myself moving, but after that there really weren&#39;t any issues.
</p>
<p>
However, as several other people have posted they couldn&#39;t have done it without help from others.
</p>
<p>
Every single person&#39;s body is different and they recover from surgery differently so there unfortunately is no surefire way of knowing if you&#39;ll need assistance or not.  That being said sometimes insurance does cover visiting nursing and/or home health care so that might be something to explore as well.

No imo. You are seriously underestimating recovery if you&#39;re even considering it. I am at day 7 after recovery. Every extra step, squat, grocery lift compromises you. Dilation consumes you. You WILL have some weird small complication that will suck up whatever tiny amount of goodwill you have (my Cath and wound vac failed at home)
</p>
<p>
I have had a relatively good 7 days and I am still telling you if you were me you&#39;d never be able to do it alone. My gf who lives with me has earned a wedding ring in this week alone, from cooking every meal to cleaning to taking me to the ER to letting me simply be weak and scared and cry on her shoulder.
</p>
<p>
I have 0 regrets and I&#39;m positive this will be one of the great things to ever happen to me - and yet this is still the hardest week I&#39;ve ever endured. And I have like 9 more to go before I can mostly live my old life again.

Maybe look into hiring someone for a little while. You‚Äôll also probably need to hire a driver that you can prove is booked at least somewhat far in advance and isn‚Äôt rideshare or a taxi.

I also don‚Äôt advice for this either. Regardless if a hotel housekeeper is there to change your sheets, linen and such. There not going to be there to take you to the emergency room if you have any emergency days after/weeks after surgery. Who‚Äôs gonna feed you if your bed ridden? Help you up from the bed to take you the shower? I luckily had two people helping me. I didn‚Äôt know them until they told me they too where transgender, one had their surgery done long ago, and other still waiting for her turn to have surgery. I had a massive migraine and past out in the shower while the shower and my partner rushes in, sat me on the bathroom floor, then moved me to two chairs, laid me down over it as she tried to figure out who to call ( my other partner who went out for groceries ) came back and took me to the non-emergency medical facility where I got diagnosed with Adult Onset Migraines. If it wasn‚Äôt for them who rescued me, I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be today.

This is a common scenario and things like this, really CAN HAPPEN. And other complications too.  SRS recovery is a Pandora&#39;s box, you&#39;ll never know what WILL  happen... And WHEN. But you gotta be prepared for anything crazy or unexpected.
</p>
<p>
My recovery was a total nightmare till 2 months, then 2 weeks I was fine and feeling much better, getting into life again, then it all went down again. All due complications, infections, and being unable to pay for food, services, medicines and having a fucking rest. I couldn&#39;t sit on a chair before the 3 months mark... Was standing, or in bed all the time. Eating standing for almost 3 months was like &#34;oh well, seems that I&#39;ll never sit again&#34;. Infections broke my dilation schedule and it was disastrous. Local doctors couldn&#39;t fucking know how to help me. They prescribed mountains of medicines that didn&#39;t help.
</p>
<p>
Neovaginas are something like not of this Earth for them. They won&#39;t help you and you&#39;ll waste money.... But if you&#39;re in a big city maybe you&#39;ll find someone who actually had experience or did some capacitation. But better your surgeon is following you up even by WhatsApp or email. You&#39;ll be sending pics daily or weekly.
</p>
<p>
I live alone. Nobody to help me in the moment of pain, falling to the ground due to sharp pain on the groin or pelvic zone.
</p>
<p>
If not for friends that went to the market, pharmacy, brought me foods, called the phone for more assistance (laundry, house cleaning), I won&#39;t be here writing as if nothing.
</p>
<p>
No. Impossible when there ARE a chance of complications. I hope it to be normal, but turned out to be the worst nightmare if my life. So.... Don&#39;t let nothing aside as &#34;no, this won&#39;t happen to me&#34; because there&#39;s no way to know beforehand. Just be prepared for anything bad, and this means, you better have MONEY to solve it if it goes bad.
</p>
<p>
No. Recovering alone is a NO-NO. Your risking your life, believe me. The best scenario is 2 weeks in the facility, with nurses and hotel staff and all is going fine but it&#39;s hard anyway. Complications like dehiscences and infections, prolapse or wild things csn happen to anyone, you better be prepared for that just in case, but always having people that can help you if it happens.
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t prepared for this. It was a total nightmare and if you ask me, I regret traveling alone. Back home I required assistance from 4 different people almost every day. It doesn&#39;t means it will happen to you, I&#39;m just saying that possibilities are there for you. You don&#39;t need luck, you need to be prepared and have money and people to help you.

I would strongly recommend against it unfortunately :( I was not able to really walk more than a few minutes at a time for my first week and I certainly would have been in trouble deal with supplies more than a few times. You may have to pay someone to do it.

Not for at least the first 2 weeks. Well 3 and in I&#39;ve been alone, but there have been hard moments. First 2 weeks would be best impossible alone though.

Better to assume you will rather than not.  I stock piled and had someone with me. But I was lucky, I never had pain and healed rapidly. So I lucked out. But I did prepare. You just don&#39;t know what will happen.

I probably

have done it... but I would have done it in tears and hopelessly... it is a REALLY difficult recovery for a while. Everyday things are so tiring... you should have a friend with you at the very least...

I needed help with everything for about a week. Mine was PPV, so it was less invasive than a non-PPV vaginoplasty; I imagine that would be worse.  Plan for a couple weeks to be safe.
</p>
<p>
Maybe ask around your local trans community to see if there is anyone who is willing to help, even in shifts?

Sure, you just need to have extra money for nursing care. You don&#39;t physically need friends but you&#39;ll need people helping you at least for the immediate period after surgery.

It&#39;s possible, but you really have to assume worst case scenarios.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 10 days into recovery. It might theoretically be possible for me to do everything, but it would be really fucking hard. Having someone to handle household cleaning, groceries and making me saline makes all the difference in the world. And that&#39;s with no complications or anything (so far).
