Is it worth getting an orchiectomy if I know I want a full vaginoplasty eventually?

On one hand short recovery, maybe alleviates some dysphoria, and I&#39;m assuming I would no longer have to take spiro? On the other not sure if it could complicate further surgeries down the line, or if it would really have any meaningful benefits in the first place compared to just waiting it out for a vaginoplasty.

I had an orchiectomy about 1.5 years before my GCS. For me it was great. It got me off Spiro, made tucking a lot easier and most importantly removed the fear of loosing progress if I could not keep my T suppressed. It took off a lot of pressure to get something done quickly and I was more comfortable taking my time and finding the right surgeon and procedure for me.

It&#39;s really just a personal/life choice...
</p>
<p>
Recovery times are probably the biggest factor, after the cost and risk of two surgeries.
</p>
<p>
Does you current life/job/family work right now for the recovery from a vaginoplasty? X

To be honest my current situation is probably as good as it&#39;s gonna get for surgery recovery. I&#39;m actually having FFS in a few months for this exact reason. I guess I&#39;m maybe assuming that getting a vaginoplasty will inherently take a lot more time to actually schedule and wait for, and an orchiectomy might be a more immediately accessible option.

You may be right about the orchi happening sooner, but it depends on your location, procedure type, surgeon and ofc... COVID! ðŸ˜•

You may be surprised on GCS surgeon availability.  Consider doing a consult with the one(s) you&#39;re considering and maybe plan backward.

Seriously, there is no comparison between the recovery of these two surgeries. None. You could get an orchie and be back at work in less than 5 days, maybe less. When you have a vaginoplasty it&#39;s the most invasive and difficult surgery you will --most likely, every have. And that&#39;s even if it goes well. It&#39;s like one of them is a full blown Thanksgiving dinner with friends and family and the other one is a Mcdonald&#39;s Ice cream cone you bought because all you had was some change.

It depends on how much of a hassle it is for you. Me? I had it covered by healthcare in my country, so I totally went for it.
</p>
<p>
The dysphoria relief was great, and not having to take AAs was great. I had a successful SRS a year and a half later.
</p>
<p>
I
<em>
did
</em>
, however, consult with my SRS surgeon prior to having orchi, for any special instructions. They told me to stretch my scrotum skin daily until my SRS, to prevent atrophy.

I believe it is well worth it.      I can see a probable path by which I transition socially and with FFS and VFS within 2 years.  I see little possibility of affording GCS or any other desired procedures any more soon than 7 years from now.
</p>
<p>
I do not want to live with these dysphoria generators metaphorically hanging over my head...
</p>
<p>
...No, I don&#39;t do handstands that often.

It is worth every penny for the very reasons you gave.
