Typically, when surgeons are referring to body contouring, they mean liposuction with fat grafting to the buttock and hip area. You may see it referenced as BBL or Brazillian Buttlift. However the liposuction may not be limited to the midsection, it can be between the thighs, the upper back, basically wherever you want to reduce girth. This is a common procedure, I&#39;ve had it done twice but it was about 16 years ago now. Surgeons tend to be more aggressive about it now, but it comes with a higher risk.
</p>
<p>
Then you have both hip and butt implants that are available to move beyond the fat grafting and lipo results. Don&#39;t forget the BA can also play a role here.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that there are more specialized procedures for people who have the money and feel like it&#39;s what they need. There abdominal muscle tightening that it much like a sophisticated abdominoplasty. It also comes with the same scars. There&#39;s also the rare rib removal, where the floating ribs are removed and Clavicle shortening, this reduces the shoulder width. Needless to say the last to are fairly pricey and rarely considered as part of anyone&#39;s definition of body contouring.
</p>
<p>
So that&#39;s a good summary of what&#39;s available, but the majority of body contouring is made up of liposuction and fat grafting to the hips and butt.

Body contouring usually means liposuction and then subsequent fat grafting to the hips and buttocks.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had it concurrent with breast augmentation. Depending on where they lipo it is more or less uncomfortable. Inner thighs are probably the most painful in my experience but in general lipo is kinda painful for several days, a week and then not so bad after. There is a lot of aftercare involved with it though. Usually you&#39;re wearing a compression garment 24/7 for several weeks. You&#39;ll want to either do self massage or go to a massage therapist to prevent various types of lipo irregularities that can emerge or fibrosis.
</p>
<p>
Depending on where you get fat grafted you have to be careful about putting too much pressure on it. I had fat grafting to my hip dips and I couldn&#39;t side sleep for 6 weeks.
</p>
<p>
If you wanna google it or whatever it&#39;s really just bbl / liposuction depending on what exactly your surgeon means by body contouring.

You&#39;ll find lots of useful information about this on realself, there are plenty of cis women who elect to have these procedures done as well and more than a few have described their experiences there, there are a lot of doctors who are equally helpful in offering advice there too. Try some different search terms, fat transfer, fat grafting, hourglass surgery etc.

I had body feminisation surgery last  November with Dr. Aslani in Marbella.  It&#39;s been ok but I need to go back this November for round 2.  The difference between pre op and post op (now 5 months) is huge but not huge enough.  When I woke up from surgery my butt and hips were huge, really huge and I loved it but regretfully it goes away to more normal levels.  It was really hard to recover from, not because it&#39;s painful or anything, to be honest I did not feel much pain but it&#39;s the sleeping on your front and not being able to sit without a BBL cushion for 6 weeks.  And you have to wear a faja too with two waste binders - one forward one backward, oh and then there is the tummy board and this triangular board one has to wear in the small of your back but this is only for a week.  You need to be in good shape, I mean no smoking or anything like that.  If you are over weight like I was you may run the risk of loose tummy skin which is only resolved with a tummy tuck and that&#39;s a big ask.  I might have to have one following BBL round 2.  If you have your boobs done at the same time, if means the recovery will be a bit harder but Aslani does this all the time.  BTW Aslani is quite funny.  I really like him.  He reminds me of my dad, they look similar.  Lol.  The procedure costed me 8,100 euros for round 1 and 4, 100 for round 2.  It&#39;s not cheap but he is a safe surgeon to goto.  I went on my own which I wouldn&#39;t recommend and during lockdown.  I thought I was going to be stranded in Spain and would have to learn Spanish.  No abla de espanyol.  Anyways, I am waffling on.  I guess I&#39;m happy enough with the outcome of round 2 because I&#39;m going to go through it all again.  The faja has to then be worn for a further 6 weeks post op - 12 in total.  Gulp!  Best wishes xx

Is it really only â‚¬100 for round 2, or is that a typo and you&#39;re missing a 0? Either way, that seems rather cheap.
