Hello beautiful people.
<br>
I am 6 month on HRT, and I thought my hair would have gotten slightly better by now. I am 25.
<br>
I take finasteride every other day 1/3 of 5 mg, estrofem 2 mg 3 times a day and bicatulamide 50mg 1x per day.
</p>
<p>
I had my first ffs procedure, a rhinoplasty in June 2019, I am very happy with my decision although some small areas could be improved. My question to you all is, do you know what is the best surgeon to perform the above mentioned part of FFS, the hairline feminisation? My hair is quite fine, and I have a big forehead with big receding hairline, it is my biggest insecurity ever to a point I thought of committing suicide and &#39;start over&#39;, I know, quite extreme, but the mental health aspect of it, is very real.
</p>
<p>
I heard Facial Team for FFS is one of the best in Europe, Dr.Bart from 2pass seems to be having some negative reputation.
<br>
How does someone afford such surgery? If I could do it tomorrow I would.
</p>
<p>
My questions are:
</p>
<p>
1- Which is the best place in Europe for a Hair transformation surgery?
<br>
2- Any suggestions on how to afford it?
<br>
3- Any suggestions regarding the maintenance of the hair I have? I currently sleep with my wig on, so I don&#39;t have to deal with that image on the mirror.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your help, it feels comforting to know that there is a group/support system one can reach and feel less lonely. This journey is not that easy, specially with no friends and no family.

If you are going to lower your hairline during FFS, I think the transplant folks want you to do that first...heal and then get the transplants.  Check first.

I can recommend Dr Albertini in Zurich. I had a surgery with him 2 years ago and he’s amazing. He not just fixed my male baldness but also created a female hairline.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I paid myself for the surgery. It costed me 10,000 chf. It’s very expensive in comparison but Dr Albertini is really great.
</p>
<p>
After surgery you have to
</p>
<p>
1 eat pills
</p>
<p>
2 don’t hit your head - especially when in car
</p>
<p>
3 moisture transplanted hair every like 10 minutes. Even when you wake up at night - go and moisture your hair
</p>
<p>
It took about 2 weeks I think. After that crusts started to drop and hair started to grow. There was no procedures after recovery is finished. Hair is here and they are growing.
</p>
<p>
What was scary for me - is that both donor and recipient area have to be shaved. Doctor shaved 2 or 3 patches in my nape. I was afraid it will be visible. But this patches were covered by my other hair, so even my colleagues didn’t recognize that I made a surgery. Recipient area I also covered with my other hair

Thanks for sharing the info:) I&#39;m planning to go to him this year:) Do you mind a couple of questions?
</p>
<p>
Is he familiar with hair transplants for feminisation? What is his attitude toward trans patients? Do you know, how is his work compared to others like FacialTeam as I read that FT don&#39;t transfer that much hair?
</p>
<p>
Cheers:)

He’s amazing, hair transplant is his main occupation so he does lots of hair surgeries. I had male baldness on my forehead before. As M2F I asked Dr Albertini to create a feminine hairline. He knew that I am transexual and was very nice to me. He has a great sense of humor and I really liked him. So he did my hairline amazingly. It is very nice now and is natural. I have a round feminine hairline but you cannot say that is was human-made.

fwiw, I had hairline lowering with Dr. Deschamps-Braly and tbh....it didn&#39;t really help - he did his best but I think in more severe receding it doesn&#39;t really make any kind of real improvement, and you&#39;re left with a hairline scar. You probably want to skip straight to transplants.

Maybe, though if OP plans to get additional FFS procedures e.g. forehead work, scalp advancement etc they should do that before opting for transplants.

That&#39;s my point though, that OP should just skip scalp advancement altogether

I understood that from additional research as well, that then the flipping the skin back and consecutive forehead work may actually make you loose all the transplanted hairs. I wonder if Facial team in Spain is a good option for this.

I’m not sure it’s a good idea doing hair transplant before FFS as FFS can change your hair line.
