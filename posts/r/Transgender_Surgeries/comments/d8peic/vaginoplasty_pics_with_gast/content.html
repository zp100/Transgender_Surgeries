Hey folks, I&#39;m hoping to find some pictures of Dr. Gast&#39;s work doing vaginoplasty so I have an idea on what she&#39;s able to do. Anyone know where I can find them? Kind of a side note, but I see on her profile page on the hospital site that she does FFS. Anyone know about that too?

Hi! I know your post is a few years old by now so you may already have the answers you&#39;re looking for, but I wanted to share just in case. I am almost 5 weeks post op with Dr. Gast. I had a zero depth vaginoplasty (also called a vulvoplasty I believe). Everything down there is about half as swollen as it was when I first left the hospital but it&#39;s still pretty puffy so I&#39;m not sure I can help with photos. But even with the swelling I can tell the end result is going to look really nice. I can only speak to my personal experience but I loved Dr. Gast and her team. I felt extremely safe and cared for while I was there. I honestly didn&#39;t want to leave the hospital because my support system back home is not the best. I did have complications post op with urination. I had to get driven back to UW Health 3 days post op to get a catheter put in because I couldn&#39;t pee. It was a difficult car ride because I was in a lot of pain and live 2 hours away. I think it was a combination of being so swollen and also having blood clots in my urine. (My pee literally looked like a jar of blood after getting the catheter put in). Since then everything has been okay though. I got the catheter out and am on antibiotics for a UTI but am in no pain and can move around better everyday. As far as the pictures, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a UW Health policy or something, but they may have pictures they can show you when you go in for your consultation. I thought I remembered someone mentioning that when I was there. I originally planned on getting both the vaginoplasty and breast augmentation together, but decided against the breast augmentation about a week before my surgery. I got kinda sketched out by reading stories of breast implant illness. I also have facial feminization appointments scheduled in a few months. I&#39;ll be getting surgery on my nose and laser hair removal completed. Those are scheduled through Dr. Chaiet&#39;s office.

You&#39;re not going to get any pics from Gast herself- idk if it&#39;s UW policy on no &#34;sexual&#34; pictures, or her own hesitancy. I&#39;ve researched a lot of surgeons, and she&#39;s the only one with no public pictures.
</p>
<p>
If you look on FB, there&#39;s a group called &#34;Patients of Dr Katherine Gast&#34; where some girls who have had surgery with her have offered to share results with others considering the surgery.

That&#39;s a bummer. I&#39;ll have to look into that group, thank you!
