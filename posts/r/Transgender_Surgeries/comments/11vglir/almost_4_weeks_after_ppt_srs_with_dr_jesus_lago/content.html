Hi, Since there are very little reviews about this surgeon I decided to share my experience which overall was very positive... Background: Im from Poland, Im 31 years old, Im on HRT for about 7 years, Ive had FFS (facialteam) and VFS (yeson) before. I funded everything from my own pocket, there are no insurances in Poland. I read a ton of horror stories (about other surgeons) here so I was pretty anxious before the surgery but fortunately dr allowed me to take lorazepam.
</p>
<p>
Day 0: I arrived early, signed a ton of papers and got into surgery room. There was a rock music playing and it turned out that the anesthesiologist spoke Polish so I was able to speak a few words to him in my native language. He even agreed to place the cannula in a different place than my palm (I hate when its there). The surgery took about 8 hours. During the night Ive had a bleeding which looked scary however the hospital staff reacted quickly. Next day I received iron through the iv line since I lost a lot of blood cells.
</p>
<p>
Day 1: not much happening, couldnt walk since I was too weak after the bleeding. Dr told me he achieved very good depth. The hospital food (I asked for vegan option) was horrible but I tried to eat everything anyway since I wanted to heal quickly. My main problem was insomnia, I was able to sleep for 2-3 hours after ton of sleeping pills. But with each passing day it got better. The main issue in the hospital was that basically no one spoke english so communicating was really hard.
</p>
<p>
Day 2: I tried to walk and sit on a chair. First time I fainted. Then I tried to walk to toilet, also failed (almost fainted)
</p>
<p>
Day 3: I was able to walk and take a shower without faiting. I was given I was given a prescription for medications (paracetamol for pain) and discharged from the hospital, got taxi to the apartment. Tried to take another shower at home which was scary since I almost fainted but I managed to lie down on the bed
</p>
<p>
Day 4: back to work. I started to work at my laptop for a few hours a day.
</p>
<p>
Day 5: I was able to sit without the donut pillow without any pain. The only pain Ive had came from the carether (hate it)
</p>
<p>
Day 6: I was able to take longer showers and wash my hair (they are high maintenance)
</p>
<p>
Day 8: first consultation, started dilations. Was able to walk for about an hour with my piss in a bag :)
</p>
<p>
Day 12: I got to the airport and I spend more than an hour trying to find my girlfriend who arrived and got lost there :D
</p>
<p>
Day 13: the carether was removed, I was able to pee without any problems. Was able to walk for 1,5h
</p>
<p>
Day 14: stopped taking paracetamol since there was almost no pain. I tried to take walks to parks etc every day. Started cooking and going to shop myself again.
</p>
<p>
Day 16: another consultation, dr complained that it heals too quickly down there so I need to make much more progress with dilations asap
</p>
<p>
Day 23: last consultation. I&#39;m able to walk really quickly (almost like running)
</p>
<p>
Day 24: back to Poland. I cleaned the apartment myself. At the airport I lifted my and my girfriend baggages (each one of them weighted about 30kg) without much effort
</p>
<p>
Day 25: started driving my car again without any problems, so far only short distances but next week I plan to take longer road trips and speak at the transgender conference in Poland
</p>
<p>
That was my experience so far. I paid 13950 euro. If you have any questions please feel free to ask :)

Thank you for the feedback. He was one of the names I had heard about that&#39;s near me (I&#39;m from Portugal) but I hadn&#39;t heard anything eles here about him. I&#39;m still going to search more though, but it&#39;s good knowing it went well for you and so is your recovery so far

Did the consultations post operatively take place with you or on line via Zoom call ? I assume you must be very young and how are you now ? Congratulations ü•≥

Hi, after your surgery was it difficult to find your clitoris? It‚Äôll be 2 months since my surgery on Sunday and I don‚Äôt have any sensation and I still can‚Äôt see my clitoris. Moreover, the anatomy isn‚Äôt correct, my ‚Äúclitoris‚Äù (wherever it is) sits way too high.

Hi! I&#39;m trying to find someone who got the surgery from Dr. Lago and thank you so much for sharing your experience. How are you now two years later? Do you still need to do dilatation? Would you recommend him?
