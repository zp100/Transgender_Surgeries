I&#39;m told the whole surgery only took 40 minutes. The surgeon recommended General Anesthesia so I went with it, Dr. Ong is fantastic. I went to the surgery center at 9am and was home by 12:30p. 1 hour surgery prep, 1 hour surgery and 1 hour recovery at the surgery center. I&#39;ve felt some minor discomfort as I move around, but nothing I can truly describe as painful. The surgeon prescribed me a week&#39;s worth of painkillers if necessary and so far I&#39;ve only needed the one pill following recovery. I feel pretty great! Excited for you too! I&#39;ve wanted this for years. Edit: additional info - there are no stitches externally, as you can see. The surgeon used a glue instead. Dermabond.

That&#39;s wonderful! I&#39;m glad it&#39;s going so smoothly!! I&#39;m seeing Dr. Sherie on the 31st, I&#39;ve been told it should be a similar experience, and I&#39;m taking about a week and a half off before going back to work on light duty.

Awesome! Best wishes for your experience! I am pretty lucky that my job hasn&#39;t required anyone back at the office yet. I took off the day of surgery and then Monday and Tuesday, but tbh... I did that as an excuse to play Elden Ring.

You don&#39;t sound rude, but my dick size has decreased over the last 4 years of HRT. That attrition in size isn&#39;t necessarily directly caused
<em>
by
</em>
the HRT itself, but from the decreased occurrences of erections and my general disinterest in masturbating. It&#39;s not a big loss in size, but it has been noticeable.
<br>
The orchiectomy was just the removal of both testicles, which were also already small due to aggressive use of anti-androgens when I was DIY several years ago.
<br>
Right now, it&#39;s all a little swollen and won&#39;t really be a good time for judging the size of anything. I&#39;ll keep posting a few screenshots and updates over the next 2 weeks.

Ok. Please, don’t stop posting! Maybe I&#39;ll do the same surgery, so it would be really helpful to see your results.
</p>
<p>
The same happened to me during the HRT. My dick looks smaller than already was before. But I have lots of questions about that surgery, I’ve been searching many times about it and how the dick looks after that, but there ain’t no answers..

An orchiectomy shouldn&#39;t change the size or shape of your dick unless there&#39;s some special circumstances that I&#39;m not aware of. It is also generally functional after an orchi, though some people like to use a T gel on the penis to maintain/enhance function and maintain size.
</p>
<p>
Maintaining size can be important if you are planning to get vaginoplasty.

Yes, honey! That’s why I said I already have a small dick. I’m not sure if I’m gonna do a vaginoplasty in the future, but in case I decide to, I don’t want my dick to be smaller than already is, I don’t think is necessary my dick be smaller than it is. Cuz the doctors say that the size influence the vagina’s depth

Yup that can be important depending on which version of surgery you get.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re interested in maintaining size for future surgery definitely talk to your provider about supplementing with a T gel. They can help decide whether that would be helpful for you.
</p>
<p>
I also have a small dick, but I&#39;m so far away from bottom surgery that right now I just want everything smooshed as flat as possible so I don&#39;t have to see it or think about it lol

I have a copay plan through Cigna insurance with a deductible of $2500 that I haven&#39;t met yet. The total of the bill was $2,700 (the surgeon&#39;s fee was $200 and the other $2500 is charged by the surgery center).
<br>
So it cost me $2500 and my deductible is now fully paid for the year.
<br>
The surgery center is billing me in halves, so it cost me $1250 up front and I&#39;ll owe the other $1250 the first week in April.
</p>
<p>
With my deductible met now, I can book more consultations for other things like FFS or SRS and get those scheduled for this year and I&#39;ll only owe 15% of whatever those surgeries end up costing with an out of pocket maximum of $3750 for this year.

That looks so good ... Looking forward to pics in a couple of weeks after the swelling goes down. What in the name /type /description of that orchi. Technically speaking.? Hoping to have one in the next twelve months. Been on HRT for 12 years, so everything has shrunk nicely.

Thanks! It was listed as a bilateral orchiectomy on the paperwork, but that just means they&#39;re removing both testes. I don&#39;t know if there are additional terms to describe the approach the surgeon took.

It is a bag of emotions, isn&#39;t it. I was a tiny bit sad but overall it was relieving that I no longer had them. I hope that you don&#39;t have any complications.
</p>
<p>
After the swelling goes down, tucking is a breeze. A pair of firm underwear is all you need.

I haven&#39;t used ice at all. Just resting and not wearing underwear or pants right now. I&#39;ve taken a few painkillers for the discomfort and some ibuprofen when I first wake up. Best wishes for you tomorrow! I hope you have an easy recovery as well!

Thank you so much for replying. I may go commando like you did. I have heard multiple people mention ice so I figured it was a needed thing. If it starts swelling I will ice it otherwise it seems like just keeping them from getting jostled in the trick. Good luck on your continuing recovery and thank you for sharing your experience.

Fantastic!

I know how you feel. I had my orchiectomy thirty years ago.
