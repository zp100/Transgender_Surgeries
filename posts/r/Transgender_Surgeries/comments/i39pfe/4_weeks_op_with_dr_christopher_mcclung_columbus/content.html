I also had Dr McClung do my surgery 8 months ago. Iâ€™m extremely happy with the results.

I have a consultation schedule for the 5th with Dr. McClung. This post popped up somehow while I was doing research and I am pretty pleased to see some good words, very relaxing.
</p>
<p>
Hoping all my required letters and everything got sent over properly, my plan is the call the office in the morning and verify my appointment time and if documentation was received.
</p>
<p>
Hoping the wait isn&#39;t terribly long.

Have you met with him before?  Heâ€™s a super nice guy!! Glad to make you feel more reassured that was my goal with this post :)
</p>
<p>
Best of luck to you on getting a surgery date thatâ€™s not too far out.  Idk how it is now with this pandemic mess but I think you should be fine with getting a date not too far out :)

I have not, but I received a referral. I keep getting mixed signals on what letters they actually require when so my intention is the follow up on everything tomorrow and then make a big list of stuff I want to ask.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard some really wonderful things about him which does wonders for my anxiety about it. I&#39;ve also heard the wait isn&#39;t very long which would do wonders for me as well.
</p>
<p>
What documentation did his office require letter-wise, and did they require anything else?

There werenâ€™t any letters that his office specifically needed.  The letters that were needed were for them to send to my insurance (Anthem) so they wouldnâ€™t consider my surgery as cosmetic.
</p>
<p>
My insurance required: A letter from a therapist A letter from a psychologist (so a therapist with a PHD) A letter from my general practitioner  And then a letter from Dr McClung himself

Hearing Anthem here just makes me happier, I&#39;m under Anthem BCBS.
</p>
<p>
Those letters sound pretty much exactly like what they described over the phone so I think maybe the person talking to me thought I was referring to insurance? I have no idea, still calling to clarify but I feel a LOT better.

Seriously, thank you for this thread. I was scouring the corners of the internet to find relevant information and you made this thread at the most perfect time and it&#39;s been helpful!

I finally got around to reading this (now that my eyes can focus and I&#39;m not as groggy as I was!)
</p>
<p>
I cant echo your words about Dr McClung enough - he&#39;s an incredible person and surgeon!  He did my surgery yesterday and it went very well. Saw him again this AM as he made his rounds and he said everything is looking great and he couldn&#39;t have hoped for better results. I of course have not seen it (omg I have a vagina!) And I&#39;m very nervous about checking it out so gonna wait for a while...  theres soo much packing around it I also don&#39;t wanna screw that up by being curious.
</p>
<p>
I can tell you of at least one difficultie I&#39;ve had so far....gas!  I feel it moving around my abdomen, kept me up most of the night...and I cant get it out!  I&#39;m so ready for a bowel movement too....  but I&#39;m afraid to try.  Not even sure if I can go either....  definitely not going home today as planned. Possibly tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I&#39;ll write my experience up from a computer.

Yeah I do still check this, feel free to message me with your questions!  I am pretty happy how it looks aesthetically, it took a while for the swelling to go down and it to really get there.  I have to get a minor cosmetic revision to clean up an area that healed a bit oddly after a wound separation occurred (super common)

I know you posted this an eternity ago. Iâ€™m currently searching for a bottom surgeon. Would you still recommend Dr. McClung after fully healing?

Looks infected to me, you should have a second look. Discharge is not common, the area looks inflammed in general.

Umm.... what? Discharge is super common (especially in the first couple weeks postop) I donâ€™t think you know what youâ€™re talking about.  I was told it would last 2-3 weeks then go down to a stop which itâ€™s in the process of doing.

Thank you. The brownish yellow discharge usually lasts 4-6 weeks postop (and smells bad ðŸ˜–).  If itâ€™s a different color than that or happens after that period that would be unusual / likely problematic.  Iâ€™ve also got a lot of swelling and some minor bruising (which now has mostly healed up).  Plus a minor wound separation that my surgeon is hopeful will heal on its own like most wound separations do.  I was told worst case (which he thinks thereâ€™s a low chance of) Iâ€™ll need a minor revision that would be a 1hr office visit where he fixes up the area in the case it doesnâ€™t heal it correctly so Iâ€™ve got my fingers crossed it heals itself up with time... ðŸ¤ž
</p>
<p>
this super informative website discusses the discharge and more if youâ€™re interested:

I live in Indiana and didn&#39;t trust the surgeons here, so I was recommended Dr. McClung by my general doctor. I am a month away from surgery, but my insurance didn&#39;t want to give me a &#34;waver&#34; for the out of network fee. So now it looks like I won&#39;t be getting the surgery after all. I feel lost and devastated. Everyone (health professionals) all agreed this was a &#34;lifesaving&#34; procedure, yet on the eve of finally getting it all together money has become the ONLY thing that anyone cares about. I don&#39;t know what to do. I don&#39;t even know why I am writing this to be honest. I have cried too much I am so tired of this. I can&#39;t even have this. This life is such a joke and a lie.
</p>
<p>
Anyways glad your thing went well. enjoy your time
