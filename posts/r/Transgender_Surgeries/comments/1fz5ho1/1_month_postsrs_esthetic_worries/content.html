So it&#39;s been 1 month since I had SRS (PI), and the skin of the labia majora is still pretty loose and puffy and has a wrinkly appearance. I was hoping that as time goes on, the labia will lose some of its puffiness and thus would stick closer to the pelvis, but I have the feeling the opposite is gonna happen and the skin will be even looser as whatever little swelling I still have goes down.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, neither of the labia connect on the underside of the vaginal entrace, and so the opening looks kinda gape-y.
</p>
<p>
Overall I&#39;m happier than I was before, since at least now I can be chill about clothes and stuff, but I&#39;m really disheartened at the prospect of its esthetics.
</p>
<p>
I could do with some encouraging words or at least some advice and/or tips on what might be in my hand to improve the situation.

I get it. But it&#39;s too early. I&#39;m 2 months and have stuff I&#39;m unhappy about, but there is no point worrying. Maybe at 12 months, then it&#39;s time to think about revision, but so much will change down there over that time.

Your way too early to start worrying about what your end results are going to even be close to looking like.  I&#39;m coming up on 6th month post opp and mine keeps looking better and better.
<br>
Omg the first couple of months just try not to look at it.

&#34;The first couple months try not to look at it&#34; is so damn true. You have emlnough to deal with you dont need the stress of worrying about something out of your control and whose current state doesnt inform you much how things will be in a year... Breathe. Trust the process. If you need a revision in the future then you get a revision. But that is not today&#39;s problem. Most surgeons wont even look at you seriously for revisions until a year because they canf even be sure how things will shake out. Mine has looked very different each month, honestly. It sucks and it is frustrating, but letting go is part of the process. Focus on healing.

PI graduate here. 1 month is too soon to make any predictions. Give it about 3-6 months. Thatâ€™s when things start to take shape. The loose skin is completely normal. Itâ€™ll shrink to some extent.
