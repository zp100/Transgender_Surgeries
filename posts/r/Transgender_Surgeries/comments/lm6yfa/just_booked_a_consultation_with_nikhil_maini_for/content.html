I had FFS with Nikhil Maini in December 2020 and he was great, the hospital was great and the results were great. Not only was he trained by Keith Altman, but he worked alongside him for the last 5-6 years, and Keith Altman is still around in a supervisory role (he popped in the morning after my surgery and pronounced himself VERY PLEASED with Nikhil Maini&#39;s work.
</p>
<p>
Seriously, I would NOT be worried. Nikhil Maini is extremely competent, and I&#39;m delighted with his work. With Dr Altman stepping back he&#39;s now one of the UK&#39;s leading facial surgeons. When he&#39;s not doing FFS he does like major skull and jaw reconstructions of people in motorbike crashes and stuff - he&#39;s a proper maxillofacial surgeon, not a cosmetic surgeon who&#39;s trying to cash in on trans women.

He&#39;s not really new, he&#39;s been the main FFS surgeon at Brighton for 5+ years. He just doesn&#39;t advertise his work - apparently he doesn&#39;t need to, since he&#39;s not short of work! Good luck with the consultation!

Glad to hear your surgery went well, are you aware of anywhere that reviews or before and after pics can be found?

He trained under a proper max fax surgeon working for the NHS who successfully operated on UK trans women. None of them ended up botched. You&#39;re also protected under the UK law should anything happen if you go with him.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t be worried just relax and look at the consultation as a way for you to get to know the surgeon. Also good for you NOT to consider 2 Pass slaughter house as I had 2 new UK girls contact me about suing butcher Bart. One said Butcher Bart botched her on purpose the second time as she complained about her botched result from the initial surgery with him. It&#39;s only the beginning of the year and he is botching again.
