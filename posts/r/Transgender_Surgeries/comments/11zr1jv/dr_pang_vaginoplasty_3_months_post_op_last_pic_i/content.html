Fucking incredible. I&#39;m 3.5 WEEKS post op with pang and SO EXCITED to be where you are.
</p>
<p>
Can you tell me about your dilation schedule currently as well as when you started to get to orange or green?
</p>
<p>
Any tips for me still healing?
</p>
<p>
And as far as NSFW stuff, any issues? Did dialition start to feel good rather than uncomfortable at any point?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m trying to find stuff to look forward to or measure my progress against so any help would be much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
You look absolutely amazing and I&#39;m so happy for you.

I still can’t have sex yet because my bf is well endowed and I haven’t quite made it to orange yet! I got to blue and green a bit later than most people because I had complication early on with bleeding and had to stop dilating for a week! Thankfully I didn’t lose any depth or anything. I would say try to get to orange before 3 months if you can but the important thing is keeping the depth you can always gain elasticity over time. Don’t rush it most people I talk to aren’t able to have PIV sex until 5 or 6 months post op some people even take up to a year, everyone is different and no need to rush!

Have you had an orgasm yet? Or no?
</p>
<p>
How is walking and moving in general?
</p>
<p>
Has sensation returned mostly?
</p>
<p>
Have you tried any sex toys?

Yes many many orgasms they are amazing so much better! A lot harder to achieve but better!  I can move and do everything normally now I can literally do everything I could before now! Sensation is still coming back that takes like 6 months to get everything back but I have like 90% of sensation back the inside of my vagina is just still not 100% there yet. I have use vibrator but I’m still a little too hyper sensitive for that atm but I know it’s going to be great I do wanna try some small dildos soon!

I still find dilating pretty uncomfortable at fist but once it’s in it feels kind of good and I can get the green in easily when I start with blue and I get orange in like almost to the first dot for like 5 mins

Highly recommend. He&#39;s a good guy and does good work. You don&#39;t meet with him a ton but trust me, he&#39;s good at what he does and they will make sure you are taken care of.

Agreed I highly recommend their team! Most surgeons you aren’t going to meet with that often that’s why I love their nursing team!

The overnight nurse in the surgery center was so so so sweet. She let me order food. Made me tons of food, would just sit there and talk to me for hours. It was incredible. She was the nicest person ever.

Sure
</p>
<p>
He uses a hybrid method of penile inversion along with grafted tissue and peritonial tissue, the lining of an abdomen, that lining has no hair and also produces a mucus membrane. In fact it&#39;s the closest to a cis vaginal mucus membrane you can get.
</p>
<p>
The hair that does exist on the penis or grafted tissue he does a follicle scrape on. So during surgery he literally scrapes all the follicles out of the skin.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s what I was told when I asked:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Hello XXXXXXX,
</p>
<p>
I followed up with Dr. Pang and he specifically does not require hair removal for a full depth vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
His response was:
</p>
<p>
“Surgeons across our field vary widely on hair removal practices, and many (several in SF as well), like myself, do not require it. There is no medical literature to suggest outcomes vary based on hair removal. In the operating room, I scrape the skin free of hair follicles and use hairless peritoneal graft to decrease the amount of hair bearing skin used.”
</p>
<p>
If you would not like to do hair removal that is fine to not start and we can keep your surgery date in XXXXXXX. &#34;

The one correction is he actually doesn’t do the pull through he just uses peritoneal grafting, which he said is better because it doesn’t risk losing depth as easily!

That looks amazing! I have mine with Dr Pang in June. I had a hard time formulating questions and asking the nursing team. RE Suporn method - I had an orchi over a year ago so no tunica vaginalis to pull tissue from. I just inquired what tissue would be used and if hair removal would be needed given my circumstances. I&#39;m thinking urethral splaying will be one.

I have also had an orchiectomy, my consultant with Dr Pang is next month.  Are there any questions you regret not asking at the consultation?

Absolutely. I&#39;d ask for more details about the tissues used, the recovery timeline - I don&#39;t have a lot of money so I&#39;m trying to lock in deals and what not. Being discharged before packing removal and then coming back 5 days later is causing logistical issues for me and my caregiver. I&#39;d want more details as to why, if I could stay longer, and if there are complications and how they would deal with that (stay in, transfer to hospital etc).  I&#39;d also ask to talk to Dr Pang in person, I live in Illinois, so far it&#39;s been phone/video with the surgery nurse Debby. She&#39;s great and I still want the reassurance of meeting the surgeon in person at least once sooner rather than right before.

Thank you for the details, knowing the consultant is with a surgery nurse is good.  I would have been surprised when the zoom call didn’t match any pictures of Pang.  With surgery in June will you meet him at date of surgery?  I get studying my anatomy is not necessary but meeting the person who is altering my life is important.
