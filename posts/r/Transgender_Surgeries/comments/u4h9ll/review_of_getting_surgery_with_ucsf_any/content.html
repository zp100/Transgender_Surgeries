<h1>
TL;DR: UCSF hospitals have GARBAGE trans care.
</h1>
<p>
I had an orchi with Dr Smith at UCSF Parnassus recently. Dr Smith was mostly good, though not a fan of his office (later in post). Due to my own medical complications they were unable to do the surgery in the outpatient clinic, and so it was done in the main hospital.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pre-op
</strong>
: I received a phone call that gave me information about my surgery, times, dates, fasting instructions etc. I asked the nurse calling me if I could have written instructions and I was told that they were unavailable to be sent to me. So I wrote down what I could and did my best to follow. Absurd, 3/10, at least they gave me accurate instructions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
At the hospital
</strong>
: Immediately misgendered by the first nurse I interacted with, who had access to see my female legal name, my pronouns, and gender identity. I was then misgendered over and over and over again by every person who referred to me in the 3rd person, even &#34;Hey

man.&#34; They all had access to my name and pronouns. The surgeon and anesthesiologist did not misgender me. Almost funny how pathetic it was. 0/10.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The surgery itself:
</strong>
Everything smooth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Post-op:
</strong>
One of the first things I heard upon waking up from anesthesia was multiple nurses misgendering me. I loudly asked them to stop, still unable to keep my eyes open. They started doing the &#34;he--
<em>
pause
</em>
--she&#34; thing. My chart has my pronouns as &#34;they/them&#34;. Eventually they switched to just a slight pause before calling me &#34;she&#34;. Still wanted to be called &#34;they&#34;.
</p>
<p>
The Dr wrote me a deeply inadequate prescription for pain meds, and then sent them to a home delivery pharmacy. A nurse approached me to let me know they were going to be delivered, and asked if that was okay.... like... you want me to wait a week before I get my pain meds? She then tried to send them to a local pharmacy after I freaked out about waiting a week... then I had to be the one to ask if the pharmacy she was sending it to was even open (it was night by that point). In turn she asked me if I knew of any late night pharmacies.... Keep in mind I can barely keep my eyes open and am coming out of anesthesia still. A mildly competent nurse would know to come to the patient with solutions, not problems like this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
1 day after surgery:
</strong>
My pain meds are NOT working. I can&#39;t walk hardly at all. I&#39;ve called my surgeons office 5+ times unable to speak to any human. I finally navigated the HUGE phone tree with like really long prompts in a different way and got to a human, and before I said half my question they transferred me to a dead voicemail. Now I&#39;m just trying to get meds from my PCP since I can&#39;t get them elsewhere. Absurd that I can&#39;t get a hold of the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Overall
</strong>
: hey I got my balls cut off but lord did they make me suffer for it in SO MANY unnecessary ways. The failings described above are systemic to UCSF. I will not be having another surgery at their hospitals, and will likely switch to Kaiser after this experience.
