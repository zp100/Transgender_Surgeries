I had someolthing somewhat similar after my orchi - hadnt had an E shot in 3 weeks though, but I had never been on suppressors as I didnt produce T.  I mentioned to my Dr at my appt with here 5 weeks after my orchi. She added progesterone to my mix and it seemed the hot flashes subsided after that. But it could have also been starting up my shots again?  I&#39;m totally not sure what it was or why it stopped to be honest.

I suspect your lowered dosage of E2 is at play. Early on in HRT, I was getting hot flashes at night when I was on 4mg a day, they mostly went away on 6mg.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, while getting injection dosage dialed in, I had some nighttime hot flashes near the end of a cycle.

Yes, the side effects off of spiro can be really not fun when you&#39;re getting off of it, it probably also has to do with your body getting used to your new levels of natural t.
</p>
<p>
I had some very similar things happen to me post orchiectomy. It will probably go away at the 3rd or 4th-week post-op.  I wouldn&#39;t worry.

Can you talk more about the side effects getting off spiro? What did that mean for you? Thank you! ❤️

I personally didn&#39;t really feel any side effects that I could notice from stopping spiro. I was experiencing some of the same things as you but I think it was more of my body getting to a new hormonal normal. Spiro honestly didn&#39;t really work that well for me at all. My T increased after starting hrt until I got my orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
However, I have seen a lot of other people talk about problems with getting off of it. It&#39;s very difficult for me to find specific symptoms so I&#39;m sorry about that. Getting off of any medication that you are taking at a real dosage can make you feel like shit.
