You were quite pretty before surgery, so I can only imagine how much prettier you‚Äôll be when you‚Äôve recovered!

The sleep will get better, at least the weather here in Antalya is great (I was the one who came in while you were waiting). I had my FFS the previous Wednesday and a hair transplant on Tuesday.

Hey üòä coincidences
</p>
<p>
Originally I was also going to do a hair transplant a week after the FFS. During the consult it was changed to hairline lowering.
</p>
<p>
Yes, the weather is very nice here.

Hope you liked the clinic as much as I have (my first time with any kind of non-emergency surgery, let alone Antalya). As of now I plan to come back for the hairline lowering.
</p>
<p>
My genetics didn&#39;t give me a choice on the hair transplant... Hairline was pretty bad prior to starting HRT.

I had breast enlargement a few months ago, but that was much easier to cope with. Surgery in the face feels so much more intense.
</p>
<p>
I like the clinic. They are certainly very accessible for questions, concerns etc. and take a lot of effort to give quality service.
</p>
<p>
My hairline was also pretty bad, but HRT + Minoxidil + hairhelm gave me some regrowth.

Your FFS results look great in your other posts. What is hairhelm? The Google results were non-conclusive...
