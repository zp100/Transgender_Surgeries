I had BA roughly 3 months ago, I wanted to get a Saline implant but surgeon insisted on getting a silicone one. his reasoning was &#34;they look better and lats longer&#34;
</p>
<p>
According to him, Saline lasts 10 years and Silicon 50, me being not wealthy I thought the 50 year one would be the best value. though Im not really that happy.
</p>
<p>
They are stiff and usually feel weird, and imo saline ones look better anyway. I was really looking forqard that booby bouncyness but there aint much.
</p>
<p>
Us the stiffness gonna go away? are they gonna behave similar to saline in the future?

It takes about 6 months or so for your new boobs to actually heal and &#39;fall&#39; into place at which point they will be softer. Remember you just shoved something into a space that wasn&#39;t there before.
</p>
<p>
Saline implants are prone to wrinkling under the skin. Silicone, and especially the new gummy style ones, are IMO far superior.
<br>
Most implants aren&#39;t removed/replaced because the implant fails, but because the patient wants something different (bigger/smaller) or there are tissue concerns.

I would suggest just googling them, there’s a lot of info out there.  One advantage is that they cannot leak.

I just had my Allergan cohesive gel implants replaced. Both were ruptured and one implant leaked. I ended up with a huge disaster on my hands and a silicone cyst in my breast tissue.
</p>
<p>
It was a 6 hour surgery to explant, clean out all the crap from my body reacting to them, and having it all tested before new Inspira implants reinserted.
</p>
<p>
Yes, they very much can leak --and did.
</p>
<p>

This page is still kind of rough and I&#39;m still working on it, but if you want to see exactly what I went through and why with my leaky breast implants including the MRI images - Here you Go. It&#39;s just another chapter in my 4-year surgery shit show.

The implants you had were 15+ years old and part of a recall according to your write up.
</p>
<p>
The cohesive implants made now don’t leak. You can cut them open and squeeze them and nothing happens.

Mine was exactly the same when I got them. They were top of the line and I got them for the very reason you stated. No leak danger.  I&#39;m not railing on the implants, I think they held up well overall. I had smooth, cohesive gel implants put back in from the same company.
</p>
<p>
The point, revealing all that is two fold. The implants are not lifetime devices. There are a lot of younger people in here that don&#39;t take the long-term cost of replacing them into consideration. The maintenance guidelines recommend MRI every two years. I discovered my problem during a routine mammogram. This led to a 2nd mammogram, then an ultrasound and an MRI. That&#39;s a considerable expense even if you&#39;re just paying the deductible. After that it can get very complicated very quickly.
</p>
<p>
From my research, good quality plants have max live of about 20 years. Most warranties will only cover you for 10-12 years.
</p>
<p>
The second reason I&#39;m telling this story shows how a spiteful inexperienced GRS surgeon can retaliate against you and leave you unable to access surgical care you need for unrelated problems, these are the ramifications of dismissing me from the entire division of IU-HEALTH Plastic Surgeons over issues that couldn&#39;t have, and didn&#39;t happened.  This is what &#34;Do no harm&#34;  means to Dr. Sidhbh Gallagher. You might want to consider both of my points as you move forward.

All good points to consider, most studies indicate implants don&#39;t get replaced due to age or an issue with the implant itself but because of patient requests or just the bodies natural reaction to having a foreign body in it for so long. We&#39;re at 5th gen for cohesive implants now.
</p>
<p>
The ones I&#39;m looking at have a double shell and a lifetime warranty against rupture.

I&#39;ve heard a few other bad stories about her. It seems most of her practice is on FtM patients doing top surgery with limited experience for MtF overall. I was actually going to do a consult until I started seeing some really bad reviews from before she moved to miami.

I completely agree with your assessment of why people generally have them removed. Despite that, people should be aware they require regular MRI check ups for integrity.  If you look at the MRI images you can see how the interior silicone gel had broken down. When the shell ruptured small pieces of the gel were able to escape into my breast.  It was probably at that point when my body went into overdrive, fighting the intrusion causing capsular contractures, selling and pain. Plus, you can see the free silicone right next to my lymph node.
</p>
<p>
I realize we are generations beyond when I got my first ones. The pitch then, was much the same. I don&#39;t want to discourage people for getting them. Heck, if I were negative about them, I wouldn&#39;t have replaced the old ones with Allergan&#39;s new Inspira implants. They even replaced them for free.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the implants themselves only accounted for about 7% of the total surgery cost to say nothing of the cost of consultations, pre-surgery testing, labs, travel, recovery and all the unpaid time off-work I had to take.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of people out there who still have these 410 implants. The may never be a problem, but they are recalled.

Massaging is key . I have saline and they’re softer than most silicones I’ve come across . But they didn’t really massage them

<p>
It depends on the implant and whether you have had implant previously. You don&#39;t massage textured implants in the first place.
</p>
<p>
The best thing to do to find out if massaging is key, is to ask your surgeon.

The difference in softness between month 3 and month 5 was tremendous in my recovery.

Not only do they need replaced, it&#39;s typically much more expensive AND insurance may not cover a replacement, only the removal.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll try and cover that in my MRI story, because that&#39;s an important issue I had to deal with.

No good ones. Look at Dr Bednar in North Carolina USA to get an idea of what the best looks like. Especially his Facebook group.
