I was just going to say the same thing.  bending the parts around like that is just asking to pull a stitch or separate the wound!

As far as I&#39;ve heard from my friend they were very wonderful not rude at all. And he does an awesome job I&#39;ve seen other doctors work and it&#39;s been done terribly . Maybe you spoke to the wrong team?

It looks great, Dr. Sutin did a very good job with your vulva, I have a question: What made you choose penile skin inversion with scrotal graft over other techniques?

It seemed like the best option for me. I had enough penis and scrotum to work with and didn&#39;t want to worry about my bowels or colon being affected. Not by to be mention this is the gold standard and Thailand has the best technique for doing it that I have found.

You have crossed that great divide between Pre and Post.  Your quest is now a conquest for life.  All the effort and stress of getting to POST is behind.  YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED!  You are much younger than I...I turned 76 y/o ten days ago today!  I am so sorry that I missed all the beautiful youthful years 25-55, because of my ignorance.  I&#39;ve been on HRT since 2/15/19 and I&#39;m not getting the bang for the buck because of age.  Yet I have completed the basic stuff per WPATH at my own chosen speed.  I am currently trying to get across that great divide and join you.  My two main concerns are that because I&#39;ve atrophied down there for 30 years, I will have to rely on a colon vaginoplasty to have any depth in my eventual vagina as opposed to PPT which does not inspire me.  And, I am on Medicare (not Medicade) and my surgeon options are very limited causing the need to take more risk with someone who is not yet proven.  AH, but I cry on your shoulder!  Thank you for being such a gosh awfully nice lady :-)

That is very sweet ty for saying that . I started HRT 10/27/2016 then had to stop in the latter 2018, I restarted HRT ON 4/21/2021 and did not want to wait to get to my destination, I have very well developed in a year and changed to essentially look like a completely different person. I look nothing like I started and grew 34F breast, I&#39;ve been very blessed this past year with a wonderfully supportive wife and successful Twitch stream.  Twitch.tv/Transgurl43 . That said   I understand u have insurance but if u can move ur options out of country I would strongly recommend this as the surgery here is done correctly. I did not like the results I seen from ANY American surgeon. And I&#39;ve read horror stories of the lack of care and after care post op. Yes I finally made it I&#39;m so happy I have no regrets I&#39;m day 9 post op and so so happy. This is the best year of my life. I&#39;m back on my hormones and gonna take a bit to feel like me to again. But we are getting there. I finally go home in 7 days I&#39;m excited. Ready for my own home .
