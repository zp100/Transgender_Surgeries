I&#39;m looking at getting ffs and going with Dr Bensimon would be the easiest and almost the only possible option. I looked online and the information I could find but there is not a lot and I&#39;m still hesitant, this is a big move for me and I would like to hear about others experience or practical advises. Feel free to DM or post here. Thanks in advance!

hi! i haven’t gone to bensimon personally but i know 2 people irl that went to him. they both look very cute and also pass pretty well!
</p>
<p>
my understanding is if you want someone that does really aggressive work, US surgeons are better option. but bensimon is a good option overall, especially if you’re looking for conservative-ish work! feel free to dm me if u have any questions :)

The guy has been in practice for like 20 years. The reason there is not a lot is that he is terrible and no one wants to show their face. Just that should be enough to convince anyone from going to him. I do not know a single girl who is satisfied with. All of them came back with the exact same face minus the money.  And the one that claim he does good work are the friend of a friend who has a cat that plays with a dog at the park and the cousin’s sister of the owner of store where the owner of the dog goes to get coffee has heard that Bensimon does a good job.
</p>
<p>
But plz don’t trust me. Do you own research. And convenient should not be main factor. As your face of its damage. Will result in a lot worse.
</p>
<p>
My two cents.

Omg just no. Talk about a bad surgeon. People still have issues fixing the damage he does years after. Run as far as possible as you can from him.

Not true I went to him and I’m super satisfied  There a few people here who are just trying to undermine him He’s been in practice for a long time and doesn’t advertise  I would suggest you to consult him and make your own opinion
