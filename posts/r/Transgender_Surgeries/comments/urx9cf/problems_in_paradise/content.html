I had srs about a year ago (11 months) and recently I&#39;ve been having a lot of UTI&#39;s. Any tips on what I can be doing to prevent them? IDK if it is different from the preventative care a cis woman would do which is why I came here.
</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance for the help!  üíôüíóü§çüíóüíô

1.) Be sure to clean the outside of your vagina every day with mild soap and water.  Clean thoroughly between the folds of your labia too.  Cleanliness is very important.
</p>
<p>
2.) Take a cranberry supplement. Studies have shown that cranberry juices have an ingredient that helps prevents bacteria from attaching to the inner lining of your bladder.  Since it&#39;s not realistic to drink a ton of glasses of cranberry juice every day, take a cranberry pill.  I use these
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cranberry-Urinary-Dietary-Supplement-Softgels/dp/B004RR1FF6">AZO cranberry pills from Amazon
</a>
.  One pill at breakfast, and one pill at dinner.

Why!!! No no no soap!  Just water!   Had my surgery 2 years ago. Take a probiotic every day and.  Drink a lot so you have to pee a lot to keep the bad bacteria away! And ALWAYS always  wipe front to back

To be clear, the cranberry pills help to
<em>
prevent
</em>
a UTI from occurring in the first place.  You need to take them literally every day.  That is a bit of a hassle, but it&#39;s way better than actually getting a UTI (as I&#39;m sure you know by now!)
</p>
<p>
Once you suspect you actually have a UTI, the cranberry pills won&#39;t help you.  At that point you need to go to the doctor and get on antibiotics to fight the infection.

These are some of the things you could consider trying, although they are not guaranteed to work:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Wipe front to back, always. No exceptions.
</li>
<li>
As someone else mentioned, taking cranberry supplements can help fight infections before they happen.
</li>
<li>
Make sure you clean your nails, especially if you masturbate. Continuing along these lines, make sure that if you have a partner that they follow good hygiene when getting near your vulva.
</li>
<li>
Use an intimate wash in the shower, and not some generic soap. Generic soap throws off the pH balance of the area.
</li>
<li>
Consider vaginal probiotics.
</li>
<li>
Avoid synthetic fabrics for underwear, wear cotton, and change your underwear if it&#39;s damp/wet (ie. after sports). Along the same lines, sleeping naked can also help preventing bacterial buildup.
</li>
<li>
Make sure you clean your dilators properly after use.
</li>
</ol>

Internal hair can cause it, and I‚Äôd guess granulation might as well.
</p>
<p>
Also, try looking in
