Hello ! I am very happy with the result and I want to share it with you. I took pictures during my recovery until now for the interested ones.
</p>
<p>
I had some granulation that ended up going away about 1 month and a half ago.
</p>
<p>
I have a loss of depth probably because of that (14 cm post op, 9-10 cm today). I’m not planning a revision surgery at this level yet, but I could consider it if it’s too much of an issue.
</p>
<p>
Apart from that I am very happy, everything is operational! I’m happy:-)
</p>

Congrats on your results! Happy to see more from dr Claes! I had my surgery with him 2 months ago but I definitely find it similar to yours!

What a beautiful result! If I can ask—did your granulation last for those whole first 9 months? Did you get silver nitrate treatments, and if so, how many did it take?

Hello ! Thank you ! :-)
</p>
<p>
Yes no worries, I am very happy to answer questions! It lasted about 8 months I would say, I received 3 treatments with silver nitrate, as well as a diprosone treatment (cortisone) that I applied with the dilator before sleeping. The nitrate treatments were carried out by Dr. Claes himself.
</p>
<p>
Nothing really painful, it was burning especially the first day, and I had a lot of blood loss and pieces of granulation. I have photos too even if it is not very nice to see.
</p>
<p>
As time went by, I had less and less blood. This was perhaps the most annoying part in the end, because the granulation took a lot of space.

Thank you for sharing. I had my own surgery about 8 months ago and have been dealing with granulation tissue as well, I am on my sixth(?) treatment of silver nitrate and it seems to be having diminishing returns which has been causing me a lot of stress. The medical assistant I have been seeing at my clinic told me it should not be taking this long which really worried me. It is heartening to know other girls have dealt with the same thing for the same length of time. I will definitely ask about cortisone during my next appointment.
</p>
<p>
I really appreciate you sharing your experience!! Thank you and congratulations again!

Thank you very much! And it’s always good to share your experiences. At one point, my surgeon had talked to me about correcting this with surgery but he wanted to use it as a last resort. Maybe you should tell her?
</p>
<p>
I don’t know how much the diprosone had an impact, but it worked.
</p>
<p>
My granulation was mainly on the bottom of the vagina.
</p>
<p>
Courage, the best comes:-)

Thank you ! I advise to trust the time, it is a surgery that takes time. :-)
