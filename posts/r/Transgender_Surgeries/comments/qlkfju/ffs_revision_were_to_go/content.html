Your jaw appears to be significantly recessed, which greatly affects the nose.  You may be a candidate for orthognathic surgery (or DJS).  It would be wise to consult with an orthognathic surgeon, particularly one with an expertise in aesthetics, prior to another round of feminization surgery or rhinoplasty.

Oof yeah dr spiegal is becoming quite the butcher recently, or it’s because it’s been reported that he lets his students practice on patients.
</p>
<p>
I’d try Toby Mayer, he does great revision work. I also like jumaily’s nose work.

You need to go to a rhinoplasty expert for a rhinoplasty revision. FFS surgeons are not skilled enough to do revision rhinoplasty no matter what they claim.

how long ago was the surgery?
</p>
<p>
i think i need a hairline adjustment and the scar is something i’m worried about personally. have you considered FUE hair transplants to hide it? from what i’ve read and seen this works but you need some time after FFS for things to heal before doing this.
</p>
<p>
i’ve seen
<a href="/u/HiddenStill" rel="nofollow">/u/HiddenStill
</a>
write about coronal v. hairline incision. do you know which one you got? which did you choose, or did your surgeon choose?
</p>
<p>
where do you think you’ll go for rhinoplasty revision? i wish i could have like the best nose surgeon work
<em>
with
</em>
my FFS surgeon i feel like it’s so rare where that one surgeon is great at both things. ugh.
</p>
<p>
i’m sorry you’re not satisfied with your FFS :(
</p>
<p>
thanks for sharing everything and i hope everything gets better soon

did you see Nikita Dragun FUE hair transplant video? if not watch it and maybe it can give you some hope. or give an idea of maybe reaching out to someone now to see if they can talk to you about it. i don’t think the procedure is
<em>
that
</em>
expensive and could definitely be worth it.

I think Jumaily has another clinic I guess in Toronto that does pretty much all revision rynoplasty.
</p>
<p>
I just had ffs with him 4 weeks ago and my nose still looks really good.
