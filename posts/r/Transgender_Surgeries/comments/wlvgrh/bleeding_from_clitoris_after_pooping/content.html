Hi, i&#39;m a bit over 3 months post-op and have had bleeding from what seems like my clitoris after i poop in the morning (or just if i&#39;m pushing my pee out very hard). I can&#39;t contact my doctor because of vacation, but is this something i should be worried about? I generally can&#39;t feel the bleeding that much, but i feel like it hurts a little bit, idk.
</p>
<p>
It only happens once every week or so, but it has only ever been a tiny bit of blood on the paper after i wipe. However today i actually started bleeding properly and it hasn&#39;t stopped after around 20 minutes. Any suggestions?
</p>

Sorry to hear you&#39;re going though this dear. Constant bleeding for 20 minutes 3 months postop.. Immediately go to the ER!
</p>
<p>
Sounds like severe granulation or wound dihescence. Get an opinion from a doctor!

Even if its just a little bit of blood and it doesnt hurt? i guess i was a little excessive in the post, it wasnt a constant flow or anything, just spotting on the gauze i used to put pressure on it

it has been happening the entire 3 months, but it&#39;s usually just some blood in the discharge. I haven&#39;t been able to reach my doctor, but will try again in the morning i guess. I dont *think* im gonna go to the ER, since i think i can see the little scratch where the blood is coming from, and it stopped bleeding after i lied down for a while
