Holy shit! We&#39;re twins!
</p>
<p>
I also got mine with Brassard 5 weeks ago. We probably stayed at the Asclepiade together (tho I probably don&#39;t know you cause I talked to nobody lol). My result looks very similar to yours! I&#39;d say my labias goes a bit further up but your two big scars seem to be healing better than mine
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy with the result! I&#39;m happy with mine too. Like, it&#39;s not the best of all time, but it&#39;s more than I ever wanted. When I take my bath, I like to slide my hand down my body all the way to my crotch, and I get a huge wave of euphoria when I sense I no longer have a dick ðŸ¥°
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have a super high libido, but even I can&#39;t wait to use it. Like, my clit feels a bit sensitive when I touch it, but more the annoying kind of sensitive ðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
Good luck girl, I hope you continue healing well and don&#39;t be scared to ask me about my experience!

Heyyy! It&#39;s great to find other people who went to the same place (and same time as well!). I was staying in room 207 in asclÃ©piade, so idk if saw you during my time there. (If you heard the name Lily at some point during your stay, that was me)
</p>
<p>
And I agree, not feeling a dick down there is the best feeling ever, I just hope I can start touching my clit easier soon enough and slowly try to have a bit of fun with it &lt;3
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

As someone who might have to go with Dr. Brassard Iâ€™d love it if you could share your experience here. How do you feel about everything? Are you happy so far with your results?

Honestly everything has been going fine so far, my time at the GRS center and care home went pretty well, the nurses were very kind and friendly. I  had complications on my first night (I was bleeding a lot and had to go back into a small surgery to fix it), but other than that, everything went just fine. I had more swelling than some of the girls who got the surgery at the same time as me, but so far it&#39;s gone down a lot.
</p>
<p>
I barely have any discharges 5 weeks in and I&#39;m super eager for them to stop, no bad smell or anything.
</p>
<p>
I found Brassard to be very kind, we spent a bunch of time talking about the surgery, asking him questions about my recovery and everything.
</p>
<p>
Frankly all I&#39;m really annoyed about is the fact that I can&#39;t do anything right now when I get all horny ahah (I tend to be a very sexual girl), so getting aroused and being unable to touch is a bit annoying ahah, but that&#39;ll come in due time &lt;3
</p>
<p>
If you have any other questions, I&#39;d be happy to answer them.

On average, I tend to reach the second to last dot on the dilators. I think that&#39;s approximately 5-5.5 inches deep?

As someone who had dr brassad preform my Vaginoplasty in January I couldn&#39;t be happier. As someone who had not a ton of expectations of what my life would be life with a vagina, I just last night had a very lovely date that ended with me being gone down on and apparently I&#39;m Able to produce my own lube??
</p>
<p>
Tldr Dr Brassard made my pussy tasty

Well let&#39;s see how it kep healing over the next months. I don&#39;t expect it to look like a masterpiece in only 5 weeks.
</p>
<p>
I do have a clitoris etc, I still have stitches in holding stuff.  Let&#39;s not be hasty about things. (also the picture is taken at an angle)
</p>
<p>
Honestly even now I&#39;m happy with how it&#39;s turning out. Whatever it ends up looking like, it&#39;s much better than my old dick, and that&#39;s what matters to me.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Also, my expectations when it came to the surgery were simple: is it a functional vagina? yeah. Will it eventually allow me to orgasm and have fun the &#39;&#39;normal&#39;&#39; way? most likely.  Wether it looks like a cis woman&#39;s or not doesn&#39;t bother me because who&#39;s gonna look at it besides me and and girlfriends (who are all trans as well)? I&#39;m not into men and I&#39;m not showing off my pussy to just anyone who wants to see. Heck I was considering no-depth at some point, but decided against it because I ended up thinking I&#39;d really want my fingers/toys, etc up in it. So does it &#39;&#39;look&#39;&#39; and function like a vagina? Yep. Is  the dick bulge gone? Yep. Works for me.

I am 7 months and I would say at 5 weeks our results are pretty similar. I popped a stitch on one side which oddly enough I am happy about. No, cisvagina I have been around is perfectly symmetrical so to have some unique differences is actually a good thing at least in my opinion. I do have a bit of scarring at the bottom which is not uncommon. I may need some revision work there but really I see that as my body responding the way it did versus an error on his part.
</p>
<p>
As for depth, I get to the first dot consistently. I do one thing differently than the book. I find at least once every week I will actually start from the smallest dilator and work up to the orange dilator. So I will use all three dilators during that particular session. When I don&#39;t do that I notice that it wants to reduce in depth a cm or so. This has only been an issue since going to once a day sessions.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, I am so happy for you. Feels great to be ourselves. ðŸ™‚
