I am having facial feminization surgery, breast augmentation, and a labia revision with Dr. Del Corral on September 22 (Wednesday). I had a peritoneal pull through vaginoplasty with him in April. We were able to test out some newer 3d modeling software to project some of the changes.

I thought you were might be interested to see what these projections look like. The first image is a sort of before and after projection of what my face might sort of look like. The difference here is going to be that this production cannot accommodate for forehead advancement, blepharoplasty, or cartilage changes like in an open rhinoplasty.
</p>
<p>
The CT Scan images you see there show how much material is to be removed and where to help feminize the shape of my skull.  You can also see how much of my mandible is to be removed and where.
</p>
<p>
The uncolored section in the center of the brow ridge is actually going to be surgically removed and ground down at another table while other work is being done.  Then it will be affixed back into my skull with screws.
</p>
<p>
There are no projections for my labia revision.  I wanna stress about the revision that I have been *very* happy with the work, and Dr. Del Corral seemed very keen to make sure everything was up to *his* standards.  I can&#39;t complain.  The peritoneal pull through has been a WILD healing experience, but I love the results so far even though I&#39;m not fully healed.  I have been able to achieve orgasm and have *light* and *gentle* forms of penetrative sexual intercourse with partners.
</p>
<p>
(please don&#39;t mind my skull as I have a fairly unique form of cleft palate that has really messed with my facial structure so the result is that a lot of stuff is twisted and changed in ways it won&#39;t be in your skulls. )

The 3D imaging stuff is cool. It would be great to see how the results compare.
</p>
<p>
I know I&#39;ve said this before. You can do all the underlying 3d surgical planning and segmentation with 3D-slicer and the surgical planning plugin. They have plugins for everything including one for mandible segmentation. Sure, there&#39;s a learning curve but having your own CT-Scan images is awesome when you know what how to process them. The underlying bone structure is just one layer of the imaging. There is a lot more to see.

Hi evey! Thank you for sharing all the new technology Dr. Corral’s using, it’s incredible to see how fast stuff like this evolves.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure you get this question a lot, but how was your PPT recovery? Do you have to dilate, and if so, is it tough? I consulted with Dr. Corral and he said dilation wasn’t necessary with PPT but I’m not sure about that.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your time and good luck with your future procedures!

So, I would expect that you may or may not have to dilate based on the exact circumstances of YOUR surgery. The dilation is not necessarily required for the peritoneum. The dilation is actually more about the opening cavity. It’s definitely less required, and I was able to move down in my dilation sessions pretty quickly. That said though, I do have to dilate. I dilate twice a day currently.
</p>
<p>
And I sort of feel fine with that. That said, Dr. Del Corral is not going to have you do treatments or therapies for yourself that aren’t necessary for you and your body, I don’t think dilation would represent a setback for you. He will have you do them for treatments that are necessary for you and your body. I think he’s learning all the time. For instance, one of the things that has changed in my treatment is I really don&#39;t have to douche. Almost ever.
</p>
<p>
The peritoneal tissue will not want to close up the way that a penile inversion would, but the opening still probably would? So I’d say SOME dilation would still be needed/prescribed.  I can’t speak for him or over him though.
</p>
<p>
So, what I can say is I have had nothing but the best experience with him and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to recommend him. As for how the recovery was with a peritoneal pull through, it was exceptionally painful but there are other reasons it was likely painful for me. One of those reasons is that I have an auto immune disorder, so swelling for me is a big deal because I swell up really easily and a lot.
</p>
<p>
It’s a
<em>
very
</em>
invasive surgery and it’s hard to say how things will go.  The truth is if I hadn’t recorded exactly how much pain I was in, I would be telling you it was fine.  It wasn’t fine.  I was in EXTRAVAGANT amounts of pain, and he managed my pain
<em>
really
</em>
well.

Hey girl! Your result is so amazing! Congratulations!  I had PPT with him as well. Today is actually my 6 months. I’ve experienced a lot of dryness and weird smelly discharge. Did you have similar experience?

Well you&#39;re still healing so discharge and stuff isn&#39;t unexpected.  The PPT variant of the vaginoplasty also does come with peritoneal fluid and that is gonna change from person to person.  Another thing might be whatever lubricant you&#39;re using for dilation: when I switched to a more ph friendly aloe based lubricant I noticed a lot of difference in odor and strength of that odor.

But as ALWAYS if you have concerns *please* talk to him. He wants you to have a good outcome.

Not really, I mean in the respect that I still need lubricant I guess but there&#39;s plenty of moisture.

Thank you for sharing your journey through FFS with Dr. Del Corral; I had a consultation with him earlier this week and I am waiting for the date of my FFS to be confirmed.
