I found out today that what I thought was just leftover lube trickling/squirting out when I use the bathroom after dilating is probably urine from a hole in my bladder inside my vagina. The surgeon says it&#39;s not urgent and it might heal by our next post-op appointment in two months (and if not, we can fix it surgically), but meanwhile it has me feeling very unsettled and fragile.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone else experienced this? What did recovery look like for you?
</p>
<p>
It feels like a step backwards right now.

I also know she had to go closer to my bladder for some reason (that I don&#39;t know enough anatomy to understand) during surgery, so that may be related. She had me use the catheter for an extra week for that reason.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the suggestion about lots of water, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s good advice regardless.
</p>
<p>
I have a gynecologist appointment in a couple weeks anyway so I&#39;ll see if he has anything to add.

It won&#39;t be bladder it&#39;ll be your urethra that&#39;s the tube that goes from your bladder to the outside.

The surgeon says there was an area of the bladder that had to be dissected to get to the vagina and it might be from there, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s simplified or what.

I hope  everything goes better for you. But I really can&#39;t believe that the guy who said that &#34;women pee through their vagina &#34; was right.

Fortunately mine isn&#39;t that bad, only a little comes out. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got a plan to get yours fixed!

For real, I&#39;m really glad my surgeon went closer to the bladder than the colon when she had to make a choice while I was under!

Hey you, I am sorry for you. Struggled also with the urethrovaginal fistula due to necrosis of my maetus. That unfortunetly led to to some wild flesh growth that kind of blocked it and I had some serious urinary retention, what even caused me to call the emergency unit of my local hospital.
</p>
<p>
Eventually my surgeon was able to split the fistula and now my maetus is located where the fistula has been. I am still healing and suffer some soreness and burning sensation in my urethra.
</p>
<p>
I think urinary complications are very common, as the urogenital area is very delicate and little imperfections could lead to quite painfull issues.
</p>
<p>
I am sure your surgeon will find a way to get it healed! Wish you the best!
