<em>
(see post history for previous entries about this surgery)
</em>
</p>
<p>
This post covers week 3 post-op, where I get out of dangerous-complication territory, get off the rest of my meds, and head back home.
</p>
<p>
A disclaimer about my experience post-op: in addition to a very high pain tolerance, I&#39;ve been recovering
<em>
much
</em>
faster than expected for my surgery. Don&#39;t expect/assume that your recovery would be the same.
</p>
<p>
Also...there&#39;s advice out there saying &#34;don&#39;t care what you eat, just eat what&#39;s yummy/comfortable, blah blah blah&#34;. That&#39;s objectively shite advice and I&#39;d strongly advise against that. There&#39;s never been a more important time to eat well than when you&#39;re recovering from major surgery. Your health &amp; microbiome are completely fucked post-op and need to be cultivated from the ground up. I can&#39;t believe people don&#39;t make this a top priority.
</p>
<h1>
2nd Post-Op Appointment
</h1>
<p>
The first post-op checkup (1 week after surgery), I had the packing taken out. The 2nd checkup (a week after the packing was out) she inspected everything to make sure the graft was secure, bloodflow was returning, no wound separation, and new skin growing. She also pulled some stitches that were poking out, removed bits of dead skin, and snipped some built-up protein gunk.
</p>
<h1>
Week 3 Recovery Notes
</h1>
<p>
Not sure what people want to know, but here&#39;s some highlights:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
My activity level went way up after the 2nd checkup. I had been cooking and such since the day after my packing came out, but I then started cleaning, baking, and moving more freely. Still spent most of the day in bed though. I probably spent ~3-4 hours a day out of bed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Figured out pads finally! The normal daily pads (size 1 &amp; 2, lightest absorbancy) work fine but are a bit bulky obviously. I&#39;m trying panty liners now and they seem to work but I&#39;ll have a concrete verdict next week. They might not absorb enough.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
No post-op blues yet. Apparently it sets in at ~2-3months.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There was
<em>
alot
</em>
of new, pink skin growth and dead skin/protein shedding. The discharge is gross. Think &#34;nightmare loogies&#34;.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Dilation
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Dilation actually got a bit harder before it got easier. I think it was the higher activity level increasing the swelling for the first few days, stopping all medicine, and feeling returning.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
By now dilation is pretty painless after it gets in. I&#39;ll probably start sizing up to the blue one tomorrow. I can already see how vaginal stimulation will be nice since it goes through the penile nerves/muscles.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve lost a small bit of depth, or it&#39;s just the swelling pulling the skin away from the dilator. It&#39;s a small enough difference that it&#39;s not worth worrying about now anyways.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Peritoneal Graft stuff
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Discharge seems to be increasing, not lessening. The peritoneal tissue is coming back online I think.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The surgeon said that the lining is more fragile than scrotal/penile tissue, but she (and thusly, I) haven&#39;t been worried about it. There&#39;s a fair amount of flex and I can feel the end when I push a little with the dilator in all the way. If I push enough, there&#39;s a bit of discomfort letting me know to stop. TBH she was more rough with it in the check-ups than I am dilating.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
My 5 abdominal incisions (~1cm each) are more-or-less forgotten. They&#39;ll make some wicked scars but don&#39;t bother me unless I stretch alot.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I still can&#39;t comfortably lay on my stomach. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s because the graft was very large and the peritoneum hasn&#39;t healed completely. I can feel weird pressure down there when I try, telling me to stop.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
3rd Post-Op Appointment
</h1>
<p>
At the end of week 3 (and the day before I left!) I had my third post-op appointment. She checked more vigorously the sturdiness of the graph (lol) and used silver nitrate to induce scabbing to promote healing. Apparently some 2-3month stitches were already poking out and she snipped some of those...and I can already feel more sitches poking -_- .
</p>
<p>
She also cleared me to play with my penis! Yay. I still can&#39;t do anything with the other stuff down there until the 3-month mark.
</p>
<h1>
Travelling Back Home
</h1>
<p>
Phew, yesterday was exhausting. Packing, carrying stuff, car rides, flying - a huge jump in activity level. The donut cushion saved me. No complications though! If anything, the activity helped get more gross discharge out.
</p>
<p>
Last night I went out with my father for food for a couple hours, and today I walked to the grocery store, shopped, and walked back. 100% fine. I&#39;m basically back to &#34;normal life&#34; except not working, not exercising, dilating 3x, and reclining on my couch instead of chair-sitting.
</p>
<h4>
Phase 2 of GCS
</h4>
<p>
The labiaplasty will probably happen at ~6months post-op. At my 3-month checkup we&#39;ll decide. I&#39;m personally fine with waiting longer for lower swelling if it means the results will be better but she seems optimistic.
</p>
<p>
I can start hair removal again at 3 months. Since it&#39;s all external I don&#39;t need to wait for hair removal, but
<em>
ew
</em>
hairy labia. I&#39;ll probably start electrolysis then to get those small light hairs.
</p>
<p>
Until then I&#39;ll be collating information on what I want done, I guess.

I&#39;m happy for you and will be following your progress. I want to get the same procedure down the road so will be seeing how it turns out for you.

Strangely I didn&#39;t get any of this, but I do hear it is fairly standard to experience after vaginoplasty. We aren&#39;t quite sure why, maybe I&#39;m just a really quick healer, but the entirety of my skin graft took and I didn&#39;t experience any of the dead skin shedding, only thin liquid stuff.

A thing you will notice over time as your swelling goes down over the coming months is it will look like the dilator isn&#39;t going inside as deep. Really it should be going to the same depth but your outside bits are less swollen so more of the dilator is visible outside of you.

Huh! I guess between two different people, two different surgeons, and two different graft types, it&#39;s hard to compare this stuff.

<p>
Ah! That could explain why sometimes it seems to go deeper than other times. Good to know thanks!

Can you give us a ballpark figure for what the total cost of this procedure with Dr. Witttenberg runs (including hospital &amp; anesthesiologist, but not travel or hotel costs)? I’m probably going to go with good old penile inversion vaginoplasty with Dr. McGinn, but I know someone in Vegas who’s kinda famous in the adult video industry who’s consulting with Dr. Wittenberg for this very surgery and have another friend local who’s very interested in it too. If I were much younger, I’d be really interested in it for myself, but at 57, and 49 years of dreaming for the big day, I’ll be happy with forfeiting the south pole for a vag.

It was covered by insurance (in-network) so I didn&#39;t get a quote, sorry. I heard that someone else getting the same-ish surgery was quoted ~$100,000. Looking in my insurance records, I think this is the right ballpark (but I honestly don&#39;t understand insurance billing well anyways). Note that this is only stage 1, without labiaplasty.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s alot more than the Thai surgeons unfortunately :(. Being in probably the most expensive city in the world doesn&#39;t help anything. I know the Mt. Sinai group in NYC is doing peritoneal and is probably more affordable, but I don&#39;t know if they do penile-preservation stuff. Some other people on here have had penile-preservation GCS through different surgeons with different techniques.

Ouch! That’s a lot of money. I doubt my local friend will ever be able to save up that much money. The other one in Vegas will, but even with her income it’ll be a sizeable hurdle to overcome. In contrast, my standard GRS will be a 1/4 of that. Earlier this summer I got a cash price quote from another tier 1 surgeon whose price for normal penile inversion vaginoplasty was raised from ~$40k to $125k and they still have a 2 year wait list. Capitalism is the price is whatever the market will bear, eh?

Keep in mind that if you aren&#39;t in network the &#34;cash price&#34; for surgery is often significantly lower than the price billed to insurance. $100k can turn into $30-40k. I&#39;m also in network with Dr Wittenberg and didn&#39;t ask about the cash price.

I specifically informed the NYU surgical office that I had no insurance and wanted the price for cash up front and they said, doesn’t matter whether insurance is paying any or all, or if I was paying cash up front. The price for GRS with Dr. Bluebond-Langner is now the same, starting at approximately $125k, that includes anesthesiologist, routine labwork, hospital fees and the surgeon’s fees. The preliminary consultation and physical exams would be around $480 in addition since both the surgeon and a separate urologist doctor would be examining any prospective GRS patients in a two-part physical exam. Even at that high price, that’s one surgeon that’s booked so far into the future they don’t offer any cash up front discounts, it’s all the same cost no matter who pays.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Wittenberg may be doing the same if she’s got an endless supply of patients lined up wanting this surgery
