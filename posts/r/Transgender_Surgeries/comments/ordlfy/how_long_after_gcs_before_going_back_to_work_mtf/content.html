Where I went (GRS MontrÃ©al) they said 8 weeks minimum, and 12 weeks ideally, before returning to work. This considers the intense dilating schedule for the first three months as well as  healing time and such.
</p>
<p>
With that said, I went back to work at my office job after 7 weeks. I would have felt it almost impossible to go back much sooner, but things got much better between 4-7 weeks. Sitting for long periods was still a challenge even with working with a laptop from the comfy chairs at my work.
</p>
<p>
I would also note: my coworkers knew what surgery I had gone for, so. I didn&#39;t have to hide anything. I had had to, it would have been extremely difficult.

IMO, when you can return to work varies by how well you recover, what your work is, and where your work is. I was mentally able to fully return to work at 1.5-2 months, but physically? If I couldnâ€™t work from home I still would not have returned to work and Iâ€™m a week out from 3 months.

Thanks! Like I said, it varies. Keep in touch with your surgeon and pay attention to how activity makes you feel. Youâ€™re the best person to judge how you feel.

8 weeks.  Dilating 4 times a day is just not compatible with doing anything else...

Iâ€™m a software engineer, so my answer is assuming you wonâ€™t need to physically exert yourself much. That said, I could have made 4 weeks work. It would have been a bit uncomfortable, but manageable. 6 weeks would have been easier, since I moved from dilating 4/day to 3/day then, plus I was comfortable enough to walk long distances and sit without the doughnut pillow. I personally took 9 weeks off. I think I had a pretty easy recovery. Iâ€™ve been back at work for two weeks now, and itâ€™s definitely not too soon. Iâ€™d recommend giving yourself more time than you think you need and Iâ€™m sure you could call your employer and ask to come back sooner.

IF your company offers FMLA or MLA, and they offer a maximum of 12 weeks, request that your surgeon use this when filling out the medical certification form. If your company also offers short-term disability, and you&#39;re eligible, utilize this as well. This will give you the best opportunity at recovering and dilating into your required to only do so 2x/day or less while still generating some income.

I was away from work for 12-weeks. I had some necrosis and severe granulation which slowed my recovery by a couple of weeks.
