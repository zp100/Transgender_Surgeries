The swelling is still pretty bad on the chin, and to a lesser extent the jaw and where I had my buccal fat pads removed.
</p>
<p>
Bruising under the eyes is almost gone and most of the scabbing in the hair transplant area is gone too.
</p>
<p>
Beard shadow is definitely an issue but it’s been 5 weeks since I had electrolysis last. I haven’t really tried to see how it is with makeup on yet...really should give that a try,

Overall, how satisfied are you with the process? With the results?  What do you wish you had done differently and what do you wish they had done differently?

I&#39;m thrilled with the results so far.
</p>
<p>
It may have been a bit of expectation management, but I&#39;d prepared for practically no change for 3-6 months. That still probably will be the case because of the hair transplant, but the fact of the matter is I&#39;ve been gendered correctly as long as I don&#39;t speak, even if I don&#39;t really feel like I see a woman in the mirror yet.
</p>
<p>
But even that being said, I also don&#39;t feel dysphoric when I look in the mirror...and I have yet to actually try any enhancements with makeup or wigs (my hair really is still too thin/short still).
</p>
<p>
Thinks I wish I&#39;d done differently...I&#39;m a little concerned about complications with the upper blephoroplasty, but I need to wait for a few more months to really judge that. I didn&#39;t care for the way my eyes looked before, but my left eye still feels pretty tight.
</p>
<p>
I also wish that perhaps I&#39;d had them do more to reduce my cleft chin. I didn&#39;t want it eliminated but it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s reduced much except for the bottom.  That said, there&#39;s still a lot of swelling, and the skin and fat need to adjust to the new chin and that takes time.
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;m thrilled with my forehead, and I think I&#39;ll be really happy with my hair once the transplants grow in.
</p>
<p>
I also had a breast augmentation and I&#39;m really happy with them so far. They feel totally normal to me, at least with the bra on. They feel a bit...delicate when I have it off. They&#39;re pretty big, so without the support they do feel quite heavy (I mean...1.5 pounds each).
</p>
<p>
I think I&#39;d be happier if they were even bigger, but that wasn&#39;t in the cards, and arguably wouldn&#39;t be safe, and dealing with the additional weight probably wouldn&#39;t be good.

Excellent feedback.  I think you already look great and I&#39;m very excited to see your progress and Dr Rossi in a few months :)

Thanks. Remember that FFS takes 6mo or longer to pan out to the desired result, OP is doing everyone a huge favor by showing the intermediate steps which almost nobody does! It&#39;s really useful to see, &#34;This is what to expect at day 1, week 1, month 1&#34;, etc etc
