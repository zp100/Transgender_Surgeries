The nightmare (EXTREMELY GRAPHIC, NSFW):

Ask me anything! Now that I&#39;m out of the traumatizing experience I went through, healed up and happy I wanted to share my results. This is how it should have been 5 months ago. My fiancee is very pleased with the aesthetic, and I am too. I do not need to tuck for pretty much all outfits, and if I do need to it&#39;s just for a few cute panties or very tight leggings. Even then, it is pain-free, comfortable, and easy. I&#39;m trying to think of it downside and I can&#39;t really think of anything except for the fact that the new fold in my skin gave me some annoying ingrown hairs along the scar, however plucking them religiously is slowly causing them to stay away and alleviate the problem.
</p>
<p>
I look back at the nightmare post and cringe. in retrospect I wish I had sued someone for negligence, but in all honesty once I knew I was in the clear I just wanted to be completely separated from the people that put me through the horror. at the end of the day I will say it was all worth it and I would do it again to reach this place I am at now.
</p>
<p>
My dysphoria has been eliminated completely. I am back to being myself. I go to the nude beach almost weekly and feel extremely confident. I often feel hot. Now that this is out of the way, I feel like nothing could stop me from achieving my goals. As of last week I hit 2 years on hormones as a cherry on top.
</p>
<p>
And to add a fun additional comment, I am currently recovering from a breast augmentation and think I&#39;m going to be extremely pleased with that as well. It&#39;s only been a few days post-op and I haven&#39;t even gotten to see the twins yet. I got a minor lift to fix some asymmetry and so far I only have more sensitivity. :). Really looking forward to next summer...
</p>
<p>
Cheers everyone, I could cry right now. This was a really long road.

I could not be happier sis ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ You look stunning. But it makes me mad still is that they did not prescribe you antibiotics!! Any surgery needs it, compulsorily! I had my surgery (VP) and I was in antibiotics for 3 weeks and the day before!! (The catheterism also requires one as long at it is in).
</p>
<p>
Off topic: Did the piercing hurt? I was thinking about one in my nipple tho ü§óü§óü§ó

Wow, that previous post of yours was truly horrifying, but it looks

AMAZING
</em>
now. Idk what my plans for bottom surgery are exactly yet but if I decided to keep what I have down there this would be such a fantastic result.
</p>
<p>
I hadn&#39;t really considered this as an option until now. I&#39;m sorry it was so shitty but I&#39;m so so happy for you that it turned out so well in the end!!

It really was a nightmare situation that could have been avoided if they had just listened to me. In general scrotectomies are extremely simple and orchiectomies are downright outpatient.

Honestly it‚Äôs amazing the work they did to fix this!! Also, with your breast augmentation, I‚Äôm curious to see what cup size you are now, especially given your other recent post about the Karen in the parking lot

Natural healing means they didn&#39;t do anything. My body was left to close the wound without assistance and they watched.

Oh my God im so glad for you. I didn&#39;t comment on your other post because I was in shock and what could I say! Also we are strangers. But the relief I feel for you right now is great.
