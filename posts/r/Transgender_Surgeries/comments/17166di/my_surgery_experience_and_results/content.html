I would like to also follow up by saying, when I had to stay down there longer than I planned the align surgical team helped me get into a place, a 24-hour nursing facility and also offered me help getting home because my low budget, when you&#39;re going through something as stressful as this surgery, you want a good team to take care of you.
</p>
<p>
And on that note whoever you bring is your caregiver I recommend bringing somebody that gives you a smile because it will help so much more than you can think.

Congratulations!

I also had both bottom surgery and FFS with Align, although with Dr. Gurjala. I had a wonderful experience and highly recommend them.

It&#39;s worth the extra money to travel to them, how&#39;s your recovery going?

I&#39;m 3 years post op, so I&#39;m completely healed. I had a small revision in 2022. Did you go to 8th Element?
