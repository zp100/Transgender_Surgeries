I&#39;m currently scheduled with Suporn Clinic but I am re-thinking going with them and going with Dr. Thee and the Sigmoid Colon Vaginoplasty instead. I hear it&#39;s a faster recovery, dilation is easier and overall many people are happier.
</p>
<p>
I will be going to thailand alone myself so I definitely will be needing a care team.
</p>
<p>
Just curious, does Siam Transformative help with finding lodging to stay in while in Thailand? I need to know so that I can get help with all the things I need while there.

Yeah Dr Suporn is notorious for very long recoveries with intense dilations i was going to go to him but i found dr Thee fortunately.
</p>
<p>
The ladies from Siam Transformative helped me with finding accomodation and basically everything i needed help with they are amazing i can&#39;t recommend them enough i actually miss them.

I already did. But they are waiting to hear back from Dr. Thee and his team about surgery for me. I gave them all the medical background history and stuff they required. Once I hear back I need to make a decision, either Suporn Clinic or Dr. Thee. If I do cancel with Suporn I need to figure out how long it will take to do hair removal on all 3 places they want hair removed.
</p>
<p>
With Suporn it was just one area. With Thee it&#39;s the shaft, scrotum and perineum area.
</p>
<p>
But I am heavily leaning towards Dr. Thee because I really don&#39;t want to deal with all that pain and long recovery time. Plus his results look just as good externally as Suporn Clinic does.

If you are going with colon you only have to remove hair from the perineum and lower scrotum if memory serves.

I spoke to Siam Transformative, and they told me that hair needs to be removed from the perineum, scrotum and shaft area. They sent me a diagram stating all 3 had to be done, since Dr. Thee uses the externals bits for the vulva which includes the clitoris, clitoral hood and both sets of labia.
</p>
<p>
The next thing I have to do is discuss hair removal with my technician. Since I am originally scheduled with Suporn clinic all they required was the removal from the perineum, but if I change doctors I have to go back to removing all hair from all 3 regions and I have to ask my technician how long will it take. If it is going to take a while, I will ask her to switch from laser to electrolysis to speed up the hair removal process.
</p>
<p>
Laser is great and all but you have to wait a month and a half between sessions, where-as electrolysis you can go in weekly until it&#39;s all cleared.

I went with laser personally and did the whole thing i would go with electrolisis but not many lgbt friendly people here would would do laser on my genitals in the first place let alone finding a skilled person to do Electrolysis who is accepting.
</p>
<p>
For me my technician had me come in every 2 weeks so i was able to get about 6 sessions in 3 months but i would go with electrolysis if i were you its more effective.

Yeah I hear you on that.
</p>
<p>
I have dark and light hairs both down there so I&#39;d need to do a combination of both. Do laser one week then to electrolysis until I can do laser again.
</p>
<p>
According to my technician laser is supposed to be done every 6 weeks minimum. That is why I am considering either doing a combination of both or switching strictly to electrolysis.

Thats every 1 month and a half i don&#39;t know if that is typical or if my technician used short intervals to get as much hair as possible. But i think you technician might use long intervals or something because when i went on hormones 6 years ago i went to a different salon and the lady used every 2 week interval on my body but every 4 weeks on my face.

Might be, I see my technician in a week and a half and I need to discuss how aggressive we can be with hair removal to see how quickly it can be done.
</p>
<p>
Next thing I need to do is talk to my hormone doctor and get on a cream to reverse the atrophy that I have experienced on my hormones so that I can have better results externally. I was just told by Siam Transformative that my labia minora will be smaller due to the tissue the doctor has to work with. That is more than likely because of atrophy of my genitals over the last 7 years while on hormones.
</p>
<p>
So I need to get in touch with my doctor and see if she will prescribe me a topical treatment to reverse the atrophy so that I have more tissue to work with when the surgery date comes along.

Did you start hrt at a young age if you don&#39;t mind me asking ? I started at 17 and i didnt have much atrophy down there in terms of skin shrinking but the other tissues did get smaller over the 6 years on hrt.
</p>
<p>
I heard about T cream being a thing for atrophy when it comes treating atrophy for future surgery i think Jazz from &#34; i am jazz&#34; was treated like that or was going to be treated before her srs i don&#39;t remember fully lol.

Congratulations! Although I don’t understand why it’s double the price of PAI ( preecha ) when it’s same surgeons etc unless you stayed at deluxe hotels and flew business class etc all included ? Can you explain ?

I flew business class with Emirates so count 2500 for the trip plus i payed 300euro to get a visa to be able to get in Thailand about 100euro for covid insurance and 80-100euro for quarantine in a hotel also my airbnb cost  was 450euro for 5 weeks the surgery and after care package is much cheaper. Compared to places in the US and Europe i think the total was pretty cheap.

Yeah ok I guess they also charge a commission for things as well  I was given a quote around 7,200 US dollars for surgery at PAI for SRS  This quote was a few months ago but didn’t say which surgeon  etc. I feel after surgery I’d want to be in clean hotel with room service and food etc ability to play DVDs etc  But each ti their own choice I guess  I ve been to Thailand so many times for business and leisure I also worked and lived there for 18 months BUT last time was 2012 I suspect it’s all hot more expensive etc but they are the only option for SRS surgey as much cheaper  I hope you’re still doing well and living the dream 😴

I don&#39;t really have loads of discharge like i did in the early recovery but i still have some. As far as odor goes i was adviced to douche with water after dilating to flush the lube out , for a few months i wanted to see if i could combat any smell with boric acid and probiotics so i tried it but after being off the boric acid and probiotics i did notice off odor from time to time so i went back to douching like i was told initially and im fine.
</p>
<p>
I think the odor might be because my canal is 9 inches long and the lube until it travels all the way down takes time and goes &#34;bad?!&#34;  and also because for the first 2 inches the entrance is made with skin graft so some skin cells and possible skin oils could be accumulating if its not properly cleaned. I definitely noticed the actual discharge doesn&#39;t smell unpleasant for me if i keep up with douching after dilations. In my next post about my results i will mention this because i think is important info. Never the less i dont mind douching if it means everything smells and feels good.

So you did the sigmoid colon by laparoscopic technique? Dr. Theerapong just reviewed my case and recommended open sigmoid colon for my revision. I was hoping to do it thru laparoscopic approach.
