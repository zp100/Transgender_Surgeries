<p>
Hey all,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m having srs with Dr. Theerapong next week in thailand and decided to write a pre op review and why I decided to go with him, sort of my thought process through deciding which doctor to go with.
</p>
<p>
So I would say my interest in srs started late last year to around January of this year. I was just adamant to go through with it to rid myself of genital dysphoria and wanted to go with the doctor with the shortest wait time.
</p>
<p>
I began with a consult with Dr. Schecter in Illinois as he was nearest to me and was advised by my local youth center. I had a consult in January and my first question was how soon he could operate as I had just enrolled with private insurance and knew he would be covered. They told me around April. He showed me some pics and they looked weird but at this point I really didnt know what to look for.
</p>
<p>
A little after I started looking into the USA doctors but all of them had long wait times and I didnt really like their aesthetics but still, at this point I didnt know what I was looking at, just knew their aesthetics didnt look good to me.
</p>
<p>
I decided to look into what everything should look like and how it looks like in cis females. Rummaged through google, wikipedia, porn, everything. Really familiarized myself with how natal vaginas look and how they function etc.
</p>
<p>
I realized that I not only cared about aesthetics, I also cared about function and wanted something as similar to a vaginal canal as well. My goal is to have something cis passing in appearance but also in feeling, especially being heterosexual, I did not want my future SO to notice that much of difference to cis females in appearance and feeling.
</p>
<p>
At this point I started looking into different techniques and which would offer me a canal most similar to a cis canal. I researched the structure and cellular composition of the female canal and became aware it&#39;s made of squamous epithelial cells.
</p>
<p>
No other technique came close to a similar canal cellular structure than the sigmoid colon, which is columnar epithelium cells. Same types of cells in a natal vagina, just layered differently. Where as a natal female the cells form ridges (called rugae), the colon was the same but smooth and did not contain ridges or no rugae. It provided everything else though, a similar feel and also lubricated itself like natal vaginas.
</p>
<p>
The ph of a colon is different, being mostly neutral or slightly basic whereas a natal vagina was on the acidic side.
</p>
<p>
With this in mind, and knowledge of the appearance of natal vaginas I looked into different doctors, who provided the colon technique I decided was optimal for me.
</p>
<p>
At this point I knew I wasnt going to go with a US doctor and stopped paying my 300$ monthly insurance premium.
</p>
<p>
I stumbled across Dr. Kamol, a thai surgeon who performs colon srs. Looking at his pictures though I soon realized his vaginal entrance was always below where the labia minora end, whereas in natal females the labia minora surround the entrance. The labia minora ending above the entrance made it appear as if the vagina had two seperate vestibules, when natal vaginas have one.
</p>
<p>
Then looked into other thai doctors who perform colon like at the pai institute but same dilemma, their aesthetics had the labia minora end before the entrance.
</p>
<p>
I then looked into Dr. Suporn/bank. Their aesthetics were pretty good and the labia minora always surrounded the entrance. The thing I did not like about the aesthetics was that their technique resulted in the labia minora looking very stretched and tubular, as if they were thick rubberbands where as natal females minora was more wrinkled and curtainy in appearance. Also sometimes their results had the entrance appear gaping and large.
</p>
<p>
With that though I decided that they were the best I was going to get. I was so adamant about the aesthetics that i even decided I would go to them and get their standard srs, and at a later future date revise my canal at another thai doctor and get the colon canal.
</p>
<p>
Sent in a deposit and booked a date.
</p>
<p>
Stumbled upon Dr. Theerapong by looking in the wiki here. I was kind of shocked, his vaginas looked very good and his labia minora in particular looked astounding, they surrounded the entrance and looked very wrinkled and curtainy similar to natal vaginas. I dug deeper and reached out to his clinic, called the interplast clinic. They sent me some photos and also said he does the colon technique. I thought it was too good to be true, a doctor whose aesthetics matched my ideal and also did the colon technique, meaning I could do it all in one go and save thousands of dollars by forfeiting a second surgery.
</p>
<p>
They also sent me a link to many of his results, the website being thesexchange.com. They had 200+ photos of results and all of them looked quite similar, some variations and some looking better than others but still, all very similar so trustworthy that those were accurate representations of his work.
</p>
<p>
Still with this, I was nervous. There was not much I could find online about him as not many foreigner girls have been to him, since his main clientel were thai patients.
</p>
<p>
Being the neurotic wreck that I am I began messaging thai people from Facebook, hoping any of them would help redirect me to thai trans women who could then tell me more about this doctor.
</p>
<p>
After weeks of messaging strangers I finally added a thai trans activist who led me to another girl who had been to him. I messaged her, asking if her results matched. To my dismay, a photo of her result showed her canal was under the labia minora, something I feared. I asked when she had her operation and she said 10 years ago. With this in mind I knew that Dr. Theerapongs results did look different 10 years ago and he did put the entrance below the minora like many other doctors. But 7-8 years ago he revised his technique to come closer to matching natal vaginas appearance with the minora surrounding the entrance. If you check the website, you&#39;ll notice he has 11 editions which are all different techniques and updates to his technique.
</p>
<p>
I emailed the clinic and they confirmed. That technique was old and was changed around 7 years ago.
</p>
<p>
Still I was nervous. I asked the girl if she had other friends whod been to him more recently so that I can confirm his updated technique. She referred me to a thai trans girl group which had other girls who&#39;ve been to him. I joined and reached out to other girls who had gone recently.
</p>
<p>
To my happiness some shared their photos and confirmed that thesexchange websites results were accurate and the vaginal entrance was between the minora.
</p>
<p>
Elated I decided I was going with him, cancelled with suporn/bank, got my deposit refunded and redirected to him.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d like to add that some photos on those websites do show the labia being very thick but he does address it by some patients having more donor tissue, and a revision labiaplasty a few months later would slim them down and tidy them up.
</p>
<p>
I had no issue with this as even if my minora are thick or long, the importance for me was that the vestibule look one, and minora being curtainy and wrinkly, and the entrance not being gaping.
</p>
<p>
If the texture and placement of the minora was correct and cis appearing, trimming up and beautifying it wouldnt be a problem down the line with an aesthetic revision.
</p>
<p>
Also with regards to the colon technique resulting in excess discharge and malodor, from my research this came out to be not true. First I did my own research looking up peer reviewed articles on pubmed and the results showed that excess discharge was only early post op and diminished over time. And smell was not true only in bad hygiene related cases. Further research into the physiology of the colon confirmed my research as the colon itself does not smell, and neither does the mucus it secretes, being similar to saliva in texture and smell, the &#34;smell&#34; comes from the digestive tract. Being that our colon is inhabited by sulfur producing gut bacteria and feces which produce foul odor. Taking the colon out of the digestive tract to line a vagina, there would be no issues of smell.
</p>
<p>
Here is a link of pubmed papers which you can read through and see for yourselfs the results of the colon technique:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/?term=sigmoid+colon+vaginoplasty+">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/?term=sigmoid+colon+vaginoplasty+
</a>
</p>
<p>
Also from the thai trans group I got into touch with girls who have had the colon technique. And they confirmed that there is no smell unless its hygiene related in which it sometimes smells fishy. Also one has said she still uses lube during sex as she has not much lubrication from it.
</p>
<p>
It also seems like for thai girls it is the preferred method, with them telling each other to save more money to get that technique over the standard one.
</p>
<p>
Anyways this was my preop review and why I decided to go with Dr. Theerapong.
</p>
<p>
My surgery is on the week of August 19th and I will be posting some post op reviews and telling you my experience and if everything went according to plan. And all things I didnt account for and complications etc.
</p>

Here are some photos of Dr. Theerapongs results for those who want to see:

Have you not considered the peritoneal technique for vaginal construction?

What are the complications and problems that can arise from using sigmoid colon method? I always thought it was somewhat harder on the body.

Hi
</p>
<p>
Yea so it is a more invasive surgery and there well be a general surgeon for that part of the surgery, the part of removing a part of my sigmoid to line the vagina.
</p>
<p>
The complications of that are similar to many colon surgeries, mainly that if the anastomosis isnt dont properly you can leak fecal matter and get an infection. This is very rare though.
</p>
<p>
Another complication is your digestion changes, mainly you might get an upset stomach from foods that didnt give you issues before, and that you might need to use the bathroom more often, especially early post op.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re concerned about the colon resection part you can look into colon resection forums where people talk about their experiences.
</p>
<p>
Most people there are getting their sigmoid removed for cancer or digestive issues not for srs.
</p>
<p>
Also they get larger parts of their colon removed than the amount removed for a colon srs.
</p>
<p>
In any case the research ive done from reading colon resection forums is that a sigmoid colon resection doesnt cause much changes to digestion at all and they recover in a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
Soreness in the abdomen from the incision and muscles cut is the most pain experienced.
</p>
<p>
But yes, it is more risky and dangerous than regular srs.
</p>
<p>
It is a case of weighing pros and cons and for me the pros outweigh the possible complications. For others it might not be worth it but for me it is.
</p>
<p>
Oh something I forgot to add about the colon technique is that other than the first few months post op, dilation wont be required.
</p>
<p>
You dilate early post op to keep the connection site between the skin and colon wide because it can tighten. Also you cannot dilate to full depth for the first 2 months post op as the end of the canal heals. Then you can dilate to full depth with no risk of harming the end of the canal. Once the connection site is healed and it is not tight you dont need to technically dilate as the colon never closes up. Its walls may rest on eachother similar to a cis vaginal canal but it wont close shut with no dilation like a skin graft will.

Hi
</p>
<p>
So yea anal is different.
</p>
<p>
Anal the tightest part is around the spichter near the outside, and inside it&#39;s not tight as the rectum is largeish in diameter and your colon is not surrounded by anything to constrict it.
</p>
<p>
The difference would be that when the colon is used to line a vaginal canal, the canal would be surrounded by pelvic muscles always pushing against the colon from every direction to close.
</p>
<p>
So it would feel tight and constricting around the penis, similar to a natal vagina.
</p>
<p>
You can also look up quite easily the diamter of the sigmoid colon, its smaller than the diameter or the average penis but it would stretch to accommodate girth, and that&#39;s another thing, the colon is more durable and pliable and can stretch somewhat without harm.
</p>

How many Colon SRS surgeries has he done? It seems like kamol and PAI have done thousands?  Possible he has done fewer. Also PAI has a bowel surgery specialist come in  and do the colon resection part and then the SRS doctor completes the rest.  Does this doctor have something similar?

4 days post op.
</p>
<p>
Hi so idk how many he has done I just know he does them quite a bit.
</p>
<p>
For the colon srs patients he actually does surgery at a different hospital than the one he uses for regular srs and his cosmetic work (he has lots of aussie cosmetic clients).
</p>
<p>
The colon srs is done at a public hospital not private and is kind of old looking and not that pretty tbh. Buttt the colorectal specialist who does the colon resection part works full time here so we come to him.
</p>
<p>
Ngl this hospital is pretty old and ugly and I can&#39;t wait to leave but my recovery has been very well.
</p>
<p>
First 2 days lots of pain in my abdomen cause of muscles cut for incision but now feel much better, not much pain unless I cough and I&#39;ve been walking since day 2 and getting better everyday.
</p>
<p>
I passed gas like 10 times 12 hours after surgery and pooped 24 hours later so my bowel function is restored. No fever or anything so the anastomosis is good. Will get to eat soft foods tomorrow.

Dr Teerapong appears to be on the PAI website after doing a google search. It looks like he used to work there?  Perhaps he offers similar quality results..

Yes they are real.
</p>
<p>
You can also visit the website and see almost 300 results. Although I&#39;d focus on the latest ones as some of the old ones are older technique and not as &#39;aesthetic&#39;. They&#39;re dated and in chronological order so you know which ones are recent and which are older.

It&#39;s funny cause you can also see where it would benefit from a revision, if you were a perfectionist. You could trim up and cinch up a few things in a revision that would even further the aesthetics.

So how is the sensation with these colon techniques? If they remove a part of the colon and put it back in to a different place, I would assume that there&#39;s no sensation at all because the nerves are cut? Of course the vulva and clitoris still has sensation but the vagina doesn&#39;t?
</p>
<p>
What about excess secretion? Is it really an issue?

I was chatting with another person who is getting a revision to the colon method. She said that from her research (I know this is like too many times removed),  girls that have both have mentioned the sensation to be about the same.

Hey, do you know if the elasticity of the vagina is better than with other methods? Since it&#39;s not skin which is used here I think

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? Do you recommend Dr. Teerapong? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in Thailand? How was Dr. Teerapong&#39;s aftercare? Have you tried the dilators of the soul? And if you used them, is there any advantage? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

Hi!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m late, but.... I had a surgery 2 years ago. Recently I had a swab, which returned squamous epithelial cells... and my pH is 5.0.

Squamous epithelial cells are definitely not good.
</p>
<p>
pH is good.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t gotten to the bottom of the issue with squamous cells and doctors left the clinic.
