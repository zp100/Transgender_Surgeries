I’m so happy for you!  Have you been happy with Kaiser? I also live in NorCal and can choose between Kaiser and BCBS.

thank you! i’ve been really happy with kaiser. i also had the same choice when i was deciding between plans at my job. i live in oakland, so i decided to go with Kaiser since their transitions specialty department is also there. they’ve been a great help and cover FFS, BA and SRS. i’m currently looking into electrolysis now.

Thanks for the reply! What sort of hurdles do you have to jump over for BA, SRS and electrolysis?  Do they have good doctors in those specialties? I’m MtF pre-everything except the decision to change. Thanks for your help!

i haven’t gone through these procedure myself, so please bear that in mind! from what i remember about BA and electrolysis, there is an additional requirement that you’ve been on hormones for X amount of time (i think it’s 6 months). you probably also need a referral from their gender therapist to classify the procedures as medically necessary. if someone sees that i’m wrong, please correct me.
</p>
<p>
i would recommend that you join a FB group called Transgender care via Kaiser, though!! the girls there are very helpful and some of them have gone through those procedures that i have not. i’m excited for your transition journey!

i’m curious myself! the nurses and doctors have told me that these types of procedures are the peak of their performance 6 months to a full year out. my swelling has significantly dropped at this point but i still can feel and see areas that should go down in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
And i fe your frustration - my nose is probably my largest source of gender dysphoria. i still have my nose cast on so it’s actually hard for me to see the physical change, but i’m happy to update as i recover. and yay!! i’m so happy for you. it’s normal to be nervous - i was in tears while i was getting wheeled to surgery. it’ll all go well. in addition to dr. kleinberger, all the staff in and out of the facility have a lot of experience serving trans people. i didn’t get misgendered one bit while i was i. their care.

My congratulations! Investing in your body is the best investment! I felt the same way when I made rhinoplasty and blepharoplasty, and I also wrote a post about my experience)

Congratulations. I am a patient of Dr. Kleinberger and had FFS over two years ago with him. It took about 6 weeks for swelling to subside for the most part, keep your wraps on! But it really took a year for everything to finally settle down 100%, like around the nose. I&#39;m much older, so a followup facelift a year later really made the results shine.
</p>
<p>
Some people say Dr. k is too conservative, but I was very happy with my results, they were feminine and natural looking. I look like a feminine version of myself.
</p>
<p>

<p>
I think he&#39;s  great doctor and you are in very good hands with kaiser.

Hey! Good luck.
</p>
<p>
I also had my FFS with Dr. K but almost 3 years ago. To be honest, I&#39;m now seeking a revision because he was much too conservative for what I needed. I had a consultation recently with a Private Practice surgeon who agrees, so I&#39;m hoping this moves along swiftly. Anyway. I hope he&#39;s gotten a lot more practice and is maybe being a little more aggressive now. Wishing you all the happiness in the world.

I had the whole work up with him, and I see him in a few days... for the final check up. But it’s been I think four months now, and the tip of my nose is still swollen along with my chin. He did pretty good work, but I still can’t really breathe out of my nose. Best of luck healing; make sure to follow everything they tell you to do!!
