This post is a continuation of my experiences following a peritoneal pull-through vaginoplasty from Dr. Heidi Wittenberg, March 9th 2021.  I&#39;m having to re-post this part because the previous post got filter-disabled after an edit, apparently because of a link to a vibrator seller.  After a month of working with a transgender_surgeries mod trying to get it restored, reddit&#39;s admins claim it can&#39;t be restored, so here it is again.  Sorry for the comments that were lost on the previous post.

<p>
In my last post, I spoke too soon on revision surgery cost. I later got a second bill for $2k, bringing the total cost to $4300. Really ridiculous for such a small surgery.
</p>
<p>
My clit sutures dropped off around 5-26 though it still feels like there are sutures under the skin to the bottom left. Surprisingly, they don&#39;t hurt to touch. It hasn&#39;t flipped seriously sideways since surgery but the right edge consistently gets caught under a lip of firm flesh like in the picture above, which makes it tilt slightly right. I pull it over that lip whenever I can. I feel like it may have taken on a more oval shape since surgery, like it&#39;s been squished. When I&#39;m aroused it pushes out completely and lays flat.
</p>
<p>
I went to a water park on 6-16 so things go submerged but I haven&#39;t seen issues from that. I actually lost my notes on if I was supposed to wait 6 or 8 weeks to submerge, but it was 7 weeks and a day and I&#39;d never had bleeding or much pain after the first week so I figured it would be okay.
</p>
<p>
My 6-5-23 gyn visit showed no granulation to treat, and it&#39;s been that way for I think 2.5 months so we agreed I can stop seeing her unless I notice bleeding again. I&#39;m quite happy about that.
</p>
<p>
Since I changed my dilation tactic to spread my legs, I feel like the ridge of flesh near the apex that catches on my dilator and hurts has spread farther around to most sides. When I massage at it for 60 strokes with the blue dilator it tends to leave a little blood on the dilator, and there was some blood from masturbating with it as well. So I switched to massaging with orange and that hurts less and hasn&#39;t caused bleeding after about 5 sessions.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve managed to achieve vaginal penetration with my partner a few times now. Two times shallowly, then about a week later at least halfway with him able to climax, and then almost all the way but unable to climax. I think that means my new method of dilating is helping, though it could be a coincidence. I think I&#39;m getting orange to full depth more easily, but it&#39;s hard to be sure. Also, he tried a cock ring but it didn&#39;t help much with his softening problem.
</p>
<p>
I used deionized water, a new flask, and some pH buffers to test my strips at 5.0 and 6.0 pH:
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d say the 6.0 reading fairly closely matches the 6.0 readings I&#39;ve been getting from the gyn testing my vag (discussed in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/x25qni/part_10_had_pptppvpptv_with_dr_heidi_wittenberg/">update 10

</a>
</p>
<p>
Most of my gyn tests have come out around 6.0. So that&#39;s not as good as the 4.4 or less &#34;normal&#34; range but it&#39;s better than the 7.0 you would expect from a penile inversion.
</p>
<p>
In other news, I&#39;ve discovered I can sit far back on the bidet and clean myself with spread legs instead of lifting myself off the toilet. It makes for less water spraying around. I also got this
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004IQM460">new Noogleberry pump
</a>
which is much slower than the pump the breast enlargement cups came with but it also seems able to pull a might harder vacuum which makes me feel like I might be making more progress, but it&#39;s hard to tell. I&#39;ve also discovered
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00119QUK8">these hair clips
</a>
are much better than the previous ones I was using, and that using some anti-frizz stuff after showering helps my hair stay in place. Who&#39;d have thought!
</p>
<p>
So that&#39;s it. I&#39;m happy with everything at this point except how tight I am with my partner, but I hope that will ease up over time. Probably won&#39;t be too much more to discuss in future updates but I&#39;ll see you then!

Just a tiny update. The firmness at the bottom left of my clit mostly disappeared between 6-21 and 6-22 so it&#39;s laying pretty flat now. It still looks right tilted in photos but when I feel it it&#39;s almost straight and the right edge is sometimes barely caught under flesh and sometimes not. As long as it stays this way, I&#39;m happy.
</p>
<p>
I also found that at this point, the orange dilator is better for masturbation and doesn&#39;t trigger the remaining sore spots as much. I don&#39;t get bleeding when I use it for massage but for masturbation there is sometimes a little blood. It still takes a lot of pressure to keep orange at full depth but it goes in pretty quickly. I still can&#39;t tell if I&#39;ve gotten any looser from the big purple dilator.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, I managed to masturbate today with only lube from my vag. I rubbed my clit for quite awhile before I rubbed a dildo through my lips and managed to get it into my canal. Things got almost too dry sometimes but stayed barely wet enough. It&#39;s hard to tell where the lube comes from but I&#39;m almost certain some comes from my urethra from the prostate.

Another tiny update: I was able to have sex with my BF without dilating first! Very happy about that. He still can&#39;t get to full depth, unfortunately, but maybe in time.

I haven&#39;t had any problems with my clit turning since the surgery and I&#39;ve been able to massage away all the knots and hard spots. Hurray!
</p>
<p>
Things continue to be a problem with my BF as I&#39;m usually too tight for him and the tightness makes him soft. Bleh. But I found a new partner and they fit me perfectly! I don&#39;t even have to dilate first and things still feel magical with them. There&#39;s just some faint soreness halfway in but I don&#39;t notice it much.
</p>
<p>
A couple months ago, I did get some blood on my dilator for a few days and went to see the gyn who didn&#39;t find any granulation and said everything looked more healthy than last time she saw me, so that&#39;s great news. I do get blood every 3-6 weeks but I think it comes from me pushing too hard with the big dilator because of my impatience. I pushed so hard one time that I was sore for a few days and had to stop using it for awhile. I haven&#39;t had any blood or problems since I stopped pushing so hard (maybe two months ago?).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been seeing a new physical therapist who has given me new things to try that seem to be helping. She has me do a kegel squeeze for 3 secs, release 3, then push &#34;down to the basement&#34; kind of like loosening the vaginal canal or maybe trying to push something out of it for 3 secs. Repeat 5 total times, 5 times a day. I&#39;m not sure what this is meant to accomplish but I think it may be making it easier to keep the dilator at full depth.
</p>
<p>
On my back with knees up, she had me put pressure on five equidistant points from the top of my labia to the bottom, and when I found a painful spot I held it for 60 secs. I was to put the leg on that side down flat, or lay my knee out to the side, or lay the knee out with the foot behind my other foot and hold whatever position eased the pain most. I could also mash the flesh above the point or below the point towards the point to relieve pain as well. After doing this only 2-3 times I got rid of the painful points and then have been forgetting to do it.
</p>
<p>
Next visit she said to use the blue dilator (two sizes down from the orange) four times a week with the tip angled down to put firm pressure at full depth for 10 mins, then turn it to point down left and hold for 5 mins, then up (normal position) for 10 mins. This replaces my orange dilator on those nights. This hurt the first time but after one or two tries it stopped hurting when pointing down but still hurts when pointing down left. These long loads are supposed to help scar tissue, which is interesting because the previous pt had me rubbing at these same areas for 60 secs which never really seemed to help.
</p>
<p>
In other news, I was having trouble with itchy labia that resolved when I started rubbing CeraVe moisturizing cream on them.
</p>
<p>
Someone also asked me a few months ago if I thought the surgery was worth it, and I&#39;ve always thought it was, even when it was most painful. Things just keep getting better, so it just requires a lot of work and patience. Plus I think most people get away with having far fewer issues than I did, along with quicker healing, while some are worse off. You should always be prepared to face the worst outcomes if you choose to do the surgery, but if you get a good surgeon, the risk of bad outcomes is far lower.
</p>
<p>
The last few months I rarely remember to douche but I&#39;m not getting any slime or bad smells, so that&#39;s nice. This is likely thanks to no longer bleeding which gives bacteria something to feed on.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it for now. Hopefully things keep going well.

</a>
</p>
<p>
As I described in my last update, I continued to use the blue dilator to hold pressure at painful points every 2-3 days for at least 6 months. The pain around my canal entrance did mostly resolve but the pain halfway in and fully in remained mostly unchanged. It was always pretty painful as I removed the dilator after a session with the blue. Around Jan 2024 I reduced my dilation from daily to every other day and found that things became less painful. So I needed 4-5 days to heal each time I used blue.
</p>
<p>
Around July I started using the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/LOVENSE-Nora-Rabbit-Vibrator-Exploration/dp/B01AL3Y0K6">Lovense Rabbit vibrator
</a>
instead of the blue. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s long enough to reach full depth but its softness is much kinder on my tissues and I don&#39;t have a lot of pain pulling it out when I finish with it. What I think is most important is that the long part undulates so even if I just hold it in one direction against scar tissue, its movement varies the pressure and puts a bit of side to side motion against it as well. This should serve to break up scar tissue better than a single force in one direction. I&#39;ve had more improvements in pain the last 3 months with this tactic than I had with 9+ months of the blue dilator.
</p>
<p>
My process with Lovense is to get it in far enough to feel the painful spots halfway into the canal, then hold it against a wall for 5 mins, sometimes shifting the pressure left or right to try to cover one quarter of the vaginal wall roughly equally. I repeat the same for 5 mins for the three other quarters of the wall. I end by pushing it as deep as it will go for 5 mins and letting it wiggle against the deepest scar tissue. About a week ago, for the first time things actually felt good when I was done with this instead of painful and I ended up masturbating with the vibe.
</p>
<p>
Lovense is pretty pricey and a lot of what you&#39;re paying for is the ability to control it remotely (a feature I&#39;ve never used) so you might be able to find a cheaper vibe that has the wiggling motion. It feels like it has a slightly Z-shaped piece of metal in it that just rotates using a motor in the base. I usually use it at speed 1 or 2 and I can&#39;t put too much sideways force on it or the motor strains. To get the wiggle moving, the on button must be held for a few seconds which turns on the clit vibrator, then the second button turns on and sets the speed of the wiggle. You can turn off the clit vibe by tapping the on button around 8 times till it stops vibrating.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still using the orange dilator to maintain full depth for around 20 mins per session. Ideally, I do orange, take a day off, do Lovense, day off, orange, etc. In reality I often skip 1-3 extra days between sessions, so when I do get back to orange it&#39;s always somewhat painful to reach full depth. I&#39;ve learned that I need to use less pressure and ease into the full depth without triggering too much pain over about 5 minutes or I&#39;ll cause a slight amount of blood to be left near the dilator tip. Even when I ease into it I sometimes get the blood, but not always, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s granulation tissue returning. I think it just keeps trying to tighten up at the end of the canal and I need to go slow as I stretch it open again. I&#39;m still reaching the same depth mark in the end so going to full depth every 4-6 days seems to be working for maintenance.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t go full depth on Lovense days, but I do still use the largest
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Dilator-Exerciser-Trainer-Technology/dp/B0B94MNTPB">VWELL super fit dilator
</a>
as deep as I can get it for 15 mins. It hasn&#39;t gone noticeably deeper since I started using it, and may not even get as deep as it originally did now that I&#39;m using it less often. I forgot to mention that I switched from the silicone dilators to VWELL at least a year ago because VWELL is significantly stiffer and a bit larger towards the tip so I think it stretches me better. I still hate that it&#39;s not medical-grade silicone but at least it doesn&#39;t irritate me.
</p>
<p>
In non-vaginal news, I finally found
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DDQ88HX3">a bra
</a>
that gives me cleavage! The trick is to go far lower than my band size (36B in the photo instead of 44AAAA, but 32B is even better) so the cups are much closer together, then use 4-5 band extenders. I&#39;ve tried that before and my boobs would just slide out of the cups over time, but something about this bra design is holding them in place and it makes me really happy. It also helps that I had some very slow additional breast growth since bottom surgery.
