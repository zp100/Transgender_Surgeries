Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
This is my first time seeing results from a Mexican SRS surgeon and I’m really excited, I never even considered having surgery in my home country!
</p>
<p>
If you have the time, could you tell me why you chose Dr. Ivan and how much you spent in total?

Interestingly, I chose Dr. Ivan because I was just looking for an orchiectomy but was an easy upsell. And having many people on reddit comment on how great their experience with him was...
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Cosmetic SRS was $10,500 USD and that price will likely be higher. I also got another $10,000 USD in plastic surgery done at the same time. Some things that weren&#39;t included (so far):
<br>
1. Travel to/from GDL
<br>
2. Staying at Numi Recovery House (I am in a &#34;junior room&#34; at $135USD/night for about 20 nights)
<br>
3. Lab tests before (about 100 USD)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
An additional medication prescribed by the plastic surgeon (about 500 MXN)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
3 Hyperbaric sessions at about 600 MXN each.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Unknown amount: getting Disney+ to work in my room at Numi House.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

Oh no!  Disney+ plus not working is the most painful part of the process, you have my sympathy /s
</p>
<p>
But in all seriousness, thank you so much, I’ll definitely consider Dr. Ivan in a couple of years once I have the money to pay for the surgery
</p>
<p>
Good luck and enjoy your lack of dangly bits! Take care

I did manage to get my Amazon Prime account connected. Disney+ won&#39;t let me sign up for an account in Mexico using a credit card (or paypal) from the US. I may ask the nurse if the Walmart sells Disney+ gift cards or something. I used to do that with Netflix. I never gave them a credit card, just bought a gift card at the grocery store when the account was running low.
</p>
<p>
I cashed out a couple IRA to do this. I&#39;m 52 years old and figured if I waited until I had the cash on hand, it might never happen.

The hyperbaric sessions came to $1050 MXN. I&#39;ve had another $20-$30 in miscellaneous expenses and I will probably tip everyone generously when I leave (so another $300 US). You can get your labwork done ahead of time maybe for less money. My labwork was delayed, so Dr. Ivan used labwork I had done earlier in the month for a regular checkup (and it let my primary care physician know I was doing it). My flight from Denver to GDL with upgrades on Volaris was $500 (direct, upgrade included forward cabin seating and 2 carry-on bags).
</p>
<p>
I would highly recommend staying at Numi Recovery House for at least the first week after surgery. The nurses here know what they are doing.

That looks incredible. What do you mean by “cosmetic srs?” Did you have a vulvoplasty done done instead of a vaginoplasty?

Definitely stay at the Numi Recovery House! Yuni is sometimes hard to reach but it&#39;s worth it (I&#39;m waiting on the chef to serve lunch right now).
</p>
<p>
One thing I failed to take into account is the elevation. I get altitude sickness easily. That, combined with the swelling from FFS really triggered my anxiety. For some reason the ibuprofen they were giving me made my anxiety even worse. It&#39;s under control now. I stopped taking the ibuprofen (pain is about a 3 with an occasional twinge to 4-5). Because I am at the recovery house where my meds are administered by nurses, the doctor was able to prescribe a sedative/anti-anxiety medication.

I am staying a total of 21 days at the recovery house. I&#39;d recommend arriving at least three days before surgery. Your first day will just get you settled into your room, the second day you&#39;ll get lab work done and consult with the doctors, the third day you can explore a little and get more questions answered. I had FFS done at the same time. I few like the recovery from the FFS will take longer than the SRS.

You&#39;ll want to monitor the legality of THC in Jalisco. As of now (September 2022) there are still protests trying to get medical THC legalized. Also, I haven&#39;t noticed much smoking or vaping here. You&#39;ll want to get that sorted with your host before commiting.
</p>
<p>
I have had almost no painkillers the entire time. Pain is about a 3 with occasional twinges to 4-5. but I can usually rearrange how I am sitting and the pain goes away.

My pain levels increased a little today, GCS is now 4-5 regularly. I took a couple OTC Aleve and it&#39;s been gone.

Congrats! I&#39;m considering Dr. Aguilar, I have a consult coming up. Thank you for posting an update of your journey! I have a few questions if you don&#39;t mind me asking.
</p>
<p>
1.Did you do any electrolysis or laser hair removal beforehand?
</p>
<p>
2.Did you have any special requests or preferences for the GCS surgery? If so how receptive was Dr. Aguilar to those?

No hair removal at all. I was asked to shave as closely as possible the night before.  Supposedly Dr. Ivan &#34;scrapes&#34; any hair follicles off during surgery.
</p>
<p>
I had no special requests or preferences for GCS. I&#39;ve head that Dr. Ivan is very accommodating of special requests. For me this was an &#34;upsell&#34; from just an orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
The one regret I have is that I also had a bunch of plastic surgery done on my face at the same time.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I wish I had waited because recovery from that surgery (especially a neck lift) has been much more effortful than GCS.
</li>
<li>
I consulted with Dr. Ivan but he didn&#39;t do my face. I wish I had a separate consultation with the plastic surgeons. I was asked the morning of surgery how I wanted my nose and I ended up with two procedures done that Dr. Ivan didn&#39;t suggest but the plastic surgeons felt was necessary (lip lift and face lift). They didn&#39;t change extra for them.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I would come back here in a heart beat. Guadalajara is a nice place and if you stay at the Recovery House, you will be taken care of in the best possible manner.

All great to know. I was wondering if doing any ffs would be a bit much in one go. Glad to hear you&#39;re having a good experience.
</p>
<p>
Did you need to provide any therapist letters? I&#39;ve read mixed comments on those requirements.

Yes. Dr Ivan wanted one therapist letter. He also has no requiremnets for length of time on HRT or lived experience.

But the requirements might be different if you are young and/or don&#39;t have kids. I&#39;m 52 years old and have a 28 year old daughter.
