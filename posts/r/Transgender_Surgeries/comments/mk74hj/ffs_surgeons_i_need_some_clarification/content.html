I had FFS with Dr Saxon a little over a year ago. It was kind of a crazy experience, as it was right at the beginning of the pandemic and right before everything shut down for a bit. I was her last patient before she temporarily stopped doing surgery.
</p>
<p>
Overall I‚Äôm really happy with the results. I went with her for pretty much the same reasons you say you like her. She‚Äôs realistic, is confident but doesn‚Äôt have that god complex a lot of surgeons have, and doesn‚Äôt try to sell you on procedures that aren‚Äôt necessary. Like I went in thinking about getting a lip lift and she talked me out of it.
</p>
<p>
She‚Äôs a good surgeon. I had no complications and the only issues I still have with my face are age related, not because of the surgery. I plan on getting revisions on my nose, but that‚Äôs because I slipped in the snow and kinda bonked it. Before the surgery I didn‚Äôt pass, now I do.

Hi there. :) Very hard decision. Ya. My way. I got consultation with five surgeons from different states. Insurance no work. But was ready spend $25-$30K. What I decide? Chose South Korea for FFS. Got consultation with surgeon‚Äùs from 12 clinics and hospitals (online). Choose three. Arrived to Seoul, two weeks quarantine. After quarantine I visited just one clinic and decided do surgery in first one from my list. Surgery time was 14 hours. I got: - forehead lowering. - shaved eyebrows bone. - eyebrows lifting - lower blepharoplasty. - rhinoplasty - septoplasty ( I was crazy septum curvature. I already did surgery on my nose locally in my state, but septoplasty was finished without any visible changes, rhinoplasty also was done just so so. And I got nose more worse looking then before surgery..... I so cry after this .... Plus I spent $17K cash for this rhinoplasty/septoplasty .....) - nose tip plasty - nose alarm reduction. - jaw line bone was shaved. - jaws angle bone was reduced  - chin genioplasty . - under chin liposuction, plus my masculine was sutured. - fat was removed from my cheeks - nasolabial folds fat grafting - lips fillers - full face lifting  - Botox for full forehead
</p>
<p>
After surgery I stayed free 3 night in clinic. Clinic staff just amazing. (Usually you can stay in clinic only one night after surgery. But before surgery I said for doctors, I‚Äôm here just one, without friends or helper. If it‚Äôs possible, I want to stay like minimum 3 nights in clinic. I‚Äôm sure firs 2-3 days will be very hard.  And I got approved without any questions).
</p>
<p>
I paid $25K for everything.
</p>
<p>
O ya! Also I got 5 free vitamins infusions and free deswelling procedures.
</p>
<p>
After surgery care was also free and great. I finished all of this last year summer.
</p>
<p>
Now, after few weeks I‚Äôm again going to this clinic. For BA and one more surgery. I got best offer.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm satisfied with results. Trust for staff and doctors of this clinic.
</p>
<p>
This is how I found my way about FFS.
</p>
<p>
Hope they will give you some idea. :)
</p>
<p>
Good luck, girl! :)

Interesting... I have never heard of him before. Do you know if there are any threads about him specifically for FFS? Also, do you know anyone that has had FFS with him and what their experiences were with him?

There aren‚Äôt many and I don‚Äôt know anyone personally who had FFS with him. There a few FFS reviews in RealSelf. I‚Äôm having mostly ‚Äúordinary‚Äù work not having a brow ridge or other predominant male characteristics due to having low T growing up. The FFS procedures specifically will be a brow and lip lift and fat transfer to the face. The regular procedures I am also getting are upper/lower blepharoplasty, face lift, and neck lift. I am 68 years old been on HRT for 8 years.

Sure. One of the biggest things I noticed was that his forehead work is very conservative. Particularly in the orbital rim area, I have seen better results from other surgeons in terms of the placement of the brow work and the overall uniformity of the forehead.

I‚Äôm so sorry about that. Please don‚Äôt let this stop you or anything, the only reason I‚Äôm super picky about him was because I was seriously considering him as my surgeon, he runs a great practice.

No worries! It sounds like you have more specific results in mind than I do. From what I&#39;ve seen, I think I&#39;ll be happy with the results. Best of luck to you!

The only thing about all this is I find it fishy that she has all these 5-star reviews on google but looking deep I find places where it‚Äôs the total opposite. The thing is I really like Dr. Rodman a lot, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so confused and feel uneasy about it. But I also know that trolls exist so that may be. But her years of experience is also a fear of mine and I did notice some results that need more refining here and there.

At my age I would rather make the best choice and do it with one surgery. Guess will continue checking and cross checking. Thanks for the info. üôè
