Iâ€™m having surgery with him on June 22. I saw another girl post her results and seeing hers was what sold me on Dr. Hanna. The way the scars are already healing so well on hers and yours just makes me so confident in his ability. Anything else that you could possibly add or hints to help me would be greatly appreciated. Iâ€™m a little confused on the instructions to bowel cleanse. It keeps saying drink half of the remaining bottle so Iâ€™m confused. Iâ€™ll call their office if I donâ€™t eventually realize what they are trying to tell me to do about that. But any tips or things you hadnâ€™t thought of to take with you would help me out. Iâ€™ll have to sit for the ride home 9 hours so Iâ€™m considering renting a mini van to be able to lay down for the ride. How long were you able to sit a week after surgery?

Hi!  I also had Dr. Hanna! I drank about six 8 oz cups of the miralax solution, as well as the other prescribed meds. I wonâ€™t lie! it was hell, but it did a great job. You know you are doing it right when you are pooping out green juice (donâ€™t drink red gatorade because it will look like blood imo) I also threw up a couple times :) itâ€™s apparently normal. My advice is eat lightly the day before, and you will have a lot less to poop and puke out.
</p>
<p>
This is one of the hardest parts, but once itâ€™s over, itâ€™s OVER! and you can eat first day in the hospital. All of the nurses are incredibly nice, and very professional at Carrollton.

Looks good.
</p>
<p>
Sounds like you had surgery with Dr. Hanna around the same time I did. I&#39;ve been pretty happy with the results so far. I had a bit of necrosis of a section of the labia majora which will require a minor correction/revision, and some granular tissue development at the base, but otherwise I&#39;m fairly happy with the results.*
</p>
<p>
*To clarify, minor complications like mine happen, and they&#39;re thankfully fixable, it just would have been nice if they hadn&#39;t happened.

God Dr Hanna did me so well. Iâ€™m a little over a week post op with him and Iâ€™m amazed every day at how incredibly masterful he is at his craft. This guyâ€™s waiting list is gonna get really long really fast mark my words. Heâ€™s gonna be known as one of the greats, and not too long from now Iâ€™d wager.

Also I just wanted to mention the granulation tissue (which happens a lot!!) but you can call Dr. Hanna back and if you live in the area he will treat them for you. Happened to me and he took care of it right in the office

It really just depends on a lot of factors. At the beginning they were pretty painful, but as Iâ€™ve healed they have become much more tolerable. The morning dilation is always my most uncomfortable one.

If I can also chime in here, I had my initial consult with Dr. Hanna April 24th of this year and was offered surgery at the end of August. I have chosen farther out to give me more time to lose weight. It&#39;s not a long waiting period right now but as he gets more popular that might change. He&#39;s a great guy!
