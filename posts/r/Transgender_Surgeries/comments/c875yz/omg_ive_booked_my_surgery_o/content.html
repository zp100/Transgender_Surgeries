So, I&#39;m been awaiting this for my entire life, and I just received today the e-mail of my booking confirmation. Very excited, but scared to hell as well!!!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m doing a Team Surgery with team Suporn. Apparently during my surgery it will be Suporn and Prae. Does anyone has any experience with Dr. Prae? I&#39;m very curious about her job, but my little research so far didn&#39;t find any information about her except from what&#39;s on the website.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m assuming that it&#39;s safe to follow through as Suporn is with her and from what I&#39;ve read she is experienced in SRS with her own technique, but still having no one to talk about her results is a bit scary.
</p>
<p>
If anyone ever has gone through Team Surgery or operated with her alone and would like to share the feedback it would be very helpful!
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

I think you&#39;ll be one of the first with Dr Prae. Please report back and tell us all about it.
</p>
<p>
I think the way it works is that there&#39;s a lot of sharing with Suporn for these Team surgeries, and Dr Bank turned out amazingly well.

Yes, apparently I&#39;m the first one to be vocal about it at least... that&#39;s reeaaaally scary. But still, I&#39;m trusting Dr. Suporn judgement. He will be in the room and that&#39;s good enough for me.

With Bank I think Suporn did a large part of the early surgeries himeself with Bank slowly doing more and more as had learned. It&#39;s was a shared surgery.

Can confirm the same is with Dr Prae. And she’s really amazing. I’m recovering really quick and my results looks good so far.

Yes she is! I did the team surgery where Suporn was the main surgeon and she was there learning his technique. But she is an awesome surgeon by herself. Also very friendly person.

There&#39;s a private discord for Suporn, maybe you can get into that and ask.
