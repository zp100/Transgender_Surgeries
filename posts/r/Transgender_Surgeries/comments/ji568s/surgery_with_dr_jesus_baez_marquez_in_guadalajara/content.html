He is mostly on IG which is under dr.Jesus Baez he is a MASTER with noses and he did his patient coordinators forehead and a few other things and it looks awesome... I think they are in the works of building a site etc as he recently started to work more on ffs.... his prices are pretty much kind of leveled with Cardenas but the quality is much diff... he is much more detailed and even thought of things to avoid doing not to accentuate other things so that itself told me that he actually pays attention to YOUR face and doesn’t give you that copy and paste ffs approach...

I seen that also and brought it to light and well let’s just say there was a lot of mental issues at hand and trying to scam.... the “botched” outcome came from suporn... if you look at the after suporn pics then after Baez pics he actually SNATCHED her up better than suporn... if you look up her ig etc... Idk about you but I’m Deff NOT taking cute pics like that if my face was “horribly disfigured”... it’s a Shame what transpired but don’t go bashing someone who actually fronted money for your medical stay from suporns shitty work.... but MY experience was Wonderfull!

Nobody is taking anything away from anybody... everyone’s feelings are valid... it’s unfortunate what happened yeah that’s sad but when you have a history of bashing surgeon after surgeon it’s VERY sus.. I made this account to post my experience POINT BLANK sis! and I’m entitled to share it so have several seats!

I feel bad for that patient. I know what she was going through as I&#39;m suicidal everyday from my botched surgery. People also accused me of being crazy or imagining things until I show my scans and reports.

I know nothing can be done and that&#39;s why for many of us victims of rogue surgeons, death is the only way out. This is also why it is important to NOT silence negative experiences as it makes you think carefully about your choice.

You’d have to look at the Facebook posts to have any hope of working out what this was about, and even then it’s just guessing. It’s possible that Baez had no fault in this, but until we see a lot more reviews it’s hard to form any real opinion.

The post did read like an ad promoting the surgeon. If it is, then it is a badly written marketing piece.
