I know some of this is on the wiki but Iâ€™m gonna ask anyway.  Some questions I have are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
What did you get done?  What was the cost?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What does Dr. Z have you do for pre op?  Like tests bloodwork etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How long until you were able to shave your face again?  If that is something you have to do.  Iâ€™m not sure if I want electrolysis first or ffs.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you have any other info youâ€™re willing to share and you have experience with Dr. Z then please feel free to share ðŸ˜Š

Thatâ€™s good that they make sure youâ€™re comfortable.  Catheter sounds kinda scary though.  6 months?  Are facial massages an everyday thing or multiple times a day?    And good luck! ðŸ˜Š

I posted my experience with Dr. Z on Susan&#39;s place :
<a href="https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php/topic,215448.0.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php/topic,215448.0.html
</a>
</p>
<p>
I had quite a bit done: scalp advance, forehead contouring, lower eyelid blepharoplasty, rhinoplasty and septoplasty, chin contouring, lower face and neck lift, trachea shave, and fat injections to cheeks and nasolabial folds. The cost was $35K, but I have heard his prices have gone up in the last couple of years.
</p>
<p>
Pre-op is the standard medical clearance for surgery by your PCP: routine physical and blood work.
</p>
<p>
I did over two years of facial hair clearing before having FFS, so I never had to worry about shaving after FFS. For me it was the logical way to proceed.
