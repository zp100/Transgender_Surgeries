<p>
So I had a consultation with Dr. Haben this week. He&#39;s a super nice guy and didn&#39;t rush me at all. He told me my natural voice was slightly below avg male but that I have decent range. A &#34;single&#34; would get my natural voice into the androgynous/low feminine range and a &#34;triple&#34; (CTA) would get me into the avg female range but I would lose the lower end of my range. I could get the single and then, if that didn&#39;t turn out how I wanted it, I could go back and get a CTA, but then that would be another surgery and another month of not speaking. For those that have had VFS, should I opt for the CTA? Is losing the lower range a big deal? Also, if anyone got the single and it put their natural voice into androgynous territory, was that ok with you?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for any help! &lt;3

I got a single with Dr Haben a couple months ago (well actually a &#34;double&#34;, which is just single + trach shave, but the trach shave isn&#39;t really relevant).
</p>
<p>
My voice started out on the lower end of the male spectrum (I was on the fence about potentially doing a CTA as well). In the end, I figured that it made more sense to just do the single and if necessary I can always do the CTA later. I&#39;m really happy with the results. It&#39;s not super high pitched, but I get gendered correctly on the phone using my laziest voice (putting no effort into feminizing it). When I do put a little effort in, it sounds very feminine. Dr Haben instructed no vocal therapy until 3 months post surgery to avoid straining it and causing damage, so I&#39;ve generally be using my &#34;lazy voice&#34; -- already it&#39;s had such a positive impact on my life, and I have no doubt that after voice training I&#39;m going to love my voice even more.

Thank you for this! 1980, is that your birth year? If so, you&#39;re about my age. I was getting close to the cusp where the single is more risky because of healing so that was another concern of mine. I&#39;m also tall (6&#39;1&#34;) so Dr. Haben said that an androgynous voice might suit me better, given that tall women have slightly lower pitched voices.

I&#39;m actually a couple years younger than that. Also I&#39;m 6&#39;3 and he said the same to me. I think he&#39;s right...a really high pitched voice would probably seem a little off for me.

Did you lose a lot of your range? And if so, does your voice sound natural afterwards?

hmm, your preop voice wasn&#39;t too bad. It did sound a bit &#34;flamboyant male&#34; at the end of your words as you trailed off, but mostly feminine. However, there is a significant different before vs after. The after is what I would typically expect from a cis female. Thanks for the comment!

so is Haben a good option if the only goal is to completely eliminate any chance of me ever sounding male because that is still something I struggle with daily since transitioning in 2006. Every single day! I&#39;m so FED up, seriously. I speak fine and sound female but always fear that if I completely let go, cough, laugh, whatever, I will suddenly sound male and people will look at me like WTF? That is embarrassing and frustrating. So I always have to be on my guard and it&#39;s tiring!
</p>
<p>
Dr. Thomas said it best: &#34;Even when successful, some individuals
<strong>
remain fearful of letting their guard up for even a moment in a sensitive situation where a masculine voice would be inappropriate
</strong>
. As an ideal, after transition, comfortable speech would occur at a feminine pitch and with a feminine quality
<strong>
without having to think about contracting several muscles before every phonation
</strong>
.&#34;

With some effort, use mostly my mouth and less of my throat.

Both recordings sound really feminine. :) I doubt anyone would clock you on the phone ever.

Isn&#39;t lower end of range the masculine part? Don&#39;t we want to lose this? I&#39;m confused!

It is, buuuut, you still have the &#39;ability&#39;, with effort, to go low if you want, for whatever reason (singing, imitating someone, etc) With a CTA you lose that ability. It&#39;s not a huge price to pay imo if you don&#39;t lose a lot of range, but something to consider.

I&#39;m the one that changed things at the Rochester Hospital with Dr. Haben about his attitude towards myself 2020 Sept. and Nursing staff addressing me deliberately in the wrong pronouns being post op SRS 2019 - he&#39;s changed his tune some then !!  my surgery the &#34;Triple&#34; dd not work in anyway - told me to to go read about it in person this asshole on his website , no explanation in person during consult , nothing ??   - bad experience from an arogant &#34;Man&#34;  bottom line  toward me - At my age at the time age 62 I wasn&#39;t taking dirty crap he spun at me back in 2020 - I&#39;&#39;m happy he treated you well but I paid the price and said my piece - my fight on emails and complaints to the Hospital didn&#39;t go unnoticed !! - WOW !! - I had a shitty experience with this SOB !!
</p>
<p>
The Hospital kept quiet , amazing ,  I noticed of my complaints &#34;Hiding&#34; everything also !!  but reading your experience tells me I made some difference for your dignity being there -- I guess it took an asshole like me to change things and I&#39;m labeled a problem patient now but made things better for others !!

because you don&#39;t go to yeson, the technique they use is very good and more likely to sing with a female range.

Thanks, but I&#39;m not going to Yeson. I live in NY and if there are any complications I can easily see Dr. Haben for follow-up visits. Due to proximity, I can also easily reschedule if I get sick, etc.

Not really but I&#39;m not exactly sure how much of the lower range is lost, or if it&#39;s a case by case deal. Like, are you extremely monotone at the higher range, without the ability to adjust pitch to express yourself? I need to do more research.
