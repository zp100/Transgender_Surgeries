Mine uses two lamps for this case: one for better lightening and the other placed in a direction, so the hair casts a big shadow and is more visibly then... At least she explained it like that.
</p>
<p>
Dying the hair could work as well :)

this is the best answer.Directional light that is shone across the hairs makes them light up like fiber optic christmas

a pinch some have used things like mascara or a pore marker, but in my experience the contrasting dark colours actually make it more difficult to see the follicle.See the video by Mike Bono I posted below.

You might consider using a semi-permanent dye like a henna rinse or an eyebrow safe dye or you can use just for men beard color.
</p>
<p>
Check with your electrologist and use it a few days before your session just to make sure your skin is clear.

My electrologist suggested it for use on my facial hair. I have mostly gray hair.

Probably let the hair grow longer than you are currently.  If you&#39;ve been on HRT for a while, you can probably go as much as two weeks without shaving there, and be fine.
</p>
<p>
You tech should be wearing magnifying glasses though.  We just finished clearing the shaft (for now, at least), and mine in that area can also be pretty light, but she didn&#39;t seem to have issues finding them.
</p>
<p>
If you still have hair in other areas you need to clear for GCS, you could work on those for a couple of weeks and come back to the shaft; it sounds like there alsmot isn&#39;t anything there currently.

there are probably a dozen or so hairs there still, which is why i’m concerned. i’ve been advised to shave 5 days before and have done that for all of my previous sessions. i have 8 days until my next session, so i think i will shave tonight and hopefully the hair will be more visible. it’s just quite sparse, and does not contrast with my skin at all :(

I have two sessions for one hour each week (plus another hour each day for my face), on consecutive days, and shave after the second session.  So I usually have 6 or 7 days of hair growth for a given session.  The hair could definitely be twice as long and my tech would have no issue with finding the follicle angle.  So yeah, I&#39;d go longer between shaves.  If there&#39;s only a dozen hairs there, I&#39;d stop shaving the shaft entirely.

I didn&#39;t shave between sessions.  I was at 4-6 weeks growth.  That makes it easier and shouldn&#39;t be an issue

? I&#39;ve had six different electrolysis clinician and none have ever cared if I shave, let alone charge a fee.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t understand that at all.
