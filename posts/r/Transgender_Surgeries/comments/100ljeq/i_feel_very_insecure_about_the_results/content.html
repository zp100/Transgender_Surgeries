Hi, I¬¥m a 25 yo trans girl who had the surgery 6 months ago at Spain. I feel very insecure about how my pussy is looking and several &#34;issues&#34; idk if they&#39;re normal. My surgeon said that everything looks very good and all the team is really proud about the results but I don&#39;t trust him at all. He has make me a lot of gaslight since the op occurred.
</p>
<p>
First of all, I want to say that im not fully unhappy but I can&#39;t say neither that Im happy with it... So my biggest problems are basically: a) I feel like my clit is too big and unprotected, b) the skin on the down part [marked with blue] feels loose and makes a weird sharped form, and c) idk what tf to do with that &#34;bulge&#34; [marked with red] that makes me super difficult to accomplish the dilatations, feels weird af and as u can see on the photos, when I get hot it gets so fkin big, making even more difficult to introduce anything in my pussy, it really makes me feel dysforic...
</p>
<p>
Pls if u know anything that could help me I would really thank u, Im so lost and don&#39;t know where to go to get help. I have some hope that eventually this problems will solve as the times passes but its just a confort thought that might be very far away from reality.
</p>

Do have link to this twitter account?

<p>
Also, how much did it cost?

Sounds like erectile tissue. You&#39;ll need a revision to fix that.

All the issues you have identified are correct. When you research look for these names
</p>
<ul>
<li>
erectile tissue
</li>
<li>
anterior and posterior commissure
</li>
<li>
perineal raphe
</li>
</ul>

I don&#39;t really know what you should do at this point. The problem is there&#39;s not a lot of information of revisions so its hard to  know who is good. Lots of research would be a good idea. Don&#39;t just trust surgeons because one or two people say they are good. Look in the wiki here.
</p>
<p>
From what you have said, and your results, I&#39;d look elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Revisions are minor compared to the original surgery.

There&#39;s a very detailed post
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fayd3p/srs_with_dr_suporn_pdf_5th_edition/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
where a women had SRS and 3 revisions in Thailand, so you can get an idea of how it compares to the original surgery.

I‚Äôve thought about it but I‚Äôm not sure if it is actually a possibility as u firm the consent paper.. I‚Äôll have an appointment with him this month and see what he has to say about this, he can‚Äôt be still lying anymore. Also I‚Äôm going to start going to psychologist so I‚Äôll have proof about the trauma this has caused me, it may can help if I finally can sue him.

I had a look for his name on here and nothing came up which is a red flag. I&#39;d look at theerapong in Thailand he&#39;s done some amazing revisions.

sorry, didn&#39;t mean to sound rude,  what I meant with the wrong look is considering Reddit community is based on US people (mostly) and Europeans, the popularity tends to be biased where they go. Even Dr. Ma√±ero in Spain has few reviews considering he is based in Spain.

I had a consultation with ma√±ero but i dont feel convinced with him. He quoted me 25 k for colon vaginoplasty so he might be expensive. I dont have reference from others surgeon but maybe it is worthy to you to have an appoitment with him and see how it feels, as well with other surgeons. Maybe you can go to local trans group and get a first hand experience. But yet, having trusty reviews is complicated, i m trying to deal with it aa well

If you‚Äôre going to pay you can go to Thailand where there‚Äôs tons of reviews, and some of the surgeons are good.

Maybe you had a wrong look, most results are in spanish. You can Google &#34;dr cesar fidalgo la plata&#34;, he started doing srs in 1997 in Argentina.  He was one of my shorlisted (i am Argentinean so) but i got a date with dr bank because i prefer non penile technique (which dr cesar fidalgo doesnt perform) I advise to get consultation with your possible surgeons

Please told your surgeon that you are going to sue him or he give your money back for you to get a revision at a better place , I dont want to be rude but neo vagina is not supposed to be constructed like this (even if vaginas can be in plenty of shapes).

Don‚Äôt tell your surgeon that without researching very carefully what will happen next. It can cause more problems

Yes, I‚Äôve contacted a lgtb association and will try to get other surgeon opinions about this, make sure I can confront him with that card

Yeah that is erectile tissue that they left. You‚Äôll probably need a revision to fix that and to construct a clitoral hood. On the good side tho the labia looks amazing and ur scars are pretty unnoticeable

Hi so I just talked with this girl who had the operation with the same surgeon and this is what I‚Äôve diacovered: a) the part I feel loose at the end of the vagina and it‚Äôs form gets corrected as time passes and doing dilatations pushing upwards [the problem obv is that I cannot do that so easily because of the erectil tissue], b) around a year after the operation the clit will reduce and get a more healthy color, and I can add the cap later on in a surgery, they don‚Äôt tend to do it at the mayor op because it may cause more sensibility lose, and c) besides she felt that ‚Äúbulge‚Äù too [the erectil tissue] at the beginning of her recover, it disappeared short after, which leads me to think that they didn‚Äôt removed it well in my case.

Hello again, I have more updates. I‚Äôve talked to the woman who leads the I-Vaginarium proyect which helps trans girls from Spain and America Latina to get their vaginoplasty made on Thailand and she told me next: - It‚Äôs not aceptable what this surgeon has made, but she will help me find a good surgeon on Thailand who can solve this problems like make the labia minora, reposicionate the urethra and remove the erectil tissue, etc for a correct looking and funci√≥n. But it will have to wait until 6-8 months since now so everything ends healing, which honestly is not a big deal for me cause I‚Äôm still recovering mentally from the first one. She told me everything could cost around 8000‚Ç¨ but she will update me with what the surgeons tell her. - About the legal part: she made clear that it is very difficult, they have being trying to sue for 6 years but without any success, primarily cause the abstence of proper judicial experts on vaginoplasty surgeries here in Spain. She‚Äôs gonna pass me the contact of a law firm they worked with in the past. So I will contact them and see if we can do something at all.
</p>

Other surgeons for similar situations‚Ä¶ looks like here in Spain surgeons of vaginoplasty are all alike, I was right when I was afraid that everything I saw online about them was marketing.
