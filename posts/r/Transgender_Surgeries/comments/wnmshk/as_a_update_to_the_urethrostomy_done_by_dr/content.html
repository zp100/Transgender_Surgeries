A urethrostomy is pretty much a urethral reroute to under the scrotum, you must sit to pee after this surgery, ejaculation also comes from this new hole.
</p>
<p>
I got it done as a compromise while I was trying to figure out how to get srs.

How are you feeling about it all now?
</p>
<p>
I got nothing to compare it too, but it looks nicely done, and completely healed.

Yeah Jonathan witten seems to show great promise in the field even though he is new to specifically trans reconstructive surgeries he is well experienced in the rest of the field, I&#39;m excited for him to learn perineal pull through cause he already does a great job with penile inversion alone.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s put it this way, it felt wrong asf for me to be tucked all day with leggings on out as female then randomly pull out a penis to pee standing, I don&#39;t get that feeling anymore which is nice. now I understand &#34;but why not just sit to pee without surgery&#34; that also felt wrong when I knew I was fully capable of just standing to do it, Idk brains are weird.
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s interesting about it is I&#39;m kind of indifferent about it overall, it weirdly feels like a small change and has mostly been a motivator to get full srs faster, not because I don&#39;t like it but rather that I kind of see it as a incomplete project in a way as the vagina being the complete project.
</p>
<p>
With all this being said if i went back in time with the same knowledge I would still get this surgery done either way  and see it as a good compromise so take that as you will :3

I don&#39;t know how I feel about it personally. Before you posted about it, and especially this post, I&#39;d have definitely said not interested, but now I&#39;m starting to see it as a minor surgery without too much commitment as a step along the way. Kind of like how some people micro-dose HRT at the start (very slippery slope in my experience).
</p>
<p>
I assume there&#39;s no effect on fertility?

This is true, it feels interesting, like ejaculation feels like it&#39;s from there instead of the dick. But then again gonna feel good either way, only real difference is now you make a mess in yourself

Take a look at the comment I left hiddenstill, insurance fully covered this but not srs at all, so I compromised on this until I could figure out srs.

this is a procedure i would have never considered until you mentioned insurance coverage.  yeahâ€¦ i could see myself making the sane decision for sure.

As I am slowly figuring things out with who I am, I stumbled across the sub
<a href="/r/salmacian" rel="nofollow">r/salmacian
</a>
for which I now know I identify. I amab mtf salmacian and wish to get a penial-preserving vaginoplasty someday with labia-plasty later as I&#39;ve read they (Doc&#39;s) like to wait a year.
</p>
<p>
My question is, are you still able to get erections still normally?

You should pay special attention to hygiene after stool. You should wipe from front to back. Otherwise you can easily get a urinary infection. Take care.

Not many people for very long once they get a uti

Also a lot of people with penises who just weren&#39;t taught how to wipe

So what&#39;s the point of sealing the penis and peeing from that new hole ? As to having a full bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
I mean don&#39;t you think the penis is less important now ? If so why did you keep it ? Is there a medical purpose ?

It was a compromise surgery to hold me over until full bottom surgery as for right now idek if I&#39;ll ever be able to get it done. Penis functions purely for pleasure now otherwise it&#39;s just there. Insurance issues is the reasoning behind it and I wanted to get something done in the right direction.
