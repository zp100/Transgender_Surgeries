9 days is way to early to judge your results. i had FFS with him in June and feel he did so much more than i thought possible especially on the outer orbitals. i just posted this a couple of days ago and you can clearly see the very pronounced orbital bones on the outside and the thick &#34;V&#34; between my eyes on my before pic, they are now gone and fully smooth
