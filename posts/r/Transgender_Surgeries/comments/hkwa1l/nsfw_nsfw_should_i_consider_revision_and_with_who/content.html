Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner is well known for performing revisions of previous surgeries.  I had an amazing experience with her, I highly recommend looking into her team.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best ðŸ’•

I have noticed some scar tissue forming on the sides of the labia, they&#39;re very wrinkly and still red. I had surgery in early may 2019. I currently have very little sensation in the clitoris. I also feel like the area below the clitoris looks unnatural.
</p>

My surgeon was Keelee Macphee.

You might want to stay with Macphee because she knows what she did, and itâ€™s not a total botch like some folks get.

No, she straight up told me she&#39;s not going to help me anymore. She considered this one of her best results... Idk if she&#39;s bjullshitting me but I have a very low opinion of her now.

I think if you look at her results on her website there&#39;s somethat is just &#34;off&#34;. I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it and gave her the benefit of the doubt. When I went I asked just please make it look like a cis vagina. I really regret going to her. That said, she was nice to me initially but it&#39;s really just customer service in a way. As soon as you have a serious concern she quickly dismisses it, pretends she doesn&#39;t see anything wrong and and starts attacking you... Like she blames the scarring on me not having massaged the area but she didn&#39;t even tell me to massage it until I went to her with that concern months after surgery.

Wow.  If you can go to Thailand, you have good options.  In North America,  Toby Meltzer has the most experience.

I honestly feel kind of defeated. I spend like $9000 in total on this and I will probably have to fork out that much for revision that I cannot even imagine how they could fix it.

Iâ€™m starting to see more and more dissatisfied patients of MacPhee. You are completely right when you say she acts as if what you say is a non-issue and makes you feel like you are crazy. Regardless if itâ€™s a revision or not, itâ€™s more money in her pocket so I donâ€™t understand why she wonâ€™t even consider the concerns of her post-op patients.

If I had to speculate it would be because she actually is very inexperienced and doesn&#39;t know how to fix it and knows she could botch it worse.

As a pre-op trans woman, I actually think that passes as cis pretty nice and I would definitely not mind having a vagina look like that.

I have a similar result, though from a different surgeon and with a much larger and less well hooded clitoris. I&#39;m working towards a revision as well, my main pain points are clitoral hooding and the area below the urethra. The good news, revision is possible for that. How&#39;s your urine stream, downwards or forwards?

As far as I know, that&#39;s usually considered to be a functional issue and grounds for a minor revision.

Idk if you&#39;re being nice, not implying you&#39;re lying. But thank you. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been very insecure about to the point I&#39;ve stopped dating and broke up with my ex bc I was too embarassed to have sex.
