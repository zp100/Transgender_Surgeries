Hi! I just had my vaginoplasty with Dr Raigosa (Spain) and want to ask him questions but my parents are always around:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Will I be able to get double penetration after some time?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Are squirts possible?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Are piercings / tattoos possible / disrecommended in the area? I would like to get a horizontal clitoral hood. My vaginoplasty included hood and labia minora.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Are voluntary contractions in the vagina possible? I understand the pelvic muscles contribute in this?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do the clitoris get erections at some extent?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thanks! ðŸ–¤ Anta (they/she)

So I&#39;m just a month post op so I dont know everything l but ill do my best to help.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Yes!
</li>
<li>
So just like with cis girls its a personal thing, some women can some cant, also the type of surgery matters.
</li>
<li>
I actually don&#39;t know but I dont see why it would be a problem once its all healed
</li>
<li>
Yes! And they&#39;re very useful to practice so you learn how to better control the muscles (relaxing them during dilation makes it 10Ã— easier)
</li>
<li>
For me yes! But idk about everyone I feel like its a personal thing and everyone&#39;s clit is different
</li>
</ol>

Hey Anta!
</p>
<p>
1 yes
</p>
<p>
2 no. I get some clear fluid when I orgasm, but that&#39;s it.
</p>
<p>
3 yes, they&#39;re possible
</p>
<p>
4 you can sort of pull in I guess?
</p>
<p>
5 yes, it throbs when you get aroused.

I cannot answer your questions (I haven&#39;t had GRS yet) but would you mind if I ask how much was it and how long have you waited since your first consultation?

I&#39;m from Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) and the public health system covered it for me. I had to wait for less than a year, but here in Spain every region has different governments with slightly different health systems, which means separate waiting lists. In Catalonia for instance the waiting list is 6+ years, which is quite unfair honestly.

To the first question. I also want this and will now tell my nurse this because I had my vulvoplasty, but because they donâ€™t understand why I want to have a vagina after having gone through my vulvoplasty surgery back in October 2019. I tried to bring this up, but my nurses canâ€™t understand why I still want a vagina and  have a vaginal canal. This is exactly why I still want it. Regardless of if itâ€™s a dilator or double ended dildo itâ€™s better than nothing there. No vaginal hole to stick a dildo in.
</p>
<p>
My only problem with what I did was all because my work place gave a specific limited time off for the surgery in which wasnâ€™t enough time off to get my vaginoplasty done. I needed a total of six weeks off, but that wasnâ€™t given, I only had 41 days of staying at the hotel accommodations I was given which did not leave time to properly heal.

Yes, but proceed with caution.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
No, not likely.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Check with your surgeon, and make sure your piercer is aware of your surgical status. It could effect issues with anatomy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yes, if your pelvic floor allows.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
No, those components are usually removed.

you need to be able to ask your surgeon questions. if your parents being around is a problem, tell them to go wait outside because you have sensitive questions for your surgeon. that is exactly what i will do when i have my surgery. thereâ€™s no shame in it.

I&#39;ll do that when I have the opportunity, I just wanted some input from fellow transfems in the meantime. Also every body is different and variety of answers is appreciated. Doctors don&#39;t know everything if they haven&#39;t got the procedure themselves.
