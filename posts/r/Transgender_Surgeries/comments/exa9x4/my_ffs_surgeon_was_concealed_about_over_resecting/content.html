When we were finalizing my plan we talked about what to do with the back part of my jaw. In earlier consultations one surgeon said not to touch it and another said it was totally optional for me, not needed for passing.
</p>
<p>
I wanted the corners taken in a tad anyway, the surgeon responded that with my thin skin it would look &#34;over resected&#34; and said Katlin Jenner is an example of someone with an over resected jaw from ffs.
</p>
<p>
I cant quite see what he was talking about but Jenner doesnt have many side profile post FFS pictures. I do trust his judgement but want to know more.

Have you ever seen the after photos from the handful of south korean clinics (specifically the ones referred to as &#34;factories&#34; like BK and ID, not ALL south korean clinics) where in the after photo, the person&#39;s jaw has been shaven all the way down to a straight line and the person&#39;s head looks kind of like an almond from the front?
</p>
<p>
I imagine that he was probably trying to avoid giving you a much less extreme version of
<em>
that.
</em>
It doesn&#39;t age well on a lot of people and it doesn&#39;t flatter a lot of face types.
</p>
<p>
Shaving off too much of the mandible angle would likely give you an unnaturally narrow face, not a more feminine one.

Oh, yeah, I completely forgot about the placement of the nerve canal being a factor!! Most surgeons I’ve spoken to will mention it if it’s the specific reason that they won’t do something, so I didn’t even consider it

I&#39;ve not heard of this before. Do you have any references or links?

I don&#39;t have a
<em>
lot
</em>
that&#39;s recent, but here are a couple examples. I used to do translations on a forum where people who wanted to get FFS in Japan/Korea would gather, so I saw a lot of social media posts w/ after photos. Most of what I saw was posted on korean social media. ID hospital in particular was on the blacklist, but I couldn&#39;t say whether or not to avoid them now, at least five years later...
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-11P2V6mFRCU/VIqpr7nqP_I/AAAAAAAADfY/FLwy3m5kpVM/s1600/10181_00.jpg" rel="nofollow">This official image from ID hospital (originally posted in 2014
</a>
) shows the aesthetic that commonly came from them. Very significant mandible reduction (this patient already had a really short chin, but a lot of other people I saw out of the same hospital would have theirs made to be really short and extremely pointed)
</p>
<p>
I found a much more ore recent video by a youtuber who went to ID and got V-line.
<a href="https://youtu.be/IhG1QLWg-bI?t=1451" rel="nofollow">Around this part of the video you can see her turn her head to the side to see what I&#39;m talking about.
</a>
From her chin to her ear, it&#39;s almost a straight line. The mandible angle is just gone. In the turnaround photos at 27 minutes, the swelling has gone down and you can really see how much bone they took off + some sagging(?) in the submental area.

That’s a massive change. I’ll add this post to the wiki.
</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t sagging be something that you could fix with some kind of facelift?
</p>
<p>
What forum was it? I know of purse forums, but nothing else.

Yeah, I imagine the resulting sagging could be treated with some kind of lift, maybe that new treatment they&#39;re doing (idk what it&#39;s called yet) that looks like an ultrasound? Kybella definitely wouldn&#39;t work bc it&#39;s not submental fat, it&#39;s just loose skin...
</p>
<p>
As for the forums I worked with, for opsec reasons I&#39;m not comfortable identifying the site. My info up there is probably gone by now, but I don&#39;t want to risk it.
