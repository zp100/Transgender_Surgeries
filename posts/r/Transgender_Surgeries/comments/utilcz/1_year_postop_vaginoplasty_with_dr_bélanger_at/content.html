This is my 1 year update on my vaginoplasty with Dr. Bélanger at GRS Montreal (Now with higher quality photos than previously). Everything continues to be going well. Only noticeable visual difference from 6 months is my scars have faded more. My depth remains constant and I have full functionality. Still waiting to get a revision to fix my fused labia minora due to the fact that my provincial health insurance still hasn&#39;t gotten around to approving funding for the procedure. I will post an update after I get my revision. Feel free to ask me anything.

Ontario covers revisions if they&#39;re deemed &#39;medically necessary&#39;, but what exactly counts is a bit of a grey area.

Thank you for posting this. I&#39;ve already gotten approval from ontario to go see her im just waiting on montreal to give me a date. I suppose if I could ask a question I&#39;d want to know how it feels physically. Any tugging or tight feeling in your skin when you move your legs. Just if it&#39;s comfortable. Do you have to clean it? I kind of figured I&#39;d have get a douche or something like that to clean it. Also the minor labia, aside from the fusing (im sorry to hear that by the way) I just wanted to ask about it. I personally want to ask them when they do my surgery to make the minor labia a little longer so it sticks out a little. Do you think Dr Bélanger is good at making a minor labia? I find in pretty much all the people that have seen her the minor labia is quite small.

It feels totally natural with no restriction in movement. I often run and cycle, I have had no issues doing those activities. I have not been douching for months now with no issues. My surgery booklet says to douche every day but I think that&#39;s unnecessary and was actually causing issues for myself. I personally like my labia minora, they are smaller but are noticeable with my leg spread out. They give an &#34;innie&#34; look to my vulva that I like. Your request for the labia minora to be longer would be something to ask the surgeon, I&#39;m not sure if they can do that.

Both seem to be good surgeons that consistently give good results. I know plenty of people who have gone to either surgeon who have been happy with their results. I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with either. I personally found Dr. Bélanger to be great and would choose her again if I had to start over.

she looks very pretty, I like the small labia minora. And the clit stimulation works fine? Do you get orgasm? How is this feeling?

Also If I could ask how is the clitoral hood and the clit? Does it cover it properly and move out of the way with your fingers if you want? Also how sensitive is the clit versus penetration? If that&#39;s inappropriate to ask I apologise

Both are great. My clitoral hood covers my clit completely and I can move it out of the way to access the clit. I think I have more sensitivity now in my clit than I did pre-op due to it being protected by the clit hood. I find penetration to be pleasurable but not as intense as getting my clit stimulated. Clit stimulation and penetration at the same time feels really good.
