Had surgery with Joshua Rosenberg at Mount Sinai
</p>
<p>
He’s AMAZING !!! Consult was incredible, he had warmth and grace bs sterile inhuman doctors who see us as cash cows and meet slabs - Gave me so much time and attention. Office staff was otherworldly and so helpful in navigating insurance and pre-approval process ahead of surgery. I could find zero accounts of FFS with him, only individual procedures. The strange thing is after that visit I KNEW he was the one, and leading up to surgery felt ZERO nerves, unlike my mom who was a wreck. On the day of surgery he came into the hospital bed I was waiting in, and made sure to cover and go over all procedures as well as , correct an error where one of the procedures to be performed was not listed. He had a warmth, strength and confidence that let me know I was safe.
</p>
<p>
Flash forward to Mount Sinai New York Eye and Ear Center on 14th street and DAMN those nurses sucked. There were a few sweet baby angels who did their best to manage my discomfort, like when there was no air-conditioning in the room they set up a fan after much looking. They also gave me Ambien, and the experience was so horrible that I continually called my mom and said I was going to come home in an Uber and discharge myself. LMAO I legit asked are you legally holding me or can I leave? Is this a prison or a hospital? So discombobulated that when I looked through the handheld buzzer to get nurses in, I couldn’t find her, and waited 30+ minutes for a nurse to come in. During that time I threw every single drink they’ve given me at the wall and I had to scream. Really really really really really hoping that doesn’t have consequences with my jaw and genioplasty work.
</p>
<p>
First 2 days were brutal. Discomfort was at a peak I’d never experienced. Pain was satanic. Could hardly sleep, never mind function. Jello was my friend. Thankfully on day three I started to feel a major shift. It was the first day that I didn’t take pain meds until the evening, and actually got dolled up. Without the compression bandage I did look like Elvis and his decline, but my beautiful green velvet prom like dress from cider did help make me feel a bit better. with each day I feel less and less discomfort and tension. I did have a moment on day four of freaking out worrying if I fucked up the sutures in my mouth because they really burnt when I did my salt water gargle, and when I ate certain foods. I really should’ve just stuck to liquids exclusively lol.
</p>
<p>
My question now is, based off pics do you see a good trajectory ??? I’m actually not feeling dysphoric at all, only anxiously awaiting the (closer to) final result in a few weeks. Tomorrow they remove the bandages. I seem to be healing quickly by all accounts. Under eye bruises (only spot I bruised) were all but gone on day 4 or 5.
</p>
<p>
I do have a few concerns / questions I’d liked addressed … is the difference in eyelid side / creasing due to swelling ??? Do my brows look feminized or rather, how do those change with continued resolution of swelling ??? Will hairline come forward as swelling resolves ??? Feeling pain in one side of jaw, around the masseter muscle, where I’d previously done botox for teeth grinding.
</p>
<p>
Also, AM I WEARING THIS F*CKING COMPRESSION BANDAGE RIGHT ??? As stupid as it sounds I keep worrying I’m wearing it wrong / it’s gonna mess up final result. How funny is it that that’s been the most consistent anxiety.
</p>
<p>
Girlies, PLEASE SEND ME CHAT REQUEST IF YOU GOT FFS … I need a lil chit chat to cure the boredom.
</p>
<p>
Much love,
</p>
<p>

You look great! I&#39;m considering going to him also. Thanks for the great overview of your procedure. What did you have done? Cheek work? Hairline reduction?
</p>
<p>
Out of curiosity, how long did you wait from your consult to your surgery?
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much! Keep healing!

About 4 months from consult to surgery … love Rosenberg, cannot recommend highly enough … office staff is out of this world … he really pays attention to what you want, and takes a more conservative approach … I appreciate that he rejected two things I was considering which would have been totally unnecessary

That is awesome!!! I feel you sold me on Dr. Rosenberg! He was in my top 3 choices, but you just made him number one! You look so good! Hopefully he can do the same for me!
</p>
<p>
Thank you so very much!!!
</p>
<p>
Can&#39;t wait to see how you look after all your healing!

You are not allowed to pluck or wax your eyebrows before hairline lowering cause it usually involves an eyebrow lift, and the doctor needs to know the natural position of the brow in order to make them even.

Mount sinai is amazing. Just had a vaginoplasty revision there. They truly are the leaders in trans healthcare of the north east U.S., and that’s just a small fraction of what they do.

Who’d you go with ??? CTMS is def a challenge to deal with, but I feel it’s a good challenge in that it proves persistence and seriousness … the actual medical team is outstanding and so sweet … going with the head of urology, Dr. Purohit for my surgery ◡̈

I did a consult with Dr. Purohit but chose Bella Avanessian instead. They are both excellent surgeons but I preferred the aesthetics and consistency of Dr. Avanessian’s work. She is truly the best imo.

I’m having a consultation with him in October. Leaning toward him because his office said he performs FFS in a single surgery rather than spreading it out in stages. Do you have any updated before/after photos you’d be willing to share? Did he show you photos at your consult?
