It&#39;s been more of a time sink than anything else. Tbh it&#39;s pretty easy just a bit inconvenient as it eats into my day. I had to dilate 3x daily up to the 3 month mark but now I&#39;m down to two which is much easier. Some girls have had to use pain killers to help with dilation for quite some time after surgery. I stopped with pain killers while I was still in hospital. For some reason I&#39;ve healed up super fast.

I&#39;ve not had a PIV sex yet, and as I have a long term girlfriend I may never. However my vagina seems to be very moist, and when I orgasm I&#39;m very wet down there 🙂

Do you have any ideas why a canal made from scrotal skin-graft could feel moist? Ive come across this phenomenon in another girl&#39;s post and very interested in finding out why

It’s called metaplasia! Pretty much tissue can change its properties when it’s exposed to different environments. In this case the scrotal tissue was exposed to an environment that mucous tissue is normally exposed to, so it transformed to better fit that environment

I never thought of this, I am so euphoric rn that things could get wet down there for me too after surgery TwT I am planning on trying probiotics and lactic acid stuffs that I was told could help get a cis-like environment down there!

I eat probiotic yoghurt. I believe that it may help although I can&#39;t confirm as I&#39;ve always eaten it.

In my understanding skin changes depending on its environment. When skin is not exposed to the outside it retains moisture and can secrete. Also although its scrotal skin, it&#39;s the moist inside internal layer that&#39;s used to line the canal, not the outer follicular bearing layer.

You mean, then use the skin up side down to creat the canal?like the red internal part?

Yes, they use the inner layer of the scrotal skin. It&#39;s very similar to vaginal skin and is naturally moist.

No, it was instant. I never expected it to be so quick but I guess that when your body finally matches your brain everything just feels natural instantaneously 🥰

It was very fast for the first few weeks post surgery, but then it got more difficult from months 2 to 3. It could take up to two hours 3x daily. But since Month 3 it has become easy again as I&#39;m pretty much fully healed. So now its 60 mins twice a day. At 6 months I drop to 1x daily 🥰x

I went with my partner, but there were lots of girls who went on their own. I found the whole experience amazing. The level of efficiency, professionalism and friendly interaction with the clinic staff was excellent. The Samitivej hospital where the surgery takes place was just first class.
</p>
<p>
In part I enjoyed Thailand more than most because of my really quick healing time. Within a couple of weeks I was cuddling tigers, firing Glocks and much more. PM if you want some of my Thailand photos 🙂x

How hard was it getting an appointment? I move to Bangkok for retirement next month and will be using Bank/Suporn. Worried it will take forever to get in.

I originally booked in with Dr Suporn back in 2021, but when he became ill and retired Dr Bank took over my date. So it was maybe a year between first contact and surgery. Now that its only one surgeon the wait is a little longer. Best to email the Suporn clinic for more info.

Never heard of it, but I’d check if they have a separate schedule for people living there. Maybe they get cancellations they can’t fill and you could get in if you’re able to go on very short notice.
</p>
<p>
There’s lots of posts about how to apply the normal way. It’s a challenge.

One of the things that helped me get a timely date was getting a rapport going with the Suporn clinic admin staff and staying in regular contact. That and being super nice. Thai people appreciate that 🙂x

I&#39;m pulling my labia apart and upwards to show the vaginal entrance and clitoris. Looking at it again I&#39;m maybe pinching the labia together above the entrance. Nothing odd about it apart from the angle maybe?

I&#39;ve pretty much settled on bank as the surgeon I want and based on your results that decision is further reinforced because you look amazing, especially for just 3 months! I am always curious about the admin side though, I know he&#39;s extremely in demand so how difficult did you find getting booker with him to be? How many tried did it take you/any tips for securing him more easily? Thanks 😁

Thankyou, I could not be happier with my result 🥰
</p>
<p>
One of the things that helped me get a timely date was getting a rapport going with the Suporn clinic admin staff and staying in regular contact. That and being super nice. Thai people appreciate that 🙂
</p>
<p>
You may be looking at 2024 for a date though. Definitely do apply via email asap if you want to go ahead x

Happy to hear that 😁

I&#39;m expecting that anyway. I&#39;ve got a consult for ffs next month so 2023 will be face and admin for bottom and hopefully I can get a bank date for &#39;24.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it 😊

You&#39;re welcome 🙂 Can I ask who you are considering for FFS? I&#39;m considering Jumaily. It seems to be the case that most girls have FFS before SRS. Its the other way round for me I guess...lol x

Nikhil Maini in Brighton, UK. There aren&#39;t many results online but he seems to be the most qualified and also the best value for money surgeon I can find. I had a consultation with facialteam in Spain too a few months back but they were much more expensive for less treatments so I decided against them.
</p>
<p>
I think it just depends what gives you greater discomfort. My face dysphoria is worse than my bottom but my girlfriend is looking at doing srs first before ffs too. It&#39;s not that uncommon, don&#39;t worry, lol.

Yeah, facial team have very consistent results but they seem to be a little too Conservative in what they offer compared to others for the same price.

Here&#39;s Maini&#39;s website -

As a facialteam girl they did an amazing job on me. Get so so many compliments with how good I look though I do completely get what you mean by being slightly too conservative. Wish they shaved my jaw slightly more but they said apparently they’d hit nerves if I did so

Oh I&#39;m sorry if have misscommunicated that somehow - I honestly do not mind their approach at all, and if money weren&#39;t a question i&#39;d definitely consider them - it was more what they were charging for the procedures - basically what they charged just for chin/jaw would be like 3-5 different procedures with most other surgeons i consultet
</p>
<p>
but much more importantly: congrats! &lt;3 &amp; so happy to hear you got the FFS you wanted! &lt;3

Did you do any hair removal before surgery?

They remove the follicular outer layer of skin during surgery so you don&#39;t really need to have hair removal on the scrotal area, but I did anyway just to be sure. They do recommend hair removal of the penelium area though as that&#39;s going to be the vaginal opening. So yeah I did both just to be on the safe side 🙂
