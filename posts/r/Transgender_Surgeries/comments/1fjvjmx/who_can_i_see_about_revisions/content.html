Yeah I hate this word when it comes to trans surgeries but this is mutilation short and sweet. Are you even able to be intimate? Like did this surgery improve your life in any way?
</p>
<p>
I suggest just messaging surgeons and asking around

I can still orgasm if I masturbate but I can&#39;t have sex with it. when I took that picture with the dilator it hurt like crazy and I bled a little. I only got it so I didn&#39;t always have to do anal and I can&#39;t do PiV so nah it hasn&#39;t really improved my life, it&#39;s actually really fucked it up when you consider the amount of pain and how much I want to 41% myself every time I see it.

Don&#39;t ! Your surgery can be corrected. I recommend Dr. Bluebond-Langner. She did mine and visually it looks nice, I can&#39;t promise she will be able to fix your depht sitaution because I to lost a ton of depth and can now barely get to the second dot on the dilator. It is also uncomfortable to have sex and does not feel good. I have pics. DM me if you would like to see and I can help you in anyway. Also if you need to talk. I would also suggest seeing a therapist or finding someone you could talk to honestly who has empathy and understands your sitaution, especially if your feeling the way you said you are in your comment.

Hi ok as long as you were just exaggerating to express how upset you feel. Trust me this is fixable, all though unfortunate because these surgeries are invasive, and traumatizing to mind and body. The good thing is you have plenty of skin to still use and that is better then not having enough. Just try to think in terms of this all being temporary and soon to be corrected. Please keep us posted. ðŸ«‚

During revisions you can get additional peritoneal added to increase depth, not everyone will do it and chances are it wont be listed on their site so just ask the surgeon during the consultation if you want that. The peritoneum also regenerates extremely quickly so if you do have problems with depth again you can add depth later but its a whole new recovery each time and it increases risk of peritoneal cancer after each time id like to add that its a very very minuet increase but it is there

I see. I think itâ€™s penile inversion and PPT (peritoneal pull through) combined. Worrying to hear youâ€™ve had issues with depth, most people claim the PPT helps prevent that.

Hi I didn&#39;t have PPT . I had penile inversion with peritoneal graft. They went through my belly button to remove peritoneal tissue to use to create a graft to use to lengthen canal.i think PPT is a different procedure.

Thatâ€™s quite literally PPT. The penile inversion is always part of it. By not doing a full peritoneal graft it prevents over-wetness.

I&#39;ve had a couple of friends go through Reminini. For the most part, their results were okay, but a couple of things I was either told by them or noticed first-hand:
</p>
<p>
Neither of them had to do any kind of laser hair removal or electrolysis before the surgery, because &#34;the follicles get scraped away anyway&#34;. They both have a missed hair or two in their vagina and need to have that addressed.
</p>
<p>
Both of their urethras gradually drifted south, to the point where they mentioned that people often mistake it for their vagina. One of the friends gave up on her PT after a while, so I suspected it had something to do with thatâ€”but the other was very good about it, so it sounds like a problem with the surgery and not PT.

Right I&#39;m not going to discredit the OP if that&#39;s truly the person they went to, but based on my personal results and the results of other people that went to him; this is far off from his usual.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve got my gripes about my coochie, but as far as appearances are concerned. None. It&#39;s aesthetically pleasing.  My issues are literally.
</p>
<p>
-Depth
</p>
<p>
-According to Del Coral during my consult, skin healed over my clit (likely due to the fact that Dr. R doesn&#39;t do clit hoods at the time of vaginoplasty)
</p>
<p>
I meannnnn that&#39;s about it for me personally.

I&#39;ve thought about this a lot since my response. And my guess is it was a really bad tissue fusion situation, which isn&#39;t entirely on the surgeon. Though I know a lot of people that don&#39;t have a labia minora (myself included) because of possible fusing. Like at the very bottom i can feel where the tissue wants to go in to different directions but up top it&#39;s mono.
</p>
<p>
Ramineni didn&#39;t even make me a hood when I went in for my revision...and it was on the list!
</p>
<p>
I appreciate the man, he set me down on a path that will lead to where I need to be but damn I&#39;m so frustrated with him.
</p>
<p>
He reduced only the left side of my majora (both needed reduced)  Labiaplasty where are you?, cause there is litterally no difference. There was like some stitching kinda but nothing that would lead to a hood (also didn&#39;t infuse my clit) And he was pose to cuterize the granulation tissue and left that.
</p>
<p>
He did fix the depth though. So I can atleast use it.  But right now I&#39;m eyeing a 2nd revision here in Chicago...to do what was supposed to be done last time.
</p>
<p>
I feel better about things, but a 3rd surgery should have been about tweaks not this.
</p>
<p>
I am far outside most surgeons scope so atleast having him do what he did does allow me to have external corrections as that&#39;s less scary for surgeons but I&#39;ll be around 2yrs of healing when I can get in for the 3rd procedure which is a long time. Surgeon wants me to lose some weight, if I lose enough (as much as I dislike this) I may just swap for a sigmoid

Dr Hyer is one of the 2 surgeons in Colorado. Iâ€™ve heard mixed things about her. I got mine with the other Colorado surgeon - Dr Kaoutzanis and had a great outcome

I&#39;ve heard good things about Dr. Kaoutzanis.  The only other surgeon I know of is Hyer. She butchered one of my friends and seems to have consistent results like it.

I hated living in Spokane Washington ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£. I call it Ala-Washington ðŸ¤£. It&#39;s Alabama but freezing cold and always raining. I guess there&#39;s one good thing about that place after all then, and that&#39;s Dr Stiller. I&#39;ll look them up!

I don&#39;t think I can deal with that tbh. I&#39;m not a strong enough person to come forward with this one and attach my face to this fucking horror show for a courtroom full of people. this would be too much shame for me I think.

Someone in the USA who tried said, as far as I recall, itâ€™s  because thereâ€™s no medical standard to measure against for this kind of surgery. No professional bodies either. Seems ridiculous, but no one has won and thereâ€™s far worse cases than this.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™ve not looked, but Iâ€™m  sure thereâ€™s plenty of winning cases for other types of surgery.

Yes SOL expired but you can still file a malpractice claim through the Medical Board.  That in itself is headache enough for him to rethink his ways.  If youâ€™re successful, he can get suspended or his license revoked.  Anonymity can be preserved.   I get youâ€™re not strong but imagine if this happened to your sister and you couldâ€™ve avoided itâ€¦.

Wish it was otherwise, but you have it right about it being too late to file a claim. In Washington DC, the statute of limitations for medical malpractice lawsuits is three years from the time of malpractice injury. You deserve justice on this anyway. But I totally understand your need to just move on and focus on healing.  May your healing be speedy and everything you want.  Hugs.

Dr Theerapong has been getting good reviews for this in recent years.

Would you mind naming your surgeon?

That is wild, what happened post surgery? Iâ€™ve seen him get some really really good results. I had him as my surgeon and Iâ€™m happy with the results I have. I hope you find someone to help you soon.

I dunno. I had the initial surgery in the fall of 2018, that was a total disaster, then a revision (if you can call it that) in spring 2019 and that&#39;s what you&#39;re seeing now.

What do you mean you donâ€™t know? I have a hard time wrapping my head around your assertion that you left the OR with it in this state. It looks like wherever the vestibule is anchored, it broke loose and fell down/out. Can you tell us more?

I had pieces come unattached, he never made any proper labia, I have no visible clit, there&#39;s way too much erectile tissue left so if I get horny it just becomes this amorphous puffy mass, basically the whole thing is a disaster. I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m doing a bad job explaining things, I was really doped up at the time obvi and I never went back to him after

That is terrible and I&#39;m sorry you had to go thru it. No doubt with the tissue left, whoever does the revision will have plenty to work with and craft a suitable result!

I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t use the app. But you can log into reddit via the website. Or use a computer.

I looked closely at it over and over again, I still don&#39;t compute what he actually tried to do. Looks like he didn&#39;t have had much time, or he just hates transpersons or it was his last day.

Understood. From what I understand, revision is one of Littleton&#39;s specialties and his aesthetics are great, both as the initial surgery and when revising. Well known and sought after in Brazil; he also operates in Portugal and I think sometimes Milan. I&#39;ve also heard fantastic things about his function.

Iâ€™d make sure you pick someone with as many reviews as possible, especially of revisions, and with a low rate of complaints. Itâ€™s harder at this point.

Just to say, there are a few sites online that have a gallery of cis vulvas so you can see the range of different shapes/textures/sizes ect of things that vulvas can have so you can compare more accurately if you&#39;re interested in that.

I think that you should consider a consultation with Dr. Meltzer. Here is my reasoning:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
he has done more surgeries than anyone else in the US and has been doing them for longer than anyone else
</li>
<li>
he does many revisions and revision consultations
</li>
<li>
he has quite literally seen it all before, no matter what it is
</li>
<li>
if he believes that he is not the best person to revise your surgery (due to his technique or any other reason), he will have no problem telling you and will know who the best person is. He&#39;s not hurting for patients and knows very well what he does and who it works for.
</li>
<li>
he&#39;s covered by most insurances and wait times aren&#39;t too bad.
</li>
<li>
if he does do your revision his results are very consistent and methodically done. He won&#39;t attempt it if he isn&#39;t confident about the outcome he can achieve.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In short, what you need is someone safe, consistent, and experienced in order to deal with this. In the US, Meltzer would seem to be the best choice for that.
</p>
<p>
And, best of luck to you. I&#39;m so sorry you are dealing with this. My partner had major complications and it is a heart rending journey to go through.

I, too, am sorry youâ€™ve had to go through this. And so young. I firmly believe that plastic surgeons should not be doing these cases alone. There should always be a reconstructive urologist involved. Their training is much more specific to the pelvis and the plumbing involved there. Their training in nerves is specific to that area also. I donâ€™t know where you live but Dr. Mcclung in Columbus Ohio could fix this for you. After 20 years of college he got his start at Ohio State University as a reconstructive urologist and then started correcting other peoplesâ€™ botched bottom surgeries. Now he has his own practice in Columbus performing bottom surgery. He has never had a patient who could not achieve orgasm after surgery. He is widely published in his field. And heâ€™s so nice.

That is criminal... seriously, there needs to be a system in place to prosecute given results like this.. no excuse... I understand complications can happen, that&#39;s the nature of all surgeries.. but this is pure negligence and lack of skill.

With that said, I&#39;m very happy with my results from Dr. O&#39;Brien-Coon and Dr. Boysen at MGH Brigham in Boston, MA. I don&#39;t think the problem&#39;s that your surgeon&#39;s an American: the problem is that he shouldn&#39;t have been allowed to operate on a small laceration, let alone a complex surgery like this.

Love love love Dr Boysen and Dr Coon. Iâ€™m FTM, Iâ€™ve been a patient of theirs for almost 2 years now undergoing complex revision / repair work after my original surgery at Mass General. I know many other folks that are also working with them for complex revision work that other surgeons are not skilled enough to tackle.

Must appreciate your strength and positivity in the middle of all these. Sometimes during difficult times we all need that hope and positivity to guide. From my experience and analysis(not others experience or somewhere I read ) I would suggest as you selected Dr Thee and Amani for the first line of consultation and see how you can take it forward! Again sorry to hear you have to go through all these ! I think you found the right choice already to get this sorted. Sigmoid might be the choice.

So very very sorry this happened to you.  I had a good result from him, but yours is definitely botched  Look really hard at people who do revision surgery.  The Thai surgeon&#39;s like those listed above have a wealth of experience which you need.  Best wishes to you.

this is why we need to stop rushing onto get bottom surgery without researching surgeons Iâ€™d look at a surgeon that performs laproscopic intestinal. I have it and itâ€™s a good surgery with dr Miro or peritoneal with Dr pang in SF aesthetically dr pang is a great option fortunately you have a lot of skin. Dr Miro is great at removing erectile tissue you could even consider both.

My first surgery he wasnâ€™t as busy. Second one for a minor revision was a few months. Assuming your canal is fine, it honestly wouldnâ€™t be too bad.

If Thailand isnâ€™t an option, thereâ€™s Dr. Kuylhee Kim in Seoul South Korea. She started the LGBTQ+ center there.
<a href="https://en.kdh.or.kr/sub203_1.php?bid=112203" rel="nofollow">LGBTQ+ Center
</a>
But it would be hard to find reviews about her since she treats predominantly the Korean population. Sheâ€™s a board certified plastic surgeon, micro surgeon, and WPATH certified. Sheâ€™s been doing bottom surgery for the past few years. Feel free to message me if youâ€™d like more information.

Dr. Ley (San Francisco) does labiaplasty on patients from other surgeons. I just had a consult with her and was told she has availability as on mid May this year.

<p>
Dr. McGinn (eastern Pennsylvania) also does labiaplasty on patients from other surgeons. I didn&#39;t do a full consult with her, but when I talked to her office they said her wait list was pretty short because she doesn&#39;t do in-network insurance.

Sister. Iâ€™m so sorry this happened to you. Dr Burin or theerapong will definitely help you out. You have nice amount of skin there , lots to work with. They will make it beautiful for you. While there opt for the sigmoid revision   Youâ€™ll have depth and be self lubricating . You have lots to work with and I think your final revision will be beautiful.  Please keep us posted with who you chose and hopefully your post op photos. To add to all of it , the bedside manner in Thailand is exceptional. You will feelike the queen you are and also the energy both spiritual and emotional in Thailand is so beautiful. I know your experience will be fantastic

Iâ€˜m sorry that you had to go thru this /: donâ€˜t know if itâ€˜s any helpful, but to me it seems like you have enough tissue around the vulva to be deepening your canal in the revision. The puffiness can be fixed by removing the erectile tissue. I whish you the best surgeon! You got this, try to remember that this is not a lost case &amp; deserve the best!

This is wild bc I went to Ramineni in 2021 and had a much better result. I can see some similarities, like the clit looks similar just not as long, but it really is wild that there can be so much variation in results. I&#39;m so sorry this happened. Was there any clarification? It looks like he just didn&#39;t even try to give you labia.

Theerapong did my surgery (original, no revision) and I think he would do well to fix you up. I can&#39;t be certain what he can do, but just trust him with the process and he will make the best possible that he can with what&#39;s available. I&#39;m sorry you had to go through such a rough experience and wish you the best to get the results you deserve!

There is a dr in India that does what&#39;s called ppv vaginoplasty. Peritaneum pull through method. I recommend looking into that option if heals correctly would have full depth and after first year no dilation needed.

Donâ€™t blame yourself, please. This is not your fault, you did the best you could in that moment. Surgeons in Bangkok use to operate a lot and transgender women is more accepted. This is why whey work better for this surgery. Prior to operate again, please ask to see pictures and if possible meet real patients. ðŸ«¶

I was 18 and stupid. my parents have a pretty racist image of Thailand and basically think it&#39;s all just skeevy ladyboys and sex tourists and stuff so they didn&#39;t want me to go there and I didn&#39;t do enough research about American stuff.

Donâ€™t be kicking yourself. Having SRS in your home country was a good decision, but the doctor let you down. For example I had my SRS in Thailand and I got the worst result imaginable. Itâ€™s really luck of the draw

With that thinking youâ€™ll end up in trouble again. You should be very careful choosing your surgeon, and countries  are not surgeons. You went to a surgeon with a lot of complaints. Thatâ€™s not luck.

Id suggest Marci Bowers. She does quite a few revision surgeries, and can definitely create a normal looking labia for you. TBH, id like to think that one revision would be sufficient, but it could take two.

There are many American surgeons that are good. I&#39;m sure there are Thai surgeons that are bad, we probably don&#39;t hear about them. I really don&#39;t buy into this idea that Thai surgeons are objectively superior.
