He is 66. He was well known in the early 2000s. I&#39;ve seen posts b4 about him with comments like... oh him.. he was big once now he&#39;s not heard of.  Well guess what ladies? He&#39;s still here and he&#39;s perfected his wizardry

If I remember correctly, him, Suporn and Chett all trained under Preecja and developed a similar style that does not use the penis for the canal.

Omg no.  The penis is used to create the outside parts of the vulva.  There is an Indonesian surgeon studying under him.  She also spent time at the Suporn Clinic. She talked to my friend while i was recovering from my 1st surgery.  She said shev hasn&#39;t seen anyone better.  He has developed his own technique whereby he can use a small intestinal graftb to line the vaginal canal. This is jejunal not colon. And totally hair free.  I have been dilating 8 days now. I wear period pants that last the whole day for the mild light discharge thay i will get in the first 3 or 4 weeks. It has absolutely no bad odour. If anything it might be slightly sweet.  I&#39;m so incredibly astoundingly happy. He is also a magician with BA surgery. Itrustedb him completely and now o have a beautiful vagina for the rest of my life.  No pain. No pain meds

I think that is what I said?  All three use the penile tissue for the labia, etc.   They differ in approaches to the canal.

I know right? I was so fortunate to find this place.  I didn&#39;t get here by good research.  I got here by others who had been here and shown me their results. Dr Sanguan is a magician.  That&#39;s how i feel. And most can&#39;t understand how I&#39;m walking 3 days after the last op (compulsory bed rest for 3 days) and with absolutely zero psin meds. Not all GRS is equal. This is for the rest of your life.  I know people 6 months on who went to other places.  Dilation rules their life. They&#39;re still in pain.  Have bloating and achey stomachs.  I dilate 3 times a day.  And it takes about 20 to 25 minutes including wash up time I will live the rest of my days with the utmost gratitude for this man and this plastic surgery institute and the nursing team. üôè

He originally told me i might need to come back for revision for labiaplasty.  After surgery at a bedside consultation he asked me to close my legs.  Him and another surgeon broke into a huge smile and said..i don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need to come back m i was so happy.  But wait right... you&#39;re saying a positive thing?

This is really 9 days? Wow usually your vagina would be swollen and red after srs, but yours looks great! I was thinking about going to Dr. Bank at suporn clinic, would you say he is better than Bank in terms of aesthetics?  Your results are cute! Do you have pictures of other post op girls? If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, I would like to see more of his work.

Hi sister.  Ok......i hear Suporn is good.  Very good. But i can only tell you this.... there is a beautiful Malaysian surgeon who is currently studying under Dr Sanguan so that she can take back skills to her Christian hospital. She has sutiedb under other surgeons, including at the Suporn clinic She was talking to my friend for an hour.  They both exchanged tears and stories. But .....she said.... she has never seen anyone better than Dr Sanguan and also considers him the best BA surgeon in the world. I can&#39;t disparage anyone else.  But i can tell you he worked a miracle for me.  Notb only that.. after the 3 day enforced bed rest after the finsl surgery... he will come in...remove the packing.. and check your healing and your depth and you will begin the day after with your dilations. From after the surgery.... you may be in some discomfort but absolutely not pain. We were walking around.. easily. No pain meds. No pain. Only thing i took once was a paracetamol for a head ache. I&#39;m day 10 now and I&#39;m healing incredibly well.
<br>
If you can choose. Choose PPSI. The nursing team are wonderful. I have a space for them in my heart now forever

It wasn&#39;t that at all. Fact is u had 3 days sick flat out and she had a spare afternoon. Nothing to do with u personally just timing. Had u been well and me sick I&#39;m sure she would of spent entire afternoon with you.

You get a good food allowance there so shouldn&#39;t spend money on food while there. I&#39;m actually crying so much right now because i can&#39;t believe how much i wanted to die before,, and now.. how much i want to live.

The only catch for me? So many tears. The nurses are amazing. I have a space for them in my heart now always.  I got a hug from my Surgeon when i told him he had saved my life. I get to walk every day now with such an amazing body.  And i hear stories of others who are in constant pain and feel their lifesc are over.  I feel nothing but serenity and peace and gratitude and love.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m walking around exploring Phuket by day and night and snoozing during day.  Still recovering after all.  And i get through a whole day easily on one pair of modibodi period panties.

<p>
I could not be happier

Thank you so much! I requested a consultation with him. It just sounds unreal, like nothing close to what I&#39;ve heard and seen from any other GRS surgeon in the world.

Oh my gosh, I&#39;m so happy to hear that. He&#39;s 66 and won&#39;t be around forever but he has used these years of his to masterc what he does. I used to think GRS was just standard everywhere.  It&#39;s most very definitely not true.  Dr Sanguan will not send you home with complications.  His dedication and skill and especially his own techniques.. and his caring.. he will not do what he thinks will not work well for you.  I&#39;m 11 days post surgery and this might sound like I&#39;m a little slow.  But I&#39;m healing and not wanted to play around too much.  Some places are so super sensitive.....m which bodes well for the future .. but last night i stood and looked down.  I placed fingers from each hand on each side of my vulva and gently pulled apart and honestly.... it&#39;s like a flower opening.. one layer openingv to reveal another beneath. I was totally like...oh  my..gosh. i can&#39;t believe how happy i am Good luck on consult.  I know he&#39;s going on leave soon... he hasn&#39;t had a break in over a year.  He&#39;s such a lovely man. üíï
