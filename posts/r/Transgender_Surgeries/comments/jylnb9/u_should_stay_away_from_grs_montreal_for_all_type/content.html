Hi,
</p>
<p>
Consistant issues are being reported from people going to Montreal. From bad FFS to poor SRS result.
</p>
<p>
My SRS was done in 1 hour 36minutes. The results are less than pleasing have totally. Bleeding, poor sensations other than clitoris region. Constant irritation from the amount of skin.
</p>
<p>
All of this was obvious from the beginning. I was the only that did not see Dr.Brassard in the room prior to the surgery. Even if the report says he was there.  The medical staff was there plus a women surgeon which was not Maude. They claim Brassard did the surgery. Brassard came to see me prior to the surgery 5 min ( in the little room)still wearing a suit. He had just finished his previous surgery. So he put on his complete suit to come say hi....
</p>
<p>
I will loose all I have for posting these pics. I have been warned by their legal team. They do not want me to speak up.
</p>
<p>
So at least be respectful enough to acknowledge that I have the courage to stand up to an establishment who has been preventing trans girl of seeing results for years and have been responsible of huge number of post traumatic stress and ..... more sad end result for some of us.
</p>
<p>
People have been asking for pics.
</p>
<p>
I know some of you might have good results. Good for you.
</p>
<p>
But this is what I am stuck with. Trusting a place who has also carte blanche to do whatever they want with no controls and no reporting to any health authorities.

I agree that we always deserve better.
</p>
<p>
I too went to Grs Montreal and I had some beautiful results. I chose my surgeon (Dre Maud Belanger) and she delivered. I don’t regret one moment choosing grs Montreal. Great surgeon, amazing post op care, great results.
</p>
<p>
I don’t want to seem insensitive but you don’t give any detail on what exactly went wrong. It seems you are bashing the clinic for no reason. I find it dangerous to spread this kind of message.
</p>
<p>
About ffs, I didn’t chose Ben Simon since I haven’t been impressed by their before/after pics neither with the way the handled the consultation. It wasn’t as professional as facial team which I ended up choosing for my upcoming ffs.
</p>
<p>
Be careful when you are saying this kind of things without giving at least some details. Right now you look like a troll or an angry competitor.

Hum,
</p>
<p>
My reviews will be on realself and I will posting pics of the results of the vaginas at the cost of my career and my life for exposing this place. I’m originally from Quebec and before telling people they are a troll. I return the favour.before saying you are satisfied without showing pictures maybe you should be careful about what you are saying.
</p>
<p>
I am writing this to prevent people to suffer as it happened in the past.
</p>
<p>
I think about or end up committing suicide because they trusted someone who totally disrespected them.
</p>
<p>
I am simply starting what I want to be a movement for better access  and better quality care for trans people.
</p>
<p>
My SRS was done in 1 hour 36 minutes and my facial feminization in 3 hours 07 minutes.
</p>
<p>
My eyes are not closing properly, my eye brows were not raised, my forehead was poorly done, my nose job was poorly done. I need hardware installed to fix my chin which is half an inch lower. This has obviously pull my face down. Therefore un-feminizing me. My hairline was pull back.
</p>
<p>
The cost for revision is 36k and this doesn’t include a skin graft for eyelid if it’s possible. And because of that maybe I won’t ever have my eyebrows raised even if I paid for it.  It has destroyed my life and like I said I almost killed myself and maybe will one day.  I also have emails proving that they lied about my surgery time at first bumping it up half an hour. Until I was able to get the actual operating time from the medical Center.
</p>
<p>
As for the vagina.  Well a SRS in 1:36 minutes. Compare to surgeons that does one in 4-5-6-7 hours. You get the McDonald’s version. Still bleed, poor sensation, irritation all the time, cant walk long distance because of all the irritations. Disgusting look. I will never go with a guy because  of that.
</p>
<p>
1 of my friend has no labia minora at all. And the other no sensation at all.
</p>
<p>
Good enough?:)

I will only talk about SRS since this is the only procedure I had done with grs Montreal. Like I said, regarding dr Bensimon. I didn’t trust him enough to go ahead.
</p>
<p>
Now, regarding srs, and your post, I am sorry you had a very bad experience. But talking about the length of the procedure, it is known that the procedure is very quick. It is a penile inversion done in one procedure. It goes with its pros and cons (like all procedures btw). I went to the wiki before my consultation and I was hesitant to go with grs mtl knowing the technic inherent limitations. But then everything was explained during the consultation, the surgeon showed me pictures and I was satisfied with what I saw and I decided to go ahead. Now, I am almost 6 months post op and I don’t regret anything. My gf find my new vulva very cis like and everything works as intended. Again... I might have been lucky but it is my reality.
</p>
<p>
I don’t need you to post pics of your vag, or anything. Internet is so full of trolls that it isn’t easy to know who to trust. When I looked at your comment history, you only had 2 posts and it was to trash talk grs Montreal with no concrete detail.
</p>
<p>
The issue here is that we seem to have 2 different valid experiences. And mine is not less valid than yours. Talking about friends, I also kept contact with the woman whom I shared my hospital room and she is also very happy (we shared pictures in the first months and It also already looked great). Again we didn’t go with Brassard but with Dre Belanger, it may be the explanation.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I am deeply sorry about what happened to you. Being a trans woman, is already hard by itself and dysphoria is a bitch. If you add bad results after srs and ffs, I can only imagine the distress you can be in. I hope you can talk to someone other than faceless people in the internet and I hope you can make your case with the surgeons for revisions. Take care

Well I just started commenting so since it’s my first subject and It had huge negative impact on my life. It hard to have a track record of positive reviews wouldn’t you say?
</p>
<p>
Oh I do have a revision at 36k for my face and will never be able to properly close my eyes. So with time my vision will only get worst. I already cannot get I to sunlight for more than 5 minutes without intense burning pain. And I have now dry line from across my cornea. Not sure what my life will be in 5-10-20 years.
</p>
<p>
As for the bottom. If my health because of how all of that has affected me. If and when I get it fixed it will definitely not be in Montreal.

Hey friend. so sorry to hear of this. I am a victim as well. Down with montreal, we need caring qualified professionals who won&#39;t cut corners then blame you for their mistakes. I&#39;m paying for this for the rest of my life, also realself reviews they seem to be monitoring as my honest review was removed within 24 hours

Of course they are. It’s huge business there. They are setup so that people can’t do anything.
</p>
<p>
I hired a third party expert for my FFS evaluation and Instead of actually evaluating me. He tried to tell that I should have went to talk to that Brassard instead. Which is totally unrelated to my FFS other than he’s the big boss of GRS Montreal. This goes against anything remotely correct way of proceeding for third party expert hired in a lawsuit context.
</p>
<p>
Bensimon is the president of ( not sure if he still his) of plastic surgeon of Quebec.
</p>
<p>
The amount of control they have is beyond what should even be allowed.
</p>
<p>
They have monopoly, they know it. And they keep destroying lives. And preventing people from posting reviews on major sites where most people actually goes.
</p>
<p>
It’s disgusting. Plain and simple.

I think my SRS with Dr. McGinn took about 2 hours, so I don’t think the length of time is a good metric for saying it was bad.

Well, you have to be careful here again. Total
</p>
<p>
If I tell you the acceptable time to drive from point A to B is  about 2 hours. ( in this case u don’t specify. What is about. Tell me. What is your report. Maybe it’s actually 2:15) than 2:15 compare to 1:36 for sex reassignment is a huge difference.
</p>
<p>
Because if I use your logic and I don’t want to be insulting but hey I got mine I’m 1:36 than hey let’s try to do one in 1:15 minutes. And we get to 1:15 minutes. How about we get 45 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Serve a 5 min Risotto to a real chef and ask what he thinks about it.
</p>
<p>
The fact is yes you can rush it’s still eatable don’t get me wrong.
</p>
<p>
But there is thing is life that requires a minimum.
</p>
<p>
If you sit the guy that takes 3-4-5 hours beside the guy that 1:36 minutes.
</p>
<p>
My bet is that the guy that took a little more time. Cared a little more about what the end result would be.
</p>
<p>
Just my honest opinion.
</p>
<p>
Stop settling for less.

Nah. It needs to be filed in Quebec and they have like the monopoly on pretty much everything.it’s huge I’m Quebec.
</p>
<p>
The government does not even give guidelines.they are deciding what’s best.
</p>
<p>
I already write to health Minister here and did an Atip and found out that this clinic has carte blanche to do whatever they want.
</p>
<p>
And that’s my issue and it shows in the care they give us,

I’m sorry. And I know it sucks. I know that even in the community some don’t want to see post like this because of the people that will get surgery. Etc, etc.
</p>
<p>
The end game for me is I hope this will shake our community so that we stand up and demand quality and respect I’m our surgeries.
</p>
<p>
But if we keep not discussing it. It will simply get worst at the cost of whom? Us.
</p>
<p>
There is 2 ways to see my post. I know some trans activist pro surgeons will defends the surgeons. They probably got good results. lol heur surgery lasted 2-3-4 hours. They don’t have the same experience as me but will bash my post and say he’s excellent. And life’s will continue get destroyed.
</p>
<p>
As I stated before in other post. They are not charging McDonald fees. And they don’t make minimum salaries. The reason they are the type of money they are making if because they need to deliver constant quality results. At 1:36 minutes that’s not even caring. It’s doing the job so it’s done and pocketing the money. There is not consideration for the life the person will have after.
</p>
<p>
That being said,
</p>
<p>
This is my experience, I posted it so that people know. And if it comes to his hears maybe than he will start changing his ways and maybe you could actually end up having a surgeon that takes the time to the best possible work. Something that should have been a giving from the get go. Not because of reputation being at at stake but because the live and well being of people is why’s at stake.
</p>
<p>
I wish you all the luck and I am making so much noise being in he scene with province with that places that I’m pretty sure that they walking ok eggs right now. So I think it’s a good thing:)

Yeah that’s not happening in Quebec.  No other “expert” exist in province. It’s a sweet  little setup they have.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully I’ll find a way to get traction from the provincial government based on studies from  the trans population to change the legislation and have at least some quality control measures put in place.

I am sorry that you had a poor experience with Brassard. This kind of surgeries deserves the best care possible.
</p>
<p>
As for knowing who your surgeon will be, I was made aware that Brassard would be my surgeon a couple of months before the surgery. Were they not willing to tell you or did they change your surgeon without telling you?

No. They make you sign a form prior to your surgery. I have posted a review on realself with pictures and copy of the form that shows you are accepting that they might decide to assign you a different surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Dr.Bensimon does SRS there.  I will be exposing them in the next couple weeks. They will come after me but I almost I almost killed myself. And I kept reading about girls who struggle after their surgery because of their results, the fact they feel like they have been cheated. Or the fact that now have a non anatomical correct vagina.
</p>
<p>
No cis vulva have labia minora that closes before the vagina and then a hole.

Wasn&#39;t the form just in cases of emergency ie. The surgeon catches the flu? I can&#39;t visually confirmed that I had Brassard (I have terrible eyesight and was super high before falling asleep) but I am happy with the results even though there is still some way to go in terms of healing.

Hi,
</p>
<p>
Personally if the surgeon is the surgeon that catches the flu and supposedly only Brassard and Belanger do the surgeries. Knowing the workload they have have there. Than who is suppose to do yours? It goes to my point. At some point our community will start to need to stand together and stop accepting and settling for less.
</p>
<p>
Brassard and Belanger are not doing all SRS. They want you to think they are but they are not.  It sucks. It hurts to know that. I know it did. It broken me. And it’s my point to all of this. We continue to accept it and come out with our own reason.
</p>
<p>
So I’ll let you respond to yours.
</p>
<p>
If it’s a form for a flu that you that you sign 30 min prior to your  surgery.  And that you are supposed to have Brassard. And Maude is already doing an 8 hour phalo.
</p>
<p>
Who does yours? Who is that extra person. Do you think they will tell you tell you? Do you think your forms actually says it was done by ??. No it doesn’t. And this is my point.
</p>
<p>
It hurts. You feel betrayed.
</p>
<p>
You are happy with your result.great. I’m not. Wait till you see mine.  Still waiting for realself to post it.
</p>
<p>
If you want I’ll even email you mail where they send all timetable of members of operating room and they kindly forget to include actual surgery time. Until I insist.  I also have mails with info stating it’s Brassard and later( months) telling me they will get confirmation it’s Brassard. Oh so now they want to confirm? Because I brought up evidence of discrepancy?
</p>
<p>
Anyways, this is the beginning for me.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure some of you have positive results. Good for you.
</p>
<p>
I know Bensimon has done facial féminisation in 8 hours before also mine was in 3 hours. Never heard of a FFS in that time. This place as destroyed me and they have lied to me.
</p>
<p>
My goal is to exposed what they did to me and their practice.  After that if you still choose to go see them because you like them or you friend had good result well good for you. I don’t blame you.
</p>
<p>
Personally if I would have know my SRS would be done by a random u known surgeon to me in 1 hour 36 minute ending with all the issues I have and looking like a total mess. I would have made another choice.
</p>
<p>
I wish a version of me would have existed and be strong and guts enough to stand against them and say what happened to her.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Brassard how many surgeries? 5 realself reviews. Says it all.

Hi,
</p>
<p>
Waiting on realself to approve. Did it yesterday. It’s the weekend. So jot sure how long it will be.it said 24 hours. Tho to be honest. GRS has a lot of money and I wouldn’t be surprised they do everything ont their power for my vagina to not be seen by the public. If for some reason I cannot use realself because they got to them which wouldn’t surprise me. I’ll find another to make them available to the public. If anyone here has any idea on how and where  I can post pics of the results let me me know.
</p>
<p>
Thanks

You can post images using reddit - there&#39;s plenty of other posts here with images. otherwise you can put images on imgur.com and link to it in your post or comments.

No. If you look at rule 2 here it asked people to mark their posts with nsfw images as nsfw. There’s a setting to do that. There’s plenty of images like that in this sub. Perhaps you’ve set your account not to show them.

Hello, I&#39;m so sorry you had a bad experience with GRS MTL... It must be horrible to not be okay with the results of your surgeries. + I don&#39;t understand how it was only 1h36!! They seem really unprofessional.
</p>
<p>
But!! What I really wanted to say is, maybe you had a lot of problem with your pussy and all, (maybe you can try to pursue them?) But I really think it look... normal? I&#39;m a bi trans men and I know that all vaginas doesn&#39;t look the same, so esthetically I truly think yours look fine to me. You shouldn&#39;t be ashamed of what you look  you worked so hard.
</p>
<p>
The vagina can have lips shorter than the other, longer ... and folds are normal, regardless of age. there is always a lot of skin in its areas. Maybe taking nudes where you find yourself beautiful in them would help? Your boobs are fine too! Hope everything is okay now.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I&#39;m really disappointed in them. It&#39;s a really important surgery and I don&#39;t understand how they did it in only 1h36. they really lack pride and worth.
</p>

You know I said I was going to post pics. I did. I am not a liar. Girls have reported being operated by Bensimon in the past for SRS. Maybe write to him and ask him. And there is a new surgeon from France. And there is also surgeons there
</p>
<p>
If you seriously think that Maude and Brassard do all surgeries. They never get sick. There is never emergencies. The paper I was talking about you sign that the 30 minutes prior to surgery. Why do you think?
</p>
<p>
I was in communication with them months prior to the surgery. During this time you get forms and papers you needs to get your doctors to fill and send back. Things to reads and acknowledge.  They could include that one there ,no? BTW, you might not get Brassard or Maude even if you chose them. Why do you think you specifically get it right before the surgery.  How many patient will actually when they excited finally to be there. Actually be well no.
</p>
<p>
Again. I’m asking you. Explain to me why if they truly  care about the well being of the patient and that it is not because it is common practice to have random surgeon practice on us. Why is that form only given to us right before the surgery?
</p>
<p>
Anyways,
</p>
<p>
You people do what you want and believe what you want.
</p>
<p>
I’m doing this for my conscience and for those who it will help. If you you choose to side with them. Hey that’s your choice. Not mine.
</p>
<p>
Sharing my experience and my results. It the next weeks this will become public’s because they told they would sue me if I would speak up. You’ll learn the rest then.

Omg no he’s not. You can get whatever surgeon they decide to give you. They will make you sign a form  less than an hour prior  to your surgery with these fine print.
</p>
<p>
When you get assigned another surgeon. You tend to be gazed out right away in the surgery room.
</p>
<p>
I know I didn’t not get Brassard even tho they say they did. I saw a woman surgeon which was not Maude and than past out. Everyone else who had surgery there the same week and who had Brassard saw him the room.I did not and pass out right away.  Tho Brassard did come to see me prior in the little room to see if I had enough material. Why? It didn’t matter since I had already signed forms that if a skin graft was required he could do it( he didn’t need) and since he was doing the surgery right?
</p>
<p>
He came because the surgeon that operated me was probably a rookie or not really good and couldn’t do a skin graft surgery. He confirmed, it was not required and he that’s it.  It happened to others.
</p>
<p>
If you want a good looking vagina.  GRS Montreal is the last place you want to go.final.

Really? That’s so odd, I never saw him out of his hospital gown all four times I saw him. My surgery took around 3 hours I think, and I knew three months before Dr. Brassard was going to do it, and even the anaesthesiologist visited me a few times.
</p>
<p>
Have they changed stuff since then? I know there’s some trans women that have issues due to how many people get surgery there, but I fortunately didn’t experience any of that when I was there.
</p>
<p>
I also don’t see your review on realself, and if it’s about negative reviews there is one and it’s been there for four years now.
