I had one UTI but that was about it . No other infection so far. As you can see in the pictures the surgical graft that was used inside of me did end up inflaming . So much that I couldn‚Äôt pee for a whole day and had to go to her office to have it cut. That was the most painful thing about this entire process . Not being able to pee because something is blocking or pressing against your bladder . The pressure from needing to go just building up . It was horrible . Once it was cut I did go back to being able to urinate regularly ..  however days latter the rest of the surgical graft started sliding out.

Also I  used Neosporin  on the area with the yellow slough tissue before I was finally able to get a medicine called Santyl that help debree it. That with cleaning the area constantly  through the day may have contributed to the reason it  didn‚Äôt  get infected .

What happened after you had to take the skin graft out? Was it really painful? Did everything heal well despite losing the graft?
</p>
<p>
Wish you a speedy recovery! 3 months is early still and I bet it will get even better, best of luck!

It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt a skin graft . It was some type of biological graft that didn‚Äôt belong to me . I was told it was added to help support the space between my bladder and canal . After it was removed I was able to urinate regularly . It did bleed some . For about a week puss like fluid came out of the space where it was cut .  I swore after it was removed that I was peeing from both my urethra and vaginal canal . I got a  ct scan to confirm that wasn‚Äôt the case . Since than yes it has healed . Although I didn‚Äôt have a infection I was still put on a round of antibiotics by my primary  safe guard against possible infection  just to be cautious . This happened around my third week after surgery . So I couldnt really feel much pain inside once it was cut .

Thanks so much . Like most girls I have heard and seen the horror stories . I had the option of waiting and switching insurances to go see other surgeons. But that would have meant waiting  a year to switch to a different carrier and than starting the process all over again with getting approved by insurance and  than being on a long waiting list for surgery . I know some will say I took a HUGE gamble . But I couldn‚Äôt wait much longer for the genitals I was born with to be gone. I was super scared before the operation and when complications arose afterwards  I felt like I was gonna be another horror story.  But I continue to stay on top of everything . I sent  weekly pictures and videos . I keep all emails . I constantly let Rumer know that I  my primary doctor was seeing me every two weeks and what her opinion was about any complication I had . I also expressed concern with my case manager at my insurance company who I have been with since 2017. There were times  it took my insurance company to call their office directly when I couldn‚Äôt get a answer . I don‚Äôt want to make it seem like this has been easy because it hasn‚Äôt . And I‚Äôm still very much in my early stages of healing with a ways to go. I will never  dis credit anyones experience with Kathy. Because some of the things girls have said I have experienced myself.  What I do realize from reading MANY post and seeing MANY pictures on Reddit . Is that you are taking a gamble with any surgeon . Some way more than others . I just hope that the worst is truely over with. Because I don‚Äôt want to  repeat a lot of things that happened ‚ùóÔ∏è

Can I ask why you went the penile route ? Or was that the only option ? How much depth have you gotten ?

However I can honestly say that I‚Äôm certain I would have still chosen penile inversion over the rest. Because the other methods seem more invasive.

It feels so good to read this! :-)
</p>
<p>
90% of the time people will praise those invasive surgeries on Reddit, while the good old penile inversion technique imho is still good enough and comes with less possible complications, or it&#39;s simply less invasive, right!

Hopefully so others don‚Äôt get screwed over? I was butchered by her, too, but definitely didn‚Äôt want to go off about it in a happy post. I still can‚Äôt blame them for saying that, though. It needs to be said.

It&#39;s important for Federal-Tension to say because such severe complications are generally avoidable with other surgeons. &#34;Problems are bound to happen&#34; indeed. Of course, every surgery is a gamble, but I prefer 90/10 odds over 50/50. I&#39;m not sure what &#34;enjoying one&#39;s pussy&#34; has to do with experiencing complications along the way. Good luck, OP. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having these issues.
