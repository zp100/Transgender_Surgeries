The black parts coming off are almost certainly surgical tape / glue. I had it too and it began to drop off around 1.5 weeks, and continued to till around 10ish weeks (but tbh I was trying to preserve it by keeping the area wet with I think Neosporin. I might be remembering the Neosporin medication wrong, but it was something to help keep the area wet to promote better flesh fusing without a scar
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™d still be good to ask your doctor btw about the black stuff, but it really looks like the tape I had placed over almost all of my stitches (even on inner labia / clit areas)

You look quite normal for two weeks. Things look pretty rough for a bit.

Whos your surgeon if youre okay with sharing? It could be granulation! Are you 1000% sure youve lost depth? The smell is unfortunate but that will go away too! If you want we can chat!

Hi! Im just gonna take a moment! It&#39;s early on, and overall, my body feels fine! There&#39;s no real pain associated with it, and it&#39;s not like my whole body is coming undone! That being said, this response is the exact reason i posted anonymously! You should try going through the process and then having input! But besides that, i would rather have absolutely NOTHING down there than a penis and so no matter what, i won&#39;t regret anything!
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your time!
