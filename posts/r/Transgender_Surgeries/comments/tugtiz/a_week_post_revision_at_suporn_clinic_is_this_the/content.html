Generally speaking surgeons are reluctant to do anything for a year after a procedure so things have time to &#34;settle&#34; its very hard to tell what is lasting while there is significant swelling.

I’m not one to bandy this term about, but it looks natal to me. Obviously things will change as you heal and the swelling goes down.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if you wouldn’t be more satisfied if the area of your mons/Fupa if you lost a bit of weight?

Easy there. They aren&#39;t saying &#34;you&#39;re bad because you&#39;re fat,&#34; they&#39;re saying &#34;
<em>
you&#39;re
</em>
concerned with how
<em>
your
</em>
body looks, specifically, how the fat is organized in one specific area; perhaps you,
<em>
the person who is concerned about this
</em>
, may be satisfied by altering the levels of fat in your body.&#34;
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a difference between fatphobia and an honest suggestion that you&#39;re asking about anyway.

How is my comment fatphobic? You wanted to know how to make the commisure more prominent, I suggested that losing a bit of weight might make it more pronounced.
</p>
<p>
I’m like genuinely confused, would it have been better to jot offer the suggestion for getting why you want because the suggestion discussed weight?

EDIT: Not cool to downvote OP for asking nicely guys.

I don&#39;t think anyone who uses the phrase now remembers it but fupa = &#34;fucked up pussy area&#34; when people first started saying it. This might be what OP is referring to.

I have literally never heard this definition.  It&#39;s always been &#39;Fat Upper ...&#34;..  Not that they&#39;re they definitive source of slang but even urban dictionary doesn&#39;t have an your definition in the top results.

Generally suggesting people might be happier if they lose weight isn&#39;t a great thing to do.  Fatphobic even.

I know Suporn has his own technique, so I don&#39;t know how much impact this has, but on a normal PI, that dip can be caused by the downward pressure and tightness of the inversion. It&#39;s a necessary part of the surgery. Typically it loosens back up over time as the skin becomes less taunt.
</p>
<p>
Of course if your surgeon decides at some point, during a revision, that she&#39;s going she&#39;s going to
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/X6HTKrgPbpDmdmpk8">cut up your anterior commissure</a>
like a Christmas ham without warning you, all bets are off.

From the available pictures the dip is in the mons.  What about lipofilling of this area?  Put up more detailed pics when you aren&#39;t sore.  Hugs and heal well. Bridget

Looks good, and I am sure it will look even better. How is there recovery, can you walk normally?. I am only 7 m post op (Suporn) but after looking at some of the comments by other girls who have had a revision I am starting to consider it. Of course want to wait at least until I am 1 year post op.

I can walk almost normally. They told me not to sit (for posterior commissure work) or walk much for the first few days. Hmu if you want to talk about it more.

Thank you. I am glad you can walk! What a difference compared to the first procedure! (it took me 4 months to be able to walk enough to go back to work and 5 to drop the pillow). Based on what you are saying this is clearly doable. I would love to talk more about it at some point, in particular about the posterior commissure revision.  I will message you later. Thank you 😊

this looks similar to mine! i have also seen many cis women with this shape, but if it causes you dysphoria, i’m sure it’s an easy fix with some sort of injection procedure.

draw some diagrams, use reference pictures of other genitalia, maybe show them these pics from this post and explain what you feel needs to be fixed, etc.  i have autism so i find it hard to communicate also and that always helps me, so maybe it will help you also? do NOT leave before you feel you have fully explained. if they try to dismiss your concern, then that is not the right doctor for you.

An update: I saw Dr Bank yesterday and he said that&#39;s as far as he can pull the  outer labia together because there would be too much tension on the wound (the little vertical cut above the cleft there. This made sense to me and I was getting some hypertrophic scaring after primary surgery so I didn&#39;t want to risk more. He did suggest a good idea which is getting some lipo filler back home :D
</p>
<p>

<p>
Also I had him redo my posterior commissure (bringing the inner labia together around the vaginal opening). there were limitations with my amount of material to work with and he originally was reluctant. He warned me I&#39;s be tighter and could have trouble inserting things, but knowing my body, the way my vagina gapes a bit at the entrance and the tightness I feel is always a couple centimeters inside, I went ahead with that anyway.  It looked pretty good, more almond shaped. Hope it feels good when it heals too!
</p>
<p>
Right now I feel like i pair of jeans that just had  it&#39;s crotch seam sewn.
