Good luck with your recovery, Dr. Sutin is on my short list for SRS (my favorite option), I have a few questions about your experience: What tea made Dr. Sutin choose over other doctors? Did you have circumcision before SRS? (I read that it was a good thing, but I&#39;m not sure) Did you ask for a specific aesthetic for your vulva? What SRS technique did you have? (Inversion of the penile skin with scrotal graft, Sigmoid Colon or PPT)

I chose Dr. Sutin for a few reasons,1 the most important,He has studied under DR.Preecha who taught everyone else in Thailand and hasn&#39;t had 1 complaint that I could find. I would put him at the top of ur list. 2. Yes I was circumsized prior to surgery but I also had a very large penis , I was not looking for a specific aesthetic just done correctly.  , And the technique I had performed was the penile inversion with scrotal graft. Tomorrow he takes out the packing so I&#39;m excited to see my junk for the 1st time . JUST A FYI KAMOL HAS HAD TO MANY STORES AND BAD RESULTS TO LAND ME THERE. HOPE THIS HELPS.

Congratulations!  Sutin is one of the best surgeons in the world.  I know of many Spanish girls who had surgery there and are very happy with the results.  One question, did you have to quarantine?  how long do you have to be in thailand?

So happy for you. I dream of the day of waking up bandaged there, and dread the unending boredom.

Was the process painful? How deep is your vaginal cavity? What did you feel when you saw your new pussy?

Well the process is certainly not a easy one. At least I don&#39;t be think it&#39;s easy for anyone. The 1st 4 days after surgery were very hard to move or to get comfortable especially with all the packing. Walking hurts, laying down hurts, sitting up hurts etc. Idk how deep my vagina is I really won&#39;t know until I start dilation in a few days. The packing was removed today but no dilation yet. When I saw my VULVA , I felt emotional I felt at peace to be honest I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s really hit me yet. But I do know that I&#39;m felt a sense of relief after the tape and things were removed..
