Despite the controversies, has anyone been to Dr. Bart somewhat recently?

So I&#39;ve been saving for years on a terrible income, Facial Team and anyone on further shores are miles out of my price range, and I&#39;ve lost the will to wait any longer to pass decently. Other surgeons in my area are either also unaffordable or won&#39;t take me. The only one around with any reputation at all that I can afford is Dr. Bart.
</p>
<p>
I remember him being considered decent a few years back, but on the wiki, it&#39;s pretty much all bad stories in 2016-2017, and not a lot since then other then people saying &#34;oh don&#39;t go to that guy, I heard he&#39;s bad&#34;. Is he really that terrible, or it is hyperbole? Anybody got any recent first hand accounts?

Okay I guess this account just became a throwaway. Went to Bart for a jaw reduction in 2016 and got a severed nerve which makes my mouth crooked, and drool comes out one side when I laugh. My left salivary gland will squirt out of my mouth when I yawn.  He did a lower facelift at the same time and there was so much Post op swelling that I now have saggy jowls as well.
</p>
<p>
I went to him to correct it and he was dismissive about my outcome and proposed 2-3 surgeries to correct it that Iâ€™d have to pay for.  I canâ€™t afford that so now I look  10 years older and sorta damaged.
</p>
<p>
I worked with an older woman in the UK who had been at a dinner with him and his family (the second one) and he calls us crazy and â€˜not so normalâ€™ when  weâ€™re not lining up to give him money.  Being visibly trans is a drag in the UK,  being stared at by children is not much better.
</p>
<p>
I wish there were better options petal, but hold fast for a good outcome. You just get the one face.

Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™ve suffered this. I went to see him for a consultation and must admit he came across as very arrogant, put me right off, totally in line with your comments

Thanks, I appreciate your frankness. And I&#39;m really sorry that happened to you.
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;ve been saving for almost a decade since I was a teen, and this is the best I can do. I have a chronic disability, and if anything, my income situation is getting worse, not better. So I&#39;m still going to go through with it. Looking 10 years older is really rough, but in the end, being 10 years older without being able to live properly is the same result.
</p>
<p>
But it&#39;s good to be viscerally reminded of the risks and test my willingness to push forward. I think that was the reason I made this thread, more than seeking meaningful advice. I&#39;ve already read a bunch of accounts, and know he&#39;s kind of sketchy, but at this point, I think there&#39;s no possibility of complication that scares me more than continuing to do nothing.

Did you try contacting Dr. Altman in Brighton and explain your situation? Like I said before he will gate keep but I donâ€™t know how high his bar is for closing the gate?
</p>
<p>
Who ever you go with I wish you the very best of luck and results ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž

I did. He seemed to suggest he wouldn&#39;t take me, and was also a little too expensive.

Glad to see that I was tagged in this post.
</p>
<p>
I went to have FFS with Dr. Bart at 2Pass Clinic in Nov. of 2018. I&#39;ve spoke at length about my experience on my channel (YT: Jessica FTW), but I&#39;ll briefly recap here. Though I must preface this with the acknowledgement that everyone&#39;s experience is different, and I can&#39;t speak for anything but the experience that I had.
</p>
<p>
I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience at 2Pass. The accommodations were perfect (once I got the heat turned up). I felt right at home, as soon as I arrived. The staff were warm and friendly - feeling less like staff and more like friends. Dr. Bart himself was attentive to our conversations, always respectful and charming, and I never felt like our conversations were rushed. The morning of surgery, he even was willing to implement a last minute request to a change in my surgery plan.
</p>
<p>
My experience during recovery was great. I went there by myself, which I was nervous about, but never felt alone. Recovery surely has its difficult moments - but I can say that I experienced little to no pain (the biggest issues being swelling and bruising).
</p>
<p>
A week after surgery, I returned home to the United States. The clinic has been great at responding to my emails within a day, whenever I have any questions.
</p>
<p>
2 and 1/2 months out, I can say without qualification that I am very happy with my results. It has changed my life. I have the confidence to go dating now, haven&#39;t been clocked a single time (most people are now surprised/disbelieving upon hearing that I am trans), and, most importantly, feel like my face is MY face.
</p>
<p>
The cost of 2Pass was significantly lower than anything I encountered in the States, and 23k less than the price quoted to me by FacialTeam. I had hairline lowering, type III forehead reconstruction, rhinoplasty, fat transfer to cheeks and upper lip, jaw/chin recontouring, and tracheal reduction. This cost me approximately 25k USD.
</p>
<p>
I cannot emphasize enough how happy I am that I went to 2Pass.
</p>
<p>
(also, inb4 &#39;she&#39;s shilling for 2Pass&#39; - I&#39;m not. I received no compensation/offer to incentivize me to give them positive press. I&#39;m just happy with my experience and want others to know, considering the decision of where to go can be such a stressful one.)

I saw a couple of bad things about him but I didn&#39;t realize his reputation was that bad... I just scheduled a skype consultation with him. I guess I was just hoping those bad reviews I saw were a lot smaller portion of his patients than it appears to be :/
