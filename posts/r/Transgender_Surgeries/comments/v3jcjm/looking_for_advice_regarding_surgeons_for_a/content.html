So I had my GCS with Dr Bowers on April 7th. Everything looked awesome until I had a full body systemic allergic reaction to the mineral oil they had me taking to help me poop. It took us two weeks to realize that it was the mineral oil that was causing the allergic reaction and during that time my entire vagina as well as my entire body was covered in hives. A lot of skin started failing including my entire labia minora (the only part that made it is that tiny flap on the bottom left.) We tried oxygen therapy to help stop the necrosis and it definitely helped, but it was already too late for my labia minora and all the tissue that it took with it.
</p>
<p>
Bowers office said they are booked out until October 2024 but that they MIGHT be able to get me in by early/mid 2023. I know that most surgeons won&#39;t even look until 6 months post op, but I&#39;m trying to get a game plan together of who to contact. I just know that I can&#39;t live with my clitoris being completely exposed like this, it&#39;s just too much sensation.

Dr. Stiller in Spokane, WA has a great reputation for good work including revisions.

Wow. I&#39;m so sorry. The actual vagina (sans labia) looks really good.
</p>
<p>
And I have a tough time believing that Marci Bowers would refuse to get in there and do whatever it would take to fix your problems, like RIGHT NOW.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s just unacceptable. And OK--even if she absolutely CAN&#39;T find the time, she ought to refer you to one of her partners to get you in immediately for whatever reconstruction. and post op care you need.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s one of my heroes, so hearing that she can&#39;t bestir herself to fix a problem SHE caused is really heart breaking.
</p>
<p>
For you. AND for me. This is really a non-negotiable issue. Your vagina needs to be made whole--with NO delay.
</p>
<p>
I guess if her office remains unmoved, then I&#39;d file a complaint with the San Mateo County medical board, the local AMA, and the DA.
</p>
<p>
Also, I&#39;d consider contacting the San Francisco Chronicle, and all of the TV stations in San Francisco--KGO, KPIX, KNTV, KRON, and KTVU. I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be VERY interested in your plight.
</p>
<p>
If it comes to that, your relationship with Bowers will be over, but you will certainly get your issue resolved by some other top surgeon in the area VERY quickly.
</p>
<p>
Good luck, sweetheart. Please post updates.
</p>
<p>
Will be thinking about you.

This is not the first time I&#39;ve heard of similar issues with post op issues with this surgeon, just FYI.

If everything goes well, her office is the best, if anything goes wrong, it&#39;s big long breaks in between responses and 2-year wait lists to get a revision.
</p>
<p>
That being said, Dr Bowers came into the office after hours on her day off to do an exam when I was mid way through my oxygen therapy appointments just to see how things were doing.

I think you&#39;ll need more time to know how everything will settle in. I think most surgeons won&#39;t do a revision until you&#39;re one year out (for aesthetics/the vulva), unless its a canal or urethra issue.

I think it looks good.  Some clits are exposed. Mines is in foreskin luckily but many of them are exposed.  Some of us have too much labia.  It will be easier to clean that way. Your skin will adjust to the sensitity. Welcome to the walking while getting turned on..  hope thats okay to say.. for the purpose of making you smile of course.. I know you want the revision I am not talking you out of it, and hopefully someone will give you the information you seek.
