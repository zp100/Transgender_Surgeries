The labia minora are becoming more lip like and the scars are tightening up and fading slightly. No more bruising

It’s been 4 months now since I had my surgery.  I am so happy with the results! Granulation tissue keeps improving.I&#39;ve also had breast augmentation , everything is great!

Day 1
</p>
<p>
I could  really  see my penis is officially gone and I had this flat shape. OMFG that is so cool to see! Wow
</p>

Day 4
</p>
<p>
Time in the hospital was a total of 4 days. The day the packing came out, I got to go home.  I’m also able to pee straight.

</p>
<p>
Day 8
</p>
<p>
Now because of all the swelling going down. Depth is now 5 inches. If i want to keep it that way,
</p>
<p>
I’ll just have to continue the endless chore of dilating.  Dr.Kanit has me on 3 times a day until 3 months, and then after 6 months you can go down to twice a day or twice a week depending on ur depth.  Its not painful or anything unless i go up a size in dilation ( S,M,L )
</p>

</p>
<p>
Day 18
</p>
<p>
My instructions are to dilate twice a day for 30mins. I’m to slowly step up the dilator size ( S,M,L) and should be on the biggest one . He has given me some cream to mix in with my lube to help the healing process.
</p>
<p>
Here are some photos of my results. The experience with Dr.Kanit and MAXi team was great.

what do you think about physical appearance ?   In my opinion, The srs was brilliant and looks so real and beautiful.

Wow, amazing. The appearance is beautiful. I&#39;m another person who had SRS surgery in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
After I had SRS surgery From male to female, 1 year ago.My boyfriend is thrilled with it, and aesthetically speaking, I&#39;m thrilled with it, also, my PCP who has a primarily trans population and has seen quite a few post-surgical results said this is the best outcome she&#39;s ever seen and said that it&#39;s probably only going to look even better as I continue to heal.
</p>
<p>
I would suggest anyone go see MAXi cosmetic surgery and particularly request to have Dr. Kanit in Thailand.(though, they are all amazing surgeons).

I&#39;ve been really liking MAXi lately. I&#39;ve seen some really nice results. Especially in the standing vertical position. That angle is most important to me for some reason. Maybe it&#39;s because that&#39;s the most common view people would see? I dunno. Sorry for the rant. Anyway yours is looking great too. Can you please keep us posted with updates?

I chose him because I have few thai girlfriend done both on the same time, I’ve seen result was great looking, natural.  matter fact he’s one of professional surgeon in thailand. but I haven’t see a lot of his review. I&#39;ve been trying to find out more about him,So I started researching  Dr.Kanit srs Thailand in google. Dr.Kanit is still a member  ISAPS, OSAPS ,ASPS

I had such an amazing experience with Dr.kanit , well worth everything I went though.I was able to get 5 1/2&#34; of depth from the surgery. Sensation is also pretty good and I have been able to orgasm.

Wow !! I saw your review and I liked it. It looks so natural. I have a plan to go to Thailand for surgery with Dr.kanit in May as well. But I have to postpone my surgery first Because of the corona virus situation during this time, I&#39;m quite sorry. Because I booked a hotel With the plane ticket But I will definitely go to Sex reassignment surgery with Dr. Kanit Thailand.
