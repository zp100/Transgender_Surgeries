Hi, Lilia of FT here. What a great post (as are all of them regarding the different stages)!
</p>
<p>
Just to mention that in Marbella you will be given some self-care items which include, among other basics, sterile saline with a spray bottle and lip salve.  ;) Thanks for sharing your experience with the community!  I believe the coordinator sends information about what is provided and what they recommend you purchase (here there are loads of pharmacies).

Hi Lilia!Thank you for reaching out. I have watched many of your life streams :)
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s great to know I will be receiving a bunch of care items. It really does seem like you all do a great job to care for your patients. I&#39;m quite excited for these next 6 weeks to hurry up and be done so I can make my way to Spain.

Just catching up on this topic to see if you have any further feedback regarding the administrative tasks. Perhaps you have already mentioned it in another thread?  Also, just to mention that we are doing an AMA here on Reddit tomorrow at 13:45 CET.
