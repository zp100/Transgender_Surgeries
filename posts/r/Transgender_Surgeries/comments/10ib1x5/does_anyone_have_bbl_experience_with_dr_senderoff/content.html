Does anyone have BBL experience with Dr. Senderoff, Del Vecchio, or Hughes?

After just a day of digging, it looks like these 3 are the top choices for BBL/implants. It&#39;s difficult to get the full truth when there&#39;s astroturfing and review manipulation, so I was wondering if anyone here was brave enough to share any experiences they&#39;ve had with these doctors. Results. Pricing. Honesty. Those sorts of stuffs.
</p>
<p>
As a side note....it&#39;s been BRUTAL waiting for my FFS with Dr. Mayer, so I am hoping researching and booking a BBL consultation will help me bear the wait a little longer. I&#39;ve had no work done yet and I&#39;ve started HRT 3 years ago at age 30. So it&#39;s been rough y&#39;all.
</p>
<p>
Until then, it&#39;s 20 sets of heavy hip thrusts 3-4x a week and corset training. There&#39;s been progress, but those hip dips aren&#39;t going anywhere.

I met with Delvecchio, he seemed a bit nuts to me. If you look beyond the surface you&#39;ll find tons of people having issues or complications with him. BUT he does get really good results from what others say and from how his pics look.

Thank you for responding!
</p>
<p>
Where should I be looking? And what issues are people talking about? I don&#39;t mind the ego or ideal image surgeons have.
</p>
<p>
His results look phenomenal which means I will probably be seeking a consult in a few months...unless there&#39;s something I don&#39;t know.

He is very aggressive and gets good results for many people. I personally  don&#39;t feel comfortable because I&#39;ve read an inoordinate amount of reviews where people have complications, including infections, lumps, unnecessary scarring, etc.
</p>
<p>
Look on all reviews for him under realself, sort by lowest review. Do the same thing on yelp. I mean just do some googling on him and also google his practice names. He practices under both his name and a name for his office (Back Bay Plastic surgery for the Boston office and Uptown Plastic Surgery is his NYC office.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not worried about results, he gets good results. I&#39;m worried about complications, safety, protocol, pre-surgery care and aftercare. I am still tempted to go to him, but given some of what I&#39;m read I don&#39;t know if my comfort level is going to let me pull the trigger.

I&#39;ll definitely look there first in the future.
</p>
<p>
I just had my consult for FFS. It was a little more than I thought it was originally going to be, so I gotta put all my resources there for now. If insurance, loans and my business pan out well, I&#39;ll compare the worst of both BBL surgeons to make the final choice.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!
