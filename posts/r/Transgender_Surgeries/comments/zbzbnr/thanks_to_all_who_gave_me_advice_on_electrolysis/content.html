Thanks to all who gave me advice on electrolysis on the genitals. I am doing a lot better with and any of the real bad spots I am doing my own lidocaine injections. 2 hour sessions every week for a year or more @ $90 per hour, between the cost and pain we sure do earn that vagina.

That’s how long any hair removal takes due to growth cycles. I usually tell people 1.5 years but at the end you’re only coming in every 2 months.

The pain is INTENSE! Good for you getting through your 2 hour sessions! I also did 2 hours at a time, lidocaine (topical) and ibuprofen, and by the end I was crying every time. I&#39;m not overly hairy so I went once a month and took right about two years. And seriously awesome price! Mine (years ago at this point) was $140/hr. Still, electro is SO cheap and painless compared to the surgery (at least in the US with paying deductibles and other expenses)!

Did you do laser first? Or just electrolysis to be 100% sure.

Did you ask your surgeon about it? I talked to three, one of them required electrolysis, one of them recommended laser but didn&#39;t care which I chose, and one of them
<em>
required laser
</em>
and advised
<em>
against
</em>
electrolysis. I think electrolysis is probably fine, but this idea that laser
<em>
can&#39;t
</em>
work is just not true.
</p>
<p>
Edit: also even the surgeon who required electrolysis only required 6 3-4 hour sessions. 100+ hours is ludicrous.

That makes sense then, but you still won&#39;t need 100 hours. Especially after a few sessions, you&#39;ll probably need to go less often than weekly just to give time for enough of it to grow.

Surgeons often have no idea how hair removal properly works and don&#39;t really care if people have issues several years down the line

Honestly I feel like it would reduce the amount &amp; intensity of the electrolysis bc it thinks the hairs and greatly reduces the number of hairs? Idk though, I&#39;ve only had lasor then electrolysis never just electrolysis by itself

Problem is laser can stun hairs so they seem removed but grow back years later. For most areas of the body this is fine, you can just zap it again when it regrows, but if that area becomes the vaginal canal you&#39;re kind of fucked if the hair grows back.

If that&#39;s true, then i won&#39;t be able to get my vagina this year or the next year or the year after that. My last laser session was just a couple of months ago before i switched to full electrolysis. Now i see my down there is not going to be safe to invert for a long long time because of &#34;stunned hairs&#34; lying in wait. This is horrible!!!

Can you provide information on your procedures for doing your own injections? I&#39;m considering doing that myself too.  How hard was it to convince your doctor?

I was researching this and read:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some consumers have written to me about self-injecting anesthesia prior to hair removal. Self-injection of anesthetics is extremely dangerous and can be fatal if the anesthetic is injected directly into the bloodstream. I do not recommend using injectable anesthetics for hair removal unless done in consultation with a medical professional.

</p>
<p>
What areas are you injecting into?

I’ve done heaps of research into this, and it’s very misleading.
</p>
<p>
The biggest risk is probably allergy to lidocaine. If you have a bad reaction and not near medical help you could be in big trouble. If you’ve had lidocaine injections before I expect the risk is very low. Personally I’ve had heaps of them, dental injections, small medical procedures etc.
</p>
<p>
You also need to keep things sterile. I guess it’s possible to mess that up.
</p>
<p>
It’s very hard to get injectable lidocaine, and if you can your doctor should be advising you on how to use it.

Thanks for the feedback. I will need to do more research.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been doing E injections for 1-1/2 years so I understand the sterile concern.
</p>
<p>
I will after doing the research bring it up with perhaps my plastic surgeon that will be doing my GRS. We have a good relationship already.

I&#39;m looking to start this process - I&#39;m told it doesn&#39;t hurt as bad as laser on the face, which I&#39;m hoping is accurate lol. My last laser session was intense though, and I have a high pain tolerance... Like it blanched my skin and felt like searing hot needles were hitting each hair, coupled with straight heat radiating on the face. My teeth HURT because each hit of the laser on my chin radiated into the nerves of my teeth. I had to keep reminding myself that it was the last time and it meant barely any shaving going forward, minus the clear hairs that still need to die...
</p>
<p>
As long as electro is more like sessions #4 or #5 of my face laser treatments then I should be good lol. My esthetician charges $100/hr for genitals, so I&#39;m glad to see that&#39;s not far off the mark!

Do you know if they&#39;re doing galvanic, flash thermolysis, or blend? I ask because the next big bombshell that&#39;s going to be hitting the trans community is all the girls who got flash thermolysis electrolysis who have hair growing internally because it didn&#39;t kill the follicle. It also hurts vastly more than galvanic, has a high propensity to scar and burn the skin as well. The only upside is the speed it can &#34;clear&#34; hairs with, but what we&#39;re seeing now is girls who 10+ years ago had flash thermolysis and are now having to navigate how to extract the internal growth.

I’ve had about 100 hours of thermolysis with synchro, the pain isn’t bad at all. The only part I used numbing cream was a small part of the Brazilian. I have atypical trigeminal neuralgia and I can even have it done on my fire spots. What machine is your electrologist using?

Interesting - thanks for the insight! I&#39;ve heard people say laser was worse and vice versa. Guess I won&#39;t know until I try!
</p>
<p>
Bodies are so weird - pain is different for everyone, so I&#39;m interested to see how I fair 😬 it&#39;s like talking to people who got tattoos on their ribs - I&#39;ve heard some say they slept through it, others say it was the most painful thing they&#39;ve experienced.

Lasor on the face is a more ... Immediate pain? Also way longer lasting. Electrolysis on the face is very intense but as soon as the needle is withdrawn there is almost no pain, it generally hurts less than lasor I&#39;d say, overall, but around the bones like chin or lips was worse imo

My butt hole and the crevice of my groin/leg was tuff with laser but nothing close to the pain it has been on my face. I would never have thought this but geeez it fkg further there bad even with prescription lidocaine.  I can&#39;t imagine electrolysis being worse I&#39;m gonna have to be drugged if this is the case and I also have a high pain tolerance and have gave myself piercing all over my body.

Honestly that sounds like your lasor setting were way too high, normally lasor has a very bursty pain like a rubber band on your face, the only residual feeling should be like a deep heat in your face, which you can treat with lasoraid cream. Maybe double check to make sure the person doing your lasor knows what they are doing? If you fuck up lasor it can permanently damage your skin

She knew what she was doing, she warned it was the last session and was going to crank it up a bit to get the last of the hairs she could before moving into electrolysis. I was down to just grey/clear hairs and it was an attempt to clean those up, basically praying they had any pigmentation at the follicle. Session #5 was a precursor to this session and was quite &#34;fun&#34;, but #6 was the first that made me have to breathe through a couple sections lol. She tested some areas and asked if I could handle it, so I knew what I was getting into lol. The blanching of the skin went away within the hour, nothing crazy, and she warned it was going to happen. Overall, prior sessions definitely felt like a sharp snap, no residual heat because she had a fancy cold wand. Only the last two were ones I felt heat, with the last one getting pretty hot.
</p>
<p>
She is
<em>
the
</em>
person to go to around this area, like I drive to another state to see her because she&#39;s so highly regarded lol. She will warn that she runs a little hotter on the laser than others by default but will back it off if you want. You can see my prior posted photos and see that she does fantastic work! Despite how painful the last one was, I&#39;d do it again if she said I needed to because my face looks fantastic now, all thanks to her!

This is useless for pre-surgery genital hair removal. The reason why people do electrolysis is because the removal has to be
<em>
permanent
</em>
. The skin is going to be used to create a vagina. Once that&#39;s done it&#39;s much more difficult to remove the hair and you certainly can&#39;t use a home IPL device inside a neovagina.

It almost seems like from what I&#39;m reading there&#39;s different kinds of electrolysis? Is one more permanent than another? I want to make sure the hair dies and stays dead.  Having internal growth sounds terrible

It sounds like the blend is the best of both worlds. Is that different per place you go to? Also do you have a surgeon picked yet? I&#39;m in the prep work stage

I swear by this
<a href="https://www.cfspharmacy.pharmacy/blt-compounded" rel="nofollow">BLT Ointment
</a>
. I&#39;ve done close to 400 hours of electrolysis on my face, chest and belly. I just started with GRS prep and it works wonders there due to the thin skin.

I know. It didn&#39;t work well in some spots on my neck where the skin is thicker. You can use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide" rel="nofollow">DMSO
</a>
oil that will help the BTL penetrate the skin. Dr Powers added this to his
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/wiki/compounded-medicines/#wiki_topical_anesthetic_.232" rel="nofollow">Topical Anesthetic
</a>
.  I tried his formula but it didn&#39;t last me 20 treatments and wasn&#39;t any better.
</p>
<p>
I bought DMSO oil and would put that on before the BLT ointment. I think that it helped a little but it caused skin irritation on my neck.   I suppose if it was compounded into the ointment, perhaps it would have been better.

Yes. I sent the link to my PCP and his office submitted the prescription. The compounding pharmacy then reached out for shipping information and CC#. I received it in a few days. The 120cc pump lasted for ~100 hours of treatments. I tried others but NOTHING was a good as this.

did you have any issues with the formulation &#34;separating&#34; over time?  I tried the powers cream and after 6 months, half of it turned to liquid with probably the other half something more solid than paste :/

I went through the Powers formula In several weeks and I wasn&#39;t covering huge areas. I was really disappointed.
</p>
<p>
The other BLT ointment I linked goes a LONG way and I didn&#39;t see much separation in 4 to 5 months. I think that storing it upside right/upside down week to week would avoid the separation.

I noticed a little separation at the end of the 120ml tube and thought about just rotating it week to week. That should prevent separation since the gravity would keep mixing it. That or vigorous shaking periodically.

Bah….there’s so much pain involved with transitioning, people wonder why we get upset when being misgendered. If they only knew the process we have to go through, I’m sure there’d be less of it(probably not but wishful thinking)

Numbing cream doesn’t always work. Injections work for almost everyone.

Looks like you&#39;re buffering with sodium bicarbonate. That removes a large part of the sting. There&#39;s also finer needles and applying topical beforehand.

That’s doesn’t make sense, I never heard of injectable being compounded. It’s used all the time in small medical procedures. It should be more like $5 dollars for a 30ml vial.
</p>
<p>
Lots of places sell it online. They may sell it to you with a prescription. I’ve heard of one place in the USA or maybe Canada that didn’t even ask for the prescription, but I don’t recall where it was.
</p>
<p>
This is the first that came up, list price $231 for a box of 25.

<p>
You don’t need full strength lidocaine for electrolysis and can dilute it significantly. You can probably stretch what you have out over 100ml. Sterile injectable saline should be non prescription.

How did you learn how to inject lidocaine? I don’t think many doctors would prescribe it. Maybe I should have asked mine.

I did electrolysis for about 6 months. Originally going into it, I was going to do my face but was told it would be a two hour service at $50/hour (actually a really great price) but that’s all out of pocket so it adds fairly quickly. To see if it worked and if I could financially afford it, I decided to do my brows first.
</p>
<p>
After 6 months of weekly visits, I can say only the most dedicated individuals with disposable income will find benefit from it. I still have a good many hairs that grow where it was treated, but can tell that some hairs that didn’t grow back.
</p>
<p>
From a pain perspective, the eyebrows aren’t the most sensitive areas. Sometimes it would sting and other times it was a tickling feeling. I could imagine the face being pretty painful because of coarser hair. In short, imagine getting a wax on a part of the body; the pain is more intense depending on the area of the body.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I’d try laser for the reduction of hair. While I haven’t had laser, I think the price and expedience of results are more suited for the time and budget sensitive individuals. For prospective SRS women, electrolysis might be the best option - my opinion, only get that area done and use laser for everything else.
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps!

well, technically trans wimen can go through menopause when our hormones are out of wack, like missing doses. and there&#39;s a lot of anecdotal evidence that a good portion experience period symptoms. and even though it doesn&#39;t have a uterus, the body still tries to imitate that monthly cycle in the ways it can. rollercoaster emotions, food craving&#39;s, cramps, diarhea, etc.

Many trans women deeply desire all those things. I&#39;ve never wanted to have kids, but I wish I could have a period so much.

Yes we do. It&#39;s a lot of work and preparation before you get to the hospital.
