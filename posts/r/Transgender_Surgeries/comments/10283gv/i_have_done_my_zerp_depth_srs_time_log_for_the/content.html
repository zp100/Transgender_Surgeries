hello guys! After so many years of preparation, i have come to my last chapter of my journeyðŸ˜‚ ok i will keep everything short and i hope i can help those who r still considering which type of srs suit her.
</p>
<p>
I have done the srs in Kamol hospiral, which is one of the surgeon in Thailand. The major reason I chose dr kamol was it seems only dr kamol has the option of srs ppv, which is a relatively new technique for transwoman, though for my personal reason i changed my mind to zero depth srs.
</p>
<p>
I came to Thailand alone and when I arrived at the airportat around 6pm. kamol team sent someone to pick up you at the airport. Basically there is nothing you need to worry about. They will just drive you to K Garden directly.
</p>
<p>
After the first night, they called me in the morning and asked my to the counter of the hotel. They drove me to the hospital, which is ridiculously close to the hotelðŸ˜‚. After i arrived the hospital, they did the registration and basic checking (height and weight , blood pressure etc).
</p>
<p>
After all these were done, i was told to wait for an hour to see dr kamol. He is a nice guy but not very good in English tbh. He explained very briefly the srs and check my bottom to confirm i am ok for the srs. He also confirmed with me the exact date of the surgery and cost.
</p>
<p>
After seeing dr kamol, i was send to do x ray and blood test. The nurse is quick and professional. After these were done, I was free to go.
</p>
<p>
I had few days before the surgery so I visited some places in bangkok. Basically they just wouldnt bother me at all to some points I worried that they have forgotten meðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
1 day before the surgery, i got a call from the hotel in the morning snd asked me to pack up my stuff and moved to the hospital. Before I go, i can choose to check out the room or leave the belongings in the room but of course need to pay. At the end I just chose to keep the room as i knew I may not be so capable of packing and unpacking after the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I only brought underwear, laptop, iphone and charger and some clothes just as spare. Then they directly sent me to the hospital room. The room is quite similar to the hotel room actually and the nurses were super nice. However ,after admitted in the hospital, i am not allowed to go anywhere as they said because covid19. food panda is not allowed too. So i suggest at least bring some snacks with you otherwise you will only have what the hospital provide to eat.
</p>
<p>
When settled down, they let me pay the balance of the surgery and let me rest. Because i am zero depth srs, it seems i am not required to have enema so early. I was just let alone and slept.
</p>
<p>
On the day of surgery, at around 10am the nurse came and informed me that my surgery would be 530pm. At around 11am the psychology doctor had a discussion with me. I told him my hrt history and i have done my testicles removed long tome ago and he was fine with my progress. At 12nn i have my enema, which wad only one time procedure. At around 5pm, i was set to go.
</p>
<p>
They will let you sat on the wheelchair (cannot with phone) and then brought me to the surgeon room. And then they started the anesthesia. For me, the surgery was done in few seconds.
</p>
<p>
After i woke up, i realized that i was im at the &#34;recovery room&#34; with all the medical equipment with me, checking my heart beat and blook pressure. I was told that it was 12am but i was super tired so i was very blurred until 5am. At around 6am they sent me back to my hospitsl room.
</p>
<p>
It was harsh from day 1 to day 3. I am plugged with catheter and a tube for injectiom of mophine. I couldnt move at all and i was only able to sleep on my back. This caused my back so much pain which actually exceeded the pain caused by the wound.
</p>
<p>
They would change the dressing twice a day (no pain at all). And there r 3 meals a day, i can chose mostly soup and no normal food was allowed.
</p>
<p>
The pain was acceptable and the level of pain slowly reduced. The first 2 days I got mophine every 3~4 hours and after that normally painkiller is ok for me.
</p>
<p>
I am able to stand and walk for few steps on day 3 and able to poo on  day 4 (no pain). I was discharged from the hospitsl on day 5 and back to my hotel room.
</p>
<p>
On day 7 my catheter was removed. However , before removal of the catheter i was required to drink a lot of water and they only removed my catheter after making sure i can pee. The first time i pee as a woman was amazing (no pain). The removal of catheter did cause little pains but i was fine after few hours.
</p>
<p>
After the removal of catheter, i was pretty much back to normal, except for i cant sit for a long time. I can walk quite normally . This is improving day by day and on day 8 day would remove thr stitches . At around day 10, i felt 80% recovered and pain free already.
