Heya,
</p>
<p>
We are almost 3 months after srs. My wife had bleedings until the last few weeks. It wasnt a lot, but visible in the pad she is wearing in hear underwear. We started using a magic wand for relaxation/inserting the dilators. I have had no bleeding since a lot of weeks, but it really depends on the person. You could try to use a magic wand + be more careful and slower while dilating. Maybe this will help.

Smell, We only get a smell when using no Betadine for 1 1/2+ Weeks. We use a &#34;bidet&#34; on a two daily base because we want to clean out the canal after dilation. (

I had a kinda painful/numb feeling in my finger tips for more than 40 days, it kept getting less over time, and is now fully vanished. Maybe its the same but with your feet?.

My last inch is also very sensitive like yours. But I think its normal, no bleeding, no pain after dilating/while holding the dilator in, and no smell of an infection. I have an appointment at my woman doctor for today to look at everything.

This happened to me too! I didn&#39;t know what to make of it but since it went away by itself I just kind of forgot about it. I wonder what causes it?
