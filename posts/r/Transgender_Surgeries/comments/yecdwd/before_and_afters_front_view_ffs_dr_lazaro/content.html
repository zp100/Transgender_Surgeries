TransOp does such great nose work. You look fantastic, but I always look at the noses done there. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Yes dr Cardenas wife does the noses! She specializes in it. His entire team has a very natural approach which is what I love! You don‚Äôt come out looking ‚Äúobviously worked on‚Äù to people that don‚Äôt know you. Drastic changes but subtle at the same time. I didn‚Äôt want that Hollywood plastic surgery obvious look if you know what I mean lol

I know exactly what you mean. I&#39;m kinda going drastic though. I&#39;ve got an identical twin brother, if I don&#39;t get aggressive, I&#39;ll always be his identical twin brother. Hopefully I can get results I&#39;m hoping for.

The key to a good outcome with Cardenas is communication. You need to be detailed and specific about what you want and your expectations for every single procedure.

i love his wife‚Äôs work too! im going to him but hoping to acheive dramatic yet natural results. Do u think if aomeone discusses like them they would prefer on the more agressive or dramatic side than subtle that he would be open to and capable of that too or just say its not his thing or?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong from my before and afters it‚Äôs definitely a dramatic change. When i say subtle I‚Äôm meaning I still look like myself. He definitely feminized my features tremendously but I don‚Äôt look like a completely different person. I told him to be as aggressive he could on my forehead and he was.

oh okay sorry, i didnt mean your results i meant what hes comfortable trying to acheive, i thought subtle meaning like only slight changes, dramatic but natural i think is the ideal! but still, id accept looking a bit overdone vs having hardly a noticable change though haha

Oh no I didn‚Äôt take offense! I understand what you‚Äôre saying. You want a very dramatic change where you look a lot different. I‚Äôm sure that can be achieved. Another thing I had partial FFS, I didn‚Äôt have my jaw or chin done, I‚Äôm sure it would have made me look more different though lol I‚Äôm considering that now with a lip lift (scared of the scare though)

oh okay! i was wondering if you didnor didnt cuz somehow your chin and jawine look slimmer and sharper afterwards but i didnt recal u saying you had, i was gonna ask bone shaving or ostectomy but you had none! haha i guess just overall benefits from the work on other area? üòÜ idk
</p>
<p>
yea im hoping to still look like my sellf for sure! im thinking more like‚Ä¶ so im getting hairline asvancement with brow lift (and id been contemplting blephoroplasty but forgoing it in hopes the lifting of the brow will correct the sagginess of the lids) didnt know if i said go as high as he could if he wouldnt want to make too big a change? idk haha if that makes sense i trust him to be honest with me though, he was very understanding in the virtual appointment! injust didnt get around to mentioning too specifically about my ideal outcomes (but i‚Äôll have another consult in person with him before the surgery date so..)
</p>
<p>
sorry to ramble üòÇ

oh i was gonna say too, isnt the lip lift and rhino scar both in the same incision? i was a little on the fence about rhino but gungho on my lip lift so that made me more inclided to go ahead with the rhino since i‚Äôll get the scar anyway so might as well knock out two in one haha

Oh no, no scaring with the rhino. They do a new approach now. Complete open rhino without cutting the middle part of the nose so it leaves no scar. She made my Nostrils smaller but the scar blends with the natural crease of them. Now with a lip lift they have to go under the nose and there is a cut straight across to lift the upper lip and that‚Äôs noticeable. Honestly I have naturally big lips to begin with so I didn‚Äôt see it making that huge of a change. Thing is you get some things done and just want more üò¨ I pass 100% so honestly I don‚Äôt see myself getting anything else anytime soon face wise..If anything I‚Äôll probably just have my jaw done. Now I do plan on going back and having fat transfers to hips with buttock implants. I meet another trans girl while there who had lower FFS with Cardenas years ago who had her body done. She looked awesome! Not overly done with the body but enough to give her BODYYYYYYY.

thats so strange! i wonder if because of the mature of our rhinoplastys are different, thag theyre being done different way? cardenas told me it will be two in the same scar üòÖ im primarily having my tip deprojected but also dorsal hump lowering and nostrils lowering and hopefully they can fix my collapsed nasal vavle!
</p>
<p>
so around the alar crease is cut? im having a hard time imagining how they access the nose without the typical scarring üò¶ or they go in through forhead or? haha im so lost, but thats great they can do that. maybe i‚Äôll have to ask and double check to re-clarify the expectation of how my proceedures will be done ü´¢
</p>
<p>
i havent even had my first ffs but i am planning to come for a second round üòÜ so dont feel bad! if it seems addicting after getting it then im pre-addicted i guess? haha  i expect to want hair transplants to hide the scar (and thicken my thinned hair in front), and possibly face lift because i have a weak recessed chin with lots of skin laxity there and i heard chin work can increase that problem (since taking away bone may leave the skin looser? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and BBL as well!
</p>
<p>
im trying to go with friends for my visits there as well! they both have had all their work so theyll give me confidence and familiar with the area and surgeons there

I didn‚Äôt, honestly my jaw and chin didn‚Äôt bother me it was the upper face and side profile ü•¥ with the work I had done it made my upper face alot softer and smaller so I‚Äôm guessing it made the bottom portion somehow look smaller too.

You look amazing! Had My FFS with him also he was great and Hatzia was a sweetheart she took care of me! Love youd nose so much! I wanted to get my nose done with him but ive had 2 prior nose jobs .. he said no I am instead getting a BBl done in Feb ialso in Guadalajara. Love the city .. how long was your recovery did you have to tell Dr Cardenas to go more aggressive on shaving your features look so beutiful and delicate seems he sometimes just does how he sees fit that is one thing I didn&#39;t like .. cheers from Salt Lake City!
