Very cute!
</p>
<p>
One of the big factors for me (I am still deciding who I want to go with) is the level of post-op care/support they provide. I know it was a while ago but how did you find it?

I had a post op review approximately 2 weeks afterwards. But I&#39;ve not had anything since. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s that great. I also to contact my GP with an issue. Where you see that red spot above the pubic bone. Blood collect and oozes here if cross my legs for example.

I had surgery at  parkside hospital where bellringer works now although I had Tina Rashid  for my surgery. They saw me 2 years post op for a checkup in February as I have been having some problems and not sure if it was related to surgery or not. if you go with them you can get post op support years afterwards and as it is NHS funded you don&#39;t have to worry about the cost and you can email them any time for advice.

Thanks for sharing your results with us ü•∞ Penile inversion?
</p>
<p>
I know it was many years ago for you, but any chance you could give us a summary of your recovery after GCS? If it&#39;s not too personal, may I please enquire about, ahem, your post-GCS experience with sex/orgasms?
</p>
<p>
Apologies in advance if these questions are too invasive. I&#39;m on the waitlist for the NHS GIC, though at the current rates I&#39;m not sure they&#39;ll ever see me to offer me any surgery, but nonetheless vaginoplasty will be a consideration for me if I&#39;m offered it.

Sorry I had too much going on after work üò¨. I spent 5x day in hospital the first two days were the hardest and most grueling. I had surgery in the morning, I remember being in agony in their recovery ward. Of course I had to put my hand down there to pat the bandages just to make sure it was really gone, this was such a relief to find it was. At the time I was crying out in agony. The nurses gave me some morphine and this immediately elevated the pain. During this first day I spent it in bed like all patients, recovering.
</p>
<p>
We were given morphine on tap with the press of a button. I went a bit excessive pressing the button and eventually made myself quite sick during the first day. Make sure you don&#39;t do this.
</p>
<p>
I spent most of the second day in bed until I was allowed to take my first few steps. At the time I was 23, I think my age helped provide a speedy recovery. From the 3rd day onwards I was walking around well and you wouldn&#39;t had thought I&#39;d just had GRS. All of the other patients spent most of that week in bed recovering, make sure you take it easy. Bring some music to pass the time, because the week in hospital is a slog.
</p>
<p>
You will be asked to bring pads, I brought thick heavy bleeding one and you wont need these. Id recommend bringing the lighter slim type. Make sure you take it easy and you&#39;ll be fine. The first time you dilate, it will be horrible.

That is quite interesting to see, my surgery was done by Tina Rashid was trained by belleinger but my results look completely different. I assumed their results would look similar

Thanks üòÅ, when I saw him in my post-OP appointment. He mentioned how it&#39;s some of his best work. I&#39;m sure most surgeons say that to their patients.
