Well hello, this is from a hospital bed. I just realized I haven&#39;t taken time (since surgery) to think back on how it has been since the surgery. I wanted to keep track of my journey and possibly help others with it.
</p>
<p>
A little background: I got my surgery in Korea. Although Korea is known for its plastic surgery business, it is mostly focused on facial surgeries with cosmetic purposes, and SRS is definitely not part of it. In fact, I was left with only a couple of options across the whole country, and even those were without much reputation - not good, not bad; just
<em>
unknown
</em>
. People here usually choose Thailand over Korea on their level of experience in the field. I chose Korea nevertheless for my own reasons.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Week 1
</strong>
</p>
<p>
They take a two-step procedure: create a vulva first, let it heal a bit, and then create the vagina. My first surgery was on July 13th. I was very misguided on the expected duration; I somehow thought of 6-8 hours. The surgery started at 8:00 AM, and I woke up around 1:30 AM the next day.
</p>
<p>
The long duration meant that I was going to be stuck with a bunch of phlegm in my throat for several days, disabling my transvoice for then. Also, the skin on the lower back (just above sacrum) were visibly and painfully swolen. (I guess the weight of the leg would put quite a burden on that skin in lithotomy position?) Later, I heard that there was a minor incident with the bladder when they were making rooms for neovagina, and a GU surgeon stitched it up. Maybe that&#39;s why it took so long?
</p>
<p>
The recovery wasn&#39;t that fun. The surgeon once asked me in round: &#34;You have a new life now, how are you feeling?&#34; But that &#39;new life&#39; felt just too far away from me yet. I couldn&#39;t really tell if PCA was helping, so I stopped pressing it after a few hours. Porridge 3 times a day wasn&#39;t that hard, but I really hated having to use diapers, so I got a bit picky on food (aiming for low residue diet).
</p>
<p>
I mostly watched TV. I don&#39;t have one at my place, so it was quite fun! It really got me through the whole time I spent in bed.
</p>
<p>
On July 18th (5 days post-op) I had a quick trip to OR to have the dressing changed. (They use a negative pressure dressing, so the site had been vacuum-sealed.) When I woke up, I felt freezingly cold and painful. The former is actually from general anesthesia; the latter turned out to be a problem in settings of the negative pressure machine.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Week 2
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The second surgery was on July 21st (8 days post-op). This time, part of the intestine is harvested to form the neovagina. I was quite excited for this day, because I would now finally be able to go to toilet on my foot, take a shower, and walk out into the world after I recover from this.
</p>
<p>
It didn&#39;t took so long (3-4 hours?). When I woke up I had that crazy chill again but I was expecting it. The pain was... surprisingly low! Maybe the excitement of finally walking out (and having the negative vacuum machine removed?) worked like analgesics for me. Sitting became a bit more manageable and I would occasionally take out my laptop and play games.
</p>
<p>
The doctor, however, wasn&#39;t so happy with the progress. There was some severe infection going around, both in the urinary parts and around the neovulva. Hematuria was persistent and the urine was either orange or red at all times. Skins and parts of the intestine got visibly yellow and they had to cut them off (no pain, fortunately, as they died, unfortunately). Mild to severe fevers would show up from time to time. Hemoglobin level was low. No, I&#39;m not going to get discharged in a week.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Week 3
</strong>
</p>
<p>
With antibiotics and other medicines the worrisome symptoms gradually disappeared. Some of the surgical site was still yellow. With a few factors (both medical and financial) considered, it was decided that I get discharged and take regular outpatient checkups. The day of the discharge was August 1st (19 days post-op).
</p>
<p>
After I got home, I realized that urinating was just too painful and is not getting any better. I found out with a mirror that the urine was not coming out from the urethra, but dribbling through an opening (not visible) between the urethra and the vaginal opening. Something must have gotten seriously wrong! I took a video.
</p>
<p>
On the next day of the discharge I had an appointment with the endo in that hospital (schedule is messed up!). The 40 minutes in taxi isn&#39;t that pleasurable. There, I met my surgeon and showed the video. With a painful cystoscope and some talk, it was decided that I get hospitalized, again, on August 4th (22 days post-op). I got a catheter back.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Week 4-5
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been hospitalized, have been taking antibiotics, getting dressing changed every day, and nothing. The infections, both in the urinary system and on the surgical site, seem to have been cleared out. Good news!
</p>
<p>
Although they wanted for me to stay a bit longer and have another surgery (mostly stitching) to make sure everything heals well, I&#39;m asking to getting discharged as soon as possible due to personal circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Today I got the catheter off. For me to get discharged, there shouldn&#39;t be much problem in urinating at least. I&#39;ve been peeing every hour or so. There&#39;s always a sharp pain at the end, and I&#39;m not sure where it is coming from.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
To sum up: with my surgery, I had a severe infection complication. It got under control after a couple of week&#39;s antibiotics. I think I&#39;m taking an unnecessarily longer way and it stresses me out a bit. I really hope this pain in urinary parts goes away as soon as possible.

Thanks, this is the first review I&#39;ve seen for a Korean SRS surgery. I&#39;ll add this to the wiki here.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve a few questions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Would you mind naming the surgeon.
</li>
<li>
Are there any links to the surgeon, hospital, etc
</li>
<li>
What did it cost?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
How much did the surgery cost?

I would actually prefer to share the names after I recover some more -- I&#39;m a bit anxious right now as to how it is going to be, and I don&#39;t really want to leave an impression too bad about them.
</p>
<p>
It cost around $25,000 in US dollars, I think. No part of it is covered by insurance.
</p>
<p>
Some other clinics I heard offer like $18,000 (peritoneal) or as low as $5,000 (without vagina), but I didn&#39;t check them out.

19 days in the Hospital is an expense no one would want to face here in the US. How did you deal with that aspect of this? The cost had to be considerably higher than what you prepared for.

I&#39;m really grateful for the surgeon and the whole PS team for that. They don&#39;t have much control over the whole expense, but they made a promise on that figure (~$25,000) and bent over backwards to cut the cost down as much as possible. The kind of effort that doesn&#39;t really do them good if known publicly, I think. :) I had to use the VIP room (the only kind of rooms that host one patient only) which cost $375 per day, and that alone accounted for one third of the whole cost. I wonder how other prices (surgery, anesthesia, injections and all) compare to those in the US as well.
