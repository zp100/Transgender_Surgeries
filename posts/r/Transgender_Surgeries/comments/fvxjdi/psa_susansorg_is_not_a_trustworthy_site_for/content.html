I had a post removed by a moderator for &#34;surgeon bashing&#34; despite the fact that I referenced a post where I very clearly spell out what the issues with my surgery were, plus I had pictures to back up my post.
</p>
<p>
I think the trans community should be aware that if you&#39;re researching surgeons then susans.org should not be considered a trustworthy source. I was not allowed to post about my own bad results there.
</p>
<p>
When I was researching surgeons I relied heavily upon contacting users on susans.org because a lot of Reddit users who went to my surgeon had apparently abandoned their accounts. I got a lot of good reports but that makes sense because anything negative would have been deleted.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion they are more worried about facing a lawsuit than they are about supporting the interests of the trans community. Any information you find there is highly likely to be biased toward people having positive experiences since negative posts are removed. I have found the wiki and FFS Facebook group to be more reliable in terms of what kinds of outcomes to expect. Had I just stuck with those sources I probably would not have gone where I did.

I was there a decade ago and it was the only place I had for support since AntiJen was effectively dead (existing but no activity.) I was chat staff there over a decade ago and resigned after a year because I realized dealing with it, particularly the way the rules were structured (we couldn&#39;t get rid of some obvious trolls) and that Susan herself would countermand us when we took actions on certain users violating the rules, was just wearing me out.
</p>
<p>
Being staff I learned a bit more of her history. There were staff-only areas and she would sometimes share links other things she had online. Through that I found information on an old blog she had that detailed what had happened in prior years. In truth she got the short end of the stick in ways that a lot of us who were out in the 90s and 00s did. But it certainly felt like she turned that into anger and bitterness and a lot of it ended up aimed toward the rest of us.
</p>
<p>
The &#34;what right do you have to question the decisions of your doctor/therapist&#34; issue has been a problem there for so long. I directly ran into it, even so far as my therapist and doctors pressuring me to have vaginoplasty to &#34;complete transition&#34; (and that they would take away HRT if I didn&#39;t have it within a few years) when I had serious doubts about that surgery being appropriate for me. It would happen again as I worked on getting a surgery letter and my therapist made it clear that I would only get that letter if it was for Brassard or Djordjevic (before you ask: the only thing I know is that she had observed vaginoplasty performed by those two. I presume she decided this made her better qualified than her trans clients to make the decision.) At Susan&#39;s I kept being told &#34;if your doctor and therapist say this is best for you it&#39;s because they know having it will improve your life.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I was ultimately banned a few years later. I had a very difficult recovery and a nasty bout of post-surgery depression about a month after. The effect of that depression was that I suddenly felt severe regret. I posted asking for support and that was the moment it all went to hell for me. I was accused of working with anti-LGBT groups, there were claims I was doing it for attention, attempts to connect me to various TERF-made detransition stories, etc. Even claims that I had lied about having vaginoplasty in the first place , featuring a staff member who had ordered flowers to be delivered to me at the recovery residence joined in that thread to agree with the claim that I hadn&#39;t had surgery.
</p>
<p>
I had poor surgery results and complications, including one since determined to require surgical correction. I contacted Brassard&#39;s office asking for a consultation about possible revision and was denied. I posted about that. I was told that I was slandering Brassard.
</p>
<p>
Also, Susan was banned from reddit a few years ago for brigading. It happened on a post about her site.

I&#39;m getting there. Being banned proved to be a good thing for it. In time I also weeded out a lot of those people from my social media connections (seriously, after I was banned a tried to connect on FB, etc., to continue the attacks, even as they said on Susan&#39;s that they were glad to never have to deal with me again.) Divorce also helped - my ex was the final part of going through surgery I did not want, giving me an ultimatum in which she promised to make me suffer if I canceled as I wanted to one month before my surgery date. If she hadn&#39;t done that and instead supported me I would have canceled.

Unfortunately they have been doing that for years. I’d prefer that didn’t allow posts on surgeons at all because it gives a misleading bias and very few people are aware of it. The same happens with HRT and diy. It wouldn’t be so bad if people were directed to look elsewhere to supplement their knowledge, but that’s strictly not allowed. So you get people who end up on the site, like it, and stay there, not even knowing what they are lacking. It provides a different style of community to other sites which appeals to some, but comes at quite a high cost which many are unaware of.
</p>
<p>
Facebook is also quite biased, possibly more so. You’ll see a significantly shift surgeons popular there compared to elsewhere, and I think it’s due to commercial activity.
</p>
<p>
Reddit is quite difficult to market to due to the way it works and I don’t think anyone bothers. This was part of the point of
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/exrxnh/rule_6_posts_from_those_with_a_commercial/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=Transgender_Surgeries&amp;utm_content=t5_3e7kl">rule 6
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Personally I try not to talk about my preferred surgeons anymore and just provide very generic help for similar reasons. I’ve too much influence here for it to be fair.
</p>
<p>
I wrote about some of this in the wiki, but I think I should update it.

I don’t understand the reference to Jazz. She was doing TV work years before surgery. I expect she knows exactly what she is doing by now.
</p>
<p>
The rebates are not good, but they do get exposed in occasion. The good thing about reddit is those rebates don’t work as well as on other sites. If someone pops up with a single review and that’s their entire post history it’s kind of obvious you shouldn’t take it too seriously. That’s not the case on Facebook.

There&#39;s no way of  knowing why she started, but I think its turned out to her advantage now. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s learned a lot from it that will benefit her in the future.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think all surgeons are the same either. They are just people at the end of the day and some of them will be decent and caring, and others will be at the other end. Its one of the things I think about a lot when picking mine.

<p>
Have you noticed that there can be a shift over time ? Many start out caring and later seem to get jaded. For some its just another person amongst many others. With some surgeons there seems to be some kind of sweet spot ... where they still are caring and have aquired enough experience to be really good. Without naming people, there was a shift visible later in a number of surgeons.

I&#39;m not sure the reason for it, but I have noticed some that get really uniformly good reviews early on then later on start to get the usual complaints like everyone else. Maybe they try harder early on, but it could also be just good luck on their part when the sample is small.

Many have good reviews for being caring, for showing compassion and for really trying to help people. It seems to get lost later on in a business like attitude, where people are kind of reduced to anonymous clients, and where they are much less treated like individuals, with individual issues that may need tending to. There are not that many surgeons who really try to help as many clients as they can later on.
</p>
<p>
Its like they start out with compassion and a helpful attitude that wears down over time. As said, looking for a surgeon somewhere in the middle might be an idea, where they still have a caring attitude and where they have aquired enough experience to be really good at what they do.
</p>
<p>
I don´t think its only sample size. You can see it in the way the reviews are written. Reviews from early times of a surgeon often show more personal involvement of them.
</p>
<p>
Maybe its also some distance from bad experiences that make them withdraw later on. But as said imo its really visible for many.

It makes sense, but I’ve not looked into it enough to have an opinion on it.
</p>
<p>
I’m not personally interested in new surgeons as there’s not enough information available to check them out properly, and I really don’t like taking risks.

Well concerning surgeons a few things from
<a href="https://bigclosetr.us/topshelf/blog/33917/dilation-school" rel="nofollow">this
</a>
post may be interesting for you :
</p>
<p>
&#34;After SRS, when those tissues are inside, some conversion of tissues
<em>
may
</em>
occur. The genital &#34;external skin&#34;, which always had fewer layers of keratinized cells, and less keratin in those cells, may lose even more of the keratin production -- becoming similar to the unkeratinized lining of the mouth. This happens simply because there is no longer a need for protection from moisture loss (the skin is moist most of the time anyway), and there is no exposure to UV light to stimulate the keratinocytes that produce the keratin in surface skin. As such, this lower keratin level means that moisture can seep through the skin easily when the tissues in that area become engorged with fluid -- as they do, when we become aroused. Mixing with the proteins and fatty oils of the apocrine glands, the result of this moisture is not dissimilar to the secretions of a GG&#39;s vagina... especially since the vagina soon becomes populated with the same balance of natural flora that produces a GG&#39;s distinctive &#34;odour&#34;.&#34;
</p>
<p>
So basically there may be some tissue changes over time towards what cis people have. I have talked to a number of people who confirmed it and one person said she had this confirmed by a tissue test of her OBGyn. And the process may be easier with scrotal skin because its thinner.
</p>
<p>
So peritoneal methods, which may have some unknown long term risks, may not be essential. Using a surgeon with a well known reputation who doesn´t offer it yet may be an equally good solution.
</p>
<p>
I personally would prefer a surgeon who creates looks like in the video at the January lecture of Thai surgeons. But it would be necessary to aquire more in depth information, and to try to work around possible downsides. Hopefully more experienced surgeons start to also offer this kind of look. Having the entrance framed right from the start imo is a big improvement.

Jazz Jennings knew the risks of surgery and has said she&#39;s happy with her final result. I doubt she would want anyone to refer to her as botched, jesus christ

Erm, Jazz&#39;s surgery wasn&#39;t botched. She suffered an unfortunate complication, but one that can happen with
<em>
any
</em>
surgeon. Every surgeon out there will explain that there is a small chance that that complication could happen -- it&#39;s rare, but certainly not unheard of, and unfortunately sometimes those things happen. You cannot avoid occasional complications when surgery is performed by humans, and humans are imperfect creatures. At any rate, things were corrected and she&#39;s happy with her results -- that&#39;s not botched, that&#39;s just a result that took a little longer to achieve than some other folks.

Based on what you said do you think I should delete my recent post where I name my surgeon and discuss my experience?

If surgeons are offering to fix things for being quiet then taking it down right now might be the wrong approach. I would however be careful not to say anything that you can’t back up or that can be taken as libel.

That&#39;s kind of a shitty attitude. You&#39;re right in that I don&#39;t owe anything to anyone, however if everyone had that attitude subs like this would quickly die.

So sorry you&#39;re being downvoted for this.  You don&#39;t keep others warm by setting yourself on fire.

Honestly the creep factor of that website set my transition back at least 5, probably closer to 7 years.

Sameeee. I went there years ago and was scared back into the closet for 6 more years. I’m 40 now and I STILL resent that place. Luckily all is well now but my transition would have been much easier had I done it earlier.

I know Susan herself pushes a certain surgeon. One that gave her free surgeries. Another member there who often talks about her wealth posts always about a particular clinic. She talks about running a fund organization that helps local trans girls get surgeries in that clinic. More than once I suspected she has money invested in that clinic. Other surgeons can&#39;t even be mentioned or Susan will delete the entire thread.

Much as Susan’s disappoints me, I’d like to clarify a few points. I don’t want to say too much as it may be private, but I think you’re working on incomplete knowledge and building it up to be more than it is.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Most people who have had successful surgeries do that. It’s really hard to avoid and I don’t think she’s overboard with it.
</p>

<p>
I don’t think she deletes posts by other surgeon for that reason, though they do go totally overboard with moderation for other reasons.

<p>
I’m quite certain Susan doesn’t have any money in that clinic. I doubt the other member does, but it also doesn’t matter either way.

I think people are letting their dislike for the site cloud their judgement. Susan’s is just as trustworthy as reddit for the posts you read, the problem is the posts that have been removed by moderators. That bias is the issue, making surgeons appear better than they are.
</p>
<p>
There’s plenty of people here on reddit who also also post on susans, or used to in the past. It doesn’t make them any less reliable.
