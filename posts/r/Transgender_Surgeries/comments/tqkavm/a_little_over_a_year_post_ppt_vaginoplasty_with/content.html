The 24th marked 1 year after my surgery. I haven&#39;t dilated consistently in the past 4 months or so but I still have 2-3 inches in depth. In terms of how it&#39;s going I think everything&#39;s healed up by now and everything&#39;s fine.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t end up getting the revision as I didn&#39;t receive a call back from Gallagher&#39;s assistant to schedule everything after she told me she&#39;d call back closer to the date I wanted. They also never picked up my calls. I ended up quitting my job due to having issues paying the medical debt and keeping up with rising costs with what I was getting paid, so I&#39;m definitely not getting any revision this year. When I do end up getting a revision at this point it most probably won&#39;t be with Gallagher. Especially after she told me she would probably have to go for a skin graft to get my depth back, defeating the whole purpose of the surgery, without talking about any other options.

And you lost 4 inches because of lack of dialation?

I&#39;m just curious why you stopped consistently dilating after everything you&#39;d had to deal with? Was it a matter of staying motivated because of all the the other circumstances?
</p>
<p>
Do you think it&#39;s possible that they didn&#39;t call back or return your calls because you spoke up about your experience?

Motivation definitely had a lot to do with it. That and pain because it might&#39;ve healed a bit weird.

I have no idea. Looking at her Facebook and such it&#39;s almost entirely filled with trans men. As it is I&#39;d probably say it&#39;s because I&#39;m not the group she wants to support.
