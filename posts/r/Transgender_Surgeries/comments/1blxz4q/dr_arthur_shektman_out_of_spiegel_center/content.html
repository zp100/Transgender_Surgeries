Has anyone had any experience with this doctor? I had a consultation with Dr. Spiegel and am getting VFS . He said I could get a BA at the same time with Dr. Shektman. I would love to knock out both surgeries at the same time. Any experience with Dr. Shektman for breast augmentation?

Funny enough, I just had surgery with Dr Shektman. I do NOT reccomend him as a surgeon! He is poor with any specialized: BA on a trans body, lipo on an awkward body. 99% of the time does NOT consult with or meet with his patients prior to surgery, he may do a 1-2 minute pop in to just say ‚ÄúI can do that.‚Äù GO SEE A SURGEON who has a meaningful discussion with you ahead of time and comes to understand your body, desired results, and realistic results. When I did finally get to talk to him after I was drugged right before surgery, he made a scoffing comment at my question a out my desired results and the nurse (all of the nurses are great), got embarrassed on his behalf and tried to course-correct his comment.

I‚Äôm so sorry about this and your experience. Do you like the results at least? I decided against the Spiegel center. I had a consult with Dr. Shektman and he blew me off during the whole consult. He told me round implants under the muscle is the only way he will do me. We didn‚Äôt talk about profiles, I asked him about difference between gummy bear and regular silicone implant and he acted irritated. He also misgendered me lmao ü§£

Oh I see why you said that. Because of the negative reviews for Spiegel. I feel like those are for his FFS , his VFS results seem positive.

Thank you for your comment. I see you pop up on so many threads and whenever I see you comment I know there‚Äôs a reason why and use your links for further research. You have saved me from going with a few surgeons
