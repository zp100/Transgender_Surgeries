Hi! Congratulations and I wish you a full and easy recovery! X
</p>
<p>
Facial team are my first choice and I‚Äôve had a consultation with them. May I ask?  Did you go with their recommendations only or did you opt for further treatments?

I actually went to them with a set idea of things I wanted. The jaw and chin contouring/genioplasty, brow bone reconstruction, lip lift, cheek fat grafts, rhinoplasty and trachea shave. They said in their opinion that nothing was really necessary for me, but agreed that it would have a positive feminising/aesthetic improvement.
</p>
<p>
They didn&#39;t reccomend me any more procedures and when I actually arrived for my consultation, Dr Bellinga said he wouldn&#39;t reccomend a lip lift for me and would instead do fat grafts to the lips instead. I was a little conflicted because I really thought I needed this surgery but he clearly explained why I shouldn&#39;t get it, and from asking a bunch of friends and strangers online they agreed as well.
</p>
<p>
Ovrall they&#39;re super nice and honest which I really appreciated. Just gonna be waiting a while for swelling to go down to judge the results.

Do you have to go back and get more fat grafts or is it just a one-off treatment?

Potentially - it depends on the person. The doctor says that although quite a few people lose 40-50% of the fat due to reabsorption and require further grafts, it&#39;s completely up to chance. Some people retain almost all of the fat, so they&#39;re hesitant to overfill in case some peoples cheeks look massive - and those who need it can always get more pt in.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll see later this year whether I should get some more fat grafts or not.

Hope you don‚Äôt mind my asking, do you mind saying what sort of price this cost? I‚Äôm looking for essentially all you‚Äôve had done, with The Facial Team - I really like their work - albeit in a few years time; I‚Äôm 9 months on HRT and I feel like I should give a minimum of two years to see what HRT can do for my face first.

It&#39;s wild that at 4 days, even with bandages on, you can already tell that it&#39;s a great result. There are still months of major healing to go, even.
</p>
<p>
Congrats! I&#39;ll be seeing them at the end of next month, getting excited here :)

Yeah I&#39;m apparently super lucky and in the top 5% of patients to heal this smoothly. Haven&#39;t had any major bruising or swelling within the first few days aside from what&#39;s expected. The only darker spot I have is by my eye and lip. So its very ymmv.
</p>
<p>
Just really grateful that I&#39;m healing so well - the pictures I&#39;ve seen of other people right after surgery looked a lot more brutal

Thanks, and I felt absolutely awful lmao. The first night was the worst pain and discomfort ever and I looked like a balloon covered in blood and bandages.
</p>
<p>
Sleeping with the nose blocks in, blood drainage, and the cooling mask sucked ass adn was really difficult. But the next day was a lot easier without all of those and as of about 6 days post op now I&#39;m feeling a toooooon better
