I love the photo of you in the hospital bed - I had mine just over a year ago, in late August of 2021. I had my vaginoplasty done in Tijuana, Mexico, so it wasn&#39;t a traditional US hospital setting, instead I was in a tiny mini-hospital/clinic for the first two nights (where my actual surgery was done), and then they moved me to a medical recovery place (like an extended stay hotel, but with nurses) for the remaining 9 days or so. But they did have standard hospital beds just like the one you are in, and I did have that
<em>
very gender-affirming
</em>
experience of lying there just like you in your photo, and spreading my legs for the aftercare doctor to take care of my newly minted cooch. In other words, your photo very much reminds me of where I was a year ago, and it&#39;s just a magickal experience. Congratulations, sister!
</p>
<p>
And yes, I had my significant other with me too - she has been my rock throughout my transition.

I have a consultation with Dr Dy next year. I was wondering how the whole process was for you as in terms of getting electrolysis done. I‚Äôve tried to speak to someone at OHSU regarding pre surgical electrolysis but I haven‚Äôt received a call back and I‚Äôm wanting to jump on that already and i was wondering if you have any suggestions to get it taken care of. Did you go through your insurance or pay out of pocket? All of this is new and overwhelming and just want to make sure I‚Äôm not forgetting any steps. Thank you

How long was your surgery date after your consultation? I‚Äôm hoping to get bumped up a little once I have everything sent over and get hair removal going.

It was a mess. I was told so many things, and they kept changing things on me. I eventually got two weeks notice for surgery.
</p>
<p>
Consult january. Surgery sept on short notice list.
</p>
<p>
If I wasn‚Äôt on the list I would have had surgery late 2023
