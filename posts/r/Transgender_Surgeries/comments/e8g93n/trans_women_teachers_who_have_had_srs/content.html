Im  not a teacher, im a hairdresser. I started STANDING again  at work after 5 weeks. We have a bench at work wich reminds me of a school  bench... and i could not sit on that or anything hard for 8-9 weeks for to long.
</p>
<p>
So as a tescher standing and a little sitting should be fine

What was your recovery like at that point? How did you manage dilation then? Was it a non-issue?

Oh i had a surgeon  in England  and i only know of him doing it completely different. So my dilation started with 9 weeks after surgery and only once a day for 30 min for 6 months. And then only once a week. So i didnt really have strict routine hun.

That&#39;s so different from what I see most other people talking about!
</p>
<p>
Did he explain why he does it so differently? Do you feel like you would have benefited from a more traditional routine?

No not at all as aesthetically its perfect ( had two minor revisions to make her prettier.
</p>
<p>
And no not at a as others tell me they have to dilate all their life and before sex. I dont. I just need lube and i can start, and i have 5 and a half inch to 6 inch depth depending on how well i relax  during  dilation or sex. I dilated 2 weeks ago. And still have sex with my partner. So its all good

Yes hes amazing. Just a shame others dont do it like him. It would save slot of girls all that dilation.
</p>
<p>
But hes retiring 2020, hes been doing it 30 years.
</p>
<p>
And he said, if the muscles  are safely and correctly  seperated dilation is not necessary  for life. He said he has patients  that  stopped completely  after a year. So thats good.

Not a teacher, just to be clear. Most surgeons recommend at least 6 weeks before returning to work, although you&#39;ll be back on your feet well before that. 3 months should be more than enough time, and at that point it&#39;s mostly a matter of working dilation into your routine. I dropped from 3x daily to 2x daily at the three-month mark, but different surgeons have different dilating schedules so it depends on what they suggest.
</p>
<p>
I think if you can get surgery right after school lets out for the summer, you should be fine by the time it starts back up again in the fall (barring any unforeseen complications, anyway.)

It gets
<em>
much
</em>
easier once you drop down to 2x daily. But a lot of folks are able to work in 3x daily by doing it morning, right after work, then right before bed. That don&#39;t have to be perfectly evenly spaced.

No. They need to be spread out, but it doesn&#39;t have to be exactly equal. Besides, at the point that you might be returning to work, the initial healing should be pretty well done, so it won&#39;t be as critical as it might&#39;ve been earlier on. There&#39;s wiggle room with the middle dilation time. Lors of people find ways to make it work, and with most surgeons you just need to post through it for 2-3 months and then you can drop down to 2x daily.

YMMV but three months should be enough. I&#39;m a grad student and was able to give classes by week 5 (though walking funny and not being able to properly sit yet -- both normalized by week 6).

I was signed off for 8 weeks last year. You will need that time away if your having penile inversion you will be dilating 3 times a day every day for 8 weeks. Then once your done all you will want to do is rest up  because its so exhausting. It takes about and hour each time with prep, shower etc..
</p>
<p>
Moreover if you don&#39;t recover properly you will cause a complication which you really don&#39;t want stitches can come out tears can happen.
</p>
<p>
Ive known stiches to come out one the way home and from over exertion. I was rushing my douching tore a stich out and caused some awfull granulation that hasnt fully healed 15 months in.
</p>
<p>
I cant stress this enough Don&#39;t mess around with your recovery.

Im a high school librarian. Im having mine this summer so i have 6 weeks scheduled. My office knows i may be on light duty so ill be not as useful the first  part of school when we are the busiest, my coworkers are just going to cover me if necessary. I feel kinda bad but its better than taking a ton of time off in the year.

That&#39;s great to hear they will support you. I&#39;m worried because I won&#39;t have other people to help, and depending on my job, I will be going school to school working with students one-on-one. Ideally, I think it might be best if I schedule surgery for the first of June and leave early. I&#39;m not sure

True. But even then I can imagine 3 months would be more than enough. Most people I talked to said they were mostly functional after 6 weeks but they also weren’t exactly running marathons. Even if you are one on one I cant imagine you would totally be standing the entire time (unless its elementary age kids). As for dilation....Michigan dosent exactly have a great track record on trans issues so it depends on your district. They may be able to provide a space for you much like they provide a space for mothers to do breast pumps as long as your doctor has a note for it

I actually am a professor, but I was on sabbatical when I had srs. I really had a turn around at 5 weeks or so. Two months and I was back to normal energy levels. I have gauges  by my Fitbit. Three months later I was on a beach vacation with my future husband and in-laws who don’t know I amtransgender. Four months later was our wedding. If you have an early June surgery, you will be just fine.

Thank you! How have you liked being a professor? What do you teach? I&#39;m hoping to be in that spot in down the road!

Hi. I teach English Literature and Writing. I enjoying being a professor, but I wish I were teaching someplace other than where I transitioned. I pass, to use a problematic term, but there is a point where students hear through the grapevine that I am transgender. No one is mean, but students cut me far less slack when they know I am and hold me to a higher standard. Life is not miserable, but people who know about my history treat me differently from people who do not. I have adjusted and am resigned to this life. And I have close friends and colleagues!!
