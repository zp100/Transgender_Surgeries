<h2>
1. Personal background
</h2>
<p>
I&#39;m a 26 year-old heterosexual MtF, HRT started from 2019, socially living as a female. The gender markers showed on my IDs are &#39;F&#39; as in my country it does not require surgery certificates to change it.
</p>
<p>
Initially I booked the surgery for the end of 2022 - but delayed twice due to my crashing schedules... Prior to the SRS, I underwent a glattoplasty (voice feminisation surgery) back in 2021, result is fantastic. I have to mention this to the medical team as it does affect the intubation during general anaethesia.
</p>
<p>
Why Dr Chett? In my country you have to wait 1+ year to get the SRS, and the outcomes are unstable. Unfortunately my insurance does not cover overseas SRS, so I have to find a balance between results and cost. Dr Bank is overpriced to me plus my scheduling is tight - which their mile-long waiting list would not fit me. In comparison, it&#39;s fairly easy to find a date with Dr Chett that accomodate your desire.
</p>
<p>
Technique: Non-penile inversion skin graft.
</p>
<p>
I regard myself as a mentally stable and strong person, extremely optimistic, who is capable to live alone in abroad. I&#39;m not a body trainer, but I have enough muscles on my upper arms and thighs, which are enough to support basic movements in the first week after the surgery before I regain power of my body. My tolerence to pain is high.

The most useful tools are:

the grabby thingy

and
<strong>
the hiking pole
</strong>
. Get high-quality ones, as you will be using them a lot.

<h2>
3. In Thailand -
<em>
pre-op
</em>
</h2>
<p>
I was told to stop my HRT two weeks prior the surgery, and is allowed to continue HRT once I leave Thailand.
</p>
<p>
Landing in Thailand and passing the immigration was pretty smooth. A driver from WIH will take you to the hospital. Once settled in, you will be placed on the 7th floor, which are all pre-op people. You will be informed for the date of consultation (mine was the next day).
</p>
<p>
On the next day, the nurse will ask you to write a medical questionnaire - e.g. food/med allergies, past surgery history, medications
<em>
etc
</em>
. During the consultation, Dr Chett will examine your genital area and take some pictures. He said my dysphoria stick is small - but it&#39;s not a problem for the skin graft technique (I&#39;m sure he says the same thing to many people). This is the opportunity to ask all your questions, so do prepare a list of questions. If you have any left-over lab checks haven&#39;t done, they will be done after the consultation. A blood sample was somehow haemolysed, so they have to redraw my blood.
</p>
<p>
The most important thing pre-op is bowel cleaning, if you&#39;re doing colon or PPV I believe the procedures will be stricter. It&#39;s a two-day procedure, the first day (d-2) I was only allowed to take clear liquid diet. On the second day (d-1), I was given sodium phosphate
<em>
2
</em>
45mL, which tasted really bad. I have to mix 45 mL of sodium phosphate with 1mL of green tea to finish it. At the end of the day, I was moved upstairs, to floor 8 which accomodates post-op patients. There was no solid stool, everything was clear as urine, and indeed it was a requirement for the surgery.
</p>
<h2>
4. In Thailand -
<em>
post-op
</em>
</h2>
<p>
My surgery (d0) started in the morning and when I awoke again it was around 4pm. No significant pain but felt very tired. I started to urinate (with the catheter) once back to the ward. The next day (d1) I felt some pain and tightness down there, around 4/10, but manageable. Apart from the epidural pump, I also took oral paracetamol occasionally. On d1, I regained my leg movement, which is a good sign. Was put on clear liquid diet (clear chicken broth) until d3.
</p>
<p>
On d3, it was when the drain tube and epidural pump were being removed. The epidural I barely feel anything so it was completely fine. However, for the two drain tube part, I felt the worst pain in my life - like 10/10. It feels like two sharp knives being extracted from the bottom and the blade was sliding out along my body from my internal organs. The procedure took one minute but felt like one hour.
</p>
<p>
From d4 to d6 was when I felt my recovery significantly. I regained the ability to walk (with catheter), from 5 minutes (d4, very tired afterward) to comfortably walk outside the ward and chat with other girls on the same floor (d6).
</p>
<p>
On d7, when the pressure packaging should be removed, I took one tramadol 30 minutes before the nurses came. I had a panic attack as I still remember the pain on d3. My legs were shaking involuntarily which made the nurses difficult to operate. However, when the nurse (Sri) started to pull the clothes out, I barely feel pain but only discomfort. The feeling is &#34;strange&#34;, which is hard to describe. In the next two minutes, I witnessed a cloth appx.1 meter was pulled out of my neovagina, it was defiantly mind-blowing 🤯!!! Sri measured the depth of it and turned to be appx. 6.5in. But i figured out it&#39;s close to 6in as there were swelling which made it looks deeper.
</p>
<p>
On d8, when the first dilation began. It&#39;s slightly tight at the entrance, probably due to the pelvic muscle (it will be tight for a long time due to surgical trauma). Once the head of the dilator passed the muscle layer it was completely senseless. On d10, when the catheter was removed, I can finally walk around without physical obstacles. Since d3, I&#39;ve been forcing myself to walk and stand as much as possible, this really helped me during early recovery.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://freeimage.host/i/2gFlRzN">![2gFlRzN.md.jpg](https://iili.io/2gFlRzN.md.jpg)
</a>
</p>
<p>
On d11, I tried to dilate on my own and it worked very well. It&#39;s only size 0 and one hour but still a milestone! From d12 to d14, I have to hold the dilator for 2 hours everyday. The bleeding when I took the dilator out was decreasing day to day. On d15, which passed the two-week mark, I start to dilate three times a day, with the addition of size 1. The soreness at the end with size 1 was absolutely bearable. What I found interesting is, as it&#39;s a skin graft technique, the surgeon preserved out neurons and allowed them to reconnect to different post-op anatomical structures. My brain still have the old memory about various types of feeling at the bottom but the origin is completely different.
</p>
<p>
As of d15, I started to develop a daily routine consists of dilation and other works. During the dilation, I use one hand to hold and pressurise, another hand to slide between Chrome and Reddit. It&#39;s always good to read as much as possible about the post-op care, especially there&#39;re many girls sharing their experiences with Dr Chett or Dr Bank
<em>
etc
</em>
. Dilation was not painful but tightness at the beginning when upsized to size 1. Bleeding has gone away during dilation, except some discharge (and slight bleeding) when walking around (so sanitary pad or underwear is a must). From now, I&#39;ve been going out for shopping, sightseeing
<em>
etc
</em>
.

</a>
</p>
<p>
On d22, I had my follow-up consultation with Dr Chett, who examined the canal carefully with a speculum. During the procedure, he cauterised one tissue and removed some internal sutures. He was satisfied to the results. I had a full list of questions and he managed to answer them one-by-one and I didn&#39;t feel any rush.

</p>
<p>
Now it&#39;s day 24 post-op, my last night in Bangkok. I gave the team a Lego poinsettia I finished last night, to remark this holiday season, as well as my
<strong>
<em>
rebirth
</em>
</strong>
. Overall my experience is a 10/10, although sometimes I felt the lack of communication, I do appreciate everyone&#39;s effort and hard-working (including myself). Last month is one of my happiest and awardable time in my life, my soul has never felt so complete and fulfillment.

Great write up, I&#39;m so happy for you.
</p>
<p>
I had the same surgery with Dr. Chettawut 1.5 years ago, and am very happy with my results.  Dilation routine is a challenge, but I managed to stick with it and I am so glad I did.
</p>
<p>
Again, congratulations.

Gratz girl! I went a few weeks before you it seems, super happy with mine as well! To add to this I guess from my experience and other more long term Chett girls the dilation schedule is very much overemphasised. When I got home I went to only two times a day (morning and night) as it’s way more reasonable when you get back to life things. Chett himself did say that was fine as long as you extend the time to compensate, however even without that I have no depth loss or additional discomfort skipping the afternoon session. That said obviously do as you feel comfortable and at your own judgment. Also, if you haven’t gotten to the number 3 dilator yet, don’t worry if you can’t fit it in at all when you first try. It took a week to finally get it in to 5 inches when the rest could get to 6 inches almost immediately. From what I gather it’s the hardest one to adjust to.

Why fiber capsules instead of just eating more vegetables? Also, fiber capsules can make you more backed up so probably best to just take a laxative and have a good diet.

Optimizing your diet is generally much better. With psyllium husk, you receive zero micronutrients and it can at times impair absorption of micronutrients and medication.

Roughly 360000 Thai baht for the surgery only but it’s an outdated price. They increased it since last year

I would say start with 10000 cash, you can always withdraw more and use credit cards, but it’s really depends on the hospital, personal shopping desire…

Haha,don&#39;t be scared! It&#39;s might be my threshold of pain tolerance. Its wired no one was mentioning it in previous posts. I do hope they can put in sleep if I know the pain😂 it&#39;s a procedure happening in the ward so I think technically would be impossible
