Please, nothing about what I want to say is meant to sound like I&#39;m pandering to your emotions or to your pain. I am being quite sincere. First, you&#39;re not done healing yet. Second, revisions are a common thing. But I have another perspective that I offer as another transgender woman who struggles every day with my reality. In spite of how things seem, it must feel utterly amazing to not see a penis any more. I know that sounds shallow to point out, but for me, that would be a great consolation, all things considered. You and I have spent a LONG time in transition. You and I are BOTH tired... physically, emotionally, and spiritually. You are a little closer to the end of your journey, but your journey isn&#39;t over just yet. Just a few more steps. I have had my Orchi, so I have a longer path to follow still. Be strong. Be patient. I know &#34;patience&#34; is the last thing you want to hear, trust me. But you are closer now than before. And you are still healing. Hang in there. DM me if you need someone to talk to. I&#39;ll give you alternate means of contacting me if you think you need to talk. You are loved. &lt;3

She left you without labia minora. Basically, you look exposed. On the bright side, revisions can be done. But I won&#39;t patronize you. It needs revision and it&#39;s going to cost money. You also look  anatomically correct, another good thing. FWIW, female genitalia has no true norm.....

A lot of surgeons don’t create a labia minora on the first pass, so unfortunately, this is common, but it can be changed if op wants it.

Yes..I agree. She can fix this. She shouldn&#39;t have to but she&#39;ll probably be forced to fund herself unless she can get some redress. That&#39;s mostly what&#39;s wrong with this whole situation. My heart is with her and I&#39;m sur she&#39;ll find a solution.

There really isn&#39;t, I&#39;m not supposed to feel this way. I feel really heartbroken. I survived suicide last year to get to this point and now I&#39;m spiralling back down that rabbit hole

It must be really difficult and im sorry you&#39;re going through this. Its heartbreaking. Hopefully other post op ladies have recommendations based on similar experiences with their surgery. Sending positive healing vibes

You got this okay, you are amazing and brave to undergo a procedure and to endure yourself tormenting you.
</p>
<p>
Good on you and amazing work, you are fantastic you give people like me some light at the end of the tunnel knowing it can be done and it&#39;s not far from home either.
</p>
<p>
You keep doing what you do best right now, you are amazing.

I was born with a vagina and I&#39;ve seen many vagina. I think yours looks very good. I can tell it&#39;s still healing but once it&#39;s healed I think it&#39;s going to look even better! I completely understand having a vision for your body and the surgeon not achieving it. I&#39;ve been there. But just know, I think it looks great as is.

This is not a hopeless result by any means, with the right amount of money, you could turn this into a really good result!
</p>
<p>
Remember you&#39;re still healing &amp; swollen. The scaring and inflamed tissue will go away over time and fade into almost unnoticeable scars that can be zapped away with laser or tattooed over.
</p>
<p>
As for the structures, you need a labia minora and some general cleaning up of everything to make it more anatomically correct, that&#39;s a common revision though, so I think you&#39;ll be fine.

The right amount of money? His surgery with hospital fee is already over 50K aud. If Ives did PPV that would be the go as most people see Ives exactly once for surgery. Shame he is still stuck on PIV. Goosen’s reception staff are shocking and unhelpful af. That leaves very few options if any in Aus.

Australia is so close to a myriad of fantastic options in Thailand. The geographic location to all those great options makes Australia&#39;s lack of options a no-brainer, IMHO.

I really don’t want to downplay your suffering; if you feel mutilated that’s awful and I hope that you can come to terms with it, but I honestly think it looks fine. You’re not done healing, and with some revision I think it’ll look great. To me it looks like a vagina. Please, please wait until you’re done healing and then see what it looks like. I wish you a speedy recovery, mentally and physically x

You could always delay it until things become clearer or he’s more experienced. He’s new and there’s very little information about him available right now.

Huge hugs hopefully as things heal up more it will turn out better than you expect.  Just be easy to the area, keep it clean and clear of infection and follow your dilation best you can.  Its not unusual to need followup revision for lip development, adjustments, sometimes hair/cyst removal where things didn&#39;t heal up quite as well as hoped.
</p>
<p>
Honestly if everything is functionally working after a year-two then you&#39;re not in as bad shape as it seams.  And for better or worse I think you finish healing you&#39;re probably going to have a more youthful looking vagina which some women actually go in for revisions asking for later in life.
</p>
<p>
Only time will tell how well things settle, I&#39;m crossing my fingers you&#39;ll heal better than you expect.  But you have a good place here to ask questions as things heal up.

As many has said it&#39;s still healing and will be better within a few weeks / month.
</p>
<p>
Wish I could do more for you but maybe it helps if you would look how other results were at the 2 week mark and how they changed over time.

Im being honest here - that doesn&#39;t look bad!  It looks like this is fairly recent?  If so - you may be incredibly surprised what 6 to 12 months will do.
</p>
<p>
Id get some advice on what looks like separation or something going on there, but that will heal eventually and when it does things take better shape.
</p>
<p>
How long since surgery?

In three months this will look completely different, less swollen/red and more settled and in six months it will look even more different. Give it time, like a lot of time… you just had major surgery. And try not to cry or be too anxious, your mood will affect the rate of healing and the crying will put to much strain on the incisions. You’ll be okay 💕

keep the separation clean.  Apply bacitracin ointment  twice daily.  I understand your upset and disappointment.  You will not see the final result for 6 to 12 months.  You are not broken, you need time to heal like aciswoman does with tears during childbirth.  Take care of yourself physically and mentally.  You are a beautiful woman.

Sorry that your result is not up to snuff.  That said, it looks like you are healing well which is a blessing.  You will probably want to do a revision, which is common.  I would consider Thailand if at all possible. Hugs.

Yeah most definitely considering it, by the time I&#39;m ready for it hopefully all the borders open and travel is easy. I absolutely love Thailand as a travel destination and have only heard good things come out of surgery results. Would be good to see some balanced opinions

It has been too many years for me to be of any help to you regarding financials. Dr. Sutin and Dr. Burin are the main surgeons. They are very professional and very kind. If you were to contact them, provide them with photos, I&#39;m quite sure they will tell you what they can accomplish and what it would cost. My friend went to them after she was botched by a famous surgeon and they rectified everything. She was in much worse shape as her problems were both external and internal. They saved her and did a really fabulous job. She couldn&#39;t be happier now. If nothing else, contact them for your peace of mind. I know you&#39;re crashing right now, but honestly,  your issue can be rectified and you need to hear from the people that do exactly that and can share the process and the cost.

I hope it will all work out for you.  Your result looks a lot like another surgeon’s work-infamous for botching people-and with revisions they turned out ok.  So keep the faith.  And yes, Thailand is the promised land of srs.  👍

To echo what everyone else is saying, you’ve been through a journey since you’ve had your surgery.  It’s a huge undertaking.  Give yourself a chance to let your body and spirit heal before you begin to beat yourself up.  Being positive goes a long way toward healing, more than you think.

I’m not sure if this will help or not, but I was born with a vagina and mine looks kind of similar to yours! I naturally don’t really have a labia minora (I have a small one on the right, but the left is literally just non-existent). I know it’s not the results you’re looking for, but it might help to keep in mind that vulvas vary a ton, even among ppl born with them

Dr Hart , Very rushed,  he will not advise on your anatomy before surgery , it is what it is attitude. Remember, his background is urology, so one would be mindful that he would know his way around that area, aesthetics below par. Also, if you tend to scar badly, you will carry them with you as they do not fade. Depending how much donor tissue you have to start with will greatly determine your outcome. after surgery, he told me he was 80% happy with the procedure. His words  ot mine. Do your homework, and don&#39;t let your emotions make the decision  on who you go with. Remember, you want the best you can achieve because this will stay with you for the rest of your life!
