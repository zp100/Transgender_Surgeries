Hello!
</p>
<p>
I just had a revision recently on my PI vaginoplasty I received a long time ago.
</p>
<p>
I went with the colon method this time just as I lost all my depth.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve done extensive research about the colon method and I finally pulled the trigger.
</p>
<p>
I went with Dr. kamol (please don‚Äôt comment about this doctor as I had an amazing experience and very happy with my results just as I thought I was botched from my previous surgeon)
</p>
<p>
Now, in regards to research, I have NEVER come across douching with sodium butyrate.
</p>
<p>
The nurse told me the day I was leaving, that I need to douche daily with it. So I purchased a one year supply from the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Long story short, is the sodium butyrate mandatory..?
</p>

Yes it‚Äôs extremely mandatory and true you will need to douche with sodium butyrate or short chain fatty acids to prevent diversion Neo vaginitis. A medical condition where your colon canel tissue starts to become inflamed and degrade your vagina tissue. It can be treated before and in the middle stage of diversion Neo vaginitis. However once it‚Äôs in the later stages the damage becomes irreversible and your colon canel wound need to be removed. For this reason it‚Äôs drastically important for trans girls to irrigate their colon vagina with sodium butyrate or SCFA‚Äôs to prevent this. It is one of cons that I dislike and scares me away from colon srs, but since I did many research I know to care for my vagina.

I‚Äôve read coconut oil can be a replacement for the sodium butyrate? Is that true?  Again I feel bad asking Reddit as I would normally just ask my doctor but obviously there‚Äôs a language barrier in Thailand.  I felt like whenever I asked a question it was always a ‚Äúyes‚Äù

No coconut is not short chain fatty acid but can be used as a lubricant.

Your whole life unfortunately, but it isn‚Äôt like you have to do it everyday or anything. I would douche with it at least twice a week though.

Hey girl!  The person commenting hasn‚Äôt received their surgery yet.  I primarily made this post for those who HAVE received colon surgery. I‚Äôve had multiple people DM me and they said they were never advised to dilate with it. But again, I‚Äôm GOING to solely because my surgeon recommended it

Just so you know, my recovery for the revision for the sigmoid colon method was not bad as it seems. Day 3 I was already up and walking. And in regards to dilation, it is a thousand times easier than the original penile inversion method. But do your research üíñ I‚Äôm very happy with my revision

Yes if I could go back in time and have the colon method as my first surgery, I would do it in a heartbeat
