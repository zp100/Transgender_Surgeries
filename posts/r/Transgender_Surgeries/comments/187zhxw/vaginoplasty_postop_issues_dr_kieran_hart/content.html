<p>
I had peritoneal pull through vaginoplasty with Dr Kieran Hart in February this year. As a whole I&#39;ve not been very satisfied with the results for the 50 grand AUD it cost me out of pocket for the initial surgery but the main issue I&#39;ve been experiencing is a tight band around 2 inches deep into my vagina.
</p>
<p>
The 3 main dilators I use at this point are 32mm 37mm and 41mm thick. The tight spot exists for the 32mm dilator but I can get through it without trouble. For the 37mm I do need to put some effort into it and it can be a little painful to leave in there for more than a minute or so. The 42mm dilator takes an immense amount of effort to get past the tight spot and is incredibly painful. I can only leave it in for a few seconds at a time. I&#39;d describe the pain as similar in sensation to jamming your finger in a door.
</p>
<p>
I raised this issue plus a couple others with Dr Hart and he recommended a revision to cut a muscle that&#39;s too tight, which cost me another $7k out of pocket (he didn&#39;t charge me but the hospital he uses is obscenely expensive for Australia, plus travel expenses). For the tightness issue he inserted a 37mm wide dilator under general anaesthetic, said that&#39;s good and didn&#39;t do anything further in that regard, even though I had mentioned the issue was with the 41mm one.
</p>
<p>
Upon asking about this he said it&#39;s probably because my pelvis is too small and mentioned there&#39;s a doctor in the US who might be able to break my pelvis to fix it. I&#39;m not convinced this is the case though as I can still insert the 41mm dilator with great effort and pain.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m kind of at a loss as to what to do now. I need that width to accommodate my partner and with the tight spot that brings my 4.5 inches depth down to a usable 2 inches. I continue to try to dilate with the 41mm dilator but no improvement. It feels like my partner is hitting a wall during intercourse and we haven&#39;t been able to even force through it.
</p>
<p>
While I&#39;ll never regret bottom surgery I&#39;m unhappy with these results. Nearly $60k spent for meh aesthetics, scrotum skin left over on the exterior that apparently can&#39;t be fixed without horrible scarring, I can&#39;t pee straight (Imagine putting your thumb over a garden hose. He made a cut for this during the revision that made no difference) and I can&#39;t have sex.  Sorry for the rambling but does anyone have any advice here? Anything I can try? I just have no idea what I can do at this point.

This sounds similar to what some Suporn girls deal with. There is a thread on the Dr Will Powers subreditt where he discusses this issue. He came up with a $20 solution of using a baloon pump to gently stretch the restriction. Apparently, it works wonders.

That&#39;s the tool he suggests.

I would be very very fucking assertive with him and demand he fix it free of charge. He is responsible for this! It is malpractice if he doesn’t ensure you have a functioning vaginal canal.

The problem is he did offer to fix it free of charge. But I was still responsible for the $7k of other associated costs, and he still didn&#39;t end up doing anything

Hello, do you mind me asking why it cost $50,000? I was quoted only $33,000 Inc anaesthesia.

Gonna add this for anyone else who comes across this given it&#39;s been nearly 2 years postop and over a year post revision.
</p>
<p>
In terms of my results given it&#39;s been over a year since my post, I&#39;ve managed to build up to using the larger dilator with only mild discomfort instead of pain. Been single for a year now so haven&#39;t been able to see if intercourse is possible yet but do admit my previous partner had quite above-average girth which did not help.
</p>
<p>
Depth is 4 inches (dunno if I measured wrong initially but it&#39;s definitely 4 inches now). If I&#39;ve got any residual complaints that would probably be the biggest thing. Would have liked at least 5&#34; because I&#39;m unlikely to ever find someone who wouldn&#39;t have to be careful to not to be repeatedly bottoming out during sex as its not a great sensation.
</p>
<p>
One of the reasons I picked PPT was the idea of more depth and some level of lubrication. I don&#39;t know what depth I would&#39;ve gotten with inversion but I don&#39;t have any natural lubrication. Maybe occasionally I&#39;ll have to use panty liners due to mild discharge, but after the first year of recovery I&#39;ve been very dry, and not sure why that is.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m looking at getting a monsplasty (essentially public liposuction) to remove the bulk of fat left over that causes me to have fairly obvious camel toe but I think that&#39;s genetic and unrelated to Dr Hart. That will probably run me 10k unless I can convince a doctor to consider it medically necessary. That&#39;s likely the main cause of issues with peeing, and I do get chafing when riding my motorcycle due to it.
</p>
<p>
Still don&#39;t regret the surgery but probably would not have gone with Dr Hart in hindsight. He told me he &#34;doesn&#39;t discriminate based on insurance&#34; when I asked why he recommended the revision instead of trying free/cheaper options first, but in my opinion he treats everyone as if they
<em>
did
</em>
have insurance, which is a very different thing.
