I think what you‚Äôre describing is a feeling of unfamiliarity mixed with uncertainty about your face. That‚Äôs normal given you just had surgery to change your face. My mantra for these surgeries (I just had SRS and am having FFS in August) is not to look or think about it beyond what surgeons say are abnormal till they have healed. I still don‚Äôt look at or think much about my vulva beyond ‚Äúis it healing ok?‚Äù and although I know I‚Äôm going to have concerns, my plan is to do the same for FFS. My advice to you is to just trust yourself and the process, you‚Äôre going to feel more comfortable the more familiar you are with your face and your face will also continue to change as the swelling recedes over the next year. By no means have you seen your final form girl ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I can scarcely believe you had FFS a week ago! I worry I&#39;ll be wearing bandages for a month or something sometimes. You look very much human and very much girl. And shame on people for calling it a nose job. I hope you have other people with more empathetic things to say to you.

what did you all do to make it through this stage of recovery?

<p>
I haven&#39;t had ffs but for similar surgeries I find it helps to remember that you&#39;re still healing at this point. There is still a lot of swelling and it will be months before you see your final results. Imo you already look great and my guess is by the time you&#39;re fully healed you&#39;ll have worked your way through your insecurities and you&#39;ll be able to focus on the positive changes and realize how happy you are with your results.

You look really beautiful they did a great job and highlighted your natural beauty!
</p>
<p>
Its going to be weird at first as others have said because you have weird sensations, all kinds of underlying swelling.  And just too much pressure from society to look some perfect thing.  Don&#39;t worry about any of that.  Be yourself and take your time!  And if you need a boost post more pictures around here.  Trust me you&#39;ll get plenty of oomph as adorable as you are &lt;3

I‚Äôm so sorry you are feeling depressed girl. You are valid to feel that way 100%. Having said that as a outsider looking in... you look beautiful. Beautiful young woman with some bruising.üôÇ

Whoever your surgeon is, they did an excellent job. I can‚Äôt tell you had surgery, and you literally had it a week ago. You‚Äôre looking femme as hell! I can understand the not feeling human idea - I had a surgery on a different part of my body that left me with a large chunk of metal on it. But just know that you look like any other lady, and I truly mean that. You won‚Äôt need revisions unless a meteor strikes the earth and literally melts your goddamn face off.

Keep in mind that you&#39;ve been looking at yourself your whole life, and that face is very familiar...and suddenly you are presented with this new face who may seem a stranger. I think you look absolutely adorable...and you will continue to get more adorable as the swelling goes down. Be easy on yourself love!

Girl you look beautiful!  You shouldn&#39;t fear - once all the swelling subsides you will look incredible. I understand having the insecurities, but you got this.

If it helps, I know a cis woman who has never had any facial surgery and you look very much like her. I don&#39;t think you look unnatural at all.

for myself i try to tell myself i have as much choice about my face/body after transitioning as i did before it. so it helps me let go and accept it all. of course u can get more things done in the future too like any cis person might. from what i see you should be happy with your results but im sure the shock of looking so diff is very real. try to imagine a stranger first meeting u, we dont see anything out of the ordinary. you look great! just wait until your face is healed more too! let go and accept yourself unconditionally, even if that means still doing more eventually to change anything that u cant find a way to accept.

You look absolutely beautiful.  I just wish I could get any form of ffs. But I&#39;ll never be able to. I&#39;m on a fixed income and my insurance won&#39;t pay for it, plus I&#39;m permanently disabled due to combat exposure, so no way I&#39;ll be getting a different insurance anytime soon.
