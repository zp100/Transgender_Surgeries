I think it&#39;s important to remember that any surgeon will have good and bad results. No one is perfect, sadly!

I&#39;m scheduled with Suporn. His results have looked amazing. I have heard about the odd bad one sadly, but I&#39;m partly worried about the recovery. I&#39;ve heard the dilation referred to as &#34;brutal&#34; more than once which kind of worries me. Is it really as bad as some make out? Sometimes I wonder about getting PPT with Kamol üòê

It&#39;s pretty bad for the first 3 months, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to work and keep up the schedule..
</p>
<p>
Otherwise it&#39;s just a time sink, it also depends on how your body reacts to the surgery, for some it&#39;s easier than for others.
</p>
<p>
Which reminds me, I haven&#39;t done it in over a month, ugh &gt;.&lt;

Not bad but not amazing i guess. I&#39;ve had quite a lot of issues. The point is that you need to temper your expectations, not everything goes super well for everyone.

You haven&#39;t dilated in over a month? Can I also ask what your issues were and how long ago you had the surgery? x

</blockquote>
<p>
Yup. I&#39;m really bad with it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had non stop infections since about month 3, been on doses and doses of antibiotics and it&#39;s been such an issue.
</p>
<p>
I got a bad infection underneath the stitches when I went for revision and I now have a hard spot and a huge scar above my clit that is not only about 3.5cm long, it&#39;s also about 1cm wide near the bottom.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetics are kinda meh, I don&#39;t like the way it looks, partially because of my skin tone around there and partially because of my results. Which is a pity because it looked so good straight out of surgery. I wanted to go back to get another revision but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen any time soon.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t feel very good about it in general, from the issues with infections to the way it looks it just makes me feel really meh about the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
Something important that you MUST do before you go is get the hair on the perineum removed, otherwise you&#39;ll have hair inside. I wish I had been given that advice, I actually cancelled my laser sessions because I was told I didn&#39;t need to do it.
</p>
<p>
Oh yes, I had mine done end of 2018

I&#39;m having electrolysis down there to avoid the possibility of getting hairs inside. How did you find Suporn himself? I&#39;ve heard that he&#39;s hard to talk too. Maybe it&#39;s another YMMV kind of thing? Thankyou very much for replying to me btw, it&#39;s so important to get as much info as possible x

He is a bit dismissive. I think a lot of it has to do with the language barrier. But, I will say that if he tells you that it&#39;s normal and you shouldn&#39;t worry about it, you take his word for it. I&#39;ve seen some horrible things, I&#39;ve had my own panic but he was right every time, you just have to be patient and wait for things to heal.
</p>
<p>
If you think you are right about something though, stand your ground.
</p>
<p>
He moaned at me because of something to do with peeing and the catheter and he dismissed it when I told him that this was already an issue for me, so I just worded it differently and firmly explained it to him and he apologised for moaning at me.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s really passionate about his work I think.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me anything.

Did you meet some banks or Suporn patients while there? Or girls that came for aesthetic revision? Were all of them satisfied in terms of orgasms and aesthetics? How comparable are Suporn and banks results?

I met and made friends with a lot of girls there. It&#39;s mixed, I know someone who hates theirs, even after revision and I know some who are completely indifferent and some that love their results.
</p>
<p>
Everyone I know was able to reach orgasm and only one had very bad complications.

Thank you. Those girls that were not happy, were they Suporn or Banks&#39; patients. I&#39;m actually shocked, I thought Suporn clinic had a very high satisfaction rate...
</p>
<p>
Were other girls results similar to yours?
</p>
<p>
And last question if you are ok to answer, were you uncircumcised and did you have a more than average size d***? Some people say those factors contribute for a good outcome with Suporn

Same here! But I heard a lot of people said they got the same benefit from PPT too, which I think is quite promising. I think you can have Suporn first and do ‚Äúupdate‚Äù PPT in the future if needed. This is What I heard people say. Anyone has some knowledge the possibility of this?

Roughly ‚Ç¨17K/$19K for the surgery. Easily a few thousand more for the flight, hotel, food, etc.

Love, are you able to find your clit?
</p>
<p>
I ask because with some surgeons it‚Äôs clearly visible and I‚Äôve noticed that with bank and suppoorn (in pictures at least) it isn‚Äôt.

Can I ask you if you were circumcised and what was your size, small, average or big? I&#39;m sorry to ask that and you don&#39;t need to answer, but a lot of people say that the best Suporn results are from people uncircumcised and +19cm, and your results are one of the best I&#39;ve seen here

Sorry for the late reply! I was not circumcised and after several years on hormones I think I&#39;d call the size small. Things shrank a lot (:

Hi, I have some questions about your experience with Dr. Suporn (well, there are a lot of them, sorry for that), could you please help me? I plan to undergo this technique (or PPT):  What made you choose Dr. Suporn over other doctors? Do you recommend him? What made you choose &#34;The Suporn technique&#34; over other techniques? Do you recommend it as a technique for SRS? How do you consider your results in terms of aesthetics and sensitivity? What is your vaginal depth? How is the process of dilations? They are painful? Are you planning to have revision surgery? (is a very good result, and you still don&#39;t heal completely), and if so.. What would you improve your result with one? How was your stay in Thailand (Chon Buri)? How was the aftercare of Dr. Suporn and the clinic staff in general? That&#39;s all for now, and by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.
</p>

Hi! Gosh, that is a bunch of questions and I&#39;m not the best at answering them all very extensively, but:
</p>
<p>
I Chose dr Suporn because in my opinion he seemed to have the most consistently aesthetically pleasing results ( And aesthetics were my most important criteria). I would heartily recommend him: the experience was without hiccups and the care I received was good (:
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very happy with the Aesthetics but haven&#39;t reapply explored yet, so I can&#39;t say too much about sensitivity just yet.
</p>
<p>
My depth is about 18cm (~7 inches). Dilations are a chore and uncomfortable, but not painful for me. They&#39;ve also been getting a little easier again lately.  I&#39;ll probably get a revision for the posterior/anterior commissure.
</p>
<p>
The stay in Thailand was good and so was the aftercare. The hotel was good, even if it wasn&#39;t amazing. Staff were very friendly and helpful, also helpful with the insurance issues i&#39;ve been having so far.
</p>
<p>
I hope that&#39;s all the questions answered ^^
