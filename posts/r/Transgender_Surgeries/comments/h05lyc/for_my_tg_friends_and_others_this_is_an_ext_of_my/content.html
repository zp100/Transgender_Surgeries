These links are the proof that SinClair was aware of how badly he butchered me and didn&#39;t want any body in the hospital to see the surgery so He took real serious ways of keeping the nurses out and any other persons in the Hospital from seeing his work.  But I know that the other people in the OR WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS .? WHY  HAVE THEY NOT SAID SO YET???  Maybe paid off.???
</p>
<p>
I hope if they see these they should come foward to tell my attorneys what they know. We will find out not matter what if they hide its worse we will see in the next coming months.?

Ok, very early in the piece, don&#39;t go thinking the worst. Yes, it looks a mess at the moment but you will be surprised what a few weeks can do. Hold in there love, and be optimistic. Try talking to someone. ðŸ’™ðŸ’œ

First of all thanks so for your insight on my picture, now this picture is taken 7/19/2019. I am at my 1 year Post-Op today my surgery was on 7/15/2019. And I was going to put up monthly pictures of what  a canal looks like when it starts streaming down between your legs you see this part happened to me only 2 weeks post-op its so frightening that I could not scream or make a nose for over an hour. My therapist  will never forget the call that  came from the policeman who came because  my BF didn&#39;t know how to take control so the 911 was there and I ended up in the emergence room, therapist came I wanted to cry .. Do think I should give this out to the forum?  I would like to think it may help  some but it may be inappropriate . ? I am seeking some advice from the moderators. Stay tuned its real so am I. Yours; TG Jillian

I&#39;m so sorry for you, this should never happen to anyone. Rather than post pictures can you elaborate on where things are now. I know its emotional (in fact devastating) but try to be matter of fact with the results. More importantly let us know what help you are receiving and what if anything can be done to correct this butcher&#39;s handiwork. Have you seen another surgeon and if so what precisely have they said. Thanks.

Thank you for your support. I just returned  home two days ago I left  after I posted this so I was not going to do any more posting again I didn&#39;t look at this till now so sorry I would have  wrote to sooner . I needed the rest away from the memories here at my home and its got me feeling better some what. As for  what I am getting  from  the world is  going as well as expected as for the darn virus has really put off any repairs whats so ever. I pee  on both my thighs   and  of course the canal came out so the area is closed. But a new problem has shown up which my doctors at Cedar Sini medical  services  are  now aware of that.  the doctor who did this  has  also cut through  my perianel  spelling is off I think any ways he cut it down to the anus which has now shown to be pulling apart the midline  from the canal to your anus. He had staples holding this muscle together  I have all the pictures  of these  but anyways  this is a area where your leg nerves ru through  so there pulling I guess  and I some times can&#39;t stand up and I am scared  really now. The doctor at  Sini is ever waiting to get  the go for my surgery , but the Admin of the Hospital  says no operations  unless to death kind only. I am waiting. Updated  to day 7/1/2020

Most doctors 4 as of today that I have been to during this year that mostly agree that the whole start of the OP was  wrong the first cuts not followed any drawn lines and to staple the bandages  was a pure act of who ever did this  shows  he knew better than to let people see it this happened 1 year ago  today 7/15/2019 at 9:02 Am my life was taken away by this surgeon.. Every month it took on more gross appearance. I am hoping to get some positive feedback as to  hear if people want the rest of this one time  real honest display of  how a surgeon butchered me, I 69 years old I am not enjoying this display of me I have never given a review on  my gender till now this is one time that I feel needs to be seen and  know its a real person . and  whats at the end.My close friends tell me that I should tell the story from then till now I have pictures  that are not seen by us I mean I have seen  the bad surgeries online  but  not  explained  when they happened at which time  their recovery was the picture taken mine are  all dated and backed by friends who want these to give a big boost to anyone going forward with SRS. to make the surgeon answer  all your questions with answers you will understand .  so feeback please if your able?
