Lately I have been feeling guilty of not having tried my pre-op equipment, I hated it so bad, but now im like, oh God , I should have tried it, I am so curious of how that would have felt, and I have been feeling the urge to penetrate for some reason? God I am feeling so guilty and this is making me feel weird, I hope it is normal...
</p>
<p>
My advice before surgery: try your equipment if you feel like doing so, I didnt and now I regret when I had the chance

I had a lot of penetrative sex before I transitioned. It feels good, but I don&#39;t miss it. I haven&#39;t had any bottom surgery (though I&#39;ve been on hrt for a lot of years now) and I never use it that way. To do so, I would need a rx for Viagra or something. If I was with a partner who
<em>
REALLY
</em>
wanted that I would maybe do it for them, but it would be 100% for them. I much prefer to be the one being penetrated (I actually really enjoy anal penetration). I don&#39;t mind if someone stimulates my genitals with their hands or mouth and I can orgasm from it certainly, but for me penetration is the bomb.
</p>
<p>
As to how it feels, put your finger in your mouth and press it against the inside of your cheek. Then imagine that on your clit. That&#39;s pretty accurate imo. The thing about it that does feel good is when the pussy muscles contract, but I find that I enjoy feeling my partner&#39;s penis throb and twitch while he is having sex with me just as much.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s good, but I don&#39;t miss it.

Same here.  I slept with a lot of women and it feels good at first, but sometimes after awhile I would kind of get nauseated.   Other times, I would feel really silly.   As far as men, I could only top really femme gay guy types (probably basically just about trans)  or other trans.  Sometimes that was better maybe because it was less of a fraud.  Altogether, I just naturally prefer to be penetrated.   I think it is good, though, to try as many experiences (safely) as you can.

There&#39;s not much difference.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about it, nor would I say someone must try pre op sex

Maybe triy a insertable dildo or strap on and try that next time with someone. You will at least get some idea of how that body motion feels. Maybe you will try it and realize you wouldn&#39;t have liked penetrating anyway.

I do not think that would help tho 😢😰. For instance the last time I had sex, he was like &#34;oh I like how tight your pussy is it feels so good&#34; and I was on my way home like &#34;I wish I could feel something like that&#34;

My post op orgasms are 3x as big. IDK how much of that was dysphoria before, but I didn&#39;t know I was dysphoric and I got a lot of mileage before. Obviously, YMMV, but in my case, if I knew my orgasms would be earth-shattering, I would have jumped to GCS 10 years earlier.

When i was still having piv if i could concentrate really hard i could invert the sensation when she was on top so it felt like i was being penetrated; try that when YOU are on top and you will get the jest of it.

Had you ever penetrated someone previously?
</p>
<p>
A strap-on has similarities in some aspects but you&#39;re right you won&#39;t feel the tightness.

I&#39;ve had a considerable amount of penetrating sex. It feels good to me. I&#39;m trying to describe physically how it feels. Did you ever masturbate pre surgery? Ever wrap your whole hand around it with lube on? Sort of like that. But the thing your penis is inside is warm and responsive to you and you may or may not have an emotional attachment to the person associated with it.
</p>
<p>
However there are aspects of it I don&#39;t like. If you&#39;re the penetrator there are aspects of toxic cishet normativity bound up in your partners thinking and for me my own even when the sex is very queer.

not op but topping for me is such a weird experience it&#39;s just my whole body like &#34;wtf are you trying to do?&#34;

It’s pretty boring tbh not missing out. I went from bi boy to straight girl and have had plenty of penetrative sex with women though I never topped any dudes and it’s really mehhh. Then I transitioned and now do not at all use that part of my body or have sex with women. Cant wait for srs tbh, anal is fun and all but having to cleanse before hand sucks

Idk depends on the vagina and if is dry or using condom. It’s not like breathtaking it’s like masturbating but wetter and less restricted lol. Idk how to describe it. I never liked it, I love four play but usually just watched tv or movies during actual penetrative sex. I don’t miss it in the least. Receiving feels better then giving but to each their own.
