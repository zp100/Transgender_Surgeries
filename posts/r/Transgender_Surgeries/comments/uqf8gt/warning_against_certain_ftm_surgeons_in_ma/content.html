Hello everyone. I’ve consulted with many different surgeons for many different surgeries. There’s been 2 surgeons I’ve had negative experiences with and I’d like to spread awareness.
</p>
<p>
The first surgeon I’d like to speak about is Dr. Louise Perkins King. She is a hysterectomy surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts. The reason I consider this experience with her negative is because she blatantly lied to my face. To give a bit of background, I have a bleeding disorder called von Willebrand Disease (VWD). This makes my blood not clot like the average person. I bleed and bleed and bleed. Depending on the type of bleed and the length, I usually take either a pill or an infusion. It’s common for “women” to go to the OBGYN who have bad menstruo cycles due to their bleeding disorder so not having experience with it is pretty rare. I was consulting with this surgeon for a hysterectomy and asked her, “What’s your experience with VWD?”. She told me, “I usually give them Vitamin K and they’re fine.” I knew this was suspicious. I may not be a hematologist but I do have a bleeding disorder and I’m pretty well educated about it. I literally said to her “Yea, I’m not so sure any hematology team would approve of that treatment.” To give her the benefit of the doubt, I contacted my hematologist and told her what she said and asked for her opinions. She also said that no hematology team would do that. I have the mildest type of VWD and still, that wouldn’t be enough. It’s not like I bleed just because. I bleed because I don’t have enough of the clotting proteins in my blood. Vitamin K can help blood clot, but not in the sense I need. While I wouldn’t have necessarily chosen her to be my surgeon if she said she didn’t have experience with VWD. I wouldn’t have been uncomfortable with her as a doctor in general. I worry that she says things like this to patients that aren’t as knowledgeable about their condition as I am and complications arise.
</p>
<p>
The second surgeon is Dr. Oren Ganor at Boston Children’s Hospital. I had a consult with him for top surgery. So, a couple things went wrong with Dr. Ganor. First off, it’s normal not to trust your surgeon with 100% of your life within the first 5 minutes of meeting them, right? Well, not according to him. I asked him complication rate and he literally said he was insulted. Like, how high does your ego have to be to be insulted by that question? It went downhill from there. I asked I second question, I forget what it was and I forget his response. The third question I asked him was if I could show him some results to see if he could do something similar. He immediately shut me down. He said I had unrealistic expectations because I wanted like how my scars looked. Mind you, 2 of the results were his but he didn’t get the chance to see. He said that he didn’t want to do the surgery for me because I had unrealistic expectations. He just left without letting me ask anymore questions. What’s even more funny is that he said this in the notes: “_____ had many good questions to which all we answered to his satisfaction.” Lmao, what a fucking joke.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you have any other questions and I’ll be happy to answer.

Jesus christ that last surgeon sounds like a total arsehole, the way he acted is a massive red flag, why would he be opposed to patients asking questions? Is there something he&#39;s trying to hide? Sorry that was your experience, both of them are unacceptable ways to act for a surgeon

And given his response, I’ve genuinely been afraid to ask other surgeons similar questions.

Don&#39;t be, that&#39;s a completely reasonable question, in fact I would expect most patients to ask it because of course you would want to know that before letting someone operate on you, every surgery in the world has possible complications, a patient should be informed of those risks before undergoing an operation, screw him tbh

These days since insurance pays for it a lot of surgeons are suddenly “Trans experts.”  This is becoming a big problem.

i’m sorry to hear how shitty things went especially at 2 of the main hospitals for trans care in boston but really appreciate you sharing your experiences here, it’s important for folks to know these things! dr ganor is a dick. he did my top surgery which was fine but his ego is huge, and a bunch of ppl have reported terrible experiences for bottom surgery with his team. i had my hysto with dr weinstein at mgh because that’s where i’m getting phallo but mgh obgyn surgeons i’ve come across have been great if you don’t want to proceed with brigham and womens.
