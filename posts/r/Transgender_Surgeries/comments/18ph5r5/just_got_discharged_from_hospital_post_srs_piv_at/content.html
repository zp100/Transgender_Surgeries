<p>
I had a Penile Inversion Vaginoplasty on Monday, and surgeons were Cori Agarwal and Ben McCormick. I went with the University of Utah for my surgery, so I didn&#39;t get to choose my surgeons (I originally requested to have mine done by Isak Goodwin due to there being more public and friends&#39; reviews from him but they reassigned me to Cori just before they submitted insurance prior auth)
</p>
<p>
Not going to lie, this past week has been a complete emotional rollercoaster. Wish I could share a picture but I look like an absolute mess from sitting in a gurney for a week with my hair type, plus I left the hospital with a beard and no makeup. Car ride home was rough but I&#39;m sitting in bed now and have a friend taking care of me day to day from here on out. Overall I am immensely grateful to have had the nurse staff, PTs, and support I had taking care of me at the hospital. I&#39;m nervous about how things will heal up long term but I think U of U was a good choice overall because of the staff and week long hospital stay. I can&#39;t imagine this is cheap at all without insurance (I know for a fact I&#39;m hitting my out of pocket maximum for this), but having all the people around to support me to get more autonomous was worth it.
</p>
<p>
As far as results go... at the moment everything is still an ugly swolen bruised mess down there. I promised myself I would post a public review online, with pictures, just because seeing reviews from others helped me a lot in making my decision to get SRS and go with the team that I did. I might also hold off until a few months in just because it sucks to only see pictures of immediate results online and never the full picture of the healing process. So stay tuned.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I just wanted to share an update publicly and maybe answer what questions I can if anyone wants to learn about how my experience was with U of U. It&#39;s been pretty tiring and I just want to heal faster, but at least I have a lot of free time for the next few weeks (got paid time off from my job luckily, so just a lot of taking it easy and healing from now on)!

My appetite was pretty low the whole time. Like they serve you huge meals breakfast lunch and dinner and I was barely eating any of it in time. Hospital food is pretty hit or miss too. Lots of nausea, so I could barely stomach food for the first few days, doing a lot better now though.
</p>
<p>
By day 5 I was
<span class="md-spoiler-text">
super backed up (still hadn&#39;t used the bathroom yet in the whole hospital stay), and hoo boy was that an awful experience. I was sobbing for like an hour waiting for laxatives to kick in. But we got through it.

Right?!? Staying home for christmas cause I&#39;m not very mobile but 100% worth it. I&#39;m sure christmas would get a little awkward with one side of the family if I showed up tomorrow anyways.

May I ask, why did you go with PIV and not PPT?

I definitely weighed the options at some point pre op. I think the biggest reason was that it was the recommendation of the surgeon, and there were a lot of perks to getting SRS done in my local state rather than moving elsewhere for someone who specializes in PPT. Surgeon says that doing PPT adds risk and should only be considered if there isn&#39;t already enough tissue to graft the vaginal wall essentially.
</p>
<p>
I believe they actually do perform PPT with the U of U if you request it, usually only in cases where you don&#39;t have enough &#34;Donor tissue&#34; (i.e. big dick). In my case I had &#34;plenty of tissue&#34; according to one of the doctors that did the pre-op exam.
</p>
<p>
I think the biggest reason why people are drawn to PPT is self-lubrication. My friends that have gotten PIV with U of U say they were pretty impressed with wetness during sex with just the PIV alone, which is why I wasn&#39;t too concerned. I&#39;m a few months out from any of that so I&#39;ll have to get back to you in that regard but I do notice that my inner labia minora actually has some mucosal tissue (with a bit of hematoma but that will heal up fingers crossed) so here&#39;s hoping.
