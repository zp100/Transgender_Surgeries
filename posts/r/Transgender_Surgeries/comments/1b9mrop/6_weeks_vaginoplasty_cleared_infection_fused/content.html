They said it&#39;s not an issue, does that mean they&#39;ll unfuse on their own? Or are they saying you&#39;ll just have fused inner labia?

The latter unfortunately, Iâ€™ve asked about and sometimes this can apparently happen

Firstly, congrats on your surgery, overall a lovely result. Secondly, sympathies on the complications - they do take their toll. I&#39;m two months post also with Tina Rashid, and had a few complications myself - (I don&#39;t really want to  talk about them here but am happy to swap notes via private chat).   I&#39;m not a medical professional, just a serial researcher, and it appears tha labial adhesion is not uncommon. In people born with vaginas, it most often occurs in the 3-6 year age bracket, and usually resolves by pubertal completion. It can however occur at any time, and is a lesss common occurence in menopause.  It is usually caused by irritation or infection of the labia (which you experienced) and is in normally left alone to resolve naturally, unless it is causing health issues, such as urinary sexual function problems. It can be treated conservatively with Oestrogen cream, and surgical intervention is usually only indicated in sever cases, as this carries its own risks, and labial adhesion can re-occur even after surgery.

Thanks for the info! I spoke with a friend and she said she has seen in with cis partners which is a relief
</p>
<p>
It would make sense that an incision to separate would just leave an open space where adhesion would likely occur again. Iâ€™m going to keep an eye on things particularly with the urinary function because Iâ€™m still unable to make a straight urinary stream but that is mostly to do with the swelling, but having this adhesion right above the path out of my urethra Iâ€™m sure wouldnâ€™t be helping matters.
