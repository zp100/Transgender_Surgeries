Dr. Ramineni [SRS], three months post op. Just got second stage done yesterday, and here are the before and afters between stage one and stage two. I&#39;m beyond ecstatic with the results, and my depth is incredible. Can&#39;t wait to see how stage two looks like fully healed.

Looking great so far! I am actually going to see Dr. Ramineni this June! When I last talked to Katy she told me that not everyone does both stages. For you what was the reason to get the second stage surgery?
</p>
<p>
Also if I am not being too forward, what is the pink thing that is below your clitoris in the first picture?

That was a piece of granulation tissue that was cut away after that picture was taken. It&#39;s just the body trying to over heal. It was easy to get rid of in office.
</p>
<p>
The reason I went for the second stage is because having more clitoral hooding and the labia surrounding the vaginal opening was really important for me. There was also some labia bulk that I wanted cut down in general. I wanted as cis looking of a vagina as possible, and that was really only possible with the second stage. Also, there was some hair growth near the entrance of the vaginal opening that he was able to scrape away during this second stage. I also tagged on a trachea shave at the same time, so it was a double duty surgery which worked out really well since my insurance that would cover the shave expires next week.
</p>
<p>
Ramineni and Katie are amazing. You&#39;re in good hands.

That makes me so happy to hear. I have only heard great things from him so beyond having a freaking vagina, I am excited.
</p>
<p>
As for the second stage. Was that done in the office, and was that covered from the first surgery?

It was done in the hospital because I was also getting the trachea shave I think. I was under anesthesia. He did mention originally it would be in office, so I don&#39;t know why it was in the hospital this time besides that. But it was billed separately to insurance as a new procedure, so it wasn&#39;t covered from the first surgery. There are however no copays for office visits 90 days after a surgery.

I’m past the last dot on the dilators so I actually don’t know how deep that is but it’s probably around 6-7” or so.

Good dilation for the depth I suppose. I also had a lot of donor material, so in surgery he was able to get full depth on the largest dilator. And it&#39;s just PIV, but he has a low scarring method, and scrapes hair follicles off instead of requiring electrolysis. I feel like that increases lubrication.

So for Trans women, I mean I know I used to have significantly larger junk 10 years ago when I first started hrt, how much material does it take to get the max for inversion?

After a year and 9 months HRT when I got first stage, I was about 3 inches soft, 5-5.5 hard. Don&#39;t know what the average for full depth would be.

About a month I think to get the consult. And 8 months to surgery originally, but that was this past May so it got postponed to Sept.

I know this is old but thanks for sharing this. I just had surgery with him a little over a month and mine is healing the same with a small tissue sticking outward.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s looking more as that I&#39;m going to need to go in for a second stage.
