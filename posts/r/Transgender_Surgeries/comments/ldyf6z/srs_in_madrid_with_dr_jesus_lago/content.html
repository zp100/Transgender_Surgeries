This week I had an appointment with Doctor Jesus Lago in Madrid. His website has his sis results and after seeing the pictures and living in Madrid I decided to meet him and hear what he had to say. He was really kind and respectful, explored the 3 options for surgery (PI, Peritoneal pull, and colon), and after checking me out he said I could go for PI. He mentioned depth, explained everything to me, and told me that: 1. You don’t need laser hair removal for PI 2. I could be in surgery in less than a month.
</p>
<p>
I asked him why is there barely any info on Spanish doctors and he said that he thinks that the Spanish society is not really open with the surgery.
</p>
<p>
He also mentioned that he tries to limit hospital time so you’re out of the hospital in 3 or 4 days and that you can expect a month of taking it easy.
</p>
<p>
He also talked about the urethra ( I was worried about this) and he said that the technique has improved and now he has not seen any complications. He said that sensitivity and look are very important for him, so, that made me feel happy.
</p>
<p>
I really liked the experience. If you have any questions let me know, I am happy to answer.
</p>

Here is his website:

He does a follicle scrape? Is that what it is called? So that way he removes whatever is there, just in case.
