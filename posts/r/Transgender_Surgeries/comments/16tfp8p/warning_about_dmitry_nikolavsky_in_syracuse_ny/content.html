I&#39;m making this post because I know people Google their surgeons and I wish I saw a post like this before seeing him for surgery. I am going to him to fix urological complaints and get implants, and will have a total of 3 surgeries with him, the first of which has already occured. This is not a post saying to not go to him, I myself will still see him for my next two surgeries, just a heads up about certain things so you can be better prepared.

He does not provide adequate pain meds for a lot of people. He gives tramadol, Tylenol, and celebrex for pain by default. No stringer opioids. Even if you think you&#39;d find that to be enough for pain, I strongly, strongly, STRONGLY recommend you tell Nikolavsky that you don&#39;t do well with pain at your consult. That way, the office will make an appointment with their pain management clinic (which is like 15 to 20 minutes drive from the hospital) and THEY&#39;LL have to give you/clear you for pain meds. Context: I had no fucking clue they&#39;d do this and was left suffering, I was completely unable to do anything but cry and scream for a week and Nikolavsky&#39;s team did nothing about it but minimize my pain and gaslight me. I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;m scheduled for pain management right before surgery next time though.

You should know your rights before you get surgery and/or have a spine. Context: I have a medication listed in my allergies and his team came in while I was in the hospital and less than 24 hours post op to try and pressure me into taking that medication. During my post op visit, he came in with a resident and when I asked who he was and why he was there, the way he answered made it seem like I wasn&#39;t allowed to say no to him being there.

He is extremely, extremely crass (Russian), and although there is no lack in his surgical skills, you should not always trust his tone and his subjective opinions. Context: I have to have a staged urethral lengthening procedure as there wasn&#39;t much of a urethra left from my initial UL. This requires my penis to have been split open for a buccal graft. When I mentioned that I was nervous about doing this because I was worried it being split open would make it look more like a clit, Nikolavsky made an offhand comment saying that it wouldn&#39;t look like a clit or much of anything, more like a filleted fish. (He also said he cares about the fact that I am suffering and feel traumatized by the amount of pain I&#39;m in while refusing to prescribe adequate pain meds until I was seen by the hospital&#39;s pain management clinic)

Tramadol doesnâ€™t work for some people, and those other meds are very weak.

Personally, your story would be enough for me to avoid this surgeon.

A great plastic surgeon should also be a great general physician cause
