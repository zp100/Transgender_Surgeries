So, I did get around to contact Dr Stiller&#39;s office, and it turns out that he only does soft tissue work. So, for anyone considering going to him, please understand that he doesnt provide the full array of options for ffs, nor will he offer reconstruction of the forehead, instead he&#39;d only do bone shaving, which tends to have the need for a paste to be placed on the forehead to remove any bossing that may not be able to be shaved do to how thin the bone is over the sinuses, so ive read. So, now I&#39;m going to be looking for another FFS surgeon. Thx to the ppl who helped me in the comments of my original post. ðŸ˜Š

Thank you for posting this. I may still see him for cheek implants and a lip lift but I really want to have a more aggressive surgeon do my jaw and forehead.
