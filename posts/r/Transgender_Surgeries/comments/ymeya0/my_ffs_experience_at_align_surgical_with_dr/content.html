Everything pre-operatively with Dr. Satterwhite and Align Surgical was straight forward and easy to navigate. The staff there are very easy to work with and were always quick to address any problems or concerns that came up. Scheduling was easy. Dealing with insurance was easy (fully in-network for BCBS!)
</p>
<p>
Dr. Satterwhite is a very charismatic and easy to talk with person. During my consult and pre-operative appointments he left me with a very strong impression that he had my best interests at heart. He fully addressed all of my questions and concerns about each procedure and I felt very satisfied with every meeting which I had with him because of how well he inspires confidence.
</p>
<p>
Sadly he does not offer any in-house services to ease pre-operative anxiety to have a better idea of what to expect through simulations. Following his advice I hired a third party to make a simulation for me to offer me an idea of what to expect. I sent Dr. Satterwhite the simulation and x-rays which we reviewed and discussed together. After our discussion I felt like I really had a chance to input my concerns and had bolstered confidence that his vision for my surgery fully aligned with my preferences.
</p>
<p>
After my surgery, I spent one night in the surgery center afterwards. I don&#39;t think any other patients were even on the same floor as me that night, it was a bit of a strange layout compared to hospitals. I was however well taken care of, I&#39;m fairly certain that the nurse who was observing me that night was only there to make sure that I was taken care of. I was never left waiting when I asked for help, and he seemed happy to stick around and chat with me when I was feeling up to it, which made it a really pleasant experience overall. I was discharged the following morning.
</p>
<p>
Post-operative instructions have been pretty straightforward overall. I&#39;ve been given some conflicting information in regards to what I should be doing though, which was a bit annoying to clear up. I&#39;ve had two post-operative appointments with Debby (Dr. Satterwhite&#39;s PA) to remove my staples and stitches. Those appointments went smoothly and Debby addressed all of my concerns.
</p>
<p>
I have to say that this was one of my best experiences I&#39;ve had with any surgeon and their staff overall. I would very much so recommend Dr. Satterwhite to anyone who is looking for a FFS surgeon. I came to him specifically for a frontal sinus setback/type 3 forehead reconstructive surgery and I am very happy with my results. I&#39;m blown away with how great my rhinoplasty results turned out as well too. My chin/jaw work has been healing well and my tracheal shave has been free of complications.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has any questions then feel free to ask me. I&#39;d be happy to answer (although I don&#39;t currently plan on sharing photos of my results.)

Congratulations üéâ. I had bottom surgery and FFS with Dr Gurjala (Satterwhite&#39;s partner). It was also a fantastic experience. Align Surgical is one of the very best.

Hi so did get insurance through ur job or on the market. I would love to use Align but im from Colorado and i would have get insurance on the market place and i was told by the insurance companies that i wouldn&#39;t be able to use them out of state. I was looking into bcbs or united insurance but decided to go with Denver health elevate and try get the surgery in Denver.

Interesting that you stayed in the surgical center overnight. My girlfriend had FFS last month too with Dr Rodriguez from Align but it was done at Marin General Hospital.  She also had a frontal sinus setback but I believe that decision was made intraoperatively.
