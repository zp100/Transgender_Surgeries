<p>
Now that I&#39;m starting to get a better timeliness of things like hair removal, I&#39;m starting to question my decision to go with sutin...
</p>
<p>
The main reason I preferred him over bank was the recovery that suppose to be a lot simpler. There was also the factor of price and waitlist, but it wasn&#39;t as much of a factor...
</p>
<p>
Another thing is that being circumcised, if I understand correctly, doesn&#39;t work as well with bank, but I did see results of sutin for circumcised patients, and they looked good
</p>
<p>
In terms of aesthetics, I seem to prefer bank, but not by much. Things like depth are not very important to me, but sensation is
</p>
<p>
So something that was harder for me to find from the wiki, how do they compare in things other than aesthetics?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sensation
</li>
<li>
recovery (both time and how hard it is)
</li>
<li>
risks for complications (even small ones)
</li>
<li>
feel inside of the canal
</li>
<li>
general experience during the time in Thailand (and how much time)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And for people who chose one of them, what made you choose?

The first thing you must understand id they use entirely different techniques. Bank uses the Non Penile Inversion method, using the scrotal skin for the canal. Whereas Sutin uses the Penile Inversion method with  Scrotal Flap..
</p>
<p>
The Recovery methods are vastly different for both. The period for Bank is considerably longer and potentially far more painful than Sutins.
</p>
<p>
Sensation exists for both and with both you are far more likely to orgasm through external arousal - Clitoral.

Does the harder recovery of Bank also mean a higher chance for complications? And how long is longer? I&#39;ve read somewhere it can be a year for what usually takes 3 months? Because a year of pain and recovery is a lot... and what initially was off putting for me

No, there is no higher chance of complication. If anything somwhat less. And yes recovery with Bank can take up to a year. Although it varies for every individual. Sutin is more like 4-5 months. This is a reflection on the complexity of the surgeries.

Can you explain to me the differences in those techniques? What is a scrotal flap?

• Penile Inversion Vaginoplasty (PIV) As described this style of surgery involves the Inversion of the outer dermal tissue of the Penis, the inner tissue excluding urethra is utilized elsewhere in the Vulva. It can employ a variation to employ the use of a scrotal graft primarily to increase depth of Vaginal Canal.
</p>
<p>
• Suporn Method Vaginoplasty This is the Non-Penile Inversion form of Vaginoplasty, where the Scrotal tissue (in toto) is used in the creation of the Vaginal Canal. Additional depth and some moisture is achieved with urethral tissue and/or Tunica Vaginalis (Tunica Vaginalis is the Pouch of Serous Membrane that surrounds the Testes and is analogous to the Peritoneum).

The Suporn technique uses penile skin for the construction of the vaginal cavity
</p>
<p>
This is from the website, a study and also from the PDF that describes their technique and shows various results from them: &#34;The vaginal lining is formed by using a full thickness scrotal skin and penile skin graft, supplemented by urethral mucosa&#34; and sometimes the tunica vaginalis.

I do not invent the information, it is what appears on the website, the PDF that describes their technique and the study that talks about the two techniques they use to build the vulva

The Scrotal Flap is a small section of the Scrotum that is surgically removed to be attached at the Introitus.

If you know how to talk spanish, there is group/asociation called ivaginarium, they help/inform trans girls about srs, they always refer people to the pai clínic (where sutin works) they can show to fotos, tell you about all your questions and they do a videoconference a month with  girls that had surgery there, so you you also can talk to them
</p>
<p>
For what they (the girls and the woman that manages the entity) told me good results, 3 months dilation before going wild, 1 year to full revovery
</p>
<p>
Very good sensation, it comes with clit, clitorial hood, labia minora and majora, decent chance to be able to get a lil bit wet ( still need lube ), and enough to shove most weiners/straps in there
</p>
<p>
Its a 3 week stay, usualy with only granulations as conplications
</p>
<p>
Edit: typos

I am one of the Ivaginarium girl. I did my SRS and BA in PAI clinic almost 2 months ago. The association helps a lot and provides us support even before the surgery for cure, dilation, advices… It is too early to tell you about pleasure and sexual function but I already have a lot of sensation! Moreover the aesthetic is amazing (I choose Dr. Burin)

I don&#39;t know Spanish sadly... do you happen to know about results, how many get labia minora that goes all the way down? And if they can be closed together below the canal entrance in a revision?
</p>
<p>
And 1 year to full recovery, is a hard one year? Or only the first month or so is hard? And after a year it is a fully complete recovery?
</p>
<p>
And are there any bad stories? It is always a little weird to only hear good things

Based on what the girls have told me its not a hard year, maybe an anoying one due all the dilation. The pain is usually not much  after 3 weeks. One year and you&#39;re done
</p>
<p>
The labia minora is like the one in a cis vagina, well, based on the like 50 photos  i&#39;ve seen from the girls from ivaginarium the entire thing is practicly the same as a cis vagina, everything is at the same place, and  the scars are small.
</p>
<p>
About bad experiences none, but that doesent mean 0 complications, i havent heard any girls with botched surgerys, but there are girls with granulations that you&#39;ll have to get removed by your gynecologist, some stiches will pop during your first dilations(wich is normal), that the pain is manegable doesen mean a smooth reuturn flight or being able to run without shitting in somebody&#39;s ancestors for the first month...
</p>
<p>
Things like that happen, its still a surgery not tourism, but botched results i haven&#39;t seen/heard from any of them
