I posted a couple weeks ago in this sub because I live in Indiana and I’ve been doing research on doctors in my area. Of course, the only doctor that does bottom surgery here is Dr. Roth and before him was Dr. Gallagher and it seems like neither of them are very popular. At this point, I’m expecting to need to get my work done out of state, but I did a bit more digging around in this sub and found a comment saying that Dr. Colin Linke does orchiectomies in Fort Wayne. He’s not listed on the really long post that sometimes gets linked under people’s comments on here, and when I looked at his website it didn’t mention orchiectomy (just men’s reproductive health). I was wondering if any trans patients have had experience with him or if this is some weird rabbit hole of misinformation I just led myself down. Any thoughts help!
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I talked to my therapist about this and it sounds like quite a few urologists will do orchiectomies even if they don’t specialize in gender medicine (kinda like how almost any endocrinologist can put you on hormones). An orchiectomy is a relatively minor procedure compared to GRS so it makes sense that it would be easier to find someone doing it. I could go local for surgery prep and then get the rest of my work done out of state, but I still have plenty of time to plan things out.

I&#39;m going for my orchiectomy tomorrow with Linke. They ran it through my insurance as testicular pain rather than dysphoria so approval was a breeze. No letters or special appointments. If you want to know how it went, let me know and I&#39;ll update.

Yes I’d love to see that! Does it seem like Dr Linke has a lot of trans patients or are you and your procedure an outlier for him?

okay, just about 2 weeks out and it seems to be healing just fine. the really annoying thing is he wanted to do the two higher incisions on either side and i requested the single midline incision. i get home and aware enough after the anesthesia wore off a bit to look and i’ve got the inch and a half midline incision, but also a higher second one cm incision with a dab of surgical glue on it to close it. what the hell?
</p>
<p>
there’s no mention of a second incision or complications in the surgical report. i called the nurse today and she talks to the surgeon who says there was only one incision. so what’s the second goddamn hole? it’s going to leave a bigger than pea-sized scar that the plastic surgeon will have to work around when i eventually have my vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
as i see it, the most likely explanation is that he started with the two incision method and after inserting the scalpel went, “oops!”, withdrew and moved to the midline incision. the other possibility is that he dropped the scalpel on my junk.
</p>
<p>
so annoying that he essentially lied about the mistake. i understand the motivation, but so unprofessional.
</p>
<p>
i would look for other options. i will be telling my HRT doc who referred me about this and asking her to inform patients about my experience before referring.

Wow, that’s interesting. Maybe

should add Colin Linke to the wiki index so other trans people in Indiana can see this?

I think he see trans patients pretty regularly for this. I felt very comfortable with him at the consult. Seeing all the old guys looking miserable in the waiting room was a bit ick. But a girl’s gotta do what a girl’s gotta do.
